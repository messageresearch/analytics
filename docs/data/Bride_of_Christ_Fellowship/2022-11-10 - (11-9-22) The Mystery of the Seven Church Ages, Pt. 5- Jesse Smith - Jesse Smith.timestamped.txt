[2:36] know uh the sweetness of the holy spirit
[2:38] will guide us
[2:40] yeah I'm always a little nervous on
[2:41] Wednesday night I come right into
[2:42] service out of work I had an incredibly
[2:44] awful day today but
[2:47] um thank God that God protected
[2:49] everybody that's all I can say thank God
[2:50] God protected Everybody by his grace and
[2:53] his Mercy
[2:56] so thank the Lord you can switch over I
[2:58] just want to show a few pictures here
[3:00] um
[3:02] but we try to use a few visuals here by
[3:04] the grace of God and we're trying to get
[3:07] this
[3:09] in order here tonight this is part five
[3:11] here we've been looking at the uh the
[3:14] seven churches letters to the seven
[3:16] churches in the Book of Revelation The
[3:19] Book of Revelation is the final book in
[3:21] the entire Bible it contains a prophecy
[3:23] of
[3:25] the last two thousand years everything
[3:27] that has happened in the last two
[3:28] thousand years all the major spiritual
[3:30] events
[3:31] uh contains many of those events and
[3:34] also tells what's going to happen after
[3:36] Jesus comes back the second time praise
[3:38] God so we have a a we have a great we
[3:42] have a great glimpse into the current
[3:44] day the past 2000 years and also
[3:48] eternity to come by the grace of God
[3:49] what a privilege praise God what a
[3:52] privilege so we like to look uh at this
[3:55] thought you know I just thought I'd show
[3:57] this picture here to kind of give you
[3:59] just a visual here in Revelation we see
[4:01] Jesus Christ standing in the midst of
[4:04] the seven golden candlesticks
[4:06] and the Bible says a sword goes out of
[4:09] his mouth he has hair white as wool he
[4:12] has this this robe this Vester uh
[4:16] hearing his feet are like brass and each
[4:19] one of these has a special meaning in
[4:20] fact there are seven details about Jesus
[4:22] Christ in this picture I'm not going to
[4:24] go through those today but but the main
[4:26] two I want to point out are the Seven
[4:28] Stars and the Seven uh golden
[4:30] candlesticks Jesus tells us these Seven
[4:33] stars represent seven men that would
[4:36] come to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[4:38] Christ
[4:39] on Earth over these last uh 2000 years
[4:43] praise God and they would all shine with
[4:46] the same Light of Christ Hallelujah in
[4:48] other words their their preaching would
[4:50] be about Christ it would be the most
[4:51] accurate uh sermons about Jesus Christ
[4:54] uh their light their lights would Shine
[4:57] Jesus said they'd be like a city on a
[5:00] hill that could not be hidden praise God
[5:01] hallelujah he said he would say you are
[5:04] the light of the world praise God
[5:05] hallelujah and so God Jesus chose seven
[5:08] important men down through the last two
[5:10] thousand years and he revealed himself
[5:12] to each and every one
[5:14] but each of these Stars went to each of
[5:17] the seven candlesticks or different time
[5:21] periods over the last two thousand years
[5:24] okay so that's why each there's one star
[5:27] above each Candlestick so each time
[5:30] period got one messenger who would
[5:33] preach Jesus Christ the most accurate
[5:35] with the most power praise God with the
[5:38] most uh Vindication that Jesus Christ
[5:41] was still alive amen hallelujah thank
[5:43] God I know Jesus is still alive tonight
[5:45] praise God hallelujah we can't force
[5:47] them to do Miracles we can ask him we
[5:48] can't force him to show himself in fact
[5:50] some of us have never even heard the
[5:51] voice of God or anything like that maybe
[5:54] never even seen a vision or something
[5:55] but we've seen the spirit of God or we
[5:57] know the spirit of God speaks to our our
[6:00] minds it speaks to our souls and we see
[6:02] God answer our prayers and we many of us
[6:05] have seen Miracles but we can't
[6:06] necessarily prove him ourselves but
[6:08] we've experienced the power of God and
[6:11] we know Jesus Christ is alive today
[6:12] praise God he makes us known or He makes
[6:15] himself known in each way uh or each one
[6:18] of our lives in a unique way each one
[6:20] each one of us have a unique testimony
[6:22] praise God like us and God allowed him
[6:24] to get get into the depths of of
[6:26] addiction and then then Jesus Christ
[6:28] brings them out of that praise God Saves
[6:30] them from a certain death and and
[6:32] suicide attempts and all these things
[6:34] and just say he rescues him out of there
[6:36] it's the power of Jesus Christ to change
[6:38] your life amen hallelujah it's just a
[6:41] beautiful thing and each one of us you
[6:42] know I was I was raised in poverty and
[6:45] and uh uh and went to college up here to
[6:48] play football for Akron and almost
[6:50] seemed like I had the whole world in
[6:52] front of me you know that but then God
[6:53] takes takes my health and and uh brings
[6:56] me to Christ and now I preach the gospel
[6:58] praise God so from a poverty-stricken uh
[7:01] sinner complete sinner into a real
[7:03] servant of Jesus Christ praise God it's
[7:05] a great testimony praise God although
[7:07] each one of us have a unique testimony
[7:09] Hallelujah and God is reveals himself in
[7:12] each person's life and he asks each
[7:14] person to shine the light of Jesus
[7:16] Christ praise God and so that's what
[7:18] we're here today and as always to serve
[7:21] the Lord Jesus Christ now
[7:23] these seven candlesticks are represented
[7:26] by these seven time periods one two
[7:28] three four five six seven
[7:32] okay so each each of those candlesticks
[7:34] represent a different time period here
[7:36] we are we're in 2022. uh here we are in
[7:40] the time period we're in the laodicean
[7:42] church age or we're in the the time of
[7:43] laodicea the Bible calls it uh where the
[7:47] the word uh laodicea means the people's
[7:50] rights we're in an age where people have
[7:53] more rights than ever but they're
[7:54] choosing the right to do sin rather than
[7:57] the right to do the Bible ways God's
[7:59] ways uh they're they're they're they're
[8:01] they're choosing now uh there's a law in
[8:04] in California now to have abortions 28
[8:06] days after birth
[8:08] after birth yeah it's there it's it was
[8:11] on the ballot if I'm not mistaken it's
[8:13] true after
[8:15] now if you've ever seen what happens in
[8:17] a real abortion it's horrific it's
[8:20] completely it takes a demon-possessed
[8:22] person to do something like that it's
[8:24] just incredibly incredibly Wicked and
[8:26] we're recently reminded of that we saw a
[8:27] little video of that recently just it's
[8:29] incredibly heartbreaking I started
[8:30] crying it's just it's incredibly Wicked
[8:34] but that's what word and that's what
[8:36] we're the age and the right so people
[8:37] have a right even if you're a human you
[8:38] have a right to call yourself a tree or
[8:40] a bird
[8:41] or you have the right as a man to call
[8:43] yourself a woman or a woman to call
[8:45] himself a man it's it's insanity but
[8:48] that's the age that we're living in it's
[8:50] people's rights they want their own
[8:52] rights to live in sin and and reject the
[8:55] Bible and reject God's truth uh they
[8:57] want that right and so they're allowed
[8:59] that right but we've got a right to live
[9:00] in Holiness praise God Amen we've got a
[9:03] right to obey the Bible praise God and
[9:05] show the love of Jesus Christ where
[9:07] where the world is filled with love for
[9:09] sin and love for wickedness but we have
[9:11] a love for the truth we have a love for
[9:13] Holiness praise God we have a love for
[9:15] treating one another with true Godly
[9:17] respects Hallelujah and a real a real
[9:20] Christian Life Hallelujah the only real
[9:22] life there is is a Christian Life
[9:23] Hallelujah ever other life is selfish
[9:26] and uh self-serving praise God and will
[9:29] end in separation from God in the Lake
[9:31] of Fire but a life that serves God a
[9:33] life that loves Jesus Christ will live
[9:35] eternally praise God amen amen
[9:37] hallelujah so each of these
[9:39] each of these time periods was one of
[9:42] those seven candlesticks that we saw so
[9:45] Ephesus amurna uh pergamos thyrotera
[9:48] Sardis Philadelphia laodicea each one of
[9:52] those represents a uh a time period and
[9:55] then the stars represent a man I'm gonna
[9:57] try to get to this one
[9:59] I'm gonna have to skip that that's got
[10:00] motions on it but this is what I want to
[10:02] get to next
[10:04] so each of the Stars was a man Paul was
[10:06] a mighty of course an extremely mighty
[10:08] man of God we'd say in humility iranius
[10:11] marked in Columba Martin Luther John
[10:13] Wesley We Believe William Branham was
[10:16] the last messenger here to the the seven
[10:18] Church ages so I just want to meditate
[10:21] on this here thought for just a moment
[10:22] here by the grace of God let me set a
[10:24] timer here
[10:27] and we'll just try to review this here
[10:28] now the section I want to look at
[10:30] tonight is the gaining and losing and
[10:32] restoring of Truth during the church
[10:35] ages so before getting into the church
[10:37] ages I think it's important for you to
[10:38] see by the scripture that Jesus gave the
[10:41] church so much truth that's what this
[10:43] white represents here the white
[10:44] represents truth that Jesus gave to them
[10:46] right but by the end of the age they
[10:49] lost some of that truth
[10:50] right the Believers have started
[10:52] compromising not not the True Believers
[10:55] right but but we'd say the the foolish
[10:57] virgin they started compromising the
[10:58] real Holy Ghost believer they'll never
[11:00] compromise on anything praise God
[11:02] hallelujah amen but it's those that are
[11:05] not born again they're the ones that
[11:07] will compromise on the word of God
[11:08] hallelujah
[11:09] but a real born-again child of God how
[11:11] can you compromise when Jesus Christ
[11:13] permanently lives in your soul praise
[11:15] God it's impossible to compromise amen
[11:18] it's impossible
[11:20] because Jesus the Bible said Jesus will
[11:22] guide us into all truth praise God we're
[11:25] not finding less truth we're finding
[11:27] more truth amen amen every service every
[11:30] video we put out or whatever on YouTube
[11:31] everything we're finding more truth in
[11:34] the scriptures we're finding more ways
[11:36] to live holy amen we're finding more
[11:37] Victory Hallelujah more more strength
[11:40] amen are there more promises amen we
[11:42] find more Victory amen we find more and
[11:44] more we can find more truth all the time
[11:46] that's the plan of a Believer we are so
[11:49] in other words we're in that last day
[11:50] you and I are the light praise God
[11:53] we're the small group that has the light
[11:56] of Truth uh Paul says the light of Life
[11:59] another way to say it praise God the
[12:01] light of life
[12:03] so we're going to see this we're going
[12:04] to see how the truth slowly diminished
[12:07] over the course of all these years and
[12:08] then it was a little bit restored and
[12:10] then just a little bit at the end time
[12:12] this is how Jesus describes the seven
[12:15] Church ages it's completely accurate
[12:17] it's completely scriptural praise God as
[12:20] you study the Book of Revelation
[12:22] chapters two and three
[12:25] all right now
[12:28] it was uh God's desire to give the light
[12:32] and then God's desire to restore the
[12:34] light okay because God is showing
[12:36] something with this God's showing
[12:38] something with losing strength and then
[12:40] regaining strength God is showing
[12:42] something there God is showing he's a
[12:44] god of restoration praise God hallelujah
[12:48] he always does that now we know Jesus
[12:51] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[12:53] forever but Jesus never said the church
[12:55] is the same yesterday today and forever
[12:57] and that's what the church ages prove
[13:00] the church would change
[13:02] right there would be a different uh they
[13:04] would lose some truce we're going to get
[13:05] to a little bit they would lose some
[13:07] things they would miss out they would
[13:08] miss uh different Revelations they would
[13:11] lose track but they would stay true to
[13:13] God's word they would as much as they
[13:14] knew they would stay true to that it's
[13:17] all it's all plain right there in the
[13:18] Book of Revelation but then Jesus says
[13:20] I'm going to restore all that at the end
[13:23] time we're not living in a season of
[13:25] loss we're living in a season of gain
[13:28] praise God I'll say like this we're
[13:30] living in the last season of gain amen
[13:31] we're living in the last time when we're
[13:34] going to have the truth restored when we
[13:36] our questions will be answered praise
[13:38] God hallelujah when the seals are taken
[13:40] off the book Church we're living in the
[13:42] age of the open book praise God
[13:44] the Bible is not a spiritually closed
[13:46] book to us where we we look at it and we
[13:48] don't understand we understand the Bible
[13:50] and we can point to the Bible and tell
[13:52] and tell these Mysteries and how they've
[13:55] been revealed we can tell the true
[13:57] Doctrine we can TR we can tell how man
[14:00] lives by every word of God that proceeds
[14:02] out of the mouth of God Amen
[14:04] we can tell how the Saints live we can
[14:07] tell how how how the how they were led
[14:10] by the Holy Spirit how they had the
[14:11] teaching how they lived their lives and
[14:13] we can look at our lives and say it's
[14:15] exactly the same today praise God
[14:17] hallelujah amen that's exactly right
[14:22] I believe that now
[14:24] Jesus calls these men stars and I just
[14:27] want to look at a few verses because
[14:28] this is a time of great Darkness upon
[14:32] the Earth it's a time of spiritual
[14:34] Darkness now if you got your Bibles uh
[14:36] let's go to Acts Chapter 13 Verse 47
[14:40] just swear so you can see where I love
[14:42] it Jesus Christ says there's going to be
[14:43] seven Angel stars and then Jesus Christ
[14:46] calls the first one Paul a light to the
[14:48] Gentiles Hallelujah
[14:50] so that gives us continuity or that
[14:52] gives us the same Revelation uh in the
[14:55] book of Acts as in the Book of
[14:57] Revelation
[14:58] so acts 13 47.
[15:04] Linda you want to read that and I can
[15:05] tell you got it thank you
[15:15] amen hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[15:18] Jesus says I'm setting you as a light to
[15:21] the Nations praise God is that right a
[15:23] light to the Nations
[15:25] Paul Paul a former man who was Stand By
[15:30] and Watch Christians murdered now
[15:31] instead of watching them murdered uh
[15:33] he's trying to save their lives praise
[15:35] God he's trying to get them out of
[15:37] prison right he's trying to rescue them
[15:39] a man that used to hate Christians now
[15:40] he loves Christians and now he was
[15:42] Darkness but now he's light praise God
[15:44] Jesus called him to be light Jesus
[15:47] called you and I to be light as well
[15:48] praise God
[15:50] thank the Lord
[15:51] now I'm going to go to chapter 26 verse
[15:54] 18 and 23.
[15:56] 26 18 and 23.
[16:00] Jesus says it again 26 18-23 to open
[16:04] their eyes and to turn them from
[16:06] Darkness to light
[16:08] and from the power of Satan unto God
[16:11] that they may receive forgiveness of
[16:13] sins and inheritance among them which
[16:16] are Sanctified by faith that is in me so
[16:19] the gospel takes you from total darkness
[16:21] spiritual Darkness a life of lying and
[16:25] stealing right and cussing and and
[16:27] Witchcraft right and drug addiction it
[16:30] takes you from a life of sexual
[16:32] immorality sexual sin it takes you from
[16:34] a life of Darkness into a life of
[16:37] Holiness praise God it takes you from
[16:39] Darkness to life that's what the real
[16:41] gospel does amen hallelujah the fact is
[16:44] most churches are not real churches
[16:46] the fact is most churches are are
[16:49] deceived churches they're actually
[16:51] synagogues of Satan because they deny
[16:54] the very word of God that Jesus said
[16:56] praise God they deny the light that
[16:58] Jesus sent through Paul and John and
[17:00] Peter thank God for the light praise God
[17:03] the fact that we have the life shows we
[17:05] are children of the light amen
[17:07] because we live the light we preach the
[17:09] light amen hallelujah We Share the Light
[17:11] Hallelujah we love the life our lives
[17:14] are the light of the world Amen
[17:16] Gloria
[17:17] Hallelujah verse 23.
[17:23] that Christ should suffer and that he
[17:25] should be the first that should arise
[17:26] from the dead and should show light unto
[17:29] the people and to the Gentiles how many
[17:32] lead Paul was the light of the age
[17:35] you say you're the light you're the
[17:36] light in darkness and you're going to
[17:38] shine the light to the Nations sound
[17:40] like sounds like a light to me praise
[17:41] God
[17:42] Hallelujah so we can see it and Jesus
[17:45] says I am the light of the world in John
[17:47] 8 12 you don't have to turn there he
[17:49] that filed me listen shall not walk in
[17:52] darkness that's how you know if you're
[17:54] following Christ you're not walking in
[17:56] darkness you're walking in the light
[17:58] praise God you can see I'm not walking
[18:01] in sin I'm walking in obedience to the
[18:03] word of God I know where I'm walking
[18:05] amen because the light is shining on my
[18:07] path Hallelujah
[18:09] I know where I'm walking I know where
[18:10] I'm going
[18:11] this world is Darkness this world is all
[18:14] spiritual Darkness praise God but Jesus
[18:16] Christ is the light of the world and
[18:18] then his light shines through each one
[18:20] of us and then we are light to others
[18:22] praise God
[18:23] amen
[18:25] now we've begun We Begin this church age
[18:28] with uh the book of Acts begins with all
[18:30] the power and all the word praise God
[18:34] and we know we're not going to go there
[18:36] but we know Joel 2 23-26 says I will
[18:39] restore all that they had the beginning
[18:42] through the former rain the latter rain
[18:44] uh Joel says I'll restore saith the Lord
[18:47] he said their Vats will be full of wine
[18:49] and oil praise God Amen they'll not be
[18:53] ashamed of the Gospel Hallelujah so we
[18:55] know the beginning and the end will have
[18:58] the restoration now there was a lot of
[18:59] Believers there's a lot less Believers
[19:01] today Jesus said few there be that find
[19:03] it at the end time okay so there's a lot
[19:05] more Believers a lot less Believers
[19:07] today but the fact is the same that
[19:10] they'll have the same power the same
[19:12] word the same manifestations the same
[19:14] truth the same life it's the same
[19:16] holiday all the time Hallelujah
[19:19] thank God
[19:20] it's the same light all the time praise
[19:23] God the light of the world Jesus Christ
[19:24] Hallelujah
[19:26] now in between though we see there's
[19:29] going to be a time where we're lacking
[19:31] the fullness of the word and Power
[19:34] here
[19:36] so between these we have a lack of the
[19:39] word and the power because Jesus said
[19:41] I'll restore right I'll restore saith
[19:44] the Lord
[19:45] now at Pentecost
[19:47] at the beginning of the church they had
[19:48] full word and full power we know they
[19:51] had the full word of God because uh the
[19:54] these disciples wrote down the four
[19:56] gospels Paul wrote 13 let us think of
[19:59] that 13 letters ah I only got two books
[20:02] out Paul had 13 letters out that were
[20:04] thus saith though mine aren't even thus
[20:06] say the Lord but Paul 13 thus saith the
[20:08] Lord letters my it's amazing wrote most
[20:12] of the New Testament Canon there as far
[20:13] as the doctrine and number of letters
[20:15] but they also have the fullness of power
[20:18] lame men were healed at the beginning
[20:20] praise God people were healed just by
[20:23] getting in the shadow of Peter
[20:25] praise God now Church Jesus is the same
[20:28] today if you come to church like that if
[20:29] you in other words if you find the
[20:31] perfect will of God for healing if you
[20:33] find the perfect will of God there's
[20:34] nothing going to stop the perfect will
[20:36] of God for moving on your behalf amen
[20:39] we saw that with sister Marie right when
[20:41] she was bleeding she come to church you
[20:43] just she just knew it was going to
[20:44] happen and then she stopped bleeding
[20:46] right during the service because that's
[20:47] what Jesus does amen hallelujah because
[20:50] it was that it was her perfect it was it
[20:52] was the perfect will of God for that
[20:54] time to get the miracle now she started
[20:56] to suffer all those whatever they were
[20:57] months or years she said to suffer with
[20:59] the bleeding but when it came time I
[21:02] love it it was the right time the right
[21:04] anointing the right word of the right
[21:06] amount of faith in other words God will
[21:08] give you sufficient amount of Grace for
[21:10] the sufficient hour praise God
[21:12] hey man in other words God is going to
[21:15] prepare you for these Works God is going
[21:17] to make sure these Works come to pass
[21:18] because his word cannot fail praise God
[21:21] and he and he will show up in your life
[21:23] he will prove the member of the Bible
[21:25] said eventually he'll have everybody
[21:26] bowed down at the feet of the Believers
[21:28] remember we preached on that last month
[21:29] eventually everyone's got to bow down
[21:31] but even in your life God will prove in
[21:33] your life to others that you are the
[21:35] True Believer praise God
[21:37] just because you're so and so I'm gonna
[21:39] let you change days that you work praise
[21:40] God just because of of who you are
[21:43] praise God
[21:44] amen
[21:47] now
[21:48] they had all the power they had the
[21:50] Bible said they had great Witnesses of
[21:53] the resurrection of Jesus let's read
[21:54] that acts 4 33. Malachi you want to get
[21:57] that acts 4 33.
[22:00] now see Church
[22:03] the early apostles were given this lying
[22:05] anointing it was this bold great power
[22:09] right we all want to see more power
[22:11] we're praying we're believing for more
[22:12] power we believe that will be restored
[22:14] praise God we can see it in our lives
[22:16] praise God
[22:19] but this early church had this line
[22:20] anointing so we got to look at the line
[22:22] anointing and kind of compare it to the
[22:24] eagle anointing this is more for our
[22:25] church you know the uh our regular
[22:27] church not for our visitor you know
[22:28] we got to see they're both spiritual
[22:30] Powers praise God
[22:32] but they're slightly different just like
[22:33] The Lion and the ox are slightly
[22:35] different right just like the the ox and
[22:37] the man are slightly different but then
[22:39] you have the eagle the Flying Eagle
[22:41] anointing
[22:42] but look at uh Malachi you read that
[22:44] acts 4 33.
[22:48] litmus of the resurrection of the Lord
[22:50] Jesus and great grace was upon the wall
[22:53] all right so great power they were had
[22:56] this great lion power praise God the
[22:58] line of the tribal Judah Jesus Christ
[23:00] Hallelujah and God gave that to them but
[23:04] you find as we go through the church
[23:05] ages we see less and less of the power
[23:07] less and less of the truth but then God
[23:10] starts restoring
[23:12] a church we must never feel bad where
[23:14] God placed Us in this thing right some
[23:17] of us wish we could live in here you
[23:18] know maybe I would I'd say I wish we
[23:20] could live there and seen all the great
[23:21] power and demonstration and things like
[23:23] that
[23:24] well that was for their day but God
[23:26] chose for me to live in this day praise
[23:28] God and so I've got to get under the
[23:30] anointing of the holy spirit for this
[23:32] day be as faithful as I can to it be as
[23:35] diligent the Bible said make your
[23:37] calling and election sure praise God
[23:39] give all your heart soul mind is Right
[23:41] fall under the anointing of this
[23:43] spiritual ego ego has a great eyesight
[23:45] Eagles can watch Eagles can see Eagles
[23:48] Fly Above the world and that's the
[23:50] anointing that we have we're setting in
[23:52] Heavenly places we not we're we're not
[23:54] going to be the sons of God someday
[23:56] we're the sons of God right now praise
[23:58] God Amen now you're not one day I'm a
[24:01] daughter of God you always were a
[24:03] daughter of God Amen and when the spirit
[24:04] of God is on you and then when you're
[24:06] walking the power of God then you're
[24:08] walking as a son and daughter of God and
[24:11] you're led by the holy spirit amen
[24:13] Hallelujah
[24:15] thank you Jesus
[24:17] and then Peter said we have all things
[24:19] that pertain to life and godliness so
[24:21] all the spiritual uh blessings that we
[24:24] need today are available to us
[24:28] uh and then remember when Paul was there
[24:29] in Ephesus at the beginning Paul
[24:31] declared the whole Council of God to
[24:33] them in three years now of course he
[24:35] didn't he didn't have to preach the Book
[24:36] of Revelation right because it wasn't
[24:37] even written yet so
[24:39] I don't know if you need another year to
[24:40] preach Revelation or not but I could
[24:43] preach it may be shorter than that but
[24:45] it took three years to give him or for
[24:48] him to give the whole counsel of God now
[24:50] it's true church not all the churches
[24:52] had all the letters at the beginning but
[24:54] what they did have was the Holy Ghost
[24:57] praise God and I'll say like this the
[24:59] Holy Ghost is sufficient the Holy Ghost
[25:01] can make you live these words even if
[25:03] you don't even know what they are and
[25:05] the church said
[25:06] Hallelujah the Bible is a blessing but
[25:09] it's not absolutely absolutely necessary
[25:11] to live the Christian life because they
[25:12] didn't have all those letters at the
[25:13] beginning
[25:14] they didn't write Matthew Mark or Luke
[25:16] and John Joe 30 or 40 50 years after
[25:18] Jesus already left
[25:20] what were they feasting on their prayer
[25:22] lives amen hallelujah the writings of
[25:25] the prophets amen the Old Testament and
[25:27] God was sufficient even though they felt
[25:29] like or even though we might think they
[25:30] didn't have enough they had plenty
[25:32] because they had Jesus Christ amen
[25:35] Hallelujah that'll encourage us Church
[25:37] we've got Bibles we've got phones we've
[25:39] got everything we got everything we
[25:40] could possibly want so we need more of
[25:42] Jesus praise God
[25:44] that ought to be encouragement to us
[25:47] and Jesus word was still true he said
[25:50] I'll still guide you into all truth even
[25:52] though they didn't have all the New
[25:53] Testament Canon we'd say
[25:55] most of those people at the early church
[25:57] on the day of Pentecost Brothers they
[25:59] never got to read the book of Revelation
[26:00] because they already died and passed on
[26:02] right that was 30 A.D 30 A.D The Book of
[26:05] Revelation wasn't coming for 60 or 70
[26:08] more years but could they live a
[26:10] Christian Life absolutely praise God why
[26:12] because Jesus lived inside of them Jesus
[26:15] took his Abode in in their souls
[26:17] Hallelujah Hallelujah and then he lived
[26:20] his life through them that's what we did
[26:22] they let Christ live his life through us
[26:24] hallelujah
[26:26] but thank God we got a whole bunch of
[26:28] reminders right here that they didn't
[26:29] have
[26:30] Hallelujah
[26:33] no Jesus had said all things must be
[26:36] restored so let's read that Matthew 17
[26:38] 11 uh brother uh Austin you want to read
[26:41] that when you get that acts 17 11. I'm
[26:43] sorry Matthew 17 11 I'm sorry Matthew I
[26:46] always mix those up I guess I mix that
[26:48] one on the podcast one time
[26:50] Matthew 17 11. here Jesus says all
[26:53] things must be restored before the end
[26:55] time
[26:58] answered and said unto them Elias truly
[27:02] shall first come
[27:03] store all things all right thank you
[27:05] brother praise God so a man with the
[27:08] spirit of Elijah has to restore all
[27:10] things this could not be uh
[27:14] Elijah the tishbite to come back from
[27:16] the dead to restore Moses's law because
[27:18] Hebrews 8 says the law is decaying wax
[27:21] old and Vanishing away that's what
[27:23] Hebrews 8 13 says
[27:26] so Jesus is speaking about another man
[27:28] who had the spirit of Elijah to restore
[27:30] the New Testament truce praise God
[27:32] hallelujah
[27:36] that's exactly what we'll see in the
[27:37] Book of Revelation chapter 11 right
[27:39] Moses and Elijah they're not going to
[27:41] point to the law they're going to point
[27:42] to Jesus praise God they're going to
[27:44] prepare them to receive what the
[27:46] Gentiles just gave back or what God took
[27:48] from the Gentiles and he grafted the the
[27:50] Jews back into it he's going to get them
[27:52] ready for Christ praise God
[27:54] Hallelujah
[27:55] now
[27:57] next
[27:59] we're not going to go through these just
[28:01] for time's sake because I want to get to
[28:02] some of these other uh visuals here
[28:04] tonight
[28:05] but if we read Daniel 12 verse 4 Daniel
[28:09] 12 verse 9 with Revelation 10 7 1-11 and
[28:13] Matthew 24 verse 14. we come to this
[28:15] conclusion the end of human history
[28:18] cannot come until the mystery of God is
[28:20] finished and preached in all the world
[28:23] for a witness unto all nations amen this
[28:27] can only happen in the age of Technology
[28:30] right because let's read Daniel 12 verse
[28:32] 4 though let's read that Daniel 12 4.
[28:38] sister who would you want to read that
[28:39] when you get that thank you Daniel 12
[28:41] verse 4.
[28:51] so this scripture speaks of the
[28:53] technology age
[29:08] amen thank you sister so the book is
[29:11] closed the Bible gives a symbolism like
[29:14] it's sealed up no one's going to really
[29:16] understand this book until the time of
[29:18] the end when knowledge is increased
[29:21] praise God where they can now send
[29:23] people up to space
[29:25] every day they can make strips to space
[29:27] and come back if they want to right they
[29:29] have that they have that knowledge right
[29:31] you can fly around the world and how
[29:33] many hours can you get around the world
[29:34] now anybody know
[29:36] I forget
[29:37] but it was it's not very it's not very
[29:40] long especially if you're in the
[29:41] military you can go pretty fast break
[29:43] the sound barrier knowledge has
[29:45] increased and but this is the time when
[29:47] God's word is restored praise God
[29:50] also I was looking up about the
[29:52] Industrial Revolution for our day and
[29:54] and yeah our our uh our lifespan is now
[29:57] about 75 to 80 years that's twice what
[29:59] it was before the Industrial Age so
[30:02] before Henry Ford and the Model T right
[30:05] before this time when knowledge is
[30:07] increased and we have assembly lines and
[30:09] just now it's unheard of robots on
[30:11] assembly lines not humans robots
[30:13] right knowledge has increased at this
[30:15] time and so this is the age of people's
[30:18] rights this is the age of the end time
[30:20] at this time the Bible has to be made
[30:23] known amen
[30:24] Glory now I also want to read
[30:26] Ecclesiastes 3 verse 6. Ecclesiastes 3
[30:29] verse 6.
[30:31] I'll try to get there by God's grace
[30:33] because the Bible does say there is a
[30:34] season a time to give
[30:36] and a time to lose Ecclesiastes 3 verse
[30:39] 6.
[30:41] a time to get and a time to lose a time
[30:43] to keep and a time to Cast Away
[30:47] so here we we all know there's times to
[30:49] get and lose in the natural those are
[30:51] sometimes hard Seasons right but they're
[30:53] good they're good teachers
[30:55] and so it is in the spiritual there's a
[30:57] time to get spiritual things but there's
[30:59] a time to lose spiritual things and
[31:02] that's what we see in the church ages
[31:03] they would begin losing some truce
[31:07] okay I want to maybe look at uh some of
[31:10] these here uh in just a moment
[31:13] now they would begin losing through the
[31:16] first four one two three four the first
[31:18] four ages they would begin losing the
[31:21] truce the power the revelation
[31:24] and part of that of course was due to
[31:26] the Roman Catholic Church destroying all
[31:28] the Bibles or most of the Bibles in the
[31:30] people's language
[31:31] right but restoration will begin in the
[31:34] fifth sixth and seventh you'd have
[31:36] restoration
[31:38] now this is like an unto a corn of wheat
[31:42] let's go to John 12 24 if you have your
[31:44] Bible John 12 24.
[31:52] John 12 24.
[31:57] so this losing and then gaining again is
[32:00] likened unto the death of a seed a death
[32:03] has to be buried it has to rot and then
[32:06] it has to then it brings forth life and
[32:08] so that's what God is showing in the
[32:10] seven Church ages he's showing the life
[32:13] of a seed praise God
[32:16] verse 24 verily verily I say unto you
[32:18] except the corn of wheat fall into the
[32:20] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[32:23] it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[32:26] Hallelujah
[32:27] and that's what we see in the church
[32:29] ages it started off as a great a great
[32:31] strong plant but then it slowly Withers
[32:33] away and it's almost cut off it almost
[32:36] dies completely in the fourth age it's
[32:38] called the Dark Ages the depths of Satan
[32:40] Jesus called it but then it has a little
[32:43] life it Springs forth uh in the last
[32:46] three Ages which uh wheat has three
[32:48] stages right the ear the stalk and the
[32:51] corn amen that's what we see three
[32:53] stages at the end praise God Amen thank
[32:56] God that's what Jesus said Hallelujah in
[32:58] The Book of Mark as well that's what he
[33:00] said it would be like
[33:01] so the church would slowly die and lose
[33:04] truth and grow through the first four
[33:06] ages when the fifth age it would begin a
[33:09] reformation and the seed would spring
[33:11] forth in strength
[33:13] until it would grow back and be restored
[33:16] in truth but then in the final age we
[33:18] would have all things restored According
[33:20] To Jesus how many believe that
[33:22] hallelujah praise God
[33:24] now in the midst of these seven Church
[33:27] ages though
[33:29] Jesus talks to both the workers of
[33:31] iniquity and the workers of
[33:33] righteousness
[33:34] he's talking to both groups and notice
[33:37] both groups are religious so that proves
[33:39] again it's good to go to church but it's
[33:41] better to do what the Bible says when
[33:43] you go to church praise God
[33:45] because if you just go to church and you
[33:47] know what the Bible says the Bible says
[33:49] you're like a wolf in sheep's clothing
[33:51] you look like you're real humble and
[33:53] sweet on the outside but inwardly you're
[33:55] dangerous
[33:56] right you're you're you're out to devour
[33:59] people you're ought to destroy people's
[34:01] lives and and just uh focus on your life
[34:04] and again selfish right because a wolf
[34:05] is a selfish creature right only hunting
[34:07] for themselves and they're not a humble
[34:09] creature like a a sheep would be humble
[34:11] or something like that it's a very
[34:12] violent and aggressive type of an animal
[34:15] well that's what Jesus said they're like
[34:16] wolves and sheep's clothing
[34:20] so those are workers of iniquity but we
[34:22] are to be workers of righteousness
[34:24] Hallelujah
[34:25] amen
[34:27] now I want to take a moment here let me
[34:28] just break off into this here and we'll
[34:30] kind of see how far I go here but let me
[34:32] see I thought I tried to save some of
[34:33] these Pages here
[34:35] I just thought since we had Chris as a
[34:36] visitor here I told him we have this
[34:38] YouTube channel
[34:40] um I just wanted to see some of the
[34:41] here's some of the things the church has
[34:43] lost
[34:45] okay now my most popular or our most
[34:47] popular event I always say are because I
[34:49] couldn't do without all your support our
[34:51] most popular video only has 300 000
[34:53] views but
[34:54] is makeup in the Bible
[34:56] the Bible says makeup is wrong the Bible
[35:00] said makeup is a sin because it's a
[35:02] prideful thing for a woman to put on
[35:04] makeup or a man now today probably just
[35:06] mentioned just as many men put on makeup
[35:08] as women do almost probably it's so sad
[35:10] it's so so it's so sad
[35:12] why would someone need to put on makeup
[35:14] if God gave them a beautiful face why
[35:16] would you why would they need that the
[35:18] Bible says you're already fearfully and
[35:20] wonderfully made but see Satan pressures
[35:22] you oh you're not you're not pretty
[35:23] enough for you've got to look like this
[35:24] movie star
[35:26] no you don't need that because that
[35:28] movie star is not after Christ that
[35:29] movie stars after money
[35:31] right or selfish ambitions but that's so
[35:35] that's kind of what uh uh that's one
[35:37] truth that's been lost and the Bible
[35:39] actually calls that modesty let's look
[35:42] at that let's look at First Timothy
[35:43] chapter two if you got your Bible First
[35:44] Timothy 2.
[35:50] First Timothy 2.
[35:55] verse nine First Timothy 2 verse 9.
[36:09] all right it says in like manner also
[36:12] that women Adorn themselves in modest
[36:13] apparel with shame-facedenness and
[36:16] sobriety not with broided hair or gold
[36:18] or pearls or costly array but which
[36:22] becometh women professing godliness with
[36:24] good works now we'll just stop right
[36:26] there now there's a whole lot in those
[36:27] two verses right there there's a lot in
[36:29] there but again the pressure to spend
[36:32] lots of money to make yourself look so
[36:34] rich or so uh so successful right costly
[36:38] costly necklaces costly Rings costly
[36:41] jewelry right
[36:42] and what the Bible says we have must
[36:44] wear modest clothing
[36:46] right modest and shame-based innocent so
[36:49] not a proud face like look look look or
[36:51] watch my watch my YouTube video and I'll
[36:53] show you how to paint a certain kind of
[36:55] a face and they get millions and
[36:56] millions of views on that that
[36:58] shame faces that's not humility that's
[37:01] Pride that's vanity praise God
[37:03] see they don't obey the word of God now
[37:06] there's three times in the Old Testament
[37:07] where God condemned makeup but we don't
[37:10] have time to read that but you can watch
[37:11] that video brother if you like to Chris
[37:12] by God's grace long hair the Bible says
[37:15] it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair
[37:17] the New Testament says women should not
[37:20] cut their hair and men should not let
[37:22] their hair grow long
[37:24] right women should have long hair men
[37:26] should have short hair that's the Bible
[37:28] God never asked a Godly woman to cut her
[37:31] hair
[37:32] okay so these are the things the church
[37:33] has lost the church has lost this
[37:35] there's books been written about it I
[37:36] wrote a book about it I mean it's been
[37:39] lost but the church is getting it back
[37:41] today hallelujah amen it's restoring
[37:44] Christian modesty Hallelujah
[37:47] that's a pretty good title there
[37:49] no this that one's on kind of understate
[37:51] the Lord this is on cross-dressing
[37:53] the Bible says we should have different
[37:55] garments for men and women but now what
[37:57] do they do they mix it today
[37:59] right
[38:00] and mix it today and now they can change
[38:02] their gender or whatever it's ridiculous
[38:04] it's against the Bible and the Bible
[38:06] calls that an Abomination it's a
[38:08] disgusting thing in the sight of God
[38:11] and and understand we love all these
[38:13] Sinners brother Chris we love all them
[38:14] but we got to preach it hard because
[38:17] that's the truth and their voices are so
[38:19] loud we got to get God's voice out there
[38:21] too right
[38:22] yeah that's right God did that amen God
[38:26] did that why chromosome amen that's
[38:28] right
[38:30] and then there's a video about uh modest
[38:33] clothing the next one is serpent seed in
[38:35] the Garden of Eden
[38:37] Even Adam did not eat an apple there's
[38:40] nothing in the Bible that says they ate
[38:41] apple right they had a sexual adulterous
[38:44] affair
[38:46] Eve had adultery with the serpent
[38:49] because the serpent was a standing up
[38:51] creature in the Bible
[38:52] and It produced a hybrid Offspring named
[38:55] Kane
[38:57] right and God said there's two different
[38:59] offsprings if you read Genesis let's
[39:01] read Genesis 3 15. God said there are
[39:04] two different offsprings in the in in
[39:07] the world
[39:09] now today they're all mixed so now it's
[39:10] not a you're it's not your natural seed
[39:12] line now it's your spiritual seed line
[39:14] Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.
[39:18] this has been lost
[39:21] now some people misuse this Doctrine for
[39:23] racism purposes it's awful
[39:26] it's so awful but the reality of it is
[39:28] is that there was two offsprings in the
[39:31] Garden of Eden there's an offspring of
[39:33] the serpent which was a man like being
[39:35] but then God cursed him on his belly
[39:37] like he is today but then there's also
[39:39] the Godly Offspring Adam and Eve did
[39:41] come together and did have a son right
[39:43] Abel and then he died of course Cain
[39:45] killed him the serpency killed the
[39:46] righteous seed and then but then God
[39:48] raised up Seth
[39:49] right fast forward 20 uh 2500 years
[39:52] they're all intermarried and it doesn't
[39:54] matter who you're born of anymore and
[39:56] neither does it matter today who your
[39:58] mom or who your dad is it matters who
[39:59] your spiritual daddy is amen hallelujah
[40:02] praise God doesn't matter who your mom
[40:03] or dad is it matters do you is God your
[40:05] father and if he is that you'll live the
[40:07] life that he gave you praise God
[40:09] you live the life that he gave you in
[40:11] the word of God you'll you'll have the
[40:12] seed of you receive that the Bible says
[40:14] you receive the seed of God Amen then
[40:16] you're born again by The Incorruptible
[40:18] the Eternal the spiritual seed of God
[40:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:25] so Genesis 3 15 God himself said there's
[40:28] two different offsprings and an apple
[40:30] doesn't produce two offsprings if it
[40:32] does let's do it today right
[40:34] let's show me today where apples can
[40:36] produce two different kinds of families
[40:38] you're not going to find that
[40:40] right
[40:41] and the Bible said another place Cain
[40:43] was not of Adam Cain was of the wicked
[40:45] one
[40:46] his daddy was a wicked person the
[40:48] serpent
[40:51] all right now we got Genesis 3 15.
[40:55] sorry for putting you on the spot there
[40:57] sister who I feel bad now so if I put
[40:59] you on the spot forgive me sorry I kind
[41:01] of felt bad about that so forgive me
[41:04] Lydia forgive me I don't mean to call
[41:05] everybody on the spot tonight here
[41:07] first uh Genesis 3 15. and I will put
[41:10] enmity which means hatred between thee
[41:13] God's talking to the serpent The Serpent
[41:15] and the woman and between the thy seed
[41:17] the serpent seed and her seed that seed
[41:20] means offspring God said I'm going to
[41:22] put hatred between the Serpent's
[41:24] Offspring and I'm sorry the woman Eve's
[41:26] Offspring it shall bruise thy head
[41:30] so God is telling the serpent Jesus
[41:32] Christ the woman seed is going to bruise
[41:35] your head on the cross hallelujah amen
[41:37] take all of his power away hallelujah
[41:39] amen and thou shalt bruise his heel
[41:43] so the serpent the serpent or death
[41:45] would strike Jesus on the cross but he
[41:48] would also crush the curse of death on
[41:50] the cross amen thank God Amen
[41:54] amen so there's two offsprings in the
[41:56] Bible that's a great mystery
[41:59] now jewelry there's a great balance on
[42:01] jewelry that's one that's misunderstood
[42:02] today God never asked anyone to to make
[42:05] themselves bleed to wear jewelry some
[42:07] jewelry is acceptable but anytime you
[42:08] make yourself bleed the Bible said
[42:10] anything that makes you bleed when you
[42:12] cut yourself to make yourself bleed the
[42:14] Bible says that's a demon possession
[42:16] those people are not filled with God's
[42:18] spirit because God will not cause you uh
[42:21] to destroy your own body
[42:23] that's not God's not behind that right
[42:25] in the Bible anybody with demons on them
[42:27] they cut themselves all the time right
[42:28] people do that today
[42:30] right God never asked anyone to do that
[42:32] that's been lost but the church today or
[42:34] the the church is out there not our
[42:36] church the churches out there are filled
[42:38] with people like that
[42:39] because it's been lost
[42:41] oh my thank God that He restored this is
[42:44] making me more happy for restoration
[42:46] than I think I ever have been amen
[42:47] hallelujah you see it Church you see it
[42:51] now the Bible said there was high heels
[42:52] in the Old Testament we actually did a
[42:53] bible study on that a couple weeks ago
[42:55] we're not going to go that but high
[42:56] heels pushes up the woman right pushes
[42:58] up the woman so it pushes up her her
[43:00] body parts makes her more attractive to
[43:02] the man
[43:03] she's more of a object of Temptation
[43:05] okay anybody could see that any man
[43:07] could see that right
[43:08] it's that's a sin that's sin
[43:11] uh now the trinity
[43:12] the Trinity is a lie God is not three
[43:15] persons God's one person
[43:17] it's not even logical how can three
[43:19] people be one person I'll sit by brother
[43:21] amen how could us three be one person
[43:25] it's impossible we're three separate
[43:26] persons right
[43:27] you're not exactly like your husband
[43:29] right sister but amen you're not exactly
[43:31] like your wife right but most churches
[43:33] say today three persons are one God it's
[43:36] nonsense it's not even in the Bible
[43:38] it's a complete lie but that was lost
[43:41] down Through the Ages but today we have
[43:43] the truth restored amen
[43:46] amen and along with that when you be
[43:47] baptized you don't call on the titles of
[43:50] god father son of the Holy Ghost you
[43:51] call on the name of Jesus the Lord Jesus
[43:54] Christ amen that's been lost but today a
[43:57] priest will sprinkle you with water and
[43:58] say you're baptized baptized means to
[44:01] immerse amen the actual word baptism
[44:03] means to immerse you put you underwater
[44:06] it doesn't mean to sprinkle no one was
[44:08] ever sprinkled in the Bible with water
[44:09] they were sprinkled with blood in the
[44:11] Old Testament but now in the New
[44:12] Testament it's not a it's not a
[44:14] sprinkling of water it's an immersion in
[44:16] water
[44:17] that you go completely under the water
[44:19] and we say I baptize you in the name of
[44:21] the Lord Jesus Christ that's the Bible
[44:23] Way praise God
[44:24] it's been lost
[44:27] next the Roman Catholic Church is a
[44:28] mystery the Roman Catholic Church is the
[44:31] most guilty of all churches of sin
[44:34] she sits on Seven Hills she worships
[44:37] statues the priests are pedophiles most
[44:40] of them
[44:42] it's just it's some of the most wicked
[44:43] things so are the nuns so many of the
[44:45] nuns
[44:46] it's just uh I got I got a whole chapter
[44:48] on it I gotta so so Chris if you want to
[44:50] some good reading I got some good
[44:51] reading for you here I don't know if
[44:53] you're a reader or not but
[44:55] hallelujah it's gonna it's gonna help
[44:58] you it's really gonna help you
[44:59] it's really going to help you but I got
[45:01] a whole chapter on this
[45:03] we again we love Roman Catholics but
[45:05] we're calling them to come out of that
[45:06] because that's what Jesus said come out
[45:08] of her my people
[45:09] that's that's where our voice is to call
[45:11] them out because if not you are potato
[45:14] our partaker in their wickedness
[45:16] and their sins and iniquities
[45:19] okay the Rapture is a great mystery I'm
[45:20] not going to look into that one here's a
[45:21] good one uh Chris you might like most
[45:23] churches say hell lasts eternally
[45:27] but that's wrong hell is not Eternal
[45:29] according to the Bible
[45:31] God's not going to torment people
[45:33] without end how could God torment people
[45:36] for millions of years when they only
[45:37] sinned for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or
[45:40] 70. what kind of God would do that
[45:43] you wouldn't do that right if so if if
[45:46] one of your loved ones robbed a bank or
[45:48] killed somebody or something like that
[45:50] you don't want them in jail rotting away
[45:51] their whole life
[45:52] you want them to have mercy you want to
[45:54] end at some point
[45:56] what kind of person who wanted to be God
[45:58] would never do that
[45:59] and the Bible makes it clear amen let's
[46:01] read it amen it's first John
[46:03] no murder has eternal life hallelujah
[46:06] amen
[46:10] First John 3 15. first John it's in the
[46:13] back of the Bible
[46:19] it's just it's just such a contradiction
[46:21] the same people that say he's the god of
[46:22] love he's got to love he's got gotta
[46:24] love yet if you disobey him you got to
[46:25] burn eternally
[46:27] that's not love
[46:28] that's not love
[46:36] yeah debunk what do you mean by debunk
[46:38] can you explain that
[46:51] yes yes they haven't uh spent enough
[46:54] time in prayer seeking God because Jesus
[46:56] said if you ask and seek you will find
[46:58] it
[46:59] they're not spending enough time seeking
[47:01] the word of God see they get distracted
[47:03] by Sports they get distracted by movies
[47:05] they get distracted by careers
[47:07] instead of Jesus said if you want to
[47:09] find the truth he said you've got to
[47:10] search for it like gold now I've never
[47:12] sought gold right
[47:14] I've never been there but you read about
[47:16] it and they would just dig dig dig until
[47:18] they Struck it that's how a Christian is
[47:20] we dig dig till we strike it amen did we
[47:24] find something real praise God
[47:26] because they're trained like in a school
[47:27] rather they're training to school and
[47:28] then they just go out and do what
[47:29] everybody else does but how do they know
[47:31] the school is right
[47:33] did Jesus set up that school no
[47:36] so yeah that's a great question brother
[47:37] great question
[47:39] so it's not Eternal so let's read that
[47:40] first John brother also you want to read
[47:41] that brother First John 3 15.
[47:48] well I'm sorry it's wrong first First
[47:49] John 3 15. I'm sorry was that John 3 15.
[47:52] first John
[47:54] oh I'm sorry yeah you're good whosoever
[47:56] hated his brother is a murderer and
[47:59] you know Murder huh
[48:01] eternal life abiding you amen thank you
[48:03] sir
[48:04] anyone who goes to hell is a murderer
[48:06] does not have eternal life so they
[48:08] cannot live eternally
[48:10] that is just simple logic it's
[48:12] completely uh common sense you cannot
[48:15] live eternally unless you have eternal
[48:17] life you cannot have eternal life unless
[48:19] you have Jesus Christ praise God
[48:21] amen
[48:23] so we see it's a great revelation
[48:26] another one is there's no women
[48:28] preachers in the Bible
[48:30] so that's an important Revelation there
[48:32] as well so I may
[48:34] I may just because maybe do about 20
[48:37] more minutes here by God's grace yeah
[48:39] thank you sir let me pull up this one
[48:42] too I want to show another one here this
[48:43] would be a great one for Chris and good
[48:45] reminder for us all I found in these
[48:47] last few years of you know debating and
[48:49] and interacting with people that uh
[48:53] uh disbelieve the word of God or they
[48:55] get a lot of mix-up is they don't
[48:57] understand that man has three parts
[49:00] okay every every person every human
[49:02] being has three parts okay so if you can
[49:04] catch us tonight Chris you've caught a
[49:06] good you've caught a good thing okay
[49:08] each one of us has three parts let's
[49:09] read uh first Thessalonians 5 23.
[49:14] what was your other friend brother
[49:15] Austin that came over on the remember we
[49:17] witnessed to him Sam Sam this is what
[49:21] helped Brother Sam
[49:23] no we'll keep praying for him
[49:25] but this scripture really helped him
[49:27] first Thessalonians
[49:31] 5 23 Lydia you got that on can you read
[49:34] that thank you
[49:38] congratulations
[49:44] amen so Jesus wants to preserve all
[49:47] these blameless Jesus wants to make you
[49:49] uh forgiven in every area your body
[49:53] your spirit or mind and your soul this
[49:57] is such a crucial thing to understand
[50:00] okay so God's spirit can fall on all
[50:02] three parts
[50:04] but then God's spirit can leave two of
[50:06] those parts one of them it never leaves
[50:09] okay and this is why it's so so
[50:12] confusing people can live good for a
[50:15] certain amount of years and then totally
[50:16] turn away and be and live like a devil
[50:18] that's because the spirit of God never
[50:20] got into the deepest part of their being
[50:23] they didn't let God all the way into
[50:25] their life they kept some of the areas
[50:27] of their life from God they didn't want
[50:29] God to get into those eras usually it's
[50:31] money
[50:32] right or relationships right a husband
[50:34] or a wife or a second husband or second
[50:36] third husband third wife something like
[50:37] that
[50:38] something that's selfish like that
[50:40] see they get the Holy Spirit on their
[50:42] body they feel they'll cry they'll speak
[50:44] in tongues they'll shout they'll screen
[50:45] their prophesy they'll dance around the
[50:48] church or something like that but then
[50:49] that spirit is going to leave
[50:51] and if they don't have God's word in
[50:53] their mind then their mind is going to
[50:54] go back to the things of the world
[50:56] but some people can get it in their mind
[50:58] and know a little bit about God like
[51:00] you're talking about and but they'll
[51:02] warn you and say if you don't get saved
[51:03] you're going to burn eternally well
[51:04] that's because they never really got
[51:06] down God never got deep and down enough
[51:08] into their soul to show them that that's
[51:10] not God's nature praise God
[51:12] 's not going to destroy people for
[51:14] Eternal eternity God's not going to let
[51:16] them suffer eternally
[51:17] okay but see God's got to get deeper
[51:19] down and and the more you open up
[51:21] yourself to God the more God can show
[51:24] himself in your life and then what Jesus
[51:26] called it when you let God in all the
[51:29] way Jesus called it the baptism of the
[51:31] Holy Spirit In other words God's spirit
[51:32] comes in there and fills up your soul
[51:34] praise God
[51:36] that's what Jesus said amen your soul is
[51:38] immersed in the spirit of God hallelujah
[51:41] that's exactly what the word of God says
[51:43] amen
[51:45] now murderers they can have God's spirit
[51:47] out here they can feel good they can
[51:48] live clean but then they can this
[51:50] anointing will leave and they'll go out
[51:51] and murder right
[51:54] now if they repent of that then they can
[51:56] be saved they can still be saved because
[51:58] they've accepted God in their minds but
[52:00] they've got to let God clean them out
[52:02] totally clean out their minds totally
[52:04] and then God will come into their soul
[52:06] so God's trying to work from the outside
[52:08] in right God's trying to clean out clean
[52:10] out your actions your mind and then God
[52:13] wants to live in your soul praise God
[52:15] Hallelujah
[52:18] that's right that's exactly what Jesus
[52:20] says he says your soul must be baptized
[52:22] with the Holy Ghost right
[52:24] amen that's a great Revelation right
[52:26] there it's a great mystery people don't
[52:28] understand
[52:36] if they repent
[52:38] yeah if they repent now that means like
[52:40] repent means to three things repent
[52:42] means uh to make amends for your sin so
[52:45] if you can do some if you can right or
[52:47] wrong you did that's one of the things
[52:49] hate your sin is the second one and the
[52:51] third thing is change your mind about
[52:53] your sin
[52:54] so repentance actually has three parts
[52:56] to it so if somebody who is the worst of
[52:58] the worst could actually do all those
[53:01] three things yes they could be saved
[53:04] okay that's a great question Chris great
[53:06] great question
[53:08] Hallelujah
[53:09] all right how am I doing here okay doing
[53:11] good by God's grace okay
[53:14] so we can see these are a lot of the
[53:16] truths that were lost
[53:18] here down through the down Through the
[53:20] Ages the church lost and that's why
[53:21] churches today lack so much they haven't
[53:24] received the restoration of the word of
[53:26] God
[53:27] everything I've showed you is in the
[53:29] Bible but they don't believe it yet they
[53:32] carry Bibles to church like you do they
[53:34] sit in here preaching like you do but
[53:36] they don't believe the whole book but
[53:37] we're Believers of the whole book amen
[53:40] all of it praise God
[53:42] like I was telling my brother I was
[53:43] talking to a preacher on the way to
[53:44] church or on the way from home for work
[53:46] I was saying
[53:48] I said I'm not afraid of any question I
[53:49] don't have the answer to every question
[53:51] but I'm not afraid if I've got the truth
[53:52] I'm not afraid to show the truth
[53:55] aren't afraid of a question right
[53:58] if I've got the truth if I've got gold
[54:00] I'm not afraid to put that gold in the
[54:02] fire Amen Let It Burn praise God because
[54:04] it's going to come out more gold because
[54:06] it's actually going to come out with
[54:07] more Purity amen get more of the drops
[54:10] out praise God so the more we answer
[54:12] questions by the Bible the more truth we
[54:16] actually gain we can't run from
[54:17] questions we have to accept them we have
[54:19] to let the spirit of God guide us into
[54:21] more truth praise God
[54:23] amen
[54:27] now here's a great problem the Bible
[54:29] says uh what what the problem with some
[54:31] people that come to church they try to
[54:33] come to Christ but they don't depart
[54:35] from iniquity so let's look at that one
[54:37] here
[54:38] he that nameth the name of Christ depart
[54:40] from iniquity that's second Timothy 2
[54:42] 19.
[54:45] I just thought I'd show this people can
[54:46] get a good start serving Jesus but if if
[54:49] they don't keep the spirit of God coming
[54:51] in deeper and deeper if they don't let
[54:52] more of God in then they'll start
[54:54] picking up bad habits again like I said
[54:57] like sexual sins or drug addictions
[55:00] okay any Pleasures any lusts of the
[55:03] world they'll let that in and they won't
[55:05] let God clean out their lives so God
[55:07] can't come in because they keep their
[55:08] life so dirty and filthy
[55:10] all right that's quite plain to say that
[55:12] but that's about as plain as I know how
[55:14] to say it
[55:17] II Timothy 2 19. nevertheless the
[55:20] foundation of God's standeth Shore
[55:22] having this seal
[55:25] the Lord knoweth them that are his in
[55:28] other words God knows the real believer
[55:30] aren't you glad he knows your church all
[55:32] right so God he knows your name he knows
[55:33] your address praise God
[55:35] he knows your desires Hallelujah he
[55:37] knows everything you need amen
[55:40] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[55:42] Christ depart from iniquity
[55:46] okay iniquity is purposeful sinning
[55:48] right
[55:49] lawlessness well I can just do whatever
[55:51] I want Jesus Loves Me I can sin enjoy
[55:53] all the sins I want no you can't
[55:55] you're not letting the spirit of God
[55:56] into your being you're actually pushing
[55:58] him out when you sin
[56:00] right the Bible says every time it's we
[56:03] sin it's a spirit of Disobedience every
[56:05] time we sin we're letting the devil's
[56:06] thoughts in so we got to kick those
[56:08] thoughts out we got to let God thoughts
[56:10] in praise God
[56:11] Hallelujah
[56:15] a lot of different ways we could go but
[56:17] I hope you can see it by God's grace we
[56:19] can see how the truth or the churches
[56:21] today not ours but churches today are
[56:24] not accepting the restoration preached
[56:26] from the Bible
[56:28] Hallelujah but God said this was the
[56:31] time he was going to restore it at the
[56:33] time when knowledge is increased oh my
[56:36] Hallelujah when they can stick a wire up
[56:38] Jose's arteries and clear out his his
[56:41] stroke and his heart attack they can
[56:43] stick a wire up there and do the work a
[56:45] wire in the veins now if that's not
[56:47] knowledge increased I don't know what it
[56:48] is
[56:49] how do you do that how in the world can
[56:51] you do that knowledge has increased
[56:54] and so that's what we that's where we
[56:56] live in that we're living in this time
[56:57] here now let me bring this down in a
[56:58] place to close here it's almost 8 30
[57:00] here by God's grace
[57:03] okay so God said
[57:05] let me get back to another picture here
[57:07] we'll close with that thought
[57:11] oh just so you know Chris here this God
[57:14] in the beginning
[57:16] God wants us to cover from our shoulders
[57:18] down to our shins just you know that's
[57:20] in the Bible I can show you but see most
[57:22] people walk around today like this in
[57:24] the summertime right
[57:28] so it's in the Bible it's all it's all
[57:30] through there but the church has lost
[57:32] that I can go to church with sexy
[57:34] clothes on or no clothes on or whatever
[57:36] uh
[57:37] it's it's sin it's sin it's a
[57:40] Disobedience to the word of God
[57:42] okay so let me close with this thought
[57:43] here
[57:45] hopefully that loads we're heaven a
[57:47] little slow loading there
[57:50] okay so the church was like a seed I'll
[57:52] just close with that one it was a seed
[57:54] it had to go down to the ground and die
[57:56] but then it would bring forth in a
[57:58] restoration
[58:00] praise God
[58:02] so it started off with a lot of
[58:03] Believers all on fire but then slowly
[58:06] the truth and the number got smaller
[58:08] smaller smaller and then we had a little
[58:09] bit of Revival in the 1500s through
[58:12] Martin Luther John Wesley's age was was
[58:15] the most in these last three ages that
[58:17] was the age of the open door Jesus said
[58:19] missionary work
[58:21] but now I guess we're going upward I
[58:23] really don't know what that means I
[58:24] don't know what is that what does that
[58:26] line mean I don't know maybe we're going
[58:27] up I don't know
[58:29] somebody knows tell me praise God I must
[58:30] have missed it when I was listening to
[58:31] the sermons I missed that part see it
[58:34] goes up down upside I'm not sure I'm not
[58:36] sure that must be the restoration
[58:39] I don't really know
[58:41] all right
[58:43] but it's spoken to every Church age it's
[58:46] spoken to everyone
[58:47] and so there's a there's a a a fullness
[58:51] of the power in the word losing it
[58:54] gaining a little bit and then at the end
[58:56] we get the restoration back to the
[58:58] beginning Hallelujah
[59:00] all right now uh by the grace of God
[59:03] help me Jesus
[59:04] Hallelujah
[59:07] I'll think about a scripture I could
[59:08] close with here let's go to I just feel
[59:10] like I close with this one John 3 this
[59:11] one came to my mind John 3 16. we'll
[59:13] close with this one I'm sure Chris has
[59:15] maybe heard have you heard John 3 16
[59:16] Chris
[59:17] for God so loved the world that he gave
[59:19] his only begotten son
[59:21] okay well it's great brother that's
[59:22] great perfect Matthew Mark Luke John
[59:24] it's the fourth book in the New
[59:25] Testament
[59:32] I've covered a lot of topics but I did
[59:33] that on purpose you know I kind of I
[59:35] felt it's been nice these last few
[59:37] months we've had a number of visitors
[59:38] right it's been really wonderful
[59:40] and uh I'm so thankful for that by God's
[59:42] grace John 3 16 and so uh like when
[59:46] Janine came or yeah Jeannie came
[59:50] um you know God really spoke to her
[59:51] there but uh you know I just want to
[59:53] share the truth with them so they can
[59:55] hear it praise God by God's grace just
[59:56] try to summarize it the best we can and
[59:58] thank you for your patience I know a lot
[59:59] of this is reviewed to us but I hope
[1:00:01] it's a good review by God's grace hope
[1:00:02] you enjoyed the review I always love
[1:00:04] reviewing the church ages amen
[1:00:06] hallelujah thank you God is so faithful
[1:00:08] praise God
[1:00:10] I'm so thankful how God leads us amen he
[1:00:12] just gives us right what we need at the
[1:00:13] right time John 3 16.
[1:00:16] this is probably Chris the most popular
[1:00:18] verse in the Bible actually because it
[1:00:21] summarizes what God did to save sinful
[1:00:23] lost people like us it's so beautiful
[1:00:26] this is such a beautiful beautiful
[1:00:27] scripture
[1:00:29] for God so loved the world
[1:00:32] that he gave his only begotten son he
[1:00:34] had nothing greater to give than his son
[1:00:36] Jesus
[1:00:38] that whosoever believeth in him
[1:00:41] should not perish
[1:00:43] but have everlasting life
[1:00:46] so God promises if you believe in my son
[1:00:48] that he is the Son of God and that he
[1:00:51] died for your sins and he rose to
[1:00:53] forgive you and fill you with power
[1:00:55] right that power we said he wants to get
[1:00:57] from the outside work his way in he said
[1:00:59] if you believe that he said I'll give
[1:01:02] you everlasting life praise God oh it's
[1:01:04] a beautiful beautiful trade praise God
[1:01:06] how could a person turn that down in
[1:01:08] their sound mind
[1:01:10] God sent his son to die for you he took
[1:01:13] your sin to give you his righteousness
[1:01:15] the Divine exchange praise God
[1:01:18] it's the most beautiful
[1:01:20] message there ever was in the face of
[1:01:22] the Earth praise God
[1:01:23] God so loved us he said his son he
[1:01:26] placed all his sin on Jesus all the sin
[1:01:29] of the entire world history was on Jesus
[1:01:31] he was beaten like no man could ever be
[1:01:33] beaten he didn't even look like a man in
[1:01:35] the face that's how bad he was beaten
[1:01:38] and he paid he was the lamb he was the
[1:01:40] sacrifice that died for us and then
[1:01:43] because all sin was placed upon him now
[1:01:46] God can put forgiveness and
[1:01:47] righteousness on all the Believers who
[1:01:50] trust in the sacrifice amen we're not
[1:01:52] getting to Heaven by our goodness praise
[1:01:54] God we're getting to Heaven by his
[1:01:55] righteousness praise God
[1:01:57] by our sacrifice he paid for our sins
[1:01:59] and so because of that like we're I'm
[1:02:02] preaching today because of that because
[1:02:03] of his sacrifice I want to obey all his
[1:02:05] Commandments
[1:02:07] how could I turn down such matches love
[1:02:09] how could I be a part of his kingdom if
[1:02:11] I don't listen to the king praise God
[1:02:13] I've got to listen to the king because
[1:02:15] the king died for me amen the king Rose
[1:02:18] for me praise God the king said his
[1:02:19] Spirit here to to work in me praise God
[1:02:22] and to prove that he's alive he's
[1:02:23] getting our people ready for our Rapture
[1:02:25] Hallelujah
[1:02:26] a Rapture means a snatching away God
[1:02:28] Jesus is going to snatch away his bride
[1:02:30] right before all the destruction comes
[1:02:33] upon the Earth Armageddon different
[1:02:34] things like that the the Great
[1:02:36] Tribulation
[1:02:44] yes sir yes sir that's exactly right
[1:02:46] fire and burnstone that's exactly right
[1:02:49] yes sir because that because you're
[1:02:51] right because the same conditions in
[1:02:53] Sodom are the same today
[1:02:55] they're just going to get more worse to
[1:02:56] be like that in Sodom Chris I don't know
[1:02:58] if you did you ever read Sodom in the
[1:02:59] Book of Genesis
[1:03:04] yes great great well if you get a chance
[1:03:07] it's Revelation I'm sorry Genesis
[1:03:09] Chapter 18 and 19. it was so bad
[1:03:12] men were in gangs going all over the
[1:03:15] city bus trying to bust into houses
[1:03:18] to have sodomy like that's I have kids
[1:03:20] here so that's that's all I can say
[1:03:22] and they even wanted Angels the Angels
[1:03:24] God sent Angels there and he put He put
[1:03:26] Flesh on them they were even going to
[1:03:27] come after the Angels but the angel
[1:03:29] struck them blind
[1:03:30] because God gave him power to protect
[1:03:32] themselves
[1:03:33] that that's how awful it was
[1:03:36] and and the the cops or the police that
[1:03:38] day let it roam
[1:03:39] and look at today how they want to
[1:03:41] defund the cops
[1:03:42] insanity
[1:03:44] so it's just it's becoming more and some
[1:03:45] of those cities are just like Sodom
[1:03:48] look at Chicago I mean they kill them
[1:03:49] they're all these deaths it's just it's
[1:03:51] just like Sodom and Gomorrah Detroit
[1:03:53] yeah yes you're very well versed on that
[1:03:56] you can see the Sodom conditions of
[1:03:58] today very good very good that's exactly
[1:04:00] what Jesus said Jesus actually said that
[1:04:02] in Luke 17. Jesus said as it was in the
[1:04:04] days of lot which was Sodom so shall it
[1:04:06] be in the days of the coming of the son
[1:04:07] of man
[1:04:08] you got some good got some good thoughts
[1:04:10] there brother very good thoughts very
[1:04:11] scriptural thoughts
[1:04:13] let's finish with this here
[1:04:16] Hallelujah verse 17 for God sent not his
[1:04:18] son into the world to condemn The World
[1:04:20] God didn't want to condemn the world he
[1:04:23] wanted them to be saved but most of them
[1:04:24] will turn down the truth
[1:04:27] Verse 18 He that believeth on him is not
[1:04:30] condemned see once we believe in Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ we're no longer condemned
[1:04:35] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:04:37] already see they they spend their lives
[1:04:40] living in condemnation because they
[1:04:41] won't accept Jesus Christ Well church
[1:04:43] that means we don't live in condemnation
[1:04:45] so why why do we let the devil sometimes
[1:04:47] make us live in condemnation let's live
[1:04:49] in forgiveness praise God
[1:04:51] let's live in Victory Hallelujah
[1:04:54] let's live with overcoming power praise
[1:04:56] God
[1:04:57] I'm not condemned I'm forgiven praise
[1:04:59] God
[1:05:01] amen hallelujah
[1:05:02] and yes I'm going to sin every day I'm
[1:05:04] trapped in this body
[1:05:06] right but I asked Jesus every day
[1:05:08] forgive me Father
[1:05:09] forgive me Lord God forgive me
[1:05:12] try me again
[1:05:14] verse 18. he that believe let's do the
[1:05:16] second half but he that believeth not is
[1:05:18] condemned already because he hath not
[1:05:19] believed in the name of the only
[1:05:21] begotten Son of God there's power in the
[1:05:23] name of Jesus but also I think he's
[1:05:24] trying to brother Chris trying to find a
[1:05:26] key up and get to John there
[1:05:28] that's John 3 18.
[1:05:35] yeah sorry about that brother John John
[1:05:36] chapter 3.
[1:05:47] Hallelujah
[1:05:53] don't you love that the Turning of the
[1:05:54] pages of the scriptures praise God
[1:05:58] Hallelujah
[1:05:59] yes sir thank you brother
[1:06:01] now Jesus said these are remember these
[1:06:03] are red letter words I don't know if
[1:06:04] your Bible has red letter words does it
[1:06:06] oh it does beautiful praise God you got
[1:06:08] a good Bible there King James got a King
[1:06:10] James red letter Edition
[1:06:12] Hallelujah
[1:06:13] now we just read how God did not send
[1:06:16] Jesus to condemn the world
[1:06:18] but very few people are actually going
[1:06:20] to believe on him so he has to condemn
[1:06:21] them because they won't accept
[1:06:23] forgiveness they won't accept the Holy
[1:06:25] Spirit
[1:06:26] verse 19.
[1:06:27] and this is the condemnation According
[1:06:30] To Jesus that light is coming to the
[1:06:32] world and Men love what they loved
[1:06:35] Darkness rather than light
[1:06:39] because their deeds were evil so this is
[1:06:42] why God is going to condemn most of the
[1:06:43] world because God has sent light but
[1:06:45] they'd rather live in the darkness
[1:06:47] they'd rather turn off the lights and
[1:06:49] say I don't want to believe God's word I
[1:06:50] just want to live in the dark I just
[1:06:52] want to live in sin
[1:06:54] and that's why God is going to condemn
[1:06:56] sinners
[1:06:57] because they won't let the light in
[1:06:59] praise God
[1:07:02] verse 20 for everyone that doeth evil
[1:07:04] hateth the light
[1:07:06] neither cometh to the light so these are
[1:07:09] these people hate the Bible they hate
[1:07:11] God they hate the truth when you tell
[1:07:14] them the truth they want to shut you
[1:07:15] down on social media
[1:07:17] they want to ban you right they want to
[1:07:19] they want to buy them they want to bomb
[1:07:21] you right they literally want to kill
[1:07:22] you we beat you up hurt you run you over
[1:07:25] with a car because they hate the light
[1:07:27] they hate the truth
[1:07:29] their lives are led by hatred but our
[1:07:31] lives are led by the love of God Amen
[1:07:34] Hallelujah that's why we pray for them
[1:07:36] yes we want Justice done on this Earth
[1:07:38] of course but we pray for them that
[1:07:39] they'll repent of their most wicked
[1:07:41] Deeds
[1:07:44] let's finish verse 20. but everyone that
[1:07:46] cometh I'm sorry but everyone that doeth
[1:07:48] evil hates the light neither cometh to
[1:07:50] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:07:52] see they don't want to be corrected they
[1:07:53] want to keep living in sexual sin they
[1:07:55] want to keep living uh with greed and
[1:07:58] and bitterness and and fear and hatred
[1:08:01] they want to keep living with sin they
[1:08:03] don't want to come to the light so
[1:08:04] that's why God must condemn them God's
[1:08:07] offering them light but they turn down
[1:08:08] light and they want Darkness
[1:08:10] verse 21 but he that doeth truth comes
[1:08:14] to the light oh May Our Lives be lives
[1:08:16] of Truth praise God what kind of Life do
[1:08:19] you live do you live a life of a lie
[1:08:20] church we should live the lives of Truth
[1:08:22] amen

[1:08:26] workers true husbands and wives and
[1:08:28] children and teenagers we should be true

[1:08:32] say that's a real person that's a real
[1:08:34] example of a Christian praise God
[1:08:36] Hallelujah
[1:08:38] he that doeth truth cometh to the light
[1:08:42] the revelation of Jesus Christ that his
[1:08:44] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[1:08:47] wrought in God and the church said let's
