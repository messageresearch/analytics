bit of teaching lately so I'm going to just try to preach a little bit tonight by God's grace had a thought I was listening to a preacher and he was quoting this quote from brother Brandon I'm like I need to I want to preach on that by God's grace so I'm going to preach on Mighty Men again this is part eight uh mighty men yesterday today and forever I want to preach on that tonight by the grace of the Lord praise God Hallelujah yes sir yes part eight Mighty Men yesterday today and forever yeah a little inspiration I caught a few months ago God's grace God's always had him and he's always going to have him Hallelujah so Revelation chapter 20 would like to start there of course we're seeing here Mighty Men in the Millennium Revelation chapter 20. Hallelujah so we'll go down to verse four now in verse verses one through three Satan is bound up and put into the uh the pit the bottomless pit for a thousand years imagine living with no devil for a thousand years hallelujah we're going to have it one day by God's grace Hallelujah I'm enjoy every single day of that Hallelujah no accusations no Temptations A Thousand Years without attempt to praise God verse 4. it's a long verse um so I'll just read it myself here well I'm sorry let's read it all together we might as well just read this one in verse why have you be seated here as a with the word of prayer but let's begin on three one two three and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years praise God notice they lived and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years these are not just average people these are Overcomers and they get to rule the Earth for a thousand years praise God how many want to be one of those by God's grace that's my prayer tonight let's have a word of prayer if you ever need on your heart again or unspoken just make it known unto God God so faithful to answer our prayers we're so thankful God is so good he's so gracious so loving Heavenly Father we thank you Lord again for tonight thank you Lord that you promised us you go to prepare a place for us Lord so that where you would be we would be there also Lord God you thought of us Lord above all else that we've seen that song Above All Else he thought of me above all dear God thank you for thinking of us above yourself dear God lord Jesus you look past your flesh you look past all the pain of the Cross and being forsaken by God you look past that and you saw us Lord God thank you for your grace Lord the scripture says you you looked at the joy that was set before you the joy of future Fellowship the joy of heaven and here we see the joy of the Millennium so God help us here tonight father God lord I believe this thought was placed on my heart for a purpose so Lord help me to just lay aside Lord my My Flesh my own thoughts may just speak to your people here tonight Lord just want to be a help and father pray you strengthen them here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God Hallelujah we'll just take a little thought here by the grace of the Lord and we'll look at Mighty Men now we've gone through seven Parts this will be part eight and I hope uh hope you're feeling mighty by God's grace Hallelujah as Paul said the gospel Works in me mightily praise God and that's what we see you know I I can honestly look it back in my life and I can see God has been working through me mightily because God has been forgiving my sins he's been strengthening me he's been keeping me on the right path I mean what more could I ask Church than that that Jesus Christ forgive me love me answer some of my prayers not all of them but he answered some of them and he keeps me on the right path praise God that's God working in me mightily just like he's working in you praise God of course we know he wants to work in all of us here tonight so I have some slides to show hunt if you want to I just have some quotes I have some scriptures and quotes I'd like to share here tonight just to kind of we're going to start with a little review here but then we'll move into of course those are David's three mighty men that broke through the miles and miles of Canaanites in order to get David to drink and the Bible called them Mighty Men praise God and uh David's least command was or at least desire was their command praise God that's what it is for us too the Bible's least command is our is our pleasure to do praise God we love how many love to live by the word of God how many love open him if you're open up your Bible and just say praise the Lord I'll do that amen I'll obey that promise of God oh it's a great blessing praise God to be a a real Christian today you know I just started I finished Jeremiah yesterday and I started Isaiah today and I was just blown away by uh the things God was saying to Isaiah to tell the people he said I don't even want I don't even want your animal sacrifices he said they become a stench in my nostrils I don't want to see them I don't want I don't want your new moons I don't want your Sabbath I don't want your Feasts he said because the land is filled with iniquity and I thought wow what a what a striking thought like God they were they were actively worshiping God actively singing actively praying and God said I don't want any of it until you get your lives cleaned up what a lesson for us may God help us to always have our lives cleaned out praise God so if there's anything tonight you need to be cleaned out let's get it cleaned out by God's grace it's your night tonight it's my night tonight it's all of our nights to worship God in spirit and in truth praise God Hallelujah just a blessing that God can strengthen us now we want to be we've seen these Mighty Men down through the the scriptures we looked at Mighty Men the Old Testament uh mighty men and women in the New Testament right sisters and the sister said looked at some mighty women in the Bible praise God a few of them Hallelujah like a like Priscilla right she was a mighty a mighty woman in the scripture praise God and all those different ones down through the Bible Hallelujah of course God has Mighty Men that's what the Bible use that terminology Mighty Men but we know God uses sisters mightily just the same praise God they have gifts to the Holy Spirit everything they can do except preach praise God they can do everything a man can do they can cast out Devils they can prophesy they can speak in tongues they can interpret they can do everything except they can't preach praise God but God says they can do everything except that because of what Eve done praise God but I love how Jesus uh the first one he shows after his resurrection was not Peter it was Mary Magdalene praise God Amen a sister that he cast Seven Devils out of amen and he showed himself a lie first to a woman praise God because she was there she would come back praise God she wasn't afraid she come back to worship praise God she come back to show God respect amen and God will respect any of you praise God God expect respect any of us if we respect him praise God and we love him and serve him and worship him with all of our hearts and soul and I got the wrong text there but uh let's look at Mighty Men forever now this is of course a millennium text here this is our scripture we read for tonight this is a millennium text in this in this in this scenario Thrones are set up not just one throne no doubt Jesus has a throne in the Jewish temple we call it the millennial Temple no doubt Jesus has a throne the millennial Temple but somewhere there as well there are other Thrones set up for other leaders praise God and judgment is given to them in other words they get to judge the people that are on the earth because the Bible said during the Thousand Years there will be children though the wolf will Lie by the lamb praise God uh the Bible said a child may die a hundred years old so it looks like there will be death there looks like there uh there could be we know we were not sure we'll find out when we get there by God the main thing is let's get there that's the main thing let's make sure we get to the Millennium praise God hallelujah how do we do that like the Bible said we need to give our lives for Christ whether through martyrdom which probably won't be us but could be uh but also re failing or or rejecting the worship of the Beast rejecting the mother Harlot rejecting rejecting the denominational systems praise God and don't let let's not be as immature to say where there's no denominations around the message of course there's the nominations around the message that's why you get the false doctrines that's why you get tape worshipers that's why you get brother Branham worshipers that's why you get a polygamy that's why you get racism that's why you get uh Liars that's why you get all these people predicting things and that fails see that's they become a denomination they they've uh they've rallied around their idea rather than taking the word of God denominations start easily praise God but a real Church uh can battle and overcome it because the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against the revelation of God hallelujah so denominations are very simply history teaches us that and no domination will ever have a Revival praise God but you and I could have daily Revival hallelujah thank God so we must reject the worship of a denominational spirit uh also we must reject the image of the Beast which brother Brad says is the World Council of churches he said and we must not receive the mark in their foreheads which is doing the will of the denominational system or taking the denominational systems Doctrine that's what program says one or the other he says or in their hands he said that's doing the will of the denominational system so not preaching against the mother heart I'm not preaching against the daughters right doing the will of them and if we do that church what a blessing if we do that the Bible says we will live and reign with Christ for a thousand years what a promise hallelujah what a promise now that word in the Greek uh rain means to be king to exercise kingly power to exercise the highest influence to control so all these things things think of think of Peter and Stephen who stoned to death Peter was crucified upside down because they stood for the truth and gave this ultimate sacrifice they were despised on this Earth they were ridiculed they were mocked on this Earth they were rejected on this Earth but in the next Earth God makes them Kings Hallelujah may God help us to get through whatever trials we're going through amen may God help us to deal with the pain to deal with the suffering amen how they need to deal with the trials may God help us to just deal with it keep the testimony of Christ because God has something greater waiting for you praise God Amen oh my God we don't have to be popular here we're going to be rejected here praise God we're going to be cast aside here praise God but we won't be cast aside there we'll be accepted there amen amen hallelujah you stand for Jesus Jesus will stand for you praise God if you can control himself like this if you can control your bodily passions here he'll give you control over the world later Hallelujah if you can control your thought life here he'll make you a ruler over there later amen we've got to keep it under control praise God we got to keep we got to keep this sin nature inside we've got to keep it under control we've got to cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God church sometimes you know we forget we are walking around and we're supposed to have armor on Amen hallelujah we're supposed to wake up in the morning and get sharper in your sword praise God see we're supposed to wake up and that we forget we're walking around like soldiers around here that's how we're supposed to walk with the full armor of God on not just one Peace church we need to put on the whole armor of God hallelujah we're soldiers here we're soldiers here he makes us rulers over there praise God like I told you before we can just overcome our simple humble little battles in life can I say like that amen our humble little insignificant bows if we can just overcome them with a loving testimony that we love Jesus we love our enemies we love the family we love church we love everybody if we can just overcome with that he has great things in store for us he'll make us Kings and Priests unto God he'll give us Thrones the Bible says what awesome Rewards for what seems like such a small sacrifice but how many know he's worthy of all sacrifices Hallelujah the next verse says the rest of the Dead live not again so anyone that wasn't able to overcome like this group in verse 4. they do not live again until the thousand years are finished they they miss the first resurrection but blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years look at the church priests there's going to be priests in the millennium see what seemed like we would you know if there's going to be priests who what do they they intercede for people it would seem the nations of the world may have some deaths now that just seemed to just come to me right now I actually been thinking about that but the Bible said a child will die a hundred years old but God is going to need priests in the Millennium he's going to need people to reign with him praise God oh my church that's one trumpet I'm listening for not the seven trumpets I'm listening for the last trumpet praise God hallelujah that's what we should live our lives listening for the trumpet is this the day the trumpet sounds is this going to be the day Jesus calls me home praise God that's what we should be listening for praise God living our lives uh we're blessed by his holy spirit we should live holy in his presence praise God we should be living to partake of the first resurrection oh my Hallelujah how do we do that well we got to be priests here we got a Reign here praise God you know I was telling brother Austin you know when he sent out that request about his grandma I couldn't pray for it right away but later on that evening when I had some quiet time I just knelt there on my knees I started praying for your grandma brother just a simple humble prayer that's why I'm so blessed to see it answered praise God then we prayed for it Sunday we wept and cried for your grandma on Sunday we wept tears pleading with God and God turns around he changes the whole uh the the the whole doctor's diagnosis praise God Amen at least 10 months now we'll see as at least 10 months maybe more to our life praise God because the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman prevails much in the sight of God Amen amen hallelujah I'll be honest you know sometimes we don't especially feel like praying but it's your job anyway because you're a priest in other words nobody else is going to do it so you got to do it praise God that's right your flesh don't be like it we'll bring your flesh into subjection to the spirit of God that's inside of your soul praise God hallelujah don't let your flesh rule over your soul make sure your soul rules over your flesh Hallelujah let it rule praise God hallelujah come up my soul praise God don't get shy on me praise God hallelujah stir up that Soul say it's your duty to pray God's called you to pray God May answer this quickly praise God we never know praise God brother as soon as I got that testimony I shared it with another brother I said look I said you came to church on your expectation look what God did but we had to wait two days some of us we just want to see it that day right I like to see it that day but God made us wait two days is it any is it any less wonderful is it any less glorious no God teaching us patience God's teaching us endurance God's teaching us faithfulness praise God Hallelujah God's teaching us he cares he's showing us he's faithful he's showing us to wait upon the Lord renew your strength praise God don't let your strength run out don't let it leak out renew your strength like the eagle Hallelujah renew it get a fresh start with strength go and say Lord give me new Strength today I need strength to pray I need strength to witness I need strength to be an intercessor praise God give me strength I need your strength amen Hallelujah one day Church death will have no power over you oh I shouted I should have got Amen on that one by God's grace right there's on such the second death hath no power death slowly creeps into our bodies right brother Ray it slowly creeps into our bodies right slowly creeping in back pain body pains all these pains but one day death will have no power over us amen that's better enjoy it now because one day death is going to get cast in the Lake of Fire amen and death will be no more praise God but you and I will still be here with brand new bodies never experiencing death again never experiencing pain but Eternal Joy the eternal spirit of God amen oh that's what I'm looking for praise God hallelujah what a blessing what a promise and this goes to mighty men and women God's going to give this blessing to mighty men and women who overcome the Beast system in other words their their minds are marked by the Holy Spirit their hands do the works of the of God right giving alms fasting praying The Works of the Lord hallelujah that's what their hands do and that's what their minds do their minds meditate on the things of God they transform their minds by the renewal of it praise God finding the perfect will of God for their lives now this reminded me of Revelation 2 the promise to the the fourth Church age which brother Adam said was the darkest Church age because it was during the Dark Ages those Thousand Years where the Catholic Church uh the Bible was in 500 languages a few years before this but then after this the Bible was down to one language because of the devil's attempts that was the depths of Satan and the Bible says this as many as have not this Doctrine which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which we have already I'm sorry but that what you have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my works and to the end to him will I give power over the Nations power over the Nations you know our President Joe Biden has power over this nation he can sign an executive order and almost everybody's got to listen to it right it's not official law but he's got power over the nation well Jesus promises if you overcome uh if you overcome balaamism if you overcome the Jezebel spirit praise God if you overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the fresh pride of life if you overcome this I'll make you ruler over Nations praise God oh Hallelujah man what a greater thing he'll be to rule over the Nations when Jesus is President rather than the presidents we have these days praise God ah Jesus the Eternal president amen but he needs rulers over Nations so he's looking now and the Overcomers now amen that hold fast till Jesus comes he will make them rulers over Nations then they overcome those that keep the commands he says I'll give you power over Nations what a promise Church of course power now there's lots of definitions these were the ones that seemed to be the most applicable power of rule or government whose will and commands must be submitted to by others and obeyed imagine what would a what will Peter what what command will Peter give to the nation that he's ruling and all those Nate all those people in the nation got to obey that what command would he give Hallelujah think about that Paul what command will Paul give and the whole nation has to bow to it no one of them is probably going to be uh take your uh take your swords and beat him into plow shears remember that in the scripture no more war weapons take all your War weapons and make them into planting and harvesting weapons oh hallelujah thank God Amen and they must be submitted to it's the power of judicial decisions uh the authority to manage domestic affairs brother Adam said that word won't be like this world with all the carbon gases and and all the all the emissions from the cars it's not going to be like that where he said when you're over there if you're a Believer if you've got a glorified body he said you can travel like a thought amen the plane is too slow for me brother Ray amen the Uber is too slow for us we'll be able to travel with just thinking about it will we have the same power that Jesus had where he could walk through a wall how did it will walk through walls we'll think and move the Bible says great power will be given to the Overcomers amen that ain't me that's the Bible praise God amen that's what the Bible says power to them Jesus says I'm giving power to them over Nations because they overcame the B system here amen Glory imagine let's use uh let's use Brother Ray imagine uh Brother Ray let's say he's a ruler over there in the millennium I wonder if they'll blow trumpets in the morning here we're reading the decree from uh King Brother Ray Hernandez let it be done and let it be carried out make your swords plow shears or this day is going to be set aside for building houses or this day is going to be set aside for rest or this day all nations the nation will go up to the house of the Lord amen hallelujah praise God give him commands why because God can trust you here with the word of God if God can trust you here surely he can trust you over there with a brand new Eternal Body praise God and if he can trust you with the body that's breaking down has a sin nature it's your enemy it's enmity against God if you can crucify that daily and bring that into subjection you're more than able praise God you're the perfect candidate to ruin the Millennium praise God hallelujah that's what he wants somebody who can overcome here hallelujah oh they're struck me right there when you rule over when you rule over there you're gonna have a perfect body right but you're going to rule over the Nations that have they just have physical bodies in other words you'll be ruling over flesh there just like you're ruling flesh here there it is I'm talking about your flesh if you can rule over your flesh here you'll rule over flesh over there praise God Hallelujah may God help us to Reign Over this flesh Hallelujah have tell this flesh what you're going to do praise God tell this flesh how the day is going to go Hallelujah that's the power we got church we got power to do that this this this dust must be brought into subjection to the word of God Amen Hallelujah now Jesus goes on to say and he not I he the Overcomer shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall that be broken to Shivers have you ever seen a clay pot how many ever drop a a clay pot and it's and it shatters you ever done that before oh yeah I did all we had some out in the garage this past fall and I'm sorry honey I dropped some of them but they were just the real small ones there maybe I didn't tell you but I was just trying to clean off the shelf yeah she said no I didn't tell her forgive me we can buy some extra they make more they thankfully they make some more but I dropped a couple now how many broken glass before I mean it's the same it's the same idea same picture right something so it looks so strong but so fragile at the same time and Jesus says my people are going to rule over this world in the Millennium with a rod of iron even as Jesus received this command of his father praise God hallelujah and I'll give him the Morning Star now I wish I understood this I don't understand this each one gets a Morning Star I don't know if you get one of those Stars up in the heaven I don't know if it's going to be something in your pocket I don't know I don't know if it's going to be a medallion but he said I'm going to give you the Morning Star as far as I know there's only one morning star that's Jesus the Bright Morning Star so I don't understand that but we gain that but don't miss the 27. and all you got to do to have 27 is do this hear what the spirit says to the church today praise God if you hear what the spirit says today you'll be an overcomer Hallelujah now where where did Jesus get this language from where did John get this language from where did Jesus get it you got it from the book of Psalm chapter two yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son this day I begotten thee ask of me and I should give thee Heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession so the father saying to the son ask anything and I'll give it unto you and God tells the son Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel imagine take if we had Potter's vessels up here and you had a a rod of iron imagine how easy boom boom boom imagine it would just be so simple all you got to do is just line it up if you just line it up the iron is going to fall it's going to break the vessels that's what Jesus does and will do to every nation under Heaven amen oh he'll do that to America praise God he'll do that to Russia he'll do that to China he'll do it to Saudi Arabia Iraq Zimbabwe everyone Australia he will crush any man-made rule because it will no longer be men's day it will be the Lord's Day praise God oh and as easy as that is to crush clay pots that's how easy it will be when Jesus comes back in Armageddon Hallelujah and the sword goes out of his mouth and slays all his enemies and then Jesus said that's what it's going to be like when you're on the Earth in other words like that example when it's your time to give a decree hallelujah it's going to be followed through but you have to live right right now praise God you have to overcome now you got to Reign Over sin now praise God and then Jesus gives you a minor experience of what his experience will be like Hallelujah he'll do it on the major scale Armageddon he'll destroy Every Nation on the Lord's day and then he'll give you the authority praise God it gives he gives the Overcomer the authority to rule over a nation now for me church I'll probably I'm the least in the Kingdom so as long as I get at least one city to rule over I'll be a Victor praise God remember some people get 10 cities here he says rules over Nations I just hope I get one city to rule over praise God right we just want we just know God's promise we just want to be faithful we're not in other words we're not we're not competing against others but we do want to be faithful we do want to see Jesus give us a rod of iron we do want to be faithful we do want to be Overcomers is what I'm saying praise God Lord make me an overcomer by God's grace the Bible said do you not know the Saints shall judge the world judge the world know ye not that we shall judge Angels we'll judge Fallen Angels whoever we preach on those nephilims on on Sunday night we'll judge them we shall judge them they're the same ones same ones from the days of Adam and Eve right the demons never die same one down Through the Ages the same ones that deceived all you know deceive Moses and and deceive David and Solomon those same demons are still here today but we have power we have access to more power than them praise God we have better promises how many can say Amen to that you have better promises you have more power you can be an overcomer today praise God you don't have to fall like Moses as a murderer you don't have to fall like David as an adulterer praise God you have to be like any liar in the Bible like a Jonah you don't have to run from the presence of the Lord you can run into the friends of the Lord I get a little excited here we don't have to be like that yeah we're going to have shortcomings and Barbara says minor sins but we have access to more power we can be real Overcomers we can be Victors in this life remember he always causes you to Triumph in Christ don't forget your promises mighty men and women don't forget your promises we preach these last few months always causes me and you to Triumph in Christ Jesus I always come out on top because my king never loses a battle praise God always come on Jesus fighting for me pray I'm Malachi the Lord buddy if the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's Glory let God fight your battle praise God take God's word and let the Flaming sword of the word of God cut through the enemy let the word do what it's supposed to do that's the only thing that can get through your enemy is the word of God let the word do its work Hallelujah thus if we're trying to let's stop trying to do the work let's let God do the work Hallelujah let's let God's word go forth let's believe God's word God's promises now the mature way as you know the mature way is find the will of God first find the will of and that's the hard thing that most people don't want to hear uh not maybe not our church but most people just want to say well I believe it I'll speak it I'll speak it but first find the will of God first speak this say Speak Lord I know you're going to say Lord I know you're going to show me your perfect will speak that and the church said just don't speak what you want make sure God wants you to have it first Hallelujah speak what God wants speak I want your will God Amen I want your will not my will Lord give me the will of Heaven let Heaven's will come down to earth praise God let Heaven come down to my life you'll judge Angels because you judged righteously in your life right we should be able to judge lie we should be able to judge stealing we should be able to judge homosexuality we shall we should be able to judge adultery and fornication and any any wickedness we should be able to judge that blasphemies we should be able to judge that Abominations we should be able to judge this and if we judge it right here he makes us a judge later and I imagine he gives you a special robe too not a black one he gives you a white robe praise God hallelujah white like his amen and you'll judge Angels you'll judge the world mighty men and women will do it praise God those who are Mighty in the scripture those who let the power of God Work mightily in them I'm going kind of slow but I wish I could speed it up here I love this quote from the church age book I got to read it some of this is review if you've been around I think I think I preaches in 2017. some of these things Jesus says he that overcomes and keeps my Works unto the end it's very evident from these remarks of the spirit on works that the Lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works hey church I know we're saved by grace but don't forget after you're saved show God how much you appreciate your salvation and do some work for God tomorrow and the church said I believe saved by grace I'm not preaching work salvation I'm preaching get saved and then you'll want to do works praise God you want to work for the master praise God Amen not work for the devil you want to work for the master we need God's opinion of Works four times he mentions work Jesus does in the this forced Church age and now he says that he who keeps doing his Works Faithfully Until the End we'll be giving power over Nation see church this is why it's so important to find your gifts and your ministry in your life now dads and mothers it's kind of built into your life but you still have gifts on top of that so so keep seeking for your gifts praise God right you got to take care of your own the Bible says if a man don't take care of his own right it's worse than the Infidel right but see we got to find out what he's called us to do and if we're faithful with it he'll make us rulers over the Nations if you can just be faithful with your life your responsibility your circle of influence just be faithful with your job just be faithful in your church just be faithful in your family and I'll make you a rule over Nation Jesus says amen anyone that Faithfully does the works will be a strong capable unbending ruler imagine that in the Millennium no one will be able to tempt you to take a bribe well I just harvested you know uh 500 pounds of grapes I'll give you that if you can allow me to do this murder or whatever no one's going to make you move no get behind me Satan I know of course there'll be no sin in the million but you understand they won't be able to bribe you because you'll be unbending because you have a glorified body amen even your flesh will be glorified amen you'll feel the glory all the time in your body praise God oh like I'm feeling tonight you'll be unbending and you can cope you can handle so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be see broken right Shivers picture that Jesus breaking the pots Jesus breaking the vessels amen picture you breaking some vessels praise God Jesus breaking the vessels it's not even hard it's just a matter of gravity it's just a matter of effort it's just a matter of want to praise God save it is for you and I it's just a matter of our effort to overcome the gates of hell that come against us we are more than conquerors praise God we don't have to be defeated we are Overcomers Hallelujah his demonstration of rule by power will be likened unto the very Sons Jesus Christ this is very amazing see keeping the commands builds up your character in such a way you become unbending you will not give in to the sin because I've got a streak of all these days Glory I got a streak of all these weeks I got a streak of all these years I'm unbending I've got power I've got the character of Christ I will not Bend to the devil I'll overcome the devil praise God Hallelujah that's who Jesus gives power over the Nations to those who can be so unbending and stay with the word obey the truth and they can handle any situation now I know I'm a school teacher but I've got a pretty difficult class this year and it's actually pushing me further than I I thought I had I could go I'm being tested more than I've ever been tested in a lot of years people have asked me today they said have you ever had a class like this I said never in 20 years 19 years I've never had a class like this because once you have a class like that you never forget that class they put a scar on your spirit a broken Spirit who can who can bear well no I just you know sometimes I got spit on the last few weeks I got spit on I've gotten smacked I've got my uh tie pulled and I've got called I got spit right in the face yeah I got you know just uh you know I just said and I look at him and I say I love you I don't know why you're doing this I wish you made better decisions I love you push to the limits there's nothing more disrespectful than being spit on but see we got to handle any situation and cope with it so powerfully that it's just like how Jesus would handle and like I said our little trials are just light trials like they say small potatoes our trials our battles are just small potatoes now let's talk about somebody going to kill you now that's a real that's a real battle right there Martyrs that's a real battle but let's listen George if I can't cope with my Trouse how am I going to cope with other trials God's Got To Build Me Up amen each year a little stronger a little stronger more faithful more unbending more more uh more stuck with the truth more more sincere praise God Amen more dedicated Hallelujah until nothing can phase me I have the same character you have the same character that Christ has amen each year building you up more and more where you do not Bend anymore you don't break you stand firm on the word of God like brothers stand on the word he said let the chips fly wherever they want in other words you can let let the mess happen but you don't do it you stand on the word of God Amen let their problems I mean they're gonna they're gonna reap what they sow but you stand there and let God's will be done you stay with God's word don't bend don't break stay with the word of God Hallelujah so see we get Mighty Men forever Church mighty men and women forever yesterday today and forever and then when the holy city comes down to New Jerusalem the Bible said the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the Light of Christ the future always has to be a pyramid or else if it's a it's a cube the light can't go it'll just go out you know but it's got to be a pyramid so the light goes down and out and everywhere and so all the nations of the world can walk in the light of Jesus the Bible said the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it the Bible said the gates don't even close there's no reason to close the gates there's no reason like right every night every night at home I walked I walked make sure all our four doors are locked every night I don't want anybody coming in because one night it was left open just by uh a child that's all the details I'll give all night I wonder why is it a little chilly in here the back door's wide open they got us in the summertime too right but that's but that same Freedom now I don't we don't like that here but over there that's how it's going to be the gates are going to be open anybody can come in there'll be no night because we're Children of the day praise God we're not children of the night we don't walk in darkness we're always walking the light praise God as he is in the light Hallelujah and church if we're faithful I always love this picture I'm going to pull that picture back up there if we're faithful the gates we're going to have one of those we're going to have one of these little Mansions mine's probably right there right in the corner that's probably mine right there and then you know you know then my children you know right there you know Hallelujah I think Paul and Peter are going to be living up there don't you I think that's I think that's where they're gonna live but work Church we're gonna see those Gates they open and the kings of the Earth are going to flow into this city look they're going to walk right down by that River up to the king they're going to bring all their Glory think of all the produce they'll bring in think of the gems and the jewels and they'll bring all of this up to the king and what what we have never have to leave the king will always be in his presence we won't be living outside the city we get to live in the city praise God because he went to prepare a mansion for you and I praise God because you overcame now Hallelujah because you let him live with you now he lets you live with him later praise God hallelujah thank God lord just give me that little Corner Spot there by God's grace you'll know it's me you just hear that guy singing This is Amazing Grace let me singing oh how he loves you and me he gave his life what more that's brother Jesse what more could he do praise God Hallelujah think of it the Bible says they're going to have Glory Treasures Crowns who I was talking about a crown for the overcomer scepters robes I mean think about this Kingdom the Overcomer at least some of them gets rods for the the scepters they got robes on it's a whole brand new kingdom we can't really fathom it now the best clothes we can get now is Rags compared to those white robes rags and then well Jesus will give us crowns for overcoming it's unbelievable praise God the the honor that'll give to someone who can judge the matters correct today praise God if we can judge him right now he makes us judge over them later and we'll watch the kings of the Earth come in bring their Glory like they're grapes they're strawberries they're corn now probably like those original grapes they had in Canaan right two men got to carry a big huge bundle of them they're so big they'll bring all their Treasures into it now look Kings they're still mighty men like these are these are Kings outside the city or maybe this church maybe the Kings will live in maybe we'll we'll be these Kings and maybe we'll rule over the Nations and we'll go out to our nation and then we'll maybe maybe then we'll lead our nation in there praise God and they'll bring all the the fruits of their Ministries into the into the King City praise God the King City hallelujah thank God now I want to read this uh look the the the Bible writers look at this too now this is something you want to catch too the king shall be thy nursing fathers and their Queens thy nursing mothers now they're speaking to Israel but there could be a type here they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the Earth and lick up the dust to thy feet and thou shalt know that I am the Lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me in other words the kings and queens of the Earth are going to bring all their nurture or all their their produce and all their uh other food and everything into the city I'm sorry or it's a millennium could be one or the other and notice there's with each case all of them bow down before the bride and the Jews and their faces lick the Dust think about that that's what the Bible says Jesus said the same thing he says behold I make I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are are Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll make them come and worship before thy feet to know that I have loved thee why because you've kept the word of my patience so all those that don't keep the word come down and bow down to those that do keep the word of God isn't that something a church none of us want anybody to bow down before us but Jesus gives us that reward Hallelujah if we bow down to him today can you say Amen to that if we can Bow Down and Worship Jesus today he's going to make all those who didn't bow down before us as the ultimate sign that we were Overcomers that we kept the word of God that we made sacrifices in this life we were rejected in this life but we were accepted in the next slide praise God he makes all those that wouldn't bother Christ bow down at your feet because you've kept the word of God now brother man met this man in 1953 and he said what do you mean brother said you mean tell me all those Christians that ever died all those born-again people will be on the earth he says you couldn't place them on this earth like cordwood now cordwood is chopped wood so think of all the stacked wood those guys that have you know those uh yeah what are they called Carpenters yeah they have all this wood stacked and they have their heating stoves what they call those stoves wood burning stoves sorry seems so simple well I don't have one that's why I can't think of it so but they have these huge stacks of wood and this man tells brother Adam you mean tell me all these people are going to go in the Rapture you couldn't even fit them in here like like cord would but random said who said they'd be here on Earth like cord would he said my heavenly father stood back there and blowed off his hands moons Stars moons there'll be millions of Worlds out yonder wow well my hard to tell where we'll live out in them great places now we might start in the future city but hard to tell where Jesus will take us amen hard to tell where he may send you praise God in other words if there ain't enough room on this Earth for enough Kings to rule he'll give you a word to rule praise God he'll give you a different world if there ain't enough room here praise God because he can just blow him off his hand oh that's that might be how he gives you the Morning Star right he might place you out there I'm gonna put a star right next to brother Jessica's Planet there now you got the Morning Star he said how about over 10 cities in all these cities he said he'd overcome a sharula over here I said why God's got worlds on top of Worlds and places on top can I say like this Jesus gives us blessings on top of blessings on top of blessings he answers prayer on top of prayer he gives us healing on top of healing he gives us Mercy on top of Mercy he gives us forgiveness on top of forgiveness he's got Grace upon Grace amen this is amazing grace Hallelujah and if he needs it he's got worlds on top of worlds if he runs out of Nations that's okay he can make his own all right he don't need our help he'll just blow him out there that's right you stop right there he can do it so George in other words don't worry about the math don't don't be trying to Crunch in the math you just trust in the math the mathematician praise God he's trusting the master said how can our little infinite mind limit God why we can't there's no way at all to express to him when we look out and see how vast God is in his Universe why how marvelous but to think that he would be so concerned to come down to the lowest individual and the worst drunk or Harlot there is in Chicago or Akron that's right and save them that's love how many can say Amen in that he formed all these plans he formed all these stars but yet he'll come to Akron Ohio yet he'll come to Ghana Hallelujah that'll come to us he'll come to Illyria wherever you're from Brother Lorraine amen wherever you're from he'll come to you or South Carolina amen hallelujah you're out there in Arizona he'll come to you praise God because he loves you he's got a plan for you he wants you to overcome and he wants you to rule on Earth praise God amen amen he said that's love praise God when the God of all the universe comes down to your your place visit your church visit your house amen and gives you Grace and gives you power to rule and reign in this life so you can reign in the next life praise God Amen amen hallelujah I've said it before let them have their big jobs let them have their big money just let me have Jesus just let me have a faithful life let me just be a real Christian let me have a real Christian testimony that I'm an overcomer that's where it's more than everything praise God if somebody can see Jesus Christ in my humble little life Hallelujah it's worth any sacrifice because he's infinite he's Unlimited he can go Way Beyond my limited imagination well brother Jess how could I ever be this all I do is take care of the kids all I do is feed the kids well if you're faithful in that you'll probably rule over kids later or you'll be faithful later praise God because you were faithful with the ministry God gave you he'll make you ruler over much the Bible says faithful with little is faithful with much so churches picture that again there's going to be that's going to be all filled with mighty men and women who overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony only Overcomers are going to live there praise God the foolish version they get to come in but they don't get to stay imagine how sad they're going to be now that I know they're looking at perfect bodies right you know I said they're going to be when they got to leave and we get to stay say love you all God bless you but we get to stay with Jesus praise God they've got to leave that that that physical presence of Christ but we get to stay in that presence because we overcame Hallelujah because we judge the matters the right way here so he'll make us judges over there in some Holy City now this I said all this to get to this I said all that 45 minutes of preaching this is the thought that I got that I want to share brother Brown preached the sermon cut the contest how many ever heard that before amen real short sermon it was the New Year's Eve service 1962 December 31st he had 30 minutes before the new year came in 1963 came in and he comes up to the pulp and preaches the contest out of Ephesians 6 12. I'm going to read it Ephesians 6 12. Ephesians 6 12. a contest is a test of strength in other words this life is testing you to see how strong you are that's all this is this is a contest to see how Mighty you are brother Hallelujah that's all it is it's a contest how strong are you brother sister how strong are you that's all this life is how strong are you what can you handle what can you cope with how strong can you be now we laugh at bodybuilders because we know they're wasting their lives and when they get older they get a lot of flab when they get older okay because I've seen them they gotta have surgery and all these things but really that's what we're doing spiritually we're building our faith muscles praise God Amen and the goal of our Christianity the Bible says is to build up your Most Holy Faith by praying in the Holy Ghost and to live and that when you have that strength then you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Hallelujah well the ram says goes back to the Native Americans they used to have a fire and they put so many end on this rope men on this rope so many end and they have a tug of war it was a contest to pull the losing party Into the Fire right and now we know there's many things we could base this on for a few minutes but I want to speak of these events quickly the greatest contest there is is between you and Satan amen there's no greater contest I don't care when the World Series starts that's not a contest the Super Bowl that's not a contest the greatest contest is between Satan and the Bride of Jesus Christ who's stronger that great strength of Satanist does brother and call him a dumb devil No in fact this ceremony twice he says he's getting stronger every day because the love of God is waxing coat in other words there's less love so he gets more influence over people his influence grows every day well so is your influence growing every day amen hallelujah thank God and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his I'm going to change it to bride because Church means called out yeah and he said we're called out for his namesake a bride's sake now this great contest is going on for many years six thousand years starred in heaven Satan was kicked out into the Earth he become the enemy to God's people since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires into the virus imagine that Satan tonight is trying to pull you into a fire of sin a life of disgrace he's trying to pull you into the fire and burn up your testimony that's all it is that's all this week was his attempt to pull you he's imagine he's on the other end of the road when you're looking look at him in the face every day oh no say you're not getting me today I've got I got some spiritual muscles I took my vitamins last night praise God I just took my vitamins in prayer amen you're coming in the fire praise God amen that's all this is a contest of who's stronger amen Satan or you of course it won't be you it'll be Christ in you because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so in other words you got to hold on that rope and say God give me your strength upon this road because my hands are if I use my strength my hands are going to get all these uh all these cows there you go I can never think of these words here I worked all day so I'm sorry I got about 5 15 to study so forgive me I can't remember all these words I get all these calluses I'll get i'll get bleeding Lord if you don't give me strength I'm gonna lose this I'm gonna get burnt today God keep me from being burned I imagine just about that time the Living Waters and the fire starts burning up and you feel the strength return you get that second win praise God and you pull the enemy into the fire praise God Hallelujah the Bible said he leaves for a season you can shake off the hands thank God I guess I'll get some uh bomb on these uh on these calluses here Bob and Gilead thank God there's Bob and Gilead today praise God but see sometimes our tug of wars lasts a long time how many understand that ain't just five minute tug of war sometimes it's days sometimes it's weeks sometimes it's six years brother amen just testified he had a whole year of a tug of war right sister a whole year of struggling a whole year I felt like I was tugging with him imagine we had tug of war last year at school my team won thankfully but I think we out know I think we outnumbered them too I think that's why we won so I was thankful for the victory though by God's grace I don't want to be pulling the fire he says he's trying to pull you into the fires of sin and we know who has the most power God does and God when he gave his people the best thing that he could give give him the compass combat Saint with was his word because the word is God and who's stronger than God so the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in his church becomes its strength to pull Satan to his own fires that he has made praise God Hallelujah oh it's so beautiful just like Haman he got hung by his own his own Gallows there it is my vocabulary is really down today forgive me his own Gallows praise God right Ahab got licked up by the very dogs right in that same place where he tried to get the land the same land that he had he thought he had he got licked up in the same location praise God the dogs licked his blood same thing with Jezebel Hallelujah amen what Satan works out for your demise will always do him in praise God whatever he's planned for you if you if you take the strength of God if you trust in the strength of God you'll pull him into his own trap praise God he'll get trapped in his own trap he'll get lost in his own fire praise God Hallelujah and the Bible says and the brother says you can do that by God's power you can bring Satan into his own fire Hallelujah was the word of God the best thing and the tug goes on see in my name they'll cast out devils Hallelujah in other words in my name they'll tug and the Devils will be cast out the Devils will be burnt praise God in the spiritual sense we're talking about the Devils will be defeated in my name in the name of Jesus Christ how many seen done before praise God Amen Hallelujah now I'm going to skip down to this dark part because I'm trying to finish the black part there the ballpark but the thing to do in my opinion is know your enemy train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to meet him in other words you can't escape the tug of war you can try to ignore the calendar well I'm not going to have any trials I'm never going to be tested oh no but there's a there's a date on there that God knows you're going to be tested that day you might not know it now you might know if it's a doctor's appointment or you might know if it's a certain thing you might know a certain date you know but sometimes you don't know the day so if you don't know the day you have to train for that day but a man said to my opinion you need to know how Satan works on you right train for the contest and know him know what his strength is huh so what is he good at tempting you with amen right and then train for this contest when you do meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him so you train for the contest I didn't have time to do a researcher but on Saturday when I was driving I was playing and listening to some training I was listening to Mike Tyson's training regime when he was a champion and some of these other boxers like how do they train how did Floyd how did Floyd Mayweather train well he said he would sleep in till like 2 30 P.M and he would train he would eat and train I'm sorry train Eat Sleep Train Eat Sleep Train eat sleep for months and months and months and never and never ever have a bite of sugar it was all healthy food all the time it was always rice and chicken and greens everyone because he wanted to win and he was undefeated ah Jesus is undefeated praise God hallelujah and if we want victories we got to train the way our trainer says to train praise God Hallelujah in other words we know there's a battle coming up so what are we doing to get ready for it how many want to be Mighty when that battle comes I know some of the tug of wars are going to be long church but some of them don't have to be as long if we'd be more faithful amen please and the church said amen amen sometimes we let them go too long because we're using our own strength amen amen right but if we use his strength it's a supernatural power Hallelujah he's more than able praise God he pulls the Rope for us hallelujah in us he's with us even in us as we pull the Rope even to the end of the world praise God one thing's for sure you are going to have a tug of war with Satan one thing is for sure so know your enemy when he come to Jesus when he was fasted but Austin's tried to fast right I try to fast sometimes I try to fast that's when I get attacked with headaches right or Temptations like where'd this come from I'm fasting that's the same thing that happened to Jesus that's you know he was fasting for 40 days I've never done that but we should know our enemy when does he come to us some of us it's on Saturday night sovis is on Sunday morning the church said amen amen hallelujah someone says always that attack at a certain time or a certain place or when we're around a certain person and we almost know it's going to happen so we got to prepare for the contest what are we doing to prepare for the contest that's the question he said training for a contest is just like a boxer his enemy that he's going to meet out there in the contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his licks know where he fights for I'm sorry nowhere he fights for whether he leans forward whether he hangs back like the old days fights right-handed or he fights left-handed he studies all this and then if he's a good smart fighter he gets him aspiring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights for he'll know all of his licks when he gets to that place and so see George that's why we read the Bible we read how Satan fought this partner there oh he did that oh he surrounded oh he put Moses them at the Red Sea he surrounded them they felt there was no way out oh he's gonna he may try to put me in a situation where I feel like there's no way out or oh with with Noah he made him wait 120 years he may he may make me wait a long time I gotta know how he's gonna fight me I got to be willing to wait longer I got to be willing to build a house of safety for my family praise God I got to be willing to make ready I know the judgment is coming but I can have a place of safety praise God Hallelujah I know he's going to make me play the waiting game I've been praying and crying since probably second grade for my dad to get saved and have a real experience I was eight years old one of my 40 41 now almost 32 or 33 years and church I'm not giving up this is the waiting game I know my enemy he'll try to discourage me he'll try to make me doubt but I but I studied the enemy I know his tactics amen hallelujah so when he comes I gotta grab on the rope and say no devil I'm not going to be discouraged I'm going to be encouraged I'm not going to give up I'm going to keep believing praise God amen you you won't pull me into doubt or unbelief I'm going to keep believing God's word Hallelujah now put your your put your loved one in there right I was I was I was listening on that Mayweather and he would spar he would Spar for like an hour straight no that's unheard of this guy was in top top tip top shape he that and the the sparring partners could only last 15 minutes now I could probably last 10 seconds in that ring maybe five but he was in such good shape he would just do 15 minutes with that guy he knocked this guy and then bringing the next guy he would just be back for a whole hour to get ready for this one battle at church that's what we need to be we need to be constantly feeding on the word of God we're going to be constantly getting ready because we know he's coming we got to build up our strength praise God Amen we got to build it up because we know the tug of war is coming and we don't want to get to the tug of war and Satan pulls us into the fire we get burnt by sin Our Testimony goes can I say that our testimony Goes Up in Flames because they like because we've seen them come right in here and their testimonies go open flames why because it's a battle it's a tug of war Battle but thank God we're still standing in church thank God we're not in the fire thank God you still got a hold of the Rope thank God you still can train today thank God you're still ready for the contest thank God that he's given you strength to pull on the road praise God hallelujah Hallelujah we're pulling on this rope for 22 years but I'm giving up I'm giving up now praise God Hallelujah I'm just in fact I'm just getting started amen hallelujah that ought to be all of our attitudes I'm just getting started tugging that rope praise God I'm just getting started with my boxing career boxing the devil I just got started praise God now I better keep that good attitude or else I'm gonna get whipped because I'm gonna be overconfident I better keep training better get on my knees and train and get all that strength I need for the Rope because I'm going to be pulling praise God she got to know how Satan's gonna battle you but Amanda said you always come to me when I was tired and worn out so at the end of the day how many how many go through battles at the end of the day there's some days I just want to quit and go to bed I say this day I've had enough this day I want a new day I want new mercies tomorrow because I feel like all my mercies I ran out for today and God said I'm gonna give you some new ones tomorrow Lord I need some new ones see because I wasn't strong that day as I should have been all right maybe I didn't do enough training that day oh my goodness thank you Jesus for your mercy I love this I love what brothers and I think that's a very good thing for Christian do that's right now if you want to start training he says start with John 3 16 the Golden Rule start right out and then he says with that you'll get on the floor with John 3 16. I wonder what John 3 16 a little jab Church you know jab you got how many know John 3 16. you can really knock the devil for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him shall not perish but have everlasting life that's a pretty good point church amen that's a pretty good muscle can I say like that John 3 16 is a good place to start but that ain't the end of it then pretty soon you get a good Proverbs I told you that was my overcoming scripture right Proverbs 3 verse 5. trust in the Lord with all your heart because I always battled out am I doing the right thing does anybody uh I never had a dad so you know I never had a real dad like come for me so am I doing the right thing am I in the perfect will of God have I done anything right I'm always balloned out so I got to say trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not to your own understanding as long as I've acknowledged all his ways he will make my past straight praise God because he's the heavenly father to replace my Earthly father amen amen and that's really all I need if I look at it the right way so he said just start just get starting with you with your John 3 16 jab you know the jab just keeps him off you right right you just it just keeps them off you it's setting up something later I'm saved God so love God love you God loved the world praise God he sent his son to save me I'm saved but that's the only gonna last you for so long you need another punch by God's grace oh thank God he's giving us different punches praise God then you train for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that everybody know that amen oh you sisters need knockout punches I've never seen any of your sisters swing but I mean I imagine you're pretty strong holding those babies all the time like that they got bigger muscles than me it's a good thing they do too knock out punches everybody knows that you need a knockout punch with the devil I didn't know that did you know that yeah we know that you've got to have some punch to knock the devil out of your life out of your mind some scripture that you can use and it will remove the devil amen it'll put him in the fire praise God Amen you have to train to hit your enemy and always God uses his word we must remember that God uses his word to defeat the enemy if God could think or give his people anything better defeat the enemy with he would have done it so as I've always said when God makes a decision that's the best there is he never has to alter decisions so the first decision God gave his people in the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his word they were fortified with his word now look at this Brotherhood said you're going to need to train for knockout punches what was Jesus's knockout punch Peter said oh Lord you have to go to Calvary what'd Jesus say get the hence Satan and guess what Satan left all he had to say was get behind me I'm going to Calvary amen and Satan left we never heard about a shout we never heard about a prophecy or speaking in tongues or Screaming or dancing he just said get behind me Satan I'll go through this battle I'll go through this trial and what do you do he pulled Satan right in the fire amen when he came with those three Temptations what was his knockout punch it is written it is written again and then he comes across get the event Satan maybe he does the uppercut like I seen I was watching some videos maybe an uppercut get behind me Satan it's written thus I worship the Lord thy God and hit only I'll not worship you I only worship God Amen and he knocks Satan out and Satan gets knocked out and goes down and the Bible said he left for a season how many needs some knockout punches tonight by God's grace I just showed you one praise God when the devil's quote you something say well I got this I got more I got more than John 3 16. amen Hallelujah I got more than that I will not take the mark of the beast I am an overcomer praise God I'm Overcoming By the blood of Jesus Christ amen you're going to get a knockout punch pretty soon Hallelujah what was program's knockout punch he just lost his wife to tuberculosis hope he lost Sharon Rose to tuberculosis and Satan said I thought you said God loved you I thought you said God was a Healer and so he told Brothers all these lies about me I said well I I did say that I did say that remember I said I was just about ready to quit in other words look at this program was getting pulled in the fire well I thought God was a Healer he was saying God didn't tell me or God told me or he said uh Satan told me God don't love me he said I was just about ready to quit and he said all of a sudden something raised up on the inside ah there's that knockout punch amen it was Job chapter 1 verse 21 he said who give me that wife who give me that child the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he said get behind me Satan amen Hallelujah and he said the last thing he said he said Satan though he slay me yet I'll trust him amen and that was Jesus in Birmingham pulling Satan to the fire and Satan had to flee he said where did I get that baby anyway God gave it to me the Lord gives the Lord takes where I get that wipe anyway God gave her to me and God will take her away Hallelujah but around knows you need some knockout punches praise God I was crying about this time well almost 10 months ago I was crying saying god brother Austin's come back he's left all these things and now he's in debt I'm crying I was having a I was having a battle with the Rope I was like Lord I don't have enough money to get Austin out of debt I didn't think I had enough money I didn't have enough money I was losing faith and I stopped at the light I said Lord I said Lord you own the cattle on a thousand hills praise God hallelujah amen and when I quote that scripture it gave me strength and I didn't catch a revelation until a week later I didn't get the strength a week later but I had the knockout punch right there praise God hallelujah and I opened up my phone and there it is it's a knockout blow it's the right cross amen cross amen hallelujah the right cross knocked out Satan and knocked out his debt praise God amen Brian Hawkins needed surgery to replace his hips he said brother Jessica got to have surgery I said no you don't I said you're too young to have this let's pray I said if you confess to all your sins he said yes and the lord gave me that knockout punch man I said brother I said you're too young to have this I said let's speak life into those hips I said there's power of life and death in the tongue I said I rebuke you Satan amen amen I rebuke your Satan now this was it might have been a left hook right maybe I got a maybe I got a little jab here maybe I got him a right cross and he's fallen over I did a right hook I said there's life and the power of tongue Satan get behind him there's life in the tongue praise God I speak live in this situation and two days later I get the call and Satan's in the fire you don't have to have the surgery anymore that's called a knockout punch Church now did I know I was doing a knockout no I didn't know it so I'm not taking any credit for this but you and I can look at all of our lives and you can see moments where you gave the knockout punch you didn't know it till later but God gave you the scripture there is life and death in the positive that's what we said with sister who is Dad what was brother Banks knockout punch oh there it was brother bang had the knockout punch Satan was trying to tell him oh your dad's gonna die your dad's gonna die brother bang went in there and said no he said these are lying vanity Satan get behind my dad in the name of Jesus Christ these are lying vanities he's gonna now he didn't say that but he's going to come out of this coma and days later he come out of the coma he's alive today he was anointed for life and The Knockout Punch knocked out Satan he's alive today praise God Hallelujah so Church you got to train and that's that knockout punch I had with life and death in the pirate tongue God gave me that at four in the morning when he woke me up that morning I just woke up with three verses the third one was there's power of life and death in the tongue see training sometimes you got to get up early to train amen I didn't want to get up that early though that's okay somebody knew I needed a training session Hallelujah see church this is a contest of strength how strong can you can you let Christ be in your life let's send our feet musicians could come see the enemy is going to study your strategy with the word he's going to watch how often does our sister do this and get strong in the word how often do our brothers get strong in the word of God Satan's watching us he's watching are we having those sparring sessions are we getting the workouts spiritually speaking are we lifting the spiritual muscles are we left in the spiritual ways to get our muscles stronger spiritually to overcome Satan we've got to put the spiritual discipline in because Satan is watching our strategy we see his strategies with deceiving the word of God but we he also looks at our strategy how do we handle the word of God and what I found in my life I got to quote the word of God more I got to stop trying to figure it out I've got to let Jesus work it out why are you trying to figure it out Jesus is going to work it out Hallelujah that's why I preach this series we can become more Mighty in the scriptures to know the word of God that we can be let the Holy Spirit work mightily in our lives how we want to do that tonight by God's grace God bless you I I better stop right there I had some more quotes
