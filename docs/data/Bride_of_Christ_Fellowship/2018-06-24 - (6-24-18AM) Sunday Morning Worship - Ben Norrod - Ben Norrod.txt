come if she will and we're gonna sing just a little bit before we get into the preaching of the word of the Lord and that singing was so good I hear this morning I just started slippery just a minute I was really enjoying that I I like to hear good old-fashioned Pentecostals I like that I think that's what the Lord likes I think he likes to hear singing with jubilation singing from the heart amen we certainly appreciate the opportunity to be here and I just want to say thank you to brother Jesse and the church body for receiving us again and it's good to see so many friends around the building this morning we just love you all god bless you so much and a man I just just appreciate the opportunity to come by and we I guess we was over yonder last time and you all moved his sanctuary over here and and I like said in a lot of ways they don't feel like any different here and then what it was over there same smiling faces over here as it was a great man Amen so I walked in over the door and I opened it up and looked in there and I saw the equipment pulled out and moved over and I thought to myself now that's right here we no continuing City things just move and change and every day of our life is a changes and today may why and then tomorrow's gonna be completely different and we sing a little song and we have for a long time now called yesterday if you like gospel music fella by the name of George Jones he's dead he gonna be at the Lord now instead now and he wrote that many years ago and that a lie in the song says yesterday things were different today they're different again but one thing Jesus never changes he's always the same and I thank God for that don't you amen so here we are a little older amen hopefully just as good-looking as I've ever been but close to the closer to the Lord amen all the way through it and so we've we've just been so grateful to the Lord for everything he's done for course and we're heading to Africa on Wednesday for the Congo for a convention there I covet your prayers that the Lord would just be with us and watch over us and we're meeting several different brethren there I think from the United States and from different parts of Africa and different parts of the world and they're having kind of an international meeting that weekend and I forgot all the places they said where it would be but I want you to pray for us the Lord would help us during that time we'll be there for about seven days all together give or take and that's just for the meeting and then back home and then a few weeks from now after coming back into the States we'll be leaving for Trinidad and we'll be this be the third time going evil meeting Easter weekend we was invited to go and I had a tremendous time there with those Saints in Trinidad and then we're going to return there in July and Lord will and wife and I are going they they love music and singing if you've ever been in that part of the world they are singers and musicians like you've never seen you could turn a rock over and find a professional musician me and brother loris feel bad you know over there just a man we he's such a talented man but you get over next to them people and you wonder if you even should play anymore when you didn't listening to him I tell you buddy I tell you never heard such musicians and all they're all your life that just tremendous and so I laughed at him they wanted me to sing a sing spiration they called it and we was I nice listen these guys and they come up there sound like Hillsong or some of them people singing you know and then they wanted me to come up here in my little three chords and the cloud of dust in that country twice lord have mercy if I ever felt like brother Brenham are you a rider no sir I'm not a rider that was it I mean that was the spot Amen but we're returning there the Lord willing in July for those people to have a meeting and then while we're there we're going to Guyana but Jessie I'm over 40 now don't let me forget to talk to you about Guyana I want some advice there and some counsel upon kindly how to approach the country but our first time in the country coming up we're looking forward to it I think the host pastor there in Trinidad is going to support us going over it's only about a 45-minute flight down and so we'll be there about four or five days I think myself and then back home into the u.s. Lord willin on top of those few meetings there then we have Mexico coming again maybe towards September October Mo's times been many years since I've been there last time I was there was Timmy Meyers I mean Tim was there 2006 and we've just done our best to turn the country upside down and there there's I found that just the other day matter of fact from that meeting out there I spoke to a brother on the phone he got saved in that meeting and he's a pastor now I got three four hundred people in his church he was telling me on the phone he said it was your meeting that you preached you remember that certain service I said I remember the but I don't remember you come and he said remember that group of young people I said I remember that he said I was one of them I thought well praise the Lord and that wonderful amen praise God and here he is a pastor and that wonderful amen so you never know what things are going to be accomplished in Trinidad this year in East or we had over a hundred young people the elder coming for salvation I preached on the baptism of the holy ghost and they came up tears for another I was crying and asking God for mercy you never know what happens in them countries like that so if you would pray for us as we go that the Lord would give us souls for the labor Amen so I like to mention those things to the body that Saints would be praying for us and I figured when the prayer lines were on and devils were in trouble they would call for help I figure well devils had enough sense to call for help social saints of God don't you think so amen and we want you to pray with us and join with us in prayer that the Lord just blessed us in these endeavors and so outside of that we got all these meetings in the States in different parts and more that we're traveling and those those miles aren't easy they accumulate on you and physically there they're a hard hard thing to try to do sometimes going from one meeting to another to another to another but somebody asked me the day before the ban have you done it 300 days on the year on the road and and 52 weekends for 15 years and have you done that well they say you're young I said well but you don't feel young after about seven or eight weeks of that you know you start feeling like an old man I guess and some I said well I think I know what the answer is I said what's that he said because everywhere you go you ask people to pray for ya so that's it right there that's the thing as people praying so you pray for us and we love you very much and and again so happy to be back here in the little church again we are thrilled to be back with you oh and by the way for I forget Sam and I we're getting ready release our second CD coming we got it they're working on it now getting all the details fixed up where they can finish all the mixing and all that stuff and maybe next time we see you will have a have our second project here did you get the first one did you enjoy you they got it oh I like them heads going up and down like at all that makes me feel good prayer is the Lord well we love you you're so nice to talk to I could talk to you all day but we burn up after a while wouldn't we this heat in here so amen let's sing and then get right into the preaching of the word god bless you all of you happy in the Lord this morning just give a good hearty hey man if you are a man praise the Lord [Music] I've told all my troubles goodbye goodbye this world where I'm in the sky I walk when I step across to that shine [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

somebody even memorable people may look at you and say all just an average Joe and Friends there's one thing that we do realize yes the world may pass us right on by they may not look at us as being anything great but if we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's one thing that by the promise that if we pray he will hear from heaven that he will hear our prayers if you ask anything in my name he said I'll do it for you I'm so glad this morning that I have the ability to call on the lovely on the mighty and on the holy name of Jesus yes sir I can pray if you believe it just shout Amen

all they want but I like something that's got them messages in it like daddy man I just love it amen I just love it Fijians chapter 4 I want to speak to you this morning the Lord helping us upon be you kind one to another you kind one to another amen oh you like teaching out here and so I'm just gonna bring you a Bible lesson but one thing about me is I preached while I teach too I just I just try to hold right with it and I I kind of like getting happy fight it down into amen I just like it I'm convinced my friends that one reason people just don't shout and praise the Lord and worship anymore like they used to they just not saved hey man oh yeah get saved it puts a glory glory to God in the hollow in your mouth and your heart don't it Amen it sure does visions chapter 4 verse 25 we're gonna get ready for some real work here this morning I'm getting the sleeves up amen visions for verse 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry and sin not let not the Sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good they may have to give to him that no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the ears grieve not the Holy Spirit of God by ye are sealed unto the day of your Redemption now this is amazing to me if you're reading these verses and you don't know a verse 30 exists what a rude awakening it is to hear all of these statements made by the Apostle Paul and then here turn around and say the people that are born-again Christians with the seal of God it's amazing actually because you would think well if you're a Christian if you're a child of God you never lie you never do anything wrong you never get angry you never do any of these type of things truth of the matter is friends it's Christians that will do the very things that Paul is talking about right here but we as the people of God we're supposed to have a power we're supposed to have something inside of us that brings us subject to god but it doesn't mean that we won't do some of these very things that he's talking about a man said to me one time said a man with the Holy Ghost cannot tell a lie I said you ought to be careful I said very the very man we call Elijah the Prophet in the last day got under pressure told a lie and had to go back and repent to the guy up there at the tax firm tell him I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that I just under pressure and what more so it doesn't mean that if you've got to hold a ghost that you won't do things wrong the difference between somebody making a mistake and practicing sin there's a vast difference between the two we're not practicers of things but there are things that will come along so Paul is speaking to this group of believers now watch us grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice talking to born-again Christians and be he kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you let's pray over the word just a moment while your heads are bowed this morning if you'd like to be remembered in prayer just let it be known by the lifting of your hand today amen god bless you my hands up to Lord Jesus we thank you this morning for your mercy we're so thank you for your grace my Lord Jesus we are so privileged lamb of God to come into this place called the house of God Lord as I was thinking just this morning of that simple little example of the sanctuary moving over this side of the building and here we have no continuing City how things are always changing the one constant in this life that we have is that Lord you are still the same God today that you've ever been being eternal you never change you never have a new thought all your thoughts dwell with you just the same today as they was yesterday the same as they'll be tomorrow Lord as you spoke to me one time in praying I am the same today as I was even yesterday and tomorrow I will remain the same God that you know and love in this very same way God because you are eternal we know by the finite we know by the temporal way of life in this way of living God we realize that every day of our life there's things that change no matter our routines no matter our structures something new will take place every day Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we can wrap our hearts and our lives up in the great unchanging arms of the Living God you will protect us and shelter us from all harm and from evil in this last day now Lord as we look into the word I pray that the Holy Spirit will just come into this place this morning and take the little thing you placed in my life we call it a gift Lord let it be used to get me out of the way that I might be a microphone to speak to them those things which you want to say I pray that you'll anoint this congregation and that you'll anoint me that you'll give us the favor that we need is your children to receive from the engrafted word may become a part of as Lord as we walk out of here today may we be living Oracle's of the spirit of truth that is being spoke from this Bible and from the pages of the message and we thank you for brother Jesse and his sweet family Lord and is a wonderful kind pastor is always brother being you come by anytime you're ready the door is open for you thank you Lord for such a man of God and has endeavored in this area all these years Lord and reached out Lord as I look across this congregation the fruit of his labor is evident he has a congregation of real godly men and woman today a holding of the line holding this great standard of God up in the last day believing with all of their heart this message that's been committed in our hands as your children we thank you for this church body I pray you'll ever bless him that may the Holy Spirit ever increase some Lord and may God you just come this morning and do great things amongst us as we commit this day both this morning and this evening service to your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen god bless you may be seated amen and Lord make it good and cool for us amen amen I tell you worst place in the world for an air conditioner break is Ohio I promise I was born and raised here in the humidity or just about knock you out that's for sure I've been in some of them foreign countries where it's a hundred and twenty and I'd take that any day of the week over Ohio heat it's just the truth amen but we tough we're gonna handle it eight we really will work our way through it and we just thank the Lord because if it's hot a we want it to be hot in the spiritual wail as well don't we man and we want the Holy Spirit to be with us in every single way now III want to take for a little lesson here this morning just the Lord helping us upon this words in the second kind one to another now I'm just gonna take my time here for just a moment because I want to lay just a little bit of a foundation for you and then we will dig into this deeper as we go but you
