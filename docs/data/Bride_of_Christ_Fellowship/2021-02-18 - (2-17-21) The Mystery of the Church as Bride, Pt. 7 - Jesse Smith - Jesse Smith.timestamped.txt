[34:04] chapter i believe

[34:11] the shulamite maybe next wednesday
[34:14] by god's grace if the lord is willing
[34:16] that's what nature was referring to on
[34:18] sunday night
[34:19] wonderful job nature we remember that
[34:20] this week oh and then we read a
[34:21] scripture last night the very scripture
[34:24] that you mentioned about god's love we
[34:26] read that in our devotional last night
[34:28] so we thought of you last night praise
[34:30] god
[34:32] and then we'll look at lesson learned
[34:33] through other brides and wives and women
[34:35] in the bible
[34:36] there's many great lessons and then i
[34:38] want to just rehearse the proverbs 31
[34:40] woman it's a beautiful
[34:42] beautiful type and that's the end of the
[34:44] chapter then by god's grace just going
[34:46] through all these types
[34:48] as the church here types the bride of
[34:51] jesus christ what a revelation right
[34:53] so many people miss it but we're so
[34:55] grateful it's been delivered to us
[34:57] praise god
[34:58] ephesians 5 32 let's read that on three
[35:02] ready
[35:02] one two three this is a great mystery
[35:07] but i speak concerning christ and the
[35:10] church
[35:11] praise god go to james 5 7-8 that's our
[35:15] memory verse here for this week this
[35:17] month rather
[35:19] james five seven and eight
[35:33] james five seven and eight
[35:40] everybody got that can you say amen if
[35:42] you got that all right let's read that
[35:44] james 5 7 8 on 3 1 2 3
[35:48] be patient therefore brethren unto the
[35:51] coming of the lord
[35:52] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[35:55] precious fruit of the earth
[35:57] and hath long patience for it until he
[36:00] received the early and latter rain
[36:03] be ye also patient establish your hearts
[36:06] for the coming of the lord draweth nigh
[36:09] amen may god has
[36:10] blessings to read his word you may be
[36:12] seated praise god
[36:16] i do have a few quotes just to share
[36:17] tonight casey not too many but
[36:19] i got a few if you'd like to switch over
[36:24] here
[36:29] so lord willing tonight we'll look at
[36:31] this thought and i'll try to be careful
[36:32] the time
[36:33] about 30 minutes maybe we'll preach i'm
[36:35] pulling up this old slideshow used to
[36:37] have and i just because i
[36:38] just want to put some quotes in here uh
[36:40] you're probably familiar with that one
[36:42] it's been a few years since i preached
[36:43] that uh probably four years ago five
[36:45] years ago
[36:46] so i got some random quotes for tonight
[36:48] i'd like to share to kind of deal with
[36:49] this thought
[36:50] last wednesday we looked at some types
[36:53] we looked at
[36:54] sarah as the type of the bride of jesus
[36:57] christ and we saw the former latter
[36:59] reign
[37:00] then we saw rebecca as a type of the
[37:03] gentile bride and
[37:04] aznath and then we ended with rahab the
[37:07] gentile harlot last wednesday night
[37:10] as another type of the bride amen all
[37:13] these great beautiful types now
[37:14] tonight lord willing we'll spend a
[37:16] little more of our time on samson's
[37:18] uh philistine wife from timnath
[37:22] now according as far as i know in the
[37:24] scripture
[37:27] brother brahm never uses this type but i
[37:30] think kim preached it a few years ago
[37:32] and i can clearly see a type i just as
[37:35] he preached i can clearly see a type
[37:37] for the gentile bride so before i get to
[37:39] this i just want to read a few quotes
[37:41] where
[37:41] you know there's there's no doubt a
[37:44] large camp of
[37:45] branamites and i say that i say that in
[37:48] love but i feel like they worship
[37:50] brother branham
[37:51] where they if brother brahm doesn't say
[37:53] a word about it then they won't believe
[37:55] it
[37:55] they won't preach it and i think uh you
[37:58] find many books of the bible where
[37:59] brother brahm doesn't even mention them
[38:02] so you know you can't throw out parts of
[38:05] the bible and say well i don't believe
[38:06] that because brother branham you know
[38:08] i'm not going to read that because
[38:08] brother brahm didn't mention that i
[38:10] think that's a false idea
[38:12] i believe if brother branham came by the
[38:14] holy spirit
[38:15] and he gave us thus saith the lord on so
[38:18] many different subjects i think right
[38:19] now i got over 30 thus saith the lords
[38:21] from brother branham
[38:22] in the book now if we get 30 thus saith
[38:26] the lords we should be able
[38:28] to rightly divide many of these books
[38:31] and place them positionally especially
[38:33] because we have
[38:34] a lot of uh understanding about the
[38:36] seven church ages right
[38:38] and the blinding of the jews and the
[38:40] hundred forty four thousand the
[38:41] tribulation the rapture
[38:43] we have so much truth everything is
[38:45] rightly divided into all these great
[38:47] categories we should be able by the holy
[38:48] spirit
[38:49] to look at a scripture maybe brother
[38:51] brahm never mentioned it
[38:52] but with the help of the holy spirit we
[38:54] should be able to place it in its proper
[38:56] place and that's what i believe
[38:57] uh i believe if we're not constantly
[39:00] searching for that we're going to
[39:01] denominate and become a dead church
[39:04] that's what i believe if we don't
[39:05] constantly search for growing
[39:08] in grace and knowledge of the lord jesus
[39:10] christ i feel like we'll become a
[39:12] denomination
[39:12] and we don't want to become that uh
[39:15] we've got to be hungry and thirsty for
[39:17] more righteousness
[39:19] and uh i'll show you a quote brother
[39:21] brahm says that so you can understand
[39:23] that
[39:24] i don't ever want my children to think
[39:25] well this is it that's all god can do
[39:28] and that's all god can reveal in these
[39:30] 1156 sermons from brother braham
[39:32] that's all god can reveal i don't
[39:34] believe that i believe god can give us
[39:36] more revelation or more information
[39:38] about the same revelations praise god
[39:41] that's what i believe because that's
[39:42] what brother ram taught
[39:45] now here's just a just a simple quote
[39:46] where brother bram says he doesn't have
[39:48] all the answers
[39:50] right so they ask him in the questions
[39:52] and answers according to the fifth seal
[39:54] moses and elijah have to die what about
[39:55] enoch he said i don't know
[39:57] if i don't know i'm just going to tell
[39:58] you i don't know i don't know all the
[40:00] answers folks
[40:01] i don't know he says and if i don't know
[40:04] i'm going to tell you i don't know
[40:05] if i do know i won't tell you until i do
[40:08] know
[40:09] but i don't know i've often wondered
[40:10] that myself
[40:12] here's another one he says he says a man
[40:14] that tells you he has all the answers he
[40:16] said is a gimmick
[40:18] now i have a video i can show you the
[40:20] video from the 90s
[40:22] where brother rams family members some
[40:24] of his family members say
[40:25] every answer you have is on the tapes
[40:29] and that's such a lie that's such a lie
[40:31] not every answer is on the tapes
[40:34] if it was then you can just get rid of
[40:35] the bible right you don't need that
[40:38] so it's such a lie uh
[40:41] but jesus said there was many lepers in
[40:43] the days of elijah but only one was sent
[40:44] to him
[40:45] one many widows in the days of elisha
[40:47] but only one was sent
[40:49] he was only one sent two many things
[40:51] jesus did not do many times
[40:53] those gimmicks that's got every answer
[40:55] be careful
[40:56] when somebody stands up and speaks to
[40:58] the lord that must be true
[41:00] it must be exactly the truth how many
[41:02] believe that
[41:03] that's true if someone speaks in the
[41:04] name of the lord like uh
[41:07] joseph branham did then that has to be
[41:10] true or they're a liar
[41:11] right just like brother branham every
[41:13] time he said in the name of the lord
[41:14] it's got to be right
[41:16] if not he's a false prophet we know that
[41:18] but that's why we believe he was a true
[41:20] prophet
[41:20] was because every time he spake in the
[41:22] name of lord it was right
[41:24] but the point i'm trying to make is that
[41:26] if a person says they've got every
[41:27] answer
[41:28] they don't right even even the body of
[41:31] jesus didn't have all the answers
[41:34] right when's the day an hour only the
[41:36] father knows
[41:37] the angels don't know the son don't know
[41:40] only
[41:41] the father knows some answers right so
[41:44] even the flesh even the humanity of
[41:45] jesus christ did not have all the
[41:47] answers so any person that says all the
[41:49] answers on the tape
[41:50] is a liar they're lying not every answer
[41:52] is on the tape
[41:54] and what they're doing church is they're
[41:55] misinterpreting a quote i don't have the
[41:57] quote right here
[41:58] i should go find it but brother man
[42:01] makes a statement he says if you have a
[42:02] question about that subject the answer's
[42:04] on the tape
[42:05] so he's talking about one question they
[42:07] have he knows that one answer's on that
[42:09] tape so that's what he's talking about
[42:11] he's not saying every question you ever
[42:13] had in life is on the tapes because it's
[42:15] not
[42:16] it's not but that's just how these
[42:18] worshipers of branamites or branham's
[42:21] uh brother brown that's that's just how
[42:22] they operate they twist quotes all the
[42:24] time
[42:25] and that's how they get uh followers
[42:27] after themselves people that have
[42:28] itching ears that want to hear things
[42:30] that are not true so they keep to
[42:32] themselves teachers having itching ears
[42:35] here's a good quote i like to read
[42:36] brother i'm talking about a good friend
[42:38] of mine he calls him a lovely brother
[42:40] now look how brother ram treats people
[42:42] that disagree with him
[42:44] we've been called demases we've been
[42:46] called make believers because we don't
[42:48] believe in press and play
[42:49] and limiting the fifo ministry we
[42:52] believe in expanding the fivefold
[42:54] ministry
[42:54] amen just like the bible says amen we
[42:58] believe in that but because we don't
[42:59] we're grouped with all these churches
[43:01] that are called demas
[43:03] and make believers right but look how
[43:06] brother branham treated people that
[43:08] differed with him
[43:09] he said a lovely brother good man
[43:12] i don't don't dare say one word against
[43:14] the brother as a christian i wouldn't
[43:16] say nothing against him
[43:17] he don't agree with me on that subject
[43:18] he's my precious brother we eat together
[43:21] oh just a dandy fella i take his
[43:23] magazine read his articles he writes
[43:24] them a mind and so forth
[43:26] and i've took a many a text out of what
[43:28] i read from his articles
[43:30] hear him say he's a great man but he
[43:32] just can't agree with me
[43:34] i appreciate that of the sincerity
[43:36] though he just don't
[43:37] one of these pushover just have to agree
[43:40] with
[43:41] everything you say he's got his own
[43:44] conviction and he stands for it
[43:45] i appreciate that so my point is how
[43:47] many pushovers do we have around the
[43:49] message
[43:50] that they might see something where
[43:52] brother man was just you know teaching
[43:53] and
[43:54] he grew later revelation but because
[43:56] they're a pushover
[43:58] because they don't have any backbone
[44:00] they won't even though
[44:01] they'll believe both of them like i've
[44:03] i've
[44:05] interacted with many pushovers lately
[44:07] they believe the third person the
[44:09] trinity dwells in them
[44:10] and they believe that trinity's wrong
[44:11] they told me both
[44:14] now that's just a pushover friend that's
[44:15] just that's just the coward right
[44:17] the brother ram has quotes where he says
[44:20] the third person dwells in our hearts
[44:22] and so they believe the third person of
[44:24] the trinity dwells in their hearts but
[44:25] then they also believe that
[44:26] trinitarianism is of the devil
[44:28] now how can you believe both you
[44:29] shouldn't believe both right you should
[44:31] believe the third person of the trinity
[44:33] is a false idea you should be able to
[44:35] rightly divide the word where brother
[44:37] adam said
[44:38] this well he grew in revelation he was
[44:39] wrong and he understands it right later
[44:43] but see those are pushovers right and
[44:45] they got the wrong spirit because they
[44:47] can't rightly divide the word of god
[44:49] he said i appreciate that good man oh
[44:51] i'm not a teacher a scholar he said
[44:53] but this man is both teacher and scholar
[44:56] he says i can't agree with him because i
[44:57] don't see it but it doesn't pertain to
[44:59] salvation
[44:59] it's pertaining to the coming of the
[45:01] lord he sees that church has to go
[45:03] through the tribulation for purification
[45:05] i say the blood of jesus christ purify
[45:08] the church amen
[45:09] so all he said is he said i think the
[45:11] church has to go through the tribulation
[45:13] and brother adam doesn't name call him
[45:15] he calls him a lovely brother
[45:16] a good man now that to me that's the
[45:19] spirit of christ right there
[45:20] amen someone that he don't name call him
[45:23] demons you don't name call him judas
[45:24] iscariot right
[45:26] you don't name call him a mate believer
[45:28] he just says we differ on this thing
[45:30] right here
[45:30] he's a lovely brother may god help us to
[45:33] have the same holy spirit praise god
[45:35] the same kindness and sweetness of the
[45:38] holy spirit may god help us to have that
[45:41] i don't want to be a pushover where i
[45:43] worship william branham i don't worship
[45:44] william branham
[45:45] i worship jesus christ amen so so i'm
[45:48] not going to be a pushover
[45:50] and let the devil push me over into
[45:51] idolatry
[45:53] amen praise god i'm going to stand on my
[45:56] convictions
[45:56] in other words i'm going to stand on
[45:58] what the holy ghost reveals to me praise
[46:00] god
[46:02] now last one i think i got a couple more
[46:05] oh yeah a couple more now you remember
[46:07] this don't don't ever forget this from
[46:08] the church age book
[46:10] we know paul's first revelation was
[46:12] right
[46:14] god can't give a first revelation then a
[46:16] second revelation if he did
[46:18] he would be changing his mind he can
[46:20] give a revelation then add to it as he
[46:22] did in the garden of eden
[46:24] when he promised the seed to the woman
[46:25] and then later designated that seed had
[46:27] come through
[46:28] abraham and then later said it would
[46:30] come by the same bloodlines and david
[46:32] but it was the same revelation it only
[46:35] gave the people more information
[46:37] to help them receive it and understand
[46:38] it but god's word
[46:40] can't change amen okay so we just we i
[46:44] really like this quote because we can
[46:46] see it
[46:46] god won't give us second revelation he
[46:48] gives more information
[46:50] about the same revelation the first
[46:53] revelation
[46:54] and that's what god is doing today
[46:57] that's what god has been doing
[46:58] uh since brother ram left the scene
[47:00] giving us more
[47:01] revelation more information about the
[47:04] same revelation
[47:07] now here's one i was telling you i think
[47:08] this might that's the last one yeah
[47:10] that's the last one
[47:11] here's the one where church uh so many
[47:13] message people have missed this
[47:15] if we just limit our understanding to
[47:18] things on the tape
[47:19] where the holy spirit can't give more
[47:20] than what's on the tape will become a
[47:22] denomination
[47:24] because we'll stop seeking god for truth
[47:26] right we'll stop
[47:28] praying for understanding and so so to
[47:31] me this is a
[47:32] this is an issue of if people don't seek
[47:34] for more understanding
[47:36] they stop searching more
[47:39] truth right in other words they they cut
[47:41] off the holy spirit
[47:44] they cut off the spirit of truth and
[47:45] they say this is all that i can receive
[47:48] any more than that even though a
[47:50] revelation might line up with the word
[47:52] of god
[47:53] uh when they say no i can't receive it
[47:56] except brother adam said the exact words
[47:58] right there they can become a
[48:00] denomination and they can cut off the
[48:02] effects
[48:03] the further cleansing effects of the
[48:05] holy spirit
[48:06] hope i can just say it right let me just
[48:09] say like this they limit the holy one of
[48:11] israel can i say it like that
[48:12] amen praise god they become their own
[48:15] message denomination
[48:20] but america said that way when i speak
[48:21] against some domination
[48:23] or the denominational system it isn't
[48:25] the people in there
[48:27] it's the system that i'm against you see
[48:30] that holds them apart
[48:31] holds us from receiving see they drop
[48:34] their declaration
[48:35] say we believe this period
[48:39] if they would end it with a comma we
[48:41] believe this
[48:42] plus as much as the lord can show us out
[48:45] of his word
[48:46] it would be all right but if they do not
[48:50] but they do not do it that way you know
[48:51] that now let's just stop right there
[48:53] is that what a lot of message churches
[48:55] say we believe this
[48:56] plus anything god would add to it no
[48:59] they don't say that
[49:00] they just say we believe the message of
[49:01] brother graham's sermons and that's it
[49:04] they don't believe god can give them
[49:05] further revelation of this right here
[49:08] but that has to be our attitude and
[49:10] church if you have that attitude it'll
[49:12] keep you hungering for more of god
[49:15] but if you just limit god to just those
[49:18] 1156 sermons and the church age book and
[49:20] the seal book
[49:21] if you just limit it to that then you're
[49:23] likely just to denominate
[49:25] and not really hunger and thirst for
[49:27] more of the word anymore
[49:31] he says it would be all right if we say
[49:32] we believe this
[49:34] we believe the church age book the seven
[49:35] seal book all the books we believe all
[49:37] that plus
[49:38] as much as the lord can show us out of
[49:41] the word
[49:43] but they do not do it that way you know
[49:45] that so it even happened in brother
[49:46] braham say this is oh it's
[49:48] 63. he says uh it couldn't
[49:51] be a denomination and do that see it
[49:53] would just
[49:54] it would just be the move of god this is
[49:56] what i like moving on
[49:58] all the time you see amen you see that
[50:01] brother says
[50:02] we will be a continual living organism
[50:05] as long as we're seeking god for more
[50:07] revelation
[50:08] but if we don't see god for more
[50:10] revelation will die
[50:12] and denominate we'll put a period behind
[50:14] it praise god
[50:16] amen
[50:20] like in the years past god has revealed
[50:22] more scriptures to me
[50:24] about marriage and divorce that brother
[50:26] ram never preached
[50:27] and that has added more more information
[50:30] about the same revelation
[50:32] and to me that has brought me more
[50:34] understanding on marriage and divorce
[50:36] not a different revelation just the same
[50:38] revelation praise god
[50:40] amen hallelujah
[50:43] more on the godhead i'm trying to think
[50:45] of some examples on the godhead
[50:47] god's given us more revelation on the
[50:49] godhead god's given us more revelation
[50:51] on
[50:52] predestination that's for sure that's
[50:53] for sure because most people go on the
[50:55] side of well god
[50:56] chose you before the foundation world so
[50:58] it doesn't matter what you choose
[51:00] it certainly matters what you choose
[51:02] because you're supposed to make
[51:03] your calling and your election sure amen
[51:06] see it makes people lazy when they take
[51:08] this one quote
[51:10] uh from brother branham and they they
[51:11] fail to move on
[51:13] into other quotes and more scriptures
[51:15] that that brother bran may not have
[51:17] preached
[51:18] but people denominate and they they die
[51:21] and they no longer hunger for more souls
[51:23] to be filled with the holy ghost
[51:25] you know that's what's going to give us
[51:26] life when more people come in and get
[51:28] saved and get born again praise god
[51:30] that's going to give us a revival it's
[51:32] going to make us more excited to come to
[51:33] church praise god
[51:35] when we see somebody new come in and
[51:36] somebody or one of our
[51:38] children receive the holy ghost they're
[51:40] going to be stirred up they're going to
[51:41] love god they're going to love coming to
[51:43] church
[51:43] there's going to be fresh life in the
[51:44] camp amen
[51:47] hallelujah praise god i just can't wait
[51:48] till the next one amen
[51:50] because it gives us a fresh it gives
[51:52] them fresh power they come to church
[51:54] more excited right somebody's on fire
[51:56] somebody's saying amen a little louder
[51:58] praise god
[51:59] someone's just praying louder someone's
[52:01] praying more someone's singing louder
[52:03] seeing because there's
[52:04] fresh life that's brought that's been
[52:05] brought into the body
[52:07] and the body's got more life more power
[52:10] amen
[52:12] hallelujah praise god see this is what
[52:14] i'm striving for this is why i've got to
[52:15] get i've got to work myself into it
[52:17] as far as getting the holy spirit so
[52:19] that i don't die that i don't let myself
[52:22] become a denominational minded message
[52:24] believer
[52:25] right we've all got to do that brother
[52:27] says you can't live
[52:29] off your testimony from 20 years ago
[52:32] that's what's starting to happen to me
[52:33] you know my last trip to guyana was
[52:35] 2013.
[52:37] i'm just two two years away from that
[52:39] being 10 years ago and some of the
[52:40] biggest miracles i've seen
[52:42] at least through my prayers are going to
[52:43] be 10 years old if i'm not careful
[52:46] i can't if i'm not if i got to be
[52:48] careful not to live off those old
[52:50] testimonies
[52:51] in other words i got to be seeking god
[52:53] for more miracles amen
[52:55] for more testimonies for more moving of
[52:57] the holy spirit
[52:59] see i can't live off of those they're
[53:01] getting kind of old right
[53:02] i got romantic you got to have a fresh
[53:04] experience with god and brother man says
[53:07] uh he said you kind of got to picture
[53:09] yourself like the mana
[53:11] you know like how the mana fell every
[53:12] day you gotta have a fresh
[53:14] bite you gotta have a fresh meal as
[53:16] jesus said give us this day our daily
[53:18] bread amen
[53:20] we need a fresh revelation a fresh
[53:22] understanding every day
[53:26] so how many how many believe that we got
[53:28] to say
[53:29] i believe this plus as much as the lord
[53:31] can show me
[53:32] out of his word in fact that's how i end
[53:34] my book
[53:35] and just so you know i finished this
[53:36] week i finished yesterday no
[53:38] yeah i finished yesterday no i finished
[53:40] this morning i finished this morning
[53:42] and so i'm reaching out to the publisher
[53:43] tomorrow hopefully i can get a word back
[53:45] and
[53:45] get that published i finished after all
[53:47] these two years and two months my
[53:50] 26 months so it's been been brutal on me
[53:53] but it's teaching me patience so i'm
[53:56] excited by god's grace so
[53:58] i hope you enjoyed that i'll unplug
[53:59] there now you can pull up some
[54:00] scriptures lydia when we need them
[54:03] now let's go to uh judges 14 please
[54:06] let's go to judges 14.
[54:12] all right judges 14. now as i told you
[54:16] i'm going to preach this you'll you
[54:18] won't find this in brother man's message
[54:20] but it perfectly to me lines up with the
[54:23] message
[54:24] and we can't preach it it was it was
[54:26] just uh one of those
[54:27] simulations of revelation
[54:31] it just gave me such joy praise god like
[54:33] last time cam was here with the wise and
[54:35] foolish virgins
[54:36] and every time brother simon preaches he
[54:37] always brings a fresh revelation
[54:39] gives me such joy of the lord i hope
[54:41] that's how you feel
[54:43] now samson's
[54:47] philistine wife from timnath types
[54:50] jesus gentile bride now don't let this
[54:52] stumble you because remember
[54:54] brother branham said ruth typed the
[54:56] bride and she was a moabite
[54:58] right rahab
[55:01] uh she was a harlot a gentile harlot i'm
[55:04] not even sure her background actually
[55:06] does anybody know what was her does
[55:08] anyone know or what country she was out
[55:09] of
[55:11] i don't remember so anyways
[55:15] azimuth egyptian right they were filthy
[55:18] they were idolaters
[55:20] but god uses azenath as a type of us
[55:23] amen so what i'm trying to say is no
[55:25] matter which gentile group
[55:27] jesus proves to use as a type of us
[55:30] we want to be thankful that the type
[55:32] shows were brought
[55:34] into marriage with christ amen
[55:37] that's the beautiful type
[55:40] let's go to judges 14 verse 1.
[55:45] let's read one to four how about we get
[55:46] some readers out there malcolm eat your
[55:48] bible
[55:48] that'll save my voice a little bit
[55:54] judges 14.
[55:57] now guy can you read verses one to four
[55:59] i'm just getting there myself so
[56:01] whenever you're ready buddy fourteen one
[56:03] to four
[56:28] is
[56:42] hey man well i love verse four that's
[56:44] beautiful
[56:45] now look samson's parents were shocked
[56:48] why does he take a
[56:50] a jewish wife what's wrong with the
[56:51] jewish wife well we find out in verse
[56:53] four
[56:54] god is trying to bring judgment upon the
[56:56] philistines
[56:58] right so he's got to take a gentile wife
[57:01] in order to do this got to have samson
[57:02] rather take a gentile wife
[57:05] so it's god's plan god is doing great
[57:08] things how many believe god's got great
[57:09] plans out there
[57:10] and sometimes we don't understand them
[57:13] right
[57:14] why would this happen why would this
[57:15] person do that how what in the world
[57:18] what were they thinking
[57:19] many times church that's god behind it
[57:21] amen
[57:23] praise the lord because god wanted
[57:26] samson to help destroy the philistines
[57:30] and deliver
[57:31] israel and so we can see the spiritual
[57:34] type god's purpose
[57:35] to take a gentile bride was in mercy
[57:38] to the bride not judgment but god must
[57:41] pour out his wrath upon the gentiles
[57:44] during the tribulation
[57:45] because they've rejected his spirit
[57:47] right he's got to pour out wrath
[57:49] so he's got to work this out he's got to
[57:51] take a gentile bride
[57:53] and they've got to mistreat the bride
[57:54] and that's something wow right there
[57:55] they're going to mistreat the bride
[57:57] right and because of that brother
[57:59] brother said uh
[58:01] brother brahm said when the holy spirit
[58:03] said pick up your pen and write
[58:05] he said once they tell the bride she
[58:07] can't preach anymore
[58:09] that's when jesus comes to pour out his
[58:11] wrath on him
[58:12] amen once once they they gather around
[58:15] the woman and say
[58:16] you can't preach anymore you can't talk
[58:17] about jesus you can't talk about your
[58:19] husband anymore jesus says fine i'm
[58:21] going to snatch your way and i'm going
[58:22] to pour out my wrath upon you
[58:24] amen same thing here
[58:27] you'll hear in the scriptures so see the
[58:30] because they've
[58:32] uh they've mistreated the bride because
[58:34] they mistreated
[58:35] them god has to pour out judgment now
[58:37] verse 3
[58:38] said samson chose his wife because she
[58:40] pleased him
[58:41] how many know the bride pleases jesus
[58:44] aren't you glad that your worship
[58:46] touches the heart of god
[58:48] aren't you glad he delights in your
[58:50] prayers amen praise god
[58:53] he honors church he honors your
[58:56] obedience
[58:56] he loves your obedience we looked at
[58:58] that a few weeks ago on that snowy
[59:00] morning right
[59:00] a snowy morning how god delights your
[59:04] sacrifices are a sweet smelling savor
[59:07] in god's nostrils see she walks in the
[59:10] spirit and not the flesh that's pleasing
[59:13] in the eyes
[59:14] of the lord your dedicated walk proves
[59:18] you have the spirit of christ
[59:19] and that you belong to him paul says
[59:22] believers i'm sorry paul taught
[59:24] believers how to please god
[59:25] through his commandments and sacrificing

[1:01:40] that's why i always preach on that give
[1:01:42] to others whether it's just a little bit
[1:01:43] of money or a little bit of your time
[1:01:44] or a meal or something constantly

[1:01:58] you giving things to other people
[1:02:00] that's how you can positively know i'm
[1:02:02] part of the bride that pleases
[1:02:04] the husband jesus christ that's right
[1:02:07] oh i love that now before marrying this
[1:02:11] woman
[1:02:12] the spirit of the lord comes upon samson
[1:02:15] so can we all go to uh back to judges
[1:02:18] 14.
[1:02:24] lydia can you read verses five six and
[1:02:26] seven look what i love this look look
[1:02:27] what happens
[1:02:28] samson wants to take this bride but
[1:02:30] what's gotta happen before he takes a
[1:02:32] gentile bride amen let me go ahead
[1:02:35] verses 5 6 and 7.
[1:02:55] amen so before marrying the
[1:02:59] gentile the spirit of god comes upon him
[1:03:02] he slays a young lion who roared against
[1:03:04] him
[1:03:05] after a short meeting
[1:03:09] uh with the bride oh you got to keep
[1:03:10] reading yeah verse 8 and after a time he
[1:03:12] returned to take her and turned aside to
[1:03:14] see the carcass of the line and behold
[1:03:16] there was a swarm of bees and honey in
[1:03:18] the carcass of the lion
[1:03:19] and he took thereof in his hands and
[1:03:21] went on eating and came to his father
[1:03:22] and mother and he gave them
[1:03:24] and they did eat but he told them not
[1:03:26] that he had taken the honey out of the
[1:03:28] carcass of the lion
[1:03:30] so his father went down into the woman
[1:03:32] and samson made there a feast so
[1:03:34] for so used the young men to do
[1:03:37] oh yeah to do and it came to pass when
[1:03:40] they saw him that they brought 30
[1:03:41] companions to be with him
[1:03:43] so after this little meeting samson
[1:03:46] finds bees and honey in the lion's
[1:03:48] carcass
[1:03:49] he eats it shares with his parents
[1:03:50] doesn't tell him where he got it
[1:03:52] now look the slain line represents what
[1:03:55] god
[1:03:55] delivering jesus the lion of the tribe
[1:03:58] of judah
[1:03:59] to be slain before the gentile marriage
[1:04:03] praise god so you catch that
[1:04:06] what a strange story this is now here
[1:04:08] this proves this has to be right
[1:04:10] because out in the world that no one
[1:04:11] understands this story why would god
[1:04:14] put this story amen of a strong
[1:04:17] supernatural jew marrying a gentile
[1:04:20] bride amen
[1:04:21] why would god put that story in the
[1:04:23] bible because he was foretelling
[1:04:26] prophetically and my bible says
[1:04:28] this was eleven hundred years before god
[1:04:30] did it
[1:04:32] right so eleven hundred years before god
[1:04:35] took a
[1:04:35] gentile wife and jesus took a gentile
[1:04:38] bride
[1:04:38] he foreshadowed it in the life of samson
[1:04:41] i can say amen to that
[1:04:45] glory bye this is awesome
[1:04:48] now acts 2 3 i'm sorry acts 2 23 says
[1:04:51] jesus
[1:04:52] was delivered by the determinant council
[1:04:55] and for knowledge of god to be crucified
[1:04:58] and slain so this line was delivered to
[1:05:00] samson right the bible says
[1:05:02] so is christ delivered to be slain
[1:05:08] now i love this inside of the lion he
[1:05:11] found
[1:05:11] all this delicious honey right
[1:05:15] well what do you find in christ you find
[1:05:17] unsearchable riches
[1:05:19] you find spiritual treasures and you
[1:05:21] find delicious
[1:05:22] revelations from jesus's death
[1:05:26] right peter says god's word has a
[1:05:28] gracious taste
[1:05:30] in first peter 2 verses 2 and 3. amen
[1:05:33] he said taste and see that the lord is
[1:05:36] gracious amen
[1:05:38] hallelujah the slain lamb right the
[1:05:40] slave left
[1:05:41] the the crucifixion is so there there's
[1:05:44] great truths in there
[1:05:45] amen like brother ram was saying not
[1:05:48] just forgive some of your sins
[1:05:50] he said the blood of jesus christ is
[1:05:51] like bleach and it washes away all your
[1:05:54] sins amen there's great truths down in
[1:05:56] there
[1:05:56] praise god he's forgiven you all your
[1:05:59] trespasses
[1:06:01] there's delicious revelations in there
[1:06:05] remember john now here's where we're
[1:06:07] getting to our day john was commanded to
[1:06:09] eat the open book
[1:06:10] right formerly sealed with seven seals
[1:06:13] and testified it tasted like
[1:06:15] broccoli no it tasted like honey
[1:06:20] in revelation 10 verse 10. so one of
[1:06:23] these revelations
[1:06:24] they taste so good to us right they give
[1:06:26] us such hope they give us such
[1:06:28] joy such revelation but they come
[1:06:31] out of a slain lamb there it is that
[1:06:33] land that was slain
[1:06:35] how'd the book get open how these
[1:06:36] revelations come forth a lamb
[1:06:38] stood in revelation 5 as it was slain
[1:06:41] praise god
[1:06:42] and then he come and took the book and
[1:06:44] opened the book thereof
[1:06:46] and then john ate it and said it tastes
[1:06:48] like honey praise god
[1:06:50] oh my thank the lord i don't know you're
[1:06:53] going to hear this in the denomination
[1:06:55] church
[1:06:55] you're only going to hear this in the
[1:06:56] message of the hour praise god
[1:07:00] the story makes no sense to any
[1:07:02] denominational church remember that list
[1:07:04] of anglicans and catholics and
[1:07:06] mormons this story makes no sense to
[1:07:08] them but we can see it plainly
[1:07:10] it types the opening of the seven sealed
[1:07:13] book hallelujah
[1:07:18] so samson hosts a seven-day wedding
[1:07:21] feast right
[1:07:23] so let's read that
[1:07:26] verse 12 and samson said to them i will
[1:07:29] now put forth a riddle unto you
[1:07:31] if you can certainly declare it me
[1:07:33] within the seven days of the feast and
[1:07:35] find it out then i will give you 30
[1:07:36] sheets
[1:07:37] and 30 chains of garments but if you
[1:07:39] cannot declare it me then shall ye give
[1:07:41] me 30 sheets and 30 chains
[1:07:43] of garments and they send him put forth
[1:07:45] thy riddle that we may hear it
[1:07:47] and he said to them out of the eater
[1:07:49] came forth meat
[1:07:51] and out of the strong came for sweetness
[1:07:53] and they could not in three days expound
[1:07:55] the riddle
[1:07:56] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:08:00] so notice this they can't figure out the
[1:08:02] the riddle
[1:08:04] or the mystery of the bridegroom
[1:08:08] jesus is the bridegroom right and he had
[1:08:11] a riddle for 2000 years they couldn't
[1:08:13] figure it out this riddle
[1:08:15] it could only be revealed on the seventh
[1:08:17] day or in the seventh church age praise
[1:08:20] god
[1:08:23] my church remember that only the first
[1:08:25] church age knew god was one person
[1:08:28] and then for the next six or next five
[1:08:30] church ages you know they
[1:08:32] they wondered oh we just can't figure
[1:08:34] out this such a riddle is he trinity is
[1:08:36] was he two persons three persons more
[1:08:38] persons
[1:08:39] they couldn't figure it out until the
[1:08:42] seventh church age
[1:08:43] that's when it was revealed praise god
[1:08:48] oh it's a beautiful type what a
[1:08:51] beautiful time
[1:08:58] so on the 30 day i'm sorry i'm sorry the
[1:09:00] 30. you get the challenge of 30
[1:09:02] philistine men
[1:09:05] they were confounded six days on the
[1:09:06] seventh they secretly threatened to burn
[1:09:09] the bride's
[1:09:10] father's house if she didn't get the
[1:09:13] answer from samson
[1:09:14] for them so let's read that
[1:09:20] verse 15 to 16. and it came to pass on
[1:09:22] the seventh day that they sent unto
[1:09:23] samson's wife enticed thy husband
[1:09:25] that he may declare unto us the riddle
[1:09:27] lest we should burn thee in thy father's
[1:09:29] house with fire
[1:09:30] have he called us to take that we have
[1:09:32] is it not so i just caught it right
[1:09:34] there
[1:09:36] the whole world has to receive the
[1:09:38] revelation of this message
[1:09:40] right before the end of the world can
[1:09:42] come praise god
[1:09:44] jesus said this revelation must be
[1:09:46] preached to every nation
[1:09:48] and then shall the end come praise god
[1:09:52] hallelujah there it is
[1:09:56] thank the lord see you so why were they
[1:09:58] wanted there wanted because
[1:10:00] they have to be a witness they have to
[1:10:02] uh testify that they got a chance to
[1:10:04] hear
[1:10:04] even though they reject it they got a
[1:10:06] chance to hear it
[1:10:09] and then the judgment could come because
[1:10:10] of what they did with it they mistreated
[1:10:12] the bride right
[1:10:13] with the revelation they mistreated the
[1:10:15] bride
[1:10:16] now look at verse 16 and samson's wife
[1:10:18] wept before him and said thou dost
[1:10:20] but hate me and loves me not thou has
[1:10:22] put forth a riddle unto the children of
[1:10:24] my people
[1:10:24] and it's not told at me and he said unto
[1:10:26] her behold i have not told it
[1:10:29] to my father nor my mother and shall i
[1:10:31] tell thee and she wept before them the
[1:10:33] seven days
[1:10:34] while their feasts lasted and it came to
[1:10:36] pass in the seventh day that he told her
[1:10:38] because she lay sore upon him and she
[1:10:40] told the riddle to the children
[1:10:42] of her people and the men in the city
[1:10:44] said unto him
[1:10:45] on the seventh day before the sun went
[1:10:47] down what is sweeter than honey
[1:10:48] and what is stronger than a lion and he
[1:10:51] said to them if ye had not plowed with
[1:10:53] my heifer
[1:10:54] ye had not found out my riddle
[1:10:57] you messed with my bride that's how you
[1:10:58] got the answer right
[1:11:01] verse 19 and the spear lord came upon
[1:11:04] him and he went down to ashkelon
[1:11:06] and what'd he do he slew 30 of them
[1:11:09] right
[1:11:10] so the spirit lord come upon samson and
[1:11:12] he destroyed those men
[1:11:14] for mistreating his wife
[1:11:18] see took their spoil and gave change of
[1:11:21] garments under
[1:11:22] which expounded the riddle and his anger
[1:11:24] was kindled and he went up to his
[1:11:26] father's house but samson's wife was
[1:11:27] given to his companion
[1:11:28] whom he had used as his friend so
[1:11:30] remember not all types are all perfect
[1:11:32] types
[1:11:33] but we see a lot of truth inside here
[1:11:37] right the bride cries she gets the
[1:11:39] answer
[1:11:40] shares it with them samson realized
[1:11:42] what's happened
[1:11:43] he still pays the garments but
[1:11:45] afterwards he goes down and slays those
[1:11:47] gentiles those
[1:11:49] those filthy gentiles right for
[1:11:50] mistreating his bride
[1:11:53] so where is this fulfilled in the times
[1:11:55] of the gentiles around 53
[1:11:57] a.d to the present day this seven-day
[1:12:00] feast is the seven church ages
[1:12:02] samson's riddle is the mystery of god
[1:12:05] spoken of in revelation 10
[1:12:07] 7 that can only be revealed on the
[1:12:09] seventh and final day
[1:12:10] or the last church age john took the
[1:12:13] open book
[1:12:14] revealed the truth that denominations
[1:12:16] had lost for centuries
[1:12:19] and he eats and prophesies them again
[1:12:21] around the world
[1:12:24] i believe uh my book is a part of this
[1:12:27] taking around the world
[1:12:28] now we got email we didn't have email
[1:12:30] brotherham's day but just like today
[1:12:32] i can uh send an email to a foreign
[1:12:34] country and they have my modesty book
[1:12:36] today i just did that today i do that
[1:12:37] all the time
[1:12:38] i get to send it to zimbabwe i sent to
[1:12:40] nigeria last week i sent it
[1:12:42] all over we're taking the reveal word of
[1:12:44] god and sending it around the world
[1:12:46] praise god faster than it can ever go
[1:12:48] otherwise now just as samson's wife was
[1:12:52] the only one who had the answer to the
[1:12:54] riddle
[1:12:55] only christ's bride has the revelation
[1:12:57] of the previously sealed
[1:12:59] seven seal book or the bible the bride
[1:13:03] had to lay before samson and seek his
[1:13:05] love in order to get the revelation i
[1:13:06] like that
[1:13:07] amen brother brahma had to lay before
[1:13:10] jesus
[1:13:10] amen i don't know for eight days he shut
[1:13:13] in and
[1:13:14] uh brother did until he got the
[1:13:16] revelation of the seven seals amen
[1:13:19] i like that
[1:13:22] now we must stay before the presence of
[1:13:25] god
[1:13:26] like mary right the sister of lazarus
[1:13:28] she laid at the feet of jesus
[1:13:30] and everything she received that was
[1:13:31] real to her satan couldn't take
[1:13:33] from her it was revelation
[1:13:36] and we only find these rich sweet
[1:13:39] revelations being preached by jesus's
[1:13:41] bride
[1:13:42] for out of the eater jesus came forth
[1:13:44] meat
[1:13:45] and sweetness and remember what is
[1:13:48] strong meat brother can't preach it when
[1:13:49] he was here
[1:13:50] it's out of hebrews five strong meat is
[1:13:52] being able to judge
[1:13:54] between good and evil amen
[1:14:01] that's like today people you know like
[1:14:02] even people today they can't even judge
[1:14:05] uh simple little things about the word
[1:14:07] of god
[1:14:08] they can't even judge about what uh
[1:14:10] branham tabernacle is putting out they
[1:14:12] can't even judge it
[1:14:13] other churches that well uh brother
[1:14:15] brown is going to return in ministry
[1:14:17] they can't even judge these things right
[1:14:19] why can't they judge it because they
[1:14:21] don't have the meat praise god they
[1:14:23] don't have the meat
[1:14:24] they didn't go back to calvary amen they
[1:14:26] never had a real experience
[1:14:28] like samson like like like uh the
[1:14:30] getting the honey itself
[1:14:32] they never went back to the carcass they
[1:14:34] never went to calvary
[1:14:35] they never had a real sincere
[1:14:37] relationship with jesus christ
[1:14:38] where christ gave them the real honey of
[1:14:40] the word
[1:14:43] hallelujah praise god they never really
[1:14:46] got it
[1:14:49] i believe that they can't discern good
[1:14:51] and evil
[1:14:52] like i was saying earlier all the
[1:14:54] message churches now that's recently
[1:14:56] they start watching the super bowl they
[1:14:57] don't have enough discernment
[1:14:59] to know that right or wrong because
[1:15:01] they're not eating
[1:15:02] of the honey of god's word it's just an
[1:15:05] intellectual understanding to them
[1:15:07] it's not really honey it's not really
[1:15:09] food let me say like this
[1:15:11] they're not really eating the word when
[1:15:12] they come to service it's just it's
[1:15:14] coming up here
[1:15:15] but it's not going down may god help it
[1:15:17] for us to go all the way down to the
[1:15:19] stomach praise god
[1:15:20] all the way down where it becomes a part
[1:15:22] of you right where you
[1:15:24] and you digest it it becomes a part of
[1:15:26] you
[1:15:27] and it becomes you praise god you're
[1:15:29] given strength because you
[1:15:30] fully digested the word of god not just
[1:15:33] the head knowledge
[1:15:35] amen why can't they discern it's their
[1:15:38] it's witchcraft in those games why can't
[1:15:40] they
[1:15:41] why can't they discern there's
[1:15:42] witchcraft in that music they listen to
[1:15:44] why can't they discern that
[1:15:45] because they haven't tasted of the honey
[1:15:47] of god's word
[1:15:50] the bible said
[1:15:53] david said in psalm 119 103 how sweet
[1:15:56] are thy words which
[1:15:58] i'm sorry unto my taste yay sweeter than
[1:16:01] honey
[1:16:01] to my mouth oh my hallelujah
[1:16:06] thank the lord for that the church
[1:16:08] that's what we should see when we come
[1:16:09] to the house of god and
[1:16:10] when we read our bibles in the morning
[1:16:12] it should be like hunting to us it
[1:16:14] should be so sweet
[1:16:15] you should think oh my i never seen this
[1:16:17] before or i forgot about this thank god
[1:16:19] for the promises of god
[1:16:21] like just this morning i was reading
[1:16:22] matthew 24. i got so many different
[1:16:24] revelations out of there
[1:16:26] it's like a brand new chapter to me
[1:16:27] praise god i just i even even texted to
[1:16:29] my wife tonight before church i said
[1:16:31] this is all new to me
[1:16:32] this is fresh honey for me praise god i
[1:16:35] feel like i finally understand that for
[1:16:37] all these years of struggling
[1:16:38] with matthew 24 it's fresh revelation
[1:16:41] it's sweet tasting honey
[1:16:43] it's sweeter than honey to my mouth amen
[1:16:50] so back to the story samson destroys 30
[1:16:52] men for
[1:16:53] threatening his bride and that fulfills
[1:16:58] or that will be fulfilled when jesus
[1:17:00] destroys
[1:17:01] these nations in the tribulation when
[1:17:04] heaven's wrath is poured out upon all
[1:17:06] those
[1:17:07] who tried to persecute christ's bride
[1:17:12] remember yeah let's go to revelation 18
[1:17:14] real quick uh revelation 18.
[1:17:16] the bible says the voice of the bride
[1:17:19] will not be heard anymore in her right
[1:17:25] so see the voice of the bride is trying
[1:17:27] to get in there
[1:17:28] the word of god is trying to get to them
[1:17:30] but there's going to come a time where
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:32] bride's voice is cut off
[1:17:52] all right look there it is yeah verse 23
[1:17:54] revelation 18 23 took me a few seconds
[1:17:56] to find that so forgive me that's just
[1:17:58] coming to my mind here
[1:17:59] and the light of a candle shall shine no
[1:18:01] more at all in thee
[1:18:02] and the voice of the bridegroom and of
[1:18:04] the bride shall be heard no more at
[1:18:07] all in thee for thy merchants were the
[1:18:10] great men of the earth
[1:18:11] for by thy sorceries were all nations
[1:18:14] deceived
[1:18:15] and in her was found the blood of
[1:18:16] prophets and of saints and of
[1:18:18] all that were slain upon the earth
[1:18:21] praise god
[1:18:23] so we can clearly see this jesus is
[1:18:26] going to get revenge upon this woman
[1:18:28] right
[1:18:28] this false church all these nations all
[1:18:30] these false
[1:18:32] all these gentiles that were evil that
[1:18:33] tried to come against the bride
[1:18:35] he's going to take that voice to the
[1:18:36] bride they're not going to hear the
[1:18:37] voice of the bride anymore and he's
[1:18:39] going to pour out tribulation and
[1:18:41] judgment upon
[1:18:42] the false church and her daughters right
[1:18:44] because we know that jesus said
[1:18:46] another revelation i'm going to cast her
[1:18:48] and her children
[1:18:49] into a bed with those nations that's
[1:18:51] another revelation from revelation
[1:18:53] chapter 2.
[1:18:58] amen so church what do we see in here
[1:19:02] we see another great beautiful picture
[1:19:05] of christ
[1:19:06] and his bride it's a mystery and i'll
[1:19:09] give this challenge to anybody somebody
[1:19:11] show me where a denomination
[1:19:12] has preached judges 14
[1:19:16] and can make it say what we saw here
[1:19:18] tonight
[1:19:19] where it perfectly types into seven
[1:19:21] church ages a seven day feast seven
[1:19:24] church ages
[1:19:25] with the mystery coming at the last
[1:19:27] church age
[1:19:28] to the seventh angel right the seventh
[1:19:31] day the seventh church age
[1:19:33] and it tastes like honey there's honey
[1:19:35] coming out of the slain lamb or the same
[1:19:38] lion amen
[1:19:39] there's honey and we're supposed to eat
[1:19:41] the honey on the seventh day
[1:19:42] from the seven church age messenger what
[1:19:45] do we have we have a bible that's
[1:19:46] revealed to us
[1:19:47] we have a bible that the seals are off
[1:19:49] and we're feasting
[1:19:51] on the sweet tasting honey that's coming
[1:19:53] out of the lion praise god
[1:19:55] amen let's stand i better stop right
[1:19:57] there
[1:19:58] oh thank you just it's simulation by
[1:20:01] revelation
[1:20:02] praise god amen
[1:20:06] it's a ministry of the church as the
[1:20:09] bride who would have thought
[1:20:10] samson's timnith wife
[1:20:14] would have been a type of you and i the
[1:20:16] gentile bride
[1:20:19] not many would have thought that church
[1:20:20] but we're grateful that we can do our
[1:20:22] part
[1:20:24] and now to me this is even more personal
[1:20:26] because now i see my book and my
[1:20:28] ministry

[1:20:30] because i haven't denominated

[1:20:38] of my duty
[1:20:40] to take this revelation and make sure
[1:20:41] the revelation gets spread around the
[1:20:43] world
