========================================

but I think I promise everybody I'll try to preach a little shorter tonight because I've got some food preparations for tomorrow thank God it's only seven here so that's a good sign it's a real good sign so let's go to first Thessalonians 5 18 and then after that we'll go to Ephesians 1 verse 4. first Thessalonians 5 18. Thanksgiving of course is always a special time of the year for me that's the time I heard the message of the hours in fact the very day I heard the message of the hour so many years ago so just a special day for me always always will be praise God so thank God for his grace amen for Thessalonians 5 verse 18. if you have your Bibles let's read that on three ready one two three in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4. after that we'll just have a word of prayer and have you be seated here anytime we're giving thanks we we know we're in God's will don't you like that feeling I just love that feeling like when I go pray in the closet or something like I go in there and I can say I know I'm in the will of God there's no devil in hell that can tell me I'm out of God's will because I'm obeying the commands of God same is true tonight if you come to give God thanks you know you're doing God's will tonight what a blessing Hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you for every good and perfect gift Hallelujah Ephesians 1 verse four let's read this if we can on three one two three according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love may God has blessings the Ring of his word you may be seated God bless you Hallelujah I just have a couple uh slides here I'm gonna mainly be preaching here this is the thought I preached on Sunday we went to the Baptist Church and had a real good time by God's grace like I said we heard that two people that I sent prayer cloths to had been healed I don't know what they were sick with but God healed them and a woman come up and tell me that right before service so I was thankful for that and the pastor texted me and said he just thoroughly enjoyed everything so it's a real blessing to be a light and and uh you know I've I've thrown around a few ideas but I'm hoping at some point they'll come to our church by God's grace and I mean full time so that's that's that's my prayer I've been praying that since I met the brother I haven't bring that off and on since he's just a good man and uh just trusting that God will do something there for him so I want to just speak on this this was my thought for Sunday thankful to be chosen in Christ I'll try to watch my time here um you know as soon as I uh finish the sermon two weeks ago in Indiana I got a text from the pastor saying can you preach for me and I thought why do you have brother Brian coming so yes that'd worked out and as soon as I send them a text the thought came to me thankful to be chosen in Christ it's just kind of like last week isolation just came to me that word just came to me and you were talking about that with Austin right Chris and so I text the brother I said yes I want to preach on thankful to be chosen in Christ and so and then after I preached the pastor come up and said you know what brother Jesse said a couple weeks ago that very same scripture came to my mind and I wanted to preach about what happened before the foundation of the world he said you just preached the message that God already gave me so I said I said well praise God I don't really like taking people's sermons I just like preaching the ones that God gives me but I said well praise God I'm glad we're on the same idea there and saying the same wave wavelength and the same thoughts so it was a real blessing there to be there and what a wonderful time with brother Brian praise God I listen to both messages and I really enjoyed them so it was a real blessing by God's grace and I'll be sharing you know I had Brian pray for me and I'll just share a little testimony at the end just how it's helped me already this week it's just been wonderful uh to see how God uh sends the word praise God he just sends the word at the right time and the right season amen so I want to encourage everybody you know as we approach tomorrow to be thankful for all that we have you know I've heard different preachers and different people text me this week and say this is their favorite holiday and I I don't know it's kind of hard you know there are such great holidays how can you be Easter I mean how can you beat the resurrection I'm not sure how you could beat that but the point is you know it's a nice holiday where there's you it's it's really not intermingled with a lot of uh evil things other than football you know and uh uh Good Friday or I'm sorry uh Black Friday shopping that's I think that's the wicked most wicked things you know that come out of Thanksgiving but um you know I think it's I like how it's highly valued amongst uh preachers and and the saints of God uh we want to thank God for all of the blessings that we have uh this year you know we are inflicted by I'm sorry infected we are we are affected by inflation so I guess we could say infected as well uh thanks to this leadership in the in the white house but um you know despite those challenges God has been very gracious to us in this nation and so we want to thank God for our health we want to thank God for the food that we have and uh the jobs that we have I was raised on food stamps most of my life and so uh it was very difficult life you know I didn't have all the food we could eat all the time I never went hungry but looking at the life I have now I can thank God I can see God has added so much to me and I never want to forget where I came from you know so I want to give God thanks and praise you know today my family lacks nothing really whatever the ACT if it's an actual need not a one no not a one but any actual need we can get it at a drop of a hat and that is all praise to the Lord Jesus Christ so we have so much to be thankful for I'm going to look at spiritual blessings tonight but don't forget natural blessings praise God we want to remember that you know we are 401 years since the first unofficial Thanksgiving okay that was between the Puritans and the Wampa panoag people which of course that included Samoset Squanto and different ones that had taught the Puritan's survival uh so many years ago but remember the the the the Thanksgiving beforehand wasn't a Thanksgiving the year before that it was an awful time the Puritans were sleeping on the ship at night time and then they would they would row out to the uh to Plymouth there to Massachusetts and they would they would work during the day and then go back out to the ship and sleep on the ship at night it was such an awful winner though over half of them died there was a hundred two Puritans that came over over half of them died due to malnutrition scurvy and other causes I think there was only four married women that actually survived that winter so that's very difficult to reproduce you know with only four married women but the next year you know Squanto Samoset showed them how to survive now Church what if they would have quit that first winner there what if they would have chose ingratitude instead of gratitude what if they would have chose to curse God instead of bless God we wouldn't be here today we wouldn't have this nation we wouldn't have all those blessings I named earlier we wouldn't have them right now and church this is a great lesson we should take to heart that even in our darkest hour we must find a way to give thanks because if they'd accurs God then this nation would have been cursed but because they bless God hallelujah we're blessed today amen and see another uh a brighter day was coming amen hallelujah a better season was coming a a more a more blessed time was coming a time of prosperity was coming church and let's look at it spiritually a time of spiritual growth is coming amen hallelujah a return of spiritual Power is coming praise God you've got to believe it you've got to press through the dark times you gotta you gotta make it through you got to just believe you cannot quit you must persevere if you want a good season Hallelujah they did it they didn't curse God imagine losing half of your friends all in one winter they never gave up they chose thankfulness and we see how blessed we are today because of their sacrifice so we return to give thanks this Thanksgiving Hallelujah and we give God all the praise and all the glory so if ever a people could say in everything give thanks this is the will of God in Christ Jesus it was the Puritans amen who found a way to give thanks when they had hardly any natural blessings they look forward to the spiritual blessings and God bless them abundantly praise God now uh if you go to Ephesians 1 we'll go there briefly here Ephesians one now our our verse was verse four but I'm gonna read verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so I want you to see God here has blessed us hallelujah we bless God because God has blessed us and he hasn't given us some spiritual blessings but all spiritual blessings but where are they sometimes it's hard to see him with our with our busy lives our cell phones and the TV screens and and the job requirements sometimes it's hard to see the spiritual blessings but Paul tells us where they are they're in heaven amen hallelujah I'll tell you I'll tell you where the blessings are they're in the bosom of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and he pours out those blessings when you when you and I offer up the prayers of the Saints amen when the prayers goes up the blessings come down hallelujah amen so that's what the Bible plainly tells us that and they're all located in heaven we just got to ask for them because the Bible says we have not because we ask not whatever spiritual need we have whatever spiritual blessing we have keep asking God keep trusting God because the Bible said all of them are yours but they're in Heavenly places and you must wait till it's Heaven's time until it comes down to you praise God amen verse 4 according to see hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should obey I'm sure that we should be holy we should obey we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so notice God chose us in him before the world was founded or set in its position and and he wanted us when he chose us he knew we'd be holy which means separated from the world that's why we have very little interaction with the world okay they they might think we're crazy but I'd rather have them think I'm crazy than the to make myself worldly praise God I'd rather have that I'd rather be holy and separate and the Bible said Without Blame so Satan can't put any blame on me and you in heaven praise God because God chose us before the foundation of the world praise God and if God chose us the devil can't unchoose us amen the devil didn't choose me so he can't get rid of me praise God God chose me so he's going to keep me amen glory amen I wasn't Chosen and saved him before the foundation of the world I was chosen in Jesus Christ amen before the foundation of the world Hallelujah that I should be holy and I should be without blame Hallelujah live live a life of no blame live a life of of no guilt amen hallelujah in other words live an honest good life Hallelujah verse 5. having predestinated us unto the adoption of children that means predetermined he predetermined our adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen he decided beforehand that's what predestinate means he decided beforehand that he would adopt us as his children for his pleasure so it made him happy to to make you one of the children of God that made him happy praise God it wasn't a it wasn't a burden for God to choose you huh it pleased God to choose you amen and may God smile that he chose you amen it pleased God it was not a discouraging thing well I've got to choose Jesse I guess I have nobody else to choose you know I guess I gotta take him he's the only one that will go to Akron you know he's uh it wasn't like that it wasn't God I wasn't God's Last Choice amen I was his first choice amen I was in a second-hand choice I was his first hand Joyce so are you praise God it made him happy it gave him pleasure that you were a child of God amen and he made you accepted he gave you a place of position in heaven he priority prepared a place for you in heaven Hallelujah the Bible says think about it we're we're here we're here right now but the Bible said you have a body that's already waiting for you in heaven it's like all these Sci-Fi movies got you know they got these other all these uh artificial intelligence bodies and all these things like waiting other places that's kind of true it's kind of true we have a theophany body the Bible said it's an eternal body amen that means it never had a beginning it never had to end praise God it has no sin in it praise God it has no death in it amen and the Bible said it's a house that's waiting for you and I in the heavens Hallelujah I've got one waiting there praise God you have one waiting there Hallelujah and that's why you're already accepted in heaven because you're already got representation in heaven amen you in the case out of this you've already made it to Heaven because your body's in heaven amen your theophanese in heaven amen thank God Amen and I'm not making that up that's what the Bible says praise God I wouldn't make anything up by God's grace verse 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved see all he chose us that we be children he chose us uh as the children to his praise so that's what we should do tonight that's what we should keep doing we should keep praising God keep glorifying God lord I praise you because you're you made me fearfully and wonderfully Lord I praise you because you chose me in you before the foundation of the world Lord I chose you because I got a body waiting in heaven amen Eternal in the heavens Hallelujah Lord I want to praise you because you adopted me into your family praise God I want to praise you because you had made me accept it in heaven Hallelujah all I have to worry about is heaven going to accept me or not the Bible said I'm already accepted in heaven Hallelujah by the blood of Christ amen my now of course we have a choice that so we don't we don't want to miss out on that part you know it's that it's like that old uh scripture from from Joshua that beautiful scripture choose you this day whom you will serve okay so so let's look at here if you got your Bible go to Romans 8. Romans 8 29 and 30 gives the the whole order of predestination so yes God chose you but the secret is God chose you because he knew you choose him God cannot force anybody to go to heaven God cannot force anybody to go to hell because then God is not fair God is Not Just but because God had foreknowledge he knew who would choose him and then he formed them and shaped them just like a vessel praise God he knew Austin would be a Christian he knew amen would be a Christian he knew William would be a Christian so then he in his mind he already knew how to form them and I'm going to do this kind of gift with music or this kind of praying for the sick or or this kind of gift here of Faith or something like that and he formed the vessels just the way he wanted them praise God Amen in his mind he had all planned out in his mind praise God he knew you Jews him so that's why that's why he could choose you then that's why he were in his mind praise God because he knew you'd choose him Hallelujah for whom he did for no he also did predestinate so fear what is the first step the first step is for knowledge God foreknew what you do because he foreknew he did also predestinate that means uh predetermined oh I got that order mixed up forgive me I got the order mixed up I got I got that wrong predestination second sorry okay for some reason forgive me yeah I got that wrong my fault so just so you know predestination second sorry determined because God had four now she could determine events beforehand in his mind how they'd play out then the Bible says uh predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called now called has a couple different definitions uh means election and choosing all right and then uh and whom he called then he also Justified that means declare righteous Hallelujah and whom he justified then he also glorified amen now I'm going to get back to that one sorry that's out of order my fault that's that's really shocking to me I didn't mean to do that okay First Peter 1 verse two First Peter 1 verse two let's read that if you got your Bibles now here at church now we see God's plan this is how God lays everything out maybe I can fix that on my phone I don't know let's try it while you turn that First Peter 1 verse 2. just make me feel good if I could fix that real quick yes sir yeah exactly sir yes amen yes sir exactly right and it worked out perfectly you like we talked about last week in there you needed the church right you needed a friend you needed you wanted somebody to be with right same thing happened to me I I was my mom dropped me off at Akron I had nobody the Christians coming they kind of sought me out it was God chasing me out it was God leaving the 99 to get the one by God's grace same thing brother yes beautiful God works out every event of your life perfectly yeah it's a beautiful plan amen it's a beautiful uh knowledge so okay now it's fixed okay thank the Lord perfect okay First Peter 1 verse two elect according to the foreknowledge of God so see let's look up here so you're elected because of God's predestination God calls you in other words because he could predestinate or predetermine the events of your life right he had already this he had everything lined up your parents and all these grandparents he had all them lined up and then because of that predestination he could call you at a certain time now but over at this next part is so crucial this is what we all got to submit to every day through what sanctification cleaning you out and the church said you're elect according to your elect according to your sanctification see as God cleans you out you recognize I'm called I'm elected God chose me because he's cleaning me out why is he cleaning out so he can feel you and then he can use you praise God oh no greater privilege than for God to clean you out so he can fill you he can use you and then you can praise His holy name amen because that's why you're credited too the praise of his glory amen the whole purpose of man is to praise God Hallelujah that's what we're doing tonight amen Grace be unto you and peace be multiplied I'm sorry I skipped the part through sanctification of the spirit unto what obedience so see God has to keep cleaning you out so you will obey and church says brother Brian preach so beautifully we don't always obey right away all of us need help obeying the word of God because we're fighting a battle against a person that hates the word of God and that's you amen you're fighting against a person that hates the word it's your sin nature inside you now these scriptures then give us the perfect outline here now I just want to emphasize this I I on Sunday I said let's take a trip back in time and see where God chose you so two years ago we had coveted I'm sure we all want to go back in our minds to that right mandates and lockdowns we all want to go back to that well we we could we could think about it they probably want to do it again no doubt they probably will that's okay uh Jesus church will keep marching on by God's grace that was two years ago now 500 five years ago Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation 505 years ago but you were chosen before that that means god already knew about the next church next two Church ages he already knew about all that you were chosen before that 1900 years ago I'm sorry 1992 years ago Jesus died for your sins on the cross think about that we're almost at 2 000 years from the the day the year he was crucified almost 2 000 years of course people will be making that a Rapture prediction I'm sure every year every day every year every month they make it now a thousand years before that 2 988 years ago Solomon built the temple I might preach on that on Sunday uh one of our supporters asked me to preach on the Temple of Solomon so I might preach on that I bought a book on it I've been reading it I might preach on that it always everything applies to us every day you can always see Christ in every scripture you can see that everything so it doesn't really matter you know as long as you're humble you'll see Christ in every scripture you were chosen before Solomon's Temple was built three thousand four hundred sixty eight years ago Moses LED Israel out of Egypt 3 500 years 4 370 years ago God flooded this Earth six thousand twenty six years ago Adam and Eve were forced out of the Garden of Eden because of their sins you were chosen before Adam and Eve were kicked out of Eden Hallelujah now before the fall there were six days of creation some think they're literal days other think they're Thousand-Year days it's a little joke in our family but before those six days God created the heavens and the Earth because the Bible said in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and the Earth was without form and without void that was before the days of creation right so before Genesis 1 1 God was alone then first created time space and matter so before Genesis 1 1 you were chosen in the mind of God Hallelujah in other words God's known you your whole life and way before your life Hallelujah Church A lot happened before the foundation of the world at least according to the scriptures Matthew 13 35 said Jesus said I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret since the foundation of the world so before the world was founded Jesus had those seven parables in his mind the four kinds of grounds in the pair with the sower the wheat and the tears Hallelujah the grain of mustard seed the lemon hid with three measures a meal the treasure hidden the field the pearl of great price and the net cast in the sea all those were hidden in God before the foundation of the world Hallelujah Jesus was the visible Spirit logos and as the logos the fire of God he was loved by the invisible God because John 17 24 says he says that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world God loved Jesus Hallelujah before Genesis 1 1. and God thought of you before Genesis 1 verse 1. Hallelujah amen Hebrews 4 verse 3 said the works that you're called to do were already done before the foundational world Amen Church there's nothing to worry about you don't have to worry and invite your nails and say am I going to finish God's works for me the Bible said God's already finished the works amen they were already finished they were already decided you can have confidence everything God's called you to do he'll equip you to do praise God that's Hebrews 4 verse 3. he said although the works were finished from the foundation of the world Amen Hallelujah in other words God is going to make sure his word comes to pass in your life amen it's already been determined it's already been finished it's already been pre-planned out amen God's ways cannot be defeated nobody can tell God when to stop or when to start God does whatever he wants he raises up whoever he wants he takes down whoever he wants he is in complete control all this was already planned out in God's mind before the foundation of the world we're just like we're we're just like actors on the stage just acting and out and maybe the best part about acting is that behind this mask is the spirit of God hallelujah amen thank God Jesus crucifixion was planned out before the foundation of the world the Bible said in Revelation 13 8 all they that drop on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Hallelujah so the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world think about that the lamb already had a book before he became the lamb Hallelujah the book was written in advance and brother Chris your name was on that book sir Hallelujah and not only that but the Bible says the word of God is forever settled in heaven ah so before there was the earth there was some Bible up somewhere God had some book with all those secrets in it he had a book of names he had a book A book he had a book of life he had a Lamb's Book of Life he had all this planned out God had all these things and the word of God was laying there and the Bible said the Angels desire to look into those things amen hallelujah praise God the word of God was already settled in heaven so let's look at this then let's look at God's perspective before there was anything it was God Alone think of this big huge Spirit right and then the first thing he made was a visible uh light with time space and matter all at the same time time space and matter and light all come at the same time there was nothing but God's spirit and all of a sudden time space and matter I was thinking of it like this like God is out he's just he's outside of he's got he's got the whole universe here and he's just so great I mean he's he's so it's just hard to explain it's just hard to hard to understand but one thing we know is that he loves us praise God and he wrote our names on the last book of life before we even came out to the Earth praise God so first he was alone second the visible Pillar of Fire with uh uh Thai space and matter then he would have created the Heaven and not yet the Earth after heaven then he would have created angels because Angels need a place to live and then he would have created the Earth because the Bible said in Job 38 God told job where was thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth who hath laid the measurements or who set the measurements of the earth job did you measure it out job and make sure it was the right the right size he said or who has stretched the line upon him who stretched the measuring line on the earth to make sure it was just the right size not too small not too big God asked job that did you measure it before I laid it out here what did job say he said I repent and dust and Ashes I'm a I'm a wicked man right it's just like Isaiah amen whenever Isaiah got in the presence of God he'd say oh I'm a great person he said I'm a man of unclean lips dwelling amongst people with unclean lifts amen that's what the flesh is in the presence of God now then your soul never sinned as far as in the presence of God praise God hallelujah but your flesh will feel awful in the presence of God in that way when God's bringing a rebuke not the joy dances which we love those amen I love those you love The Joy shouts and the joy screams and the Joy cries we all love those but when it comes down to God's holiness versus our flesh we the Bible says we're like uh we're like dust we're like well it's just the Bible says the flesh is enmity against the Holy Spirit he said Joe where are you whereupon are the foundations there are fastened where did I fasten and settle and plant the fastest the Fasteners to hold the Earth in place where did I put those I'll say like this Joe still don't have any answers Hallelujah nor nor do we we don't know where God fastened think about a chain where you fasten something down God's like where did I put the passion where did I fasten the Earth at job do you know where do you know where I planted it do you know where I settled it and put those fasteners or who laid the Cornerstone thereof job did you lay the Cornerstone of the Earth did you lay that mixture and make sure it was perfectly straight and it was the most beautiful piece that's what I do for the Cornerstone they had to find the most beautifully cut stone there's lots of stones but they had to find the most perfectly cut stone and then they laid that one in place and then everything else was built off of that both the walls going from that Cornerstone everything was built on the most perfect Stone and God asked job did you lay the Cornerstone did you measure that before he said did you do that when the morning star sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy amen hallelujah so it was it was God it was time space and matter it was Heaven Angel angels and then the Earth came out and the Earth got settled and when the angel saw that Earth just line up and stop right at its place and get and get fastened down in in this invisible atmosphere somehow it got fastened out all the Angels shouted for Joy hallelujah praise God our God is great our God is Holy our God is worthy of all praise but even before that church you were chosen in Christ before one Angel ever shouted amen oh my God I'm trying to take you back a little with the Eternal perspective you were already chosen before the foundation before the the settling of the earth you were already chosen in Christ that's the Bible truth that ought to make us thankful tonight ah Hallelujah you were chosen which means foreknown or called in Christ before the world came to its settling position the Fasteners fastened it down now the neat thing is God fastened it down and then he spun it around so it's got Fasteners that don't get tangled up have somebody explain that to me see it's fastened down it's measured out and then he spins it Hallelujah but before all this before one Angel shouted amen God already chose you in his mind amen so now we know what God was doing before the foundation of the world having Angels right making angels He was laying out books he was writing plans he had the word of God forever to settled to Heaven he had a book of life he had a Lamb's Book of Life but before that Earth found its position he already chose you and I in his mind Hallelujah and if you were chosen in Christ Christ is the word that means you are a part of the word which is why you love the Bible so much and if you don't it's time to break up uh some of that sleep from your eyes just trying to wake up from that sleep and Find Your Love back for God's Bible because this is God's spirit on paper form amen this is the nature of God on paper form Hallelujah and if you are chosen in Christ you were chosen the word in other words you'll find your life right in this Bible praise God you ain't gonna find it anywhere else you're gonna find your life you're going to find everything you need all those spiritual blessings are in the word of God Amen Hallelujah you're part of God you're part of the word you are part of God's family Hallelujah that's why you love the Bible so much now some people might say that's really nice brother Jesse but I my life seems so seems so insignificant you couldn't be further from the truth your life is incredibly significant Jesus said you are the light of the word of the world in other words you are the only light in this dark filthy dirty world think think of it we got most of the light in here in Akron Ohio we have most of the light right got wise versions foolish versions We have most of the light in this deep dark city this is this wicked City the sin the sin loving City we have most of the light is here and the Bible said uh the Nations the Bible said no man will have an excuse on that day because the Bible said God said his light you're a city on a hill that cannot be hit strangers might walk by you right your co-workers might just pass right by you but on the day of judgment they'll have to recognize that you were the light you were mad you were emitting something different amen your words were shining for something different your attitude was so different praise God Amen your character was so different they'll never be able to deny the lights Hallelujah Jesus said you are the light not just a light but you're the light that's way high above all the other things you're on a hill crazy you're on a mountain ah the Bible said you've already come to Mount Zion amen where is he Hallelujah where's my guy I'm using him his name right now you've come to Mount Zion we haven't come to another place we haven't come to a valley although sometimes we feel like we're in the valley shadow of a decision right or the valley of shadow of death but when we manifest the love of God when we obey the word of God God sets us on a hill and he makes everybody recognize this is a Believer this is how you should act this is how you should live this is the light of God Amen Hallelujah your life is way more significant than what you think and me I'm talking about me I'm preaching to myself the Bible said the Nations will not have an excuse because you are the light of the world Hallelujah how many times you think Church on people's algorithms on YouTube do our sermons come up and they either click on them or they scroll right past them see they're scrolling all they see Darkness all of a sudden our sermon comes up light ooh light all right spiritual light and they might watch it I got some good testimonies this week from our videos you know real good testimonies or they might not that's light light is shining and there'll be no excuses praise God and he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven sometimes you can't help but do things publicly not everything is done in secret but we should be careful to do Secret works because it keeps us sincere if we just do things that people see we lose our sincerity we lose that one-on-one with God we lose that communion with God that's why we've got to keep the secret things going too but there are sometimes you just can't help it you got to do something good you got to help somebody out and people are going to see it and Jesus said let your light shine amen in other words don't put Darkness on don't don't make yourself dark let your light shine because people will see and then they'll glorify God and they'll say I see God in you Hallelujah Jesus said I don't put men don't put light or candle under something under a bushel no you take the candle and you give light to everybody in the house that's what God is doing God's taking you and he's holding you up at Mustard Seed amen he's holding you up over there Medina he's holding up look at this say this is the light of God this is the True Believer this is how a person is supposed to live and you need to come to this light amen that's what God Said Jesus says that let your light so shine before men when they do those glorify your father which is in heaven praise God you were chosen for his namesake acts 15 to verse 14. the Bible plainly says you are called for one purpose for Jesus's namesake in other words you you take on Jesus name when he calls you so he calls you for his namesake you're elected for his namesake acts 15 14 Simeon hath declared out God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name's sake in other words you were chosen to take on his name so the other way to say it you were chosen to be married to Jesus this is why your life is not insignificant your life is extremely significant because all human history is boiling down to a wedding amen of all these things I don't know Austin's getting ready for a wedding right but all of human history all these 6 000 years is boiling down to one event it's a wedding that doesn't play take place on Earth or in heaven it takes place in between in the sky Hallelujah Hallelujah all of human history is about a wedding between Jesus and his church that's why your life is significant because he called you out of the world for his namesake and he's trying to get you ready he's trying to get you and get you motivated for The Wedding Date he's trying to remind you you're engaged you gotta you got a wedding day coming up he's trying to remind us tonight don't forget about the wedding Hallelujah don't don't get tired about it don't don't get tired of waiting just keep preparing for it think about that the more days you have for the wedding the more days to prepare the more days to make it more special that's exactly what we're doing amen if G's don't come next year if Jesus don't come in 20 30 40 50 100 years that's all the time we have all that time to get ready for that special day praise God we have all that time no man knows the day of the hour the father is keeping that all secret praise God hallelujah but of course he'll be whispering love secrets to us amen a man who's engaged Whispers Seekers to his wife well this will be like this and and it's going to be like this and then we're going to do that I think we're going to do this and we're going to do that Jesus is Whispering his love secrets to us hallelujah thank you Jesus Israel was blinded 2000 years ago so Jesus could call out a people for his name's sake Hallelujah the church is Jesus's future wife the Bible said we're engaged and the Bible says we are virgin to Christ now no matter what our Natural History is the Bible says spiritually Jesus has made us pure second Corinthians 11 2. private spouse you to one husband that I might present you as a chaste Virgin of Christ now in our in our society when you get engaged you get an engagement ring right right so brother Brandon says Jesus come down on the day of Pentecost and he kissed the church with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Adam said in the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he's setting down the Holy Spirit was God placing that engagement ring on Peter and Paul Hallelujah and all the saints and Mary that like the the Holy Spirit was that engagement ring that engagement kiss hallelujah we're engaged to Christ amen and we're getting ready for the wedding Hallelujah how do you know it because I've got I've got the token amen how do I know I'm going to be in the wedding because he gave me the token Hallelujah that's how I know amen he kissed me praise God he he put his love upon me amen he gave me a ring praise God I've got a son I've got a token I know I'll be there because he gave me his gifts Hallelujah his love gifts amen that's how I know remember Jesus called you beloved you're just not well loved a little bit you're not liked you are loved when I was on Facebook I liked that how that it could go from a like to a love I'd say oh yeah now I can love stuff I got tired of all the likes now I can love it that's how God is God just doesn't like us the Bible said God loves us Hallelujah when you come to church when you got baptized God put I love that on that on that post I got baptized today God I love that Hallelujah you got the Holy Ghost God said I love that amen that's Romans 9 25 and God's gonna call them my people which were not my people you are this we're a Church of God's people we could change the name of this church from bride of Christ Fellowship to my God's people church this is God's people or we can call it my beloved Church Christ's beloved Church because the Bible said we were not beloved but now we are his beloved we're his special love we're his chosen amen where his elected bride Hallelujah he did that praise God he determined that he chose me before I chose him Hallelujah oh yes all right you got 40 minutes in by God's grace okay now in Ephesians chapter 5 there's five things a bride must do Christ must be her head so see who's leading you as long as the Bible's leading you then Christ is your head second you must submit to all things in the word of God now we're daily in need help of that by God's grace as long as you're endeavoring and striving to do that then you then you got the second one in other words I don't want to denominate and just not obey some of these things like a denominations do I don't want to just get by with Christianity I wanna I want all God has for me I want to obey all of God's word I know it's hard but I'll do it by God by his grace I can do it we can do it third you got to be washed By the Waters of the word you gotta let God wash you clean out your thought life clean out your actions right clean out all your plans clean out all your habits right clean you out amen fourth you got to be joined to Christ which means glued to Christ that's why we gather more as we see that day approaching we got to be in order to be glued to Christ we've got to be glued to one another and Faith you must reverence the word of God because the Bible said the wife must reverence her husband that's why when We Gather we've got to have utmost reverence for Jesus Hallelujah so see church this makes us the bride your life is extremely significant because Jesus only has so many people in his bride there's the Bible says God is with the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles become in there's only a certain number and by God's grace we want to be in that number praise God there's only so many we see so many people falling away or or not even believing or or you know we see people passing away and wondering about their decisions that they make well that's their decision but our decision is plain we can be the wife of Christ we just have to do what the Bible says we've got to trust God and we've got to let him sanctify us unto obedience amen also Church another part is you have to we you and I have to finish the Great Commission so the question is who can you win to Jesus that's the question because we have to finish the Great Commission God never said you have to go to Australia to win a soul but let's win a soul right here in Akron by God's grace right you don't have to go up to Iceland to win a soul you don't you don't have to you got to win a soul right here in Akron by God's grace Hallelujah that's what we want praise God that's what we want Chris to be we want Chris to be our soul it's one to Jesus you keep praying about it buddy it's the greatest thing you ever do is serve the Lord the greatest privilege in my life has been to serve Jesus Christ without a shadow of a doubt I wouldn't trade I just wish I could have done it sooner I wouldn't trade this life for nothing no money no popularity no nothing I wouldn't trade this is the greatest life you could ever have praise God having the love of Jesus Christ in your heart amen hallelujah being around people that love Jesus Christ Hallelujah the greatest privilege Hallelujah how do I know because I have friends that have gone through uh adulteries friends that have been in pornography their lives are crushed friends that are addicted to video games their lives are crushed their lives are ruined and then they say nice things about my wife and I are they they tell my mom nice things about us people people are watching you you're a city on a hill you are a candle in a dark place and God's not trying to push you down church God is trying to raise you up amen and Empower you to burn brighter Hallelujah for the kingdom of God so others can see your light God's not trying to extinguish your life that's the devil God's trying to make your light burn brighter amen it's in the parable of the virgins trim your lamps and the church said trim it so they're burning as bright as possible Hallelujah thank you Jesus the church Jesus foreknew you so he predestinated the events of your life now you know you've been called now you know you're elected to the truth you see other people are elected for the truth and if you've been saved you're already Justified but we are not yet glorified that will come at the wedding [Laughter] Hallelujah this last step the fifth and final step comes at the wedding when you get a brand new theophany body and you get a brand new glorified body that's when the glorification happens Hallelujah oh it's a beautiful picture so see where we are in this stage if you're saved you're already here oh yeah I got a typo right there there it is yeah usually I get one at least one at least one type got to forgive me if I just do one typo I know you do I'm the only one who I'm My Own I'm My Own Worst critic so I know you don't care but see it's the blood of Jesus that justifies us uh Romans 5 verse 1 therefore being justified declared righteous by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ see each person here if you're saved you should have a sense of peace with God you know you're not fighting against God and you know God is not fighting against you because you're forgiven the Bible says if we if we don't do the statuary man we'll forget that we're forgiven so that's why we constantly have to make sure Lord make Lord raise my faith Lord raise my virtue raise my knowledge by Temperance and patience raise that so I don't forget that I am forgiven in other words let me be so anointed that I know I'm forgiven Hallelujah I don't act like I'm unsafe don't act like I'm lost let me always act like I'm a child of God let me be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden let everybody know that I'm in the family of Jesus when you're justified by faith you have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah try to bring this down here give me 15 more minutes here yeah I got 15 minutes right on there that's perfect there's so many blessings church we have all these spiritual blessings this Thanksgiving blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin God forgave David's adultery and murder even when David's own judgment said he should have died God still kept him from the Judgment he knew he should have got how many times Church do do does god spare us from punishment we know we should get we know we should have got caught we know we should have got exposed we know we should have gotten embarrassed but God spares us because God loves us amen hallelujah he loves no say amen he elected us he chosen us he'll fight for us he won't let us fail Hallelujah ah because he's got a plan the plan cannot be altered the plan is immutable unchangeable it's not safe the Lord [Applause] thus Faith the book of Heaven Hallelujah forever settle in heaven how's the devil going to change a book he can't change a book he can't touch the book Hallelujah it's the Lamb's Book it ain't Satan's book amen hallelujah it's a Lamb's Book of Life will suffer for our wrong Deeds but we'll be forgiven can there be a greater blessing than this the Forgiveness of sins this Christmas can there be a greater blessing than that this is what brother Brown said brother Ram said quote you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place I'm going to preach on this maybe on Sunday Hallelujah like you never did it like talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of the fact that I'm already complete in God I'm already justified in God hallelujah I'm already Sanctified God's already called me he said this is the most thankful thing I can think of this Thanksgiving that the word of God says I'm forgiven the word of God says God loves me amen the word of God says I'm calling out for his name's sake the word of God said I'm a light on a hill that cannot be hidden the word of God hallelujah says nothing shall separate me from the love of Christ amen that's what the Bible says amen Glory talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good he said you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born in the spirit of God wash the blood of Jesus and believes every word of God stands as though you never as though you never Ascend at the first place you are perfect because of the blood of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah Church you know I just laugh because you know I I know I know this I need constant reminders of that I don't always feel perfect I certainly don't feel virtuous all the time I don't feel holy all the time I don't feel righteous all the time but the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ makes us that way now say like this when I really start believing that I really start thinking about that and really start going through the The Obedience of that I start to feel righteous I start to feel holy sometimes I feel so holy I just dance around the church because I feel so holy praise God I've been so forgiven amen or I'll scream or cry you see me crying up here whatever because I feed it and praise God Amen Hallelujah when I break away from the Flesh and get to that spiritual man how do we make a transfer over we leave the fleshy things behind we forget about the world and we start getting into Heavenly places amen Glory blessed are your eyes for they see the truth of God blessed are your ears for they hear the gospel truth so this Thanksgiving I'm so thankful he called me he chose me in him to be holy I'm thankful that I can be a blessed I'm sorry a vessel that Praises God I'm thankful I'm a vessel of honor and not a vessel Of Dishonor someone that would dishonor the word of God and not believe the word of God and not obey the word of God we are not a vessel Of Dishonor like my wife and I are wedding vows I'm thankful we can be a vessel meat for the Master's use all these years later we wrote those wedding vows together and I made sure that scripture was in there by God's grace when I saw the scripture yes I want to be ready to be God's vessel and here we are all these years later hun Hallelujah 16 years passing the church a vessel that God can use that's what we want to be I'll say like this there's nothing else I'd rather be than a vessel of Honor for the Lord Jesus Christ I'm thankful I'm not a vessel for Satan Satan can't use me to get drunk or get high or go blaspheme or go do all kinds of wicked things or go for some awful drives or whatever Satan can't anoint me to do that because God's already he's already sealed Satan out of my soul amen hallelujah praise God Amen God is sealed in and Satan is sealed out Hallelujah I'm a vessel of Honor Hallelujah you are too I'm not a vessel for the Democratic or Republican party although I pray more for Republicans though I pray for Democrats to repent more often but a lot of Republicans do but I'm not a vessel for the Republican party I'm a vessel for Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm not a vessel for Wall Street Hallelujah I'm not a vessel uh for Amazon I'm not Investing For The sit in the city school I work for I'm not their vessel I'm a vessel of honor I'm a vessel of the master I'm talking about the master of the universe the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm not a vessel that condemns or blasphemes God I'm a vessel that Praises God and so are you Hallelujah now in closing with this knowledge how should we live how should we live brother Brian hit it and that's it's one of those you know like even brother amen serving about love these these These are major topics right brother Brian sermon on Sunday night was about obedience if you caught it I'm sure you did how should we live we should live in a life of obedience because we know where we came from I just I just went back in time and hit some major events in human history and pre-human history we just hit some major events and God called you way before all those he already chose you he called you he liked he chose you way before all those so how would you live so you would be holy and Without Blame before him in love go to Second Peter 1 verse 10. because we know the order of predestination how should we live Peter says make this part sure right here you know why because this is what people see right here people can't see this church you and I can't see this record we can't see these two what can people see this right here oh how come Austin don't hang out with anymore uh hang out with us anymore oh he's called to the church yeah Jesus church he got called away from that that that uh group of guys how come any men don't come around to domination anymore he had a different calling Hallelujah thank God Amen this is what men see men don't see these you and I don't see him right we sure don't see these right we don't have I wish I had a glorified body I'd never sin again I never get tired I could stay up all night and study all night and preach all day I could preach all day Hallelujah and you could say Amen all day if you had a glorified body too you could sing all day brother but see we don't men don't really see any of these they just see this Austin's been called away to a different lifestyle that's what Matt's going to see about God's grace yeah he's probably already seen it that's what you want Matt to see in your life Chris you're called away you are you have a different calling you're marching to the sound of a Different Drum amen amen you're a soldier fight for a different Army Hallelujah Glory look at second Peter 1 verse 10. wherefore the rather Brethren give what diligence which if you look it up diligence is labor are your human strength Brethren give all your human strength to make what to make this sure to make this positive and nobody can deny what you're called to do give all of your strength all of your effort he said Peter said of all men amen who denied Jesus three times of all men he said give all of your effort and labor to make this positive to everybody everybody will know which side you chose hallelujah amen as I told brother amen I got back from that denomination another denomination but I said I'm glad I'm glad I'm on the side that I chose buddy I've got to get to come back to this church because that's the side I chose amen hallelujah I was calling to this church that this truth to this gospel to this Revelation to this mystery of God that's finished Hallelujah I was calling the best amen knowing all this make your choosing sure another word for that in the Greek is stable give all your human effort to make your choosing stable for if you do these things you will never fail if you walk in faith if you have virtue to live a holy life in front of people you have the knowledge and understanding of God if you have Temperance to control your sexual passions or your your stomach passions whatever passions you have if you have the Holy Ghost anointing to be patient with God and with your friends and your family and your church family if you have the broadly kindness to love uh I'm sorry if you have godliness to love everybody praise God like God even love your enemies and if you have the brotherly kindness to love the Saints in this church you will never ever fail Satan can't knock you down Satan can't defeat you he might have some little hits on you maybe a little discouragements but one thing's for sure if you let the anointing of God live on your life you will never fail you will overcome Hallelujah Glory impossible to fail if you let the anointing of God flow through your life completely impossible verse 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you the Angels say brother brother Jesse I'm going to open the door I'm going to make an entrance for you come on into heaven come on in angels will hold the door open for you well I can't wait for that hallelujah amen if you do God's word and entrance will be made for you into the kingdom the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so see because of the foreknowledge of God you know now you understand God's foreign he's he's decided beforehand the events of your life now I didn't get to act 17 but acts 17 says God knows where you would live God knew you'd come to this church God knew you wouldn't move to another country or you'd move to this country thank God God knew it and God had bound or boundaries of your habitation you could not pass you could not get Beyond them you just felt compelled I got to live there I I gotta go back there I got to move from Wisconsin to Ohio amen I just had to I had to leave Liberty Center to go to Akron you just had to do it praise God determined that and you're moved by God you're moved by God to fulfill all these things so knowing all these things he said focus on your calling focus on your choosing focus on your election and give all your human effort to make that sure and positive to everyone I think I got a couple definitions here yeah what does stable mean now make your calling election sure it means stable fast or firm it means you're not likely to give way or overturn it's very unlikely that I'm leaving the message Hallelujah very unlikely I'm going back in the world because Jesus Christ has already been sealed into me praise God and I'm not sealed to the next Revival I'm sealed to the day of my
