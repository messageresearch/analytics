[5:00] mouth
[5:01] and a two-edged sword in their hand look
[5:04] at that praising God but you're ready to
[5:05] fight with God's word
[5:07] at any time when the enemy might come
[5:09] around you're ready to fight the enemy
[5:10] how are you ready today babe by God's
[5:11] grace amen may God add His blessings to
[5:14] rhema's word you may be seated praise
[5:15] God
[5:18] so we'd like to look at this thought
[5:19] here praise His name with the dancing
[5:21] um
[5:22] I just want to go a little bit further
[5:24] on some work scriptures on
[5:26] joy and also on praising the Lord
[5:29] and I want to uh
[5:32] if I can here I want to show some more
[5:34] of those brother random quotes I hope I
[5:35] got them in the right place I used some
[5:36] of them in Napoleon
[5:38] uh yeah I thought that'd be a blessing
[5:41] just as a little review here by God's
[5:43] grace
[5:45] because I know you know Levi's fairly
[5:48] new to the message how many years you've
[5:49] been in the message brother
[5:53] four okay okay so not not so fairly near
[5:56] okay so you've been around a good good
[5:58] that's wonderful I didn't know I didn't
[5:59] know how many years it wasn't now
[6:00] brother arley's he's real fresh to it
[6:02] just like I said just got baptized about
[6:03] a month ago so
[6:05] um I just want to bring out some of
[6:06] these and some of these I wanted to
[6:07] preach here at our church but I never
[6:09] really got a chance to preach them
[6:10] because I was just LED on other topics
[6:15] but um
[6:17] here's here's the first time brother
[6:19] Brown talks about him dancing
[6:21] um
[6:22] he said he first heard the Full Gospel
[6:24] people heard them clap their hands and I
[6:26] thought as a Baptist now sure they have
[6:27] some church members or or don't or
[6:30] dignities anyhow I thought my that's
[6:31] horrible so brother Brandon thought
[6:33] clapping the hands was horrible at one
[6:34] point
[6:35] now look we just spent the whole service
[6:37] clapping and brother random in his
[6:40] infancy State as being a Christian you
[6:41] know he would have thought that's
[6:42] horrible
[6:43] too much clapping
[6:45] aren't you glad church we can all grow
[6:47] in the grace and knowledge of God
[6:49] look he said clapping's horrible yep
[6:51] we'll show some scriptures where God
[6:52] says clap your hands
[6:55] clap your hands for Joy the Bible says
[6:58] amen so it just shows you know we're
[6:59] raised in a certain way and and God
[7:01] wants all of us to grow in Grace and
[7:03] knowledge of the Lord
[7:05] now think about this let's say you were
[7:06] raised in a quiet Church like brother
[7:08] Branham so you've got to grow out of
[7:10] that like Arlie and Levi you got to grow
[7:12] out of that and just learn to open up to
[7:15] Jesus
[7:16] now on the other side where I might have
[7:18] been raised or maybe uh sister Naomi and
[7:21] Beatrice I was raised in a Pentecostal
[7:23] Church where if you didn't have a tongue
[7:25] or interpretation then it's as if you
[7:28] didn't have church
[7:30] and you've got to learn to see God in
[7:31] the quietness too and I don't know if
[7:33] that's how it was I just thought I'd use
[7:34] that example because I know you you
[7:35] dance every service you know
[7:37] that's good I think that's a great thing
[7:39] that's a great way to get Victory it's a
[7:40] good way to keep victory in your life
[7:41] praise God
[7:44] but so see we you know some of us are
[7:46] born in different situations and so God
[7:48] is by the Holy Ghost he's going to teach
[7:50] us both
[7:52] right because the Bible said God
[7:54] inhabits the praise of his people
[7:56] so God is in all the loud praise but
[7:59] then the Bible said be still and know
[8:01] that I'm God
[8:04] I can't have both at the same time
[8:06] you know I personally you know we
[8:08] personally can't now in a service though
[8:10] people some people can be loud and
[8:12] shouting and enjoying God's spirit but
[8:14] then other people can be still and quiet
[8:15] in the same service
[8:17] and they can just be meditating and God
[8:19] can be speaking directly to them
[8:22] they've got to quiet themselves down and
[8:24] maybe they're just you know real
[8:26] you know sacred and leaning in their
[8:28] chair and just praying God where other
[8:29] people I might be dancing around and
[8:31] saying thank you Jesus hallelujah oh God
[8:33] is so
[8:34] worshiping God and I feel God's presence
[8:37] but God can speak in both ways
[8:41] and so the main thing church we don't
[8:42] want to like brother man we like he
[8:43] taught us we don't want to be sitting in
[8:45] the seat of the scornful
[8:47] we don't want to be criticized in others
[8:49] let me say like this you know you got a
[8:50] criticizing Spirit when you think bad of
[8:52] the person
[8:53] because it's okay to see someone needs
[8:55] correction but the love of God should
[8:57] make you want to go to that person and
[8:59] correct them
[9:00] in love
[9:02] right speaking the truth in love
[9:05] Hallelujah
[9:07] he said he said that's horrible imagine
[9:09] clapping is horrible that's what brother
[9:10] man said at one time in his mind
[9:13] and then to beat it all here got
[9:15] somebody on the floor and just started
[9:17] dancing up and down the floor oh my I
[9:19] just didn't understand
[9:22] aren't glad God says we can grow into
[9:23] understanding
[9:25] growing the knowledge and understanding
[9:27] of Jesus one night I was having a
[9:29] meeting in my Tabernacle they was having
[9:30] a New Year's watch in my Tabernacle I
[9:32] was teaching on the second coming of
[9:33] Christ I had a Blackboard up there I was
[9:35] drawing it out the best that I knew how
[9:37] he would descend that we may Ascend into
[9:39] glory and there was a little
[9:40] intermission and they were singing some
[9:42] songs while I was wrestling right about
[9:44] a four and a half hours of teaching
[9:45] straight I think I said six hours so I
[9:47] was wrong it was four and a half hours
[9:48] straight and they were singing a special
[9:50] and they there were some people come
[9:52] from Louisville which was Full Gospel
[9:55] people and they said they had a special
[9:57] some young ladies wanted to beat some
[9:59] little tin cans and things
[10:01] and they had a washboard with some
[10:03] Thimbles on it with their fingers and
[10:06] they was playing on this washboard I
[10:07] guess you've seen that hookup of the
[10:09] hookup and one of them was going to play
[10:11] the piano and they started playing that
[10:12] song there's going to be a meeting in
[10:15] the air in that sweet sweet bye-bye and
[10:17] God's own son will be the leading one at
[10:20] that meeting in the air
[10:23] and that little lady turned real white
[10:25] around the mouth
[10:27] and begin to beat the piano she must
[10:29] have been really really into it and I
[10:32] believe if they are have been three
[10:34] decks a key she played every one of them
[10:37] what do you think about that Malachi
[10:39] talk about the anointing
[10:42] all three decks of keys I never seen
[10:44] such playing in my life and that lady on
[10:46] that washboard hitting them Thimbles and
[10:48] a little blonde headed sister about so
[10:50] high jumped out in the floor and started
[10:51] dancing
[10:53] and I was sitting there right in my
[10:55] Tabernacle and I thought oh my here it
[10:57] is I thought now what why they have to
[10:59] do that
[11:01] so first it's horrible and then why they
[11:03] have to do that
[11:05] so I waited and looked around the people
[11:06] they looked up at me and I looked around
[11:07] and thought I'm a fundamentalist you
[11:10] couldn't show me that in the Bible
[11:12] look at that he thought he's so
[11:14] fundamental he thought he knew the Bible
[11:15] so well he didn't even realize it was in
[11:17] the Bible
[11:19] see Church isn't that sometimes the
[11:20] attitude we get we think we know
[11:22] everything that's in the Bible
[11:24] and church honest let's be honest we
[11:25] don't always know everything right
[11:28] right we need to we need to have a
[11:29] humble spirit
[11:31] Jesus said learn on me because I'm a
[11:33] meek and lowly in heart
[11:36] so a Christian is somebody who can
[11:37] Rejoice but also come to church and and
[11:40] they can be taught the word of God
[11:42] they want to learn the word of God
[11:45] as I said the other day
[11:47] the word disciple how many want to be a
[11:49] disciple of Christ it means a learner so
[11:51] you gotta you've got to learn more about
[11:52] Jesus all the time and you can't learn
[11:55] unless you take up your cross
[11:58] you take a sacrificial humble Spirit say
[12:00] I'm I'm dying to my pride today I don't
[12:02] know all about the Bible I don't know
[12:04] all about the message I can grow today
[12:05] as a learner
[12:07] but see the trouble is we people think
[12:09] they know all about it and you can't
[12:11] teach them nothing
[12:12] I love how brother Brandon had enough uh
[12:14] honesty to say I can learn more by God's
[12:16] grace
[12:18] he said there's just a whole lot of
[12:19] things that us a lot of us fundamentals
[12:21] don't know it's in there that's all
[12:24] so I looked around and thought my where
[12:27] did that dancing ever come from I was
[12:28] sitting there in the seat of the
[12:29] scornful of course so with the critical
[12:31] spirit not saying nothing I was afraid
[12:33] to say anything because I was afraid
[12:35] that they might be right and me wrong
[12:36] see that's why people sometimes
[12:37] criticize
[12:39] there is a part of them that they know
[12:41] they're wrong
[12:43] praise God
[12:45] see
[12:46] so I just let it go like that so I
[12:49] thought my Now isn't that terrible
[12:51] though right here in my Tavern look at
[12:52] that he's calling worship dancing
[12:54] terrible
[12:56] horrible terrible all these things now
[12:58] did God forgive him
[12:59] of course did God still use his gift of
[13:02] course but he had to grow out of this
[13:04] name calling and labeling
[13:08] all right some people labeled today oh
[13:09] that's legalists or they're Pentecostal
[13:11] or they're this or that and they label
[13:13] things they don't even know and they
[13:15] don't even realize it's in the Bible
[13:16] praise God
[13:18] that's ignorance but see God is going to
[13:20] be able to help the ignorant if they
[13:22] really want to get help praise God
[13:24] if they got the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[13:26] I'll guide you into all truth praise God
[13:30] so as Believers we got to we just got to
[13:32] stand with the truth point to the truth
[13:33] preach the truth and let the chips fall
[13:35] where they may if they're a child of God
[13:37] they will finally accept the truth
[13:39] praise God
[13:40] if they're a real child of God
[13:42] hallelujah
[13:45] Hallelujah what a terrible thing dancing
[13:49] in this beard Hallelujah
[13:54] he was just ignorant he said and this
[13:55] little lady out there her eyes closed
[13:57] dancing around first thing you know and
[13:59] got another one started I thought oh my
[14:02] oh my this is terrible
[14:04] well I guess we've had some terrible
[14:06] Services lately haven't we
[14:08] but that's in the Baptist mind or
[14:10] whatever you know the the carnal mind
[14:12] we've had great Services praise God
[14:14] so I begin to rehearse that aren't you
[14:16] glad God will bring all things to your
[14:18] remembrance
[14:19] he'll help you rehearse things in your
[14:21] mind oh in the Bible they did dance and
[14:23] I thought when they danced what was it
[14:25] dancing was spoke of pharaoh was
[14:27] pursuing Israel and all the enemy was
[14:29] drowned Miriam picked up the tambourine
[14:31] begin to beat the tambourine begin to
[14:32] dance and all the daughters of Israel
[14:34] filed her dancing I thought well there
[14:37] they had the victory
[14:38] I love what cam brought out she was at
[14:40] least 85 years old
[14:43] we don't have any 85 year olds in here
[14:45] by God's grace
[14:47] but an 85 year old woman picked up the
[14:50] tambry and said this is not a time to be
[14:52] sorrowful this is a time to be joyful
[14:54] praise God
[14:55] all of our enemies are done with praise
[14:59] God Amen
[15:01] amen those enemies I saw for all my life
[15:03] I'll see them no more praise God
[15:06] it took an 85 year old woman look at the
[15:08] wisdom in that amen
[15:10] see some of you with more years on our
[15:12] lives we should have more wisdom praise
[15:13] God
[15:14] and we need a woman or we need somebody
[15:16] who's led by the Holy Spirit to start
[15:18] worshiping God and really giving God
[15:20] praise amen
[15:22] a real sacrifice of praise he said well
[15:26] there they had the Victory and then I
[15:29] read in David when the ark had been away
[15:30] so long then when he'd returned back why
[15:32] he was so happy he started dancing he
[15:35] had the victory
[15:36] his sweetheart kind of made fun of him
[15:38] kind of laughed at him
[15:41] he said well you don't like that watch
[15:43] this
[15:45] and down there he went around and around
[15:47] he went again and I thought well
[15:49] she sat up there and laughed at him and
[15:52] God put a curse on her I said well he
[15:54] said David our a man after my own heart
[15:57] well I thought the only thing is the
[15:59] matter with me I just ain't got enough
[16:02] Victory Maybe
[16:04] oh church I I just want to have victory
[16:06] in my life
[16:07] I don't want to be a defeated Christian
[16:11] I know there's times here we gotta we
[16:12] gotta fight we got to struggle but I
[16:14] don't want to live a defeated life I
[16:16] want to try them because the Bible said
[16:18] Jesus always causes us to Triumph in
[16:21] Christ amen
[16:23] and Paul told the Romans I will shortly
[16:26] put Satan under your feet praise God
[16:30] Jesus would put Satan under their feet
[16:32] whatever when Satan wasn't under their
[16:34] feet before maybe he would they were
[16:36] maybe they felt they were battling a
[16:37] sword and a sword as it was but he said
[16:40] British you're not going to put Satan
[16:41] under your feet and you're going to be
[16:43] victorious praise God
[16:46] so the reason now people don't clap they
[16:49] don't shout they don't Rejoice they
[16:50] don't dance is they just don't have
[16:52] enough Victory praise God oh God give us
[16:57] Victory praise God
[16:59] and as we've been praying here let's
[17:01] keep praying God give me more reasons to
[17:04] dance
[17:05] give me more Victory so I can dance more
[17:07] praise God
[17:09] that's my prayer
[17:11] Hallelujah
[17:15] in a few minutes something happened now
[17:17] this might shock you when I come to
[17:19] myself I was out there with that little
[17:21] girl dancing out on the floor that's
[17:23] right just the thing that I thought I
[17:25] wouldn't do I did
[17:29] that's my prayer God lead me to do
[17:31] things I think I never do if it
[17:33] glorifies you
[17:36] hallelujah thank God Amen
[17:39] Amen in other words in other words the
[17:40] Lord used me however you see fit help me
[17:43] not to put any limits on you praise God
[17:46] but help me just be a universal praise
[17:49] God
[17:51] Hallelujah
[17:55] I never was on a dance floor in my life
[17:58] but I guess I did it all right
[18:01] I guess it was all right of course it
[18:03] was all right because he got scripture
[18:05] for it
[18:06] I sure felt awful not awful awful good
[18:11] I sure felt awful good I had a lot of
[18:14] Victory after that so that would be all
[18:16] right then I guess
[18:18] Hallelujah but I said God's in music
[18:21] don't You Believe God's in music
[18:22] certainly God's music he's in art he's
[18:24] the god in the universe he's in his
[18:25] creatures and he's in the church he's in
[18:27] creation he's in the universe God all
[18:28] God's all around just everywhere he's
[18:30] here in the schreider auditorium right
[18:31] now this night right present God's
[18:33] everywhere I just wonder sometime if he
[18:35] just take the shades off our eyes till
[18:38] our sight would be fast enough to catch
[18:41] his presence in the building
[18:43] in other words God is here may he open
[18:46] our eyes so we can see him
[18:49] other than if he was here like he was
[18:51] here with David David would dance all
[18:52] around because God's here
[18:55] oh my God
[18:57] remember why did David dance because
[18:58] God's presence was now amongst his
[19:02] people in church don't we believe that
[19:03] that the prince of Jesus Christ is here
[19:05] today praise God
[19:07] he's with his people hallelujah
[19:10] he's here to bless his people strengthen
[19:12] his people guide his people edify them
[19:14] correct them build them up Hallelujah
[19:17] get them in this perfect will praise God
[19:19] that's why he's here praise God
[19:22] [Applause]
[19:24] he's here in the presence of his people
[19:25] hallelujah
[19:27] that's why he was shouting
[19:29] and the other the other Revelation was
[19:31] Saul didn't have the ark and Saul was
[19:34] not inquiring at the ark
[19:36] and David wanted the ark so he could
[19:39] inquire at the ark the prince of God
[19:42] and remember that was his one prayer he
[19:45] said one thing I've desired
[19:47] that I may dwell in the house of the
[19:49] Lord all the days of my life
[19:51] to see his Beauty
[19:52] and inquire in his holy Temple
[19:56] in other words David when the ark was
[19:58] coming in he said now I finally get my
[20:00] heart's desire Jesus is here and I get
[20:03] to talk to him praise God and he'll talk
[20:05] back amen
[20:07] oh Hallelujah
[20:11] see brother said David dance rejoice and
[20:14] dance in the spirit running around why
[20:16] he saw the word back in his place
[20:19] I'm going to skip past
[20:20] where's the quotes I was looking for
[20:22] those are not the quotes I want to get a
[20:23] couple more here let me go back
[20:26] I want to get the ones I didn't show you
[20:27] about the agonizing in prayer yeah maybe
[20:29] they're up here
[20:31] yeah yeah here there sorry
[20:36] now brother man says it's not here
[20:39] well the man says I know there's a lot
[20:40] of finesseism the fourth seal people
[20:42] carried on I know sometimes they do it
[20:44] when the music's jumping up and down and
[20:45] everything I know that goes and I
[20:47] believe that too look brother man
[20:48] believes that
[20:49] brother man believes it's okay to dance
[20:52] and praise God while the music is going
[20:55] I believe in that too I've seen people
[20:57] in that day when as long as the music's
[20:59] playing everybody was jumping and
[21:00] screaming when the music stopped they
[21:02] stopped see I believe that that's still
[21:04] all right as far as I'm concerned as
[21:06] long as people lives right
[21:09] but now you start bringing that word
[21:11] that's the thing that actually brings
[21:13] life is the word and that brings a joy
[21:15] of stimulation of new wine praise God
[21:18] Hallelujah
[21:20] so that's the attitude brother Brandon
[21:22] had let the people Rejoice let the
[21:24] people dance let them sing even if they
[21:26] just do it while the music's on let them
[21:27] do it as long as they live right but the
[21:30] most important thing is the word of God
[21:32] that will give you life Hallelujah
[21:35] amen
[21:38] I love this question brother brother man
[21:40] asked about Miriam Miriam picked up the
[21:41] tamarine down the bank she went dancing
[21:43] Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory
[21:45] did you ever get that much let's ask us
[21:48] let's let's ask ourselves that question
[21:49] today have I ever had that much Victory
[21:51] praise God
[21:53] I could dance for Jesus amen I don't
[21:56] care who is watching I don't care if
[21:57] anybody was in the church I don't care
[21:59] because I was only thinking about God
[22:01] Amen
[22:03] that's Victory praise God
[22:05] that's what brother Brown said
[22:07] did you ever get that much Victory oh
[22:10] victory is mine a victory is my a
[22:16] victory today
[22:18] is mine oh I told Satan to get thee
[22:25] behind cause Victory today is mine amen
[22:32] did you ever get that much amen
[22:35] glory to God Amen
[22:38] Hallelujah you're telling me I was a
[22:40] sinner I wasn't raising the message
[22:41] you're telling me some people tell me
[22:44] that
[22:46] God save me out of sin and then brought
[22:48] me to the message and I shouldn't dance
[22:50] anymore
[22:51] but yet I danced for Satan out in the
[22:54] world
[22:55] you're telling me that it's okay to
[22:57] dance for Satan but it's not okay to
[22:59] dance for the Lord
[23:01] you're telling me you know Satan will
[23:03] move someone to dance what is Satan
[23:05] always trying to do he's trying to
[23:06] impersonate God
[23:09] brother bam said it was Satan who stole
[23:11] the music from God God had music first
[23:14] but Satan impersonated it and then he
[23:17] brings that impersonation
[23:19] in other words everything starts with
[23:21] God dancing started with God shouting
[23:23] started with God worshiping clapping
[23:26] hands started with God
[23:28] don't say like this if I dance for Satan
[23:30] and worshiped him and I was filled with
[23:32] his spirit will now build with Jesus
[23:33] Spirit now I'm going to dance for Jesus
[23:35] amen I'm going to praise him because I'm
[23:38] filled with the new spirit praise God
[23:41] and I've got victory in Christ amen
[23:44] the addictions don't hold me anymore the
[23:47] spirit the evil spirits don't hold me
[23:48] anymore I'm free I'm out of the prison
[23:51] praise God I'm a new creature in Christ
[23:54] Jesus amen
[23:56] amen
[24:02] hallelujah praise God
[24:04] and the Bible says let them praise the
[24:07] Lord in the dance amen
[24:10] I got permission I got permission to
[24:13] Praise Jesus amen he gave me permission
[24:16] and it's in the Bible praise God
[24:20] it's in the Bible praise God this says I
[24:23] can dance amen
[24:25] this says I can shout this says I can
[24:28] see and this is my absolute amen
[24:32] ah
[24:35] I got one absolute that's the word of
[24:38] God Amen
[24:40] do you ever get that much Victory
[24:41] [Applause]
[24:44] Hallelujah remember brother says our
[24:46] spirit is clean
[24:48] fresh it's real it's sober and serious
[24:50] but nonetheless full of the joy of the
[24:53] Lord
[24:54] I feel some Joy this morning Lydia
[24:58] and the Christian ought to be
[25:00] just as exuberant
[25:04] and full of his pleasure in the Lord
[25:08] as the world is when it Savers and
[25:11] delights in its pleasures
[25:14] let me look up this word exuberant here
[25:16] so that will help us it's a pretty big
[25:18] word
[25:20] exuber it means
[25:22] Joy joyously unrestrained
[25:26] and enthusiastic
[25:29] there's no restraints to my joy I keep
[25:32] spitting forgive me front row
[25:33] to get you some windshields there
[25:36] in a few moments here
[25:38] but when you are we ought to be just as
[25:40] exuberant as the world is except we're
[25:43] exuberant for Jesus Christ
[25:46] Glory
[25:49] Hallelujah
[25:50] so I don't have no restraints on me
[25:53] the only restraint on me is the Holy
[25:55] Ghost
[25:57] it's telling me do this it's telling me
[25:59] don't do this it's telling me stand now
[26:01] shout now Dance Now pray now Menace you
[26:05] know intercede now whatever say Amen now
[26:07] that's my only restraint is Lord what do
[26:09] you want me to do praise God
[26:12] because Lord I want that I want to be
[26:14] exuberant I want to be free I want a
[26:17] clean Spirit praise God
[26:19] Hallelujah
[26:21] and the pleasure of a Christian is
[26:23] worshiping the Lord
[26:27] see we ought to savor worshiping God we
[26:29] are a delight in praising God it ought
[26:31] to be something that we enjoy
[26:34] Brother Ali I enjoy dancing for Jesus
[26:37] I it's a joy
[26:40] especially after last Saturday night
[26:41] praise God it's a joke we had almost a
[26:43] six hour service so we had about an hour
[26:45] dancing about two two hours of preaching
[26:47] about two hours of praying and pleading
[26:48] for God at the altar agonizing in prayer
[26:51] it was a beautiful service I think seven
[26:52] people got the Holy Ghost in that
[26:53] service
[26:54] if I'm not mistaken
[26:56] all young people
[26:58] all young people
[27:01] but see that's our pleasure that's our
[27:02] Delight both the Christians in the world
[27:04] are human both have emotions
[27:07] the difference is our hearts and
[27:09] emotions are purely on the Lord and His
[27:12] glory and his love while the world
[27:14] satisfies the flesh oh
[27:21] now brother man says some people don't
[27:23] believe in tongues and things like that
[27:24] he said you've seen one time I used to
[27:26] think about dancing in the spirit see
[27:27] somebody dance in the spirit now I've
[27:29] seen the mockery put on of it but I've
[27:31] seen the real thing too so I come to
[27:32] find out why could people dance in the
[27:34] spirit well I never seen one yet get out
[27:36] of the way I've never seen one yet act
[27:38] immorally how many can say Amen to that
[27:41] in other words when we dance in the
[27:42] spear or people we know we never see
[27:44] them live immorally they always do it to
[27:47] glorify God
[27:49] hallelujah praise God in the Lord in
[27:52] other words like Jesus said you judge a
[27:54] tree by its fruit praise God
[27:56] oh man forgive me I'm getting real
[27:58] zealous here
[27:59] you got to judge a tree so that's fine
[28:01] if they dances they scream or shout or
[28:03] speak in tongues whatever they do but
[28:05] after that they should live a life
[28:06] that's worthy of the Gospel praise God
[28:08] and that's what we do praise God
[28:11] amen
[28:14] I always see it just as decently
[28:17] and in order and sweetness oh you can
[28:20] dance in sweetness yes you can
[28:22] oh brother brother Jesse dancing service
[28:25] today yeah brother it was so sweet you
[28:26] should have seen it
[28:28] he had his hands up to the Lord and he
[28:30] was he was smiling his eyes were closed
[28:32] he did not have a thimble though but
[28:33] somebody needs to bring me a thimble we
[28:35] got one at home I need to bring a thin
[28:36] we'll start playing on the washboard
[28:37] praise God
[28:39] because that's what they did in brother
[28:39] Brown's meetings and the church said
[28:41] Hallelujah
[28:44] he said they had a thimble and a
[28:46] washboard and they're playing they're
[28:48] going to meet they're going to meet
[28:49] Jesus in the air praise God oh
[28:52] and even Sinners run to the Altar and
[28:55] get saved when it's going on well I
[28:56] wondered why it was and I come to find
[28:58] out it's victory
[29:41] press that with you wheat this quote was
[29:44] a reality to brother Branham he saw
[29:45] people dance and then Sinners would run
[29:47] to get saved we saw people dance and
[29:49] then Believers would go up and get the
[29:51] Holy Ghost
[29:53] same thing praise God
[29:55] people getting eternal life because
[29:57] Jesus Christ is the same praise God
[30:00] he's the same as he was in 1962 praise
[30:03] God Jesus is still the same dancing
[30:06] brings Victory praise God oh Hallelujah
[30:11] brings victory
[30:17] all right uh yeah no I wanted to show
[30:19] this call I want to rehearse this again
[30:20] why did David you know God looked down
[30:22] from heaven while David's dancing
[30:23] brother Randolph said and he said look
[30:24] at David he's a man after my own heart
[30:28] why he'd done lost all Pride
[30:33] see that's the reason people don't dance
[30:34] shout clap scream whatever praise God
[30:36] they can't praise God because they're
[30:38] prideful pride is self-confidence in
[30:41] other words I know more about it than
[30:42] God
[30:44] I know more about it than the preacher
[30:45] or whatever I know more about it than
[30:47] the song leader
[30:48] and I'm not going to praise God I'm not
[30:49] going to praise God like that because I
[30:51] know more about it I'm prideful
[30:53] brother man said pride is one of the
[30:54] most worst sins he says such an awful
[30:57] sin to have pride
[30:59] where you think so much of yourself that
[31:01] you can't think about that God Made You
[31:03] To Worship Him and and someone with
[31:05] pride won't even let God use them to
[31:08] worship Him
[31:10] in other words they won't even let their
[31:12] creator be worshiped
[31:15] think I'll think out such an awful thing
[31:17] pride is it exalts itself well I know
[31:20] more about it than God I know more about
[31:22] it than the word of God nobody knows
[31:24] more about it than Jesus praise God
[31:26] hallelujah it's the word of God that
[31:29] matters praise God
[31:31] so see
[31:33] why did David dance brother Adam said
[31:34] David node
[31:36] he was acquainted with the possessor of
[31:38] heavens and earth
[31:42] and here was the word of God coming
[31:45] right back among them and David was so
[31:47] happy he danced he danced just as hard
[31:50] as he could
[31:51] now I'm in danger here if I tried the
[31:53] Bible said he leaped with all of his
[31:55] might if I leave with all my might I
[31:57] might hit my head on the ceiling
[31:59] I'm gonna do it just so you can see what
[32:00] David might have danced like okay David
[32:02] dance I'll just go ah
[32:05] so David danced he jumped as high as he
[32:08] could
[32:09] and God looked down and said That's my
[32:11] boy
[32:13] I'm proud of my son
[32:15] that's what the Bible says amen he's a
[32:19] man after my own heart praise God
[32:24] the Bible said he leaped with all of his
[32:26] might
[32:29] I used to be able to LEAP 24 feet I
[32:30] don't think I can do that anymore
[32:32] but I can sure leap for Jesus back then
[32:34] praise God
[32:35] I just do the best I can now
[32:40] here's the one this was beautiful I
[32:42] didn't preach this yet at our church
[32:44] because I just found the quote a few
[32:45] weeks before we preached there in a
[32:47] poignant brother man said he said
[32:49] sometimes people do get interested too
[32:51] much in Emotion in other words if I
[32:53] don't have some emotion then then God
[32:55] didn't move or God's not with me
[32:57] program tries to bring some balance to
[32:59] that we become interested if if we can
[33:01] dance so see some people just want to
[33:02] know can I dance
[33:04] or can I shout
[33:06] can I speak with tongues perhaps I
[33:08] believe it I believe in every bit of
[33:10] that so dancing shouting speaking of
[33:12] tongues brother man believes in all of
[33:13] that but
[33:15] if we have that and don't have that
[33:18] agonizing weeping broke up Spirit God
[33:21] can never use it
[33:24] so see Church see how it's a bounce
[33:27] now look at that service there two
[33:28] Saturday nights ago what was first the
[33:30] first was the joy and the dancing and
[33:32] then we finished with a bunch of
[33:33] agonizing prayer
[33:35] and calling on God weeping and rejoicing
[33:37] right we're weeping
[33:39] people weeping for the Holy Ghost people
[33:40] weeping for their lost loved ones I
[33:42] thought it was so beautiful that we had
[33:44] both praise God
[33:45] but Church there can be times too where
[33:48] it's just it's just a worship service
[33:49] it's a service where we're supposed to
[33:51] just glorify God God wants us to be
[33:53] thankful God wants us to be happy praise
[33:56] God glad wants to God wants us to
[33:58] rejoice and be glad for all he's done
[34:00] for us praise God
[34:03] what's wrong with that I mean we have a
[34:06] whole day we call Thanksgiving why can't
[34:08] we have a whole church service we call
[34:09] Thanksgiving amen
[34:11] hallelujah amen
[34:14] Glory
[34:15] why can't we
[34:17] the Bible says to do it praise God Amen
[34:20] what is it it's it's demon spear
[34:22] sometimes even in the message and other
[34:24] Baptists and everything that want to
[34:25] hinder worship to God
[34:27] it's that same spirit that was on
[34:29] Michael she wanted to stop David's
[34:31] worship but David said you you don't
[34:32] like that wait till what I do next
[34:36] you didn't like how I ran around he said
[34:38] I'm going to run around again you watch
[34:39] honey sweetheart you watch this I'm
[34:41] going to go praise God I'm gonna jump
[34:43] higher praise God
[34:45] if you don't like that amen because it
[34:48] wasn't for you it was before the Lord
[34:51] praise God
[34:52] amen
[34:55] don't let any demon take your worship
[34:58] for Christ away
[35:00] amen
[35:03] you always got a reason to praise
[35:05] I still got a reason no matter what's
[35:07] going on I still got a reason to praise
[35:08] God
[35:13] then things are good but we got to have
[35:15] the other to go with it we've left off
[35:17] the main thing gone for the secondary so
[35:18] see someone that they just want to dance
[35:20] all the time they just want to shout or
[35:21] they just want to speak in tongues all
[35:22] the time without agonizing in prayer
[35:24] something's wrong
[35:26] because we know what Ezekiel 9 says
[35:28] right God will Mark he's going to mark
[35:31] all the Jews that sigh and cry for the
[35:33] Abominations done in the city
[35:36] and the Bible says we are Kings and
[35:38] Priests unto God
[35:41] and we as priests that means we must
[35:43] intercede for the Lost
[35:45] we must intercede for our families
[35:47] intercede for our friends praise God
[35:49] how many how many how many do that by
[35:51] God's grace
[35:53] you got to have both but the thing of
[35:55] the message is a lot of people just just
[35:56] have I don't even know if they weeper
[35:58] agonize they just go to church do they
[36:00] weep in do they have any weeping
[36:01] Services where they really weep well we
[36:04] know a lot of them don't have dancing
[36:05] services something's wrong with that
[36:08] but Ram just said so
[36:09] right
[36:11] they just don't have enough victory
[36:13] the Sea church I don't want to be a
[36:14] pastor that leads you to to failures I
[36:16] want to be a pastor that points you to
[36:18] victory praise God
[36:19] you can overcome you can be a Victor God
[36:22] will always cause you to Triumph I'm
[36:24] using that again in Christ Jesus amen if
[36:27] God's for you who can be against you
[36:29] praise God
[36:31] Hallelujah
[36:35] who shall lay any charge to God's elect
[36:39] it is God that justifies a Christian
[36:43] amen
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:48] there is no condemnation to them that
[36:52] are in Christ Jesus amen who walk after
[36:55] the spirit and not after the flesh amen
[36:59] oh doesn't that word just energize you
[37:01] praise God
[37:03] that's what mother rep says it's the
[37:04] word that actually brings life amen
[37:07] I have no condemnation God's for me
[37:10] praise God there's no charges against me
[37:12] nothing can separate me from the love of
[37:15] Christ amen
[37:17] that's life amen
[37:19] that's life pouring into your soul
[37:21] Church believe it live by it it's
[37:24] keeping you alive amen
[37:26] ah
[37:29] I'm unrestrained today
[37:31] I hope somebody looks and says ma he's
[37:33] really exuberant today
[37:35] I said that's exactly what the Holy
[37:37] Ghost is praise God
[37:41] all right that's that's the or the
[37:44] finish of that one that's that's all
[37:45] review mostly except for that one quote
[37:47] that's our review now I want to get to
[37:48] my new stuff praise God
[37:50] or maybe things I haven't preached yet
[37:52] now I preach this in Napoleon but not
[37:54] really here the Bible said let them
[37:56] praise the Lord with dance that means
[37:58] you have to allow it
[38:01] the pastors have to allow it
[38:03] and the church said
[38:04] I like how brother Shelley allows it I
[38:06] like that
[38:07] he's got a good Revelation on this
[38:10] you gotta love him
[38:12] people that shut it down shame on them
[38:14] shutting down the spirit of God
[38:17] the Bible says quench not the Holy
[38:19] Spirit
[38:21] remember those verses who's trying to
[38:23] shut down worship it was Michael
[38:26] or McCall I always say McCall
[38:29] it was Judas Iscariot telling uh Lazarus
[38:32] sister don't you don't need to what a
[38:33] waste this was what a waste
[38:37] and Jesus says let her leave her alone
[38:39] praise God
[38:40] Satan get behind her
[38:44] Jesus will always stand up for True
[38:46] worshipers amen
[38:49] see it's the spirit of McCall the spirit
[38:52] on Jesus Judas is scary it's in other
[38:54] words it's Satan's spirit that will try
[38:56] to stop the worship of God
[39:00] right
[39:01] and the Bible said let them praise His
[39:03] name name means Authority or Glory or
[39:06] fame
[39:07] and Jesus means Jehovah is salvation
[39:09] Jehovah means the self-existent one or
[39:11] the existing one
[39:13] so we must allow Jehovah's people to
[39:16] praise His name the existing one in the
[39:19] dance
[39:20] Hallelujah
[39:21] we got to allow it how many how many
[39:24] want to be allowed praise God
[39:26] I don't want to disallow because then I
[39:27] break the scripture
[39:30] Hallelujah if they could dance under the
[39:32] blood of bulls and goats what about the
[39:34] precious blood of Jesus Christ amen
[39:37] yeah the blood of bulls and ghosts just
[39:40] covered over sin
[39:42] it just covered over sin right just
[39:44] covered over but the blood of Jesus
[39:46] Christ abolishes all sin
[39:48] it forgives all sin it sends it away and
[39:53] God doesn't remember praise God
[39:57] because the blood of Jesus Christ speaks
[39:59] better things than the blood of Abel
[40:02] praise God
[40:03] the blood of Abel spoke Vengeance
[40:05] Vengeance Vengeance Jesus blood speaks
[40:07] Mercy forgiveness Grace power and
[40:10] victory praise God
[40:12] victory
[40:16] because remember every time the Old
[40:18] Testament state would leave the
[40:20] sacrifice and think of that they killed
[40:21] the animal they they bled it all out the
[40:23] Bible said they would have a remembrance
[40:25] of their sin to the next time
[40:28] now that's that should help us too
[40:31] that when we come and confess our sins
[40:33] we should truly repent and then we
[40:35] should let the Holy Ghost help us forget
[40:38] I must say it again
[40:40] when we come up for prayer confessing
[40:42] our sinner wherever you confess your sin
[40:44] we should be so in contact with Jesus
[40:46] and say Jesus now help me to forget that
[40:49] I did this so I can walk in the spirit
[40:51] without condemnation
[40:54] because that's the difference between
[40:56] animal blood and Holy Blood
[40:58] oh my God hallelujah there should not be
[41:02] a remembrance
[41:04] of the sins that we did
[41:07] in other words the condemnation should
[41:09] not come back well Jesse you did that
[41:11] last week or you did that last year
[41:14] no there's no more remembrance of it
[41:18] he's renewed my mind amen I Got A
[41:20] Renewed mind he's transformed My Mind by
[41:23] the word of God hallelujah
[41:25] I'm not gonna let that discourage me
[41:27] anymore
[41:28] because it's forgiven
[41:30] it's under the blood praise God
[41:34] so let them praise His name in the dance
[41:37] and dance the Hebrew word means to twirl
[41:39] or whirl so
[41:41] dance means the troll that's why I was
[41:43] twirling up here because that's what it
[41:44] means
[41:45] I thought about that all the planets how
[41:47] they twirl right
[41:49] so when we dance we're just joining
[41:50] creation Hallelujah
[41:52] I thought about this too
[41:54] Ezekiel Saw Jesus as the wheel
[41:57] in the middle of the wheel
[41:59] turning
[42:01] so look at God's spirit God's spirit's
[42:02] always moving to God's always on the
[42:05] Move praise God he's always rejoicing
[42:07] amen he's he's the God of all Victory
[42:09] praise God
[42:12] who's going to defeat God
[42:14] how many believe Jesus always has the
[42:15] victory praise God
[42:17] even in death it was Victory praise God
[42:20] because through death he defeated death
[42:23] Hallelujah
[42:27] so when brother amen opened up with I
[42:29] command my hands and praise the Lord
[42:30] this was exactly the one I was on right
[42:31] here commands the praise the Lord
[42:34] God knows my heart buddy I was like oh
[42:36] that's just my first one that's my first
[42:37] point
[42:39] now look ye that fear the Lord Praise
[42:42] Him how many fear of God today
[42:44] now fear means uh
[42:47] to reverence right to to honor greatly
[42:51] to greatly honor
[42:53] if you fear God you honor him with all
[42:56] your praise with all with all your heart
[42:59] in other words you think of him before
[43:01] anything else
[43:04] I'm honoring him first above everything
[43:06] else
[43:08] if you fear the Lord Praise Him
[43:11] are you the seed of Jacob glorify him
[43:14] and fear Him all ye seed of Israel while
[43:15] you say well I'm not Israel I got some
[43:18] verses Coming For You priest
[43:20] my praise shall be of thee in the great
[43:22] congregation I will pay my vows before
[43:24] them that fear Him
[43:27] the meek shall eat and be satisfied they
[43:29] shall praise the Lord that do what seek
[43:31] him see Church the more you seek God The
[43:34] More You Want To Praise Him
[43:36] because his presence come down and meet
[43:38] you when you seek him
[43:41] Jesus said draw an eye to me I'll draw
[43:43] an eye to you
[43:45] see that's another reason people don't
[43:46] praise God because they haven't been
[43:47] spending any time with God
[43:49] right
[43:51] because they know they don't fear God
[43:52] they don't honor God enough
[43:55] no they're still saved we still got
[43:56] promises salvation but we've got to
[43:58] learn to be a disciple
[44:01] we got to learn to be a follower of
[44:03] Christ to take up the cross daily and
[44:05] follow him
[44:08] he says your heart the speaking of the
[44:10] worshiper your heart shall live forever
[44:13] think of that there's no end to your
[44:14] soul praise God
[44:17] there's going to be an end to the United
[44:18] States there's going to be an end to
[44:20] Death there's going to be an end to war
[44:21] there's going to be end to disease
[44:23] there's going to be an end to cancer but
[44:25] there will be no end to your soul
[44:27] because it's God's Property praise God
[44:30] amen
[44:32] keep seeking God hallelujah
[44:35] so what is fear remember fear is
[44:37] profound honor
[44:40] people have told me this before like
[44:41] they say you go to church twice on
[44:44] Sunday and their eyes get real big like
[44:46] like profound honor I said yeah to them
[44:49] is profound honor now to us it's just
[44:50] that's just how we serve God but they're
[44:52] like all day
[44:56] even Christians
[44:59] they don't they don't have that profound
[45:00] honor
[45:02] I mean you you preach three times a week
[45:06] and they that they they can't understand
[45:08] it but to us it's the joy of being in
[45:11] the presence of Jesus
[45:13] we just do it because we know it's the
[45:14] right thing to do and God blesses us in
[45:17] it
[45:18] we're blessed because we spend this time
[45:20] because we're seeking God there it is
[45:22] amen
[45:23] we're blessed
[45:24] because we see God the more we seek Him
[45:26] the more we find him amen
[45:29] hallelujah praise God
[45:32] what is so fear the lord is profound to
[45:34] honor and remember
[45:36] if you profile profoundly honor Jesus
[45:40] Christ you're going to be what sad or
[45:41] happy what do you think
[45:43] he has made me glad oh he has made me
[45:48] glad I Will Rejoice for he
[45:54] because you feared God Amen
[45:57] [Applause]
[45:59] see when we give God the most honor when
[46:02] we give God the most praise and we seek
[46:04] his face that's when we're the happiest
[46:06] people
[46:08] whether things are going good or bad
[46:11] you know with everything else in our
[46:12] life
[46:13] but that's the key to happiness
[46:15] fearing God profoundly honoring our Lord
[46:19] Jesus Christ
[46:21] how many are witnesses of that praise
[46:23] God
[46:24] he's made me happy
[46:26] remember fear of God is all these things
[46:28] it's moral reverence it's it's your
[46:30] confidence in God if you want confidence
[46:31] in God fear God
[46:34] if you want a refuge fear God
[46:36] if you want a starting place to get more
[46:38] wisdom fear God if you want a fountain
[46:41] flowing with life fear God
[46:45] these are all scriptures I'm not this
[46:46] I'm just summarizing this sermons I
[46:48] preached a while ago
[46:49] if fear is also your anointing to hate
[46:52] evil I keep giving into sin I keep
[46:55] giving a sin well you don't you don't
[46:56] hate evil enough
[46:58] you got to honor God more so you hate
[47:00] the evil
[47:02] oh yes
[47:03] fear is your constant source of
[47:06] happiness
[47:09] and fear the lord is also the conclusion
[47:11] about your life's purpose
[47:14] now more verses rejoice in the Lord oh
[47:17] ye righteous for praise is calmly
[47:19] beautiful for the upright in other words
[47:21] you want to have a beautiful service
[47:23] start praising God
[47:26] you if you want to walk out of those
[47:28] doors and say what a beautiful presence
[47:29] that was somebody needs to start
[47:31] praising God
[47:34] someone needs his heart rejoicing
[47:37] Hallelujah and Haven it can be you too
[47:39] honey

[47:42] God's using some of us somebody's got to
[47:44] start it praise God we all come in here
[47:46] like battle warned veterans like oh I
[47:48] battled all week I don't know if I can
[47:50] praise God but by the end we can be
[47:52] dancing around
[47:53] he just changed the whole situation amen
[47:57] that's true
[48:00] how many times I come to church I'm
[48:02] tired especially on a Wednesday night
[48:03] usually not Sunday morning
[48:05] Wednesday night I'm exhausted I don't
[48:07] feel like preaching I don't feel like
[48:08] singing but pretty soon somebody starts
[48:10] brother amen singing the song very soon
[48:12] hands get clapping pretty soon we start
[48:14] preaching God's word and by the end I
[48:17] can hardly close service now somebody
[48:19] ought to say Amen on that
[48:21] [Applause]
[48:23] somebody ought to say I'm a witness to
[48:24] that he could hardly close service
[48:29] Hallelujah because worshiping God makes
[48:32] a beautiful atmosphere praise God
[48:34] amen
[48:37] well that's a beautiful service bro
[48:38] Jesse why because everybody started
[48:39] rejoicing

[49:19] and play skillfully with the Quiet noise
[49:21] every time no with a loud noise
[49:24] oh my now Church remember you gotta
[49:27] balance that be still and know that I'm
[49:29] God
[49:30] there are seasons of mourning where
[49:32] everybody's hurting in the church or
[49:33] we're trying we're trying to enter into
[49:35] the suffering of somebody else those
[49:37] should be quiet services

[49:40] God strengthen our sister we're seeking
[49:43] your face we know your God even though
[49:45] this tragedy happened or even though
[49:46] this difficult things happen I know
[49:48] you're God
[49:50] Hallelujah but there's other times it's
[49:53] time to make some noise praise God

[50:11] the word of God the word sets us free
[50:13] the word gives us Victory praise God
[50:19] and remember none of these are
[50:20] suggestions um you might want to try a
[50:22] new song sometime or you know consider

[56:17] who's like our Lord God who humbles
[56:19] himself to behold the things there in
[56:21] heaven and in Earth remember he's
[56:23] outside of Heaven if this is heaven he's
[56:25] he's outside of that he's so great I
[56:27] mean his spirit is just outside of that
[56:28] and then Earth is down the Earth Is His
[56:29] footstool
[56:30] so there's Earth here's Heaven God's he
[56:33] just is above all that and yet he
[56:36] humbles himself to minister to the to
[56:37] speak to the angels and then he humbles
[56:39] himself to speak to you and I

[57:18] the spiritual
[57:19] we were dirt poor six kids uh my parents
[57:22] were divorced living off of government
[57:23] food and God Raised Me Out of the Dust

[57:31] where now I can feed eight children and
[57:33] I don't need government assistance

[57:38] got Heavenly government assistance if I
[57:39] can say that

[58:07] and bring them into Jesus Christ who is
[58:10] the word of God
[58:14] he lifts the needy out of the dunghill
[58:16] dunghill
[58:18] what an awful place to be a dung Hill
[58:21] but Jesus lifts people out of that place
[58:24] the place of waste right the waste place
[58:26] he brings you out of the waste Place
[58:29] Hallelujah
[58:31] and he lifts you up he improves your
[58:33] life how many thank God he improves your
[58:35] life
[58:38] he improves your health brother Harley
[58:39] Danny
[58:42] hallelujah praise God
[58:45] he lifts us up
[58:47] why because he wants to be praised
[58:49] that's why Arley can come and praise the
[58:51] Lord right
[58:53] hallelujah praise God
[58:55] that's his job that's this is our God
[58:58] this is who he is amen
[59:00] he loves us he saves us this is who
[59:03] Christ is amen
[59:06] he loves us and saves us praise God
[59:09] saves us from ourselves
[59:12] oh praise the Lord all you Nations
[59:15] praise him all so well brothers that was
[59:18] just for the Jews well here he said oh
[59:20] nice
[59:22] you're all
[59:24] a Double L brother man says for his
[59:27] merciful kindness is great towards us
[59:29] and the truth of the Lord endures
[59:32] forever praising the Lord
[59:36] Paul cites this in Romans 19.
[59:40] so Paul is telling the Romans you know
[59:41] you need to praise God too
[59:44] not just the Jews
[59:46] Gentiles need to praise God to
[59:49] you need to praise God with some dance
[59:52] you need to praise God with some shouts
[59:55] some ringing I'm not even sure how to
[59:58] Voice rings but
[59:59] he said that the Gentiles might glorify
[1:00:01] God for his Mercy why because he's been
[1:00:03] merciful to you he didn't give you what
[1:00:06] you deserved
[1:00:08] he spared you from what you deserved
[1:00:13] as is written for this cause I will
[1:00:15] confess to thee among the Gentiles and
[1:00:17] sing
[1:00:18] unto thy name and again he said Rejoice
[1:00:20] ye Gentiles with Israel
[1:00:24] Gentiles you just start just dance just
[1:00:26] like Israel dances
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:32] and again so three three scriptures he
[1:00:34] quotes for the Gentiles to praise God
[1:00:37] like the Jews Praise You the Lord on
[1:00:39] your Gentiles and Lord him all ye people
[1:00:42] that means honor
[1:00:44] honor them all you people that's the
[1:00:47] that's the verse from Isaiah I'm sorry
[1:00:49] from Saul
[1:00:52] now here's the verse church when you
[1:00:54] clap It's actually an expression of joy
[1:00:59] all right
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:05] let the floods clap their hands
[1:01:08] let the Hills
[1:01:10] joyful together all nations I thank you
[1:01:13] for the rain thank you for the blessings
[1:01:15] thank you for opening up heaven and we
[1:01:18] ought to praise God too amen
[1:01:21] ah
[1:01:24] thus save the Bible praise God
[1:01:27] go to Isaiah 55 12 the same thing
[1:01:32] oh you clap too much or what do you mean
[1:01:35] God said Praise Him from the time I wake
[1:01:37] up to the time I go to bed
[1:01:40] and if I want to clap why can't I clap
[1:01:41] praise God
[1:01:44] shame on these people that they just
[1:01:46] they have a critical spirit or something
[1:01:48] but God's God's faithful praise God
[1:01:50] God will God will help them if they're
[1:01:52] true children of God oh yeah they'll
[1:01:53] they'll get straightened out real quick
[1:01:55] if they're really children of God like
[1:01:58] brother Irvin said there a couple weeks
[1:01:59] ago
[1:02:00] he was just crying he was rejoicing
[1:02:01] after that sermon and uh excited about
[1:02:04] being baptized he just said brother
[1:02:05] Jesse he kind of I'm just trying to
[1:02:07] remember the best he could but brother
[1:02:08] Irvin said to think about this he said
[1:02:10] I'm 59 years old and most people this
[1:02:13] age cannot change their ways
[1:02:16] he said but look what God has done he's
[1:02:18] opened up my eyes and my whole life is
[1:02:20] changing
[1:02:22] before my very eyes
[1:02:24] he said because in the Amish community
[1:02:25] once you're stuck in a way you're in
[1:02:27] that way right
[1:02:29] but Jesus comes in he changes everything
[1:02:31] he turns the page brother amen
[1:02:34] he takes your ashes he gives you beauty
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:38] he takes your morning he gives you
[1:02:40] dancing Hallelujah
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:49] thank god brother Harley
[1:02:51] hallelujah praise God
[1:02:54] that's what Jesus Christ does amen
[1:02:57] and with tears he said I'm 59 and my
[1:03:00] life is transforming before my very eyes
[1:03:03] amen he said the thing that God would do
[1:03:05] that for me
[1:03:07] and other people he says they just can't
[1:03:08] see it that just shows he's elect
[1:03:11] God chose him before the foundation of
[1:03:13] the world
[1:03:16] oh thank you Lord
[1:03:18] Isaiah 55 12.
[1:03:23] for ye shall go out with joy
[1:03:26] and be led forth with peace
[1:03:31] the mountains in the Hills shall Break
[1:03:32] Forth before you into singing think
[1:03:34] about that mountains and Hills will sing
[1:03:36] before them
[1:03:38] and all the trees of the fields shall
[1:03:40] clap their hands
[1:03:43] so when Israel goes out with joy and
[1:03:46] peace all creations clapping clapping
[1:03:49] with them all your God's people you're
[1:03:52] God's children hallelujah oh they just
[1:03:55] go out everywhere oh my God it's for me
[1:03:57] praise God our Nature's with me praise
[1:03:59] God who can stop me praise God
[1:04:03] only my sin can stop me
[1:04:06] only my sin can stop me
[1:04:09] right because all Nature's for me God's
[1:04:11] for me
[1:04:13] only my Disobedience will stop the
[1:04:15] blessing of God
[1:04:21] right that's what the book of
[1:04:22] lamentation says let me find that real
[1:04:24] quick here
[1:04:27] what was it uh sin has taken away the
[1:04:30] dance

[1:07:31] for uh let me close with these some
[1:07:33] quotes from other brand just I think
[1:07:34] there'll be encouragement to you
[1:07:36] I'll say that for maybe Wednesday by
[1:07:37] God's grace
[1:07:40] tonight I think with the children I'll
[1:07:41] teach on the 30 Bible verses that Define
[1:07:43] the message I put that video out
[1:07:44] yesterday I don't know if anybody saw
[1:07:45] but
[1:07:46] um
[1:07:47] we've gone through like
[1:07:49] 12 of them in our Bible says okay praise
[1:07:51] God
[1:07:52] that's the combat all these people say
[1:07:53] the tapes are the message I know brother
[1:07:55] man said the Bible is a message
[1:07:58] the tapes point us to the message
[1:08:01] the message is Jesus Christ is the same
[1:08:03] yesterday that's already in the Bible
[1:08:04] That's Hebrews 13 8. that's that's what
[1:08:06] the message is
[1:08:07] but these uh brand of worshipers and
[1:08:09] tapers were shame on them but that's why
[1:08:12] I got to do that so to prove to them
[1:08:13] that their own Prophet said that
[1:08:17] they claim to believe
[1:08:22] I I don't know I don't I don't think I

[1:08:49] just go there to be alone
[1:08:51] my soul
[1:08:52] we live there and look at the stars
[1:08:55] think about that
[1:08:57] he spent time just going out just to
[1:08:59] spend time with God and just look at
[1:09:00] nature
[1:09:02] just to relax and love God
[1:09:06] and there come up a storm I had to get

[1:16:44] real happy
[1:16:46] and what did I do I run around and
[1:16:49] around the tree can you imagine right
[1:16:50] around he's cried
[1:16:53] hear an elk and he's seen he's seeing
[1:16:56] wolf he's hearing wolves and everything
[1:16:57] and he's running around I see God
[1:16:59] everywhere I see God everywhere I see
[1:17:02] God everywhere he I see God everywhere
[1:17:05] and look to her she don't say it's
[1:17:06] terrible or horrible either
[1:17:09] who does he compare himself to
[1:17:14] if somebody would have been out there
[1:17:16] they would have thought I was out of the
[1:17:18] insane Institution
[1:17:20] I hope they think that about me too
[1:17:23] because then I can say well I'm like
[1:17:24] brother Branham
[1:17:26] and then I can say I'm like David
[1:17:29] I'm like Miriam praise God
[1:17:34] if somebody was out there they say you
[1:17:36] were insane I didn't care what people
[1:17:38] thought remember him that one guy with
[1:17:39] him
[1:17:40] he said God was all around I was
[1:17:43] worshiping him like David who danced
[1:17:46] before the ark
[1:17:49] Hallelujah
[1:17:51] so brought him dance in the church so
[1:17:54] can I praise God Brethren dance out of

[1:18:04] his Mercy we can only Praise Him amen
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:09] thank God Amen
[1:18:13] he's worthy of all of our praise
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:19] but what do you see church I see what
[1:18:22] the Bible says I see Jesus
[1:18:25] Jehovah that's what we see we see the
[1:18:27] same thing
[1:18:28] I see Jehovah in my life
[1:18:31] and let's remember that he tasted death
[1:18:33] for all of us
[1:18:34] but now he's alive
[1:18:37] now he's alive
[1:18:38] we see Jesus
[1:18:41] yeah that's my last one let's stand here
[1:18:43] musicians could come
[1:18:46] some people think brother Graham doesn't
[1:18:48] agree with dancing well what about all
[1:18:50] the quotes I showed you
[1:18:51] what about brother Brad himself dancing
[1:18:55] but brother I tell you on the day of
[1:18:57] Pentecost it was like a Russian Mighty
[1:18:58] Wind come from heaven filled all the
[1:19:00] house where they were sitting
[1:19:02] Hallelujah brother the building wasn't
[1:19:04] big enough to hold them
[1:19:06] now last couple of nights ago I almost
[1:19:08] said let's go dance out in the streets
[1:19:11] I almost start God knows my heart I
[1:19:13] almost said let's take this Jericho
[1:19:15] March out on the street
[1:19:17] but then people started praying I'm like
[1:19:19] okay well I'm gonna stop that now it's
[1:19:20] time to intercede praise God
[1:19:22] I was almost right I was going to say
[1:19:23] Saints let's go out in the streets
[1:19:26] follow me
[1:19:30] Hallelujah because that's what they did
[1:19:31] on the day of Pentecost
[1:19:34] that's what they did they weren't afraid
[1:19:37] let me say like this this the sanctuary
[1:19:39] ain't big enough to worship God
[1:19:43] Hallelujah

[1:19:47] one of these days we're gonna dance
[1:19:48] right out there in the parking lot
