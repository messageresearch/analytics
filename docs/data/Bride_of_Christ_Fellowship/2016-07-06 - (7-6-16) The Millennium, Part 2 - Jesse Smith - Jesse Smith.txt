trust you love him tonight amen with all your heart let's say to our feet let's open our Bibles here this evening by the grace of the Lord like to uh look at the Millennium part two tonight by God's grace that'll be our our text for this evening uh so let's open up if we can uh back to Revelation chapter 20 let's start there by the grace of the Lord because i' like to end there Lord willing at the end of the message here Revelation chapter 20 appreciate all the saints pressing the W to the house of God tonight amen all the sacrific that been made praise God whenever we come expecting God never fails to fulfill our desires praise the Lord I never left a service where God didn't bless me somehow whether through correction or strength or healing or something he's always blessed each and every one of us somehow thank God for that Revelation chapter 20 verse [Music] one like to if we can read through verses 1 through six a very important text and then later you know we'll be looking at verses 7 through uh 7 through 10 but this just for the text I want to read 1 to six kind of getting in of course into future things prophetic things and so forth like that so we just do the best we can to stay with the word and brother's teaching on this topic the verse one Revelation 20 verse1 if you're there say amen and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the balus pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years now look he's called a dragon serpent devil Satan does that mean he's four persons no he just got four different titles there right his actual name is Lucifer but he's got all those different titles verse three and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more so the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season remember the Bible said the mark of the beast would be received by All Nations that includes China the US Australia you name all nations will take the mark of the beast verse four and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them so not him but them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God these are Christians that believe the New Testament and the Old Testament right because brother B taught that the word of God is the Old Testament and the testimony Jesus was the New Testament being a Christian finishing verse four and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection lesson is Holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they should be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him Thousand Years amen we would be blessed and holy to be part of that first resurrection let's bow our heads if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God as we pray before we enter into this time Heavenly Father we love you Lord so much the scripture says blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness I believe the Saints here tonight have come not to see a man or a woman or anything Lord but to see you they hunger and thirst for the righteousness of Jesus Christ Lord may you grant that to each of us I'm Desiring that I'm hungry and thirsting for more knowledge of the holy word of God more spiritual strength oh God more Revelation more power in my life Lord to overcome Temptations and sin and wickedness in the world and Satan oh God we know it's possible we know it'll be received tonight as we worship and believe so father take this word break it to us oh God that we can understand it Lord and prepare us for that great Millennial time that we could be a part of it we would be the bless we would be the holy we'd be Lord such character that you could commit Judgment of Nations unto us Lord a rulership of Nations unto us Believers Lord we feel so inadequate but Lord but all things are possible by your spirit as we say not by our might or by our power but by your spirit sayeth the Lord all these things are possible so help us in the midst of Leia and Satan's Eden help us oh God to have a a Christian Eden here tonight Lord a holy atmosphere holy love for you we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen God bless you to being seated here praise God so let's look at this thought here tonight the Millennium part um part two here and we'll go from there God's grace now Malachi can you do me a favor buddy can you bring me the uh remote there for the LG it's LG I would just want to quickly review uh uh the the Sunday night message so everybody can see that by God's grace thank you sir see and we'll look at that here tonight by God's grace as we said you know we spend a lot of time here uh trying to just stay with the message say what brother Bram said say what the scriptures say that's our desire tonight just keep doing that uh and being as faithful as we can to the word of the Lord and uh getting the victory praise God we'll be certainly Victors if we're a part of this millennium amen certainly be some Victor so let me pull this up here by God's grace that on so we'll look at a quick review of part one and uh hope everybody enjoyed that by God's grace on Sunday night then we'll go a little bit further here I'm sorry Mercy the one two many times okay so we like to continue on this thought here so we'll look here and uh there we go so I'm just going to quickly go through this we looked at our text here now our main text was out of Isaiah 65 so let's just go back there and briefly read that Isaiah 65 from Sunday night we looked at that this is the the scripture we hear most often when you hear people talk about the Millennium you talk about the line laying down with the land and the meeting strong together and so forth let's look at that we'll start at verse 19 Isaiah 6519 and I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there should be no more V an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die and 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them verse 22 they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of the tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain and bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the bless of the Lord and their offspring with them and this should come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they're yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bulock and dust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy Mountain sayith the Lord amen so most of us are familiar with that text there that's where we get a lot of our teaching on the Millennium and as you remember from Sunday night there's a few things that brother Brandon wasn't quite sure about uh they asked him will there be any death in Millennium or there be any children M and he said I don't know it sounds a lot like there could be sounds a lot like there might not be he said when God lets me know let you know about it so as far as we know we don't know it we're not for sure but in the scripture we see it talks about dying and so forth it talks about a cursing even even this in this text here so for for that part I just can't interpret that because brother Brandon didn't really interpret it for us and a prophet is one who's called to interpret the word so we just leave that not sure but we uh went on Wednesday night and we or Sunday night rather we showed how there's three comings of Christ to redeem the bride to Rapture the bride and Rule with the bride in the millennium Prophet taught us that and we read through our teaching on Isaiah 65 where we get a lot of our teaching we showed though how the new Earth is not the millenum on Sunday night they're two different things I'll just show the picture um right there so here's the new Earth and the new heavens and the new Earth it's the eighth day uh the Millennium though is the seventh day or Thousand Years the Thousand Years of Peace we've had 6,000 years of human history since Adam from what brother brandom taught uh but after the Rapture we'll have a Thousand-Year Millennium what God will finally have his day of rest praise God and then after that thousand year Millennium there'll be the Battle of go and Magog and then the white Throne judgment uh and then we'll break into eternity new Heavens new Earth where there's no time anymore okay we looked at that and then we saw how there had to be a cleansing of the battle or the uh the tribulation and battle of Armageddon get the Earth ready for the Millennium and then we'll walk up out on the ashes of the wicked Jesus rules on the earth uh on the throne of David okay as the son of David during Millennium that's what that's for the son of David he son of man he was son of man in his Earthly ministry right now he's Son of God His Holy Spirit and then Millennium he'll be son of David uh ruling the world here and we saw that we saw the pictures here on Sunday night right now he's on the father's Throne as Son of God when the Millennium he'll be on uh his own throne here on the earth the son of David we saw that on Sunday night praise God uh we saw the foolish virgin will not be a part of the millenum miss that because it's only for the elect praise God uh the only ones that'll be able to make that uh okay we went over that the day of the Lord is actually the day when um it's the day where God brings forth judgment we'd say Armageddon and so forth and then the Millennium God gets his day or thousand years with his bride that's the day of the Lord uh we looked at more Bible teaching the the righteous literally walk in the Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked from Malachi 4 uh verses 1 through six there we're not going to like said we're just quickly reviewing um Satan is bound during the Millennium he's literally not on the earth he's literally Bound in the bottomless pit uh and that's important because a lot of people say you know the Rapture is already happened they say the raptures happen because uh they they take the quote where brother R said the shout voice Trump and they say the shouts gone forth so the Rapture is already started and they take that uh and don't realize it's a three-step process right shout voice and then the truck The Voice the resurrection that wakes the sleeping uh bride like St Paul and different ones down through the age and the trumpet brother the trumpet is the voice of Christ so he said the final voice calling the bride off the Earth will be the the Trump so uh they get that confused so it's important that we uh get that straight we went over some quotes where brother B talked about it leoa the leoan age last as long as the brides here at the at the Rapture that's when leoan ends right the age itself ends that's true and then we saw how brother said we're not sure if there's children born in the mnium or not he said if God ever reveals it I'll let you know but it has to come from God okay there's no sin on the earth during the Millennium according to what we understand and we'll be in glorified bodies in the Millennium eating and drinking and building as we saw the Bible said we'll build and so forth okay the honey the Millennium is the honeymoon uh the Rapture is the wedding you went over that uh I think yeah we're Kings we ended with we're Kings and Priests on the earth okay so we saw we Clos by saying uh the Bible said we're already Kings and Priests and brother Braham said we are Kings because we rule over sin right now in our lives so we should rule our homes we should rule the church uh by ruling over sin and then we're priest by praying worshiping and making sacrifices unto God interceding okay so uh I want to just play that now I want to put this up here while I'm preaching I haven't preached this message yet but I want to preach this message on the two resurrections pretty soon I just want to show the picture while we're preaching okay I just want to show this how many know there's two resurrections praise God the first resurrection is the rapture okay and whoever is a part of that Resurrection right there they of course they live they don't live through the tribulation but the tribulation is going on while there're at the wedding supper uh and then they come back all Christ and all the saints come back for the batt battle of Armageddon Earth is burned over with fire and then you uh live as part of the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign and then we also were gathered with the Saints in Christ uh when the Satan you know circles around the the Saints and fire comes down from heaven and destroys Satan so forth uh but the second Resurrection is the white Throne judgment where everybody the Bible said all those that are in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man okay so I just want to leave this up here so we can get this straight uh if you're not if not for certain on that I'll preach a separate sermon on this I just wanted to give you that visual is that okay does that help by God's grace there's two resurrections okay it's important that we're part of the first one those that are in the first resurrection are blessed and holy amen that's what we want to be tonight by God's grace okay now let's get to some fresh stuff that was about seven minutes or eight minutes of review there um I want to read this here brother tells us this in 1961 says but Jesus will not be on earth now the Messiah will not be on the Earth until the Millennium sets in because the church were're caught up together to meet the Lord in the air he never comes to Earth he catches his bride away okay so when the when the Rapture takes place where does Jesus come he doesn't touch the Earth he meets Us in the air right like Isaac Isaac wasn't in his house right uh when he met Rebecca he went out into the field right and he didn't go all the way to Rebecca's home right he met her halfway you would say he met her halfway he met her out in the field and then he took Rebecca into his home so that's a beautiful type of Jesus Christ here so Jesus when he comes back he meets Us in the air he doesn't come down to the Earth because the Earth is filled with sin and so forth brother said he catches his bride away brother said he gets a ladder so Christ has a ladder and it goes from Heaven down to the sky right we have ladders that goes from Earth up to the sky but Jesus's ladder starts from Heaven comes down halfway to the to the air right but man said he gets lad you know like that play uh he says Romeo and Juliet brother R says he put the ladder up and stole his bride away see now he's just coming down Jacob's Ladder and say sweetheart come here we're going up to meet him amen so we put ladders to go from Earth to the air but Jesus uses Jacob's Ladder to go from Heaven down to the sky down to the air amen and we'll rise up Jacob's Ladder for the Rapture amen hallelujah because Jacob's Ladder goes up to heaven and at the top of Jacob's Ladder what we see the son of man praise God Jesus Christ himself amen now brother tells us this so uh we've been looking at this with the Ephesian Church age I'm sorry Ephesians parallels Joshua we I want to read this quote as well the promised land for Israel was not a type of the Millennium it was a type of the Holy Ghost I want to make sure I read that he says many people refer to the promised land as the Millennium it's not the Promised Land had Wars and killings the Millennium won't have any wars or killings it's referred to the Holy Spirit the Battlegrounds okay so in Israel I just want to read over a few quotes when Israel left Egypt that was justification when their Wilderness sanctification when they took over the promised land and went into the promised land that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God them crossing over was not the Millennium brother BR said the Millennium was tiped by Solomon how many knew that Solomon where they had total peace for about 40 years or so that typed of Millennium and he says it right here greater than Solomon is here in 1963 now the days of Solomon any scriptural man knows that was the Golden Age of the Hebrews they had no Wars it was almost like a millennium to them a great day they built the temple All Nations feared them they afraid to do anything because they know that the people was of one heart and one Accord God gave them a gift and they believed it they accepted it with one heart in in one Accord they worked with it praise the Lord all right so I hope just want to read those two quotes and one more here the Bible said this here I'm sorry brother says this in Fellowship 1960 when he lets a man live through the thousand years it's a type and a memorial to that he will never no more destroy man and will never more be there will never be no more sin that he's back in fellowship with God eternally so the Millennium there is to show that God will finish a day he will finish a day with no sin he will finish a day with complete perfect fellowship with with his creation amen so the church has to fight against sin we fight against sin all the way up to the Rapture and then we live without sin for a thousand years showing that there will come a time later new Heavens Earth where there's no sin at all and that restores the fellowship so we're GNA have a whole complete day of that wonderful Fellowship praise the Lord all right thank you now let's get into some scriptures have your Bibles let's look at Revelation Chapter 2 you got your Bibles Malachi you can to be ready to read Lydia you have your Bible honey okay just it's helpful if you can read that Revelation 2 Malachi go to Revelation 2:26 and then Lydia can you go to Revelation 125 so Malachi can you read Revelation 2 26 and 27 can you read both of those Malachi 26 and 27 and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shiers even as I received of my father amen praise God how many believe those are red letter words your eyes tell you that so what did Jesus say to him that overcomes I will give power over the Nations now look at that that's this ain't some fairy tale if you can overcome Satan in your personal life Jesus says you're worthy to rule a nation my goodness and we're elting people that can't even rule over their email right or can't even rule over their tongue they can't even control their cussing and swearing they can't even rule over lust you know because I know certain candidates have uh all kinds of evil clubs and all kinds of been married three four times they can't even rule over their own personal lives Jesus said they're not going to rule in the Millennium amen someone who overcomes Satan will rule in the Millennium praise God now look at verse uh okay now that he shall rule them with a rod of iron right as the vessels of a Potter should be broken to Shivers you see how all the nations will be broken all their powers will be broken all sin will be broken in the Millennium even as I received my father so praise God okay now Lydia Revelation 125 please and C up okay so who's that speaking of brother BR said Revelation 12 has nothing to do with the bride Revelation 12 is Israel right so she that's the nation of Israel brought forth a Manchild who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron now notice Jesus rules but we have power over Nations catch that Jesus rules all of it in the Millennium but he gives us power over Nations okay that's the absolute scripture there we can see that now I'm going to read Revelation 19:15 if you want to turn there Revelation 19:15 so who's in the Millennium Christ is in the Millennium the bride's in the Millennium the Overcomer in the New Testament which is the bride she's in the Millennium there's no foolish virgin in the Millennium there's no Satan in the Millennium thank God for that amen now later I'm going to bring a little surprise here I don't know if you know brother said some things but there's uh there are some people there in the Millennium according to the Bible there are nations in the Millum okay but we hit this first okay re Revelation 19:15 now this is at the battle of Armageddon this is what it speaks right here and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God Amen so Jesus pours out the wrath of almighty God but what does he rule the nations with a rod of of iron which is his word praise God Amen smites the Nations rules him with a rod of iron praise the Lord now here's what brother ad said in 1964 he said there're the ones that will go up from the tribulation but the rest of them will go through the tribulation go down and everything everything will be killed before the Millennium the righteous shall come out in the Millennium and live a thousand years and after the Thousand Years then the great white Throne judgment comes and then the dead both right and wrong is raised and the books were open the book of life was open and the Saints the wife and the husband set and judged the world and there it comes to pass the saying he'll judge all nations with the rod of iron All Nations shall stand before him there and he'll judge them with the rod of iron he'll separate the sheep from the ghats and say the ghosts depart and he'll say to the Sheep Come Ye bless are my father praise the Lord so let's just get the picture after the Rapture after the Rapture all the saints go up who overcome all sin of of their age they're the bride they come back down Jesus smites the nations with the sword that comes out of his mouth uh fire burns the Earth brother said volcanic and atomic burns the Earth cleanses it so Jesus can stand upon the Earth and during the thousand years we have the bride which we believe we're a part of have power over Nations but Jesus rules all nations with a rod of iron and then those same uh Saints in Jesus Will judge at the white Throne judgment they will the Bible said judgment was given unto them at the white Throne judgment all right what a promise Church none of us are worthy that promise praise the Lord none of us are worthy but his blood makes us worthy praise praise the Lord the bible say that they that are called are faithful and chosen and are worthy but we don't feel that way of our flesh we're not worthy but by the grace of God he makes us worthy by the washing of regeneration of the holy spirit amen now I want to say this too also in the Millennium there's another group right we said Satan's not there foolish virgin's not there Christ is there the bride's there there's another group that's there the 144,000 is there brother says this so the 144,000 that get sealed during the tribulation right they get sealed under the Sixth Seal they get sealed during the tribulation period and then they have to die as Martyrs the Bible said they have to die as Martyrs but then they get resurrected uh for the Thousand-Year millennium says this in the church age book now these 144,000 are not the bride in Revelation 144 they're called virgins and they follow the lamb whe so whever so he goeth the fact that they've not devide themselves with women shows they are Unix according to Matthew 19:12 the Unix were the keepers of the bridal Chambers they were attendants notice they did not sit in the throne but they're Before the Throne no they not in the bride but will be in the the Glorious Millennial Reign amen so the Jews will be there the 144,000 now here's what he says again teaches in the church ages now after the tribulation period during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel 48 1-8 we see the tribes back once more in divine order let turn there you got your Bible Ezekiel 48 Ezekiel 48 if you remember the seal this is what brother Brandon preaches for about an hour and a half before he goes into the actual seven seal he preaches on Israel back in the Millennium how they'll be back the tribes will be back in order now Ezekiel 48 1-8 and then he said 22 to 29 so we got time tonight we got time we'll read that by God's grace we'll read that one through eight now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of hethlon as one goeth to HTH has aan the board of Damascus northward to the coast of HTH for these are his sides East and West a portion for Dan and by the border of Dan from the East side and the West Side a portion for Asher by the border of Asher from the East side even unto the West Side a portion for naftali and by the border of naali from the East side into the West Side a portion for manasse and by the border of Manasseh and from the East side unto the West Side a portion for Ephraim and by the border of Ephraim from the East side into the West Side a portion for Reuben and by the border of Ruben from the east side of the West Side a portion for Judah and by the border of Judah from the east side of the West Side shall be the offering which he shall offer of five and 20,000 reads in breadth and in length as one of the other parts from the East side into the west side and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it amen so there's a sanctuary during the millenni we're gonna get to that in a moment too the oblation that ye shall offer un the Lord shall be of five and 20,000 in length and of 10,000 in breadth amen so see back in the millenni we have the 12 tribes of Israel ministering and bringing offerings unto the Lord okay now he says he quotes the next scripture verses 22 to 29 so let's go to 22 so here's where he quotes the rest of the tribes verse 22 more over from the possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city being in the midst of that which is the princes between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince as for the rest of the tribes from the East side into the West Side Benjamin shall have a portion by the border of Benjamin from the east side of the West Side Simeon shall a portion and by the border of Simeon from the east side of the West issachar a portion and by the border of isachar from the East side and the West Side zebulun a portion and by the border of zebulun from the East side and the West Side Gat a portion it goes up to what 29 yes and by the border of GAD at the South Side Southward the Border shall be even unto Tamar unto the Waters of strife in Kadesh and the river toward the great sea this is the land which you shall divide by lot under the tribes of Israel for inheritance and these are their portions saith the Lord God amen glory so even uh these tribes although right now they're not quite recognized uh they will be back in order during the Millennium and the sanctuary the Bible said the sanctuary shall be in the midst of the tribes amen just like in the days of Moses amen is that all the tribes were were in a cross uh four sides of the great Tabernacle so will they be back in order by the grace of God you know I was talking to a brother and you know he was telling me he read some research I think it was Brother D Smith was telling me that uh the Jewish people the Jewish scientists were actually the ones who have come up with all this DNA technology anybody ever heard of ancestry.com uh I got a little gift there so I set my I set my DNA so I'm going to get the results back in a little bit and see what all the parts of my all the parts of H bloodline that are in my that in me I guess I guess I'll say it like that uh but the people behind all that the research was the Jews I think they want I think they want an award for that some type of a scientific award uh but Church you know why they won that or you know why they studied that because it's so important for them that they have their bloodlines all set in order right they want the bloodline of uh because only Levites can handle uh the sacrifices right brother bam said thus sayith the Lord they'll rebuild that temple in the Holy Land they're going to rebuild it and they can only have Levites so Israel was at the Forefront of bringing uh this DNA technology so they can figure out who's Levi who's Asher who's napali who's Manasseh they got to have the right kind of people the right the right tribe handling the fire of God again and so here they are at the very Forefront of Technology preparing uh to know who the Levites are so that they can uh reinstitute their Temple worship amen and then Jesus comes back and he's going to say I'm I was that sacrificial land I was the Lamb of God that you rejected and the Bible said they'll mourn from house to house for days and they'll cry but when they come down to it the all 144,000 will be born again in a day the Bible say the nation of Israel will be born in one day amen so there we go there's a scriptures brother said these teach that the 12 tribes of Israel will be back in order during the Millennium I'm going to keep reading here he said Ezekiel 48 we see the tribes back in order he says but from the time that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to Idols they died and those tribes have no more recognition so right now the tribe of Dan and Ephraim will have no recognition during this of course Church age or even there during the tribulation he said now realize that since the destruction of Jerusalem all records of all tribes have been lost that no one can say for sure what tribe he's from but God knows the great God who's bringing Israel back to palestin knows exactly which uh tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing so Dan and Ephraim are missing in Revelation 7 so let's read that you got your Bibles Revelation 7 so we read the millennial scriptures with 12 tribes but the 144,000 tribulation Dan and Ephraim are missing let's read that and after these things I sorry Revelation 71 after these things I saw Four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he CRI with a loud voice of the Four Angels to whom it was given to HT the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 140 and 4,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asher were sealed 12,000 the tribe of nepalian were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Manasses were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of isachar were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Zeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 amen all right I know that's a lot of reading there but did you see Dan and Ephraim were not a part of that because they committed idolatry okay now remember what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6 idolators will not inherit the kingdom of God praise the Lord so someone cannot have an idol above God said a piano can be an idol a car could be an idol he said your spouse or your children can be an idol anything that you give more glory to God anything gets more time attention more love more worship than God is an idol so idolatry kept these 12 TR or these two tribes from receiving the Holy Ghost and so it does today praise God idolatry keeps people from being filled with the Holy Ghost today because it's something they love more than God we must make sure God is the greatest desire of our hearts that's why I'm constantly saying we cannot let anything get in the way of Bible reading of prayer time of coming to church brother said Never Lose Your Enthusiasm what's he saying always keep Jesus number one in your life amen always make sure he's the number one remember he said set your ction on things above make sure the things you love the most are not the things of the Earth but the things from above the way you do that is staying in the presence of God keeping yourself where the blessings of God are flowing out amen glory praise God and I know sometimes there are temptations there are distractions but the thing to do is repent and get back to God keep in your first love and keep the word of God number one in your life always because idolators will not have the Holy Ghost and they will not inherit the Millennium oh my so thank the Lord so now we know more people that's going to be in the Millennium now let me read you this quote and if you got your Bibles go to Revelation 20 got your Bibles Revelation 20 because I want to show just a few scriptures here and there's another group that's going to be in the Millennium according to the Bible and brother R tells us it's the Heathen that never heard the message okay I know that's kind of shocking to us but brother Ram said it and the Bible does say there's going to be Nations that get deceived at the end of the Millennium so they're going to live they're going to live without deception for a thousand years but then at the end of the Thousand Years Satan is loosed right and he goes out and deceives the Nations and that's quite that's quite a thing all right so the Millennium we we think it just be the Bride In Christ 144,000 but the Bible said there's Nations during the land that get deceived oh my the Bible's Rich okay Revelation 20 verse three verse uh three and cast Satan him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose a little season okay now go to verse 7 Revelation 20 verse 7 now that might shock you Church uh but the Bible said there will be Nations remember the Bible said there'll be children in the Millennium a child will be born and all these things so it seems like there there's going to be Nations during the Millennium because we have to rule over somebody how can you have power over Nations if the nations are empty and there's nobody in the Nations right okay so verse seven Revelation 20 verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth so Satan has to deceive somebody look what happens God meog to gather them together to battle now listen how many is it how many nations are there how many people are there the Bible tells us right here the number of whom is as the sand of the sea that's a lot of people you can have a lot of people more than a thousand years right oh my verse n and they went up on the breath of the Earth Encompass the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved city what city is that Jerusalem isn't that the Beloved City so Satan deceives all these nations the numbers of sand of the sea and he brings them to surround that holy city that beloved City that lovely city of Jerusalem and fire came down out of heaven and what devoured them isn't that a striking picture so for a thousand years there's going to be brother Bram says they're Heathen now let me read you the quote can I read you the quote from questions answers 1962 and then at the return of the church and the bride the Bride In Christ shall walk out upon the ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and there they shall reign and the heathens that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested if he's to Reign he's got to have something to Reign Over he's got a and they ruled and reign with Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of iron the Nations then the sons of God I'm sorry then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here there will come the Millennium in that time he said walking upon the ashes okay is that a surprise to anybody that that was to me that was to me when I read that quote and read these scriptures now but let's not stop there let's look go to verse 10 revelation 20:10 so we must rule over sin now if we expect to rule Nations later we must rule over sin we must say no sin no temptation you're not I'm not falling to you today praise God I'm not gonna be weak today I'm gonna be strong I'm gonna rule because I'm a king and one day I'll be a king or queen praise God and I'll rule over Nations but we got to rule over sin right now okay verse 10 so after fire licks up or Burns all these heathen verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast in lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever all that's something so can everybody get the picture now according to this we're the bride gets raptured right tribulation everybody uh is going crazy uh there just it's awful it's the worst time the Bible said in Daniel 12 there's never there'll never be another time like it never was another time like it it's going to be so awful okay the two prophets of course it's called the tribulation The Sixth Seal the tribulation seal Jesus comes back at the end with a sword that comes out of his mouth and uh brings forth judgment now in the Millennium you have Christ and the bride and the 144,000 in Jerusalem praise God because the Bible said the bride will never leave the side of Christ so if Christ is there in the sanctuary sitting on the The Throne of the son of David guess who's going to be there as well his wife hallelujah amen and the 144,000 will be the Unix that'll keep the bridal Chambers oh my for a thousand years and you'll have Heathen or nations grow up how many ages how I don't know but they'll multiply multiply multiply for a thousand years and that gives Christ and the bride a chance to rule the Earth for a thousand years and she gets to have power she has power over Nations judgment over Nations because she's spit to rule because she's proved She's Fit to rule during her lifetime upon this Earth amen and at the very end after the Thousand Years expired you the Battle of Gog and Magog Satan deceives one more time he deceives all these nations and they surround that Holy City fire comes down burns them up and then the Bible said Satan the devil and the Beast and false prophet I'm sorry the devil was cast Lake of Fire where the Beast and false prophet already are because they get tossed in there after the of armagan all right and then after that then the Bible said all the rest of the Dead hear the voice of the Lord right there so let's go to John chapter 5 we'll just go just read that by God's grace John chapter 5 praise the Lord okay now go to verse 24 I want to show you the two scriptures like I said I'll try to preach a whole message on this at some point maybe next Wednesday we'll see by God's grace go to verse 24 now verses 24 to 27 is the bride or the first resurrection versus 28 and 29 is the second Resurrection okay so let's read verse 4 verily verely I say to you he that heareth my word and believeth on me that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life see what what what is that life that's the Holy Ghost God's eternal life right so people really don't believe God until they're born again that's what they really believe because now they've got life and they pass from Death there's no longer death in the soul right there's no longer dormant State there's life and now they've got the life of God God verse 25 verily verily I say to you the hour is coming and now is when the dead hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live so see not everybody hears but all those that died in Christ will hear right like Paul said the dead in Christ shall rise first verse 26 for as the father had life in himself so he ha given to the son to have life in himself and have given him authority to execute judgment also because he's the son of man that's the first resurrection the one we're pointing to over here the rapture verses 24 down to 27 is the rapture the first resurrection now verse 28 and 29 is the second Resurrection he says Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave should hear his voice all right a l all so that has to be the white Throne judgment everyone in the grave and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation okay so see there's two resurrections right the first resurrection is the rapture the second Resurrection you're either given life or uh Eternal destruction or Eternal separation from God we say now go back to Revelation 20 if we can Revelation 20 coming a lot of future events tonight by God's grace hope that's okay it's a good it's a good review if you haven't gone over this for a while now verse 11 let's go let's read 11 to the end so you can see the white Throne judgment right here verse 11 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was no place I'm sorry found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works look at this remember Jesus said there's going to be a day when all hear my voice look at the next verse and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judge every man according to his works and death and hell were cast in Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written The Book of Life was cast in the Lake of Fire does that make sense by God's grace so the first resurrection is the rapture they live a thousand years with Christ the second Resurrection some people are given eternal life others are given Eternal Annihilation at some point they'll be annihilated right and they might burn for a million years a billion years but at some point they will cease to exist because you cannot live forever unless you have eternal life I just heard a famous preacher today on the radio he said he said whoever you vote for he said you're G to spend eternity with you vote for Jesus you get eternal life if you vote for Satan you get eternal life or eternal life with Satan I thought that don't even make any sense how can you have eternal life with Satan how can you live eternally with Satan if you don't have eternal life right you got to have eternal life to live forever so they have some sort of life but not eternal life and at some point they have to cease from existing they have to have no more existence okay so I hope that helps by God's grace hope every everybody can see that this was kind of new to me where I read that quote where brother bam said the Heathen will have uh will multiply multiply multiply during that time and the Heathen will have to be judged by the Christ and the bride and then they're all deceived they're all deceived and they go into uh the goag and Magog there and try to surround the holy city but Jesus uh or fire comes down and protects of course Jesus and the Saints and uh Israel oh my what a what a string of events now let's uh move on here now let's go to Ezekiel 43 Ezekiel we did Ezekiel 48 now it's go to Ezekiel 43 and the reason we're going here is because brother Braham used this scripture in the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel and this is the scripture he gave on how there'll be a sanctuary U and we also saw that in Ezekiel 48 as well there's a Jewish sanct I'm sorry there's a sanctuary uh during the Millennium okay so Ezekiel 43 1-7 afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that lookth toward the East and behold the glory of God of Israel came from the way of the and his voice was like a noise of many Waters and the Earth shine with his glory so look the glory of God is shining upon the Earth at this point now verse three and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city and the Visions were like the vision that I saw by the river chabar and I fell upon my face and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose Prospect is toward the East so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner cour court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house and I heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by me he said to me son of man the place of my throne and the place of The Souls of my feet where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever and my Holy Name shall the house of Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings nor their by their whoredom nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places so look at this God takes Ezekiel and he goes in the house of God and the glory of God fills the house of God he said no more will there be any defilement in this Temple and brother man says in the 7th week of Daniel he says now notice that's where we seen her coming back to the millennial Temple over here at the end of the Jewish age the anointed here he come riding on the White Horse there F him on white horses horses or Powers dressed in white the vesture dipped in blood he's talking about the battle of Armageddon wrote on him the word of God he cometh the mighty conquer yes yeser accept the Millennium coming to the temple Glory there he meets the 144,000 he said now the sixfold purpose we find out that the sixth purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel was to anoint the most holy how many remember that from the scripture it's in Daniel chapter nine so let's go there Daniel chapter N I preach on this about two years ago 2014 Daniel 70 weeks okay it's verse 24 Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression now that's the first part there's six purposes for Gabriel's visit to Daniel to finish the transgression to make an end of their sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness to seal the vision and prophecy and to an oint the most holy so the last purpose of these uh Times of Israel the 70 weeks the last purpose is to anoint the most holy brother BR said that can't be Jesus because he's already anointed amen he's already got a glorified body he's already perfect right he said this anointing brother said is to anoint the new Millennial Temple the Temple of Israel right for the Millennium brother Ram says amen now let you read it he said to anoint the most holy we find out that the most holy always represents the church the Tabernacle and the last thing to be done was to anoint the most holy that's the millennial Tabernacle that Christ will live in during the Millennium and will live in hallelujah amen thank you Jesus so the last purpose is to what the Bible said anoint that Holy Temple and when Christ comes in that Temple is going to be anointed amen whoever God is there's an anointing praise the lord it's exactly right now he says this again in the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel 1961 when the temple is erected the resurrection has come the Jews has returned Christ and his bride has come the Jew the 144,000 are sealed the Millennium has taken place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holiest of holies and the most holy the the most holy place is the sanctuary where God live between the cheram and this time it will be Christ sitting in the most holy place with the anointing upon Him amen glory amen so during the time of Moses they had the Ark of the Covenant right where there just was a spirit God's spirit dwelt there between the cherubs but during this time during this 100 this a thousand year Millennial Reign it won't be an ark sitting there it'll be Christ sitting there amen Christ will sit in the most holy place and his bride must be there too she's somewhere around there she's somewhere real close to Christ because He Reigns and then she has power over Nations isn't that beautiful Church you see that right in the scripture praise the Lord to anoint the most holy the most holy Place Christ sits in the holies of holies in the new Sanctuary the new Tabernacle in Jerusalem during the Thousand Year Millennial Reign Hallelujah let me read one more quote and this is paragraph 119 the sixfold purpose he said now watch the description of the temple that's to be built in the Millennium he says is from Ezekiel the 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter is nothing in the world but the millennial temple being erected on Earth he said anybody knows that and when the glory of the Lord fills it and so forth now we're just going to describe it in the 43rd chapter of Ezekiel that's what we just read praise God now if you got your bibl go to Isaiah 2 I'm coming down to close I got maybe about 20 more minutes maybe 15 more minutes go to Isaiah chapter 2 there's another interesting scripture here I think that you like Isaiah 2 by God's grace now let's start at verse two read 2 three and four you think brother Justice is a really strange text I know it is but brother Bram was asking a questions and answer about this text and they asked him is this the Millennium and brother Bram said yes this is the millennial okay so let's look at it Isaiah chapter 2 veres 2 34 and it should come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and should be exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow into it do that does that fit the Millennium yes because we rule all the nations and so the Nations have to flow into it look at verse three and many people shall go and say Come Ye and let us go into the mountain Lord to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us his ways now look there's a people that needs taught the ways of God right so it has to be Nations during the thousand year reign to learn about God right it's got to be Nations it can't be the bride because we'll have perfect bodies right we'll have glorified bodies it can't be the bride it's got to be nations of heathens that come to the house of God to learn about God and we will walk in his path see because there can be no sin for a thousand years so they'll be ruled for a thousand years for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from where Jerusalem praise God that's where that Sanctuary will be that Holy City the most holy Place verse four and he shall judge among the Nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plow shares now look at that they have swords and what are swords used for fighting but during this time they take their swords and they beat them and change the shape of them so they can plow the fields with them and that fits the that fits the Millennium as well because the Bible said they'll plant and they will also Harvest Right they'll build houses during the Millennium B say they'll build houses and plant and all these things so that fits the scripture as well and their Spears into pruning hooks so they'll be able to prune trees right prune plants instead of fight with their Spears Nations shall not lift up sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore well there's Wars all the time right now so it's not now it has to be in a future time it has to be during the Millennium they won't fight these nations won't fight anymore instead they'll have peace and harmony for a thousand years God will teach them his ways and they will not sin they will not war their their fighting instruments will be turned into planting tools right right and harvesting tools that's what the word of God says now let me read you the quote this is from uh what think I'm sorry no questions answer is 1954 so 54 they asked this to brother Brandon they say is not Isaiah's meaning of the beating of the swords into plowshares to come to pass during the 10,000 year reign of Christ rather than something that man can bring as so many modern religionist religionist tell us he said that's a good question right because some people think uh there's going to be peace before the Millennium there's not going to be any peace but R the only way peace will come to the Earth is when Jesus Christ comes back to the Earth that's the only way there'll be no peace even at the Rapture the bride taking the Rapture there's no peace during the tribulation uh the only time peace will happen is in the Millennium a thousand year rest so see this person has a good question is this going to happen before or is this going to happen during the Millennium now look what brother says he said you are exactly right that's when the plowshares will be beat when the swords will be beaten the plow shares that'll bring forth the millennial Reign and all those modernistic religious cults that's going on trying to educate people the kingdom of God that'll the Millennium will be when God himself will come in a supernatural being and in Supernatural power to a supernatural believing people that will receive a supernatural power that'll mold God's Sons Hallelujah it'll never be no more reading writing arithmetic it'll be by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ then the world will study war no more amen glory brother said for there's going to be an elect who's going to live through the millennial age and will go in and out with Christ for a thousand years and they shall go up into Glory with him and return again when the resurrection of the wicked is brought forth then the Millennium will the L is over then Christ will go up with the church and at the end of the thousand years he will return with the church all right Glory now let me read this this is from Israel the church 1953 Daniel saw Jesus as a rock HED out of the mountain rolled in and strike the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in the feet and break it to pieces and the kingdom of God grew when Christ takes over in the Millennium let me know sickness no sorrow every all the all the swords will be beat in the plow shares and will study war no more that's all it'll all be over when Jesus comes until then as long as Satan's dominating the Nations there'll be wars and rumors of wars until Jesus comes praise God amen amen now since you're in Isaiah go to Isaiah 11 go to Isaiah 11 since you're there then we'll go to Micah 4 Isaiah 11 now Church what I've done is this is now this is just me adding a scripture that says the same thing as Isaiah chapter 2 Okay so this to me looks like it might be the Millennium as well it might be because we see the same wording turning swords into plow shears and also talks about the wolf and the lamb lying down okay so Isaiah 11 verse3 Malachi can you read three and four for me please Isaiah 11:3 and shall make him a quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes either reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with iniquity through the meek of the earth and he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked thank you L are you ready to read honey are you in Isaiah 11 okay can you read five and six Dar Isaiah 11 5 and6 and shall be the of his voice faithfulness his ve the wolf also shall BL the lamb the leopard shall down the and the Cal and theat and a little child a little child leading a calf and a young lion together right okay now verse uh what you read five six seven and the cow and the bear shall feed their young on shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the ass and the wean child shall put his hand on the cockatrice is dead they shall not hurt nor destroy all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea all right doesn't that sound like the Millennium because he talks about the animals laying down together in peace it talks about children remember brother said who are those Nations they're heathens they're Heathen Nations that get to looks like it looks like they get to multiply and reproduce that's what it looks like could be wrong on that but like said brother looks like it might be looks like it might not be okay now uh one more scripture here go to Micah chapter 4 OB Jonah Micah Micah chapter 4 so we can clearly see how Isaiah 11 talks about the lion the lamb the wolf and the ox all all living in peace together that has to be the Millennium now Micah 41 okay here's where we get the same wording as Isaiah chapter 2 at brother Ram Isaiah Isaiah when it talks about the swords going to plow shares was the Millennium so Micah 4 vers1 when the last days come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains there shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow into it and many nations shall come and say come let's go up into the Mount of the Lord into the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths and for the law shall go forth of Zion and the word of Lord from Jerusalem that sounds a lot like Isaiah right we just read that verse three and he shall judge among men people and rebuke strong nations of far off and they shall beat their swords into what plow shares and their Spears into up pruning hooks Nation shall not lift up a sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore but they shall sit every man under his Vine and under his fig tree and None Shall make them afraid for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it for all the people walk everyone in the name of his God and we will walk in the name of the Lord Our God forever and ever in that day say the Lord will I assemble her that halted and I will gather her that is driven out and her that I Afflicted I will make her that halth a Remnant and her that was cast off I'm sorry far off a strong nation and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from henceforth even forever and thou oh Tower of the flock the stronghold of the daughter of Zion unto thee shall come even the first Dominion the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem amen glory ain't that beautiful praise the Lord so so the time will be a time of no war between the Nations they'll take their swords they'll take their pruning hooks I'm sorry the the their their Spears and they'll turn them into planting and harvesting crops for a thousand years of peace upon the Earth praise God all right now closing I'm G to try to close down by God's grace got a couple more thoughts I want to close with this is this helpful tonight by God's grace I never preached on the Millennium before this the first time I preached on it 10 years as Pastor I just never thought to really just I guess maybe wasn't LED that way I didn't think I was really LED that way I've always believed in that I've always believed I want to be a part of it and by God's grace I'll be a part of it uh if I'm blessed and holy by God's grace but finally able to preach it here now I W to um let's go to Revelation three back to Revelation three I want to close with the qualifications of being in the millennium qual ifications this is why brother Ram said Never Lose Your Enthusiasm we can't lose on the small things we got to let the word be our our love we got to make the word our absolute even when we don't feel like coming to church we don't feel like praying don't don't feel like reading your Bible we' just got to do it we got to bring this body into this subjection we don't want to get lazy because that's the spirit of leoa right right we can't let that conquer us we over if we overcome it Jesus said you sit with me on my throne in the son of David not my father's Throne we're not sitting on the father's Throne Jesus sits on the father's throne but we'll sit on his throne with him praise God which is the son of David's Throne that beautiful Sanctuary we just heard about amen we just read about it Hallelujah All Nations will come before the king and the queen my not to bow and let the learn from the ways of the Lord hallelujah amen by Revelation 314 and unto the angel of the church leans write these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or hot I would thou work cold or hot so because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing now let me stop right there brother brandom said we must always say we have more need of God praise God because the Ley in spirit will say I don't I have enough of God what I need more of is riches and goods we cannot let that happen we must always say Lord I have more need of you than I need you now more than ever before that song needs to be a living reality in our lives amen that's why I always get on the church about coming to church and reading your Bibles that's you have to if not you'll get Swept Away by Lea laziness okay you must make it your love you're absolute okay and knowest thou not that our wretched and miserable poor blind and naked anyone that would say I have enough of God or I don't need more of God or I don't need to gather together more as we see the day approaching is actually naked blind and wretched and don't even know it that's Jesus's red letter words right this is his Judgment of the leoan church age because thou sayest I'm rich and increased with Goods okay I already read that sorry verse 18 I CS to buy of me gold tried in the fire now gold is Christlike character that's what gold is it's Christlike character it's your character going through hard Trials of fire okay so we can't say Lord I don't want firey trials just be with me while I go through them okay because that's the only way you'll have Christlike character gold character is to go through the fiery trials that thou mayest be rich and white rment that th mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes shall that the man SE we must be able to see sin and we must be able to discern it from the the the truth the holy words of God as many as I love what does Jesus do to the ones he loves he what rebukes them and chastens them which means to show them the right way he first he rebukes them and then shows them the right way praise God as a preacher it's hard but many times I have to rebuke the church but don't don't feel bad it's me being rebuked first when I read it right because God's leading me to study it and pray about it and then I get rebuked first and I got to bring a rebuke to the church right that's the way God set it up and if I'm not living it I'm a hypocrite I need to be voted out we need to get somebody in here who's living the word of God Amen just because I just because we started the church and I've always been Pastor don't mean I have to be let's be faithful to the word let's stay with the word praise God Everybody Must everybody answers to Christ the word everyone no one's above it amen and be zealous therefore and repent so we've heard it the Zeal of the hour is to repent of our blindness our wretchedness or when it seeks into our life and to live Above It by God's grace remember Jesus said the true ministers at the end time will give them their meet and due season does anybody everybody remember that Parable okay so go to Hebrews chapter 5 people say I want me brother people people said this to me before no one here but they've said brother Jess You Preach too shallow give us some deeper things but let me show show you what the Bible says uh let me tell you what the Bible says about meat okay I like I just I kind of laugh because you know sometimes you you people hurt your feelings you just try to love them praise God you just try to love people but let me tell you what meat is meat is being able to see sin and call Sin Sin and able to overcome it that's meat that's meat preacher it might not feel like it but the Bible says it is revelation is wonderful or maybe seeing types and shadows is wonderful but real meat preaching something you really can chew on and digest and help you is showing where there's sin in your life and getting rid of it that's meat preaching and have you seen the Holy Spirit the last few weeks preach on the lust of the eyes have you seen that has it helped anybody I know it's gone home with some of us like we talked about it's getting into our children's thoughts and our mind that's a wonderful thing it's it's helping me know you think about oh make sure you're looking at the right thing always keep all sin away from your eyes right Hebrews 5 verse 12 like I said I've had people criticize me and say well you're not deep enough but the route of it is what they're looking for is they're looking for something to tickle their ears and those same people uh lay out of church those same people don't read their Bibles the same people criticize people all the time on social media or you know that they're just not pleasant to be around because they got the wrong Spirit Glory because they got some sin in their life look at verse uh 12 for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness he's a baby look see that preachers that Don't Preach a righteous life are using milk right that's what the Bible said they don't preach and that's what most churches are today I'm not saying message but I'm saying denominational or independent that have denominational Creeds they tell you not to sin but they don't tell you what sin is they don't tell you that but that's a that's an unskillful preacher somebody who just uh preaches about the cross but they never tell you how to get clean right they don't tell you what to repent of right but look at verse 14 but strong meat belong to them that are of full age even those who by reason of their use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen so how many want us how many want to eat strong meat in this hour those who eat strong meat already have their senses exercised and they can recognize Good and Evil but someone who's unskillful with the word they never show you what uh unrighteousness is they just talk about you know all the the blessings and all these things like that they never talk about Sin and they never called out that's why we're peculiar people because we preach on the sin of that men commit like smoke and adultery and evil thoughts and movies and all this kind of non sports and all all kinds of Idols that rise up in people's lives we preach on women especially how they should dress and not be sexy dressed and all kinds of you know makeup and all kinds of things like that high heels and all kinds of things see because all that is lustful things and they Don't Preach against it so they don't so it shows they're in they're unskillful in the word of righteousness They Don't Preach a righteous life when the Bible says they shouldn't do those things all right so what's the millennial qualifications the M the millennial qualifications is to have the Holy Ghost right and to discern good and evil in your life that's why we come to church that's why we should always be Desiring more Church like I said one of these days I want to preach on the uh how to do social media uh because even that will show if someone's got the holy ghost or not your whole life shows whether you're born again social media only glorifies God when you glorify God with it amen right that's the only way it glorifies God I want to pre I preach to little kids out of my school about that I want to preach on here at some point I just want to lay it out through the scripture basically we're not to uh lust we're not to be angry we're not to criticize we're not supposed to complain on social media we're not supposed to uh we're not supposed to do anything sinful on social media we're still supposed to be thankful happy Holy Ghost filled Christians amen if you got a problem with somebody you go talk to them face to face don't do it on social media face to face that's right got a problem with anybody now let's go to uh Matthew 5 I am closing here just bear with me Matthew 5 last scripture I got for you look Matthew 5:3 let's look at the Beatitudes before we close verse three blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven that that poor means desperate we got any desperate souls in here desperate for more of God those who are desperate in the spirit all the any more of God theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven praise the Lord verse four blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted think of the martyrs think of those who are struggling hard over sin persecuted Church verse five blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth who inherits the Earth during the Millennial Reign and during the new heavens and new earth the meek praise God what does meek mean humble what does humble mean you're below some you're you're below everybody else that's the kind of people that will rule during this right here is people that put themselves lower and put others in Christ Christ is number one and others above themselves praise God Jesus said the meek inherit the earth not the selfish the meek those who put themselves below other people verse six blessed are they which through hunger and thirst after righteous for they shall be filled that's why we got to keep hungering and thirsting for the promises of God and how to live a Godly life amen verse seven blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God see so those who don't keep a pure heart they won't see God during the Millennium they won't sit with Christ because they they're not pure we got to live every moment and be pure like like Jesus's is right there with us right now the pure in heart see God verse n blessed are the PE peacemakers for they should be called the children of God like got talk about social media are you making peace on social media or making Wars on social media a lot of people make Wars we're supposed to make peace verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and Sh shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be ex exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets which were before you amen let's stand on our feet here by God's grace the qualifications for the Millennium we must we must be all those things Jesus said we must be meek we must hunger and thirst for righteousness how to live a righteous holy life life we must do that we must overcome all that said in Revelation 3 we must overcome lukewarmness we must overcome the feeling where I've I've got enough of God we must overcome that we must have more needs of God brother Raam said the great burdens for our ages the pressure of riches anybody ever feel that pressure feel it all the time the pressure to be rich right pressure to have more money somebody just contacted me today and sent me said sent me this link and watch a video and said do you want to have more money and more time with your family and so you should do this that that that's the pressures right the pressures to have be more Rich have more money get your bills paid off and it's okay to do those things as long as Christ is number one as long as you seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these other things will be added unto you you see they want to that's that's why we said we got to show God he's number one God's above uh every God's above work God's above family God's above friends God's above everything God is number one praise God he said it's the pressure of riches in leosia the pressure of soft living and the pressure of nervous tensions so nervousness soft living and riches that's those are the three pressures brother said we fight Leia everybody wants to have a soft Easy Life nobody wants to have uh nobody wants to have have anyi Financial debts and everything like that and people often are battling nervousness all the time nervous about the the end of the world nervous about politics nervous about Wars all this nervousness we've got to overcome we'll do it by the grace of the Lord Amen brother R says this my last quote the Third Exodus he says I want you to notice the same Pillar of Fire is leading the people again to a promised land their Millennium where we found the insiration of the six seal that's never been taught before how the Earth has to be purified for the Millennium the pillar of fire there is leading them to the Millennium Hallelujah what's the pillar of fire the holy spirit is that what's leading you tonight church is the holy spirit leading us we believe it is the holy spirit can only lead us to the word of God holy spirit will not lead us out of the word it will only lead us to the word of God let's our heads as we pray now praise God Church let me pray for you if anyone's battling the pressure of riches the pressure to have a soft easy life or the pressure of nervousness if anybody's battle that let me pray for you tonight I think we battle this on a constant basis don't we how many battle lukewarmness I battle that how many battle being Meek and kind and pure in heart anybody battle that sure we battle being prideful we got to overcome that we need more of God how many would say I need more of God tonight let's pray Heavenly Father tonight we're grateful for your word we looked at Lord the Millennium and Lord this is so wonderful to know it's so wonderful to know all these things but Lord we close by showing the qualifications we see what we need what kind of life we need in order to be a part of that Millennium it's not going to be the lukewarm that enjoyed the millennium it's going to be those who are hot for Jesus and the way we be hot is by taking rebukes and chastisements and recognizing it as your love oh God help us to understand Lord that milk preaching doesn't produce a holy life but Lord meat preaching produces A Life That's able to judge is this right or wrong is this sin or is this righteousness Lord help us to live above sin help us to live above lukewarmness dear God I I I ask that in Jesus Wonderful Name dear God help us to be the meek that inherit the earth help us to be the poor or desperate in spirit those that are need more of God help us to have a hunger and thirst for righteousness help us to do all we can Lord God on this Earth to fill our lives with the word of God and Lord overcome for if we overcome your Prophet said we inherit all the rewards from all seven Church ages and one of those is that power over Nations one of those is to sit on the throne of the son of David with the son of David what a privilege Lord God help us to rule over sin now right now dear God help us to have a hot experience with Christ help us to follow the pillar of fire this hour Lord I see it leading us away from sin I I see it leading us away from lukewarmness or compromise with worldliness or or living a soft life and not pressing into the promises of God I see it leading us deeper into the word of God grant it Lord Jesus Grant it dear God that we'll live that kind of life oh God we pray that we trust that Lord we know your your holy spirit will guide us into that to a life that can discern good and evil help us to see Good and Evil in our homes to kick out all the trash so Lord our children can be born again or we can be born again that's when the token can come in Lord when all the all the
