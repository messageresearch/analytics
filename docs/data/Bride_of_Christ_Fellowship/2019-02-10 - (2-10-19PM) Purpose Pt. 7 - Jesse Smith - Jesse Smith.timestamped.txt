[17:16] let's go to first Corinthians chapter 4
[17:18] verse 1 I like to look at the purpose
[17:21] series part 7 tonight I'm gonna try to
[17:23] keep a little shorter I was kind of sick
[17:27] yesterday
[17:28] because I just wore myself out all week
[17:29] you know so I just I told a man I said
[17:34] just shorten a song service a little bit
[17:35] and I'll try to short my preaching a
[17:37] little bit like this morning so I was
[17:39] almost I was sick and then just kept
[17:41] asking God to help me and then finally
[17:43] yesterday I came out of it and just
[17:45] thankful feel a lot better today by
[17:47] God's grace God is good Church God is
[17:50] good amen
[17:51] so I like to go to first Corinthians 4 1
[17:53] and 2 and like to look at part 7 on this
[17:55] purpose series we're looking at the next
[17:59] metaphor that God gives for our lives
[18:04] remember we said on Wednesday from what
[18:06] I found I found for metaphor so far
[18:08] God's view of what our life is like like
[18:11] a race it's like a test and today when
[18:15] we look at tonight it's like a trust God
[18:17] has given us a trust as a steward
[18:19] something we've got to be accountable
[18:22] for and be responsible for I know a lot
[18:26] about racing and I know a lot about
[18:28] taking tests I'm a schoolteacher now
[18:32] Trust is a little bit of foreign to me
[18:34] you know I was born with nothing very
[18:38] little financial but of course learning
[18:40] to deal with that as time goes on so
[18:42] I'll try to use an illustration from
[18:45] school Lord winning but 1st Corinthians
[18:47] 4 1 and 2 but to read from there let's
[18:53] read a 3:1 together and then I'll read
[18:56] verse 2 1 2 3 then
[18:59] man so account of us as of the ministers
[19:02] of Christ and stewards of the mysteries
[19:05] of God are adverse to just myself
[19:08] moreover it is required in stewards that
[19:11] a man be found faithful amen let's just
[19:15] bow our heads here again father Lord we
[19:17] just come reverently lord thank you for
[19:18] this word we just want to be faithful
[19:20] Lord God we know ultimately Lord all
[19:23] faithfulness is in you lord you're the
[19:25] faithful one Lord the Bible says Jesus
[19:27] Christ is the faithful witness Lord God
[19:30] thank you lord
[19:31] you lead in faithfulness help us Lord
[19:34] this service Lord to catch the mind of
[19:36] Christ
[19:37] Lord as we said this one let's receive
[19:39] it and become it father for your glory
[19:41] becoming more and more into thy image
[19:44] taking Lord full preeminence Lord may
[19:47] you take for that full preeminence in
[19:49] our lives in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[19:51] god bless you being seated there I'll
[19:53] try to take 45 minutes again like I did
[19:55] this morning and one little did you
[19:57] notice I went a little bit over or in
[19:58] about 55 minutes so I just I don't know
[20:00] why I just got to take five or ten more
[20:02] minutes but God is good and this
[20:07] thoughts been a real blessing to me I do
[20:09] have some quotes to show and some slides
[20:12] so I like to show those and I'll be
[20:14] taking like I said some thoughts out of
[20:15] the Purpose Driven Life it's been a
[20:16] really good book I'd encourage anyone to
[20:18] read this book just got to watch out for
[20:20] the Trinity suggestions there's only two
[20:22] of them it's a great book but I'm gonna
[20:26] preach a lot of it so you know I mean
[20:27] you don't want to read it you don't have
[20:28] to I tell you there's another book
[20:31] coming out you want to read that one no
[20:33] [Music]
[20:34] no but it will give you it like I said
[20:38] they'll give you a lot of good in-depth
[20:39] and I cite everything there's there's 32
[20:41] citations in there so if you ever want
[20:43] to find anything I sit on you know eisah
[20:45] right here it's online and this gives
[20:48] you a good place to stand there son
[20:50] excited excited so let's look at part
[20:57] seven you know I stopped I stopped
[20:58] giving them you know different titles
[21:00] cuz they just there's so many different
[21:02] things I wanted to cover on each one but
[21:04] I do want to look at the stewardship
[21:06] today by the grace of Lord and I'm gonna
[21:08] need my calculator because I found out
[21:09] how much of modern-day talent is
[21:13] so let me pull down my calculator so I
[21:14] got it okay I just found it online there
[21:17] showed all this research with citations
[21:19] I'm like man that's a good so I think
[21:21] it'll open our eyes hopefully little
[21:23] more by God's grace so we did our text
[21:26] and we're looking at stewardship and so
[21:30] we looked at from Wednesday remember
[21:32] there's for metaphors God gives us of
[21:34] our purpose in life and we saw how it's
[21:38] a race where we'd like to run a race
[21:41] like I said know a little bit about that
[21:43] I was a four-time state champion in
[21:45] racing I was a two-time runner-up and
[21:48] rate three-time runner-up in racing so I
[21:50] know a little bit about racing God just
[21:53] gave me that ability you know brother
[21:56] man makes a statement he said if you're
[21:57] a runner he said you cannot break the
[21:59] rules he said you've got to abide by all
[22:01] the rules or you're gonna mess up but
[22:03] man said that's a proverb in life if
[22:05] you're gonna play the game you got to
[22:06] follow the rules and there's never one
[22:09] time I had a false start so God gave me
[22:12] a natural ability to race I always
[22:15] waited for the gun I was always a very
[22:16] patient runner and God was always with
[22:19] me in that but it was training it was
[22:21] everyday training I took one day off I
[22:23] took Sunday off you know we'd always
[22:24] take sunday off but you had to train
[22:26] every other day now most athletes do
[22:29] seven days a week now you know just to
[22:31] stay fresh or I'm trying to keep their
[22:33] flexibility but we saw that and Paul
[22:37] says you got to run a race with patience
[22:39] you gotta lay aside any weight that
[22:42] easily beset you so that shows we're not
[22:44] doing a sprint and we might do a sprint
[22:46] when the latter rain falls but right now
[22:49] it's a marathon it's a marathon because
[22:52] it's a patient race mag knows about
[22:54] marathons I don't know anything about a
[22:56] marathon
[22:56] I should ask man to prepare a few words
[22:58] for us because I know how much he likes
[23:00] to speak and I just did but just to kind
[23:04] of give us an idea of his training you
[23:06] know I know we talked about it briefly
[23:08] I'm not sure how dedicated and I'm not
[23:10] sure maybe over dedicated he was you
[23:12] know some people can over train I'm not
[23:15] sure which side he was on or maybe it
[23:17] was right down in the middle but a
[23:19] marathon is no joke and that's what
[23:22] we're running today by the grace of God
[23:24] and we just got the lay aside anything
[23:26] that's hindering
[23:27] because it's easy to be hindered by the
[23:29] Bible said that the sin that death
[23:31] easily beset us so we got a look at what
[23:34] it what easily trips us up in our walk
[23:36] with God is our impatience is it our
[23:39] anger is it our depression or you know
[23:42] what are we battling not ours but the
[23:44] devil's depression what did we battle
[23:46] that's what's the easy thing that we
[23:48] easily fall into that's what we got to
[23:50] lay aside we've got to get victory over
[23:52] that and then we saw how is a test and I
[23:55] got a few more things I want to finish
[23:56] up on a test I just thought this was a
[23:58] good thought while I was reading it I
[24:00] think the Holy Spirit quickened this to
[24:03] me I want to share a few more thoughts
[24:06] on the test as I was meditating on this
[24:09] you know church we have daily tests we
[24:12] have to pass and will you pass these
[24:14] each day there's a test for your flesh
[24:17] the Bible said crucify the lusts of the
[24:20] flesh and the affections they're up and
[24:22] church that's an everyday thing
[24:24] sometimes it's a multiple times a day
[24:26] thing right I mean you've got to crucify
[24:31] like us in the morning
[24:33] you want to have some sugar in the
[24:34] morning you've got to crucify that right
[24:37] if you're gonna stay healthy or if
[24:40] there's like a sensual temptation like
[24:43] with lusts or something that may happen
[24:44] in the morning brothers that could
[24:46] happen in the evening to I'm sure our
[24:48] sisters battle these things too but you
[24:51] could come multiple times like so there
[24:53] are daily tests you know constant tests
[24:56] with the flesh and then the spirit
[24:59] you've got to die daily and that it's
[25:03] not it's not an option like like it's
[25:05] not like well I can I don't have to test
[25:07] that today I'll have a day off of test
[25:09] there's no test today now you have that
[25:12] at school I the other some days I don't
[25:14] give tests believe it or not but Paul
[25:18] said there's there's no skips for that
[25:20] you have a test every day are you gonna
[25:23] die to your will or gonna live to your
[25:26] will it's a daily test no days off for
[25:30] this test right and I found Church the
[25:34] last couple weeks I've just found this
[25:36] when I've got up the very first thing I
[25:38] do after you know brush your teeth or
[25:39] you know
[25:40] go to the restroom or whatever you got
[25:41] to do I've just gone right to my knees
[25:43] trying to pray first and it's just been
[25:46] such a help to me the last few weeks
[25:49] I've been doing that and it's really
[25:51] really helped me to die daily whether I
[25:53] feeling it or not you know sometimes I'd
[25:55] wait till I felt like it but I've just
[25:57] found that's just the first thing you
[25:59] got to do just pray and die daily
[26:01] also you've got to eat the daily bread
[26:04] the word so you have to find some time
[26:07] to listen to brother Branham or you can
[26:11] listen to your pastor again or if you
[26:14] don't have this live stream you know
[26:15] stream another passion but it's got to
[26:16] be careful with other pastors because
[26:18] most of time God gives that pass through
[26:20] the food for their congregation but if
[26:23] it's something else you know I mean
[26:25] there's special one you won't listen to
[26:26] that's that's it's okay but you got to
[26:28] be careful because Satan can use that
[26:31] where you get discontent with what God's
[26:32] given your home church right you don't
[26:36] be stealing food from another flock so
[26:38] you gotta be careful with that but but
[26:40] what I'm saying like let's say you're
[26:41] letting the Holy Spirit to go listen to
[26:43] something and then you're tested on that
[26:45] later you know it could be so you got
[26:48] you just want to be you just want to
[26:49] make sure you eat daily that's a test
[26:51] and then the Bible said be renewed daily
[26:54] in the spirit of your mind so that
[26:57] renewing that renewing is like like the
[27:00] Transfiguration timeout Transfiguration
[27:02] Jesus was transfigured he went from a
[27:04] normal man to a man that looked like the
[27:06] sunlight and that's what the mind has to
[27:09] do your mind or your mind in the morning
[27:11] usually wakes up but you just got a dark
[27:13] mind maybe a negative outlook on life
[27:17] and you've got to stay in the word long
[27:19] enough so the light turns on amen
[27:22] you got to stay it you got to stay
[27:23] around long enough so yeah you know in
[27:29] your mind you got to keep saying with
[27:30] the word until you can pull up the shade
[27:32] and the light can shine through and now
[27:35] you got a good outlook on the day oh
[27:36] it's Monday but still gonna be a good
[27:38] day on Saturday you know it's Friday
[27:43] you know everybody excited about Friday
[27:44] or Saturday thank God for the weekend
[27:46] but on Tuesday Wednesday now my heart
[27:49] stays Thursday you know you gotta open
[27:53] that up and let
[27:54] our mind we transform and let the light
[27:56] of Christ shine in so see there's daily
[28:00] tests that we're not gonna be able to
[28:02] get away from we've got to pass them
[28:04] every day
[28:05] praise the Lord so you better study up
[28:08] you got tests every day you better study
[28:11] up better be ready teachers gonna give
[28:14] the test right
[28:14] she better be ready you better stay in
[28:16] the Word of God like you're doing today
[28:17] by God's grace I'm gonna sorry wrong
[28:19] book it's the one you guys to hear right
[28:21] here the Word of God so I just want to
[28:23] pass that along it struck me as I was
[28:25] reading like oh my that's right
[28:26] like this like a test and there's daily
[28:29] tests and we got to make sure we
[28:30] overcome them by the grace of the Lord
[28:33] now let's review I went back and I was
[28:36] going through the notes and I think I've
[28:37] got 300 slides now on this series so I
[28:40] was just looking at a few of them
[28:41] I like this thought from chapter 1
[28:43] you're not going to discover your life's
[28:45] meaning by looking within yourself
[28:47] most the time because the Bible said
[28:49] your heart is deceitful now verse this
[28:52] is for like us someone who's either in
[28:54] the flesh they're saved filled with all
[28:56] the ghosts in their flesh they can still
[28:58] be deceived sometimes and not not away
[29:00] from Christ but they can still make
[29:02] mistakes but someone who's not even
[29:04] saved this is an awful thing to do
[29:06] because when their hearts deceitful
[29:09] above all things they base their
[29:12] decisions on their emotions or feelings
[29:16] so they're looking they're looking in
[29:18] themselves so what am I supposed to be
[29:20] and that's what you see people doing
[29:21] today what am I and people sad but
[29:24] people are saying am i a man or a woman
[29:25] they're looking inside their heart right
[29:28] which which bathroom am I supposed to go
[29:30] into not is that awful people but
[29:33] they're looking inside themselves and I
[29:35] just what shop should I play with boys
[29:37] toys or girls toys you know this is just
[29:40] this is just awful but this is what the
[29:43] Bible said
[29:44] the Bible says a fool has no delight
[29:46] understanding but that his heart may
[29:47] discover itself see they they want to
[29:50] discover something on the inside but if
[29:52] their hearts desperately wicked or
[29:54] deceitfully wicked they're gonna
[29:55] discover the wrong thing see a fool
[29:59] delights in the wicked desires of his
[30:00] heart
[30:06] they just they're looking in the wrong
[30:07] place they're looking in there deceitful
[30:10] wicked heart rather than looking in the
[30:13] holy true righteous Word of God we got
[30:16] to find our will we got to find our
[30:18] desire in the Word of God that's right I
[30:21] just thought I'd go back to these
[30:22] because we're all you know we're all on
[30:25] a journey right we're on the race we're
[30:27] on a marathon and we want to run the
[30:29] right race we want to run the right
[30:31] paths would it be awful bang when you're
[30:33] running if you took the wrong turn on
[30:34] the course and it added another 20
[30:37] minutes to your marathon how long was
[30:40] your marathon was it like a two hours or
[30:41] oh my goodness bless your heart say you
[30:47] imagine like added another hour to two
[30:49] that you see you don't want to run the
[30:52] wrong race you want to run God's purpose
[30:55] for your life
[30:56] so he the he that trusts in his own
[30:58] heart is a fool so I'm not trusting in
[31:01] my own heart you know tonight you're not
[31:03] you and I aren't trusting in our own
[31:04] heart we're trusting on what the Word of
[31:06] God says this is a faithful witness to
[31:11] trust in is God's Word see a fool trust
[31:14] his feelings well just search your heart
[31:16] and see what you're supposed to do
[31:18] that's such bad awful advice you got to
[31:22] search God's heart name ahead until he
[31:25] reveals his heart to you that's why Dave
[31:27] was a man after not as David was not
[31:29] after a man after I'm after we know it's
[31:33] in David's heart lustin you know all
[31:36] those things that was in his heart but
[31:38] he was after the heart of God and that's
[31:41] what we've got to be after men and women
[31:43] after the heart of Jesus Christ so see I
[31:48] just wanted to go over those you know
[31:49] remember we're chosen in him before the
[31:51] foundation of world we hear that a lot
[31:52] but it's true that we should be holy so
[31:54] our main purpose is holiness which means
[31:58] we're separate we are separated away
[32:00] from the things of the world
[32:02] that's a holy life and so that's what we
[32:06] are we're predestinated to adoption
[32:08] according to the pleasure of God's will
[32:11] or intention now I want to go back over
[32:15] this again that this is still review
[32:17] just for one more minute
[32:18] having made
[32:19] in us the mystery of his will so Paul
[32:22] tells the Ephesians their mature church
[32:24] that they knew the mystery of God's will
[32:27] and brother man tells us he reads this
[32:29] and he says the mysteries will remember
[32:30] how we hung on that how many was here
[32:32] this morning let's see how many are we
[32:34] struck on that or stuck on that the
[32:36] mysteries will now it is not just a
[32:39] little thing so see I don't feel bad
[32:41] bringing this back up I don't feel bad
[32:43] at all reviewing this I hope you don't
[32:45] either this is not a little thing to
[32:49] preach on this is a major thing to
[32:51] preach on the mystery of God's will for
[32:55] your life he says see that it's a
[32:58] mystery
[32:59] God's wills and mystery each man has to
[33:00] seek out the will of God for his or her
[33:03] self God's mystery oh thank you Jesus
[33:09] remember Nathan told David his the will
[33:12] of God for his life he said God took you
[33:14] from the sheep coat to make you ruler of
[33:16] my people Israel remember Samson's
[33:19] purpose
[33:20] you're gonna begin to defeat the
[33:22] Philistines that was God's purpose for
[33:24] Samson's life to begin to defeat them
[33:26] Jesus purpose was to save God's people
[33:29] from their sins then he might destroy
[33:31] the works of the devil amen
[33:34] oh thank you lord see we got to stay
[33:37] with God in holiness and then we find
[33:40] the will of God for our lives now let's
[33:44] get to this I told you I was gonna
[33:45] review that was just a quick five minute
[33:46] review now let's look at trust this
[33:50] trust here thought and then I want to
[33:52] get to this tail amount let me pull that
[33:54] calculator down again yeah I was shocked
[34:00] how much a talent was with the inflation
[34:01] and everything so in this in this
[34:06] thought here let me uh I want to read
[34:10] this paragraph I wrote on the upcoming
[34:12] book not this book but the upcoming book
[34:14] which I'm already having our sister from
[34:17] Alabama so editing some of the chapters
[34:20] already it's gonna be 13 chapters but
[34:22] she's editing two of them now I want to
[34:25] read that I wanna read this quote from
[34:27] of the brand but a talent according to
[34:29] this site with inflation is a hundred
[34:32] sixty
[34:33] thousand eight hundred dollars now that
[34:38] that sounds right because listen this is
[34:40] Jesus asking you at the end of your life
[34:42] what did you do with the one towel now
[34:45] that's one Talent
[34:47] so see like in your lifetime yeah you
[34:49] got a poor money into your mortgage of
[34:51] your rent you don't see that money I
[34:54] mean you got a but there's a certain
[34:56] amount you get to spend on what you want
[34:57] to spend it on and so I could see over
[35:00] the course of let's say 70 years you
[35:02] divide that by seventy what is that 106
[35:05] I mean I can do right now that's you
[35:07] know the Bible said that's two thousand
[35:09] two hundred or almost two thousand three
[35:12] hundred dollars a year you get to spend
[35:13] on yourself right now all your other
[35:16] money goes to bills and groceries and
[35:18] everything insurance so I think that
[35:22] that's right that's about right and
[35:23] that's one talent remember there's one
[35:26] talent I think two talents and then five
[35:29] talents so let's let's look at those
[35:32] real quick so two talents will be three
[35:34] hundred twenty-one thousand dollars and
[35:38] I'm sorry it's 32 320 $1600 it's almost
[35:44] three hundred twenty two thousand and
[35:48] let's do 168 zero times five that's
[35:53] eight hundred four thousand dollars so
[35:56] Jesus gives I mean that's a pretty good
[35:58] a lot of money almost a million dollars
[36:02] that you would spend on yourself and
[36:06] Jesus says you're gonna have to answer
[36:08] for that so let me move to this and I I
[36:16] don't really want to strain your eyes I
[36:18] don't really want to do that but this is
[36:22] the book this is the first chapter sorry
[36:25] I went the wrong way
[36:26] let's have a section on stewards of the
[36:29] mysteries it's really small I don't
[36:31] really mean to do that
[36:32] church I was just going to read it God's
[36:36] mysteries are so valuable that Paul said
[36:38] all ministers of the gospel were
[36:39] stewards of the mysteries of God the
[36:42] Deaf the Greek definition of Stuart is a
[36:44] manager or superintendent since I'm
[36:46] employed as
[36:47] but public school teacher my mind cannot
[36:49] help but compare the job of a minister
[36:52] with a school district superintendent so
[36:55] in our district that guy makes $160,000
[36:58] a year yeah you can make a lot of money
[37:02] in education in both occupations the
[37:07] worker is a manager of someone else's
[37:10] resources as accountable for their
[37:13] actions
[37:15] the minister handles God's word and
[37:18] people while the superintendent handles
[37:20] the community's facility so here's what
[37:21] my superintendent he has to handle the
[37:23] facilities and the financial and human
[37:26] resources my school districts buzz it
[37:30] budget is 50 million dollars a year so
[37:34] my superintendent he's got to take 50
[37:36] million dollars and decide how much goes
[37:37] to transportation how much goes to food
[37:40] how much goes to pupil services how much
[37:43] goes to regular classroom teachers
[37:45] special education he has all this
[37:47] money's got to be a manager of it and
[37:49] doubt and Tahlia tout - everybody give
[37:51] everybody the right amount of money that
[37:53] they need can you imagine me responsible
[37:57] for that sum of money 50 million how
[38:00] would you do it this year well I spent
[38:01] 50 million dollars this year but in
[38:05] reality the gospel ministers responsible
[38:07] much more than that because
[38:11] superintendent is earthly riches
[38:14] eventually perish but eternal life with
[38:16] Jesus Christ is never-ending the fruits
[38:20] of a faithful ministry will be believers
[38:22] who will live eternally with Jesus
[38:25] walking on streets paved with pure
[38:27] transparent gold see our super didn't he
[38:31] you know he repays our pot parking lot
[38:35] with asphalt that's his job but what
[38:38] we're doing is we're trying to get
[38:40] people to walk not on the earthly
[38:42] asphalt but on the heavenly asphalt
[38:44] transparent gold that's what I'm trying
[38:48] to get you to do right now give you the
[38:50] natural asphalt but take you up to the
[38:51] heavenly heavenly asphalt we're trying
[38:55] to get you to walk on that by the grace
[38:57] of God so see I
[39:00] I must be found faithful the Bible said
[39:02] I must be found faithful I faithfully
[39:04] teach uphold and rightly divide the
[39:06] truth for Jesus says the truth will set
[39:08] here's free from sin I hope I'm not
[39:13] gonna do this tonight but I wish I could
[39:14] take this this microphone and and pass
[39:16] it around and everybody could say what
[39:18] the ministry God's given us how many
[39:21] things that set you free from would that
[39:22] be great to hear that maybe set you free
[39:25] from doubt or skepticism or anger or
[39:28] bitterness or laziness or whatever it is
[39:30] would that be great to hear what the
[39:32] Word of God is done amen that's what
[39:35] it's supposed to do because the truth
[39:37] will always set you free
[39:40] the minister spiritual labor makes them
[39:42] worthy of not honor but double honor the
[39:45] Bible says if the minister give me a
[39:47] faithful steward of the mysteries of God
[39:50] all right because false doctrine right
[39:53] eats like a canker or gangrene that
[39:55] flesh-eating disease so false doctrine
[39:59] is gangrene but true doctrine is life
[40:01] and deliverance and victory we're
[40:04] familiar with that yeah Jesus gives the
[40:08] illustration a household manager
[40:11] represents a minister in Luke 12 Jesus
[40:14] says a faithful and wise steward is
[40:16] blessed by God because he feeds his
[40:17] household their portion of meat in their
[40:19] due season God's truths our spiritual
[40:22] meals full of life-giving vitamins David
[40:26] says about God's Word o taste and see
[40:28] that the Lord is good and sweeter also
[40:30] than the honey and the honeycomb jesus
[40:32] said his meat was to do the will of God
[40:34] or the Word of God the Church of Jesus
[40:37] Christ must be healthy growing in grace
[40:38] and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[40:41] Jesus Christ yeah did you know the Bible
[40:45] said that being God's steward is a huge
[40:48] responsibility includes tests sometimes
[40:50] stewards become discouraged or suffer
[40:52] persecution because Saint noise attacks
[40:54] true stewards through false ones as the
[40:57] children of flesh will always persecute
[40:59] the children of the Spirit in Paul's
[41:02] stewardship he experienced much
[41:03] persecution and often requested prayer
[41:06] that he would preach God's mysteries
[41:07] with boldness so think of that even Paul
[41:10] said will you pray for me that I can be
[41:13] more bold
[41:13] the gospel will you pray that I could
[41:16] have more bonus if he was experiencing
[41:18] battles what about us if he needed
[41:21] prayer to be bold with God's mysteries
[41:23] how much more do we need them let's be
[41:25] honest hurts we all need to be more be
[41:27] more bold with the Word of God
[41:28] praise the Lord and just share about the
[41:31] message Paul needed that prayer we need
[41:34] that prayer as well
[41:36] Paul said praying for me that utterance
[41:39] may be given unto me and then that I may
[41:41] open my mouth boldly to make known the
[41:43] mystery the gospel for which I am an
[41:45] ambassador in bonds that there and I may
[41:48] speak boldly as I ought to speak
[41:49] stewards they like Paul of all need our
[41:52] prayers that they may declare the
[41:54] mystery of God boldly so if you ever
[41:56] need anybody pray for you can pray for
[41:58] me and I definitely pray for you as well
[42:00] by the grace of the Lord does that
[42:02] helpful by God's grace I hope that's
[42:05] helpful to see how we're superintendents
[42:08] preachers our superintendents but of
[42:11] course we're all stewards we all have
[42:13] something that we have to take care of
[42:14] and let me read this quote from brother
[42:16] Branham now this is brother Branham
[42:19] beginning of God doesn't call man to
[42:22] judgment first before warning him he
[42:25] said we find out his nature was here to
[42:27] always warn a man before judgment God
[42:29] always warned to one a nation before
[42:31] judgment he always gives his warning a
[42:33] reminder too we have a responsibility we
[42:36] are responsible and God has put us here
[42:38] on the earth for a reason and that
[42:40] reason he's put us here for were
[42:41] responsible to him for that reason you
[42:44] should go to him and find out what he
[42:46] wants you to do and the church said we
[42:49] should go to God say God what do you
[42:50] want me to do he said if you don't if
[42:54] you went to work for a man he just give
[42:55] you a job on a ranch or something other
[42:57] you just went out of the barn and just
[42:59] set down out there and say well see you
[43:04] must go ask him what he wants you to do
[43:05] and then do it if you're working for a
[43:08] man find out what your duties is praise
[43:11] God and if anybody is gonna tell you
[43:14] what your duty is it's gonna be God I
[43:17] mean God's not gonna hide it from you
[43:19] well God what do you want me to do my
[43:20] life you think God's gonna hide that
[43:22] from you God will show you God will
[43:25] preach it to you time and time and time
[43:27] again
[43:27] - you get it right God wants you to get
[43:31] your purpose he wants to reveal the
[43:33] mysteries right because he told his
[43:35] disciples blessed are you the mysteries
[43:36] are given to you to know the kingdom of
[43:38] God he wants you to know and then if our
[43:42] life on Earth here and then we should go
[43:45] to the one who put us here and Lord what
[43:48] would you have me to do what must I do
[43:51] why am I here I like that because this
[43:54] guy this guy's question is what on earth
[43:57] am I here for I like that because that's
[43:59] what brother Branham said he course keep
[44:01] riding in from other brandman the BAM
[44:03] said the same thing why am I here what
[44:06] is my purpose in life but answer you
[44:08] should go to God and ask that what do
[44:10] you want me to do at church I'm just
[44:14] feel like I'm starting to find mine by
[44:15] writing a book like this you know
[44:16] honestly I just feel like maybe I'm
[44:18] starting to find more of my purpose in
[44:19] life I'm gonna see what God does in the
[44:21] next year this thirteenth year I want to
[44:24] see what God does and see if that if
[44:26] that's a way to strengthen the Bride of
[44:28] Christ or is that a way to to raise
[44:30] faith and save souls I don't know it
[44:33] feels like it feels like I'm letting the
[44:35] Holy Spirit to do something like that if
[44:37] it's to be a housewife or dishwasher
[44:40] look at these examples a housewife and a
[44:43] dishwasher but I like what brother BAM
[44:46] says whatever God wants you to do that
[44:48] you'd be the very best that you know how
[44:50] to do it no matter how little no matter
[44:52] how little is you must do it a
[44:55] dishwasher I want to be the best
[44:59] dishwasher I can be that's what a
[45:01] Christian would say right what am I here
[45:05] for I'm gonna be a a witness in the
[45:07] kitchen right at the restaurant when I
[45:11] was 16 and 17 I worked at a Chinese
[45:13] restaurant I was a dishwasher and I
[45:15] tried to be the best one I could be so I
[45:18] can make another extra money I won't get
[45:19] China dragon and I would sometimes I got
[45:23] to miss church you know because I like
[45:24] that back then I would one like that now
[45:25] I'd hate that now but I go there and
[45:28] wash dishes and that was I tried to the
[45:29] very best job I could and I got the I
[45:33] got to be around people and no doubt God
[45:35] wants a godly dishwasher right there
[45:38] once the kitchen to shine the light of
[45:39] God's love right there
[45:40] no doubt about it housewife dishwasher
[45:44] lados later he'll say farmer the trouble
[45:46] there's each one of us wants to do the
[45:48] next man's job we all want to pack the
[45:50] ball as you say you see now with me
[45:54] Church I don't know anybody else writing
[45:55] books amongst my friends cam doesn't
[45:57] write him brother Brooks doesn't write
[45:58] them Samuel doesn't write them by the
[45:59] gym doesn't write them so I feel like
[46:01] I'm not trying to take somebody's
[46:02] position I feel like I'm letting the
[46:04] Holy Spirit to do something like this
[46:06] like this watch here every little
[46:09] movement is there in its place now every
[46:11] part of it can't be the hands now I only
[46:14] look at the hands of see what time it is
[46:15] but if one of them little wheels in
[46:17] there gets out of order then that won't
[46:18] keep the right time and that's the way
[46:21] it is with people we bought the body of
[46:23] Christ has got to be in their position
[46:24] in harmony see and then we can look
[46:27] around and see what the time of day it
[46:29] is see then the world's looking to see
[46:31] what it is see but they're watching you
[46:34] and if you're just a little hair spring
[46:36] mainspring whenever you are you do the
[46:38] very best job you can at that is the is
[46:45] the little hair spring important yeah is
[46:48] the big mainspring important yes
[46:50] every single part is important this is
[46:56] the last one I think
[46:57] yeah it's less cool and now because we
[46:59] have responsibilities we've got to
[47:00] answer to God someday for every man
[47:03] that's come on the face of the earth has
[47:05] to answer to God for responsibility and
[47:09] to many of us a stewardship we have to
[47:12] answer for this responsibilities of
[47:14] stewardship that's been committed to us
[47:15] by God I don't care what it is I said a
[47:18] few moments ago a housewife then be a
[47:20] genuine housewife that's right and if
[47:23] it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer
[47:25] whatever it is that God has put you to
[47:27] do you've got a stewardship to do that
[47:29] you've got to answer to God for because
[47:32] it takes all these things to do it
[47:34] praise God does that help a little bit
[47:39] no matter what God's called you to do
[47:41] we've got to do it with all of our
[47:42] hearts praise God
[47:44] every little part every big part
[47:46] everything is so important praise the
[47:50] Lord
[47:53] now before I get the goals in life I do
[47:57] want to read a few things out of here I
[48:00] was looking at it previously I want to
[48:02] finish this part now life on here is a
[48:05] trust before we get to goals in life I
[48:07] got about 20 minutes okay that's fine I
[48:11] want to wear myself out or you have I
[48:13] stared with stay with me here by God's
[48:15] grace so this is the third one life is a
[48:18] trust it's a race the other one it's a
[48:22] test yeah test and now it's a trust so
[48:25] to trust God's given us something now
[48:29] our time on earth our energy
[48:31] intelligence and opportunities
[48:33] relationships and resources are all
[48:35] gifts from God and he's entrusted to our
[48:38] care and management we are stewards or
[48:41] whatever God gives us this concept of
[48:44] stewardship begins with the recognition
[48:45] that God is the owner of everything and
[48:48] everyone on earth amen like when God
[48:53] gives us a paycheck really that whole
[48:54] paychecks God's right because he gave me
[48:58] the ability to go to work
[48:59] amen so giving 1/10 is just giving it to
[49:02] God that's just giving 10% of the
[49:04] hundred he's given back to you he lets
[49:06] you keep 90 God's really nice isn't he
[49:08] he's a real caring God isn't he you take
[49:12] 90 I'll take 10 what a loving God the
[49:17] Bible said the earth is the Lord's and
[49:19] the fullness thereof it's all God's and
[49:22] church this and we never really own
[49:25] anything on earth what do you really own
[49:27] what can you take with you it's not good
[49:31] only your character that's all you
[49:32] that's really all you own that's part of
[49:34] your spirit and soul but what you let
[49:37] God mold into your human spirit what you
[49:40] got with which nature you let God put in
[49:42] your soul whether it's a it's a Holy
[49:45] Ghost nature or it's a foolish virgin
[49:47] which is a dormant nature the seeds ever
[49:49] not quickened right in the soul you know
[49:52] whatever one it is that's what we're
[49:53] taking with us he says God just loves
[49:56] the earth to us while we're here it was
[50:00] God's property before he arrived and God
[50:03] will loan it to somebody else after you
[50:04] die you just get to enjoy it for a while
[50:07] all the good and the bad right we bought
[50:10] our house that well you know we bought
[50:12] it from the man who built it there's a
[50:13] lot of things we like about the house
[50:15] there's a lot of things we didn't like
[50:16] to see but he just we just he just
[50:19] loaned the house this really bought it
[50:21] you know and we got to put up with
[50:23] everything that he did in the house some
[50:25] good some not so good
[50:26] you gotta fix it but you know I've got
[50:29] time goes on we're gonna give the house
[50:30] to somebody else everything's all alone
[50:34] even your children the Bible said
[50:36] they're a heritage for the Lord praise
[50:39] the Lord they're really God's and this
[50:44] was from the beginning member Genesis 1
[50:46] what did God tell him God said be
[50:48] fruitful and multiply and he says I'm
[50:52] putting you in the garden now this is a
[50:54] different version of the Bible but he
[50:55] says bring it under the control I'm
[50:57] putting you in charge he told Adam so
[51:00] see the very first thing was a trust
[51:02] I'm trusting you to take care of the
[51:04] garden the first job God gave to humans
[51:08] was to manage property praise God
[51:13] so we realized that let me move on here
[51:22] it's kind of like wait have you ever
[51:24] rented out a house or you know you get
[51:26] most of you stay in hotel rooms do you
[51:29] just trash a hotel room no cuz if you're
[51:32] you trash it what's gonna happen they're
[51:35] gonna take that down payment or whatever
[51:37] however you do it's not yours right the
[51:40] hotel rooms not yours but you still
[51:42] treat it good because you want to be a
[51:44] faithful steward of it you want to be in
[51:47] good condition when you move out that's
[51:49] how our lives are here right if god
[51:51] Terry someday this this might not be a
[51:53] church sanctuary anymore but we want to
[51:55] leave it in better condition than we
[51:57] found it and so far we have and our
[51:59] landlord appreciates that she tells me
[52:01] all the time how much he appreciates us
[52:03] we want to treat it better than what it
[52:06] was treated before because we're just
[52:08] stewards of it we just were just gonna
[52:10] have to answer and be accountable for
[52:12] what God has trusted in our care in
[52:15] other words Christians live to a higher
[52:17] standard than the world we should treat
[52:20] everything we should treat our
[52:21] was better we should treat this church
[52:23] better we should treat our cars better
[52:25] we should care more about the things
[52:27] that are given to us because that's what
[52:29] they were they were given to us praise
[52:33] God now I'm not saying to go to extreme
[52:36] and worship your car and wash her car so
[52:39] they come into church on Sunday that's
[52:40] what brother Graham did and he said I
[52:41] wasting God's time he said that's the
[52:43] only thing he stole from God was time on
[52:44] Sunday morning when he should have been
[52:46] in church before he was a Christian he
[52:48] was out there washing his car to Sunday
[52:49] morning he said that's the only thing I
[52:51] ever stole my life was God's time that's
[52:54] I'm not saying do that but I'm saying
[52:56] take good care of it because it's
[52:59] something God gave to you that's what
[53:02] I've tried to do with our van I told the
[53:04] Lord of Lord if you ever give me a new
[53:05] car again I'll take care of it I have
[53:07] taken here that I give it washes all the
[53:08] time I cleaned out this morning before
[53:10] church spraying it down and fixing the
[53:12] mats and you know the trash out there I
[53:14] got to take care of it I don't want to
[53:15] drive around a piece of junk
[53:16] that's just a natural act to what we
[53:20] should be doing spiritually as well
[53:21] cleaning out all the trash out of our
[53:24] lives
[53:25] maintaining our spiritual health right
[53:30] Christians live a higher standard
[53:34] that's right now like this in the
[53:39] parable of the talents in Matthew 25
[53:42] let's go there if you got your Bible
[53:43] it's just about 10 more minutes here I
[53:46] know it's familiar but let's go back and
[53:48] read that that was like we said we
[53:50] looked at that dollar amount and c25 the
[54:00] the parables verse 14 to 29 okay yes I
[54:08] was yeah my memory serves me right amen
[54:10] that's good I thought maybe it was one
[54:13] town of three tailed five towns but it
[54:15] was one two five yeah verse 15 and unto
[54:19] one he gave five talents to another two
[54:20] to another one to every man according to
[54:23] several ability and straightway took his
[54:27] journey he gave one man a hundred and
[54:31] sixty-nine thousand dollars can you look
[54:34] that
[54:35] another man $320,000 and another man
[54:40] $800,000 all right
[54:43] are they men I'm giving you $800,000
[54:46] I'll see you in 30 years you guys are
[54:51] coming back nobody I'd like to see what
[54:54] you did with my money
[54:54] how'd you invest my money brother can
[54:57] you imagine $800,000 invested make
[55:02] something of it the worst thing he could
[55:05] do is what go buried in the ground
[55:08] that's the worst thing you can do that's
[55:12] the worst thing I can do is take my
[55:16] $320,000 and go bury it and put putting
[55:19] a safe and lock it away in my bedroom
[55:21] I'll stuck it in my mattress that's the
[55:27] worst thing you can do with what God's
[55:29] giving you and remember what did God say
[55:31] about the man who buried his talent in
[55:33] the ground you wicked and lazy servant
[55:37] so see it's a wicked and lazy thing to
[55:40] do is to receive God's talent and then
[55:44] don't do anything with it
[55:45] don't try to make more of it so see what
[55:52] our christians christians have to be
[55:53] doers not just hearers I mean don't get
[55:56] wrong we'd love to come to church and
[55:57] hear the word of God but we have to do
[55:59] something about what we hear Christians
[56:02] are doers when I get to those quotes
[56:05] I'll remind you brother BAM said don't
[56:07] just drift around in life he said have
[56:10] ambition have a goal know what you're
[56:12] doing right and the greatest thing we
[56:16] can do with our money is basically give
[56:17] the tithes and offerings and support the
[56:19] missionary work that's the greatest
[56:20] thing we can do because missionaries the
[56:22] highest calling in the Bible the
[56:24] Apostles the highest calling in the
[56:25] Bible and if you help support them
[56:27] you're helping finish the Great
[56:28] Commission but I like this let's go to
[56:33] verse 21 I like I like what the author
[56:35] sentiment pull out three things if you
[56:37] and I are faithful and we invest that
[56:41] $160,000 we're gonna get a three-fold
[56:43] reward this was so beautiful I just
[56:46] thought it was real simple but real
[56:48] beautiful verse
[56:49] twenty-one his Lord said unto Him well
[56:51] done thou good and faithful servant did
[56:53] you catch you that's the first reward
[56:54] that's called affirmation he says God
[56:57] affirms that you did a good job
[56:59] I want God's affirmation don't you well
[57:03] done sister Naomi well done Lydia see
[57:06] how haha I feel so good if Jesus says it
[57:11] well done he affirms that you did what
[57:16] you were supposed to do
[57:17] so the first reward you get is Jesus
[57:20] affirming that you did his perfect will
[57:24] now the next thing where's 21 now it's
[57:28] been good and faithful servant I'm sorry
[57:30] now it's been faithful over a few things
[57:31] I'll make thee ruler over many things so
[57:36] the second thing after affirmation is
[57:38] promotion glory I like that God promotes
[57:43] him because you were faithful with this
[57:46] I'm gonna make you I'm going to promote
[57:48] you to something greater praise God so
[57:54] see it's not so important to be promoted
[57:56] in this life church it's not some
[57:58] to be promoted now it's important now to
[58:01] invest and be faithful and all the
[58:03] resources God has given to us because
[58:07] the real promotion comes later in fact
[58:10] the more promotions you get in this life
[58:11] the more temptations there are and the
[58:14] church said Amen right the more
[58:17] promotions you get the more I'm a pretty
[58:19] big guy I'm a big shot how much them I
[58:23] must be really good I must be and then
[58:25] the pride of life sneaks in there now be
[58:30] honest Church I watched some of my
[58:31] friends get promotions and every time it
[58:35] takes them further away from Christ
[58:37] well they'll start and here's I've
[58:39] noticed it but then they pretty soon
[58:42] they buy fancier clothes fancier house
[58:45] then they start doing the things of the
[58:48] world more watching TV shows watching
[58:53] movies doing things they never would
[58:56] have done before when they didn't have
[58:57] as much money or much promotion or less
[58:59] titles it seems like everyone
[59:02] my friends I've seen that they get
[59:04] promoted they just get instead of get
[59:06] more humble they get more worldly now
[59:09] nobody here you know I'm not talking
[59:12] about you brothers or anything like that
[59:13] or myself or anybody like that but my
[59:16] friends that I've seen that are not in
[59:18] this church every time they get a
[59:20] promotion I can I'll give you some
[59:22] examples afterwards if you want I think
[59:24] if you want to talk to me privately I'll
[59:25] give you some examples
[59:26] every time see because if we can't
[59:31] handle that Saint no use it as a
[59:33] temptation so the first thing is
[59:38] affirmation in heaven glory then
[59:41] promotion you were faithful on earth now
[59:46] see because your faith with this now
[59:48] make your rule over much my goodness if
[59:52] I can just handle this little church
[59:54] here right here if I can just be
[59:55] faithful with preaching three times a
[59:57] week here I wonder what God will do
[59:59] later on I can just be faithful with
[1:00:03] those seven little children right there
[1:00:05] I can just be faithful and faithfully
[1:00:07] love them and do Bible time and pray
[1:00:09] with them and love them and do all I can
[1:00:11] do feed them and take if I can just be
[1:00:13] favor of those I wonder what God will do
[1:00:15] later on in life I just got to be
[1:00:17] faithful affirmation well done promotion
[1:00:22] I'll make you ruler over much the third
[1:00:24] thing is celebration he said come and
[1:00:27] share your masters happiness let's read
[1:00:30] it
[1:00:30] enter thou into the joy of the Lord
[1:00:34] Laurie oh now it's time to be a
[1:00:39] celebratory kind of person now I was
[1:00:41] time to rejoice member the proverbs 31
[1:00:43] woman this is what she lives for she
[1:00:46] rejoices in times to come praise God
[1:00:49] this is what she lives for and we're
[1:00:52] part of the proverbs 31 church praise
[1:00:53] God this is what we live for this is
[1:00:58] when we rejoice oh when we cross over
[1:01:02] there's rewards waiting for us if we can
[1:01:04] just be faithful stewards hmm now like
[1:01:12] with the
[1:01:12] says here how you deal with natural
[1:01:15] money is a reflection of how you deal
[1:01:18] with spiritual things and that's true he
[1:01:22] said most people fail to realize that
[1:01:23] money is both a test and a trust from
[1:01:26] God God uses finances to teach us to
[1:01:28] trust him and the church said on that
[1:01:30] one because you always feel like we
[1:01:33] don't have enough finances so what we
[1:01:35] have to do constantly trust in God I'm
[1:01:38] laughing cuz I'm going through it you go
[1:01:42] it's just right season sometimes the
[1:01:44] money's up sometimes it's down god uses
[1:01:47] this to trust to guess to trust him okay
[1:01:51] there's nothing sent me to meet my knees
[1:01:52] like either somebody's sick with cancer
[1:01:54] died or a money problem right because
[1:01:58] you feel like Oh am I gonna have enough
[1:02:00] or am I gonna be going in debt what's
[1:02:02] gonna happen you know for many people
[1:02:08] money's the greatest test of all like
[1:02:10] the rich young ruler money is the
[1:02:13] greatest test let's go to Luke 16 I'm
[1:02:16] almost done I got this says I got three
[1:02:18] minutes about probably take a few more
[1:02:19] over well I'll try to be done give me a
[1:02:24] minute here 1611 Luke 1611 and just so
[1:02:36] you know Church the last few years I
[1:02:37] purposely increased my tithes and
[1:02:39] offerings because I've had I just had
[1:02:42] questions like for example should I
[1:02:44] tithe on every gift I get I get lots of
[1:02:46] gift cards from the parents so I've had
[1:02:48] so many questions on that I just
[1:02:49] purposely increased my tithes and
[1:02:51] offerings just in case I want to be I
[1:02:54] want to make sure I cover my bases like
[1:02:58] Jacob said I will give you a tithe on
[1:03:00] everything I receive now Abraham didn't
[1:03:03] say Abraham gave ties from all the
[1:03:05] spoils but Jacob said if you're my god
[1:03:07] and if you bring me back to my land or
[1:03:09] my homeland my promise that I will tithe
[1:03:11] on everything that I received I'm just
[1:03:15] debating priest I get you know I try to
[1:03:16] get more than what I because I I just
[1:03:19] want to be faithful I've got to remember
[1:03:22] that's not my money
[1:03:26] that's not my money that's God's money I
[1:03:29] remember what you do with the physical
[1:03:31] money is what you do with spiritual
[1:03:33] gifts if you're faithful with money then
[1:03:37] you're favored with a spiritual talent
[1:03:39] or some of ability that's true because
[1:03:44] it says right here Luke 1611
[1:03:49] now the 310 my mom always read this to
[1:03:52] me always my mom was always reading this
[1:03:55] to me she you know she quoted on the NIV
[1:03:57] or whatever but he that is faithful in
[1:03:59] that which is least is faithful also in
[1:04:01] much and he that is unjust in the least
[1:04:05] is unjust also much verse 11 if
[1:04:08] therefore he have not been faithful in
[1:04:11] the unrighteous mammon or that means
[1:04:13] money who will commit to your trust true
[1:04:17] riches if you can't be faithful with
[1:04:20] unrighteous dirty paper and I say that
[1:04:23] are unrighteous
[1:04:26] dirty digital numbers on your bank
[1:04:28] account statement on the PNC app if you
[1:04:35] can't be faithful with that how you
[1:04:37] gonna be faithful with true riches and
[1:04:38] what's true riches faith yes so the Holy
[1:04:42] Spirit that's true riches right because
[1:04:45] the Bible said God has made the poor of
[1:04:47] this world rich in faith haha Aran hands
[1:04:50] right there
[1:04:50] amen the true riches our faith and faith
[1:04:53] is one of the gifts of the Spirit never
[1:04:58] see them if we can't be faithful with
[1:05:00] paper or electronic money how is God
[1:05:05] gonna give us spiritual gifts
[1:05:07] there's not 45 minutes that's why I love
[1:05:13] this and this was this was speaking to
[1:05:15] me church this was like coming off the
[1:05:16] pages like my this is I need this I need
[1:05:19] this in my life he said this is very
[1:05:22] important truth Christ Jesus says
[1:05:25] there's direct relationship between how
[1:05:27] I use my money and the quality of my
[1:05:29] spiritual life that's true that's true
[1:05:32] how I manage my money my worldly wealth
[1:05:35] determines how much God can trust me
[1:05:37] with spiritual blessings
[1:05:39] true riches that is right that's what he
[1:05:42] just said
[1:05:43] Luke 1611 if you can do the money right
[1:05:46] how can I give you true riches and there
[1:05:50] isn't don't you think that's why I've
[1:05:51] god bless brother Branham with his
[1:05:52] spoken word so many times because he
[1:05:54] just gave money away he could had all
[1:05:56] kinds of ties but he just I'll just take
[1:05:58] a little salary so God's God bless him
[1:06:01] with the spoken word right if you can be
[1:06:05] trustworthy with money you can be
[1:06:07] trustworthy with the Word of God how you
[1:06:14] manage your money determines how much
[1:06:16] God can trust you with spiritual
[1:06:17] blessings that's true he says let me ask
[1:06:21] you is the way you manage your money
[1:06:23] preventing God from doing more in your
[1:06:25] life can you be trusted with spiritual
[1:06:29] riches Jesus says everyone let's go to
[1:06:36] Luke 12:48 last one let's say an or fee
[1:06:38] I'm gonna get you out of here I try to
[1:06:44] keep my word here Luke 12:48 so life is
[1:06:53] a trust it's a race test trust next time
[1:06:56] we'll look at life is a temporary
[1:06:58] assignment is a temporary journey
[1:07:01] I'm just the pilgrim and stranger in
[1:07:03] this land my real home is in heaven the
[1:07:07] future home oh thank you Jesus praise
[1:07:10] God
[1:07:11] oh man Luke 12:48 but he that knew not
[1:07:18] and didn't commit things worthy of
[1:07:21] stripes shall be beaten with few stripes
[1:07:23] so look Jesus says there's gonna be
[1:07:26] people in heaven that they didn't know
[1:07:27] better but they still disobeyed so
[1:07:29] they'll get beat they'll get beat with
[1:07:30] less stripes they're ignorant foreign to
[1:07:36] whom suffer much as this is what my mom
[1:07:37] read to me yeah right here she always
[1:07:39] said to me Jessie - for whom so much is
[1:07:41] given much is required she always tell
[1:07:44] me that and I'm like what are you
[1:07:44] talking about and she was talking about
[1:07:47] sports because I had a reputation you
[1:07:49] know my wife could tell you more about
[1:07:50] that everybody knew me
[1:07:53] everybody in the town knew me so she
[1:07:55] said you got to watch your behavior
[1:07:56] because everybody's looking at you 48
[1:08:01] for unto whomsoever much is given of him
[1:08:05] shall much be required so the more
[1:08:08] you're given the more responsibility God
[1:08:10] wants you to have and to whom men have
[1:08:16] committed much of him they will ask the
[1:08:18] more remember brother grams friends told
[1:08:20] him I'd hate to have to answer for what
[1:08:22] you're gonna have to answer for remember
[1:08:24] Jack Moore told brother Branham that and
[1:08:28] that's my brother man who said he said
[1:08:30] it drives me to desperation then Oh God
[1:08:33] I'm desperate give me the word on
[1:08:34] marriage and divorce and God did amen
[1:08:37] lorry see that's what we need to do see
[1:08:42] God what if what's my purpose in life
[1:08:44] why am I here find it right true riches
[1:08:49] do that be faithful with that and then
[1:08:52] God will reward you and promote you
[1:08:54] later on in heaven that's I want to live
[1:08:57] my life don't you I don't mind having a
[1:09:02] small church I love like I love all you
[1:09:03] Saints I don't know nothing bothered me
[1:09:07] at all I feel so free up here I can
[1:09:08] preach be like I could preach you know
[1:09:10] brother Aaron said that when he first
[1:09:11] came here he says you act like you're
[1:09:12] preaching 200 people I said well that's
[1:09:14] right because I just love preaching I
[1:09:16] love Jesus Christ I love this word and
[1:09:18] if the whole world turns me down and we
[1:09:20] all say together I'll still be the
[1:09:22] happiest preacher in Akron because I
[1:09:25] know it's not about this this is all
[1:09:27] gonna pass away I just have to be
[1:09:30] faithful with the mysteries of God
[1:09:33] that's all gonna do I just have to be a
[1:09:35] steward brother bang of these New
[1:09:37] Testament mysteries it's all guy dude
[1:09:38] I said boldness preach them and truth
[1:09:41] and direct all of you to the cross of
[1:09:43] Jesus Christ to the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] that's all God do if I can do that one
[1:09:49] day Jesus will look at me and say well
[1:09:50] done
[1:09:51] you were a tiny little preacher with one
[1:09:55] town of preaching ability he says well
[1:09:58] done good and faithful servant
[1:10:01] now I'm gonna promote you
[1:10:03] now you're gonna get that big church you
[1:10:05] always wanted or you always thought you
[1:10:08] should have or wonder why you couldn't
[1:10:10] have a bigger Church there but you know
[1:10:11] you know to me I'm content here but what
[1:10:13] I'm saying is that God will promote us
[1:10:14] to more there's 50 minutes life is a
[1:10:20] test and a trust and the more God gives
[1:10:22] you the more responsible he expects you
[1:10:25] to be let's bow our heads do you feel
[1:10:29] like you're more responsible now than
[1:10:32] you were last year
[1:10:35] are you as careful with your money now
[1:10:39] as you were let's say five years ago in
[1:10:46] terms that's why the last few years I've
[1:10:47] noticed I haven't been as faithful so
[1:10:49] and I wasn't sure about things I just
