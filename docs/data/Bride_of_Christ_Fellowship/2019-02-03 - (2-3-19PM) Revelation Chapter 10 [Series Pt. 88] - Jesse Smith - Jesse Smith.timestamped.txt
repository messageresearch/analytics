[29:09] like to just return now to the book of
[29:12] Revelation I could do some teaching on
[29:14] this it's one of the Revelation chapter
[29:16] 10 verse 1 I'm sorry about that but kind
[29:33] of hot in here darling yes did you open
[29:36] the window that'd be ok thank you
[29:37] sweetie I apologize if anyone else is
[29:43] kind of cold but I'm kind of hot
[29:45] Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 so we're
[29:54] looking at chapters 10 and 11 I think a
[29:56] couple weeks ago we looked at revelation
[30:00] 8 and 9 on a Wednesday night so we're
[30:02] working our way through the book of
[30:03] Revelation and this is important for all
[30:06] of us you know when I go back and start
[30:08] studying these things again
[30:10] helpful things that I learn and remember
[30:13] then I know it's good for the young ones
[30:15] to praise God I know our little ones are
[30:17] starting to get older now and they can
[30:19] start understanding it and understand
[30:21] why we believe what we believe by the
[30:24] grace of the Lord so Revelation chapter
[30:27] 10 verse 1 let's read verse 1 together
[30:41] if we can ready 1 2 3
[30:44] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[30:47] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[30:51] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[30:53] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[30:56] pillars of fire amen let's bow our heads
[30:59] for a word prayer one more time if ever
[31:01] need on your heart just making on into
[31:02] God Heavenly Father we love you Lord God
[31:05] we thank you again for this gathering
[31:06] Lord as we heard this morning father may
[31:08] the waves of faith Lord the warm waves
[31:11] of faith Lord start moving here in our
[31:14] midst Lord God and Lord as we look at
[31:16] Revelation 10 Lord we know that that's
[31:18] you Lord you came down to earth dear God
[31:21] and father I just asked God by your
[31:23] grace and mercy Lord and that sweet
[31:25] presence Lord would be with us God your
[31:27] presence dear God in your presence is
[31:30] where we're strong Lord and we prayed
[31:32] and sang earlier that you would draw us
[31:33] into your presence so Lord in your
[31:35] presence is fullness of joy and life and
[31:38] all that we have need of is in your
[31:39] presence so Lord let us feel that
[31:41] tonight father god revive us again Lord
[31:43] strengthen us again and if is again
[31:46] build us up Lord God into the stature of
[31:48] a real Christian so father speak to us
[31:50] through this thy word in Jesus Christ's
[31:53] name in every said Amen god bless yous
[31:55] being seated praise guy well there's one
[32:06] great thing I left out this morning
[32:07] brother hoses they brought to my
[32:08] attention afterwards the emancipate my
[32:11] head sebacean proclamation was in 1863
[32:14] and the seals were opened exactly a
[32:16] hundred years later in 1963 so I got to
[32:20] add that to that graphic I got to update
[32:22] that graphic I'm gonna make my own
[32:23] graphic that's right
[32:24] to do because that one's run out of room
[32:26] so again a hundred years after Abraham
[32:29] set all the captives Abraham Lincoln
[32:31] said all the captives free God comes and
[32:34] breaks all the seals in 1960 300 years
[32:37] later and that sets all of us free
[32:39] because it's quickening power with the
[32:40] opening of the word so thank you brother
[32:43] I'd heard that before I just forgot it
[32:45] so I'm sorry but thank you I appreciate
[32:46] that that's not like Jose he's got all
[32:49] this if all those revelations like fresh
[32:52] on his heart in mind the Holy Spirit
[32:53] brings it down to him so we're very
[32:55] grateful for that
[32:57] okay revelation 10 yesterday I spent all
[33:01] those hours and I just got that one
[33:03] sermon from this morning I was kind of
[33:04] laboring in the message but it finally
[33:06] came together so I don't have any more
[33:08] on that right now I got a study on
[33:09] purpose again this week but so I have to
[33:12] by just by necessity I got to start
[33:14] going back to the revelation here so
[33:15] hope that's okay we'll go back to
[33:17] Revelation 10 and if it's okay
[33:20] liddie you can switch over here I'm just
[33:22] gonna play the video because I put all
[33:24] the scripture references on the video on
[33:27] YouTube and then I just downloaded it
[33:31] and then I'll go through the scriptures
[33:32] and maybe Lydia Malachi if you can have
[33:34] the Bible's ready to read forced but I'd
[33:37] be ok
[33:37] we have some Bibles in case you maybe
[33:38] you have a Bible to read you okay you
[33:40] don't want to read okay I don't have a
[33:43] Bible okay all right so let's look at
[33:47] that here we'll go Polly get through
[33:49] chapter 10 and chapter 11
[33:51] yes server thank you thank you so for
[33:59] most of us a lot of these are review but
[34:01] I know there's some scriptures in there
[34:03] I've never heard preached before and
[34:04] they they go really well with this topic
[34:07] so you know revelation is a little bit
[34:11] of a just a little bit revelation is a
[34:13] great mystery to most people to us you
[34:15] know we actually have some chapters that
[34:17] are completely thus saith the Lord to us
[34:19] in the in the seventh seal brother
[34:21] Branham said that search ages plus the
[34:23] seals he said they're all thus saith the
[34:25] Lord so we have revelation one two three
[34:30] and at least six we have at least four
[34:31] chapters that are absolutely thus saith
[34:33] the Lord
[34:34] so we're grateful for that
[34:36] now other people you know they a lot of
[34:38] people just guess and things like that
[34:39] we even have other the state the Lord's
[34:41] Revelation 13 brother Ram gave us a bus
[34:43] say at the Lord for the mark of the
[34:44] beast so we know exactly the state the
[34:47] Lord what the mark of the beast is he
[34:49] said it's unionized religion right
[34:51] confederation of religion he says so we
[34:54] have so many thus say the Lord's in here
[34:56] that what we do is what I do is I start
[34:58] with all of us say at the Lord's and if
[35:00] you have all those symbols and all the
[35:02] scriptures write together then that
[35:03] helps you interpret the rest of it
[35:05] and so that's what I want to do tonight
[35:07] we want to use all the revelations that
[35:09] we've heard and put them all together
[35:11] and actually let me pull this quote I
[35:15] just was looking at yesterday I've
[35:16] forgotten about it you know we're doing
[35:20] today what brother Branham wished he
[35:21] could have did okay so this is a 1961
[35:25] program said he's preaching the
[35:27] revelation series how are all you
[35:29] enjoying the revelation all right I
[35:30] believe a whole lot like my little girl
[35:33] Sara back there said it's become
[35:34] revolutions to me it's just revolutions
[35:37] going over and over you know I wish we
[35:40] just had a now so that's January 1st of
[35:44] 1961 well Graham said I wish we had now
[35:47] until March or April January February
[35:50] March April so three or four months in a
[35:52] row he wanted to do this and just put a
[35:56] great big canvas across the back here
[35:58] back of the pulpit and just come down in
[36:04] the daytime and draw all those pictures
[36:06] and the whole chart and just raise them
[36:08] up and down like window shades you know
[36:11] like I've always dreamed sometime of
[36:14] having a great big tabernacle somewhere
[36:16] where I could reach just
[36:18] could reach down and pull this chart
[36:20] down come all the way across the
[36:21] platform and revelations and the
[36:24] interpretations the Lord has given me
[36:25] and take a pointer and start through
[36:28] there and bring these ages down then
[36:30] when we get there I'm sorry then we get
[36:32] through this raise that one up pull the
[36:34] other one down like this and start on
[36:37] that and teach it through oh that would
[36:39] just be like a little heaven wouldn't it
[36:43] just set the complete winter through
[36:45] just sit it out with the Lord don't you
[36:48] like that oh that's what we get to do
[36:50] now you know when we pull up our our
[36:53] little slides like this you know we put
[36:55] slides up and and the other ones let me
[36:57] go to the other ones recently teaching
[36:59] on these orders of you know things like
[37:01] this about the this the spiritual year
[37:04] of Israel you know all these times that
[37:06] we can pull up our timelines and
[37:09] everything where's another other
[37:10] dimensions you have the dimensions of
[37:11] seven dimensions where's a good timeline
[37:15] well you got all the timelines you got
[37:16] the four the four transitions of the
[37:20] twelve tribes of Israel how they trans
[37:21] are they transfer like that you've got
[37:24] Mount Zion showdown my my temple mount
[37:30] mount a temple rock I thought I had more
[37:32] time lines in there well I must have
[37:33] timelines and the other ones but you
[37:35] understand what I'm talking about yeah
[37:36] here we go brother Brandon thought it
[37:39] would be a great little heaven yeah
[37:40] things like this like Daniels 70 weeks
[37:42] you can put it out all down through
[37:43] there and how the church ages comes in
[37:45] between the middle of that 70th week so
[37:48] I think we understand right you
[37:50] understand brother Brandon wish he had
[37:51] the time to do that but he wasn't called
[37:53] to do that he wasn't called to be a
[37:55] pastor anymore he was called to be a
[37:56] prophet and the angel said do the work
[37:58] of evangelist so I'm very happy now that
[38:00] we have a chance to do some of these
[38:02] things that the Prophet never got to do
[38:05] because of his calling and his
[38:07] commission so we're now on chapter 10
[38:09] this is part 88 of the series and we'll
[38:12] just look at a few things now I I
[38:16] believe this this quote here tells us
[38:19] also that revelation 10 is the say at
[38:21] the Lord - I now might be open to a
[38:24] little bit of interpretation but brother
[38:26] BAM says in trying to do God a service
[38:28] the Bible Malachi 4 said what would
[38:31] happen today revelation 10 how the seals
[38:33] would be open and reveal all these
[38:35] mysteries that's been hid through these
[38:37] reformers he said how it would be done
[38:40] it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord
[38:42] God has completely perfectly identified
[38:45] that and vindicated to be truth by signs
[38:48] wonders in the heavens and the skies and
[38:50] everything else or 33 years all right
[38:53] so see how I think it's sometimes it's
[38:55] important to see that it seems like
[38:57] miligrams saying revelation 10 is also
[38:59] thus saith Lord because it's in the
[39:01] Bible and he says come to pass
[39:04] now this is the quote brother Jose and
[39:06] I'd look for a couple times and found it
[39:08] on what is the attraction of the
[39:09] mountain brother Ram said what happened
[39:11] on Mount sunset God confirming his word
[39:13] that's where all this noise is about
[39:15] notice it's God fulfilling his promise
[39:18] word again of revelation 10 one two
[39:20] seven and the days of the sounding of
[39:22] the seventh angels message the mystery
[39:23] of God should be finished they hid a
[39:25] mystery of Revelation ten one two seven
[39:27] the last message to the last church age
[39:30] fulfills exactly in this age st. Luke
[39:33] seventeen thirty the day when the Son of
[39:34] man shall be revealed now brother man
[39:38] then tells the story of seeing the
[39:40] vision of the seven angels and then he
[39:42] says the God of heaven promised the
[39:45] evening time would have evening lights
[39:46] three years ago this mystery of his
[39:49] vision was a prophecy what time is it
[39:52] sir
[39:53] he said but now it's history it's past
[39:56] okay and he says it's past the promises
[40:00] fulfilled what time is it sir what's the
[40:02] attraction God fulfilling his word he's
[40:04] the same yesterday today and forever now
[40:07] you got to really keep your balance in
[40:09] the book of Revelation don't you because
[40:12] there's so much is that's not and this
[40:14] is not in the right order right it's not
[40:15] chronologically in the right order for
[40:18] example we just got done preaching
[40:19] revelation 7 8 and 9 and most of 7 8 and
[40:23] 9 is in the Tribulation Period right and
[40:27] the 60 on the fifth and sixth see are
[40:29] actually in the Tribulation Period as
[40:31] well so it's interesting in chapter 6
[40:34] you have the 6 seals the lasts the fifth
[40:36] and sixth one are in the tribulation
[40:38] then you jump to chapter 7 which is the
[40:40] 144,000 and I believe the bride could be
[40:42] the foolish version though and the bride
[40:44] that picks it up the tribulation chapter
[40:47] 8 and 9 is definitely tribulation and
[40:49] now you get to chapter 10 and we got a
[40:52] fast-forward back into the church ages
[40:55] right so what do we need Church we need
[40:59] the grace of God yeah we need the grace
[41:01] of God to understand this most people
[41:03] I've seen try to teach you they you know
[41:04] not in the message but without the
[41:06] understanding the message they just go
[41:08] right through like it's chronological
[41:09] order and of course you get all kinds of
[41:12] problems when you do that like who is at
[41:15] the Church of Latter day Saints they
[41:17] believe that
[41:17] right is the hundred forty-four thousand
[41:19] and they thought oh my you know we will
[41:22] have 144,000 believers and now there are
[41:24] church of millions you know and and they
[41:26] still say well there's only 144,000 of
[41:28] us that are gonna make it I wouldn't
[41:31] want to be part of that church would you
[41:32] know I wouldn't want to be I'd be one of
[41:35] them I want to be a part of the blood
[41:36] wash Church praise God the church that
[41:38] doesn't add to the Word of God that
[41:40] doesn't take away that just believes
[41:42] exactly what the Bible says amen so we
[41:47] of course we have a prophet that's done
[41:50] this almost said pastor but prophet we
[41:53] have a prophet that's done this he's
[41:54] given us das say the Lord not adding to
[41:56] the Bible just saying what the Bible
[41:58] says and then giving us thus saith the
[42:01] Lord now let's go through this here I
[42:02] turned off the volume shouldn't be
[42:04] playing there and let's look at I broke
[42:08] this down into themes okay so I broke it
[42:10] down to themes so the major theme of
[42:14] this book of this chapter is the open
[42:17] book that Christ opened in heaven coming
[42:20] to the earth to finish the mystery of
[42:22] God and to be prophesied to the entire
[42:24] world
[42:25] okay so that's the theme of Revelation
[42:29] chapter 10 we play it now now then I go
[42:33] to symbols and key revelations next
[42:37] so the key symbols are the mighty angel
[42:40] which will come up in a moment okay
[42:44] well this shows where it was formerly a
[42:46] sealed at so you know the scriptures
[42:48] there it was formally sealed with seven
[42:51] seals in Revelation 5 6 and 8 right
[42:56] because all the seals had to be broken
[42:58] so it was formally sealed up and now
[43:01] Christ is bringing his sealed book down
[43:04] to earth thank God amen so now we go to
[43:09] the symbols and key revelations here the
[43:12] first one is the mighty angel the second
[43:14] one is the little open book the third
[43:17] one is the cry with a loud voice as when
[43:19] a lion roars so those are the three
[43:22] great symbols or revelations in this
[43:25] chapter that I found you have a mighty
[43:28] angel coming down you have a little book
[43:29] open and then you have
[43:31] have the cry with a lot of voice as a
[43:34] lion's roar so if you have your Bibles
[43:38] let's take your Bibles Lydia maokai
[43:39] maybe if you could read that and you got
[43:41] a Bible back there okay now kind of okay
[43:43] yeah case you don't read all right thank
[43:47] you
[43:47] so Malachi why don't you go to
[43:52] Revelation chapter 1 Malachi verse 15
[43:54] and 16 so this scripture proves that
[43:58] Christ is the mighty angel because the
[44:00] descriptions of him in Chapter 1 match
[44:02] the descriptions in chapter 10 and I
[44:05] think it'll come up here oh yeah we have
[44:08] the seven thunders or I'm sorry the
[44:10] seven thunders or key revelations as
[44:12] well the seventh angel and the eating of
[44:14] the little book these are all symbols
[44:15] that we want to understand
[44:17] so especially our little children let's
[44:19] perk up your ears let's let's make sure
[44:20] we get this that's really important so
[44:22] you can understand this they could think
[44:26] if you are living in the days of Jesus
[44:27] and think if the preacher said this
[44:30] scripture has been fulfilled in our day
[44:32] wouldn't that set your heart on fire
[44:34] wow this this book was written a
[44:37] thousand years ago and is fulfilled
[44:39] today
[44:39] this ought to set our hearts on fire
[44:41] amen
[44:42] this was written 2,000 years ago was it
[44:45] not and yet we're privileged we can
[44:47] stand here and say God sent a prophet
[44:49] gave us thus saith the Lord that this is
[44:51] history this has already come to pass I
[44:53] don't know any other church that can say
[44:55] that although the churches say oh it's
[44:57] for the future it's a pass or something
[44:59] like that but we can say it's happened
[45:02] in this day so we thank the Lord for
[45:04] that we glorify the Lord in that oh and
[45:07] there's one more ok the command for John
[45:09] to prophesy again to the entire world
[45:11] not sure how I missed that okay so the
[45:14] mighty angel this is Christ Jesus coming
[45:16] down to earth okay so Malachi read verse
[45:19] [Music]
[45:21] yeah read read chapter one 15 and 16
[45:41] okay so in Rev
[45:43] in Chapter 1 Jesus Christ has that
[45:45] description maokai just read but in
[45:48] chapter 10 verse 1 he has the face as it
[45:51] were the Sun which matches chapter 1
[45:53] where Jesus has his countenance as the
[45:56] Sun praise God so the next one I believe
[46:01] is there we go okay yeah the second one
[46:08] there his feet as pillars of fire in
[46:10] chapter 10 verse 1 a mighty angel that
[46:12] comes down and also revelation one his
[46:15] feet as if they were burned in a furnace
[46:17] amen so there you have two witnesses
[46:19] right and in the mouth of two or three
[46:21] witnesses then every word be established
[46:23] so this has to be Christ and of course
[46:25] there's many quotes or milligrams said
[46:27] that the seventh so that the mighty
[46:29] angels that came down was Christ
[46:31] all right so now we move now after we
[46:34] prove that now we move to the little
[46:36] book and this is a symbol that all the
[46:40] seven seals are now to be revealed upon
[46:42] the earth Christ has come down to reveal
[46:44] the identity of the four horse riders
[46:47] the souls under the altar the day of
[46:49] wrath and the silence in heaven at the
[46:51] moment of the rapture that's what Christ
[46:53] has come down to reveal okay so let me
[46:57] see if I put anything on here okay so
[47:03] yeah he reveals identity the four horse
[47:05] riders know that souls under the altar
[47:09] the fifth seal and the sixth seal the
[47:12] day of the wrath of the Lord and then
[47:15] seven seal
[47:16] now that's confusing to anybody the
[47:18] seventh seal has already been open in
[47:20] its speed in its symbol form but not in
[47:24] this reality form the reality opening is
[47:27] that brother Branham says it in message
[47:30] is that Feast of Trumpets
[47:32] remember I said the Feast of Trumpets
[47:34] the seventh seal is the day in the hour
[47:36] of Christ's coming so that part of the
[47:39] reality form of the seventh seal has not
[47:41] been open but the understanding of it
[47:44] the revelation of the seventh seal has
[47:46] and that is that it's is coming praise
[47:48] God
[47:49] but not the reality form because Christ
[47:51] hasn't come physically yet to meet us in
[47:55] the air now the next one is
[47:57] they can go to a moss three seven and
[47:59] eight is now we look at he comes down as
[48:02] when a lion roars okay so Lydia this
[48:06] mighty angel comes down and he roars
[48:08] with a loud voice as a lion's roar so
[48:11] lady can you read that please three
[48:14] seven and eight
[48:36] amen all right Jordan you see that when
[48:39] the Lord wants to speak he's gonna
[48:40] reveal something to one type of person a
[48:42] prophet and then he reveals that secret
[48:46] to the Prophet and the Bible compares it
[48:48] to a lion roaring and then it compares
[48:51] it to God speaking and prophesying
[48:54] through a prophet so this mighty angel
[48:57] comes down he's got the face like Christ
[48:59] he's got feet like Christ and now here
[49:02] he's roaring like a lion in other words
[49:04] he's speaking through a prophet praise
[49:07] God he roars with a loud voice as when a
[49:10] lion roars okay now next we do the seven
[49:15] thunders next cymbals the seven thunders
[49:22] okay now I got something here too the
[49:24] Bible foretold that Christ would reveal
[49:26] the mystery of the seven seals okay yeah
[49:29] so that through this we understand at
[49:31] the mystery the seven seals would be
[49:33] revealed now that book is fully open how
[49:35] many could say amen to that
[49:36] the book that comes down is fully open
[49:39] so all seven seals must be broken or
[49:41] some people today said all the seven
[49:43] seals not open
[49:43] well the reality's not happen yet but
[49:46] the revelation has we know it's the day
[49:48] in the hour like the brother Graham told
[49:50] us here so an open book comes down and
[49:52] say an open book a book with just but
[49:55] one seal still on it it's fully open and
[49:57] so the seven seals have been revealed
[49:59] praise God
[50:00] that's right now I think the next one is
[50:06] seven thunders okay no let's get past
[50:09] that
[50:15] I'm having trouble skipping there oh
[50:17] there we go all right okay now get your
[50:20] Bibles this is the one I want you to see
[50:21] here go to Psalms 18 then Psalm 29 let's
[50:25] read this right in the scripture here
[50:26] this is one of the most beautiful
[50:29] portions about the voice of God is
[50:31] Thunder I don't know if I ever have
[50:34] preset has anyone ever heard me preach
[50:35] that on the Psalms 29 I don't think I
[50:37] appreciate I did I forgot
[50:40] Tom's 29 well that's what 18 13 though
[50:43] first now can you read Psalms 18 13 then
[50:49] Lydia help me you'll help me on Psalm 29
[50:51] okay yeah if you can do 18 13 sir
[51:04] alright so they're a thunder din in
[51:07] Psalms 18 Boyce the Lord is a thunder
[51:11] ain't no Psalms 29 it's a beautiful one
[51:13] now I've I prodded my brother Bram said
[51:17] I prodded and probe and tried to make
[51:20] these seven voices fit but I can't do it
[51:23] so if God gives you a revelation that'd
[51:25] be perfect from this morning's message
[51:27] share it with me if you if you can all
[51:30] right so let's go to Psalms 29 3 2 11
[51:33] there are seven times in this chapter
[51:36] God said his voice is a thunder seven
[51:39] times and seven is the number of
[51:41] completion right and there's seven seals
[51:43] seven church ages seven five seven
[51:44] plagues seven everything so it seems
[51:48] like there's a mystery lay in here we're
[51:50] just waiting for the revelation of God
[51:51] okay verse three Lydia read three little
[51:55] why don't we wrote that you read three
[51:56] I'll read for would this rotate till
[51:58] we're done so go ahead with verse three
[52:01] sweetie well I'm sorry honey it's
[52:05] chapter 29 verse 3 sorry but I say wrong
[52:16] okay November the voice of many waters
[52:20] was brother have said the voice of many
[52:22] waters was water it was voiced is
[52:24] calling out a judgment against sinners
[52:26] I'm not sure but there's seven of these
[52:29] I'm not sure
[52:29] that fits but there seven numbers for
[52:32] the voice of the Lord is powerful the
[52:34] voice of Lord is full of majesty
[52:37] lydia verse nine alright verse six he
[52:45] maketh them also to skip like a calf
[52:47] Lebanon in Syrian like a young unicorn
[52:50] there is verse 7 Lydia divides flames of
[52:55] fire interesting verse 8 the voice of
[53:00] Lord shake at the wilderness the Lord
[53:03] shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh in
[53:05] Lydia verse 9 verse 10 the Lord sitteth
[53:15] upon the flood yay the Lord sitteth King
[53:18] forever and Lydia verse 11 alright so if
[53:25] you're counting I underline them seven
[53:27] times with read in my Bible there so I
[53:29] could come seven times
[53:31] God said his voice is like a thunder the
[53:34] voice of the Lord is like this the voice
[53:35] the Lord is like this so thunders
[53:38] represent the voice of God so when this
[53:40] open book came down it had to be spoken
[53:42] through a prophet and seven thunders
[53:44] under their voices now this is a firm
[53:48] everyone this is the one brother Branham
[53:50] uses in the seals John 12 let's go there
[53:52] John 12 28 and 29
[54:06] down 12 28 29 I'll read that one father
[54:10] glorify thy name
[54:11] then came there a voice from heaven
[54:13] saying I both glorified it and will
[54:15] glorify it again the people therefore
[54:19] that stood by and heard it said that it
[54:22] thundered others said an angel spake to
[54:25] him
[54:25] so some people think angels some people
[54:27] think Thunder Jesus heard the actual
[54:29] voice of God right the heavenly father
[54:30] but again a voice of God is attached to
[54:33] a thunder we see that so 3 more than 3
[54:37] witnesses in the scripture so now we can
[54:40] see that Christ would speak through a
[54:42] prophet and that prophets teaching on
[54:45] the seven seals from the open book would
[54:48] be thus saith the Lord the voice of God
[54:50] spoken on the earth praise God now
[54:54] here's a good one - let's do this one
[54:56] let's do the seventh angel in verse 7 I
[54:59] don't know if I've ever read these with
[55:01] my family actually you read through the
[55:03] whole Bible but I don't think I ever
[55:04] pointed their mouth there's four verses
[55:06] that call men angels in the Bible men
[55:10] preachers as angels so I read that one
[55:14] already about the prophet teaching seven
[55:17] seals so if we hear it is yeah here I
[55:21] would just want to want to read with the
[55:22] children so Malachi get Galatians 4:14
[55:26] Lydia can you get first samuel twenty
[55:27] nine nine and then i'll get this one at
[55:30] that word ii samuel 1927 so I'm sure
[55:37] church you if you've ever talked to
[55:38] anybody about brother Brandon being the
[55:40] seventh angel
[55:41] if you've ever talked about it they'll
[55:42] say well that says angel it doesn't say
[55:44] a man but then there's other verses that
[55:46] say oh did you know the did you know the
[55:49] seventh angel that blows the seventh
[55:51] trumpet is a literal angel did you know
[55:53] that so you have a seventh angel blowing
[55:56] a seventh trumpet for that seventh
[55:58] destruction and it's a literal angel but
[56:00] in Chapter ten you have a seventh angel
[56:02] that's a man so how do you know ones on
[56:05] earth ones in heaven that's how you know
[56:07] and you have to watch program so you got
[56:09] to watch their ministries here's an
[56:11] angel on the earth and he's sounding
[56:13] forth the mystery of the open book
[56:16] on the earth and you see the rest of the
[56:18] chapter they take that that book and it
[56:20] goes to all nations so that is clearly
[56:23] an earthly ministry the other one goes
[56:25] to seven ages that blow trumpets you
[56:27] know there's hail a third of the grass
[56:29] burns a third of the people die a third
[56:31] of the waters return the blood and then
[56:33] the seventh angel blows the seventh
[56:34] trumpet and I believe that's the third
[56:36] woe if I'm not mistaken as well and so
[56:38] you have to match the ministries match
[56:41] them to the rest of the Bible and then
[56:42] you'll see revelation 10 7 is a man on
[56:44] the earth because as as earthly ministry
[56:47] matches that of a preacher but the
[56:49] seventh angel with the seventh trumpet
[56:50] that's a heavenly ministry so you have
[56:53] to rightly divide the word of God and
[56:56] thank God that we had a prophet to do
[56:58] that for us so Malachi Galatians 4:14
[57:00] this is where st. Paul's called an
[57:02] Angels who had Malka and that's
[57:13] something the church in Galatia thought
[57:15] so much of brother Branham they said
[57:17] you're like an angel even as what what
[57:19] does it say read that last part even as
[57:22] Christ Jesus Wow they had such a
[57:24] reverence for brother Paul and he had
[57:27] almost the level respect is the Lord
[57:29] Jesus so see he was an angel so see the
[57:35] things we believe is not wrong
[57:37] the things we believe about revelation
[57:39] 10 7 a mighty angel or I'm sorry
[57:41] revelation 1 about mighty angel come
[57:42] bring it down to the seventh angel
[57:44] that's scriptural it's at its absolute
[57:46] scriptural for a prophet to be called an
[57:47] angel okay so Lydia first samuel 29 nine
[57:52] that's david called angel okay cuz he he
[58:06] said don't let David go into battle he's
[58:08] like an angel of God to us alright
[58:11] second Samuel 1927 I'll read this one
[58:15] 19:27 and he has slandered thy servant
[58:19] unto my lord the king but my lord the
[58:21] king is as an angel of God do therefore
[58:25] what is good in thine eyes
[58:27] so David twice is called an angel of God
[58:29] twice
[58:30] in revelation 22 8 9 if you got
[58:32] everybody can turn that in revelation 22
[58:34] 8 and 9 now this just brings a lot of
[58:44] joy to my heart I mean don't you wish
[58:46] when you were a child you could have got
[58:47] this instruction from the Word of God
[58:49] don't you wish Jose I wish Matt like I
[58:53] was telling who was I'd tone I thank God
[58:55] for the church I was raising but it was
[58:56] all just God loves you in John 3:16 and
[58:59] then speaking tongues and that's all it
[59:02] was that 7 that's all I learned about I
[59:04] never gotten into any deep teaching like
[59:05] this to understand what the symbols mean
[59:07] and how the angel can mean a man and the
[59:10] seals and the church ages nothing so we
[59:13] thank God that this generation our
[59:15] children can grow up and know the Bible
[59:17] amen revelation 22 8 9 and I John saw
[59:28] these things and heard them and when I
[59:30] had heard and seen I fell down to
[59:31] worship before the feet of the angel
[59:33] which showed me these things
[59:36] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[59:38] for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy
[59:40] brethren the prophets he's one of the
[59:43] prophets and of them which keep the
[59:47] sayings of this book worship God this
[59:50] was not an angel like a heavenly angel
[59:52] this was a man someone who kept the Word
[59:57] of God he kept the sayings of God now
[59:59] there's a lot of guesses as to who this
[1:00:00] is and I'm not gonna make any guesses
[1:00:02] cuz I don't know if I ever got the
[1:00:04] revelation of course I'd tell you but I
[1:00:06] doubt it the point is though whoever
[1:00:09] whatever man this was it must have been
[1:00:12] and this must have been a theophany or
[1:00:13] something come down here he come down
[1:00:16] and gave these revelations to John he
[1:00:18] said don't worship Me I'm one of thy
[1:00:20] brethren the prophets and I keep the
[1:00:22] sayings of this book as well so it must
[1:00:25] have been a New Testament prophet
[1:00:26] perhaps okay so hope my children can
[1:00:30] understand that hope all the children
[1:00:31] can understand that that went by the
[1:00:33] Bible says in Revelation 10 7 that
[1:00:35] there's a seventh angel on the earth
[1:00:37] prophesy angel can mean a man it could
[1:00:40] mean a prophet on the earth because Paul
[1:00:43] was a prophet
[1:00:44] here's a profit right here revelation
[1:00:45] 20:2 8 9 okay eating the little book so
[1:00:50] Malachi first Peter 2:2 and Lydia why
[1:00:53] don't you go to Matthew 4:4 those are
[1:00:55] kind of familiar scriptures eating the
[1:00:59] little book is the next one it's getting
[1:01:02] there yeah Matthew 4:4 okay on the video
[1:01:20] then we just rely we reveal how we
[1:01:23] believe that was brother Branham okay
[1:01:29] okay so here's where I want to get to
[1:01:31] meal so eating the book is symbolic of
[1:01:34] believing and obeying the truths that
[1:01:36] Christ spoke in his revelations about
[1:01:39] the seven seals so you have to believe
[1:01:42] this open book all these revelations you
[1:01:44] have to believe that my brother and said
[1:01:46] all depends on your attitude write it
[1:01:48] off it's all about your attitude towards
[1:01:49] the message so Malachi first Peter 2:2
[1:02:00] alright so Peter even says when you're a
[1:02:03] young Christian you enjoy the sincere
[1:02:06] milk of the word it's like milk to you
[1:02:08] okay
[1:02:09] and then Lydia Matthew 4:4 okay so we
[1:02:20] live by every word that proceeds out of
[1:02:23] the mouth of God
[1:02:24] I have Matthew 5:6 and it says blessed
[1:02:27] are they which do hunger and thirst for
[1:02:29] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:02:31] oh we got to be hungry when you come to
[1:02:32] church - amen we got to be hungry in
[1:02:34] this hour right because if you're hungry
[1:02:37] for it you'll be filled with that Jesus
[1:02:39] says praise God and you know what while
[1:02:42] we're there go back to Hebrews five that
[1:02:44] just kind of come to me there go to
[1:02:45] Hebrews five since we talked about milk
[1:02:49] and just so you know I'm teaching a
[1:02:53] middle school Bible Club - and I'm
[1:02:54] teaching on I taught on milk and
[1:02:58] not long ago and I showed them how milk
[1:03:01] is your beginning doctrines meat meat
[1:03:04] preaching is where you're able God gives
[1:03:07] you wisdom to discern good and evil in
[1:03:09] your daily life that's me teaching when
[1:03:11] you can each day wake up and see okay
[1:03:13] this is Satan trying to get in I'm gonna
[1:03:14] reject that and now I'm going to accept
[1:03:16] righteousness now you're eating meat
[1:03:18] praise God
[1:03:19] whatever word been revealed to you when
[1:03:22] the word is revealed to you and you
[1:03:23] receive that and then each day you can
[1:03:25] see oh this is a temptation I'm gonna
[1:03:27] turn this down I'm not going to talk
[1:03:29] about that not gonna look at that I'm
[1:03:30] not gonna submit to that now you're
[1:03:32] getting in the meat of God's Word
[1:03:35] hallelujah
[1:03:36] Hebrews five and so I ask the middle
[1:03:42] scores I said can you handle tea I said
[1:03:44] who knows about Melchizedek and they're
[1:03:46] like you don't know anything about
[1:03:47] Melchizedek that's the same thing I
[1:03:50] would have said right in middle school
[1:03:51] what do you know about Melchizedek I was
[1:03:53] that who's Melchizedek
[1:03:54] I couldn't even I couldn't pronounce
[1:03:56] that name probably until I heard the
[1:03:58] message of the hour and so I took the
[1:04:01] kids and showed him milk and meat and I
[1:04:03] used these scriptures because these are
[1:04:04] very familiar now verse 10 Hebrews 5:10
[1:04:08] called of God and high priest after the
[1:04:11] order of Melchizedek of whom we have
[1:04:14] many things to say so Paul wanted to
[1:04:16] preach I'm not getting more and hard to
[1:04:19] be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing
[1:04:21] for when for the time ye ought to be
[1:04:24] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:04:25] you again which be the first principles
[1:04:27] of the Oracles of God and our become
[1:04:31] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:04:33] strong meat so Melchizedek is more meat
[1:04:37] teaching right if you start getting into
[1:04:39] how God changes mask his forms you're
[1:04:42] getting to the three bodies that you
[1:04:43] have right theophany glorified flesh
[1:04:47] body you start getting into God changing
[1:04:49] manifests or forms manifestations not
[1:04:51] persons but manifestations you start
[1:04:53] getting into some deeper topics
[1:04:57] okay so verse 13 for everyone that uses
[1:05:00] milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:05:01] righteousness for he's a babe but strong
[1:05:06] me here it is verse 14 but strong meat
[1:05:08] belongeth to them that are full age
[1:05:11] even those who by reason of use have
[1:05:13] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:05:16] good and evil amen so when you are
[1:05:21] feasting on the meat of God's Word now
[1:05:23] you can see you can see Satan trying to
[1:05:26] get in and you you close them out you
[1:05:28] rebuke him you say get behind me Satan
[1:05:31] right you spew you a resist Satan and he
[1:05:34] flees from you and now you just remain
[1:05:36] in God's presence you remain under his
[1:05:39] anointing with fellowship with God now
[1:05:41] you're eating meat praise God that's
[1:05:44] right but see most can I just show it
[1:05:49] like this let me uh I'll just pull it up
[1:05:50] real quick so I think I got in the
[1:05:52] teaching I did with the middle schooler
[1:05:53] here right here yeah I just talked to
[1:05:56] him not long ago
[1:05:58] yeah I said this is what this is
[1:06:00] literally literally this is what most
[1:06:02] denominations do in fact the church that
[1:06:06] I used to go to before I was the message
[1:06:07] they would show a circle and at each of
[1:06:11] the four parts of the circle they would
[1:06:13] have like love grace salvation and
[1:06:16] service and they admitted we just go
[1:06:19] around and around the circle we never go
[1:06:21] to deeper things of God and even before
[1:06:24] the message I knew something's wrong
[1:06:25] with that and that's what Paul is
[1:06:28] telling the Hebrew Christians they just
[1:06:31] go around the same things
[1:06:32] love your neighbor be gracious right
[1:06:35] God's grace is for you the prodigal son
[1:06:38] the Shepherd going after the Sheep which
[1:06:41] we appreciate all those good things but
[1:06:44] Paul says if you can't discern Satan
[1:06:46] your daily life then you're then you're
[1:06:48] just drinking milk all the time and you
[1:06:51] can't understand Melchizedek you can't
[1:06:52] understand anything deep you can't
[1:06:54] really get it because you're just going
[1:06:56] around and around in a circle drinking
[1:06:58] milk all the time
[1:06:59] you see we got to go beyond that in
[1:07:01] terms that's that we that's what we're
[1:07:02] desire to do is go deeper with the Lord
[1:07:04] right to be able to feast on the meat of
[1:07:07] God's Word so that that in that case no
[1:07:11] sin could become in our church right
[1:07:13] there be no leaven amongst us there's be
[1:07:15] no wickedness there be no evil thoughts
[1:07:17] there'd be no backsliders right because
[1:07:19] backsliding is when you give place to
[1:07:20] the devil
[1:07:21] you get tricked and you don't you don't
[1:07:23] cast out the devil we
[1:07:25] want any of that amongst us we want to
[1:07:27] be pure when we walk in obedience to the
[1:07:29] Holy Spirit I don't know about you but
[1:07:33] if I go a few days without eating meat
[1:07:34] brother Johnny I get kind of frustrated
[1:07:35] you know I like you I like meat I don't
[1:07:38] feel full right don't have a good
[1:07:41] chicken or a good steak or something
[1:07:42] like that or you know shrimp or
[1:07:44] something some type of meat but see Paul
[1:07:48] says we cannot live like this and this
[1:07:50] is what I was teaching the middle
[1:07:52] schoolers and I was saying how God is
[1:07:55] bringing us up on a teaching God wants
[1:07:58] us to graduate and go from elementary
[1:08:00] and the deep things of God I was
[1:08:01] teaching this with the kids there the
[1:08:03] milk teachings there's six milk
[1:08:05] teachings there in Hebrews five and now
[1:08:08] I'm getting into this now I'm on the
[1:08:09] kingdom of heaven with the middle scores
[1:08:11] we just went through the first mystery
[1:08:13] of the kingdom of heaven I don't think I
[1:08:18] have it on here but bro Graham talks
[1:08:21] about those in services is the end time
[1:08:24] so these are at least some meat
[1:08:26] teachings they're Melchizedek and
[1:08:28] discerning or judging good versus evil
[1:08:30] and so you can look at churches and you
[1:08:33] can see like if the pastor if I make a
[1:08:36] mistake and I let my let's say I let my
[1:08:38] wife start wearing a little makeup or
[1:08:39] cutting her hair now pretty soon that
[1:08:42] would be awful sin right because that
[1:08:43] dishonor that dishonours me that
[1:08:45] designers Christ and pretty if if that
[1:08:48] would be the case then that shows I
[1:08:50] don't have spirit of discernment and I'm
[1:08:52] just drinking spiritual milk when it
[1:08:54] comes to the Word of God and we know
[1:08:56] megachurches and the message that even
[1:08:58] allow women to cut their hair and wear
[1:09:00] makeup yet they're big huge churches
[1:09:02] what does that say about the church that
[1:09:05] says they're not a very mature Church
[1:09:07] when you start letting little things the
[1:09:10] little sins in and saying it's okay
[1:09:12] that's drinking them from the milk of
[1:09:14] God now I appreciate God's milk but I'm
[1:09:16] hungry for some meat in the head I
[1:09:18] deliver I'm gonna be a real mature
[1:09:20] Christian praise the Lord now see I hope
[1:09:26] you can understand that by God's grace
[1:09:28] okay so I know maybe I'll have to spend
[1:09:30] much time on that but I want to show you
[1:09:32] there that that's important for us to
[1:09:35] have that we got to have that deep
[1:09:37] teaching
[1:09:38] and so eating the little book then God
[1:09:42] the voice tells John eat the book so
[1:09:46] John has to eat those seven seals and I
[1:09:48] say this often but the one of the most
[1:09:51] rewarding sermon series I've ever
[1:09:53] preached was the seven seals back in
[1:09:55] 2008 and 2009 that was the one of the
[1:09:57] most rewarding series I've ever preached
[1:10:00] kind like the church ages that we just
[1:10:01] got done with last year it was so
[1:10:04] rewarding and I didn't even realize his
[1:10:05] sister Whitney but this is what I was
[1:10:07] doing I was eating the book have you
[1:10:09] ever done that have you ever gone
[1:10:11] through the seal look really slow that's
[1:10:13] what I did I highlighted Thalia
[1:10:15] highlighters at the bottom or
[1:10:16] highlighters they just take and just
[1:10:18] meditate on that what was it I doing I
[1:10:19] was feasting on the Word of God starting
[1:10:22] to understand God's use of symbols what
[1:10:24] a symbol stand for what does oil
[1:10:26] represent what a horse's represent what
[1:10:28] does white represent the colors and and
[1:10:30] all these what is dark and the dark ages
[1:10:32] in history what does it give you it
[1:10:35] gives you a deep understanding of the
[1:10:37] Word of God and then when you see that
[1:10:39] Antichrist white horse rider try to
[1:10:41] write into your life then you can cast
[1:10:43] them out in Jesus name that's right amen
[1:10:47] or you see a complex trying to rise up
[1:10:51] and get you bitter against some brother
[1:10:52] or sister in the church you can cast
[1:10:55] that down and say no I'm gonna love that
[1:10:56] person in Jesus name see you can sense
[1:11:00] that white horse rider because now your
[1:11:02] eyes are open you you understand you've
[1:11:05] eaten the open book it's a part of you
[1:11:07] now you're a mature Christian and you
[1:11:09] can discern when Satan's trying to get
[1:11:11] into your life praise God thank the Lord
[1:11:16] does that help by God's grace I hope my
[1:11:17] children versus Malachi wasn't in here
[1:11:19] so huh hopefully gets that one on the
[1:11:21] later on okay let's go forward here now
[1:11:27] see this is so important and these are
[1:11:29] little teachings and remember brother
[1:11:30] Ram wish he could have done this he
[1:11:32] would she wished she could have went
[1:11:33] through all of his revelations one by
[1:11:35] one on the book of Revelation I'm glad
[1:11:37] we get to go do it here okay now the
[1:11:41] command for John to prophesy again to
[1:11:43] the entire world that's in let me read
[1:11:45] that that's revelation ten eight I
[1:11:46] believe
[1:11:52] and the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:11:56] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:11:58] the little book which is open in the
[1:12:00] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[1:12:02] the scene upon the earth now Lydia
[1:12:03] prognosis and maybe Malkin acacia but
[1:12:06] John represents the bride right because
[1:12:08] John got caught up in chapter 4 after
[1:12:11] the church ages ended there at least
[1:12:13] there and just like the bride gets
[1:12:15] caught up at the end of the Laodicean
[1:12:17] Church eh and that finishes the Gentile
[1:12:19] Church age so John the bride has to go
[1:12:23] eat the Seventh Seal message that's come
[1:12:26] down from heaven Jesus loose the seals
[1:12:27] brought it down to earth so then he
[1:12:31] takes the open book and it's revelations
[1:12:34] and spreads the truth around the world
[1:12:36] finishing Jesus's Great Commission
[1:12:40] alright that's a revelation I'm sorry
[1:12:45] Matthew 28:19 and 20 but we're very
[1:12:48] familiar with that I don't need to read
[1:12:49] that
[1:12:51] okay let's forward a little bit here
[1:12:56] okay we talk about next is John we are
[1:12:59] talking about this John symbolizing the
[1:13:02] the bride of Jesus Christ yeah let me
[1:13:06] just see if I can fast forward what was
[1:13:10] easier earlier I don't know why it's so
[1:13:12] hard now to do that yeah so John just
[1:13:14] like John said come up here they're in
[1:13:17] for one immediately after the seven
[1:13:19] church ages and the revelation chapters
[1:13:22] two and three
[1:13:23] he was caught up hither right after the
[1:13:25] seven Church Ages so John represents the
[1:13:28] Bride of Christ okay now I end the video
[1:13:36] by showing the timing of events so I
[1:13:39] show how revelation 10 one two seven is
[1:13:43] fulfilled there we go there we go so
[1:13:50] Jesus uttered
[1:13:51] seven thunders or the revelations of the
[1:13:53] seven seals through his prophet William
[1:13:55] Branham in 1963 so we say that is finish
[1:13:59] and that was a hundred years after the
[1:14:00] Emancipation Proclamation glory amen
[1:14:03] let's see what else is on there okay so
[1:14:08] yeah I just quote brother Branham
[1:14:10] basically and say revelation 10 1 to 7
[1:14:12] is in the past so right now we're in the
[1:14:15] fulfillment of Revelation
[1:14:16] I'm sorry revelation 10 8 to 11 now
[1:14:23] let's read verse 11 this yeah this is
[1:14:24] just come to my heart here let's read
[1:14:26] verse 11 I'll read it and he said unto
[1:14:29] me thou must prophesy again before many
[1:14:32] peoples nations tongues and kings now
[1:14:34] does that sound familiar recently what
[1:14:36] we preached let's go to revelation 7 in
[1:14:40] revelation 7 is a multitude a great
[1:14:43] multitude of people that comes from
[1:14:46] peoples nations tongues and kings right
[1:14:51] so see how this is not chronologically
[1:14:53] in order in Revelation 10 they're still
[1:14:55] going out and prophesying again taking
[1:14:58] the same prophecies from this open book
[1:15:00] from the messenger brother Branham and
[1:15:02] taking them around the world but in
[1:15:04] Revelation 7 we see that group it's a
[1:15:07] completed group and they're there with
[1:15:09] palms worshiping the Lamb of God amen oh
[1:15:12] yeah let's see it's not in order and
[1:15:14] you've got to make the scripture line up
[1:15:16] in the right order
[1:15:17] okay revelation 7:9 and this I beheld
[1:15:21] right after this I beheld and lo a great
[1:15:23] multitude which no man could number of
[1:15:24] all nations and Kindred's of peoples and
[1:15:27] tongues stood before the throne and
[1:15:29] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[1:15:31] and palms in their hands there's that
[1:15:33] Gentile multitude praise God so see
[1:15:36] revelation 10 verse 11 proves this is
[1:15:40] before the rapture because after the
[1:15:43] rapture God's done with the Gentiles
[1:15:45] God's not going to the Gentiles God's
[1:15:47] going to get his Jews he's going back to
[1:15:49] get his his Jewish people that he now
[1:15:52] took off the blindfold he's going back
[1:15:54] to get his Jewish people so see
[1:15:56] revelation 10 proves this is still in
[1:15:59] the Gentile church age and that's where
[1:16:02] I said Church remember that quote BAM
[1:16:04] said you
[1:16:04] don't see the church remember from
[1:16:06] revelation for two 19's every remember
[1:16:08] that program said that but here
[1:16:09] revelation 10 we see the church and
[1:16:12] that's one more reason why you can't
[1:16:14] make every word brother Branham said
[1:16:16] thus saith the Lord as we went through
[1:16:18] that quote I think of two ends days ago
[1:16:20] both have said see you don't see the
[1:16:21] church anymore from revelation four to
[1:16:23] nineteen well here's the church mother
[1:16:25] and said thus saith the Lord that was
[1:16:26] him that that just happened to the
[1:16:29] church in Revelation 10 so what does the
[1:16:33] new Church it makes us rely more upon
[1:16:35] what the Holy Spirit rather than putting
[1:16:39] all the emphasis on brother Branham now
[1:16:43] just so you know this week I was just
[1:16:44] washin dishes a couple of times I
[1:16:46] thought well I want to see what what is
[1:16:47] uh what are they preaching that Branum
[1:16:49] Tabernacle with Joseph bread well
[1:16:50] they're preaching so I went on this
[1:16:51] guy's website and I listened to some and
[1:16:54] they are teaching that the tapes and
[1:16:57] this is an exact quote because I kept it
[1:16:58] they're teaching that the tapes is the
[1:17:02] word they say I have the exact quote
[1:17:05] from one of brother Rams children I'm
[1:17:07] not gonna say which one but you can
[1:17:08] probably guess and I love I love them
[1:17:10] dearly but they said the tapes which is
[1:17:13] the word and I looked up your brother
[1:17:14] branham ever say the tapes is the word
[1:17:15] no brother bear never said that so the
[1:17:18] people that are saying we only say with
[1:17:20] the tapes they only say what the tapes
[1:17:21] they only say what the tapes they're not
[1:17:24] saying what the tapes say are you with
[1:17:27] me and I laugh because you know I I
[1:17:29] don't mean to laugh but I'm not making
[1:17:32] fun of them but it just you know it's
[1:17:33] striking isn't it striking the very
[1:17:36] people that they play the tapes only
[1:17:38] played tapes now they're letting people
[1:17:40] preach to them before they play the
[1:17:43] tapes and give them off in many cases
[1:17:45] not all but in many cases of false
[1:17:47] interpretation of those tapes yeah okay
[1:17:52] and another one this is what I called
[1:17:56] the gentleman out on and that's why I'm
[1:17:57] preaching it because I called him out on
[1:17:58] these things and he didn't reply he
[1:18:01] replied one time and he changed the
[1:18:03] subject instead of answering my
[1:18:04] questions he changed to something else
[1:18:06] he said what do you believe it about
[1:18:07] which parts of the message do you
[1:18:09] believe I said well according to brother
[1:18:12] branham's quote from the rapture 1965
[1:18:15] brother Ram said the message of the hour
[1:18:16] is the Bible truce that
[1:18:18] God is revealing right now so I said I
[1:18:20] believe all the Bible message I said but
[1:18:25] I don't believe every word on the tape
[1:18:26] is thus saith the Lord
[1:18:30] okay and so the next one is there's a
[1:18:32] quote brother Graham says let me pull it
[1:18:35] up
[1:18:36] he said Joseph will do double everything
[1:18:39] that brother Branham did I don't want
[1:18:44] the exact phrase yeah it's in
[1:18:59] he says he'll do double okay yeah here
[1:19:03] it is now when I dedicate him the Lord
[1:19:06] that morning there was many baby
[1:19:07] standing and had mothers with them among
[1:19:10] the altar along the altar when I picked
[1:19:12] up Joseph in my arms not thinking what I
[1:19:13] was saying I said Joseph my son thou art
[1:19:15] a prophet that's my prayer anyhow so see
[1:19:18] he's not saying they'll say the Lord
[1:19:19] said that's just my prayer anyhow and I
[1:19:23] believe it'll be that God will take
[1:19:25] everything that he ever gave me now
[1:19:27] think about that
[1:19:32] he's the prayer lines everything he ever
[1:19:39] give me are you serious
[1:19:42] and I heard that and I thought I gotta
[1:19:44] ask this guy does he believe that and
[1:19:46] double it times doubles what's double
[1:19:49] time double four times two times two is
[1:19:51] that right I do teach first grade I
[1:19:54] don't teach a multiplication yet but I
[1:19:55] think that's right Nobel times double
[1:19:57] two times two four and put that on my
[1:20:00] boy then then when I leave that he'll
[1:20:02] take my place so I said to your brother
[1:20:05] I said I write this in all humility with
[1:20:07] all love to Joseph and everybody the
[1:20:09] family but has Joseph done double the
[1:20:13] prayer lines and discernments that
[1:20:16] brother branham has done and I said can
[1:20:19] you show me on tape how he's prophesied
[1:20:22] double thus saith the Lord's than his
[1:20:24] father and I said I had to come and I
[1:20:27] like to come and get into the sermon
[1:20:28] line if he's doing double because then
[1:20:30] he can meet double needs of the people
[1:20:32] and I could probably get caught up and
[1:20:34] get discerned in the line guess what no
[1:20:37] didn't say didn't you mention a change
[1:20:40] of subject what do you believe about the
[1:20:41] message which parts do you believe about
[1:20:42] the message and Hosea was there earlier
[1:20:46] voice of God number Hosea I said you
[1:20:49] were there I don't remember if I said
[1:20:50] can you show me one time brother Joseph
[1:20:53] on this old and not repeating his dad
[1:20:59] and they said no no see they already see
[1:21:07] that Oh see I'm laughing because I'm
[1:21:09] happy because we're in the truth and I'm
[1:21:12] not we're not exalting our
[1:21:14] but where would you find God would you
[1:21:15] find God amongst some big movement or
[1:21:17] would you find God in the little humble
[1:21:19] little flock and so see church when
[1:21:25] people get when people really get the
[1:21:28] wrong spirit and you try to correct them
[1:21:30] with it either they'll get mad or
[1:21:32] they'll just ignore it and this week I
[1:21:34] found out some of them just ignore it
[1:21:37] you don't write back they know what they
[1:21:39] don't they don't want to answer this
[1:21:41] question but I think I read this one to
[1:21:51] you a while ago
[1:22:03] brother branham said my Joseph was with
[1:22:06] me the whole time I think he said that
[1:22:09] yo so who's with me remember brother
[1:22:16] Jose when I preached that you remember
[1:22:17] that ok let me try to the exact quote
[1:22:23] was with me what you say all along
[1:22:29] no yeah something that he was with me
[1:22:35] anyway swear I'm sorry if I can't pull
[1:22:37] it up right now that's that's too many
[1:22:43] anyways the point was before Joseph was
[1:22:45] born God told him you can have a Joseph
[1:22:47] and at one point brother branham thought
[1:22:49] that Joseph was Billy PAH
[1:22:51] and he says it on tape now what are you
[1:22:54] gonna do if you're if you're a person
[1:22:56] that says every word on the tape is I'll
[1:22:58] say the Lord what are you gonna do with
[1:22:59] that one now you got Joseph you know
[1:23:05] Billy Paul Joseph but now you have
[1:23:07] another Joseph now you have two Joseph
[1:23:08] now where do you find that in the
[1:23:10] scripture so see it's just humility it's
[1:23:16] just being led by the right spirit right
[1:23:19] si lord have everything I have
[1:23:22] everything I believe to be founded upon
[1:23:24] the rock of the Word of God and not to
[1:23:27] go off on fanaticism okay so I don't
[1:23:33] know how I got there on that but I just
[1:23:34] thought I'd share that there so I
[1:23:36] believe revelation 10 107 was fulfilled
[1:23:38] in 1963 in revelation 10 ather 11 is
[1:23:40] command for John to prophesy the open
[1:23:42] book of the seven seals and that's being
[1:23:44] refilled right now church shouldn't that
[1:23:48] humble us that when we sent brother
[1:23:49] Simon we paid for Simon's ticket to go
[1:23:51] to Thailand that should humble us that
[1:23:53] were fulfilling revelation 10 8 to 11
[1:23:56] we're taking a little part in that thank
[1:23:58] God for the big churches right thank God
[1:24:00] they can send him to Japan and Europe
[1:24:03] and New Zealand and everywhere they sent
[1:24:06] him the Philippines you know thank God
[1:24:08] but we are in the process of fulfilling
[1:24:11] that and where we can just thank God
[1:24:13] that he gave us a little part in that
[1:24:15] trying to find Prix des
[1:24:17] seeds taking these prophecies taking
[1:24:20] them to the world okay
[1:24:23] so John represents a new church we're
[1:24:25] I'm sorry the New Testament church we're
[1:24:26] familiar with that I think that's the
[1:24:28] ending there by God's grace now is there
[1:24:37] any questions I would like to take this
[1:24:38] time to answer questions anybody have
[1:24:40] any questions this is a pretty familiar
[1:24:42] chapter any other questions any
[1:24:48] questions on chapter 10 all right now I
[1:24:54] think I'd better just stop there don't
[1:24:56] thing I'm gonna go to chapter 11 because
[1:24:57] I'm I'm already tired from this morning
[1:25:00] in Chapter 11 is quite a fulfilled
[1:25:03] chapter so I would
[1:25:06] I've been studying on the mysteries and
[1:25:09] numbers course and then times and
[1:25:12] seasons that got a little sermon coming
[1:25:13] up on that that's a really interesting
[1:25:14] thought we look at times and seasons
[1:25:16] hopefully the next few days by God's
[1:25:19] grace ER and weeks rather well let me
[1:25:22] think I guess we'll stop right there by
[1:25:24] the grace of Lord is there anything else
[1:25:25] I thought I wanted to mention here
[1:25:27] West's and to our feet I think we'll
[1:25:29] just close right there we'll be done
[1:25:36] Revelation chapter 10 let me just look
[1:25:44] through there one more time as you're
[1:25:45] standing here there's anything else I
[1:25:47] have on my heart to share write help us
[1:25:50] out
[1:25:57] the last thing I'll say is that brother
[1:25:59] branham said the seven thunders are
[1:26:01] already revealed now I've talked with
[1:26:06] both Simon about this Simon thinks the
[1:26:08] thunders are still going to sound in the
[1:26:09] future
[1:26:10] the Simon preaches this for us often and
[1:26:12] I love brother Simon that's just one
[1:26:14] thing we just differ on just everybody
[1:26:16] knows if you've heard him
[1:26:17] you probably heard him when I'm gone
[1:26:18] he'll mention the seven thunders and
[1:26:20] that's just where we differ there are a
[1:26:22] couple quotes her brother makes it sound
[1:26:24] like that but then quotes later that
[1:26:26] I've found especially in the church age
[1:26:28] book brother Branham says that the
[1:26:31] thunders have already been revealed in
[1:26:33] the seals so to me when brother man
[1:26:36] preached the first seal on that day in
[1:26:37] March that was the first Thunder second
[1:26:39] seal second thunder he preached the
[1:26:41] third seal third thunder and it just was
[1:26:43] seven thunders right over right in a row
[1:26:45] that's the way I teach that but just so
[1:26:47] you know if you hear brother Simon say
[1:26:49] that or when brother cam comes I think
[1:26:50] they both believe that and to me that
[1:26:53] doesn't hurt our fellowship at all
[1:26:55] unless I would say well well you're not
[1:26:57] as good as me you're not a good as
[1:26:59] Christian as me because I believe
[1:27:00] they're already revealed or if they
[1:27:02] would vice-versa but it's never been
[1:27:04] like that it's always been in godly love
[1:27:06] praise the Lord in church if there's
[1:27:09] anybody that should be able to love
[1:27:10] Christians should be us because Jesus
[1:27:14] said you'll love you know my disciples
[1:27:16] because they have love one for another
[1:27:18] Branson if you can't bitterly disagree
[1:27:21] with somebody and then shake their hand
[1:27:22] at the ends help you love him he said
[1:27:24] it's time to go back to the altar is
[1:27:26] that right
[1:27:27] hey man come on Malka I think that's it
[1:27:29] I think if I think that's one thing I
[1:27:31] didn't really labor on but I preached
[1:27:33] recently on the seven thunders and so I
[1:27:37] didn't really feel led to spend much
[1:27:39] time on that one okay I think that's it
[1:27:51] so the last thing I was just you know
[1:27:52] with my youtube ministry like I tell
[1:27:54] I've told you before I feel like that's
[1:27:56] me doing my part to prophesy again
[1:28:01] because I'm not prophesying myself
[1:28:03] necessary now there may be some times
[1:28:05] when I'm preaching and God anoints me
[1:28:07] and I don't even know it there could be
[1:28:08] that but most of the time when we
[1:28:11] prophesy again we're just saying what
[1:28:13] brother branham already said and that's
[1:28:16] one of my most popular videos I was
[1:28:17] gonna look it up real quick was the was
[1:28:23] the future prophecies of brother Branham
[1:28:25] it's one of the most popular ones let me
[1:28:27] look that up real quick just so you're
[1:28:28] familiar with that one yes number 5 and
[1:28:33] did you know make up in the Bible just
[1:28:34] passed a 200 1000 views so I was really
[1:28:37] happy with that to me that's going viral
[1:28:39] if I get 200,000 views on a video that's
[1:28:42] viral so yeah I was just I was rejoiced
[1:28:46] no today yeah we've has 200,000 for make
[1:28:49] up in the Bible it's interesting people
[1:28:51] want to know about sanctification right
[1:28:53] now my most popular videos or
[1:28:55] sanctification make up long hair long
[1:28:57] dresses and modest clothing the top 4
[1:28:59] and then 5 is future prophecies of
[1:29:04] brother Branham which has 31,000 views
[1:29:06] so to me when I made that video that's
[1:29:09] what I was doing since I can't go to all
[1:29:10] the nations I can put though I can do
[1:29:13] this I can put brother branham's
[1:29:14] prophecies out there and let that sound
[1:29:16] forth and now God just like God use the
[1:29:19] printing press right to spread the Bible
[1:29:21] and the teachings of Luther and the
[1:29:22] message of the hour now God is using
[1:29:24] Internet to do the same thing take this
[1:29:26] message where I could never go amen and
[1:29:32] if you see in the book there you know
[1:29:35] when it comes out I'll get you a copy
[1:29:36] for our home church people here and of
[1:29:39] course any visitors if you want to and
[1:29:40] there's some extra here you can have one
[1:29:42] I'm gonna order some when they get ready
[1:29:45] but there's testimonies from all over
[1:29:47] the world where people said all I'm done
[1:29:49] with makeup in New Zealand or I'm done
[1:29:51] with this in Africa
[1:29:52] you saved my soul you know different
[1:29:54] people through this ministry because
[1:29:56] it's it's doing what Revelation 10 says
[1:29:59] to do eat the book and then prophesy
[1:30:03] again amen
[1:30:08] and I'm sure you feel like that don't
[1:30:10] you feel like that when you when you
[1:30:11] read brother branham say thus saith the
[1:30:13] Lord the mark of the beast don't you
[1:30:14] feel something in your soul don't you
[1:30:16] feel the Holy Spirit prophesying in you
[1:30:19] like we get to be microphones right we
[1:30:23] get to be Mike's just repeating that
[1:30:25] letting the Holy Spirit speak that same
[1:30:27] prophecy through us
[1:30:29] like I've worn my mom I wore my friend
[1:30:32] bangs brother I warned them to their
[1:30:34] face and said we have thus saith the
[1:30:36] Lord every denomination is going to take
[1:30:38] the mark of the beast and what am i
[1:30:40] doing I'm prophesied God is prophesying
[1:30:43] through me God's prophesying through you
[1:30:48] so as we got to do is eat the little
[1:30:51] book have you enjoyed the eating the
[1:30:53] book tonight
[1:30:54] I trust uh I know that most of us who've
[1:30:57] been around the message have have heard
[1:31:00] some of these things before most of them
[1:31:01] which is good but I won the children
[1:31:04] especially to hear these things and you
[1:31:07] know when you were a little boy Malachi
[1:31:08] and Tim Meyers had a little little son -
[1:31:11] we sat there and talked and we said
[1:31:12] we're gonna give Bible studies and we're
[1:31:14] gonna teach our children the Word of God
[1:31:16] and now I get to do it we you know we do
[1:31:19] Bible time every night at home and my
[1:31:21] daughter's over there all out well most
[1:31:22] of them but you know we were just really
[1:31:24] exhausted I mean we're men right so
[1:31:26] where's else for our boys like we wanted
[1:31:28] to grow up and be man you know of course
[1:31:30] we love our girls too but the point was
[1:31:32] we're standing there and I said I'm
[1:31:34] gonna teach him the message so he knows
[1:31:35] the message like I didn't know I didn't
[1:31:37] know the message growing up but I can
[1:31:39] make sure my son knows the message right
[1:31:42] and that's what we want to do with all
[1:31:43] of our children make sure they know thus
[1:31:46] saith the Lord make sure they know the
[1:31:47] Word of God and then there'll be lights
[1:31:51] and witnesses just like we are praise
[1:31:52] the Lord all right let's just bow our
[1:31:55] heads here for word of Prayer
[1:31:58] what a blessing it is to eat this little
[1:32:01] book
