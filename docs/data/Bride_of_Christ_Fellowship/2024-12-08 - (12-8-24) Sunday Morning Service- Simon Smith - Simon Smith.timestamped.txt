[1:19] absolutely praise
[1:21] Lord amen thank you brother Jess
[1:27] powerful so um
[1:33] this is just something I uh I think
[1:35] brother Harley actually already heard
[1:36] this by pris I trust it'll be a blessing
[1:38] to you again this has been really uh
[1:41] Bruning on my heart there uh when I was
[1:44] there brother at uh the church there was
[1:47] it the good sheep or good flock I think
[1:50] they
[1:50] in was it sheep F Fellowship in nvar
[1:54] Ohio wonderful brothers wonderful Saints
[1:58] um
[2:01] Warriors pressed out sacrificed
[2:03] everything for the word of
[2:06] God so we'll see if this will connect
[2:09] here by God's
[2:19] grace a lot of times lately I've heard
[2:21] brother Bram saying man I wish I had a
[2:23] Blackboard I wish I had a chalkboard and
[2:25] sometimes I you can actually hear him
[2:26] writing on there and doing this and this
[2:28] and I'm like I'm more of like a I like
[2:30] the PowerPoint myself and U you have a
[2:33] direct
[2:35] HDMI USBC
[2:38] oh
[2:47] absolutely all
[2:52] right praise the
[2:58] Lord oh praise the Lord Lord amen
[3:00] there's
[3:01] our picture of our Lord and savior there
[3:06] um I can't think of anything
[3:08] else want to share uh just keep our
[3:11] assembly in prayer we got a lot of
[3:13] sickness and things
[3:15] attacking and uh we know one thing the
[3:18] devil does not attack for no reason when
[3:21] the enemy look at look at Israel look at
[3:22] Hamas they they're attacking for a
[3:24] reason there's a there's a motive and
[3:26] objective behind them right now Hamas
[3:29] and the huies and whoever else in Iran
[3:32] there's a reason they're attacking him
[3:34] uh so we know the the devil's not going
[3:37] to have his way but uh certainly the
[3:39] Lord will only give them what they can
[3:41] handle that's one of his promises by
[3:43] God's grace so let's get in here let's
[3:46] stand for the reading word uh trust I
[3:47] wasn't too long there
[3:51] um uh I'd like to turn to Genesis 6
[3:54] verse 5
[4:06] Genesis 6
[4:16] verse5 um I have a lot of confidence in
[4:19] the Bible an extreme if it's in the
[4:22] scripture and you can be proved we are
[4:24] laying our souls on it amen after one of
[4:27] my uh
[4:30] uh naps yesterday my wife was listening
[4:33] to brother one of brother Jesse's uh
[4:34] videos there and I woke up right at the
[4:36] time where he was reading the quote
[4:38] where the ram said he said he says my
[4:40] opinions are not
[4:42] infallible and I
[4:44] said there it
[4:46] is
[4:48] again but he said what he says this
[4:51] Bible is infallible amen this is why I
[4:56] have so much this is not just any other
[4:58] book this is a we can have full
[5:01] confidence we can rest on this word on
[5:05] the scripture oh even if the prophet
[5:08] said he my my my opinions my thoughts
[5:10] are not in Saints of
[5:12] godallah just think about what he when
[5:15] he was wondering about the that cloud
[5:16] and uh and or like he was he was dealing
[5:19] with that cloud in Revelations one where
[5:21] Jesus is head and he and he thought you
[5:23] know what I'll call Brother Jack Moore
[5:25] and he's a great Theologian and he'll
[5:26] tell me and then what he what brother
[5:28] Jack Moore told him just didn't sit
[5:31] right with him but he did if you look at
[5:33] what happened brother Ram didn't try to
[5:34] figure it out he said Lord he says what
[5:37] is the truth he say then the Holy Spirit
[5:39] revealed to me see so we can't figure
[5:42] things out we can't figure this out with
[5:43] our own minds we have to wait on the
[5:46] spirit of God to reveal it right in here
[5:49] and then show it back in the scripture
[5:51] and I think that's a phenomenal thing
[5:53] there by God's grace amen here let's
[5:56] let's jump into this here Genesis uh 6
[5:59] verse5
[6:01] he says and God saw the wickedness of
[6:03] man was great in the earth and that
[6:05] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[6:07] heart was only evil continually and it
[6:10] repented the Lord uh that he had made
[6:13] man on the earth and it grieved him at
[6:14] his heart amen let's turn to Luke 187
[6:19] for our last portion
[6:24] here Luke
[6:27] 18 and 7
[6:39] let's read
[6:43] uh verse
[6:45] 2-8 Luke 182 through
[6:51] 8 well let's let's read verse one to
[6:54] because it's Parable and he spake a
[6:57] parable unto them in in to this end
[7:00] that men ought to always to pray and not
[7:03] to
[7:04] faint there we
[7:09] are saying there was in a city a judge
[7:12] which feared not God neither regarded
[7:14] man and there was a widow in that City
[7:17] and she came unto him saying avenge me
[7:19] of my adversary and he would not for a
[7:21] while but afterward he said with in
[7:23] himself though I fear not God nor regard
[7:27] man but because this Widow troubleth me
[7:30] I will venture lest by her continual
[7:33] coming she weary me and the Lord said
[7:35] hear what the unjust
[7:37] saith and shall not God avenge his own
[7:40] elect which cry day and night unto him
[7:43] though he bear long with them I tell you
[7:46] that he will avenge them speedily
[7:48] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[7:50] shall he find faith on the earth amen
[7:53] let's say a word of
[7:56] prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you

[8:27] God spiritual Soldiers god Lord striving

[9:40] God lord and Lord Jesus Lord we love you
[9:43] in the name of Jesus Christ amen may
[9:45] have your seats there uh hope that
[9:47] wasn't too long prayer we just
[9:51] uh um I sometimes
[9:56] I I was a science major in in college I
[9:59] really enjoy science I don't fully
[10:01] understand a lot of things they bring
[10:02] out now uh The Depths and all those sort
[10:05] of things in fact I I was just happy to
[10:07] get through the the
[10:11] classes uh but I love it I might not be
[10:13] a scientist of my own right but when I
[10:15] see something scientific in aligns with
[10:16] the word of God I just just got to hit
[10:19] it because uh I'll say like this the
[10:22] only way I could even teach anything is
[10:23] if I actually I I see it you know you
[10:26] see it you may not you might I might we
[10:27] might not have the full understanding of
[10:29] the almighty God because in him dwelt
[10:32] all the all the knowledge all the
[10:34] intellect all the all the smartness all
[10:36] the things that God has they're in his
[10:38] mind but what he does give us SS of God
[10:40] we want to cling on to amen and SS of
[10:43] God if we be Eagles how how strong are
[10:45] those eagle claws amen right if when
[10:47] that when that when that eagle flies
[10:49] down let's say in Lake ER me me and my
[10:50] wife wi it when wi uh witnessed it one
[10:52] time we were on Kelly's Island and the
[10:54] eagle came down on the very tip the
[10:55] north part of the island and grabbed the
[10:57] fish right in front of us Brother Andy
[10:58] sister Lindsay were there the dogs were
[10:59] there watching and here we see but those
[11:01] claws were strong enough to dive into
[11:03] that water push through the water grab
[11:05] that fish latch on and it just flew on
[11:08] and had a little nice uh uh dinner
[11:10] itself there by God's grace so but they
[11:13] say that the Eagle's claw has so much
[11:15] pressure it can Crush vertebrae it can
[11:18] Crush spines it can Crush bones that
[11:20] kind of pow and SS of God if we be
[11:22] spiritual Eagles saints of God we can
[11:24] grab onto the word and we should be able
[11:26] to grab onto the Holy Ghost we should be
[11:28] able to grab grab on to God himself and
[11:31] not let go amen much like Jacob
[11:33] wrestling over what over he needed a
[11:35] blessing he says Lord I'm not going to
[11:37] let you go until I see a blessing come
[11:39] upon my life amen and thanks to God
[11:41] that's how we should be when it comes
[11:43] down to what troubling times when when
[11:45] when there something Rises up you don't
[11:47] know how to deal with when you see a
[11:48] giant like David did he never David
[11:50] fought a lion and a bear he never fought
[11:52] a giant this time but this time what he
[11:55] had to dig deep and say Lord God I'm
[11:57] trusting in you because because just
[11:59] like like that bear and that lion what
[12:00] this Giant's going to fall amen why
[12:02] because he caught the Revelation that
[12:04] Not only was the bear and the lion
[12:06] uncircumcised but that Philistine was
[12:09] also uncircumcised as well amen praise
[12:12] be to God Amen so uh we went to get in
[12:14] these things by God's grace uh we trust
[12:17] this will be a blessing um and I think
[12:20] this is where a lot of the overcoming
[12:23] will be by by these thoughts right here
[12:25] and I'd like to to uh speak on the power
[12:28] of thoughts
[12:30] hallah because everything is right there
[12:35] everything lays right
[12:38] here and I trust this so be a blessing
[12:41] now SS of God we know um by the by the
[12:44] Revelation SS of God I like this in what
[12:47] other age did people understand these
[12:50] things David didn't understand things
[12:52] Moses Abraham didn't know understand
[12:54] these things God had to come directly to
[12:57] them they were look they were
[12:59] forefathers they were the prophets they
[13:01] were what they were men God used in such
[13:03] powerful ways that they were what this
[13:05] they they were the example of Jesus
[13:07] Christ in fact when God joined with them
[13:10] they were living out the Life of Christ
[13:12] right so powerful and SS of God in this
[13:14] day what the Lord is now harnessing to
[13:16] us he's he's what drawing n to us he's
[13:18] filled us and what now we're living out
[13:21] Parts each one of us live out parts of
[13:23] Christ's life amen in in in one aspect
[13:25] or another these sort of things but
[13:27] saints of God the battle now as I heard
[13:29] heard the prophet God said he says he
[13:30] said the war in heaven started between
[13:33] what Jesus Christ and Michael the
[13:34] Archangel or or I'm sorry Satan and and
[13:38] uh Jesus Christ so here there's the war
[13:40] up in heaven right all these things and
[13:42] Satan we know took onethird of the
[13:44] angels and and and then uh of course God
[13:46] rose up and then uh he he cast Satan
[13:49] down and brother bam said he says the
[13:51] war that started Heaven he says now that
[13:53] war he says dwells within your
[13:56] minds he said that war up in heaven now
[13:59] is not literally in the Physical Realm
[14:01] where we're seeing swords and guns and
[14:03] bows and ARs and those sort of things
[14:05] but what he's what God said he's the
[14:08] prophet of God said he said what he says
[14:09] now it's what within the very minds of
[14:12] your soul right in right in the midst of
[14:14] the individual right in the individual
[14:17] person is where these battles will be
[14:18] right sure so here we see in 1
[14:21] Thessalonians 5:23 he says and the Very
[14:24] God of Peace sanctify you holy and I
[14:27] pray God your whole spirit
[14:29] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[14:32] until the coming of our Lord Jesus
[14:34] Christ so all three of these Realms gots
[14:37] to be what blameless they you you you
[14:40] you have to be what say Lord God well my
[14:42] body I've kept my body this way and I I
[14:45] I've been this clean and Lord I won't do
[14:47] this and I won't do that my hands are
[14:48] clean my mind's clean those sort of
[14:50] things but everything must be clean he
[14:53] says be preserved blameless amen so
[14:57] here's what we're dealing with right we
[14:58] we all know the these things brother
[14:59] Jesse sure sure has taught extensively
[15:01] on these things uh but here we have the
[15:04] body realm the spirit realm and the Soul
[15:06] realm faith and doubt and of course the
[15:08] predestinated SE Gene of God that dwells
[15:11] what within the children of God within
[15:13] the children of the most high amen so
[15:16] right here s to God that battle that was
[15:18] in heaven right in Genesis 1:1 all the
[15:20] way through two or however wherever that
[15:23] whenever that took place in between
[15:25] chapters 1 and three in between there
[15:27] there was a battle saints of God maybe
[15:29] it was even just before right at Genesis
[15:31] 1:1 who knows when the battle took place
[15:32] up in heaven exactly but we know for
[15:35] certain now the battle that was up there
[15:37] is now right
[15:40] here this is your War right here if you
[15:43] can see this is the war it what in the
[15:45] spirit realm amen amen saints of God now
[15:48] notice reasoning memory affections
[15:51] conscience and Imagination Saints of
[15:53] this is where this is where Satan will
[15:56] use these things against you amen right
[15:59] this is but remember this is also God
[16:02] not here here's here's it's taught a lot
[16:04] of times like this oh Satan can can
[16:06] bring you and and sear your conscience
[16:08] with a hot iron and then then if you do
[16:10] this again A lot of times when you're a
[16:11] child and the the children say don't lie
[16:14] God's watching you but watch the first
[16:16] lie bring forth out of a child and what
[16:18] they they say oh I didn't get killed
[16:20] right away the lightning did not come
[16:21] from heaven and strike me right then I
[16:23] must be okay I must God must see I must
[16:25] have Grace on me or he doesn't care
[16:27] maybe he didn't see it however and then
[16:29] that child will lie again and lie again
[16:30] why because now this conscience and as
[16:32] he tells another lie his conscience gets
[16:34] less and less and less and fin it's like
[16:36] I don't have any I can we can lie right
[16:38] to your face right and then we have an
[16:40] imagination and say oh maybe God doesn't
[16:42] see it or we imagine God is like oh he's
[16:44] he's over off doing something else he's
[16:46] not paying attention to me so we always
[16:48] a lot of times hear these things being
[16:49] used of Satan but Saints of God's God
[16:53] has full access to these things as well
[16:56] amen we've got to remember these things
[16:58] were not built for Satan these things
[17:00] were built for God for to use in your
[17:03] life amen now now notice this is Jesus
[17:05] did not God say hey come let us reason
[17:08] together what the word of God Amen not
[17:10] not not in the Catholic church or not in
[17:12] this he says but what in the word of God
[17:14] that's where we're to reason what with
[17:16] the Holy scriptures with the absolute
[17:18] with the infallible word of God the
[17:20] Bible uh that God has written now notice
[17:23] also in the memory realm what we want to
[17:25] notice that what as David that David's
[17:27] going against that Philistine his in his
[17:29] memory God used his memory at that time
[17:32] and brought it back to all the creatures
[17:35] that bear in that line that what he had
[17:37] he had conquered already and he said he
[17:39] said if God can do it bringing you God
[17:41] was harnessing in memory right and says
[17:43] look I've already done this back there
[17:45] seting what's before me can go down as
[17:48] well amen and then of course the
[17:50] affection now remember David in that
[17:52] same spot he he he loved what the Sheep
[17:55] of God his his father's sheepo he loved
[17:58] he wanted to protect the
[17:59] Sheepfold and in that he said I love my
[18:02] father so much I want to protect his
[18:04] flock and he went and slew that bear and
[18:07] that lion and then here now before that
[18:09] when that giant came up then he saw what
[18:12] what David loved what the people of God
[18:14] as well remember if he had a shepherd's
[18:17] heart he he he he wanted to protect and
[18:20] I love it SS and sounds David again I
[18:22] have to bring that up again uh just I
[18:24] love how how that the mother there was
[18:26] singing said he say Jus and you can't
[18:28] she says you can't lose
[18:30] one that was trained and trained what in
[18:33] the mind of David by Hallelujah
[18:35] supposedly his mother uh that what he's
[18:38] got to defend these Sheep amen praise
[18:40] God and then when here now we see that
[18:42] Goliath rise up David now by the love he
[18:45] says he says I don't want any of my
[18:47] brothers to die he I believe I'm
[18:49] anointed I'm the one that's going to
[18:51] take on that giant and that Giants got
[18:53] to fall why because he didn't want
[18:55] anyone else to fight he didn't want
[18:56] anyone else want to go down what he had
[18:58] his affections were for Israel his
[19:00] affections were what for the king his
[19:02] affections were to prove that God was
[19:04] the almighty God that what he was to
[19:06] conquer amen he can defeat anything and
[19:08] anyone at any time amen so all of these
[19:11] things what can be harnessed by God what
[19:14] for his kingdom what in you praise the
[19:16] Lord yes absolutely and that's what we
[19:19] want to be mindful of today what is all
[19:22] these things right here this is the
[19:23] Battleground right
[19:25] here now notice this depending on how
[19:28] the devil t attacks now remember he can
[19:30] attack from all kinds of Realms he can
[19:32] attack on your flesh and when he attacks
[19:35] your flesh in certain kinds away through
[19:37] lust or Temptation or sickness or
[19:39] disease those sort of things these these
[19:41] trials right here that affect your flesh
[19:43] can impact this that's right yes sir and
[19:46] if he can't get you there to doubt the
[19:49] word of God In the Flesh he'll attack
[19:51] your spirit realm to what to attack
[19:53] these things and a lot of these things
[19:55] are the if you go through and listen to
[19:56] the discernment lights and discernment
[19:58] discernment lines of brother brandham if
[20:00] you look at he said a lot of these
[20:02] physical things were because of this and
[20:04] here that's right brother yes sir yes
[20:05] sir oh you just got a nervous spirit and
[20:07] yet they were having stomach issues
[20:09] they're having physical ailments because
[20:11] of the nervousness of what the time what
[20:14] he said it was a neurotic age amen SS of
[20:16] God everyone knows we're at the End Amen
[20:18] sure just talk to someone on the job
[20:20] site they're prepping with this and
[20:21] they're prepping with that and saints of
[20:22] God they are getting nervous they see
[20:24] this they see that they comeing why is
[20:26] Israel why is Russia everything's what
[20:28] we have two Wars now right now just
[20:30] smoldering yes if you could see if we
[20:34] had ability to see right here we just
[20:35] see the smoke from uh Ukraine and Russia
[20:38] we see the smoke in Israel those areas
[20:41] we just see this the burning the burning
[20:43] but SS of God this thing's going to
[20:44] light one of these days we've want to be
[20:47] in in the word of God Amen now I haven't
[20:50] got very far now let's see
[20:53] here this is very important this quote
[20:55] is very very important because this goes
[20:58] right back to the the
[20:59] scripture he says now our Eternal
[21:02] destination is not altogether determined
[21:04] by what we see and what we hear amen
[21:08] amen he says but it's determined by what
[21:11] discernment we have of what we see and
[21:14] what we hear in other words what the
[21:16] decision we make by what we see and hear
[21:19] the decision we make of how we feel on
[21:21] this or feel that s of God our decisions
[21:23] must come back to this word of God
[21:26] remember the Bible says what it'll be so
[21:28] close in this last days that'll be
[21:30] deceive the very elected right he says
[21:33] but what so we can't go by what our
[21:34] thoughts by uh uh by our imaginations by
[21:37] any of those sort of things he says but
[21:39] we have to ask God for discernment on
[21:42] these things Lord what is right here
[21:44] Lord what is right here Lord God give me
[21:47] the answer what lot times when we need
[21:48] to fast and pray but sweat it out just
[21:51] like the prophet did we got to what
[21:53] sweat these things out SS of God until
[21:55] we can say here it is thus sayth the
[21:56] Lord right in the scripture amen now
[21:59] notice now notice what was the danger
[22:01] here he says what now notice he says how
[22:04] if you see your brother off off the word
[22:07] if you see your sister off the word yes
[22:10] do we forget that they are children of
[22:12] God do we forget that they have the same
[22:15] holy ghost that you have amen or do we
[22:18] do we forget that they are children of
[22:20] God Amen because remember the scripture
[22:23] says Paul was not disputing uh with them
[22:26] on from the communion their act was
[22:27] right but their discernment was wrong
[22:29] for the taking of the Lord's Supper is
[22:31] the Commandment of the Lord but to take
[22:33] it unworthily not Discerning the Lord's
[22:36] body right what does he say right here
[22:37] and the body of the Lord is the believer
[22:40] saints of God so in our thoughts no
[22:43] notice how do we discern thing in our
[22:45] thoughts yes right here in our mind our
[22:49] mind is always constantly thinking right
[22:51] now you are either thinking I'll say it
[22:53] like this a lot of times people don't
[22:55] get anything out of the service because
[22:57] what their minds are what somewhere else
[23:00] you could be sitting right there looking
[23:01] directly in my face going like this and
[23:04] yet your mind has went off and drifting
[23:06] off well you know tomorrow I've got to
[23:09] do so and so oh you know after service
[23:11] I'm G to go get some Chipotle or maybe
[23:13] I'll get some Mexican food sure
[23:15] absolutely some street tacos somewhere
[23:17] if I can find a little pull behind cart
[23:19] absolutely but SS of God we've got to
[23:20] what keep our mind focused on the word
[23:23] of God the house of God right here this
[23:26] house this gathering together is for
[23:28] nothing but what to seek the W the Lord
[23:31] to hear the word if you pull you'll hear
[23:34] from the word of God Amen you will hear
[23:36] from Heaven sure but sints of God to
[23:38] take you have to what get in the spirit
[23:40] of it amen if you go I'm sure brother

[23:57] helmets and all throwing footb balls and
[23:58] kicking footballs and tackling and
[24:00] dropping each other down and all sort of

[24:14] want more we want more right all those
[24:16] sort of things right sure what when they
[24:18] were getting in the spirit but if you
[24:19] take them to church they'll
[24:21] be that's right God Bless you that's
[24:25] right maybe they won't even say Amen
[24:29] maybe they won't even raise their hands
[24:31] saints of God remember we don't serve a
[24:33] football we just serve what the great
[24:35] the creator of heavens and earth amen

[25:32] sure bringing something home to eat
[25:34] bring bringing the cash flow home amen
[25:36] sure
[25:40] now like I said I want to speak on the
[25:43] power of your
[25:44] thoughts because this is going to this
[25:47] plays everything right
[25:50] here what brother say brother said he
[25:52] said he said he said if you want to uh
[25:55] he says the right mental attitude for
[25:58] any promise of God he say will produce
[26:00] it I'm s PR paraphrasing but if you can
[26:02] get that right mental attitude what you
[26:04] talking about in the
[26:05] thoughts if you thinking it's going to
[26:08] take place it will s to God what is
[26:10] faith believing already knowing what is
[26:13] going to take place amen when you when
[26:16] you have a need in your life you say
[26:18] what if I get sick I'm already healed
[26:20] amen I just got to wait this thing out
[26:22] but what I'm already healed sure
[26:24] absolutely now look at
[26:27] this here's the Wicked Man the wicked
[26:30] through the pride of his countenance
[26:31] will not seek after God I'll say like
[26:33] this SS Godot when I hit the bar B of my
[26:35] Barrel in
[26:38] life
[26:40] in the
[26:42] spring I think actually I hit the bottom
[26:45] Barrel the spring of
[26:48] 99 and I was sitting in a certain kind
[26:50] of bar with two of my fraternity
[26:53] Brothers I'm sitting there I lost so
[26:55] much already in my life and what I
[26:57] thought was very very important very
[26:59] essential in my life all my plans all my
[27:01] and I one here one here and I said guys
[27:04] this is the lowest I ever
[27:06] been and what they do they laughed right
[27:08] in my
[27:09] face and I'm sitting there drinking my
[27:11] beer and I'm like wow good
[27:15] buddies and at that point SS of God I
[27:17] had to make a
[27:19] decision am I going to continue on with
[27:22] these two guys who I'm at the least the
[27:24] lowest in my spot and they don't even
[27:26] care
[27:29] or do I have to go with something
[27:31] else I realize in my life I can't
[27:34] control one thing there's not one thing
[27:37] I have full control over not a
[27:39] thing you can't even control your
[27:41] emotions half the
[27:43] time someone cuts you off in the in the
[27:45] traffic or someone does this or this you
[27:47] get so there's like a little fire that
[27:49] burns up and you're like that guy I
[27:50] can't believe wait a second I got to
[27:52] control that because how do we know what
[27:55] that man went through or that woman went
[27:57] through this morning that made him cut
[27:58] you off maybe they're running behind a
[28:00] work maybe they just got this or that
[28:01] maybe their husband did this or their
[28:03] wife did that and their children were
[28:04] out of all ra SS of God give Grace to
[28:09] everyone and
[28:11] especially give grace to the body of
[28:14] Jesus Christ Hallelujah because if you
[28:17] don't and you take that
[28:19] communion things take place sickness
[28:21] hits death hits that's right sickness
[28:25] hits and death hits because you do not
[28:28] discern who you're dealing with yes sir
[28:31] thank to God you we've become too common
[28:33] to
[28:34] ourselves have you been too do you
[28:37] understand who you are and who your
[28:39] brother and sister are do you understand
[28:41] that you are we in that time of the
[28:44] Rapture when we go up by the grace of
[28:46] God you're going to look at one another
[28:48] I'll see brother amen and brother Jesse
[28:49] and all the brother Arley all these all
[28:51] these all the sisters right here what be
[28:52] look it's like oh my goodness why we're
[28:55] going to have a lot of regrets but we
[28:57] want we've got to get those things under
[28:59] the blood right now make sure that your
[29:02] thoughts are just pure towards your
[29:04] brothers and sisters make sure there is
[29:06] no root of bitterness not one thing you
[29:08] can say listen this SS of God and the
[29:10] devil may be showing you many many
[29:12] things about your brother and sister
[29:14] that you you have a lot of ammo on right
[29:18] but you keep that to yourself
[29:20] amen yes sir what's that man you can
[29:24] talk about me as long as as much as you
[29:27] please but I'll talk about you when I'm
[29:30] down on my
[29:31] KNE you just talk to the Lord Jesus
[29:34] Christ you go to the great father if you
[29:37] see one of the father's Sons out of line
[29:39] say Lord Jesus help them
[29:42] Lord and I believe the Lord will honor
[29:44] your
[29:46] prayer look at look at David and Saul
[29:48] Saul's David oh the son of Jesse the son
[29:51] of Jesse he's always this this but if
[29:53] you look at David said don't hurt God's
[29:55] anointed do not do one thing against
[29:57] God's anointed
[29:58] and are you the anointed of God
[30:00] absolutely you have to be anointed to
[30:02] hear this word you have to be anointed
[30:04] to be sitting here this morning saints
[30:06] of God you are the bride of Christ amen
[30:08] you are the one chosen to hear elected
[30:11] to hear this word amen sure now notice
[30:14] now know the wicked said he says though
[30:16] the the wicked though through the pride
[30:18] of his countenance will not seek after
[30:20] God how come the saints of God when you
[30:22] need help when something goes wrong in
[30:24] your life what the first thing you do is
[30:25] say Lord God you sayl Lord what did I do
[30:28] you what you know you know where the
[30:30] problem can stem from you know the
[30:32] things that what a lot of times we reap
[30:34] what we've
[30:35] sown so make sure you sow only good seed
[30:39] amen what speak good things do good
[30:42] things do good works amen praise God all
[30:44] the time and be exous Lord for his
[30:46] kingdom amen yes he says look he says
[30:49] but God is not in all of his thoughts
[30:52] doesn't say some he says but God he says
[30:55] God is not in all his thoughts it might
[30:57] be in some
[30:58] might be in a quarter of them maybe a
[31:00] tenth maybe even 75% what because now
[31:03] we're dealing what religious what's the
[31:05] most wicked one right there is one that
[31:07] seems religious not the Heathen it's
[31:09] what the Judas is it's the ones of false
[31:11] Believers those are the most wicked
[31:13] right there because they're pretending
[31:14] to be something that they're not amen he
[31:16] says but God is not in all their
[31:18] thoughts SS of God that's why we got to
[31:20] weigh all of our
[31:23] ways that's but the scripture talks
[31:25] about thoughts and intents
[31:29] yes thoughts remember the intents lie
[31:31] within the
[31:33] thoughts why would I do let's say you're
[31:36] going through life and something takes
[31:38] place and you have to make a decision
[31:40] let's say there's two people to help
[31:42] someone both asking for money at the
[31:44] exact same time and now we need what a
[31:46] discernment who really needs it more am
[31:49] I going to help the one that's nicer
[31:50] dressed or let's say there's a man and a
[31:52] woman am I going to help the woman
[31:53] because I'm a man and trying to bring
[31:54] influence or you know you know what I'm
[31:56] saying carnal nature carnal things but
[31:58] we've got to find the mind of God on
[32:00] these
[32:01] things remember what we see is not
[32:05] real what we think and say like this in
[32:08] ourselves is not real this is the only
[32:11] real
[32:15] thing let every man let every man be a
[32:18] liar but God's word be true
[32:24] see there's a brother just uh a little
[32:26] bit ago he said brother Simon he goes I
[32:28] was ready to just quit being a Christian
[32:30] this this but you could not tell it by
[32:32] his
[32:33] Covenant I saw him he was smiling he
[32:35] this give me the big hug and this and
[32:37] that he was just ready to
[32:39] quit he was the last person in my mind
[32:42] that I thought was battling but guess
[32:44] what he said brother goes yesterday I
[32:45] was about ready to quit he says but
[32:46] today he said God gave me
[32:50] strength see just because someone looks
[32:53] like they're oh they're the superch
[32:54] Christian they got the anointing there
[32:55] they feel great man this guy this
[32:56] brother's never down sints of God you
[32:58] better pray for everyone pray for the
[33:01] one you wouldn't even think to pray for
[33:03] pray for it say God lord who should I
[33:05] pray for today because you'll the
[33:06] thoughts will come into your mind like
[33:08] who you're like what pray for that one
[33:11] that brother that sister
[33:14] Hallelujah a lot of people show it on
[33:17] their face but some people don't show it
[33:19] on their
[33:21] face amen now let's continue here I love
[33:25] this David giving his advice to Solomon
[33:29] he says now Solomon son my son he says
[33:31] know thou the god of thy father and
[33:33] serve him with a perfect heart he says
[33:35] and with a willing mind and the Lord
[33:37] searches All Hearts every heart is
[33:40] searched here this
[33:42] morning all of our hearts God searches
[33:46] he's here right now the Bible say where
[33:47] two or three in the midst here I am in
[33:48] the midst right amen amen yes he's
[33:50] walking these aisles right now he's
[33:52] where wherever he's at I can't see I'm
[33:54] not I'm not a prophet I don't see the
[33:55] pill of fire walking and this that the
[33:56] light he's but is checking the very
[33:58] thoughts and intents of our hearts right
[34:00] now
[34:02] Hallelujah everything is weighed every
[34:05] motive every move the way you approach
[34:09] this person the way you approach this
[34:11] person God knows your motives but the
[34:13] things the saints of God we just have to
[34:14] have good
[34:16] motives the reason when we make a
[34:18] decision is what because we want to see
[34:19] God glorified we want to see good things
[34:22] for our brother we want to see good
[34:23] things for our sister amen we want to
[34:25] encourage and lift up what an edify each
[34:27] one of them amen you want to and and
[34:29] Lord and brothers and sisters display
[34:32] yourself as a good good example be a
[34:34] good example Hallelujah by that you can
[34:37] conquer amen what that's that takes
[34:38] Divine love to do it sure he says and
[34:41] the Lord searches all the hearts and
[34:44] understandeth all the imagination of the
[34:46] thoughts if thou seek Him He will be
[34:48] found of thee he said but if thou
[34:49] forsake Him He Shall cast thee off
[34:53] forever he
[34:55] knows why why why are you being a
[34:58] Christian one of the most one of the
[35:00] recently brother Cam's been preaching uh
[35:03] well it probably three months ago it was
[35:05] beautiful in John
[35:07] 6 remember Jesus fed the thousands the 5
[35:09] thousands or how it was how many
[35:11] thousands with some fish and some loaves
[35:13] of bread Jesus saw they were tired and
[35:16] he said he said what do we have brothers
[35:18] he said we just have a couple Loaves and
[35:19] a fish and God said tell them every sit
[35:21] down he started praying over the food
[35:23] and he just started dividing it and he
[35:26] fed the entire congregation how how many
[35:27] baskets like 12 10 baskets however they
[35:29] pulled up there's two accounts I believe
[35:31] and they pulled up the baskets and
[35:32] Lord's just like look look at all we
[35:34] have left over remnants
[35:36] fragments and directly after that Jesus
[35:38] and his disciples depart and the Bible
[35:41] said that what God went across the the
[35:43] River or the
[35:44] Sea and the Bible says those people that
[35:47] were fed said where is Jesus we've got
[35:50] to go to him we've got to find him and
[35:53] they took ship as well and went oversea
[35:55] and they found him
[35:58] in on our minds we're like wow these
[36:00] guys are converts they're willing to
[36:02] cross Land and
[36:03] Sea to find Jesus wow look at that they
[36:06] that cost them money that cost them
[36:08] effort that cost them time they're
[36:10] putting their lives in Jeopardy because
[36:11] we know the Tempest of the wind and the
[36:13] Sea can come up and sink a ship just
[36:15] like that right but when they come in
[36:17] front of Jesus he discerned he knew
[36:19] their thoughts and intents of the heart
[36:21] they said what he he said what he says
[36:23] are art thou not here because of the
[36:24] food not because of the Miracles you're
[36:27] literally here because I fed
[36:29] you yes sir brother Cam's preaching that
[36:31] he said he are we here are we serving
[36:32] the lord Jesus Christ in this message
[36:34] for what material things for the
[36:35] blessings amen are we here just for the
[36:37] blessings of God the
[36:39] benefits
[36:41] right SS of
[36:44] God well let's say like this we all come
[36:46] out we had to sacrifice yes sir but
[36:49] saints of God it was for Christ and for
[36:51] his
[36:52] word we love the truth hallelujah than
[36:56] God there's nothing like being sure that
[36:58] this word is right there's nothing like
[37:00] seeing this run from Genesis to
[37:01] Revelations nothing like what seeing
[37:03] God's life come up out of us and break
[37:05] the bread of life to us and say oh my
[37:07] goodness I see it it's beautiful amen
[37:10] this is what I say this that's the only
[37:11] times a lot of times in your walk you
[37:13] don't even feel like a
[37:15] Christian you don't feel like man am I
[37:17] even a Christian man I just heard this
[37:20] rock and roll song I just heard this
[37:21] song I was playing back in the 90s I
[37:23] loved and I'm and I'm just like battling
[37:25] not to sing along or even to enter into
[37:27] that right or or you you or you hear a
[37:28] cuss word and that word just revolves
[37:30] around your head constantly all day long
[37:32] oh my goodness SS of God are we even
[37:34] Christians and then sometimes what we
[37:36] get to witness for like 10 minutes five
[37:39] minutes and SS of God in those five
[37:41] minutes you feel like this is where I am
[37:42] this is who I am right here this is re
[37:45] this is reality this is what I want to
[37:46] do all my life is what be an example be
[37:48] a witness for Jesus Christ amen
[37:50] hallelujah right praise the Lord yeah
[37:53] Glory he says so SS of God he says God
[37:56] understandeth all the imagination
[37:58] the understanding of the thoughts and
[38:00] intents look here it says for as he
[38:02] thinketh in his heart so is
[38:04] he who do you think you
[38:09] are you have to say I am by the grace of
[38:13] God the bride of Christ Hallelujah I
[38:17] believe that I am I was chosen I was
[38:19] elected when you heard baptism the truth
[38:23] on it when you heard the truth on
[38:24] godhead when you've seen signs one those
[38:26] miracles SS of God there had to be some
[38:28] spiritual Amnesia you start coming out
[38:30] of Amen even in John the Baptist what
[38:32] the Bible what the prophet the Bible
[38:34] says what his eyes got all waxed over
[38:37] and just just calloused up what because
[38:39] he he couldn't even see who Christ was
[38:41] anymore he was such in a bad spot Saints
[38:44] but he did not have the filling of the
[38:46] Holy Ghost now he had the Holy Ghost
[38:47] Anointed with him always but saints of
[38:49] God in that time he wack those eyes
[38:51] glazed over he could not recognize who
[38:54] he was SS of God but nonetheless he knew
[38:56] he was he just Di who Christ was Saints
[38:59] but saints of God you've got to know who
[39:01] you are amen and if you don't know
[39:03] believe until he reveals who you are SS
[39:06] of God he will show you it'll be shown
[39:09] right in the scripture yes Hallelujah
[39:11] when you hear the word of God something
[39:12] inside you says amen that's right when
[39:15] you know it's right amen absolutely sure
[39:18] yes
[39:19] absolutely if you think you're the
[39:21] weakest Christian that's what you'll
[39:24] be if you think well I'm almost as good
[39:27] as say uh sisters there you know
[39:28] sister's such a light in the church and
[39:30] this and that I'm almost as good as her
[39:32] then you'll you'll be almost as good as
[39:37] her but if you catch the mind that I am
[39:40] mrss Jesus Christ that I I am going to
[39:44] be and am right now because think about
[39:47] the mind of God are you the bride of
[39:49] Christ now or what back in the
[39:52] Rapture in the future Rapture you're the
[39:54] bride of Christ right now that's right
[39:56] because remember in the mind of God when
[39:58] it was revealed to John what he was
[40:00] already he God had already judged Leo
[40:02] deia he said there would already be
[40:04] Overcomers there's going to be
[40:06] Overcomers in this age why because
[40:08] almost 2,000 years ago Christ said there
[40:10] was Overcomers that means you have to
[40:12] find yourself that you are an overcomer
[40:14] this morning amen if you are Overcomer
[40:17] then then you are right there that's
[40:18] what you'll be right if you believe
[40:22] you're going to be an Ephesian that's
[40:24] what you're going to be whatever you
[40:27] think you are is what you'll be so
[40:28] saints of God elevate your minds elevate
[40:31] your thoughts this morning realize that
[40:33] God has called you and chos in you what
[40:36] to not only not only receive the word
[40:38] but receive his spirit and not only
[40:41] receive his Spirit but SS of god what
[40:43] have his Spirit work and build the full
[40:45] stature of a man in you you will reach
[40:49] all of it SS of God you will be the
[40:51] Pinnacle amen the Bible says in Psalms
[40:54] he says sorry in Song of Solomon he says
[40:56] he says daughters have done virtuously
[40:59] he says but thou excelth them all saints
[41:02] of God who was that for that was what
[41:03] for the bride in this last day
[41:08] amen all the other Ages were coming to
[41:11] what we were they were all they were all
[41:12] building to this Prophet God said the
[41:14] only reason they didn't get it is
[41:15] because they couldn't live long enough
[41:16] that's right that's right if Luther
[41:18] would to Liv 500 years he'd be here
[41:21] right
[41:21] now if Wesley would to lived 500 years
[41:24] they'd be here right now
[41:27] why because they had the Revelation they
[41:29] caught the Revelation for their day and
[41:31] they would I guarantee you because
[41:33] that's scriptural they would have walked
[41:35] from light to light to light amen from
[41:38] Faith to Faith from glory to glory SS of
[41:40] God they would have been here today amen
[41:43] huah absolutely sure why because on
[41:46] Rapture Day they'll be
[41:47] there they just catch up they all slow
[41:51] down we'll speed up here we are God
[41:54] bless you brother
[41:55] amen yes sir
[41:59] amen now I'm getting to some things here
[42:02] wow we got a long way to go I'm already
[42:03] 38 minutes in you guys all right every
[42:05] we all okay all right praise the Lord
[42:07] now he says the thoughts of the
[42:09] righteous are right he says but the
[42:11] counsels of the wicked are
[42:14] deceit so if you're righteous your
[42:17] thoughts our thoughts as we continue to
[42:20] grow in God our thoughts should be more
[42:22] and more lining up with the word of God
[42:26] yes our our wills and desires should be
[42:31] lessening yes well I've got this and
[42:33] I've got this plan I'm remember that
[42:34] Rich Young Ruler he said want to be
[42:36] bilder bigger Barns and build bigger
[42:37] this and this what to increase all his
[42:39] saints of God that's not the that's not
[42:40] the mind of God in this age right what
[42:43] the mind of God in this age is L what is
[42:44] is John the Baptist was the perfect
[42:45] example he says he says I must decrease
[42:47] but he must
[42:49] increase do you want to see an increase
[42:51] in the spirit of God in your life this
[42:53] year coming up absolutely saints of God
[42:56] we need more of him amen we're not like
[42:59] those that are blind and Leo DEA that
[43:01] think we've got it all figured out in
[43:02] this the saints of God we're coming what
[43:05] we are in desperate need of a refilling
[43:07] amen we are in desperate need what of
[43:09] more of him we want more of him what
[43:11] what because in him is life amen and
[43:14] life more abundantly amen hallelujah
[43:17] would you rather have a million dollars
[43:20] or get a refilling of the Holy
[43:21] Ghost watch your thoughts in
[43:25] intense the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[43:27] ghost because there's nothing like
[43:30] it I said it here before my one of the
[43:32] guys I work with he's made some good
[43:34] money he said brother Simon he he didn't
[43:37] call me brother he Simon he goes I'm
[43:38] more miserable now than when before I
[43:40] had money he says because I'm always
[43:42] worrying about
[43:43] it but remember that's what it chokes
[43:46] out the cares of this life choke out
[43:49] choke out if your mind's always consumed
[43:51] about this thing so God he chokes it out
[43:53] now if the Lord blesses you financially
[43:55] fine that's great if not so be it what
[43:56] we're moving on
[43:58] anyhow we are moving on what because I I
[44:02] I I like this I I love these
[44:07] Revelations ask my wife I go to any
[44:09] Bible study I can I will teach the same
[44:11] things over and over to new Believers
[44:13] and over and over and over why because I
[44:16] think these are the most valuable things
[44:17] I can give
[44:18] them these Revelations are you kidding
[44:21] me to know the to you know SS of God it
[44:24] comes to the you have the Revelation
[44:26] that there's an evil Spirit Satan is
[44:28] watering and how does he do it what
[44:31] through thoughts false doctrines all
[44:34] these sort of things what through the
[44:35] great Babylon but SS of God we
[44:37] have the
[44:38] answers yes we know what's truth and
[44:41] what's wrong and we can show we can
[44:43] introduce what what what we do in a
[44:45] Bible study what we do in a service what
[44:46] we're introducing truth to the people
[44:49] and now they have to make a choice and
[44:51] where they make that choice in their
[44:53] hearts their thoughts
[44:59] absolutely did some good witnessing this
[45:01] week hit some things with a gentleman
[45:04] and he's very quiet on things no not
[45:06] much response but tell you what the
[45:08] ball's in his court
[45:09] now Hallelujah now he's got to make a
[45:12] decision
[45:14] amen Proverbs 1533 35 or Proverbs 1525
[45:19] he says the Lord will destroy the house
[45:21] of The Proud but he will establish the
[45:23] border of the
[45:24] Widow he says the thoughts of the wicked
[45:27] are an Abomination to the Lord he says
[45:29] but the words of of the pure are
[45:32] pleasant
[45:36] words thoughts notice the fals have
[45:39] thoughts that are completely wrong and
[45:41] then the the what the righteous have the
[45:43] right words to say
[45:46] hallelujah now here's the here's the
[45:48] danger and and we all battle this I mean
[45:51] I'm I do we all battle but the D the
[45:53] danger of a hypocrite is what to think
[45:55] one thing one way
[45:57] but then when you say something it's AB
[46:00] contrary to what you're
[46:03] thinking right your affections toward a
[46:06] brother or sister are not where it
[46:08] should be and yet when you confront them
[46:10] you're like
[46:13] oh that's
[46:16] dangerous because sints of God our
[46:18] mouths brother said don't ever be a
[46:20] hypocrite
[46:21] right he said I I respect he said I
[46:24] respect the man in the bar drink until
[46:26] he gets drunk what because he's who he
[46:28] is and he's not ashamed of what he's
[46:29] doing amen why because that's what's in
[46:32] him that's what he is that's who he is
[46:34] but s to God as Christians SS of God we
[46:36] must be what Who We Are Who the word
[46:38] says we are we should be who our
[46:40] thoughts and hearts say we are amenallah
[46:42] yes that's exactly right
[46:45] sure yes absolutely the thoughts of the
[46:48] wicked are an Abomination to the Lord
[46:50] but the words of the pure are pleasant
[46:52] words
[46:54] sure we are wow so let me let me let me
[46:57] speed up here by the grace of
[47:00] God I want to show you
[47:03] something look what brother Ram says
[47:05] here he says the Eternal thoughts of God
[47:09] he says let me ask you are the thoughts
[47:11] of God Eternal if you can see this you
[47:14] will see many things he says God is
[47:17] unchangeable in both Essence and
[47:19] behavior he says we have studied that he
[47:22] says and proven that already God is
[47:24] infinite in his abilities so therefore
[47:26] he is God he said uh he must be
[47:28] omniscient if he is omniscient then he's
[47:30] not now learning anything nor is uh is
[47:33] he taking counsel even with himself nor
[47:36] is he at any time adding to his
[47:37] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[47:40] then he is not omniscient the best we
[47:42] could say that is sometime he will be he
[47:44] says but that is anything
[47:46] because he says but that is not
[47:48] scriptural he is omnicient he has never
[47:51] had a new thought about anything about
[47:53] his thoughts amen he has always had and
[47:56] always will have and knows the end from
[47:58] the beginning because he is God thus the
[48:01] thoughts of God are Eternal he says and
[48:03] they are real
[48:05] Hallelujah yes sir why are you
[48:10] here that's that you know for the first
[48:13] time in like 20 years I finally brother
[48:14] Ram brother Ram said he says he says I
[48:16] think the natural birth he says
[48:18] conception is more mysterious than
[48:20] Jesus's
[48:21] birth and this year the Revelation truly
[48:24] struck because you have all these J was
[48:26] going after that egg and all of a sudden
[48:28] this one is just there he is yeah God is
[48:31] literally
[48:33] handpicking yes you he handpicked
[48:36] you right he's the great scientist a lot
[48:40] of people you know they have these
[48:41] movies about mad scientists God's right
[48:43] here handpicking in each individual why
[48:45] are you here because God CHS you to be
[48:48] here you have a purpose and if his
[48:52] thoughts are real what does that make
[48:55] you amen say God you are a real son and
[48:58] daughter of God Amen this ain't make
[49:00] believe you God the Bible says what and
[49:02] Adam and and uh and uh ad of Seth was

[49:18] father yes sir he is your
[49:22] dad he's the one that brought you forth
[49:26] you have a SE seed within you and God
[49:28] placed that seed within you and made
[49:30] sure than to God that's that's the
[49:32] beautiful thing he like look at our
[49:36] parents and I you know I'm sure Bill
[49:39] Jesse shared some things but I don't
[49:40] know how my mom and dad ever fell in
[49:42] love I have no idea that worked but
[49:45] guess what it was
[49:47] ordained he was mixing Ruby Smith with
[49:52] snooky Smith Ruby garer with snooky
[49:54] Smith to what make what he wanted to
[49:55] make out of each one of them that's
[49:57] right each one of you was handpicked
[50:00] designed it may not have come the way
[50:02] you thought it should come but here you
[50:07] are
[50:10] amenl he said they are real they're not
[50:13] simply like a man with a blueprint that
[50:15] he's drawn up which one day will be
[50:17] translated to substance and form he said
[50:18] but they are already he said they are
[50:20] already real and eternal part of
[50:24] God you are the E eternal
[50:27] thought of God
[50:29] than hlu brother I I'm so sinful that's

[51:11] grace let me hit this right here look at
[51:13] this here Jeremiah
[51:15] 29:10 for thus sayi the Lord God that

[51:22] Cam's been on this lately you know
[51:24] everything's hinging on Babylon that
[51:26] Temple right
[51:27] now everything's hinging on that when we
[51:31] see God starting turn back to the Jews
[51:34] and something that that Temple movement
[51:36] because here it was back in the Old
[51:37] Testament if it's in the new it's the
[51:39] same
[51:41] way look what he says he says for I know
[51:44] the thoughts that I have that I think
[51:46] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[51:49] Peace he says not of evil to give you an
[51:52] expected endj
[51:57] well brother sa we have a squeeze to go
[51:58] through we have all this SS of God these
[52:01] he has good thoughts for
[52:02] you SS of God what if what if what if
[52:05] the three Hebrew boys would all would
[52:07] have been praying and the Lord opened
[52:09] their three eyes and gave him a vision
[52:10] of them being just about being thrown
[52:12] leg in the the the fire
[52:15] furnace like Lord please don't do it but
[52:18] if God would have continued to play that
[52:21] vision and they would have saw him in
[52:22] the midst they'd been like let's do
[52:25] it let's get let's go he's going to be
[52:28] there but saints of God see that well
[52:30] how how does that compare to
[52:32] this I have I have good thoughts towards
[52:35] you but in the midst of a circumstance
[52:38] it can look impossible it can look like
[52:40] you're staring what right in the shadow
[52:42] of death you can look right into Satan's
[52:44] eyes and say how I you do this but Lord
[52:46] but the Lord's right there he had an
[52:48] expected end where did those three
[52:49] Hebrew boys become a martyr they
[52:52] didn't where did Daniel become a martyr
[52:54] oh my goodness what God has what in the
[52:56] expected and for them saints amen and
[52:58] saints of God in this day there is not
[53:01] something there's something promised for
[53:02] us it's the Rapture it's the body change
[53:05] we have great promises yes
[53:09] sir what what the Bible the Bible said
[53:11] what Jesus said what it it'll be like
[53:13] Noah's day and lot lot's day the worst
[53:16] days on the face of the Earth
[53:18] combined and yet we have a rapture we
[53:21] have a body change when we when we catch
[53:24] that body that that that uh like this
[53:27] that rapturing faith when we catch that
[53:29] it'll all be worth it yes sir everything
[53:32] we have to go through from this point to
[53:34] before that Rapture will be worth it
[53:36] Hallelujah every single
[53:39] thing and then we move into eternity
[53:42] those things won't even be in our mind
[53:44] anymore we have arrived we can say I am
[53:48] just like our Lord and savior he is he I
[53:51] am too amen praise be to God what
[53:53] because now we are here existing forever
[53:54] with our Lord and savior amen amen hallu
[53:57] yes Lord amen that kind of Oneness now
[54:00] they were entering into a Oneness with
[54:02] him amen sure yes now look at
[54:05] this this quote here voices of many
[54:09] Waters fourth per P personage of him
[54:12] voice to many Waters how are you going
[54:14] to do it when it's recorded in glory
[54:16] when The Voice tonight is recorded he
[54:18] says your voice is recorded your
[54:20] thoughts are recorded as a man thinketh
[54:22] in his heart so is he notice your
[54:24] thought your voice is louder in heaven
[54:25] than I mean your thoughts are louder in
[54:27] heaven than your vo is on Earth
[54:30] certainly it is God knows the thoughts
[54:31] and intents of the heart he knows all
[54:33] about it yes what he say he says your
[54:36] thoughts are louder in heaven like I
[54:40] said before if you shake a Brother's
[54:41] hand sister's hand you still got
[54:43] something against them there's something
[54:45] there and you say oh and the out word
[54:46] looks like oh but God knows your
[54:48] thoughts are
[54:50] speaking the very things you're thinking
[54:53] are louder in heaven yes see that's
[54:56] where you comes to a service and you say
[54:58] well this brother isn't preaching what I
[55:00] wanted to preach today this thanks of
[55:01] God is not up to us yes this ain't have
[55:04] it your own way this ain't what you know
[55:06] I like this when you go to church and
[55:07] you think you're not hearing what you
[55:09] think you should be hearing you need to
[55:13] repent yes sir I say this when I go to
[55:15] church and I'm sitting in these seats or
[55:17] I'm sitting in these seats and I'm I'm
[55:18] saying Lord whatever you have for me is
[55:20] what I
[55:22] want you think I'm scared to get blasted
[55:25] I've been yelled by people my boss right
[55:27] in my face loud as can be you know what
[55:29] I took all of it and you take it all
[55:32] rebuke rebuke reprove long suffering and
[55:35] then something sometimes a lot of things
[55:36] edifying absolutely things I like
[55:38] sometimes God will give you hard things
[55:39] and it'll throw another a fresh
[55:41] Revelation which is what spiritual
[55:42] stimulation and man it just makes
[55:44] everything feel good
[55:48] Hallelujah and why would brother Bram
[55:50] say this your thoughts are recorded in
[55:53] heaven are
[55:54] louder like what he says
[55:57] here he say God's omn presence knows
[56:00] what you're doing even your thoughts one
[56:03] time when I was on a vision I was
[56:05] speaking to a being standing by me you
[56:09] know who told him
[56:10] that you know who told him that an
[56:14] angel and he said back he said your
[56:17] thoughts are louder in heaven than your
[56:19] voice is on the
[56:22] earth that's what the angel of God told
[56:25] Brother Bri
[56:26] good brother good that's why he kept
[56:29] repeating it because what he did not
[56:31] know that that was only given to what to
[56:34] this
[56:35] age the thoughts are louder in heaven
[56:38] what you think right now if I be quiet
[56:41] right
[56:43] now you are thinking
[56:46] something are you thinking about out
[56:48] there you thinking about what next are
[56:50] you thinking what God's going to do for
[56:51] you what are you thinking your thoughts
[56:54] right now are being recorded in heaven
[56:56] you can be completely silent for the
[56:58] next two days let's say let's say you go
[57:00] on a fast with no food what if you go a
[57:02] fast with no
[57:03] talking everything is still being
[57:06] recorded every thought every action even
[57:10] your action see that's why it's so
[57:12] dangerous in this
[57:14] hour look at the Bible says curse not
[57:17] the king nor in thy thought he says and
[57:21] curse not the rich in thy bed chamber
[57:23] for the bird of the air shall carry The
[57:25] Voice and that which hath Wings will
[57:27] tell the matter SS of God always think
[57:29] good things about everybody think the
[57:31] best things you can always be
[57:33] encouraging always saints of
[57:36] God it's being recorded every we forget
[57:38] a lot of times Everything's being
[57:42] recorded
[57:45] recorded all I have to do is put a phone
[57:47] up here put on record prop it up right
[57:50] here and you're being recorded the same
[57:52] thing that's happening
[57:54] already why do you think the television
[57:57] tape and movie all that was so so
[57:59] powerful because what it shows that
[58:00] things are
[58:03] recorded I met a bodyguard to uh a
[58:08] president for two terms and the next
[58:10] president for one term and he told me he
[58:13] said Simon he goes of course I was ask
[58:15] him every question I could think
[58:17] of because I'm that kind of guy I like
[58:20] to know some deeper things if I'm gonna
[58:23] ask God some deep things I can ask guy
[58:25] some deep things too
[58:27] that's just how he built me I'd like to
[58:30] know the mysterious things right isn't
[58:31] that Deuteronomy 29:29 sure absolutely
[58:33] now but he told me he said Simon he goes
[58:35] when you're in the white house he said
[58:37] no matter where you're at and he like
[58:39] literally emphasized no matter where
[58:42] you're at everything is recorded in that
[58:45] white house you are not private he said
[58:49] anywhere
[58:53] emphasis and we're we're not private
[58:57] anywhere anyhow that's why David had he
[58:59] said Lord he's even even even get these
[59:01] secret sins out anything even I don't
[59:04] even know about get all these secret
[59:05] everything out of me amen deliver me all
[59:07] oh God burn it all send that Holy Ghost
[59:09] with what baptism of fire to burn out
[59:12] anything that's not pleasing to him amen
[59:15] now let's continue on here now here's
[59:18] what I thought here's what I saw in uh
[59:19] in science if we can harness
[59:23] this so what during during the work with
[59:26] during the even later today and all
[59:28] through that what are we supposed to be
[59:29] thinking
[59:31] on what are our thoughts supposed to be
[59:34] here's here's a
[59:36] law it's called The Law of constructive
[59:40] interference or destructive
[59:42] interference these are
[59:47] waves see these
[59:51] waves and then look at the results here
[59:55] if the waves
[59:56] are the exact same
[59:58] frequency and they're not contrary but
[1:00:01] they hit perfect it amplifies the
[1:00:07] effect but if your thoughts and God's
[1:00:11] thoughts or God's word are at different
[1:00:17] frequencies it makes God the word of God
[1:00:21] unff see what Creeds and dogas do to
[1:00:24] God's word
[1:00:27] that's why we have to take everything
[1:00:29] back to the Bible if we can take all of
[1:00:31] our beliefs back to the word of
[1:00:33] godj do you see this look at this and
[1:00:36] they they the examples right here you go
[1:00:38] out to a completely still calm water
[1:00:40] body body water a pond Lake whatever and
[1:00:42] there's like no ripples nothing you take
[1:00:44] two rocks try to pick the same size and
[1:00:47] you drop them certain spots right across
[1:00:49] drop them the same time if they hit the
[1:00:51] exact same time same size he says once
[1:00:53] those ripples meet they'll go bigger and
[1:00:55] smaller smaller they'll have bigger tops
[1:00:57] and lower bottoms because what they hit
[1:01:00] frequency they hit the what uh uh
[1:01:02] continuity they hit what synchronization
[1:01:04] or the same thing they join they hit
[1:01:07] perfectly together and it amplifies what
[1:01:09] they
[1:01:12] are what's going to produce the third
[1:01:16] pole this or
[1:01:19] this
[1:01:21] Joshua the sun was going down and his
[1:01:24] Mighty Warriors his mighty battle were
[1:01:26] they were winning the
[1:01:29] battle in God saw in the mind of a God
[1:01:33] he knew they had need of
[1:01:36] light God said he said destroy them he
[1:01:40] how they going to do it in the dark God
[1:01:42] knew those things as soon as the thought
[1:01:46] came to Joshua that thought and God's
[1:01:49] thought connected and he spoke it out
[1:01:52] and look what take place SS of God do
[1:01:54] you see what this is
[1:01:57] brother BR coming down there's a
[1:01:58] snowstorm coming he's heading down the
[1:02:00] mountain and he hears a voice he hears a
[1:02:02] voice notice now look how patient God is
[1:02:05] he hears a voes turn around he's like oh
[1:02:07] he keeps going he hears it again turn
[1:02:09] around he turns around he's like what is
[1:02:10] this and God gives him
[1:02:13] time he kept this he kept this frequency
[1:02:16] right there just waiting he knew he was
[1:02:19] going to say it but he had to wait for
[1:02:21] it he had Grace he's what training his
[1:02:24] Prophet he's training his son and that
[1:02:28] that frequency was still there that word
[1:02:30] was still there waiting now he didn't
[1:02:31] come and go God waited for it he said
[1:02:34] Lord is that you lord said yeah he said
[1:02:37] go back into
[1:02:39] that he's like why he says well he said
[1:02:42] he just speak what you want and God
[1:02:45] waited for that he waited and brother R
[1:02:47] said he says I want this storm blizzard
[1:02:49] gone for three days I want to be
[1:02:51] sunshiny clear this is and in half an
[1:02:53] hour it took
[1:02:54] place but God was training his Prophet
[1:02:57] what to catch the word of God so what
[1:02:59] the prophet God could enter in and say
[1:03:01] the exact same thing that his that God
[1:03:05] said if we can harness this if we can
[1:03:08] latch on to this power this is third
[1:03:11] pole what was that that was third pole
[1:03:13] controlling what what was the second
[1:03:15] Adam doing what was the second Adam was
[1:03:16] demonstrating what that he could control
[1:03:19] nature they we are the sons of God we
[1:03:23] will be manifested once again but we've
[1:03:25] got they catch the mind of God and what
[1:03:28] speak the exact same thing that God
[1:03:30] impresses or gives an unction of the
[1:03:32] Holy Ghost yes
[1:03:35] Hallelujah I'll say like this in your
[1:03:37] IND each individual situation you're
[1:03:40] going through
[1:03:41] something whether it be small big
[1:03:44] Financial marital whatever religious
[1:03:47] what what you're all going through
[1:03:49] something but if we can go back in here
[1:03:51] in the Bible and find a scripture that
[1:03:54] has something to do with your life and
[1:03:57] you can find something to do with the
[1:03:58] problem you're dealing with and just
[1:04:00] start speaking that scripture out
[1:04:02] because remember does God want you to
[1:04:03] stay in that in that position or does he
[1:04:05] want you to be an overcomer he's God's
[1:04:07] mind says he wants you to be an
[1:04:09] overcomer amen he wants you to conquer
[1:04:11] all things so in this sort of things
[1:04:14] than of God if we start repeating the
[1:04:15] very scriptures he gave us the promises
[1:04:18] he gave us what that we that's one of
[1:04:20] these times when you say it it's going
[1:04:21] to strike it's going to be made
[1:04:24] manifest Glory just speak the word not
[1:04:29] in Hope because this isn't hope this is
[1:04:31] Faith this is the real this is
[1:04:34] real do you think there's going to be
[1:04:36] any books but the Bible in the
[1:04:41] Millennium really yeah it's going to be
[1:04:44] the word of God that's it everything
[1:04:46] else is going to be
[1:04:50] burned because this is this is the
[1:04:53] book that's his Eternal Word amen now
[1:04:57] let's continue I'll say this this is so
[1:04:59] powerful with good and with
[1:05:03] bad what took place right here they were
[1:05:06] in such one
[1:05:09] Accord he says in the whole earth was
[1:05:12] one language and of one speech they were
[1:05:16] all flowing at the same Antichrist
[1:05:20] frequency in fact I'll say this why does
[1:05:22] the serpent move like
[1:05:24] this looks like a doesn't
[1:05:27] it I think brother Jesse did a didn't
[1:05:30] you do a study
[1:05:34] on the the movements of the snake didn't
[1:05:38] you do that there's like five or six
[1:05:40] different I remember it years ago you
[1:05:41] did it and what each one of them snakes
[1:05:43] have a different frequency they move
[1:05:46] by Brother Jose says yeah that's
[1:05:49] right so what he said what these got all
[1:05:51] on the same mindset same language they
[1:05:54] were all in one Accord look at the power
[1:05:56] of unity look at the power of unity for
[1:05:59] good or
[1:06:00] bad it got so strong that what he said
[1:06:03] they let us go make us build us a city
[1:06:05] and a tower whose top May reach unto
[1:06:07] heaven and let us make a name lest we be
[1:06:09] scattered upon the whole face of the
[1:06:11] Earth than of God sounds like the eunic
[1:06:13] World Council churches he said the Lord
[1:06:15] came down to see the city and Tower
[1:06:16] which was the children of men builded
[1:06:18] and the Lord said behold this people is
[1:06:21] one they're one they're literally one
[1:06:25] frequency
[1:06:26] wow good they're
[1:06:28] one they all believe the exact same
[1:06:32] thing they all had the same common goal
[1:06:37] and when they got into that state look
[1:06:40] what the Bible says he even God admitted
[1:06:43] this God said this that's the power of
[1:06:45] the unity of be what in one Accord just
[1:06:48] like what what took for place for the uh
[1:06:50] what what had to happen for the book of
[1:06:51] Acts to take place they all to be in one
[1:06:53] place and in one Accord Hallelujah yes
[1:06:55] sir yes sir you see you see that it's
[1:06:58] coming to Oneness the last move is
[1:07:00] Oneness it can be Oneness with the world
[1:07:02] with the Antichrist or to be one with
[1:07:04] Christ yes sir he says and the Lord said
[1:07:07] behold this people is one and they have
[1:07:09] one language and this they will begin to
[1:07:11] do and now nothing will be restrained
[1:07:15] from
[1:07:17] them which they have imagined to do look
[1:07:21] at the power of imagination and Oneness
[1:07:26] power imagination and Oneness do you
[1:07:28] think we can really go up and and
[1:07:30] Conquer God yeah I believe that really
[1:07:33] yeah okay cool they all start growing
[1:07:36] and growing in that and they that was
[1:07:37] their and they put their best scientists
[1:07:39] and mathematicians on the job they
[1:07:41] started come up with this and with this
[1:07:43] and with this and they started
[1:07:44] understanding the laws of physics and
[1:07:45] the laws of nature and all those sort of
[1:07:46] things and they come to a spot where God
[1:07:47] said that's what they can do they could
[1:07:49] do it but they had to get in one Accord
[1:07:53] do you think in the Tower of Babel
[1:07:54] they're like God Mercy scientist man why
[1:07:57] don't you work a little bit harder you
[1:07:58] know come on let's do this no they were
[1:07:59] all one ACC Court hey what you get what
[1:08:00] do you get today oh yeah that one
[1:08:02] equation yeah well this equation work
[1:08:04] with this one too we're going to get
[1:08:05] that
[1:08:07] guy they were in such Harmony they saw
[1:08:09] no fault with one another they were in
[1:08:12] that kind of Oneness saints of God when
[1:08:13] the BR the body of Jesus Christ can come
[1:08:16] back to that
[1:08:19] Oneness he's waiting for that Oneness
[1:08:23] and I'll say like this brother cam read
[1:08:24] a quote about month ago it blew my mind
[1:08:28] it was in Oneness one of the Oneness of
[1:08:29] sermons brother B said he says he said
[1:08:31] the reason God can't do he says it was
[1:08:34] literally the fall it was the fall of
[1:08:36] the Ephesian Church age it was the fall
[1:08:38] of the book of Acts what took place the
[1:08:40] Deeds of Nick leans they formed groups
[1:08:42] and
[1:08:43] separated when they broke that Unity
[1:08:46] where everyone's equal when no one
[1:08:49] thought themselves higher than the other
[1:08:52] when everyone was equal and oh here he's
[1:08:54] a minister praise the Lord be that min
[1:08:55] Min BL oh well this brothers are this
[1:08:57] and that and this brother and this
[1:08:58] sister got a gift of this and the sister
[1:08:59] this brother's got a gift of this but
[1:09:01] when they elevated themselves above as
[1:09:03] the clergy as the priesthood it broke
[1:09:06] the unity of God and the presence of God
[1:09:09] departed yes see what we got to do we've
[1:09:13] got to come back to where a minister
[1:09:15] yeah they're fivefold they're our
[1:09:16] servants
[1:09:18] absolutely that's what they are their
[1:09:20] servants they're gifts for you brother
[1:09:23] said he the pastor he was the love gift
[1:09:24] to the church
[1:09:26] gift not Lord gift but what we're all
[1:09:31] equal in one yesj there is no big ones
[1:09:34] or little ones SS of God that's the
[1:09:37] that's the unity we've got to come back
[1:09:38] to and when he when God sees that he'll
[1:09:41] he'll drop like we've never seen him
[1:09:43] before amen that's the word that's
[1:09:45] absolutely the word now look at this
[1:09:47] here we're at hour five just a little
[1:09:49] bit longer here by God's grace now look
[1:09:51] at it notice in Exodus I forgot the e
[1:09:53] there uh must have copy that wrong he
[1:09:56] said Thou shalt not C kill Thou shalt
[1:09:57] not commit adultery thou shal not steal
[1:09:59] thou sh not bear fall witness against
[1:10:00] thy neighbor Thou shalt not cover thy
[1:10:02] neighbor's house that cover thy
[1:10:03] neighbor's wife nor his maid servants
[1:10:04] nor ma maid servant uh man servant maid
[1:10:07] servant Ox anything like that right now
[1:10:08] that's in the natural or the Covenant to
[1:10:11] us not no but he's dealing with what he
[1:10:13] says a lot of these things take place in
[1:10:15] the natural but when Christ came on he
[1:10:18] says ye have heard them said by old time
[1:10:21] Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say
[1:10:23] unto you that whosoever lookth upon a
[1:10:25] woman to lust after has committed
[1:10:26] adultery with her in her heart already
[1:10:28] see he's dealing with thoughts because
[1:10:30] those thoughts deal louder than
[1:10:33] this just the desire then the even
[1:10:37] action was worse the desire was equal to
[1:10:40] the action right because you're already
[1:10:42] entertaining those
[1:10:44] things right amen of course the Bible
[1:10:48] says and he will what Jesus Christ came
[1:10:50] to what magnify the law and make it
[1:10:52] honorable he wants his bride is going to
[1:10:55] be what pure his bride will think lovely
[1:10:59] thoughts about every brother every
[1:11:01] sister because when it comes down to a
[1:11:03] sints of God up there when you go beyond
[1:11:05] the current time that's all we are as
[1:11:07] brothers and sisters there's no marriage
[1:11:09] over
[1:11:10] there there would be that little special
[1:11:13] somebody but that's it I
[1:11:14] mean when brother R went over there here
[1:11:17] comes hope he what you say oh Bill she
[1:11:20] said our precious brother hugged him
[1:11:22] took off hadn't seen him for how many
[1:11:25] years 50 40 years 30 years can't
[1:11:29] seem special someone but she hugged them
[1:11:31] and moved on and all everyone else
[1:11:33] started hugging him too so you didn't
[1:11:34] say no this one's mine this is mine no
[1:11:36] would like that yes sir let's Elevate
[1:11:40] our
[1:11:41] thoughts up here Heavenly places
[1:11:45] hallelujah amen now let me continue on
[1:11:48] here by God's
[1:11:50] grace almost done here by God's grace
[1:11:52] let's he look what Christ said he say
[1:11:55] say uh Matthew
[1:11:58] 1233 either make the tree good and his
[1:12:02] fruit good or else make the tree corrupt
[1:12:04] and his fruit corrupt for the tree is
[1:12:06] known by his fruit he says oh Generation
[1:12:09] V vipers how can you being evil speak
[1:12:11] good things see how can you have evil
[1:12:14] thoughts and yet out of out of your
[1:12:15] mouth says good things right that's the
[1:12:18] difference is the
[1:12:20] thoughts is what what are they really
[1:12:22] are is what is in here not what comes
[1:12:24] out of the mouth very good very good and
[1:12:26] yet the Bible what Jesus said he says
[1:12:28] that what goes in but cometh out with
[1:12:30] defileth a man because with the what
[1:12:31] comes out of a man doesn't match his
[1:12:33] thoughts or his Compassion or the his
[1:12:35] love is obviously off the word it's a
[1:12:38] lie he says a good man out of the good
[1:12:40] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:12:42] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:12:44] evil Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:12:45] forth evil things but I say unto you
[1:12:46] every I that Every Idle Word that a man
[1:12:49] shall speak shall he he shall give
[1:12:51] account thereof on the day Every Idle
[1:12:54] Word on the day of judgment amen now
[1:12:58] almost done I want to I want to finish
[1:12:59] here by God's grace I want to show you
[1:13:01] something here there's an
[1:13:03] experiment and this is literally one of
[1:13:06] the things that blew my
[1:13:07] mind how many want the the presence of
[1:13:10] the Lord to be with you all the
[1:13:12] time just the other day or last last
[1:13:15] Sunday it was at it was at uh in
[1:13:18] nvar at the service there and you know
[1:13:21] sometimes you get down on yourself or
[1:13:22] you start doubting yourself I was I
[1:13:24] can't remember if I was praying in the
[1:13:25] car while my wife was driving or if I
[1:13:26] when I got to the church I started
[1:13:28] praying on the you I said Lord God I'd
[1:13:30] like to know that that I'm not that
[1:13:31] you're with me but I'm with
[1:13:34] you and I'd already picked the sermon I
[1:13:36] already had it what I thought and then
[1:13:38] there goes up brother Levi behind this
[1:13:41] and he literally he literally used the
[1:13:44] exact same scriptures I was using in the
[1:13:46] middle the middle of my service where
[1:13:48] sermon where I was going to go he was
[1:13:49] using exact same scriptures but it was
[1:13:51] from a different angle I was looking
[1:13:53] from this angle he's looking from this
[1:13:54] angle but it's the exact same
[1:13:56] thing and I'm just like Lord I want to
[1:14:00] be with
[1:14:02] you I'm not interested in myself Lord
[1:14:04] what what do you want me to do where do
[1:14:06] you want me to be I want to be where you
[1:14:08] go that was that was the that was the
[1:14:10] Old Testament Saints right there they
[1:14:11] were led by what the pillar of fire uh
[1:14:13] By Night and the cloud by day SS of God
[1:14:15] they had to be with
[1:14:17] him he doesn't follow you sints of God
[1:14:19] even though the signs shall follow he
[1:14:21] said but what we've got to follow God
[1:14:23] Amen we've got to follow the anointing
[1:14:25] the Holy Ghost amen we got the fin of
[1:14:26] moving in the spirit so what I'm trying
[1:14:28] to say here is
[1:14:30] that I want to show you the power of
[1:14:32] your
[1:14:34] thoughts and let me ask you a question
[1:14:38] what is what is on your scale of
[1:14:41] intelligence what is more intelligent a
[1:14:44] puppy or a chick sister Haven you would
[1:14:48] know what would be more intelligent a
[1:14:49] chick or a puppy
[1:14:55] there was an experiment done in
[1:15:00] 1988 and a scientist took he made a
[1:15:02] little robot and Back in 88 that was
[1:15:04] pretty intense for robots that can move
[1:15:06] you know and he programmed it to go
[1:15:08] randomly to move
[1:15:10] forward right or left and that was the
[1:15:13] whole thing and he set a little box he
[1:15:16] uh a rectangle putting a rectangle
[1:15:19] rectangle enclosure he put it there and
[1:15:21] he put a little pencil on the bottom of
[1:15:22] this robot and he turned the robot on it
[1:15:24] just started
[1:15:26] it started moving
[1:15:29] right and they call now obviously they
[1:15:31] call this uh psycho Kinesis but we know
[1:15:34] this is thoughts okay the power of the
[1:15:37] thought and what he did next was he took
[1:15:39] a little incubator egg and he hatched
[1:15:42] this
[1:15:43] egg and he put this baby chick one day
[1:15:47] old baby chick in with this robot and
[1:15:49] turn the robot on and that chick
[1:15:51] according to science that whatever that
[1:15:53] chick sees is its mother the first thing
[1:15:55] so that chick would follow this robot
[1:15:57] just you know pecking wherever that
[1:16:00] robot went that chick was that chick
[1:16:02] went and they let it go for days so that
[1:16:04] chick was just they put feed you know
[1:16:06] and the chick would eat but he would
[1:16:08] always follow that mother that mother
[1:16:11] robot and the next portion of the the
[1:16:14] the experiment was this they cleaned
[1:16:16] everything up put a new sheet of paper
[1:16:17] in put it in that
[1:16:20] rectangle and they took the chick out
[1:16:22] and put the chick in a cage so that
[1:16:24] chick could see that
[1:16:27] robot and they turn that robot
[1:16:30] on and I want to show you the
[1:16:35] results this is before the
[1:16:38] chick and look how the thoughts of the
[1:16:40] chick pulled this robot to this
[1:16:46] side that chick wanted its mother so
[1:16:49] bad that it drew the power of the
[1:16:52] thoughts of this chick Drew
[1:16:56] that robot to paint over here to Mark
[1:17:00] over here instead of go all randomly all
[1:17:03] over the place the power of its
[1:17:07] thoughts you know all these big b
[1:17:10] businessmen are into manifestation they
[1:17:11] call it manifestation that if you focus
[1:17:14] on your success if you focus so much and
[1:17:17] you imagine and visualize doing this I
[1:17:20] think Michael Jordan Larry Bird all them
[1:17:21] did this visualization
[1:17:24] kind of regreg did it
[1:17:26] visualization I'm G to do this I'm gonna
[1:17:28] do this I'm G do this I'm G do this and
[1:17:30] they went and did it and it happened
[1:17:31] exactly the way they thought they were
[1:17:34] tapping into
[1:17:37] something so if you a son and daughter
[1:17:40] of God would think about Jesus Christ so
[1:17:43] much and your thoughts would be
[1:17:45] continually about him and about his word
[1:17:48] and saying Lord God open this up to me
[1:17:51] give me Revelation on this give me your
[1:17:54] thoughts on this give me your advice on
[1:17:56] this Lord Jesus and you can he what you
[1:17:58] can literally pull him down from heaven
[1:18:01] you can walk what what did what did what
[1:18:03] did Enoch do he walked with God good
[1:18:06] good yes if a chicken do it to Something
[1:18:11] in adamant this didn't even have a heart
[1:18:13] in it this was not even
[1:18:15] alive what are they doing in the
[1:18:17] business they're they're they're pulling
[1:18:18] for money they're pulling for Prestige
[1:18:20] Wealth and fame which isn't even
[1:18:22] living how much more us a child and Son
[1:18:26] of God think on the Creator our heavenly
[1:18:29] father not only our father but our
[1:18:32] husband yes how much more will he draw
[1:18:35] Close to You Hallelujah yes sir yes sir
[1:18:39] if we just keep our minds on himall but
[1:18:44] look at this the chick loves I we've had
[1:18:47] a brw of chickens one time that they
[1:18:49] brooded and whatever that that them
[1:18:50] chicks love their mama so much they want
[1:18:53] to be under her wing all the time in
[1:18:55] fact so much the mother wanted to get
[1:18:57] out of that that little cage we had her
[1:18:58] in she like get trying to shoe them away
[1:19:01] they're too pesty right they're just we
[1:19:03] need you I don't have any milk eat eat
[1:19:06] scratch
[1:19:09] right but God's not like that he says
[1:19:11] pull from
[1:19:12] me pull from me that's right son
[1:19:16] daughter what do you need pull from
[1:19:19] me the man I was witnessing to this week
[1:19:22] he said Simon he goes I used to be an
[1:19:24] atheist but then I kind of I soften
[1:19:25] myself to God I go why were you Nath
[1:19:27] this he said he said I look around I see
[1:19:29] all these children dying of
[1:19:31] cancer he says and God wasn't healing
[1:19:33] him he said how could God do that how
[1:19:36] could God let them do that and I said
[1:19:38] sir I said you've got to understand the
[1:19:41] Bible I said you got to understand I
[1:19:43] started working what before Genesis 1:1
[1:19:45] and how there was no God when he was
[1:19:47] just a self-existing one within him was
[1:19:48] all the attributes I say I said brother
[1:19:50] I said I call him brother because he was
[1:19:52] Lutheran I said brother the reason not
[1:19:55] the reason they're getting sick and
[1:19:56] dying is because they don't know how to
[1:19:57] pull from the one who has healing power
[1:20:01] and he's put like this I said if you
[1:20:03] don't seek God for what he can give you
[1:20:05] you'll never get
[1:20:07] it God will God is a gentleman he'll not
[1:20:11] force you he's not going to force his
[1:20:14] Blessing he's not going to force his
[1:20:16] healing his provision on you SS of God
[1:20:18] but you got to what pull from
[1:20:22] it amen
[1:20:26] yes praise the
[1:20:28] Lord like
[1:20:31] this brother's dealing with uh if you
[1:20:33] listen to the key to the door he's going
[1:20:36] through all these certain gifts great
[1:20:38] men like uh
[1:20:40] Edison uh you name it all these men had
[1:20:43] dreams and decisions in fact I saw a
[1:20:45] picture one day showed all these great
[1:20:46] men that had accomplished things after
[1:20:48] their 50s and 40s like uh Colonel
[1:20:50] Sanders was like in his 50s or 60s
[1:20:52] before then he just boom just and at the
[1:20:55] end of this or at the end of the story
[1:20:57] here he goes on to uh tell about that
[1:21:00] cartoonist Walt Disney right he was
[1:21:03] rejected rejected rejected he could draw
[1:21:07] he could write this but he was rejected
[1:21:08] rejected but he said something inside of
[1:21:10] him
[1:21:11] believed he could make it that he had
[1:21:14] the gift to make comics something inside
[1:21:16] him believed he said but he what was
[1:21:18] that belief he said he had a
[1:21:20] key see that's where we got to search
[1:21:22] ourselves do you have that key
[1:21:25] that knows you're going to make this
[1:21:26] Rapture do you have that faith and say
[1:21:29] well well brother I don't know ask God
[1:21:31] togive you what what did the disciples
[1:21:33] say he says increase our faith
[1:21:35] Hallelujah you're no different than
[1:21:37] disciples disciples were just like us
[1:21:40] there are some cardal half the time I'm
[1:21:42] sure Christ was going W father this is
[1:21:44] the one you chose absolutely all right
[1:21:46] let's continue back to business all
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:49] right James and John fighting over
[1:21:51] positions are like Jesus just going
[1:21:58] yet I love them and I prayed for Peter
[1:22:00] too
[1:22:04] yeah but inside them they had the key
[1:22:07] within them they believed and knew that
[1:22:11] Jesus was the son of God yes sir and
[1:22:13] that he was going this was for a purpose
[1:22:16] what is the purpose we're we're in 2024
[1:22:18] almost ready to jump 202 what's the
[1:22:19] purpose SS of God your purpose is going
[1:22:21] to be made manifest SS of God when the
[1:22:23] sons of God and daughter has become
[1:22:25] manifested that is where we're going
[1:22:28] that is what brother J was saying back
[1:22:29] here about that lad rain when that lad
[1:22:30] rain hits it's going to produce
[1:22:33] Hallelujah it is going to produce things
[1:22:36] great things greater things amen W
[1:22:40] didn't get very far
[1:22:43] um I want I want to bring this in real
[1:22:47] quick now we've during services this is
[1:22:50] why people I think brother cam actually
[1:22:53] he taught this a while back and then
[1:22:54] when I was teach when I was thinking on
[1:22:56] these things these thoughts are coming
[1:22:58] back to me when you're in the midst of a
[1:23:01] service and you need
[1:23:06] something the will of the presence of
[1:23:08] God is here to to deliver those things
[1:23:09] to you but you have to act
[1:23:13] quickly okay look at this quote
[1:23:16] here listen so many people in that day
[1:23:19] missed their opportunity you know
[1:23:21] there's so many people today missing
[1:23:22] that opportunity when you come into His
[1:23:25] presence and then turn away oh what an
[1:23:27] opportunity for men and women boys and
[1:23:28] girls to come before Christ and pour out
[1:23:31] their soul but he had a mission that
[1:23:33] seem to be more important so in other
[1:23:34] words sints of God when you feel the
[1:23:36] presence of God draw close pull on him
[1:23:39] because if you fail to pull on him
[1:23:41] you'll miss the blessing it won't cost
[1:23:44] NE necessarily A lot of times it won't
[1:23:46] cost your salvation though it can if
[1:23:48] you're sinning or whatever and you need
[1:23:49] to repent and and the and the man of God
[1:23:51] says repent repent repent get right do
[1:23:54] things right make sure you're clean
[1:23:56] before God Amen and we failed to go on
[1:23:58] with that you could literally hear it
[1:24:00] for the last time in your
[1:24:01] life now look at this he says I'm so
[1:24:05] happy for you to hear these things you
[1:24:06] notice after I'm gone there will be a
[1:24:08] long a little long time here and you
[1:24:10] ministers in your churches you'll hear
[1:24:11] of people appearing and saying you know
[1:24:13] that's just left me there's some of them
[1:24:15] that I can't call I see it hanging over
[1:24:18] them in between them there's someone who
[1:24:20] stands here on the platform he says it's
[1:24:22] a dark place in between here and there
[1:24:24] and sometimes I see the move he's
[1:24:25] dealing with that light in the audience
[1:24:28] he's calling for prayer right he says
[1:24:30] and sometimes I see the move but I can't
[1:24:31] see the person see just right and
[1:24:34] especially when you're under the
[1:24:35] anointing you just can't see it and if
[1:24:37] you don't act quickly why it'll move
[1:24:39] somewhere else you
[1:24:41] see so as soon as you feel Faith for
[1:24:43] something you're praying for something
[1:24:45] you have a need for something and the
[1:24:47] preacher is preaching and you feel Faith
[1:24:48] rise up for just say just yell out SS of
[1:24:51] God say Lord I accept it yes or amen
[1:24:53] praise God
[1:24:56] amen the preacher might not even know
[1:24:58] what's going on it might not be a prayer
[1:24:59] line say God but if you feel a p
[1:25:01] something pulling in your heart and you
[1:25:03] say that's what I need Lord I need it
[1:25:05] and you feel the faith do something
[1:25:06] about it make a move
[1:25:09] amen he says here's a kidney trouble
[1:25:12] lady uh there's a kidney trouble lady
[1:25:15] right back there with the kidney
[1:25:16] condition you believe God makes you well
[1:25:18] lady if you do raise up your hand he
[1:25:21] just wanted him to her to make a motion
[1:25:23] he says accept it respond to God's call
[1:25:26] he says you missed
[1:25:28] it just like that missed
[1:25:32] it so when you feel the presence of God
[1:25:34] when you feel something rise up in you
[1:25:36] say say yes Lord I accept it because it
[1:25:40] can be missed now it didn't miss didn't
[1:25:42] miss your salvation now look what takes
[1:25:44] place after this it falls on he says you
[1:25:46] missed it or not he says you missed it
[1:25:48] I'll show you whether you missed it or
[1:25:49] not she I'll prove it he says you missed
[1:25:50] it but I'll prove it it falls on this
[1:25:53] lady setting right ear with a napkin
[1:25:55] over her mouth this lady sitting right
[1:25:56] there with a bad trouble too that's
[1:25:58] right lady didn't it yes yes sir you
[1:26:01] just come from an operation a cancer
[1:26:03] operation that's right your name is
[1:26:04] Virginia that's right you're healed
[1:26:06] Virginia in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:07] makes you well you missed it Mr Anderson
[1:26:09] because you didn't respond see see oh
[1:26:11] how can you unbeli you see the
[1:26:13] sovereignty of
[1:26:15] God do you see how deadly sincere this
[1:26:18] was back then they were dealing with
[1:26:20] what with the son of man Ministry the
[1:26:22] God himself the pillar of fire was right
[1:26:24] there and ready to make a move and a lot
[1:26:27] of times people did not catch it because
[1:26:30] why they were not in sync with
[1:26:33] hum that's why we have I wonder if that
[1:26:35] lady that missed it I wonder if they
[1:26:36] didn't come here and pray beforehand and
[1:26:38] get into the spirit of God because if
[1:26:40] they would have been in the spirit of
[1:26:41] God they would have caught their healing
[1:26:43] right there and they would have been Joy
[1:26:44] running and shouting and praising God
[1:26:47] they would have never been sick no more
[1:26:49] oh my yeah look he says what about you
[1:26:53] Reverend what do you think about about
[1:26:54] it do you think God can make them
[1:26:55] spiritual problems go away from you and
[1:26:57] make you a Believer make you to believe
[1:26:59] all right you can have then ask what you
[1:27:01] ask for God bless you what did he touch
[1:27:03] this lady sat right here right at the
[1:27:05] end of the road C lady sitting right
[1:27:07] there with cancer you think God can make
[1:27:09] you well lady do you have a prayer card

[1:27:16] it she still said yes amen praise God a
[1:27:19] lot of times you hear the sermons and
[1:27:20] they start breaking crying they're
[1:27:22] crying oh that's right that's right
[1:27:23] that's right praise God she didn't make
[1:27:25] one she was not in tune with the move SS
[1:27:28] of God imagine this the Malachi 4 just
