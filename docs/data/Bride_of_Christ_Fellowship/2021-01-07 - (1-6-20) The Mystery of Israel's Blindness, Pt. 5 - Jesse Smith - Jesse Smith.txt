look at israel's blindness hopefully we can finish it tonight uh get through this subject great subject let's go to daniel uh chapter 9 verse 25 we'd like to go there by the end i'm hoping to get to daniel 70 weeks we'll just briefly go over it's a great subject but i taught on it a couple years ago i remember i like to just look at it again tonight so i can finish off this chapter daniel 9 25. daniel 9 25. i'd like to read the memory verse after that [Music] all right i'll read 25 and 26 and 27. let me read those three by myself and then we'll read the memory verse together back in first samuel 17. i'm going to read daniel 9 25. know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score in two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troubles times and after three score in two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate quite a mysterious scripture so let's go to first samuel 17 now for samuel 17 47 first samuel 17 47. we'll read this one together this will be our january scripture to memorize trusting in the lord to save us this year praise god from all of our trials all of our struggles all of our sicknesses anything that would he would permit in his mercy to come upon us we're asking the lord to save us not by our own selves but by his mighty hand verse 47 let's read that on three one two three and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's just make it own unto god tonight heavenly father we're gathered lord in reverence lord and sincerity in this sacred place lord god worshiping you we're so glad we're here when the spirit comes lord god and let tonight be one of those times where your spirit comes does something to help us lord strengthen us lord teach us and lord encourage us lord god just fill us with your love and power here tonight and father as you speak your word lord god help me to get out of your way and the people as well each one of us lord hear from heaven tonight lord and we'll leave and say it was good to be in the house of lord tonight father because lord all the blessings of god all the revelations and all the understanding and father let your word be in our mouth lord let it be nigh to us even in our mouths lord may we speak your word live by your word and lord bless us and encourage us in the midweek service here in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god you can switch over here i just have a few quotes eventually you want to get to daniel 70 weeks i'm not going to go real depth in depth into it i'm just going to show how it's a little different than my previous understanding okay so like i said i'm not going to i'm going to set my timer too i guess i set my timer sunday and then i turn it off i didn't even realize what i was doing so i'll try to watch it to better tonight here i'll set up for 45 minutes that would be great if i get done in 45 minutes so let's uh look to the word of god here tonight so i'm about halfway done with the final book i'm just about halfway done with all the final edits i'm reading through it about an hour of morning and uh making little edits and corrections and everything about i'm about halfway done i think tomorrow i'll be halfway done so it's coming along slowly but i'm enjoying staying in the word of god now let's tonight uh let's pick up where we left off we picked up with i'm sorry we left off with god's covenant with israel through abraham and we saw uh we ended how god tries to convince backsliding israel his love by referencing the steadfastness of the sunlight moon stars and oceans all right now i want to just break into just a real quick lesson this is more for those who well it's for everybody but it's i think it's a good understanding about uh dispensations versus covenants now i don't know if you're familiar with this but dispensation the way we use it is a modern term okay we use it like oh the dispensation of the gentiles or the dispensation of the jews actually if you study the bible dispensation only refers to paul's ministry to the gentiles so we're going to look at that tonight uh but if somebody asked me brother jesse do you believe in the dispensation of gentiles i'd say yes with the modern definition but with the bible definition uh the bible jesus calls it the times of the gentiles okay the actual word dispensation in the bible uh it actually means a stewardship that was given to paul and i'm going to prove it to you tonight so let's uh let's look to the word of god now first corinthians 9. let's go to first corinthians 9 17. maybe lydia maokai can do some reading for me trying to watch my voice because i've been at school this week and uh uh nature how's school going this week good yeah having fun learning a little bit okay praise the lord yeah we're kind of getting back in the swing of it yeah i got more kids in the classroom now so it's a little more busy uh that's good it's good to teach children and show them jesus is love all right first corinthians 9 17. now watch carefully church the the language paul uses and you'll see what i mean there's only four scriptures in the bible that talk about dispensation there's only four and they're all refer three of them refer to paul and then one of them talks about the dispensation of the fullness of times so this is so we use dispensation i said in a fairly modern terminology uh which deals with uh a dispensation like a time period but in the bible that's not really what it means so first corinthians 9 17 malachi or i'm sorry malcolm can you read that for us okay a dispensation is committed to who to paul now the word dispensation means stewardship all right so someone that's a steward or like a overseer or something right so paul says a dispensation of stewardship is committed unto me all right now this same word is used in jesus's parable of the unjust steward uh in luke 16. so the steward again is a dispensation the unjust person who had the dispensation he wasn't faithful with his stewardship okay so paul says i have a stewardship to oversee uh the ministry to the gentiles all right now ephesians 1 verse 10 lydia ephesians 1 10. and then malachi can you go to ephesians 3 verse 2. so lydia go ahead ephesians 1 10. okay so this is the one where paul is speaking god has one dispensation of all the times so this is a perfect example of stewardship god has one overseeing or one stewardship of all the times okay and the bible says he'll gather them all in christ in the new jerusalem when all heaven and earth are subject unto him so this is speaking of god's one dispensation god is the overseer of every time period praise god remember paul said i have a stewardship of the gospel committed to me this one says god has one great stewardship i'm glad god's in control of this kingdom and we aren't praise god because he's going to make sure this kingdom stands amen now uh next one is ephesians 3 2 malachi all right so who was it given to paul who was his stewardship given to paul so again notice he says each time it's given to me i'm overseeing this uh the so the paul's dispensation is him uh teaching the gentiles the revelation of jesus christ it's a stewardship given to him okay so next one lydia colossians 1 25 is the last final scripture on dispensation then we've read all four of them so you can see dispensation is not used in the bible the way we use it today okay lady go ahead colossians 1 25. okay so each time paul says it's given to me i have a dispensation given to me and then the fourth time he said god has a dispensation given over the entire time period of world history praise god so this is more of a technical point but i just wanted to make it known that it's best referred to the time of the gentiles is best referred to as the seven church ages or the times of the gentiles the bible doesn't use the word dispensation for the full time period it refers to paul's ministry or stewardship to take the gospel to the gentiles so if people argue and say there's no such thing as dispensations you know they they have a certain they have a certain point they're making there the point is that paul had that dispensation that oversight that stewardship right so for example it wasn't given to you and i to take the gospel to the gentiles right it wasn't our stewardship right we're just continuing what paul's stewardship started okay so it's just a technical term but i know those two students who love the word of god i know you appreciate things like that the dispensation only has four verses as we said three of them deal with paul one of them deals with god's dispensation god's stewardship but if someone said oh what about this dispensation of the gentiles i'd say okay if you're just referring to the church ages the night you're using a modern definition you're not exactly using the bible definition and i could understand what they're talking about okay all right now uh i want to move past that i just wanted to quickly go over that now there's eight covenants now i preached these uh when the coronavirus struck the first time in march and april i don't know if we did some bible studies on our porch you guys remember that okay so i'm not gonna preach those again i'm just gonna review them there's eight covenants that i've found uh brother brahm didn't say seven or eight covenants he just said there was lots of covenants so some people say or clarence larkin says there's seven covenants i think there's eight uh okay so the first one is eden covenant where's she see that over there there's the eden covenant which is made with adam and eve before sin came in the next one after sin is that adamic covenant between adam and eve fallen and god the third one is the noahic covenant noahik covenant i think that's how you say it that's where god's not going to destroy it by a flood anymore the fourth is abraham and this is a massive covenant this is the covenant that was finally going to impact and bless all nations around the world but again it didn't do away with sin praise god abraham's covenant was great it foretold of it but it didn't do away with it so the fifth one is the mosaic covenant that's the giving of the law and the priesthood uh the sixth one is the davidic covenant which uh gives us a king of this of the seed line of david praise god in the millennium it's the son of david jesus christ because of that covenant praise god amen it's an unending covenant and then wonderfully the seventh covenant the one word right now the new covenant praise god where the word of god is written upon the fleshly tables of our hearts praise god no longer on stone now he writes it in your souls and we ought to rejoice if it's in our souls tonight praise god amen thank god but there's going to come another covenant because brother brahm says we're not always going to need the blood of jesus right once we get to the new bodies and sin is done away with after the white throne judgment it's time for the new jerusalem will no longer need blood to forgive us anymore right because we have a new body we have a new spirit we have a theophany we have a glorified body everything he said behold all things are made new praise god and so there's no more need of blood to forgive us right there's no more need of that and so he has a final eternal covenant praise god a new heaven and a new earth so i believe this is just a uh i believe it's i believe it's a revelation some people might not agree with me but i believe it's a revelation it's the eighth covenant and we looked at that uh this spring now let's go to daniel 70 weeks here now just real briefly uh if you got your bibles who read last was it lydia yeah some malachi malakai read genesis 29 27 a week in the bible can mean seven years okay because jacob had to fulfill rachel's week and work seven additional years so the way to understand this is to understand that a week god can use different words to mean different amounts of time because he hides his truth in mystery so malachi read genesis 29-27 okay so everybody can see a week can mean seven years praise god all right now let's go to daniel let's all go to daniel 9 20 please daniel 9 20. we'll go back there and like i said we'll go a little bit longer here i got what 34 more minutes lay this message in tonight and i think we'll be done with this revelation then we'll move on i'd like to go next to the revelation of christ as the bride of christ i'd like to preach on that i think everybody will really be blessed by that one daniel 9 20. now remember daniel is seeking god if you look at verse verse one and two he's seeking god to understand jeremiah's prophecy when does his 70 years run out he starts praying in verse 3 sets his face to heaven to understand and in verse 20 the bible said while i was speaking and praying confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god look at that man even while as i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the heavenly oblation now look how fast this angel comes in right kind of like reminds us of brother branham with that vision right the seven angels he said they come like breaking the speed barrier he comes swiftly right and they touched him verse 22 and he informed me and said talk with me and said o daniel i have now come forth to give the skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i have come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision praise god remember we saw it on sunday we're greatly loved in heaven if we're contacting heaven if we're confessing our sins confessing the sins of our loved ones and trusting in the blood of jesus christ heaven loves us amen verse 24 70 weeks here we are are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy praise god hallelujah now notice verse 24 who is this prophecy for thy people it's for the jews it's upon thy holy city jerusalem there are six things that have to happen so daniel's prayer for national and spiritual restoration can be fulfilled and i got them up here in order we'll just go through them again the first one is the taking away the blindness of israel uh i'm sorry to finish the transgressions that means uh israel is no longer transgressing when their blindness is taken away second thing gabriel came is to make an end of sin that's when their unbelief ends when jesus literally and physically appears to the 144 thousand they no longer disbelieve right they believe third they make reconciliation for iniquity this is israel being purged or pardoned on one day that's the day they're born again see they're they're reconciled right no more iniquity they're reconciled the fourth thing is to bring in everlasting righteousness that's the millennium praise god amen hallelujah one time somebody said i was wrong saying everlasting was the millennium but that's what the bible says there the bible says it right there so a thousand years can mean everlasting right just like just like jonah said i was in the belly of the whale forever right it's just an expression right the only word that means eternal is eternal right right that's the one that means unending so everlasting means the millennium okay and the fifth seal up the vision and prophecy that's gabriel came to seal up the understanding of the vision and prophecy from israel and everyone else until the end time and lastly i love this one he's going to anoint the most holy so gabriel's not going to anoint jesus jesus is already anointed right he's going to anoint the millennial temple praise god so god's going to come down and fill that temple right there in jerusalem again praise god a new temple a millennial temple for a thousand years of worship praise god now i just like i said i'm going quickly through this now next daniel 70 weeks brother adam says the purpose is because the purpose of him teaching it was because we're expecting something to happen uh that they saw wrote in the book of revelation when it's not applied to the church age so brother is saying this i'm preaching this so you'll see that daniel 70 weeks doesn't apply to the church age right that means it's after okay so this one this this message is is important because it shows that this uh teaching doesn't belong in the church age it's not for us right in other words we don't have to worry about being on the earth right when all these things happen we'll be at the marriage supper the lamb praise god so my man said that's why he he was ex some people were expecting these things to happen right they're expecting to see israel repent well we are but we're expecting to see it looking over the banister in heaven praise god we don't want to live through the tribulation right we don't live through water being turned to blood we don't want to be uh living through the moon turning the blood and the sun no longer shining we don't want to live through that praise god we want to be in heaven with jesus christ for the marriage supper of the lamb so see he taught this because some people were expecting the wrong thing and also he said because it shows how close we are to his coming we're not going to read through all that but just to show it like that okay now i'm going to leave this up here for a while so everybody can just get a good look at it so this will be in the book here lord willing if the lord tarries daniel 70 weeks prophecy in verses 25 to 27. actually you know i need to change that to 24. this first 24 to 27. so i need to make a reminder of that so don't miss that now we got three time periods we just read for our text there's three time periods uh to help us understand this now the first time period was uh seven years or seven weeks or 49 years until the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild jerusalem the street shall be built again and the wall even in troubles times now clarence larkin did great history work on this he said that first commandment uh from artaxerxes longamanus king of persia was in 445 bc and the temple and its wall were finished 49 years later in 396 bc so that part was officially fulfilled there's not much argument about this one praise god this part is the easiest one to understand praise god okay and nehemiah 4 17 confirms it was troubleless time the bible said they which built it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid everyone with with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon can you imagine building a wall you've got a hand with a a brick and you got a hand with a sword just just such a troublesome time to live right you didn't have the you didn't have the security just to build with both hands you had to be ready to fight on the drop of a hat bye i'm thankful for the aren't you thankful for the peaceful world that we live in today i don't got to go to work packing a gun i guess you could in some some work places right but you have to have your gun in one hand and you know you're typing with the other hand we don't to live like that thank god for his mercy but this was the condition uh that israel lived in when this prophecy was fulfilled and it tells us church god is going to fulfill his prophecy no matter what the saints go through amen no matter what we've got to go through to make it to the rapture god is going to fulfill his word to us amen hallelujah and if church if they could live through such troublesome times without the holy ghost what should we be able to live through with the holy ghost amen we should have faith right even though it looked like uh trouble happened today right down in washington d.c all that trouble happened yet we should have faith to know god is with us uh god's still working even when we don't see it right we should sing waymaker right even when we don't see it god is working praise god he's gonna bring everything to pass just as he planned his plan is perfect amen now here's where we get a little bit of here's where we get some of the uh mystery part here the second time period daniel says is in 60 yeah it's uh verse 26 and after three score in two weeks shall messiah be cut off so three scores 60 plus two 62. now you got to add those 49 years plus the 434 years okay so after 62 weeks but you can't forget the previous seven weeks so now after in other words after 69 weeks messiah will be cut off okay so that turns out to be uh 483 years so from the time that king artaxerxes long amount manus uh commanded the temple to be rebuilt 483 is la 483 years later messiah would be crucified all right now let's just do some simple math up here so 445 bc to 1bc to 180 is 445 years now we still got 38 years left so that takes us to 38 a.d okay but i thought jesus died in 30 a.d so right now if you do the math it takes you to 38 a.d so how do we get to jesus being crucified at 30 a.d here is the secret so hope this makes sense here all right now the combined 483 years of the first two time periods it must be converted converted to prophetic years rather than solar years okay so if you just do regular solar solar years you would end up at 38 a.d but what happened is god hid 483 prophetic years in man's 475 solar years okay all right now it's kind of a little bit tricky and that's because prophetic years are shorter years uh than than the uh regular years right solar i'm sorry yeah prophetic years are shorter than the solar years so let me see if i can uh put that up there just so everybody can see i'm not sure if i can actually i'll just have to read it okay so in god's prophetic calendar there's only 30 days in a month right that's proven in the scripture yeah let's read that lydia read first kings 4 7 please i know you're real fast at finding the scriptures first kings 4 7. this scripture you'll see there's 30 days in every month because solomon had officers that would switch out every month after 30 days go ahead lydia [Music] all right so each man had a month in a year of 30 days okay so that means in god's calendar each month had 30 days right so 30 times 12 360. right 30 times 12 360. so god's year has 360 days who knows how many years we got in our day 365 and what a quarter and then they got adjusted every cup every four years right so so in other words our solar years are longer than the prophetic years or god's years all right now again malachi go to revelation 11 2 and 3. here's where you see god always keeps this this this time period the same even though man has changed the calendar to 365 and a quarter days god has always kept it the same so god always works according to his calendar and not our calendar so malachi read revelation 11 2-3 please all right so what is 1260 divided by 42 months 30 each month each month had 30 days and look at this this is amazing god so 445 years before christ god said it's going to be 483 years but he met prophetic years he didn't mean solar years like we got today okay so actually uh 400 most people would calculate it'd be to 38 a.d that's when the 483 years would run out 38 a.d but really because god's years are shorter those 483 years were fulfilled in 30 a.d when jesus was crucified and then rose from the dead praise god okay now notice god keeps that same pattern all the way past the rapture into the millennia i'm sorry yeah into the tribulation period not the end of the tribulation period god always has 30 days in a month always okay so without the numbers having up there hope that's okay uh lydia now if you would lydia read uh isaiah 45 15. this is such a beautiful scripture to understanding this so men men look well men look and say well it must have ran out in 38 a.d but god was so wise he used prophetic years and not solar years so lydia can read isaiah 45 15. amen so god hid himself god hit his revelation inside of man's solar years god the truth is hiding in there it's shorter than man's ears right and so god is able to fulfill all that within that that time frame which seems shorter to the worldly mind but to god's prophetic year it works out perfectly 483 years to the time christ was crucified and rose from the dead praise god amen now just so you know church a regular solar years has 176 i'm sorry a regular well i'm not going to go that's that's that's a whole lot of math there if i'm not going to show it i'm probably not going to read it i better not do that okay now i do wanna share this though i'll go to luke 3 21-23 the bible doesn't give us jesus's exact age the bible just kind of gives us a a an average number like kind of like a guess it doesn't tell us like the exact number so luke 3 21 22 and 23. so lydia do you got that honey luke three can you read verses 21 22-23 amen now notice saints the bible says about 30 years old right so god purposely doesn't give the exact age of jesus just about 30. so that gives us some wiggle room okay so in daniel 70 weeks just so you know there is some wiggle room we don't know the exact exact day or exact time that jesus was born no one really knows it for sure and look god did it on purpose look god did it on purpose to hide it from the eyes of the lies and prudent praise god he didn't even tell you exactly when it was he said he's about 30. he doesn't tell us so but we can get very close and that's what daniel's 70 weeks helps us do helps us get very close to his approximate age and then god leaves a little bit of wiggle room for us okay so which one just want everybody to see that all right now what's interesting what's amazing church is that if jesus died in a.d 30 and rose from the grave who knows what happened 40 years later anybody know any historians out there titus came titus came so titus came the roman general and destroyed jerusalem's temple right that's what they were saying when jesus was on the cross and he was carrying up the hill of to golgotha they were weeping over him and jesus said don't wait for me he said weep for yourselves he said pray that your flight be not in the winter right he said pray that it be not winter that the babes give suck in those days because it would be awful to run for the hills so jesus was warning them how many years advanced was he warning them 40 40. so see god works with israel in these perfect numbers isn't that amazing israel had to wait how many years in the wilderness 40 because they're disobedient right so god gave them 40 years of mercy after they rejected christ and then the judgment came ah look at that isn't that amazing i mean it hit all history knows titus came and destroyed it in 80 70. so see god is going to work with israel according to these time periods but with us jesus said no man knows that they're the hour right with gentiles it's just it's just out there we got to be ready all the world has to hear the gospel of jesus christ the gentiles got to work we got to stay faithful we got to stay diligent no man knows the day or the hour but the jews know the days and they know the years because god gave it to him 490 years or 70 weeks have to be fulfilled oh it's quite a thought my goodness remember hebrews 3 17 but with whom was he greed 40 years look he was grieved all those 40 years after after the resurrection after the holy ghost fell he was grieved with them for 40 years and then he sent titus to destroy him remember that fulfilled church part of daniel 70 weeks uh go to verse uh well if you got daniel 9 26 after three score in two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself amen jesus was cut off for you and i amen that tree was cut down so we didn't have to be cut down praise god then also of course for israel too that's the next revelation god jesus church now is both jew and gentile that's the next revelation he was cut off but not for himself he was cut off for the jews and the gentiles amen and the people of the prince that shall come who's that rome right the people of the prince rome that shall come who's coming titus is coming shall do what in verse 26 destroy the city and the sanctuary this is what jesus was warning them about see so jesus plays a special part in helping us understand daniel 70 weeks he said there's going to come there's going to come titus he said get to the hills as soon as you hear him coming run to the hills now we know the christians were out four or five years before titus even came the holy spirit protected those holy ghost-filled saints so we're trusting in the same grace to protect us before the mark of the beast is laid down amen because that's going to be the worst time ever according to daniel 12 the worst time ever of destruction on the earth will be during the tribulation so we're we believe god will keep us from that praise god amen resting our souls on that really we're resting our souls on the blood of jesus christ and the mercy of god because we've not inherited uh wrath we've inherited mercy praise god that's what first thessalonians 5 says okay so titus came 40 years later because god was grieved 40 years that the israelites turned down jesus and their carcasses fell there in jerusalem just like egypt when they rejected the promised land right but here they're rejecting the promised land of the holy ghost my wow what a thought well god's god's word is so powerful because remember 40 years is like a time of detention right or discipline or test see like a school master putting a student in a timeout or detention god put israel in detention for 40 years and then he judged them and he cut them off all right yeah just make sure i got all that all right i'm gonna do it on time okay i got about 11 more minutes we'll try to that should be good by god's grace now what most people don't realize is that god put a pause or he put a gap from the time of the 62 weeks or the 69 weeks god put a pause there there's currently a 2000 year pause or gap between the ending of the 69 69th week when jesus was crucified and the beginning of the 70th week or the last seven years now again this is different than i've ever thought when i was writing this chapter in this summer it just i totally i felt like i i now understood the time period i understood everything and remember you have quotes brother ram said jesus was crucified in 30 a.d sometimes he says 33 a.d so again we don't make it a major doctrine but i do believe this is the right time period so right now the 69 week is over for israel and god put a pause there before he starts that 70th week that last seven weeks god paused it and said i'm going to get myself a people for my namesake praise god my people israel they turn down my name so i'll get a people that love my name praise god i'll get a gentile wife praise god i divorced israel i put her away except for a little small remnant right that and they're part of the one church the one bride right he said i'm gonna get me a people for my name's sake praise god thank god okay now let's read these are some beautiful scriptures church uh my go to hosea 3 verses 4 and 5. malachi hosea daniel hosea so right after ezekiel ezekiel daniel hosea so you find ezekiel daniel then hosea this is a beautiful scripture i just remember smiling as soon as i read this when i was writing the chapter hosea hosea foretells this pause or this gap of 2000 years so beautiful hosea 3 malachi versus 4 and 5. can you read that ready is wow that's powerful to me look at that it was hosea 5. now since i'm there let me look up the the year that was written nah that was written 7 80 bc this is almost this is over 200 years after david look at that church they're going to seek they're going to seek the lord and david david's been dead for 200 years amen he said for many days they won't have a prince a king a sacrifice right it's being fulfilled but when will it happen in the latter days amen in the last days they're going to come and seek their king hallelujah king jesus hallelujah ah that's beautiful man that's one of the most powerful scriptures there see that agrees with paul paul said god is able to graft them back in he's able but right now they don't have it but he has to wait until the fullness of the gentiles be come in praise god that's beautiful hallelujah what a revelation hosea 3 verses 4 and 5 are now to me this is rock solid i don't know why i ever thought it was 3380. i really don't know and i haven't really gone back to my notes because it was so fresh when it came to me this summer but anyways now let's look at this now most people believe there's only three and a half years of the tribulation i believe there are seven years of tribulation the first half though won't be as bad as the last half the last half will be the most awful time ever on the face of the earth okay and here's why the first half is just the the two witnesses interrupting nature right they're just you know turning the water to blood but nothing's really being destroyed yet right there there's there's no rain the bible says there's a famine for three and a half years right water turns the blood but the people are still going on and israel still has her covenant because the antichrist hasn't broken the covenant yet he breaks it in the midst of the last week that's verse 27 daniel 9 27 let's read that so in verse 26 daniel 9 26 the sanctuaries destroyed and that was 70 a.d right now verse 27 he now the he in this verse cannot be christ because our lord would not purposely overspread abominations upon jerusalem right the purpose of this man is to spread his abominations okay and he's going to stop the jewish sacrifices that are restarted when they rebuild the temple that's what the bible says in verse 27 he'll confirm the covenant with many for one week in the midst of the weak he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease okay so israel has to sacrifice animals for three and a half years while moses and elijah are there preparing them to receive christ now here's the thing i don't know i don't know when they're going to rebuild that temple but i imagine it's going to be really fast i don't know if we'll live to see it if we do church we'll have we'll be having we'll be having constant revival here because we'll be like my this is the two prophets are coming the new prophets are coming and people will call us crazy they'll probably block our facebook accounts we'll be so crazy because well this is scripture this is scripture now my thought is we won't see it rebuilt because i just think that would just be too obvious but uh we may we may and here's the reason why jesus said let's read it uh luke 21 i believe it's luke 21 24 let's read it here's the reason i don't think we'll see the temple rebuilt at least now yeah luke 21 24 lydia can you read that for me huh so see that jerusalem is controlled by the gentiles until when the church ages are over so see the gentiles are not going to let who which gentiles is he talking about the muslims right the muslims are going to have control over jerusalem until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled that's why i don't think we'll see the temple rebuilt i think it'll start right after the rapture that's what i think and i think they'll put it up in a matter of months you know they'll probably be up in a matter of months but as soon as the bride goes up satan comes down right because he will let until he be taken out of the way praise god the holy spirit right god is going to let god is going to hold back the antichrist until the holy spirit is taken away from the church right with the church when it's raptured up okay so this he and then going back to daniel 9 27 who is it that confirms the covenant for a week he that's speaking of the antichrist the pope antichrist all right now next in closing here i'm trying to i'm almost really going to close really uh shortly after the rapture the pope antichrist makes a one week or seven year covenant with many world leaders including the sinful part of israel right because only 144 000 are going to get the holy ghost right now they got 2 million people in israel most of them are sinners but there's a small little remnant that can't wait to sacrifice and pray and read the scripture and they're on they can't wait to rebuild the temple praise god right they're waiting for king david to come back right a david king a king in the seed line of david right they don't know it's jesus but it's going to be jesus all right now daniel 11 says the covenant is also called a peaceful league and remember paul says the world will be crying for peace and safety so this pope is satan's superman he's going to give them what the people want peace and safety and they're going to make a seven year covenant now you can see it coming up you can see how it's possible with trump now remember how trump had he made peace with four other countries with israel you can see how it's going to be possible it's going to be possible now of course it's not because they love each other it's because of money right it's increasing their finances and their trade and their and their their economies it's helping their economies it's not helping their hearts so see the pope will deliver on peace and safety at the time of the rapture but the 144 thousand will not bow to the pope's flatteries the bible said he's going to make the league through flatteries all right and at the same time in this last week the two witnesses will be causing the rain to stop and they'll turn the water to blood that's what the scripture says three and a half years or the first half of daniel's 70th week their ministries match old testament moses and elijah and i think it'll be those two men myself that's what i since elijah didn't die i think he's gonna have to die that's just my opinion but i think it's gonna be the literal men themselves okay but now the worst judgments happen after that three in the second half of the week and that's according to revelation 7 3. malachi can you read revelation 7 7 3. revelation 7 3 so that first half of the week there's not too many bad things that are going to be happening because they're going to have like a peaceful covenant but then the antichrist breaks it in the middle of the week revelation 7 okay so the 144 000 can't receive the holy ghost till after they see the two prophets resurrected then they're going to know that what they were preaching was the right thing it was jesus christ see and then they'll get the baptism the holy ghost after they get the baptism in the holy ghost now this is interesting sometimes brother says the 144 thousand have to be martyred sometimes he says they're saved but either way in revelation 15 the next time we see them after they're on mount zion with jesus we see them standing on the sea of glass mingle with fire and they have harps and they're singing songs to moses and the lamb of god amen ah what a picture the late the sea of glass was the washing right it was the labor that the the priests would wash before they would go in the holy place so in heaven god is bringing the 144 thousand closer to the throne but first they've got to go through this sea of glass right they got to go through the sea of glass and they're singing praises to god and the lamb they're making their way closer to the throne of god amen but if we die right now in christ or if we're raptured we go straight to the throne of god amen but israel has to experience this transition right coming closer because they were blinded to christ oh it's what a what a picture well it's such a great mystery mine oh my in the middle of the week the pope causes the israel sacrifices to cease this is the end of the two prophets ministries they're slain by satan but they're raised from the dead three and a half days later in the sight of their enemies a great earthquake strikes jerusalem a tenth of the city falls seven thousand people die in israel seven thousand die through an earthquake i think what two thousand died at nine eleven two thousand died at nine eleven when the towers fell here seven thousand are gonna die in jerusalem the 144 thousand see god's power and the bible said they give god glory because of the power of the resurrection and that's the sixth and final rapture now daniel 12 11 says after one month one month after the covenant's broken rome sets up an abomination in israel's temple as the pope sits on the temple claiming that he is gods let's read that daniel 12 11 lydia daniel 12 11. i'm keeping you girls busy and that'll keep you busy tonight daniel 12 11. see it's after a month they set up this abomination of desolation see it's all buddy buddy for the first three and a half years right but then he breaks the covenant he wants jerusalem he because he knows satan knows that's where the city is going to be he wants to try to take over and put up his own kingdom in jerusalem but jesus is going to stop him praise god lydia go ahead yep there you go see remember the the first three and a half years was 1260 days well after 1290 days that's when the pope comes in the temple said you need to worship me i'm god he's going to sit in the temple as he is god the bible said he don't last long after that the bible said that israel kills him after that not long after that yep then rome and her allies send their armies to destroy israel but god will fight for his covenant people praise god amen zechariah 12 9 says and it shall come to pass and that that day i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem in their darkest hour jesus comes and destroys the armies according to zechariah yep according to zechariah there okay now it's not long after this that the 144 000 are revealed to uh i'm sorry or have christ revealed to them and they weep and mourn from house to house and they get born again the bible said the nation is born in one day washing away their blindness that's when daniel's uh so that's when gabriel's vision is fulfilled right there praise god the end of transgression all those things are done when jesus comes remember the bible said they weep and mourn from house to house there's a fountain open in the house of david praise god amen this is the best i know of the events by god's grace okay now during the last three and a half years here's the last things i'm going to say here the wrath of god is poured out upon the beast worshipers who rejected jesus christ remember the bible said they'll try to hide themselves in caves and mountains and dens but the bible said they won't be able to escape death they'll try to die but they won't be able to die because god's going to torment them for rejecting the holiness of jesus christ thank god we can live holy today praise god because they don't want to be holy they they don't care about holiness they can't even repent of their sins the bible says so they're worthy of the worst judgments during this time we see it plainly the seven trumpets are blown in the second half of the 70th week revelation 8 9 and 11 all those uh trumpets fall upon mankind right after this the seven last plagues and vials are poured out according to revelation chapters 15 and 16. praise god my and then jesus comes back for armageddon the bible said every eye on earth sees him and they wail at him so that must be after he took up the 144 thousand then he comes back but this time he comes back with fire in his eyes and everybody wails because he's coming to judge and the bible said when the battle of armageddon begins christ defeats the pope antichrist remember he speaks the word and a sword comes out of his mouth superbook did a good job on that battle boy that was powerful that was a good imagination that they tapped into he comes out and jesus you know satan is like a little he's like a huge massive serpent right we probably won't be like that but anyways they they come against the the white army and the sword comes out of his mouth and destroys all who gather themselves to defy jesus christ but again the word of god prevails because the word of god is sharp and quick and alive amen hallelujah nothing can defeat god's word amen no matter how many armies no matter how much devil power you got nothing defeats god's word amen hallelujah and then jesus takes the pope antichrist and the the spirit of the beast the antichrist spirit and cast both of them alive into the lake of fire what a picture that's going to be that's at the end of the battle of armageddon and the bible said we the bible said we must remain there in heaven because then jesus calls for fire and the remember the volcanoes burst right volcanoes burst uh brother said it might even be atomic fire and it burns the whole outer core or outer crust of the earth and let's close with malachi 4 1-3 so maokai you're mauka maokai read maokai four one through three this is where the earth is healed malachi 4 three and the church said amen let's stand to our feet what a picture of healing after all these evil armies are gathered now remember some of them are going to live right because during the millennium there's got to be a few nations build up and then eventually they populate the earth but many of those armies those demon armies jesus's word comes out it it strikes him and burns up like fire all around the earth and the bible said once that fire dies down a little bit then we come down to earth and we start walking upon the ashes of the wicked and jesus starts healing i imagine i imagine jesus will go first he'll start walking and you'll start seeing all the ashes turn to green right everywhere he walks it's just gonna start healing the earth praise god we'll walk a little bit on ashes and pretty soon we'll see the healing spread all around the world the bible says that and the bible says we're going to be like calves in a barn what do they do they just eat all day and we're just going to be with jesus all day we'll be sitting learning from jesus in the millennial temple the temple's now anointed oh my can you imagine that we'll all go to the temple jesus will be there the holy holy fire will fall from heaven and nobody can go in the temple because of the glory of god amen praise god amen i can't wait to be there praise the lord and everything is healed now and then we just get to sin the temple after the spirit clears out you know we'll send the temple and each and just each and every day just feast on god's word just like cavs we'll stay in his presence feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man praise god i didn't hear you thank you jesus wow what a time we don't want to miss it church don't miss it for anything praise god let's live holy now let's love jesus christ now let's love the lamb now praise god and when he comes we'll be his children he'll take us away from this place amen musicians you can come the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings praise god boy does this earth need healed church my does it need healed right now but it's got to go through some more judgments first thank god though we'll be spared we're trusting in that we know god's word can never fail our faith is in that we've got thus saith the lord in that we've got the word of the lord from god's prophet also in the bible as well along with brother branham we have thus saith the lord on these things thank god for his mercy let's bow heads here for a moment church we just want to be ready remember why brother man preaches to show this part doesn't belong to us right now there's a pause there's a gap in this between the 69th and 70th week there's a gap and inserted is a time for jesus to get a bride a bride for his namesake and lord willing since i'm done with this chapter we'll look at the next chapter paul gives us five things the bride has to do to be ready and you know him if i start naming them wash by the waters of the world right obey your husband and all things all these things a natural woman has to do we have to do as well as a bride i'm going to say jesus wash me tonight so i'm ready for your heart let's pray your heavenly father we thank you god for this word that we've heard tonight what a beautiful revelation you've gave to your prophet lord that we can preach it we can hear it and we can know the order of events the lord the

you jesus we'll be with the angels in heaven and the royal chambers of heaven we won't be here on the earth as you reveal yourself to your 144 000 brethren lord we're so thankful to be on your side
