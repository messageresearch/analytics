[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hey oh no not Riga oh hey let's hear ours we can stand here tonight let's mount up Daniel chapter 8 here by the grace of the Lord coming down to the end here by God's grace till about five more chapters okay four more chapters after this tonight Daniel chapter 8 I think 10 and 11 and 12 10 11 are the most mysterious to me I felt ready chapter 18 was it as mysterious as I thought because it basically interprets the vision for us so we're very thankful that brother grant makes numerous statements at all of us don't understand that so Daniel chapter 8 I just want to read one verse here so sorry two versus Daniel 8 I want to read verse 2021 this will tell us who the RAM and the he-goat are these visions majesty and visions and you see lightning a tears and leopards and beasts and Rams that with all these things fighting it yet Daniel Saad was faithful to deliver the Word of God to to his people please now let's just read these verses verse 20 the RAM which I saw is having two arms are the kings of media and Persia and the rough go is the king of Grisha and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first key it God has blessings readings word maybe see the microspheres smell if I can switch over sir if you'd like to I told the last time out finished chapter 7 I knew there was at least a couple of quotes where brother have talked about changing laws and time so we're Daniel chapter 8 but we were to go back and just hit a couple verses in Daniel chapter 7 here's there's the vision that he sees you know he sees the go and the rat he sees the RAM first then he sees the he-goat then they fight ended up the goat wins which he knows that the Greeks you know we'll go over that just a moment by the grace of the Lord um but I told you let's finish 7:25 so you got your Bibles you know 7:25 there's a few scriptures FDA okay and I I just knew I just thought there was got to be a couple quotes oh by the way I mentioned verse 25 so there is I just found one quote I searched every word I could about one quote I sure that just a minute now if you Lydia just read fungicide in but Adam that's okay it's just about that okay you read verse 25 sir 725 and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into until a time and times and the dividing of time okay thank you now this is speaking of the little horn that rose up out of the fourth beast so Rome and a little horn of course you know would be the Antichrist the person the Antichrist remember he's also called the false prophet Revelation chapter 20 he's got a few different names there's one scripture where even causing the Beast we know there's also a separate beast you know spirit of Rome you know we know that - so gotta be careful with that anyways I told you last time I look up quotations about wearing out the Saints and changing of laws when I looked up where out there were sixteen kids but none of them about Daniel from brother branham saying to the Most High there's one hit but it wasn't about Daniel changing times 60 hits without about Daniel times and laws there's one hit about Daniel's I thought one quote about chapter 7 verse 25 okay I just read that here's the quote though it's from 1962 the influence of another he's basically showing the mark of the beast and unionised religion in this quote the effects of the vision upon the prophet oh my caused him to confess that he was a sinner anointed prophet he said I'm a man of unclean lips wrong I've done wrong a monthly myself he was a sinner unless speaking of Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 6 he's confessed his sin yes sir cause the prophet of God the confessed that he was a sinner that's what the vision does some Dedede PhD will laugh at it supposed to be some hierarchy of the church you hear what the Cardinal said what the newscaster day he said there was some that teaches the return of the Lord is coming soon and he says of course we'll have to get rid of that bunch we want a new nice world religion just exactly so brother I've heard a car a Cardinal which is the Catholic Church's pitcher from the Catholic Church say they want to unionize religion program said just exactly said you people don't use all the sleep night that's what's happening to many people day to fall asleep but we're the children of the day time amen we're not going to fall asleep we're going to keep our eyes on the prize amen but man said the thing is closer than you think this spell is just about that one that doesn't know Joseph see the Rose upon Pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph there's a race of American president that don't know Christ we've already had a couple of race up there's going to want the race up that really don't know and watch coming they're just as tricky as it could be they got the hold right there the last place where they more of an image to it speaking of the work outs of churches by taking the Confederation of church and make it just speak just the same as the beasts did and give it power to persecute all the guys equal and will change the times and laws of God okay so there's exact quote from Daniel 7:25 so programs telling us that the power of role will raise up in the United States which we already knows in Revelation 13 and it will come into the world council churches and that will change the times and laws just exactly what it says he said look into that later you said anyhow all right now remember do you remember how brother had said the temptation will come remember that I thought we might just read it here tonight in case we did remember it alright how to make this fullscreen okay there we go that's how you good I'm sorry it's so small I'm sorry I thought it'd be bigger than that they might know how to change that say about full screen mode that didn't work okay so about that I'll just read it you know I was there now grant Johnson how the temptation will come the ecumenical blue loop that is started or what seemed such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might see what becomes so strong politically that's why I said watch watch Trump what's these guys he's all buddying up with the evangelicals and you know that man's a sinner but married three times America owns he own strip clubs you know he's a sinner he's making his money off of filth no he's wrong I don't care how nice he acts to people it's just a show until he repents and cast on all that nonsense and there he's becoming all buddies with evangelicals you see him dying Saudi Arabia you know where he's going next the Vatican oh this could be l5 you be closer top might not be but he's making friends he's going to be making her to the Vatican and it's also going to Jerusalem know that go to his real mess watch this church this this could be it I don't know we never know but it's really striking that the u.s. is starting to make more close ties with Israel and with the Vatican that's really striking because that's prophecy amen it becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure from the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adhere to the principles enacted into law see there's the law we just read that Daniel 5 which are 725 changing the laws so American law is going to change something with politics and churches so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council little groups will lose charters well we'll just plan to lose it I don't even know if I have a charter I have to jack privileges etc until they lose all property we don't have any properties you have nothing to lose and spiritual rights with the people that's all we could lose our ability to minister to the people for example right now unless the local Minister associate approves at many in fact most cases one cannot rent a building for religious services weekend they don't check art they don't check our beliefs to rent this this building to become chaplains and the armed services Adam I'm talking over to the other day hospitals and centers almost now mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will be harder to resist or to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they won't feel it's better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization that did not serve at all God all publicly but they air to believe the devil's go levels lies to serve say even though you may want to call Java but the elect will not be to see a bet you see that church we have to be willing to lose everything just stay with the word don't join any fellowship for nothing like that anything that transgresses God's words stay away from a man I still love the people you know you still love them and still say hi to them and you'll pray for them and things like that but they got to come out of that furthermore the elect will not only be cut but as this move becomes the image back to the beast the Saints will be gone in the rapture amen we are going to see that blue politically politics of laws are going to change that's what the Bible just said he's going to change times and laws we've got to stay true to guys many men and this little delightful winds the movement that started out with the fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster seat that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant is coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious tract or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling wherever they would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the Harless daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime the Romans acquired here they all the supplies of gold the Jews have all the bonds and all the paper at the right kind the harlot will destroy the present-day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold assistant fails the Jews will be trapped and coming to Lions and the auto church will take over the world whole world alright that's how the temptation is going to come but again it tells us that's how it's going to cut rubber so thankful to know that praise God we have to be willing to lose the nothing that we already have you don't have nothing so we'd have to have enough to be scared of all right Jeff drinks on come one vote that's the quote I've got ties that quote changing of times of laws into the move of politics and the World Council of Churches okay now chapter 8 I got most of my notes from the Holden Study Bible which is sundowners you know just like Scofield in it they're really good stuff I took it all back to brother Brandon you got taking all that Chronos quotes and said this said chapter 8 took place in 550 BC two years after the visions of chapter 7 this is two years later and in the Bible in the Bible the Bible actually says chapter 7 was his first vision which is interesting I never thought that till reading that yesterday so chapter 8 is the second vision which is interesting the first vision was chapter 7 chapter 8 the second vision Daniels about 70 years old at this time see you see how this is Heiser this morning his service increases he got older amen that's why would my prayer be out yet let my service to Christ increases I get older amen let me do more for Jesus all right so chapter what sorry chapter 8 apartment verse 1 it says in the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar vision appeared unto me even though to me Daniel after which appeared unto me at the first chapter 7 was his first vision chapter 8 was the second vision all right now Lydia chapter 2 verse 2 daughters when I started I was at Shushan in the palace which is in the province along and I saw in a vision and I would by the river thank you so Daniel was in Shushan now it's called also called Susa by the river you lie it's about 200 miles northeast of Babylon which is modern-day Iran so here's where Babylon was and Daniels really hope she's right here in xuxa day Iran there Jerusalem you know he's quite a ways holy they just to kind of give you an idea where he's at by the grace Lord modern day Iran now brother had agreed for me sir you read verses out three four five please then I lifted up my eyes and so lo and behold there's Fez before the river a ram we had two horns and two horns were I the one was higher than the other and a higher came up laughs I saw the left I saw the Rams fishing westward and northward and southward so that no beast may stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his well and became great and as I was considering behold and he goat came from the West on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a noble Horn dies hey that thank you sir appreciate that okay so here's he's here and sees this vision we just talked about now in verses 3 & 5 oh that I've just read it the RAM with the two horns is interpreted verse 20 it's called the medo-persian empire the ego or rough goat it's called the rough goat and rich 21 was the king of grisha or the ancient Greeks the great horn was the first king which the first king of the ancient Greeks was Alexander the Great alright so here's the picture again the he-goat he was all the ramp first Rams actually first the he goes second so we have the medo-persians and then we have the the Greece which which Daniel's already seen visions of these this just gives him more information about it all right so let me uh remember the he-goat was the Greek okay RAM and go remember this Ram goat so they're given two different animals right the Medes and Persians is called a ram and a bear it's also called a leopard indigo which is interesting God just does that no that's what was happening so Danny would already see that chapter 2 he'd seen this in Chapter 7 and then in chapter 8 he sees the Medes of Persians as we said it has a ram and then he sees the ancient Greeks as a goat it's a little bit you know a bit confusing but that's what the Bible says so again we have Daniel Chu he sees this 70 sees this that was revelation 13 member they're all combined into one beast there in Revelation is it's all the Deen all the demons that were these powers are now in the in Rome right now alright that makes sense by God's grace oh that's okay if you're one of these notes I can just send you the email you know to help you out we're going to go over it study it so verses 5 to 8 mm read 5 how am i doing on time alright creaking I want to get through this in about hours I think I'll be able to do this remember of verse 5 to go or the Greeks move so fast that it did not cut up to growl which is a reference to the Swift speedy clock conquest of the entire Near East in only three years and you can lift this up in any encyclopedic I looked it up in the Botanica it's true the Greeks took over the world in three years so the Bible called that moving with no feet just flying and that's a fast army to three years to take over the whole world basically and the Greek Empire to feed the mesial needle persians in 331 BC that was in verse 7 so let's reverse 7 this is where of course the goat defeats the RAM in other words this isn't how I was into the green verse 7 and I saw him come closer to the Ravan II was Lou with collar against him and smoke the ram and break his two horns and there was no cloud on the RAM to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon it there was none that could deliver the ran out of his hand now look at verse 8 therefore then the he-goat wax very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and four heads came up four notable ones toward the winds of heaven all right so in verse eight at the height of the goats power ooh this goat the Greeks just conquered the Medes and Persians right at the height of the goats power the great horn was broken which is a reference to Alexander's sudden death at peak of hardening peach peach honey thinks that that's embarrassing at the peak of his greatness hurt me look peach I don't even have any peach yesterday nor that going for barmy whoops at the beaches great Oh 323 BC so he conquered them and look just 88 years later eight years later he dies and you know why he died because he had nothing left to conquer he thought he had arrived and so he got drunk and died from an alcoholic overdose see how we always need to battle the fight Church and see how we always need something to do and work for the Lord always got something to do something it better something to prove you know stuff to do for God amen that's what program tells leave this program tells us I thought about Christ Christ is the body buddy conquer here is the one Christ who conquered both worlds of the scene unseen not like Alexander who conquer the world age of 33 I knew no other way to turn for further conquest so he died a victim of sin righteously goodness Greer's you know he took over the whole world he waited a few days just kind of getting drunk drunk drunk i'm dinah dinah down the hall at the age of 33 and christ died as god's sacrifice at the age of 33 both were conquerors but only one died in the faith they may men Christ was the mighty Conqueror how did he go it is interesting he both died at 33 having conquered everything but see how example was only natural contouring not spiritual even a Christ was spiritually met now in verse 8 the four notable ones if you go back in history you can search us out of the reddit last night if you want look it up the four notable ones were actually when Alexander's Kingdom was divided by four of his generals this is all historic Cassandra over Macedon and Greece by side matches over Grace and Asia Minor Celie yuccas over Syria Babylon and commlink over Egypt and that's historical you can find that in the you look up ancient Greek you'll find that in the Britannica now in verses 9 to 12 a little horn emerges from this he go the ancient Greeks so after Alexander the Great dies there comes up another great ruler but he's a little horn which historians believe was in Antiochus the 4th ruler of the cell uses dynasty dynasty who conquered southern and eastern lands and also the pleasant land in verse 9 it says he hid conquered the pleasant land of Israel he brutally stabbed upon the Jewish people from 170 to 164 BC it was one of the most brutal persecution of Jews and a halt but it lasted six years it was said Antiochus blasphemously presented himself as the Prince of the host or God himself stopping the daily sacrifice and defining the temple jerusalem in 167 BC now this is absolutely historical because every year which is this is kind of funny every year for Hanukkah December I show the Hanukah video to my class because I have to teach all the religions of a summer so I show a video about Christmas and Hanukkah all these other ponds you know different things like that and every year I show the Hanukkah video and Antiochus is on every there's on that video every year this is all historical it's purely historical so my first graders the last ten years have been learning about antique it's now they probably forgot it right away at least they got to see it so the he's the little that rose up at the ancient Greeks he's a little horn the first King died right away without him to drink but one of the little arms rose up Antiochus now verses 9 to 12 officer I want to make this I want to make this point the little horn of this chapter chapter 8 which was Antiochus the fourth must not be confused with a little Horn of chapter seven verse eight because the little Horn of chapter seven was from the fourth beast the little horn were talking about right now is from the third Beast okay so they're both called little horns you gotta watch that description we leave a little horn is the future Pope that will become the person headed Christ so the little horn of chapter 7 is the Pope Antichrist the little part of chapter 8 is Antiochus because it's from the 3rd Empire not the fourth the fourth is roll third was Greeks so this want to lay that in there so you don't confuse it like I said to sell out to study but we got to study history praise God now verses 13 to 14 let's read those would someone like to read my columns gracious if anyone else like to read came out kind I don't impress you so she goes huh you have to realize them one time you read it so you don't know don't feel like you have to now guys you wanted okay 13 or 14 Daniel 8 13 good buddy then I heard once Saint speaking and another say sinks that certain sangwich space which spake how long have them feed how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice in the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host be trodden under foot and you send to me unto 2300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed all right so just to just teach little more on that Antiochus was called that little horn and in the vision it told Daniel this little horn is going to rain for 2300 days and that's historical as well so Antiochus the file he defiled the Temple of Jerusalem he defiled God's temple and he took the daily sacrifice away for that many days until the temple was rededicated by Judas Maccabee and he was on the video I showed that you're lucky I haven't on my school computer I can show it to you guys sometime if you like and this happened in 164 BC this event is still celebrated by Jewish people today during the feast of Hanukkah which is called the feast of light let me know that God's grace so if you remember that story and Tiye kiss you know was ruling he persecution of the Jews he took over the temple in Israel but Judah Maccabee had no roof I was like we got to get the temple back and so he did he led like it is called like guerrilla warfare that's with a britannica called it he raised up an army and they defeated the Greeks and they took back the temple they tore down the history says they went to the temple after they defeated the Greek army and they were crying because there was idols in the temple and then to purge it out and you know the story they dedicated the temple shortly after that after cleaning it up but they're running out of oil for the dedication but they prayed and God that the oil lasts for seven days it is a miracle and that's the miracle of Hanukkah do you remember that by God's grace you learn at school that's it's a it's a it's a well no miracle of people deny it but they know it's true Jews know it's true amen and Jesus celebrated the feast of Hanukkah if you want to go to John chapter 10 you know that let's go to John chapter 10 so how'd it go something that Jesus vindicated Jesus went to the temple and he taught on Solomon's porch on the feast of Hanukkah Daniel 10 22 23 I'm sorry not Daniel 10 worst enemy John 10 John 10:22 forgiveness and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was winter see because they celebrated in December and Jesus walked through the temple in Solomon's porch and he began teaching and they they said how long does I'll make us doubt if that would be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus said I told you already you believe me not he had already told if he said I and my father are one he said those bailey's that I already told you even he said but the works that I do prove that the Son of God so see if there is a Hanukkah he's preaching to other people I am got some internet so Jesus recognized this end of the 2300 days Jesus recognized it by celebrating the feast of dedication it was Hanukkah so Judah Maccabee the star - he defeated those Greek soldiers and he rededicated the temple and it's called the feast of Hanukkah today that was the end of the 2300 days all right let's go to verses 15 and 17 I'm getting warm your partner Lydia would you read 15 16 and 17 [Music] I heard a man's voice - thanks lie which is we just called it Gabriel make the audience understand division he 72,000 here we're expert in one he can lie with His grace and fell upon my face and he said it but he said unto me understand us on us in grateful family and should be all right thank you now here's I get to understand this next part I had to lay this in here Gabriel's commanded to make Daniel understand the vision see how angels play an important part in the lives of prophets we're listening to programs life story by open jorgensen and the angels are starting to get more involved in brother branham's life it's beautiful to hear that because it's just like the Bible the angel remember the angels or you Daniel the angels or the Moses the angel God is always with the prophet of God remember that bro did you know applaud a ninja brother and do you know that okay I'm going to read that real quick that'd be okay all right I just wanna make sure he gets that by God's grace let's go to the book of Acts and I'll look it up here yeah there's a 27:23 so Paul's in the ship and they're all going they're all scared with all these prisoners you want the prisoners and they all think they're going to die y'all think they're going to sink Paul had a meeting with his angel that night yeah romance at the bottom of the boat he was praying a Amy came to visit and he come up on the top of the boat he said fear that he said stay in the ship and you're gonna live now here's what he said where there's good me but I need this night the angel God who's I am and whom I serve amen amen see every prophet of God has an angel to them all right New Testament actually right that's exactly right praise the Lord so I just want to show you that by God's grace I don't know how to do that I want to lay that in there they'll be very helpful to him to know that now Gabriel told Daniel the vision was for the time of the end now this meaning meaning this vision of the little horn and tifos had a compound prophecy the temple was rededicated in 164 BC or about 386 years after this vision and so 164 BC was not the time of the end or end of days but just the end of this vision here on the end of the 2300 days now here's where brother Branham quotes will start coming in Antiochus was a tight or free figure of the end time Antichrist that's why Daniel 8 is important to us the Pope who will exalt himself above all the telegin in the temple of God so until his did the same thing he called himself God at the temple of God and history and both history and brother brand recognized Antiochus as a pre figure of the Antichrist the hope that's why this chapter is important to us especially important so when the Abril says this into the time of the end he means the time of the end of Antiochus but also the time of the end to the tribulation when the Anti Christ upon the earth so it's a compound prophecy can we see that hope you can see that by God's grace now verses 18 to 22 all right brother madame curie 18 to 19 better now as he was speaking with me i was a deep sleep on my face towards the ground but he touched me and set me an upright and he said if old I will make thee know what shall be in the last and last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end of jumpy thank you every 23 one this was our text the RAM which sour sauce having the two R's are the kings of media Persia and the rough goat is the king of Grisha and the Green Hornet's between his eyes is the first king I was Alexander the Great verse 22 now that thing broken what the goat I'm sorry now more now examine the great now that being broken whereas for stood up for it number the four generals bored kingdoms are standing up out of its on the nation but not in his power there's what we get the end of the vision of the RAM and ego would be at the time appointed by the 2300 days the RAM or Medes ruled from 539 to 331 BC if I pull those up right out of pretending while the he drove he go he goat sorry goat Greece ruled from 321 that's the year that all tentative started concrete that's when he conquered the means to 27 BC so Greek ruled a little while there and that was when ancient Rome became an official Empire you read about rough or Rome or Babylon which I wrote Rome started around 500 BC but it didn't become an empire until 27 BC history says that as well so this falls on a perfect order with Daniels vision from Daniel chapter 2 for Kingdom stood up out of the nation and those were the four kings who took report generals who took over after Alexander but did not rule in Alexander's power right because they weren't Alexander they ruled in their own power okay now verse 23 and 24 next button can you read verse 23 method and a lot of times their Kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full aquinnah fierce countenance that I understand dark sentences shall stand up all right now gable mentions notice their king of that's the Greek the Greeks will have a king of fierce countenance which was believed to be a further description of Antiochus the fourth member there kena now verse 24 lady kiri 24 now and his power shall be mine even that lady's own power these are the strong wonderfully and shall prosper in carcass and shall destroy the mighty okay my mother still talking about the Greeks still talking about the Greeks so he's telling more about Antiochus Antiochus his power would not be his own but rather from Satan he killed many mighty I'm sorry he killed many mighty and holy people there's another typo let me fix it like anybody wants this by an email result like that has to make sense okay good which were the Jews the Jews were the holy and mighty people all right now verse 25 is here's where we're getting into brother and his quote he just said I think we did have two quotes on this but happy 325 for me say thank you very and though this policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand any show magnify himself in his heart and five peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes princes but he shall be broken without hand hey thank you sir now this is course speaking of Antiochus and he just did all these things but just as Antiochus did I misspelled his name to my goodness the future Pope Antichrist will have policy or politics right laws - chief - cause craft to prosper which Lorraine says is manufactured so people say oh we're going to go into depression well the Bible makes it sound like crafts gonna prosper it's the age of laodicean I'm not saying you know there's little receptions here and there right you know but this is the age of having rich increase with goods but having needed nothing having no no more need of God and the boat will magnify itself in his heart by peace you will destroy penny and will stand up against the Prince of princes Jesus Christ but we broke without hand a brother grandma also believed this compound prophecy of Antiochus and the future Pope Antichrist let's read that I know it's kind of the church I know a little bit deep but I said if you want the quotes you can go back over them again or study it I know it's a little bit deep here's the quote why am I getting organized religion don't watch all these gimmick workers but remember they're only speaking a bogus dollar holy speaks than a real one somewhere when you see this organization stuff growing and prospering as it said crafts would prosper in his hand just remember there's a little Church of God somewhere really is Holy Ghost filled genuine that's moving up the ladder don't look at the big organization there's two quotes on prospering with crafts this is the first one so Manson never look at a big organization but a lot much state transfer no matter how much money they have and whatever more be that little group that loves the Holy Ghost a man though don't be attracted by big groups and big money you don't like that stay with the word amen now the second time he quotes it is in the first seal about crafts and prospering now Antiochus did the same thing that the future Antichrist will do he prospered through a craft and peace he brought false peace and he brought a false crap also wealth here through manufacturing here's a program said after the churches taken away here and then about that earlier in the rapture Roman the Jews will make a covenant with one another the Bible said they would with the holy people and now notice they'll make it because why the nation is going to be busted and we already are what's the debt now anybody with the debt set enough last time I looked it was like eighteen trillion what's that now same window 22 well and they all they all condemned each other for the debt and nobody does anything about it that's called I don't know what that's called insanity he has not attended this nation is going to be busted and the rest of the world that's on the gold standard is busted you know you know that if we're living off of taxes due bills forty years from now where are we at there's only one thing could happen that's to call the currency if they off the bottles and we can't do it Wall Street owns that Wall Street is controlled by the Jews the rest of us in the Vatican and the Jews has got the rest of it in Wall Street with the Commerce of the world he said like this fella down here what's the Dave Castro hit he done the only smart thing ever did do then he destroyed the bonds paid them off and destroyed that notice but we can't do that these guys won't let us the rich merchants of the earth hold it and there's only one thing to do the Catholic Church can pay it off which is our nation's thins talking about she's the only one that's got the money she can do it and she will do it sometimes houses she will do it and in doing this to get it she'll compromise with the Jews and make it covenant and when she makes his coming with the Jews now remember I'm taking this from the scriptures and now when she does this and makes this covenant we noticed in Daniel 8 23 and 25 he will cause craft to prosper and craft is manufacturing so see there has to be some connection between the economy and the Vatican and the Jews because the Bible said they'll make crafts to prosper and remember in Revelation 18 when all the princes are crying because the Vatican's being destroyed their cries because there they had all this connection economically to the Vatican so I don't understand it the closest thing I've ever heard understanding it is that a lot of Catholics own major companies and corporations that's the only thing I can that's the closest I can get you know outside of conspiracy theories you know what's up there's so many of those you know it's hard to know but I can see something I can prove and if I can't prove it I don't really see much about it but the Bible said there's some connection between the Roman Catholic Church and the economy so I don't know just be like be the most logical thing you know like program setting you know controlling the Wall Street and the money and the big companies it must be that way I'm not quite sure alright so he quoted Daniel 8:23 through 25 so see brother grab this is about Antiochus by history but it's also a compound prophecy because number Antiochus was in the temple claiming that he was God that's what 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 says that the emmett price will sit the temple of God claiming that he is God that's exactly right so what that recognizes this can we see that now he goes on program goes on and he makes this coming with the Jews in the midst of this three half years he breaks his covenant as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and takes get the money of the Jews tied up and when he does that oh my oh my he's he's called the Antichrist to the other church age for he is and he had assured our against Christ and the word this is called the Antichrist now he's going to hold the money and that's where I think he'll come in his programs thought he never gave us the Upstate Lord he said that's where I think they'll come in and he gave scripture for so that's the best I can do with teaching on that now can I just share something here real quick the Bible said he breaks the coveted the heads of the three and a half years and here's what I believe and I hope you understand this I believe the Pope and the Jews will make a covenant for seven years but in the middle of it they'll break it and that's because that's the end of the three to half years of the Daniel seventy weeks there's only three half years left how do you know that 69 - the years have already been fulfilled Jesus that's 16 out of the weeks I'm sorry the 70th week is seven years but Jesus are you priest read half of that 7 and the Jews come so the Jews will have two prophets priests for how long three and a half years to finish that last half of the last week so that's the way I can understand my scripture that will make after the rapture they'll make a peace covenant for seven years but it'll be broken in the midst of the week but that's right at the end of the last three - half years and that's Jesus comes back and he reveals himself to the Jews and 144,000 are sealed with the father's seal in their Nativity net which is the faxes with the Holy Ghost amen and then the Bible says that the Beast will go to make war against Israel and not see they have a cover for three deaf ears at last three deaf ears but then they come against the fight against Israel see the reason I share that because some people say well the tribulation seven years tribulation three half years all we know by scripture is that after the rapture there's three and half years to the Jews that's what we know why scripture because he had he cuts off the Gentiles raptures the Gentiles and then he grabs back at the Jews for 394 years right and then after that times up for the Jews under 44,000 get sealed and then comes the Battle of Armageddon and comes all these trumpets and vials and all these things at the end and its destruction time and it's time for fire to come down and then it's millenium time don't worry God it's his seventh day he gives a thousand years for this life they met Gloria I'm almost out here let me see [Music] Ray's a little an evening but it's the lord help us okay how's listening to the church ages and Bob Graham says never begin the church is lord help us be ready to stand now because the time is closing in as we see this to our beast rise up out of the earth not how the thickness of vultures of people with horns like a lamb but a steak like a dragon never he's talking about Revelation 13 the Beast in the United States we believe that our is close at hand now father when these churches is Confederated themselves together make it an image into the Beast and it will be terrible on that group Lord that won't join them the very boycott will come but in that hour you promised to take your church you said help us Lord I just want to again show you that's another word for the squeeze it's gonna be kind of kind of like a boycott romance with a boycott of scriptural there's another Court I have on that so see we're coming down to that he's going to change times and laws was going to prosper in his hand this guy is going to be saying he's Superman the Antichrist the Pope alright last few okay so go to verses 26 to 27 let's finish the chapter here I'm looking forward to chapter 9 because I've already preached Daniel 70 weeks I just kind of got a fresh jump on verses up one to nineteen maybe four more by the next week balcony Reapers 26 Lydia your choice in elevation of the evening and the morning which was told is true or for shuttle up division for a chubby for many days amen freeze done okay so see what the other shows us the effects of visions upon prophets I have a quote I don't have it ready on the slideshow but I have over brother Branham said when Jesus said the greater works shall these do then I've done brother Branham said because jesus said that he said I'd be able to have more visions than Daniel and all those he said because one vision would sit him down for how many days he faint one vision and brother may have visions all the time right but he wasn't painting all the time because Jesus said you'll do greater than those works does that help by God's grace one vision knocked him out for days your brother and you see vision after vision he could do seven in a row 10 the row on the prayer lines and knock knock him out he just get tired because he had a greater power seat because the blood of Jesus Christ is there hallelujah amen the price of FA the power only goes to come the blood of Christ brought more power David so we see Gabriel instructed Daniel to shut down up the vision for it shall be for many days the days of NTIA is for almost 400 years away so the vision had to be shut out for about four more years for that part of the vision but the days of the Pope Antichrist we're about 2500 years away and still counting right because we're still counting the days now that is my last slide let's say my figure like I was mrs. Hannah now my Bible this is my Holmen Bible brought out all these similarities between Antiochus and the Pope the Pope Antichrist let's see there's three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven children that's striking in that striking in this one chapter there's twelve similarities between the Pope and Christ and Antiochus my brother Graham said that's what the that's what that chapter was about I just read you that quote he said the Pope will try to cause craft to prosper thank God for a prophet in the salary so see Antiochus and Antichrist are symbolized by horns that were little at the beginning his number a little horn coming out of the fourth Empire they're both called little arm that's one similarity number two and Jesus looked fierce and Antichrist will have an opposing look yep it's in me ready but we got that Daniel 7:20 I'm I read that again just because I forgot oh yeah right he says even that war that had eyes and a mouth to speak very great things whose look was more stout than his fellow the Antichrist is going to be on posi looking person he's give me a Posey looking Pope that's why I don't think is this one you don't look very imposing I don't mean but it could be I don't know we don't know how much time you have I was said they cast out look Antiochus was a master of entry the brilliance of Antichrist is suggested by the eyes of the horn yeah the boat that both horns have eyes remember both have I have this intrigue about them this mysterious of their ability to deceive that's right Antiochus has great power the Antichrist will have even greater power that's right second Thessalonians 2:9 and in Revelation 13:7 a yep that's exactly right the number gasps yes hard to make a war against the Jews that's right if you don't know that that's a revelation of thirteen seventeen eighty the Antichrist will break the covenant and then fight against the Jews that's exactly right next what and Jesus was energized by Satan just as the Antichrist will be empowered by Satan praise God let me read 2nd Thessalonians 2 real quick I'm almost under now what I'd be great thing there in it previous rest you think that's till chapter 2 verse 9 is 8 members dr. Smith okay even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders amen so they're after the working of Satan so Satan's working through the Antichrist that's what he's doing Antiochus destroyed thousands the Antichrist will destroy more that's right yeah yeah that's in the get some sermons right on that by God's grace and I have almost servants for the whole book of Revelation very Antigua's prospered for a short time likewise the Antichrist for a short time Amen or last very long and he is first you the Jews as will the Antichrist the Pope will persecute the Jews yep Revelation chapter 12 that's right and makes a war against the woman number the woman with the 12 to 12 crowns I'm sorry 12 I mean I'll sure let me go to that revelation 12 my man tells his revelation 12 there's nothing new with the bride it's the Jews okay she's got she's got a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under feet and she's got a crown of 12 stars not 12 crowns a crowd with 12 stars forgive me next Antiochus was a deceiver and advice will be a master deceiver that's right the Bible said he deceives through unrighteousness in other words he lets them stin and tell them they're okay with God that's what we can't do here right guys come against all sin Antiochus was proud Antichrist will be a mega Romania I'm not sure that beats probably a real prideful person I don't know if megalomaniac I'm not sure I don't know Antiochus lasting God as the enterprise he sits in the temple of God saying that he has God he exalts himself above all that's all God which is the word eventually exalts himself above the word and last but not least Antiochus was not killed by human hands and neither will the Antichrist he's killed by the sword that comes out the mouth the price at Armageddon and then he's instantly cast in the lake of fire at that battle so he's not killed by another man he's killed by Christ amen holiday just like Michael beat Lucifer ahead just like Christ defeated Satan on Calvary amen he said it's finished hallelujah he's beaten by Christ okay we stop there you love the Lord's hey man that's hope I hope that's helpful by the grace of the Lord and I got within an hour I must have preached 55 minutes there praise the Lord a good buddy alright so how many love the Lord tonight now these are things like I said these are
