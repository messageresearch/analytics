[24:12] man never
[24:14] [Applause]
[24:15] ever
[24:37] foreign
[25:16] foreign
[25:36] [Applause]
[25:38] [Music]
[25:49] we're fine
[26:03] thank you Jesus
[26:08] hallelujah praise the Lord let's take
[26:10] our Bibles here today it's going to be
[26:11] in the house of the Lord amen beautiful
[26:13] song brother I appreciate that
[26:14] Hallelujah let's go to Exodus chapter
[26:16] 21. I was telling you in July I like to
[26:19] preach on slavery in the Bible so I'd
[26:21] like to preach on that this morning I've
[26:23] had a little more time to study on that
[26:25] and
[26:26] um
[26:27] of course we're going to look at you
[26:28] know we'll finish with the spiritual
[26:29] element to it by God's grace that we
[26:32] want to be the Lord's free man
[26:33] Hallelujah we don't want to be in
[26:35] bondage God has called us to live
[26:37] spiritually free Hallelujah so we can
[26:40] serve God in the beauty of Holiness
[26:42] praise God not in bondage to the things
[26:45] of the world Exodus chapter 21
[26:48] verse one Exodus 21 verse 1.
[26:52] Hallelujah
[26:54] Keisha are all the other ones muted all
[26:57] the other ones thank you
[26:59] appreciate that
[27:02] Exodus chapter 21 verse 1.
[27:06] I know the brother Austin was talking
[27:08] about you know this topic being one he
[27:09] could share so I'm hoping that we'll
[27:12] um
[27:13] we'll get a good recording brother and
[27:15] if you feel led to share it with your
[27:16] friend you could share with your friend
[27:18] by the grace of God
[27:21] those are all great questions you know
[27:22] uh you know really Church you know with
[27:24] a carnal mind the carnal mind cannot
[27:26] understand the things of God
[27:28] so someone who's in darkness you know
[27:31] they're not spiritual they'll read a
[27:32] passage and they'll see something
[27:33] totally that's not even God is not even
[27:36] trying to say
[27:37] but a Believer who's filled with the
[27:39] Holy Spirit can read that same thing and
[27:40] they'll see the truth of God's word
[27:42] they'll see the beauty of God's word
[27:43] they'll see God's love and protection
[27:45] because they have the Holy Spirit praise
[27:47] God
[27:48] but someone who doesn't they cannot even
[27:50] see it because their mind is still in
[27:52] bondage
[27:53] they're under the spirit of Disobedience
[27:55] to the things of the world but we are
[27:57] under the spirit of obedience praise God
[27:59] we're under the spirit of wisdom and
[28:01] knowledge and and uh and might we would
[28:04] say so Exodus chapter 21 verse 1.
[28:09] girl
[28:10] this uh these first 11 verses is kind of
[28:13] a context we'll read it we'll read it in
[28:15] its fullness later on Lord willing
[28:16] during the service but I'll just read
[28:18] the beginning
[28:22] Let's uh why don't we read
[28:25] we'll read one to three okay I'll read
[28:27] one and two and then we'll we'll all
[28:29] join our voices for verse three
[28:31] now these are the judgments which Thou
[28:33] shalt set before them
[28:34] if thou by in Hebrew servant
[28:38] six years He Shall Serve and the seventh
[28:41] he shall go out free for nothing
[28:46] now let's read verse three one two three
[28:48] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[28:53] by himself if he were married then his
[28:57] wife shall go out with him amen
[29:00] so of course this is you know this is
[29:01] even before the I'm sorry this is right
[29:03] after the Ten Commandments were given
[29:05] God is giving Moses instruction once the
[29:09] people get in the land he's saying this
[29:11] is how you're to operate in the land and
[29:14] you're going to see this is God's system
[29:15] of Grace
[29:17] God is very gracious
[29:19] when people go through hard times you
[29:22] know when people would go through hard
[29:23] times God would have a system
[29:24] established so they could get back on
[29:26] their feet it really is a beautiful
[29:28] system it's a it's a system of God's
[29:30] love and his care his compassion let's
[29:33] have one more word of prayer if you have
[29:34] a need on your heart let's make
[29:35] anointing to God here father God we've
[29:37] opened your word we've read your word
[29:38] this word is a light unto our feet and a
[29:42] lamp unto our path we've hidden your
[29:44] word in our heart that we might not sin
[29:45] against you Lord God thank you for these
[29:47] beautiful promises Lord again this topic
[29:49] Lord magnifies your grace Hallelujah and
[29:52] we thank you Lord for the Natural
[29:54] Freedom in America Lord that we have so
[29:57] many men and women bled and died to give
[29:59] us this Natural Freedom so we thank you
[30:01] Lord Jesus for that Lord and father help
[30:04] us as we as we look at this topic Lord
[30:06] to be able to help other people Lord
[30:07] with this topic and Lord ultimately the
[30:10] the end result for us Lord is that we
[30:12] would be spiritually free we would not
[30:14] be spiritual slaves to sin Hallelujah
[30:16] but we will be be your free Sons and
[30:19] Daughters Lord God to serve you in the
[30:21] beauty of Holiness Lord in the freedom
[30:23] and the uh the victory of the Holy
[30:25] Spirit Lord God we pray you Lord you
[30:28] minister to us the Lord God I'm a little
[30:30] nervous but God just help me Lord and
[30:32] God may just yield to your spirit May
[30:33] each person have have a part to play in
[30:35] this service Lord God Hallelujah Lord
[30:38] you said uh the ministers and the laity
[30:40] work together Lord It's a body Ministry
[30:42] let life flow one to another Lord God
[30:45] hallelujah if there's gifts to operate
[30:46] Lord may they operate Lord Jesus and
[30:48] Lord before service during service after
[30:51] service Lord May the gifts of the holy
[30:53] spirit move here God For Your Glory may
[30:55] we all have a personal Revival today
[30:56] Lord Jesus as we've been looking at Lord
[30:58] that beautiful topic Lord God that we
[31:00] can have renewed Minds today Lord God
[31:02] hallelujah we can be free today so Lord
[31:05] we thank you for this freedom in Jesus
[31:07] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[31:10] God bless you as you're being seated
[31:11] praise God
[31:14] so my subtitle will be man-make slaves
[31:18] not God because that's an exact quote
[31:19] from Brother Branham man makes slaves
[31:23] not God
[31:26] all right so we can switch over I got
[31:28] just a few slides we're doing some
[31:30] lengthy Bible reading Lord willing
[31:33] here uh
[31:35] this morning here by God's grace
[31:38] also just so you know this week I've
[31:40] been working on some new uh YouTube
[31:42] videos I don't have them out yet but I'm
[31:43] going to look at the Nephilim
[31:45] Nephilim is the word Giants in Genesis 6
[31:48] 4 there were giants in the earth in
[31:49] those days there was Nephilim in the
[31:52] earth in those days so I'm working on
[31:53] that script I got that done I just got
[31:55] to record it
[31:56] and then the other one I was looking at
[31:57] there's a quote uh brother random says
[32:00] thus saith the Lord if a woman cuts her
[32:02] hair
[32:03] a man can divorce his wife
[32:06] okay now that's all he says but people
[32:08] have asked me about that quote numerous
[32:10] times over the years so I'm making a
[32:11] video about that I'm I'm almost done
[32:13] with the script
[32:15] and of course I've shared it with you
[32:16] and just you know for a for a witness
[32:18] for the uh the live stream
[32:20] any man that would divorce his wife for
[32:22] cutting her hair I question if that man
[32:24] is saved
[32:27] because yes she may have Dishonored him
[32:29] by cutting her hair but has he ever
[32:31] Dishonored her
[32:34] by being angry with her being bitter
[32:36] with her
[32:37] the answer is yes because in marriage we
[32:39] see our best and we see our our worst
[32:44] and of course Satan will take that quote
[32:46] and he will use that quote
[32:49] to to convince Brothers to commit
[32:51] adultery
[32:54] brother random in that quote if you if
[32:55] you look at the quote brother and what
[32:57] he said is true
[33:02] but God at the same time God hates
[33:04] divorce
[33:06] right and if I'm and and in that context
[33:09] when the Bible was written and when uh
[33:11] and even the days of brother Brandon
[33:12] they were just coming out of a time when
[33:14] it was so holy you know America was a
[33:16] holy nation it you know was coming out
[33:18] of that
[33:20] and brother Brown was he was striking at
[33:22] the women he was striking at them
[33:23] telling them
[33:24] it's a shame you cut your hair and the
[33:27] context he was talking about the woman
[33:28] who washed Jesus feet and washed it with
[33:30] his own hair and he said women today are
[33:32] so shameful by cutting their hair he
[33:34] said you'd have to stand on your head to
[33:36] wash Jesus's feet today
[33:38] so in the context brother Adams rebuking
[33:40] American women for cutting their hair he
[33:42] says what shame you have on you this is
[33:44] in 1956 now same year Elvis became
[33:47] really famous that's the year America
[33:49] turned it down too there there's another
[33:50] one I didn't thought I didn't think
[33:51] about that that's your America turned on
[33:53] the Revival
[33:54] because it was 50 years from 1906
[33:58] and if you look at the quote
[34:00] uh it's true because the word dishonor
[34:03] the word dishonor means to bring a great
[34:07] shame
[34:08] it means to be a repulse
[34:11] so a woman that would cut her hair
[34:14] is a repulse to her husband that means
[34:16] like I want to get away that's how much
[34:18] disrespect and shame it is right by the
[34:20] same time a man can disrespect his wife
[34:23] right so brother man is making a point
[34:26] he's driving a point home it is an utter
[34:27] disgrace for a woman to cut her hair and
[34:29] he's preaching it to a group that won't
[34:31] repent of it
[34:32] right and so he's laying out the word of
[34:34] God now also we've got to be very
[34:36] careful what Satan does he will add to
[34:38] that quote
[34:40] it's true what brother random said but
[34:41] Satan will add and see you so we'll
[34:43] we'll yes the man could divorce and then
[34:45] Satan will say well now you can remarry
[34:47] no he can't
[34:49] that if a man would divorce his wife for
[34:52] cutting her hair he is destined to be
[34:54] single till he dies
[34:55] unless his wife he put away dies
[34:58] right and if he marries again he's
[35:00] living in adultery and he's causing uh
[35:02] the woman with him to live in adultery
[35:05] so I'm going to blast that one here
[35:06] pretty soon by God's grace right there
[35:08] because Satan has done that so much in
[35:10] the message because these people they
[35:12] don't study the Bible they don't fall in
[35:13] love with Jesus Christ they might have a
[35:15] partial love for Jesus at the beginning
[35:17] but then they get more in tapes than
[35:18] they do in the Bible and you've got to
[35:20] have a balance her brother said to grow
[35:22] in love for God he said stay in the
[35:23] Bible and read your Bible and pray every
[35:24] day and that's what these people fail to
[35:26] do
[35:28] um anyways I'm gonna I'm kind of I kind
[35:30] of want to blast that pretty hard but uh
[35:31] I guess I kind of did but uh by God's
[35:34] grace we want to uh address that here I
[35:36] want to make a video on that I think
[35:38] it'd be a good topic
[35:39] so a man makes slaves not God God never
[35:42] made slaves uh God God allows it of
[35:46] course as a test remember all your
[35:48] difficulties in life are trials
[35:51] all these difficulties obstacles their
[35:54] tests of your faith and what I love is
[35:57] that God will never give you something
[35:58] that's too difficult and God knows
[36:00] you're going to pass the test praise God
[36:01] whatever you go through whatever he
[36:03] allows in his wisdom to come to pass he
[36:05] knows I have strengthened brother
[36:06] so-and-so I've strengthened sister so
[36:08] and so so much I know when the trial
[36:10] comes they may battle they may fight
[36:12] with it for a few days or weeks but
[36:14] ultimately they're going to get the
[36:16] victory because they are more than a
[36:17] conqueror through Christ Jesus my son
[36:20] amen
[36:21] and church you know I was a brother amen
[36:23] and I were texting this week you know uh
[36:25] we we all go through years of Silence
[36:27] brother Branham says
[36:29] years of silence and I sent brother amen
[36:31] a good uh good quote brother random says
[36:34] that when he's talking about the Widow
[36:35] of xeropath
[36:36] she had seen this three and a half year
[36:38] drought of Elijah go on for one year two
[36:41] years three years
[36:43] and they're crying out for three years
[36:45] where are you God where are you send
[36:47] rain and for three years it seems like
[36:49] God is silent
[36:51] and God lets it go to the very last
[36:54] measure of meal that she had
[36:57] and she's like I'm gonna die this is the
[36:59] last one God so got it for three and a
[37:01] half years God had never intervened and
[37:02] said I'm gonna send you Elijah
[37:05] right but was God loving the whole time
[37:07] you better believe he's a did God but
[37:09] did God have a plan yes God had a plan
[37:12] God had trials
[37:14] you know you've got to allow these
[37:16] trials he was allowing this to test the
[37:18] people to show them that they'd allowed
[37:20] idolatry to rise up in Israel but God
[37:23] thank God he had a prophet amen and he
[37:25] had seven thousand not seven hundred he
[37:27] had seven thousand who not bowed a knee
[37:28] to bail praise God
[37:31] but we make those mistakes all the time
[37:32] right we all do praise God like I guess
[37:35] I on my podcast somebody said they
[37:37] really liked our podcast brother amen
[37:38] yesterday and they said I cited acts 17
[37:41] 11 rather than Matthew 17 11. so I said
[37:44] well brother man did all the time I do
[37:45] it all the time too I I'm just citing
[37:47] the wrong verse
[37:49] but see God many times will allow us to
[37:53] go through trials and I love how God at
[37:54] the last moment he comes he said I got
[37:56] one more measure left and that's when
[37:57] Elijah came and said give that to me
[37:59] first put God first and everything else
[38:01] will be added unto you Hallelujah and
[38:04] the other example the other example
[38:06] Brother Bear gave was that three Hebrew
[38:07] children
[38:08] during that whole time from the time
[38:09] they didn't bow to the image up until
[38:11] the very moment they stepped in the fire
[38:13] they didn't hear from God
[38:16] but let me say like this they had heard
[38:17] from God before because they'd heard
[38:19] from God and they have a they had a
[38:21] revelation I Will Not Bow the knee to a
[38:23] false idol praise God Amen
[38:27] so see even though they never even in
[38:28] the trial we'd say the trial leading up
[38:30] to the the execution or the martyrdom
[38:32] they never heard a specific voice from
[38:35] God but they'd heard enough before that
[38:37] amen they'd heard through the word or
[38:39] they heard God speak to they and God was
[38:41] testing them are you going to stand with
[38:43] what you've already heard praise God
[38:45] and so so it is with our trials God
[38:47] wants us to stand in the word that we've
[38:49] already heard praise God and just like
[38:51] David you know with the lion and the
[38:53] bear godlin says when our next Goliath
[38:55] comes God wants us to live off the
[38:57] testimony of the past if God was God in
[38:58] the past he's God of the president
[39:00] Hallelujah
[39:01] amen
[39:03] praise God and I just told amen you know
[39:04] think about 430 Years Egypt I'm sorry
[39:07] Israel is in Egypt as slaves which we're
[39:09] going to get to
[39:11] and eat that that was ten Generations
[39:13] almost 11 Generations because the
[39:15] generation is 40 years
[39:17] okay think what if you were in the first
[39:19] generation God we prayed for 40 years
[39:21] bring us out of slavery and God didn't
[39:22] answer
[39:24] what if you're in the second generation
[39:25] oh God my my parents were in slavery for
[39:28] 40 years God bring us out bring us out
[39:30] and God let it go on third fourth
[39:32] generation fifth generation six seven
[39:34] eight nine ten eleven all these
[39:37] Generations
[39:39] and each one had to trust in God and
[39:42] many of them were faithful because it
[39:43] eventually produced a jock a bed amen
[39:46] which produced a Moses hallelujah praise
[39:48] God
[39:49] in other words church we just got to be
[39:51] faithful to what God has revealed to us
[39:53] God will give us Supernatural
[39:55] experiences but it's all in God's time
[39:57] and season but we what we should know
[39:59] enough that angels are in this room
[40:01] right now praise God Amen because he
[40:03] said the angel Lord and camps around
[40:05] those that fear God hallelujah
[40:08] Hallelujah so God expects us in our in
[40:11] our trials God expects us to live off
[40:14] the Revelation he's already revealed to
[40:16] us and not forget it and to trust him
[40:18] and keep all that we know keep all the
[40:21] Commandments that we know be a faithful
[40:22] witness it's a test it's a trial but you
[40:25] will pass the test the trial will end
[40:27] this too shall pass and there'll be a
[40:29] season of rest and victory praise God
[40:32] Hallelujah
[40:34] I just thought I'd start with that
[40:36] introduction there
[40:39] now here's the quote brother Brown talks
[40:41] about this so brother and I talked about
[40:42] if there was slavery in the South this
[40:44] is in 1963
[40:47] he said uh if those people were slaves I
[40:52] take my church and go south to help them
[40:55] people out of slavery I sure would
[40:56] because man makes slaves not God
[41:00] and that quote has always stuck with me
[41:02] in relation to this subject
[41:04] uh we're all of One blood we all come
[41:06] from One Tree and that was from Adam God
[41:09] by one blood has made all nations and
[41:11] whether we our colors are brown or black
[41:13] or yellow red whatever it might be We're
[41:15] All Creatures the almighty see and there
[41:17] shouldn't be any differences in US
[41:18] praise God
[41:19] Hallelujah
[41:21] so the question was you know Austin and
[41:23] I were talking about that this summer
[41:24] does God permit and allow slavery
[41:29] uh well I guess I could re-reword this a
[41:32] little bit um
[41:34] God doesn't ordain slavery but God does
[41:36] permit it and allow it right because he
[41:38] allows sin he allows people to make bad
[41:40] decisions he allows people to make good
[41:42] decisions as well
[41:44] um
[41:45] so yeah let me just let me just change
[41:47] that real quick here
[41:51] so I'll say yes he permits it here
[41:56] um
[41:57] but
[42:01] yeah let's just go with that here by
[42:03] God's grace sorry I'm kind of
[42:07] updating it on the Fly here
[42:10] so yes he permitted it because he
[42:12] permitted slavery you know Israel to be
[42:14] slaves in Egypt now he allowed though
[42:17] two different forms of servant systems
[42:19] in Israel once they got into the
[42:21] Promised Land
[42:23] uh the first one was totally different
[42:25] from the second one the first one was
[42:27] purchase Heathen servants
[42:30] so any Heathen that was not an Israelite
[42:33] they could purchase and that person was
[42:35] theirs forever
[42:38] okay and that and so that individual had
[42:41] different rights than a Jewish person
[42:45] who is of their own tribe and of their
[42:47] own Kindred right another own blood well
[42:50] I'm sorry one blood but of their own uh
[42:52] family
[42:54] now the one that that we read in Exodus
[42:56] 21 the other system was a voluntary
[43:01] so it wasn't forced right there was no
[43:03] forced servitude with the with the
[43:06] Jewish people
[43:07] the Heathen servants were that was that
[43:09] that was forced uh because they they
[43:12] allowed it that was the that was part of
[43:15] the the world system at that time
[43:18] um but the Jewish system was voluntary
[43:20] it was based on a contract and they got
[43:22] paid
[43:24] okay so that's the one that most of us
[43:26] uh should be familiar with there as far
[43:28] as the scriptures in the Bible
[43:31] so the example is Genesis 29 now I'm not
[43:34] going to spend much time on this but
[43:35] Church remember Jacob is running for his
[43:37] life
[43:38] he's running for his life you know he
[43:40] thinks Esau is going to kill him and no
[43:42] doubt he would because he said he was
[43:43] going to do it
[43:45] he goes he leaves and he doesn't even
[43:47] know where he's going of course God knew
[43:49] where he's going Hallelujah God knows
[43:50] where all of us are going amen
[43:52] and remember he has that experience with
[43:54] God he makes a pillow of us out of a
[43:57] stone
[43:57] praise God
[43:59] and then he sleeps that night he sees
[44:00] the vision of the uh of Jacob's Ladder
[44:03] you know Angels ascending and descending
[44:06] praise God
[44:07] and he says this is none other than the
[44:09] house of the Lord praise God and then he
[44:11] anoints the stone the stone with oil
[44:13] praise God well really he's traveling
[44:15] and and you know on this journey he
[44:17] knows God's going to be with him and he
[44:19] said Lord whatever you give me I'll
[44:20] surely give you a tenth of all that you
[44:22] give me praise God if you'll be my God
[44:24] hallelujah and if you'll give me what I
[44:26] need one of the food and everything I'll
[44:27] surely give a tenth of it praise God
[44:29] so then we know the story he goes and he
[44:31] meets Laban
[44:33] and then notice he had nothing so when
[44:36] he got there
[44:37] all he could do was let me at your mercy
[44:40] Laban
[44:41] so that means Laban is going to give him
[44:43] clothes for seven years
[44:45] food
[44:46] everything else that he needs a shelter
[44:50] that's a pretty big that's a pretty big
[44:51] contract well you're gonna you're from
[44:53] you're going to provide all my shampoo
[44:55] all my toothbrush and all my toothpaste
[44:57] and you're gonna provide all my new
[44:59] clothes and yes I'll provide all that
[45:01] but you got to serve me for seven years
[45:05] so she had nothing
[45:07] and so this is uh this is the the system
[45:09] that God had built in there
[45:12] and I like it too you know once he gets
[45:13] there now everything that God gave Jacob
[45:15] he made sure he paid tithes and
[45:16] offerings on it as well amen hallelujah
[45:19] tithes and offerings and I wonder who
[45:21] his priest was I'm not sure who his
[45:22] priest was at that time
[45:24] Hallelujah but maybe they would just
[45:26] sacrifice to God maybe he would just
[45:27] sacrifice the tenth of God I'm not sure
[45:30] so he worked seven years for Rachel and
[45:32] of course and then he gets Leah well
[45:35] then well that's the custom of the land
[45:37] apparently and then so he has to work
[45:39] seven more uh to get Rachel
[45:42] he was under a contract right and he
[45:44] even got mistreated and it's a good
[45:46] lesson even if you get mistreated and
[45:48] you're serving God and you're doing
[45:49] what's right God will vindicate you in
[45:51] time
[45:52] because God Vindicated In Time by giving
[45:54] him more animals and he became more Rich
[45:56] than Laban and even when he left laban's
[45:59] like you sure we don't want you to go
[46:00] and Layman made sure don't marry any
[46:02] more women right because he had two
[46:03] daughters and two concubines and he
[46:05] promised he promised Laban I won't marry
[46:07] any other I'll just have your daughters
[46:09] and the two concubines
[46:11] but he leaves so much richer because he
[46:13] was a tie payer amen hallelujah he
[46:16] believed in the power of God hallelujah
[46:17] he was a real believer praise God
[46:20] and he kept his contract look he didn't
[46:22] break his contract he kept his contract
[46:24] praise God
[46:25] that's our Christians should be we
[46:27] should keep our contracts amen
[46:29] we should be men and women of our word
[46:32] hallelujah
[46:33] now what do you think do you think Jacob
[46:35] was grateful for these contracts or
[46:36] think he was uh upset about him
[46:39] I'd say he's grateful don't you
[46:42] if you had somebody that was if you were
[46:44] destitute had nothing you were a
[46:45] Wanderer and somebody took you in and
[46:47] fed you and clothed you for seven years
[46:49] that person would be very dear to you I
[46:51] think
[46:52] don't you think Church
[46:54] so we start seeing in the Bible we start
[46:56] seeing this this contractual system
[46:59] uh these the servant system uh right
[47:02] away now of course Jacob was before
[47:03] Moses but we see this system is already
[47:05] built in seven years was like a good uh
[47:08] contractual contractual length of course
[47:11] they knew the seven days of creation
[47:12] seven days in a week they would have
[47:14] known that
[47:15] and so this was kind of already built
[47:17] into the system
[47:18] okay
[47:20] and so there was a just so you know
[47:21] there's a couple good YouTube videos I
[47:22] watched that had some good uh teachings
[47:25] on this so that's kind of where I got
[47:26] the format of this and a couple online
[47:28] uh documents I read because it was a
[47:30] really good uh really good question
[47:31] there from Brother Austin here
[47:34] now I want to go over this to get your
[47:35] Bible handy let's go over I've always
[47:37] wondered about this there was two types
[47:39] of uh two types of jubilees
[47:43] okay there was a seven year seven year
[47:45] period and you could go out free
[47:48] uh but then there was a 50-year jubilee
[47:51] so I want to read over these we'll spend
[47:53] a little time on these we might as well
[47:54] you know uh this is a good question and
[47:55] it's good good Bible context here
[47:58] and you're remember all scripture is
[48:00] profitable for Doctrine for teaching
[48:02] instruction and training in
[48:03] righteousness that the man or woman of
[48:05] God may be thorough and ready unto all
[48:08] good works praise God this is going to
[48:10] help you somehow this is going to help
[48:11] us some way praise God
[48:13] okay so let's go to Exodus 21 or 1 to
[48:16] 11. now we already read verses one to
[48:18] three
[48:20] if a man comes in and he says like like
[48:22] Jacob or if he needs if he needs food
[48:24] shelter clothing I'll serve you for
[48:26] seven years if he comes in he goes out
[48:29] by himself and in this at the end of the
[48:30] seven years
[48:32] if he comes in married his wife goes out
[48:34] with him but verse 4 if his master have
[48:37] given him a wife and she have borne him
[48:39] Sons or daughters the wife and her
[48:40] children shall be her Masters and he
[48:42] shall go out by himself now do you think
[48:44] a real husband would like that no so
[48:46] he'd have to stay and work for them
[48:49] okay
[48:50] his master gave him a wife now verse
[48:53] five and if the servant shall plainly
[48:54] say I love my master my wife and my
[48:56] children I will not go out free then his
[48:58] master shall bring him unto the judges
[49:01] he shall also bring him to the door or
[49:04] unto the doorpost and his master shall
[49:05] bore his ear through with an awe and he
[49:08] shall serve him forever so there's the
[49:10] first earring in the Bible
[49:12] I'm sorry not the first but that's one
[49:13] that that's a sign of an earring because
[49:15] there are earrings that date in
[49:16] Rebecca's days they're probably clip-ons
[49:19] right because we never see God wanting
[49:21] his children to uh purposely scar their
[49:24] bodies
[49:25] right or cut their bodies or scrape
[49:27] their bodies or anything like that
[49:29] but here we see the first like modern
[49:31] day earring where an ear is actually
[49:34] punctured through and and given a
[49:36] jewelry of that type of Mark
[49:40] okay so this is for the man who says I
[49:42] don't want to go free I Don't Want to Be
[49:43] Free
[49:44] now look at that God has a distinct Mark
[49:46] God has a public uh undistinguishable
[49:50] undeniable mark this person doesn't want
[49:52] to be free they want to be a slave the
[49:54] rest of their life
[49:55] they want to they want to be a servant
[49:57] the rest of their life and brother Adam
[49:59] uses this uh to do a type of the New
[50:02] Testament praise God when a person
[50:04] doesn't want to be free in Christ but
[50:06] the man said they're marked in the ear
[50:08] by Satan in other words they won't hear
[50:10] what the spirit is saying praise God
[50:12] that's like crossing the line between
[50:13] mercy and judgment right they don't want
[50:15] to be free they don't want to be God's
[50:17] free man they want to be a servant to
[50:19] sin they want to be a servant to uh to
[50:21] slavery they don't want to be free but
[50:23] Jesus today is offering us freedom
[50:25] praise God Amen just like this man he
[50:28] can be free it was his choice but
[50:30] whatever you choose you got to live with
[50:32] your choice amen
[50:33] but God is gracious to give us a choice
[50:35] how many could say Amen to that
[50:38] see forever and I said brother man uses
[50:40] it as a type of the mark of the beast as
[50:42] well I think it's in the 1953 sermon the
[50:44] mark of the beast of 1954 if I'm not
[50:46] mistaken
[50:48] he uses this God God gives him a chance
[50:50] you can be free you can be free or you
[50:53] cannot be it's your choice but if you
[50:56] don't then your ear is going to be
[50:57] marked where you will not be able to
[50:59] hear the sound for Freedom anymore
[51:05] verse 7 if a man sell his daughter to be
[51:08] a maidservant
[51:10] she shall not go out as men's servants
[51:13] do now we're going to get to this later
[51:14] some people say like I think Austin was
[51:16] told this some people say well the Bible
[51:18] says a man could sell his daughter as a
[51:21] sex slave that's an absolute lie
[51:23] that's so wicked that somebody would
[51:25] think that but that's what you get when
[51:26] you're a carnal mind and you read the
[51:28] Bible
[51:29] because we'll get to some other ones
[51:30] this so this is a big question uh people
[51:32] have but we'll get to a little later
[51:34] okay so if he sells his daughter
[51:37] he should not go out as men's servants
[51:39] do if she pleases not her master who
[51:41] hath betrothed her to himself then she
[51:43] then shout he let her be redeemed
[51:47] so if she doesn't please her she could
[51:49] be redeemed she could be bought back
[51:51] okay
[51:53] to sell her unto a strange Nation he
[51:55] shall have no power so we're not to sell
[51:58] them to other strange Nations keep them
[52:00] in the Jewish community
[52:02] see seeing yet dealt deceitfully with
[52:04] her see that would be a bad thing to do
[52:06] to want to sell her off to some strange
[52:07] lands
[52:08] in other words take care of your family
[52:10] members
[52:11] right take care of your people
[52:13] you're God's people you're not to treat
[52:15] each other wrong treat each other with
[52:16] dignity treat each other with respect
[52:18] praise God your chosen people you're a
[52:21] covenant people praise God
[52:24] verse 9.
[52:26] and if he hath betrothed her unto his
[52:28] son he shall deal with her after the
[52:30] manner of daughter so look now you're
[52:32] she's a part of your family basically
[52:36] right in verse 10. and if he take him
[52:38] another wife
[52:40] her food her aiment and her duty of
[52:42] marriage he shall not diminish so he
[52:45] already betrothed her unto himself and
[52:47] if she doesn't please him he cannot
[52:49] treat her any less he still got it
[52:51] because he gave that vow he gave that
[52:53] betrayal and God makes us keep our vows
[52:57] so you could say well she doesn't please
[52:58] me but I've still got to give her the
[53:00] food everything that I promised her I
[53:02] still got to give her that equal rights
[53:04] as a wife
[53:06] see that
[53:08] see so people will read verse seven
[53:10] they'll read verse seven and think oh
[53:11] God allowed men to sell their daughters
[53:13] as sex slaves that's a bunch of they
[53:15] just look there's they just got to read
[53:16] three more verses down
[53:18] and they're so lazy they won't even do
[53:20] that they'll just take what somebody
[53:21] says
[53:22] that's called slandering the name of the
[53:25] Lord that's close to blasphemy
[53:27] slander In The Name Of The Lord
[53:29] see Satan's trying to slant he doesn't
[53:31] see that's his job Satan's job is to
[53:33] slander the Lord
[53:35] right to make him look bad but if you
[53:37] keep reading that's why the Bible says
[53:38] search the scriptures for in them you
[53:40] think you have eternal life and there
[53:41] they which testify of Christ Hallelujah
[53:43] search them day and night praise God
[53:45] search them every day and you'll find
[53:47] truth hallelujah
[53:49] my word is a lamp unto your feet and a
[53:52] light into your path
[53:56] verse 11 and if he do not these three
[53:59] unto her then she shall go out free
[54:02] without money
[54:05] okay so she goes out free
[54:09] now of course the church and just so you
[54:10] know just a broad generalization
[54:13] many Jews still did Even though God had
[54:15] these laws of Moses many Jews still did
[54:17] wrong things that's why I had they had
[54:18] to set up judges
[54:20] somebody had it just like today we're
[54:22] supposed to file the law but if not
[54:23] there's got to be some judge who
[54:25] actually makes some enforcer like a
[54:28] police department right they have to
[54:29] enforce these laws and make sure they're
[54:31] enforced
[54:33] but if it's not done she goes out
[54:36] as the Bible says just like that
[54:40] she goes out free so she gets her
[54:41] Freedom back now she was sold into this
[54:43] service right but then she gets her
[54:46] Freedom back if the if the if uh all the
[54:49] requirements are not met so see look God
[54:51] allows your freedom back
[54:53] see not forever allows the freedom back
[54:57] okay so there's so there's this in
[55:00] chapter 21 you get this this term that
[55:03] these servant contracts were generally
[55:05] seven years
[55:06] generally seven year long service
[55:08] contracts
[55:10] all right now let's go a little
[55:11] Leviticus 25 now this is a big long
[55:12] chapter
[55:13] I may do some speed reading in here so
[55:15] it may sound like I'm reading that twice
[55:17] speed here
[55:19] because this is a lot of reading but
[55:20] it's going to be good for us to cover
[55:21] this topic that's what I love about
[55:23] being a pastor I can cover all the
[55:24] topics I want to cover praise God next
[55:26] week in Albion I can't cover all the
[55:28] topics so I got to choose the one topics
[55:29] I feel better than the Lord of course I
[55:31] feel that Lord this morning but I just
[55:33] love the fact I have all this time I can
[55:35] teach you the whole counsel of God by
[55:36] God's grace because God is teaching me
[55:38] that Council
[55:39] I'm learning and God is helping us all
[55:41] learn together praise God
[55:43] Leviticus 25
[55:45] verses one to seven Schofield calls the
[55:48] law of the land the sabbatic year
[55:50] and the Lord spoke unto Moses and Mount
[55:52] Sinai saying Speak unto the children of
[55:53] Israel and saying them when ye come into
[55:55] the land which I give you then shall the
[55:57] land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six
[55:59] years Thou shalt sow thy field and six
[56:02] years Thou shalt prune thy Vineyard and
[56:04] gather in the fruit thereof but in the
[56:05] seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest
[56:07] unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord
[56:09] Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor
[56:12] prune thy Vineyard that which groweth of
[56:14] its own accord of the Harvest Thou shalt
[56:16] not reap
[56:18] neither gather The Grapes of thine thine
[56:20] undress for it is a year of rest unto
[56:23] the land and the Sabbath of the land
[56:25] shall be meat for you for thee and for
[56:27] thy servant and for thy maid and for thy
[56:29] hired servant so here see there's some
[56:31] servants there's some Maids they can
[56:33] have these seven year contracts right
[56:34] and for thy stranger that Sojourner is
[56:36] with thee okay so there's even laws here
[56:39] in the Bible where if a stranger just
[56:41] wandered in maybe it's like uh what do
[56:44] they call the people that come when
[56:45] there's uh well like immigrants but
[56:48] because of War they're allowed into the
[56:50] land what do they call those refugees
[56:52] that's the word there I don't know why I
[56:53] can't remember some of these words so
[56:55] even refugees if there was other
[56:56] problems in other nations they had
[56:59] Hebrews were required to help them out
[57:03] and God tells us why because you were a
[57:05] refugee in Egypt
[57:08] you just couldn't say no you're not I
[57:09] mean they could say that but then God
[57:10] would judge them for that they would
[57:12] they would suffer for that they were
[57:13] supposed to open their home and say come
[57:15] on in because we were servants one time
[57:17] in Egypt but God delivered us but so
[57:20] we're going to show the same Grace God
[57:21] showed to us we're going to show it to
[57:23] everybody else
[57:26] verse 7 and for thy cattle and for the
[57:28] beasts that are in thy land shall all
[57:30] the increase thereof be meat now some of
[57:32] you know this
[57:34] but Israel was given this and they as a
[57:36] nation they never fully followed this
[57:39] in other words they didn't take the
[57:40] seventh year off
[57:42] so who knows what happened remember the
[57:43] days of Daniel 70 years they had to be
[57:45] kicked out because those were the 70
[57:47] jubilees that they didn't follow
[57:51] that's why it was 70. why were we get
[57:52] that 70. it was 70 Jubilee so 70 times
[57:55] 50. all those years they were there and
[57:58] they didn't honor God's word so God said
[58:00] because you haven't honored you haven't
[58:01] given the land rest I'm kicking you out
[58:03] to give the land rest but God was
[58:05] faithful and he brought them back amen
[58:06] talk about Second Chances amen
[58:08] hallelujah
[58:10] you haven't kept my word for for 70 70
[58:13] jubilees you've rejected it but I'm
[58:15] gonna bring you back praise God and I'll
[58:17] give you a chance to to keep the word of
[58:19] God again he said a suckling a mother
[58:21] may forget her suckling child but I
[58:23] cannot forgive Israel praise God because
[58:25] he's graving in the palm of my hands
[58:27] Hallelujah in other words I'm gonna have
[58:29] a messiah I'm going to send a Jewish
[58:30] Messiah for my people and his name is
[58:32] going to be Jesus Hallelujah and he
[58:34] shall save the people from their sins
[58:36] amen thank God we're safe from our sins
[58:38] Hallelujah
[58:41] Hallelujah verse now verses 8
[58:44] through 24 Scofield caused the law of
[58:47] the land the Year of Jubilee
[58:49] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[58:51] years unto thee seven times seven years
[58:53] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[58:55] years shall be Unity 40 and nine years
[58:57] then Thou shalt
[59:00] I'm sorry then shout thou cause the
[59:02] trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the
[59:04] tenth day of the seventh month in the
[59:06] land of the of atonement shall you make
[59:08] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[59:10] land and ye shall Hollow the 50th year
[59:12] and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[59:14] land unto all the inhabitants thereof
[59:17] it shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[59:19] shall return listen every man unto his
[59:21] possession
[59:22] and he shall return every man unto his
[59:25] family
[59:26] so every 50 years if if any family
[59:29] member wasn't with their immediate
[59:31] family they got to go back
[59:34] if anybody lost their land think about
[59:36] that you had to go you went bankruptcy
[59:38] and you lost all your land every 50
[59:40] years you got that land back
[59:43] see God was not trying to let it become
[59:44] a monopoly where the one Jewish family
[59:46] owns everything and everybody's a slave
[59:48] to him or their family God would allow
[59:51] you whatever was yours at the beginning
[59:52] your families God's allowing you to get
[59:55] it back praise God hallelujah what a God
[59:57] of redemption praise God
[1:00:02] verse 11 a jubilee shot that 50th year
[1:00:07] be unto you you shall not sow neither
[1:00:09] reap
[1:00:09] that which growth of itself in it nor
[1:00:12] gather the grapes in it of thy Vine
[1:00:14] undress for it is the Jubilee it shall
[1:00:16] be holy unto you you shall eat the
[1:00:18] increase thereof out of the field in the
[1:00:20] Year of Jubilee ye
[1:00:21] shall return every man unto his
[1:00:23] possession
[1:00:25] and if thou
[1:00:26] sell ought unto Thy Neighbor or by us
[1:00:30] ought of thy neighbor's hand ye shall
[1:00:32] not oppress one another so see even in
[1:00:34] these servant relationships there was no
[1:00:37] oppression later we're going to see the
[1:00:39] word rigor there was no severity or
[1:00:42] cruelness
[1:00:44] now was there some corporal punishment
[1:00:46] yes we'll get to that
[1:00:47] right even in America there was corporal
[1:00:49] punishment until up about what the 1940s
[1:00:52] or 50s or 60s
[1:00:54] uh they they finally they started taking
[1:00:56] you know rods out of the schools they
[1:00:57] used to be able to spank kids yeah maybe
[1:00:59] in the 60s or 70s
[1:01:02] I don't know I don't remember the exact
[1:01:03] I had a history I had a I had a class at
[1:01:06] the University of Akron College school
[1:01:07] law one year and I used to know back
[1:01:09] then but I don't know anymore okay
[1:01:11] because I can't remember all the details
[1:01:13] of that but it was a good class school
[1:01:14] law was a really good class I learned I
[1:01:16] learned a lot about the law but I forgot
[1:01:18] it all
[1:01:19] um
[1:01:20] so God did not allow oppression
[1:01:23] so in these servant relationships you
[1:01:25] had to treat them with a lot of respect
[1:01:28] you had to provide everything for them
[1:01:30] verse 15. according to the number of
[1:01:32] years after the Jubilee Thou shalt die
[1:01:34] of thy neighbor and according unto the
[1:01:36] number of years of the fruits he shall
[1:01:39] sell unto thee according to the
[1:01:41] multitude of years Thou shalt increase
[1:01:43] the price thereof and according to the
[1:01:45] fewness of years Thou shalt diminish the
[1:01:48] price of it for according to the number
[1:01:49] of the years of the fruits death he
[1:01:51] sounded now this is a bit confusing to
[1:01:52] me but in other words
[1:01:55] um
[1:01:56] you know there was if there was a lot of
[1:01:58] years to the Jubilee there'd be a
[1:02:00] certain cost like you might buy land
[1:02:02] like if there was 48 years left to the
[1:02:04] next Jubilee that price might there be a
[1:02:06] certain price of that but if there's
[1:02:08] less the price might be higher because
[1:02:10] you only get that land for a few a few
[1:02:12] years
[1:02:13] so the longer it was to the Jubilee the
[1:02:15] less it costs the closer you got the
[1:02:19] more it costs
[1:02:21] right because you don't get that land
[1:02:22] for as long as you as you could have
[1:02:25] because there's so it's kind of like
[1:02:27] prorated there's a pro rated cost for
[1:02:30] things right
[1:02:33] all right
[1:02:35] so hopefully we can see that by God's
[1:02:36] grace
[1:02:38] verse 17 you shall not therefore oppress
[1:02:40] one another but Thou shalt fear thy God
[1:02:42] for on the Lord your God
[1:02:45] see there's no oppression
[1:02:46] it's fairness you work with fairness if
[1:02:49] someone's in a hard time and they need
[1:02:50] you to buy their land just get some
[1:02:52] money and you need to hire them to be a
[1:02:54] servant then do it you're going to help
[1:02:55] them out it's going to help you out too
[1:02:57] praise God but do not oppress one
[1:03:00] another verse 18. wherefore ye shall do
[1:03:02] my statutes and keep my judgments and do
[1:03:04] them and you shall dwell in the land
[1:03:05] safely and the land shall yield her
[1:03:07] fruit and ye shall eat your fill and
[1:03:10] dwell therein in safety
[1:03:13] so see they had to give the servants the
[1:03:14] same amount of food if you're full you
[1:03:17] got to give your servants a full amount
[1:03:19] of food
[1:03:20] there was no mistreatment like in in the
[1:03:22] South you know all these years ago in
[1:03:24] the 1800s there was that was a totally
[1:03:26] different system that wasn't a
[1:03:27] bible-based system
[1:03:29] that was a sinful Wicked system here in
[1:03:32] America but that was all over the world
[1:03:34] at that time
[1:03:35] thank God it's mostly and it was
[1:03:37] Christians that got rid of that system
[1:03:38] praise God
[1:03:39] Hallelujah
[1:03:41] verse 20. and if ye shall say what shall
[1:03:43] we eat the seventh year behold We Shall
[1:03:45] Not So neither gather an increase that I
[1:03:47] will command my blessing upon you in the
[1:03:50] sixth year and it shall bring forth
[1:03:51] fruit for three years look at that my
[1:03:55] how many believe God is a god of
[1:03:56] increase amen
[1:03:58] how many know that in one apple seed all
[1:04:01] the apples
[1:04:03] that are going to be in that seat are
[1:04:05] from that tree are already in that seed
[1:04:08] so God would Supernatural in that in
[1:04:10] that sixth year if if they in that
[1:04:12] seventh year if if they were decided I'm
[1:04:14] we're going to live by faith we're going
[1:04:15] to give this year a rest now of course
[1:04:17] they never did it all right but if if
[1:04:19] they had believed by faith God would
[1:04:21] supernaturally allow that that seed all
[1:04:24] the DNA and the chromosomes in that
[1:04:25] apple seed God would allow all the all
[1:04:28] the DNA to work out there so the fruit
[1:04:30] would produce three times the amount of
[1:04:32] fruit right because God is the author of
[1:04:35] life amen that's God's Book of Life
[1:04:37] that's God's instruction book amen man
[1:04:39] tries to break in there and yeah he can
[1:04:41] break in there and he can genetically
[1:04:43] modify it but there's nobody that can
[1:04:45] modify it like God can modify it amen
[1:04:47] Hallelujah imagine a apple tree apple
[1:04:51] tree seed that would produce three times
[1:04:53] the number of apples you've seen it
[1:04:55] right Malachi I've seen him out there on
[1:04:56] the orchard right imagine three times of
[1:04:59] what they actually produced in one year
[1:05:01] because God was going to bless them for
[1:05:03] trusting his word amen look at that
[1:05:05] church God was going to bless them for
[1:05:07] taking a year-long vacation now how many
[1:05:09] of you would like a year on long
[1:05:10] vacation I could say Amen to that I wish
[1:05:13] every seven years I got a year off you
[1:05:14] know wouldn't that be awesome I have to
[1:05:16] go to work for a whole year
[1:05:17] I'm thankful for the two and a half
[1:05:19] years or two and a half months I get off
[1:05:20] every year I'm thankful for that but
[1:05:22] God's system was I'm going to give you a
[1:05:23] vacation every seventh year
[1:05:26] and you don't got to work you just got
[1:05:27] to trust me in that sixth year don't be
[1:05:28] tempted just trust me
[1:05:31] and my spiritual law will go to work and
[1:05:33] I'll make those seeds produced three
[1:05:35] times as much it's biblical remember
[1:05:37] Isaac trusted God and the Bible said
[1:05:39] Isaac's uh plants produce a hundred fold
[1:05:44] way above their normal production
[1:05:46] because Isaac trusted the Lord he
[1:05:49] planted in faith Hallelujah and he
[1:05:50] reaped in righteousness amen
[1:05:53] Hallelujah
[1:05:56] God's asking them to trust me and I will
[1:05:59] put a blessing on you if you'll just
[1:06:01] trust me
[1:06:03] Hallelujah just like we know what ties
[1:06:04] and offerings for the New Testament
[1:06:07] verse 22 and ye shall sow the eighth
[1:06:09] year and eat yet of old fruit until the
[1:06:12] ninth year until our fruits come and ye
[1:06:14] shall eat of the old store the land
[1:06:16] shall not be sold forever the land look
[1:06:18] at this for the land is mine now that's
[1:06:20] the attitude we need everything I got is
[1:06:22] actually God's
[1:06:24] my car my home by my cars rather my home
[1:06:27] my job my clothes my children everything
[1:06:31] I got is already God's and I understand
[1:06:33] that so I Fear God and I keep his
[1:06:36] commands Hallelujah but I know when I do
[1:06:38] that then he'll bless me praise God
[1:06:41] for your strangers and sojourners with
[1:06:43] me so look God even tells Israel really
[1:06:45] you're strangers of this world you're
[1:06:47] sojourners really you're on a journey
[1:06:49] with me amen Peter says we're pilgrims
[1:06:51] and strangers Church hallelujah thank
[1:06:53] God now this is our home eventually but
[1:06:55] here we're pilgrims and strangers until
[1:06:57] we pass away or get raptured then we go
[1:06:59] up to the marriage suffer the lamb
[1:07:00] that's really our real home is with God
[1:07:02] because that's where we started amen we
[1:07:05] start in the mind of Christ that's our
[1:07:06] reason whoever Jesus is that's where we
[1:07:08] are amen that's that's our real home
[1:07:10] praise God
[1:07:11] we're really pilgrims and sojourners
[1:07:13] here on this Earth praise God we're not
[1:07:15] supposed to get used to this life on
[1:07:17] Earth although we want God's blessing
[1:07:18] because our real home is wherever Jesus
[1:07:21] is amen that's our real home
[1:07:23] because we were chosen in his mind
[1:07:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:27] I told that to the middle schools this
[1:07:29] week so I was preaching them on Tuesday
[1:07:30] morning at 7 7 30 a.m I was preaching
[1:07:32] them I said you know where you started
[1:07:34] middle schoolers uh I said you think you
[1:07:37] started in Copley they're like yeah I
[1:07:38] said no it's actually the mind of Christ
[1:07:41] if you're a Christian you are in the
[1:07:43] mind of Christ before the foundation of
[1:07:44] the world
[1:07:46] Hallelujah I said now he said you know
[1:07:48] where you come from now you ought to now
[1:07:50] he gave you a Bible that has his mind
[1:07:51] you came out of his mind now I gave you
[1:07:54] a Bible that teaches you his mind now
[1:07:55] now you need to invest in that Bible so
[1:07:58] you know his mind so you can go back to
[1:07:59] him praise God
[1:08:01] hallelujah he sent you here you get to
[1:08:04] know him here then you go back to him
[1:08:05] Hallelujah
[1:08:06] and then you're forever with him
[1:08:08] eternally praise God oh it's a beautiful
[1:08:10] plan amen it's a beautiful
[1:08:12] it's a beautiful teaching there see
[1:08:14] where pilgrims and sojourners here we're
[1:08:16] going back to where we came from praise
[1:08:18] God wherever Jesus is that's my hometown
[1:08:21] Hallelujah a Bible calls it motherland
[1:08:23] that's your motherland
[1:08:25] verse 24 and in all the land of your
[1:08:27] possession you shall Grant a Redemption
[1:08:29] for the land see everything that was
[1:08:31] yours you are going to get it back
[1:08:33] no matter how hard your life gets no
[1:08:35] matter how difficult things were in the
[1:08:37] Jewish time if it was given to your
[1:08:39] family by by redemption or by by
[1:08:41] inheritance you will get it back
[1:08:44] whether through hard work and working
[1:08:46] through contracts then you can so you
[1:08:48] work for seven years save up your money
[1:08:50] and then try to go buy your land back
[1:08:52] right if not you got to keep working
[1:08:55] so you can go get that land back but
[1:08:56] either way by the time that 50 year
[1:08:58] comes that you believe you're getting
[1:09:00] your land back praise God
[1:09:03] that predestinated that ordained land
[1:09:06] that God had given for you praise God
[1:09:09] Hallelujah little did I know growing up
[1:09:11] in Liberty Center Ohio three hours away
[1:09:13] little did I know God had a little
[1:09:14] inheritance out for me
[1:09:16] on uh 94 Route 94 in Doylestown Ohio I
[1:09:19] never knew that that was my little piece
[1:09:21] of predestinated land there everybody
[1:09:22] God's grace that's my little uh that's
[1:09:25] my little uh land of possession
[1:09:28] Hallelujah I just had to walk into that
[1:09:29] and church I'm glad I got a 30-year uh
[1:09:32] loan on that by God's grace I'm glad
[1:09:33] it's not seven years
[1:09:35] I couldn't pay that off in seven years
[1:09:36] right so I like how we have this 30-year
[1:09:40] loan instead of a seven year loan
[1:09:41] of course we have a massive inflation
[1:09:43] these days you know
[1:09:45] but God had a little predestinated
[1:09:47] physical plot of land for my family and
[1:09:49] I praise God I'm grateful for it amen
[1:09:53] but remember all the land is the Lord's
[1:09:56] anyway it's all God's we're just
[1:09:59] borrowing it for a little time in season
[1:10:00] praise God
[1:10:01] verse 25.
[1:10:04] If thy brother be waxed important here
[1:10:06] it is see here's why people would become
[1:10:07] servants voluntarily they'd be waxing
[1:10:10] poor
[1:10:11] and has sold away some of his possession
[1:10:13] and if any of his kin come to redeem it
[1:10:16] then shall he redeem that which his
[1:10:18] brother sold
[1:10:20] she could if your brother lost something
[1:10:22] you could buy it back for him
[1:10:24] and if the man have done none to redeem
[1:10:27] it and himself be able to redeem it then
[1:10:30] let him count the years of the sale
[1:10:31] thereof and restore the over plus unto
[1:10:34] the man to whom he sold it that he may
[1:10:36] return unto his possession so again you
[1:10:38] have to look at how many years has it
[1:10:39] been in uh under us and I'll pay
[1:10:41] whatever's left of that that price
[1:10:45] but if he not be able to restore it unto
[1:10:47] him then that which is sold shall remain
[1:10:49] in the hand of him that hath bought it
[1:10:51] until the Year of Jubilee and the
[1:10:53] Jubilee shall go out and he shall return
[1:10:55] unto his possession
[1:10:57] and if a man sell a dwelling house in a
[1:10:59] walled City now brother uses this as a
[1:11:00] type as well so let's let's look at this
[1:11:02] one
[1:11:03] if he sells a dwelling house in a walled
[1:11:07] City then he may redeem it within a
[1:11:09] whole year after it is sold within a
[1:11:12] full year may he redeem it so it's a
[1:11:13] walled City
[1:11:14] now notice the land is very limited in a
[1:11:17] walled City
[1:11:18] cities were much smaller of course than
[1:11:19] the broad or the broad lands he's got
[1:11:22] one year if he sells his possession in
[1:11:24] the city he's only got one year to buy
[1:11:26] it back
[1:11:27] okay verse 30. and if it be not redeemed
[1:11:30] within the space of a full year then the
[1:11:31] house that is in the walled City shall
[1:11:33] be established forever to him that
[1:11:35] bought it throughout his Generations it
[1:11:37] shall not go out into the Jubilee now
[1:11:40] program uses that somehow as a type of
[1:11:42] denominationalism because it's walled in
[1:11:45] like a denomination walls you in praise
[1:11:48] God so that's that's how brother random
[1:11:50] uses that I don't quite understand it
[1:11:51] all the way but I'm sure God will reveal
[1:11:53] that to me if I need it verse 31 but the
[1:11:56] houses of the villagers which have no
[1:11:58] wall around about them shall be counted
[1:12:00] as the fields of the country they may be
[1:12:02] redeemed and they shall go out in the
[1:12:04] Jubilee so I guess you can't redeem a
[1:12:06] denomination but you can redeem a free
[1:12:08] land praise God
[1:12:10] Hallelujah that's that I can see that
[1:12:13] type verse 32 notwithstanding the cities
[1:12:15] of the Levites in the house of the
[1:12:16] cities of their possession May the Lee
[1:12:18] rights redeem at any time so Levites
[1:12:21] could redeem anything because they had a
[1:12:22] smaller portion right
[1:12:24] they were not given great amounts of
[1:12:26] land like all the other uh 12 or 11
[1:12:29] tribes rather
[1:12:30] verse 33 and if a man purchased of the
[1:12:33] Levites then the house that was sold in
[1:12:35] the city of his possession shall go out
[1:12:36] in the year of his Jubilee for the house
[1:12:38] of the cities of the Levites are their
[1:12:40] possession among the children of Israel
[1:12:41] but the field of the suburbs of their
[1:12:43] cities may not be sold for it is their
[1:12:46] Perpetual possession
[1:12:48] all right now here's another poor
[1:12:51] brother verse 35. and If thy brother be
[1:12:53] waxing poor and fallen in Decay with
[1:12:55] thee then Thou shalt relieve him Thou
[1:12:57] shalt what
[1:12:58] mock him
[1:13:00] should we should we ever mock the poor
[1:13:02] no God says show them some relief
[1:13:05] because you don't know what's happened
[1:13:07] maybe it was their own mistake but do we
[1:13:08] want to show Mercy yes because what if
[1:13:10] we made a mistake do we want God to be
[1:13:11] merciful to us
[1:13:12] yes we want God to show Mercy relieve
[1:13:14] him yea though though he be a stranger
[1:13:16] or a Sojourner that he may live with
[1:13:19] thee so now even if it's your brother or
[1:13:21] an Egyptian
[1:13:23] or a moabite or someone who's not of the
[1:13:25] faith if they're waxing poor show Mercy
[1:13:28] on them
[1:13:30] take thou no usury or interest of them
[1:13:33] or increase but fear thy God that thy
[1:13:36] brother may live with thee
[1:13:39] all right so see we must show the love
[1:13:41] they must they had to show the love of
[1:13:42] God
[1:13:43] this person's in a difficult time show
[1:13:45] them God's love fear God
[1:13:48] be more be more cautious of how God is
[1:13:51] going to react to how you treat someone
[1:13:52] that's poor
[1:13:53] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
[1:13:56] usury nor lend him thy victuals for
[1:13:58] increase so if he's wax and poor don't
[1:13:59] charge him uh interest
[1:14:03] I am the Lord your God which brought you
[1:14:05] for see here's why because I brought you
[1:14:07] out of the land of Egypt to give you the
[1:14:08] land of Canaan and to be your God
[1:14:10] and If thy brother that dwelleth by thee
[1:14:12] be waxing poor and be sold unto thee
[1:14:14] Thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
[1:14:17] bond servant so see you don't treat him
[1:14:19] like one of those Heathen servants you
[1:14:21] treat him like a brother
[1:14:23] but as a hired servant and as a
[1:14:25] Sojourner he shall be with thee and
[1:14:27] Shall Serve thee unto the Year of
[1:14:29] Jubilee
[1:14:30] of course unto the next seven year
[1:14:33] period right whichever or whatever the
[1:14:35] contract was the contract may be to the
[1:14:37] next Jubilee the contract may be a seven
[1:14:38] year contract so it all depends Church
[1:14:40] what your contract is
[1:14:42] you could sign up well I'm going to
[1:14:44] serve you to the next Jubilee that may
[1:14:45] be 25 years maybe 35 years
[1:14:48] or you can do a seven year contract with
[1:14:51] a hired servant
[1:14:52] everybody can everybody say Amen
[1:14:54] it all depends on your contractual terms
[1:14:59] okay verse 41 we're getting there and
[1:15:02] then he shall depart from thee both he
[1:15:04] and his children with him and shall
[1:15:05] return on his own possession or a family
[1:15:06] member in the Year of Jubilee that's
[1:15:08] that's that's Jubilee
[1:15:10] and unto the possession of his father
[1:15:12] shall he return for they are my servants
[1:15:14] which I brought forth out of the land of
[1:15:16] Egypt they shall not be sold as Bond men
[1:15:18] so see Jews are treated different than
[1:15:19] anyone else
[1:15:21] Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor
[1:15:23] that's the word
[1:15:24] but shall fear thy God so no severity
[1:15:28] don't be severe now you could be a
[1:15:29] little more harsh with non-jews
[1:15:32] we'll show that later
[1:15:34] but with your own people do not be
[1:15:37] severe unto them be merciful unto them
[1:15:40] and that's what I was thinking about
[1:15:42] yesterday you know the Bible said do
[1:15:43] good unto all men especially those of
[1:15:45] the household of faith
[1:15:47] so we need to be good to everybody but
[1:15:49] be especially good to Christians
[1:15:52] that's why I went and visited Austin
[1:15:53] yesterday on his birthday I don't know
[1:15:54] if I shared that with you but we went
[1:15:56] surprised him we sang Happy birthday to
[1:15:57] him right in front of everybody well I
[1:15:59] really felt ashamed of my singing it
[1:16:00] wasn't very good but you know
[1:16:02] I was like well I love Austin I don't
[1:16:03] care what these people think praise God
[1:16:04] I was thinking of that we need to be
[1:16:06] especially good to those of the
[1:16:08] household of faith
[1:16:09] and I didn't plan that that was all led
[1:16:11] to the Lord that was when I woke up on
[1:16:13] Saturday I'm like oh I know what I'm
[1:16:14] gonna do today it just kind of worked
[1:16:15] out that way
[1:16:16] I'd like to come to all your jobs and
[1:16:18] sing to you in other words
[1:16:20] but I'm not sure if I can quite do that
[1:16:23] so he's lucky well I should say lucky
[1:16:25] but that was ordained to God then
[1:16:28] I'd like you to come to my school and
[1:16:30] sing to me too
[1:16:31] [Laughter]
[1:16:32] no we're all family praise God the idea
[1:16:34] is be especially good to Christians
[1:16:37] right especially to the household of
[1:16:39] faith be good to your brother and sister
[1:16:41] praise God
[1:16:44] I know that's what I've always tried to
[1:16:45] do be better to our church than I am
[1:16:47] just the people outside of our church
[1:16:49] always try to be very good to the people
[1:16:51] of God
[1:16:52] see don't don't have rigor don't be
[1:16:54] severe but rule them in the fear of God
[1:16:57] verse 44 both thy Bond men and thy Bond
[1:17:00] Maids which Thou shalt have shall be of
[1:17:02] the Heathen that around about you of
[1:17:04] them shall ye by Bond men and by made so
[1:17:06] see he then servants are treated way
[1:17:08] different than Jewish
[1:17:10] moreover of the children of the
[1:17:11] strangers that those that do sojourn
[1:17:13] among you of them that ye shall buy and
[1:17:16] of their families that are with you
[1:17:17] which they begat in your land and they
[1:17:19] shall be your possession he shall take
[1:17:21] them as an inheritance for your children
[1:17:23] after you to inherit them for a
[1:17:24] possession they shall be your bond men
[1:17:26] forever so see but over your brethren
[1:17:28] the children of Israel you shall not
[1:17:30] rule over one another with rigor
[1:17:33] so see if you bought an Egyptian slave
[1:17:35] they were yours and your families
[1:17:36] forever
[1:17:38] because thinking a lot of those a lot of
[1:17:39] those cases though they were refugees
[1:17:42] right they're just trying to live and so
[1:17:44] many of them would be happy just to have
[1:17:46] a job
[1:17:47] as a slave
[1:17:48] now of course I want to be modern it's
[1:17:50] not American slavery so don't don't ever
[1:17:51] put that American slavery and that was
[1:17:53] never God's system
[1:17:55] right that was a man-made Wicked sinful
[1:17:58] system
[1:17:59] but see these refugees they would they
[1:18:01] would gladly sell themselves in the
[1:18:03] service
[1:18:04] right because they would it would help
[1:18:06] them to live and help them to have a
[1:18:08] life and then they could have children
[1:18:09] they could have a wife and they could
[1:18:10] have children of course they'd always be
[1:18:12] uh the Servants of the Jews though
[1:18:14] they'd be that family's servants forever
[1:18:16] but at least they're alive
[1:18:18] at least they're not starving and dead
[1:18:20] somewhere right
[1:18:22] at least they're not being oppressed
[1:18:23] look how good God has these these Jews
[1:18:26] I'm sorry look how good God has the Jews
[1:18:28] treat their foreign slaves they get the
[1:18:30] fill of food they get the clothes they
[1:18:32] get children they get houses they get
[1:18:33] all these things praise God because
[1:18:35] remember once you were a slave amen
[1:18:38] once you were in bondage fear the lord
[1:18:41] thy God
[1:18:44] see it's quite a Godly system
[1:18:47] it's quite a wonderful Godly system
[1:18:49] verse 47 and if a Sojourner or stranger
[1:18:52] wax Rich by thee
[1:18:55] look they could even get rich Because of
[1:18:57] You blessing them
[1:18:59] I don't know how that worked I don't
[1:19:00] know if you'd give them some land I'm
[1:19:02] not sure how that would work but they'd
[1:19:03] have they'd have a need of something
[1:19:04] right they have they're starting to have
[1:19:06] a children
[1:19:07] if a Sojourner gets Rich by you and thy
[1:19:10] brother that dwelleth by him whacks poor
[1:19:12] and sell himself Under The Stranger or
[1:19:14] the Sojourner by the or to the stock of
[1:19:16] the strangers family now look at that
[1:19:17] your Jewish brother could go in uh
[1:19:20] service to this uh foreign
[1:19:24] a bond servant of yours that got rich
[1:19:28] somehow
[1:19:29] is that isn't that an interesting it's
[1:19:31] just amazing system
[1:19:32] look at that I mean what a land of
[1:19:34] opportunity brother William
[1:19:36] an Egyptian slave could get rich from
[1:19:38] the Jewish people
[1:19:39] and then he could he could hire Jewish
[1:19:42] servants too
[1:19:44] wow
[1:19:46] God is rich in mercy bye
[1:19:49] verse 48
[1:19:51] after that he is sold he may be redeemed
[1:19:53] again one of his brother may redeem him
[1:19:55] either his uncle or his uncle's son may
[1:19:57] redeem him or any that is not nigh of
[1:19:59] kin unto his unto him of his family may
[1:20:03] redeem or if he be able he may redeem
[1:20:05] himself see you work hard enough save up
[1:20:07] enough money he could redeem yourself
[1:20:10] and he shall reckon with him that bought
[1:20:12] him for from the year that he was sold
[1:20:14] unto him unto the Year of Jubilee and
[1:20:16] the price of his sail shall be according
[1:20:18] unto the number of years according to
[1:20:20] the time of and hired servant shall it
[1:20:22] be with him if there be yet many years
[1:20:24] behind according unto them he shall give
[1:20:27] again the price of his Redemption out of
[1:20:29] the money that he was bought for
[1:20:31] and if there remain but few years in the
[1:20:34] Year of Jubilee then he shall count unto
[1:20:36] him and according unto his years shall
[1:20:38] he give him again the price of his
[1:20:40] Redemption and as a yearly hired servant
[1:20:42] shall he be with him and so see yearly
[1:20:45] so it looks like they hired by years
[1:20:47] got to work a whole year for me right
[1:20:50] like that's you know when I became a
[1:20:51] teacher that's what before I was uh
[1:20:54] before I had tenure I was hired on a
[1:20:57] year basis
[1:20:58] so you might sign your contract you sign
[1:21:00] up for a year brother did you sign it
[1:21:01] just indefinitely
[1:21:05] not quite sure yet so yeah it's
[1:21:07] different at every place you know so I
[1:21:09] had to sign three one-year contracts
[1:21:11] after three years I got tenured in so I
[1:21:13] proved myself as a worker I got
[1:21:15] evaluated and now I'm just a perpetual
[1:21:17] worker there I don't have to sign a
[1:21:19] contract every year they just know I'm
[1:21:20] going to work there every year well in
[1:21:22] Israel it was a yearly contract
[1:21:26] verse 53.
[1:21:28] and let's finish 53 second part and the
[1:21:31] other shall not rule with Vigor over him
[1:21:33] in thy sight
[1:21:35] and if he be not redeemed in these years
[1:21:37] then he shall go out in the year of the
[1:21:39] Jubilee both he and his children with
[1:21:41] him
[1:21:42] okay so there's that Jewish man that
[1:21:44] Jewish man could be redeemed right and
[1:21:46] he and his children could go out
[1:21:48] verse 55 For unto me the children of
[1:21:51] Israel are servants they they are my
[1:21:53] servants whom I brought forth on land of
[1:21:55] Egypt I am the Lord your God hallelujah
[1:21:58] everybody said
[1:21:59] amen so see we're getting some good uh
[1:22:01] understanding here I'm gonna get a good
[1:22:02] understanding so far amen I was really
[1:22:05] blessed to see this as I've been
[1:22:06] studying this
[1:22:07] so let's look at a few two points here
[1:22:09] Heathen servants could not be purchased
[1:22:12] I'm sorry Heathen servants could be
[1:22:13] purchased and some corporal punishment
[1:22:15] was permitted
[1:22:18] okay
[1:22:20] um and we'll get to that a little bit
[1:22:21] here second the Jewish system which was
[1:22:23] voluntary they were indentured servants
[1:22:26] it promoted poor Jews a chance to
[1:22:29] recover their livelihoods independence
[1:22:31] and possessions
[1:22:34] remember we already read it out of
[1:22:35] Exodus 21 it was a six or seven year
[1:22:38] term they were set free sometime in the
[1:22:40] seventh year
[1:22:41] right if it was the contract was seven
[1:22:43] years
[1:22:45] okay so that's a good a good review
[1:22:46] there by God's grace amen
[1:22:49] now we're going to Exodus 21. now that's
[1:22:51] a that's a that's a real striking
[1:22:54] chapter right there so that's where
[1:22:55] there's only one real there's only one
[1:22:57] and Austin and I were talking about this
[1:22:58] there's only one real verse in the Bible
[1:22:59] that's kind of hard to understand so we
[1:23:01] have to look at all the context of all
[1:23:03] the other things we've already read and
[1:23:04] we got to try to understand that based
[1:23:06] upon the context so the wording is just
[1:23:08] a little challenging just like in the
[1:23:10] New Testament all right sometimes things
[1:23:11] the wording is challenging like with
[1:23:12] Paul on the road to Damascus who
[1:23:15] actually heard the voice of the Lord who
[1:23:16] actually saw the light the wording is
[1:23:18] really challenging
[1:23:19] right we're not exactly sure
[1:23:21] and so we just say well God's word is
[1:23:23] right God's probably hiding it from the
[1:23:26] eyes of the wise and prudent right
[1:23:27] giving these uh Sinners an excuse to say
[1:23:29] well the Bible has mistakes and yet the
[1:23:31] Bible has so much truth in it all truth
[1:23:33] in it God's probably hiding it from the
[1:23:35] eyes of the wise and prudent now here's
[1:23:38] where we get a little bit uh
[1:23:40] there's more a little more uh serious
[1:23:42] here
[1:23:43] corporal punishment was commonplace for
[1:23:45] thousands of years it still is in some
[1:23:47] countries like Singapore
[1:23:49] I'll never forget when I was in high
[1:23:51] school we used to have this TV and we
[1:23:52] watched this news program every day and
[1:23:54] there was this American Teenager
[1:23:57] vacationing in Singapore and he did some
[1:23:59] graffiti and they whipped him with a a
[1:24:02] cane was it like 20 times and it was
[1:24:04] like worldwide news
[1:24:07] and it really it was like you you
[1:24:09] know like like why is the world become
[1:24:11] so like why are we so sisified you
[1:24:13] know
[1:24:13] it used to be commonplace to have now
[1:24:15] does anybody want to get beat with a rod
[1:24:16] no but you should know when you go into
[1:24:18] a country you got to keep their laws
[1:24:20] it was a rebellious American teenage
[1:24:22] that's a problem
[1:24:24] his parents are probably Rebels to begin
[1:24:25] with right but not maybe maybe not but
[1:24:27] maybe
[1:24:29] and so it's a big deal I can still see
[1:24:31] his picture I can't remember his name
[1:24:34] it was a big deal should there be
[1:24:35] Corporation punishment well I wonder if
[1:24:37] he ever did that graffiti ever again
[1:24:38] what do you think
[1:24:41] probably not because he probably didn't
[1:24:42] want to be whipped again
[1:24:44] right like I told you I was whipped one
[1:24:46] time with a belt for putting my dirty
[1:24:49] hands on the wall running and laughing
[1:24:51] in the house I never put my dirty hands
[1:24:53] on the wall again after that whipping
[1:24:55] because I learned what's called a lesson
[1:24:58] I learn respect I learned obedience
[1:25:00] through the pain that I suffered
[1:25:02] in the natural
[1:25:05] that's why our children sometimes need
[1:25:07] gentle spankings I'll say
[1:25:10] because the world wants to make it abuse
[1:25:12] every time they want to make it and some
[1:25:13] parents have because they're not born
[1:25:15] again or they lose control and all they
[1:25:16] got to do is say sorry
[1:25:18] but a real Holy Ghost feel Christian
[1:25:20] though they'll administer that that
[1:25:22] corporal punishment with the love of God
[1:25:24] behind it not with an angry bitter or I
[1:25:27] wish you were never my child I can't
[1:25:29] believe and you're just going to be a
[1:25:30] failure no you're doing it with love
[1:25:32] because you know they're going to grow
[1:25:33] up you know you had to be punished you
[1:25:36] you know you learn lessons and you know
[1:25:37] they'll learn their lesson and they'll
[1:25:39] grow up to be a real servant of God
[1:25:41] because this is God's Heritage not yours
[1:25:45] you didn't create this child Although
[1:25:46] our mothers knit him in the womb the
[1:25:47] Bible said God need him in the womb
[1:25:49] praise God
[1:25:50] Hallelujah these are God's Heritage and
[1:25:53] so we treat him with Godly respect and
[1:25:55] the fear of the Lord
[1:25:57] so it's it's clear from the scripture
[1:25:59] Jews would use rods to correct their own
[1:26:01] children
[1:26:03] right so Jewish families would would
[1:26:05] punish their Jewish children with a rod
[1:26:08] that was common
[1:26:09] rod
[1:26:10] right
[1:26:12] even adult Jews could be punished with
[1:26:15] rods if the judges approved of it
[1:26:18] which reminds us of Singapore which if
[1:26:21] you go to Singapore from what I've heard
[1:26:22] it's the cleanest country in the world
[1:26:24] because they punish with rods
[1:26:27] and nobody wants to get beat on the back
[1:26:29] with rods
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:32] sees how to see how there's some wisdom
[1:26:33] in this
[1:26:36] let's go to Deuteronomy 25.
[1:26:39] did we redether I don't think so we read
[1:26:41] apportionately
[1:26:48] of course remember Church these people
[1:26:50] are not born again
[1:26:53] right when you're born again is
[1:26:54] different you know you can you can uh
[1:26:56] you're more mature you have the
[1:26:57] anointings you have Temperance you have
[1:26:58] all these things you have brotherly
[1:26:59] kindness
[1:27:01] but these people were not born again
[1:27:03] they cannot have the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:04] their soul
[1:27:05] and so God allowed some corporal
[1:27:07] punishment
[1:27:09] 25 one to three if there be a
[1:27:11] controversy between men and they come
[1:27:13] unto judgment that the judges May judge
[1:27:15] them then shall they justify the
[1:27:18] righteous and condemn the wicked
[1:27:20] and it shall be if the Wicked Man be
[1:27:22] worthy to be beaten
[1:27:24] that the judge shall cause him to lie
[1:27:26] down and to be beaten before his face
[1:27:27] according to his fault by a certain
[1:27:29] number remember it was never over 39
[1:27:31] because they thought 40 would kill a man
[1:27:34] for 40 Stripes he may give him
[1:27:36] and not exceed less if he should exceed
[1:27:39] and beat him above these with many
[1:27:41] stripes and thy brother should seem vile
[1:27:44] unto thee wow so 40 they thought 40 was
[1:27:47] enough so the Jews would just take one
[1:27:49] away from that and make it 39.
[1:27:53] okay so these are adults grown adults
[1:27:57] without the baptism the Holy Ghost need
[1:27:59] some physical spankings
[1:28:01] and look what it can produce a good I
[1:28:03] mean produce some peace
[1:28:06] it can produce some obedience in some
[1:28:07] way in the natural we can see that today
[1:28:09] even today
[1:28:11] so here's an example
[1:28:13] um adult Jews and foreign servants
[1:28:15] guilty of fornication could be punished
[1:28:19] he with a sacrifice and she with the rod
[1:28:23] so if I'm a unmarried man saw an
[1:28:26] Egyptian slave and he
[1:28:28] and he and she agreed to have relations
[1:28:31] the Bible said whoever lied calmly with
[1:28:33] a woman that it's a Bond woman betrayal
[1:28:35] to a husband oh yeah and she was already
[1:28:36] engaged and not at all redeemed she
[1:28:38] wasn't redeemed yet she was still a
[1:28:40] foreigner
[1:28:41] nor Freedom given her she shall be
[1:28:43] scared so she would get whipped
[1:28:47] again because she's not a Jew they shall
[1:28:49] not be put to death because she was not
[1:28:51] free
[1:28:53] now you will see later free Jews if they
[1:28:56] did that could be put to death
[1:28:58] if he raped if a Jew if a man raped a
[1:29:01] Jewish woman because he was free and he
[1:29:04] raped her he could be put to death
[1:29:06] and she as long as she cried out she
[1:29:08] didn't have any punishment
[1:29:10] if she didn't cry out they both were
[1:29:11] stoned
[1:29:15] and he shall bring his trespass offering
[1:29:18] unto the Lord unto the door of the
[1:29:19] Tabernacle the congregation even a RAM
[1:29:21] for a trespass offering and the priest
[1:29:23] should make an atonement for him with
[1:29:24] the ram of the trespass offering before
[1:29:26] the Lord is sit before the Lord for his
[1:29:28] sin which he had done and the sin which
[1:29:30] he had done shall be forgiven him so God
[1:29:31] would forgive fornication of a Jewish
[1:29:34] man with a heathen servant girl
[1:29:38] okay
[1:29:41] now notice also a Jewish man was
[1:29:44] obligated to marry Jewish woman he would
[1:29:46] entice
[1:29:48] to lie with him
[1:29:50] in other words there was never any sex
[1:29:52] before marriage was ever allowed it
[1:29:54] wasn't allowed in the days of Moses
[1:29:58] okay because let's read Exodus 22. if a
[1:30:00] man in Tyson made that is not betrothed
[1:30:02] then lie with her he shall surely endow
[1:30:04] her to be his wife so he had to take her
[1:30:06] as his wife if her father utterly
[1:30:08] refused to give her unto him he shall
[1:30:10] pay money according to the Dowry of
[1:30:11] burdens so he still had to pay the full
[1:30:13] price to buy her as a wife but she would
[1:30:15] not be his wife
[1:30:16] so either he had to take her or pay the
[1:30:18] full price of a wife which was very
[1:30:20] expensive
[1:30:23] okay so see God never allowed sex before
[1:30:25] marriage it was always punishable with
[1:30:28] something
[1:30:30] now it was death to lie about purity
[1:30:33] before marriage and death for rape so
[1:30:36] let's read that Deuteronomy 22. remember
[1:30:39] all these laws got to be kept into
[1:30:40] account that's why when someone says oh
[1:30:42] Jewish men could sell their daughters
[1:30:44] into sex slaves that's it goes against
[1:30:46] all these promise all these other verses
[1:30:49] only someone who's ignorant of the word
[1:30:51] of God would make such a slanderous
[1:30:53] accusation against God
[1:30:55] Deuteronomy 22 20.
[1:31:02] but if this thing be true and the tokens
[1:31:04] of The Virginity be not found for the
[1:31:06] damsel then shall they bring out the
[1:31:08] damsel to the door of her father's house
[1:31:10] and the men of this the city shall Stone
[1:31:11] her with stones that she died because
[1:31:14] she hath wrought Folly in Israel to play
[1:31:16] the in her father's house so she
[1:31:18] wasn't true about whether she was a
[1:31:20] virgin or not so shall thou put evil
[1:31:23] away from among you
[1:31:26] again God does not permit fornication
[1:31:28] right
[1:31:30] if a man be found lying with a woman
[1:31:32] married to a husband that's adultery
[1:31:35] then they shall both of them die so
[1:31:37] think of all the deaths that would be in
[1:31:38] America today
[1:31:40] because of adultery
[1:31:44] both the man that lay with the woman and
[1:31:47] and the woman so shall thou put away
[1:31:50] evil from Israel look at that death for
[1:31:52] adultery death so see that's why people
[1:31:55] say oh Jewish the Jewish men could just
[1:31:58] rape their servant women absolutely not
[1:32:01] they couldn't even do it they of course
[1:32:02] they wouldn't even do it to a Jewish
[1:32:04] woman they'd die
[1:32:05] so of course they couldn't take one of
[1:32:07] their slaves and just sleep with the
[1:32:09] slave
[1:32:10] it was death
[1:32:13] verse 23 if a damsel that is a virgin be
[1:32:16] betrothed unto a husband and a man
[1:32:18] finder in the city and lie with her then
[1:32:21] he shall bring them both out unto the
[1:32:23] Gate of the city and ye shall Stone them
[1:32:25] with stones that they shall die
[1:32:30] see because she was already betrothed to
[1:32:32] another man
[1:32:33] right she was already engaged this is
[1:32:35] why engagements are really serious
[1:32:37] Now in America they're not but they are
[1:32:39] with Christians
[1:32:42] the dams are because she cried not being
[1:32:44] in the cities that means she
[1:32:45] uh wasn't against that she was uh
[1:32:49] partaking in it
[1:32:53] being in the city and the man because he
[1:32:55] hath humbled his neighbor's wife so Thou
[1:32:57] shalt put away evil from among you but
[1:33:00] if a man find a betrayal of dams on a
[1:33:01] field and the man forced her and lie
[1:33:03] with her then that man only that lay
[1:33:05] with her shall die see and the church
[1:33:07] said
[1:33:08] see anyone any rapists would be
[1:33:10] instantly dead
[1:33:12] you don't get a second chance in Moses
[1:33:14] day you rape you die you adulterate you
[1:33:16] die
[1:33:17] see that
[1:33:20] so God's laws for servants had to mash
[1:33:22] and line up with ease
[1:33:24] there's no contradictions in God's Bible
[1:33:26] and the church said
[1:33:29] but unto the damsel Thou shalt do
[1:33:31] nothing theirs in the damsel no sin
[1:33:33] worthy of death for as when a man riseth
[1:33:35] against his neighbor and saith him even
[1:33:37] so this is the matter see that's that's
[1:33:39] what a rapist is it's the same as a
[1:33:41] murderer
[1:33:42] because you're you're destroying that
[1:33:44] person's Spirit right a broken Spirit
[1:33:46] who can bear
[1:33:48] verse 27 for he found her in the field
[1:33:50] and the betrothed damsel cried and there
[1:33:52] was none to save her
[1:33:54] I'm gonna do it on time okay I'm doing
[1:33:55] pretty good my gosh guys I'm almost a
[1:33:56] little over an hour now
[1:33:58] uh
[1:34:01] verse 28 if a man find a damsel that is
[1:34:03] a virgin which is not betrothed and lay
[1:34:05] a hold of her and lie with her and they
[1:34:07] be found then the man that lay with her
[1:34:10] shall give unto the damsels father 50
[1:34:12] shekels of silver and she shall be his
[1:34:14] wife so see any fornication instant
[1:34:16] marriage
[1:34:17] instant marriage
[1:34:20] because he hath humbled her he may not
[1:34:22] put away all of his days in other words
[1:34:24] he had to live with his decision the
[1:34:26] rest of his life
[1:34:28] it's not like today where you can have
[1:34:29] fornication adultery there's no
[1:34:31] consequence now there will be
[1:34:32] consequences at the white Throne
[1:34:33] judgment
[1:34:34] or and in this life too sometimes
[1:34:36] not all the time
[1:34:39] but instantly there were consequences
[1:34:41] you did the wrong decision you pay the
[1:34:43] price
[1:34:44] verse 30. a man should not take his
[1:34:46] father's wife nor discover his father's
[1:34:48] skirt so there's incest of course and
[1:34:50] that was by death as well there's other
[1:34:53] scriptures where incense in incest was
[1:34:55] was death was a death punishment as well
[1:34:58] or is that helpful by God's grace
[1:35:01] all right now corporal punishment was
[1:35:03] again commonplace for thousands of years
[1:35:04] Paul was scourged five times beaten with
[1:35:06] ruts that was according to the law
[1:35:08] remember in the 1600s you could be
[1:35:09] hanging for cross-dressing I put that in
[1:35:11] my book
[1:35:12] you could be hanged
[1:35:14] that's why nobody cross-dressed right
[1:35:16] but eventually it was just prison 200
[1:35:18] years later you just go to prison if you
[1:35:20] put on a woman's garment if you're a man
[1:35:21] or a woman if you put on a man's garment
[1:35:23] you just go to prison you wouldn't you
[1:35:24] wouldn't be killed so see how it became
[1:35:26] less and less and less slowly over the
[1:35:29] years
[1:35:31] but just 400 years ago you would die in
[1:35:34] England
[1:35:35] if you cross-dressed
[1:35:39] and that's why brother Brown would make
[1:35:40] that statement about cutting your hair
[1:35:41] because that's what God thinks of it
[1:35:43] it's such a disgrace for a woman to cut
[1:35:45] her hair it's such a disgrace for a man
[1:35:47] to grow up dreadlocks and the church
[1:35:48] said
[1:35:51] it's a disgrace you're dishonoring your
[1:35:52] head which ultimately turns out to be
[1:35:54] Christ and above Christ is the invisible
[1:35:56] God
[1:35:58] it's a form of disrespect your outward
[1:35:59] appearance it either disrespects or it
[1:36:02] respects God thank God we're all
[1:36:03] honoring God here today praise God with
[1:36:05] your outward appearance because God has
[1:36:07] done inward work inside your heart
[1:36:13] now just so you know the word slavery is
[1:36:15] only twice in the King James version
[1:36:16] it's only twice it's in Jeremiah 2 and
[1:36:19] then Revelation 18 13. so see slavery
[1:36:22] wasn't a common word used in the King
[1:36:24] James days the 1600s
[1:36:27] for my people have committed two evils
[1:36:29] they have forsaken me the Fountain of
[1:36:30] Living Waters and hewed them out
[1:36:32] cisterns broken cisterns that can hold
[1:36:34] no water
[1:36:37] is Israel's servant is he a home-born
[1:36:39] slave why is he spoiled
[1:36:42] okay so in other words Israel should not
[1:36:45] be slaves they should be free
[1:36:47] God said I called you out of Egypt to
[1:36:49] make you free praise God why would you
[1:36:51] be enslaved to idolatry
[1:36:54] now Revelation 18 knows about the
[1:36:56] Judgment of the mother Harlot we believe
[1:36:58] his future brother Adam said thus saith
[1:36:59] the Lord he said it'll be the wrong
[1:37:00] it'll be the Russian government that
[1:37:02] will bomb the Vatican and be destroyed
[1:37:05] in one hour
[1:37:07] standing afar off for the fear of her
[1:37:09] torment saying alas alas that great city
[1:37:11] of Babylon that Mighty City for in one
[1:37:13] hour is thy judgment come
[1:37:15] that's the one hour is the Russian bombs
[1:37:18] We Believe
[1:37:19] and cinnamon and odors and ointments and
[1:37:21] frankincense and wine and oil and fine
[1:37:23] flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and
[1:37:24] horses and Terrace and slaves and Souls
[1:37:27] of men so the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:37:29] guilty of slavery now
[1:37:31] now you can let your imagine go and your
[1:37:33] imagination go
[1:37:35] I don't know how to define that
[1:37:37] but the Bible says they have slaves at
[1:37:39] the end time now what about uh what
[1:37:42] about the children the sex trafficking
[1:37:43] that's the word I'm looking for
[1:37:45] what about this sex trafficking who's in
[1:37:47] charge of that now we know the drug
[1:37:48] mafias but who's behind that
[1:37:52] the Bible said the Roman Catholic Church
[1:37:54] is behind that
[1:37:57] all right now one brother emailed me and
[1:37:59] he said he said is this verse about all
[1:38:02] those ships that are backed up in the in
[1:38:05] the ports you know how we've had that
[1:38:07] since covered what are those called
[1:38:08] again
[1:38:09] the cargo ships remember they're backed
[1:38:10] up in ports and so there's like a supply
[1:38:13] chain issue I said well brother that's a
[1:38:15] good thought it might be I said only
[1:38:16] time will tell
[1:38:19] so you have all these Goods backed up in
[1:38:21] the Harbors right
[1:38:23] so we'll see I don't know see I'm not a
[1:38:26] prophet so I I can't say for sure I
[1:38:28] haven't seen the vision right
[1:38:31] all right now I've already gone over
[1:38:32] that somehow the Roman Catholic Church
[1:38:33] is guilty of all murders somehow all the
[1:38:36] slain on the Earth
[1:38:37] so again pre-civil War slavery does not
[1:38:41] resemble the Jewish system of
[1:38:42] servanthood at all there's no hardly
[1:38:45] anything at all that resembles
[1:38:47] and I'm going to show you again that
[1:38:48] picture so if you don't like it you know
[1:38:49] I mean you can turn your eyes but again
[1:38:51] this this did not happen this kind of
[1:38:54] abuse did not happen in Jewish
[1:38:56] slavery as long as they were God-fearing
[1:38:58] people I don't know what could have
[1:38:59] happened but
[1:39:00] God did not call for this
[1:39:04] all right remember the proof was now
[1:39:06] here's a good one we haven't read yet
[1:39:08] you received the death penalty for
[1:39:10] kidnapping and selling or planning to
[1:39:13] sell person that's how that pre-civil
[1:39:15] war
[1:39:17] um pre-civil War slavery system got
[1:39:19] started they would go into countries and
[1:39:20] kidnap slaves and take them and sell
[1:39:22] them to other places well in God's eyes
[1:39:24] if you kidnap anybody or even make a
[1:39:26] plan to kidnap somebody you're dead
[1:39:29] you don't get a second chance
[1:39:32] if we went to somebody's house and they
[1:39:33] had plans well here I'm gonna tomorrow
[1:39:35] morning I'm gonna go and steal these
[1:39:36] children they would we'd Stone them
[1:39:37] right there
[1:39:39] just the plan about it
[1:39:42] right that's how much God valued
[1:39:44] people's freedom
[1:39:46] I say hallelujah we serve a loving God
[1:39:49] Church
[1:39:49] don't let these Liars you know deceive
[1:39:51] us or make us doubt anything God is a
[1:39:53] gracious and merciful and loving God
[1:39:55] he's the god of redeeming praise God
[1:39:57] he's the god of giving you back your
[1:39:59] inheritance Hallelujah he's the god of
[1:40:01] bringing the poor into into riches
[1:40:03] praise God he's the god of Mercy
[1:40:05] Hallelujah
[1:40:06] just never forget where you came from he
[1:40:08] says that's what he told Israel don't
[1:40:10] forget you used to be a Slave
[1:40:12] don't forget I brought you out of
[1:40:14] slavery so show Mercy to everyone
[1:40:16] hallelujah praise God
[1:40:18] I like you just my own personal
[1:40:20] testimony
[1:40:21] I like the fact I was raised poor
[1:40:24] so because I'm raised poor I know the
[1:40:26] value of money and so because I was
[1:40:27] raised poor and people gave money to my
[1:40:29] family when I was poor I gladly give it
[1:40:31] out to people that need money
[1:40:33] and I'm thankful I was raised into
[1:40:34] poverty because I know the suffering of
[1:40:37] it and so I can easily give
[1:40:39] and it's just it's a natural thing to do
[1:40:41] I want to give back because God has
[1:40:42] given so much to me praise God
[1:40:45] he that stealth the man sell the man or
[1:40:48] if he be found in his hand he shall
[1:40:49] surely be put to death so God never
[1:40:51] supported any slavery system like the
[1:40:55] pre a pre-american pre-civil war I'm
[1:40:57] sorry pre-civil War slavery system they
[1:40:59] would kidnap people
[1:41:02] proof number two Jewish servanthood was
[1:41:05] a voluntary system that some of these
[1:41:06] are review
[1:41:08] and it was agreed upon in order to get
[1:41:11] out of debt a member of the Bible says
[1:41:12] we should we read this we shall not use
[1:41:14] rigor God will not let you be harsh or
[1:41:17] cruel or severe with any of your
[1:41:19] servants
[1:41:21] you had to show respect unto them
[1:41:25] if a Jewish man killed a and here's the
[1:41:28] only there's the only scripture that's
[1:41:30] kind of hard to understand
[1:41:32] if a Jewish man killed a Jewish servant
[1:41:34] he owned he lost his own life because
[1:41:37] you killed your brother
[1:41:39] so there was there might have been
[1:41:40] corporal punishment for slaves right
[1:41:43] because they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:41:44] and you might have to kind of punish
[1:41:45] them in order to get them obey but if
[1:41:47] you killed one of your servants you died
[1:41:49] as well
[1:41:52] he that's mighteth the man so that he
[1:41:54] die he shall surely be put to death
[1:41:56] go down to verse 20. if a man Smite a
[1:41:59] servant or is made with a rod and he
[1:42:01] shall die under his hand he shall be
[1:42:04] surely punished
[1:42:06] now we already know up here if he kills
[1:42:09] that man he dies we already know that
[1:42:11] it's in the same chapter
[1:42:13] so he'll be punished
[1:42:16] now here's the only one I don't
[1:42:17] understand notwithstanding if we
[1:42:18] continue a day or two he shall not be
[1:42:21] punished for he is his money
[1:42:25] so it looks like if if a man
[1:42:28] beats a servant his servant dies he
[1:42:30] shall be put to death
[1:42:32] but if he beats his servant with
[1:42:34] corporal punishment and he continues a
[1:42:36] day or two there's no punishment because
[1:42:38] his money because it looks like he loses
[1:42:40] out on the service that that servant
[1:42:43] would give to him because he's sick
[1:42:44] those few days he misses out on the work
[1:42:46] he would have done out in the field
[1:42:49] that's what it looks like to me
[1:42:51] but see sinners like the like Austin's
[1:42:53] friend that we were talking to
[1:42:54] and may God give them repentance but
[1:42:57] they said this verse proves you you can
[1:42:59] kill a servant or you can if you kill a
[1:43:01] servant you die but if you if you just
[1:43:03] hurt them for a couple of days there's
[1:43:05] no punishment
[1:43:06] well the Bible doesn't say whether this
[1:43:08] person lives or dies it looks like they
[1:43:09] get revived
[1:43:11] right looks like they're only sick for a
[1:43:13] couple days or they're only in pain for
[1:43:14] a couple days
[1:43:16] okay but remember earlier in the chapter
[1:43:17] that's why context is always King you
[1:43:19] always have to understand read the whole
[1:43:21] Bible look at the whole context look at
[1:43:23] all the books of the Bible praise God
[1:43:24] hallelujah don't add and here in this
[1:43:26] case don't take away from the word of
[1:43:28] God
[1:43:29] that's what these Sinners do they take
[1:43:30] away from the word of God they take away
[1:43:32] this but the Bible already says if you
[1:43:34] kill a man you lose your life too
[1:43:37] all right
[1:43:39] so this one just a little bit difficult
[1:43:41] to understand but if you look at the
[1:43:42] context you kill someone you get killed
[1:43:45] you kill your servant you're going to be
[1:43:46] punished likely with death
[1:43:48] right
[1:43:51] but if you beat somebody punish one and
[1:43:54] they they're sick for one or two days
[1:43:57] you that person represents your money
[1:43:59] that person represents uh your help and
[1:44:02] you lose out on that help
[1:44:06] uh we already went over this but you
[1:44:07] could not charge
[1:44:09] Jews interest
[1:44:13] I'm not going to go over that because we
[1:44:14] already did that one here's what I'll
[1:44:15] yeah here's what I like if you seriously
[1:44:18] hurt a servant he or she went free so
[1:44:22] you had to be careful how you treated
[1:44:23] them
[1:44:24] and look all the debts were clear let's
[1:44:26] say this person owed you ten thousand
[1:44:28] dollars you're gonna work for 10 years
[1:44:29] or whatever
[1:44:30] if you mistreat them you lose out on
[1:44:32] your ten thousand dollars
[1:44:34] sorry
[1:44:35] your fault can you imagine that
[1:44:37] if a man Smite the eye of his servant
[1:44:39] see if you if you whip that person hit
[1:44:41] him in the eye or the eye was made that
[1:44:42] appears he shall let him go free for his
[1:44:45] eyes sake just one eye now that's a lot
[1:44:49] don't get wrong that's a lot but I'm
[1:44:50] just saying you lose out on all those
[1:44:52] years of service all that you lose on
[1:44:54] all of it because they lost something
[1:44:55] very valuable to them
[1:44:58] or if you smite his manservant's tooth
[1:45:01] and he loses tooth he gets to go for
[1:45:03] free for one two look at that one tooth
[1:45:07] if you hurt them permanently you lose
[1:45:09] out
[1:45:12] so what do you think have you lost a
[1:45:14] finger you'd probably go free
[1:45:17] right you lost the ear Go free God's not
[1:45:19] saying well just teeth are protected
[1:45:21] under the law or just eyes and teeth are
[1:45:22] protected no he's giving you he's giving
[1:45:24] this uh giving us as a as a
[1:45:27] as a principal if you take something
[1:45:29] permanently you lose out
[1:45:33] that's what I love about the word of God
[1:45:34] right there see people they won't they
[1:45:37] won't they won't tell you about this one
[1:45:39] let's just focus on these questionable
[1:45:40] verses uh
[1:45:42] and they won't tell you about this
[1:45:45] if you take their tooth you lose out on
[1:45:47] your whole debt that they owe you
[1:45:49] think about that somebody owe you 20
[1:45:51] grand you accidentally knock their tooth
[1:45:52] out you don't get your 20 20 grand back
[1:45:56] all right better start working harder
[1:45:58] yeah
[1:46:00] you gotta live with it you're not gonna
[1:46:01] get that money back
[1:46:02] they might owe you but you're not
[1:46:04] getting it back because you took
[1:46:04] something permanent from them
[1:46:06] you hurt their body more than what you
[1:46:08] should have
[1:46:11] so did Jewish fathers sell their
[1:46:12] daughters into Savory here's the verse
[1:46:14] we read it
[1:46:16] if a man sells daughter to be a
[1:46:18] maidservant she shall not go out as the
[1:46:20] men's servants do if she please not her
[1:46:21] master who have betrothed her to himself
[1:46:23] so in this case he bought a a Jewish
[1:46:25] girl and he was going to marry her right
[1:46:28] then shall he let her be redeemed to
[1:46:30] sell her unto a strange Nation he shall
[1:46:33] have no power so he's got to keep that
[1:46:34] girl in the family in the Jewish
[1:46:37] community
[1:46:38] seeing that it's dealt deceitfully with
[1:46:40] her see he promised he's going to marry
[1:46:41] her but then he's like ah you don't
[1:46:42] please me he can't sell her to somebody
[1:46:44] else he's got to provide her food
[1:46:46] clothing everything unless somebody else
[1:46:48] marries her
[1:46:50] also here's a good point this was from a
[1:46:52] video I watched
[1:46:54] these Jewish contractual servants
[1:46:56] their sons and daughters would have
[1:46:58] likely lived among their own tribes or
[1:47:00] kindred
[1:47:02] okay so let's take it back to our day
[1:47:03] let's just use like the hmongs let's use
[1:47:05] a mom you know so like the Hmong would
[1:47:07] be like a Jewish Community right and so
[1:47:09] if they would ever uh hire out their
[1:47:11] sons or daughters that person would
[1:47:13] always stay in among culture so they'd
[1:47:15] always be treated like the hmong's
[1:47:16] freedom right or Americans if it was my
[1:47:18] I'm American you know so it'd always be
[1:47:20] they'd be treated like an American
[1:47:22] right they could not be sold to another
[1:47:24] group of people
[1:47:25] they were always living within their
[1:47:27] family
[1:47:30] see a daughter would be contracted to
[1:47:32] work maybe to pay off a father's debt
[1:47:34] let's say she's old enough she's 15 or
[1:47:35] whatever
[1:47:37] he could allow her to sign a contract he
[1:47:40] would sign the contract for her and she
[1:47:41] would go work seven years to help pay
[1:47:42] off the dad's debt but if she got
[1:47:44] married in that time she could get
[1:47:45] married right should get married
[1:47:48] now I like this here the Kinsmen
[1:47:50] Redeemer and we see this in the Book of
[1:47:51] Ruth
[1:47:52] he was a tribal overseer whose
[1:47:55] responsibility was to ensure laws were
[1:47:57] carried out for his people's protection
[1:48:00] and this is why Boaz became the Kinsmen
[1:48:02] Redeemer
[1:48:04] right because Naomi and Ruth were in her
[1:48:07] his family within his kin right and so
[1:48:09] they had to make sure everybody even
[1:48:11] these women with no husbands we have to
[1:48:13] make sure they're treated right we have
[1:48:14] to do justice to them and God brought
[1:48:17] such Justice praise God he brought Ruth
[1:48:18] into it a Sojourner amen God brought a
[1:48:21] Sojourner in and then he puts his sojour
[1:48:23] into this woman of Faith Ruth he puts
[1:48:25] her in the very lineage of his Messiah
[1:48:27] Jesus Christ Hallelujah Ah that's the
[1:48:29] grace of God bring that Stranger in and
[1:48:32] she's going to eventually out of her
[1:48:33] loins I've heard her husband's loins are
[1:48:35] going to come David and Solomon and then
[1:48:37] Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's how much
[1:48:40] God loves a stranger amen hallelujah but
[1:48:43] Boaz was the kinsman redeemer he had to
[1:48:45] go to the gate and talk to all the
[1:48:47] judges well this one man are you going
[1:48:49] to redeem uh Naomi if you do you got to
[1:48:51] buy Ruth too
[1:48:53] he said no I can't do it whatever reason
[1:48:55] he said well then this day you're all
[1:48:57] these all these other Kinsmen they're
[1:48:59] they're witnesses that I purchased Naomi
[1:49:01] that I can get Ruth
[1:49:03] is that right Church
[1:49:05] then he takes under her Ruth well this
[1:49:07] is what would happen see they would keep
[1:49:08] these uh these family members within the
[1:49:10] family so they were protected Hallelujah
[1:49:13] God is a god of protection Hallelujah
[1:49:15] and God can take a poor old woman like
[1:49:17] like Naomi praised God who had no more
[1:49:20] uh no more husband praise God and yet
[1:49:22] then her in her old age could could give
[1:49:25] suck to a baby praise God oh my it's a
[1:49:28] beautiful thing in other words God will
[1:49:30] restore all the years that the Palmer
[1:49:32] word hath eaten I'll restore saith the
[1:49:34] Lord amen I'm going to make this woman
[1:49:36] who had no children I'm going to give
[1:49:38] her a child Hallelujah and this old
[1:49:40] woman weaned the baby praise God
[1:49:42] because God's system allowed them to
[1:49:45] bring the families back together to give
[1:49:48] them restoration to bring to give them
[1:49:51] their inheritance back amen hallelujah
[1:49:53] and God set up Kinsmen to make sure
[1:49:55] these laws were followed
[1:49:57] because God cares about each and every
[1:49:59] one by God's grace
[1:50:02] Hallelujah
[1:50:03] see Boaz offered Roost purchase
[1:50:07] to her nearest Kinsmen but he refused
[1:50:10] Naomi and Russia I should have put that
[1:50:12] one in there as well because uh Ruth was
[1:50:15] not in Kinsman Naomi was the near was
[1:50:16] the Kinsmen but Boaz was the kinsman
[1:50:19] redeemer and he offered the purchase of
[1:50:22] Naomi but because he wouldn't do it
[1:50:23] Boaz could do it he got both back praise
[1:50:26] God
[1:50:27] and then Ruth married to a Jew she gets
[1:50:29] full
[1:50:30] Jewish rights even as a moabite amen now
[1:50:34] that she's married to a Jew she gets
[1:50:36] full Jewish rights praise God and
[1:50:38] through her comes the very Messiah
[1:50:40] Hallelujah
[1:50:41] beautiful beautiful all right let's
[1:50:43] close with this here I'm going to try to
[1:50:44] close here in the next five or ten
[1:50:45] minutes here so let me set my timer here
[1:50:47] for 10 minutes have you enjoyed this
[1:50:48] today bye guys Grace amen I'm glad you I
[1:50:51] thought I'd take a little you know
[1:50:52] different thought I hadn't taken this
[1:50:53] one
[1:50:54] that's a blessing to you
[1:50:57] now remember in the New Testament I
[1:50:59] preach this a little bit sparingly
[1:51:01] before
[1:51:04] Paul never tried to do away with the
[1:51:07] Roman slavery
[1:51:10] because he knew that wasn't his
[1:51:11] Commission
[1:51:12] that was Abraham Lincoln's commission
[1:51:14] for America right
[1:51:15] not Roman but if you've fast forward all
[1:51:18] those years 1500 years
[1:51:20] or 2000 years
[1:51:22] God ordained Abraham Lincoln and the
[1:51:24] leaders of that day to bring America out
[1:51:27] of the slavery system
[1:51:29] but remember
[1:51:30] onesimus was a servant in the Roman
[1:51:33] system
[1:51:34] Philemon was his owner onesimus ran away
[1:51:38] he was he was deserter he could have
[1:51:39] been killed because of that
[1:51:42] but he goes to Paul Paul gets him saved
[1:51:45] he gets he repents he gets baptized in
[1:51:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:51:50] Paul sends his letter to Philemon sends
[1:51:52] it back and he said receive onesimus as
[1:51:56] my son in the Lord
[1:51:58] and Paul said whatever money you lost
[1:52:00] because of him put it on my account and
[1:52:03] I'll be happy to pay it
[1:52:04] Hallelujah
[1:52:07] your slave ran away and then if your
[1:52:10] slave ran away but it was a sinner now
[1:52:12] he comes back as a Christian you're
[1:52:13] supposed to completely forgive him
[1:52:15] according to Paul Hallelujah make him a
[1:52:18] brother in Christ and then any money you
[1:52:20] lost the prophet of God will pay you
[1:52:21] back for it
[1:52:22] and how did you do that by making tents
[1:52:25] going to work every day
[1:52:27] Hallelujah the prophet of God out there
[1:52:30] working hard every day making a living
[1:52:32] he's going to pay off all the money
[1:52:33] think of all the help you lose you know
[1:52:35] with one servant gone you lose all the
[1:52:37] help out in the field you lose all the
[1:52:38] help in your home but the prophet God
[1:52:40] said well now that he's a Christian
[1:52:41] receive him back not as a servant but as
[1:52:44] a son
[1:52:45] and I will pay the money you lost put it
[1:52:49] on my account
[1:52:50] and he said I Rejoice I know that you'll
[1:52:52] do it in verse 11. Hallelujah
[1:52:56] Paul's advice to servants in Ephesians 6
[1:52:58] 5. I'm going to read this one
[1:53:05] Hallelujah
[1:53:08] 6'5
[1:53:12] servants be obedient to them that are
[1:53:14] your Masters according to the flesh with
[1:53:16] fear and trembling and singleness of
[1:53:17] your heart as unto Christ
[1:53:19] not with eye Services men Pleasers but
[1:53:21] as the Servants of Christ doing the will
[1:53:23] of God from the heart with Good Will
[1:53:25] doing Service as to the Lord and not to
[1:53:28] men
[1:53:30] so Paul tells the servants you find
[1:53:32] yourself in a slavery type condition but
[1:53:35] see your work like you're working for
[1:53:37] God and not for this man
[1:53:40] verse 8 knowing that whatsoever good
[1:53:42] thing any man doeth the same shall he
[1:53:44] receive of the Lord
[1:53:46] so all your good seeds you sow you're
[1:53:48] going to reap someday
[1:53:49] whether he be Bond or free
[1:53:53] see so Paul says whatever situation
[1:53:55] you're in do what's right plant good
[1:53:57] seeds because one day Church you're
[1:53:59] going to get a harvest
[1:54:01] if you do what's right God will do you
[1:54:03] right
[1:54:05] Hallelujah verse 9 any Masters do the
[1:54:08] same things unto them forbearing
[1:54:10] threatening says he don't threaten them
[1:54:12] don't be harsh with Don't Be Cruel or
[1:54:13] don't be rigorous with them see that's
[1:54:15] the same as the Old Testament
[1:54:17] knowing that your master also is in
[1:54:19] heaven neither is there respect of
[1:54:21] persons with him Hallelujah
[1:54:25] so each one of us no matter how much
[1:54:27] money or power or authority or influence
[1:54:30] that we have all of us have a master
[1:54:34] I'm sure you understand if you have a
[1:54:36] master that Master wants to give you
[1:54:38] instructions
[1:54:39] if you have a master then you are not
[1:54:41] doing what you want to do you're doing
[1:54:42] what your master told you to do
[1:54:44] so how important is it for each of us to
[1:54:46] understand what does our Master want us
[1:54:48] to do with our time money influence
[1:54:51] relationships what does our Master want
[1:54:53] us to do
[1:54:55] because all of us are Masters and God
[1:54:57] doesn't like one of us more than the
[1:54:59] other he has the same love to all of us
[1:55:03] God doesn't like brother Jesse well
[1:55:04] because he's pastor and he's got eight
[1:55:06] kids you know God God loves him more no
[1:55:08] no no no God loves all of us the same
[1:55:11] yeah I have different needs in you I may
[1:55:13] have but then you have some needs I
[1:55:15] don't have
[1:55:17] God does not favor us like well he's a
[1:55:19] he's a master he or this person has this
[1:55:21] they have more so I'm going to favor
[1:55:23] them more no God is looking at every one
[1:55:25] of us and he wants every one of us to do
[1:55:27] the very best we can with what he's
[1:55:28] given to us
[1:55:30] and he is the Lord of all
[1:55:34] he's the gracious judge over every
[1:55:35] single one of us and all of us should
[1:55:38] work Hallelujah whether you're at
[1:55:39] Gardner Pie Company praise God or
[1:55:41] whether you're at Copley Fair Lawn City
[1:55:43] Schools amen no matter where you are
[1:55:45] serve that boss like you're serving the
[1:55:47] lord Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah
[1:55:50] no matter where you find yourself
[1:55:52] serve that person like you're serving
[1:55:54] Christ how would I serve Christ
[1:55:56] if I was in college or High School how
[1:55:58] would I do it
[1:56:00] how would I study for Christ if Christ
[1:56:01] was my teacher in the in the high school
[1:56:03] or
[1:56:04] Elementary
[1:56:06] each one of us need to have this mindset
[1:56:08] I am not the master there's a master
[1:56:11] over me
[1:56:12] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:56:16] there's no respect to persons with God
[1:56:19] all right First Corinthians 7 17. I'm at
[1:56:21] an hour and a half you've been good
[1:56:23] good listeners here by God's grace I'm
[1:56:26] almost done
[1:56:27] First Corinthians I don't know how long
[1:56:28] it's going to be First Corinthians 7 17.
[1:56:32] But as God hath distributed to every man
[1:56:35] as the Lord hath called everyone so let
[1:56:37] him walk
[1:56:38] and so I ordain in all churches in other
[1:56:41] words God calls you at a certain point
[1:56:43] of your life with a certain purpose in
[1:56:46] your life
[1:56:47] so now we understand onesmus was called
[1:56:48] a certain purpose
[1:56:50] to teach Philemon a lesson
[1:56:53] praise God
[1:56:54] he was called after he was an escaped
[1:56:56] slave to teach Philemon real forgiveness
[1:57:00] right
[1:57:02] God calls each one of us at a different
[1:57:04] location to help teach others around us
[1:57:06] the ways of God
[1:57:10] so give me an example brother Jesse Yeah
[1:57:12] okay let's keep reading that in verse
[1:57:13] 18. is any man called being circumcised
[1:57:16] so Jewish let him not become
[1:57:18] uncircumcised if any be called in
[1:57:21] uncircumcision let him not be
[1:57:23] circumcised
[1:57:25] circumcision is nothing an
[1:57:27] uncircumcision is nothing but the
[1:57:28] keeping of The Commandments of God
[1:57:32] so God may call some of us in like a
[1:57:34] Jewish system some may come of us as
[1:57:35] Gentile Paul says you don't have to
[1:57:37] worry about going to one side or the
[1:57:38] other
[1:57:40] let every man abide in the same calling
[1:57:42] wherein he was called
[1:57:45] art thou called being a servant right
[1:57:49] now nessimist had escaped
[1:57:51] he wasn't called as a servant he was
[1:57:53] called after he became a
[1:57:57] an escaped slave I guess we call him he
[1:58:00] said care not for it wow don't care that
[1:58:02] you're a Slave
[1:58:03] in the Roman system
[1:58:05] Paul says if God calls you as a
[1:58:07] Christian as a slave don't don't worry
[1:58:09] about it
[1:58:11] but if thou mayest be made free use it
[1:58:15] rather if you get that opportunity now
[1:58:16] look Paul's not promising them
[1:58:18] Prosperity Gospel like they're going to
[1:58:19] be free
[1:58:20] he's saying if you get the opportunity
[1:58:22] make the most of it but don't forget
[1:58:24] make the most of it in whatever
[1:58:25] situation you're in oh you see God is
[1:58:28] your master and serve man like you'd
[1:58:30] serve God
[1:58:34] Hallelujah
[1:58:36] one day if you're like Joseph and you're
[1:58:38] faithful God will exalt you praise God
[1:58:39] one way or another praise God
[1:58:42] maybe not of course not to all those
[1:58:44] Heights we can't all be second in
[1:58:45] command we can't all be vice presidents
[1:58:47] in America right
[1:58:48] it's impossible but in other words God's
[1:58:50] going to exalt you to some position of
[1:58:52] more power more Authority
[1:58:54] more responsibility
[1:58:58] if we're faithful
[1:59:00] he said don't care for careful or not
[1:59:02] if the obvious made free use it rather
[1:59:04] verse 22 for he
[1:59:06] that is called in the Lord being a
[1:59:08] servant is the Lord's free man
[1:59:10] Hallelujah
[1:59:12] Paul says even if you're a slave and
[1:59:14] you're a Christian you're not a slave
[1:59:15] you're free praise God
[1:59:17] he's talking about spiritually in other
[1:59:19] words every in every condition we're in
[1:59:20] we can be spiritually free we don't have
[1:59:23] to be bounded it's all about our
[1:59:24] perspective it's all about our attitude
[1:59:26] we should look at it from an eternal
[1:59:28] perspective praise God I'm just on this
[1:59:30] Earth for a short time and I'm a free
[1:59:31] man I'm a free daughter of God and I'll
[1:59:34] serve God hallelujah no matter who's
[1:59:35] around me I'll serve God I'll give a
[1:59:37] testimony that God loves all of us and
[1:59:39] that whatever we do God will bless us
[1:59:41] for it and we must do all of our works
[1:59:43] for the glory of God almighty
[1:59:46] and if you serve God God will reward you
[1:59:48] if you serve God secretly God will
[1:59:50] reward you openly in public
[1:59:52] that's exactly right
[1:59:56] Hallelujah likewise finishing verse 22
[1:59:58] likewise also he that is called being
[2:00:00] free is Christ's servant
[2:00:04] you are bought with the price be not ye
[2:00:06] the Servants of men uh Paul tells us who
[2:00:10] who bought us
[2:00:11] it wasn't some man or a woman that
[2:00:13] bought us you know it doesn't apply to
[2:00:14] us today it would apply to them they
[2:00:16] might have a master that bought them but
[2:00:18] Paul says you were bought with a greater
[2:00:19] price than that you were bought with the
[2:00:21] precious blood of Jesus Christ
[2:00:24] so serve God
[2:00:26] that way
[2:00:27] and last verse verse 24 Brethren let
[2:00:30] every man wherein he is called therefore
[2:00:32] abide with god let's say to our feet
[2:00:34] praise God musicians can come
[2:00:36] I didn't get to finish all of it but
[2:00:37] that's most of it
[2:00:40] you guys saw on your heart brotherhoods
[2:00:42] okay praise God
[2:00:44] yeah I want to I mean some more verses
[2:00:46] about Freedom you know
[2:00:47] in the New Testament
[2:00:49] was that a help today by God's grace
[2:00:52] amen I thought you know a lot longer
[2:00:55] topic than I thought I thought well we
[2:00:56] don't have time really for that in a
[2:00:58] Sunday night service you know
[2:01:00] take a few weeks to cover that but a
[2:01:01] Sunday morning where I usually preach an
[2:01:03] hour and a half you know or I thought we
[2:01:04] could cover that by the grace of God how
[2:01:06] many love God today
[2:01:07] hasn't God been so good to you Church
[2:01:10] how many want to be the Lord's free free

[2:01:15] how many want to work for a man like
