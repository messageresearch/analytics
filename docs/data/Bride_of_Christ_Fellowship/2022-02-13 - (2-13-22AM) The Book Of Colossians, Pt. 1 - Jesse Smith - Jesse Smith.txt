amen god bless let's take your bibles here let's go to colossians chapter one colossians chapter one verse one like to read verses one through six i like to start this series uh this morning you know we kind of run a doctrine series as well we finished up the philippians series a while back and finished up the joshua series so i've been kind of studying the last few weeks on colossians i like to look at colossians chapter 1 today by god's grace colossians chapter 1 verses 1 through 6. quite a story behind this uh church here the colossian church and i'll try to just relate it the best i can as we we preach here i think the more i uh understand about the bible and the context that the bible was written the more i appreciate the fact that we have a bible and the more i appreciate the fact that i was one of the chosen ones to hear the revelation of god hallelujah it's such a privilege colossians 1 verses 1 through 6. i'll read verses 1 to 5 and then we'll just read six together if we can paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colossae grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and the of the love which ye have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel let's read verse six together ready one two three which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day he heard it and knew the grace of god in truth amen may god add his blessing to the ring of his word may be seated praise god i have some slides so if you want to switch over there keisha we appreciate um you helping us out there so lord when we'll have two services again today you know we started that back up last week so i'll try to be cautious of the time here and i just hope we get such a heavenly atmosphere that we forget about the time that's what i'm kind of hoping that we go that direction like god's grace so again it's just a privilege to have the psalmist here god bless you richly and ash you're sure getting tall buddy my goodness god bless you getting get big and emma and ali god bless you great to see you today look like little adults you know just emma is practically right you're practically an adult amen well god bless you that's right 18 god bless you and 19 years of marriage right just past 19 years congratulations god bless you hallelujah so wonderful praise god so brother austin if you don't know that's my sister right there so she saw my worst you know as a sinner and now she sees my better as a christian and she's been a tremendous example and she loved brother dustin he's been a tremendous father and uh provider there for his family so and he's such a servant to the church back home he's a deacon at the church and lead songs and uh just uh i'm thankful that god saves families you know that's what i'm so thankful for you know that my own natural brothers and sisters can be my spiritual brothers and sisters it's just amazing and god's gonna do the same we're trusting god to do the same for your families and that's why we serve the lord you know as paul told that philippian jailer as for me and my house officer of the lord i'm sorry that's joshua although the philippian jailer believe on the lord jesus christ and thy and thy house shall be saved so we're just trusting that'll apply to us as well so let's look here to this book of uh colossians uh colossae i hope i'm saying that city right uh colossae was a uh was a very wealthy prosperous city it was on a trade route of course you know uh in those days you know connecting the middle east cities together it wasn't it's quite as big as ephesus or uh philippi other cities like that but it was it was a wealthy city and uh it was just a beautiful story uh paul never even visited colossae he never had a chance to visit there as far as history says but it didn't matter if the prophet visited or not because as long as somebody was carrying the prophet's message then god was going to direct his word to the elect saints praise god and so we're thankful we see a lot of that today and of course this is a prison uh letter paul wrote many of his letters you know at least 14 letters he wrote many of them were from prison and churches i hope we can just understand that if paul could write these things and experience some of these things while in chains and could pray the way he prayed in chains may god help us to pray more fervently and to labor and live such a life of revelation and the love of jesus christ that everybody can see it on our faces praise god if he could write some of these revelations and and uh expound on the revelation of jesus christ while in chains what could we do not being in chains praise the lord in other words we could be a city on a hill that could not be hidden we could be the salt of the earth praise god and we know we are by the grace of god so we're thankful for this prophet um so let's look at the uh i want to look at the purpose of the series remember you know we've been looking at i think this is the fourth uh letter we've looked at we preached right through galatians ephesians philippians now we're on colossians preached all the scriptures right through here why do we do this of course because uh brother branham had a vision he went beyond the curtain of time and uh he said well if this group goes in so will mine because i preach exactly the same word where paul baptized in jesus name i did too and millions screamed out we're resting on that now it's estimated today there's about 200 000 message believers so you can see how uh you know around the world so you can see how many of those people were from brother branham's day they've lived their lives they've gone on now to their eternal reward praise god but millions screamed out we are resting on the fact that brother branham preached the same gospel as paul praise god he said my if i'd only known this before i would make people come here now of course we know you can't make people come to everybody he was so zealous he like i would i'd do anything to make them come right you can't go beyond freemore agency he said they can't afford to miss this why lookie here so we're resting on the same word that paul preached because brother and preached the same revelation as paul and remember paul's revelation from jesus christ is the one and only judgment standard many people believe different things you know well i'm gonna i won't have to be judged you know i won't have to be judged because i'm saved that's actually contrary to the scripture the bible said we must all stand before the judgment seat of christ now if you're saved you and fill with the holy ghost you will not be judged unto condemnation but you will be judged for all the works that you did in this body praise god amen paul says that all of us will stand before the judgment seat of christ praise god and paul's gospel galatians ephesians philippians colossians corinthians you know you go through it philemon romans you go through all these letters this is the standard we'll all be judged by praise god hallelujah because the bible said there's a day when god will judge all of us by paul's gospel amen it's the revelation that jesus christ gave to paul praise god amen i'm glad we're not judged by a creed hallelujah i'm glad we're not judged by a website hallelujah amen i'm glad we're not judged by somebody else right i'm glad we're not judged by another preacher or another or grandma or grandpa i'm glad we all have the same judgment standard amen praise god we all know what we're going to be judged by praise god if i knew if i knew i was going to be judged or graded i want to read that rubric praise god that's why we read the bible praise god that's why you read it every day hallelujah amen because this is what you'll be judged by praise god this is the standard that we strive to live for amen i'm sorry i never i never clicked on sorry i got double clicks here because i can hardly see this phone you know so i gotta switch over so that's what we're resting on church we're resting on this uh scripture and many people don't know that i do do really do the homosexuals know that they'll be judged by paul's gospel do the women preachers know that they'll be judged by paul's gospel where paul says i do not suffer a woman to teach men do they know many of them do right many of them do very few of them i would say are ignorant because god makes himself known to all men so that all men and women are without excuse have they thought about it recently have they prayed about it have they have they pondered it because that will be the judgment standard praise god hallelujah and it's uh the word of god that jesus gave to paul amen now here we are resting on paul's gospel if we are rather we need to know what he said because remember he taught the whole council of god uh to the ephesians not part of the council uh uh not not half of the council he taught the whole council and from history remember he was there for three years so in other words if you had three years of a revival you could learn the whole gospel in three years amen hallelujah how long was jesus ministry amen three and a half years amen hallelujah you can learn it in three years you can learn the whole gospel in three years praise god and i just want to remind you churches we've been looking at that other series on doctrine so so many message people speak evil of doctrine like downgrade it they just must not study the bible because the bible says brother the bible says but we've gone through that recently but brother branham says uh someone has to rise up they've got to come it's thus saith the lord malachi the fourth chapter it's exactly what he said would be the sign just before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord i'll send you elijah what will he do he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the fathers in other words the holy spirit will turn our hearts back to paul's gospel because that is doctrine doctrine means instruction praise god it means teaching and that's what paul said i'm a teacher to the gentiles amen hallelujah to bring them out of the power of darkness unto the power of god hallelujah out of these denominational difference and come back to the bible back to god that's what he said he would do notice the great time that we're living in uh you believe you're living in a great time this is a great time praise god remember brother man said if jesus would have asked me any time to live i'd i chose right at the end amen hallelujah that's where we're living right at the end amen hallelujah just a few more weary days and then hallelujah we're getting so close praise god amen it may be weeks maybe months maybe years maybe the next generation as well we don't know praise god but we're right at the end we're seeing the fulfillment of all these scriptures praise god amen hallelujah and we're seeing the maturity of the bride amen so paul said i did not shun to declare see there's something about a preacher now this is this is good it wasn't my notes preachers can either shun to tell you the truth or they can tell you the whole truth right and that's what denominational preachers are doing they're shunning to tell you the whole counsel of god they're not preaching the full word now we know some message churches are too right they're not preaching the full word of god they just go around and around god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet they just go around and around and around wandering in the wilderness but the prophet said you must possess the land you must be the joshua of your day amen and not just talk about the promises not but not just dream about them but experience them and that's what the baptism of the holy ghost does amen helps us experience the promises of god hallelujah for three years paul warned them and told them the whole counsel of god so you have counsel means purpose so you can learn god's purpose within three years praise god and so what a beautiful testimony that is church that uh my how long have we sat together brother brother of my since since 2020 or 2002 right so we've sat together almost 20 years maybe 2003 okay and praise god 19 years we sat together so he's heard the whole council so by but amen you've been with us a while now 2014 you've heard the whole council praise god amen because we've received the revelation of god now we've got to thank god that we've heard it but we also have to say lord help me to hear it again help me to grow in the understanding of the gospel because i'm still battling i still have sin in my members praise god and i still do things that i hate but i want to do that which is good praise god and i have two wars warring within me praise god now brother bran it's interesting brother you know with this thought about the whole council of god brother brahms accusers those who leave brother adam's message like believe the sign seek you the truth and if their spies are watching contact me if i hurt your feelings contact me don't contact somebody else contact me praise god show me your love show me that you really care about me he says uh they erroneously state uh that believers need only the four commands of acts 15. so uh remember when the church was transitioning from law to grace the apostles met and said what did we tell the gentiles and so they agreed let's talk things and so when we had the debate you know with them uh they were saying i was talking about you know women cutting hair and they shouldn't cut their hair the bible says that that and we shouldn't cross-dress and he basically said you know what about acts 15 there's only really four things we need to obey now isn't that isn't that such a sad statement church at the beginning there was four things before they could preach the whole council of god amen hallelujah notice the four things really dealt with two things food and fornication right so they're only given four things at the beginning praise god and i even said on the debate yes they needed four things right at the beginning but then paul came and gave them the whole counsel the whole purpose of jesus christ hallelujah so they asked me what are the only old testament laws and i gave the answer there's those four commands but it was only for a short time in transition because paul later says in galatians that jesus called him can you imagine jesus calling you out to a wilderness out to a desert jesus said don't stay there in the city paul come meet me out here in arabia hallelujah i want to spend time with you i want to fellowship with you out in the wilderness it may seem contrary why would you leave the church paul why are you leaving church because i want to give you a special revelation and this revelation will go to all the world and it will keep going all the world for 2 000 years so he couldn't trust it to him amongst other men with other ideas he had to have paul all alone to receive the revelation and now we've received that revelation praise god amen the full counsel of god now uh do they really believe do brother hammer's accusers really believe we only follow those four laws what about paul's other commands what about women preachers water baptism in the name of the lord jesus what about the mystery of god in christ how about bishops and deacon qualifications how about no required circumcision do they really believe that the five-fold ministry brings perfection to the church how about marriage commands they didn't mention that there's there's only food and fornication see how about then if you don't work you don't eat command how about gathering more with saints as you see that day approaching praise god hair lengths i mean we could go on and on those are the thoughts that came off the top of my head tonight all these commands see what is sad see what the when they leave the word they're leaving the whole council of god amen there it is right there they're forsaking their see that they're taking away from the counsel of god the bible said don't add and the boston bible said don't take away amen what they've done they've now taken away from the grace of god from the mind of god from the mind of christ and church they and you and i will be judged by that amen we'll be judged by the whole thing praise god preachers have started preaching as novices they'll be judged right they'll lose their reward they could they can still be saved of course right women that cut their hair brought shame to their husbands in christ and the father they'll be judged for that they might lose their reward no doubt they will lose their reward praise god women that dress immodestly if they are saved they'll lose they'll lose all their reward if they are saved because paul said dress modestly amen sometimes we forget church the power and the anointing that we have on us just to dress modestly amen i didn't hear you sometimes we forget that praise god amen that it takes the anointing to constantly live this life and all these commands praise god it takes the anointing in other words each day you must choose to put on christ because we've seen them now walk away they've been in our church they've left the message after 40 years in the church see they can choose to walk away that's because they've never been sealed in praise god but once you get sealed in you're sealed to the day of your redemption amen hallelujah how could we not rejoice in this now i'm going to skip past this i got it in my book but there's there's 14 or 15 doctrines that when they leave the message they defy these doctrines and they'll be judged by it and what do they do they get under the spirit of jezebel with women preachers right they go under the spirit of lufts i've listened to some of those guys they love watching movies now with murders and uh fornications on them that's the spirit of lessons now see they leave and say they're free no they're not free from sin they're free from the anointing of god see they're under the spirit of pride they call themselves professors and walking bibles is what they let people call them they deny paul's gospel they're prideful they mock brother branham and other preachers they're deceivers saying there's only one work of grace and you've got the holy ghost as soon as you said a sinner's prayer you're filled with the holy ghost impossible praise god god doesn't work it like that praise god you got to really die out to self they're underlying spirits calling brother ram making all these assumptions about brother branham they they they instead of calling the catholic church to mother harlot they call her sister i'll tell you that's not my sister praise god my sister's here my sister's the holy ghost field church amen i didn't hear you praise god wherever she is amen whether napoleon or albion or iowa no matter where that holy ghost field church is that's my sister amen we can imagine they call the pope their sister and and they call our pope like rick warren our pope he ain't my pope praise god he ain't my father and they're under a lust spear with no modesty standards or little modesty standards and how about the unclean spirit of crossdressing these are all spirits of bondage whenever you leave the truth you become a slave to the evil spirit that drew you away from the truth hallelujah because it's not the holy spirit that takes away from the bible the holy spirit points to the bible praise god amen i know i'm going a long way to get the colossians but i know you can bear with me this is what come to me as i was praying and studying so i hope you enjoy it by god's grace i know you do okay i'm gonna go past that now let's look at the the background here now here's all apostles paul's epistles uh preach those three all the way through every verse so now we're on colossians so he had letters to churches to the hebrews and to brothers and then he had genera and these are general pistols these aren't paul's okay so just i'll just focus on these right here so paul had all those gospels and lord willing if the lord carries i want to preach all of paul's gospels lord willing by god's grace brother man preaching hebrews series so that i have a lot of the study on that one some of these though i gotta lean more upon you know history and and commentators because we don't have as many quotes on them right so uh you see we're we're trying to make our way through now i just want a background i preached on galatians in 2016 ephesians i took a break there between 2016 i took a few years break and finish in april 2020 and then philippians we started it uh last year and finished it last year different number of parts i just want to rehearse a few important revelations church as a reminder this is what we've learned by the holy spirit and this is what we'll be judged by amen you're cursed to change paul's gospel which many churches are guilty of uh there's such a thing as spies that satan sends into churches in this case it was circumcision spies right just like satan sends spies in our church and we've got to preach them out praise god or pray him out that's what we did one time we pray out those evil spirits paul one preacher one prophet can con correct another we learn that no prophet is above correction now thus saith the lord is above correction but in their daily lives they're still men they're still going to sin they're going to still have a human side so their human side will still need corrected legalism frustrates grace churches can be bewitched back into legalism like the jezebel spirit right bewitched uh he taught us adoption what it means to be adopted to be baptized with the holy ghost and you grow into your adoption if you're born again you're already adopted and you're enjoying the blessings of being adopted now but the work is finished once you step into that theophany amen and you're fully adopted praise god paul said never lose your enthusiasm in 4 18. and it also saw how paul doubted some conversions in the galatian church that means that that means even paul as a prophet didn't know who was born again all the time can you imagine that he said you started off with with with faith and receiving the word and miracles why have you turned back the legalism see that's what we found too as we hang around the message long enough the word of god we find people i thought they were born again i found out later they weren't born again so it's okay to doubt people's conversion it's okay pray for them guide them point them to the word of god if they're god's elect they'll thank you for pointing them to the word of god amen hallelujah because the bible says you rebuke a wise man he'll love you praise god rebuke a foolish virgin they'll get upset and leave amen that's right that's i'm just paraphrasing that's the opposite it has to be the opposite praise god that's okay let him go god's good ephesians now let's look at some of these important ephesians we have church you and i have every spiritual blessing do not leave here if you need a spiritual blessing don't leave until you got it praise god or at least are sure you're going to get it i'm not promising every blessing here in the church remember today but i'm saying if you you should believe that everything you have need of is already been given to you praise god everything for your earthly journey is already inside you amen hallelujah now this was a growth area for me because i learned that every realm of us have a desire your flesh has desires your mind has desire so i desire to build that or dig that or i desire to write that but then your soul has desires and all three desires must be filtered by the word of god amen jesus blood broke down the middle wall partition so there's no more discrimination in the body of christ no matter the skin color no matter the age no matter anything no matter gender no matter what it is praise god the wall has been broken down and christ's body is a church praise god it's a multinational hallelujah generational worldwide body of believers and one thing they're known by that's their love hallelujah i also learned that we have intimacy of the mystery knowing the mystery of christ brings intimacy with god people say oh we don't need the mysteries shame on them they don't even know what they're talking about paul said the mystery brings intimacy with god so the more revelation you have of the mystery of god the more intimate your walk with god is that's why their walks aren't so intimate because they they deny the mystery of god and then we see the benefits of the fifo ministry i preach a lot on that but the new man versus the old man walk as wise not as fools and paul requested opportunities to declare the mystery of god now remember when we preached philippians part 1 the very sermon we preached that that was when we brought the prayer club right here that's that was part one of the book of philippians i'm sometimes i'm going to make a memorial wall here and we're just going to hang up all of our memorials there praise god just like joshua amen he had to put up his memorials don't forget church this young generation can't forget that god is a miracle-working god amen but i always remember part one of philippians because that's when you come up for prayer for your daddy and god god god raised brother bang's faith all of our faith praise god to get that mighty miracle praise god in the midst of it amen i try to limit these to one slide by the way i also we also learned in philippians that we must pray to increase our discernment or judgment we can get more wise in other words we can get better at detecting sin we can get better at detecting righteousness as well praise god we also learned paul defended the gospel that's what i believe i've been called to do defend the gospel we also found christ's mind only was equal to god we don't have the full mind of christ all the time and the church said just look at the last week and see how you tried to make a decision and it didn't work out you don't always have the mind of christ right you have the holy ghost in your soul if you'll yield to that praise god but oh but jesus had the mind of god he alone was equal to god amen we have a portion of god but jesus is the image of god amen hallelujah epiphanies healing was god's mercy upon paul so when god heals our loved ones that's god's mercy to us we also learn enemies of the cross are dogs and their gods are their own beliefs they worship themselves right self-worshiping people he told us to rejoice always to be not anxious for anything and he said he learned contentment through christ shortly before his death if a man if a prophet can learn contentment as he's in his 50s or 60s then we should be able to learn things as we're in our growing years as well in other words the older we get we should still keep learning things about god let's not build denominations in fact that's the most dangerous thing is to build the denomination right to rally around our own thoughts or our own ideas everything we believe must be taken back to the word of god hallelujah now let's overview real briefly on the book of colossians here we'll look at a few verses here today by god's grace now overview here we see the outline is paul gives the greeting and thanksgiving from chapter 1 verse 1 to verse 12 and then he breaks this beautiful portion into the supremacy of christ and the two mysteries related to christ praise god one of them is the godhead the other is the baptism of the holy ghost amen oh in this book to this little city i'll say like that to this little city of course it was a prosperous city but it was a little city and then in chapter 2 verse 4 to 23 paul denounces their false the false teachings that had entered into the church so see anyone who says we don't need teaching it would be the equivalent of taking the book of colossians and ripping out that whole book out of the bible oh we don't need teaching so let's rip it out in fact but paul's letter to teach them about the false teaching is what actually cleaned them out and brought them back into a personal intimacy with christ amen praise god that was in fact as we'll see here the whole purpose of the letter was to do that was to rebuke all the false teachers that had come up in the church amen hallelujah i tell you god's really protected our church praise god at one time i sat in here we had right here we had a minister's meeting with five other ministers that all come into our church right and i think by this time only one is preaching at this time and i think he's a little off that gentleman interesting interesting see many are called but few are chosen hallelujah amen many think they might have a call of many but the bible said make your calling an election sure hallelujah praise god amen that's what we must do we must seek the lord until we know his perfect will hallelujah so he denounced it and then he ends the letter by speaking of the christian life which is a beautiful portion we can't wait to preach that and uh and then gives the conclusion all right now church here's a picture of modern day colossae and i'm not talking about the houses down there i'm talking about that hill of dirt think about this for a moment paul was led in the holy spirit to write this letter he sent it there but today it's covered in dirt this city think about this that city that it had some of the whole glory it had some of the saints walking around filled with the holy ghost right in that city it was kind of this is a place where you know when you come in the presence of god you'll be standing on holy ground amen there are some saints there praise god this was a holy city but today 2000 years later it's under dirt and it goes as a reminder for us church we must redeem the time amen the ways of this world will come and pass and the leaders will rise up and fall and source always change there's always going to be so much things going on the thing to do is know that heaven earth shall pass away but god's word will never pass away though the city's fallen the word of god sent to that city remains amen hallelujah same thing for ephesus there's only a few places left in ephesus that are actually excavated and you can see them because it was there for a while it only endured for a little season praise god but the bible says he that does the will of god liveth and abideth forever hallelujah amen hallelujah praise god colossae is a hundred miles east of ephesus 12 miles from laodicea modern-day turkey and it's a dirt pile today it's in ruins unexcavated i was listening to one doctorate you know historian he said they they've only just gone walked over the mound and they found pottery and it dates it back to about the time when it was you know uh when it was there in the days of uh the apostle paul and everything like that so right around 60 a.d they've never excavated it it's all buried in church let's say like this if the lord does tarry one day this church may not be here anymore praise god like you see down the street they had that church down there and some i don't want to be careful some unbeliever converted it into a shopping mall a church and it looks awful it looks like it's just it's a disgrace but it just goes to show revivals will only last as long as we want them to last ah but we as long as you want to have revival the bible says as long as you obey the word of god and overcome i will not take out the candlestick from among you but as long as you obey the word of god god's candlestick will remain in akron praise god amen amen napoleon is everywhere else where there's a real revival of god praise god amen remember you can have revival every day in your soul praise god you can have every day a revival in your mind where your mind is transformed to do the will of god praise god so we see it's not this is not colossal glossy this is glossy a mound of dirt a mods i think it's amazing here's a picture so you get an idea there's ephesus there's laodicea there's colossae classic so there was a trade route of course that connected all these you know went back over here and then of course down south here would be israel you know the syria over here turkey syria and then israel down here so here's where we get the uh this thought here now the word kolasi is a is a derivative somehow of the the term purple wool reminds you of lydia right sell her purple where's lydia there she is seller of purple one of these days she's going to put out some something purple she probably already has actually when she's a little one but that's how cities were known cities were named after what made them prosperous so colossae uh was as a form of purple woe and it was important stop on this major trade route now church what's amazing this city was destroyed by an earthquake in between 60 and 62 a.d so that is a pile of earthquake dirt right there and it was less than a decade after hearing the letter from the apostle paul paul died between 64 and 68 a.d under nero so let's let's understand let me say like this is there anything that is uh insignificant in god's eyes is there any believer here is there any child that god is not paying attention to no how can we prove that because this city was in its all of its glory all the purple wool they were selling they're making big money building buildings but god knew it was going to fall in less than 10 years but god in his rich grace he said every soul in there is significant i'm still going to send them thus saith the lord i'm still going to send them the word of god because i care and i love them even though destruction is coming amen i'm still going to send the word to all my believers because i love them and the word will set them free hallelujah i don't know how many colossians died in that earthquake i don't know if the holy spirit led them out like he did jerusalem in 80 70. we don't know history doesn't say but what we do know is that god cared so much he had his prophet write a letter in rome in prison glory and send it with uh with a couple of atticus and different men and said send this letter there god knew it was going to be destroyed but god knew despite destruction coming god knew the saints would want the word of god to deliver them to seal them he'd want them to know the godhead amen he want them to know about the baptism of the holy ghost that's how much god cares and no matter how many days we have or decades we have or or generations we have i want you to know god cares and god is sending you his word today amen let me say it like this ain't just one word it's the whole council of god amen hallelujah but as far as we know they got one or two letters history says they got the letter to the colossians and they got philemon's letter that's all they got and look what we got now what are we spending our time with praise god we should be spending our time in paul's gospel don't you think the last letters before destruction before an earthquake crumbles the whole city but what was god what was was god merciful or not of course he was he sent his word there before destruction came amen remember the opposite was true uh in laodicea uh well i should say the opposite let me say this let me reword that laodicea also had many earthquakes but each time they re rebuilt the city of laodicea i don't know if you knew that by history but laodicea also had numerous earthquakes in this area and each time the city fell they'd rebuild it but not colossae something about colossae maybe it was too small i know maybe it was insignificant you can tell they built one behind it but for some reason they never rebuilt this so this was the only chance of this city to receive the word of god and so god made sure glory god made sure he sent his word to all those that loved the word all those that would receive it in other words paul knew all that the father has given me will come to me praise god amen we can rest assured that god knows the events of history god orchestrates the events of history praise god and he directs his word to all those who love the living word of god oh glory so see church in my spiritual mind brother amen sometimes i look and look well there's a pile of actor and dust right there that could be akron right akron is falling apart you should be the rubber industry you know capital of the world now it's falling apart you drive down there by dustin you're gonna see a lot of abandoned rubber buildings and companies it's falling apart now of course they're trying to rebuild certain areas like the university and everything like that but it shows how man uh gloria the bible said man has no continuing city here praise god we're not trusting in akron we're not trusting in the local government praise god we're not trusting in the federal government we're not trusting in the state government praise god we're trusting in the unfailing unchanging eternal immortal word of god hallelujah that's what's going to sustain our lives that's what we're trusting in amen and as long as we have that we've got everything all right if you don't get your uh yeah if you don't get your tax return on time or something like that don't don't be discouraged as long as you've got god's word you've got everything get a return this year don't don't fret as long as you've got god's word that's the most important thing hallelujah thank the lord now we're going to get to this in a little bit but i just want to look at the blue here you know it's 12 miles from laodicea it's it's apparent that epiphyse now other people pronounce that different epiphyses was actually the founder of the church the prophet himself never visited colossae as far as i know the prophet never preached in akron either right or napoleon you just try to try to understand church to me this makes the bible more real this makes me feel like brother ashley like i was one of the colossians i never got to meet the prophet but i heard his message amen i don't know yet i received this message and it has transformed my life amen because that's what does the transformation a man doesn't transform you yes he's a burning shining light but then he fizzles out for a season and the church said like john the baptist that man's a burning shining light he goes off the scene but jesus is the eternal light amen and you can't shut him off praise god his light can't go down he's the light of the world amen he's the light of men the bible says hallelujah nothing can hinder the lord jesus christ so epiphys it's likely they say history wise that eperfus was from uh colossae and he heard paul preaching at some other location and then he heard the message glory and he took it to his hometown hallelujah praise god that's exactly right that's what betsy and dustin and cam all did there they heard the message they took it to their hometown amen we still got a few fish over there by god's grace amen some have come some have fallen away but that's what you do you take it to your own town praise god you take it to your people and all that the father has given me will come to me praise god but i say like this everybody deserves a chance to hear the word of god that's right now let's look at a little more background here they never saw paul's face i'm going to read colossians 2 verse 1. they never saw paul's face just to kind of give you an understanding remember church has returned i told you that testimony there's that brother jack uh from albie and he's still alive he's 94 i think he's on his third wife because he's outlived his two wives they've died and he just married another one yes and uh cam and i preached over there years ago together with brother jim and and he he saw brother brandon's meetings he saw brother discern when he was a young man that's how i come to know the message he come up to cam and i after one of the services and he said i want to tell you he said you're more blessed than i am i said no brother i said no you're more blessed look at you god has blessed your life you know and you got to see the prophet he said no but i've got scripture for it brother jesse he said it's the same uh same scripture jesus told doubting thomas you know he said and he said see i saw the prophet he said and i believe he said but you never saw the prophet yet you believe and he said jesus said it's more blessed uh to just receive it if you have not seen it praise god now i'm cutting up that scripture so forgive me i haven't recorded that one lately but you know what i mean you're more blessed if you haven't seen everything and yet you still believe the revealed word of god oh we sing that song about being blessed amen church i hope we know we're blessed amen it doesn't matter what men we've seen naturally with our natural eyes it matters if we've seen the holy spirit working in our midst and obeying his voice and obeying his word that's what matters that's what counts colossians 2 verse 1 for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh paul had never met them but he still i still have a conflict for you i still have a burden for you i'm still praying and wrestling in prayer to help you overcome how many grateful for that praise god first that's why we can know saints uh and and hear about them and not even not even ever see them but we can still pray for them like we saw with jose's friend right we never we're never gonna meet half these people that we pray for from jose we send all these prayer prayer cloths and everything we're never gonna meet them until we get to the other side praise god now there's a scripture in here this book i don't have the exact one but colossians says where i'm with you in the spirit so there's something about when a saint is alive on the earth now this is i'm going to lay this out here a little bit hopefully you can hopefully everybody catches this it's very simple but while saints alive paul said i can be with you in the holy spirit even though i'm not there i mean i believe that but something must change when a saint dies right or or if that's not true then we would say brother branham's spirit is here now we know there's a move that believes that and that's spiritualism right isn't that something so while you're alive glory amen while you're alive my spirit can be a napoleon and i i'll be right here praise god you understand their their spirit can be here and yet they can be in napoleon there's something about the unity of the saints amen like when we pray we can just pray i know uh i know god's gonna bless the church services today napoleon and god's gonna bless the the services there in albion and up there and sheffield i know god's gonna bless him there's something about while we're alive our spirit can be present there through the holy spirit that's a great mystery i'm not trying to explain it today i'm just letting you know what's in the bible right but as soon as that person dies god told moses i'm sorry god told joshua moses my servant is dead praise god and then that that ends that right because now they're not joshua wasn't saying where's moses i feel moses presence here that's not what happened but it said jesus christ amen the captain of the host came and revealed himself to joshua amen and he said that i'm the captain of the lord's host praise god see the eyes were off the man the prophet went off the scene so now the eyes are fully on christ jesus something about that just struck me today as i was driving to church something about that we can be present there with somebody else even though we're here but yet when we pass that's over praise god we ain't starting any superstitions this morning well maybe brother branham is here maybe maybe he can preach for us nonsense nonsense maybe brother brown can do the wedding maybe brother that that's what they do right maybe brother brown can dedicate the preachers and the babies no not anymore not anymore see it's a lack of understanding and it's uh like the bible said a deceiving spirit i don't know the bible says that deceiving spirits is so close but yet it's so far away it'll be so close it deceived the very elected if it were possible so i hope that's a help by god's grace like that brother remember that brother austin who's helped us out from england remember i read that email on wednesday yeah who who really helped you out he said i'm there with you in the spirit and i first i didn't i didn't believe it but now i believe it because the bible says it he can be there in england but yet somehow through the holy spirit he's here today i'm just telling you the bible of course we won't worry about that we won't think about that but i'm just letting you know there's something about the unity of the holy spirit that people even can watch our sermons right they can watch our sermons on youtube or our videos on youtube and they can feel the presence of god right because god comes and anoints his word amen there's just something about it how god's spirit is just it's beyond boundaries amen hallelujah and he's able to touch lives through the same love and the same power the same word praise god it doesn't matter if we see their face or not our prayers are effective amen hallelujah our fervent prayers are very effective and effectual and they will prevail aren't you glad your prayers are heard and they will prevail hallelujah amen don't have to be there as long as god's there somehow with yours the holy spirit there and your spirit somehow you can be there but physically you don't have to be there that's really something now let's move on here i just thought i'd drop that in there so i'm expecting more revelation on that just so you guys know so after a few decades or whatever you know we'll see see if god dropped down some more revelation like he does he does that many times so while at ephesus paul sent epiphus as an apostle to the lycius valley or lycus valley in turkey and he established the church in colossae so it wasn't paul that started this church it wasn't the prophet that started this church it was another member in the five full ministry was it any less of a church did it have any less of the word well we'd say no because it had the revelation that they gave in there so see never looked down on ourselves never feel bad because we didn't know brother branham i don't feel bad so i've got the same holy spirit praise god they're like who are they they ask me who are you to uh uh understand brother man's opinions and his bible teachings i said i'm nobody but i said the same holy spirit that was in him is in me praise god amen it has to be that way praise god it has to be that way or else we're all if that's not the case then we have no discernment we have no understanding we have no gifts of ourselves but my bible says the gifts and callings of god are without repentance and my bible says the gifts of god are given to every man to profit with all amen and i had a man this week i don't know if i'd heard you told you this brother bang i demand this week he's almost done reading my book my long one not the short one the long one because i know it's hard to do that i know we're reading through it now it's like well it's a long book here at our house but he's almost done with my book he was so moved he went and got baptized by brother craig last sunday yep and he said uh he said he put a testimony there and said every church every christian should read this book now we know it's not going to happen but every predestinated christian will amen if they want to know the mystery of god and if that will be a help to them a long life's journey every christian that's predestinated we'll hear the word of god just like this a a a small church in colossae still receives the word of god can you imagine tickias he had this satchel around him and he had two letters in there that were just paper but that paper represented the mind of christ amen and and throughout maybe maybe he had rain on the journey maybe he had storms on the journey but god was protecting his word church let me tell you god is protecting his word god is protecting you god's will will be accomplished nothing can stop god hallelujah nothing can stop god god's word is going to find all those who want to hear it amen hallelujah his love is irresistible praise god his glory is magnificent praise god his ways are past finding out his ways are higher than our ways amen hallelujah nothing can stop our god how many can say amen to that hallelujah there's nothing to fear jesus is here this was a church of diverse ethnic backgrounds just wasn't all uh wasn't all those from turkey they had phrygians which was central turkey greeks which was from greece and jews this was a multi-ethnic church kind of like ours praise god amen i love it small church but had all kinds of different ethnic backgrounds and so epiphanes went there started the church but he come back and saw paul and let him know about all the heresies that were coming among them they started out on fire but then heresies come in how many know church we can't get lazy how many know you can't let yourself cool down don't cool down don't relax don't relax on your bible reading don't relax on your prayer stay close to the holy one praise god if you leave from his protection the tempter is going to get you don't leave beyond the protection of that word stay behind the word stay intimate with jesus amen stay intimate but see this proves in every church there's going to be strong ones and there's going to be weak ones may we all make it our hearts desire to be determined to be always strong always about the father's business amen hallelujah but some people in this colossian church are starting to receive doctrines about angels you can worship angels we're going to get to it kind of what they do today they worship brother brown the seventh angel right see and there's always a connection somehow always also in colossians you read about how some people are exalting holidays above what they should be and somewhere looking down well you celebrate this holiday you don't and paul said these are just all shadows of christ and then he said in romans if that's a holy day to you let it be a holy day to you but don't discourage that person right don't let your good be evil spoke enough see all these problems that creep into churches so what do we got to do god's testing us are we going to get critical and fight are we going to be loving and let the holy spirit get the victory i mean fight carnally we we fight spiritually by praying okay i'm trying trying to be right down the middle i hope you understand it by god's grace so see all these things that has started creeping in the church and the church is only going to last for another decade but god was so concerned even within the last 10 years of the church i'm going to send the word i'm going to send the revelation and it's going to help all the predestinated amen church i hope by now that you know you're part of the predestination hallelujah you are predestinated god chose the time and the place for you to receive the word of god it was a uh it was a special uh predestinated event god foreknew it god had it waiting there just for you praise god just like that woman at the web praise god jesus going about a regular business but here comes jesus i have a need to go there praise god you had a need to hear the word of god you had a need to go to akron praise god university of akron you had a need to meet all these different people because there was god there behind it revealing himself to you and you had to make sure that you make it no matter what the future holds you had to make sure you heard the word of god that you can manifest yourself as a child of god amen so now let's pick up your bibles let's go to colossians chapter one let me preach a few minutes in here i got about eight minutes left on my hour here so usually i go a little bit past that and i have lost track of the time so that's good that's good hallelujah remember church millions screamed out were resting on the fact that brother branham preached the book of colossians now if you know does anybody know his most famous sermon preached out of colossians anybody know it christ is the mystery of god reveal his text is colossians chapter one it's a godhead sermon right it's like a three hour sermon i preached on it years ago just slowly through it christ is the mystery of god revealed is the main text brother ram draws out of here and apparently if you understand this now church apparently there's some churches this was a church that needed help on the godhead right what did the corinthians need help on gifts right marriage and divorce uh brothers that were sleeping around the church right see every church had a different need but god had all these churches that had all these different needs and then he had one man paul to write the letters and direct and give them the whole council of god god aren't you glad yours and even the ephesian church they weren't perfect they were more mature but they weren't perfect they needed help with the five full ministry they needed help with marriage and marriage and husbands wives and children how to how to obey the parents right the armor of god right because remember the thessalonicans they got the armor of god too in thessalonians chapter 5. so there's going to be different needs in our church now as time goes on church i hope you can see which kind of church we are i haven't thought about until recently but this was a church that needed the godhead ephesian church needed the more family life corinthians needed gifts they were real fanatical real emotional everything was an emotion everything everything was a revelation everything was this or that or the other right clean living galatians were into legalism they were a legalistic church doesn't that help you out you see my there's different churches and each one has different needs but we have the benefit of not just getting one letter we have the benefit of all the letters and we have the benefit to hear the mystery of god finished in this day we have the benefit of getting our hearts turned back to paul's heart amen hallelujah we have this benefit okay so give me a few more minutes here by god's grace colossians chapter 1 uh verse 1. paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother now i brought just in my notes i just brought out this thought by the will of god each one of you are doing something by the will of god like i thought about emma working there at her job she's there by the will of god she has a work to do on her job praise god lydia does too they're out there written orchards she has by the will of god she's called to that place so are you brother bang you're called to that job by the will of god right each one of us god has made his will known to us and then we obey the will of god how do we know god's will like the bible said it was a personal revelation of jesus christ so somehow god let us know like austin i talk about this all the time different signs right we're looking for signs is this the right thing is this right is this going to be blessed right that's that's that's that's christianity we're trying to understand the bible said work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen the bible said take it serious be very careful what you decide to do in the will of god for your life but paul knew i'm a preacher by the will of god and so how do we know the bible said prove all things in other words each decision in life must be taken to the spot where you can prove it was this god's will or was it not god's will did i obey the will of god for this area or did i disobey for this area now church that should be important to all of us because which one of us want to walk in the permissive will of god and get spanked right that's what the word uh the bible says in uh hebrews 12 he chastens every son chastened means beat or hit so that is a scriptural term right spanking when we purposely disobey and leave the perfect will of god like jonah or like brother branham right or ever we can all put our names there we're going to get corrected but the idea is to do things by the will of god and prove the bible said you can prove it when you have a transformed mind you can prove that this is god's will amen so especially as our young ones get older ones now and teenagers and they're gonna get to these marriage years it's the second greatest decision in your life thank god you made the greatest decision nelson great great thank god for that but now you got the second greatest coming up here you too emma and lydia maokai i'm out guys shaking said like no oh no no you are buddy don't don't doubt that buddy one of these days is going to turn like craig craig's like i'm never going to get married he didn't have the desire and all of a sudden he's got the i got to get married you better know what i'm talking about but these are major decisions these are not minor major so some of us thank god we've already made the right decision by the will of god and we can see god has guided us it's simple but it must be approached very reverently through much prayer waiting upon the lord counsel from parents right counsel from preachers if needed it's by the will of god let me tell you i didn't come to akron by my own will i don't want to come here it was the only scholarship i had and i don't even know there was a city called akron but god had a vang laying over here god had a predestinated seed hua right and brother austin and brother amen and god had all these predestinated seeds over here praise god it wasn't by my will it was by god's will how did your family even get over here god sent the american army to bring uh your people the hmong people from laos to avoid a genocide and brought them to akron praise god amen hallelujah praise god knows how to direct this word amen it's by the will of god hallelujah just let me refresh that to your thinking that we must each day in each great decision we must approach the throne of grace and know it is the will of god to do this i'm gonna get back to remember when i i didn't know if i should pastor this church or not it was when tim myers had left and uh like i told you how would it be different here if tim myers were still here y'all wouldn't be either here or you wouldn't believe the message anymore right i say that with love and respect i've texted him and we talked about it but look how god has an order look how god directs our paths praise god i didn't know if i should pastor it's the only time i ever opened my bible said lord speak to me i remember i was sitting with lydia in the bathroom up there i think she might have been in the tub over there in calgary fall i said lord if help speak to me i opened it up and it went to first timothy 4 12. let no man despise thy youth but you be the example of the believers in word and conversation and charity and spirit and faith and purity neglect not the gift that is within thee take heed unto thyself and to the doctrine because it will save yourself and them that hear thee and that's how i proved i knew it was god's will for me to pastor and have i manifested that or not i hope you can say amen i know i can say amen i've seen god do it in my own life i've given myself to the word of god to preaching the word of god and i've tried to make myself an example praise god because i know just because i'm young just because we're young doesn't mean we can we should be looked down upon because we're young we should be more strengthened we should have more energy more zeal for god amen those days are going to come when you don't enjoy them so much all the pains of life start catching up to you be the example the bible says but prove it by the will of god amen so church let us walk in the perfect will of god especially speaking since i had this opportunity i'm going to speak to the young ones there walk in the perfect will of god prove all things with a transformed mind and the only way it's gonna be transformed is be cleaned out by the word you've got to stay in the word you've got to meditate in the word and then you can prove this is the perfect will of god hallelujah like i did that the last the last time i did that was with brother amen it was 2014 our church was shrinking really small there's my hour i'm like lord i wrote it to myself in email and i prayed i said lord if i don't win a soul by the end of this year 2014 and my ministry doesn't bring them into the message i'm going into evangelism that was like in the summer of 2014. well here you know around september 2014 in walks brother amen and about 20 other people from the hmong church hey we just want to visit you tonight and i'm back there in the office and my only sermon left i preached everything i've ever studied except one sermon why we're not denomination i said lord i have no idea why i'd ever preach this message but it's all i got and i'm tired and i'm exhausted this is the second service i'll just go preach it anyway and six people come up to the altar i baptized all six of them and there's only one that stayed brother amen and god gave me the amen to my ministry the soviet because i said i was gonna quit brother i'm to quit pastor i'm just going back into evangelism like i started off with brother brooks god gave me the amen prove the perfect will of god it is god's perfect will that you're here church amen it's god's perfect will this is you're doing exactly what god called you to do amen god has orchestrated all the events of your life leading up to this and we should go forward in the power and the authority and the anointing of the holy spirit today amen and if i know there's a scripture i'm off the word i don't know it if there is a scripture i'm off i don't know it amen hallelujah because that we prove the will of god we prove the perfect will of god by the word of god and as i said last wednesday as you know the tares and the wheat are going to have miracles they're all going to have the anointing what separates them one does the perfect will of god amen the other one doesn't the other one has false doctrine but the real bride of christ has two true doctrines and true miracles she's got all of it because she is the bride she's fully washed she's a to z the word of god hallelujah glory verse two you guys like seeing my thoughts up there is okay you guys liked it okay i've been doing it for like five years hopefully hopefully she probably should ask a little earlier there's an option i could hide it but i'm just like well i'll just put it up there you know sorry i'm trying to find colossians i just could pass it colossians 1 verse 2. to the saints and the faithful brethren in christ which are at colossae grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ so what are we church we are sacred we are morally blameless we are religious we're saints the word religion is not a bad word churches have made it a bad word because they like to disobey god's word don't let anybody ever tell you religion's a bad thing religion is a good thing james 1 verse 27 said pure and undefiled religion before the father is the visit visit the poor visit the widows visit the fatherless and to keep yourself unspotted from the world i am religious amen that's why brother emma said i feel religious amen religious means religion means observance i feel like i'm observing the word of god today amen i feel like i'm doing the word of god i feel like i'm obeying the word of god that's what jesus said teach them go to all nations and teach them to observe all my commands hallelujah teach them to be religious over all the commands all these people just don't know their bibles thank god we know the bible and may we keep knowing it and may we obey it praise god hallelujah so trapped in creeds and man-made ideas thank god for the word of god he said to the saints and the faithful the trustworthy trust i'm looking at the trustworthy ones i can trust you buddy i can trust all the sisters back here they if they tell me something they're going to do it hallelujah the saints the sacred ones that have a sacred purpose a holy purpose unto god and they're trustworthy hallelujah i told you austin i was going to help you out did i help you out can you trust me yeah i should be i should be a faithful christian if not it's time to repent amen everything i've told you i've done as far as i know if not let me know after service i'll take correction but that's what it means sacred believers who are trustworthy this letter is only to the trustworthy ones praise god and like paul said in titus they had elders in every city like akron every city should in every city that has the elect will have trustworthy people you can trust them right that's why jesus told peter he said because you've left all these he said i'm giving you families a hundred fold that means wherever peter traveled he could go into a christian's house and he was gonna get served because they were trustworthy they're not gonna mistreat peter they're not gonna call the cops on peter they're gonna feed peter and that's how it is with us right when we become real christians we inherit a huge family a real spiritual family to the saints that are in christ jesus a little more here on uh verse two i'm gonna skip uh sorry whoops i forgot to change this but i was gonna look at grace and peace let's look at grace and peace for a moment grace be unto you and peace from god our father lord jesus christ 14 times paul starts out letters like this you know what's the first thing that you would say i'd say god bless you you know that's a blessing right well when paul wrote a letter the first thing he'd say is grace to you peace to you grace and peace to you how do you want both of those that's a double blessing right there right grace and peace they're connected over and over again grace means unmerited favor so in other words he's saying may you have god's favor on your life and may you have rest and quietness how many were like that praise god in this loud world in this busy world he said i'm going to give you god's favor and i'm going to give you god's rest how many could use that today what do you say i can use it tomorrow when i go back to work i get a million questions on that on the school day tomorrow i could use some peace right there but notice also peace is the result of grace so if you ever receive god's favor that will give you peace in your heart because you know you're not at war with god anymore the bible says we were at war with god in our minds right we are at war with him but anyone who's received grace now has the peace of god in your heart so don't let the devil steal from you and the church said don't let the devil if you receive grace if you receive god's favor god's unmerited gift don't let the devil take your peace because peace is the result of having grace that's why that's what we talk about remember when you got saved what'd you feel you felt like this huge weight off your chest i know that's what i felt like when i saw tim anderson there praising god at the athletes in action and as soon as i repented and raised my hands i just felt like oh the weight of 19 years was off me i was like oh i can finally lift my hand thank god the weight of condemnation the weight of guilt jesus wants to take all those weights away lay those weights aside amen and run the race that is set before you hallelujah amen grace and peace to all of us today i know i could use some grace and peace what brings grace and peace it's god's presence i want to prove it by the bible when god passed by moses god moses had asked in chapter 33 of exodus he said lord show me your glory what a question what a question i want to see your glory let me say i want to see god's glory if you do you just got to wait on god and one of these days god is going to pass by in such a beautiful way you're going to tremble and hurt anointing you're going to you're going to cry under his anointing you might dance under his anointing you might scream under his anointing but when his presence passes your way you will feel the grace and mercy of god that's what his presence is it is grace and mercy amen it is his character it is his promises because he descended in a cloud and stood there imagine standing there with god god stands with you god said with moses if god said with moses god will stand with you too praise god and he proclaimed his own name and he said i am the lord what is he first he said i'm merciful and gracious that's why paul starts out all his letters grace and peace to you because when god showed himself to moses he was saying i'm giving you mercy i'm giving you grace church none of us deserve it none of us can earn it we should have some happy faithful saints here today by god's grace we should have some peaceful saints here today by god's grace the peace of god has so surrounded and filled our lives because of god's grace and this is what god god will always proclaim when his presence comes his presence will proclaim mercy grace long-suffering you mean god will still forgive me after the thousandth time i fail yes i'm gonna say it again god will still forgive me after the ten thousandth time i sin yes amen hallelujah praise god like we said last sunday paul did things he hated he knew they were wrong come on church you do things you know you're wrong but god's grace is sufficient he is longsuffering with you one of these days you're going to get the victory you might fight that critical spirit you might fight that lust demon for five days five years you might fight a long time but one of these days you're gonna get the victory because god is long-suffering amen however he forgives all iniquities praise god we know better yet we still do it but yet his mercy is declared before us amen hallelujah he's gracious he's merciful he's long suffering he's abundant in goodness and truth amen that was one of the blood of bulls and ghosts it's magnified today it's more grace and more mercy right it's the blood of jesus it's not law it's grace and the church said keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin that will by no means clear the guilty see there's they won't repent visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children and the third and fourth generation i'm trying to close here in verse 3 he says we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you he always prayed for the individual churches that's why we must pray for one another think about this when was the last time you prayed for the saints in the point when was the last time you prayed for the saints in sheffield or lorraine how about the saints in ghana paul his prayer life centered around praying for the believers and so our prayer life should center around that as well how many believe that see church you know listen we're not perfect we need reminders listen let me be honest i need a reminder to pray for the saints in the point because i have a lot of battles going on here you know they got battles going on too we need reminders that's why we got to pick these letters up and read them right help me to stop thinking about my own problems all the time help me to enter into somebody else's suffering pray for other churches paul in church he wrote this in prison he's right he's writing this in prison and he's a prisoner but he's praying for free people ah what what a sermon what a christian he's not praying god right now maybe he did but he said i'm always praying for you guys that's why brother bram says don't pray for yourself so much pray for other people in prison praying for the free people we're gonna close this in a moment by seeing what did he pray for because he actually tells us what did he pray for verse 4 since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints so again when the message hits a place when the message of jesus christ hits a place it causes them to all fall in love with one another hallelujah that's how we should be known we should be known as a church that loves each other because paul said i've heard of your love i've heard of your faith the bible says you are you are a letter of recommendation for the preachers you've heard that's what written epistle means it means you are the letter of recommendation brother dustin and betsy there are letters of recommendation to brother brooks's and brother cam's ministry right maybe brother craig i'm not sure how long they said under him if they did or not but the corinthians were letters of epistle their life was a recommendation about the preaching of paul may god help us to live such a life that the preaching from this church writes the recommendation on your lives amen amen and people can look at your life in the the letter speaking you should go to briana christ fellowship because they got the word of god preached there amen praise god your life should be so salty be so loving that people look at you and say why are they so loving you're you're a living recommendation you're a living invitation to come to this church praise god now we know if you there be to find it but you're still a written epistle known and write of god you must love all the saints with god's own love i'm almost done and verse 5 says our hope is in heaven for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven where have ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel i'm going to skip a pass a few of these here and i'm going to move on uh let's just look at his prayer let's close with this here so verses 9. i'm going to close with this and let's let's spend this uh the close of this service praying for other people that seems to be like a thought that come off here as we're preaching let's pray for other people verse 9 says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you he's imprisoned i'm not going to stop praying for the saints in colossae did he have a prayer life church what do you think absolutely he could pray in prison can you pray in your freedom or are you a prisoner to your job or your phone you see if we're not careful we become prisoners yet we're not in prison but here's a man in prison who can be free hallelujah praise god who can redeem his time and pray for the saints god help us church he will help us that's why we're preaching it that's his help to us amen to give us the word he said do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all my according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness isn't this beautiful how many think that's beautiful five prayer requests at the end of his well i'm sorry at the middle of this chapter he's at the end of his life the church only has 10 years if i knew the rapture was in 10 years what would what would i pray for right here right here we pray for this so this is what counts these are the major things how many can believe that these are the major things that we should have we should be what filled with all the knowledge of god's will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that's a highly concentrated verse or phrase right there i got knowledge i understand his will in all wisdom sound advice and spiritual understanding in other words for all the will of god for my life i understand god has shown me and i understand what i'm doing in my life second that you'd walk worthy of the lord and everything you did all your walk with god would be all pleasing to him everything you do is pleasing that's what he would pray for that's what a prophet would pray for you third you would be fruitful in every good work you would see fruit abound to everything you put your hand to amen you would see god's blessings you'd have testimonies amen hallelujah you come to church with testimonies amen hallelujah thank god i pray that they'll have testimonies and everything they do they'll be fruitful on their job fruitful in their family fruitful and witnessing and uh fruitful and prayers fruitful and praying for the sick you know whatever area fruitful in their song services you know i want to see them be fruitful in everything they do that was that's what i would pray for as paul said for the last 10 years where this city existed increasing in the knowledge of god so this was the knowledge of his will but now this is just knowledge about god just knowing god more how many want to understand god more i've got a lot of room to grow especially with these prophecies you know they're all kind of the believe the sign people are attacking brother branham on prophecies i got a lot of room to grow there i've just come across some scriptures like wow i never it's like i read right over that and then you understand what he was saying there's a lot of room for me to grow about the knowledge of god for example god said that israel being there 400 years in egypt how long were they in there 430. everybody's thinking now good well how can that be it was thus saith the lord 400. but they're in there 430. see how many can you feel like they can grow an understanding now it's like you got two different thus saith the lord did thus say the lord fail of course not but god doesn't always tell us all the details about the prophecy so what do you have to do you have to find a man of god that's anointed the holy ghost points us back to the word and you got to pray and you got to pray for all understanding and all knowledge hallelujah see church people are leaving the message by droves do you know that it's going uh brazil there's a sister that used to live in brazil she's been emailed me last week she she heard the message in 2017 in brazil she said the year after that people started leaving in droves she said pastors are falling away by the by the dozens she said in brazil there's a message church in every single town now that that's probably exaggeration but because of these things that are brought out and the preachers don't have answers you know why because they're not digging into the word of god to understand these things better they're saying i don't understand prophecy so i'm throwing out the water could you imagine this i'm throwing about the water baptism i'm throwing out the godhead i'm throwing about the holiness closed and i'll just go back to denomination oh it's korah it's korah it's judas iscariot again denying the word for what selfish desire they never got those desires cleaned out of their mind and their body praise god see that's why i'm saying we need to grow because guess what saint satan is not going to make it easier on us the bible said that he's going to come keep coming in like a flood he's going to keep coming with questions that you don't know so you have to have an intimacy with christ amen you have to ask seek and knock and then christ will open it unto you this is what a prophet would pray for when you have 10 years left before the coming of the lord for judgment i'm not making prophecies but you understand before the end of this city ten years and what would you pray for at the end let's stand to our feet he'd pray that you would have strength in fact almighty can come unto what he would pray lord make them stronger to have all patience and long-suffering and joyfulness this is a man that he'd seen a serpent bite him a viper and he threw it back into the fire he prayed for publicist father of the bloody flux and he was healed man was healed instantly there's a man who was stoned by the ozone he was stoned they thought he was dead he just walked after a few minutes everybody left he got right up he said god god brought me back it's a man that saw a man fall off a two-story building he died he went down there and prayed for him and the man raised right up here what would he pray for you do you see any miracles in there we love miracles but are miracles in that prayer no it's more about your character it's about you understanding god's will now god's will for you maybe miracles maybe tongues and interpretation maybe wisdom but this is what a man of god would pray for for you and i church it's a reminder about this simplicity that's in christ it's in a reminder that there is no continuing city here we don't know how long we'll be here but god has given us a sufficient word how many know the word is good enough for us satan's trying to distract us all these things to get us away from the word the word's not so exciting as it used to be it's not so enjoyable as it used to be but yet it is it is everything that we have in need of it is the only thing that we have a need of let's bow our heads for word of prayer i appreciate your attention i appreciate you pulling on the word of god today let's first pray for our church and then i want to just take so you can stop the livestream i just want to take some prayer requests of any churches you want to pray for
