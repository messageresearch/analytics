mercy so minister to the people through Thy Word in Jesus Christ's name name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated case if you can switch over I do have a few slides here by God's grace hopefully this will work I know the iPad didn't work on Sunday maybe the laptop will work here okay well Glory all right we're at part 10 here by God's grace in chapter six so averaging about maybe two sermons per chapter here by God's grace so um this chapter is outlined by scoffield CI scoffield here uh the first eight verses are the Saints forbidden to go to law against each other and then verses 9- 20 is the sanctity of the body and marriage Hallelujah now in our outline this is of course uh Scofield's outline of the entire book all 16 chapters we're on this uh fourth section here we've done the introduction the Believers standing in Grace uh and their carnal divided condition about their favorite preachers and then dealing with sexual immorality the brother sleeping with his step uh mother and then uh we're looking at here we're kind of starting that and then we'll hopefully get to the sanctity of the body and marriage by the grace of God then you get into Christian Liberties for a number of or three chapters and then the headship in the Lord's Supper which how many enjoyed the Lord's Supper on Sunday praise God when that a beautiful time in the Lord hallelujah I love renewing my vows to the Lord hallelujah talking it over with Jesus the spiritual gifts and charity and then uh the resurrections because there's more than one Resurrection Hallelujah closing instrument I'm sorry instruction and greetings so tonight you know we we've kind of preached through these first two uh areas uh Paul knew they needed a more excellent way this was a church with a lot of trouble yes they had a lot of tongues a lot of interpretation a lot of Miracles they had so many tongues interpretation Paul said just now limit it to three now you got everybody wants to say something every wants to do something everybody's got a gift in time he said but just do three now when you're gathered together and if you don't have the interpretation just save your tongues for home right you had to set it online because they had so much going on which is one is is good in one way as it's led by the Holy Spirit uh but it's got to be in order he said God's a god of order praise God and so uh we looked at how they had divisions amongst themselves and then the sexual morality they weren't sad about it they had not mourned about it um and they needed to mourn about sexual sin it was leaven in the church and I would argue uh not in a mean way but I'd argue in a in just a scriptural way that all these are forms of Leaven uh because they're sin it's it's dis disorder it's disrespect it's confusion all these things uh lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life uh and then uh so tonight we'll get to how uh they sue each other the the the Christians here in this church were actually going to court against one another uh and then you know we saw we'll see how uh they battled drunkenness uh at the Lord's Supper so you know we came to we came to church on Sunday for for communion and nobody was drunk on the natural wine Hallelujah but you're welcome to get drunk on the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you might shout praise God you might cry you might weep you might dance you might scream you might whatever you're going to do you're going to give God glory Hallelujah because on the day of Pentecost they they were declaring the wonderful works of God look what God has done Jesus Christ is alive God sent his son he's raised from the dead he sent his holy spirit to his people hallelujah they were just declaring all the wonderful things God had done hallelujah so let's have a drink tonight of this the great Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and then uh they were AR or they were uh dividing themselves by finances who had more money than others and the rich would to eat with the poor and so forth and then their gifts were out of order no interpretation causing confusion he said it's like Barbarians in here people are speaking in tongues and no one knows what's being said it's it's like there's barbarians around here so we got drunken people we got sexual immorality we got bar barbarians we got all these things in one Church what a church I said what a church that needs some cleaning Hallelujah brother Bram said brother BR said the gifts were to keep the church clean Hallelujah so if they could get the if they could get the gifts in order it would clean out the church Hallelujah and then uh they were lacking generosity Paul said none of you gave me anything when I was struggling it was all the church at Philippi gave gave me to my need so they weren't even generous you had rich people in there that weren't generous arguing about who's the greatest preacher rich people suing the poor people or rich people s suing rich people this was a book of Acts Church we'd say remember Paul said Paul was told by Jesus you have much PE I have much people in this city so this shows this is a really young church right they were really young immature but there many of them were Believers Paul said so but many of you are sick and weakly and dead because you haven't judge each other so I wonder what some of them died for maybe suing other people maybe having sexual immorality uh maybe being prideful about their Financial State I mean these were all things that were were still currently existing after many were weak and sickly and basically had brought a temporary curse upon themselves so what what an interesting church this is we we say that that that's saying the least and then they they would allow all these false preachers to come in and Paul in the second letter my wife was reading it this week too in the second letter Paul has to go through listen I'm a real saint of God look at my resume H how how how can I not be a true servant of God and Paul's trying to open up their eyes say I'm the true servant these guys are the fake ones they're not under persecution they're not suffering for being a Christian all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution just this week I was called Cain on an email I was called Kan Kane I was called a knead on a on a sermon I was called now they didn't call my name but they referenced my videos I made they call me a knead they call me a knowitall uh I'm telling brother BR I have a greater Revelation than brother brandham I'm wasting your time and my time just this week what has the last 10 years been all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution praise God that was just this week that's actually not a bad week actually I've been caught a lot worse things than that verse one dare any of you now dare in our in our language means to express shock so Paul's saying I'm shocked at any of you having a matter against another you would go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints now courts in those days were not the same as today today you file in this room and yeah there might have TV cameras on there but not mostly for People Like Us in those days though courts were out in the public and people came to watch the Roman government invited them to come because it showed their power and authority especially with crucifixion uh you know a Roman citizen could never be crucified that's how bad the crucifixion was it was such an awful death it was the worst death of course we know our Lord had to die that way to save us hallelujah thank God Amen but they were public shows and and they were uh they were designed to be entertainment you've seen the Roman Coliseum where they're entertained with uh humans uh fighting lions and bears and all kinds of animals you You' heard things about that this was their form of of teasing people mocking people making fun of people and Paul said how dare you take another Christian to the court Hallelujah and not before the Saints so he said you have a courtroom he said but it's the house of God hallelujah amen not out there with us the the sinful public but it's with the Church of the Living God that's your court that's where we going to get a real Fair court trial hallelujah it's simply not an option for us some of you probably reading my notes going on you know the uh the closest thing I've heard was in 2001 when uh brother Donnie Reagan from uh Johnson City Tennessee had said voice of God that's the company uh that prints brother Ram sermons on book and makes copies and translates brother bam sermons for other countries they threatened to sue his church and any other churches who are making their own copies of brother brandom's sermons which was a bunch of nonsense but eventually they stopped their threats they sent letters through lawyers saying don't you copy anymore and brother Donnie was just bringing out this scripture Paul dared them how dare you he in other words expressing shock and disdain that proves What Spirit these people are under if they're claiming the name of Christ and suing Christ's children in front of Sinners that's the whole point here in front of of Sinners it it's it's uh and Paul's saying if you're going to have a a dispute yes we're going to have them I'll show that in the next few slides here we're going to have them but if we're going to have them let's keep it in house Hallelujah so Church Believers have always had disagreements it's just part of the Christian experience if you haven't yet you haven't been a Christian long enough Hallelujah like I said you want to see Miracles hang around you want to see dis disputes hang around you're going to see him by God's grace because that's that's just human nature we're partly human and we have a little portion of God's divine nature Hallelujah a measure Jesus had the Holy Ghost without measure in other words the full all the power all the authority uh the the full obedience to God but we've got it in a measure so we've got measures of us that don't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah your flesh really don't have the Holy Ghost it might have it for a few moments or maybe hours while you're praying or dancing or walking in the spirit rejoicing or something like that but eventually that anointing lifts Hallelujah and then you uh begin to feel like a human again but Abraham and lot Abraham was much uh more dedicated than lot brother Abraham called Abraham like a silver dollar lot was like a penny Hallelujah but there was disagreements with their herdsmen so how they solve it look the gentleman stepped in Abraham as gentleman says stepped in you take the choice I'm even though I'm older I'm your uncle I'll give you the choice to take whichever land you want what a Christian gentleman that was not demanding his own way it's got to be my way it's got to be my way he walked in there with humility said you take your choice Hallelujah and what he made the wrong choice it led to the death of many of his family members including his wife made the wrong choice he based upon what he saw with his eyes not what he knew in his heart am he should have known in his heart he was saved eventually but he should have known in his heart that he was going to his family was going to get captured by the cares of this world but he didn't have enough wisdom and understanding again he wasn't as spiritual as Abraham Moses and Jethro Moses like I spend all my time with these arguments and disputes Jethro said give all the easy ones to the the these other 70 and you just handle the big ones so that means we're going to have little disputes in our church and we're going to have big disputes in our church brother rod have you ever seen a dispute in a church he's been a Christian his whole life I was raised in the church and I've seen disputes in every church I've been there's always a dispute somewhere it's just human nature but we got to let the divine nature decide who's right and wrong hallelujah amen remember Paul says in later in this letter he said heresies have to arise to prove who's the true Servants of God but now if both if both so if there's a dispute in the church and one person's wrong and they humble themselves or repent well then they're not a heritage anymore you know they're they're just corrected they're just now more mature if they keep a good attitude toward it Hallelujah and the whole Book of Judges what is that about we need judges we don't have a prophet to judge here Moses has passed on Joshua's dead we need judges to judge all our disputes remember Absalon stole the hearts of the Israelis on their way in to get judged by David he stole their hearts and the first murmuring in the book of Acts in chapter 6 when the Grecian widows were were complaining we're not getting food like the Hebrew women what's wrong with us we're not we're not Jews something wrong with us and they're complaining and so uh uh they tell them okay now develop some deacons let's make sure everybody gets fed Hallelujah find me some Holy Ghost filled men and women that's what we need today amen now deacons are only men but today let's have Holy Ghost fill men and women that will solve the church's problems Hal Hallelujah right that'll solve the complaining the murmuring the backbiting whatever it is that will solve the problem get people that have the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen that's right Church you know that's right Hallelujah dare any of you he says so Paul recommends go before the Saints with disputes rather than the unjust why go before the unjust which are unrighteous sinful deceitful people why would you go take two Christians Saved By Grace washed in the blood and stand before someone who's not washed in the blood and it's likely not all the time but likely filled with demon powers look what these judges have done to Donald Trump and all these conservant they're filled with demon powers Hallelujah because they don't rule justly if they don't do the truth they're filled with demons of Lies lying Spirits so Paul said why would you do that go stand before uh unrighteous deceitful judges he said don't you know that the Saints will judge the world why would you go outside the church why would you go out to the world when you're going to judge them you're asking the world to judge you no it's tot it's totally backwards you're judging the world Hallelujah is that right you're judging the world why would you go out to the world to be judged you're going to judge them and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters so see someone who's got the Holy Ghost they can judge the big issues these big things like we saw fornication and drunkenness but even down to little small disputes amongst Brethren oh this person hurt my feelings this person well okay well let's talk about it right why keep a spirit of bitterness and resentment it's just a small little thing why why keep an e why let an evil spirit get in there surely we can judge if we got the Holy Ghost we can judge who's got a good spirit who's got a wrong Spirit just give him the word test that's what we find out every time in other words like like the Bible said uh if you're going to come against a pastor you got to have two or three Witnesses like it's got to be clear it's got to be so simple okay yes the pastor broke the broke the word here right but if not it's just an evil spirit on the other person it's a critical spirit and you got to say God forgive me I'm guilty of having a critical spirit forgive me wash me and give and renewing me creating me a clean heart renew a right Spirit Within Me Hallelujah but so hard amongst people even Christians sometimes it's so hard against them but we should be able to judge small little things and then big huge things like marriage and divorce that's a big one that's a real big one Hallelujah all these huge matters uh who's qualified to preach who's qualified uh to song Lead who's qualified to be a musician who's qualified to hold offices these are bigger things right who's qualified to be a deacon uh we're accusing a deacon of some wrong now that's a big thing because the deacons are ordained of God in the book of Acts and Paul lays out here's what a a bishop needs a pastor here's what a uh here's all the qualifications for a deacon there's no qualifications in the Bible for a song leader so those aren't as as more severe or a a piano player or a organ player or a drum player everybody with me there there's no requirements for that those are smaller matters but God said if you can judge the big things you can judge the Small Things hallelujah amen so's no no question church at all you will judge the world Hallelujah the ninevites testimonies and the queen of the South testimony will judge those self-righteous legalistic Pharisees and through the Holy Ghost we can judge the smallest and the largest issues now some people will have more judgment than you could even have more judgment than the pastor really because it's called the there different gifts gifts of discernment so someone could have a greater gift of discernment let's say uh two talents of discernment let's say the pastor might just have one Talent of discernment well he still got some right now I hope as a pastor I hope my discernment is higher than others you know at least most people but that's the point like you know we God has all these gifts out there God wants to use all the gifts discernment means to judge judge the spirit does this come from God or does this come from the wicked one amen hallelujah so if we have the Holy Ghost and we get in the mind of Christ then surely God will show us what to do I was reminded this week did you know before uh George Washington and all the founding fathers do you know before they started the war did you know they prayed for hours before they would start their meetings hours like two or three hours and they did that for years before deciding to go to war and yet we'll make a decision about something big something big in our lives maybe a job or maybe marriage or something and we'll just make a quick decision like that and we don't even really realize have we put enough have we really given God time to get uh to speak to us to get past all of our own feelings and ideas and opinions in other words if we want to draw close to God we got to be sincere Hallelujah we got to keep the feast with sincerity and truth hallelujah now just share this I dated and then courted my wife for four years before or four and a half years before I proposed so see I God had gave me time to know to marry the right one so see what you got to do buddy see what you got to do brother when that time comes buddy you better pray now I'm not saying God can't do something quick God can't do something quick I'm just saying you you know in that in that area of my life God uh dealt with me for years years and I ask God for signs is she the one God always give me a sign hallelujah hallelujah right darling hopefully she got a sign too now your life the current life you live right now the way you live your life is a either a a blessing to others or it condemns the unbeliever because Noah moved with fear his building the ark condemned the world so what I'm saying right now yes you'll judge Angels later yes you'll judge the world later but you're actually judging others right now Hallelujah kind of indirectly the way you live your life judges all these other people all these people say they want to go in the Rapture well are they making themselves ready right it's just like Noah you want to be saved from the flood to come you want to be saved from the tribulation to come you better work like Noah worked Hallelujah we better put time into the word put time into prayer put time into the studying the word of God hearing the voice of God knowing the spirit of God Hallelujah Jesus said watch and pray that you be counted worthy to escape all these judgments that shall come upon the face of the Earth have we given God a worthy time to deal with our hearts to clean out our lives lives to wash us By the Waters of the word hallelujah now that's the question are we washed as thoroughly as we can be God again God's not asking for everyday Perfection but God's asking uh will you let him wash away all bad remaining habits and live Victorious over the devil Hallelujah and there's the anointing again I'm going to reference this just a moment this is the anointing to this breaks every Yoke the anointing breaks the yoke right so the anointing of Faith breaks the Yoke virtue breaks the Yoke of all these other sins I'm going to go through them at the end that's that's how this that that's how the anointing God builds you up strong this way and then caps you seals you off finishes you off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost love God is love amen the Holy Ghost is God hallelujah amen it's a mystery Paul said it's a mystery hidden from ages Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah so see your current obedience to the message of the hour what God is revealing right now brother ab's Ministry it already condemns the unbeliever you sisters when you walk around those skirts it condemns those women that know better that are wearing pants and shorts or those young girls that wear the slits the young teenage girls that wear slits and the sister said that's right that's right hallelujah or the sister I walk around in high heels yeah I'm a message believer walking around in high heels nonsense you wouldn't do that if you had the Holy Ghost Hallelujah wouldn't off your body you wouldn't make yourself body look like that you wouldn't do that you know it's not natural God calls us to be natural the way God made us hallelujah not made to do those things so see your life sisters when you dress that way Malachi when you dress when you guys get dressed Godly mercy and all these brothers that's what you do you're condemning the World by your actions that's why a lot of times they don't like you because you're your life condemns them Hallelujah that's right what did Jesus say the men of ninev will rise in judgment against you shall judge the world right so the men of nin will rise up and they'll condemn the Pharisees that was uh 600 something years before the Pharisees 600 700 years when the men of Nineveh repented at the preaching Jon it might have been 500 I can't quite remember but it was course it was uh hundreds of years before because they repented at preaching you know what God's looking for tonight somebody to repent by the preaching of the word if someone's living in sin and hasn't confessed their sin God wants you to repent tonight Hallelujah and if you do God will say I receive you if you don't God will say you better repent soon or you'll get judged right or you be condemned because the men of Nineveh just heard Jonah say you got three days I'm sorry 40 days right was it 40 days 40 days sorry you got 40 days or God's going to destroy this place and they got to business seeking God hallelujah that's right the of the South she'll condemn all these Pharisees self-righteous legalistic Pharisees because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon Hallelujah now I've read these before so if you repent sincerely after preaching it makes you worthy to judge others church and I know that's true even in our church if you and I Repent our church and other people don't repent and they fail to repent God will use us on the day of judgment against them that's right Hallelujah so it's very important to repent when you know it's time to repent to rejoice when it's time to Rejoice to give thanks when it's time to give thanks Hallelujah see traveling to hear the wisdom of preaching not Mighty Miracles like the Red Sea like uh you know Queen of the South didn't see the Red Sea part and all the billions of gallons of water she didn't see that all she saw was Solomon under the operation of of uh Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the heart with his gift of wisdom and discernment that's all she saw and yet she'll go to heav Heaven because she uh uh she supported the word of God that was revealed in her day Hallelujah the man of God who was preaching in her day she was faithful to it she believed it and she supported it Hallelujah she traveled far to see it Hallelujah and God will honor that type of faith that makes you worthy to judge when you're willing to drive or travel to to meet God when you're willing to do that that will judge others who are too lazy to do it Hallelujah just like if you're willing to repent in of service and say you're sorry you don't even have to come up for prayer you can tell God wherever you are but the main thing is if you really repented you'll be changed when you leave out those doors hallelujah or that door Hallelujah I guess you got doors one door two door Hallelujah you'll be changed God will know if you meant business or not amen Church we've been blessed to see these fulfilled prophecies from William brandham as well Supernatural works of the Holy Ghost Congressman Upshaw was in a wheelchair for what 60 years and brother saw a vision while he's in the service and and tells him he's going to walk he got up and walked and then he wrote letters to musolini and all these other guys telling his testimony trying to get them to come to Jesus a paralyzed man walked through God's Prophet Hallelujah I heard on tape brother man told Marilyn Hickey he said uh thus sayith the Lord you're from a place with mountains all these things you're from Colorado he said if you'll believe you'll have a baby thus sayith the Lord 10 years later she had the baby Hallelujah and she only had one baby Hal Hallelujah but it was thus sayith the Lord hallelujah see thus sayith the Lord cannot fail that's God speaking through a prophet that's God giving his spokesman his word hallelujah and it cannot fail Hallelujah that's right no you're not that we shall judge Angels now this is confusing to me as far as not in a bad way but I just don't understand how we will judge angels I would imagine I'd imagine you know as Paul cast out Devils you know out of that woman that with the spirit Divination in the book of Acts I imagine Paul will judge that angel on I'm sorry that fallen angel on the day of judgment because you tormented that girl I condemn you to Hell something along those lines or maybe Jesus will say that but God will raise up Paul and that woman that that got the demon offer hopefully she got saved right by God's grace and God will use those Believers to say devil you tormented me all those years all those months but now God's given us the Victory and now you're condemned because you rejected Heaven you rejected God and you're judged uh to be annihilated in the Lake of Fire cuz that's why hell was created for the devil and his angels Hallelujah is that right amen what about these angels Paul said Paul said there's going to be Angels that'll come around and try to preach a different gospel like they did to Joseph Smith Joseph Smith met an angel all these preachers on the internet say meet Angels but they're preaching a different gospel if they don't repent of that those demons are going to lead them to hell if they repented that and if they admit I was a false teacher I taught the word wrong I believe false prophecy God forgive me wash me in your blood I'll never preach again I'll never prophesy if they really genuinely repent then on the day of judgment they could judge Angels amen hallelujah don't you think Micaiah Church don't you think Micaiah will judge that lying spirit that was upon those 450 prophets because he knew it right he knew Hallelujah he knew he said the Lord showed me I saw the Lord High lifted up and the Lord was in his Temple Hallelujah glory to God and all these Spirits came forth and finally the lying Spirit don't you think M will stand there and as a testimony you lying Spirit you tried to have me killed you had me tossed in prison got me beat and all these things like that I judge you I condemn you to Hell by the grace of God by the power not by the grace but by the power of God the Judgment of God hallelujah don't you know we'll judge the world and we'll judge angels angels that likely probably tormented people around us or even ourselves in our lifetime hallelujah what about 2 Corinthians 11:14 where Paul said Satan will transform himself into an angel of Light don't you believe anybody that says they saw an angel heard an angel take that Angel's word back to the word because a real angel will never change what Jesus Christ told Paul to preach Hallelujah the Bible said right now Jude 1:6 we've already gone over and second Peter 2:4 there are already Angels now in Chains awaiting that judgment so I imagine that's the angels that were uh uh I'm sorry the fallen angels that were battling the former Believers like maybe Noah's day and maybe even the days of the Lord Jesus it's really interesting though I don't have all the answers on it but we know we will judge the a we will judge the world and we will judge Angels if we can judge the world and we can judge demons he says how much more can we judge things in this life Hallelujah if we're going to judge going into eternal life and and our judgment will make people either be saved or lost he said how much more should we judge right now Hallelujah everybody's thinking real deep huh so Matthew 25 we get this scene at the uh the great white Throne judgment and we can see how Saints will judge the Earth right we know that these are the ones that are lost uh Jesus said depart from me you curse and everlasting fire prepared for the Devil's Angels we're familiar with this I'm just going to skip ahead so this is what the judgment will sound like Jesus will say depart from me let's say to these people in akan or something like or or people uh in Havasu or something like that you know just something around here he said because you didn't repent at the preaching you heard at at bride of Christ Fellowship and they'll say I never heard you preach a bride of Christ Fellowship Jesus and he'll say I was preaching through the fivefold ministry here or there and the saints that were in bride of Christ Fellowship will raise up and testify against them because they didn't repent but we repented Hallelujah everybody see that by God's grace quite quite plain so Jesus gives the condemnation and Jesus even lets them say what when when did I I never saw you sick I I never saw you in prison I never saw these things and Jesus will tell them it was me in my church it was me in the body I'm the head the bride is the body amen Church imagine that we're connected to the Head Hallelujah we are the body of Christ in other words he's moving he gives the intelligence for us to move Hallelujah he tells us what to do he tells us what to say he tells us how to judge he's the mind we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm so encouraged because I've seen in all these people come against me over the years I've always seen God Prevail all these accusation against me like I said I just you just got to do what you got to do you got to stay with the word of God hallelujah or it might sound something like this depart from me you didn't travel far enough to hear the word of God like the Queen of Sheba or the queen of South and they said I never heard you preaching far away Jesus and Jesus will say when you heard about your chance to travel and maybe drive two hours to go to the akan church my fivefold Ministry was preaching or maybe you have to travel to go a certain place uh maybe to make it your home church and you failed to go Jesus would say that was me preaching you didn't travel you didn't make the sacrifice to see me preach right and here are the Saints that went and traveled all those hours they drove across the state they drove through snow I know my wife and I can say Amen we were talking about that we were young we were kind of foolish well I was kind of foolish I'm not gonna say my wife I was kind of foolish when I was young I drive through any snow any snow and a couple times some of our friends found us got in the ditch you know we were just there's no wisdom right and then God had to show me I almost hit a car one time going home from church so I've tried to learn to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord to have the wisdom of God because Zeal so quickly eats up wisdom so quickly but Jesus will say listen I I I I never heard about you preaching an acan how could I I never I never drove there because I didn't know and Jesus said it was it was me in the fivefold ministry not just me but all the preachers amen oh it's too far to go to church there's no excuses the queen of sha didn't make any excuse Hallelujah when nobody else was at the altar I didn't feel like I should go up and repent there's no excuses amen if God speak into your heart follow the leadership of the Lord hallelujah clean out your house amen clean out your temple praise God it's God's house listen to the voice of God hallelujah he'll say depart from me you curse you didn't visit me when I was sick you didn't give clothes to me when I was naked you you didn't give me water to to me when I was thirsty and take me in when I needed housing nor yet uh you didn't visit me in prison they say I never saw you sick naked or thirsty homeless or imprisoned and they'll say when you saw Christians in these conditions it was me because they're my body and here's the saints that actually went and visited them gave them clothes visited me in prison prayed for me when I was sick he'll raise up Believers that were faithful to the word of God like Brother Andy raber so so eloquently told me uh when he was coming here he remember he was our song leader for a while that remember that my wife remember that such a wonderful song leader but one even before he came here my wife had baby I think it was Caris I can't remember which one it was so Andy Andy call Andy has his wife call all the sisters in the church they fill up an entire uh truck bed full of frozen food for our family and he drives it two hours here and we had just enough room in our freezer all the food could get in there the little left s we cooked that night and I said I was crying I said Brother Andy what can I ever do to repay you and he says these words he says what other reason are we here other than to help one another and that those have stuck with me all those years Caris is what 11 now yes I got it 11 you believe that joking would you understand what what other purpose are we here to help out when we can help out especially if somebody's sick naked thirsty homeless remember even a cup of water I'm thirsty brother Jess even a cup of water in the name of the disciple you get a reward for that just just be we just got to be sensitive to what are the needs of the church how can I help out maybe I can just go visit and pray but it's like you're visiting Christ Hallelujah and these are things that are are these are works that is proof a person have saving Faith we're not saved by works we're Saved By Faith but Faith causes us to work work Hallelujah so we kind of know what it's going to sound like to judge the world this is what it's going to sound like I never saw you Jesus I never saw you well I was in Pastor Jesse I was in Sister Lydia and you didn't do it right that's what it's going to sound like and you will judge The World God will raise you up or raise somebody else up who is willing to do it willing to travel willing to repent willing to do all these visit the sick pray all these things give clothes all these things God will raise up somebody that was willing to do it God help us to hear the voice of God tonight Hallelujah if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church notice the most humble Saints in a local church should be trustworthy to judge between their more esteemed brothers and sisters so I'm not don't raise hands but who who among us if I said name me the most spiritual people people in our church who would be the first few people okay now if I said who are the least spiritual people in the church don't say names out loud okay give me the few names of who would be there Paul said if we truly have the Holy Spirit the people that we thought maybe the least of the least esteemed the least popular the least even they will be able to judge the matters correctly you know why because they're humble because they know they're nothing they know they're nobody so Paul said just get the least they're so humble right who who Glory who does God draw nigh to the proud or the esteemed or the humble that's right good answer Church you're good Bible believing Church Hallelujah keep studying the scripture where does God Draw N to the humble he resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble and Paul said even a baby Christian could judge these matters this guy suing that girl or that girl suing that girl even a baby could judge these things find the most humble those are the be the people qualified to judge now notice Paul is speaking all this to shame them now I don't remember the last time I preached a sermon that shame the church I don't remember the last time I tried to put shame on you so God hasn't led me to do it but as a preacher I could be led to do that if we are in a a similar condition to the way the Corinthian Church was thank God we're not now there's some areas we can grow in absolutely yeah let's be honest we we all can grow but this was written this was written to shame the people how dare you do these things why would you go to the world to judge Saints you're going to judge them it's you're going backwards totally contrary to God's thinking he said then he shames him again is it so you don't have a wise man among you you got all these gifts all the prophecy all the tongues all these interpretations you got all this but you don't got one person with any wisdom in their mind you have to leave the church with the gifts and the supernatural got to leave that to go to a bunch of demon possessed people to judge your matter to get your way God have mercy no not one shall be able to judge you don't have one in this church you have 10,000 instructors Paul told me you have 10,000 teachers everyone want to step up take their chance okay it's my turn to teach okay next brother it's his turn to teach all these instructors he said you don't even have one of those guys that can sit down and judge between two people trying to sue each other and stop this nonsense but brother go to law with brother like I said can you imagine me in this church we're all leaving I say God bless you brother Patrick I'll see you in court tomorrow I'm gonna get my $100 back see you God bless you can you imagine that that's what this church was God bless you brother I know You' never do that take shaking hands on Sunday love you brother see you in court on Tuesday you're GNA you're G to give me my car back you're gonna give me my house back that that's that's the Holy Spirit no that's not the Holy Spirit that's a selfish Spirit he calls it a extortioner spirit later he calls it a robbing Spirit he calls it out it's a shame a church filled with all these gifts so see Church you know even even I even I I want more gifts in the church Austin I would love to see more tongues interpretation prophecy all these things but yet you can have all that and still have all this nonsense and then brother R tells us don't be don't don't ever try to imperson something just be what you are just be just be humble and let God Work among you don't try to be something that you're not just wait on the Lord and what he'll renew your strength like the eagle how many know that you ever been weak before and you just wait on God then all of a sudden oh I got my strength back by God's grace got my vision back Hallelujah I got my I got my Zeal back Hallelujah now as is balanced they could find so many people speaking with tongues but not one person has wisdom or judgment how can you speak in tongues and then speak lot uh hatred and lies like I'm going to go sue you right exactly or prophesy or any of those Faith speak in faith and yet then go I'll see you I'll see you at the courtroom and that's going to be out in front of everybody making fun of us mocking us oh this is what Christians are H what a bunch of Pretenders impersonators oh they just got head knowledge just head religion they don't have nothing real Paul says how dare you do something like that now therefore there is utterly a fault this means a loss or defeat among you because you go to law with one another why do you not rather take the wrong why would you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded or robbed so see church when this happens when when these disputes get so intense they've already been defeated and entrapped by Satan remember we preach on the snares of the devil when when people get to this degree like I'm going to have my way and I'm going to do something about this Satan has already trapped them they're snared and they can't get themselves out because Paul says you've already you're utterly with the fault you've already been defeated by Satan right you're asking demon-possessed people not always but most times judges to judge between Spirit-filled so-called members of the body of Christ you're asking demons to judge a the Holy Ghost but it should be the Holy Ghost judging those with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and their little mind battles which they battle spirits not possessed but maybe oppressed or tempted by temp temp or tempted by evil spirits it's better to take a wrong it's better to take a loss of money or whatever property and be defrauded than to ask demon-possessed people to judge the body of Christ because Jesus was already judged for them all their sins were placed Upon Jesus so why are we asking demon-possessed people to judge the body of Christ Christ has already judged he was righteous amen he was holy he's the son of God hallelujah he's already been judged and church don't you know God will fight for you let people wrong you like I said I I was after these people said these things this week I was like I was so uh Angry I'm just like I got to go I got to go work out so it went worked out I felt better afterwards work off all that I was angry like these people called me out and said these things about me brother Austin I was like but now I prayed about it I've relaxed I've worshiped the Lord and I'm just fine God will fight my battles for me if they're attacking me unjustly well that shows what Spirit they got but if I pray for them that shows what spirit I got amen hallelujah so in every case you have a chance to show what Spirit you're of Hallelujah in every trial you can show to everybody around you what Spirit are you operating under the Holy Ghost Hallelujah nay you do wrong he's talking about to the people suing which is unjust or wickedly and defraud Rob with your brethren so see some of these people going to the courts they were actually trying to rob them unjustly so get some money maybe some interest like the Bible condemns Believers from charge and interest to Believers remember the new Old Testament it speaks of that so Paul's saying some of these brothers are trying to sue for a little more money than that that they should actually get trying to rob them of money now Church why wouldn't God just kill some of these people like ananas and sairus they they were they were lying about money why didn't God just kill because God is rich in Mercy the church was Advanced from the day of Pentecost right and brother B said God you know through the seven Church ages through the seven Church ages they started losing the anointing right they lost it the low point was th Tia but then in Martin Luther's day they got more back John Wesley our day so it was solely dying and then it got a Reformation or sort of a a restoration in the days of the Sardis Church age right Martin Luther so see it had to be this and so God had to show Extra mercy God had to show Extra Grace Hallelujah remember Church they they were they were robbing people of finances but Paul tells us the next chapter husbands can rob their wives of marital pleasure and vice versa why wives can rob husbands of marital pleasure and the church said it's still robbing right whether it's money or whether it's uh family relations we'd say it's still robbing shall a man rob God how about Rob God's son or do God's daughter right church right think about that I mean we gota we got to be spiritual praise God we got to be led by the Holy Spirit praise God so now I'm done with 1-8 now let's go verses 9 to 20 wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be feel quite good now by God's grace let's look at the sanctity of the body and marriage so right after the section on suing he goes right into don't you know he so said dare any of you to sue now don't you know eight verses later the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God it's an unrighteous thing for brothers to sue each other it's wicked he called it Wicked so clearly these people suing each other did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they might have been saved they might have had a certain level of sanctification but they surely surely were not born again there's no way if a man's trying to sue another man so he can rob him of a little extra money he he don't have the Holy Ghost in his soul I'm talking about his soul Jesus said I'm coming to give rest for your soul Hallelujah I'm going to give you the seal in your soul Hallelujah great in the Old Testament they couldn't have that remember they couldn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul in the old Old Testament cuz Jesus wasn't glorified according to John 7 37-39 but now you can have it in the soul and so Paul tells them these people suing people these people sleeping around these people divided don't you know they will not inherit the kingdom of God inherit means to possess given a lot of God's not going to give you a portion of his kingdom if you can't live the right way he's not like my wife was sharing with me a mem from Galatians uh before a a son is adopted he's got to prove himself worthy by a tutor right Galatians 3 says that you got to be trained by the tutor and then when you're trustworthy then I adopt you into my family that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Charity that's what it's called that's the spirit of adoption Paul says that Romans chapter 8 it's the spirit of adoption you're born again now God you're placed into God's family now God can use you praise God hallelujah Malachi have seen it but I had a brother come up uh he come up to me and he at that there in Tennessee at the youth ban he come up so humbly he said brother Jesse I just want to tell you I get to use you because you're right up front all the time sorry buddy maybe I use Mercy he comes up and he was real sincere he brother Jesse I just want to tell you it's an honor to meet you your videos remember that brother did you see it he said I your videos have helped me so much all these years I wanted to be able to meet you and talk to you and I'm like me I said brother it's an honor to meet meet you thank you I said cuz we're all saved by grace I just kind of laugh because I'm like I feel foolish around here you know who am I Mal gu knows me I'm just another man you know until the spirit of God gets on me then I'm Different you know by God's grace but it was it was just so uh it was just so encouraging to me that God it was another reminder God had put me into service to do his will I'm doing his will by the grace of God he said don't you know if you live this is unrighteous living this is living that's not uh it's not living that's born again living is these people haven't crossed over into the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that's what Hebrews chapter 4 says remember Hebrews chapter 4 says don't come short being left of a promise of God right that's what Hebrews chapter 4 says don't be come short of it in other words go into the promised land remember like Israel leaving leaving uh Egypt into the Red Sea that was like water baptism when you get baptized now Crossing through the wilderness was sanctification but the third step was Crossing Jordan taking your position in the promised land hallelujah amen and that's what it is for us we get saved then we got to get Sanctified which means purified and then we got to get filled with the holy spirit that puts us into service God can use us hallelujah amen you want to be used by God get filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah then God will use you Hallelujah so in chapter five he addresses a fornicator which even the world wouldn't do most worldly sinful Romans wouldn't do that a man sleeping with his stepmother Paul says that's so wicked but remember Israel did worse than the heathens whose land they took over right so people that that get accustomed to God when God becomes common to you Church look out you'll do things you never thought you'd do do not let God become common to you don't let the word become common to you because these people in the word they went the furthest into sin even than the Sinners and here it happened in the book of Acts Church unbelievable because you think you think oh God's so merciful God will forgive me he ain't going to forgive all that if you purposely transgress against him he ain't going to forgive all that unless you truly repent right and then chapter six he addressed the robbers these men suing each other so now he's going to rebuke all these sins didn't they know the kingdom of God is inherited through through obedience and what we preach on Sunday character you've been thinking about that I've been thinking about character are we you know on Sunday night I always I like I like to hear what my children remember for my sermon and almost every one of them said something about character I was like Oh Glory good I was led of the Holy Ghost to preach on character it's a good reminder it's your moral Excellence it's how obedient you are to God's word and Paul said don't you know God ain't going to let any just anybody inherit the kingdom of God it's people that are obedient they obey God's Voice Hallelujah they do what God says to do don't you know these people suing each other they're not going to get the kingdom of God this man sleeping around he's not going to get the kingdom of God these drunk people they're not going to inherit the kingdom of God brother Braham said he's quoting the scripture naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave oh no he says we're going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more there's only one thing you're taking with you when you die lyia reminded me of this I forgot this on Sunday thank you Lydia props to you he said we had better be real careful now to see what we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us hallelujah now what kind of character I'm sorry will you take with you will it be his whose character was molded by suffering remember Church the only time we get better at obeying is when we suffer it's the only time we're going to get better at a better Christian is to suffer it's not when things are going good not when everything's happening that's great and it seems like every prayer is being answered it's when we suffer then we're going to get better obeying the Lord or will it be the softness of this characterless leoan people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden now I was down there at that youth meeting too and I I I could share some of these brothers were really I mean they're coming out of services right so they're coming out they're all joyful and they're all telling me God corrected me on this and God corrected me on that they're just telling their their all their past sins and I'm like you probably don't want to say that too loud right which is it's okay I'm glad they're overcoming it but they get they better get build up stronger cuz those demons are coming back enjoy your seasons of Victory but you better start lifting some spiritual weights and get stronger because those demons are going to come back trying to get in with seven more enjoy the victory but there's a battle coming Hallelujah but see but you know this reminded me because all these these I should say all three or four brothers were telling me all their mistakes and I'm like oh you were struggling with that for years and my eyes are like years no I'm just going to put a word in there porn struggling porn for years or laziness for years or not reading my Bible for years or not praying for years years and I'm like okay Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord what kind of character do we have are we soft or do we have character like Christ that God lets us suffer God lets us go through trials so it keeps us closer to God hallelujah what kind of character do we have is it soft character or is it fir tried character like Jesus Christ that's the only thing you're taking with you now what's that character that character is the the the the the white robe the righteousness of Christ in other words Christ has helped you to do what's right go you have God's anointing to do the right things and the church say it's not your works but it's God's grace that's formed a character into you where you can yield to the Holy Spirit you can die every day hallelujah it's up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden I can't take your burden on I can't take your burden on you got to Bear your own sisters got to Bear your own burdens right I can't take on your burden you can't take on mine we got to overcome by Christlike character know you not that the unrighteous should not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolators adulterers effeminate men abusing boys so sexual abuse nor abuser of themselves with mankind homosexual nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers which are railers scolding scolding harsh abusive language so see that's done on like X and this is done on Facebook people scold like I I got a lot of railing done to me this week I was surely ra raked up and down the rails this week it was one of my favorite preachers too I was like oh man he's one of my favorites he's bashing me well that's all right I'll pray for him nor extortioners so there's the robbers he's calling out those robbers those men trying to sue each other none of them shall inherit the kingdom of God now Paul just lists 10 sins right and so so these 10 sins will keep you from the baptism of the Holy Ghost you ever understand that because because the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God Luke 17:21 Jesus says the kingdom of God is within you what's Kingdom it means rulership what is the Holy Ghost it's God ruling your temple Hallelujah so Paul says if you do these sins you're not born again the kingdom of God is not in you now for us in our church it's probably going to be uh you know if we're living pure sexually if we're none of us are going to be homosexuals or abusers it's probably going to be like thieves Covetous revi uh revilers extortioners maybe right as long as we're we're keeping our body in subjection to the Holy Spirit we're keeping our sexual passions under control now you remember this uh a couple years ago I preached on the 23 sins that disqualify from the kingdom within so these 23 sins keep the people from the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus gives us seven in Matthew 15 evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts or extortion false witness lying and blasphemies now I got I got a whole video on that so I'm not going to read all that Paul gives us 16 more sins idolatry a feminite child molestation homosexual sodomites Covetous Envy drunkards uh revilers uncleanness lasciviousness witchcraft which is also drug drug addiction hatred now think of that hatred hatred people hate people they hate others and they won't be born again men all because they can't love variance which is heated disagreements emulation jealousy see just because people are jealous they're not going to get the Holy Ghost you got to be happy for people if you want the Holy Ghost wrath passionate anger Strife electioneering for position desire to put yourself forward seditions heresies and reing now here's the sad part remember the Bourbon Street attacks on New Year's Day I told this to Haven it was so sad how many 15 people died but if they would have obeyed the Bible the Bible forbids loud parties that go late into the night that man attacked at 3:00 a.m. they should have been in bed and I'm not I don't wish any evil on anybody I just told Haven I said Haven revelings is one of the sins that if you have late night parties you do not inherit the kingdom of God other words the Holy Ghost is going to say go to bed so you get up early and pray now unless he keeps you up in the night to study and pray and fast or something like that you you understand there there's balance but think about that all those people would not have lost their lives if they just would have obeyed the scripture and so those people could never inherit the kingdom of God now of course because they're passed away of course they won't I don't know the condition before they got drunk or I don't know I don't know if they're drunk or not I'm just saying God forbids late night parties and such were some of you so we were all these things church we were all these things at one point and the church said good we don't have any self-righteous Pharisees in here tonight although I have been called a couple weeks ago the Pharisee of akan I've been called that too these railers I tell you Bo they surely know how to try to get me fired up but I won't I wrote I wrote that one guy back he called me Kane today I wrote him back I said and I said well that's fine your that's your own opinion I said I just hope the sweetness of the Holy Ghost will soften your hard heart someday he said you're just like cane of the cane seed and you can't all because I I believe um I believe there's seven years left in Daniel 70 weeks instead of three and a half that's the only reason he's calling me Cain that's it that's all that's why I said that I said may God soften your poor hard ice cold heart with the sweetness of the holy spirit will you believe in the same water baptism the same evidence of the Holy Ghost God sent a prophet all we believe all these other things we disagree on one thing now I'm Kain I'm sorry you got a hard heart this guy's got a hard Heart Lord help him such were some of you so I I know for sure I could testify I was a lot of those things but I love how the spirit of God makes us a were we were robbers and the church said we were sexually immoral and the church said we were drunkards or drug addicts and the church said but we've been washed Hallelujah we've been clean that's what sanctify means cleaned out set aside for service purified we were dirty but we've been purified by the name of the Lord Jesus that's why we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God there's only one other time the word wash is used and and they ananas told Paul rise up be baptized wash away thy sins calling upon the name of the Lord so how you wash your sins is repent of your sins say God I'm I'm sorry forgive me clean all this dirtiness out of my heart I want a fresh start make me a new creature give me a new life Hallelujah wash me in your spirit and then we can be the word group I I was that we were that but not anymore Hallelujah things I used to do I do them no more Hallelujah I'm in that word crowd there I were what did Jesus Christ do he loved us Jesus loved me Jesus loved you and so what'd he do he washed you from your own sins in his blood he took you and he drew you close to himself and he took his own blood and he washed all your sins away with his own blood and then he didn't stop there now that he's got youall clean he's like now I'm going to make you a king now I'm going to make you a priest if that isn't the love of God I never saw it Hallelujah to take a dirty stinking uh rotten uh Wicked person wash him with his own blood with his own sacrifice and then give him a position give him a purpose in life Hallelujah to be a king and priest unto God it's the love of God how rich and pure how glorious and strong Hallelujah it shall forever do endure Saints and Angels songs oh yes no say he washed Us in his own blood he made us Kings and Priests so we see God's predestination in view here that clock and in Revelation 7 now I believe these are the foolish vergins but some people believe it's the bride all right whatever again don't call me a Cain just because I disagree with you on one little thing I didn't kill anybody you're actually killing me with your words I I didn't kill anybody you're the one trying to kill me I didn't do anything he said these which came out of great not the Great Tribulation but of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb so now we get the idea in one way God brings us unto himself and washes us but here we get another idea we're supposed to go to God and we have the responsibility okay it's time for wash day now I know all you sisters love wash day and my house is just so much fun when you got 10 people to wash their clothes at my house you got to take one basket at a time dump it down the stairs another one coming another one got some more Yep keep coming yeah got some keep coming and who walks it over there to the laund or the the washing machine my sweet dear wife so she takes her own and all of our dirty clothes she takes it to be washed and that's what we're supposed to do we're not right with God we should bring our dirty gar and say lord it's time to wash these I'm bringing them to you I know enough right I'm not GNA I'm not going to have a hard heart I'm going to bring my dirty condition I'm going to bring my sinful condition to you because I know you make me clean Hallelujah if that washing machine can make the clothes clean what about the washing machine of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Glory how much more thoroughly will we be washed by the blood of Jesus Christ than your natural washing machine I told Naomi at some point she's going to tell the testimonies to our little ones about how she always grew up wanting a washing machine in the house so sister prepare that testimony our little girls and little Bros they don't know what they got I don't know what I got right we don't know what we got but look we have even something better than a washing machine a natural washing machine we have a spiritual washing machine and they don't they God don't take any coins either you can't you you don't pay for this this is all free I used to go to the lrat oh yeah I remember when you used to go buddy glory amen Vindication two witnesses but God's washing machine you don't have to pay you just got to carry your dirty clothes and put it into put it into God's machine Hallelujah and it all comes out perfectly clean and wide you don't even got to iron it it's already beautiful it's already clean so here here we see the will of man where we have the responsibility okay I know I'm dirty I'm coming to Jesus wash me I want to be one of those were I used to be like that I'm not like that anymore I'm almost done all things are lawful to me but not all things are expedient all all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any he's talking about the power of of drunkenness even homosexuality right robbing people reviling all those sin sexual sins all he said I'm not going to be a Christian should not be brought under the power of that where you feel forced to do do it I just have to do this I just can't escape it those sins don't control us we control them Hallelujah that's what Paul says then he says some of these things are lawful for me see we have to examine even the things that are lawful we have to examine is this beneficial to my life like I've told you before if you can't handle a smartphone yeah it's lawful for you to have it but is it beneficial that you have it can you really handle it or is it is it mastering you is it making you you do things you know you shouldn't do now you're a slave now you got to get out of your slavery Hallelujah whatever's making you do something you don't want to do you are a slave to that you're Mastered by that and Paul said it shouldn't be so Hallelujah see it's lawful to sue somebody but not for benefit as a Christian not for your beneficiary your your financial benefit my goodness now this second and blue this was the key to me beating tobacco chewing tobacco when I first became a Christian and this verse was the key to unlock my Temperance so I was I was a fresh Christian in the message a lot of good Bible knowledge but I couldn't overcome tobacco I told my wife I said I said we're engaged I don't know if I can ever overcome this I don't know but one day I came across that scripture I said oh my goodness I was reading the Bible I saidh and it was like a key jumped off the page to me ah it's it's legal for me to buy chewing tobacco it's legal but it's not beneficial and I realized wow I'm under the power of this how does this little can of tin have power over big me I'm 190 pounds what this little 3 o can has control over me this 3 o controls 190 I wasn't 190 but I realized I had just a moment that's right I'm my life is controlled by this little tin right some of our lives are controlled by the wrong things on our phone or the motivation for fame or or money or or sex or something something like these things you know uh uh robbing you know all these list he lists 23 of them their lives are focused on that getting back at people wrath jealousy their whole life is centered on this but we do not have to be brought under the power of anything I don't have to be brought under anybody's power except God's power now I'm going to show you a picture next so children if you don't like uh people that have had surgeries don't look at this next picture because this guy has surgery he's missing parts of his jaw this was the actual picture or very similar one I hung up when I was a message believer and you know what this picture it put the fear of God in Me When I saw that man missing his two jaws because of chewing tobacco it put the fear of God in Me So I cut this picture out of a magazine I hung it up in my room my dorm room I don't know if my wife remembers it and I wrote 1 Corinthians 6:12 everybody ready here we go look at these eyes ready yeah I'm listening now brother Jessie thank you I've been preaching for an hour so this is this is the picture I have this picture and I wrote I wrote with permanent marker and I hung it up there and this scared The Living Daylights out of me I'm a young message believer I would drive to church to chew tobacco to a message church and Chew Tobacco on the way home and I thought I could never quit but once I saw this I started I started trying to quit I didn't get I didn't get success right away I started throwing that thing away now maybe some people will throw some smartphones out in the snow tonight on the way out Hallelujah if you do leave it there leave it there or give it to me I'll go throw in the dumpster or making it up but this shook me and I'm like oh I am not going to become that I want to get married I want to have kids someday I want my wife to love me poor fell but at least he's got life I can say that he but this scripture I I so I would read it every day I will not be brought under the power of this I will overcome this power I know it's got a power me right now but it doesn't have to remain over me and I told you that testimony I kept throwing it out one Sunday morning I threw it out I remember I threw I Ste right out that outside that bookto Avenue house I threw it out there I dumped in my white S10 Chevy S10 it was such a small little Chuck drove all the way up to church two weeks later I get in the car again on a Sunday morning I'm like I have not had trth tobacco for two weeks I'm free Hallelujah I'm no longer under the power of Satan I am free Hallelujah two weeks I was walking with a protection of the Holy Ghost on and then I could take the picture I'll say praise God I'll never be that man Hallelujah i w I could have been that I was that but I'm not anymore Hallelujah I'm washed Hallelujah I'm cleansed and now I'm a king and priest unto God now I serve God I don't serve tobacco substance and addictions Hallelujah I will not be brought under the power of anything and church we all of us know when we're under a certain power to something we can't get rid of it we have we know when we go to bed at night we're wrong but God is here to set you free Hallelujah just take that scripture like I said many times I told people that you want to be free write that above your uh write that on your Bible read that every day and it'll build faith in you you don't have to be a slave to that you don't have to be addicted to that you can overcome that Hallelujah Jesus said I'm giving you power to become the sons of God that's why you get the Holy Ghost so you now have power to overcome addictions amen hallelujah even in the high school brother you can do it Claude even in the high school you can do it even in the high school brother with the Holy Ghost you're more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus more than a conqueror I don't care those guys walk around with their saggy pants I don't care care with those girls with their inod clothes on you can walk by them and pray for their their souls to be saved and not be tempted by those things you can walk with your head in the sky looking up to heaven I know God's watching me I'm not coming under the power of these things I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah that's right but it took fear at the at the beginning it took fear I'm not going to become that I won't become that and that little Mustard Seed Glory that little mustard SE of a scripture grew up into what I got now now I can walk by every I can walk by every Walmart aisle with all those different tobacco and cigar I used to buy cigarettes to I can walk by all that I don't need that I'm not under that power I've got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I'm more than a conquer in Christ Jesus I don't need that Hal I need more of Jesus Hallelujah that's what I need Hallelujah so that verse is always meant so much to me so I knew when I was going to preach 1 Corinthians 6 I had to bring that picture up I'm just glad I found it online one more look this is what the devil tries to do he tries to steal your future look what he does he tries to deform you and make you look not like the image of God like you're supposed to be you're supposed to be a true child of God you're supposed to you're supposed to look like a real Saint not some deformed thing meats are for the belly and the bell is for Meats but God should destroy both of them now in those days the the Corinthians just had that saying well Meats go for the belly belly for Meats so if it's there I'll just eat it remember carpm that sees the day remember that yeah you got that that's that's from Rome right and so what did that mean well I only got today I'm going to indulge in everything today that's what that would say so Paul's combating their thinking he's saying but God's going to destroy the stomach someday the belly God's going to destroy that right or you're going to die the body is not for fornication but it's for the Lord and the Lord is for the body a't that awesome God God wants us to realize our body is not for fornication the those are just little temporary Pleasures our bodies were actually made to give God glory to magnify God to do the works of God that's when your body is being used at its best Hallelujah not when your body feels the best by fleshly lust and things like that that's not what your body's made for your body's made to glorify God hallelujah I know you're getting tired I'm getting tired too and God has raised both up the Lord and will also raise him up us up by his own power one more thing I got to say where is okay there I know I'm going a little extra long tonight I guess there's an extra poll in here we got extra people here tonight so I think people are pulling here a little more by God's grace know you're not that your bodies are the members of Christ don't you know you're a part of the body of Christ if you were a part of this body let's say you're the shoulder let's say you're you're some type of a some type of a bone in here or something like that if you're part of the body of Christ why would you why would you uh put sin into this body you're part of the body of of Christ this body's sinless you're a part of the body of Christ would you take the members of a harlot and join them with Christ God forbid God forbid We join any sin into this body of Christ he lived above it so church we can live above it because he's inside of us hallelujah he's now inside of me Hallelujah think about that I was inside of we were inside of him at first Glory we we were in the mind of God and now God's in us hallelujah glor that was fresh to me amen we were inside of him and now he comes down he condescends and dwells in our soul what don't you know again he's shaming them what don't you know that he which is joined to harlot is one body don't you know you always be one with that person for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that's joined unto Lord is one Spirit remember Paul taught we're supposed to be married to Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right so that means when we're married to Christ we're baptized in his name we take on his name we're filled with his Spirit right we're married unto him we're joined under him we have the same Spirit as Jesus Christ people see Christ in you brother Mercy right people see Christ in you brother Patrick right right Malachi they see Christ in you when you yield to God's spirit because your spirit is one with Christ flee fornication see every time I read that I get the idea of Joseph right Piper's wife is like every day she's like sleep with me sleep with me let's let's go let's go make love let's do all these things and he's just like no no and finally the last time he's like I just got to run away and that's what we should do in Temptation run from fornication run from it he didn't try to listen to it like Samson well tell me some more Delila tell me he's like no I gotta get out of here it's time for a mile run that's what we should do church that's what the Bible says flee fornication run from it every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication he sins against his own body and I would Al also argue his own soul because in Proverbs uh Solomon tells his son don't go down to the house of that her gates are the gates of hell right now we know people can be saved from adultery like David right but few very few will find the narrow road that leads to Life Church there's over 30 STDs there's over 30 right that's why we that's why people uh shouldn't go join to harlots and just sleep around you should get marry one person and stay married your whole life the worst ones are AIDS now AIDS attacks your immune system and it could be fatal if it goes untreated now we know Magic Johnson of course that came out when I was a boy well teenager and he's still living because he had all the money to buy the it's called Art therapy but if you don't have the money for that you're going to die die you are going to die the second most serious one is syphilis it leads to uh damages the heart brain and other organs it's only curable in the early stages so if they don't catch it right away they die HPV is uh cervical throat and other cancers there's no cure for those infections once they got it it's a total judgment on them just like God said you sin against your own body you destroy God's Own Temple when you don't care of take care of your sexual uh passions Hepatitis B and C they cause chronic liver disease therosis and liver cancer all from sexual imorality they should I shouldn't say that here and herpes is a uh reoccurring sores and their lifelong but it's living with the mental uh Agony and the quality of life is totally destroyed all because of a few moments of pleasure and Paul said run from that you young people run from that so see for for some people this this helped me with my struggle some people need to see some people that are so sad because they've got STDs if that's your struggle you hang up a picture well be be as discreet as you can but hang up a picture of somebody that's crying weeping over all the pain from these STDs or death put up a put up a grave there died of age do something to try to overcome Draw N to God and God will draw n to you what is that that's the fear of the Lord hallelujah the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Hallelujah sorry about this thing I get a new one finishing up here what know you not your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you're not your own you can't do whatever you want because you didn't bring yourself here you can't do whatever you want God sent you here God gave you life God gave you breath you are not your own you are God's Property hallelujah amen because you were bought with a price you were bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am he purchased you on calvary's tree he said it is finished that's legal terms for it is paid and full I have paid the price for the Forgiveness of their sins I took the penalty of their sins that they could take on my righteousness and forgiveness of sins sin you were bought with the price there therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which is our which are Gods Church think about what's the most important thing you've ever bought probably a house or how about your car when I bought those two cars I got that I own right now I promised God I said God if you help me pay these off early I will wash these and take care of them and sweep them out and boy do I now sometimes I slack a little bit but why brother Mercy it was such a problem price I said I don't really want to spend my money on this you know but I want something that's reliable I don't want things breaking down all the time but I paid such a price that I'm willing to really go to the lengths to keep this in good condition because such of a price was paid and if we could only apply that to our spiritual State such a price was paid for me that I could have the the love of God eternal life then helped me to take care of my temple Hallelujah help me to glorify God everything I say everything I do help me to run from Evil flee from Evil that's what a man would do Hallelujah that's what a real saint of God would do they would run From Evil Hallelujah let's stand to our feet by God's grace I I was going to get I may I get to this on Sunday with a statue perfect man but church let me just I'll just share this one if I haven't preached this in a while musicians you can come oh I didn't want to do all this I got to go through all these clicks but I guess I just stopped there see in My Life Church in my my life when I was battling that uh spirit it was the sensual Cravings of tobacco I had to win this battle in over in order to get the anointing of God right and sexual sexual Temptations Fallen here too so I had to fight that battle see I I had to start trying to fight it before I was just a slave to it I was just giving into it but God's saying come on fight uh I don't know how to fight oh you got a Bible right there I don't have any weapons you got the word of God it's the best weapon I ever gave anybody same weapon Jesus had Hallelujah it is written Hallelujah I just had to learn how to fight okay I gotta read every day I got to look at this every day I got to quote this scripture I got to try to over I got to try to resist this and I learn to overcome and God Wash Me by the Holy Spirit Church God can do that for anybody here tonight how many believe that

evil thought about a woman in 33 years you never cursed a brother or sister cursed a parent you never did anything wrong Lord for 33 years that was the price and then you got beaten and your beard ripped out and spit on and slapped for me for my sins oh God what a price was paid they stabbed you with a spear they mocked you they blasphemed you oh God they made you carry your own cross they whipped you 39 times until your bones stared at you this was the price paid that I could live holy this was the price paid so I could glorify God in my body and my mind which are God's and not mine oh God tonight let us remember the price that was played Lord God you paid the ultimate sacrifice the ultimate price oh God may we not be brought under the power of anything except the power of the Holy Ghost Lord God Lord let your people be honest with themselves tonight if they're under a power of any evil spirit I pray they will start fighting against it in the name of Jesus Christ may they resist Satan and Satan will flee in my case it took some weeks or months but Lord I kept resisting and you gave me Grace other people have had testimonies they just laid down their bottle one day and they're done with drinking the rest of their life Lord but you're the Great Mighty conqueror you're the Great Mighty deliverer Lord God you're the great physician Hallelujah you know how to heal you know how to do the supernatural work you know how to give us victory over these evil spirits and one day we'll judge those demons Hallelujah Lord Jesus God we thank you for overcoming power today I pray our teenagers could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in those high schools I pray our adults and parents could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our homes so the children can see what the real spirit of God looks like a life that's worthy of the Gospel granted Lord Jesus those of us who work outside the home may we have such a life consecrated to Christ that people can say that we're filled with the Holy Spirit real Christians Lord we don't like to say it but may we live such a life where our works condemn the Sinners or maybe we'd say it convicts the sinners and they want to get saved Lord God lord we know all that the father has given will come so Lord we praise your name tonight Lord God and we ask Lord anyone that would need prayer anyone Lord God that would need Deliverance they would seek it tonight I pray for brother Chris Lord thank you for bringing him back lord what a timely thing that is Lord God I pray for my brother Lord God that he'll overcome his trials Lord
