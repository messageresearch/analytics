[Music] lord that you walk beside us for we know before we were christians we were walking on the narrow house on the broad path that led to destruction and then lord the bible says the great shepherd left the 99 to go and save the one that was us lord god you left lord you left and you went and saved us and you brought us to the fold of god and now we're not alone hallelujah now we walk that narrow road and you're right by our side we're walking the light and you're in the light dear god hallelujah and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all righteousness thank you lord that we don't walk alone we're never alone because of your mercy today god we give you thanks and praise hallelujah thank you for being with us lord through the good times as we sang earlier through the bad times you're not on the mountain you're also not in the valley hallelujah and you promise and never leave us or forsake us thank you for the fire that you've started in our lives in this church oh god and father we're here lord to walk with you we're here to hear your voice today and the sweetness of this atmosphere speak to us today i'm unit to you lord we're unity you each one is unity to you today so speak through your word oh god hallelujah and may your voice be so clear so sweet lord that we don't have mistaken god but we can recognize your voice and carry out the command and lord hear the voice of love you're the voice of mercy the voice of peace today may we hear it god for your glory and lord be comforted that you've spoken to us today and we'll give you thanks and praise in jesus christ's name amen amen praise god i understand and take our bibles here this evening or this afternoon rather we like to look at the word of god i want to look at the church ages again here we i didn't get quite a chance to finish it so i'd like to finish that message from wednesday night today so let's go to ephesians chapter 3. i'd like to just start there this was our text on wednesday ephesians 3 5. ephesians 3 5. praise the lord we'll just read this one verse and then we'll have to be seated here by god's grace ephesians 3 5. now notice here the bible says there was ages previous to paul's day and then we'll read another verse here of course where the bible says the there's ages after paul's day so according to the bible there's ages all throughout human history praise god ephesians 3 5 let's read that together ready 1 2 3 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit let's go to colossians 1 26. we're willing we'll kind of dig down a little bit further into the lives of the kings of the old testament and trust the holy spirit will be able to speak a word to you and bless you colossians 1 26 praise god let's read that on three one two three even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints amen god bless you may be seated here praise god so just keep your bibles handy we're going to just flip through some scriptures here uh by the grace of the lord and i do have a few slides to show today by god's grace well i tell you i enjoyed getting that extra hour of sleep i hope you did too i slept about nine hours last night that's the longest i slept in a long time so i kind of feel a little bit energized today naturally so i thank the lord for that and uh trust you got some rest as well by the grace of the lord so as i showed this on wednesday you know my source for this uh thought you know uh actually came from this book it's that book by the pentecostal preacher kevin connor it was his book that i also read about the seven feasts of israel which really gave me a great understanding about god's prophetic timeline for all or for all human history really it's just a beautiful book he's a pentecostal preacher and which is interesting as i was reading through it he's able to catch that the old testament has church ages and he actually identifies certain names of the of the kings but then in the new testament he's not able to identify any messengers it's interesting but it kind of goes to this pattern of how uh the bible said that the word of god would need restored at the end time right and so in other words uh throughout the ages they would have bits and pieces of truth but at the end time god would finish it and he would finish the mystery of god amen and so we're thankful for that by the grace of god now here's the picture i just looked at this last sunday morning and i was just sitting there and my eyes you know just got really wide and i said there it is so uh the brother the pentecostal brother this is page 148 was able to see how solomon was a messenger uh jehoshaphat uh amos verse nine or chapter nine he doesn't name a person but then hezekiah josiah doesn't name a person then names nehemiah and then shows how the early church had revival so he was able to point out and most of these i agree with i agree with you know i agree with ezra josiah hezekiah jehoshaphat and solomon okay but i kind of have my own ideas on a few other ones as we looked at on wednesday night so i want to uh i want to just kind of just rehearse real quick you know i guess i'll skip some of this but in 1954 brother braham mentions this he says seeing in the old testament how they were perfectly typed at the beginning in solomon on down through the time of ahab the dark age and i'm not going to read through all this again you can listen to it on on youtube now on youtube i did make the video unlisted because there were some statements i made in there that i didn't want to go public so if they already went public no problem but i just thought it'd be better to make that one unlisted so you can uh go through there if you'd like um and then we just read two scriptures we read two scriptures that showed how there was ages in the past and then in my book i wrote this as well ephesians 3 21 said unto him be glory in the church by jesus christ throughout all ages world without end so if you take those two scriptures we read for our texts plus this one it shows how there's ages before paul ages after paul so that means the days of paul it was an age as well in other words god always has ages now you'd be surprised that people have left the message say there's no such thing as church ages and i even listened to him this week and said there's no such thing as ages in the bible well apparently they got a perverted version of the bible because our bible that was backed up by vindication by prophecy by thus saith the word of god all these promises our bible records ages in the past and the future so that means there must be ages all throughout all human history praise god so we rejoice in that and we have confidence in that now i'm going to skip past some of these we have three types of church ages in the old testament we have moses's golden candlesticks which jesus christ interpreted as seven gentile cities in revelation chapters one two and three and then joshua's seven chapter book that he had written before he died that types of seven church ages as well and now the kings of israel which is new to me type the seven uh church ages also now i want to get i'm skip ahead i'm gonna stop right here now you got your bibles in the church age book brother brown brings this thought out that he mentioned numerous times before uh let's have some readers here malcolm you got your bible here brother amen can you get hebrews 13 8 brother amen uh malachi can you get ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15. let's have a few readers here this this afternoon brother brandt brings out this thought you might remember it's called the keystone of the bible now the keystone is a foundation stone it's another word for cornerstone when i looked it up that last time so brother abraham says when he was studying for the church ages the holy spirit showed him a keystone of the bible okay and these two verses give us the keystone so brother amen can you read hebrews 13 8 brother amen so jesus christ is always the same in the past present future in other words jesus will never change so uh malachi ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15. amen praise god now hopefully by god's grace you can see that that out of those two scriptures god never changes now i'm going to read one as well malachi 3 6 says for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed so the the keystone the cornerstone of the gospel is that god never changes and what god did before he's doing again amen praise god right in other words god goes over cycle prophecy cycles time and time again like we've seen that song these are the days of elijah are they yes they are in other words uh there's a people with the holy spirit that are standing up against ahab and jezebel amen hallelujah praise god the protestant and the catholics amen see that's repeated today hallelujah also jesus says as it was in days of sodom homosexuality so shall be in the days of the coming of the son of man as it was the days of noah where violence filled the earth and every thought of the imagination of every heart was evil continually and god was going to destroy the earth that's uh that's repeating again today so the keystone of the bible is that god and his ways are unchanging so that should make it easy whatever day we're living in we should be able to look at the bible and we can look at josiah we can look at noah or we can look at enoch and say my how did they live to overcome amen and however they were living that's how we can live amen and so brother man took this thought and he said i'm applying this to the church ages praise god and then the the to go along with that uh the bible said if any man add unto these things god adds the plagues that are written in the book so that's revelation 22. anybody that adds to the word of god gets plagues added to them in the probably the next life right probably the next life at the white after the white throne judgment and anybody that takes away from the book of the words here in this book their part is taken out of the book of life praise god and so we see that we see have an au we have an unchanging god who changes not and we are told not to change the word but to let the word be preached in its purity and let the unchanging word orchestrate our lives in other words the unchanging word we should always obey it it should guide our lives we should glory we should be able to open up the bible any day of the week and find inspiration to guide our lives amen because it's unchanging hallelujah in other words we've always been uh in other words the people of god has always been the minority we've always been the mock group we've always been the made fun of group we've always been the persecuted group now it's gonna if we live long enough we're gonna see it come to a real serious point amen where they're gonna get to the spot where laws are gonna change to persecute real christians you kind of see it doing now in america they're raiding conservatives companies even this week they rated another uh company uh they rated uh conservative lawyers this year you know the fbi and so forth they're they're raiding the conservatives and you can already see how it slanted towards uh the liberals and and and the sin group is starting trying to take away uh rights and laws of the conservative group in other words the people that believe the humble truth the people that are strong striving for truth they're going to be the persecuted ones so we can see that but that's been the same in every day praise god so we shouldn't fear but we should have faith that god is faithful and he doesn't change if he protected the old saints if he protected the saints and your mother your father your grandparents he'll protect you amen and if god cares he'll protect our children or your grandchildren amen god will protect us because he's faithful and we know the keystone in the bible that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that he's faithful and whatever he allows to happen in our lives we can rejoice in him amen even through the pain we can rejoice in it because god is in control amen and he orders the footsteps of the righteous unless we learn with job and satan god can't do anything or satan can't do anything to us unless god allows it amen and so we see by comparing the church ages that the prophet of god saw he said god is unchanging his word is unchanging i just need to look through history and see which man was the closest to the pattern of apostle paul or we could say which man was closest to jesus christ hallelujah because that's where paul learned the gospel from i didn't learn it from a man i didn't learn it from an organization or a creed or dogma but my revelation i received it from jesus christ amen now that's the keystone i want to make sure i get to that that you saw the keystone scriptures of the bible god and his ways are unchanging he said i am the lord and i change not so god's always looking for a man or woman like the original believers praise god who can overcome all the gates of hell hallelujah now i want to um i want to just go through this again here now uh i showed this on wednesday i update a little bit just a little bit now i'm able to identify the the number of years so the first the so this is basically the last two thousand years i was going to show this to sabrina so this is the last two thousand years since jesus died and wrote resurrected till now there's been about seven church ages where god sent mighty men of god so the first one was paul right and then uh irenaeus and then martin and then columba and then martin luther john wesley and then god sent us brother branham uh here about 60 years ago right so and each and each day you can recognize and it just makes sense uh all throughout history god's people been on fire and then after a generation or two they fall away right so god's got to send another group or god's got to send another man praise god who'll be inspired of the holy spirit to stir the people up and get them back to god amen hallelujah but thank god we're promised at the end time when the mystery of god is finished we're promised that we can eat the book and we can finish the plan of god the gentile dispensation on fire amen not lukewarm and not cold but we can finish it hot amen hallelujah praise god in other words there's got to be an overcoming church praise god at the end time who can go in the rapture who can be like enoch and elijah amen who can uh be so obedient and like enoch means dedicated amen can be so dedicated to the things of god that they live a testimony where god can snatch them off the earth amen so we had paul's age now paul died early in the age right so did iranians died early in the age now i find that the messengers always come at the beginning of the age brother man has different quotes on that sometimes he says and sometimes he says beginning so you got to rightly divide it paul iranius martin became at the beginning columba uh martin luther john wesley and brother brahm come at the beginning usually that's what i found now i find the same thing in the old testament so the first age was solomon he was a messenger then jehoshaphat and then uzziah and then hezekiah and then josiah and then ezra and then john the baptist i'm going to try to prove this by the way by the grace of god amen i'm going to try to prove that how many heard wednesday's sermon okay all right so uh hopefully uh then hopefully this will kind of build on i just want to spend a little more time on these kings so you can see some traits in their lives that resemble the new testament church ages praise god and uh as church as you know you know we can no matter what the word is whether it's old testament new testament we can glean strength out of it we've come to zion to seek his strength amen hallelujah his strength flows out of zion and we've come to mount zion amen hallelujah remember the last month or so we preached on that four sermons or so we've come to the spiritual mount zion and that's where strength that's where praise should go up at zion that's where his power flows forth that's where his name is identified on mount zion amen in other words the name of jesus christ is here so his power is here as well so whatever we have a need of whatever strength we have need of we can receive it today because we know we're in his presence amen now so we see how and just notice a few things you know the longest age of the old testament was that ezra nehemiah remember uh right after this you know right after ezra nehemiah as her nehemiah and and then malachi there was no profit for almost 400 years so that was that was a silent age right until god raised up john the baptist amen and so this was a very silent age like kind of like a dark age as well so in other words our dark age was earlier their dark age was kind of later okay so you just kind of have to see some differences it's a shadow it's not the exact thing but it's a shadow of it now i still believe this the most clear messengers i can find that i can clearly see type the the new testament are these four solomon josiah ezra and elijah i see very strong correlations now the second third fourth i see some similarities but i don't see much obvious types and shadows as i do in those four so that that remains unchanged from what i preached on wednesday but i think you'll see it as we go through this uh these mighty men of god in our day and then these were the mighty men of god uh during the time of the old testament the last thousand years before john the baptist in christ amen okay so let me scroll down here i was gonna just skip ahead well i guess we can just start right there okay now put these in yellow just so i could study them a little bit better and i could see them a little better so the first church age messenger was paul who lived 61 years imagine that 61 years my parents have already lived 71. he wrote two-thirds of the new testament his message was jesus sees your labor and patience but he warns them you must return to your first love church i hope i can get to this by the holy spirit but i might as well just say it right now this week i got an email from a person doesn't go to our church but but he was basically asking me how do i return to my first love i took him back to where jesus said it jesus says remember where you've fallen repent and then return to doing your first works the three r's so i just thought it might be uh needful you know if it came across to me there and i find it when i'm studying i thought well there's two witnesses maybe someone in the church needs to return to your first love and uh that's what you see all it takes is remember how did i used to serve god do we get so busy and so distracted with life and all the the responsibilities the daily needs of life you know daily needs of our friends and family that sometimes we forget what we used to do how do we show our love and devotion to god at the beginning well thankfully jesus says remember repent and return amen a three simple step process remember what you used to be you know sometimes it's really helpful to go listen to an older sermon from our church or sometimes it's really helpful to go look at some of your old pictures amen when we first came in the message brother bang i see how we were shouting and rejoicing and we're all praising god i got pictures from our first rental where i got pictures of you and brother uh uh brother john and a lady and carrie and my wife and lisa everybody's got their eyes closed clapping and praising the lord and the hands are up and sometimes it does good to remember where we were amen and that we can check up and see are we still on that same course amen are we still serving god with the same joy the same fervence and the same victory amen those can be very helpful praise god to look back and remember what we used to be amen because jesus christ said even in the first church age they're going to fall and they're going to need a revival not in the soul but in the human mind amen and the spirit to remember how that used to live and then repent god i'm sorry i don't do that like i used to but i'm returning to it now amen like i had a good another good text this week too um i told you that brother i was mentoring you know he he uh he said now he says since you come and visit me one time he said uh he said my family's back in church now he said my daughter's memorized the 20 books of the bible and he said i got in the prayer closet numerous times this week and i said hallelujah that's what i'm talking about a revival amen i didn't hear you praise god i'm talking about your first love he said get he said he's getting back to that first love church that's how we got to do it sometimes you and i remember we said last sunday you and i will be the ones that will restore others in the spirit of meekness when we're spiritual and when we're mature hallelujah so if so i'm just telling you if if a brother that i'm mentoring can see that victory in his life well then you know you can get that victory in your life i need that victory in my life at times you need that victory in your life and time and the way back is repentance amen repentance and return to the first works hallelujah and you'll see god come back in your life amen just like this brother is too now this is one of the best types i can find out through these seven church ages solomon is a type of the first new testament age messenger i'm sorry old testament age messenger he reigned 40 years and then he wrote proverbs ecclesiastes song of solomon books of wisdom now his message that god told him when god met solomon the second time remember he met him twice the first time he said i'll give you whatever you ask he said give me judgment give me wisdom give me discernment after he finished the temple though seven years later god visited him again and god basically gave him a warning god gave him an if then kind of thing he said if you humble yourself and if my people call upon the lord then i'll hear them and i'll heal their land amen he said but if not if my people don't humble themselves and pray in the house of god then he said i'll pluck them out of the land and they'll be they won't have a king anymore in jerusalem and look what happens now look what's happened these two thousand years they don't have a king there right because they disobeyed and guess who was the ringleader of it solomon right he was the ringleader setting up those pagan temples and marrying a thousand wives you know he was the ringleader of the very man who started off he started off on fire but he left his first love but god's message was if you walk before me i'll establish your father's throne but if you turn away i'll pluck you out of the land that was the message sound very close sounds very close to me same idea now i want to show this as well in that first uh i kind of mentioned this briefly on wednesday night jesus's message to the ephesus church was very much echoed by paul here's what i mean jesus told ephesus i know your works well paul told us to be zealous of good works he said jesus said i see your labor your patience paul said uh well let's read it because i'm going to mess this one up i can't feel already i'm not going to remember that one romans 5 let's read that god is doing something in your life and he's building you church to be patient he's building all these through every trial of your life he's building a christ-like character look at verse three and not only so but we glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation works patience we all need more patience i'm not going to ask you to raise your hand we all need more patience how do you get patience trials tribulations but then tribulations make you more patient and then patience helps you have more experience and an experience gives you a hope of the resurrection amen gives you hope of eternal life amen this is god's four-step process to produce in you a confidence to know that you're saved to know that you have hope for the next life that you get to spend eternity with jesus amen tribulations patience that's the third one there experience and hope this is the four-step process so jesus says i see your patience in other words i see that you're letting me produce patience in your life so i'm giving you a hope and the hope was that they would eat from the tree of life hallelujah because that's the promise at the end of the letter to ephesus praise god and jesus said you cannot bear them that are evil you've tried them that say they're apostles and paul did this paul said prove all things and he said no we didn't give space one half hour to these people trying to bring legalism back into the message and are not and has found them liars and paul said those creations those jewish creations were always liars right and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted paul said we faint not throughout our tribulations i see paul paul says the same message that jesus gave to ephesus because paul was the messenger to that age nevertheless i have someone against me because thou hast left their first love remember paul said i'm so soon i've seen you removed from the gospel glory and then he says grieve not offend not the holy spirit wear by your seal to the day of your redemption but the idea is that holy ghost-filled christians can offend the holy spirit they can grieve the holy spirit so whether god do repent and say you're sorry and return and stop stealing that's what he talks about ephesians 4 stop stealing stop lying tell the truth be tender hearted towards all the believers amen stop being so hardhearted right don't fornicate don't lust don't do those things come back to maturity and then you'll please the holy spirit instead of grieving so we see the same message as ephesus he says remember when you've fallen repent and do the first works and paul said be renewed daily in the in your mind praise god be transformed by the renewing of your mind see in other words you can get back to your original strength you can get back to your original zeal praise god that's what i feel like when i go to those churches and we now we didn't visit one today but that's what i feel like i feel like i'm back to my first love in other words anybody that comes up to me i got a i got a witnessing for them i got a word for them i try to give it to the pastors mostly but i try to give them a word just an encouragement praise god i find that takes me back to my first love because i know i need to be a witness praise god and brother ram said if he said if you don't do one thing else he said get a soul saved right and he that win his souls is foolish no he that wins souls is why so that if you're a wise virgin you'll pray for souls to be saved and you'll try to reach out and try to win he said if you can just win one soul if you've got one soul in your heart this morning keep keep praying for that person keep having a burden for that person that's why you're here you're here to take more people who will come and go with me to the promised land amen i'm bound for the promised land who will come and go with me praise god see so you've got to find we have to all find how do we get back to our first works if we're in that condition now what's amazing is that jesus says if you don't do this i'll remove your candlestick unless you repent and that happened to both of these that happened to both in ephesus and also solomon's day god removed the candlestick didn't he but this thou has that which uh thou hatest the deeds of nicoletanes which i also hate okay so that was in my book those are the scriptures i use and it's in my book that was on page uh if you're at 4 24 or 4 26. now here's what i mentioned on wednesday too solomon started off with one wife my dove my undefiled is but one but then by the end of his life he had to tell a thousand wives that i love you that doesn't sound very sincere does it i love you honey you're number 999 but i'll see you tomorrow night i'm going over to number 1000 tonight remember like we saw with jacob remember jacob went from rachel to leah you know that's how they were but at the beginning salmon says i've just got one you're my dove you're my gentle tender sweet dove you're my uh you're my homing pigeon you're you're my lady right that's what doves are they're holding pigeons right they always come back he started off on fire but then he left his first love he even had all the wisdom he could have asked for he even he could have went back to his notes brother and sister he went back to his notes and said well this is how you love god proverbs but he he left that off for women right many strange the mouse and many strange wives turned his heart away from the lord now here's the revelation that came when i was preaching on wednesday night it's a small revelation but paul said according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i've laid the foundation another built it thereon let every man take heed how he built it thereon so paul was laying the foundation to the body of christ the temple of god that he was going to build up over a thousand years and here we are at the top of that pyramid temple amen there we are we're at the top of that pyramid temple paul laid the foundation song with wisdom and so did solomon solomon with with wisdom built the house of god they were both bible writers they were both wise men wise builders now i got this from a website solomon spared no expense for the building's creation he ordered vast quantities of cedarwood from king hiram had huge blocks of the choices stone cord and commanded that the building's foundation be laid with hewn stone to complete the massive project he imposed forced labor on all subjects drafting some for work shifts that sometimes lasted a month at a time i'm glad my work shift isn't a whole month at a time in other words i'll get a break after one month aren't you glad you don't live under solomon now he'd make you work 24 7. right give you a little break and you're there for a whole month and you finally got a month off and i had to last seven years brothers so i'm glad i'm grateful i'd live in this day right never get to see your family never get to see your kids grandkids he said there were 3 300 officials to oversee the temple's building solomon assumed such heavy debts in building that he's forced to pay off the king hiram by handing over 20 towns so he lost some of the possessions isn't that something he had to lose the possessions or some of the cities they possessed the gates they possessed he had to lose some of that in order to build up his temple which should only be holy for a couple of years let's say 20 years 30 years and then he's the one that made it unholy he defiled the own temple of god so he lost some of the blessings to gain the building but then when he had the building he lost the the significance of it he lost the love for the house of god and started building buildings unto the devil can you imagine that building the things that you once destroyed now here's another the last beautiful type paul said by the grace of god i am what i am his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they are not i but the grace of god which was given to me praise god no one labored more than solomon right to build the house no one labored more just like paul no one labored more than paul that first church age messenger he sacrificed everything he said i can even recognize god was with me in such a way where i labored more in my short life than these brothers that live longer what does that grace let me say like this when you really appreciate god's grace you're able to serve god more than others when others might get weaker or stronger or discouraged right or sad or depressed for some reason because you love god's grace you're able to serve god with more fervency amen because god reminds you of his grace he reminds you of what he's done for you praise god and you and i are able to labor more praise god because we appreciate grace we remember where we come from praise god because we know that we that were forgiven much love much amen how could paul a man in the jewish faith labor more than peter but he could because the grace of god he always kept god's grace near him he always remembered god's grace so i can see ephesus and solomon as a beautiful it's like a great type both men were master builders one natural one spiritual of course the salmon i guess did too with the bible both men wrote the inspired word of god both ages were were warned to return to their first love and notice both ages had the candlestick removed from cities or from the nation it's a beautiful type now here's where we'll off get a little off there's three in a row that i just i had a hard time finding real good types now irenaeus he lived from 130 to 202 he had all the gifts of the spirit throughout all his churches in france now we're still laboring to get all of them here praise god and we're believing i'm not putting pressure on the people but i'm just urging the people let's keep praying let's find the position of god for your life and then you'll find your gifts amen praise god and that's something we need to grow into remember god is restoring the faith of the fathers that's why i often teach on that that's why i keep going back to joshua and your purpose and the gifts of the holy spirit because ultimately you have to answer you and i have to stand before jesus and he's going to say what did you do with the gifts that i gave you what'd you do with the talent so you could say lord here's what i did with them i knew what i was called to do i invested here here's what i did and we want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant how many want to hear him say that that's why it's good every now and then like maybe maybe for me every six months or so i like to go back to these gifts and i like to go back to this idea of you and i having to know our gifts and we should invest in our talents in order that we can see jesus and we'll have confidence on that day we won't be worried on that day we won't fret that day but we'll be happy looking for that day amen i'll be happy i know what he gave me i've invested in it by god's grace i did it the lord here's all the crowns for your head amen here's all the jewels for your crown amen now irenas also resisted idolatry of the false roman bishops in the first church of rome and he had the true godhead teaching now the message to smyrna was god knows your works be faithful unto death so this was the age of increased persecution now in the old testament josh jehoshaphat he reigned 25 years now his life started and ended well he just had one mishap in the middle when he compromised with ahab now church if we just have one mishap in our lives hallelujah that's why david always encourages us right because the bible said he did everything right just that one thing with your eye and bathsheba everything else was great in other words everything else was just minor little things under the blood of the lamb hallelujah but that's just that one area well same thing with jehoshaphat he had a wonderful life but he just compromised one time with ahab which brotherham said was that protestant a protestant make believer because he married the catholic i doubt or jezebel so what was his message his message was peace prosperity and he also had supernatural deliverance through the gift of prophecy through the removal of idolatry and seeking the lord i know it's a lot in there it's kind of jumbled maybe that's not the best sentence i could have wrote so forgive me now jesus message to smyrna was i know your works your tribulation poverty and but he says be faithful unto death the lord says fear not those things which thou shalt suffer it included a 10-day period of tribulation now the false vine became the literal synagogue of satan this age in other words the first church of rome right they became not the spiritual but the literal the physical church of satan this was the age with increased persecutions and the awful ten thousand year person i'm sorry ten year persecution by diocletian that awful roman emperor amen remember church many of the saints had to flee for their lives during that time they had to leave rome and thank god they did praise god see sometimes god's not calling us to suffer sometimes god's calling us to escape and take the gospel somewhere else amen sometimes god's calling us to run flee flee all appearances of evil praise god sometimes god will call people to give their lives other times god will cause people to save their lives and spread the gospel now let's look at jehoshaphat just for a few moments here just a brief few moments let's remember this good old saint here because he was quite a messenger he was known to seek the lord with all his heart now how many how many people could god say could god say that about in our church or our city where god could say you sought me with all your heart that's pretty humbling isn't it that's with that yet that's what the bible says about jehoshaphat the kingdom of judah was never more look at this never more peaceful or prosperous than under his reign because with the cities have store houses all the cities had city-side storehouses he was such a godly man now church doesn't encourage you if you want all the needs of your life just see god with all your heart if you want god to take care of all these little things i don't have to worry about the money and the food and the house i'm just going to see god with all my heart amen hallelujah i'm not going to get distracted with the little things i'm going to make seeking god my top priority and then god will bless you if you do that seek ye first the kingdom of god but his mate so he started off wonderful i think there was a couple of kings after uh sodom i'm not mistaken there's four or five maybe three or four but then he brought he brought a great uh revival to israel but his major mistake was uniting with ray with ahab to go against ramos gilead this brought disgrace upon jehoshaphat and disaster to his kingdom like they lost some of their previous blessing and then now the beautiful thing let's read this let's go to second chronicles 19. let's go down in your bibles because i don't have it up here i just want to encourage you with this church it's you know it's real my life i i know it's real in your life too you know we sing that little sunday school song just a little talk with jesus makes it right that's true but there's sometimes it's got to be a little bit longer talk with jesus to make it all right you understand what i'm saying not just a simple little prayer i'm talking about like a half hour prayer hour prayer spending a few hours studying your bible reading the bible and pray right that's what these men of god teach us if we're far from god we've got to draw close to god amen so jehoshaphat makes this awful mistake so god sends a prophet to him amen god sent a prophet to us amen to correct us from our mistakes and denominations amen and to bring us out of that and to teach us how to seek the lord so it's uh 19 11. look at verse two and jehu the son of hananiah the seer went out to meet him and said to king joseph shouldst thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore his wrath upon thee from before the lord nevertheless there are good things found in thee and that thou has taken away the groves out of the land and has prepared thine heart to seek god isn't that so kind of god even when you're wrong god says look this you're wrong here but you've done some good things you got some good you got some good motives in your heart brother sisters you've got some good motives in your heart but you're just wrong on that one you're wrong on that you're going to pay for that but i found good things in your heart as well now look how he responds this is what i want you to catch look how he responds to this word of the lord in verse uh verse 4 at the end he says he brought the people back to the lord god of their fathers so after he gets rebuked he brings people back to the lord where he needs to be in verse five he sets judges in the land and then in verse six he says judge not for man but for the lord who's with you in judgment amen in other words he says let's get serious with god let's start playing let's stop playing games with god let's get some judgment over our lives let's get things settled right let's have peace and mercy and let's have uh let's have obedience reign let's have holiness reign over the people's lives verse seven wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do in other words go do your first works hallelujah praise god all right now i think in the parallel passage well let's go down to verse 11 at the end of verse 11 he says deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good the lord shall be with the good actually actually yeah there it is i'm sorry i go to the next uh chapter verse three and joseph feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaim the fast throughout all judah okay so in other words church if we get rebuked and we fall away the simple way back is just repentance right just seek god spend some time just skip a meal how hard is that skip one meal and just read your bible the whole time right you don't have to be science fiction or something like that or something impossible just stop don't eat and just go pray and read your bible in the closet or something like that go get alone with god and god will honor that god sees that amen what's done in secret god sees it and then he rewards you openly now he was delivered and then these two nations come against him that i believe it's the moabites and the ammonites yeah in this chapter you remember this is this is where phil wickham wrote that song the battle belongs he got that song from this chapter because they were fighting on their knees right and they the the the prophet said uh jehoshaphat tell them to sing praise unto god and as soon as the praises started coming out god's in an ambush and the angel lord to slay all those hundreds of thousands of men out there while they were worshiping hallelujah so they'll see the battle belongs to god amen sing to the lord praise but you got to fast too you gotta you know see you gotta do these other things too you gotta show your sincerity and then god will fight your battles amen just admit i made a mistake i should not have joined with that group i should have not joined that person i should not have went to their house i should not have laughed at their jokes i should not have done i should not have done this financial deal with them right i should not have done that forgive me lord but now i'm seeking your face amen i won't be influenced by the ahab and jezebel around these heirs i'll be influenced by the holy spirit amen so jehoshaphat this was life or death so what do you do what did he do in a life or death situation he went to the church amen he went to the church he fasted and prayed and sang the songs he heard the voice of the prophet amen he went when his when his life was online he drew closer to god and no wonder the bible said his heart was after the heart of god too amen oh it's a beautiful story beginning's beautiful ends beautiful just one trial in between now what's interesting is ahab and jezebel married in this age but we know it was actually in the third old testament church age so i'm not going to major on that just just so you know now here we see some similarities between uh uh iranians and uh jehoshaphat both men have the gifts of the spirit operating we can see that and both men sought the lord and condemned idolatry so now i see i do not see many major signs like solomon the first love i can see that plainly but um i'll keep an open heart you know maybe there's other things there maybe jehoshaphat's not the messenger you know but i can't i can't see as good of a type as i can with solomon and paul okay just so you know now third age martin i know somebody's thinking i gotta get through seven church ages probably just give me a few minutes here let me see if i can get through this martin lived 315 to 399. he built schools and chapels for prayer he sent forth many preachers he had a miracle-filled life and he defied the first church of rome his message was saints hold fast jesus name and faith while you battle the doctrine of the nicolaitans and balaamism now the one that the closest one i can find is usia church look at this he saw god he had the longest rule of any of the good kings in other words church his rule lasted longer than david his rule lasted longer than solomon it lasted almost twice as long as jehoshaphat almost so there's something special about this man now the end of his life was horrible he had a horrible ending right just like solomon but he lived so many years so dedicated to god that we should learn something from this amen he was a vigorous wise ruler because but at the end he tried to insert himself he tried to make himself to something that he wasn't and church that's what you find have you seen it as people get older if they're not led by the holy spirit they just get more stubborn you got any older parents grandparents or anything any older aunts or uncles if they don't have the holy spirit you can't teach them anything new anymore they get so set in their ways they won't budge so i'm glad we got older saints here that are led by the holy spirit that can learn new things amen that are examples for us amen beatrice and brother william examples to us hallelujah brother jose where you can learn you can grow you don't get set in your ways and you don't get set in your sins amen but you get set and anchored in the word of god hallelujah amen as you get older you don't get more negative you get more kind like jose today gave you a holy kiss did you see that buddy he gave up jose gave he meant a holy kiss on the side of his head i like that sometimes i'll kiss some of you brothers on the on the neck too if not better get ready i'm going to kiss you on the neck i've gone when i go to cam church there's that one brother he always almost always kisses me on the neck every time he sees me the bible says greet one another with a holy kiss that's that's not a law but when you're so full of god's love how can you not kiss somebody well i'm just going to say that i'll stop right there be careful though right remember you want to make sure you're kissing the right place amen right you want to be holy you want to be sober not just throwing your lips all over the place you want to be sober but see this is what uzziah had he had a testimony that pleased god and his message was you'll get great prosperity and he almost reached the point of jehoshaphat the bible said through doing the right thing and seeking god now in the pergaming age of the new testament jesus saw their works their dwelling place now the third church age was awful for the false vine as far as the awful things they did church look at this uh the false vine feasted for 10 months at the council of nicaea but said that was the doctrine of balaam because balaam united israel and and moabites right at their feast 24 000 died that repeated under constantine at the council of nicaea it was an unholy feast right uniting church and state satan took his third and final seat in rome remember it was iraq right or shinar and then it was pergamos and then it was rome his three seats satan's three seats the doctrine of nicolaitans empowered the clergy to use the state to kill christians for the first time with help from saint that he wasn't a real saint saint augustine this first pope rose during this age damascus was the first pope and it happened during the third church age by fa now listen this by 500 years after christ the bible was only in one language latin 100 years before that it was in 500 languages so see what they see what the catholic church did they cut off all the bibles and they destroyed and burnt all the bibles so they could control the bible they could control the bible and the language rather than allowing holy ghost-filled men to copy it translate it in other words get the message to every people nation tongue kindred and tribe amen satan tries to limit it where you got to come my way god said get it out make translations copy it go share the word amen go into all the world and preach the gospel with every creature these signs shall follow them that believe amen satan does the opposite he wants to control all the just one language he wants to limit the number of bibles available now here look at uzziah he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to his father amaziah he sought god in the days of zechariah who had an understanding in the vision of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him prosper see he lived a godly life and reigned the longest of the godly kings now isn't this interesting the worst king reigned the longest which was manasseh the worst king reigned the longest that's just like the dark ages yeah right the longest age was the darkest age right the romantic church lived all that long because god was doing something god knew the church had to die amen he knew he had they had to rot but then he'd bring forth a shoot praise god he bring forth a luther in other words irish restore saith the lord amen amen amen that's what he did he restored through luther but it's interesting god allows this long dark age to go forth that was manasseh but uzziah always sought the lord for the first let's let's say 50 years of his life because he only got off at the very end of his life let's say 51 i mean you could say whatever you want i couldn't find it in history but so 50 think of that 50 years of solid worship think of that how long has your pastor been pastored now brother uh back there in ghana the one who shared the message pastor tag so it's over 50 years over 50 years imagine uh what a reward that man has 50 years now here let me bring this down to brother amen amen imagine leading songs 50 years he you know your pastor bastard 50 years in other words imagine being faithful to your ministry for 50 years don't you think god would have a great reward for that absolutely now now now let's go back to uzziah did that for 50 some years but just at the very end he's like i want to go into the holy place i want to go in there god's prospered me so much i can go in there and he made this awful mistake but the bible says great things about him he built towers in the desert he dug many wells he gave the people water he gave them much cattle the bible says he made vines and and orchards he loved the husbandry he loved the earth bringing forth he made engines and invented invented by cunning men he made them strong he gave them towers and bulwarks and arrows and great stones and his name spread far abroad he was marvelously helped till he was strong in other words god just made him stronger as the years got went by he got stronger and stronger and made the people stronger and stronger and healthier that's what's happening here praise god amen you and i are getting stronger amen hopefully healthier and more healthy natural but mostly spiritual praise god i know i might stop drinking pop amen but you know we need to get stronger physically but also spiritually that's the most important thing amen hallelujah and he did that for 50 years but at the end he kind of got this wrong spirit where i can be something i'm not and he had thankfully he had brothers trying to warn him right he had all those priests no you don't no don't don't stop stop but he wouldn't listen so he stopped you see zechariah died and he stopped having those visions from the prophet that's what happened he had to live the end of his life without the prophet zechariah so i can see some similarities both ages had declined right because martin was a trinitarian but he had tremendous miracles the bible said tremendous america he's the one that taught st patrick and patrick tore up ireland for the gospel he filled the whole uh nation island with the gospel of jesus christ but he was a trinitarian uzziah didn't reach the peace and prosperity joseph both men were builders martin built schools and usaid built engines and towers both men were famous for their good deeds the name of martin went around around the whole world during that time he was such a mighty man of god and so it is like uzi we saw that the bible said his name was known abroad now i don't see any other major similarities so i only see minor similarities that one's a little bit of a question to me fourth church age columba 1521-1596 now he was a powerful missionary like and history says the only one they could compare him to were jesus's apostles for all the miracles like peter when he said rise up and walk right the gate beautiful the only ones they compare columba to were jesus apostles because they were so mighty he was so mighty in miracles he preserved the written word making reformation possible his college sustained evangelism for 700 years now look at the church in his college his college was west of rome rome had so polluted everything that they'd shut they shut down all the churches and the bible's right it was all roman catholic but god had a little place over here amen columba had a little place over here where all the missionary work was done outside and around rome but not in rome god in other words god was sparing his little flock outside that major center of catholicism god always has a little remnant who stays true to the word they might not be at the center of it but god's going to protect his little bride and give her a little place in the wilderness where she can prosper amen see god can do it despite our ideas someone might have thought well you need to be in rome fighting against no god said it's okay i'm gonna have columba he's gonna be all safe out there he's gonna be protected he's gonna send all these preachers all outside of the roman empire because they don't want it in rome but they're gonna keep the gospel alive for 700 years of dark ages those in rome would go through the dark ages oh but there was a lie there was light in goshen amen there was a light in shiloh hallelujah where the holy ghost was with columba and his saints amen hallelujah church just because people are dark in your family just because their darkness around your friends and your family and your workplace just know that you have the light amen just accept it and say today i'm walking in the light amen amen let them walk in darkness but god has a special place provided me in the light of the hour amen i didn't hear you praise god thank god i do i see that all the time when i'm at school and this might seem small to you but every time i walk down the hallway there's kids you know different going to different classes all the teachers walk by and none of the kids wave at any other other teachers they just wave at me i walk down the hallway they'll be like hey mr smith hey mr smith they want to you know bump elbows give me high fives because everybody else has a frown on their face no i don't know their hearts but i know i show them the love of jesus christ and i've had new teachers move in they say why are you so popular mr smith i said i don't know it's just the love of god i guess because i told him i said i try to treat those kids like they're my own i try to be kind to them and sweet so i can see how if you love people if you show the love of god people will love you and the light of god will rest upon you amen but you got to show the love of god you can't clam yourself up and be all mad and angry and bitter and all these things you got to just cast those down you got to choose to walk in the lord amen as he's in the light amen you've got to choose to be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden amen amen let them see let the men see your good works and glorify the father which is in heaven amen seen in my life like i said i see it at work all the time there's so many testimonies but just just such as it's a basic one there you had a new teacher moving this year she said you're like a celebrity here i said i'm not a celebrity but the kid they just church i'm just saying they just know that i love them like the buses are driving let me give you the buses will come in i'll be going out and all the kids will be out the window waving bye mr smith hey bye see you tomorrow and they're like how are you so even the parents said it already this year why are you so popular it's just the love of god well i'm really strict on them you should come in my class i'm strict on them they lose recess you know but it's the love of god what i'm saying is show the love of god praise god amen let the light of god walk in the light as he's in the light amen that's kind of a side note so in this age jesus knew their works charity service faith and patience the last were more than the first now a type a type of this was hezekiah i can partially see it he reigned 29 years he did a great reformation this is the guy i love because he started as a king when he's 25 i started preaching at 25 or a pastor rather at 25. he restored the altar of the temple and worship after wicked ahaz that was his dead he destroyed that brass serpent those old moses worshipers there were some moses there are some prophet worshipers around when he was around but he made sure we destroy this brass serpent that everybody's idolizing i like that don't you church that's what we try to do we try to cast on all those brother man and worship in spirits right hallelujah they're trying to worship him and magnify him and all these things we have to destroy that praise god we have to make sure only one person only one prophet gets worshipped and that's our lord jesus christ god's saying that about you reminds me of jabez he said lord let me be more honorable than my brethren amen not that he had a competitive spirit but he wanted to see god expand his influence he wanted to see the glory of god move through him in a greater way praise god and he knew we have to earn rewards we he knew rewards are there for us and he knew i don't want to be a lazy worker i want to be a fruitful worker amen i want to bless the father's business the kingdom business i want to bless this gospel of jesus christ that has changed my life amen hallelujah nothing wrong with that so there was no kings like him in judah before or after now it's interesting i didn't have it up here but josiah they say something very similar about josiah so i don't have the revelation on that yet but i'm just going to look at hezekiah so outside of david and solomon who were united in one kingdom scripture says hezekiah stood out from all of them that includes 19 others can you imagine god lining up 19 people or 20 people he said let he said i'm going to call the one who served me best up front and god said bang bang steps and all 19 stay back there that that that's what god does god's going to exalt he says some are going to sit by my right hand somebody sit by my left hand it's equal opportunity everybody has a chance to fast everybody has a chance to pray everybody has a chance to witness everybody has a chance to give alms hallelujah everybody has a chance to be a blessing and say lord use me today uh show fruit in my life let me be faithful with what you've given to me because i know that he that's faithful and little will be blessed and much hallelujah everybody's got the fair chance so god says hezekiah trust in god more than jehoshaphat uzziah and josiah but there's a question mark after josiah isn't that something that's why church i don't mind anymore i used to get sad if nobody invited me to preach i used to get sad like well did i do something wrong but now i just rejoice in it i know god's in control and i know i don't look at it it's not a competition but i realize i've got to answer for my church just like those other brothers got to answer for their church and i'm going to devote myself to this church and to the word the bible said you must labor in the word and then if you labor in the word and doctrine you get double honor amen and that's not honor for men that's honor from the holy ghost amen because men aren't going to honor you for being more on the word they're going to despise you or be jealous or they'll speak evil maybe one or two will be a blessed but that means god is going to give you heavenly honor praise god and that's waiting for you and they're at the merit supper of the lamb hallelujah god oh god honors all those who are faithful to his name that's why church we just got to be focused laser focused on our ministry lord i'm going to be faithful i'm going to be faithful i'm devote all i have to you lord and then lord if there's anything else you want me to do just show me i'll be faithful to it i can't do everything but i can do the main things this was his prayer he died later than he should have now that's that's probably what most of us want brother and son i want to be late for my funeral he said i was waiting he said i was late for my wedding he said i was late for all these i was born late i was after my mom's due date he said i'm usually late to church he said i just want one more thing i want to be late for that's my funeral but but hezekiah prayed for this he said lord give me more time and god gave him 15 years why because of his walk because of his dedication god gave him what he wanted just because of all those years he reigned 29 years so let's subtract it's just came to me now what's 29 minus 15 14 14 brother all he did was serve god faithfully for 14 years and then he's going to die say god i want more time god said okay you got 15 more he gave him more than what he had that's beautiful i've never seen that before till now god doubled his time hey lord double my time amen but let me be faithful with that time amen let me be totally devoted and focused and not leave my first love let me always seek your face and glorify jesus that was his his motive and objective with god was lord i you know i've served you with a pure heart so please ex expand my days and god did because god said i haven't seen any king seek trust in me like you have remember he's the one he got into he got into office the first thing he did was go uh put the the the gate of the temple back on the door had fallen off can you imagine all the animals that got in there all the you know the droppings and can you imagine this is a holy place the first thing he did was put a gate on there they said go restore the gate he said go restore the temple the tab go clean it out and they did it in such a quick time that they couldn't even keep up they announced it to the people they brought in all these sacrifices the priests couldn't keep up so they said let's hire some of those other levites here to come in and help us out it was a short quick work it was revival and church that's what we have to live live in revival amen clean up our lives amen get back to the things of god trust in god with all of our hearts amen live with the perfect heart before god and then maybe when you need it then maybe god will give you desire your heart but show first show first a perfect heart for years for 14 years we just passed 14 we're 15 hours of church amen how lord you uh trust you've seen my perfect heart these 15 years i've not been in this for money i've not been in this for popular for popularity i've not been in this for women like those three uh preachers temptations i've not been in it for any of that i've been in it to try to win souls amen i've been in to be devoted to the word of god and to finish the great commission i've been in to feed your families the word of god amen hallelujah that's why i've been in and keep myself also in the word of god as well like i said last week let me know how i can serve you better praise god if there's something i'm not doing right let me know so god gave him his permissive will just because of his perfect heart but god said would have been better if you died after 14 years but since i love you since you've been so faithful to me i'll let you live 15 more so that was his prayer he was sick unto death yeah and he prayed to the lord the lord gave him a sign hezekiah look here's here's his fault he didn't render again according to the benefit done unto him in other words god blessed him but he didn't really respond the right way to god's blessing he was more selfish for look his heart was left he got prideful god gave him 15 years instead of saying lord thank you god he said look at me god gave me 15 years look how great a king i am he got prideful after the the miracle instead of humble that's what we need to be we need to be humble after god does something right and then we'll keep the blessing we'll keep the anointing and the blessing on our lives therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem because he got prideful notwithstanding his guy humbled himself for the pride of his heart so he at the end he repented both he and the heavens and jerusalem so that the wrath lord came not on them in the days of hezekiah okay so he squandered the 15 extra years that god gave to set his house in order so i see some similarities but again i don't see major ones i just see minor both men were known as got the some of the most godly men colombia because compared to jesus disciples hezekiah was honored above all the kings outside david and solomon i see i see a few similarities there okay now this one is unmistakable this is just beautiful uh i was really excited on wednesday night martin luther was the first church at fifth church age messenger he brought the church out of the dark ages and he made the scripture in the people's language this was typed by josiah josiah reigned 31 years memory started ruling at 8 years old okay so that means let's see 39 he died at 39 wow my goodness and that's sad my goodness but he cleansed the temple and he brought israel out of manasseh and ammon's dark ages by literally finding the scrolls and he restored the feasts so i read this on wednesday this is kind of the story uh he started reigning at eight but then eight years later he finally started purging the idols out of the land and then when he started repairing the house of god he found the law of moses he had it read to him he weeps and cries and rents his clothes he calls the prophetess the woman prophetess and the sister said amen see god can use a woman as a prophetess not to lead the people but to edify the people god only leads the people with men right but god can inspire and edify through the sisters absolutely hold us fake by god that josiah's tender and humble heart was seen by god and he would not see the evil and wrath of god in his lifetime now here's the scripture now church look let me just jump ahead if i can manasseh manasseh was two kings before josiah look what this guy did he brought in abominations idolatry he sacrificed his own children he brought sun moon planet star worship back and back into judaism and he also prayed to the dead so josiah was raised up in a generation where the last two kings had prayed to dead people and there's abortions right and murder there's murder everywhere he rose up in that time and these evil men had done even worse they locked up the word of god in some of their dark castles and closets but when josiah was 16 he said i'm going to clean out the house of god i'm going to go through those dark areas i'm going to shine some light in those areas amen let's see what blessings are hiding in the dark amen hallelujah praise god and what did he find he found the book of the law and hilkiah gave it to him and he wrote it to josiah he runs his clothes he he humbles his heart he tears he has a tender heart tears and he says we need to make a in other words the people never heard the word like this before it had been hidden in the dark for two two generations but he said let's restore our covenant let's renew our faith and let's say god we're going to keep all these words with all of our heart now you're going to get revival when you start talking like that i'm going to serve you with my first love i'm going to keep all the message all the promises of god i'm going to keep all the word of god with a perfect heart now god's going to come back the king commanded all the people keep the passover now look he keeps the passover and there was not a passover like his think about this since the days of joshua because in the days of the judges the bible said in all the kings nobody had kept the passover like josiah nobody had killed nobody had inspected the lamb nobody inspected the lamb for 14 days right like josiah did nobody had slain the lamb there and applied the blood like josiah did amen hallelujah nobody made bitter bread unleavened bread nobody had purged hallelujah the leaven out of their kitchens nobody had swept and cleaned out better than than josiah since the days of joshua hallelujah 800 years earlier in other words their passover was the greatest in almost a millennium through the dark ages where there was not a real good passover celebration josiah brought it back and he could say we're having worship like the days of joshua oh hallelujah and what does pastor represent justification justification signification baptism holy ghost right passover justification sanctification take all the leaven away jesus went down to hell resurrection amen resurrection on the third day the baptism of the holy ghost and type amen i already looked at manasseh he was wicked above all so josiah had to undo all the wickedness that the worst king who lived for 55 years had brought in the back into the church now i see a lot of similarities both men majored on justification or the passover right martin luther what was his main message justification by faith both men brought their generations out of spiritual darkness through the revelations of the written word and both men reform the true church hallelujah amen in other words martin luther gave them a bible brother amen they didn't have a bible martin luther made it possible now you can know the word of god before you did it but now you can know it no i knew that back buddy thank you if you can have it if you need it right but before nobody even had one and he found it in darkness and made copies and he gave it out to the people now they have the light of god's word amen he brought them out of darkness amen and he's let them walk in the light of the day praise god that's a beautiful type of martin luther it's exactly what martin luther did i'm trying to i'm trying to go a little faster wesley 1703 1791 he had an open door in sanctification open-air preaching revolutionized the age oh yeah this one i want to read out of my i have some history i found in my book here he was typed by ezra ezra had an open door for the jews to return to israel through a heathen king and zerubbabel's generation he opened air preach at a pulpit and then the wall was built by anointing upon that man hallelujah it was god's anointing for that hour it was god's open door praise god i'm giving you an open door you don't have to break the laws now the laws are behind you amen there was the age of open door for ezra and zerubbabel and nehemiah nehemiah was one crying and the king looks and said why you cried he said my people don't have a wall he said go up i'm giving you permission to go build it golden go there now an open door age amen the three heath and kings in a row right for his rooma esther nehemiah three heathen kings in a row open up those doors what god opens no man can close that's how it is in your life if god opens the door for you no man can close it praise god he was a ready scribe he knew the word he had a prepared heart the bible said to seek the lord and to do it and teach israel statutes and judgments he's present at the first mention of a pulpit i like that every time i see that every time i see this pulpit i think of ezra amen ezra got this out he said let's build a pulpit amen to preach the word of god to god's people amen and it was a religious awakening go to uh as you go to nehemiah 10 28 let me just show you a few things that he did nehemiah 10 28. it's right before job in psalms nehemiah i know i'm keeping you alone here i'm trying to oh my okay yeah i gotta close here maybe i'll close after this one maybe i'll preach one more here i thought maybe i'd get one or two sermons out of here just because it's a little bit smaller context here but uh have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed us okay good i love looking back at these old kings because the bible said i'm a king hallelujah praise god you're a king you sisters are queens unto god we're kings and priests and if a king how can a king learn anything he's got to look and see what the previous kings did amen or he's got to look to the king of kings and that's who we got today we got the king of kings i'm gonna try to preach two hours here so sorry uh uh nehemiah 10 28 i'm just so yeah these just heavenly places like brother tam said i'm still in heavenly places 10 28. and the rest of the people the priests the levites the porters of singers and netherlands and all they that separate themselves from the people of the lands unto the the law of god their wives their sons their daughters everyone having knowledge and having understanding they claim to their brethren their nobles and enter into a curse and into an oath to walk in god's law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe to do all that the commandments of the lord our god and his judgments and the statutes and that he would not give our daughters unto the people of the land nor take their daughters for our sons so ezra had such a ministry that all the people came up and swore i said i give my oath i give my word i'm not going to compromise with all the heathen. i'm not gonna let my sons marry heathen girls i'm gonna i'm not gonna let my daughters marry heathen boys right and we are gonna separate ourselves we're gonna physically and spiritually separate ourselves from worldly people now that's a revival when you separate yourself unto god that's called sanctification that's what the word means sanctification set aside amen and so ezra's just preaching of the word causes these people to change their whole lives and say we're going to be different than our fathers we're going to be different than our previous generations we're going to be live separate unto god and we're going to obey all the word of god now look church they were even brave enough to say if i obey i'm blessed but if i don't i'll be cursed think about how brave that is they were sincere they were courageous how much okay yeah let me read this and then i'll just stop after this one uh page 462. i'm just reading history about john wesley 462. i didn't have time to get on there okay john wesley george whitfield oh introduce him to open air preaching and god bless his efforts with amazing supernatural results as tens of thousands at a time attended his services one two three four five six seven eight nine we have about 20 people here in those days though george whitefield said you go out stop preaching the churches he said the churches are dead he said go preach out there and they would have a few trickle in and pretty soon after a while waves of people started coming in waves because these people had never heard a preacher like john wesley he's the one that said he said live and burn for jesus in such a way that everybody comes to check out and see what the smoke's all about i've been touched by a fire amen so let the world come and watch me burn amen they kicked the fire out of the anglican church so john wesley said fine i'll just preach out there and it caused a great revival thousands came to church out there by the animals in the fields and they all got to hear the pure word of god the gifts of the holy ghost abounded in his life the believers shook under the holy ghost they fell to the ground as dead they wept shouted as they were healed and delivered from demons the dumb spoke and insane made sane and the dead raised the life under john wesley hallelujah he traveled 4 000 miles a year so he became a road warrior johnny was telling me how many miles he put on his car since he started coming here there's a lot of miles amen but he traveled 4 000 miles a year and over 40 000 preached over 40 000 sermons in his life at 88 years old he felt no infirmities of old age but then when he died he said the best of all god is with us the best of all god is with us let's stand both men preached or read the word in open air format i can see a beautiful type here both men brought sanctification musicians can come back to the people both men were thoroughly trained and prepared for their ministries you know john john wesley's dad was a preacher did you know that yeah and his mom taught him all these bible studies his mom's bible studies were so popular when his dad was out preaching that hundreds a hundred people would cram into his mom's home just to hear his mom read over his uh her husband's sermon notes they just love to hear the word of god church we got to get the word of god in our homes more praise god but he was trained from a child until he had this experience and then he was on fire ever since then both men had an open door ministry with little resistance from the enemy and the government now let me just say this as i close here i didn't have time to go through this but church each one of our lives is a story the bible says white throne judgment the books are going to be open and the book of life and you and i are going to be of course we'll be on the judgment but you and i all of our works will be recorded in the book there i was looking at uzi's life he only had about a page and a half in the bible to sum up his life what is god going to sum up about you for your life god could sum up that this man was faithful he built engines he built cities he had storehouses and just one time he turned away what is god's testimony going to say of you and i as we close say let's think about that the beautiful part is we still have the rest of today and the rest of our lives to make the story what it ought to be to let the author of our story let his will for our story be played out there's three things i want to bring out brother brown's life real quick at the beginning of his ministry his mother-in-law said don't go with those pentecostals and what happened he listened to her but then tragedy struck his home because of that his story's going to include that a second thing was in 1962 a brother named brother pope we have to look it up i can show it to you brother pope said you come join our organization he said we'll give you 500 a week which was five times the amount of money he was making he was only making a hundred dollars a week he said oh what have i got to do to join that he said oh just get rid of your water baptism and just you know get rid of that initial evidence thing and just get just get rid of that women no women preachers thing and brother man said i'm surprised that you would honor me and call me a man of god and ask me to compromise on the things that are more dear to me than life itself see church what's more dear to us popularity with friends money or the word of god the word the truth of god's word that tongues are not the evidence women should not preach water baptism should not be sprinkled it's immersed in the name of the lord jesus christ but that's an enemy that our prophet overcame amen how did you praise god and his story we'll have that in it praise god we could say the ambassadors from babylon came to look and deceive him but he overcame by the word of god i'll stop right there i could do another one let's bow our heads for a moment church think of the story of your life for one minute here think of the story your life where you're at how would god sum it up would god sum it up as our brother our sister trust the lord with all their heart and they lived such godly lives so they were more godly than all others before or after that's a that's a tough that's a tough standard to live to but let me say this it can be done amen because all things are possible to them that believe just for a moment let's bow our heads here you've been very patient with me thank you two weeks in a row this was an hour and 40 minutes thank you church i know you love me i love you too i hope you were helped this morning by the word of god they went like this to me i can't i can't believe it's been an hour church friends brothers sisters if we need to go back to our first love let me rehearse it last time remember what you used to do say you're sorry by repenting and then return to doing what you see i'm not going to ask anybody to raise their hands but if that's your desire i'm going to pray that the whole church also [Music] let me pray for you and you pray for me and pray for one another that will serve god with a perfect heart and we'll trust god with a perfect heart and that god can bless and prosper our natural lives and our spiritual lives [Music] let's pray heavenly father in jesus christ's name my eyes are closed my hands are lifted to heaven hallelujah thank you god for the word of god today we see the shadow of solomon's life and we don't want to leave our first love on god we see the potential that he fell short of but we see the victories in other men's lives like brother branham like saint paul like saint john hallelujah like martin luther and john wesley jehoshaphat was able to get revival back to his life amen after mistakes oh god [Music] hallelujah [Music] so lord look upon us here today in our humility we humble ourselves we ask you to forgive us of our sins but first i pray for the people that need a first love experience amen hallelujah may they remember repent and return to the first words i pray for them in the holy name of jesus christ grant them lord that little time they need as hezekiah threw his face to the wall may they turn their face in the prayer closet or maybe they turn their face oh god to on their knees in their bedroom whoever it may be or maybe at this altar of god may they turn their face to you and get back to their first love amen like that brother who emailed me from up north [Music] admitted he backs them god bless him for his honesty may our church if anyone needs it may they find it [Music] and lastly i pray lord may we serve you with such a perfect heart that we see the prosperity and peace of the holy ghost in our lives in our relationships here in our church [Music] and you can say if there ever was a little church that served the lord with the fervency with the love with the perfect heart it was bride of christ's fellowship few churches before a few churches after amen the militaries serve god with such a pure [Music] heart give your people the strength give your people lord the word of god and the courage to do it like ezra he knew the word and he did it give me the courage lord to do the word of god give your people the same courage to do the word of god [Music] is is oh [Music] this is is [Music] perfect [Music] is [Music] and then [Music] this is is [Music] about david says david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turn not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life such a beautiful description is that what your story says i'm actually pretty certain that's what my story says because when we get to romans 4 the bible starts talking about abraham and the bible says he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief amen but we're strong in faith giving god glory amen praise the lord can we praise the lord amen see the blood washes with that all the way and the blood says you stagger not because you got back up after your failures and you walk with faith just like father abraham amen amen let's sing a song here i'm done i better move here hallelujah thank you jesus you got a song in your heart better praise god let's just sing i will praise him i'll praise him praise the lamb for sinner slain amen [Music] me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] that we could sing all these songs [Music] jesus you are worthy amen we give you the praise we give you the glory in your house today because you've helped us to return to our first love hallelujah helped us to keep up your heart a perfect heart all the days of our life and we give you thanks and praise that we like abraham stagger not at the promise of god through unbelief but we're strong in faith giving god glory hallelujah thank you jesus you're the author and finisher of the story of my life lord the story of each and every person's life here lord god and we want to hear it say well done good and faithful servant you did that was right you didn't turn to the right hand or left bless your people with that great privilege amen hallelujah that their lives will be more dedicated more consecrated by the love of god than their peers than their brethren make them more honorable lord than other brothers and sisters not as competition but as a desire to work for the master while we have time to work for the scripture says there's coming a time when no man can work anymore the tribulation so lord help us to labor with love with confidence with courage wow there's light and while the vineyard is available god let us work for you until you come jesus may we by the grace of god be able to labor so that we know our story says what we wanted to say [Music] in jesus christ's name amen lord have service at five [Music] me [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] you
