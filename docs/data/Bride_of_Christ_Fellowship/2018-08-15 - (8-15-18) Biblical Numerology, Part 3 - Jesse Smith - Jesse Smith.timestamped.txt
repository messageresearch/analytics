[15:27] we see by hearing this is just a few
[15:32] announcements I ordered ten of the Acts
[15:35] of the Prophet books I'll try to hold a
[15:36] little closer it's got a new cover on it
[15:38] so one for each family in the church so
[15:43] probably won't be able to give those to
[15:45] you till two Sundays because I won't be
[15:48] here this Sunday so we'll give it you
[15:50] following suddenly that's the 28th if
[15:52] I'm not mistaken of August by God's
[15:55] grace unless I see you before that time
[15:57] it's our first announcement technically
[16:00] this Sunday brother Brian Hawkins will
[16:02] be preaching one service at 1:00 p.m. at
[16:05] the same YMCA and I'm sorry sorry it's
[16:09] later no we don't have a choice I know I
[16:11] wish we could get earlier but just so
[16:17] you know we have to be out by 4:00 I
[16:18] didn't know that last time and so they
[16:20] were kind of rushing the family out and
[16:22] that's my fault I didn't know that but
[16:25] we need to be out by 4:00 so hopefully
[16:28] everybody can remember that by God's
[16:30] grace I'll try that brother pride know
[16:31] as well and lastly there's update for a
[16:37] regular Church office the landlord
[16:39] emailed me and said they're still
[16:41] blowing I think today's the final day of
[16:43] blowing air on the ground to get it dry
[16:47] and then we'll start sanitizing it
[16:49] tomorrow to make sure there's no mold or
[16:50] anything like that and that will take a
[16:54] couple of days so she did not know when
[16:56] we would be back in she thought she
[16:58] thought I think she said maybe a week or
[17:00] two but with construction we all know it
[17:03] goes longer I know that firsthand so it
[17:05] may be week two weeks three weeks a
[17:07] month we don't know I'll just try it
[17:10] each week to make sure I reserve the
[17:14] YMCA there by God's grace for Sunday
[17:17] services okay that's all the
[17:19] announcements is there anything else I'm
[17:21] missing variances he serves I cares okay
[17:26] yeah we have some prayer requests do you
[17:27] remember remember Benjamin and Austen
[17:29] Benjamin's in New Jersey he says he
[17:32] misses everybody so let's just keep
[17:34] praying for him and also I heard from
[17:35] Austin's grandma today and she said
[17:38] Austin's doing much better so it seems
[17:43] like it helped for him to move away and
[17:44] today I ordered him a Bible on Amazon
[17:46] and I sent to him supposed to get there
[17:48] by Monday so he did not have a Bible he
[17:51] did not have a phone so we were just
[17:53] trying to help him out and encourage him
[17:55] there by God's grace - prayer requests

[28:50] I should just do a different text here
[29:25] let's just go back to Matthew 10 verse
[29:27] 28 we'll use that text for today Matthew
[29:38] 10:28 we'll just go back to that text we
[29:40] usually preach part one on biblical and
[29:42] numerology and when to preach part three
[29:44] tonight by the grace of the Lord Matthew
[29:52] 10:28 the scripture says and fear not
[29:54] them which kill the body but are not
[29:56] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[29:59] him which is able to destroy both soul
[30:01] and body in hell are not two sparrows
[30:06] sold for a farthing and one of them
[30:09] shall not fall on the ground without
[30:11] your father but the very hairs of your
[30:15] head are all numbered fear you not
[30:19] therefore you are of more value than the
[30:22] sparrows amen that's a word of Prayer
[30:24] let's ask God to bless his word here
[30:27] father in heaven Lord we love you Lord
[30:30] we've read your word we've sung your
[30:31] songs we ask o God that your Holy Spirit
[30:33] your presence will come an ointment or
[30:36] to preach your word to your people Lord
[30:38] may be received with the same spirit or
[30:41] the same hunger and thirst Lord of the
[30:43] Holy Spirit Lord we want to be filled
[30:45] tonight we want our minds though we want
[30:48] our souls filled on God we want all of
[30:49] our being filled with the Spirit of God
[30:52] let us have a fresh anointing a fresh
[30:54] inspirational God tonight dear God in
[30:57] your divine presence Lord teach us
[30:58] through thy word speak to us encourage
[31:01] us help us O God guide us along
[31:03] our way Lord this path you have for us
[31:06] and we know you do it in Jesus Christ's
[31:08] name
[31:09] nobody said Amen God this should be seen
[31:11] praise God I just before I get into the
[31:21] sermon I just want to give a little
[31:23] update on most of these may have saw it
[31:26] in the news the kind of way to give
[31:29] update on modern events and I think I
[31:34] don't think it may be not on this one
[31:36] here I had a little bit of thought okay
[31:40] here to chip and it kind of goes with
[31:44] the question I had a few weeks ago so I
[31:46] just want to like I want to talk about
[31:48] the Roman Catholic Church tonight just
[31:50] to start off for a moment here before we
[31:53] get to biblical numerology yesterday
[31:56] there was a report that came out from
[31:59] Pennsylvania was a grand jury it was a
[32:03] grand jury I'm not mistaken one of those
[32:06] court systems in Pennsylvania and they
[32:09] had done a report for 18 months so a
[32:13] year and a half they did a report and
[32:14] they investigated six diocese in
[32:18] Pennsylvania and they found over 1,000
[32:22] victims of sexual abuse
[32:27] more than 300 more pre-report so each
[32:31] report if I remember right from the news
[32:33] outlets and the reason I'm sharing this
[32:36] is because there's two reasons the
[32:38] prophet of God told us to watch the
[32:40] purple curtain so we also watch the iron
[32:44] curtain Russia where brother Branham who
[32:49] said later towards the end of the
[32:50] message the Holy Spirit put a little
[32:52] more force and said watch the purple
[32:55] curtain so we watch you know watch the
[32:58] Pope and we watch what he does the
[33:00] church but this week we've seen how more
[33:04] of the abuse has become public knowledge
[33:07] you know remember a few years ago when
[33:09] it was really big in Boston so know my
[33:11] wife I remember and it was awful I don't
[33:15] know how many I don't know compared to
[33:16] that this strategy tragedy here in
[33:19] Pennsylvania I don't know how how it
[33:21] compares to that emboss and I don't know
[33:23] but again there's over a thousand
[33:27] victims and those are just the ones that
[33:29] came forward the I think it was the
[33:33] Attorney General I'm not mistaken from
[33:34] Pennsylvania reported and said that
[33:37] there's probably thousands more so I
[33:40] just wanted to start with this and and
[33:43] share that a few weeks ago how this ties
[33:48] in with our ministry a few weeks ago you
[33:51] might remember I was preaching on how I
[33:53] rather be a doormat in the house the
[33:55] Lord does anybody remember that was on
[33:57] the Wednesday night and brother Brad was
[34:00] making the point that Christians are
[34:03] going to be mistreated well after the
[34:07] sermon someone had a concern and they
[34:10] just wanted to clarify what I meant by
[34:12] that and they they wanted to make sure
[34:14] that I didn't think it was okay to her
[34:17] children and of course I said it's
[34:20] always wrong to her children it's always
[34:25] wrong no matter verbally physically
[34:26] sexually any way to hurt a child and
[34:29] that cased an adult I do not believe
[34:32] it's okay to abuse anyone the point I
[34:36] was making from brother branham's quote
[34:38] was that as Christians many times
[34:41] people are gonna sin against us hurt us
[34:43] and we've got to be able to take it and
[34:45] forgive them we know Jesus said if
[34:48] someone offends you were supposed to go
[34:49] to them as well but I was not referring
[34:52] that anyone should ever be abused and
[34:55] then hide it from other people
[34:58] so I just wanted to clarify that I
[35:00] appreciated the person coming to talk to
[35:02] me they seemed very sincere I think that
[35:04] was a godly thing to do but I want
[35:06] everyone to know plainly that it is
[35:09] wrong to abuse any child or any adult
[35:13] anyone at all
[35:14] all abuse is of the devil all abuse is
[35:17] from the pits of hell so I hope
[35:19] everybody knows that by God's grace or
[35:22] the ramsett a real man would never make
[35:24] a woman a doormat okay but the point
[35:28] brother man was making there is that you
[35:30] know just as Jesus was persecuted his
[35:32] disciples were persecuted so we expect
[35:35] at some point will be persecuted or
[35:37] mocked or made fun of or ridiculed and
[35:40] we have to take that so that's the point
[35:43] I was trying to make by the grace of God
[35:45] let me share this as well because of all
[35:49] this all the predator priests that we've
[35:52] seen Horsham Boston now in Pennsylvania
[35:59] it's it reminds us that the Bible says
[36:01] this is why we preach against the Roman
[36:03] Catholic Church not because we're
[36:05] against the people because we're against
[36:07] the spirit behind the system that's why
[36:09] we preach against the Roman Catholic
[36:11] Church because the Bible said she is a
[36:14] cage of unclean and hateful bird I know
[36:17] that's all that sounds awful but that's
[36:19] the truth of the Bible and this
[36:22] investigation in Pennsylvania helps
[36:25] further prove that that's why year after
[36:27] year you know decade after decade I keep
[36:29] preaching against that system because
[36:32] this is what it produces then let me
[36:33] quote you some quotations directly from
[36:37] an article I read and then also an
[36:40] interview with people who were abused
[36:42] let me read you some things here there
[36:46] was a man who was interviewed who was
[36:48] abused as a child in the Roman Catholic
[36:50] Church he became a Catholic priest for
[36:53] 18 years
[36:54] and he said there is something in the
[36:57] DNA of the church that encourages sexual
[37:00] abuse and we know what that is that's
[37:04] evil spirits it's the evil spirits that
[37:06] are in the Roman Catholic Church he said
[37:09] as he he made his way through the system
[37:12] for 18 years he realized there was an
[37:14] epidemic among the priests and and then
[37:20] a Christian named Matt Walsh wrote a
[37:22] blog about it I'm gonna read some of his
[37:24] quotes he read about he read parts of
[37:28] the investigation report and said there
[37:31] were violent sexual assault and rape
[37:33] charges
[37:33] there were abortions that came out
[37:35] because of this
[37:37] even overdoses on drugs and deaths all
[37:40] because of all this perversion this
[37:42] abuse which is so awful but he noted
[37:46] that church official churches officials
[37:49] covered up all these acts and they're
[37:53] the people that cover them up the
[37:55] priests that cover them up are the
[37:56] workers they're just as guilty as those
[37:59] people who committed the acts because we
[38:02] should not keep silent when we see evil
[38:03] we have to be the voice for the
[38:05] voiceless so that's a good point he made
[38:08] he said these this wickedness is
[38:10] straight from the pits of hell and and
[38:15] there was so much more to be said but
[38:17] I'm going to probably stop there and
[38:20] just so you know my advice to the church
[38:22] and the people
[38:27] for children or even adults familiar
[38:32] family friends or in this case trusted
[38:36] men in the church so that's why we never
[38:40] leave our children alone with other
[38:43] people we always want to be with them
[38:46] now of course you have you know family
[38:48] that can be trusted make sure they can
[38:50] be trusted before you leave your
[38:52] children with them as a father I don't
[38:55] do many sleepovers my children here or
[38:58] other places very very rarely does that
[39:01] happen in order to protect our children
[39:04] and remember the priest a lot of their
[39:07] abuse was was with boys now I know a lot
[39:11] of abuses with little girls as well but
[39:13] they're finding in these cases these
[39:16] priests are attacking a lot of teenage
[39:18] boys which is really awful course it's
[39:21] all awful but just to give you an idea
[39:23] of what they found through this 18-month
[39:26] report so really be wise be wise around
[39:32] our church when we gather you know
[39:35] together no matter where we are always
[39:36] be wise always keep an eye where your
[39:38] children are just because sometimes
[39:40] we'll get visitors you never know what
[39:42] they might do just make sure whatever
[39:45] you do with your children you're with
[39:48] them as much as possible or if someone
[39:51] is caring over them who you know is born
[39:54] to get and is not going to do an evil
[39:57] act to them because a lot you know some
[40:00] of these priests would do the evil acts
[40:02] in front of other people
[40:03] like one of the examples was the the
[40:06] priest would be in a classroom teaching
[40:07] a classroom and he would call boys up to
[40:09] read out of the Catholic books and he
[40:12] would even abuse them right there behind
[40:15] the desk so he would have his hands in a
[40:18] place where he would abused him so this
[40:20] devil is so wicked
[40:21] he's so conniving he's so evil he'll
[40:24] stoop to any depth to express his evil
[40:29] spirits so we've got to make sure we
[40:32] have the Holy Spirit and with the Holy
[40:34] Spirit we protect all the children all
[40:36] the adults live a life that's worthy
[40:39] well we never hurt anyone so I just
[40:41] don't let everyone know when I preach
[40:44] that message about being a doormat I did
[40:46] not mean for any child of course not any
[40:50] child should never be abused nor should
[40:52] any dog be abused I just want to make
[40:54] sure I say that I want to take about ten
[40:56] minutes to address that because that's
[40:59] very important and this is not limited
[41:02] to the Roman Catholic Church you know my
[41:03] wife and I have talked numerous times
[41:06] we've we've read other blogs and
[41:08] articles and abuses in almost all the
[41:11] churches so whenever there's a person
[41:15] who's not learned again they're
[41:16] susceptible to that type of behavior but
[41:19] a person who's truly born again will not
[41:21] do it because the Bible said the
[41:23] effeminate will not inherit the kingdom
[41:25] of God and the effeminate in the Greek
[41:27] means a child of molester so anyone who
[41:31] molest a child is clearly not born again
[41:33] and so when you have a church leader or
[41:36] a church anyone trusted in the church in
[41:38] any office if they would commit such an
[41:41] act and crews they're not born again it
[41:43] proves they're not sanctified I would go
[41:45] as far as saying it may prove they're
[41:46] not even saved yet they just had an
[41:48] intellectual conception of God and
[41:52] they've never even repented of their sin
[41:54] because they've never learned to hate
[41:56] sin they've never learned to hate abuse
[41:59] so please contact me if you have any
[42:01] questions I just want to be absolutely
[42:02] clear on that
[42:03] and let you know that we're watching the
[42:06] purple curtain and we're seeing now I
[42:08] don't know how Satan is gonna do this
[42:10] his number saying is going to see the
[42:11] whole world he's going to unite all the
[42:13] churches the Protestant churches first
[42:15] in the World Council of Churches and
[42:16] then the Roman Catholic Church is going
[42:18] to gain ahead over them I don't know how
[42:20] he's going to do this maybe there will
[42:23] be a so-called purge in the Roman
[42:25] Catholic Church so people will accept
[42:27] them more I don't know but what you know
[42:30] one thing all this jesus said by their
[42:33] fruits they are known and so with that I
[42:37] think I'll I'll just stop right there
[42:39] and hopefully that clears up everything
[42:42] by the grace of the Lord so god bless
[42:45] everybody but I can't look continue now
[42:47] at numerology so I guess we can relax a
[42:49] little bit by God's grace and that's a
[42:50] very serious subject but I want to look
[42:52] again at numeral
[42:53] Gino brother branham said God is known
[42:58] by his numbers and this last week I told
[43:02] you I had more reading do I finish unit
[43:04] unit four I'm sorry chapter four rather
[43:06] in the Bulger book about numbers in
[43:09] Scripture and as I was going through
[43:11] there Jose sent me a few extra examples
[43:14] of numbers and different people
[43:15] suggested different numbers that I have
[43:17] forgotten about so I'm going to cover 1
[43:19] through 4 tonight again by God's grace
[43:22] and I'm going to add only new things I'm
[43:24] not going to bring up anything old
[43:25] unless it's relative or helpful to help
[43:27] you understand it so is everybody ready
[43:29] my guys Gracie got Bibles here while we
[43:31] get off I've already turned me you can
[43:33] read it young Bible we read them I take
[43:36] all the help I can get Rina I keep you
[43:38] guys engaged as well
[43:40] ok so for number one number one means
[43:44] primacy or preeminence or unity and the
[43:48] first example or the only example I have
[43:50] of this when I thought it later as I was
[43:52] reading the scripture 1st Corinthians
[43:54] 6:16 the Bible said when two are joined
[43:57] together physically they become one
[43:59] flesh so that's an example of unity so
[44:02] in a marriage relationship when two
[44:05] people are married and come together
[44:07] physically now they've expressed unity a
[44:09] oneness the Bible says there's one flesh
[44:12] oh I could add another one here the
[44:13] Bible said when you become a Christian
[44:15] you're now one spirit with the Lord so
[44:17] you have the natural unity and then you
[44:20] have the spiritual unity so I could add
[44:22] that here why don't I
[44:31] okay now I felt you know let again to
[44:39] study on this and I'll tell you another
[44:40] reason why I went to the dry cleaner
[44:42] yesterday and I dropped off all my dry
[44:44] cleaning and I walked in there and the
[44:46] woman says you're you're five you're
[44:48] four minutes late Jesse I said what was
[44:49] i late for I didn't even know how I'm
[44:51] supposed to be here four minutes ago and
[44:52] I just joking and she said someone had a
[44:55] Bible question and I said oh okay I wish
[44:59] I could have been here I said what was
[45:00] the question and she said she said what
[45:04] does the four corners of the earth mean
[45:07] and I said I said oh and it was so
[45:10] strange I'm preaching on numbers and a
[45:12] person asked me about the phone number
[45:13] four so I could see God's hand in that
[45:17] so I said well what you probably think
[45:19] is that people are saying the earth is
[45:20] flat now I personally don't believe that
[45:22] I think the earth is round and there's
[45:25] different reasons if you want and the
[45:27] people want me to preach a sermon on
[45:28] that I could but I'll explain it just
[45:30] like I did yesterday the word corner
[45:33] there means angle so there's four angles
[45:36] to the earth in other words there's four
[45:37] directions so north south east west no
[45:40] matter where you are the Bible said that
[45:41] the angels were going to hold the four
[45:43] winds on the four corners of the earth
[45:45] so that means the wind from any
[45:48] direction God is going to hold back the
[45:49] winds and the wind means strife or Wars
[45:52] for the brand says so all the wars from
[45:55] any direction so any direction where you
[45:58] could think of a war coming from naught
[46:00] is gonna hold that back until 144,000
[46:03] are sealed with the Holy Ghost with the
[46:05] seal their foreheads then the angels
[46:07] will let loose all those winds and then
[46:10] the destruction will come upon the earth
[46:11] and arm again but that's what I told the
[46:15] woman there and I left my card and I
[46:16] said well please email me or please call
[46:18] me if you have any other questions so it
[46:20] was interesting that people are asking
[46:21] about numbers yesterday and so I thought
[46:24] I would continue on numbers by the grace
[46:26] of God I'll preach a little bit more
[46:28] about the four corners in just a moment
[46:30] okay that's look at number two now I
[46:32] have some new ones for this by the grace
[46:36] of God
[46:38] Malakai why don't you go to Luke 12:51
[46:41] Lydia Philippians 1 23 and 24 let me set
[46:45] the timer here 12:51 and Lydia flip
[46:51] ian's 123 if we since we have no more
[46:54] time tonight I think I'll do that I
[46:55] think I love
[46:57] I think I'll read a few more scriptures
[46:59] because I only have let's see I guess
[47:01] you have quite a few slides
[47:02] maybe I'll just read them at the
[47:04] beginning and then we'll move a little
[47:06] faster here so malachi number 2 speaks
[47:09] of poor things it can speak of division
[47:11] it can speak of difference like
[47:13] contrasting two things it could stand
[47:16] for testimony or witness they can also
[47:19] stand for friendship or unity malachi
[47:22] want to read this 12:51 52d men Jesus
[47:39] plainly says I come to bring division
[47:41] I'm going to separate believers from
[47:44] unbelievers to represents the vision on
[47:47] this case 5 is divided into groups 3 -
[47:49] it's not divided evenly with humans is
[47:51] divided 3 and 2 okay Lydia Philippians
[47:55] 123 Paul has two desires so Paul is kind
[47:58] of divided in his heart I've got two
[48:01] desires Philippians 1 23 and 24 - by the
[48:10] foot is more needful for you amen so can
[48:13] everybody see the two parts
[48:14] Paul was divided part of me wants to go
[48:16] to heaven but part of me wants to stay
[48:18] here the Bible let's talk about that for
[48:20] us right we talked about that a few
[48:22] weeks ago with the groanings we're
[48:23] groaning for a new body well the only
[48:25] way to do that is to leave this body
[48:28] here and then go to that body unless the
[48:29] rapture takes place and that body was
[48:31] swallowed up in their body right here so
[48:34] to speak subdivision now - speaks for
[48:36] difference in Matthew 21 Jesus used a
[48:40] parable two sons to show true repentance
[48:43] verse false repentance
[48:44] remember when the son said oh I'll go
[48:47] work for your dad but he didn't that was
[48:48] false repentance
[48:50] and then the one said oh I'm not going
[48:52] to work for a dad but then he did a 180
[48:54] he did repentance and he went work for
[48:56] the father so see you have that shows
[48:58] the difference so we have two paths and
[49:01] that shows the difference that's one way
[49:02] to repentance the other way is the false
[49:04] way now jesus said there's a difference
[49:06] at the rapture there's two grinding at
[49:08] the mill one is taken one is left
[49:11] there's two working in the field one is
[49:13] taken what is left there's two sleeping
[49:15] in a bed one is taken what is left that
[49:18] shows the difference of the Holy Ghost o
[49:20] believer versus those who are not amen
[49:23] Jesus preached a parable to debtors and
[49:26] showed the difference between who would
[49:28] love in the most whoever was forgiven
[49:31] the most would love the most
[49:33] how many love Jesus tonight amen think
[49:35] about all he's forgiving you from and
[49:37] I'll always make you love him more by
[49:40] God's grace you think of all the evils
[49:42] all the sins I can think of the ones
[49:43] I've done since I was even a Christian
[49:46] the ones I did before as a Christian and
[49:47] the one since I've done since I've been
[49:49] a Christian and it just get the list
[49:52] adds up now not as fast of course it
[49:54] doesn't have the best fast cuz I'm
[49:55] sanctified filled with the Spirit of God
[49:56] but I still fall short live Lord God but
[50:00] the more we see his forgiveness the more
[50:01] we love it that shows the difference I
[50:04] shows the difference between someone who
[50:05] loves them a little bit or someone who
[50:07] loves them a lot when they really can
[50:09] appreciate all the payment forgiven for
[50:10] amen alright now there's a couple more
[50:13] on difference Jesus said there was a
[50:15] parable two men brain one man was saying
[50:17] God be merciful to me a sinner beating
[50:19] himself with the chest the other man was
[50:21] saying they're looking and saying thank
[50:22] God I'm not like that's
[50:26] the difference between sure they cost
[50:29] contingent true religion will never
[50:31] it'll make you feel compassion for them
[50:33] it will not make you attack them and
[50:36] make yourself exalted in Pride but true
[50:39] religion will make you humble yourself
[50:40] and realize how much you really need
[50:42] Jesus amen that's the difference of two
[50:45] types of prayer in the church Paul said
[50:49] there's two kinds of glory for the two
[50:51] kinds of bodies there's a glory for the
[50:53] celestial which is the theophany and
[50:55] then there's a glory for the terrestrial
[50:58] this body right two kinds of glories
[51:00] that's first Corinthian 1540 Jesus now
[51:03] let's go to testimony as the testimony
[51:05] Jesus sent out his disciples two by two
[51:08] so twos
[51:10] he said about by twos because two you
[51:12] have a greater testimony but two Jesus
[51:15] gave Peter the keys of the kingdom which
[51:17] would have a 2 volt testimony and they
[51:25] also Luke can bind up the brokenhearted
[51:27] so if your heart is in pieces we just
[51:29] need the keys of the kingdom to bind
[51:31] that up amen hmm how they need to bring
[51:33] healing like these poor people in
[51:35] Pennsylvania that we can pray for their
[51:38] hearts are all broken up the Holy Spirit
[51:40] the keys can bind them up together and
[51:42] restore their hearts and give them some
[51:44] healing by God's grace also the keys the
[51:47] kingdom will loose demons off of people
[51:50] amen
[51:51] because Jesus commanded mark 9:25 Jesus
[51:54] rebuked the demons and told him to leave
[51:56] and he said never enter into him again
[51:58] now I was telling somebody that one in
[51:59] text this week I said we have the power
[52:01] it was a man actually was started with
[52:04] homosexuality he was texting me this
[52:05] week and I told him sir I said have you
[52:07] ever bound that spirit and then loose
[52:11] that spirit and rebuke that spirit and
[52:13] told that spirit to never return that's
[52:15] what we have to do we have to speak in
[52:17] the name of Jesus Christ and command
[52:19] those spirits to leave us and never come
[52:21] back
[52:21] amen if that's what Jesus Christ did in
[52:24] Jesus Christ it said the works that I do
[52:26] shall you do also amen hallelujah now
[52:31] also the whole Old Testament hangs as on
[52:34] a testimony on two scriptures write the
[52:37] law and the prophets the Bible said
[52:39] jesus said the laws of prophets hang on
[52:41] these two great Commandments I'm sorry
[52:43] the two commandments of love God with
[52:45] all your heart and then love your
[52:46] neighbors yourself all the law hangs on
[52:49] these two so these two are a testimony
[52:51] or a witness of God's righteousness
[52:53] you can hang everything you can hang all
[52:56] the laws on these two because these are
[52:58] a testimony of what God wants us to do
[53:00] love God and love people I've never seen
[53:03] that on a church sign love God love
[53:05] people right see they're trying to sum
[53:07] up the two greatest Commandments though
[53:08] that's true
[53:10] and that's what we should do love God
[53:11] with all of our hearts and then love
[53:13] people as well amen
[53:14] okay next year hurt me last one for
[53:20] number two friendship in unity Jesus
[53:22] said to that agree and ask the father
[53:24] will receive it and you just need to
[53:26] have that unity we have if Aaron and I
[53:29] could agree in Malachi 9 liddie not
[53:31] patient if all of us can agree if two of
[53:33] us could agree God will give it to us
[53:35] way then but it's got to be revealed
[53:37] it's got to be his will it's got to be
[53:39] revealed to us it's gotta be the time in
[53:40] season two man tells us that as well
[53:44] also there's one more I found in
[53:47] scripture this week the two horns
[53:49] remember the two horns on the Beast out
[53:51] of the land which was like a bison
[53:52] remember that revelation 13 it had two
[53:55] horns when they stand for it was a unity
[53:57] of ecclesiastical and civil civil powers
[54:01] well the rim said it was a union it was
[54:03] a you know Satan satanic one I should
[54:06] have put that on her here so I'm sorry I
[54:08] put it in the wrong section so this
[54:11] should be under Satan's invitation of
[54:13] the number two he has a false unity
[54:15] he has a unity with government power
[54:18] civil powers and then as church powers
[54:20] unified and you see that two years ago
[54:23] brother where America when Obama made
[54:25] the Bison the national mammal did you
[54:28] see that two years ago amen
[54:30] so that was just further proof that
[54:32] America is in Revelation 13 and is that
[54:36] beast that rose up on the land remember
[54:38] by some onions that's right yeah big
[54:43] announcement and they have a big old
[54:45] website on it now too but it's just more
[54:47] improvements God vindicating this
[54:48] message brother Graham said that in 1954
[54:50] he said that that beasts on the land
[54:53] was a bison and people could argue about
[54:56] it but you can't argue about it anymore
[54:57] because the Bison is the National
[55:00] Buffalo I'm sorry the national mammal of
[55:02] this nation praise the Lord
[55:04] now so Satan has imitations of two he
[55:07] has the two horns with the Roman
[55:10] Catholic Church inside the United States
[55:12] and now here's another one I found Jesus
[55:14] said no man can serve two masters Satan
[55:18] will convince people especially
[55:20] Laodiceans write that they can serve God
[55:22] and Mammon because the Bible said
[55:25] they'll be lovers of pleasures more than
[55:28] lovers of God see they still love God a
[55:30] little right with a false love it's a
[55:32] it's a figlio love it's not it's just a
[55:34] feeling love like like I all my love all
[55:37] my friends leave many of my friends that
[55:38] reject the message they tell me how much
[55:40] they love going to church they go to
[55:42] rock-and-roll churches and they feel
[55:44] good they have all these feelings well
[55:46] it's a false love because they love the
[55:48] feelings but they don't love the word
[55:50] right
[55:51] so Satan is trick them Satan's trick
[55:53] them oh you can love you can serve both
[55:54] masters you can enjoy lust of the flesh
[55:56] the worldly things trying to like lust
[55:58] of the eyes and you can love God but let
[56:01] me tell you you can't jesus said you can
[56:02] only serve one master but Satan has
[56:05] imitated this - and he's using - oh you
[56:08] can love God and still sin oh you can't
[56:10] if you love God you'll hate all sin
[56:12] because the sin was the reason Jesus
[56:14] died for you and so if you appreciate
[56:16] Jesus death you never want to enjoy any
[56:18] sin anymore
[56:19] so iniquity in q7o they love the spirits
[56:28] anointing the cast out Devils prophesied
[56:30] but they were workers of iniquity
[56:31] workers of sin so they love sin but they
[56:34] also enjoyed the Friends of God the
[56:36] Bible said friendship with the world is
[56:38] hatred or enmity with God in James 4:4
[56:41] and flirting with the world is blasphemy
[56:45] of God's preeminence amen so anyone that
[56:48] flirts and still enjoys the things of
[56:50] the world they're blasting against the
[56:52] things of God right they're speaking
[56:54] evil against that by their own life
[56:56] because the Bible says if you enjoy sin
[56:58] after you've tasted the Spirit of God
[56:59] you crucified the Lord of fresh Bible
[57:02] says that in Hebrews chapter 6 does that
[57:04] make sense everybody so Satan has for
[57:06] murder the
[57:07] - oh you can love God and still love the
[57:09] world you can get drunk and still be a
[57:11] Christian
[57:11] oh you can't this is this is a false
[57:15] friendship that Satan has perverted you
[57:18] only serve one master okay
[57:20] let's go to number three now three has
[57:22] two meanings it means divine perfection
[57:25] and life and we'll look at some new ones
[57:27] here today I found a good one let's go
[57:30] to proverbs 15 20 I'm sorry Luke 15 22
[57:34] in case you don't read that I never the
[57:36] Aaron if you could get let's do it a
[57:45] revelation 1 verse 1 and then a ship in
[57:50] Luke 13 22 the first one occations going
[57:55] to do is for life how three represents
[57:58] life did you catch it
[58:16] how many things were giving to the
[58:18] prodigal when he returned three he was
[58:22] given robe ring and shoes a member in
[58:25] verse 24 his father said we must rejoice
[58:27] but he was dead but now he's what why
[58:30] alive so 3 represents life so he comes
[58:35] back and he has three things ringing
[58:37] robe shoes three represents life he's
[58:40] dead now he's alive amen
[58:42] beautiful I thought that's beautiful
[58:44] just like member the seeds rose up on
[58:46] the third day of grace right rose up
[58:48] life Jesus rose on the third day praise
[58:50] God
[58:51] even though that was beautiful I never
[58:53] saw that before amen now beforehand read
[58:56] says I'm going to skip a few G before I
[58:57] get to his in Revelation like turning
[58:59] you can alter the revelation links we
[59:01] got a lot of reading in there brother
[59:02] Simon preached on Revelation one run one
[59:04] on Sunday I don't know if you got the
[59:05] chance to see that or not okay as hos
[59:08] they record it but then you put it on
[59:09] YouTube and I'm not sure if you're his
[59:11] friend on they use friend on Facebook or
[59:13] your Facebook idea I don't get on okay
[59:15] but your brothers on it right yeah
[59:17] I've got on here sorry I think I got
[59:19] account yeah sorry about that
[59:23] anyways I've got assignment preached a
[59:25] lot on Revelation one and then I
[59:26] remember this week that there's lots of
[59:29] threes in Revelation one so that will
[59:30] tell you with Sunday's message so before
[59:33] we read revelation one in nature there's
[59:36] three kinds of glory the Bible says the
[59:38] Sun there's a glory of the Sun those are
[59:41] the glory of the Moon and a glory of the
[59:42] stars that's in perscriptions 1541
[59:45] there's three kinds of glory and not
[59:47] atmospheres next in the crucifixion
[59:50] Jesus took three people within the pray
[59:53] in the garden that's divine perfection
[59:55] yeah those three witnesses also in
[59:59] judgment how many woes are there for he
[1:00:02] was so there's divine perfection God is
[1:00:05] giving divine judgment against the world
[1:00:07] there's three world robe whoa was I'm
[1:00:10] sorry there's three woes that are poured
[1:00:13] out during the seven trumpets and that's
[1:00:15] in Revelation 9 12 okay now we return to
[1:00:18] revelation one brother Aaron K read
[1:00:20] verse 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:23] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:00:26] servants things which must shortly come
[1:00:29] to pass and he sent and signified it
[1:00:35] thank you it by His angels and to his
[1:00:39] servant John amen
[1:00:41] so you see this whole chapter chapter
[1:00:43] one is filled with threes we're gonna go
[1:00:45] through this cuz I think this is worth
[1:00:46] going showing you remember what did
[1:00:49] brother Simon say on Sunday that brother
[1:00:52] Branham talked about revelation one
[1:00:54] what's the one thing we're supposed to
[1:00:55] see about Jesus from revelation one he
[1:00:58] was what he's one yeah but also is he
[1:01:02] just a man or is he he's God so broke
[1:01:06] run Graham's a revelation one is the
[1:01:08] focus of this is to see how Jesus Christ
[1:01:10] is divine Carmy he's divine which means
[1:01:14] the fullness of God is in Jesus Christ
[1:01:17] when you've seen Jesus you've seen the
[1:01:19] father because the father is invisible
[1:01:21] who will never see but he became visible
[1:01:23] in the son so there's three things in
[1:01:26] verse 1 the brother Aaron read it was
[1:01:29] this revelation was divine
[1:01:31] given and this was divinely sent and
[1:01:35] divinely signified three there's three
[1:01:39] attributes being divinely given divine
[1:01:42] descent divinely signify signified by
[1:01:44] the angel right given divinely given to
[1:01:46] John and divinely sent as well praise
[1:01:49] the Lord
[1:01:50] oh yeah sent by the angel to that
[1:01:53] signified by the angel so there's a
[1:01:55] three so verse to Malachi can reverse
[1:01:57] two there's three and verse two ok so
[1:02:05] you see the three there John bear record
[1:02:08] of the Divine Word of God the divine
[1:02:11] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[1:02:13] things that he saw three see that three
[1:02:16] he's a witness he's a divine witness I
[1:02:19] gave up heavily witness of these three
[1:02:21] things word Jesus Christ oh all right
[1:02:28] free to the divine blessing there's
[1:02:38] three levels of divine blessing blessed
[1:02:40] on the reader blessed on the here I
[1:02:42] bless them to keep her glorious all
[1:02:49] these all these three sorts trying to
[1:02:51] show what divinity trying to show how
[1:02:53] this is a perfect book this is a perfect
[1:02:56] revelation of Jesus Christ because
[1:02:57] there's threes all right case you verse
[1:02:59] 4 now verse 4 and 8 said the same thing
[1:03:01] we just read verse 4 was all right so
[1:03:15] this is Jesus divine being this shows
[1:03:18] that he was which was he is and he is to
[1:03:22] come that's when you know your divine
[1:03:24] you're the same which was is it is to
[1:03:27] come you always be there right we leave
[1:03:29] we leave in and out of time but Jesus
[1:03:31] was before during after always there
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:34] are they aren't he reversed five force
[1:03:36] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:03:39] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:03:41] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[1:03:43] of the earth and
[1:03:44] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:03:47] sins in his own blood
[1:03:49] Amen I there's a bunch of three sir you
[1:03:52] know the first three is the coming Lord
[1:03:54] is presented as the faithful witness
[1:03:55] that's the divine prophet when he was on
[1:03:58] earth so prophet it means that the first
[1:04:01] begotten oh that's now he's a high
[1:04:03] priest right because he's risen first we
[1:04:04] got in reason that no he's a high priest
[1:04:05] so prophet priest what's next prophet
[1:04:07] priest and King and he's called the
[1:04:09] Prince of the kings of the air named
[1:04:12] prophet priest King son of man son of
[1:04:15] God son of David all these three DS to
[1:04:17] show God divinely perfected Jesus Christ
[1:04:20] and his roles and he has God I love this
[1:04:24] next one this is glorious verse five and
[1:04:26] six brother Aaron read part of it mount
[1:04:28] I read verse 6 as kings and priests unto
[1:04:32] God this oughta make us rejoice in verse
[1:04:38] 5 the Bible said him that loved us so we
[1:04:41] are divinely loved divinely not like
[1:04:46] God's gonna stop loving you tomorrow for
[1:04:48] God's gonna get so upset he's done with
[1:04:49] you he's gonna cut you off he's gonna
[1:04:52] cut me up no this is divine love this is
[1:04:54] a love so great that only God could
[1:04:57] express it amen so his people are
[1:05:00] divinely loved him that loved us his
[1:05:02] people are divinely cleansed because
[1:05:06] he's their wash he's washed us from our
[1:05:08] sins in his own blood amen glory
[1:05:11] so we're divinely love divinely washed
[1:05:14] and were divinely crowned in the
[1:05:16] Millennium because the Bible said he has
[1:05:18] made us kings and priests unto God and
[1:05:20] his father glory so we have these three
[1:05:24] divine attributes to us by God's grace I
[1:05:28] hear the door open his demeanor
[1:05:29] oh it's carefully I know like if someone
[1:05:32] was here like Aaron
[1:05:33] something else was coming it's what
[1:05:36] makes sure I greet them Mary praise the
[1:05:38] Lord can you see that you're divinely
[1:05:40] love oh we catch one thing tonight let's
[1:05:42] catch that He loves us divinely he
[1:05:44] washes us divinely and were crowned
[1:05:46] divinely amen we're so unworthy but he's
[1:05:49] so worth it
[1:05:50] okay Lydia can you read verses 17 and 18
[1:05:57] yeah both sounds unity when I saw my
[1:06:01] father's feet is dead and he laid his
[1:06:04] right hand upon me and staying in the
[1:06:05] meat through naught and the first and
[1:06:07] the last time he that liveth and was
[1:06:09] dead and behold I am how I heard before
[1:06:11] amen and have the keys of hell and death
[1:06:13] all rights to c3 in their crisis
[1:06:16] presented as divinely eternal because
[1:06:18] he's the first and the last
[1:06:20] so he's divinely eternal second he's
[1:06:23] presented as dead and alive which means
[1:06:24] he's divinely living his life is so
[1:06:27] great at Concord death right and thirdly
[1:06:30] I love this he is presented as divinely
[1:06:32] powerful because he has the keys or
[1:06:35] controls hell and death so he's divinely
[1:06:38] eternal divinely living and he's
[1:06:40] divinely powerful amen
[1:06:42] all right acacia can you read verse 19
[1:06:44] and I think that's the last of the
[1:06:46] threes of Revelation when I had read
[1:06:48] that because it was so powerful okay so
[1:07:00] to spread the divine revelation yes to
[1:07:03] write three things just to write the
[1:07:04] things he has seen the things which are
[1:07:07] right now and the things which shall be
[1:07:10] Hereafter
[1:07:10] so I like was is is to come so that's
[1:07:14] the divine way to do it you had to write
[1:07:16] it down so you appreciate that you like
[1:07:18] how that connects with Sunday's messages
[1:07:19] I'm gonna preach on revelation 1
[1:07:21] revelation 1 and I told him I said well
[1:07:23] I've been preaching some of those things
[1:07:24] and here we go we can see God's divine
[1:07:26] perfection in Revelation chapter 1 all
[1:07:29] these threes okay and I got a few more
[1:07:31] here there are three mentions that
[1:07:35] Abraham is called the friend of God so
[1:07:37] God gave a perfect witness he's called
[1:07:39] it in second chronicles Isaiah 41 and
[1:07:42] James chapter 2
[1:07:43] Abraham is called the friend of God
[1:07:45] three times hey man so his friendship
[1:07:48] with God is perfect perfect the word
[1:07:51] Christian has found three times in the
[1:07:52] Bible that's the perfect name for a
[1:07:54] believer Christian X 11 X 25 first Peter
[1:07:57] 4:6
[1:07:58] okay I found two imitators of Satan
[1:08:01] imitating number three how many
[1:08:04] Humber's is Jove hath great were they
[1:08:07] good comforters no they were so bad God
[1:08:10] made them ask job to pray for them to be
[1:08:12] forgiven the other name were Elif as
[1:08:15] Bildad and Zophar three miserable
[1:08:18] comforters let's see you would think
[1:08:20] well Oh God's enemy three it's a perfect
[1:08:22] number but then you do
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:27] let me write it you don't have the right
[1:08:30] message they're sure not lining up with
[1:08:31] those things trying to alright how many
[1:08:34] adversaries indium I have three
[1:08:37] sanballat Tobiah and Yishuv you should
[1:08:41] and when they do they ridiculed her they
[1:08:43] mocked him made fun of him they said
[1:08:44] you'll never do this the government's
[1:08:46] gonna stop you he said even if a fox
[1:08:48] jumps on that wall it's kind of all over
[1:08:50] and they pay she said be quiet you don't
[1:08:52] have nothing to do with this we're gonna
[1:08:54] work with one hand another hand we're
[1:08:56] gonna fight y'all we're gonna wear to
[1:08:59] full purpose lest you go number two that
[1:09:01] oh that's a good one what would that fit
[1:09:05] in there number two must be a testimony
[1:09:09] a witness it must be the witness or a
[1:09:14] unity and was taking witness immunity
[1:09:18] okay all right so we're down a number
[1:09:21] for you a lot for number four I told you
[1:09:23] I didn't finish chapter four last week
[1:09:25] so I read the rest of chapter four
[1:09:26] there's a lot left so I'm gonna try it
[1:09:29] the highlights we're only gonna read the
[1:09:30] highlights because we're you know it's
[1:09:33] almost it's eight ten already so I wanna
[1:09:35] preached throughout twenty more minutes
[1:09:36] by God's grace 8:30 okay remember number
[1:09:41] four means deliverance I mean for that
[1:09:43] it means a double confirmation so God
[1:09:47] will confirm something twice with the
[1:09:49] double amount of witnesses and then it's
[1:09:52] also an earthly number which we'll talk
[1:09:53] about the four corners again in just a
[1:09:55] moment okay so let's look at double
[1:09:59] confirmation scriptures now God gives us
[1:10:03] a double confirmation of his love in
[1:10:05] Ephesians three I mentioned this last
[1:10:06] week but I didn't tell all of them and I
[1:10:08] wouldn't Aaron to hear him so I'm glad
[1:10:10] they came tonight the first thing is
[1:10:12] Paul said God's love has breath and
[1:10:15] breath means width and we saw from
[1:10:17] Scripture God loves us so much he
[1:10:20] separates us our sins as far as the East
[1:10:22] is from the West glories that's God love
[1:10:26] he has breath to us so it's so broad and
[1:10:29] wide it separates our sins
[1:10:31] totally from us second God's love has
[1:10:34] length and this was seen in the Bible
[1:10:37] said in Psalm 23 I'll dwell in the house
[1:10:39] Lord all the days of my life
[1:10:41] so the length of your life God's love is
[1:10:44] seen the length of your life the Bible
[1:10:46] also says that God's love extends to all
[1:10:48] generations that everybody say things
[1:10:51] that means our generation even you
[1:10:53] children you don't generation God's love
[1:10:55] extends to your generation aren't you
[1:10:57] glad I'm so glad extending for my
[1:11:00] generation amen
[1:11:01] thirdly the Bible said God's love has
[1:11:04] depth and the Bible said in Romans 11 oh
[1:11:07] the depths of the wisdom of God
[1:11:10] so his love is so great because it's
[1:11:12] full of wisdom his love is based upon
[1:11:14] wisdom in its deep deep knowledge so you
[1:11:17] have width you have length and now you
[1:11:20] have depth and the last one is height
[1:11:21] remember this one God's love the Bible
[1:11:24] said God's mercy reaches to the clouds
[1:11:26] his faithfulness reaches to the heavens
[1:11:29] it's so high God's love is so great it
[1:11:31] reaches all the way to hey man
[1:11:33] hallelujah so see there's four there's a
[1:11:36] double confirmation of God's love with
[1:11:38] those four aspects or four measurements
[1:11:40] to God's love okay where are we at with
[1:11:47] readers so we go back to Malachi okay
[1:11:49] let's see I forgot to delete it this
[1:11:58] one's kind of important now I go to
[1:12:00] first Chronicles 3 verse 5 while he's
[1:12:04] turning there I'm going to read a couple
[1:12:05] more first Chronicles 3:5 please
[1:12:14] Lydia why don't you go to number 13
[1:12:17] first one okay so before we read from
[1:12:25] Malachi in Jesus's parable the town's I
[1:12:29] remember I remember the town someone was
[1:12:31] given five one was given to one was
[1:12:32] given one the man who had the two
[1:12:36] talents he earned a double reward right
[1:12:39] the by Jesus said because you've been
[1:12:40] paid boy - I'm gonna give you two more
[1:12:42] so he got a double confirmation of a
[1:12:45] reward let's see two and then two so
[1:12:48] that had turned into four she had four
[1:12:50] talents at the end which was a double
[1:12:51] confirmation he was right okay all right
[1:12:55] this one's powerful Malachi God gave
[1:12:57] Bathsheba a confirmation that she was
[1:12:59] forgiven in love so now can you read
[1:13:01] that
[1:13:02] these are born in Jerusalem
[1:13:05] she ate sure but in a different
[1:13:08] settlement poor Bessie bill daughter
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:13] so Shiva had four sons I don't know if
[1:13:16] you knew that remember the first one
[1:13:19] died because of their sin God was gonna
[1:13:21] make them pay for their sin but after
[1:13:22] that God for gay bashing book
[1:13:27] a former stuns 'information right that
[1:13:32] God had forgiven her he blessed her with
[1:13:33] four sons remember there was a member
[1:13:35] with Michael member of David's right
[1:13:37] Michael
[1:13:38] because she spoke evil the holy ghost he
[1:13:40] said you're not having any God said I'm
[1:13:42] shutting up your room you have no wit
[1:13:43] you don't know children but now God
[1:13:45] blesses Bathsheba even after such an
[1:13:47] evil act as adultery
[1:13:49] she must have humbled herself she must
[1:13:51] have gotten right with God God gave her
[1:13:53] a double confirmation all right here's a
[1:13:56] next one Hebrews 2 verse 4 the Eligius 2
[1:13:59] in Luke 13 God gave the Holy Ghost a
[1:14:06] double confirmation on the earth because
[1:14:07] in Hebrews 2 for the Bible says the Holy
[1:14:10] Ghost gave signs wonders miracles and
[1:14:13] gifts of the Holy Ghost so God gave a
[1:14:15] double confirmation the Holy Ghost so if
[1:14:18] you're wondering oh god where you know
[1:14:19] will you confirm your word you just out
[1:14:21] looking no understand God's giving side
[1:14:27] he's back to his bride just so he's
[1:14:30] giving us a double confirmation of all
[1:14:32] he goes now Lydia in Luke 13 Jesus is
[1:14:35] telling a story about people who died a
[1:14:39] member the disciples asked them why did
[1:14:41] these people die they fell from the
[1:14:42] tower why did this happen why don't you
[1:14:46] go to the verse 7 that he can read 13 17
[1:15:02] let me pause right there Jesus had just
[1:15:04] told the story of these people dying and
[1:15:07] he said he said it wasn't because their
[1:15:09] sin in other words it was just their
[1:15:10] time to die okay they look like
[1:15:13] accidents but God knew it was their time
[1:15:15] to go but then Jesus says right after
[1:15:17] that he says that sinners actually live
[1:15:22] here you read verse living the cruel
[1:15:25] quick event something about sinners so
[1:15:28] can you look at verse is a 4 or 5 where
[1:15:30] it says something about sinners and read
[1:15:31] letters ok can you read that course or
[1:15:36] those eighteen upon deterrence a little
[1:15:40] fence
[1:15:40] thank you there were sinners above all
[1:15:44] okay verse five I tell you nay but
[1:15:47] except you repent you shall all likewise
[1:15:49] perish
[1:15:50] okay so Jesus letting us know when when
[1:15:53] like when 9/11 happened and when all
[1:15:55] these tragedies happen if there are
[1:15:58] sinners that you know go die in these
[1:16:00] accidents they're just as simple as
[1:16:02] anybody else around the world that would
[1:16:05] die in any case or where that would live
[1:16:08] the Bible said all men are without
[1:16:10] excuse let me understand that if I was a
[1:16:13] guy that showed his as creative power
[1:16:15] and Godhead in every human being body
[1:16:17] and mind
[1:16:18] everyone knows because the Bible said
[1:16:20] it's a fool to say there is no God only
[1:16:23] a fool would say that so the Bible says
[1:16:25] God has revealed in Romans 1 God has
[1:16:27] revealed that he's got to everybody and
[1:16:29] it's in your body you can see it somehow
[1:16:32] through your body that God is real and
[1:16:34] so everybody's accountable that they
[1:16:35] have judgments but here jesus saying
[1:16:38] when people die in an accident it's time
[1:16:40] for them to go god knew where they were
[1:16:41] gonna go and god gave him a chance to be
[1:16:44] saved before they were taken no doubt
[1:16:46] about that
[1:16:46] and jesus has a verse 5 except you
[1:16:49] repent you shall all likewise perish
[1:16:52] there's my reminder and then he gives
[1:16:56] the parable of this fig tree remember
[1:16:57] this big tree three years the man came
[1:16:59] looking for fruit and there was no fruit
[1:17:02] but Lydia the Reavers ain't men burst 9
[1:17:13] if it bear fruit well and if not then
[1:17:15] after that I shall cut it down this is
[1:17:18] something we need to remember Jesus
[1:17:19] talking about sinners here right you
[1:17:21] thought my sinners
[1:17:23] you know let's see three years he tried
[1:17:27] to give he tried to have a murder I try
[1:17:30] to have patience for three years and
[1:17:32] then when he's ready to cut them off
[1:17:34] God's mercy something said give them one
[1:17:36] more chance is that you were our event
[1:17:39] God gave you another chance
[1:17:40] amen to see God says I'm gonna give you
[1:17:43] a double confirmation in other words
[1:17:45] Jesus letting them know these people
[1:17:46] that died in the tower these people who
[1:17:48] died here they're all you know they were
[1:17:49] all given a chance I'm confirming it to
[1:17:51] you they have a chance
[1:17:53] I had mercy on them I gave them another
[1:17:55] opportunity to get right with God
[1:17:57] everybody see that easy gives them a
[1:17:59] double confirmation I'm not going to let
[1:18:01] it be three years I'm going to give them
[1:18:02] a fourth year I'm gonna have another
[1:18:05] double confirmation and another witness
[1:18:07] of my mercy and doesn't the Bible say
[1:18:09] that the Bible says because of God's
[1:18:12] long-suffering though the egg has an
[1:18:14] Africa the earth hasn't burned yet
[1:18:16] because of long suffering and so that's
[1:18:19] why God's long-suffering is it's a
[1:18:21] couple confirmation of his love waiting
[1:18:23] amen this patience praise the Lord
[1:18:25] hallelujah
[1:18:27] alright you like this one how many women
[1:18:30] were in Jesus of genealogy in Matthew
[1:18:31] chapter one how many how many how many
[1:18:33] one for it was Tamar Rahab Ruth
[1:18:39] Bathsheba so two or Jews two or Gentiles
[1:18:43] now to me this is a double confirmation
[1:18:45] that God is bringing equality in heaven
[1:18:49] between men and women that's that's what
[1:18:51] I think it is because remember Paul said
[1:18:53] in Galatians 3:28 in Christ there's
[1:18:56] neither female or male or male nor
[1:18:58] female in other words a woman is just as
[1:19:01] valuable to God as a man is now do they
[1:19:05] have different jobs on the earth of
[1:19:06] course you know a woman could never
[1:19:07] leave a church you know a man could
[1:19:09] never be a mother you know we know she
[1:19:11] might have to you know if them up if the
[1:19:13] mother died but you know what I mean a
[1:19:14] man could never have a baby I want you
[1:19:17] to show you that God gave a double
[1:19:19] confirmation that he could redeem women
[1:19:21] and he was bringing them full equality
[1:19:24] in eternal life aren't you glad God
[1:19:26] doesn't just give men eternal life
[1:19:28] aren't you glad scissors I'm glad God
[1:19:30] his men eternal life and we're very
[1:19:32] thankful for that this is a double
[1:19:34] confirmation of God's mercy in this
[1:19:36] grace amen
[1:19:37] I remember I think about how think about
[1:19:40] the awful past some of these women had
[1:19:42] number Taylor over all her husband's
[1:19:44] over her husband and her husband's
[1:19:47] brothers died so she deceived Judah by
[1:19:51] dressing up like a prostitute you
[1:19:52] remember that well she dresses just to
[1:19:54] bring the seed and God thought so much
[1:19:57] of her because he Jude had broken the
[1:19:59] word and she's just trying to get the
[1:20:01] word fulfilled right to have a husband
[1:20:03] and to raise up a name for this seed
[1:20:06] I thought so much of her he puts her in
[1:20:08] the lineage of Jesus Christ because
[1:20:12] Judah was breaking the word and so she
[1:20:14] honored the word oh my
[1:20:16] we know Rahab she was a prostitute but
[1:20:19] because she said oh I know you're God's
[1:20:20] an awesome God
[1:20:21] oh my
[1:20:27] lied to them Mikey right believe you
[1:20:30] shouldn't lie guys and then put her in
[1:20:33] the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:20:34] oh my well of course we know Russia they
[1:20:37] didn't do nothing wrong
[1:20:38] she was the she was the model of all
[1:20:40] godliness and virtue and holiness and
[1:20:42] God put a Moabite right I'm all by who
[1:20:45] they were not supposed to enter the
[1:20:47] household of God for all those
[1:20:48] generations God put a Moabite woman into
[1:20:51] this lineage that lasted Bathsheba
[1:20:54] guilty of adultery guilty of all these
[1:20:56] things but God puts her in the very
[1:20:58] lineage of Jesus oh god is rich in mercy
[1:21:01] we should just rejoice and how much God
[1:21:03] can forgive us amen hallelujah gives us
[1:21:06] a double confirmation of his love all
[1:21:09] right
[1:21:10] I got no matter so much here I'm fast
[1:21:14] I'm it had to pick it up blooming Eve
[1:21:16] has mentioned four times in the Bible
[1:21:19] it's a double confirmation of her air so
[1:21:22] we can learn from her airs just like a
[1:21:23] woman number Jesus and remember Lot's
[1:21:25] wife but she was mentioned so we learned
[1:21:28] from her so Eve is mentioned more times
[1:21:30] to give a double confirmation of her
[1:21:32] heirs the first time she's mentioned her
[1:21:35] name is she's the mother of all living
[1:21:37] so this shows she was the mother of Cain
[1:21:39] the Serpent's see Genesis 4:1 Eve bare
[1:21:44] Cain got the man from the Lord this show
[1:21:46] she's either to see that Cain is a godly
[1:21:48] boy because he wasn't so he was either
[1:21:50] deceived or she was recognizing that
[1:21:53] even Cain's life his human life came
[1:21:56] from God so I'm not sure which one it is
[1:21:58] brother Branham says both yes she says
[1:21:59] both I'm not sure which one could be
[1:22:01] both as well the third time she's met
[1:22:05] mark mention is in 2nd Corinthians 11:3
[1:22:07] as the serpent beguiled Eve Paul said
[1:22:11] your mind should be correct I'm fearful
[1:22:13] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:22:15] simplicity that's in Christ and this
[1:22:17] gives us a confirmation that Eve lost
[1:22:19] her virginity through deception because
[1:22:22] Paul said the church is a chaste virgin
[1:22:25] but I fear lest by any means you should
[1:22:29] be corrupted from the simplicity that's
[1:22:30] in Christ
[1:22:32] and lastly first thing when they too
[1:22:35] said then Eve the woman being deceived
[1:22:36] was in the transgression
[1:22:38] she cannot preach the word because she
[1:22:40] was deceived
[1:22:41] away from the word so those are the four
[1:22:43] witnesses of Eve as a double
[1:22:45] confirmation so we understand why she
[1:22:48] fell
[1:22:50] okay the rainbow how many times is the
[1:22:52] rainbow mentioned the Bible or two in
[1:22:55] the Old Testament Genesis 9 is equal one
[1:22:57] and then twice the New Testament both of
[1:23:00] Revelation the rainbow round about the
[1:23:03] throne some four times this is a double
[1:23:05] confirmation that God keeps his word God
[1:23:07] keeps his covenant Satan has four titles
[1:23:10] to double confirm his identity so we
[1:23:13] were not mistaken well I wonder if
[1:23:14] Satan's a serpent or the dragon Satan in
[1:23:17] Revelation 20 verse 2 is called Satan
[1:23:19] that old dragon that old serpent the
[1:23:21] devil he sends warnings here's a double
[1:23:24] confirmation he was the dragon
[1:23:26] he's the serpent he's the devil he's
[1:23:28] Satan Philip had for merging daughters
[1:23:32] which did prophesy so forth and I said
[1:23:35] perhaps I don't know for sure
[1:23:36] perhaps this is a double confirmation of
[1:23:39] his ministry maybe God will double
[1:23:41] confirm Philips ministry so he gave more
[1:23:43] daughters that prophesied a couple more
[1:23:48] okay here's the earthly number in revit
[1:23:51] Matthew 24:31 in revelation 7 1 through
[1:23:54] 12 the electors are gathered from the
[1:23:56] four winds and the four winds had to be
[1:23:59] held into the 144,000 or seals there's
[1:24:02] four winds the four angels that angel
[1:24:05] sent on the four corners of the earth
[1:24:07] holding the four winds and did you know
[1:24:10] the earth has four quarters as well
[1:24:13] now quarters doesn't mean a quarter
[1:24:16] doesn't mean like a fourth right it
[1:24:19] means like territory it means I actually
[1:24:21] have the actual word here
[1:24:23] it means space or territory so it's I do
[1:24:28] not believe the earth is flat I do not
[1:24:30] believe the earth is a rectangle or
[1:24:33] square I don't believe that I believe
[1:24:34] it's a globe believe it's a sphere but I
[1:24:37] see sometimes the Bible uses words but
[1:24:39] it uses them and it weighs differently
[1:24:41] than we use them so let me let me show
[1:24:43] that did you know Jesus said he said
[1:24:46] this the Pharisees love to pray standing
[1:24:48] in the synagogues in the corners of the
[1:24:51] streets
[1:24:53] so see there's a time where corner
[1:24:54] doesn't mean like a corner on the on a
[1:24:58] figure the Pharisees were over in the
[1:25:00] corner frame so they could be seen they
[1:25:02] were right in the middle of the of the
[1:25:04] street to be seen so if the Bible says
[1:25:07] the earth has four corners that doesn't
[1:25:09] mean corners like on the edge of a
[1:25:10] sphere I'm sorry on corners on the edge
[1:25:12] of a rectangular prism or something like
[1:25:15] that or cube it doesn't mean those kind
[1:25:17] of corners
[1:25:19] it can mean space it can mean territory
[1:25:21] so does everybody see that there's one
[1:25:23] more bread had to be clean out in the
[1:25:31] end of your quarters territory it
[1:25:34] doesn't mean like a quarter of a piece
[1:25:36] of pie or something like that or a
[1:25:37] corner of a fraction doesn't mean look
[1:25:40] at that okay
[1:25:41] so hopefully that helps you but with the
[1:25:42] four corners of the earth now I am
[1:25:45] planning on talking with somebody soon
[1:25:47] and maybe they can convince me by the
[1:25:49] scripture at the earth is flat I'm open
[1:25:52] to being corrected but I personally
[1:25:54] think it is a sphere but that's just
[1:25:58] like I said that's because of the
[1:25:59] scriptures that I showed you okay next
[1:26:03] how many soldiers crucified Christ they
[1:26:06] wouldn't know because the Bible said
[1:26:09] when they divided his Dharma it into
[1:26:12] four parts so he had porn and that was
[1:26:15] Myra force on earth day number so God
[1:26:18] was using that to show an earth day
[1:26:19] number all right next
[1:26:27] hides the people in the four groups
[1:26:30] thirties tongues lands nations because
[1:26:34] four is an earthly number so that family
[1:26:37] you know the people on earth are
[1:26:37] dividing those four groups four groups
[1:26:39] as Genesis 10:31 how many Gentile powers
[1:26:44] were on that image that Daniel saw in
[1:26:46] Daniel chapter 2 4 right Babylon needs
[1:26:50] the Persians Grecians and then role now
[1:26:54] in Daniel 7
[1:26:55] how many beasts were there there's four
[1:26:57] beasts the avilon was the lion Medes and
[1:27:01] Persians was the bear the grecian was
[1:27:04] were the leopard and it didn't say what
[1:27:06] the beast was for Rome we just said just
[1:27:08] describe the fourth beast and then tell
[1:27:09] you what it was but that's because of
[1:27:11] Revelation 13 all those beasts are
[1:27:13] combined into one beast and that's the
[1:27:15] Beast out of the sea the bees coming out
[1:27:18] of the sea remember it has like Paul's
[1:27:19] like a bear it's got teeth like a lion
[1:27:22] it's got feet like a leopard or
[1:27:24] something like that I forget the exact
[1:27:25] exactly the descriptions but can you see
[1:27:28] that those four beasts are now combined
[1:27:30] in Rome everybody can see that Rome and
[1:27:32] said that's because demons don't die
[1:27:34] people die but those demons remain right
[1:27:37] and they just move from one person to
[1:27:39] the next that's what happened with the
[1:27:41] Roman Catholic Church okay
[1:27:44] let me know how many kings that Abraham
[1:27:47] defeated before you met Melchizedek I
[1:27:49] mean he needs be remember what's
[1:27:53] communion with milk essica type of they
[1:27:55] were everyone remember the marriage
[1:27:58] supper of the Lamb here's at the
[1:28:00] marriage supper land after the rapture
[1:28:01] the marriage supper and lamb we're going
[1:28:03] to have communion the Bible said Jesus
[1:28:04] said I will eat that fruit afresh with
[1:28:07] you I'm sure I will drink of the vine
[1:28:08] with you afresh at the marriage supper
[1:28:10] of the Lamb so what four things do we
[1:28:13] have to conquer to get to the marriage
[1:28:15] supper of the Lamb the four horse riders
[1:28:17] remember they're combined into what one
[1:28:20] they're combined into the pail
[1:28:21] well Rams are those three are combined
[1:28:23] the four so just as Abraham had to
[1:28:25] defeat four kings Abraham's seed has to
[1:28:27] defeat four of those demon spirits he's
[1:28:30] got four powers the light the black and
[1:28:33] the red all into the pale we have to
[1:28:35] defeat those for my the grace of God
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:38] I love it don't you love it
[1:28:40] Oh lor its earthly number they had to
[1:28:42] defeat those earthly kings we have to
[1:28:44] defeat these earthly demon powers how
[1:28:47] many know how many unclean animals that
[1:28:48] were or camel hair or rabbit the cony
[1:28:55] which is called the hyrax today I've
[1:28:56] never heard of it till today yeah I
[1:29:01] thought the Coney dogs on Coney Island
[1:29:05] or whatever and then the pig or swine
[1:29:09] and that's in Deuteronomy fourteen
[1:29:11] seventy there's four on camels here's
[1:29:14] the picture of the hyrax it's kind of
[1:29:16] like a rabbit except but don't have ears
[1:29:19] um and no big tail no bushy tail either
[1:29:23] so all the other Bible dictionaries said
[1:29:26] this was a hyrax and they're actually in
[1:29:28] danger now I think people have hunted
[1:29:30] them for so long that they're endangered
[1:29:34] so now you know what a Kony is it's a hi
[1:29:36] Rex and who remembers why why did God
[1:29:38] think they were so wise and then
[1:29:40] remember why we're gonna go over it in
[1:29:41] just a minute
[1:29:42] because they live in the rocks they're a
[1:29:45] small animal
[1:29:46] but they're wise because they go hide in
[1:29:48] the rock in the cleft of the rock okay
[1:29:51] oh thank you Jesus okay oh there's so
[1:29:57] much I just go the faster I want to get
[1:30:00] these things I want to start five next
[1:30:01] week bye guys grace there was four
[1:30:05] judgments upon Jerusalem in Ezekiel the
[1:30:07] sword famine the beasts and pestilence
[1:30:09] there was four abominations in the
[1:30:12] temple the days of Ezekiel there was an
[1:30:14] image of jealousy at the entry doors
[1:30:16] once you got inside the wall this is in
[1:30:19] Ezekiel chapter 8 once you got inside
[1:30:21] the walls that was creeping things and
[1:30:23] idols on the walls and then there was 70
[1:30:26] men burning incense in there - all these
[1:30:30] images on the wall the third thing was
[1:30:33] women were weeping for Tammuz which is
[1:30:35] the deity for food at the door of the
[1:30:38] gate of the Lord's house because God had
[1:30:41] sent pestilence upon her so a famine
[1:30:44] upon them so they're weeping and crying
[1:30:45] out to their God and God said look at
[1:30:47] this abomination that was the third
[1:30:48] abomination the last abomination there
[1:30:51] was 25 men in the inner core
[1:30:53] near the altar and they turn their back
[1:30:55] to the altar of God and they were facing
[1:30:58] the East worshiping the Sun and God said
[1:31:00] that was the worst of all the
[1:31:02] abominations turning their backs on the
[1:31:04] blood right turn their backs on the
[1:31:06] blood and worshiping the creation rather
[1:31:08] than the Creator
[1:31:11] they're striking alright now there's
[1:31:14] four kinds of flesh you know that beasts
[1:31:16] like a dog or a tiger bird has a
[1:31:20] different kind of flesh fish and man
[1:31:22] four kinds of flesh this is beautiful
[1:31:27] there are four ways the human body is
[1:31:30] sown and raised in this is the first
[1:31:32] Corinthians 15 it's sown in corruption
[1:31:35] raising in corruption
[1:31:37] it's sown in dishonor raised and glory
[1:31:40] its sown in weakness raised in power and
[1:31:44] it's sown a natural body raised the
[1:31:46] spiritual baby
[1:31:47] oh it's earthly number this earthly body
[1:31:51] as those four negatives but then it has
[1:31:53] more positives on the other side oh
[1:31:55] thank you Jesus Jesus had four
[1:31:58] prohibitions to his preachers when he
[1:32:00] sent them out take no purse take no
[1:32:03] script which is food no purse money no
[1:32:05] shoes and don't salute any minute that's
[1:32:08] how focused they were supposed to be
[1:32:10] don't worry about food and worry about
[1:32:11] your shoes
[1:32:12] don't worry about money no we're about
[1:32:14] talking to anybody just go right to the
[1:32:16] city where I sent you and preach the
[1:32:17] word of named earthly number earthly
[1:32:20] number see that an earthly focus about
[1:32:22] the gospel little things in proverbs 30
[1:32:29] system the first are ends why are ants
[1:32:31] wise remember they work in the summer
[1:32:35] that's why they're wise they gather
[1:32:37] their food in the summer so the winner
[1:32:38] isn't as bad
[1:32:40] cody's their feeble but why are they so
[1:32:43] wise because they live in the class of
[1:32:46] the rock amen
[1:32:47] and we gotta hide ours if we got we stay
[1:32:49] alive we got a hiding Christ amen right
[1:32:52] in his righteousness
[1:32:53] I didn't his life his forgiveness the
[1:32:55] next thing is locusts they have no king
[1:32:57] but why are their wise because they're
[1:32:59] divided up into groups of bands the
[1:33:01] Bible says they go by man's so maybe 100
[1:33:04] here under there under there right
[1:33:06] that's
[1:33:07] why they're so wise they don't have a
[1:33:08] king but they know how to divide this
[1:33:09] dividing conquer right and the last
[1:33:13] thing is a spider spider so wise because
[1:33:16] it's so small you can find it in King's
[1:33:18] palaces it's so small and quiet you'll
[1:33:21] find it in a king's palace we find them
[1:33:24] about every quarter dude yeah there's
[1:33:26] some right there it is so quiet yeah
[1:33:29] they're so still and quiet and that
[1:33:31] shows what works quiet and still it
[1:33:33] shows a lot of wisdom
[1:33:34] I remember brother grant with that
[1:33:36] scripture above his pulpit said be still
[1:33:38] and know that I am God there's so much
[1:33:41] wisdom in being silent and waiting on
[1:33:43] God with full assurance okay almost I'm
[1:33:46] almost done this is good in the
[1:33:51] tabernacle Moses there was three things
[1:33:53] that were Foursquare the brazen altar
[1:33:55] where they birthed the animals the Urim
[1:33:57] and Thummim which he wore on the pre
[1:33:59] high priests wore on his breast and then
[1:34:02] the altar of incense where he burnt the
[1:34:04] incense and let the smoke rise into the
[1:34:06] holy suppose three of them work for
[1:34:08] sweater the New Jerusalem is Foursquare
[1:34:13] how do you know that it's got a base
[1:34:15] that's four square with equal length
[1:34:17] breadth and height it's four square so
[1:34:20] this is these fours are earthly numbers
[1:34:22] I love this and that's uh I'm gonna
[1:34:26] close with well let me go to these last
[1:34:28] few so go to second guardians for eight
[1:34:30] this is going to encourage you I know
[1:34:32] what does it really encourage anything
[1:34:34] sacred ends for eat this kind of goes
[1:34:40] along with Romans chapter five that we
[1:34:43] read last week about remember others for
[1:34:45] Hope or four steps to divine hope
[1:34:46] remember that there's four steps so you
[1:34:48] have divine hope or you're I'm sorry
[1:34:50] deliverance through hope let's look at
[1:34:53] Romans 4 8 and 9 in this scripture
[1:34:59] earthly suffering is fourfold but yet
[1:35:02] we're promised we can overcome it
[1:35:04] amen so maybe tonight you'll see
[1:35:07] yourself in one of these forms of
[1:35:09] persecutions but take courage you can
[1:35:12] overcome each one okay so the first one
[1:35:16] we are troubled on every side yet we're
[1:35:19] not
[1:35:21] amen so trouble but not distressed
[1:35:25] I've got troubles but I'm not upset
[1:35:27] about it we are perplexed but not in
[1:35:31] despair so they're confused about some
[1:35:33] things but they're not despair without
[1:35:36] hope right they're persecuted but
[1:35:39] they're not forsaken by God they're not
[1:35:41] a man that God is still with you know
[1:35:43] God's with you tonight no matter what
[1:35:45] you're going through no matter of
[1:35:46] persecution or trials you're never
[1:35:48] forsaken he's never abandoned you he's
[1:35:52] right there with you and lastly you
[1:35:54] might feel cast down you might get
[1:35:56] thrown down to this ground you might get
[1:35:58] thrown down to the ground by your
[1:35:59] friends and and just stomped on and made
[1:36:02] fun up but you are not destroyed amen
[1:36:05] they cannot your enemies cannot destroy
[1:36:07] your Saint cannot destroy her so we have
[1:36:09] this fourfold suffering but we have a
[1:36:13] fourfold promise as well that what Satan
[1:36:16] tries to accomplish he will not
[1:36:17] accomplish will overcome all four
[1:36:20] obstacles amen I thought you like that
[1:36:23] you like that is that energy praise God
[1:36:25] you can be trouble but not distressed
[1:36:26] you can be perplexed but not despair you
[1:36:28] can be persecuted but not forsaken you
[1:36:30] can be cast down but not destroyed Oh
[1:36:32] glory glory glory glory okay I got about
[1:36:36] I got six more I'll go try five more how
[1:36:39] they go fast four is a number of
[1:36:42] deliverance who members at an age in the
[1:36:44] days of Salman what did he do to get
[1:36:46] deliverance he was gonna die but he ran
[1:36:49] to something that had four corners why
[1:36:54] was that he ran down there and that was
[1:36:56] in first Kings one he ran down and
[1:36:58] grabbed ahold of the horns of the altar
[1:36:59] and Solomon said okay I'm not going to
[1:37:02] kill you because you fear God see he
[1:37:05] recognized there's deliverance at at the
[1:37:08] altar why because that's where your
[1:37:09] sacrifice was burned and that's where
[1:37:11] your sins were taking care of an author
[1:37:12] so he ran down there and loved those
[1:37:14] horns Solomon said he must fear God he's
[1:37:17] delivered but remember what happened he
[1:37:19] tried to he tried to take over Solomon
[1:37:21] again he ran out of the horns and
[1:37:23] Solomon killed him because he's / mercy
[1:37:26] he did it one too many times so because
[1:37:30] he tried to take the kingdom from
[1:37:31] Solomon saw himself review this time he
[1:37:33] again and Solomon said this time I'm not
[1:37:35] gonna have mercy
[1:37:37] remember that same I'm not saying
[1:37:40] whether there's a there's a reality to
[1:37:42] that altar it's in heaven the Bible says
[1:37:44] that in Revelation 19:13
[1:37:46] there's four horns on the golden altar
[1:37:48] which is in heaven I wonder if Jesus
[1:37:50] sits on that throne tonight they made an
[1:37:52] altar and admin with orthros showing
[1:37:54] their deliverance through the four horns

[1:39:15] 4
[1:39:16] Palmer worm locust cankerworm
[1:39:19] caterpillar was the port and brother
[1:39:21] Graham said those also represent the
[1:39:24] four horse riders hey you have to
[1:39:27] remember that they represent that
[1:39:28] because mother Graham said they're the
[1:39:30] same insect in the restoration of the
[1:39:31] bride tree 1962 police said they're just
[1:39:34] advanced stages all right in the last
[1:39:38] one Satan imitated four there were four
[1:39:42] men who took a vow to kill Paul they
[1:39:44] said I'm not gonna eat they said we're
[1:39:46] not gonna eat until Paul's dead or so
[1:39:49] Satan tried to impersonate that forward
[1:39:51] and try to put all this intimidation on
[1:39:53] Paul but Paul overcame by the blood of
[1:39:56] Jesus soon remember his nephew his
[1:39:59] nephew saved a little humble nephew a
[1:40:01] teenager
[1:40:02] save this great mighty prophet of God by
[1:40:05] telling Paul about it then Paul Ryan
[1:40:07] told the man he said I'm a Roman citizen
[1:40:09] and then where they let him out in the
[1:40:11] basket on the window and saved in my
[1:40:13] God's grace let's stand here by God's
[1:40:15] grace
