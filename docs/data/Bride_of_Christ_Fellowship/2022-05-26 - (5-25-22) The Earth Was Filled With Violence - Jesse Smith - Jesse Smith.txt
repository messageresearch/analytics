TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's go to genesis chapter 6. i'd like to just you know preach a little bit on the condition of this world i don't want to get off the regular topics and i just want to preach on them the earth was filled with violence just wanted to preach all that title here tonight the earth was filled with violence genesis chapter 6 verse 11. genesis 6 11. i was surprised to learn churchill an estimate today it was estimated three to four billion people died in the flood at the end there was only one family left that really believed the word of god all other minds all their families the reminder is filled with imaginations of wickedness all the time jesus said as it was in the days of noah so shall be the days that come into the same man genesis 6 11. i'll read and then we'll read verse 13 together here the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth verse 13 let's read that together one two three and god said unto noah the beginning of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold behold i will destroy one more word of prayer here heavenly father god we ask you god to anoint us god for your glory yes lord we just pray in your spirit god speak here tonight oh god in each and every heart here for your glory we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for your protection father god we pray and for the hurting people lord in this nation and lord i just pray god you give us your leadership here tonight in jesus christ the earth was filled with violence phone i'll just text it to you real quick so thank you yeah it's on right now silky so hopefully she'll be on just a few minutes god bless sister uh stephanie and all the livestreamers god bless everybody the earth was filled with violence we know uh the scripture is repeating in this day and we know every two thousand years god has to do something to the earth the first two thousand years god had to destroy three to four billion people that's half the world's population that we have today three to four billion people probably died during the flood of noah's day every heart every imagination except one family had totally been given over to uh the bible says violence the bible also says marrying and giving to marriage right the sons of god saw the daughters of men the godly scene line was choosing to marry based upon looks rather than character and so god had become fed up with it god had given two thousand years of grace two thousand years of grace two thousand and here we are it's about two thousand years of grace as well right since that great second major event the second event was the greatest event of all time it was the death of jesus christ and his resurrection hallelujah the greatest event there ever was the greatest weekend there ever was amen and brother ham says you know the cross was the greatest day then sometimes he says or then other times he says the resurrection was the greatest day so i just say the greatest weekend amen hallelujah they're both they're all the great days they're the whole weekend but then jesus said in luke 17 26 we're very familiar we can probably all quote it by heart as it was in there of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they didn't eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day the lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be and the day when the son of man is revealed praise god the word of god is true i know jesus prophesied these days amen he prophesied of it and so we see the first two thousand years flood next two thousand years the blood of christ the last two thousand years it's going to be a fire baptism for the earth right god's gonna come and destroy the outside of the earth he's going to renovate the earth the earth's crust with fire right atomic fire the bible has a fervent heat yeah right but the man said it made he said it might be volcanic ashes volcanic fire as well that's right from the heart of the earth he said it could be uh atomic fire so it could be a combination but he's going to burn uh the outside the perimeter with fire and start all again by the grace of god the bible says the righteous thank god your righteous church the righteous will walk upon the ashes of the wicked my goodness hallelujah bye the earth is filled with the reason uh the the god had to send the flood is because the people hated god they didn't want to retain the word of god they didn't want to listen to noah's preaching they don't listen to enoch's preaching right we saw last week because they're ungodly deeds and they're ungodly words they're ungodly speeches god had to come in and destroy them right with the flood of noah's day romans 1 28 says they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind and do those things which are not convenient so the root problem is hatred for god being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetous maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whispers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them right they just you know on social media they'll just clap on all the people that that continue to speak evil things they'll clap on abortions they'll clap on uh uh any evil wars and unjustified wars and lies they'll just clap on any evil thing and homosexuality and transgenderism they'll just clap and they have pleasure in them that do them that's the state of the world that we see today and ultimately they hate the word of god right but we love the word of god praise god amen we're standing for the word of god true in this dark day just like noah's day amen we're not the type of noah but we're the type of enoch amen right that type of enoch brother but it's a wicked day the saint the bible said murders jesus said murders originate from the hearts of men in mark 7 21 for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders and so we see where it originates in the heart of man now in mark 15 7 it's a it's the uh the text of mark in the gospel where jesus is on trial before pilate and the people are given two choices they're given jesus or barabbas right right but the rap said you were the barabbas yeah and the church said amen i'm gonna preach that maybe next year for uh for easter and good friday the man said we were all barabbas but they were given a choice in verse seven and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with them who committed murder in the insurrection and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them and pilate answered them saying will ye that i released on you the king of the jews for he that for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy but the chief priest moved the people that he should release barabbas unto them now the people were given a choice do you want a murderer or an innocent do-gooder an innocent pure man to win a murder or a pure word and they said give us the murder in church the same is produced today praise god the united states and every other nation would rather have murderers than jesus christ the word how do you know because they kicked jesus christ out of this out of the schools they take jesus christ out of the businesses out of the government courtrooms all right yeah and i'll say like this they kicked him out of the churches amen but not our church amen jesus welcome here hallelujah he's always welcome here amen hallelujah brother says when he gets here then you got to welcome him here praise god amen when he comes you got to make him feel welcome kiss the son lest he be angry we must make it when we feel his presence we must make him feel good make him feel welcome entertain the holy spirit amen hallelujah the u.s would rather have murders than jesus christ they'd rather have that because if they had jesus christ they'd have the word of god but they turned on the word of god and so this is the effects that we're reaping and sowing today rather reaping today the bible said these are works of the flesh in galatians 5 19. it is the flesh that wants to murder it is the flesh that wants to be violent it is not the soul of a believer it says the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication and cleanness lasheviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred hatred variants emulations wrath stripes additions heresies endings murders drunkenness revelings and such life of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in the past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god when a man or woman lets these wicked things come out of their lives without repentance god will keep them out of his kingdom those things have no place in his kingdom his kingdom is a holy kingdom amen his kingdom is a righteous kingdom this is a kingdom of grace amen this is a kingdom of goodness hallelujah and mercy hallelujah and he'll keep anyone who does the works of the flesh to keep any one of them out because they live in the flesh rather than living to the soul yes hallelujah the real problem of course is the wickedness in the heart of man first john 3 15 says whosoever hated this brother is a murderer and you know that no murder half eternal life abiding in him so what is the difference between us and the world the difference between us is that we have eternal life praise god we have a source of strength inside of us that the world doesn't have they can't understand it but we receive the life of god and it makes us cry abba father amen when you have a life of god when you're a child of god it makes you cry to the father and it makes you intercede to the father it makes you talk to the father it makes you long for the father amen it makes you want to keep in contact with the father hallelujah amen but murders have not this life no i'm not going to go this direction but church we can murder people with our words right we know that we can kill their influence and all we have to do is say lord jesus forgive me i'm sorry take that out of my heart amen that quote he said if you're going into meeting with somebody he said and you don't love him he said first tell them i don't love you and let's pray so i can love you because if i don't love you i can't help you right that's what he says be honest with people if you don't love them tell them and then be honest with god say god put love in my heart amen so i can love people i'm trying to help praise god that's the real difference is love love makes all the difference so love is eternal life but murders have not love in their hearts so the real problem is love of sin and it's a hatred for god and his word now church some of you may know this or not i don't know you might not there's been hundreds and hundreds of school shootings yes and also subway shootings and anywhere just mass shootings we'll just call it like that hundreds and hundreds and i went and uh as i was studying this you know today i thought where did all this start and it goes back to 1995. now there's there's other other mass killings different things but as far as this recent generation there was a movie called the basketball diaries i never watched it thank god i never watched it uh leonardo dicaprio's in it he's this famous guy as a wicked man as far as we know and in the movie they glamorize shooting up a school two years later 1970s or 1997 there was a mass shooting in kentucky that the the the boys that did it did exactly like the movie the the victims went and sued the movie theater and won over hundreds of million dollars so so so it's obvious people mimic what they see right and then think of columbine i was alive i was in high school in colombia that was a very strange a very strange time when the columbine shooting happened in colorado and it's just been going to universities and schools and sonny hook and connecticut i mean there's so many happen we just forget about because there's so many where does this start it starts why by satan planting these thoughts in people's minds and the people don't cast these thoughts down they they take a reprobate mind they choose to hate the word of god if they let the word of god retain in their minds they would they would have love in their hearts hallelujah if they retain the love of god in their hearts and minds they fear god but instead they they take god all other minds and they put these evil songs and now now it's in video games of course uh covers of course in benson's then but it's so much in video games and movies and music and church i just saw the statistic the other day teenagers spend at least four hours on uh online or tv every day four hours four hours you think that's all good stuff it's all trash amen yeah and they're at school for seven hours a day and how much of that time are they getting this evil stuff put in there all the conversations they're having think of that how much time do they actually talk to their parents in there probably like one minute or less than that 30 seconds yeah so the devil is pouring in hour after hour of poison and they get one or two minutes and then like roman says then you take them to church for sunday school and you expect them to be perfect or expect them to turn out good whatever you put in the child is gonna come out praise god now it's not a guarantee every time but the bible says if you train up a child in the ways it goes and when it's not old it'll not turn from it praise god there's probability the probability is if you put the word of god in the church does not put this on children let's put it on all of us if we put the before that i do want to go show about the united states i wrote this in my book my second book speaking of america's history like israel america quickly fell from her god very beginnings in the roaring 20s think of that right less than 140 something years after starting the roaring 20s saw the rise of rebellious women who cut their hair wore makeup for the first time mini skirts smoked and dance in defiance of god's holiness and we're not just putting on the women the men let them do it sure the men the ones the men are the ones that opened up the the the clubs so they could do it right they could have shut it down remember we saw that on mother's day who gets the word who gets the worst absolute worst judgment it's men it's evil leaders jesus said you pharisees will have the greater condemnation right because you led all these people astray they have the authority they had the ability they had the key to the door but they kept they kept themselves out and they kept other people out jesus greater damnation will you have all right oh but much more great rewards will have for swinging that door open wide and say come into the kingdom of god let the little children come unto me praise god amen hallelujah glory most men stood there and they liked it they permitted it with weakness and fear and shame holly wrote hollywood rose to claim during the great depression of the 1930s usher in this court this cultural corruption the 1950s brought in elvis presley rock and roll planted the seeds for the sexual revolution of the 1960s jfk was elected in 1960 in 1962 prayer was taken out of schools abortion was uh legalized in 1973 there's been 64 or 65 abortions i'm sorry 64 65 million abortions since 1973 the church how how much is that cup of iniquity filling up here tonight how much is that cup of iniquity 63 million worldwide abortion since 1973. remember the bible says all those all those voices cry the blood cries to god from the earth homosexuality was moved out of the list of mental disorders in 1973 and then on june 26 2015 the supreme court legalized this abomination look how fast and look how far the nation has fallen since they took god out of everything every morning though at school when i when we said the pledge means i was pointing by saying one nation under god i let all the kids see me because i know we're still one nation under god as long as i got a chance to share it i'm gonna share it by god's grace i'm gonna say that extra louder under god amen hallelujah our constitutional right praise god now it's fallen so fast we see that i want to now move back here to the scripture because some people say that uh the bible is very violent and that's true but god has a purpose behind it yeah sure now i got this from a preacher john piper of course i don't agree with much of what he says but i used to like him a lot before i come in the message he lists three reasons why the bible's so violent and actually the most violent book of all is probably the book of judges so he says the first reason so violent because it shows what happens when there's no civil authority there's no king and there was no prophet in those days yeah so when you don't have a king and you have a prophet and you don't have retribution for wickedness men and women will do about anything they will they will fall so far so fast there's no limits to the wickedness that they do if there's not a godly king and a prophet on the scene so why is the bible so violent it shows you what happens when there's no civil authority and there's no prophet in the land second violence on the earth shows how awful rebellion against god truly is that's what violence actually shows it actually shows how awful it is to deny the word of god right it shows us the of sin and it all started with adam and eve yeah so that's why the bible has to be violent it shows this is what happens this is the effect of disobeying the word of god amen all men die in adam glory but all men are made alive in christ jesus amen hallelujah thank god thank god for christ jesus amen now i'm going to say the third one to the end that's what i'm going to close with that's the best one now church the bible is extremely violent i'm just gonna give you some examples as i said the days of noah's flood three to four billion men and women drunk children animals that's not good animals that's just humans did you know 500 000 men died in israel's civil war under king jeroboam 500 000. that's in second chronicles chapter 13. now that's a little less than our american civil war so i looked up some online mailchimp right now about that more than i would but 600 000 anywhere to 1.5 million of our own men of our own americans but israel had these awful mass deaths as well remember with the many nights how many died 120 000 yeah midnight died in that one battle then i think there was 15 000 more that gideon and his his sword took care of there's many many examples let me read a couple more here i found this it looks like a reliable website it's the ones i looked at it was pretty reliable 185 000 were instantly destroyed by god in second kings 18 and 19. it was king senator remember when he come against your host of fat joseph like what do i do lord he said just praise the lord in the house of god a prophet came in and said just praise the lord amen hallelujah while they were worshiping the angel lord went out and destroyed all those 185 000 men died at one one one day the syrian men that died and israel did not have to fire a single arrow in their defense amen god was fighting for his people amen now 140 000 plus died in another civil war in judges chapter 20. remember when the benjamites did this wickedness and all the other tribes went up against the vengeance right because of the wicked they did to the the man's concubine right 140 plus thousand died in that civil war 127 000 syrians were killed by ahab in first kings chapter 20. over 100 000 syrian foot men and then 27 000 others died in that battle 127 000. now this one is really shocking as well seventy thousand israelites died as a punishment when david did his sentence and numbered the people remember god gave him a choice remember that is it gonna be you is it gonna come upon you and you and you but he said just let it be the three days of pestilence yes three days of festivals seventy thousand remember twenty four thousand died after the plague of male pior twenty four thousand died in one day 24 000. now church the bible is clear it is god's will that not one little one perish matthew 18 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish amen to that amen it's not god's will it's not god's perfect will right if you look at verse 10 matthew 18 verse 10 take heed that he despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven they're angels who always behold the faith of my father which is in heaven so these are scriptures we believe we believe them with all of our hearts but god has to allow free more agency he has to or else he will be unjust on the day of judgment right if not a person can say well you made me do this you can't send me to hell because you made me murder these people no i'm saying no i didn't no i let you be tempted but everybody was everybody was tested i said i i let you be i allowed it i allowed it to happen because everybody must be tempted everybody must be tested because our life is a trial of our faith right it's a trial to live by the holy spirit or the unholy spirit which spirit do you want to live by you only by hatred or do you want to live by love we're living by the love of god today praise god amen amen it's not the will of god that one of these little ones should perish thank you lord now remember there's four reasons god allows suffering went over on uh sunday night but uh not everybody heard it first god allows suffering for self knowledge you understand you you have knowledge of yourself better and you can judge yourself better right if we suffer physically it helps us to understand the effects of our sin what it does to other people right when we suffer we can say wow this this this cold or this was really awful or this covered was really awful or whatever we suffered with but that reminds us of the effects of sin it reminds us that our sin has done awful things against god's word so we judge ourselves and we see the evil effects of our own sins and it brings humility to us that's the first reason so you have a self-knowledge of yourself and a self-judgment you can judge yourself well because i did this i would because this happened to me i'll never do that to anybody else i suffered and so because i suffered i'm going to make sure nobody suffers like that right amen the second reason we suffer is to learn obedience like jesus sometimes god if we don't obey god give a spanking after scourging after scourging until we finally learn to obey praise god we've been better off but we would have done it the first time the church said amen sometimes we won't obey so god's got to make us suffer so we will obey third we suffer because it brings greater greater fruitfulness the bible said jesus suffered like no man ever suffered but the bible said because of that he was exalted to a place higher than the heavens amen amen he said because he died alone the bible said he would see his seed hallelujah he would see the generations after the multitudes and men's the believers that would come after him this he would see and see because that one holy see would plant it that sea would multiply thanks god amen amen and then we suffer so we can be a testimony to other people true well brother you know you struggle with this well listen i struggle with that too but i overcome you can overcome amen remember the bible said god will not give you a test that you can't overcome i'm so glad he put those limits on him praise god i'm so glad he put a limit and said god won't let brother jesse be tempted where he couldn't handle it it's too much for him no no i can handle everyone because i can do some things through christ who strengthens me no i can do all things through christ who strengthens me hallelujah i just like this scripture luke uh you pope luke 2 30 2 34 2 35 this was at jesus dedication and simeon blessed them and said unto mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against so this for a sign jesus christ lived here for a sign yeah a sword shall pierce through his own thy own soul speaking of mary also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed praise god so jesus was manifested and his life was a sign and it showed his life made you decide which side you're going to be on right it was a sign to everybody this is a holy man this is god's son this is the son of god surely this man was a son of god and it was a sign and it reveals that the hearts your our response to that reveals our hearts today hallelujah so it is today a christian's life today a christian that lives the right kind of life their life is a sign hallelujah not only are you a witness that helped other people but you're a sign for good you're a sign that people can look at and say there's a real believer i know i know there's one it's sister so-and-so right it's brother so-and-so praise the lord and you have to live a life so your life manifests and then it reveals the people around you reveals what's in their hearts amen that's true that's true so sometimes you have to suffer right so that hearts can be revealed around you right and that kind of goes that thought of the perhaps people will be saved right when you suffer someone might come to your health or your aid they might come to secure you the bible says yes to help you out and that will reveal what's in people's hearts and lives amen amen so those are four reasons god allows suffering how but i put a fifth in there to manifest the desire of each heart for that that could be a lap over but it could be part of one of the other ones like jesus's life and ministry did it manifested it revealed what was in the hearts of the people and so it is today church with violence we see today or these uh all the awful things going around the world it manifests what's in people's heart whatever side they take on it it shows what's in their heart yeah it's easy to tell what's in people's heart it's easy to tell if good things are in their hearts or of evil things in their hearts see god allows suffering because he must allow free more agency and either fill up your cup of blessing or fill up the cup of iniquity is that right genesis 15 15 and i shall go to thy fathers in peace speaking of abraham thou shalt be buried in good old age but in the fourth generation so 400 years later they shall come again hither for the iniquity the amorites is not yet full so in 400 years finally the cup of the amorites is going to be filled up so god said i'll not these people are wicked in the canaan's land but i'm not going to judge them for 400 years left our nation's had over 250 years we're getting close to the cup being full praise god yeah and with technology and people living longer that allows more deaths to happen because people live longer right and so it's filling up now the last mention i could find of the amorites was in uh solomon's time in second chronicles eight well chronicles eight seven seven chronicles eight seven as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute unto this day so god held off the wrath but once israel went in the promised land god started pouring out his wrath god started pouring out temporary judgments upon all these nations he let it go for so long let it go for so long and then god then come down full and god poured out the wrath upon them true praise god god in other words god was so merciful praise god he was so rich in mercy giving them hundreds and hundreds of years to repent but wait until the time was right and then some of them even survived some of them a small remnant of each of these ones survived church ezekiel 33 11 says say it say unto them as i live say the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn the eternity from your evil ways but why will you die or house of israel yeah god didn't delight not having to pour out those judges no no it's not something you look forward to no no the bible is thus saith the lord saith the lord god this is thus saith the lord in other words if god allowed them to be destroyed then then god had given them so many times so much time that god knew they were not going to turn back now sure let it go as far as it can go all right i've got to intervene here but he does not delight in that that's why even preachers or christians or anyone that delights in the death of the wicked they got a wrong spirit they don't have the holy spirit because jesus even from the cross what'd he say father condemned them he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing i know there's other times you talked about the children of hell with the pharisees and things like that but you gotta bounce you gotta you gotta include the other ones too praise god you gotta include all of them you gotta look at all them let's look at a few scriptures here uh on another thought here today was a busy day so you forgive me my notes are they're all like oh look i gotta find them they're not the right order i'll say it like that so forgive me now i got this from the living waters website my kids are like the living waters website we like that website it's called why do bad things happen to good people i just i'll read this yeah i'll quote this website he says why do bad things happen to good people the biblical answer is there are no good people except jesus amen in mark 10 18 jesus said that only god is good because god is good he will see to it that justice is done on the day of judgment if god gave each of us justice now every one of us would end up in a terrible place called hell and we would all deserve it didn't i just read you on sunday brother said i'm not worthy to live church said amen i'm not worthy i'm not fit to live right everyone deserves judgment because their own rebellion to the word of god he said god is the standard of righteousness and all of us have fallen short of that standard there aren't really any good people that bad things happen to a better question is why does god allow good things to happen to bad people yeah why does god allow good things to happen to bad people that's a better question right and that's because that's what god said jesus said be like your heavenly father he sends rain on what the good and the evil the just and the unjust why would god send rain on unjust people but he does sure he does because he's merciful long suffering it says with reasons known only only to god he demonstrated his love for us and the fact that while we were yet sinners christ died for us amen in spite of our evil wicked sinful nature god still loves us he loved us enough to die to take the penalty for our sins when he was crucified on the cross often things happen to us that we simply cannot understand instead of doubting god's goodness in times of suffering we should trust him we should echo the words of job though he slay me yet will i trust him amen praise the lord the book of job shows us that god is trustworthy amen even though we don't understand the surroundings around us praise god amen this ends with this i like it kind of kind of brings it back to full circle why do bad things happen to good people he said that only happened once and he volunteered for it that was jesus amen bad things only happened to one good person that was jesus christ amen praise god you know uh about seven years ago when we first moved in here or was it in there i can't remember we used to have a brother come to the church named kevin i know you remember brother kevin his 18 year old son was killed in a motorcycle accident and uh he come up for prayer one time after i preached he said he said brother jesse he said this is just such a weight on me he said can you pray for me and church i don't know what it was in that moment but in that moment i felt like i had lost a son and we wept together wow right together he thanked me numerous times after that of course he left the church right we loved him but at the wedding the last wedding we went to stephen's wedding some of the people from the church that that's his home church now they come up to me and said wait you're the brother that brother kevin talks about all the time that prayed with him and he said god gave him a real touch when you prayed for him praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah bless the lord i don't know what it was it was a strange strange moment sister who was like the holy spirit come down it's like i could feel his faith it's praise god and we don't even know why god allows it we don't know why all right in that moment it's like the holy spirit brought down at least a bit of comfort a bit of peace yeah a bit of consolation that god knew what he was doing and this man now goes around and tells people about it just that moment just that moment of peace just that moment uh of a touch from god god's a vindication of the holy spirit praise me wonderful that god knows our sufferings wonderful god knows what we go through and god cares what we go through praise god sure yes he does he said it there's at least let's see i found at least three reasons god takes young people home early pull up isaiah 57 1. the righteous perish and no man laith at the heart and merciful men are taken away and none consider that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come sometimes god takes people to spare them from awful things that are going to happen later that's the first reason sometimes god takes the other ones number two we don't have to pull this one up but god may allow it as a test to other believers as in the case of job's seven children being killed by satan with that storm in job 1 verses 7 to 12 job was being tested when his seven children died that was a test would he curse god boys the test he'll curse god you've just surrounded with all these blessings if you just take these away he'll curse you he don't serve you because he loves you and job had to come face to face with the hardest test of his life but thank god he passed the test amen he loved god amen more than anything else he loved god i mean love god more than anything else that ought to be that ought to be your prayer that i'll be in your testimony church we're not guaranteed a bed of roses we're not guaranteed to easy life we're not guaranteed prosperity naturally now we are guaranteed spiritual prosperity if we if we if we go on to know the lord other times young people die because of dishonoring parents proverbs 20 verse 20. this is the more sadder one but again only god i mean god will know in these situations whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp should be put out in obscure darkness wow there's at least three reasons now church that's that's my little small p brain right there's probably many many more reasons why god would take a young person i just want you to show there's even grace in there god would keep someone from evil things that would come upon their lives because god is all-knowing yes he is god cares praise amen yes he's the god of grace yeah which is unmerited favor yeah he's the god of grace yes hallelujah thank you jesus remember the death of the saints is precious in the sight of god psalm 116 15. pull that out there 1 16 116 15. precious in the sight of the lord is the death of the saints of course that separated one saint is a separated one who chooses purposely to separate from the things of the world and again the lord will not allow the trial to come upon us that is above our ability to handle we'll never get to a spot where i say this is too hard i've got to end my life i can't i can't i can i can't go on it never gets that hard see satan tricks people into thinking that he deceives them the bible says he sets a snare and that people get caught in his trap into thinking i can't handle this church we can do all things glory we can do all things through christ who strengthens us i'm gonna say it again you can do all things through christ who strengthens you [Music] people pull that out to play a better football game they'll have to play a better basketball game but then they'll avoid it in tough times like this or they'll avoid it when the lord wants to send me another child because they don't want another child well i can't handle it well i can do all things through christ oh i can't handle this yes you can if god is for us who can be against us praise god amen amen hold out there first corinthians 10 13. first corinthians 10 13. there have no temptation taking you but such is as common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer to be above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear praise god amen faithful able to bear church let's say let's set it together say i'm able to bear can we i'm able to say it again i'm able to the bible says you're able to bear things you're able to bear your sufferings your trials you're able to bear it it won't be too hard for you it won't be too difficult it won't be too confusing trust the lord hallelujah trust god in every situation yeah he's faithful he won't give you something you can't handle the problem so we see all these reasons god is suffering god takes young people now i want to just share a few things here before i close i wasn't going to preach too long here tonight just because i wanted to lay some things out here the real problem with all this murder is demon possession because matthew 8 44 says you're you are your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bow not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speak of the lie speakers of his own for he's a liar and the father yes amen that's right i just want to just say a few things the president went on last night and talked about solutions to this problem i completely disagree with him how many mass shootings will it take for anyone to use common sense like i heard a guy say on on the news he said this nation just sent 40 billion dollars to ukraine for what so they can it's fight even our land you're right if they could put 40 40 billion to another country why don't they put 40 billion into the schools trying to cop in every school right amen everywhere there's cops there's never a shooter mad shooter is there because they don't want to get shot right it's total hypocrisy yeah the leaders of this nation total hypocrisy they could solve the problem like that if they wanted to how come those guys don't go into police officer buildings and do the mass shootings because they'll be dead in five minutes sure one or one five seconds whatever you're gonna say or the place that i have security guards that are armed why don't they go shoot up shoot that place up they're cowards they go to these places where there's no there's no guns the truth is these wicked leaders they need death they need tragedy to keep their power and increase their power until they lay down the mark of the beast that's the truth amen they want this type of tragedy and destruction because it will help them to get more power right because what they really hate is christians that's what they really hate that's it that's true it's so true you know when that abortion like now they're saying no more guns no more guns no more guns no more death no more death yet uh two weeks ago they were marching outside of supreme court supreme court horse or houses rather saying we want death we want death we want death do you catch that they're saying we we want to kill we want to kill but then when it comes to the guns we don't want we don't want them dead we don't want them dead you can't have a they're murderers you can't have it both ways like that and like they were telling me there's a law in california almost coming up where they can have abortions after the baby's born up to two weeks they're trying to get in california they're trying to get up to two weeks after a baby's born they could take the baby in so i don't want anybody trying to make it legal merciful that is just back to the days of uh the days of baal worship where they have humans baby sacrifices yeah yeah just back to that right now it's all worth it worse it's all evil it's all it's all wickedness but the same people that are are saying get rid of the guns so we can save life are the ones marching for death they sent trillions of dollars after coven for relief to schools for fruit roll-up fruit roll-ups and uh cereal boxes sister naomi i don't know if your kids get they offer to the kids every day free food they get free lunches for two years because of cobin trillion a trillion dollars instead of sending food what they send to police officers and some healthy food not cocoa puffs to rot their brains and their bodies right yeah it's ridiculous isn't it 40 million ukraine one trillion for covet and they won't even save the lives of these innocent little ones it's hypocrisy yes it is when are they gonna use common sense you know murders rapes everything is going up in every liberal city right now in america it's the highest it's ever been philadelphia five months ago broke the record for the number of homicides and murders and rapes in a year that's philadelphia chicago's uh it's up by 229 i saw the article today murders deaths shootings fatalities homicides rapes 229 percent now chur aren't you glad god gave us a little shiloh here in ohio amen i'm thankful yeah i could have been born in chicago i could have been bored right thank god he gave us a little shiloh here in northeast ohio all the places that nailed in wesley akron ohio of all the places on the map right of all the places they could have said the uh the hmong people where'd they send them yeah akron ohio wisconsin right minnesota all these places of all the places amen god give us grace yeah you know stephanie's proud listen she sent me a text last night after i'd gone to bed i got it this morning when i woke up at 5 30 and she said please pray for those 21 families affected i said i certainly will so i did but i texted her back and i said also don't remember there was 21 that died yesterday but i said there was also 3 000 that died in abortion clinics every day in america three thousand babies are killed every day a guy one of my friends i told you about that guy i passed every time i go into giant eagle he's an older guy catholic guy he said they said pray for that i looked i he said pray for those families i said i will i put my hands on the shoulder i said sir and i said we need to pray for those 3 000 mothers today who murdered those babies that they'll be convicted and repent of that and not go back to the abortion clinics right don't we need to do that see these these hypocrites and liars they get all said about 21 we're upset about it too it makes me cry all right but what about the 3 000 right don't those lives matter don't the lives of chicago and philadelphia don't those lives matter absolutely they all matter and if they had the love of jesus christ in their hearts it would matter to them and they would use some common sense they could do it they could protect the kids but they don't want to they need the tragedies they need to lay down a mark they need to lay down their agenda and that's why they're going to keep allowing it now for jesse do you pray that they'll change things yes i do pray but i know it's highly unlikely but i still pray amen that's because of ezekiel let me go to ezekiel 30 here go to ezekiel 30. i showed this to austin i think i showed it with some again earth was filled with violence is it east eco 30 or i think easy go 22 let me just check my 22 yeah i'm sorry zico 22 verse 30 sorry honey i got it church did you know this god did not destroy israel in the days of the old testament and kicked them out of the land until there was a time when nobody was interceding in prayer anymore now we know it'll never get that way for america right but it'll be fewer fewer fewer because we'll always have holy ghost-filled saints here until the rapture they'll always be frightened but god now look god said i was looking for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none god is looking where's a believer in jerusalem where's the believer in the promise and that will pray for me to have mercy on this place and he couldn't find any wow there was no more left that's why i believe in the power of prayer still amen because i've got children and they could have a future i don't know it's in god's hands there could be more generations yeah right they're going to outlive me if things go normal according to the normal things of life and so what is god in jesus christ is he not the same yesterday today forever he is the same yesterday today and forever didn't jesus say in john 4 24 god is looking he's seeking actively seeking for true worshipers who worship in spirit and in truth praise god amen hallelujah but once he found noah in the days of ezekiel ezekiel was taken out of the promised land as well he was a babylonian prophet once once all the men stopped crying inside for the abominations then the destruction came in now only god knows when the rapture is the day and the hour is up to god but i'm saying while we're here we should pray for mercy amen we should pray for people to be saved i still pray for the god to i know god raises people up but i know god can pull him down as well i still believe in that now we need to do uh first up phones five one i'm about to say this at the beginning first thessalonians five one that's not the problem one two and three premier scriptures this has to be because it's prophecy jesus talked about it luke 17. paul talked about it the whole world is going to be saying peace and safety for the times and seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night in other words they would know the time and season of the rapture right we can see it we can see all the prophecies i made a video about it 14 signs were in the end time now there's probably 10 or 20 more for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so see there's got to be this violence there's got to be this wickedness there's got to it's got to match the days of noah as we know but midst of it all god doesn't want the wicked destroyed god is merciful and if god allows little ones to go no matter how they go god has a reason for it and you can trust god hallelujah that's the only one we can trust is god almighty praise god amen hallelujah true the earth is filled with violence so the last reason why is the bible so violent i'm going to close with this if you would go to revelation 13 8 i'm going to close there's a few scriptures right yeah and all the dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the church you know you know the scriptures in isaiah jesus was beaten so much he looked like a worm i was he said i'm not he said i'm not a man i'm a worm you couldn't even recognize he was a man all the all the whippings beatings couldn't even recognize he was a man true so before adam and eve did one before the world was even founded god know god chose the most violent gruesome horrible death ever possible in order to save his people god had it planned out the most violent thing that would ever happen would be jesus christ the innocent son of god dying on a cross he had that planned out before the shooter did that yesterday he had it planned out before the flood happened in the days of noah he had it all planned out the most violent act in history planned before the foundation in the world the crucifixion of jesus christ why is the bible so violent because this most violent act was used to show us the love of god that we can get a small glimpse of god's love to us amen the cross just gives us god is infinite how do you believe god's love is infinite amen well that means the cross just gives us a small glimpse into how great god's love really is because our human minds we can't understand all of it right it's impossible to understand how great god's love is for us but the best way he can show us with our human little finite mind is the sacrifice of the innocent son of god we get a small glimpse of god's love hallelujah the greatest event of all history yes and revelation 5 magnifies it everybody's in heaven john's crying he said there's no one worthy to take the book and loose the seals to give us the revelation oh hallelujah no man was worthy amen until a lamb came forth as he was slaughtered the bible says he looked like he was slaughtered amen in other words the mystery of the book the understanding of the book could not come unless a lamb who was that the most violent death came and took that book and opened that book that you and i could receive the revelation and understanding of it and in that book see the love of god hallelujah amen no one was worthy it shows us the only worthy one is the one who took the most violent acts upon him the most evil the most beating the most aggression you could ever put on a person jesus christ took it thank you lord and then the bible says revelation 5 verse 9. our song in heaven after all this glory after all this russian ukraine fades away after all this inflation fades away after all this lgbtq whatever fades away after all the wickedness is done away with there's only going to be holiness left and what are we going to sing about church we're going to sing about the most violent act that ever was accomplished on the cross but that violent act is what purchased our eternal life amen what do we sing about the bible said they sent a new song yes thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals up for thou was slaughtered that's what the word means and that's redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation let's stand to our feet praise god we're going to be singing about the most violent act there ever was put on a person the crucifixion of jesus christ that's how the musicians come here why is the bible so violent for those three reasons at least but the crucifixion of christ is the very pinnacle of violence that we can see what needs to be done to forgive our sins what would it take to make us redeemed and bring us back to a spot where we can be one with god it would take the most violent act ever on god's land hallelujah play that love ran red if you would let's bow our heads here for a time of prayer here by god's grace the earth is filled with violence again church just like it was the days of lot just like it was the days of noah [Music] we just felt burdened to get this out that people could see some of the bible scriptures the truth of the word [Music] be more settled in their hearts and minds trying to understand the violence in this world [Music] church i hope we're thankful for the love of god tonight expressed in jesus christ no man could die like him no man could live like him [Music] there's none like him let's just pray for a few moments church let's just thank you let's thank jesus for all that he's done for us can we father god we thank you lord for sending your son jesus [Music] he paid our ransom dear god he paid the penalty that was necessary to set us free no one else could pay it no one else was worthy they searched all heaven over under the earth not a man or woman was worthy until one came forth glory a bloody bleeding lamb hallelujah and they bowed down they worshipped them he said worthy is a lamb lord we'll sing about that lamb we'll sing about your lamb throughout all eternity we'll learn a new song because you've redeemed us by the blood you've brought us back you made a way we can come back in the fellowship with you again we thank you for it jesus this is the heart of christianity dear god it's the heart of the plan of god before there was a human on this earth before the earth was founded [Music] we thank you lord god for your mercy lord may our hearts be more tender may we be the voices crying out against wickedness and we even the voices of reason may our prayers go up to heaven lord intercede lord with the high priest i pray and make intercession lord god upon these prayers tonight lord god hallelujah that thy will be done lord that thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven [Music] thank you lord you will not allow a destination that we cannot handle lord god thank you jesus may we be like job though he slay me yet i'll trust him the lord god gives and the lord god takes away blessed be the name of the lord [Music] may remember that your thoughts are higher than our thoughts your ways higher than our ways as the heaven is high above the earth lord let us manifest your life dear god your spirit that it might reveal the secrets and thoughts of hearts we pray for mercy god we pray for grace i pray lord if there's any goodness in any of those hearts of the leaders in washington god that they would do the sensible thing and put cops in the schools [Music] i believe in praying for those things again we pray for abortion and federally lord god hallelujah all things are possible let me believe you're looking for men and women who stand the gap lord god who pray who believe who keep knocking like the widow woman in the parable in luke 17 hallelujah shall i find faith on the earth but we return because lord we know we get lazy if we stop praying if we say well i'm not going to pray for the nation i'm not going to pray for sin we get lazy we stop sign and cry for the abominations help us lord not to be lazy help us to have zeal lord god let's be diligent lord god [Music] servants of righteousness servants of holiness hallelujah jesus you're still marking those who sign cry for the abomination of the city i thank you for that god i thank you that that word transcends even to the new testament lord [Music] where you said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing when stephen said lord lay this not to their charge hallelujah give us love like that god you must see you like that i pray thank you that your love ran red two thousand years ago [Music] purchasing this earth with your blood dear god purchasing art the bibles in our bodies and our spirits which are the lord's noted our souls as well we thank you for this great love we're just we're just have a very small understanding of it lord we'll be singing about it for eternity rejoicing about it in your presence as your covenant people in the robes that we've washed white in the blood of the lamb of god in jesus christ's name saint said it's
