[20:39] for Father we give you the glory tonight
[20:42] minister by your Holy Spirit meet every
[20:45] need
[20:45] Lord God wasn't getting an immanent here
[20:47] it means but an orange ago the needs
[20:49] were this morning
[20:50] you let them back up you can bring
[20:51] healing so many people need of music
[20:53] father you're our dealer only physician
[20:56] the great musician may you come on the
[20:58] center of these individuals like this
[21:01] here at night morning through your word
[21:02] father and grow just a little bit closer
[21:05] who we want to grow a lot again but help
[21:08] us to grow close to you more God and
[21:10] almost the hunger thirst for home your
[21:12] righteousness more thirsty tonight more
[21:17] of your spirit so how much more can you
[21:19] learn about break that is drawn closer
[21:21] to you in Jesus Christ the church said I
[21:27] was here like two scriptures let's go to
[21:33] Hebrews 10 let's go to go to our tents
[21:35] March 10 I just bruised part to both
[21:41] message from this morning
[23:57] you
[26:51] who turned their back on the spirit of
[26:53] grace so I want to look at a few more
[26:56] scriptures on the the spirit of grace
[26:58] and what the spirit of grace causes you
[27:00] to do so God's spirit of grace will
[27:04] bring somebody to the faith it'll
[27:05] justify them you know God's grace will
[27:08] teach them to be sanctified but if they
[27:10] turn their backs on that and they say I
[27:11] don't want to be sanctified anymore then
[27:14] they're really crucifying Christ of
[27:16] fresh and they're crucifying the effects
[27:19] of the Holy Spirit to further sanctify
[27:22] them or fill them with the Holy Ghost
[27:24] and then Jesus or the Bible said it's
[27:27] more sore punishment for them now I want
[27:30] to show you this it's in Titus chapter 2
[27:32] which was really refreshing for me to
[27:34] find this so let's go to Titus chapter 2
[27:46] see when Jesus saves us he saves us to
[27:51] wash us to present us as a spotless
[27:55] bride
[27:56] hey Rahab and that's the purpose so
[27:59] that's why he would punish someone who
[28:03] wanted who thought they wanted to be a
[28:05] part of the bride but then turns down
[28:07] the cleansing to be his bride because it
[28:10] was a free gift right salvation is a
[28:12] gift of God it's a free gift
[28:14] so God freely gives them this gift but
[28:18] then they turn around saying I don't
[28:19] want to be I don't want to be clean
[28:21] anymore I'd rather enjoy the things of
[28:23] the world and so because they turned on
[28:26] the free gift and despised and crucify
[28:30] the effects of Christ it's almost like
[28:32] in their life they're saying crucify
[28:33] that word alright we don't want that
[28:35] word we will not have this word to rule
[28:37] over us right that's the danger of
[28:40] people around the message that leave the
[28:41] message or say we won't have this word
[28:43] but this is the word of the hour this is
[28:45] the fresh word of God and if you won't
[28:48] let this word rule over you then you're
[28:50] gonna let Satan's word rule over you
[28:52] right the demon powers and demonic
[28:55] oppression and depression and oppression
[28:58] and possession demonic possession but
[29:02] the spirit of grace wants to cleanse you
[29:05] and once you present you spotless before
[29:07] God Almighty amen now that's Titus 2:11
[29:13] here's what they turn down Titus 2:11
[29:17] for the grace of God that bringeth
[29:19] salvation hath appeared to all men's
[29:21] this is God's gift of grace teaching us
[29:24] that denying ungodliness so what is what
[29:27] is the spirit of grace teach to deny sin
[29:31] to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts we
[29:35] should live soberly righteously and
[29:37] godly in this present world looking for
[29:39] that blessed hope and the glorious
[29:41] appearing of the Great God and our
[29:43] Savior Jesus Christ who gave him for
[29:46] himself for us that he might hear his
[29:48] redeem us from all iniquity and purity
[29:52] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[29:55] of good works I just notice that how you
[30:00] feel I just want to do something for
[30:01] Jesus that's how he wants the bride we
[30:04] just want to do something for the Lord I
[30:05] wanna do something good for the name of
[30:07] Jesus right these things speak and
[30:11] exhort and rebuke with all authority let
[30:13] no man despise thee Paul tells us
[30:16] preacher this young preacher he said you
[30:17] preach these things don't let anybody
[30:19] tell you any differently you preach this
[30:21] word right here God's trying to clean
[30:23] out his bride and he's going to so see
[30:27] someone who does despite the spirit of
[30:30] grace and crucifies Christ afresh
[30:33] doesn't want to let godly or righteously
[30:38] they want to live sinfully okay so
[30:42] that's the spirit of grace that I want
[30:44] you to see that that's what the spirit
[30:46] of grace does now now remember
[30:52] acts 5:32 let's just turn there real
[30:54] quick they said I'll try to be real
[30:57] mindful the time here X 532 and this is
[31:07] just this is why I was saying this
[31:09] morning if were to go on with God if
[31:13] we're to grow in God we have to obey
[31:15] more of God's Word because God only
[31:19] gives a Holy Ghost about said whom and
[31:21] we are witnesses of these things and so
[31:23] is the Holy Ghost whom God has given to
[31:24] them that obey Him so something like
[31:27] Judas stopped obeying him and turn
[31:30] around and wanted the things of the
[31:31] world more and if we want to grow with
[31:34] God we've got to see God what do I need
[31:37] to obey at this stage in my life what is
[31:40] the scripture I'm not quite obeying that
[31:41] you want me to obey and then obey that
[31:44] and then God will bless you for taking
[31:47] that obedience right and it's always a
[31:50] death you know it's always a death to
[31:52] self it's always a crucifixion because
[31:54] he said take up the cross daily and
[31:56] follow me so every day is a self
[31:58] crucifixion of your will right it's a
[32:01] taking up across daily and so when we do
[32:04] that when we crucify the flesh and obey
[32:08] the word of God then it the reward is
[32:11] more of God's Spirit more of God's
[32:13] anointing amen
[32:16] so that's clear that everybody can see
[32:19] that by the grace of the Lord now let me
[32:26] I want to move forward here I want to
[32:29] make sure let's go back to Joshua 22
[32:31] because I said something a little wrong
[32:32] this morning I want to correct it Joshua
[32:35] 20 to 1 I said there was only two tribes
[32:38] that didn't go over it was actually two
[32:39] and a half so forgive me I missed a half
[32:42] Joshua 22 verse 1 so from this morning's
[32:46] message there was 12 tribes and all of
[32:49] them all of them were promised the
[32:51] promised land land but two and a half of
[32:55] them said we don't want to cross over
[32:56] ourselves we want to live outside the
[32:59] promised land and that's a type of the
[33:01] foolish virgin we will go in and we'll
[33:04] experience someone that will taste of
[33:05] the things of God
[33:06] but we don't want to live in it but see
[33:09] we want to live in all the message right
[33:10] I want to live everything that this word
[33:13] says praise God
[33:15] I want to possess the land God has for
[33:17] me but see those two-and-a-half tribes
[33:20] looked out and they said well I don't
[33:22] really want that land I'd rather have
[33:23] this so see they they chose land of
[33:26] their own choosing rather than God's
[33:27] choosing and we've got to say God what
[33:31] is your choice for my life and help me
[33:33] to live that choice for your choice for
[33:36] my life not like well I like to be
[33:39] popular and rich and have a and try to
[33:43] still serve God no you can't you can't
[33:45] have the things of the world you got to
[33:47] have all of God amen you can't have some
[33:49] of God in some of the world you got to
[33:51] have all of God and that's what these
[33:53] tries are looking at like a lot they
[33:55] wanted riches and popularity and all
[33:58] these things popular you know just being
[34:01] a living with the people you know he
[34:03] wanted to live there in Sodom so he had
[34:05] all the blessings that look like the
[34:06] Garden of Eden with you know all this
[34:07] financial blessing but Abraham knew
[34:11] that's not what God has called us to
[34:12] God's not called us to mix with the
[34:14] world God's called us to live separate
[34:16] from the world and so the same thing
[34:20] happened to these tribes the
[34:23] two-and-a-half tribes so it's Joshua 22
[34:26] one two four and I do it again forgive
[34:29] me I meant to say two-and-a-half but I
[34:31] knew that scripture out it's like a slip
[34:34] of the tongue I guess or slip of the
[34:36] mind I should probably say and it's okay
[34:39] you know I've heard recently preachers
[34:41] say a few things that slipped out like
[34:42] one brother said he said God he said
[34:46] don't you know God's not in having any
[34:47] more gods on earth he said don't you
[34:50] know deities not in heaven deities on
[34:51] earth now Church let's be honest Jesus
[34:55] Christ is in heaven right and the and
[34:59] everybody's saying shout an Amen during
[35:00] a sermon but I thought no that's not
[35:02] right the actual quote was brother don't
[35:04] you know deities not in have any more
[35:06] deities on earth you see what they're
[35:10] saying they're saying all of God is on
[35:12] earth and God's not in heaven the fact
[35:15] is gods in both because Jesus Christ is
[35:19] deity the
[35:20] illness of the Godhead is in Christ and
[35:23] Christ is at the right hand of the
[35:24] Father right now so see people mistake
[35:28] some of the quotes our brother brand
[35:29] where we say we're now the throne of God
[35:31] is in our heart well that's true but see
[35:33] that that what they do is they get they
[35:35] make a mistake and they say well if the
[35:37] throne of God is our heart now then
[35:40] there's no more throne in heaven and
[35:41] that's wrong see they take they take
[35:43] that type too far are you with me yes
[35:46] the throne of God is on our hearts now
[35:49] but it's just a temporary throne the
[35:52] real throne of God is in heaven so see
[35:55] if I made a slip this morning forgive me
[35:57] I didn't mean to make it I didn't mean
[35:58] to say it wrong but I did make a mistake
[36:00] it wasn't two tribes it was two and a
[36:02] half but I hear I hear other brothers
[36:04] you know we all make mistakes we're all
[36:06] human
[36:06] that's why our faith is not in a man our
[36:08] faith is in the word our faith is in
[36:10] Jesus Christ so we never exalt a man and
[36:13] we always look to the word behind the
[36:16] man Joshua 20 to 1 then Joshua called
[36:19] the rubra nights and the gadites and the
[36:21] half tribe of manasseh see there it is
[36:24] it's two and a half I missed that half
[36:27] forgive me and he said then you have
[36:31] kept all that Moses the servant LORD
[36:33] commanded you and have obeyed my voice
[36:34] in all that I commanded you you have not
[36:37] left your brethren these many days under
[36:39] this day but I've kept the charge of
[36:41] your commandment of the Lord your God
[36:42] and now the Lord your God has given rest
[36:45] under your brethren and as he promised
[36:46] them therefore now return you and get
[36:49] you unto your tents and unto the land of
[36:52] your possession which Moses a servant of
[36:54] the Lord gave you on the other side of
[36:57] Jordan so see they chose we don't want
[37:00] to live on this side of Jordan we don't
[37:02] want to be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[37:04] but we'll help them out but once they
[37:07] got what they want we're gonna come back
[37:08] and we're gonna go we're gonna live
[37:10] outside of the promised land
[37:11] oh what a what a rational mistake what
[37:15] and it was all because they were cattle
[37:18] raisers and they thought well this is
[37:19] better ground for cattle how foolish
[37:23] don't they know that if the ground
[37:24] doesn't look like it's good cattle
[37:25] ground either God will change the ground
[37:27] to be good cattle ground or God will
[37:30] give you a different job you won't do
[37:31] cattle you do something else
[37:33] but God's calling for you and I and for
[37:35] them was to take the promised land but
[37:38] they used mental human reasoning which
[37:41] means they must not I got up to
[37:42] knowledge on the statue pervert man if
[37:45] it wasn't the Old Testament I'm just
[37:47] saying if it was and they reason they
[37:49] said well we're cattle raisers and we'll
[37:52] just stay outside the baptism of the
[37:53] Holy Ghost and we'll be foolish virgin
[37:55] we'll come right up to the gates of the
[37:57] baptism and then we won't go in and
[37:59] we'll just be happy out there oh no God
[38:02] wanted them to possess the land and
[38:04] that's what we've got to do we're gonna
[38:06] have to possess all the promises of God
[38:09] so does that help now by God's grace see
[38:12] those foolish version they'll help out
[38:14] the bride they will be good to the bride
[38:16] amen
[38:17] thank God they will give the bride
[38:19] clothes they'll give the bride food
[38:21] they'll visit the bride in in their
[38:23] Hospital amen they'll visit the bride
[38:26] there were six things remember the
[38:27] sixteen jesus said because you did it to
[38:29] the least of these my brethren you've
[38:31] done it unto me and here they good they
[38:34] go fight with them they help them out
[38:36] all right
[38:36] all right you know Simeon all right
[38:40] Simmons we helped you get the land
[38:42] praise the Lord or Judah we hope to get
[38:43] the land all right now see you later we
[38:45] don't want to live in this kind of land
[38:47] we don't want to live like you holy
[38:48] rollers we're gonna go back outside
[38:50] can you imagine what that's what they
[38:52] thought they thought we'll be more
[38:54] blessed by our own financial choosing
[38:56] rather than trusting that if God placed
[38:59] us in a land he'll provide for us
[39:00] oh my thank the Lord for His mercy
[39:03] Church so I want you to see that and I
[39:13] hope that helps you here all right oops
[39:16] Barbie sorry now let's see it a few more
[39:20] things let me I want to read this quote
[39:21] from brother Branham it's it's from I
[39:25] says it in numerous places in the third
[39:28] seal brother man said you can be
[39:29] sanctified without being justified and
[39:32] you can be justified without being
[39:35] sanctified you can be sanctified without
[39:37] receiving the Holy Ghost
[39:39] that's exactly now that's what brother
[39:42] that's what Judas did Judas was
[39:44] justified sanctified but he
[39:47] forgot the holy ghost and so striking
[39:50] the brother Graham says that because
[39:50] Hebrews 10:29 says that you can be
[39:54] sanctified but then trodden under foot
[39:57] the Son of God or the Holy Ghost now
[40:01] they asked brother Branham in questions
[40:02] and answers part three
[40:03] they said brother Branham on one of the
[40:06] tapes of the seven church age as you
[40:08] mentioned that Judas had been justified
[40:09] and sanctified were these genuine
[40:12] experiences his grace that he received
[40:15] Obama have said now that's a good one
[40:18] this would be good I'll have to depend
[40:21] on the Lord to answer this this is a
[40:26] good question was it genuine now bro
[40:29] Graham never says the word genuine again
[40:32] but he says over and over again that
[40:34] Judas was justified and sanctified so
[40:38] Judas had a genuine experience
[40:39] he'd been saved right he was believing
[40:42] to be saved and he started building up a
[40:45] statue of a perfect man but then he sold
[40:48] it out at the end so let me read this
[40:49] and I'm just gonna go quickly so the
[40:57] first scripture brother man mentions is
[40:58] what we read this more actually we
[41:00] didn't read it let's go to Luke chapter
[41:01] 10 where he said the Devils were subject
[41:06] unto us and Jesus have rejoiced not that
[41:07] your name's rejoice now that you can
[41:10] cast out Devils but that your names are
[41:12] written in heaven okay yeah this is Luke
[41:21] 10:17 so the first scripture brother
[41:25] Branham reference about Judas is this
[41:26] scripture now these are the seventy
[41:29] these are not the twelve okay but
[41:31] remember we saw from this morning the
[41:33] seventy and twelve were given the same
[41:34] Commission they were to go into their
[41:36] cities preach the gospel and then Jesus
[41:38] would follow up as a latter rain amen I
[41:42] like that glory that's the type for our
[41:45] day amen
[41:47] the seventy returned again with joy
[41:48] saying Lord even the Devils are subject
[41:50] unto us through thy name and he said to
[41:53] them I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[41:55] from heaven behold I give you power to
[41:57] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[41:58] all the power of the enemy and
[42:00] nothing shall by any means hurt you not
[42:02] withstanding in this rejoice not that
[42:04] the spirits are subject unto you but
[42:06] rejoice rather because your names are
[42:08] written in heaven so brother man tells
[42:12] us not to get too excited about miracles
[42:14] although we think God for miracles but
[42:17] don't get too excited about them but get
[42:20] excited that your names written in
[42:22] heaven that's how we that's what we need
[42:25] to rejoice overhead and that's why you
[42:27] know I used to get really nervous if I
[42:28] hadn't seen a miracle for a while but
[42:30] God has had to deliver me of my
[42:31] immaturity on that and realize that's
[42:34] not what will rejoice in those things
[42:36] happen in God's time and season when we
[42:39] can all get in one Accord right miracles
[42:43] the that all happens when we get all the
[42:45] unbelief out and then God can move but
[42:47] the main thing to be happy about is that
[42:49] you're saved and your name is on the
[42:51] book of life that's more important in
[42:54] other words that's a greater miracle
[42:56] than all these other things is that you
[42:58] can be saved from your sins and have
[43:00] eternal life amen
[43:02] that's greater than any natural sickness
[43:05] because you'll just get sick again and
[43:06] die right so that's the first Scripture
[43:09] brother man brings out he said now see
[43:15] the attitude was wrong and she imagined
[43:17] Jesus knew this and seventy people come
[43:19] back and say we can cast out devils and
[43:21] Jesus says your attitude is wrong
[43:24] he said you mustn't rejoice because
[43:26] you've got received enough because
[43:28] you've cast out Devils and then he talks
[43:32] about how usually the people that has
[43:34] gifts are the people that don't want
[43:35] gifts Paul tried to run from the thing
[43:38] so did Moses great leaders like that try
[43:40] to run from the job they know what lays
[43:42] before them it's the guy that don't want
[43:47] nothing to do with it see that's the guy
[43:49] God can take him and teach him something
[43:50] you see in other words God doesn't want
[43:53] people to be big shots like look what I
[43:54] can do I can cast out Devils he wants
[43:57] people to just rejoice that they're
[43:59] saved amen and not to become a big shot
[44:05] all right now the next
[44:06] he says he's now he goes to this where
[44:13] Jesus tells Peter when you get converted
[44:17] strengthen the Brethren I think that's
[44:18] Luke 22 let's go there I know some of
[44:24] these are familiar but I just want to
[44:26] lay them down so you can see the
[44:27] scripture on this cuz this was like I
[44:29] said a fresh revelation to me because
[44:32] what I was doing as your turn to Luke 22
[44:34] what I was doing was just taking one
[44:37] quote from seed of discrepancy where
[44:39] brother Ram said Judas never had no
[44:40] faith to begin with I was just taking
[44:43] that quote but I had kind of skipped
[44:45] over all the other ones where brother
[44:48] Ram said he did have faith he was saved
[44:50] and that's why I was brother branham or
[44:53] anybody we got to take everything they
[44:54] say back to the Word of God and then
[44:56] when I searched the scripture I read
[44:57] Hebrews 10 yesterday and it says he was
[45:00] sanctified it doesn't say he was
[45:02] pretending to be sanctified he was
[45:04] sanctified and then you have these other
[45:07] scriptures that we've went over this
[45:09] morning about how they genuinely had the
[45:11] power of God they were generally walking
[45:14] with God but then they sold it out and
[45:16] left and then the the type is we saw in
[45:19] Hebrews 4 the type was Israel they
[45:21] genuinely went through the Red Sea and
[45:24] then the four grounds it genuinely
[45:27] received the seat of God it was the
[45:28] genuine seat of God but it let the cares
[45:32] of the world choke it out remember all
[45:34] these things it was a genuine experience
[45:36] until they compromised on the Word of
[45:38] God so I just want to share that again
[45:46] okay yeah it's
[45:47] I'm sorry Luke 22:31 and the Lord said
[45:51] Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to
[45:53] have you that he may sift you as wheat
[45:56] but I and then member simeons agitate
[45:59] means to shake your up your life he
[46:00] wants to shake your foundation right he
[46:03] wanted to give an earthquake and Peter
[46:04] spiritual life and break up his
[46:05] foundation right he said about I prayed
[46:09] for you that your faith fail not and
[46:10] when thou art converted strengthen thy
[46:12] brethren so brother random uses this
[46:15] scripture and he says see just because
[46:18] your name's in heaven on the on the book
[46:20] of life still doesn't mean you're saved
[46:22] you're not converted until you receive
[46:24] the Holy Ghost
[46:24] you're only potentially converted right
[46:29] so if you're just saved us if you're
[46:32] just just by your sanctified you're only
[46:33] potentially in other words the three
[46:35] works of grace aren't finished yet but
[46:37] you're on your road and brother Graham
[46:40] talks about if I gave you an acorn do
[46:43] you have a cornfield yet no but it's he
[46:46] said it's potentially said he said if I
[46:49] asked for cornfield and I see corn about
[46:51] about that high potentially I have a
[46:53] field of corn not it isn't developed yet
[46:56] something could happen amen
[46:58] and that's like Judas he started growing
[47:00] but something happened he turned around
[47:03] and forsook the truth he said now you're
[47:07] on your road through justification
[47:08] sanctification to the baptism and Holy
[47:10] Ghost but when you're gently baptized
[47:12] with the Holy Ghost you're in the
[47:14] kingdom he says now you say brother
[47:15] branham is that true and that's where he
[47:18] goes to John 17:17 where Jesus said
[47:20] sanctify them through thy truth thy Word
[47:22] is truth
[47:23] now remember at that moment Judas was
[47:25] gone remember that Judas left in John 13
[47:28] and he missed all the preaching Jesus
[47:31] did when they left the Last Supper and
[47:34] went to the garden Yosemite Jesus
[47:36] preached on the Holy Ghost the whole way
[47:37] there and Judas missed that because he
[47:41] wanted to go make some money so he
[47:43] missed them preaching on the baptism of
[47:44] the Holy Ghost and then Jesus he prayed
[47:48] for them in the garden he said Lord
[47:49] sanctify them through thy truth thy Word
[47:52] is truth and Jesus knew they had a
[47:54] little over fifty more days to be
[47:55] sanctified and Judas wasn't there right
[47:59] he laughs
[48:00] so when Jesus prayed Judas wasn't there
[48:03] he didn't get the prayer for
[48:04] sanctification so brother has to see
[48:08] that that's true the sanctification was
[48:11] prayed for by Jesus and after you're
[48:14] converted then you can strengthen your
[48:15] brother and then we see where'd Peter at
[48:18] the beginning of the ministry he could
[48:20] stand in his own City and say Jesus the
[48:22] Messiah but then when a little maid
[48:24] woman come up and he's warming his hands
[48:26] and said do you know Jesus curse
[48:28] blankety-blank he's a custom preacher I
[48:30] don't even know him and he lost the
[48:33] strength to stand up and say I'm one of
[48:35] them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[48:37] of them he lost it because of fear and I
[48:41] love what I heard brother Donny say
[48:42] about that he said that the night before
[48:45] he was like Jesus I'll die for you and
[48:47] then all the disciples said we won't
[48:49] deny you and Jesus said you will and I
[48:53] like what brother Donny said he said
[48:55] Peter said that because he never been
[48:56] tested that hard in his life before and
[49:00] I thought nah that's what I need to
[49:01] remember before we boast and say
[49:04] something like oh I can say it can never
[49:06] tempt me away from message before we say
[49:08] that let us be humble enough to say by
[49:11] God's grace because Peter said I won't
[49:15] deny you and all this I per said ha I
[49:17] died with you but they never been tested
[49:19] with arrest yet or death and church
[49:24] that's what you and I need to say we've
[49:25] never been beaten for the message yet
[49:27] have we I've never been arrested or
[49:30] beaten for the message so as to make
[49:31] sure our boasting is not boasting but
[49:35] it's faith you understand in other words
[49:38] if I say both Amen I'll never fall away
[49:40] from this message by the grace of God by
[49:42] God's help not by my strength but by
[49:44] God's strength you see I think that's so
[49:49] beautiful
[49:49] because Peter had all this he had it but
[49:51] then when the temptation came Satan come
[49:54] and spoiled all those things except
[49:56] faith out of his life because Jesus said
[49:58] I pray that your faith fail not amen is
[50:02] that helped by God's grace by he said
[50:06] Peter still wasn't converted and that
[50:08] means change which means that's the seal
[50:10] of the Holy Ghost
[50:11] he said when you get converted then
[50:13] strengthen the Brethren
[50:14] ah he said you're just leading when you
[50:20] get saved and sanctified you're just
[50:21] leading to conversion he says all right
[50:28] let me move ahead here and brother man
[50:43] now he shows how Judas sold out and he
[50:45] said just like some of them sells out a
[50:46] Methodist a Baptist or whatever more
[50:48] sold out his position on the book of
[50:51] life he'll have to stand there and be
[50:53] judged by that by the word that's why
[50:56] Judas had to do it Judas has has to come
[50:58] to the judgment his name was on the book
[51:00] of life but that don't mean he's saved
[51:01] he has to stay on the judgment he said
[51:03] the sleeping version will stand right
[51:05] there under the same things he said
[51:08] that's he that can receive and not he
[51:09] that hears it and just preach it and
[51:11] goes on and say nonsense he that
[51:13] receiveth my word he that heareth my
[51:14] word and believeth not make believe but
[51:16] truly believe on him that has sent me
[51:18] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[51:21] into condemnation but is passed from
[51:23] death unto life so just showing how
[51:26] Judas and the foolish version can hear
[51:28] and respond to it but you've got to keep
[51:31] going on with God he said so Judas had
[51:35] his name there on the book of life but
[51:37] he was condemned because what'd he do he
[51:39] sold out his birth rights and brother
[51:40] man went right to Esau who sold out his
[51:43] birthright to be born in the family of
[51:45] Christ he sold it out for a bowl of
[51:47] lentils and if I'm not mistaken aren't
[51:52] lentils beans
[51:53] can you imagine selling out Christ for a
[51:56] bunch of beans that's what he did
[51:59] because his own his own belly was his
[52:01] God that's what the Bible says so any
[52:04] preacher that sells out the baptism holy
[52:06] ghost of the message for money sake is
[52:09] really making their belly their God
[52:11] so Esau was his example and then the
[52:15] spies that went to Canaan
[52:16] ten of them come back and said we can't
[52:18] take it but Joshua Caleb he said well
[52:21] that's what the ten knew they sold out
[52:22] their birth rights but he said Caleb and
[52:25] Joshua had the faith to take the
[52:26] promised land
[52:28] now let's go back to Hebrews 6 now cuz
[52:30] this is what brother man reads next and
[52:32] I mentioned this earlier this is
[52:33] familiar but let's read it again cuz
[52:36] this all flows together and bear with me
[52:42] here I'm gonna I got about 18 more
[52:44] minutes so that'll be 45 minutes Hebrews
[52:52] 6 now this there's some there's some
[52:56] more Revelation in here too and verse 1
[52:58] this has to all tie in there with a
[53:00] statue perfect man as well but look at
[53:01] verse 1 therefore leaving the principles
[53:03] of the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[53:04] to perfection not laying the foundation
[53:07] of repentance from dead works and of
[53:08] faith toward God and that's striking
[53:10] foundation faith is the foundation see
[53:13] how that lines up with second Peter
[53:14] faith virtue and here Paul says not
[53:18] laying in the foundation of faith and
[53:20] repentance see how it goes together
[53:21] that's beautiful
[53:23] of the doctrine of baptisms on the
[53:25] laying on of hands and of the
[53:27] resurrection of that and the eternal
[53:28] judgment and this we will do if God
[53:31] permit for it is impossible for those
[53:33] who were once enlightened and have
[53:35] tasted of the heavenly gift and were
[53:36] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[53:39] have tasted the good word of God and the
[53:41] powers of the world to come if they
[53:43] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[53:45] repentance seeing they crucify to
[53:47] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[53:49] him to an open shame my for the earth
[53:54] which drinketh in the rain that cometh
[53:55] oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs
[53:57] meat for them by whom at his dress
[53:58] receiveth blessings from God but that
[54:01] which bear thorns and briers is rejected
[54:03] and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to
[54:05] be burned but beloved we are persuaded
[54:07] better things of you and things that
[54:10] accompany salvation though thus we speak
[54:12] for God is not unrighteous to forget
[54:15] your work and your labor of love which
[54:17] you have showed toward his name and then
[54:19] that you've ministered to the Saints and
[54:21] you minister amen
[54:23] to see there's going to be some that
[54:25] they just partake of the Holy Ghost but
[54:27] they don't minister to the people of God
[54:29] see the difference some people are out
[54:31] there just trying to get the anointing
[54:33] to do things to build up their kingdom
[54:34] for money but others do it to glorify
[54:37] God and to help out the body of Christ
[54:39] amen
[54:41] glory and we desire that every one of
[54:44] you show the same what's what's that
[54:46] word again diligence see that all of our
[54:49] human effort is required to be the bride
[54:51] all of our human effort all of our
[54:54] earnestness we must say God add this to
[54:56] me add this to me I want to draw closer
[54:58] to you because now it's Paul and Peter
[55:00] both saying the same thing show
[55:02] diligence to the full assurance of hope
[55:05] unto the end that you be not slothful
[55:07] but followers of them who through faith
[55:09] and patience inherit the promises amen
[55:13] so brother man ties this scripture
[55:15] together he said it's impossible for
[55:18] them to come back
[55:19] he said it's impossible for that person
[55:21] never come back everyone besides Joshua
[55:25] and Caleb died in the wilderness in
[55:27] Paris of Lourdes yet they were believers
[55:29] yet their names were on the books so
[55:39] brother BAM says he and he's him he even
[55:43] calls it a gate he said in Paul speaking
[55:45] here if he ever comes to a spot he's
[55:47] been saved and sanctified and then comes
[55:49] right up to the gate of the baptism of
[55:50] the Holy Ghost he calls it a gate ah and
[55:55] because of prestige or denomination
[55:57] refused to walk in it said that person
[56:00] is lost and can never be saved for he's
[56:01] done despite even to the very works of
[56:03] grace it's calling him up to that place
[56:05] and shown it to him and then he turns
[56:07] around and walks away from it he counts
[56:10] the blood of the Covenant wherewith he
[56:11] was crucified Christ was crucified as an
[56:14] unholy thing because the blood that
[56:16] saved him and justified him and
[56:17] sanctified him brings him up to the
[56:19] baptism the Holy Ghost and then he walks
[56:21] away and leaves it
[56:23] he said now watch that pattern I'm
[56:25] taking a lot of time but look Judas
[56:27] Iscariot follow that same tracks he was
[56:30] justified by the believing on the Lord
[56:32] Jesus and then accepting him as the
[56:33] personal Savior he was sanctified and
[56:36] given power to cast out spirits but
[56:37] isn't put his name on the the book of
[56:40] life but when it come to the Pentecost
[56:42] and the Batsuit Holy Ghost the fullness
[56:43] of the word he showed his colors that's
[56:45] exactly what the Canaan spies did that's
[56:48] exactly what Esau did he
[56:52] that's exactly what Satan said to Eve in
[56:53] the Garden of Eden surely God will not
[56:55] but she said God said he said yea I know
[56:58] it says that I know it says is but
[57:00] surely see the same thing all the way
[57:02] down so it is today he said the church
[57:05] has followed through justification
[57:07] Martin Luther through thanks
[57:08] sanctification Wesley but when it comes
[57:10] to the time of the baptism the Holy
[57:12] Ghost they show their colors they want
[57:14] nothing to do with it Nazarene pilgrim
[57:16] Holiness Church of God all those there
[57:19] who believe in st. vacation you can't
[57:21] lay a finger and it's the truth
[57:22] but when it comes to the borderline
[57:24] comes right to the spot to receive the
[57:26] Holy Ghost for the new birth then what
[57:27] the devil do come around and try to
[57:29] twist it around oh he'll do everything
[57:31] that's in his known power to keep the
[57:33] people out of there amen don't you know
[57:35] all hell is against us getting to the
[57:37] Batchelor the Holy Ghost but all of
[57:39] heaven is behind us if we'll just
[57:41] believe it amen all of how he said Saint
[57:45] will do everything to keep people out of
[57:47] the baptismal there he goes that's why
[57:49] we got to be doing everything we can
[57:51] pray we can preach everything we can do
[57:53] to try to get people in there amen
[57:55] oh thank the Lord amen he wants tribes
[57:59] to camp on the outside of Jordan he
[58:02] wants just just live that kind of life
[58:03] because he doesn't want to be cast out
[58:06] of the promised land right Satan doesn't
[58:08] want those seven nations cast out of
[58:10] there but God wants to cast all of those
[58:12] demons out of there God wants the land
[58:15] to be possessed hallelujah with
[58:17] believers the RAM said don't you let no
[58:23] one tell you that sanctification and the
[58:24] Holy Ghost are the same thing because
[58:25] it's not it's certainly not oh thank the
[58:30] Lord it's not the same thing and then he
[58:36] gives the
[58:36] samples how brother man new Nazareth
[58:38] Christians that were sanctified but then
[58:40] they spoke evil the tongues and brother
[58:42] Bram said they blasting the Holy Ghost
[58:45] yet they come all the way up the same
[58:47] vacation but when you say oh you need to
[58:49] have a real experience and get born
[58:50] again you might speak in tongues they
[58:52] say that's the devil and program said
[58:54] they blaspheme the Holy Ghost right
[58:55] there and now the way to know is watch
[58:57] do they move on with God or do they camp
[58:59] out and denominator and we all know they
[59:01] denominator they never want more they
[59:04] never want to know what are the seals
[59:05] mean what does the rapture mean they
[59:08] never really cried to God for that
[59:09] revelation but it's laying right in here
[59:11] in the Bible that the mysteries of God
[59:13] should be finished amen and see they
[59:15] don't want to go on to that they don't
[59:17] want to believe God's in a profit they
[59:19] don't want to believe that see they
[59:20] stopped they camped out and many of them
[59:23] turn back and go back to the worldly
[59:24] things for pleasures of the world now if
[59:29] they generally don't understand church
[59:30] and they camp right out there and they
[59:32] can still be saved right because they're
[59:34] the they're that they're the type of the
[59:36] two and a half tribes but were the type
[59:39] of Joshua glory amen if you don't
[59:44] believe that say God help me to believe
[59:45] that so I can be one of those over
[59:47] comers amen now to see that they walk up
[59:57] to the border I like those spies did
[59:59] that eat part of the grapes but what
[1:00:01] they do have to do they'd have to break
[1:00:03] up their denomination and come over to
[1:00:05] this they say tasted the heavenly gift
[1:00:06] see seeing they have crucify themselves
[1:00:08] the Son of God afresh and count the
[1:00:10] blood of the Covenant wherewith they
[1:00:11] were saying to find an unholy thing he
[1:00:14] says sanctification does that see you
[1:00:17] come up when you trust it up this far
[1:00:19] then come up they say well would he know
[1:00:22] it yes he'd noted he knowed you wouldn't
[1:00:25] do it in the beginning he no Judas
[1:00:26] wouldn't do it he knowed him from the
[1:00:28] beginning he was a son of perdition but
[1:00:30] then thing has to be fulfilled the word
[1:00:32] has to be fulfilled all through the
[1:00:34] types and shadows he said we could stay
[1:00:36] on that for hours so see God knew Judas
[1:00:39] and those spies would come right up to
[1:00:41] the promised land but then fall away but
[1:00:43] he has to allow them to happen to
[1:00:45] fulfill the types in the scripture
[1:00:49] right now to me that was the most
[1:00:51] important quote there's if you just type
[1:00:53] in Judas and sanctify there's 14 quotes
[1:00:55] and it all says the same thing now let
[1:00:58] me get to the one where program said
[1:00:59] Judas never had faith to begin with and
[1:01:01] go to Romans chapter 8 and this is why I
[1:01:09] just misunderstood it you know I was
[1:01:11] just taking one quote but I doubt the
[1:01:19] other quotes and God forgive me you know
[1:01:21] what I was thinking probably in my mind
[1:01:23] was well I'll just take the one that's
[1:01:24] later since it's 1965 I'll take it later
[1:01:26] then the 53:54 and you know 64 I'll just
[1:01:31] take the later and you know I'll be
[1:01:32] honest I'm like anyone else I have to
[1:01:34] grow a revelation too and I want to be
[1:01:38] humble enough to say that now I don't
[1:01:39] have everything figured out I'm not God
[1:01:41] I don't have all the answers only Christ
[1:01:42] has all the answers but I want to be
[1:01:45] able to grow in grace and knowledge of
[1:01:46] the Lord so Romans 8 now this was the
[1:01:51] scripture that stumbled me and I
[1:01:52] appreciate right from this pulpit
[1:01:53] probably you know probably 10 20 times
[1:01:59] so I'm in Romans 8 I want to get to the
[1:02:04] scripture yeah 30 first 30 Romans 8 30
[1:02:06] so this is the scripture I was hanging
[1:02:08] on but I was also missing the other
[1:02:10] scriptures I read this morning moreover
[1:02:13] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:02:14] called and whom he also called he also
[1:02:16] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:02:18] also glorified now see how I was reading
[1:02:21] this thinking well if you're justified
[1:02:23] truly then you already have a glorified
[1:02:25] body but I was missing the other
[1:02:28] scriptures about how the Bible said he
[1:02:29] was sanctified already so this scripture
[1:02:33] is speaking of God's
[1:02:35] predestinated amen so those who God
[1:02:39] knows are going to continue in other
[1:02:40] words those who are going to continue in
[1:02:42] the faith God has already predestinated
[1:02:44] a glorified body for those who he knows
[1:02:47] are going to go all the way and so see
[1:02:51] that's what I was missing the word right
[1:02:52] there three does it was only for the
[1:02:54] predestinated that get justified because
[1:02:57] Judas got justified the 70 got justified
[1:03:00] but remember later Jesus said you must
[1:03:01] eat my blood
[1:03:02] or eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[1:03:04] they said see I'm leaving this church
[1:03:05] say yeah I don't want no more of that
[1:03:07] and they walked away as well because
[1:03:10] they had the wrong attitude in the
[1:03:11] beginning they thought it's just about
[1:03:13] me doing miracles it's about me me me
[1:03:15] instead they didn't have the attitude
[1:03:16] where it's about the Word of God amen
[1:03:20] and they're like well I can do miracles
[1:03:22] if I can understand it it must be of the
[1:03:24] devil if I could only have the
[1:03:25] understanding and said see that the
[1:03:27] wrong attitude they were looking at
[1:03:28] themselves and miracles rather than
[1:03:30] looking at the person of the word and
[1:03:32] saying I'll just believe whatever the
[1:03:34] word says where else could we go you've
[1:03:36] got the words to eternal life see they
[1:03:39] were in love with the gifts instead of
[1:03:40] the giver there it is right there
[1:03:42] they love the gifts but they didn't love
[1:03:44] the giver because when it come down to
[1:03:47] some deep thing of the Holy Spirit they
[1:03:48] I can't understand that but the Bible
[1:03:51] said he freely gives us the deep
[1:03:52] understandings of the things of God you
[1:03:54] just got a home of yourself to a babe
[1:03:56] just gotta say I'm just like a little
[1:03:58] child Jesus feed me teach me I'm just
[1:04:00] I'm humble nothing
[1:04:02] show me your great deep mysteries in
[1:04:04] really Church when you get down to it's
[1:04:05] real simple but you have to have the
[1:04:08] attitude first of on nothing I'm a
[1:04:10] humble help me Jesus just to understand
[1:04:13] it so see that's what I missed
[1:04:17] now also now it makes sense here in 1st
[1:04:20] Peter 1:9 so Lydia can you pull it up
[1:04:23] first Peter 1:9 and now if I combine it
[1:04:30] with this one now I got a better
[1:04:32] understanding Peter says receiving the
[1:04:35] end of your faith so say Judas never
[1:04:39] received the end of his faith because he
[1:04:41] sold it out but all those who received
[1:04:44] the end of their faith have a glorified
[1:04:45] body waiting for permission but those
[1:04:48] are the predestinated ones the ones that
[1:04:51] God knew would keep the faith to the end
[1:04:53] they're not the ones who draw back and
[1:04:55] leave the word right and leave the
[1:04:58] message they're the ones who stay with
[1:04:59] the word now does everybody can
[1:05:02] everybody see now why I say that so see
[1:05:05] that's where not now now I'd have a
[1:05:07] different opinion about the seat of
[1:05:08] discrepancy where brother have said
[1:05:09] Judas never had faith to begin with I
[1:05:12] would just have to disagree and say well
[1:05:13] I think he did because there's other
[1:05:15] quotes from Adam said he did have faith
[1:05:17] so see when you ever have quotes on both
[1:05:19] sides there's a you know the truth is
[1:05:21] somewhere you know it's either on one of
[1:05:23] those sides or in the middle in this
[1:05:25] case it was there it was the ones that
[1:05:27] were before because of what Hebrew says
[1:05:31] and what the scripture says okay a few
[1:05:36] more scriptures here and we'll try to be
[1:05:39] finishing up here let me make sure I
[1:05:41] didn't miss out anything okay yeah let's
[1:05:45] go to first Timothy 4 verse 4 just now
[1:05:47] these are familiar I just want to point
[1:05:50] them out to you first Timothy 4:4 first
[1:06:00] Timothy 4 for now I'm sorry for one
[1:06:07] sorry I wrote down the wrong number
[1:06:10] first Timothy 4:1 now the spirit
[1:06:12] speaketh expressly than the latter times
[1:06:14] some shall depart from the faith
[1:06:17] that's what Judas did he departed from
[1:06:19] the faith the faith never left him God
[1:06:21] will never leave you right but you can
[1:06:24] leave God thank God I'm never leaving
[1:06:26] him that means he'll never leave me
[1:06:27] praise God see they departed he left the
[1:06:31] faith he left Jesus he left that Last
[1:06:34] Supper what the death angel got him
[1:06:36] because he left the the house of the
[1:06:38] Last Supper right
[1:06:39] the death angel got him out there Satan
[1:06:42] entered into him so see it say they
[1:06:46] departed from the faith giving heed to
[1:06:48] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:06:51] see they leave it they draw back there
[1:06:54] are the ones that leave second
[1:06:57] Thessalonians 2 verse 3 this is a
[1:06:59] familiar one I just want to I'm you know
[1:07:02] bring this to your members second Peter
[1:07:06] 2
[1:07:06] I'm sorry second Thessalonians sorry 2
[1:07:08] verse 3 Paul says don't be shaken about
[1:07:11] the coming of the Lord and verses 1 and
[1:07:13] 2 don't get all shaken up don't let the
[1:07:15] devil try to sift you and try to shake
[1:07:16] up your your foundation you stand firm
[1:07:18] on God's Word you just stand there you
[1:07:21] stand on the solid rock your foundation
[1:07:23] is not shifting or singing sands your
[1:07:26] foundation is the rock of God's Word
[1:07:28] Paul tells them don't be shaken by say
[1:07:30] verse three let no man deceive you by
[1:07:32] any means for that day shall not come
[1:07:34] except there come a falling away first
[1:07:36] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:07:38] of perdition
[1:07:39] I don't doubt there there's some good
[1:07:41] people in the nominations right now but
[1:07:42] when it comes time for the rapture and
[1:07:44] the squeeze they are going to fall away
[1:07:47] either they're going to come out of her
[1:07:49] my people or they're gonna fall away
[1:07:51] they're gonna sell out whatever virtues
[1:07:53] they have a god they're gonna sell it
[1:07:55] out for money just like Judas oh my can
[1:07:57] you see that a great I'm sorry there
[1:08:02] come a falling away first yes I thought
[1:08:05] it said great but doesn't say great he
[1:08:06] just has a falling away so I don't want
[1:08:07] to add to the word there comes a falling
[1:08:10] away first and that means a falling away
[1:08:13] a defection apostasy just like Judas
[1:08:17] they depart the word they come up to the
[1:08:20] gate of the Holy Ghost and they turn
[1:08:21] around and don't want any more of it
[1:08:27] alright okay let me just do a few more
[1:08:32] quotes it's natural for man brother BAM
[1:08:35] says this well Ram said if you
[1:08:40] cept a little saying like you can't
[1:08:42] trust the Bible he said if you got that
[1:08:43] in your mind don't try to add it because
[1:08:45] it won't work the whole building will
[1:08:47] fall right down there and that was just
[1:08:51] knowledge faith virtue knowledge if you
[1:08:53] let somebody tell you oh you can't trust
[1:08:55] the Bible he said your building will
[1:08:57] fall down see the whole thing it's
[1:09:00] obscene God's building something and you
[1:09:02] add this add this add this he's building
[1:09:05] something he's building a temple of God
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:08] now I'm skipping ahead to another quote
[1:09:10] the man said temperance he says holy
[1:09:13] spirit temperance how to control your
[1:09:15] tongue not be a Tattler control your
[1:09:16] temper not flying off every time
[1:09:18] somebody speaks across to you boy a lot
[1:09:20] of us are gonna fall off before we get
[1:09:22] started aren't we then we wonder why
[1:09:25] God's not in this church doing miracles
[1:09:27] and things like they used to do see
[1:09:30] miracles and all these gifts it all
[1:09:32] depends on the anointing we bring to
[1:09:34] church or the anointing we live with in
[1:09:36] our daily life see Brennan said this is
[1:09:39] the reason why there's not more miracles
[1:09:41] in the church people are letting God
[1:09:43] build them up and say to that anointing
[1:09:44] all the time we can all say amen to that
[1:09:47] all right so the times where God has
[1:09:49] done miracles it proves we're on one
[1:09:51] Accord
[1:09:51] nobody was worried about this outside of
[1:09:54] church nobody was into that sin nobody
[1:09:56] was into that said nobody was had a
[1:09:58] schism in their family or they like that
[1:10:00] everybody come to the house of God and
[1:10:02] God's Spirit amen but we have to be
[1:10:05] patient even we have to go through times
[1:10:07] where there may be no miracles right we
[1:10:10] have to be patient with one another you
[1:10:13] have to be patient with me I have to be
[1:10:14] patient with you why because patience is
[1:10:16] one of those virtues see by medicine see
[1:10:20] a lot of us gonna fall off before we get
[1:10:23] started on that way she bowed and said
[1:10:30] see see how short we are brother and
[1:10:31] sister
[1:10:32] he said we have glory and shouts and
[1:10:34] things because we got faith but when we
[1:10:35] come down to these things here he God
[1:10:37] can't build us into that stature he
[1:10:39] can't he can't make us up to that kind
[1:10:41] of a place we got all these other things
[1:10:43] we fall down he said slide off with it
[1:10:46] see they slide off that that highway
[1:10:49] they slide off like a like ice on the
[1:10:52] road right you slide off
[1:10:54] he said see he can't build his church
[1:10:56] build he can't build his church people
[1:11:00] slide off or it falls off it just gets
[1:11:02] destroyed at school last week
[1:11:04] I taught him the stature of man and I
[1:11:06] got eight of these boxes and I had the
[1:11:08] students put faith virtue knowledge and
[1:11:10] I showed how God built the church faith
[1:11:13] virtue and now I don't struggle with
[1:11:15] this anymore now I got knowledge now I
[1:11:17] got temperance and then the devil come
[1:11:19] by and he took it away like that you
[1:11:20] know knock him down now not with charity
[1:11:23] though if you got charity though all
[1:11:24] those things are sealed into you but
[1:11:27] that's how it is God wants to add this
[1:11:28] but if people want to sell out to the
[1:11:30] devil the devil will knock it over say
[1:11:32] look what I've done
[1:11:33] now I've entered into Judas and now I
[1:11:35] can do evil things but we've got to let
[1:11:38] God so build us up and so cap us off
[1:11:40] that were always a part of the building
[1:11:43] of God that we can be a dwelling place
[1:11:45] for the Living God now let me try to
[1:11:48] find echo base to closer brother man
[1:11:51] says this he says that's the way some
[1:11:52] people can come up that high but man
[1:11:55] talks about sanctification and drop-off
[1:11:59] but there's a genuine part of that keeps
[1:12:01] making that building come on I will
[1:12:03] restore saith the Lord see boat man so
[1:12:05] you can come up this high but then
[1:12:07] thought all the way down oh my well I
[1:12:16] wonder you know we were talking a bit
[1:12:20] about this let me let's say into our
[1:12:21] feet here and let me just uh share this
[1:12:24] this this story here let me share two
[1:12:27] things out let's go to Ephesians four
[1:12:28] this deals with the fivefold ministry
[1:12:31] then I just want to share this story we
[1:12:32] were talking about with a message Church
[1:12:34] I just want to share that just I'll just
[1:12:36] try to shorten it Ephesians 4:14 see
[1:12:42] when we really tap into the power that's
[1:12:44] in the fivefold ministry because it's
[1:12:45] Christ power remember Christ got up in
[1:12:48] heaven and you know people might wonder
[1:12:50] well what would Jesus send to his church
[1:12:52] since he's in heaven what he decide to
[1:12:54] send was five preaching gifts a man he
[1:12:57] could have said anything sister Connie
[1:12:58] he could have sent angels to preach but
[1:13:01] he said instead I'm gonna save man
[1:13:03] through man amen
[1:13:07] that was God's pattern that it's never
[1:13:09] changed and he said God only works
[1:13:11] through man to save man he could have
[1:13:14] sent the most beautiful angels with
[1:13:16] wings and say Oh believe me
[1:13:18] get the Holy Ghost that everyone said
[1:13:19] yeah but he said God said I'm sending
[1:13:21] five types of preaching gifts that the
[1:13:24] Church of the Living God will believe
[1:13:25] the werden of God
[1:13:26] and I'll used man to redeem man pieces
[1:13:30] for 14 that we henceforth be no more
[1:13:32] children see the reason people are
[1:13:34] immature is because they don't listen to
[1:13:36] the fivefold ministry and it's not me
[1:13:37] like oh I'm not trying to exalt
[1:13:39] preachers what I'm saying is that God
[1:13:41] only speaks through preachers and if you
[1:13:43] want to be mature you've got to hear
[1:13:45] what the preachers are saying from the
[1:13:47] Word of God I've got to do it you've got
[1:13:49] to do it we all got to obey the
[1:13:50] preaching tossed to and fro and carried
[1:13:54] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:13:56] slate that means trickery like a like a
[1:13:58] card game like a gambling game by the
[1:14:00] slate of men and cunning craftiness
[1:14:02] whereby they lie in wait to deceive
[1:14:04] I like verse fears 15 but speaking the
[1:14:07] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:14:10] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:14:13] see how we're growing up what are we
[1:14:14] growing up into we're growing up into
[1:14:16] Christ the capstone amen
[1:14:22] so stay with the fivefold ministry and
[1:14:24] God will keep growing you up into Christ
[1:14:27] and that's God's ladder amen
[1:14:30] the stats for a man and it's through the
[1:14:32] preaching of the fivefold ministry that
[1:14:34] you'll grow up that ladder into Christ
[1:14:36] the Amen see it's not that it's not our
[1:14:40] plan it's God's plan it's not the
[1:14:42] preachers trying to say we'll pass on
[1:14:44] the back I can't even you you and I
[1:14:46] can't do nothing we're nothing without
[1:14:47] the anointing we're nothing without
[1:14:49] Jesus we can't help anybody without
[1:14:51] Jesus but when we get in the control by
[1:14:54] Jesus Jesus does great things amen
[1:14:57] this is why people go from one window
[1:14:59] dr. no.11 immaturity and a baby
[1:15:02] Christians they never grow up into
[1:15:03] maturity because they don't listen to
[1:15:05] the fivefold ministry but if we do we'll
[1:15:08] go right up into Christ or get closer
[1:15:10] and closer and closer to Christ until
[1:15:12] we're in Christ and Christ isn't us amen
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:20] said why don't I go to church he said I
[1:15:21] go to church for one thing that's to
[1:15:23] stay in your presence Lord let me close
[1:15:32] with this I just want to tell this story
[1:15:33] real quick most of you know it we were
[1:15:36] talking about it at at lunch we've seen
[1:15:41] a lot of people fall away from the
[1:15:42] message and it's it's sad it's
[1:15:45] heartbreaking but the ones I've seen
[1:15:49] fall I've known for preachers and all
[1:15:52] four of them I had to hear them I heard
[1:15:55] them preach on the Holy Ghost and they
[1:15:56] all preached it wrong they each one of
[1:15:59] them preached it wrong and all four of
[1:16:02] them said you got the Holy Ghost when
[1:16:04] you believed when you got saved and like
[1:16:07] I mean how many times his brother
[1:16:09] Brennan has to preach that and they
[1:16:11] never caught it they never caught it and
[1:16:13] all four of them I heard them three in
[1:16:16] person no two in person and two on tape
[1:16:19] they all said that and that's why that's
[1:16:24] one of the main reasons they left now
[1:16:26] the one example we gave was a young man
[1:16:28] and woman they got married and this man
[1:16:31] from what everybody says he was just
[1:16:35] that he just kept the word so much
[1:16:36] everybody thought he was so godly and
[1:16:38] all the girls liked him you know maybe
[1:16:40] they kind of thought he was great he had
[1:16:42] a great gift of music and things like
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:44] and he went through marriage counseling
[1:16:47] and everybody thought he was born again
[1:16:48] everybody thought he had the Holy Ghost
[1:16:50] but he went to the church where the
[1:16:54] pastor said you get the Holy Ghost when
[1:16:56] you believe yeah that's right
[1:17:03] sometime after their marriage this and
[1:17:06] this was a pretty prominent person this
[1:17:10] man got tempted with homosexuality and
[1:17:13] he divorced his wife and he's now an
[1:17:17] open homosexual and the reason I share
[1:17:22] that is because if someone is not truly
[1:17:25] baptized with the Holy Ghost and if they
[1:17:27] stop seeking God
[1:17:30] Satan's gonna get them if I mean if
[1:17:33] they're not foolish virgin right Saints
[1:17:36] gonna get them we must preach the
[1:17:38] baptism the Holy Ghost the right way and
[1:17:40] then we must never give up or back go
[1:17:45] back on God we must always go forward
[1:17:48] with the things of God and never feel
[1:17:50] like we've arrived now we can be happy
[1:17:54] if we feel like we're born again but
[1:17:55] don't stop there keep growing in Christ
[1:17:57] I just want to give that example and
[1:18:01] they were sitting under some of the
[1:18:03] biggest names and the message as far as
[1:18:04] the most respected men and I'm not I'm
[1:18:06] not downing message preachers I love
[1:18:08] message preachers I want to be one of
[1:18:09] them but I'm just saying like it doesn't
[1:18:12] matter which ministry you're under you
[1:18:14] and I every person has to have a
[1:18:16] revelation that they're born again yeah
[1:18:18] in fact I listened this preacher his
[1:18:21] resignation and this is he takes a quote
[1:18:23] from brother brand where brother BAM
[1:18:24] said a man was sinning his wife was
[1:18:27] saved his his wife game a track and I
[1:18:30] said where are you spend eternity and
[1:18:32] this man said he went to Billy Graham's
[1:18:35] but Billy Graham's meetings and Billy
[1:18:37] Graham said let's say a prayer and
[1:18:38] you're safe he did he said that was
[1:18:40] enough so he went to Oral Roberts and
[1:18:41] old Robert said speaking tongues and you
[1:18:43] got it and then he got it he spoke in
[1:18:44] tongues but then he wasn't satisfied
[1:18:46] he went to brother Branham and brother
[1:18:47] Graham said you've already got it now
[1:18:51] brother Ram this story brother I've
[1:18:53] never used it after the seals just so
[1:18:56] you know
[1:18:56] so this pastor got all caught up on well
[1:19:00] brother branham said you can get the
[1:19:01] Holy Ghost just by reading a tract but
[1:19:05] see this was an incomplete story brother
[1:19:06] been told this before the trip before
[1:19:09] the revelation came on the Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] and so see that's why this pastor in
[1:19:14] other words this pastors absolute was a
[1:19:16] story
[1:19:17] instead of the word there it is right
[1:19:19] there your absolute on the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] has to be the word not a story in other
[1:19:25] words do I know do I know have I
[1:19:27] experienced ax2 or not we must all ask
[1:19:31] ourselves what experience have we had
[1:19:33] have we had an axe to experience or we
[1:19:35] just trying to base our testimony off of
[1:19:37] something else as much as we respect
[1:19:39] stories and brother branham stories and
[1:19:41] all these things
[1:19:41] this proves right here you can't base
[1:19:44] your faith upon anything outside of the
[1:19:46] unfailing Word of God amen because even
[1:19:50] those of us who seem to be the most
[1:19:51] talented the most gifted the most
[1:19:53] anointing if we're not born again can
[1:19:55] fall away
[1:19:57] we must never say and brag and say well
[1:19:59] I'll never fall away I'll never leave
[1:20:01] Ghana we must never do that even brother
[1:20:04] Brad said that he said God could use me
[1:20:05] as a tool for something even brother
[1:20:09] Brad was humbled to admit he said I
[1:20:10] believe my name's written on lands book
[1:20:12] of life but God could use me as a tool
[1:20:14] for something so see how humble we got
[1:20:16] to be as here let's come to the piano
[1:20:18] here I better stop right here I hope you
[1:20:21] understand that now with this pastor
[1:20:33] like I said this church the church his
[1:20:35] brother went to allowed women to cut
[1:20:37] their hair allowed women to wear makeup
[1:20:40] had a very false stance on ministers
[1:20:43] marriage requirements this pastor also
[1:20:46] mistreated brother Brooks and made fun
[1:20:48] of him how he worshipped in the Holy
[1:20:49] Ghost as a master Church oh yeah big one
[1:20:55] he also allowed his children to listen
[1:20:58] to rock and roll in his home with
[1:21:00] headphones on and it's on tape I've
[1:21:02] heard it and program said if you want
[1:21:05] the token you better kick out that trash
[1:21:07] out of your house but this guy thought
[1:21:09] well I can teach a family camp
[1:21:11] everybody's looking to me it's okay for
[1:21:12] me to let rock n roll my house and it's
[1:21:14] not that's a a can move Aiken brought
[1:21:18] the evil in this house and said it's
[1:21:19] okay we'll just hide it no only goes for
[1:21:22] Christian we'll drive that out and then
[1:21:28] the six thing was the wrong teaching on
[1:21:30] the batches in the Holy Ghost so see
[1:21:33] there were red flags all around in
[1:21:35] sister County God knows before that man
[1:21:37] resigned I thought what in the world how
[1:21:38] can this guy be saved God knows I
[1:21:40] thought that how can this guy have the
[1:21:42] Holy Ghost he left the women paint their
[1:21:44] faces and wear makeup and rock and roll
[1:21:46] before he resigned he let his children's
[1:21:49] skip out of the services and sit in his
[1:21:51] office and listen to music and rock and
[1:21:53] roll and read books while he was out
[1:21:55] there preaching trying to get people to
[1:21:57] I don't know believe the message or not
[1:21:59] who knows that's what that's what
[1:22:02] deacons in his church I've told me that
[1:22:04] I talked to he was letting his adores
[1:22:07] our teenage children not even be in the
[1:22:09] service so they missed the worship the
[1:22:11] anointing they missed the preaching all
[1:22:16] because he was upset with some of these
[1:22:17] quotes and some of these people he let
[1:22:19] them sit out and that's wrong everybody
[1:22:22] needs to hear the word of God if you
[1:22:25] don't receive the Word of God you'll
[1:22:26] starve spiritually and see what were
[1:22:30] they doing he was letting them feed on
[1:22:31] the things of the world in his study
[1:22:32] rather than feed on the word of God and
[1:22:35] this whole time we knew something's
[1:22:37] wrong red flags are flying everywhere
[1:22:40] something's wrong with this guy he's
[1:22:41] making fun of brother Brooks with the
[1:22:43] Holy Ghost he's let them cut their hair
[1:22:45] wear makeup all these red flags and then
[1:22:47] finally in 2014 it shows up and now we
[1:22:49] know what happened we've got to go all
[1:22:53] the way in the Kanaan's land are you f
[1:22:55] me
[1:22:57] no matter where you feel like you are
[1:22:59] you've got to say it God I'm gonna go
[1:23:01] further in amen
[1:23:02] I want more of God's Word I want to grow
[1:23:05] in grace I want to grow up into Christ
