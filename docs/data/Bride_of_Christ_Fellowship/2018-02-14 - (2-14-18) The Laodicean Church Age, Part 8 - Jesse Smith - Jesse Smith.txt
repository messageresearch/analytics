my blessed Savior amen let stand for reading of the word here let's get into the Word of God today sort of Revelation chapter 3 I'd like to continue at the lair to see in church age tonight but I want to focus on Zeile and fervency tonight by God's grace so let's look at that thought for tonight relation 3:19 revelation 3:19 let's just read that verse we'll just read one verse together verse 19 let's read that on three one two three as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so we'll look at zeal tonight but let's just have a word of Prayer if you like Marzio or you'd like more fervency don't just raise your hands as we pray Heavenly Father Lord our heads are bowed but Lord in our hearts our hearts are raised or our hands are raised as a symbol Lord God the Lord we want to be zealous to serve you want to be fervent to serve you Lord God we want to feel Lord we want to feel the Visia we want to feel the fervency of Christ Oh God we want to feel your zeal in our hearts in our lives lord help us Lord tonight father we trust that your presence will accomplish Lord all that you desire to accomplish tonight Lord our lives are in your hands from beginning to end from the cradle to the grave our lives are in your hands to your God so bless us tonight in your divine presence Lord God we're grateful we give you praise Lord we surrender all Lord God we behold you on your throne we worship you no matter what the cost will still praise you Lord so we give you honor and glory in your house tonight sit have your way tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you just being seated to praise the Lord so let's look at this thought here tonight by God's grace already setting my watch so I'll try to finish in about an hour by the grace of the Lord so we ended Sunday with the thought about seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness we ended with that on Sunday by the grace of Lord so tonight we like to pick up where kind of where we left off in the church age book and just as update to I want to update on our family and our family is almost done with the Bible we got what how many chapters in Song of Solomon do you remember eight okay so we're on chapter five so pretty soon we'll be finishing up the Bible so we're gonna have a shouting rejoicing time there and then we're gonna start reading the church age book as a family together so if you want to read along with us you know we can read it all together you don't you a new family devotions or your personal devotions I don't know how many pages we'll read maybe one or two a day by God's grace but we're gonna start that pretty soon by the grace of the Lord so to update there on that situation now let's look at this thought here we looked extensively at how the false vine has this attitude of I'm rich and I'm increased with Goods I don't need any of the word don't need the real word of God for today the revelation of the word so if that's the case for the false vine the true vine must seek Christ threefold counsel or his advice and I'm sure you know as if your life's like mine there's been stages of your life where you wanted counsel from people all throughout my life I can look back and see you know there's times when I was right before I was ready to get hired as a teacher I went to Samuel browning for counsel because I knew he was a teacher and I asked him you know how do you get a job and what's the teaching life like and different ones you know before I went to before I became a pastor I went to talk to James browning and Samuel browning and before I started preaching I talked to her brother Tim Myers and brother Brooks and different ones and there was different times in my life where I was seeking counsel but Christ tells all of us we must seek his counsel he tells us quite plainly I counsel the so I'm advising you to buy of me the goal that's tried in the fire so we this is something we have to gain from Christ we have to purchase this from Christ the gold of God we also have to purchase the white raiment from him by of me this so make an exchange make a spiritual exchange and I'll gladly do that I'll gladly give up my unbelief for his gold amen I'll gladly said the Bible says buy the truth and sell it not amen we'll gladly do that how gladly buy all the truth I can get I'll give whatever it takes amen my time my repentance whatever it takes I'll buy the truth and I won't sell it amen he says the second fold is white clothes or white raiment that you may be clothed that the shame of your nakedness do not appear and the third thing is eyes that are anointed with ice I'll buy that from Christ that you may see and then Jesus says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten thus be zealous therefore and repent now let's look at some of this I didn't get to this on Sunday this is what I was trying to get to because when I wrote the book I finished chapter 8 with this thought I finish the last chapter with this idea and I took this the part right here about white raiment I took that and applied it spiritually and then naturally spiritually we must be must be closed with the eternal life which is the power of the Holy Ghost the seal of the Holy Ghost that the nakedness of our soul doesn't appear but then it also applies naturally because we live in an age where it's just like the days of Noah and the Bible said the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and of course they were probably sexy dress or they were dressed immodestly so we know there's a double application there's both spiritual and natural we understand that today by the grace of the Lord but let's look at some of these scriptures here so we need some Bible readers tonight by God's grace maybe Malachi Elijah and Lydia Rebecca could read some scriptures for so that'd be okay all right so let's go to first Peter 1:7 why don't Lydia why don't you get that one you're the oldest here we'll have you go first you're the bravest I'm sure first Peter 1:7 and Elijah can you get 2nd Corinthians 4:18 that'd be okay and Malachi can you get Matthew 13 five and six then Rebecca maybe Matthew 13 2021 alright okay so Lydia when you're ready first Peter 1:7 amen so when we buy gold from Christ it means we've exchanged our rights to act however we want we've exchanged that we've sacrificed worldly pleasures we've sacrificed our choices and we've chosen to accept the faith of Christ in other words we've chosen the hard way that's what the scripture is all about when you would get the gold of God gold is time-tested faith you have gone through the fires of God's tests amen so you've exchanged an easy life and Christ has given you the gold through hard trials that's what the exchange has done you could have taken the easy way out like the rich young ruler could have sold out your gonna take another easy ways out like missus lot you know you could have done other easy ways and not obey the Word of God but we but when you obey the Word of God and you go through fires of tests fires of affliction then Christ rewards you with gold character or christ-like character build upon faith so faith time-tested faith is the gold of God it's the character of Christ okay Elisha can you read 2nd Corinthians 4:18 please amen thank you so see the gold of God that go through the trials and so you have this faith as you go through the trials and this faith the word faith doesn't mean assurance it does mean that that's actual definition assurance on the promise of God or the revelation you're assured of God's Word because it's been revealed to you so as you go through the trials you have assurance in the unseen you're not looking at the natural situation you're looking at the spiritual situation amen you're looking at God's promises what God said you're not looking at the temporal things you're looking at the things that are unchanging amen that's how you have the gold of God you your faith is strengthening the fire your faith is looking at the unseen this is what Christ wants us to buy from him amen hallelujah and lastly there Malachi Matthew 13 five and six okay so the reason people don't have the gold character of Christ is because they fall away during the times of trial that's so they can't get the gold of God they're not they haven't sold out for that they haven't bought it you've got to actually go through persecution destitution you've got to go through trials hardships valleys we'd say but see most people give up now Rebecca can you read 2021 please in chapter 13 amen that's what we see here people can't get the gold of God because they give up times get too hard and so they compromise on the Word of God persecution comes they get offended oh I can't believe these Christians actually believe that well fine if they're gonna act like that we're not gonna go there now I was talking to a gentleman on the phone last week I invited him me to church and and he said well what is your church like and I said well the first thing you'll notice is the different dressed women that's because I wanted to be I would want to be straightforward I hold I want to hide nothing and and so he said what do you mean you women only wear skirts and all these things and what do you mean I said it's all in the Bible his name is Donnie I said Donnie it's on the Bible man I said when you really love Christ you'll want to do everything that he says and it's not it's not Grievous to obey God's commands it's a joy and pretty soon he got offended you know he I could hear in his voice now he's laughing a nice baby he's like he's like are you gonna instill your dress code upon me and I have to wear jeans and what do you mean I can't wear shorts you know and pretty soon he got offended you know I said oh don't get offended you know this is just God's Word I said you just come as you are come as you are and then whatever God reveals to you that's what you obey I said we don't enforce art we don't kick anybody out of church if you know if they have short hair if they're a woman or if a man's got dreadlocks we don't kick them out of the church you know that's never happened yet but you'll of course people coming here all the time your visitors coming here on time maybe not respecting our our beliefs but that's ok they probably don't know our beliefs but it's just so interesting to see how easily he was offended but this this is this scripture right here is why people don't get the gold of God they don't go through the fire you've got to go through the fire you've got to feel the heat you've got to feel the heat of persecution you've got to feel the heat of being offended right people are offended with you because you stand on the Word of God and only after going through that through the heat the persecution the heat of offending or the heat of offending your family and friends only after that can you have this gold faint that's tried by fire amen that's how it comes and Jesus said you've got to buy that from me if you want to get through later to see how you need the goal of God amen hallelujah now the light rain that amen this is beautified I was really blessed by this now look at the word righteousness here's what righteousness means I'm just gonna skip ahead a little bit it means integrity virtue purity of life rightness correctness of thinking and feeling and acting because we know the Bible said white raiment is the righteousness of the saints in Revelation 19 verse 8 so that righteousness means integrity so a Christian who has on the raiment of God is so anointed by the Holy Ghost that their lives are full of Christian integrity amen in other words they do what is right all the time amen hallelujah so that's again subscription I said revelation 19:8 now overcomers in the Sardis Church age the Bible said they owe their reward will be white raiment which is the righteousness of saints let's go to Romans 8 for this will be a good one for us to read Romans eight four and Lydia are you okay with that one now this is Romans eight it's a beautiful chapter I read it recently in my devotions if you haven't read it oh my I'd read it it talks about walking the spirit and then of course it ends with that beautiful string of promises deaths will not separate a sparrow nothing can separate us from the love of God amen revelation I'm sure Romans eight for Lydia when you're ready okay this is what God is trying to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's trying us to live the righteousness of the law I mean oh the Bible said the law is holy the law is good the Old Testament law was holy and good it cannot be lived if you try to do a checklist and live everything then you've gone back to legalism but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost then the Bible says you want to do what's right yes you want you freely surrender you're a prisoner of love and you always want to do what's right just in the sight of God that's integrity you always want to do what's right so righteousness is walking in the spirit I'm choosing to walk in the spirit and I'm not walking pleasing my flesh I'm walking obedience of the word of God remember jesus said when the Holy Ghost comes he said you'll be endued with power from on high and that word endued means clothing so the clothing of course has to be this white raiment so the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives you a spiritual it looks like a spiritual clothing where you have the power to live a righteous life and that's what righteousness is integrity or moral uprightness now and this is the clothes of the kingdom people let's go to Romans 14:17 this is a beautiful Romans forty logic can you read this one please so I should ask you sooner Romans 14:17 Amen this is the kingdom of God someone who's living righteous right someone who has peace in their life amen someone who's got joy of the Holy Ghost this is the kingdom people amen this is what it's not so much meat and drink it's not the natural things that you possess or choose the doer necessarily like the the areas of Christian Liberty we preach on that's not really the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is possessing all these spiritual qualities amen hallelujah people that want to live a life of integrity by the Holy Spirit people that want to live a life of peace people that want to live a life of joy of the Holy Ghost this is what we're striving for amen this is what we're battling for and Jesus says buy this from me you can have peace you just got to buy it from me you can have joy you can have righteousness just got to buy it from me and I he said I'm giving you counsel I'm giving you advice come buy this for me amen all right so that's the definition again I Sal let's look at I sell let's go to Ephesians 1 17 18 Malachi and maybe Rebecca if we get read out visions 1 17 and 18 myself is the understanding or we'd say the wisdom and revelation of our calling and inheritance in Christ that's what the Bible says because I sob of course would heal your eyes and allow you to see and that's what the Bible says about sight being your when your eyes are illuminated you understand God's calling for your life amen see only a person who's really filled with the Holy Ghost will understand the calling of their life and how important the calling of God is on their life visions 1 17 and 18 Malachi run don't you do 17 and Rebekah 18 as it is okay all right amen thank you that beautiful my when your eyes are enlightened by the Holy Spirit with the eye salve of God you have wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ and not only that but you Bible also says when you have that now you understand the hope of his calling what is the calling of Christ what is the calling of God for my life when you've got eyes of I self and you can see you understand what his calling is for your life there's a hope behind that and it's also you understand the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints you understand the possessions that are waiting for you on the other side all the treasures that are stored up in heaven amen you understand that when you've got the eye salve on that's that's because you don't live for today you don't live for tomorrow you don't live for next year you're not living for this world you're living for heaven amen that's people who have the eye cell that Christ offers they know the hope of their they know their inheritance and that's I was preaching on Tuesday morning with the middle schoolers I said that's what a priest does a priest stores up treasure in heaven remember Cornelius how did corneas get a memorial in heaven he fasted prayed and gave alms to the poor and so there was these memorials in heaven a memorial to corny noses prayers I'm like the Lincoln Memorial children's it looks like the Lincoln Memorial there was memorials in heaven amen there's memorials there's something there in heaven that's a witness of our desires to please God hey men we know the hope of our calling hallelujah that's beautiful night thank you Jesus I love the other Word of God it interprets itself but around calls that golden nuggets hallelujah your eyes have iced out and the Bible says your eyes are enlightened to know the hope of your calling and the inheritance of the saints amen now remember few will be saved according to Matthew 7:14 meaning most church members are blind followers blind leading blind followers of blind leaders jesus said let the blind lead the blind so they cannot understand the call of God if they're following blind teachers that God would never want them to follow a blind teacher so they are blind following the blind they don't know the hope of his calling they don't have wisdom in revelation but those who are saved those whose eyes have the ice-out they know the hope of their calling amen they know where they're going they know their life has a purpose they know their lives are storing up treasures in heaven hallelujah and notice Jesus said blessed are your eyes of those eyes that can see the truth repent and be converted let's read that Matthew 13 15 and 16 since we're already there in Matthew 13 so true eyes that are open to the Word of God will be able to be healed their lives will be healed they'll be able to repent and they were able to be converted with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I think the truth I don't know it is I'll let you amen this is eyes that have ice al bond them weatherman called it grease that's how he tried to get that people to remember to grease I've never had to use grease or anything but I have had to rub my eyes to get the matter out of my eyes but he had grease Matthew 13 15 and 16 I'll read this for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart see again they don't understand up there unless they have ice-out they'll understand what God has for them lost my spot and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear amen aren't you glad you've been converted praise God hallelujah if you have been your eyes have been anointed your eyes can see glory this is what Jesus said your eyes are blessed when they're like this praise the Lord now let's look at this thought on being zealous and repent worried what the prophet of God wrote in the church age book and then was just end with the Bible study cuz I got about 36 more minutes that's that'd be good I think we'll get through the Bible study here so I want to look at this thought on zealous and repent here's what brother Branham says be zealous to repent now this false Church has zeal make no mistake about that her zeal has literally been that of the Jews John and I think they courted the wrong scripture here in the church age book just because this is about Jesus the zeal of night house has eaten me up I think they wrote the wrong scripture down he said her zeal has been literally that of the Jews the zeal of the house has eaten me up but it is the wrong zeal Jesus zeal was the right Zeos I think remember the church age book ain't a Bible says it's not the Bible shouldn't say ain't it is not the Bible that's not a real word but see they've got the wrong zeal the Jews had the wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building right we see that today with denominations I've told you recently I visited some Pentecostal churches the loudest cheers were for the brand-new building they were building it wasn't for worship it wasn't for praise it wasn't for somebody at the altar wasn't behold our God it was oh he got we're almost ready to build our new church there was more zeal for buildings than there was for the spiritual blocks that were being builded into people's lives amen we ought to have more rejoicing in what God is doing spirits in our lives than naturally hallelujah it just shows what is our zeal what are we most excited about at church see in somebody's new shoes well maybe we'll get a new building or maybe we'll do this or maybe we'll do that the zeal we should have the most excitement we should have is what God is doing right now praise God knowing what God is doing right we don't want to be good just remember we did yesterday or think about what to do in the future we have to see what God is doing right now amen he said it was for their own creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they disposed the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even church conformity rather then good works just do what the church says just act like everybody else and you'll be saved they change that instead of being born again by the Holy Ghost just try to fit in just try to conform just try to act like it we don't want that we want you must be born again amen that's the only way that's what our zeal should be for not for buildings not for physical things not for natural things but for the Word of God that's right but God is calling for another zeal so see the latency and zeal is for natural things but God has a different zeal it is the to cry I'm wrong look at that now who is going to say that he is wrong that's a good question doesn't happen much at least outwardly which is okay you know you don't have to come to the altar every time you want to say say God I'm wrong forgive me you have to come to know every time for that but we should ask ourselves when was the last time we said God I'm wrong and thank you for correcting me help me to be right that's what the seal Christ is looking for for someone who can actually say it's my fault I see everyday as children why they're fussing or why they're arguing and they'll blame it on the other person I was and they made it is and I asked two or three today I asked him who's thinking who's in charge of you are you in charge of you as your friend in charge of you she made me do it is she in charge of you or you in charge yourself and they always say I'm in charge of myself because I talk my thinking of the year you're in charge of yourself right it's your choice and see God wants somebody who wants to take ownership and say I'm wrong it's my fault God wants somebody to zealously say it's my fault forgive me Lord who's going to say that he's wrong not many people today what is it that all these denominations are based upon that claim to originality and that of God they claim that they are right they all cannot be right in fact not one of them's right there widest up liquor swill of dead men's bones they have no life they have no vindication the program tells us later what the vindication is down here hallelujah God has never made himself known in any organization they say they're right because they're the ones that are saying it but saying it does not make it so they need the vindicated thus saith the lord of god and they don't have it amen so what makes us right and yet not prideful what makes us right is that God has given us thus saith the Lord and that we have received thus saith the Lord we have received the authority of the interpretation of the word of God amen our authority doesn't go over to Jeffersonville necessarily our authority doesn't go to any denomination or organization our authority goes to what was said thus saith the Lord about Bible amen that's where our thority lies in the stay at the Lord this is not my thought or your thought this is what the Lord says amen and church somebody's gonna have to say we're the original church somebody's got to say it it might as well be us amen might as well be us as long as we're not taking away from the word as long as we're on adding to the Word of God it might as well be you and I praise God somebody's got to be original I'm one of those original Holy Ghost filled Saints amen hallelujah if you would have been the day of Pentecost I'd have been shouting up there in the upper room out of them praising God I would have fire over my forehead I'd have been speaking and praising God with the wonderful works of God how do you know because I'm doing it tonight amen all right I knew it constantly I do it consistently it is the desire of my heart to know God more and to make more people know about God amen someone's got to be original and I know I preach that original Word of God hallelujah that's right that's right church week someone's got to be original and we must be original we must be original Christians hallelujah back to the beginning and we must have a zeal for it and if we're wrong we must have a zeal to say I'm wrong now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false church to repent in this verse he's talking to his elect because as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore the ones that I love many of his children are still in those false churches they are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light to be asleep as not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead they're out there in the dead denominations they are floating along with them God cries out wake up repent of your folly amen I'm so glad God went flying over the Christian Missionary Alliance about 12 years ago and called out brother bang Isla Delia and he came forth repenting right I'm so glad he flew over the Delta Assembly of God where I was and the Lutheran Church where where my wife was I'm so glad he had elect that could hear the lawyer to come out say I was wrong on baptism I was wrong on women's hair I was wrong on these things but I want to be right amen and I'll zealously say forgive me I was wrong let me be right that's exactly right I was stirred up today brother bang said he said sent me a text he said brother Jesse can I translate you're bought your book into a mom I said brother that's the kind of zeal we need amen but I said wait till we get it finished so I got Matt lighting to read it brother John's gonna read it brother Simon brother cam and somebody else over the Brian Hawkins so far those are the people that can help me out read it so far so I said give me your Corrections by Sunday I want to try to finish in about a week and then move it on to my wife and then on to a professional editor by God's grace I thought my zeal see that's what we need zeal to let the mother Eagle fly over the chicken yard and find her loss Eagles a minute hallelujah we need zeal to win those souls amen that's right church that's beautiful he says he says they're floating along with them God cries out wake up repent of your folly now we're almost done with this partner will do a little Bible study here here they are lending their in I love this here so there's there there were elect Christians that were lending their influence how many know you got influence you and you can influence somebody's like for parents is very easy our influence our best influence is with our children and each other our husbands our wives but everybody has influence so the elect were in denominations they were lending their influence giving their time and their money actually their very lives to these Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it is all right they need to repent wow they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth I know this for sure I could tell you this and I know cam and Simon wouldn't mind me telling but when they first came to Jesus they were in the denomination of the delt assembly God and they thought to the nail with people that didn't agree with the Assembly of God denomination they had a lot of zeal for that organization they were giving their time influencing money just like I was giving my time influencing money to the chapel I was trying to give I was giving my all my energy of my money everything I was giving my words I was giving everything - denomination and God said you've got to repent you got to come out and you got to give the message your influence praise God you got to give your time and money to the message you got to give your very life to the message Amen I mean here yeah Amen that's beautiful so we have some repenting to new I'm gonna give my time my influence my money I'm gonna give everything all my life to this word of God and I'm happy to do it but as I said yes this is the age that must I'm sorry most needs to repent but with it will it bring back the word willin again in throne the Holy Spirit and men's lives will it again Revere Jesus as the only Savior I say not for the next verse reveals the astounding and shocking truth of the close in this age now I'm not going to jump to that verse let's look at 0 versus being fervent and we'll take a few minutes I got 25 more minutes on my watch I'll try to finish up in that time by God's grace I think I'll be able to do it now we get the word zealous I came across that word zealous in revelation 3:19 he's talking to his elect his elect will be zealous and it's interesting you know the last few years we've seen amen and who are coming the message and brother Adam and they have all shown zeal to repent because they used to live certain lives and do certain things I mean I know a lot of the details because I was right there after they got saved and I had numerous talks with them and I was concerned about certain things you know just like people are concerned about me when I come in the message I'd I had a brother tell me recently he was concerned when I first come in the message that I I wouldn't stay in the message he said because you know sports and athletics and all these things like that that kind of hacks a little bit but that's just him you know you he probably had so many people come in and out you know how it is we have the same thing here but they were zealous you know how do you know because they left everything that they used to know to follow the Word of God they cut themselves off from denominations and youth groups and and fellowships with people that enjoyed worldly pleasures they cut themselves off and they show great zeal to say I'm wrong well Jesse teach me what's right now it's very glad to teach them what's right so they could have a seal they could show Jesus their zeal to do what's right now the word zeal aside kind of made it smaller but zealous means to burn with zeal to heat it or to boil with injury and and be hatred or anger so zeal is a really serious word zeal means you're boiling hot in a good sense to be zealous in the pursuit of good in other words I'm boiling and I'm gonna get to that goal I'm gonna get to that promise of God amen that's zeal zeal is I'm boiling over and I'm gonna do something good for the kingdom of God that's what zeal means to earnestly pursue nothing is going to get my way of making the rapture amen how did I know yeah nothing's going to get my way of glorifying God in my life of having a better prayer life amen nothing's gonna get in the way of me reading my Bible and knowing more about the knowledge of God hallelujah nothing's going to get my way because I've got zeal that's what does it zeal is that boiling power in our lives that gives us that desire to pursue and actually achieve what we're pursuing to strive after to desire earnestly too busy oneself about him to exert oneself for one that he might not be torn from me so see holding on to the word right holding on to the promise of God to be the object of zeal of others to be zealously saw after to envy be zealous and what repent that's the call for the elect of this hour so have a earn earnestly pursue repentance I'm going to repent I'm gonna leave everything I used to know in the world everything I used to love I'm just gonna run away from it as hard as I can and I'm gonna pursue righteousness glory zeal and fervency are very closely related now pay attention I don't not a Greek scholar but notice the number here sorry 2020 206 for zeal now look at the word fervent it's number 20 204 and I know there's some relation there with root words and root meanings there's some relation with the number in the concordance so the word fervent is very similar to boil with heat to be hot of water metaphorically use a boiling anger boiling love boiling zeal for what is good fervent spirit set of zeal for what is good so it's kind of like fervency and zeal are synonyms they kind they both mean boil I proved that to you by the Greek they both mean boiling their numbers are really close together so that looks like they have something similar about them Zi Luo Zelo and then that's Jo so they're really close words there now I'm gonna go back let's just to Bible study here on this by God's grace I got about twenty minutes now yep 21 minutes let's just do a scripture study here let's start with zeal now remember this is a boiling curve it I'm sorry boiling desire so there's numerous scriptures I think I members just hit a few of them here most of us remember Phineas I remember ragin have you remember Phineas he was a Jewish man and let's just Rita this chord number is 25 11 let's go there numbers 25 11 let's read that and maybe Lydia and Elijah maybe we can read that their numbers 25 11 now you know the story most of you may know it Balaam had joined forces with King Balak I always so I always say barrack but it's Balak it's Balak and he wasn't supposed to he couldn't curse Israel but he said I know I can get Israel to fall I know how I can get God angry in Israel and that's the cause and the fall into fornication so he invited them to beoh peor and they had a feast down there a drunken party with women and they fornicated and God destroyed 24,000 if not more there's different there's a few different scriptures that talk about but over 20,000 people that were killed because of the fornication numbers 25 11 12 and 13 Lydia run it you do 11 and 12 and Elijah 13 to that oh yeah did he go ahead 13 amen thank you what was his atonement he went into the tent of that Israel leader and he thrust a spear through him and that midnight woman that was his atonement and God looked at the zeal and said your family now is going to have a covenant of peace you're gonna be priests in Israel forever because he so wanted to see sin stopped in his church can I say like that God loves zeal as long as it's the right kind of zeal God loves it God rewarded him with the priesthood forever that's quite striking here's another one you remember once we read it well let's read about Jihu again let's go to 2nd Kings 10 this is right after he slew Jezebel he wasn't done after that this man had the zeal of God he was not done destroying God's enemies that's quite striking so second Kings 10:1 231 we're not gonna read all this but let's just read a few of the verses because it's quite powerful alright now I'll just read some of these here let's go to verse 7 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the king's sons and slew 70 persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jezreel and there came a messenger told him saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons and he said lay ye them and two heaps at the entering in of the gate until morning and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said all the people ye be righteous behold I conspired against my master and sue him but who slew all these know now that there shall fall on to the earth nothing of the word of Lord which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab for the Lord had done that which he spake by servant Elijah Shoji who slew all that remain of the house that they have been Jezreel it all his great men and his kinfolks and his priest until left them none remaining he destroyed all the seat of a hem all the seat of their offspring of Jezebel and then he met a brethren and one of the brethren said who are you and this is quite striking this is where he says it look at verse 16 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the Lord he wasn't done yet he was gonna go kill more of the Habs offspring and Jezebel's offspring and they made him ride in his chariot so he said sit in my chair it come see my zeal for the Lord remember what did this woman do she moved her husband to kill innocent people hundreds of godly priests she killed she painted her she introduced idolatry into Israel built a temple in Samaria the biggest temple ever and this is what Jay who does is powerful for this remember this is the story where G who tricks them and he says he said oh if a hab did a little for bail he said gee who's gonna do great things for bail he said and by all the bail worshippers to the house of bail and they all came they flooded the Church of bail and then G who tricked him and he said shut these and lock the doors he says because every one of these bail worshipers is gonna die and the Bible said he's through every one of them by tricking them and that he said come see my zeal amen so zeal is terminating any evil influence in your life that's why I got great respect for people if their phone is bothering them or an app's bother them they need to get rid of that app they need to get rid of their phone if they don't have the character to handle a phone get rid of the phone you've got to cut it off right either cut it off or God will cut you off from the anointing like we preached on God delights in people who are zealous to repent amen that's exactly right and this is the story that's what the Bible says now look look at verse 30 look what God blesses Jihu with now G who back slid at the end of his life I don't know if you knew that but he backs it then of his life but God because of his zeal in this moment of anointing God blesses four generations after him four generations now a member of the Bible says the cursings go to generations but also the blessings go to generations because remember Levi payed ties while he was in the loins the private parts of Abraham Levi was somewhere in the loins of Abraham and God already saw his righteousness that Levi is gonna pay me ties amen glory it's going to visit generation upon generation upon generation I'll say of this I'm excited to see what the generations of my children are gonna do a pen if God has done this in my life if God cut out all this sin and reverse curses of my family oh I want to see what God's gonna do in my generations ain't met if he tarries but I'll be happy if we take a rapture amen but either way if God terry's I want to see the righteousness visit the next four generations look at verse 30 and the Lord said unto G who because thou has done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and that's done unto the house that I have according to all the ways that was in whose heart God's heart it was in God's heart to kill those men because God is a God of judgment God is a faithful judge it was God so I remember they cut their heads off and put him in heaps remember that whose heart was that in that was in God's heart because God had given them a temporary judgment because of all their sins there we would say like this they're reprobate Minds I mean though the Bible says God is long-suffering in this hour God is rich in mercy God is so long-suffering in this hour that was in God's heart to throw Jezebel off there and that's hard church it might be hard for some people understand but that was in God's heart to have the chair run over her and the dogs lick her blood because of all the evil that she brought upon the people of God that's the Bible so now make up don't look so good does it does it cutting off God's prophets not listening bad-mouthing God's prophet doesn't look so good does it now because God said I'll visit the next generations and destroy them look at verse 31 but G who took no heed to walk in the law I'm sorry I didn't even finish that let's finish verse 30 has done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine are thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel amen because you executed my judgment your children will rule amen a church if we can rule over flesh sin the world the devil maybe our children will rule over those things for three and four generations amen if God Jerry's Amen if God could help me to reign over sin how much more my children reign over sin hey man how do ya thank you Jesus amen what a blessing what a what a great victory our lays ahead for the believer Amen that righteousness will visit the next generations but lo here's where G who falls so see this is a good case of zeal that doesn't continue we must make sure our zeal never never dies what brother M say he said never lose your what that he word never lose your enthusiasm your zeal never lose your zeal G who lost his zeal look at verse 2 the only one but G who took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord of God of Israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam which made Israel to sin so he got anointed a guy excited for a few years had some real great pouring out the wrath of God but when the anointing left him for that he back slid he lost his zeal we've got to make sure we don't lose our zeal that old phrase got to make sure we keep our first love but God will reward you for your zeal hallelujah you like that church you like that now Psalm 69 9 we're not going to go there but it's the same as John 2:17 they looked at Jesus clearing out the temple above moneychangers and said the zeal of the Lord have eaten me up Jesus was consumed with holiness a holy burning desire God's house must be a house of prayer we shouldn't come to church and try to make thing about deals we can make financially that's what they were coming to church do it a bunch of thieves a bunch of money changers Amen yeah we must come to church saying God provide for my needs but not how can we make a bad deal and how can we get rich quick and all these things like that we should come to the house of God in prayer that's right Church and then when he clean out that dirty old church they said all the zeal of the house has eaten him up he's so zealous he's knocking tables over he's letting the animals fly right he's a he's getting oh corn out and whipping all the all the disobedient ones making a move to get the sin out of the church and brother BAM said we could use some he said some pew jumpers in this hour he could say we could use some of that throw to overview sometimes if sin is allowed to exist in our myths we should cut it off and those preachers are cut it off they have the zeal of God God will honor them amen that's why we've God has honored many of these preachers that we listen to that have lasted for so many years because they've always cut against sin God loves that God loves the zeal the Lord that'll skin our hide or skin anybody's hide in order to produce a righteous life go to Isaiah 9:6 this is familiar let's read this one but I'm not sure if you saw this afterwards Isaiah 9:6 the burning fervent desire of God will do this the boiling hatred anger or in a good sense the the zealous pursuit of good God is going to pursue what is good his word is going to come to pass Isaiah 9:6 now can't even read that for me amen I mean remember that scripture that's pretty familiar right we always say that Christmas time well let's read the next one let's read it seven of the increase of his government and peace shall there be no end upon the throne of David what's that speaking of the Millennium and upon his kingdom to order and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever what is going to perform the Millennium how is Jesus gonna be to the throne of David the Bible said the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this glory God has a burning boy desire to pursue his prophecies God's Word is gonna come to pass so in order we shouldn't stand against it we should rally behind it hey Laurie we should be excited for the rapture we should be excited for the millennium we should be excited for the marriage supper we should get behind that we should say even so come Lord Jesus amen that's right the zeal of God is going to do this God's burning pursuit of the righteous prophecies that he's given that will bring the millennium to pass and I'll bring the rapture to pass God's own zeal ha ha ha oh thank you Jesus thank you Lord now let's do a few more he's got about eight minutes we probably won't get to fervor well maybe I am you can do a few Furman it's there's a lot less scriptures on being fervent okay here's where we got a balance though 1st Corinthians 14 12 let's go to 1st Corinthians 14 12 hey Rebecca you want to read this one is that do that ok first Corinthians 14 12 never you ready think all right so the Corinthian church was very zealous for gifts but Paul says you've got to kind of guide that zeal and make sure that you put more emphasis on edifying everybody so try to invest in the gifts that will edify the most people which are what prophecy let me know that prophecy when it's understood everybody understands it praise God and if we want to see more that we got to pray more we got to invest in the gifts of God you have to be just as interested in someone prophesying and service as you are in the preaching of the word we ought to be just as interested in God using us perhaps to prophesy as every other person the church as Loras is interested in the piano or Malachi or myself interested in preaching we must be all interested in the gifts of God so our zeal you must be we must it's good to have seal but the seal should be it with gifts concerning gifts it should be to identify as many people as possible so in other words we just we'd be happy if one person speaks in tongues but we'd be happier if a prophecy went forth and everybody understood the word of the Lord that's right now here's one we can all have to go to Colossians 4:12 and I trust everybody will have this one cautions for 12 and 13 so Lydia and Elijah maybe we can get ready for this for claw shins for 12 and 13 Lydia why don't you read 12 and lies you can read 13 please never you ready honey yep cautions for 12 so Epis ephesus I'm sorry Epirus was fervently praying for the Saints in Calais fervently another good verse 13 lad you when you're ready yeah thank you yeah good guy that's good guess I'm not sure what it is either now look Paul says I'm a witness Epirus is zealous for the Saints of the Colossians and how do you know he was zealous he prayed fervently for them he would just get on his knees and pray over and over and over he kept praying for the individual and church let's have a burden let's have a burden to pray for somebody praise God whether it's brother Simon going to Thailand next month or maybe it's brother Craig going to Japan we should have a burden first you can have a burden for our church you can have a burden for anybody but have a burden of fervent desire to pray for people this is a ministry everybody can have this is a zeal every Christian should have remember zeal can be misguided remember this this is in the scriptures go to Romans 10 to zeal can be misguided as we saw with the gifts it gave me if you just like the Pentecostal church their zeal is just for one gift that edifies one person so there are seals misguided Romans 10 - in this case the zeal the Jews is misguided because they reject Christ Romans 10 - I'll read this one for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge because they're ignorant of the righteousness of Christ if you read verse 3 so they have zeal just like a lot of religions do today a lot of churches have zeal today but it's misguided it's not according to the truth of God's Word now I got two minutes so we'll just finish with zeal we probably won't go to fervency let's go to Psalms 119 I'm gonna close here Psalms 119 so how many we can see God has zeal how many people can see Jesus had zeal how many people can see we should have zeal and prayer amen I recency we should have zeal for people being edified by the gifts of the Spirit more people being edified praise the Lord that's wonderful this is what we should see that Angie and God Zia will bring this all to pass God zeal songs 1:19 now there's numerous verses let's go to 139 no Psalms 119 139 big chapter I think it's the biggest chapter in the Bible for not mistaken Psalms 119 139 all right lady can you read that for me why was David zealous because his enemies had forgotten the words of God think about people that seem to be your enemies when they don't know the Word of God do you get zealous and you want to show them God's Word does it make you when you see people not live the word does it make you want to live the word in front of them it ought to because you're a city on a hill that cannot be hidden amen David got zealous when he saw people sitting oh the zeal of God has consumed me these people aren't living for Christ but I'm gonna live for Christ amen that's what he's saying of course if he's a New Testament believer my enemies have forsaken the Word of God and that's what and that's why church you know with this believe the sign move that makes me jealous when I see how they've left the message and and they're a condemning brother branham that makes me zealous because they've forsaken the Word of God and that makes me stand with him all the more praise God that makes you want to live the message more than ever because I got zeal because this is the Word of God and I've sent three or four of those people through emails they've contacted me no different ones that follow that movement and I said go to our church we believe page go to the page at where I wrote everything we believe I said show me one thing that's against the Bible and they never could bring anything back because we are we have the one-five there's only one faith and you and I are earnestly contending for the faith that was once given to the father's hallelujah and our zeal ought to be stirred up when we see people not living the word so young young people young church when you see people not living the word it ought to make you zealous oh oh lord help them pray for them right that right it should when you see people not obeying the Word of God amongst your friends you should have a seal to pray for them that's what we should have as adults all my friends aren't serving god lord do something for them help them and help me to be the example huh me to be a light so they can see what it means to be a real Christian glory now go to verse 113 so a little earlier 1:13 verse I hate vain thoughts but they law do I love he was so zealous he had hatred for any sin so I hope you can see this you've probably probably heard about it before but the more zeal you have for God the more hatred you have for sin because their complete opposite spiritual forces zeal for God causes extreme hatred for sin that means you'll hate seeing people sin on videos right you'll hate that you'll hate when a person cusses and use the name of the Lord in vain at your workplace or at your job or out in public you'll hate that because it's vanity because it's sin it's wickedness because you have a zeal you have a burning passion for the pursuit of God's Word amen don't worry all right let's go to verse 53 in the same chapter so the kind we worked our way backwards in the chapter Psalms 119 53 he was so zealous look at this one's church horror now Halloween time we always see those horror picture shows or advertisements for the horror corn mazes right David felt horror had taken a hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage I remembered thy name o Lord in the night and have kept that law this I had because I have kept that precepts see when we are keeping the Word of God it makes us so has sad it tears us up to see people breaking the law of God when we have a zeal for God's Word and we're obeying God's Word let's say in our future this is the zeal of the hour Christians who can repent who can have a burning pursuit for the good things of God and God will honor if God honored Old Testament families with generations of blessings with offices forever what will he do in this hour he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord he's the same yesterday today and forever boiling fervent zealous boiling these words are born to us lukewarm is just a toned down version of fervency of zeal just toned down lukewarm is kind of it's tepid right it's medium it's got a medium desire we need a burning desire Church I'd say right now I've got a zeal to write that book I've got a zeal to read that thing that's all I think about get that thing published try to get it in the hands of people I've got a zeal for that no one has to ask me to do that I'm motivated to do that because I think it can help people I know it can help people because the Word of God constantly helps people let's just bow our heads now take a moment church think about your life here America and when you're ready to come to the piano are you zealous are you boiling over in the pursuit of doing something good for God your heart is constantly boiling and constantly thinking new thoughts about the Word of God and how great God is and how loving God is that's what fervency is that's what zeal is when you see people cuss when you see people commit adultery I know many of our family members are involved in that I have so many aunts and uncles involved in that when we see that that should make a zealous to do what's right even more that should cause us horror to see the abomination is done in our families in this city David said Horrors come about me because of the wicked that forsake the law of God this is what real zeal produces and Jesus said counsel to me to have these things be zealous and repent now you don't fetch your hands would think about it and say Lord in my heart Lord I need more zeal for some reason I'm not as zealous as I need to be I want to be zealous for gifts to edify everybody I want to be zealous with a prayer life I'm gonna have me zealous with a burden to pray for somebody maybe a missionary maybe my husband maybe my wife maybe my mother maybe a father maybe an ER uncle Heavenly Father we love you Lord tonight Lord your word is forever sound having your word is true dear Lord Lord you've asked for Zeeland thus our repent and me zealous but we didn't get the other fervent scriptures but the Bible tells us all Christians are called to be fervent in spirit that's their thinking serving the Lord the fervent prayer of the righteous man or woman prevails much above all things we should love each other with fervent love with fervent charity Lord in this hour we have no excuse to be lukewarm you've given us the revealed word you've broken off the seals now the whole Bible makes sense now the whole Bible flows there's continuity through the whole scripture the unchanging God from Genesis to Revelation Oh God stir our hearts tonight dear God we pray for fervency we pray for zeal Lord God that we would hate sin we'd hate any vain thought anything that's a useless waste of our time help us to hate those things dear God with the holy hatred because we know your zeal will bring the rapture to pass it'll bring in the Millennium we know your zeal will accomplish all these things Lord perform your word performing in me performing in your people Lord God help us to be enthusiastic about the word of the Lord grant it jesus not lackadaisical not relaxed not lukewarm not semi hot but help us to have a boiling desire to do what you'd have us to do
