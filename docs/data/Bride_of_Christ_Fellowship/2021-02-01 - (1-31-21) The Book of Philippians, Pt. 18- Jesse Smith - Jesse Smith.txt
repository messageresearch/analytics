[Music] our god is a great provider praise god he supplies all of our need praise the lord god is so good yeah i think of it all down through history every age you know this is the age of plenty uh technology we have all this technology to get everything we need yet all the times before this god has provided every person's need just amazing to know how great he is how wonderful he is and we can give praise and honor because he's the faithful provider praise god he's a faithful heavenly father and he deserves all the praise today philippians 4 19 let's read 19 and 20 and then we'll have a little word of prayer let's read verses 19 and 20. let's begin on three one two three but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus now unto god and our father be glory forever and ever amen praise god just a few prayer requests let's remember brother amen's work situation he's got some things he's praying about there also brother stephen's work situation the girls would like prayer for salvation for their friends and any other needs tonight does anybody else have anything they'd like remembered in prayer praise god i don't know if everybody heard the testimony on wednesday but jose came in here wednesday and said doctors one month ago told him he had glaucoma and they told him on tuesday he didn't have glaucoma so let's thank the lord for that praise god amen we just sing that song we will see miracles we'll see giants fall praise god if so doctor told you you had glaucoma and then the next month he told you you don't you'd say a giant fell wouldn't you amen praise god amen so thank the lord for that god is great god is merciful and so we give god praise no matter the situation as we said on wednesday no matter if the doctors got it wrong or if it was there and now it's completely well god gets all the glory and uh remember we know devils like to work by getting you to believe a lie right first and then this evil spirit can come upon us so either way it is a true blessing from the lord because that's how many demons enter just by getting you to accept their thought right but we cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of god glory uh let's have a word of prayer for these uh situations here uh i believe that would be it i'm just looking at the list from wednesday about the same okay let's have a word of prayer here together let's agree together heavenly father we just come in the mighty name of jesus lord god which we know uh makes mountains fall lord god makes giants fall lord does great things in miracles lord you are living hope today father god the world has a political hope it's a fading hope it's a false hope they have all they have nothing really to hope in but our hope is alive our hope is eternal life as well thank you lord for this living hope that we have the son of god jesus christ and lord we just come to worship you today lord asking you to receive our praises here and our now anoint us lord as we preach your word father god and we just pray god that you would be glorified in everything said and done lord we just pray for uh these situations we intercede for our brother amen's work situation lord you know the desire i just pray you make a way lord god for our brother to have the desire of his heart lord jesus move upon the bosses the lord move upon the supervisors let thy will be done lord and we just pray you hear our brother's request lord for brother stephen lord open up a job we pray we're going to keep asking keep believing lord we're looking at the scripture that says you supply every need so lord just do a great work here and supply the need for our brother lord god bless him lord and brother amen for their faithful service to you lord god we pray father for uh the friends of the girls the lord that they come to a saving knowledge of you that they would turn from their wicked ways and have a testimony lord god and the girls would be intercessors lord as as we saw with my cousin adam lord to prove it again to our family lord and to our church lord the importance of standing in the gap lord god grant it jesus as we stand the gap lord god for the souls of the friends lord that lord you might be glorified and magnified lord through saving souls father above all we ask that your will would be done here tonight anoint me anoint your people father as we gather in your mighty name we know there's great blessings for gathering here lord may we consider one another may we encourage one another lord god and may your spirit meet every need we pray in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god um the girls had asked me if we would do like uh the children's teaching i said well let's wait for the blands you know because they it was kind of on his heart to do it you know he's one that kind of spurred that teaching there um so well let's wait till they get back by the grace of the lord and then we'll get back to do that was a lot of fun when that a lot of fun and i shouldn't say fun i guess i should say it was glorious and joyful i guess it was those are real bible words there it's joy i'll tell you it's a joyful thing to see the children have those things written on their hearts i was really blessed i was really blessed so i thank the lord for that uh what a great uh thing to see that by god's grace so i'd like to um preach here tonight like let's finish this book here uh the book of philippians and uh it's been a great great blessing to me i think if i can i'm gonna have to switch over here just give me a minute here uh we'll look to chapter four verse 19. we'll kind of pick up there where we left off how did i do this last week i'm trying to remember how i did this okay i got two different apartment i got two different adapters there and i gotta hook up the one that goes to the computer here so i'm just finding a little bit easier to use the computer um for the uh the powerpoint here so it just kind of keeps me it slows me down you know it keeps me a little organized i can just put one thought on one screen so it just helps me by god's grace i hope it helps you i know about you but i love seeing quotes when cam and simon will come i love seeing the quotes here's something about it i can remember it better if i just see the cloaks so you can switch over acacia and i just got a few slides here i think uh i didn't know which direction to go tonight i was kind of preparing for like the children's study and then i was preparing to maybe preaching on uh the mystery of the bride as a church but i just got a few minutes in there and i just kind of put this together quickly so bear with me if it's not as organized as i'd like okay let's finish it tonight by god's grace so uh we looked at our memory verse now here's what i wrote this morning after i'll preach one more sermon lord willing uh focusing on god choosing some rich wise great men like paul and herod's servants so that's what we'll look at tonight and then there are saints today like uh there's a preacher today named aaron mcgarry from texas uh he's of course he's alive today you know really wonderful actually no he's not well he moved out for texas now he's in arizona he's uh the walker's pastor now out in arizona scott and kristen by god's grace and it's scott's birthday today so if you think of it send him a text i'm going to send him a text it's brother brooks's birthday today too i got to text him later tonight by god's grace so january 31st so but just the point that brother mcgarry is a very smart man he's a lawyer he's way beyond your pastor and most preachers as far as intelligence uh and then we'll get to like brother uh brother dao bill dao who was a millionaire that god saved through brother branham his ministry and then you know helps support brother brahms message and then even supports a message church today you know the church where my wife and i were married where we were baptized you know lima by god's grace so i just want to take that thought let's go to philippians 4 here i just want to get to that thought here it's just a really wonderful testimony here and i got some good history on paul as well just a little bit about paul and his witness in rome so philippians 4 and i want to just gain some encouragement from this that if god can use paul in prison to win souls hopefully god can use us to save a few more souls in akron praise god in this laodicean age in other words what i mean is hopefully god can use us to find a few more uh grains of wheat right that we can glean a few more brother bang praise god we can find a few more grains out there because we know america's been harvested over year after year decade after decade we know she turned it down in 1950 uh but by god's grace you know the combines have gone over america but here we are god wouldn't leave us here to do nothing we have something to do and we must labor till jesus comes in fact jesus i read it this morning in my reading jesus he had compassion he said oh i don't like to see the sheep without a shepherd right he said we need to pray that god will send laborers into the harvest amen praise god and so we got to find that we got to find that we got to find that there's sheep out there and they need a shepherd praise god they need to be fed the word of god that was my prayer that god would feed us again on his unfailing word tonight now verse 19 as we ended there this morning but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus god has provided every person's need down through the age now there's been a few like the i'm sorry not the leper like the beggar lazarus there's been a few that god has given the testimony of you know starving and battling you know not enough food but overall overall the majority of people god has graciously given to everyone and supplied everyone's need on the earth for six thousand years he just provided poured out blessing after blessing he sent rain after rain after rain right snow after snow uh season uh harvest uh i'm sorry planting and then summer then harvest the cycle has and uh uh i'm sorry has gone unending in other words god has faithfully poured out his blessings upon his people and for that he's worthy of our praise yes we've never seen it fail in our life and where i believe we're not going to see it fail again by god's grace i remember in 2008 my my wife will remember this 2008 was the the last crash right the last crash uh the economic thing and and a brother come to lima and preached on that you remember that honey brother joe adams preached on and he was saying how people were so concerned about the economy falling and we would lose all of our money and and he kind of brought the scripture how the bible says it's the laodicean age it's rich and increased with goods and he said it's going to go back up and it has gone up right a lot the uh under trump i mean the administration the wall street reaches highest levels now of course we know the billionaires are getting more more rich right that's not really helping but when uh but with some of them they can promote growth and we know church the antichrist is gonna find some secret the bible said he's gonna be able to make craft prosper right so before the end here before the end time he's got to find a way to increase manufacturing he's going to be a provider right and we saw the pope meet with the trillionaire companies or is that a word train i think it is a billionaire companies i should probably say i think there's only a couple of companies that are in the trillions now but anyways uh in other words we don't have to worry you know there's going to be there may be hard times and we don't know all the details about the future but we know this age is the age rich and increased with goods their main mantra is going to be peace and safety and also craft and prospering right that's going to be their main uh mantra and so god likens this age to an age that's rich and increased with goods but remember we got to remember job job came into this trial right when he was at ease and we've got to make sure church that when as we said this morning as paul said when i'm full we have to be able to be spiritual and yet have blessings amen praise god i'm sure sister beatrice sitting there has seen hard times in ghana right i'm sure there's been a lot of poor right but here look at her now in america and uh you know all of us i was i was raised poor right we were on food stamps my almost my whole life except a few seasons where my dad was able to keep a job and wasn't being made fun of because of his name but uh we have to be able to live in this this age where there's so much available and yet we don't take confidence in that right we have to be able to uh we really have to live by faith and not by sight we have to look beyond the natural things and say i'm not taking comfort in the natural things i'm taking comfort in the one who sends these things amen because paul tells him god is going to supply all our needs praise god how many got enough food out there we got enough food out there everybody got enough uh money to pay your bills nobody's going into debt right no one's anybody filing for bankruptcy this month anybody gonna file for bankruptcy thank god amen thank god he supplied every need now we know some people go through those things because of mis managing money in other words disobeying the word that they already know we know a couple people that been through bankruptcy uh i know we have a couple friends and it's because they purposely uh ran up credit cards on purpose and yet they knew better right and so a christian uh you know god will allow people to suffer sometimes because of their own decisions what awful thing what an awful testimony right for a christian but thank god for his amazing grace amen amen because we all fall short we all make mistakes but paul is uh he's telling the the philippians you've sacrificed for me i'm full he said god is going to supply everything you need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus that ought to remind us where paul where jesus said don't worry about what you're going to eat don't worry about what you're going to wear but seek first be worried be concerned not worry but be concerned about the kingdom of god amen and the righteousness you living the righteousness of jesus christ and he said all these things will be added unto you praise god what a confirmation what a consolation that paul gives us here and if we continue i love that thought from this morning if we continue to make constant sacrifices to the lord constantly praising him thanking him praying and then giving if we constantly plant those seeds god is going to bring forth the fruits of righteousness in our lives and that's what i found in my life i know i say it often but i found going from very little income to a more comfortable income i found the more i give the more god gives me that's true i i i'm not not boasting on me or anything i'm boasting on god amen the more god gives me even children the more the more we give to him the more he blesses us amen and of course god is free to take it all away because our he has a testimony he has a he has a work he's trying to do in our lives we have to be we have to know him in the power of the resurrection but also in the fellowship of his sufferings amen and so the real faith of god uh anchors in your heart and so you learn we're learning contentment right we're learning contentment whether we're full or whether we're not so full because i don't think anybody here has been empty right has anybody here been empty and you have no money ever and you you know you don't put any you don't put any gas in your car you have no money for gas in your car has anybody been that low before i hope no hands come up because i feel bad because i want to know if you do because i can help you out by god's grace we want to help you out i can call church i can call pastors i can call pastors in five minutes and i can have money on the way in a couple of days to help you out that's how much people love you that's how much people love us as christians i know i i've talked to them before about it i could call them we could have whatever you know we could meet your need and that's because jesus said if you forsake your worldly family that doesn't believe in me he said i'll give you a hundred fold in this life amen and also in the life to come praise god the thing is i've never really asked people for money so i thank god for that i hope i don't have to brother bang that's my prayer that god will allow us to be so uh in tune with his holy spirit and we'll just keep investing seeds that god will keep sending it and i won't have to ask for money i made that a rule of my life i'll never ask anybody for money i don't think i have yet once by god's grace other than god i got to ask him of course but i can't think of one time i did ask somebody for money and i don't want to because i know god is going to supply all my needs praise god and that's the great word there need god promises to supply our needs amen now let's go to verse that was verse 19. i'm going to go to verse 20. uh i don't have a verse i don't have a i don't have a slide for 20. so let me just read 20. these are just very simple things now unto the god and our father be uh glory forever amen so it's interesting he gives a amen and then he gives a salute after this amen usually means so be it that's the end did you notice too earlier this is just interesting paul said uh finally he said finally like a few times in the scripture oh yeah he said finally in chapter three yeah three verse one he said finally my brethren rejoice in the lord and then he says uh finally in chapter four verse eight so if i say i'm gonna close two or three times i got a scripture for it okay because he said finally in chapter three and then he says finally in chapter four and then he says amen in verse 20 and then he says amen in verse 23. so i got scripture now not that i want to get that reputation is that something paul says finally he he brings these thoughts and he just said then finally again and then he says amen and then he says it again i'm not trying to make a doctrine of that i'm just saying it's interesting that that a man can say that think he's going to close and then he gets a little more by god's grace so i just feel like i'll just say like this the more we pull on god the more he gives out amen let me say like this some people might have been done with the service and i might have said i'm going to close but then people might start pulling because they're more hungry for more of god amen so i have to go a little longer by god's grace amen and i'm glad i've done it many times i'm glad because like amen and who are like when you guys received the holy ghost wasn't it after people went out so it's like we said amen but it wasn't praise god there's some more praise god hallelujah thank the lord amen i'm not making a doctrine that i'm just saying it's just interesting god and our father be glory forever and forever and ever amen so all this boils down to all the wisdom paul pours out he boils it down to we're giving god and our father glory forever and ever amen now verse 21 salute all every saint in christ jesus the brethren which are with me greet you how would they have done that they would just would have read the letter right and we said paul sends his greetings we salute you we encourage you now let me look up that word salute here let me i never looked that one up actually okay just to embrace to salute to bid welcome to wish well to okay i don't know if there's some spiritual meaning behind it of course they had holy kisses to greet one another with a holy kiss you see that there uh respect okay just recognizing them okay so i thought maybe it was something more than that he says greet them recognize them in verse 21 slew every saint uh now verse 22 is where we're going to get to i want to spend a few minutes on this by god's grace he said all the saints salute you now paul's in rome he's in a prison in rome at least according to uh these commentators that i was reading today all the saints in rome now he's in a prison right but he's got helpers epiphanists go back and forth ever first they go back and forth philippi and rome and then he's got other saints there as well that are with him there in rome all the saints salute you chiefly that are of caesar's household okay so now we get this idea caesar right caesar who's caesar this is an interesting thought now i hope that's not too small but i'm going to read this here nero was at this time emperor of rome he was actually the one of the worst most bloodiest emperors of all nero a more worthless cruel and diabolic wretch never disgrace the name or form of man so you thought hitler was bad maybe this guy was the precursor to hitler this is what the uh the historian adam clark a preacher in the 1800s this is what he says there was never a more wicked man because remember he did the 10 years nero did the 10 years of bitter persecution where they killed everything that was even close christian jew out of rome it was uh jesus said that was the 10 days remember in the church ages he said that's the 10 days you got to overcome you'll have troubles 10 days but i love how jesus gave him a warning praise god they knew it was coming amen hallelujah i like how the holy spirit gives you uh a warning of what's coming to prepare your faith because then he said be faithful not until death you don't give up at death he said you're faithful unto death praise god in other words you accept your role as a martyr if god's called me to die then i'll lay my life down for the cause of christ because if jesus did it i can do it praise god there was never a more wretched man than nero so there's christians in the did i read that right of nero's household hallelujah he says yet his fam yeah it is family there were christians but whether this relates to the members of the imperial family or to the guards or courtiers or the servants we cannot tell so no one really knows but there's people close to the the uh the caesar that's the word i want to say caesar i was thinking herod that's the next scripture we'll get to there's people close to the caesar the most powerful man in earth i wonder if there's any saints up in the white house anymore i don't know that's going to be a tough one there was a they at least had bible studies under the past administration now and they talk you know they talk some things i got i have articles on that they thought some things that are pretty close to the message like men are supposed to rule the church and rule uh their homes and everything like that i got i got articles on that he said but even if some of his slaves were converted to christianity it would be sufficiently marvelous oh think about that church the most wicked man of all but let's say it's some of his servants some of his servants are walking around doing his bidding and maybe it's a secret maybe they had to keep it a secret but can you imagine there's the presence of god there amen there and that person represents god's mercy to that house praise god right because because the bible said god will not leave himself without a witness nero won't get there hitler won't get there and say well nobody told me or nobody no the god placed people there to witness to them to try to bring them the repentance that was a great sign of god's love he said salute those chiefly specifically those of uh caesar's house specifically those of nero's house make sure you salute them praise god amen he said converse to christianity in this family there certainly were and this shows how powerfully ah hallelujah the divine word had been preached and spread amen even amongst murderers a murderous king even around him god still sent the word so close to him to give him a chance to be able to witness that there was christians in in the midst praise god they must have kept it a secret right because he was he went on the rampage or maybe it was before the rampage or after the rampage i'm not quite sure i didn't get that far in the study of history but that's like what this says now look at this is beautiful that the empress papaya i'm not sure papaya i'm not sure if i'm saying that right this is nero's second wife may have been favorably inclined to christianity is possible for josephus he was a historian he was the one he even he was a jewish historian and he wrote about jesus he he said he said uh all the jew or there was jews that followed a man named jesus and they ate his flesh and drink his blood they were cannibals so see he would he was a witness that jesus was a real person and josephus was even there a historian when an uh uh titus came and destroyed jerusalem in 87 he was a witness to that he's the one that wrote that blood flew out of the temple like a river it was so awful he was a witness to those things remember he was also the man that said five years before titus came every christian was out of jerusalem praise god because they took heed to jesus's warning amen and jesus said when you see them come go to the mountains amen run when you see those armies come in run and pray that your flight be not in winter praise god so even joseph and josephus relates of papaya papaya that's a strange name she was a worshiper of the true god it's not likely therefore that she threw any hindrances in the way of her servants who might wish to embrace the christian faith so it's likely herod's i'm sorry nero's second wife knew there were saints there just didn't tell hubby right of course a lot of those marriages were arranged based upon status right many times there was status so some so somehow a second wife got saved according to josephus and she would protect those that were christians church it's been happening all down through the age remember when athaliah uh jezebel's daughter came into power what'd they do they hid the next king he was a little baby they hit him for seven years and then when he's seven they brought him out and condom is king and believers are always hiding away when there's times they gotta hide away there's times they fight against it there are times they give their lives but there's other times they hide away for another time in season ordained to the lord praise god so wouldn't stumble me if somebody had to be hidden away praise god look what he says here saint jerome and philemon states that saint paul had converted many now look at this jerome a saint not actually don't know his history but interesting he says paul converted many in caesar's family which would make sense why he said uh all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar's household these converts i got here uh they're they're closely connected to the white house can i just say it like that they're closely connected to the white house he said and they want to send their greetings to you praise god now they're new believers and they'd love to meet you they'd love to fellowship with you praise god in other words be encouraged although there's a murderer in the white house and that's about what we got now did you see the abortion i mentioned this morning that uh they're sending more money so more countries can do abortion church it's got to fulfill that all nations will worship the the beast right so he's got to send him money so so that they can fulfill their evil desires to for death and destruction it's got to happen you know it actually works both ways right church the deep calls to the deep it actually works both ways if you've got a deep calling for righteousness god's going to make sure you get it praise god but if you've got a desire for evil god will allow you to have that too because he gave us free more agency and he can't force us to do these things so either way thank god whatever longing you have in your heart it's going to come to you and if you long to go to heaven if you long to worship jesus if you long to worship at his feet if you long to live with him eternally there's got to be a deep to respond amen and that's why you're here tonight praise god hallelujah so he tells them i want to let you know these people in the white house there's some believers up there by god's grace that's kind of what he's saying right they really want to send their salute to you praise god now remember chapter one paul said i've seen that my arrest has gone for the furthest of the gospel praise god right he said because now prisoners are not prisoners yeah prisoners and and guards have heard the gospel because i've been in a roman jail and i know people i've converted some of the president's own people oh my what a saint praise god in prison yet converting i wonder how he baptized them i wonder if they had like bathtubs in the prisons or something like that or horse troughs like they got today right people will get the horse trough and oh we were gonna do that with an uh uh picture right we're gonna one time we got i went and got that that thing's that one thing was actually wasn't too heavy it's actually kind of light that's how they got to do it a lot of churches do that any method to do it there's something in the christian i've just got to keep the word of god amen jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen he said listen there's these people at the white house they want to send their greetings they got converted under my ministry ah thank the lord amen thank god for his amazing grace now look at this adam clark ends it by saying being by the emperor cast into prison paul became the more known to the emperor's family oh my goodness and he turned the house of christ's persecutor into a church amen praise god i don't know if this is before or after nero did those 10 years but history says god sent him in there to the house of the murderer and converted part of it and it became a church praise god amen hallelujah so see church let's not just give up let's not give up let's remember that all things work together for good to them that love the lord amen amen coven's going to work together somehow cope is going to work together to give god glory amen it looks like they're being shut out it looks like that but let's see what happens praise god maybe god will have to use the uh the internet more as we obviously know he may have to use that more or may he may open it up soon uh you know the the flights are soon again i've seen things about if you got a vaccine you'll be able to fly and uh or if you wear a mask you'll certainly be able to fly mercy goodness gracious you know i'm the one if anyone needs a mask it's me because all this spitfire out of my mouth you know that's about it but not really on a plane interesting it's amazing that in the house in the house of death god and jesus send life into the house of death praise god because god is he's a god rich in mercy praise god not all those around the president of that day were murderers so god sent the word not only the word a prophet the word prophet praise god into the into we'd say the white house of that day amazing i know about you church but i like to sing that song amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me praise god now just want to look at this here this reminded me of a message i preached long ago about herod this was even before i was a pastor i preached a message called the leaven of herod heaven i'm sorry herod's leaven was uh lust of the flesh then you might have remembered when i preached out lima you might i don't know if you remember that's a long time ago uh but i preached a message called the levin of herod and i never it was just amazing message the thought that the holy spirit gave me it was amazing to me but uh herod was known remember herod had a second wife right herodias uh he liked to watch his stepdaughter dance seductively but yeah and all that the bible said he actually obeyed john the baptist a little bit remember in other words can i say like this he respected brother branham but he liked his worldly dressed women and dancing and sexuality you guys say like that married twice we got a lot of that around the message too married twice and three times four times many times that's a sign of people's uh state with the lord now of course don't get me wrong church god can forgive all that praise god if god can forgive david as a doctor who did it on purpose right as we saw this morning talk about a need for a guilt offering or a trespass offering all right boy if anybody needed a ram it was david right amen they come out of his loins praise god amen hallelujah of the sea of david it came out if anybody needed a ram it was david so it proves god can forgive adultery they can be saved i don't know if they can be raptured program tries to give them some hope maybe but they certainly can be saved if they confess their sins but herod was a man who loved licentiousness i think the actual word is in the king james licentiousness which just means passions and lust of the flesh but i i i saw the same thing in jesus's ministry there were certain women healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils i wonder how many devils went out of me i just wonder about that all my addictions i wonder how many went out of me praise god amen at least one at least one and joanna let's look at this joanna the wife of chuza herod's steward herod herod the great herod right herod the great the time of jesus and susannah and many others which ministered unto him of their substance so so a wife a wife of chooser who worked for the president i'll say like that or one of the great mayors or governor we might say some great man the wife of a great man left him and what left her husband there so he could keep working for the for herod and then started following jesus in other words there were only one person away from we'd say the governor's mansion right or the white house they're only one family away and so see we we see again how god he has witnesses everywhere his word is going to get to every corner every uh nook and cranny of the earth praise god we can see how god is going to make sure this message gets to every nation amen amen it's so it's such a small world oh yeah in fact i went to the doctor this week uh my physical therapist because i got a i got a hip flexor injury and just to say what a small world it was i said how are you doing sir his name's greg he's like where are you from and we start talking he's like you know what i'm from a nearby town than that i said really uh he's right uh he said he's uh what three years younger than me or three years older than me and he played football or like like we're just so connected and then he was that he went to ohio state and he was there when i played football at ohio state he was at that game literally at that game and i said man where i said it's just such a small world praise god so i got i got some meetings with him i'm hoping to take my book on uh tuesday i'm going to try to give my book to him and see if he wants it he's got four daughters so i'm just going to pray for him i thought my what a small world we both played football at the same time we both were like state champions and then we were both there at ohio state together and now we're we're both living in this area and we both meet together we have so much in common it was uh just interesting that god is going to find a way to get his word to all those who want to hear it praise god and he's also going to take it to those that don't want to hear it because they have to have a witness against them but here we see herod stewart now joanna's husband was probably the landscaper for herod now this is what the history says like joseph joseph and potiphar's house so you know her husband chuseo probably wasn't a great man like we'd say like a president or vice president but uh this is what i believe this is uh albert barnes he was another 1800s preacher herod antipas who reigned in galilee he was a son of hair of the great that's the one who killed all the babies about the time of jesus birth the word steward means one who has to charge of the domestic affairs of a family to provide for it the office was generally held by a slave who was esteemed the most faithful and was often conferred as a reward of fidelity okay so likely uh chuza was just a slave but he was a real faithful brother i don't know if he was a christian but his wife was a christian at least she loved jesus and so jesus think of this god in flesh the word made flesh the god of heaven praise god was on earth and one of herod's servant's wife followed the god of heaven all she had to do was tell her husband and then the husband he just had to maybe pass by the the herod at some time and tell him my wife's following god yeah i mean just think how close this was together he was making himself known he was making himself known to the humble thank god for us because there's nobody great here tonight right no great millionaire or billionaire here or entrepreneur here tonight right there's no elon musk or uh jeff bezos or anybody major that's major here we're just common people but that's the way we like it praise god amen now what's interesting church is that i shared this a few years ago um the god sent me to akron and i was around football players three of whom would be go to super bowls and win super bowls and i've been in contact with them and trying to you know over the years i've been in contact not recently but some of them wanted to talk to me and i've i've tried to set up things but then they don't get back to me they actually stopped texting me so i was i was doing my part brother bang these they got super bowl rings and they're millionaires and every and i did my part to try to reach out to them but they don't want to talk to me about it but look at that here's the here's the message of the hour that's going to judge them right i mean it's going to judge us we want to be judged righteous praise god hear the word of the hour sent to millionaires and they're just a step away from owners and billionaires and and think how close people are to the word of god if they're just hungry if they're just thirsty jesus said if you just hunger and thirst i'll fill you think about that all's it took and and i even went to church with one of the brothers he was a he won two super bowls i went to church with that guy we went to church together really nice guy uh but then i was asking about some things they stopped texting me back but that's okay i thought man it just it's striking think think how close and i told him about the message they knew i believe william branham was a prophet they knew that and look how close they were so look church what i'm trying to say is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's revealing himself to the humble but he's also given the great of this world a chance to hear it as well and i rejoice in that praise god don't you i rejoice in that praise god that he's so merciful he even gives the great of this world a chance to receive it so this was only two we'd say two relationships away choose his wife chuza and then herod who worked you know jesus who worked for the great one of the greatest man on earth right there it was so close god's word was so close and this just wasn't a prophet this just wasn't brother ram this was god amen god and he's never leaving himself without a witness praise god i love god's word now look at this this is this came to me as i was studying for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called now naturally right there's not many natural mighty men wise men noble men there's not many that are called we know brother and was sent to some kings right i went through the list i saw that list of all the mighty men he was sent to but not many are called why because god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound them in other words they can't humble themselves to accept the simple truth of god's word oh you mean women never have to cut their hair oh you mean god sent a prophet today really but god has chosen the weak things of the world amen that's you and i praise god amen to confound the things which are mighty praise god they can't in other words they can't figure us out can i just say like that let me just use my situation the super bowl guys can't figure us out for my situation that's the closest i've been in contact with they saw me they saw me wear i wore my sweatpants when they wore their shorts i kept my shirt on when they took their shirts off praise god that's a witness brother bang because it was hot we were sweating it up but it's a witness he shows something weak something humble to confound them that are wise i love it because remember jesus said jesus didn't he wasn't sad about this the bible i don't have the scripture but jesus said i rejoice that you've hid these things from the wise and prudent and reveal them unto babes such as would learn praise god it made jesus happy to think that the world will turn it down but i'll give it to somebody who really cares somebody that's able to humble themselves i'll give it to somebody that knows me and loves me that's you and i there's not many the bible said there's not a lot of smart people like i showed you there's aaron mcgarry he's a real smart guy he's a lawyer he can he can he can understand the law he can try to pardon people that have been falsely accused he can make arguments before a judge can imagine i like to watch him sometime i wonder if he's live on tv or something like that they got court tv or something i'm sure they got that i like to watch him argue his case before a judge you know like it's kind of like rightly dividing the word isn't it like we did with our debate and just like any service you have to rightly divide you have to show this is right this is wrong this is mistly applied there right this is it's not applied correctly this law wasn't applied and i'd like to watch that but you have many wise men bibles and not many wise men after the flesh are called to be christians so that's why i don't feel bad i'm not the smartest guy you know if i can't understand something i don't feel bad because the bible says not many of the wise are called i just i want but i do want to get smarter i want to do the best i can right i want to i want to grow in grace with the knowledge of the lord right i want to grow in that but it's a spiritual growth more than a natural growth more than natural understanding so in other words you're not going to see me get on an app to try to be smarter although i was doing that for a while for editing the book but i stopped doing that a while ago i'm not going to try to be smarter and try to understand all those things although you might need it for your job but what i want to understand is how can i take up my cross daily and follow jesus better amen that's what i want to know praise god and how can i abound in utterance brother bang how can i abound for the amen in in faith how can i abound in that that's what i want to understand praise god like we looked at last week i want to abound you want to uh you want to overflow in these things abound in giving abound in wisdom right abound in uh faith and utterance and all these blessings we want to abound in the things of god how many want to bound by god's grace amen but see not so much the wise things the wise things of the world but remember the bible said this we're not wise in the natural but spiritually we are wise and we're not noble of let's say donald trump's bloodline or joe biden's bloodline or the clinton bloodline we're not noble that way but the bible says we're spiritually noble if we search the word every day praise god amen right i'm i'm by the blood of jesus i'm connected to the most royal family there ever was amen because we search the scripture daily we want to grow in grace and knowledge of the lord i'm sitting amongst noble nobility here tonight i shall i'm standing but here we are we're amongst kings and priests unto god oh my just picture your bang's crown you know just picture the crown that you got we're sitting amongst royalty tonight by god's grace isn't that wonderful hallelujah paul said i know there's a crown waiting for me and not to me only but all those that love is appearing there's a crown for you church there's a crown if you overcome by god's grace you got to overcome you got to fight the battle and jesus places a crowd on you oh my everybody wants to cry on them right everyone everyone wants something that looks like they're ruling and look like they got authority well that's the thing to do is get authority now use the authority of god's word now praise god if you take god's authority now he'll make you a ruler over much praise god amen i never started my timer so i'm not even sure where i'm at on time what do we start for okay so i was probably preaching about 4 30. okay all right here let me set timer now give me about 15 more minutes here all right now not many smart men are called and the examples that came to my mind was moses was a smart man that was called but then he had to get it all beaten out of him by a bunch of sheep and an argumentative wife now he was argumentative remember he became meeker as it went on he wasn't always meek and his wife wasn't always saving his life like she did save his life with the circumcision with gershom but she wasn't always that sweet but a lot of arguments on the back side of the desert [Laughter] he left all the pleasures of egypt he was so smart but god had to beat it out of him trial after trial argument after argument until finally he could get to the place where he looks since he's a burning bush that's not consumed i'm gonna go check that out and then brother brahm said he learned more about god in five minutes of that fire than all that he heard the rest of his life amen i hear you five minutes is greater than 80 years amen once you stand in the presence of jesus christ the king of glory amen hallelujah shows you how wise you are the man said he he you know in his human thinking of egypt he said i'm going to go take some of those branches and i'm going to go test him in the laboratory in egypt that's why that's what his human mind would have thought but god had to beat them out of there so he'd go and look upon it and then when it spoke to him he didn't run away he spoke back to it and took instructions he took off his shoes and said this is holy ground yeah there's a few of that are wise in this world but god has to humble them god has to make them fall on their face in order to look up to heaven and like paul he said i just wasn't i just wasn't in i just wasn't in the denomination he said i was the presbyter of presbyters i was the pharisee of pharisees you could say like this he was president of the baptist council right or the what do they call it the baptist convention what do they call it yeah the southern southern baptist convinced a popular convention you know for evangelicals he wasn't just in the convention brother bang he was the president of it praise god amen and god knocked him off his literal praise god in order to humble him and blinded his eye took away all of it and then later on he had to keep losing his eyesight right off and on again you get the victory for a while then they would lose it victory again loses sight wow what a trial what a trial paul why can't you just get the victory how come jesus don't heal you well it's to keep me humble praise god could we accept that lord you don't heal me all the way keep me humble i wonder if we could accept that you sure you love jesus paul yes i asked him three times that's how i know praise god i've been praying over and over about it and he finally told me he said take my grace it'll be sufficient when your eyesight is loot when you're losing your eyesight in other words when you can't read those scrolls when you can't depend upon your ability to study he said depend on me and that's why i said later he said i can do all things through christ who strengthens me praise god i can be strong in christ because it's christ giving me his strength amen amen not many wise men but there were a few that could forsake the cares of the world and receive the humble message of god thank god there's a couple like that i was looking online and before i come out i was like i just typed in uh christians famous christians who converted to christianity and they put some up there i'm like well they're really not christians oh catholics and all these things well i mean they could be saved right but these aren't holy ghost-filled christians like we're talking about people that go to they star in movies right where they lust and kill and sleep with other people oh yeah they're a christian no they're not if so they're totally backslidden they're just they may they may they might scrape into heaven they might just barely get into heaven but there'll be no reward the bible says only rewarded with eternal life based upon repentance so i try to look at for a recent and it's hard to know anybody recent because most people are very sincere right but i want to just bring up a few uh i remember the children will remember this this is a slideshow i did a few years ago many scientists believed in god so some of the wisest and respected people of all time now the bible said not many but there's a few there's a few smart people remember this galileo he was the mathematics is the alphabet which god has written the universe father of astronomy so the man who had all these revelations about astronomy he was a believer praise god he believed in god so look at this there's people that can be smart but yet be humble at the same time god help us just to be humble praise god most of us aren't doctors right most of us aren't rocket scientists unless you got a new job at nasa lately and you didn't tell me right but you might have but these we would say were the rocket scientists of their day can i say like that there's some not many there's some that could accept the humble gospel of christ kepler was the father of planetary motion he said thank thee my creator look at that he realized he was cr he had a creator and lord that thou has given me this joy thy creation this thrill in the works of thy hand amen i've made known thy glory to men as far as my limited spirit can grasp thy divinity praise god oh let it be our testimony that we show somebody god's glory even if it's just like it's testifying about your dad brother that can be your your your your uh lot in life to share god's glory you too sister sorry i i always forget i got to do both you know that's you that's your life you can for the rest of your days brother bang your sister who you can say that he was at the at the very edge of death and we prayed and we anointed the cloth and we prayed and we believed amen and god raised him back a hundred percent praise god i wonder if he's better now than he was though before he had that stroke i wonder if he's sharper or works harder i wonder i don't know you'd have to we have to talk about afterwards he might have got better health afterwards who knows but see he saw it oh oh i'm working with planets i'm a scientist i see my role as a doctor or a scientist rather to make god's glory known so that's what we see i'm a teacher to make god's glory known praise god we're workers in the factory right wherever we are we're there to make god's glory known just got to tell people about god's glory may god anoint you and god anoint me to tell somebody about god's glory tomorrow praise god that's what we're here for isaac newton he's probably one of the most famous uh father of modern physics explains the motions of the planets but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion god governs all things and knows that this is or can be done he's the one i think that talked about gravity right isaac newton i could be wrong on that one my wife's not in so hopefully i can hopefully i'm right uh okay so yeah i went further on these guys um i'm gonna skip past that uh aristotle yeah that's right he believed in god legendary scientist they still study his teachings i read well i shouldn't say read the whole thing i heard a little bit of the book of aristotle in college humanities i don't know if you did him yet did you did you guys do humanities uh i didn't like reading all those books too much but uh he said the reason god gave man intelligence was to understand himself in the universe newton uh he studied uh light uh gravitation calculus i never studied calculus so he's way smarter than i'll ever be oh yeah they spent the last years of his life church remember that that's right i forgot about that so he god helped him discover gravity but then he spent the last years studying the prophecies and he wrote all these commentaries and that encouraged me because i'm kind of like writing a commentary right now of brother branham's taking me through about two and a half years here about brother bran's mysteries and i feel like when is this thing going to end but i'm encouraged after reading this because after he studied all these science things he's like i want to give the last years of my life to writing about god amen i want to understand god's word i want to be able to share with others the revelations that god has given me praise god that's encouraging to me praise god he need a haircut though he probably need a haircut right now this guy i don't know if you remember this guy he was a famous uh atheist philosopher for years he fought god almost his whole life and then six years before he died his heart changed and he publicly stated he believed in god due to the complexity of human dna in 2006 he joined other scientists who urged tony blair to introduce intelligent design i like what the bible said not many not many that are wise after the flesh are called but there are some praise god just want to encourage you right god saves whoever wants to be saved praise god and and that's i love it the more you study god the more you get the details the more you see that god is interested in every detail and not just a dna i'm talking about the details of our lives amen the reason you're here tonight right there's got to be a reason every detail god's handiwork is in every detail of our lives amen hallelujah he's in the details of dna the very tiniest some of the tiniest living things right atoms and molecules electrons if he's in those very details he's got to be in the details of our lives and that should make us what content that should make us happy that should give us peace that god is with us now this is what i mentioned earlier so there's bill dao there's the man brother branham baptized when he was 90 years old 90. he didn't believe the message until he was 90. so don't give up church don't give up you got older parents my mom and dad are 70. oh man may god grant it i hope god does grant it 90 didn't even believe in the prophet until he's 90 years old brother and baptized him numerous times he almost died brother you know the stories with the third pole uh he was dying remember they had him in a tent he was dying and brother graham said thus saith the lord you're not gonna die you're gonna live he said and i'll shake your hand on the street praise god remember that one listen i look away to jesus 1963 it's in that testimony and he said they all thought he was going to die i think it was 93 by that time and they all thought he was going to die but all of a sudden he miraculously got better after brother brown went in that tent and prayed for him and then he uh he was on the bus the brother man was uh brother man was walking on the street and all of a sudden the bus pulled up stopped off got billed down built out and they shook hands and rejoiced says see i told you it was the saint of the lord amen i like that praise god and god sent brother branham a millionaire because brother branham was going to get attacked by the government and he's going to owe 40 000 to the irs so god brought this man with millions of dollars to pay the forty thousand dollar fine for him praise god amen amen praise the lord that's my god brother man now oh my god shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory praise god the man was so happy he said he got the phone he said honey he said write it down i'm pardoned amen and he went down to the church and preached power today see no matter what satan puts against you god's fighting for you amen hallelujah so just so happens if you got a money trouble you let me know i got friends in in good places or at least a couple by god's grace a couple maybe two or three they'd help you out like this that's not to make us you know focus on the flesh but i'm just saying god has every event of our lives ordained amen and god is going to provide the needs and i love this god sends him a millionaire to take care of it and you know and we know now the church i was baptized church i was married at the church where i wear my lovely wife it's there because of him his money is still paying for it today because they keep investing it over and over so he was brother tom brown's father-in-law you remember brother tom brown yeah so he passed away a few years ago his wife's still alive they went to brother ramsey's meetings that's sister marilyn brown's dad brother i found that i was like wow i didn't know that she's still alive what's that yeah i didn't know until today i read that i'm like what marilyn brown's dad was a millionaire but that church still and that school they have a school there the school still is is funded because of the investments of his millions of dollars still today see god knows how to take care of his children praise god god knows how to do it a different testimony different story for each one but god is in control amen see god's got witnesses everywhere the base things of the world the things which are despised hath god chosen yea the things which are not to bring to naught things that are god uses things that don't seem like nothing and he brings him to light and makes them happen praise god that no flesh should glory in his presence like i said on wednesday i don't know if i'd you you guys heard it on wednesday but there's a there's a preacher he's not in the message but he went through all of 2020 and brought all the false prophecies of all the of all the charismatic preachers and showed how they all missed it i believe god might have raised up biden just to show all these christians that these are false preachers so when 2020 came you know every year they make a prediction oh 2020 is going to be prosperous and all it's going to be great and great revivals they said the stadiums are going to be full that's what the lord shows me and then three months later the stadiums are empty and they're still empty right and then when coveted came all those guys they cursed covered in the name of the lord saying it's got to go now and the vaccine's going to be here immediately and they missed that too and then came the election brother everybody amen and they all said 100 trump was going to be in office for two consecutive terms and god made him miss because they're pretending to speak for god when they're not speaking for god right it's amazing i just watched i listened to the video yesterday when i was washing dishes he just put it all together in one thing i wanted to show it to you guys but i just didn't have time today to prepare so why does he do this that no flesh will glory in his presence he choses the weak despised oh that makes me happy praise god that means me weak despise things of the world to bring the knot things that are i was going to say something there but i better not because i don't got people listening here maybe i'll say it after we stop the livestream he said we hobby we speak the wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor are the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory like just let me give an example wednesday night remember we're preaching on husbands and wives i'm preaching the mysteries of god brother vayne that a man needs to love his wife and sacrifice i'm preaching the mysteries of god that these worldly people can't fix they can't figure it out like these wise people they're never going to really love their wives like christ love the church but i can preach it here and i've got the holy spirit here and i got the wisdom of the holy spirit and we're speaking mysteries here and it seems so simple to us but to them i can never do that you've got to treat your wife like that oh brother jesse you don't have to do that for your wife oh no you do because that's the mystery of the revelation amen praise god all those women they don't you don't have to listen to your husband and these things but the bible says she says submit in all things right all things that are godly but do you think those why smart billionaire billionaires will say that no in fact those women will divorce their billionaire husbands on purpose just to get half their money and go find another one they did it i use i'm not gonna name names but they do it but see we speak here in mystery and it's so simple to us we understand it but to them they don't understand it they just can you they just they scratch their heads brother man the name of the fathers and holy ghost is father and only ghost that's a name that's not a name that's a title like that they can't get it they can't get it that all those are titles to one name the lord jesus christ they can't get it of course we know this none of the princes of this world knew for they had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory even the mystery of the resurrection the death and resurrection of jesus christ they missed that now of course almost everybody missed that right but i just want to say that church when we preach on the mystery the rapture there's 12 mysteries right we preach on the map the rapture the mystery of his will the even mother harlot they can't they can't understand it because they're too smart for it they can't humble themselves enough down to receive it and accept the truth but you who are weak in their eyes but you who are despised in their eyes but not god's eyes you receive it and it becomes the wisdom of god unto you and you and i speak it as the mystery of god amongst one another how privileged are we church how privileged are we that we get to speak the mysteries of god it's the greatest privilege of my life to speak the mysteries of god in wisdom now i'm going to close here that was my last slide so i'm just going to detach here because i have just a few notes i don't have these organized so i don't want you to see them they're not really organized he said all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar's household the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen amen what does he end with grace what are the highlights of this book just remember the summary i'm just going to quickly go with this real quick finally i'm going to go through this finally finally so remember paul's prayer from the beginning he prays for he said i'm always thankful for you i'm confident for you and then he talks about his imprisonment how his imprisonment spread the gospel and he won souls because he went to prison praise god church whatever situation we go through we can trust god he's going to do his his will and his glory he's going to use us praise god to win souls that's what i'm living for praise god then he says follow my example remember this is the book of the mind you mentioned in the mind how many times remember ten times unity of mind think the same thing think on these things things that are holy things that are pure think on these things in chapter two he gives jesus is the example servant how can we come to unity how can we serve each other by esteeming ourself lower than others by humbling ourselves as jesus humbled himself to the cross then he talks about timothy and epiphanitis how they humble themselves they were servants to paul they were certain can you imagine being a servant to a prisoner think about that anybody had any family member in jail you really become their servant right if you're helping them out that's what timothy and ephraphaditis became they became servants to the prisoner and paul says these are examples of christian character let's not see how great we can be let's see how humble we can be praise the lord in chapter three he goes through those examples he uses his example and has some of the most beautiful verses in the scripture are in this book for me to live as christ to die is my gain amen in chapter four he ends with some of the most beautiful words i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
