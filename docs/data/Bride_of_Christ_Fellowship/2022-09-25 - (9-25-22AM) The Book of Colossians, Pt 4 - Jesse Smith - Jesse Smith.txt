========================================

stained your life praise God he's got it all in control he's keeping you here hallelujah he kept you before you came praise God he's going to keep you while you're here and he's going to keep you after you leave here hallelujah Christ is keeping us amen Colossians 1 verse 15. we ended at 17 on that Wednesday night as a memorable night for me at least and uh we'll read 15 down to 18. let me read 15 to 17 then we'll read 18. 15. oh yeah I'm very sorry I normally shut off the Wi-Fi Colossians 1 verse 15. I'll read that and we'll read 18. who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created so that means Jesus Christ created you and George how many believe he made you a vessel of Honor not a vessel of Dishonor he formed you to be a vessel of Honor Ed because you're honoring him today that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things for our sustained my life is sustained today because of Christ Jesus my Lord let's all read Verse 18 one two three and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence let's have one more word of prayer we're just going to look at the grace of God here today so Heavenly Father we love you we thank you God lord your Holy Spirit 2000 years ago penned this scripture on paper in a prison cell Lord God and you knew Lord this this this writing these words would be needful for us in this day two thousand years later so God May the same God hallelujah who wrote these words two thousand years ago but you give us inspiration today Lord we know it can't be the full inspiration but give us partial inspiration Lord God we know Lord we can preach a thousand years on one scripture Lord God Hallelujah give us inspiration for this text the inspiration that we have need of in this hour today I'm in need of you Lord we're all in need of you speak to your humble people thank you for sustaining Our Lives Lord to this point either we came from you Lord God you brought us here and Lord we will go back to you Lord when our journey Lord when our generation is over lord God hallelujah should you tarry so we ask Lord in Jesus Christ's name that your Holy Spirit Lord would speak to us today Lord Moses and shape us as the vessels you created For Your Glory and May glorify you today through this service in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God some scriptures I like to show so I can switch over here whenever you're ready Malachi looking at part four here today by the grace of the Lord sorry you know we've dropped two we've dropped two sermons short in the last month and so I emailed the gentleman who looks at our sound system and he says the problems probably with Spectrum so I need to I need to call them I just had a busy day yesterday so I didn't get to it yesterday and the gentleman Mr Davis thinks that our router is old or something wrong with that our modem I'm not sure with your Tech guy like that but anyways I do apologize about that you know the sermon Wednesday cut off after half an hour I preached an hour after that so I'm very sorry you know if you hear the rest of it with little brother you know we do have the MP3 safe on save it don't work anymore well the holy spirit will be up to you better somehow it was it was one of them we just recently got it you know the the benefits of receiving the Revelation and the consumption system so I do apologize for that I need to reach out to them I just haven't done anything so I'd like to pick up here where we left off this is a scripture we left off you know back in June on a Wednesday night the Bible said Jesus is before all things and by him all things consist we know this is speaking of Jesus's Spirit not his flesh because his spirit is before all things numerous many things were before there was four thousand years of things that came before Jesus's flesh body all right because Jesus came at about after about 4 000 years about 2000 years after Noah so it was Jesus's Spirit which is the Holy Spirit that is before all things and his spirit makes all things continue they stay set in the same place praise God and Jesus sustains Our Lives now looking at this this text here uh it would be Jesus who would choose his choice now to sustain colossi for only 10 more years so we just get a idea there that Jesus will choose to sustain you for as long as he sees fit now again we don't know if these Believers were scattered to different locations we don't know if they died in that earthquake in colossi uh it would have been around 65 A.D or so we don't know exactly what happened to them all we know is that the city is a mound of ruins today and so Jesus chose I'm going to make this city I'm going to sustain it for 10 more years but for 10 years they'll have the revelation of this letter from God's prophet and for 10 years they were to Feast on that can you imagine imagine the inspiration you know the preachers there colossi would have received you know at just 10 years they would have read this letter and then they would have preached as the Holy Spirit inspired them on the things that were said about the godhead about the baptism of the Holy Ghost about about holy living praise God as as Lord willing and we'll eventually get to chapter two and three and four by the grace of the Lord as time goes on but just you know just take that into consideration you know God doesn't uh allow everyone to consist as much as others you know in other words God has churches that will last longer churches that will last shorter some that will uh some of that will have more members less members God is a god of variety and God is a god with a story God has a story for each and every one of our lives like that great example uh I believe was Stephen was stoned it 29 years old martyred at 29 years old but then John would go on to live to 100 years old John would have 70 more years of service than Stephen but God wrote that in Stephen's Plan before the foundation of the world praise God to be the first Holy Ghost filled Christian martyr praise God outside of Christ The Sinner saved by grace and God sustained Stephen to his 29th year and then God just God decided it's best now that I take him and when you come to Heaven Jesus give him a five general salute Hallelujah to recognize that saint of God Amen Hallelujah and he died like a man he died with the face of an Angel praise God Hallelujah but then God allowed John 70 more years of preaching 70 more years of ministry and God was going to sustain him until he was 100 years old praise God so let ought to encourage us Church no matter how many years we get we ought to be thankful that Jesus sustains US during those years he hasn't chose us to be vessels of Dishonor he's chosen us to be vessels of Honor praise God we may have 29 years to honor him we may have a hundred years on him I hope I get 100. that's just my desire whenever the Rapture is I want to be living I hope I live to see the Rapture praise God every believer for 2 000 years has desired that but hasn't had it we may have it we may not have it but we want to live to see it if we do it'll be Christ sustaining us until we get there so let's just be let's just be thankful today for the years that God does give us amen let's choose to be grateful let us choose to give Thanksgiving let us choose to be joyful in the years we are sustained amen that's how I want to live my life praise God that I can be joyful in the years he's kept me standing praise God now here's the verse we the next verse he is the head of the body so this this firstborn of all creation the one who sustains all things he's the head of the body of the church and he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence now of course this first one from the dead means uh that he's the first one who conquered death never to die again praise God he's the first one that conquered death in a glorified body praise God Hallelujah because Lazarus had died before Jesus he'd been brought forth from the dead and it was a great sign of Jesus's power but then he was to die again but then Jesus died afterwards rose again and the Bible calls him the firstborn from the dead Hallelujah in other words he's the first sinless man to die and be raised again Hallelujah Moses had died and been resurrected God took his body but he was a sinful man right but Moses pointed to Jesus Christ amen Lazarus pointed to Jesus Christ amen they're all pointing to the Holy One he's the First Holy One to die and raise again never to die again Hallelujah and become the hero of Heaven praise God Hallelujah to become Heaven's high priest Hallelujah that was not Moses that was not Elijah that was not Enoch they're not Heaven's High priests Mary's not Heaven's High Priestess but Jesus Christ is the firstborn from the dead he conquered death Church death doesn't have to shake us because the firstborn from the dead has conquered death amen that in all things he might have preeminence premise means the head it means the chief so he used to have I'm sorry Apprentice means the first the head is the chief The prominent the supreme leader Christ is the prominent one of the church right remember we know some have higher callings like prophets have higher callings so in one sense they have a higher calling but then the the Bible says Paul says that all preachers are the same we all plant we all water and Paul puts emphasis on Christ who gives the increase amen so we respect like brothers said we give honor to John the Baptist we give honor to the Elijah of our day but we don't worship them praise God because Christ is the head of all but the one who conquered death is the head of all those who had to die praise God Amen so Christ is the chief he's the preeminent one I love this quote I just it just came to me while I was studying this morning so I just I thought I'd share it again God shows a place of worship my friends I don't want to hurt your feelings but I'm responsible for a message and that message is come out of denominations and if I ask you to come out where am I going to take you would I take you to Branham Tabernacle it's just as much as fault as any of the rest of them so here brother Ram is emphasizing the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother I'm saying a church of itself cannot save you how many people have we invited in here but the church itself doesn't save them as much as I want to save them as much as I want them to receive the truth I can't do it the church can't save them so brother is making a point here he's not doing away with Ephesians 4. we know the church will be perfected to the fivefold ministry but he's showing how we that every believer must come to the the Christ that the fifo ministry is preaching about and we can't make Branham Tabernacle we can't make bride of Christ Fellowship or Happy Valley or or Living Waters Tabernacle we can make no church an idol a church is a good place to go but listen church you can meet Jesus outside the church amen and like we look at tonight God wants to walk with you in the cool of the evening praise God that's my sermon for tonight the cool of the evening so I'm going to preach on that for the communion here just a simple message about walking with God uh but programs emphasize this whole sermon where did God choose to place his name he put it in Christ amen like we see with colossi churches rise churches fall churches can be burnt you know that's not the place of worship I mean it's one Gathering where we worship but we can worship at my house remember when the Holy Spirit fell when Sam was there Hallelujah on Labor Day Hallelujah see it's not so much a building it's where the Believers are amen hallelujah thank God God does visit our Sanctuary here thank God he does visit but it's where God's chosen place of worship is where the holy spirit is where you and I are believing and trusting in Christ he said so anyway in other words our church is just as much fault as any other Church he said if I'm going to point you to somewhere where am I going to take you he said but there's one place I can take you where you're safe and protected from Death that's in Jesus Christ God's place of worship and that's the place I'm introducing to you tonight where God put his name where he promised he would meet every person that come in there he would worship with him and feast with him that's in Christ not in no church no Tabernacle but in Christ he is God's Tabernacle amen thank God he's the place that God came into himself and dwelled in him this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell that is where God Tabernacle brought his name and placed it Upon Jesus Christ therefore his name was putting a man his son Jesus Christ in which he tabernacled himself and in that Tabernacle amen so now we can see here uh Christ is the head of the body Christ is the one we always point to yes we want them to come to church if if they love Jesus they will come to church praise God but the church building itself is not the place where we point them we point them to a relationship with Jesus Christ in other words I was waiting I remember I told you about that man who asked me last week I saw him again this week and I said hey have you thought about the Bible and he's like no I've been so busy I said well let me tell you I said let me tell you before I leave here Jesus Christ is the greatest thing that ever happened in my life there's another woman listening to us she looked up and smiled at me I said he saved my soul he forgives every sin he changed me from a sinner to a saint that he just kept his head down like that it was so sad but I'm praying for him praise God I hope I see him again I've seen him twice maybe I'll see him three times uh but but that's the reality that's what I got to point into I got appointment with Jesus Christ praise God he's the one that saved my life he's the one that uh rescued me from my sins praise God he's my head he's my chief he's my leader praise God he's the one that I'm looking to every day praise God he's the head of the church Hallelujah and he's the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence the first place he holds first place in our lives so because he's the beginning because he's the firstborn from the dead because he's all these firsts Hallelujah alpha and omega beginning in the end the first and the last Hallelujah that which was is and is to come because he's all things he must hold first place in our lives and of course he does by the grace of God I love this quote this this scripture always takes me back to this quote this the sermon he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in history he's in things to come the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8 if you're writing it down think God's written in our hearts amen he should be then he should be the Principal if that's what he is and we believe it don't we then if he's that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking so see in every conversation we have we should try to bring it back to Christ he should be the Principal theme of our thinking of our singing of our walks with God he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us how many got the Bible in you then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think should be Christ is that right I love that quote that's just beautiful see preeminence he's the first he holds first place in everything we do the reason I preach is to honor Christ the reason I go to work is to honor Christ Hallelujah the reason I I come here to the church's study is to honor Christ the reason I give money away the reason I I help the poor is to honor Christ the reason you pray and sing is to honor Christ praise God yes it benefits you yes if it refreshes your spirit yes it makes you joyful but the reason I do it is to honor Jesus amen he holds first place in everything verse 19. now I want to bring a little bit of understanding for this one for please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now church I believe what I want to try to emphasize here is God's spirit did not leave heaven when Jesus was on Earth so all the fullness means all the authority okay some people think heaven was bankrupt when Christ was on Earth that's the case then Jesus was deceiving us when he said Our Father Who Art in Heaven right see Heaven could not have been bankrupt the the truth we need to understand is that God cannot be limited amen he's infinite praise God so all God put all of his authority and he put all the all the power of Heaven in one man Jesus Christ we have a measure we have a small portion thank God for a small portion praise God because Jesus said even with a small Faith the size of a mustard seed amen the the Bible said that kind of faith can move mountains Hallelujah so Jesus had more than a Mustard Seed Faith he had all the faith right he had because he was holy praise God and He waited on God to speak anything that's how we should do it as well praise God but this means all the authority of the of God dwelt in Christ everything was subject unto him he said I can get 12 Legions of angels if I want and he did so much they couldn't even write about it in fact this whole world could be filled with books about all the things Jesus did in three and a half years of ministry praise God that's my king amen that's my chief that's my supreme ruler that's my head amen he's the head of me in this church amen Jesus Christ because he had all the fullness of the godhead in his body praise God can you imagine that church we're going to be shocked for ages in heaven well he did this too and that too and this too and I imagine it'll be traced on all the way down to our relatives you know and everything all about hundreds and thousands of years all that Jesus did and will just be in awe will just be praising him and loving him and giving Glory ages Without End praise God oh Hallelujah just more of the same that he always did praise God more of the same because remember his soul was sealed Jesus Soul was sealed according to John 6 27 so he had the seal or the mark of the Holy Spirit and his soul but God's spirit was also in heaven he said let it be done on Earth I'm sorry Our Father Who Art in Heaven Jesus prayed obviously he looked up to heaven when he thanked uh when you thank God uh uh that their names are written in heaven praise God and then he also thank God when Lazarus was going to get healed and raised from the dead he looked up to heaven he looked to God so he had all the all the fullness in him yet God was still up in heaven that's a mystery that's what he said that's what he told in John The Book of John he said he said what if you see the son of man Ascend up where he is right now Hallelujah is that right that's what he told him he said the son of man is now in heaven and he's on Earth as well he's talking about the spirit praise God the spirit of God in him is also in heaven now amen what if you shall see him Ascend up where he was before praise God oh it's that omnipresence gonna say like that I'm the presence of God Glory Colossians 1 verse 20 we're slowly working I love preaching verse five words I just I feel like I get to know the Bible so much more when I preach it uh and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him by Christ to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or in heaven Hallelujah so whether you're in heaven if you die to go beyond or you're on Earth the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ has reconciled you to God Amen Hallelujah we don't have to worry about you know Devils pulling us down to Hell or tormenting or anything like that we don't have to worry about that the blood of Jesus has already reconciled us to God hallelujah amen we know what to expect Hallelujah that's what Jeremiah 29 said Hallelujah I know the plans I have for you I get I come to give you a future praise God that you may have an expected end Hallelujah I know when I close my eyes and death of the Lord's Aries for that final time I know the next thing I'll see is the Holy Angels amen Hallelujah I see Heaven breaking forth because the blood did that for me I couldn't do it I wasn't worthy of it Christ did that for me Christ gave me peace Christ gave me an expected End Amen Hallelujah no man will brag Hallelujah no man will boast no woman will boast praise God but we'll be boasting in the cross amen Glory I'm going to be boasted in Jesus all that he did Hallelujah all they did was surrender it opened my heart to him now see the blood makes peace I love this verse I hope this verse is always my testimony Romans 3 25 I don't have it on the slide I just want to read it so many people say oh we're saved by grace Say by grace through faith that's true but it's faith in the blood and see that's what the devil does in these denominational churches they take out the blood right but we're putting the blood back in amen they take out the blood that means they take out the Holy Spirit we're putting the Holy Spirit back in we're putting the blood back in amen I was never told that in denomination by William they'd always say you're saved by faith you're saved by faith I might well praise God praise God when I read the Bible later I'm saved by faith in the blood praise God hallelujah it's the blood that we're saved by Romans 3 25. well we got to read 24. look at this is So Glorious being justified freely it was free by the amen free gift he declared you righteous freely you didn't pay for it you didn't buy it it was given to you ah by what his grace freely given by unmerited favor God did you a favor anybody ever did you a favor you're like I really appreciate that oh that was thank you I didn't earn it I don't I didn't earn it I don't deserve it the precious love of God that sounds kind of a man right now oh it's a it's a it's an unmerited favor it was right on time I really needed that that was such a blessing I didn't deserve it I didn't ask you for it but you did it and that's what God did for us he gave us the blood of his dear son hmm through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God a lot of big words in there Hallelujah I love that word perpetuation almost every Easter I go back over that it means a propitiary sacrifice praise God in the place of appropriation praise God that which perpetuates Hallelujah it's a mercy seat that which acts as a mercy seat so the blood of Jesus Christ acts as a mercy seat hallelujah it's a it's a mercy see that covers over uh the ark of the covenant it's a it's a landing place for the blood Hallelujah it closed off the judgments of the law it covered the judgments of the law praise God and when blood was received there then mercy was given and then God spoke from that Mercy Seat amen oh see that's that's how you know God speaks to you praise God because you're trusting in the blood amen Hallelujah that's how you know I'm trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ not my righteousness I'm trusting in his blood and therefore if I'm trusting in his blood it's been received in heaven and now God can talk to me that's what he told Aaron he said I'll meet you in there amen take the Blood start in the out of the court and take the blood anoint every part and I'll meet you in there if you can just come and buy the blood if you can just have a sacrifice I will talk to you but you've got to come through the blood oh I love that amen and we've got blood today Church the blood of Jesus Christ so what what does the blood do brother sister it reconciles you it brings you back into harmony with God now since we've been born we've never we started out as enemies with God how many know that child's born few days full of Trouble full of lies so how did they bring us back it brings us back to the place where God foreknew us it brings us back to that sinless state where God knew us in his mind Hallelujah see we get that Harmony Back so God has harmony with the sauce we thought we saw that a few weeks ago God has fellowship with his manifested thoughts when his thoughts get manifested in flesh or in theophany then he can have Battleship with them yeah that's a deep thought right there I'm not going to go too far on that that's pretty deep I don't even know if I can handle that so it brings us back the blood reconciles us praise God this which is why our faith must be in the blood it brings back Harmony it brings back peace with God so I don't want to fight against God you don't want to fight against God we want peace with God Hallelujah Colossians 1 21 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled a church all of us at one point were aliens to Christ we were enemies against Christ because of our Wicked thoughts and our Wicked works we all fought against the system we all fought against the blood imagine that my we all fought against forgiveness we all fought against Holiness but when we came to Christ then Jesus reconciled us when we had faith in his blood he brought us back to our former State again amen oh it's beautiful now remember this is right at the godhead Paul teaches the godhead and then he brings in here you fought against God but now God has brought you back in you are an alien to the covenants you were an alien to the promises you knew nothing about him you had War you were warning you were waging a war against the god of heaven but the god of Heaven in his kindness showed you his Mercy brought you to a place where you could recognize the cross and now you have peace with him and now you're reckon's out and now you're a son and daughter again as he saw you in his mind amen oh Hallelujah that's beautiful I'm not God's enemy and I'm not an alien to the things of God I'm a fellow receiver praise God I'm a recipient I'm a part of the family of God Hallelujah hold on Amen I've been laid here for two thousand years amen it's still fresh today it's just as fresh today as when Paul pended in that dirty prison Hallelujah just as fresh today how do you do this church how do you bring us into reconciliation in the body of his flesh through death so Jesus's death of his fleshly body reconciles us when it died when that Holy body died it brought Harmony between us and God and then I love this then he presents you remember this is it seems like it's going to go like this brother and tell us in the church age but he said the church H messenger each one will present their bride to Christ right and then Christ will present his bride to his father Hallelujah right because Jesus presents us holy and unblameable and unrebrewable in his sight oh my that was something Hallelujah so brother Ram will present his his elect from the laodicean church age he'll present Lord Jesus here's your bride that your word has has uh has has received this is this is the bride that your word produced for this age Lord these are the Overcomers this is your wife who was washed in the waters of your word amen for this generation so will Martin Luther say the same thing so will Paul Hallelujah so say Jesus even this is your bride even those Corinthians who are all about gifts and you know and emotion Hallelujah even those Galatians have brought legalism back in you forgave them and you baptized them with the Holy Ghost eventually right because the Bible says Jesus Christ will make you a chaste virgin under Christ amen none of us are spiritual versions of Christ because we all sin but that's what Jesus blood does it makes us spotless amen it makes us holy it makes us unblameable unreprovable you cannot put a blame on Jesus bride because of the blood amen glory amen because the blood reconciled me brought me in harmony and this is not future this is present and the church said this is not a future he hath he already did it praise God he's already he's going to be he's presenting you holy and unbelievable in his sight it was done through the cross amen again just like job I'm gonna get there in a minute job God's looking at you like a perfect work amen in heaven God sees you as a finished product he's got Harmony Hallelujah with that thought he knows what you're going to be Hallelujah you're going to be exactly what he wants you to be Hallelujah Hallelujah my buddy uh Jacob that we do Bible Club he brought in a piece of blue uh a piece of blue Play-Doh on Friday for our Bible Club lesson and he started he's like he's like God is like the Potter I may preach on the Potter because this kind of inspired me I might bring a piece of clay in here you know let the kids play around but he brought this piece of clay and he was talking about how God you know forgives us anoint us and he said and gods are shaping us and then he formed this blue heart and he come and brought it over he he brought it right by me while he's kind of teaching he kind of left the stage and come over here he said that's what God did for Jesse God formed Jesse's heart or Mr Smith's heart he calls me and he said he he formed him and he wouldn't leave him the way that he was amen he wouldn't leave my heart in the old wretched condition the the shapeless condition that it was but God formed the Potter took the clay took the heart of Mr Smith and formed it to how it should be Hallelujah that's what God is doing in our lives right now he's constantly forming us he's shaping us into a more perfect a more complete a more mature Christian he's the one forming it praise God you're his vessel amen hallelujah praise God you are his he's keeping you alive he's sustaining you you're consisting through this end of 2022 because of Jesus Christ I'm here because of Christ he sustained my life how does he do this through the blood Jesus calls you holy look at these three this is three three's completion right he calls you holy unblameable and unreprovable in his sight I'll never be that in my sight until I get a new body by the way once I got a new body system helmet then I'll be holy brother Jose then I'll be able to say I got a new body okay I'm blameless now I I don't have nose no more sin nature no more no more sadness Hallelujah no hard depression Hallelujah no more lust and no more greed no more now I'm holy Hallelujah I got a I'm a brand new creation I'm a brand new man Hallelujah Hallelujah but till then I can't say it because it's not in my sight but it's in God's sight now I can say I am in God's sight but I can't say in my sight Charleston why do I wake up every day feeling bad or discouraged you know why they got a battle every day because it's not about my sight it's about his sight right now I want to bring this out here remember this I preached this last Easter for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I've given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul so when Jesus shed his blood it atoned our souls his life pardons our life it was life for life Hallelujah and it was the opposite of punishment punishment was eye for an eye if you poke somebody's eye out your eye gets poked out if you break somebody's tooth your tooth gets broken if you kill somebody you get killed the punishment was eye for eye but the sacrifice shows the sacrificial system that was the system of punishment but the system of Pardon works the same amen hallelujah it was life for Life praise God Jesus died so I can live amen Hallelujah just was just as punishment was eye for eye so is pardon eye for eye it's life or life amen hallelujah it's his grace given to me all my sins on him but then all his righteousness on us hallelujah oh it's beautiful blood has always been the atonement the perpetuation The Mercy Seat for our souls and it was no different with Jesus blood in fact it was greater yes much greater praise God because the life is in the blood and the blood redeems the soul now here's the Greek words Jesus calls you holy which holy means the most holy thing a separated thing remember this is in his sight so Jesus looks at you when you're forgiven and he says you are except you are a most separated thing it's kind of like the holiest of holies you know you are the most separated thing aren't we Church we're the most holy people on Earth by the blood of Christ like I told you last week these guys that leave the message they get into Dracula they get into horror movies and murder movies and all kinds of they love that that's because they love the things of the world but we are spiritually and naturally we're supposed to be the most holy people separated set apart God help us God will forgive us when we fall short right but our our pattern our habits our direction is Holy Holy Holy unto the Lord amen we're constantly progressing in more Holiness praise God we're growing in the grace of God hallelujah oh it's a blessing praise God so Jesus looks at you and he says you are a Most Holy person you are separated Beyond denomination oh thank God Amen you're separated Beyond Catholicism your life is way more separated than a Baptist the church said I used to be a pretty good Baptist yeah I at least listen to the bachelor's preachers I enjoyed them I wouldn't go to actually just about to church but I like the Baptist preaching but now I'm more separated than I was then it's because of the blood of Christ the Holy Spirit working in my life so not only are you holy you are unblameable which means you have no blemish like when you buy a brand new shirt at the store right there's not one mark on it you think oh my goodness if only I could keep it this good like I'll go as long as I can without washing a shirt because I want to just just be nice no marks no stains I'll be real careful oh lasagna can't hold you now let's wipe your hands you got peanut butter all over your hands I just got my brand new shirt on all right without blemish free from fault unblameable that's Jesus sees you no faults amen just like Paul said when you walk in this mirror there is no not some condemnation there is no condemnation there's no condemnation to them now they are in Christ Jesus who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh that's his sight looking at you brother and sister You Are Holy you are unblameable I like this last one unreprovable so you are separate you're the most separated people on the Earth from sin you have no Faults and you cannot be accused so if I looked at your clothes you had no Faults but then if I brought you before a judge the judge couldn't accuse you you haven't done anything wrong there's no Witnesses amen you can't be accused nobody can accuse you because all all your sin was placed on Jesus amen not just the sins you did before you became a Christian but the sins after he became a Christian praise God and not just your sins and my sins but the sins of the whole world Amen Hallelujah placed on one man on one Mercy Saint praise God and then all those who will receive it will receive this unmerited Grace praise God and they'll be brought into Covenant no longer alien no longer a stranger but a fellow citizen of the kingdom of God that's the gospel amen Hallelujah and these words have been laying here for two thousand years and yet we sometimes here see that's why we need these words we get discouraged we feel like we're we have faults we do it our flesh but not in his sight is that right that's the word of God well I see all my stains why this stain this week staying last week that stained the week before oh yeah that guy did witness my yeah I made that mistake at work I forgot yeah that guy did see it yeah and so we get discouraged but that's our sight God doesn't want us to think about our side yeah we have to confess in our sight but once we confess we understand we are forgiven and God is not judging us God is not God is not trying to warn us well you're going to go to hell the Bible says in his sight we're already holy he's going to present us holy unblameable unreprovable he's going to present himself abroad because nobody else could do it nobody else could wash his bride he himself had to wash his bride he's going to make sure his right is Holy unreprovable Hallelujah he's going to make sure she's holy that's what he's doing today he's washing us today praise God he's getting us ready praise God through the test of our life the trials of Our Lives he's making sure we'll be holy that's always my prayer Lord do anything in my life whatever it takes to keep me holy and filled with the Holy Ghost I know I can't lose myself but what I mean is keep my testimony I know you can't lose the seal the Holy Ghost but just keep me so close just keep me close to the side of my savior and God may I never in darkness Rove keep my path free from free from wrath and keep my soul satisfied feel my way every day with love amen as I walk with the Heavenly holy Dove amen let me go all the while with a song and a smile feel my way every day we might have to sing that buddy feel my way every day with love Hallelujah thank you Jesus that's so that's how God sees you but amen you're holy unblameable unreprovable sister who else so you know that's how God sees you holy unblameable unreprovable nobody can find a fault nobody can even speak a word against you but Austin in heaven that's what the Bible says he's going to bring through and what did that the cross did that it wasn't your fastings it wasn't your arms although I believe you know I preached those hard I believe that fasting praying and giving of all I believe in that but that's not how he did it it was through the cross it was the blood of Jesus Christ and out of your appreciation for that yes then you surrender you you give up a couple meals I think about your just a couple meals you're only giving up a couple meals it's not like you're fasting for four years or something like that I mean you can just give up a couple meals a week Hallelujah Pharisees did too I mean we could at least do a couple Wheels a week right it's not going to be by our ability it's by God's ability it's through God's sacrifice the blood purges our souls the blood purchased our souls the blood made atonement we are reconciled we belong to him amen Gloria unaccused there is no one to accuse you in heaven now how's this done it's simply through acknowledging your sin remember brother Jim preached this one I was praying this morning I'm like that's right was praying I'm like yes I saw my notes in my mind so see I'm a visual learner I like let me look up this up the something on my phone see all David did I acknowledged my sin and my iniquity have I not hit just don't hide anything from God just be honest with God and then I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin let me pause and meditate on that Hallelujah that's all we have to do Church don't hide anything from God Amen my brother said let that he preached a door and a door every door in your life every every situation in your life Let Jesus into that situation open open that situation up whether it's you know relationships or finances always say Jesus come on in I need to talk with you praise God every area of my life oh I'm opening all these doors come into my entire life I'm not hiding anything Lord my life is an open book come in and sup with me praise God so you talk about communion Hallelujah because he's another good Old Testament and New Testament we can't say it's different it's the same we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and they cleanse us from all unrighteousness everybody say oh can we oh as long as you say Lord Lord it was my sin don't say the devil made me do it no you didn't I didn't I did it was my sin because my unbelief in that moment as long as you say it's mine and forgive me then the Bible said he will forgive all unrighteousness and that's the power of the pardon hallelujah hallelujah I for iTunes for truth life for life Hallelujah and then he cleanses you from all our righteousness see the cleansing Waters just saying I'm sorry just saying Lord that was my fault that's actually the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit Forgive Me Lord and then I said I said you forgave me I said I confess and then I said he forgave me that's what I say that's what you say that's got to be our confession I confess and that I believe I'm forgiven praise God it has to be that that's God's system it has to work Glory now this made me think a joke so I'm going to go back to this great sermon I felt like God gave me a greater Revelation a couple years ago I'm just going to bring back a couple of thoughts the Bible said job was in Job 1 1 he was perfect and upright one that feared God and has skewed evil so he was he had integrity which means he tried to live to as honest as he could to God he took responsibility for his wrongs and he confessed them okay doesn't mean he never sinned right now the word upright he was perfect he was he had Integrity he was upright which means he was straight correct now church this could mean too he was correct in saying I'm wrong we should be correct on saying I'm wrong don't miss that be correct and say Lord it was my fault it was my sin it wasn't the devil's fault you allowed him to come it was my fault just be upright be correct just judge the situation right that it was me it was my fault I gave in to my sinful nature see perfect and upright he was correct and he feared God so he was he was afraid of God in other words he had he had healthy respect for God a healthy reverence and this is the one I love he has scooty but I never seen it like this before until today he is skewed evil which means he departed from that way so when Satan would offer him hey here's the evil way you could walk in this he would say no sir I'm going the other way or Satan just came right in front of him and said oh let me tell you about this he said get behind me Satan thou are an offense unto me does he say sees Church Satan offer you all these all these alternative routes they're called the permission will of God they'll say well if you do this I mean it might work out pretty good this way but but no we got to choose the right path when you Askew evil you depart from the wrong path and you choose the right path this is the kind of man job was Satan would present evil things but he would live above it he would he would go the other way he wouldn't follow Satan's paths he would walk in God's paths he rejected evil he put it aside amen hallelujah instead of holding on to sin he put it aside and that reminds you to lay aside every sin Hallelujah and any sin that easily besets us and run the race let's run the race with patience reject evil this makes you like job now this is one from my sermon a couple years ago job had a list of failures he had a list of good habits so should we right but he also he battled great fear about losing his family losing his children his money uh Eli who told job he had iniquity in his life see not uh yeah he was not just he had Pride he was at ease sometimes he got a little lazy on God church that we all get lazy on God sometimes but that's our side that's our side I'm trying to get us to see God's side amen hallelujah these are all true and the Bible said he was in Rebellion against God when he was saying I'm I'm righteous and God's not I'm actually the righteous one look that's what he said in job 32 these these men could see it these three men could see that job was calling himself righteous and then Eli who comes and says uh job God's Wrath is kindled against you because I'm sorry Elijah whose wrath was against job because he justified himself rather than God did you see that the three friends were right on some things job was a little self-righteous sometimes church we get a little self-righteous praise God but see God's not looking at that Amen in God's side job was a perfect man amen and God brought job to this test to prove to the devil that he'll serve me because he loves me amen Hallelujah he don't serve me just for blessings he serves me because he loves me amen he wants Visions he wants the word of God and he caught that Vision My Redeemer liveth and I know I'll stand with him on the earth someday in this flesh I shall see God Amen in other words he wanted to be one of those Saints he wanted to be one of those redeemed he was looking for that he was a real believer he wanted to be with the Messiah so do we we'll be with him in the Rapture amen Hallelujah but was he human 100 percent 100 percent did he Askew Evil all the time not always I just told you where he didn't always ask you evil sometimes he let fear hang around too long sometimes he let self-righteousness and pride hang around a little too long and then in his greatest trial he even spoke against God but then God by his Mercy sent Elijah to bring him to humility and then even got himself come down to bring him to humility oh it's a beautiful story job knew he not sinned because he come upon the base of God's word now see brother let's talk about the sacrifice he come upon the bases of the shed blood knowing that God required a blood sacrifice and blood was what job offered knowing that God could not refuse it the whole picture is a perfect revelation God gave blood blood is an atonement for the soul so job knew I've sinned I've fallen short I've had fear all these things but he still brought blood and the blood was God's system it was life for life this life was given so my life could be redeemed amen it was life for life and job knew as long as I sacrificed as long as I confess my sins and call on God God will forgive me and God in heaven recognizes and says Satan he's perfect praise God he excuse evil because of the blood amen Hallelujah isn't that what the Bible says I preached us a few weeks ago the God of Peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will work in you that which is well pleasing the sight through Jesus Christ see the blood will make you come to make you perfect the blood of the Covenant will make you perfect Covenant is the oath or a promise God keeps his promise sometimes we don't keep our promises but God keeps his all the time Hallelujah for eternity God's promise that the blood will make you perfect cannot fail Hallelujah it will make you perfect for every good work in your life Church most of us are just getting started we're all saying you're 25. 17. for the name anyway just getting started Hallelujah just getting started God is going to do a great thing he's going to make you perfect for every good work in your life praise God Jose and brother William and I because some of those older ones can say Amen praise God God has made us you're yeah you're a young man that's right buddy that's right you're right Hallelujah yeah you're only as old as you say you are so but I'm sure those of us who've been around a little longer can see that God has made everything in our our life work together for good and if we really wanted we would there's very few things we'd really go back and change because we knew we got us I mean we had to sin somehow right we have we're not perfect we're going to make mistakes somehow I mean yeah we wish we could do that but then if we didn't do that we probably did something else so in other words we can look back with our lives brother Jose brother and William with no regrets because it was God's grace that brought us here as God's grace sustaining us as God's grace that'll take us home and the blood will do what the Covenant said it will do amen it's a promise it's a promise the blood will make you perfect the blood will make Jesus see you as holy unreprovable without rebuke in his sight amen because he's looking at you through the blood amen through your sacrifice just like he looked at job through the sacrifice God's promise cannot change God's God has never changed he's always looking at Believers through the blood Hallelujah just like Adam and Eve what's the first thing you did with Adam and Eve let me go kill some ghost kids but and then he cast him out he said but I'm going to bring you back in one day gonna bring him in praise God Hallelujah in the Millennium is going to bring him in Hallelujah future home he's going to bring him back into his presence Hallelujah because this is why God said have you considered job he's perfect and upright he's upright he excuse evil he always he will always depart from evil in other words eventually he'll depart from I know he's going to confess that he's going to make it right that's why God could call him perfect he excuse evil remember Church in Job 1 verse 5 what was job doing we know he had fear trouble he had Pride trouble he had all these iniquities he had a rebellion against God but what was he doing all the time he was always go into the sacrificial altar he's always saying God forgive me forgive my children here's the sacrifice in other words he was spending time with God In Prayer this did he continually Church what is it it's continual repentance you and I must continually spend time before the Throne of God talking to God about things Hallelujah making sacrifices speaking with him we must be unspeaking terms amen job was on speaking terms with God Amen and God could look down and say he's holy he's unrebrewable he's my man on the earth praise God he's my child and my Covenant will not be broken with him I will keep my Covenant because he's kept my Covenant that's why coming to church is so powerful that's why praying every day repenting every day is so powerful because it's keeping the Covenant that God gave us recognizing I'm not perfect on Earth but I know in heaven in his sight I am because of the blood in my country in this Covenant I do have to confess on this Earth every single day right because I sin every day in one breath Paul can say I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus he he can say Brothers I'm more than a colleague he's now the Roman Church I am more than the Conqueror next in the next breath he said I'm an O Wretched Man that I am there's just two chapter one two one chapter apart one chapter apart he goes from Wretched Man to oh now that I'm in Christ so when I walk in the spirit he said now I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah church that's how we go sometimes one breath you know will be oh so discouraged next service I'm on top of the world Amen Hallelujah God's good amen God's heard my prayers God loves me one service I don't know if he loves me maybe he gave up on me next service the blood can never fail amen I'm in his sight I'm holy unreprovable without review gay man I love this this gospel amen Hallelujah how do we get that Redemption brother through the blood Faith In The Blood redeems us buys us back purchase us back what is redemption it's the releasing of the payment the releasing of the punishment when you have trust in the blood it releases the punishment that you owed the payment that you owed which the wages of sin is what death that should be your wage the wages of sin is death for our sins the actual payment for that the check that we should receive for our sins is death but Jesus Took the death for us Jesus Took the payment for us
