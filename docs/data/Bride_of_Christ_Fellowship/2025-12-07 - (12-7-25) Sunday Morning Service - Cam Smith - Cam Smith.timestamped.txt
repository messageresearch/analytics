[0:00] trying to trying to be a real man
[0:01] nowadays. And I realized I walk in I see
[0:04] brother Jose that's a real beard right
[0:06] there. I heard a brother say one time he
[0:08] said that's a beard that other beards
[0:10] are jealous of and uh that's a factual
[0:12] thing. So uh we appreciate our brother
[0:15] his uh his great gift God has given him
[0:17] because some of us others can't do stuff
[0:19] like that. So I think it was about 40
[0:21] when it really kicked in that we could
[0:23] uh do such things. But uh we want to uh
[0:26] anyway just uh thank God for your pastor
[0:28] here and uh brother Jesse's a he's a
[0:32] real a real brother in Christ and uh we
[0:34] know that God will bring a rapture
[0:37] people into a rapture from this place.
[0:39] I'm confident about that. I'm I'm
[0:42] absolutely believe that 100%. Uh so that
[0:45] means that I'm I'm not just preaching to
[0:47] just some people today. I'm preaching to
[0:48] the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh my. Look
[0:50] at brother Vang's got one too. Wow.
[0:52] Hallelujah. But uh I do believe that the
[0:54] bride of Christ is here. Yeah. Yeah. You
[0:56] know how it goes. Um but um let's go
[1:00] ahead and get into our Bibles here. We
[1:02] we appreciate brother Jesse's sacrifice.
[1:04] It's a it's a very difficult thing to be
[1:06] a pastor, especially if you're a real
[1:08] pastor. Uh many have made a pastor a
[1:12] five-fold ministry that that that
[1:14] pastors all of it. Uh but we're so glad
[1:16] that God has uh ordained men to be
[1:19] faithful uh as a shepherd where they're
[1:22] called to be. And uh with that uh you
[1:26] know what it's it's a very thankless uh
[1:28] job so to say. Uh it's not a job but
[1:30] it's a calling. Um and if you think
[1:32] about it in the New Testament um uh how
[1:35] many times uh can anyone tell me how
[1:36] many times is the word pastor actually
[1:38] written in the New Testament?
[1:42] One time. five-fold ministry. One time a
[1:46] shepherd. Well, why? Now, think about
[1:48] it. In Egypt, uh Egypt viewed a shepherd
[1:51] as an abomination.
[1:54] It was a hated a hated occupation.
[1:59] That's why many times you see a shepherd
[2:00] will want to go out and preach
[2:02] everywhere
[2:04] and try to gain some sort of uh
[2:06] popularity or position or something. But
[2:08] a real shepherd uh is one who will spend
[2:11] most of his time, if not almost all of
[2:12] his time, right at home with the sheep.
[2:14] He he gets a smell of the sheep on him.
[2:16] And uh he's probably got a little smell
[2:17] himself, I reckon. I I suppose I do. Uh
[2:20] but we came here to be a blessing to
[2:21] you. And I'm I'm so glad I uh that's a
[2:24] real man of God right there. And uh I
[2:26] have no doubt about that. So uh and we
[2:28] got some real Christians here. And uh uh
[2:30] you know, sometimes I I come back. It's
[2:32] been a long time since I've been here,
[2:33] but uh we're glad to be here. And I I
[2:35] just trust that we can put our spiritual
[2:37] thinking caps on today. You know, you
[2:39] know, you know the way I am. Uh anyone
[2:40] that's been here long enough, I I I just
[2:43] dig right into the word and I just let
[2:44] her roll. So, that's just kind of the
[2:46] way I I've always been. I want to say
[2:48] one more uh thing is that uh um it won't
[2:51] be long, brother sister. It won't be
[2:53] long till this rapture. I'm confident of
[2:55] that. Um I'm watching things that are
[2:57] happening uh in the spiritual realm, in
[2:59] the natural realm. Uh it's not going to
[3:01] be long. So, we we've got to consecrate
[3:03] our way to God. Amen. and do everything
[3:05] we can uh to uh to just love him.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Love him with everything you got.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a merit. Uh but uh we
[3:16] understand that uh works is faith
[3:19] expressed.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; So uh we we show we love him by our
[3:23] works, but our works really don't mean
[3:24] much more than that.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe you've been well
[3:27] taught here. I know that. Uh so we're
[3:30] not trying to do anything there. But uh
[3:31] I want to I want to preach something to
[3:33] set you free today. Uh uh just something
[3:35] just as I was praying, just laboring. I
[3:37] preached this at the home church just
[3:38] recently and uh we might uh just try to
[3:41] bring it all together for you if we can.
[3:43] Um but yet uh let's uh go ahead and get
[3:45] our Bibles out if we can. Uh we already
[3:47] done waved them before the Lord in
[3:49] worship. I see I got all my my beautiful
[3:51] nieces here, all these other Sister
[3:52] Naomi's daughters. Everybody's just
[3:54] growing up and uh just uh beautiful as
[3:56] ever. And I see some new faces, a couple
[3:58] little ones, and God bless them. And uh
[4:00] it's a great place that uh that we're
[4:02] at. Amen. Amen.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to open up to Exodus
[4:05] 23:10.
[4:08] Um,
[4:09] these things could really, really,
[4:11] really be um preached uh in numerous
[4:14] numerous sermons. Uh, but we're going to
[4:15] try to bring a thought to you uh as
[4:17] quickly as concisely as we possibly can.
[4:20] Uh, seeing the time and uh by God's
[4:23] grace uh we will uh do our best to sew
[4:26] this in. And I want you to rejoice. Uh I
[4:28] I want you to love the Lord because you
[4:29] you are a very ordained people to be
[4:31] standing at the se end of the seventh
[4:33] church age. You're very blessed,
[4:36] tremendously blessed. Uh we are watching
[4:38] we're watching preachers fall away.
[4:40] We're watching individuals fall away uh
[4:43] at numbers that uh would be uh esteemed
[4:46] as amazing because um once you come into
[4:50] this this calling of God, I'm going to
[4:53] say it like that because it's not what
[4:55] we find is that preachers can get it on
[4:57] here in the mind level, individuals can
[4:59] have it on the mind level, but have they
[5:00] actually met the met the person or the
[5:03] God of this message?
[5:05] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're really at right
[5:06] now. How many want to meet God? Amen.
[5:08] just
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I had 20 sermons. I
[5:10] got 20 sermons in a series right now
[5:12] going with that. Uh but uh I won't be
[5:15] able to do that today, but we'll we'll
[5:16] just uh sew in right here. Exodus 23:10.
[5:18] Then we'll go to Hebrews 4. Uh and then
[5:20] one more place, uh Exodus 23, it says uh
[5:23] and six years thou shalt sew thy land
[5:25] and thy and shall gather in the fruits
[5:27] thereof, but in the seventh year thou
[5:29] shalt let it rest and lie still. I like
[5:32] that.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; The seven's always the rest. Ain't that
[5:36] right? Uh you realize this seventh
[5:38] church age, even though it's the hardest
[5:40] of all ages, this is actually an age of
[5:42] rest.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Should be.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; We'll get to something in just a little
[5:47] bit. That the poor of thy people may
[5:49] eat. Uh and what they leave the beast of
[5:52] the field shall eat. In like manner thou
[5:54] shalt deal with thy vineyard and with
[5:56] thy olive. Amen. Uh seventh year, what'
[5:59] they have to do? They had a sabbatical
[6:01] uh a sabbatical rest or a sabbatical
[6:04] year, right? Um, Hebrews 4:1.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; After that, we'll go to John 8.
[6:10] I've, uh, taken taken a lot of my
[6:12] sermons offline. Just kind of felt led
[6:14] to do that. Uh, didn't want to be
[6:16] anybody else's pastor. I thought that
[6:18] would be something appropriate. So, most
[6:20] you, if almost all of you, probably have
[6:21] not heard this, uh, which I trust would
[6:23] be a blessing to you. Uh Hebrews 4:1 it
[6:26] says, "Let us therefore fear lest a
[6:30] promise being left us of entering into
[6:33] his rest." Uh this this should be the
[6:36] thing that we're worried about.
[6:38] Any of you should seem to come short of
[6:40] it. I don't want anybody here to come
[6:41] short of that. Your pastor don't, right?
[6:43] I don't want anybody at home to come
[6:44] short of it. For unto us was the gospel
[6:47] preached as well as unto them. But the
[6:49] word preached did not profit them, not
[6:52] being mixed with faith in them that
[6:54] heard it. Amen. Uh so this rest, notice
[6:57] it's actually a mixture of hearing the
[7:01] word and and placing faith on it.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; You've we've got to place faith on the
[7:06] word of God. Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For we which have believed
[7:10] do enter into rest uh as he has as he
[7:14] said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if
[7:16] they shall enter into my rest, although
[7:18] the works were finished from the
[7:19] foundation of the world, it's already
[7:21] been finished.
[7:22] Hallelujah. Uh for he spake in a certain
[7:25] place of the seventh day on the w on
[7:27] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[7:29] day from all his works and in this place
[7:32] again uh if they shall enter into my
[7:35] rest. Amen. We want to be a people of
[7:37] rest right. Uh rest that word rest means
[7:41] it means to cease from motion.
[7:45] So where's your trying?
[7:48] &gt;&gt; No wonder brother Brooks sung that song.
[7:50] It's not not in trying but in trusting.
[7:53] That's right.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. John 8:34, last one. We We like
[7:56] this. I know you do.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them saying, uh, answer
[8:02] them, verily, verily, I say unto you,
[8:04] whosoever committh sin uh is the servant
[8:07] of sin. You become a servant to it.
[8:10] Right?
[8:10] &gt;&gt; And the servant abideth not in the house
[8:13] forever, but the son abideth forever.
[8:17] Amen. And if the son therefore shall
[8:20] make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
[8:25] Uh let's tap in today and see how free
[8:27] we are and then why we should be free
[8:30] and how much of amazing word God has
[8:34] given us to be free.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for a word of
[8:37] prayer.
[8:39] God sees your needs, your hearts, and I
[8:41] believe these things have already been
[8:42] prayed for. But let's continue to pray.
[8:44] Uh pray unseeing, without ceasing. Lord
[8:47] Jesus, we approach you today, oh God, uh
[8:49] just the reading of the word, and we'd
[8:51] ask you to add your blessings to it,
[8:53] Lord. And Lord, as we've become so
[8:56] accustomed to being in your presence, uh
[8:58] so accustomed to how a gift works, oh
[9:01] God, uh we're asking today, Lord, that
[9:03] you just be mighty in this place, oh
[9:05] God. Uh I pray, oh God, that you'd be
[9:08] able to do marvels in the people's eyes
[9:10] uh uh in the spiritual realm, in their
[9:12] lives, oh God. uh as Lord, I I see that
[9:15] you're doing a transition in me, oh God.
[9:18] So Lord, we're believing that uh this
[9:20] word is is a word that's in season for
[9:22] this people, Lord. Uh it's been on my
[9:24] heart, oh God, the last uh day or so
[9:26] just to really go this way. So Lord, uh
[9:28] we're believing that you'll touch them.
[9:29] And Lord, we're asking, oh God, that you
[9:31] just uh uh we understand that, Lord,
[9:32] it's only you that can open the eyes of
[9:34] the people, Lord. And Lord, so many
[9:36] times we come to church and we hear
[9:38] something and we just move to the next
[9:39] word. But oh God, uh even so much and
[9:42] that's all right. But Lord, we would
[9:44] love to actually apply every word that
[9:47] you feed us with and to watch the result
[9:49] of that in our daily walk, Lord. So
[9:52] we're asking uh that you would allow
[9:54] that to be upon this people today. Let
[9:56] their eyes be wide open, oh God. Uh
[9:59] seeing the fullness of your spirit
[10:00] moving on their behalf in their midst.
[10:02] So Lord, we believe that you'll do that
[10:04] now. now and we're just asking that Lord
[10:05] we'd all be yielded because if we can
[10:06] get yielded and if we can get in one
[10:08] place in one accord uh surely oh God
[10:10] there's there's no limit to what you
[10:12] could do. So God move in our midst for
[10:14] the glory in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:15] pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[10:21] This may have been preached over here uh
[10:24] before but we're going to rehearse it if
[10:25] it has been. Uh but then uh the Lord
[10:28] just kind of just seemed to uh unopen
[10:30] these things to us uh in a way that we
[10:32] believe it'll be a blessing to you. And
[10:34] uh today we're we're going to uh work
[10:37] with the Hebrew word here. Um maybe
[10:39] you've heard it uh and we want to touch
[10:42] today the unveiling uh unveiling the
[10:45] shmita and uh how many are familiar with
[10:49] the shmita? All right, that's good. I
[10:51] got no hands up.
[10:54] Hallelujah. We got a new one coming.
[10:58] But uh we've been preaching a series at
[11:00] home and the Lord just really gave us an
[11:02] uh an inspiration to do so. And we were
[11:04] w
[11:06] u with with leaving uh Israel leaving
[11:08] Egypt in an Exodus. And then uh they of
[11:11] course they entered a wilderness period.
[11:13] And uh uh anyway, they were not meant to
[11:17] be in that wilderness long, but yet it
[11:19] was an ordained season for them that it
[11:21] would be that way. And uh what we're
[11:23] actually finding today is that these
[11:26] things are actually ordained in our
[11:28] lives. Isn't it something that we could
[11:29] be 60 years after the death of a prophet
[11:32] and here we are? Uh why are we here?
[11:35] What's going on? Uh so uh we have a a
[11:39] very interesting circumstance and it's
[11:41] been hit in many ways and many thoughts
[11:43] and many ideas uh especially in the
[11:46] realms of the message. But uh uh of
[11:49] course that uh would talk about us,
[11:51] right? because we we believe this
[11:52] message, right? But we would like to uh
[11:55] just maybe uh move in a route according
[11:58] to something the Lord has shown us. Uh
[12:00] but notice the unveiling uh the Shmita
[12:04] there. Uh so we'd like to open your eyes
[12:07] to it. Now uh this is not an
[12:09] advertisement for a Jonathan Khan book.
[12:12] Some of you say, "Oh, I know what the
[12:13] Shmita uh he wrote a book uh uh about
[12:15] the Shmita." He sure did. Uh but we're
[12:18] not here to to advertise a book or even
[12:20] I can't even tell you what's in it
[12:21] because I don't don't fully understand
[12:23] that but I haven't read it. But uh we'd
[12:25] like to follow the word route for that
[12:27] this morning. And uh if you've read that
[12:29] then then uh you can apply what uh you
[12:31] so desire. Amen. Uh but we would like
[12:33] this to be unveiled to us. And uh if you
[12:36] can see this then this will be a great
[12:38] blessing to you. Uh so uh we want to
[12:40] start here that uh uh remember in God's
[12:43] law uh how he would orchestrate it
[12:45] amongst the people. Uh God always worked
[12:47] with sevens, right? Seven was always uh
[12:50] a finish. It was always a completion in
[12:52] God's mind. Uh but yet uh uh we
[12:55] understand that that was very important
[12:57] because uh there would there would be
[13:00] seven Old Testament church ages and then
[13:02] there would be seven New Testament
[13:03] church ages, right? uh even when God's
[13:06] seen a dispensation of time that was
[13:08] given for a specific people, he himself
[13:11] would actually come on the scene and uh
[13:13] he would do uh great things especially
[13:16] in that seventh, right? Uh aren't you
[13:19] glad that you've been born in the
[13:20] seventh church age? Amen. Uh as our
[13:23] prophet would say, he said, he said,
[13:24] "There no other age I'd like to live in,
[13:26] the age of the rapture." And then HE'D
[13:28] SAY, "OH, I HOPE I LIVE TO SEE IT."
[13:30] AMEN.
[13:32] We understand he he's gone now, right?
[13:35] Uh but thank God that there'll be a
[13:37] shout and then a voice and that voice
[13:39] will raise up uh those who had went
[13:42] before, right? Uh to move them into the
[13:45] season of this rapture, right? But uh we
[13:47] want to today start working with the
[13:49] sabbatical year. I'm not going to try to
[13:51] sit here very long because I've got to
[13:53] get to the schmita. All right. But uh in
[13:55] uh Leviticus 25:1, it says, "The Lord
[13:58] spake unto Moses and Mount Si." NOTICE
[14:00] IT THIS IS JUST LEAVING EGYPT WITHIN A
[14:03] COUPLE WEEKS, RIGHT? Uh a month at most.
[14:06] And what remember the people could not
[14:08] enter into uh the right covenant with
[14:11] God BECAUSE THEY WERE SCARED of God,
[14:13] right? Therefore, THEY WANTED A LAW. AND
[14:16] WHEN THEY WANTED A LAW, WHAT' GOD DO? HE
[14:18] SAID, "OKAY, MOSES, AMEN, you can enter
[14:21] into this communion with me. You come up
[14:23] on high and I'll reveal the word to
[14:26] you." Amen. UH SO HERE NOW MOSES IS
[14:29] ENTERING INTO Mount Si and notice UH
[14:32] THIS IS LONG BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE
[14:34] LAND BUT HE'S ACTUALLY giving them a
[14:37] revelation about the future. All right.
[14:40] And he said speak unto the children of
[14:42] Israel and SAY UNTO THEM WHEN YE COME
[14:45] into the land which I give you. All
[14:49] right. So notice this is uh remember
[14:51] they were wandering in the wilderness
[14:53] for 40 years. BUT HE SAYS UH GOD TELLS
[14:55] HIM WHEN YOU GO INTO THAT LAND,
[14:59] &gt;&gt; that land of rest, THAT LAND OF THE HOLY
[15:02] GHOST,
[15:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, then shall the land keep a
[15:07] Sabbath unto the Lord. The land would
[15:11] have a Sabbath. Oh my. Six years thou
[15:14] shalt sew thy field, and six years thou
[15:17] shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in
[15:19] the fruit thereof. But in the seventh
[15:21] year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the
[15:24] land. A Sabbath for the Lord. Amen. It's
[15:29] for the land. But notice it's a Sabbath
[15:32] for the Lord.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER ON THAT SEVENTH DAY THE LORD
[15:38] RESTED. AMEN.
[15:40] And he says uh that which groweth of its
[15:43] own accord of thy harvest uh thou shalt
[15:45] not reap neither gather the grapes of
[15:47] the vine undressed. For it is a year of
[15:49] rest unto the land. Amen. And the
[15:53] Sabbath of the land shall be meat for
[15:55] you, for thee, for thy servant, for thy
[15:57] maid, for thy hired servant, and for thy
[16:00] stranger that sojoureneth uh with thee.
[16:03] Amen. On that seventh year, uh what
[16:06] would happen of course IS GOD WOULD IN
[16:08] ONCE THEY WERE getting into the promised
[16:10] land that seventh year they were to
[16:12] rest. Amen. The land would have a rest.
[16:15] Hallelujah. The people would freely be
[16:17] able to live on a land at rest. Now
[16:19] understand what that means. That means
[16:21] when they went in there and they
[16:22] positionally placed it THAT WHAT? THAT
[16:25] NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO PLANT that
[16:27] ground. They would have to let it rest.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; The animals could eat wherever they
[16:31] want. The people could eat wherever they
[16:33] want. They could be a free people. Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS POWERFUL BECAUSE YOU'RE A
[16:38] FREE PEOPLE. AMEN. We're in a seven
[16:41] church age. WE HAVE A GOD THAT SENT A
[16:43] WORD TO SET US FREE. AMEN. AND BROTHER,
[16:46] SISTER, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE READ. THAT
[16:49] WHOM THE SON IS SET FREE IS FREE INDEED.
[16:52] AMEN.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REJOICE. ARE YOU FREE? AMEN. YOU
[16:56] CAN REJOICE. I'M FREE. AMEN. NOT BECAUSE
[16:59] OF MY WORKS, BUT BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE AND
[17:02] GRACE AND SHED BLOOD FOR ME. AMEN.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm going to get to something here
[17:10] that's very ironic
[17:13] because we find that this Sabbath,
[17:17] even historically, you hardly hear of
[17:20] anything of it
[17:22] in the Bible. It's not very uh often
[17:26] mentioned.
[17:27] And most of it is most likely because of
[17:30] this
[17:32] uh because even when God gave them the
[17:33] law,
[17:35] it was a conditional thing because
[17:38] frankly they were under the law.
[17:42] Now remember, are you under a law today?
[17:48] Hallelujah. Our prophet said you're
[17:49] under the unwritten law of choice.
[17:55] Hallelujah. But we're actually under
[17:57] grace. Maybe I'll go this way today
[18:00] &gt;&gt; later on. We'll see. Maybe I'll go
[18:02] through it now. I don't know. Whatever
[18:03] the Lord wants me to do, that's where I
[18:04] want to be. BUT NOTICE HERE, GOD
[18:06] actually gave them, remember, everything
[18:08] was talking about this land of milk and
[18:10] honey. Everything was talking how a
[18:12] great place it's going to be, and it's
[18:14] going to be the best thing ever for
[18:15] them. But when God actually sent them in
[18:17] in Leviticus 26 says, "But if you will
[18:19] not hearken unto me and will not do all
[18:20] these commandments, and if ye shall
[18:22] despise my statutes, or if ye your soul
[18:25] abhore my judgment, so that you will not
[18:27] do all my commandments, but that ye
[18:30] break my covenant." And he actually
[18:32] starts going through and showing how
[18:33] they're going to be destroyed in every
[18:34] single way you could think of.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; But now he moves down uh to a place they
[18:39] won't even be at the land. He says, "I
[18:41] will scatter you among the heathen."
[18:43] 33rd verse. AND WILL DRAW OUT A SWORD
[18:45] AFTER YOU, and your land shall be
[18:46] desolate, and your cities waste. But
[18:49] notice, then your then uh shall the land
[18:52] enjoy her Sabbath as long as it lith
[18:55] desolate, and ye be in your enemy's
[18:57] land. Even the land shall the land rest
[19:00] and enjoy her Sabbath.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; The land was going to rest whether they
[19:03] were there or not.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because they didn't
[19:08] want to enter into
[19:10] a love for God and stay in that land.
[19:14] They knew this beforehand and they still
[19:17] served other gods. They still did not
[19:18] put Christ where Christ belonged. How
[19:20] many want to put Christ where he
[19:21] belongs? Amen. He belongs in you. Amen.
[19:24] HE WANTS TO DWELL IN YOU, LIVE IN YOU.
[19:26] AMEN.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; He is life
[19:30] &gt;&gt; and life abundantly. Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "And upon them that are left
[19:38] alive of you, I will send a faintness
[19:40] into their hearts and into the land of
[19:42] their enemies. Uh, and the sound of a
[19:44] shaken leaf shall chase them, and they
[19:46] shall flee as as fleeing from a sword,
[19:48] and they shall fall when none pursueth."
[19:50] Isn't that something? They wouldn't even
[19:52] be able to battle if they didn't love
[19:54] the word of God. If they didn't just
[19:56] serve the Lord. Isn't
[19:58] &gt;&gt; that something?
[20:00] But they still were in a land that was
[20:01] going to rest.
[20:05] So we have a choice.
[20:07] We can enter into something.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Let's get into it. All right. So notice
[20:13] I actually preached this. This is what
[20:14] the part of the 20 sermons is. Is that
[20:17] God actually took them right up to the
[20:20] land of promise and what they took the
[20:22] report of uh the um the testimony of 10
[20:26] false spies and they did not go into the
[20:28] land. But when you look at the
[20:30] scripture, uh God says two things. Uh he
[20:33] says that he would have to teach them to
[20:34] war
[20:36] and that he would have to teach them
[20:38] that man does not live by bread alone
[20:39] but by every word that proceedth out of
[20:41] the mouth of God. He would prove them in
[20:43] the wilderness. He would teach them how
[20:45] to fight.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; He would teach them what UH HOW TO LIVE
[20:50] ON THE WORD OF GOD.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, BROTHER, SISTER?
[20:54] GOD IS PROVING US RIGHT NOW IF we'll
[20:56] live by the word OF GOD. HE'S TELL HE'S
[20:59] SHOWING US THAT WE CAN LIVE UH under the
[21:02] condition TO BE A FIGHTER FOR THE LORD.
[21:04] AMEN.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SOLDIER. AMEN. YOU'RE A
[21:08] FIGHTER. AND BROTHER, SISTER, NOTICE, IF
[21:11] THEY DIDN'T LIVE BY THE WORD, THEIR
[21:14] ENEMIES WOULD CONSTANTLY BEAT THEM UP.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER, SISTER, IF YOU DON'T LIVE
[21:19] BY THE WORD, THEN THE ENEMY IS GOING TO
[21:22] GET SICKNESS IN YOUR LIFE. HE'S GOING TO
[21:24] GET WHAT? HE'S GOING TO GET WEAK SPOTS
[21:26] ALL OVER YOUR MIND WHERE YOU YOU CAN'T
[21:28] STAND ON THE WORD. YOU CAN'T DEFY THE
[21:30] DEVIL. BROTHER, SISTER, THERE'S A GOD
[21:32] THAT WE SERVE. AMEN. WHO COULD GET ON
[21:35] DAVID AND GO TO AN UNCIRCUMCISED
[21:37] PHILISTINE AND SAY, "TODAY YOUR HEAD
[21:40] WILL BE MINE." AMEN.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL IS NO MATCH FOR YOUR GOD. THE
[21:45] DEVIL'S NO MATCH FOR YOU. AMEN.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD TEACH US HOW TO LIVE BY
[21:51] THIS WORD. AMEN.
[21:53] AMEN.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; SO, we understand and let's just go
[22:01] through this very quickly and then we're
[22:02] going to get right moving. So, they
[22:05] always say you can't preach on
[22:06] Leviticus. Everybody will fall asleep.
[22:09] That's not true though, right?
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want us to see the
[22:13] sevens with God. We could have the
[22:14] Sabbath day right here if we wanted over
[22:16] here. But God actually and the
[22:18] commentators tell us that these sevens
[22:20] actually increase to a more powerful
[22:22] thing.
[22:24] Said God starts with a Sabbath, a day of
[22:26] rest, but then God would bring a schmita
[22:30] every seven years, a sabbatical year.
[22:33] But then God would actually at the end
[22:35] of seven sevenyear cycles, God would
[22:38] actually bring a jubilee.
[22:42] All these are of course very important.
[22:44] But notice uh every seven years, every
[22:46] 50 years. But notice the land use, the
[22:49] land lies follow. You can't till the
[22:51] ground in in the in the sabbatical year,
[22:53] the schmita. You you in the Jubilee,
[22:56] this is the difference. The land
[22:58] actually returns to its original owners.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; You see how it gets greater? We have a
[23:03] day of rest to rest our body, to rest in
[23:06] worshiping the Lord, right? But then God
[23:08] would ACTUALLY ALLOW THE LAND to have
[23:11] its rest. But at the end of it, he would
[23:13] not only let the land rest, but he would
[23:15] what? ALLOW IT TO GO BACK TO ITS
[23:17] ORIGINAL OWNERS.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Notice debt forgiveness.
[23:23] Yes. This is going to become in play.
[23:26] Slavery. No. Yes.
[23:29] So the jubilee was not to uh relieve
[23:33] from slavery in its purpose. Even though
[23:36] at the end of that 49th year it was
[23:39] actually a shita as well.
[23:42] The purpose is different. Now this
[23:44] stuff's deep. So uh it's just tasty.
[23:46] Brother Jess be he might be smiling a
[23:48] little bit but let How many want to
[23:50] understand the schmita a little bit?
[23:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh okay. Let's uh get on
[23:54] Amazon. Let's go buy 12 uh Jonathan Khan
[23:56] books and we'll be ready to go.
[24:00] Let's just see what the word says until
[24:01] Amazon's probably late in delivery
[24:03] anyway.
[24:07] Deuteronomy 15. Let's begin to go
[24:09] THROUGH THIS. HERE IT IS. This is the
[24:11] sabbatical year.
[24:13] THIS IS THAT SEVENTH YEAR. NOW, now look
[24:15] at what the scripture says here. Uh this
[24:17] is God's word. It says, "At the end of
[24:21] every seven years, thou shalt make a
[24:24] release."
[24:27] All right.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; So, notice I THOUGHT THE LAND WAS JUST
[24:30] RESTING.
[24:34] They were going to have to make a
[24:35] release. And this is the manner of the
[24:38] release.
[24:40] Every creditor that lendeth ought unto
[24:43] his neighbor shall release it.
[24:47] He shall not exact it of his neighbor or
[24:51] of his BROTHER BECAUSE IT IS CALLED the
[24:55] Lord's release.
[24:59] This is actually a release for the
[25:01] people.
[25:03] Now, here's the thing. What does this
[25:04] word release? Release. I got an
[25:06] underline. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT'S
[25:08] ACTUALLY MEANS SHITA.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; That word schmida
[25:13] is ACTUALLY WHAT IS CALLED the release.
[25:18] NOW WATCH WHAT. LOOK AT HOW POWERFUL
[25:20] THIS IS.
[25:22] At the end of every seven years.
[25:27] Of course, that's typing something.
[25:30] Uh, IT'S ACTUALLY TYPING SOMETHING WHERE
[25:33] WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.
[25:36] HALLELUJAH. I don't know if you know
[25:37] this, but we're at the end of the
[25:39] seventh church age. Notice, not at the
[25:42] BEGINNING OF IT, NOT AT THE MIDDLE OF
[25:44] IT, BUT IT'S RIGHT AT THE VERY END OF
[25:49] THE SEVEN-YEAR CYCLE. GOD LAID THAT IN
[25:52] HIS word
[25:55] from Sinai. AMEN. THAT WHAT? THERE WOULD
[25:58] BE A HOLY GHOST REST FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT
[26:01] IT WOULD NOT JUST BE THE LAND THAT'S AT
[26:04] REST. IT WOULD ALSO BE THAT THE PEOPLE
[26:07] WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A SCHMITA. AMEN.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; A SHMITA. THEY THEMSELVES WOULD be
[26:14] released.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW NOTICE WHAT THAT IS.
[26:20] EVERY CREDITOR THAT LENDETH OUGHT UNTO
[26:23] HIS NEIGHBOR SHALL RELEASE IT. YES, SIR.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; IT WAS TO RELEASE EVERY OUNCE OF DEBT,
[26:33] &gt;&gt; to a Hebrew,
[26:35] &gt;&gt; to a spiritual Israelite.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU SEE IT,
[26:42] BROTHER, SISTER, THAT THEREFORE
[26:46] AT THE END OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGE,
[26:49] THERE WOULD BE A RELEASE THAT WOULD
[26:52] STRIKE THE PEOPLE. AMEN.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. WHY AREN'T WE SMILING?
[26:57] &gt;&gt; WHY AREN'T WE WHY AREN'T WE UH UH EVEN
[27:00] EXPERIENCING THE SAME TYPE OF HOLY GHOST
[27:02] MOVEMENT THAT THAT ISUZA HAD
[27:06] &gt;&gt; THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM'S AGE HAD
[27:09] &gt;&gt; WITHIN THAT SESSION.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE REJOICING. THEY THEY WERE
[27:13] HALLELUJAH. GLORY. AMEN.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE AT THE END OF THE SEVEN
[27:18] CHURCH AGE, IT WOULD WHAT? IT WOULD GET
[27:20] PROGRESSIVELY HARDER.
[27:23] There'd be MORE THINGS TO ENSLAVE.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE MORE THINGS TO BRING YOU
[27:27] UNDER A DEBT. AMEN. AND WHAT? IT WOULD
[27:31] CAUSE YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BOUND TO
[27:34] SOMETHING.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Now, this is going to become pretty
[27:40] powerful. And this is how the Lord
[27:42] revealed it to me. But notice,
[27:45] we see at the end
[27:48] of the seventh or at the end of the
[27:51] Sabbath year, the end of that seventh
[27:53] church age, there would be a release.
[27:56] Not right here.
[27:59] Not right here. Right here.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; It was for right there. That's why the
[28:05] Jubilee there was no release for it.
[28:10] Because the release, now think about
[28:11] this, seven cycles of seven and then
[28:15] there's a jubilee. The jubilee would
[28:17] start the 50th year. But remember, they
[28:21] were right at THE END OF THE seventh
[28:23] year,
[28:25] which was what? THE FEAST OF TRUMPETS,
[28:30] the feast day of atonement,
[28:32] the feast of tabernacles.
[28:36] And this IS THE TIME WHERE GOD WOULD SET
[28:39] THE PEOPLE FREE FROM THEIR WHAT? THEIR
[28:41] DEBT.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE I I WANT US TO CATCH THIS
[28:45] TODAY BECAUSE SO MANY TIMES WE MISS WHAT
[28:48] THIS IS.
[28:51] WHAT WAS THAT YEAR of release?
[28:55] It was actually based on the individual.
[29:00] It's the Lord's release. But notice any
[29:04] indebt THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SOMEONE
[29:07] ELSE,
[29:12] any person WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD YOU
[29:19] &gt;&gt; TO BRING YOU UNDER THEIR OWN power to
[29:23] control you.
[29:29] Now watch how significant that is.
[29:33] It's brotherly kindness.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Watch what release means. TO SET FREE
[29:42] FROM RESTRAINT of any kind.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be in Christ
[29:50] completely free.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know if we KNOW
[29:55] THIS, BUT BUT YOU YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHO
[29:57] SHOULD ORCHESTRATE a a good portion of
[29:59] our amens and and our and our zeal and
[30:01] excitement for the Lord. It should be
[30:03] the inddwelling presence of the Holy
[30:05] Ghost.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WHAT THAT'LL MAKE
[30:08] YOU SO YOU DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
[30:10] NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; You can REJOICE UH IN CHRIST LIKE LIKE
[30:14] PAUL AND SILAS IN STOCKS AND BONDS
[30:16] SINGING WORSHIP TO GOD. AND WHAT THERE
[30:19] THEY WERE FREE. AMEN. IN STOCKS AND
[30:21] BONDS. BUT EVEN WHEN THEY DID IT, WATCH
[30:23] THE STOCKS AND BONDS WERE BROKE AND THEY
[30:26] HAD TO GO FREE. AMEN.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHAMINA IT MEANS TO SET FREE
[30:33] FROM RESTRAINT OF ANY KIND either
[30:34] physical or moral.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; That's something many times we feel like
[30:41] someone has put us under uh some sort of
[30:43] legalism or law. This is why of course
[30:46] the four organ uh organizational spirits
[30:48] come into play because you see
[30:55] pastors are meant to be led of the Holy
[30:57] Ghost.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; They are Holy Ghost leaders. But do you
[31:00] realize that in in the body of Christ
[31:02] that a pastor is not the head? There's
[31:05] only one head. It's Christ.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Now he's an overseer. So he's watching
[31:10] the sheep. He's he's doing those things.
[31:13] But who ought to be your leadership?
[31:16] &gt;&gt; WHO OUGHT TO BE THE ONE TO SET YOU FREE?
[31:18] SO THAT'S WHY NICKELISM IS SO EVIL
[31:21] BECAUSE IT GETS YOU TO depend on the
[31:24] works and MERITS OF OF A pastor
[31:27] &gt;&gt; or a PREACHER AND TO NOT BE SOLELY SOLD
[31:31] OUT TO GOD YOURSELF TO DO EVERYTHING HE
[31:33] WANTS YOU to do.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, sister, we're not
[31:38] here JUST TO SIT ON A CHAIR AND AND HEAR
[31:40] THE WORD. WE'RE HERE TO SERVE GOD. AMEN.
[31:43] TO SERVE YOUR BROTHER, TO SERVE YOUR
[31:45] SISTER. AMEN. TO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING
[31:48] WE CAN TO FORWARD THE WORK OF JESUS
[31:51] CHRIST. AMEN. IT IS A BODY WORK. AMEN.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I LIKE THIS. TO LIBERATE FROM
[31:59] PRISON.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Confinement or servitude.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that we should not be
[32:06] constrained by one devil right now? Not
[32:08] even one.
[32:10] That's why the promise was when they got
[32:12] into the land that one of you would
[32:14] chase a hundred.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; 10 of you shall chase 10,000, right?
[32:19] However many it was.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; You are actually made to absolutely
[32:25] rampage Satan's kingdom.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Who did this? Christ did this. Matthew
[32:37] 11:28.
[32:39] COME UNTO ME ALL YOU that labor and are
[32:41] heavy laden, AND I WILL GIVE you rest.
[32:43] Your pastor's going to give you rest.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; His preaching's GOING TO GIVE YOU REST.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; He's going to preach YOU THE WORD, BUT
[32:51] JUST BECAUSE HE'S PREACHING THE WORD
[32:52] DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE
[32:54] PERSON. AMEN.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THE PERSON OF JESUS
[32:58] CHRIST.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I WILL GIVE YOU REST. TAKE MY
[33:02] YOKE UPON YOU AND LEARN OF ME, FOR I am
[33:04] meek AND LOWLY IN HEART, AND YE SHALL
[33:06] FIND REST UNTO YOUR SOULS. FOR MY YOKE
[33:08] is easy and my burden is light.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; HE IS the rest.
[33:14] HE IS THE SCHMITA. AMEN. HE IS THE
[33:17] RELEASE. NO WONDER IN ISAIAH 61 HE COULD
[33:20] TALK ABOUT THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE
[33:22] LORD. AMEN.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. AMEN.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BE FREE RIGHT NOW. NOT JUST
[33:29] BECAUSE SOMEONE LAYS THEIR HANDS ON YOU,
[33:31] BUT BECAUSE YOU ACCEPT THE WORD. AMEN.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. REVEAL THAT TO ME. I'M FREE.
[33:37] I HAVE BEEN RELEASED. AMEN.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; That's why it's the unveiling of the
[33:43] schmita.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Now, this is powerful.
[33:49] We're tying in a lot of stuff, but
[33:52] notice when you go to Deuteronomy 3:19,
[33:54] this is where it's really kicked in for
[33:55] me. And Moses wrote this law and
[33:57] delivered it under the priests, the sons
[33:59] of Levi. This is the 40th year. When you
[34:00] actually look at Deuteronomy and Numbers
[34:02] and so forth, you'll actually find that
[34:04] there's a ton said about the first year
[34:05] and a ton said about the 40th year.
[34:09] There's not a lot that's said in
[34:10] between.
[34:13] Hallelujah.
[34:16] But here it is IN THE 40TH YEAR. WATCH
[34:18] THIS. AND SO GOD TELLS THEM IN MOUNT SI,
[34:21] the land's going to have a release. BUT
[34:24] WATCH THIS. AND MOSES WROTE THIS LAW and
[34:26] delivered unto the priests the sons of
[34:28] Levi which bear the ark of the covenant
[34:29] of the Lord and unto all the elders of
[34:31] Israel. And Moses commanded them,
[34:33] saying,
[34:34] "At the end of every seven years,
[34:41] &gt;&gt; the Schmidita year,
[34:44] &gt;&gt; THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HAPPEN
[34:48] &gt;&gt; IN THE SOMNITY OF the year of release,
[34:53] IN THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES,
[34:58] when all Israel is come to appear before
[35:01] THE LORD THY THY GOD IN THE PLACE WHICH
[35:03] HE SHALL CHOOSE. There's a lot there. I
[35:06] can't go into that. Thou shalt READ THIS
[35:08] LAW BEFORE ALL ISRAEL in their hearing.
[35:15] Isn't that something?
[35:17] So in the Schmidita year,
[35:20] remember, of course, they would have uh
[35:22] a weekly service and so forth, BUT THEY
[35:25] SAID WHAT WHAT MADE THIS DIFFERENT THAT
[35:27] when they actually came into that shita
[35:30] in the promised land THAT THEY WOULD
[35:32] ACTUALLY HAVE THE PRIESTS ACTUALLY BRING
[35:34] THE REVELATION OF THE entire word,
[35:39] &gt;&gt; which of course at THIS POINT IN TIME,
[35:41] HOW MANY BOOKS OF THE BIBLE WERE THERE?
[35:42] FIVE. It's called the Pentatuk.
[35:47] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[35:50] Deuteronomy.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHAT? GOD WOULD HAVE
[35:54] THIS WORD READ EVERY SEVEN YEARS.
[35:58] THE ENTIRE WORD REVEALED TO THE PEOPLE.
[36:01] CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT THIS. OH, OUR
[36:04] PREACHERS BEEN PREACHING ABOUT THIS, BUT
[36:06] LOOK, HE'S READING IT ALL. WE'RE GETTING
[36:08] THE WHOLE WORD RIGHT NOW. AMEN.
[36:14] AND THAT'S WHAT GOD DID, BROTHER,
[36:16] SISTER, WHEN GOD BROUGHT THAT SEVENTH
[36:18] ANGEL. AMEN. HE WAS SETTING UP THE SCENE
[36:22] SO THAT THE WHOLE WORD WOULD BE MADE
[36:24] KNOWN TO YOU. AMEN. SO YOU COULD BELIEVE
[36:26] IT. AMEN. YOU COULD WHAT? RECEIVE IT AND
[36:29] THEREFORE YOU WOULD BE RELEASED. AMEN.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE A RELEASE WITHOUT THE
[36:36] UNVEILING OF THE BOOK. AMEN.
[36:40] I CAN GET EXCITED about that.
[36:42] HALLELUJAH.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE RECEIVED.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, SISTER, you understand in the
[36:50] vast realm of Christendom, I would say
[36:54] that there's less. And our prophet said
[36:56] it. He said when it comes to the seventh
[36:58] angel, he said it would be 1/100th of
[37:00] 1%.
[37:02] Do you realize how important you are to
[37:06] God?
[37:07] HE LOVES YOU, BROTHER. AMEN. HE LOVES
[37:10] YOU, SISTER. AMEN. WHY? CUZ HE CHOSE YOU
[37:15] FOR THE HEARING OF THE WORD. AMEN.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; So what does he say? Thou shalt read
[37:27] this law before all Israel in their
[37:31] hearing.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; They had to hear the word. That's what
[37:37] your pastors use for the five-fold
[37:38] ministry. That's why the scripture says
[37:40] it's for the perfecting of the saints.
[37:42] Ephesians 4.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Gather the people together. Isn't this
[37:46] something?
[37:48] Because every year they'd have to do
[37:49] this three times. But when it came to
[37:52] the shmita, everyone was gathered.
[37:55] Everyone. WATCH THIS. GATHER THE PEOPLE
[37:57] TOGETHER. MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN, THY
[38:00] STRANGER, THE THE GENTILE, THAT IT'S
[38:03] WITHIN THY GATES, THAT THEY MAY HEAR AND
[38:06] THAT THEY MAY LEARN AND AND FEAR THE
[38:08] LORD YOUR GOD AND OBSERVE TO DO ALL THE
[38:11] WORDS OF THIS LAW.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; How many remember the feast? The feast
[38:20] said what? You shall gather your males
[38:22] three times a year.
[38:25] But when IT CAME TO THE UNVEILING OF THE
[38:27] WORD, EVEN A CHILD COULD HEAR IT. AMEN.
[38:30] EVEN A STRANGER COULD HEAR IT. AMEN. GOD
[38:34] WAS MAKING THE WORD AVAILABLE FOR
[38:36] EVERYBODY. AMEN.
[38:39] HALLELUJAH. And notice AND THAT THEIR
[38:41] CHILDREN WHICH HAVE NOT KNOWN ANYTHING.
[38:46] You realize Sunday school is not
[38:48] parents. You understand that Sunday
[38:49] school was not meant to teach your
[38:50] children the word and that's it. Right.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; You got to teach them, parent.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't even stop there as a
[39:02] pastor. I say, you know what? Everybody
[39:04] in this church should be what? Sewing
[39:06] the word into our children.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Why? It's our responsibility.
[39:13] It's the next generation.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
[39:20] STAY HERE AND learn to fear THE LORD
[39:22] YOUR GOD AS LONG AS YOU LIVE IN THE LAND
[39:25] WHETHER YOU GO OVER JORDAN to possess
[39:27] it.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my Oh my.
[39:32] Now I'm going to try to be quick with
[39:33] this.
[39:37] Now notice this. So in the sabbatical
[39:40] year says of a foreigner, a stranger,
[39:43] thou mayest exacted again. So the
[39:45] foreigner was not released in the
[39:47] sabbatical.
[39:49] still had to pay up.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; But that which is thine with thy
[39:54] brother. Brotherly kindness.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Thine hand shall release.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; SAY WHEN THERE SHALL BE NO POOR AMONG
[40:06] YOU. FOR THE LORD SHALL GREATLY bless
[40:08] thee in the land which the Lord thy God
[40:09] giveth thee for an inheritance to
[40:11] possess it. Hallelujah. They were called
[40:14] to BE IN THAT LAND A BLESSED PEOPLE.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; DO YOU FEEL BLESSED RIGHT NOW?
[40:19] DO YOU FEEL EXCITED ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS
[40:22] DONE FOR YOU? AMEN.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, SISTER, I'M
[40:26] WATCHING A CYCLE RIGHT NOW THAT THAT WE
[40:28] LITERALLY HAD A DEMON-POSSESSED person
[40:29] come in the church and they came and
[40:31] THEY FOCUSED RIGHT ON ME AND AND WITHIN
[40:33] WITHIN FIVE minutes that demon left that
[40:36] man shaking,
[40:38] growling.
[40:41] Then he says, "MY KNEE HURTS." HE SAID,
[40:43] "WOULD YOU PRAY FOR ME AFTER YOU GOT
[40:44] DELIVERED?" WE PRAYED FOR HIS KNEE.
[40:46] GUESS WHAT GOD DID? GOD HEALED IT.
[40:49] HE SAID, "I'VE I'VE HAD THIS MY AS LONG
[40:51] AS I CAN REMEMBER, AND GOD HEALED HIM."
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Then on a PRAYER NIGHT, HE COMES AND HE
[40:57] SAYS, HE SAYS, "MAN, I" and he's
[40:59] adopted. He was he was an adopted
[41:01] person. Had to leave his family. His dad
[41:02] was a Satanist. And and he said he said,
[41:05] "Uh, MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER." HE SAID,
[41:08] "Can you pray for my biological mother?
[41:10] Her ankle has hurt uh her whole life,
[41:13] too."
[41:16] And we prayed for him right there. It's
[41:18] just six or eight, 10 of us right there.
[41:20] And we prayed for him. He comes that
[41:22] that Thursday and he says, "Pastor, I
[41:25] got to tell you something." He said, "My
[41:28] mom called me yesterday."
[41:30] And she said, "She don't know what
[41:32] happened, but her ankle is healed."
[41:37] AND HE SAID, "SO I ASKED HER, I SAID,
[41:39] "WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?" AND SHE SAID, "IT
[41:42] WAS TUESDAY NIGHT.
[41:44] RIGHT? GOING ON DURING OUR PRAYER
[41:46] MEETING. AMEN.
[41:48] WHAT WE APPEALED TO THE GOD THAT'S AT
[41:51] THE MERCY SEAT. AND YES, IT IS TRUE. HE
[41:54] IS THE HIGH PRIEST OF OUR PROFESSION.
[41:57] AMEN.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; HE IS EVER LIVING TO MAKE INTERCESSIONS
[42:02] FOR YOU. AMEN.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; NOT FOR JUST A PREACHER, BUT FOR YOU.
[42:07] YOU ARE HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. AMEN.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's worthy.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S A GREAT GOD. AMEN. HE'S WORTHY OF
[42:21] EVERY OUNCE OF PRAISE THAT COULD EVER
[42:23] COME FROM ANY OF OUR LIPS. AMEN.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; AND THAT MUCH MORE. AMEN.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; WE OUGHT TO BE LIKE THE SARAPHIMS IN
[42:29] HEAVEN. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. AMEN. HOLY,
[42:33] HOLY, HOLY.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said he said that's how
[42:37] they live in his presence.
[42:41] Hallelujah.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Notice it's all blessing. I'm going to
[42:48] skip it for time sake.
[42:51] But now notice these were a stiff necked
[42:55] people. That's why God said, you know
[42:58] what, you won't even you probably if you
[43:00] don't love the Lord and and obey his
[43:02] word and want his word, then you won't
[43:03] even be in the land. But the land's
[43:04] going to be blessed nonetheless,
[43:06] whether you're there or not. Isn't that
[43:09] good? I I'll tell you, I want to be in
[43:11] that land. I want to live in there.
[43:13] Amen. Hallelujah. I want every waking
[43:16] moment to be bound as a prisoner of love
[43:18] to Jesus Christ.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:24] Now he even comes to the end of it and
[43:26] he says, "BEWARE THAT THERE BE NOT A
[43:28] thought in thy wicked heart, saying, the
[43:30] seventh year, the year of release is at
[43:32] hand, and thine eye be evil against thy
[43:34] poor brother, and that thou givest him
[43:36] not, and he crying unto the Lord against
[43:38] thee, and it be a sin unto thee." God
[43:40] already had to come against their
[43:41] thoughts. Because notice
[43:46] there would be people who are so
[43:47] attached to their worldly goods, so
[43:49] attached and loving money,
[43:52] loving their possessions,
[43:54] that when someone came for a need and it
[43:56] was the seventh year, they're like,
[43:57] "Well, I I won't even have a chance to
[43:59] get this back."
[44:01] So, they would cut them off.
[44:04] They just sit there and let them suffer.
[44:07] And God said that'd be a sin unto you.
[44:12] But he said, "And if thy brother, a
[44:14] Hebrew man," or so much here, I I can't
[44:15] go through it, but it says, "Or a Hebrew
[44:17] woman be sold unto thee and serve thee
[44:19] six years, then in the seventh year thou
[44:22] shalt let him go free from thee. And
[44:24] when thou sendest him out free from
[44:25] thee, thou shalt not let him go away
[44:28] empty."
[44:32] WE OUGHT TO GIVE AND LOVE. YES SIR.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; This is brother.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; We ought to do good to them.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; When thou sendest THEM OUT FREE FROM
[44:45] THEE, THOU SHALT NOT GO away empty. Thou
[44:46] shalt furn libery out of thy flock, out
[44:48] of thy floor, and out of thy wine press,
[44:50] out of out there wherewith the Lord thy
[44:52] God have bless bless thee, thou shalt
[44:54] give unto him.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; It was all based
[45:00] this sabbatical year. Their release was
[45:04] based on them releasing everyone else.
[45:09] And beforehand, they would have to what?
[45:13] They would have to still love their
[45:15] brother or sister enough to help.
[45:18] When's the last time you helped
[45:19] somebody?
[45:22] When was the last time you went out of
[45:23] your way and sacrificed your time,
[45:25] sacrificed your life
[45:28] to do something for someone and then
[45:30] fulfilled Jesus's words, hoping not to
[45:33] receive again?
[45:37] &gt;&gt; That the Lord would bless you richly.
[45:42] There's a lot here because you see, it's
[45:44] not just a physical thing, but it's
[45:46] spiritual.
[45:48] Notice Jesus brings this down. I'm going
[45:50] try to be quick here. It says, "There
[45:51] For the kingdom of heaven likened. Now
[45:53] he's talking about forgiveness. Seven
[45:55] times 70, right? He says, "Likeen under
[45:58] certain king which would take account of
[45:59] his servants." When he had begun to
[46:01] reckon, one was brought unto him which
[46:03] owed him 10,000 talents. But for as much
[46:06] as he had not to pay, his lord commanded
[46:08] him to be sold and his wife, his
[46:11] children, and all that he had and
[46:12] payment to be made.
[46:15] Isn't this something?
[46:16] This is right in the word all the way
[46:18] through.
[46:20] THE SERVANT THEREFORE FELL DOWN and
[46:21] worshiped him. Who was the rest? Who is
[46:24] the release?
[46:26] And worship, SAYING, LORD, HAVE patience
[46:29] with me and I will pay thee all. Then
[46:31] the Lord of the that servant was moved
[46:33] with compassion and loosed him and
[46:35] forgave him the debt.
[46:38] HALLELUJAH. HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. HOW
[46:40] MANY TIMES CAN YOU FORGIVE SOMEONE? And
[46:43] he brings it down to a financial
[46:45] indictment,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; being bound to bound to them because uh
[46:50] they owe me.
[46:52] They said this to me. I'm mad at them
[46:54] and I'm going to hold them accountable.
[46:57] Sit there and just have attitudes.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; You hold that person in debt to you
[47:04] because they didn't treat you like you
[47:06] thought they should have.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; I gave them love and they had nothing
[47:11] but evil to give me back.
[47:15] It's going to get quiet. It better get
[47:17] quiet because that's how Satan
[47:19] constantly fights us. The biggest
[47:22] obstacle
[47:24] with the presence of God being here and
[47:25] not being here is being in one accord in
[47:29] one place.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was made to join us.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; It it was made to to give us so much
[47:39] forgiveness to others.
[47:44] Because don't you understand if you hold
[47:46] someone else under that debt
[47:49] that debt will hold you as well.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; So nobody could be released if it went
[47:56] wrong. But look, this king would FORGIVE
[48:00] A MAN THAT OWED HIM everything
[48:04] &gt;&gt; when the law required that he would have
[48:06] to be taken completely into servitude.
[48:12] He loosed him, FORGAVE HIS DEBT. BUT THE
[48:14] SAME SERVANT WENT OUT AND FOUND ONE OF
[48:16] HIS FELLOW SERVANTS WHICH owed him a
[48:17] hundred pence. Oh my. He laid hands on
[48:20] him AND HE TOOK HIM BY THE THROAT
[48:22] SAYING, "PAY ME WHAT? Pay me that thou
[48:24] owest."
[48:26] Oh my. Brother, sister, we owe a great
[48:29] debt to our Lord.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; We owe so much debt to the Lord for what
[48:35] he's done for us. Even though he's
[48:37] loosed us, we should never ever be uh uh
[48:42] uh uh be uh uh to a place that we put
[48:46] someone under the debt that we ought to
[48:47] be under ourselves.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why of course when the
[48:51] word of God it says that he'll only
[48:52] forgive you as you forgive others.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; That's what this is. Watch this. HE TOOK
[49:00] HIM BY THE THROAT. PAY ME THAT THOU
[49:02] OWEST.
[49:05] AND HIS FELLOW servant fell down to his
[49:06] feet, besought him, saying, "Have
[49:08] patience with me, and I will pay thee
[49:09] all." And he would not, but went and
[49:12] cast him into prison till he should pay
[49:14] the debt. Oh my. SO WHEN HIS FELLOW
[49:17] SERVANTS SAW WHAT WAS DONE, THEY WERE
[49:20] very sorry, and came and told unto their
[49:22] lord all that was done. Then his lord
[49:25] after that he had called him said unto
[49:26] him, "Oh, thou wicked servant, I forgave
[49:28] thee all that debt because thou desires
[49:32] me.
[49:34] Shouldest not thou also have had
[49:36] compassion on thy fellow servant, even
[49:38] as I had pity on thee? WE GOT NO RIGHT
[49:41] FOR A GRUDGE. WE GOT NO RIGHT FOR A
[49:44] HATRED OR AN UNFORGIVENESS TOWARDS
[49:46] ANYBODY, EVEN IF THEY'VE WRONGED US.
[49:48] THINK ABOUT IT. NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAYS
[49:50] IN EPHESIANS 6, IT SAYS WE WRESTLE NOT
[49:53] AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. AMEN.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. IT'S THE DEMON
[49:58] ON THE INDIVIDUAL. BUT THAT SHOULD NEVER
[50:01] MAKE YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT
[50:03] PERSON. AMEN.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST BOUND AND INDEBTED TO A
[50:07] SPIRIT THAT THEY GIVEN OVER TO. AMEN.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; That's why they find some of the
[50:14] greatest cases of deliverance are with
[50:16] some of the worst. And it just would be
[50:18] that someone was praying for them,
[50:20] someone was loving them, and someone was
[50:22] going to a place where it would have
[50:24] looked like they were just setting
[50:25] themselves up for defraud.
[50:30] Oh, I want souls. I want the church to
[50:32] be full. Oh, we do.
[50:35] Hallelujah. One of the greatest
[50:36] testimonies I ever heard was was a a a
[50:39] nominal Christian pastor in California
[50:41] and and he took in Anton Levy's
[50:43] daughter,
[50:46] the writer of the Satanic Bible.
[50:49] And they took her in. She was completely
[50:51] demonpossessed, doing all sorts of crazy
[50:52] stuff. He said, he said, "All they did
[50:54] was pray and fast and trusted that God
[50:56] would keep them alive.
[50:58] And then finally one night after I was
[51:00] like six or nine months, six or nine
[51:02] months
[51:04] she had a breakthrough
[51:10] and then according to what it what
[51:12] happened according to the testimony
[51:15] Antony showed up
[51:18] doing out of body is what was it?
[51:19] transcendentalism or whatever it is. And
[51:21] he came out of body and came and said he
[51:23] was going to kill her and he was going
[51:25] to take her and go do those things. And
[51:27] he said they started praying and fasting
[51:29] again, getting very serious about it.
[51:32] And then the next thing they heard, they
[51:34] found out that Anton Levy died.
[51:38] And according to the testimony, he was
[51:40] actually doing the outof body experience
[51:43] to come and do those things when the
[51:46] prayer and the fasting broke it. And he
[51:48] actually died in that out-of- body
[51:51] experience.
[51:54] Brother, sister, what kind of people are
[51:56] we?
[51:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. WHEN THAT MAN
[51:59] CAME IN DEMONPOSSESSED, I JUST WAITED
[52:01] RIGHT THERE AND IT SLIPPED INTO A
[52:02] DIFFERENT GEAR. BROTHER RAM SAID,
[52:05] "THAT'S WHAT WE DO. YOU just slip into a
[52:07] different gear."
[52:08] &gt;&gt; You speak with tongues, you're slipping
[52:10] INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR. YOU HAVE A A WORD
[52:12] OF PROPHECY, A WORD OF WISDOM, A WORD OF
[52:14] KNOWLEDGE. AMEN. INTERPRETATION OF
[52:16] TONGUES, YOU'RE SLIPPING INTO A
[52:17] DIFFERENT GEAR. AMEN. YOU'RE JUST
[52:19] YIELDING to the Lord. Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT TO MAKE YOU
[52:25] SCARED. AMEN. BECAUSE THAT SHOWS THAT
[52:27] WITH THIS WORD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[52:30] AND SATAN, WHAT? HE CAN DO A thing to
[52:33] the believer.
[52:44] and his lord was wroth and delivered him
[52:46] to the tormentors that till he should
[52:47] pay all that was due unto him. So
[52:50] likewise shall my heavenly father do
[52:53] also unto you if ye from your hearts
[52:55] forgive not everyone his brother their
[52:58] trespasses.
[53:02] You see how it's not the natural line.
[53:04] It's the spiritual line.
[53:08] When you won't forgive, it's likened to
[53:11] only a great debt.
[53:14] Now, watch this because when was that
[53:18] sbatical? It was at the end of the
[53:21] seventh year.
[53:23] Isn't that something? If we continue to
[53:25] read, the next thing that comes up
[53:27] working with the sabbatical year
[53:30] is the mark of the beast.
[53:33] Watch this. And thou shalt remember that
[53:35] thou was a bondman in the land of Egypt,
[53:37] and the Lord thy God redeemed thee.
[53:39] Hallelujah. Therefore, I command thee
[53:41] this day, this thing today, and it shall
[53:44] be, if he say unto you, the man THAT WAS
[53:46] IN WHAT? IN DEBT, IN SERVITUDE, in
[53:49] enslavement, a brother,
[53:53] if he say unto thee, I will not go away
[53:55] from thee, because he loveth thee in
[53:57] thine house, because he is well with
[54:00] thee,
[54:02] then thou shalt take an all, and thrust
[54:04] it through his ear unto the door, and he
[54:07] shall be thy servant forever, and also
[54:10] unto thy maidservant thou shalt do
[54:12] likewise."
[54:16] They took him up.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Watch this. It shall not seem harden
[54:23] unto thee when thou sendest him away
[54:25] free from thee, for he hath been worth a
[54:27] double-hired servant to thee, and
[54:29] serving thee for six years. And the the
[54:31] Lord thy God shall bless thee in all
[54:33] that thou doest.
[54:35] THEY HAD A CHOICE AT THE END OF THE
[54:37] SEVENTH year
[54:40] &gt;&gt; to take the all
[54:43] because they were happy being NOTICED
[54:46] ENSLAVED to an individual.
[54:49] No wonder you have the white horse
[54:51] rider, the red horse rider, the black
[54:54] horse rider and then the pale.
[55:00] Only the free are going out.
[55:03] Only those who have the release that
[55:05] have moved into a brotherly kindness.
[55:09] No wonder when brother Brandham went
[55:10] beyond the curtain of time, he said he
[55:12] said only divine love will be there.
[55:17] You ain't got nothing against nobody.
[55:20] And if anything, if someone's wronged
[55:22] you, you're praying for them.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You're trying to do something. God help
[55:25] us. Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Look what our prophet said. Now watch
[55:30] this mark of the beast. Now, but I want
[55:33] to tell you now there come a time that
[55:34] was called uh every seventh year. That
[55:37] was six years on the seventh year. Uh
[55:40] Bible students, ministers, things
[55:41] sitting around here know this to be
[55:42] true. Uh it was called the seventh year
[55:44] was uh called the Jubilee year. Uh
[55:47] everything rested. We know that was the
[55:48] 50th, but that's okay. It says
[55:50] everything rested. There's no crops
[55:52] planted on the seventh year. The land
[55:54] rested. Everything they just glean seed.
[55:56] Everything rested on the seventh year.
[55:58] And on the seventh year, there was a
[55:59] priest that sounded a trumpet. And if a
[56:01] if a man had been a slave, I don't care
[56:03] what his debts was, he was free. Now,
[56:04] watch what the prophet says. Now, that's
[56:06] a type of the gospel trumpet.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; You might have served the devil all
[56:12] these years IN CHAINS WITH DRINKING,
[56:15] SMOKING, GAMBLING, and sin, dirty
[56:17] things, no matter what you've done. BUT
[56:19] WHEN YOU HEAR the gospel trumpet sound,
[56:22] IT'S A SIGN THAT YOU can go free.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO. FAITH COMETH BY HEARING,
[56:29] HEARING OF THE THE WORD OF GOD. NOW
[56:31] YOU'VE HEARD THE FULL GOSPEL. YOU DON'T
[56:33] HAVE TO STAY BOUND ANY LONGER.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, IF YOU JUST SAY, "OH, I LISTENED TO
[56:42] IT, BUT I DIDN'T hear it." See? All
[56:44] right. Then it ain't for you. It's for
[56:47] those who hear it. If you can hear it.
[56:49] Amen. BROTHER, SISTER, WE OUGHT TO BE AT
[56:52] A RELEASE POINT RIGHT NOW. AMEN.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO THINK ABOUT. JUST TAKE A
[56:57] SECOND, THINK ABOUT UH UH UM WHO DO YOU
[57:00] HAVE AN ATTITUDE AGAINST SOMEBODY? DID
[57:01] SOMEBODY WRONG YOU AND YOU'RE HOLDING ON
[57:03] TO IT?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ARE ARE YOU STILL MAD ABOUT
[57:06] A SITUATION OR ABOUT A PERSON OR OR DOES
[57:09] SOMEONE OWE YOU MONEY OR OWE YOU RESPECT
[57:11] OR OWE YOU SOMETHING? WE DON'T HEY,
[57:13] NOBODY OWES US ANYTHING. AMEN. BECAUSE
[57:15] THERE WAS A GOD WHO GAVE US EVERYTHING.
[57:17] AMEN.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But look at that. End of the
[57:22] seventh year and then we see the mark of
[57:23] the beast slipping right in.
[57:25] for seal. Now remember with that uh
[57:27] let's go ahead if you will. Uh he says
[57:28] uh with no bad feelings towards any
[57:30] people in any organization. No bad
[57:33] feelings
[57:36] because God has got children in the
[57:38] Catholic system. He's got children oh
[57:40] that's not right. That's not right. Let
[57:41] me cover that.
[57:44] That's right.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; He's got children in the Methodist
[57:47] system. He's got children in the Baptist
[57:49] system. How many of those all them
[57:50] different systems is represented here
[57:51] tonight that come out of it when you've
[57:53] seen light. Let's see your hand. Now
[57:55] remember, there's people out there just
[57:57] like you, but it's the system that
[57:59] kills.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; See, it's the Antichrist spirit that
[58:02] finally gets them to a place till they
[58:04] won't hear no truth.
[58:08] The wait, what was the truth? Remember,
[58:11] the whole word had to be given
[58:14] and they had to release. They had to
[58:17] fully move into brotherly kindness.
[58:22] Hallelujah.
[58:24] Now you remember the other night when I
[58:26] went through the ceiling, if a man heard
[58:28] the Jubilee call, he refused to go free.
[58:31] He was taken to the post and all and all
[58:33] marked his ear. Ear is where you hear
[58:37] AND FAITH COMETH BY HEARING. NOTICE
[58:40] THEY'LL NEVER HAVE FAITH.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; THEN if he hears AND REFUSE TO ACCEPT
[58:45] his freedom, then he has to serve his
[58:48] denominational master the REST OF HIS
[58:50] LIFE. AMEN. OH MY, ISN'T HE WONDERFUL.
[58:54] HALLELUJAH. I'm going to say it. WHETHER
[58:56] IT OFFENDS YOU OR NOT, I DON'T CARE. BUT
[58:57] BROTHER, SISTER, DENOMINATIONALISM has
[58:59] crept in this message.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A FAITH THAT GOD IS
[59:04] WANTING FROM YOU ACCORDING TO HIS WORD.
[59:07] NO WONDER IN HEBREWS HE SAID, HE SAID,
[59:08] "WITHOUT FAITH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
[59:10] PLEASE GOD." AMEN.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, we got to move real quick.
[59:16] Only been an hour.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I usually hold you two, so I'm
[59:20] doing good pace right now.
[59:22] Jeremiah 34:8.
[59:25] This is actually the only time you see
[59:26] anyone doing this in the Bible that I
[59:28] see outside of Christ.
[59:30] In Jeremiah 34:8, notice what happened.
[59:34] The people actually started looking into
[59:35] the Shimita. And of course, they're
[59:37] they're going to have to what?
[59:39] After that, King Zedekiah has made a
[59:41] covenant with all the people which are
[59:43] at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto
[59:45] them.
[59:47] Think about it. They're not under a
[59:48] prophet administration right now.
[59:50] They've moved into a kingdom, a king
[59:52] ministry.
[59:54] Well, what's a king got?
[59:56] Servants.
[1:00:00] No wonder when Samuel said, he said,
[1:00:02] "You get a king, he'll make your sons
[1:00:04] and daughters,
[1:00:06] his maidervants, mans."
[1:00:10] So, finally, it looks like finally
[1:00:11] somebody's going to do this, right?
[1:00:14] Oh my. Look at this. This is all about
[1:00:17] how you treat one another.
[1:00:21] that every man should let his man
[1:00:22] servant his uh and every man his maid
[1:00:24] servant being a Hebrew or Hebrews uh go
[1:00:27] free that none should serve himself of
[1:00:29] them to wit of a of a Jew his brother.
[1:00:32] Now when all the princes all the people
[1:00:33] which had entered into the covenant
[1:00:35] heard that everyone uh should let his
[1:00:37] manservant everyone his maid servant go
[1:00:39] free that none should serve themselves
[1:00:41] of them anymore then they obeyed and let
[1:00:44] them go. Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING THE WORD OUT.
[1:00:51] OH, THAT OH, not that word. But there's
[1:00:55] always a
[1:00:58] But afterward they turned and caused the
[1:01:00] servants and the handmmaids whom they
[1:01:02] had let go free to return and brought
[1:01:04] them into subjection for servants and
[1:01:06] the handmmaids.
[1:01:10] See what it was? SEE HOW MAN LOVES TO
[1:01:13] CONTROL.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; EVEN WITH GOD'S WORD, THEY'LL LET THEM
[1:01:20] GO FOR a season, but they always want to
[1:01:22] control.
[1:01:24] Watch the political system that moves in
[1:01:26] this message.
[1:01:28] It's always a hierarchy. It's always a
[1:01:30] what? It's always trying to bring things
[1:01:33] under what?
[1:01:36] Control.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; So, brother Cam, if it was working
[1:01:39] right, what would we see? I mean, how do
[1:01:41] you prove that? Well, what what should
[1:01:42] it be right now? Should it be that that
[1:01:44] that pastors control the entire message
[1:01:48] and and that pastors preach all the big
[1:01:50] meetings?
[1:01:54] Wait, wait. I thought a pastor was a
[1:01:55] shepherd. A pastor supposed to be at
[1:01:56] home taking care of a sheep. He smells.
[1:01:59] Let's leave him at home.
[1:02:01] Smells like sheep.
[1:02:09] That's for the ministry.
[1:02:12] I'm not saying that a pastor can never
[1:02:13] walk out because that's not for me to
[1:02:14] judge. But I know what the position is.
[1:02:18] So, you ought to be super ecstatic when
[1:02:22] God gives you a pastor that loves you
[1:02:24] like that. He'll stay home with you.
[1:02:27] Well, how could he? How sweet you all
[1:02:28] are.
[1:02:30] Just a just a big bunch of divine love
[1:02:33] brotherly kindness believers just
[1:02:35] constantly reaching out, releasing. I
[1:02:37] release you, brother. I release you,
[1:02:39] brother. I'LL RELEASE YOU TOO, BIG GUY.
[1:02:41] You're doing good. You're doing real
[1:02:43] good.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Be free.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; You're a great Christian. AMEN. YOU'RE
[1:02:50] SERVING THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. IS THERE
[1:02:52] ANYTHING I CAN DO? OH, YOU LOOK SAD. Let
[1:02:54] me encourage you. What's got you what's
[1:02:57] got you in debt today?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; There's a release today.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know if YOU KNOW THIS. IT'S
[1:03:04] THE END OF THE SEVEN CHURCH DAYS.
[1:03:05] There's a release going on right now.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE WHOLE WORD'S BEEN
[1:03:09] GIVEN. WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IT. IT'S
[1:03:11] STARTING TO MAKE SENSE. IT'S STARTING TO
[1:03:13] SHOW US WHO WE ARE. AMEN.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE ONE. WE'RE DISCERNING
[1:03:17] THE TWO SPIRITS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
[1:03:19] CHURCH. AMEN. AND WITHSTANDING THE
[1:03:21] ANTICHRIST SPIRIT, WE ARE ACTUALLY AN
[1:03:24] INVINCIBLE ARMY. AMEN.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; AN ARMY.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; FIGHTERS.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL COMES AND YOU ARE AN
[1:03:31] INVINCIBLE FIGHTER. AMEN.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:37] But notice
[1:03:39] the issue. They wouldn't let him go
[1:03:42] free.
[1:03:44] They started to adhere to the word, but
[1:03:47] instead they took the people right back
[1:03:49] to the slavery. Do you realize this is
[1:03:50] what caused Babylon to take over?
[1:03:54] So he brought it right back to the law
[1:03:56] and he says what? And you were now
[1:03:59] turned. I got one more place I got to
[1:04:00] go. It's pretty important.
[1:04:03] and you were now turned and had done
[1:04:04] right in my sight in proclaiming liberty
[1:04:06] every man to his neighbor.
[1:04:10] That's how they treated the people.
[1:04:13] And you had made a covenant before me in
[1:04:15] the house which is called by my name.
[1:04:17] But ye turned and polluted my name and
[1:04:19] caused every man a servant, every man
[1:04:20] his handmade, whom you had set at
[1:04:22] liberty to their pleasure at their
[1:04:24] pleasure to return and brought them into
[1:04:25] subjugation subjection, excuse me, to be
[1:04:28] unto you for servants and for
[1:04:29] handmmaids. Therefore, thus sayaith the
[1:04:31] Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me in
[1:04:34] proclaiming liberty uh everyone to his
[1:04:37] brother, every man, to his neighbor.
[1:04:38] Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,
[1:04:40] sayeth the Lord, to the sword, to the to
[1:04:43] the pestilence, and to the famine, and I
[1:04:45] will make you to be removed into all the
[1:04:47] kingdoms of the earth.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; So, notice, it wasn't just the land
[1:04:52] having a rest.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; You had to let everyone go free.
[1:04:58] Amen.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Of course, Gil goes into this and he
[1:05:04] says, he said, "This law, as it seems,
[1:05:06] had been long neglected,
[1:05:08] and servants had been retained in
[1:05:09] bondage beyond their due time
[1:05:15] through the oppression and covetousness
[1:05:16] of their masters, and the neglect of the
[1:05:18] civil magistrates, who should have took
[1:05:21] care that such a law was put in
[1:05:23] execution, and that servants were not
[1:05:25] oppressed."
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:28] That's right.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You hardly ever see it. Now, my last
[1:05:33] spot,
[1:05:38] the word release. So, in Schmidita, it's
[1:05:42] actually only mentioned uh I believe
[1:05:43] it's five or six times. Uh all of them
[1:05:45] are right here except there's one in in
[1:05:47] Esther when uh the king chooses Esther.
[1:05:52] But the word
[1:05:54] release is actually used 18 times in the
[1:05:57] scripture, but it's actually only used
[1:05:59] specifically in two places.
[1:06:03] This is powerful. I hope you can catch
[1:06:04] this. Hold on. And I know I got you at
[1:06:06] an hour. Hold on. We We need a
[1:06:09] Pentecostal moment. Hallelujah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:14] NOT IT'S NOT JUST MY Pentecostal moment,
[1:06:16] brother, sister. IT'S YOURS.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:21] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; OH, I got smiles now. Look at that.
[1:06:29] That's all you had to do.
[1:06:31] Now, remember, you can literally get in
[1:06:33] this message and you can find that Satan
[1:06:35] will, Brother Ram says, Satan will try
[1:06:37] to make you fall asleep in church. He
[1:06:38] wants you tired in church.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. how he wants you tired when
[1:06:46] you're praying.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; It's a lie, brother, sister.
[1:06:51] He's a liar and the father thereof.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; But this word release is actually only
[1:06:58] used outside of the sabbatical year, the
[1:07:02] once in Esther. It's only used in one
[1:07:04] other application.
[1:07:07] Are you ready?
[1:07:09] Are you ready?
[1:07:16] Oh, you knew it was going to come to
[1:07:18] Jesus, didn't you? You knew it was.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Glory. WATCH THIS. JOHN 18:37. OH, WE'RE
[1:07:27] coming right down to the
[1:07:31] crucifixion.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; PILATE THEREFORE SAID UNTO HIM, "ART
[1:07:35] thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou
[1:07:38] sayest that I am a king. TO THIS END WAS
[1:07:41] I BORN, AND FOR THIS CAUSE CAME I INTO
[1:07:43] THE WORLD, THAT I SHOULD BEAR witness
[1:07:45] unto the truth.
[1:07:48] Everyone that is OF THE TRUTH HEARETH MY
[1:07:50] VOICE.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING THE WORD TODAY? ARE YOU
[1:07:53] CATCHING THIS? PILOT SAITH TO HIM, "WHAT
[1:07:56] IS TRUTH?" OH, THIS IS THE GREATEST
[1:07:59] OPPORTUNITY EVER HAD. THINK ABOUT IT. HE
[1:08:02] COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED RIGHT HERE.
[1:08:04] UH-HUH.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And when he had said this, he went out
[1:08:09] again unto the Jews, and saith TO THEM,
[1:08:11] I FIND NO FAULT, find in HIM NO FAULT AT
[1:08:15] ALL.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:08:19] But ye have a custom.
[1:08:23] What is this? This is Passover.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT IN THE BIBLE,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:08:33] This Jewish custom IS NOT EVEN IN THE
[1:08:36] BIBLE.
[1:08:39] What is the custom that I should release
[1:08:45] unto you one at the Passover?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; THEY SET UP THEIR OWN tradition
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; that was not ACCORDING TO THE SABBATICAL
[1:09:00] YEAR.
[1:09:03] FOR A RELEASE OF ONE person
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; a release
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; that I should release unto you one at
[1:09:18] the Passover.
[1:09:20] Will ye therefore that I release unto
[1:09:22] you THE KING OF THE JEWS?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WOULD YOU WANT ME TO
[1:09:33] SHEAMITA,
[1:09:36] the king of the Jews?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YES, SIR.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; THE VERY GOD WHO GAVE THEM THE LAW. THE
[1:09:47] VERY GOD WHO WAS THE LAW. THE VERY GOD
[1:09:52] WHO GAVE THEM THE RELEASE. AMEN.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; They were moved to set up their own
[1:10:00] custom
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; to release someone at the Passover.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Then cried they all saying, "Not this
[1:10:14] man, BUT BARABUS." NOW BARABBUS WAS A
[1:10:17] ROBBER.
[1:10:19] Instead of releasing Jesus Christ,
[1:10:24] they released the robber.
[1:10:27] But don't miss this.
[1:10:32] John 19, next chapter, they what they're
[1:10:35] going to crucify him. Now, let's go down
[1:10:36] to the 10th verse. Says, "Then sayeth
[1:10:38] Pilot unto him, Speakst thou not unto
[1:10:40] me? Knowest not thou not that I have
[1:10:42] power to crucify thee, and have power to
[1:10:44] RELEASE THEE?"
[1:10:46] PILOT SAID, "I GOT POWER TO RELEASE
[1:10:49] YOU."
[1:10:51] BUT WHAT THE BIBLE SAID THAT IT WAS THE
[1:10:53] LORD'S RELEASE.
[1:10:57] Notice what he says. Jesus answered,
[1:10:59] "Thou couldest have no power at all
[1:11:01] against me.
[1:11:03] EXCEPT IT WERE GIVEN THEE FROM ABOVE."
[1:11:08] THEREFORE HE HE THAT delivered me unto
[1:11:11] thee hath the greater sin.
[1:11:14] And from then forth PILATE SOUGHT TO
[1:11:17] release him.
[1:11:19] BUT THE JEWS CRIED OUT, SAYING, "IF THOU
[1:11:22] LET THIS MAN GO, THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S
[1:11:24] FRIEND. WHOSOEVER maketh himself a king
[1:11:27] speaketh against Caesar." And they
[1:11:30] crucified him.
[1:11:34] But what was this? What was really going
[1:11:37] on here?
[1:11:40] Let's say it like this.
[1:11:43] Under the law, they had a release.
[1:11:47] God gave them a release. As long as they
[1:11:49] were in the land, as long as they loved
[1:11:50] him,
[1:11:53] it was a conditional release. That's why
[1:11:56] you hardly ever see it.
[1:12:03] THEY WEREN'T DOING IT RIGHT HERE. THEY
[1:12:05] WERE CAPTIVES IN THEIR OWN LAND.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; But notice,
[1:12:14] could Jesus really have been released?
[1:12:24] You see, he couldn't be released
[1:12:28] if you were actually to be spiritually
[1:12:30] released.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO PAY THE PRICE TO GET you into
[1:12:40] the land.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO PAY THE PRICE to get you
[1:12:46] released.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. HE WAS THE
[1:12:49] ONLY ONE WHO COULD SET YOU FREE.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD PARDON
[1:12:57] YOU.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO HE HIMSELF, EVEN
[1:13:03] ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, THERE'S HARDLY
[1:13:05] THERE'S NOTHING THERE OUTSIDE OF THESE.
[1:13:08] YEAH,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; he came and when it was time for them to
[1:13:13] let him go, remember, no wonder Kaiaphas
[1:13:16] prophesied that one man would have to
[1:13:18] die for the nation.
[1:13:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:24] PILATE THOUGHT HE HAD POWER TO RELEASE
[1:13:26] HIM, BUT HE WAS bound by the
[1:13:29] denomination.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; The Jewish denomination bound him.
[1:13:32] That's why they were saying, "Whosoever
[1:13:33] maketh himself a king speaketh against
[1:13:35] Caesar." They said, "Crucify him.
[1:13:38] That's something Rome was bound to a
[1:13:39] denominational spirit.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. HE HAD TO WHAT? He had
[1:13:50] to be destroyed here.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He had to be made sin so that you could
[1:13:55] be made the righteousness of God.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Because the rest was not a natural land.
[1:14:00] The rest was a spiritual land.
[1:14:06] Glory. Remember, BROTHER BRANDHAM TOLD
[1:14:08] THE STORY ABOUT ABOUT THAT SOLDIER WHO
[1:14:10] ABANDONED everything and in the in the
[1:14:13] civil war
[1:14:15] and they went and they they tried to
[1:14:17] intervene for him and Abraham Lincoln
[1:14:20] said uh with tears and eyes pulled a
[1:14:22] piece of paper from his brief and he
[1:14:23] wrote on THERE, "I ABRAHAM LEAN pardon
[1:14:25] this man of such uh and shall not die
[1:14:28] and sign his name to it." And the man
[1:14:29] gave him God's blessings and returned
[1:14:32] back to prison and said to HIS FRIEND,
[1:14:33] "I HAVE YOUR PARDON."
[1:14:37] He pulled it out UPON A PIECE OF PAPER
[1:14:39] AND SHOW HIM. AND THE MAN SAID, "DON'T
[1:14:40] MOCK me here. I'm fixing to die." What?
[1:14:44] What did he do? He shut his ear.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; HE SHUT HIS EAR TO THE PARDON.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; HE SHUT HIS EAR TO THE RELEASE.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; HERE. I'M FIXING TO DIE AND THEN COME
[1:14:58] WITH SUCH AS THAT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT.
[1:15:00] I just can't believe it. Isn't so any
[1:15:02] man could sign his name. Abraham
[1:15:03] Lincoln. He said, "But this is the
[1:15:05] president's signature." Said, "You are
[1:15:07] pardoned." And he turned his back and
[1:15:08] walked away. And the man died under a
[1:15:10] firing squad. And then here is a release
[1:15:13] from Abraham Lincoln,
[1:15:17] THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO
[1:15:18] RELEASE this man. And yet they shot him.
[1:15:21] SO IT WAS TRIED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS.
[1:15:23] AND HERE was a decision. A PARDON IS NOT
[1:15:26] A PARDON UNLESS IT BE ACCEPTED as a
[1:15:29] pardon.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you released? ARE YOU
[1:15:34] FREE,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; SIR?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU LET IT GO? AMEN. CAN CAN YOU LET
[1:15:39] IT GO SO MUCH AND YOU SAY, "IT'S AT THE
[1:15:41] END OF THE SEVENTH YEAR. WE'RE IN the
[1:15:42] seventh church age. I want to do
[1:15:43] everything I can to help other people."
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; WELL, I MIGHT NOT GET ANYTHING BACK. NO,
[1:15:48] I'M GOING TO DO IT. AMEN. BECAUSE MY GOD
[1:15:51] IS WHAT? ABUNDANTLY BLESSED ME IN ALL
[1:15:53] THINGS. AMEN.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; So this TONIGHT THAT I READ THAT GOD
[1:15:58] GIVES US ALL THINGS. HE GIVES US A A
[1:16:00] PARDON. IT'S A PARDON to those who want
[1:16:02] to accept God's word as pardon.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; BUT IT ONLY JUST US read it. It doesn't
[1:16:07] mean that you are pardoned. It means
[1:16:09] that you've got to accept it as your
[1:16:10] pardon. That God gave his son to die in
[1:16:13] yourstead. He wasn't released.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be to take your place.
[1:16:20] RELEASED FROM WHAT? RELEASED. WHAT ARE
[1:16:23] YOU RELEASED FROM? From guilt.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say this and I might
[1:16:32] even go this way tonight.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is filthy rags.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; We fail all the time.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; All the time,
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; right, brother?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; No. No. Not not righteous me.
[1:16:53] Oh yeah, we do.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; All All I got to do is line up your your
[1:16:59] Bible time and your prayer time with
[1:17:00] your cell phone.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Ding ding match over.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, that's just Bible and
[1:17:10] message and Oh, I Yeah, sure it is. Sure
[1:17:13] it is. Okay. Um settings, uh general um
[1:17:18] screen time. Okay.
[1:17:22] Oh my.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; We don't want to stay there too long.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; A PARDON FROM GOD is a release from
[1:17:31] guilt.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Not the turning AWAY BY A PSYCHOLOGICAL
[1:17:36] DOCTRINE.
[1:17:38] Jesus is real. THIS IS NOT
[1:17:40] PSYCHOLOGICAL.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING to play something
[1:17:42] with YOU HERE. A PSYCHOLOGICAL DOCTRINE
[1:17:44] OF SOME SORT THAT MIGHT IN SOME WAY GIVE
[1:17:46] you a little feeling that you have done
[1:17:48] what's right by joining church or taking
[1:17:51] UP SOME CREED BUT IT'S A release from
[1:17:54] your GUILT BY THE POWER OF CALVARY
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAS RELEASED YOU
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE GUILT SAYS I BELIEVE IN
[1:18:05] ROMANS 5:1 THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO
[1:18:08] CONDEMNATION OF THEM THAT ARE IN CHRIST
[1:18:10] JESUS THAT WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH BUT
[1:18:13] AFTER THE SPIRIT. AMEN.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Brother, SISTER, WE ARE NOT BOUND BY
[1:18:21] GUILT.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A
[1:18:28] POWERFUL TYPE THAT SHOWS AT THE END OF
[1:18:31] THE SEVENTH YEAR, THE WORD WOULD BE
[1:18:33] RELEASED. AMEN.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; AND YOU COULD ACCEPT THAT PARDON. AMEN.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Think about what that is.
[1:18:43] There's now no condemnation to them that
[1:18:47] are in Christ Jesus.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; How far does that go with you? If I have
[1:18:51] a good day or I had a good day, I feel
[1:18:53] pretty free today.
[1:18:55] I'm I'm going to say something to you
[1:18:57] something to you all right now. Some of
[1:18:59] the greatest times of growth and
[1:19:02] experience with Jesus Christ have been
[1:19:04] when I've been at my worst.
[1:19:09] I'm not telling you to get worse,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; but I know this. When you start thinking
[1:19:14] you're doing good, that's usually when
[1:19:15] worse comes
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; because God knows how to chasen his
[1:19:19] children because the word cannot lie.
[1:19:22] That's
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; right, brother.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:19:27] unto God.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; This is actually a move of grace that
[1:19:32] God is trying to bring to your
[1:19:33] revelation.
[1:19:37] Maybe I'll do that.
[1:19:42] Because this release God is trying to
[1:19:45] bring you, this release actually joins
[1:19:47] you to him.
[1:19:51] When you have a revelation,
[1:19:55] this is condemned.
[1:20:00] The effects of this flesh that work in
[1:20:02] your mind
[1:20:04] is condemned.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; It's not the real you. Oh, that sounds
[1:20:09] like a quote.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Then how can't you be free?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You see, most of the issue, brother,
[1:20:19] sister,
[1:20:21] is that frankly we're still trying to do
[1:20:24] it.
[1:20:27] That's right.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Because if you're free, how can't you
[1:20:33] smile?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; If you're free, how can you not rejoice?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; If you're free,
[1:20:44] especially under Christ's freedom,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; then what should Christ be unto you?
[1:20:50] Isn't it something when we look at all
[1:20:52] all the the the founding fathers of of
[1:20:55] Christendom in in the baptism of the
[1:20:57] Holy Ghost and how you know many of them
[1:20:59] struggled so much but yet they were so
[1:21:01] happy all the time.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Peter would look at look at the trial
[1:21:05] the beatings and he say oh for the light
[1:21:06] affliction.
[1:21:10] How many times you've been beaten up for
[1:21:11] Jesus?
[1:21:13] Anyone's u um stone 40 save one
[1:21:18] or whip whip excuse me whip 40 save one
[1:21:23] peril peril in the sea ships going down
[1:21:26] and
[1:21:27] stocks and bonds
[1:21:30] light affliction so if you don't even
[1:21:32] have that then what what do you got
[1:21:36] is
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; that something
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; we have a life of ease understand what
[1:21:42] I'm saying compared to some of these
[1:21:44] things.
[1:21:45] But yet, where's our smiles?
[1:21:50] Where's our love? Where's our release?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; When God wants to release you.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's something. It's not of works that
[1:21:58] I have done.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:22:10] said a lot.
[1:22:12] And I held you good amount about an hour
[1:22:16] and 15.
[1:22:18] But what's the purpose of all this?
[1:22:22] When you come into church today, how did
[1:22:24] you feel?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Feel overwhelmed, tired, stressed out,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; say, "God, when's this rapture going to
[1:22:32] happen? I've been saying it for 20
[1:22:34] years.
[1:22:40] Oh, I got to do it again. Oh,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; do what again?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; This is the greatest place you could be.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; David knew that in such a way. He said,
[1:22:56] "Better is one day in your courts than a
[1:22:59] thousand elsewhere." Hallelujah.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; To see your power and your glory as I've
[1:23:05] seen in your holy place, in your
[1:23:06] tabernacle.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; WHY? THERE'S RELEASE HERE.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DO YOU WANT RELEASE? DO YOU
[1:23:14] NEED MORE? AMEN. DO YOU NEED TO ENTER
[1:23:17] INTO IT?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THEN THEN WHAT? YOU GO TO
[1:23:20] THE ONE WHO WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be set free so that you
[1:23:28] could be
[1:23:31] And God will woo that in your heart.
[1:23:33] He'll change the way you feel. He'll
[1:23:35] change the the mental restrictions that
[1:23:38] are in your mind saying, "Well, it's got
[1:23:39] to be this way. It's got to be that way,
[1:23:40] or it's just not right, and you're not
[1:23:41] going to be happy."
[1:23:45] But it'll actually in turn,
[1:23:48] not getting all in that ear, it'll
[1:23:52] actually begin to release faith because
[1:23:53] of the hearing of the word.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:00] AMEN. I'M IN THE PROMISED LAND. I'M I'M
[1:24:03] HERE. THERE'S REST HERE. THERE'S JOY.
[1:24:06] THERE'S BURDEN. HIS YOKE IS EASY.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; The burden is light.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; What has Christianity become to you?
[1:24:16] Has it become the hardest challenge of
[1:24:18] your life to stay in this message, to
[1:24:21] stay in this word?
[1:24:23] Or has it become the greatest release?
[1:24:41] This is the greatest freedom
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; that we could ever hear. You mean
[1:24:45] hearing something like that? Hearing
[1:24:47] anytime the word comes forth
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; because it says faith cometh by hearing.
[1:24:52] Hearing brother Cam, hearing brother
[1:24:54] Jesse,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; hearing somebody else,
[1:24:57] hearing the word.
[1:25:01] HALLELUJAH. THE RELEASE IS ALREADY UPON
[1:25:04] YOU. THE RELEASE IS HERE. AMEN.
[1:25:07] HALLELUJAH. Deliverance is HERE IF YOU
[1:25:10] WANT IT. AMEN. GO TO THE GIVER OF THAT
[1:25:13] RELEASE AND HE WILL SET YOU FREE. AMEN.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; We're moving into season, best, sister.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to pray.
[1:25:22] How many say Lord give me a greater
[1:25:26] Lord you said at this end of that
[1:25:28] seventh year that release would be upon
[1:25:30] the people.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; The thing is right in the word but they
[1:25:32] would have to accept it. They'd have to
[1:25:34] hear it. Brother Ram said some people
[1:25:36] can't even hear it. They just want to
[1:25:36] stay in a denominational form of the
[1:25:38] message or a denominational form of this
[1:25:40] or that.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I want ears to hear.
[1:25:45] I want I got a hungry heart. Lord, I I
[1:25:47] want the whole word. Lord, open the word
[1:25:49] to me. Amen. Honey, TEACH ME HOW TO LIVE
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; BY THIS WORD.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what that means?
[1:25:58] That this word will feed you better than
[1:26:00] bread.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, it's 12:30 and I'm
[1:26:04] hungry.
[1:26:05] This word could fill you up right now.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Are you living by that?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray and I want to say,
[1:26:14] God, make that word like that to me.
[1:26:17] Show me how to live on that. Show me how
[1:26:18] to feed off of it. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:20] SHOW ME HOW TO FEED ON EL SHADAI.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; THE BREAST OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It's all Jesus. The whole thing.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Satan tries to play us so much
[1:26:38] on our spiritual and natural issues. He
[1:26:42] tries to tell you, "You're bad at this,
[1:26:43] you're bad at that. You shouldn't think
[1:26:46] like this or you shouldn't do that. You
[1:26:47] shouldn't do this." And he gets you all
[1:26:49] bound up.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that for a reason. I got
[1:26:53] closed two minutes ago, but something
[1:26:54] just keeps on moving me to do this.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Because this word's supposed to do
[1:26:58] something.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm still mad about this. I'm
[1:27:03] still Let it go. It's time,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Lord. Join me to you.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Give me a release, Lord, today.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, you died on that cross. The blood
[1:27:15] of God took my place. That's right.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; So, how could the life of that blood not
[1:27:20] come back on me?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; It has to. It can't fail. No, not one.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many want that today?
[1:27:30] Hallelujah. Lord, I want to be the
[1:27:31] happiest believer in the world because
[1:27:33] of your spirit inside of me.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Not intellectualism, not any of this. I
[1:27:37] want to be free, Lord. Completely
[1:27:39] released. Let's pray. Hallelujah.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; God, your hearts, Lord Jesus, we
[1:27:42] approach you right now, knowing you're
[1:27:44] in this room, LORD, KNOWING THAT YOU'VE
[1:27:46] COME TO this people, Lord. And Lord, it
[1:27:48] was you that drew them here, oh God, all
[1:27:51] these weeks and years and and ALL THAT
[1:27:53] YOU'VE TRIED TO ESTABLISH in their
[1:27:54] hearts. And Lord, YOU'RE BUILDING THEM
[1:27:56] UP FOR SOMETHING at the end of this
[1:27:58] seven church age. OH GOD, WE KNOW IT'S
[1:28:01] NOT SOMETHING WEAK. IT'S NOT SOMETHING
[1:28:02] THAT'S LEODYSIAN. IT'S SOMETHING
[1:28:05] POWERFUL. LORD,
[1:28:08] you've seen the hands. You heard those
[1:28:11] voices.
[1:28:12] And they want to be free, Lord. They
[1:28:15] want to be released and release others.
[1:28:17] They want brotherly kindness.
[1:28:20] They want to be able to work harder for
[1:28:21] others, Lord, to try to strengthen them,
[1:28:23] exhort them, and love them.
[1:28:26] They want to let go of all the bondage
[1:28:29] that's on them where Satan fights them,
[1:28:33] tries to lord over their faith. We only
[1:28:35] have one Lord of the Sabbath. It's you,
[1:28:38] Lord.
[1:28:40] So we give ourselves to you right now,
[1:28:42] Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:28:45] Christ, that Lord, THE LIVING GOD THAT'S
[1:28:49] IN OUR MIDST WOULD GO TO EVERY HEART,
[1:28:51] LORD. THEY'LL SEE US WHERE they're at.
[1:28:54] This is more than an amen.
[1:28:57] This is a complete change of heart and
[1:28:59] life.
[1:29:01] Teach them how to live on that word.
[1:29:04] teach them how to be released
[1:29:06] that oh God there's no condemnation that
[1:29:09] could strike them because they've been
[1:29:11] freed in you.
[1:29:14] May it be so in the name of Jesus
[1:29:16] Christ.
[1:29:17] MAY THEY WALK OUT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT
[1:29:20] THEY CAME IN. AND MAY THEY REJOICE IN A
[1:29:23] god
[1:29:25] who when it came time to say he wanted
[1:29:29] to be released,
[1:29:31] he was dumb as a sheep to the shears.
[1:29:35] Thank you for what you've done, Lord. We
[1:29:37] love you so much. Bring that freedom
[1:29:39] upon your children. For the glory in
[1:29:41] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:44] invite our our brother here
[1:29:49] of God.
[1:29:52] And I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1:30:00] I am a child of God. Anyone need a
[1:30:05] prayer? Hallelujah. I'm no longer a
[1:30:10] slave to fear.
[1:30:14] I am a child
[1:30:18] of God.
[1:30:22] You unravel me
[1:30:26] with a melody
[1:30:29] surround me with
