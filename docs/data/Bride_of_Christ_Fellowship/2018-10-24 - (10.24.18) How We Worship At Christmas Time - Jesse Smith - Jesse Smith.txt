then I smile lift our soul to a man praise God thank you Lord amen you maybe see if you like we'll take a few prayer requests here today announcements by God's grace I'd like to go over the announcements real quick we have brother Joe Adams this Sunday so we're looking forward to that I really had a burden you know brother Simon's been preaching on it and other brothers too but I really have a burden too how about the evangelists so that's why I've been trying this just schedule them right away to come right back so I just have a burden for that so we're happy to have brother Joe we preaching to Sunday services by God's grace oh and looking forward to that but the bender odd will be with us on November 17 or November 18th rather and then missionary brother Jason de Mars will be with us December 8th and 9th so looking forward to that by God's grace [Music] well we have a little testimony Haven would like to share testimony SWAT you stand there Haven let's say praise the Lord for that yeah that I had some like all matter and it was all kind of closed up and they just prayed for it the next day was all well again so Haven was really really thankful for that so God's interested in all nature you know we know that so we're very thankful for that Haven god bless you numerous oh yeah we also had a good testimony from sister Brenda or from sister Karen for sister Brenda I think I sent it to most I send it to you sister Connie okay I'm sorry I what I meant to send it to everybody Oh sister Karen sent me a text and said after service on Sunday night Brenda went into a spell so we were out there Karen asked me to pray for her and she would I was just tapping her but she's like staring for word didn't say nothing and Karen said that's what happens when should go through a seizure and she won't remember Brenda won't remember things for like 24 or 36 hours so she asked me to pray and of course me a lot of good faith you know because of the worship on when Sunday night you know a lot of faith after watching each other's feet and taking communion but she said she talked to Brenda on the way home and she remembers feeling an episode of coming on of a seizure then suddenly felt a loud whoosh that was pulling away from her and she woke up she said it felt like angel wings so after Amon and I we joined hands and we prayed and I said amen I just slowly opened my eyes all of a sudden I was kind of shocked because Brenda just went like that and that's what she was talking about she spent like that and then she started talking all about Jesus I mean and then but then on the way home she didn't even remember talking to me after service it's almost like God woke her up and that God started letting all these blessings flow out of her she was speaking face she was telling me what a blessing I was to her her spiritual life and all these things it was really glorious and she said a thought like angel wings I believe God touched her and will continue to have faith for a complete healing thank you for praying God is truly a miracle working God so let's thank the Lord for that praise God that's the best part we realized that we're not here just ourselves but Christ is here because if we're just here that can that's a lodge but if he's here then it's really having church amen so we're thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ you know who else no one can do that but Jesus so we're thankful for God's mercy okay then we have a numerous numerous prayer requests so let's keep these in prayer brother Fang sent me a text Lily sick tonight and he said will you please pray first I said yes we'll pray for Lily my daughter Victoria and Genevieve are both sick with a runny nose as well so let's pray for them they both all three got runny noses let's pray for those children are God's a healer praise God let's pray for Brenda's for healing like my sister Karen said Brenda told me on Sunday I'm believing for complete healings I can walk again without the walker so let's believe that all things are possible to them that believe also there was a numerous request from some sisters in New York I just they came up as reminders so let's pray for them their grandchildren also salvation for husbands and sons and some of the pastor's needed a touch from the Lord as well so let's pray for that any other requests tonight by God's grace but brother

amens anyone have a special night you may be seated here anyone have a special all right praise God let's see one more it's already 7:30 by God's grace do you have a preference Malachi which one of those drove a gyro give us our God rain something keeps holding me or we press on you have a present reference okay I sing in jesus name we press on to see not by God's grace praise God [Music] when the valley is d when the mountainous T when the body is weird when we stumble and when the choice is our heart and we're battered and scarred and we spend our resources and we give it our all in Jesus name we press or on and on in Jesus name we press oh dear Lord with the prize it is plea before our eyes we find the string to press or dear Lord with the prize you are with the prize it is before we fight to press oh boy thank you look you can find some strength tonight by God's grace compress on a man let's say on the read our Bibles here praise guys go to Colossians chapter 2 I like to preach a little sermon off our regular topics I know I've been doing that lately but I just kind of feel led to do it I'd like to just preach a little bit on Christmas I want to follow up with you on that I know it's a little early but I don't know about you but I celebrate Christmas every day I thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ every day well that's part of Christmas because you can't have Calvary without Jesus birth so I want to call this message how we worship at Christmas time I just want to share with you how my family worships how brother branham talked about it and I just want to bring the way that we feel led you know I haven't preached this actually since 2006 so it's been 12 years since I've preached on Christmas because after I laid it down at the beginning of the church I just thought well everybody gets it you know everybody understands it I never really revisited it so I just thought I'd revisit it a little bit today and I told brother Simon you know brother Simon preach a little bit on it and I said right before the sermon I sent him a text and said you know I'm gonna preach on that tonight follow up with it if you like to hear you know what I believe about it I know obviously he and I differ a little bit on it which is fine we're brothers we love each other that man brought me the message you know I always be eternal grateful for him and this is what I believe honestly I believe Christmas is just a Christian Liberty so I want to just read that just from the Colossians 2:16 and 17 which means a Christian Liberty is an act of God a choice God gives you and if you do it it doesn't make you any more holy if you don't do it it doesn't make you any more holy it's an area of Liberty so it's not like a command it's not a sin it's just a human action and inside of that the only the main thing we have to do is make sure we just don't judge other people praise the Lord so Colossians 2:16 and 17 if you're there say Amen let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday brother branham over and over calls Christmas a holy day a holiday or of the new moon we don't keep new moons but Jews would so Jewish Christians would or of the Sabbath days we don't keep actual Sabbath day like a Saturday but Sunday's our Sabbath day so for Christians the Sabbath day is built into their regular Christian experience the first day of the week should be worship according to Acts chapter 20 and that should be a day where you don't work if you possibly can I know some of us do so Connie don't feel bad about that you know sometimes you don't have a choice but if you had a choice on Sunday would you work but you can't sometimes you just can't help it right brother here sometimes you can't help it but it's not a law it's not a law anymore like well if you work on Sunday you're going to hell it's not a law anymore but it's a day that we want to set aside if we possibly can to worship Jesus that whole day if you can verse 17 now look look at this which are what a shadow of things to come but the body is Christ so no matter what holy days you keep well this days this was brother Rams birthday you know April fourth or what was April 6 this is such a holy day for me it might be for you or maybe it was the day brother Branham got married October 23rd just yesterday you know such a holy day for me yeah whatever day oh brother man died on Christmas Eve that's just such a holy day for me well it might be for you and even all the new moon days or the Sabbath days well you know I fast every Saturday night from sundown to sunset you know whatever you know all these things were shadows of something greater and that something greater is a person that's Jesus Christ all these liberties all these areas of liberties and then all these shadows they're all supposed to point us to one thing that's Jesus Christ go to Romans 1413 let's read that there'll be our last scripture here Romans 1413 and this is the main thing for me now again brother Simon or someone else might feel different about this than me but this is the way I look at it I believe it's a Christian Liberty whether people do certain traditions for Christmas or not to me it's a it's a area of Liberty as long as it doesn't involve sin does ever understand if you're sinning of course that's not an area of Liberty sitting and drinking drunk and present swapping just for the pressure we'll get to that just because you feel pressured to buy it well if I don't buy them a gift they're gonna hate me that's a sin you know that's it we'll get to that but but it just giving a gift is not a sin that there's nothing wrong with that it's the spirits that are motivating you to do it that's sin Romans 14 13 let us not therefore judge one another any more but Judge this rather so listen we got one thing to judge about Christmas or Easter Thanksgiving we got one thing to judge that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way that's the one thing we got to make sure that Myles my choice is about Christmas my choice is about Easter that they don't cause somebody to stumble that's the main thing we got to do let me understand let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer us again ask the Lord to help us here Heavenly Father Lord I just felt burdened to preach Lord I sure appreciate my brother in the flesh and the spirit who preached his thoughts Lord and he was so gracious and so respectful I appreciate that and I just felt Lord led of your spirit to kind of revisit this again it's been 12 years Lord God oh my and father I'm just grateful Lord to have 12 years to serve you so Lord just give me grace Lord God to preach this the way that you've revealed it to me Lord by the dictates of my conscience Lord I believe I'm born again and I believe I searched the Scriptures daily I believe Lord I have a gift to rightly divide the word of truth so help me Jesus and help each one of us to judge this rather that we do not put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in our brother's way and we'll be happy Lord as we seek your face tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you bein seated praise the Lord I know this might not be a shouting message you know how like Sunday morning I was shouting hallo all over Sunday morning but thank God and God vindicated it was sister Connie's testimony their praise God but it's more along the lines of teaching you know because we need to take all these things back to the Word of God so I like to begin with that thought how Christian Liberty is is something that God gives us that we make a choice and we have to we have to decide whether we're going to do an action or not now the Bible gave us those clear definitions how many know that meat eating is a Liberty it's not a sin to eat meat thank goodness cuz I sure like meat and when God came in flesh and A's in Abraham God Abraham told Sarah go kill the calf and feed it to God right and God ate the calf God ate meat so there's nothing wrong with me eating of course or drink or now drink of course is wine so let me go through each one of these in my book which is almost done by God's grace of God Terry's I just contacted the national designer and she'll start in three weeks she's so busy she has to wait three weeks and it'll take her about six weeks to finish so it'll probably release right about the beginning of 2019 so I'll be so happy I'll tell you that I'll be so happy you don't know how happy I'm gonna be after putting six years of work into that thing you don't know how happy I'm gonna be I'm gonna be happy because I think it can help people around the world that's why I'm doing it but anyways in that book I take a little bit of a chapter and teach on this meet was an area of Liberty because there was a lot of meets the Jews couldn't eat and remember Paul wrote this in the time of transition where they're transitioning from law to grace so there's there's a transition time in there and so even Peter remember an accent even Peter God chose him a vision of all these animals in a sheet and God said rise Killiney and Peter said no Lord three times and God says don't call uncommon what I've called clean and so there were such a it was such a difficult mindset to go from from law to grace and it was so much so that Paul had to write a letter about it and he said if you just eat herbs only be happy about that if you want to eat meat have to be happy about that he said but the one thing to do if there's Christians around you and you're at a restaurant in a public place and you eat meat that was sacrificed to an idol if you eat that meat and the weaker Christian sees you do that and somehow that eating meat would cause that person to go worship that Idol he said then you wounded their weak conscience all right so that was the only thing with me that we really got to be cared about and also to make sure we don't eat blood from a strangled animal is that's in the book of Acts as well so this is gonna be just you know kind of more like a teaching here is everybody with me today so that's me you we have areas of Liberty with me eating you can be a vegetarian you can be a omnivore whatever you want to be you can be either one but the main thing to do is not eat not drink blood or you know a animal that was strangled and then also not to eat meat if you saw it was sacrificed to an idol now that's not really gonna happen in our country but Wendy after I preached it a while ago Wendy sent me pictures from Hong Kong and they do that it's Philippines people do it all over the world to their false gods they will have parties and though and they'll put up all their their gods their idols and then they'll invite their friends with meat and it and they'll have meats and these mate meats were sacrificed to the idols so that's something we can't relate to but Wendy can other people can where they they they they sacrifice meat to gods and then they eat it and have a feast well thank God we're not a part of that amen we've got enough Devils of our own to fight in America we've got enough devils over here let alone more idols around the house you know we got we got the idols in the house of the football game on Sunday you know and the basketball game on Sunday night and all these nonsense like that where they're suckers they're having cookouts for that it's the same thing just a different spirit so that's how I first want to say this is my revelation I feel like God's given me there's areas of Liberty now wine is them is one of the most serious ones because if you drink wine and it causes somebody to go get drunk because you did it irresponsibly the Bible said you sinned against Christ now drinking wine in this church is not going to cause anybody to go get drunk unless when I give you the cup you just chug the whole thing now that's never happened in 12 years I've been pastor but if someone showed the whole thing in it that's the kind of sounds that religious but then ask me for another cup I'd say you're wrong you know you're off the word you're a glutton or something like that so see there's really no way as we know we chuckle but that would never happen to search I never let that happen but if somebody goes out to Carabas or even Chipotle they have beer Chipotle or if somebody goes out at the Olive Garden a Christian a messege believer and orders wine to drink in public and then another message reliever walks in said oh brother Jesse's got wine now I don't do that but let's say it was me cuz I don't want to use you I'll just use myself oh he has one well I guess I can go order my Chipotle and buy some Coronas afterwards and if they're so weak in the faith that they slam a Corona then they slam another they go get drunk and they die in a car accident guess who's responsible guess who loses their reward I do so see that's the important part about wine is that so for me in my house we don't drink any wine in our house we only drink wine at this house because I don't want my children see me sipping some wine you know I'm feelings kind of know if you're sick that's different then you would tell your children and I know people that do that when they're sick they'll have a little wine because it's proven effective and they've got doctors advice to do it and they do it and they try not to do in front of their children and their children are very godly they scream in the spirit they shout in the spirit I've seen him dancing the spirit I've seen him cry in this spirit I've seen their children worship so this this brothers handed it really well and he says he get he takes a little wine for his stomach's sake just like the Bible says and so that's an area of Christian Liberty now what I'm telling you though as a pastor is that you better be very careful how you use wine because it's so easily addictive right so you better better be careful and that's the area of Liberty the Bible says so right there in Colossians chapter 2 now to me the holy day listen here is what I would apply to Christmas okay because the Bible doesn't say we should all gather on December 25th and have a church service the Bible doesn't say that cause the Bible says that the Saints gathered on the first day of the week to worship so we gather on the first day of the week Sunday that's the first day of the week for us and that's why we worship in Acts chapter 20 where though the Bible said they took offerings Paul preached on the first day of the week so because they met on Sunday that's why we meet on Sunday it's the honor of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ also we know that but whether you worship on on Christmas December 25th or Easter we're never here I know with the word Easter is a pagan word I try to use the word resurrection day I try to just use that more and more I don't believe it's a sin to say the word Easter cuz brother Branham didn't say that the Bible doesn't say that now the bible does say the word Easter because it was a pagan feast that's why I try to use the word resurrection day more like especially at work they'll say what are you doing for Easter well I say well for Resurrection Day I'm preaching or something like that you know we're gonna have a carry in or something you know after after a resurrection day whatever I I just try to say the name Jesus or point to the resurrection but to me that's just an area of Liberty I don't believe you're sinning if you say Happy Easter I don't believe that's the sin brother Branham said that a couple of times so let me uh let me go to you know I'll just go to my why don't I just skip to my what you're asking I'll just skip to some quotes our brother Brandon how about that so you know I kind of had a different few outlines in my mind here I wrote them down but let me just let me just go to some quotes here and you get you to see this here now traditions now you and I know this and with any tradition with any Liberty we cannot had any sin to any Liberty because then it automatically makes it not a Liberty it makes it a sinful act and you know Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are all lies from the pit of hell can you say amen to that never events that never teach your children Santa Claus never teach them Easter bunnies never tell your child a lie never lie to your children never lie to your children never lie to anyone of course don't lie to the pastor huh don't lie to the song leader don't lie to anybody because program program even tells us this in the church age book he talks about Santa Claus and bunnies at Easter where'd they get that they got it from the pagans and made it a part of the Church doctrine but when someone turns to the Lord and is filled with the Holy Ghost he ceases from all such things so see that's one proof that you're born again you just hate any lie anything that even lies anything that's even for you no lies and nonsense like that anything that takes glory away from Jesus you hate it because the love of God's in your heart all right so Santa is a lie and brother I don't know if you knew this but brother Ram said in 1959 I done growed away from that so brother Ram used to celebrate Santa Claus or used to talk about senator senator Claus he said I done growed away from that aren't you glad he grew away from that he grew now maybe he was talking as a child we don't even know really from the quote but he said I growed away from that so maybe as a child he believed in it and then he grew away from it so he says it's important he says if I tell my boy a lie then I'm a liar so true now all these other traditions like a Christmas tree now now here's what I'm going to tell you about a Christmas tree I believe a Christmas tree is an area of Liberty as well personally my family does not put up a tree but I'm not going to condemn people that do I've known very fine godly Christians that put up a Christmas tree and I'm not going to condemn them for doing that and you know why because brother Brandon put up a Christmas tree and if anybody had the Holy Ghost it was brother Branham because he was the star right and there's seven stars I remember that I preached 80 sermons on the church ages seven there were seven stars in the hand of Jesus and one of those burning fiery stars was William Marion Branham and in his house at Christmas time you would have found a Christmas tree but for me I can't do it I've read the history I don't know I just can't do it my parents put one up when I was a child I can't do it especially because of Jeremiah chapter 10 let's go to Jeremiah chapter 10 now this is not saying a Christmas tree but to me it just sounds so much like a tree I just can't put up a Christmas tree and church don't get me wrong I'm not locking people who do I'm not I I respect them I'm not just I laugh about it because I just can't do it it just makes me laugh I'd to me it's just my conviction I can't do it but Jeremiah chapter 10 look at verse 1 hear you the word of Lord I'm sorry which the Lord speaketh unto you O house of Israel thus saith the LORD learned out the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain now custom of course is a tradition just like remember remember the Bible said Abraham taking Hagar was a custom so that was just something they did for us it's not a custom right thank God you know he could have extra wives and things like that handmaids like Jacob they could have their Haran maids and maidens and things like that extra wives it was a custom but the custom of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe they deck it with silver with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not they are upright as the palm tree must speak not they must need to be born because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil and either also is it in them to do good okay so I'll just stop right there so there must have been one pagan practice that closely resembled Christmas tree and this was 600 years before Christ Jeremiah was written 600 years before Christ so because of that and B plus I can't see I just can't see any relation to a tree you know being close to Christ I just don't put up a tree brother Simon also preached a tremendous message on trees if you don't remember that we got it on on the computer and he showed how any tree that was cut down was actually a curse tree and remember Jesus had to be cut down he had to take on the curse so the only way you know this is just my thought the only way like a tree could even be spiritual is like okay well we went out we cut down this tree and it represents how Jesus was cut down and then Jesus was crowned with glory and honor like to me I'm just I'm just grasping for straws on that like that to me that's not the only way if you thought to me that a Christmas tree could be something good but to me I can't do it because of this I just I can't do it but brother Simon's showed that every tree that's a godly tree outside of Christ was supposed to never be cut down because the Bible said he's like a tree that's planted by rivers of water hey man whose leaf doesn't wither remember we look at that on Sunday whose fruit he bringeth forth fruit in in his season his fruit doesn't wither so again you may do a tree and that's fine that's wonderful I mean that's fine for wonderful for you not for me that doesn't do anything for me so program says this now listen in 1953 brother Branham said how my how I can't understand how where our rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection no sir or how a Christmas tree has anything to do with the birth of birth of Christ it's pagan friends so a 1953 brother branham called it pagan and then seven years later 1960 he said he had a tree in his house so he said I got a little boy small enough you have to kind of want a Christmas tree and we had it in the room he says and this morning I go into the tree I found several gifts from my church here that makes me laugh because brother Randhawa he was growing right as a Christian was he growing in the statue forever man or was he perfect the day he got the Holy Ghost he was growing he had to grow in the armor of God he had to grow in the fruits of the spirit and the church said so seven years he said it's pagan friends seven years later he says what we got a Christmas tree cuz Joseph wants one so see Church if the light if the messenger of the hour could have a tree I'm not gonna condemn it but to me also I think of as Jeremiah 10 also I think of him is my childhood when I spent all that time decorating the tree and there was if we had if my dad had a job that year there was president her under there if not I just had flashlights under there because the the church gave us flashlights you know for Christmas because we are so poor so to me a tree doesn't mean anything but if you like to put it up when I just suggest if you'd like it well then sing to Jesus while you put it up whatever traditions you do just try to get something spiritual out of it that's what I would suggest now some of these other ones I preached years ago we don't talk about like mistletoe that's from Hell you know who of course nobody would ever discourage kissing you know kissing is like a precursor to fornication so you wouldn't want to put up a mistletoe in your house you know that all these Christmas trees and all these traditions they all go back to evil people you know I don't I don't have that history memorized but they all go back to the Druids or you know a couple thousand years ago evil people it all goes back to that but I just want to try to try to show you by the Bible and by the quotes how we worship at Christmas time okay now let me uh let me read a few more here okay so tell the truth all right brother Brandon I said you had a tree growing up all right let's go over this here okay let's gift-giving we look at a few quotes on gift-giving Bram says may the great gifts from the Christ be poured out upon the people tonight that belong to the body not a package sealed up not with Christmas presents in it as the earthly beings can give to each other in appreciation of our love to each other some other have said we give each other gifts and appreciation well I appreciate you brother I appreciate you sister but he said may a heavenly gift be given also and really as that's where I'm going as you know brother Bram said there only is one Christmas gift in the world and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham said there really are no real Christmas gifts other than being born again of the God of God Almighty oh I know yeah glory there's really only one all the other things we just do as tradition they're just liberties now this is a 19 I ain't brother Ram said it's the greatest present that we could ever give he's speaking of the Holy Ghost I'm sorry of ourselves to God oh of course you give your friend's Christmas presents that's good that's tokens so a program says it's good to give people gifts as long as it's done the right way brother Branham said I received some mighty fine Christmas presents a movie camera and many other things guns and things that people love me they give me how I appreciate that now here's one thing I want you to know to people that don't give gifts one thing that they need to know too is that brother Branham never told people don't give me gifts if he was somehow moving away from Christmas which some people may believe he was which is fine they're there they're able to believe that he never told them to stop he always thanked them for giving gifts in fact the second to last sermon brother Branham preached leadership he ended the sermon by thanking people or a woman for giving him chocolates for Christmas so a week before he died he's thinking I'm saying sister thank you for the chocolates I appreciate that he said Merry Christmas so he never like moved away from it and started condemning any of these liberties can I just call them that liberties their customs or liberties or traditions as far as I can find he never moved away from that brother may have said I wish I could give Christmas presents to everyone I can't do it you know how it is how many feel that way I feel that way I wish I could give Christmas presents to everybody remember last year when I gave out those gift cards for Christmas that's my way of giving a gift everybody I'm cheap you know I wish I could give you something better that's about all I can do for Christmas and I feel like brother Branham I wish I could do it for everybody he said but I can't do it you know how it is did you know in 1961 brother Branham gay brother Neville a coat for Christmas and you know why he said brother Neville you was neat in that coat he says so you must had an old ragged coat on he walk in the church as a pastor every man says I'd like to get him a new coat for Christmas so program went out bought him a coat and gave it to brother Neville did you know brother Branham always said Merry Christmas to the people back here to quote he said I want to wish you the merriest of Christmases he says he's the good evening friends I just got in a little while ago and I thought I would come down and wish you all a Merry Christmas now let's get to the evil part of swapping gifts which I said earlier if you are swapping gifts just to get gifts now you've got us a greedy spirit on you why no brother Aaron gives good gifts I'll make sure I get him a new cooking set I'll make sure I spend $40 on him this year because I know he gives good gifts he's got a lot of money you know and that awful people would think that swapping gifts and here's the part where where I struggle it's with the pride aspect for example like if somebody gives you a gift I feel so prideful like oh I better get like I feel awful if I don't give them something back I don't know if you feel that or not my wife's not that way we're talking about last night you know she's like oh I just feel happy they gave me gifts I'm like I can't feel that way if somebody gives me a gift I feel like indebted to them like well I've got to get you back let me write that down you know and if I did that it would drive me crazy because I have so many people I need to repay especially around Christmas time for all the the parents of all my students I get probably 40 or 50 gifts every Christmas and so sweet of those people and God bless them for that but if I'm not if I'm not careful that'll make now drive me crazy I'll feel indebted to them and that what is that that's pride I think he well I'm too good and I don't need gifts you know I don't know don't give me gifts you know now I'm indebted to you that's pride remember there's only three channels is less divides pride of life and less of the flesh there's only one of those it's you know every sin is one of those and so that's the pride of life I'm so prideful I don't need your gift sir I don't want you to give me gifts Bertram's said if each one of us if each one of us can last night all this Christmas tinsel quit all this swapping gifts one another all this nonsense of the world and just take off our pride and lay it down and stop the thing underfoot and say Lord Jesus give me that perfect light see people but member church there's nothing wrong with giving somebody gift but if your whole attitude is oh this is gift swapping time I'm gonna give so I can get back that's the wrong attitude that's a remember so that's a sinful attitude that's a prideful attitude but man some people today got no room for Jesus under their tree he said they're under their tree they got a big box of beer somewhere they've got a deck of cards for Mama no room for Christ but there's room for cards he said there's a little g-man book or comic book or something like that no room for Jesus so any gift you give somebody if it causes them to sin you are sinning and look what people have made Christmas so gifts shouldn't be worldly obviously all right brother Brad was it a commercial day he says but we have tryst he said but Christmas should be a day of worship how do you believe it's a day of worship it isn't my house Christmas is a day worship we start first by having Christmas breakfast and Kristen cooks the best Christmas breakfast I've ever had I wish I had enough food too might all of you over but then she'd be worn out she have to stay up all night but then after that we read the Bible we all gather around we have like a little hutch which is like a drawer you know dresser kind of drawer thing and the kids set up a it's a fisher-price nativity set I mean it kind of you if you squeeze them they kind of squeak I think because the family bought them for me years ago we didn't buy them a family bought it for me for Christmas one of the parents from school so we just set it up and you know you the kids like the little kids like to go around and play you know with with the camels and and all that the animals you know the wise men and so we just gather on there and then we'll read the chapter in Luke chapter 2 or Matthew chapter 2 about the Magi or we'll read the whole chapter and after that we'll sing a few Christmas carols you know what you're not I don't really like to say Christmas carols because they're worship songs their worship oh come let us adore him that's my favorite Christmas Carol oh come let me adorn Jesus Christ the Lord amen for he alone is worthy Christ the Lord that's worship amen hallelujah and then for that then we'll open up the gifts everybody gets three gifts you know a clothes a toy in a book everybody gets three that's the way we can actually pay for you know if not we couldn't pay for it so we got a limit than the number of gifts after that the kids play with it you know and we'll do Bible of course we'll still do Bible time and prayer time that day so it's a day of worship it centers around Jesus Christ but we have said Christmas should be a day of worship but we have twisted around and made it one of the greatest commercial days and it's all fixed up on passing presents one to another and having your feelings hurt if we don't do it and pay them back it's just all twisted up he says and that's exactly me if I if I'm not careful it will become like oh I got to pay my my brother's wife backer I gotta pay back my sister or I gotta I gotta pay them back and it's not to be that day it's to be a day of worship praise God now you know what the word commercial means by Marisa is a commercial day the word commercial means a day of financial profit so if Christmas to you is all about my look at all the gifts I'm getting you just made it a commercial day oh my you know I can I can sell these things for Christmas you know I could I can do real good for Christmas now don't get wrong if you are if you're a business owner yeah you have to make money you have to you have to sell things to make money but you don't want the emphasis on that day to be all about money you have the f-insas to be on Jesus Christ that's right Milda have said it's not a celebration it's a worship praise God all right now let me see brother man brother man was really sensitive to create a children at Christmas did you know brother branham wouldn't go preach places around Christmastime because he knew that money that the people in the church would take their money from the Christmas gifts and give them a brother branham so he's like well I'll come but not a Christmas time here's where he says in 1959 so the reason I don't because if I go to another meeting mothers and daddies will take from their pocket to support the meeting and maybe the little fellows would miss something at Christmas and that make me feel awful bad see so I'll come back after Christmas Wow Wow he was so sensitive to children getting something good for Christmas he says I won't come around Christmastime because I know mom and dad they're gonna give me an offering or something like that but I want I don't want them to miss a gift for Christmas yeah that's right no he says he talks about Christmas he said now we don't want to deprive the little fellows but you can't tell that to little children he's talking about how Christmas is gambling and drinking and carousing just peg into the limit he says but you can't tell those children things like that they see the little fellows on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that they don't understand and they're Dolittle and we've got to remember them that they are they have things in common we've got to bring ourselves down to remember them little fellas they themselves the RAM says they're for little kids you have to let them have something but always be sure this tell them there's no such thing as Santa Claus so this is mother bear's idea like Christian children are gonna be around non-christians and see them getting presents and see them dressing up for Halloween and all these things they see them getting candy and and they're gonna feel bad that they don't get to do that so that's why I told my Taekwondo master last night I said I said sir we don't do Halloween but you can sure believe I'll give my children a lot of ice cream yeah Lydia knows I do I treat them to sugar Aaron treats in the sugar mercy amen treat him to sugar ice cream sandwiches so yeah they don't get to go trick-or-treating but you know where trick-or-treating comes from trick-or-treating comes from teenagers that were so idolatrous in the days of the Celts that they would they were so poor they would go to the rich people's houses and knock on the door and say if you don't give us food we're gonna curse you in the name of our God migaila because I've got the video I can show you the video and the history behind that that's where trick-or-treating comes from it's so awful that's where it comes from door to door begging these poor poor teenager's begging the rich people for gifts or they're gonna bring curses and they would actually burn out in the rich people's houses if they didn't give them something that's where from and now you want to dress up your kids as a trick-or-treat smell my feet give me something good to eat and you wanna dress them up like that they're gonna turn out to be a bunch of pagans right and teach them evil Rhymes and stuff like that oh it's awful that's where that trash comes from in church remember this brother Branham gave gifts all all through his whole life one of the one of the final sermons he preached well just as they find him but one of the sermons he preached in 65 was birth pains and then after that he preached this day the Scriptures fulfilled I remember that and in the story brother Branham would not have even preached this day the scriptures were filled had his wife not bought him a brand new Scofield Bible for Christmas and the pages got stuck together and brother Branham couldn't find his text remember that and he got all nervous and the Catholic priest comes up in the hands of the Bible and said be careful or be call my son God's moving here because his wife bought him a Christmas gift a brand-new Scofield Bible and you know the story behind that brother Branham brother ram realizes it's a priest giving him a Bible in the house of God saying this day's the scriptures fulfill birth pains and brother Branham likens that brother Branham preaching birth pains was exactly what Jesus was preaching except Jesus preaching the open door when the priest came and handed him the scroll he opened the scroll said read the scroll and said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen so the whole way that the whole thing that allowed this to happen was a Christmas gift and a Bible that had pages stick together amen so jesus said this day the scripture is fulfilled which was the day of mercy brother Branham comes along said this day is this scripture fulfilled in other words we're entering into the day of judgment where this earth is going to bring forth birth pains all because of a Christmas gift God used the Christmas gift brother Branham said now don't forget these jerseys are born quotes he's doing the altar call at the end of a Christmas sermon he said it's Christ in you God dwelling in the human heart that's what the real Christmas means he says all right what did I miss it okay oh yeah he said this is a real sacred hour I'm sorry I lost my spot so there's many times brother Branham says Christmas is the sacred hour he said it's too bad the world has taken away the sacredness of Christmas so in other words brother Branham as a man as a Christian looked at December 25th and to him with his Christian Liberty it was a sacred day in other words he would treat it reverently respectfully he would worship he'd give his children gifts he would receive gifts from people thank them to him it was a sacred time now to other people it might not seem like a sacred time but even if they don't think it's sacred the one thing they should do is they should respect people who do think it's sacred that's right now we know of course Chrisman has Christmas has so many pagan roots we've been we went over that last night at Taekwondo heberto we were talking about that we go over it every year at Christmastime in the third sorry in the fourth century the Emperor Constantine this is all history you can read it if you want he saw all the pagans memory he just converted to Christianity which it wasn't a real conversion he had just saw the pagans worshipping on December 25th because that was the birthday of their son gods all the names of their son gods you can name him asteroth the son too I forget all the names now but he thought well the way we can win them over is instead of letting them have that day to themselves we will worship Jesus on December 25th and invite them into our celebrations so that was Constantine's way and that's always the Catholics way to do things is to mix lies and truth but the way of the Christian is always to separate lives from truth and that's even history - there's other Catholic priests that were known to do that the early Catholics they would always mix some of the pagan religion with their religion to try to get them to accept it and over years and over decades and over lifetimes they would just start doing the traditions they just got used to it and then Christmas became a conglomeration of all these pagan ideas so as Halloween so has Easter it's just become a mixture of all these pagan things mother Branham said at Christmastime it's so sacred he said I consecrate myself for this Christmas not as the world would do or to turn new pages Lord I just want to accept your son I want to accept your gift Lord the Christmas was a time of consecration and I'll say like this church really Christmas is really not a time of more consecration for me than any other time I try to if I'm free if Christmas on a Sunday I try to fast just like I do on it at any other Sunday you know it's not really a more time of consecration to me all the days are the same every day should be consecrated to Christ amen now but but that's just me then I maybe I preach that too hard I don't want to sound like I'm bashing somebody that that thinks that day is more special I mean that day may be more special to some people but what I mean is I want to respect that but to me I think every day's holy to me I I try to consecrate every day right we try to make every day special like I told you every time I thank God and my children will tell you every time I pray at the table every time I pray at Bible time I always thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ and in doing that I'm thanking God for sending his son to lie in a manger amen glory because you can't have this without that day men and program said the same thing but the RAM said Christmas is a great holiday and that's a quote great holiday not an awful holiday he said it's a great holiday it's a sacred time for us now I guess I could say this year I guess I could say this I guess Christmas time could be a little more consecration because what I do is when we wrap the gifts every year either my wife rive if I have enough energy I'll draw Christmas pictures on there like I'll get my Bible or I'll get my phone and I'll type in like Mary and Joseph and I'll get a picture on my phone you know and I'll sit there and I'll try to draw that on there and we'll write scriptures on right Lydia Malachi will write scriptures on the wrapping paper so we just used plain wrapping paper and I get my little artist pen out you know nice I started trying to excite you to like to draw I don't draw anymore cuz I don't have time I wish I could I'd rather write books you know in my free time but that so so to me so maybe that might mean I'm more sanctified or consecrated cuz I'm spending more time thinking about the things of God now as time is going on we've had more gifts oh my drawings get less and less detailed you know so but the point being that that there could be a possibility you know I consecrate more during that time or I spend more time meditating perhaps Laura have said no sir no this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour alright it ought to be a solemn day of worship to God instead of heartache and a headache see if all the gift-giving of all the putting up trees if that causes heartache or headache we shouldn't do things that do that this should be a time of worship alright okay now one thing her brother sent really like this this is a quote from brother branham did you know that God allowed Christmas to be celebrated even though he allowed it to be moved to December 25th which we know it's not that day brother branham said it's still God's way to make them praise God did you know that so what I mean is this like even men like Donald Trump or sinners or people who don't know God or you know or any man you name it Steve I'm sorry uh Tim Tim Cook any billionaire you know who every one of those guys I'm sure take Christmas off and they don't work that day and brother branham said by doing that God is making all men praise Him brother Ram says that he says this in 1956 now God to make all things praise him we are celebrating the Christmas birth of the Lord Jesus which isn't just exactly his birthday his birthday was in April because it's just as cold in Judea or colder in December than it is here did you catch that so when when when the world went when they put it on the calendar December 25th that is God's way of letting all the nations recognize that he sent his son whether they recognize it or not whether they believe it or not God is allowing them by putting it on the calendar God's forcing them to deal with it and when they stop and when they don't work that day or they take that day off and get drunk or whatever it's still a witness against him on the day of judgment that they stop to honor the Lord and instead of honoring them they actually defame the Lord that's right God to make all things praised and that was one of the most powerful quotes I've heard on it okay now like I said you could take weeks weeks and just preach on Christmas I don't want to do that I just want to take one day I just want to take one message on it okay now here's what I want to say here's the part so listen carefully here's the part I want you to watch with any Christmas tradition that you have make sure you're not greedy and covetous wanting gifts that's a program called gift swapping commercial day oh this is the time I'm going to finally catch up on my finances and I'll get some more gift cards I can catch up you know that's the wrong attitude that's looking at other people for your supply rather than God it's your supplier we need to look at Jesus Christ so we don't want to be greedy or covet just one thing gifts from others we also don't want to be prideful feeling like we have to give gifts to everybody and we have to match to the amount they gave well he gave me a $20 gift card I got to give him $21 to top him because that's the pride of life here's another one I mentioned if you go to Christmas parties especially family parties be careful what you eat and drink the Bible says be temperate all things so for example we don't want to get drunk of course but we also don't want to overeat and be a glutton in front of our family is that a good Christian testimony my brother Jesse can really put down those those soda pops mine and he's over there belch and burping watching the football game can you imagine that that would be a backslidden preacher if I ever seen one but I don't do that and the times I've gone to my family's on Christmas if they're watching TV and you can ask my children I ask them to leave the room I don't sit there and watch that that's nonsense because let your moderation be known unto all men everyone should know how much self-control you have because I'll tell you it's easy with the big screen to kind of sit down and talking pretty soon or husband off the children and pretty soon give me another doctor because you can't get your eyes off that thing you understand it's so seductive it's it's so it's so much a pleasure to the flesh you really got to be careful a family event that's me now I'm talking to me I'm preaching to me that's why I despise many times or I shouldn't say despise I should save it that's why many times I regret and I really don't want to go to family parties because it puts so much pressure on the children they're just children they you know they want to see if it's Frosty the Snowman or something like that now thankfully we usually don't travel for Christmas thankfully but in the years we have it's always been such a battle and it's an area I just don't enjoy I don't enjoy going to places where there's big screen TVs because these eyes get tempted to church these eyes that's hard for me I've got to make sure I've got to make sure I always put good things before my eyes I'm a man just like anyone else so the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes we got to make sure we don't get into that we're like if it's your work party and they start putting on dance you know rock and roll you want to go out there and dance you know to rock and roll or something like see there's that temptation the Bible says avoid all parents of evil if you possibly can we should avoid all appearance of evil and of course we said it earlier kissing under the mistletoe and all this kind of stuff and here the and here's the one thing I want to make sure too brother Branham said I never did steal anything in my life other than one thing does anyone know what he stole but the RAM said I stole God's time in other words instead of giving his office time to Christ he spent his time on Sunday mornings washing his ford remember that he said how many souls cuz I could I been saving on Sunday mornings before he was a Christian uh he said I stole God's time God gave me all this time but I was investing in it too shining my Ford on Sunday mornings while giving my Ford a car wash and so see that's what I'm saying like if you're putting up a tree if you're wrapping all these gifts you should leave have Christian music honor something like that to kind of redeem the time so like let's say let's say uh you know family spends two hours you know putting up the Christmas tree well how much time do they read the Bible that day do they even read the Bible you know but see if you got Christian music on and you're singing and put up a tree well that's fine you know that's fine or have a sermon on a brother branham you know you can put the one on where he talks about having a tree you can listen to that sermon so see that's the thing you also want to watch with even Christmas parties or family parts we spend all these things all these time at parties but are we given God time so we got to watch that but see that's why I love when Christmas falls on Sunday or not you know if it falls on Sunday I'll never skip Church this is God's house Christmas is all about God why would you leave God's house when it's all about God who's more important your family or God God's more important but see it's it's it's about worship it's about yes I think it's possible you could I I worship by wrapping gifts for the kids I think say thank you Lord for these children may these books guide them to Christ may these clothes close their body modestly may they glorify Christ may these toys help them to have fun use their imagination enjoy being a child until the days come when they're an adult and all the pressures and stresses and all the responsibilities of life come rushing in on them help them enjoy being a child enjoy their youth the Bible says enjoy their youth my goodness it's a sacred hour Christmas should be a sacred time I want to make don't miss anything did you know this brother branham in 1963 the church at Browns have an act called bought brother branham a brand new suit and he thanked the church he said thank you Church I got the quarter who I just heard it today he said but you know if it's possible can I take that suit back so I can buy some undershirts he said my undershirts in a really bad condition he said is that ok so he just he thanked he thanked he thanked them for the gift but said I could actually I really don't need suits right now could got take him back and get some undershirts he was just being humid with him he was just being real and to me that's like frugal right he's being frugal which is good like that's good now if you got me something I might not tell you that cuz I might I feel bad you know I just might keep the suit or whatever but he was just so homely and so at home with them and so I had such a good rapport with them you know or maybe his MS makeup was like that where he could just speak anything you know which it probably was he said can you mind if I take this back and get some undershirts oh my that's we love about brother Brennan just a godly Christian all right let me say this - so I told you about my Christmas I never missed Church oh my wife does put up lights we decorate a little bit you know but we don't do trees so she'll put a you know on our stairs we have a stairs and we have that little post that you can put your hand on when you walk up she'll put lights around that one set of lights and then on our little deck out there she'll put one thing of lights going across the deck just because it's so dark and cold in wintertime and lights look so pretty so and that's that's all we do church that's all we do I mean we do the presents and we all right we already got some ordered I know where the hiding place is I know where they're ordered you know some of them are all ready to go and Satan Claus did not bring the presents [Laughter] mom and dad buy the presents and every time when we do it you can ask Malachi and Linda in case you every time I say these gifts like I do with on Christmas these gifts are just representations letting you know that one time God gave the greatest gift ever and that was his son Jesus Christ this is just helping you to feel and church and I remember being a child man I remember the joy I got when I opened up my GI Joe airplane I was like yeah but that joy is nothing compared to when Brenda got healed I said glory amen right so this is you can't even compare it but that helped me understand oh that's a childish thing that helps you to understand at all yes adults can get happy too I know you praise the Lord we can get happy too well we get happy in different things when I was a child I enjoyed childish things but when I became a man I put away childish things and I became a real Christian man now I got to enjoy the Lord amen so we always sing we always worship we always read scripture we draw up Jesus pictures on the gifts wrapping paper no Santa no tree that just us now Santa's a sin but trees Teresa area of Liberty at least in my opinion does that help Church does that help all right few more things I want to share here few more things that's just how we do it now like I said church you know if I'm wrong you know let me know I just don't see it wrong because I feel like if if it was such an awful thing to celebrate Christmas then why did God let brother brand do it all the way to the day he died Billy Paul and Peregrine both said that car that he got in the car accident or the other car had Christmas presents because they were driving back to Jeffersonville and he had Christmas presents in the car he was going to give to his family so it's something he did to the end of his days and he was a man that was full of the Holy Ghost all right now let me let me do this here let me go a little bit further here I want to show you the harshest quotes I've heard on Christmas and then I want to show you how they balance out and brother Simon read one of them and you know he hopefully he'll listen to this but this is just you know but he doesn't have to it's just you know we just differ on that but let me say like this Christmas if done wrong is pagan but Christmas if it's done right is sacred do you understand so like we'll get to that too but if he zekiel eight just a moment but here's though here's the most harshest quote I've ever heard on Christmas brother branham said this in 1963 December 16th he said say I want to follow Christ and I want to follow the morning star Christ I want to follow and find my Jesus this day I want to get away from all this Christmas tinsel and things because some day it's going to be burnt with unquenchable fire right how many can say amen to that amen it is trees presents the clothes have everything's gonna be burnt now look and program says and all those who are in tolerating with it that means partaking of it will be burned with it now look what do you know let's keep going the world the sinner will be punished be they will be they will perish with the world the worldly loving people will perish with the world and if you have those still have the love of the world in you and you want to sell yourself completely tonight to Jesus Christ in his word raise your hand so brother hand says if you tolerate Christmas you're gonna burn with Christmas and then he says these are this is for sinners okay that's pretty right but let's go a little bit earlier in the sermon so we understand what he's saying but the Branham says this he says the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ should be reflecting the light of him while he is absent from the earth in a physical body the church should be the reflection of Jesus Christ in these dark hours when says I keep saying Santa cause I'm gonna said Satan Claus when say Santa Claus and tinsel all over the street he said we should scream how it's the birth of Jesus Christ and not the visit of Saint Nicholas Amen brother said we should scream that out of Christmas time it's about the birth of Jesus not Saint Nicholas he said we should scream that out that was earlier in the sermon Rota have said later in the sermon he says still Christians should be holding forth that light that there's a truth to Christmas that is the birth of Jesus Christ the Son of God so brother Adam did you catch that should be holding the light out that there is the truth of Christmas not not getting a writ of Christmas but holding the truth of Christmas that Jesus Christ is the son of God now at the end of that sermon where he gave the harshest rebuke he says I am wishing you the very Mary's of Christmas that God will send his star from the east that rose in the east nineteen hundred years ago and will guide you to the Word made flesh all right I think that's what I wanted to show you in church like I said there's so many scriptures I'm sorry so that harshest quote was December 16 1963 and many of those quotes I read after you where he's thanking people for gifts or talking about giving gifts with his wife and receiving chocolates and all these things all those are after the harshest sermon or the harshest words he ever said about it so what am I saying I am saying that when brother Branham said unquenchable fire he's talking about sinners who mix Christmas with getting drunk gift swapping pride covetousness greed and envy does everyone understand what I'm saying is that when we this is what I believe when I my family celebrate Christmas we are doing Christmas in truth and not according to the pagan as' of the club the sinners and so that quote to me where Bram says they're gonna burn he's talking about sinners I know about I know I know about you you're not a sinner you're a saint I'm not enough to say well I don't know about you I know you're Saints everybody here tonight is a saint I don't know where the children is the hell that all that you understand you know I know for sure us adults were Saints you're a saint you live the life if you didn't you probably left already so see we live the life we're the saints of the Most High God and you you and I can partake in Christmas traditions liberties as long as they don't cause anybody stumble now if let me let me say this if in January of next year if the Lord tarries and someone would come to me in this church after I preached this and they would say well you know brother Jesse your sermon caused me to stumble because you do Christmas gifts and I went out and bought you know I overspent and bought three thousand dollars on Christmas gifts and I went to debt and I got I got bankrupt I might first what's wrong with you but after that I might say well I might consider not giving gifts but I have to sit down with that person in other words I don't want to cause anybody stumble I don't know how what I'm doing could cause somebody to stumble that's probably the only thing I could think of how is putting up two lights causing people to stumble I don't think it is how is putting up a nativity set causing people to stumble now if I said I was bowing down worshipping that nativity set that would be different but it's Fisher Price colored plastic and I don't bow down to that nativity set and I don't go broke on Christmas I'll show you the receipts I don't spend a whole lot of money on Christmas gifts I gave a lot more than one tithe check than I do for Christmas gifts and I'll prove that I can prove that to you if you want to see my receipts I'll prove that to you just let me know or at least in a month in one month I get more in tithes and offerings that I ever spend at Christmas time ever because those books are not very expensive neither are the clothes and the toys are usually very not expensive either and then grandma helps out with the toys but I give you my word I know with all my heart I give more in one month ties and offerings then I ever spent any Christmas time ever I give more of myself to Jesus Christ let's say into our feet here you know and I know I don't want to spend a lot of sermons on this because to me like I said it's an area of Liberty just make sure you're you and I are not causing people to stumble and especially with Christmas making sure we're not causing ourselves to stumble and children to stumble like if you buy a child a sinful toy or a sinful book with sinful things in it they're gonna turn out sinful and we've got to make sure we don't allow ourselves like I said to get trapped to sucked into family worship where we're not worshipping God or where it's worshiping the devil with either gluttony or evil movies or sports or TV shows and things like that we have to make sure we keep ourselves pure in the fear of God all right but okay now the last thing I want to say is remember about Simon preach Ezekiel eight that was an awesome awesome message there was four steps remember the four steps I don't know if you do or not the first one was the images on the outside of the church remember that the second one was I don't remember the second one oh the creeping things yeah the third one was the women weeping for Tammuz member Tamara's Tammuz was one of these son gods and so brother Simon was likened unto that how the Roman Catholic Church which that's what that story is about the Antichrist spear in the Roman Catholic Church the Roman Catholic Church worships the Sun God on December 25th and let me say like this they do but if you and I with our Christian liberties just give gifts to our kids and a couple of our friends at Christian friends we are not partaking of Tammuz because brother branham gave gifts brother branham received gifts brother branham had a tree so does everybody understand what I'm saying Tammuz that brother that brother Simon tied and that's very true if people give out whiskey if people give out deck of cards on Christmas yes they are worshipping Tammuz they're worshiping a Sun God a false God they're worshipping this false idea of pagan Christianity but if you and I on our Christian Liberty are just giving things from the kindness of our heart if it's a sacred day to us if we don't skip church on Christmas which none of you ever have as far as I know if we don't skip Church and and well we don't give our tithes and offerings so we could buy some whiskey or give get people some extra you know gifts or something like that if we don't rob if we rob God yes then we're sinning but if we don't and if we honor all the commands of God and still do some of these traditions or customs then we're not worshiping Tammis we're not partaking of that we're just enjoying Christian Liberty amen all right so church now you got a license I and I believe brother I believe brother Aaron might do this then when we go to Johnny go on Christmas time I believe brother Aaron might shout out because rubber band says we need to shout out because he's got a big deep voice he said we should scream out it's the birth of Jesus Christ and not the visit of Saint Nicholas amen I like how our brother is real bold in public I like that that's real that's that's a part of his character God's given him that he's supposed to always represent Christ everywhere he goes but church that's the reality somebody tells you Merry Christmas say Oh Merry Christmas praise God that He sent His Holy Synod eye for us that's what we say Merry Christmas thank God today we say Christ was born in the City of David just mentioned Christ just breathe just say that holy name Jesus and watch that name come on the scene amen watch the spirit of that name the Holy Spirit come on the scene thank God Merry Christmas thank God that he sent His Son Jesus Christ one right there right now you're gonna find out what they believe about Christmas whether they're on the Tammuz side or on the real side the sacred side on their unholy side are they on the holy side I believe brother Branham was on the holy side and I believe my family is on the holy side that's just that's my opinion that's my understanding to it please if you have a question feel free to ask me if you differ with me please just love me just just pray for me and love me if you disagree with me that's just what I believe and I believe I got quotes and scriptures to back that up like I said I got the scriptures about Christian liberties and all these things by the grace of the Lord all right let's sing that song o come let us adore him o come all ye faithful can we see that tonight I like singing it all throughout the year praise God amen I don't I know I'm Christmas some people you know they like to just sing it them I like to sing it all year round o come all ye

person here about how they'll handle Christmas or Thanksgiving or Easter or that we would just line our lives up with the Word of God remember all these holy days and things they were just shadows of things to come and that thing to come was the greatest Christmas gift ever the baptism of the holy ghost who you thank you the spirit of that baby the Holy Spirit as a seal in the soul of the believer unto the day of their Redemption dear God thank you Lord and your promise that is the only Christmas gift that's real a true gift is the Holy Spirit oh let let us hunger and thirst for that seal if

about Christmas gifts although that's good for kids Lord but lord may we as adults have more excitement about healings and Lord testimonies the Holy Ghost move and the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues are prophesying or healing somebody we have more joy and excitement about that the real gift of God then these natural things God that will perish one day that will burn in a fire Lord God oh thank
