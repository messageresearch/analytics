[23:22] requests and just rejoicing and
[23:25] our god is a good and gracious king
[23:28] praise god he's so gracious to us so
[23:29] merciful
[23:32] brother brahma said the marriage and
[23:33] divorce message why shouldn't you love
[23:35] him
[23:37] after all he's done for you why
[23:38] shouldn't you love him
[23:57] [Music]
[23:59] appreciate those songs brother thanks uh
[24:01] children for the
[24:02] music work there praise god let's take a
[24:04] few prayer requests here
[24:06] let's remember david hawkins he's
[24:08] brian's son i think he's what 19 or 20.
[24:11] anyways he went to the marines he had
[24:14] told me last time he was here
[24:16] he preached one time for us and then he
[24:18] said he felt led
[24:19] like he needs more experience in life
[24:22] before he preaches so
[24:23] uh he didn't preach the last time he was
[24:25] here but then he went into the marines
[24:27] his dad of course was in the military
[24:29] i'm not sure which branch
[24:31] air force okay thank you darth my wife
[24:33] remembers all those good details that i
[24:35] don't
[24:35] i don't remember i knew it was military
[24:39] uh but anyways let's remember him uh you
[24:41] know
[24:43] help him uh his witness there amongst
[24:45] the marines as he's in boot camp but
[24:47] also
[24:48] the hawkins family they're missing their
[24:50] son no doubt
[24:51] and no doubt their hearts are
[24:54] heavy at this time let's remember uh
[24:57] brother
[24:58] amen's workplace somebody had covet at
[25:01] brother amen's workplace
[25:02] so let's remember everybody there and
[25:04] also god will protect by the amen
[25:06] by god's grace and also let's just pray
[25:08] amen gets good rest here by the grace of
[25:10] the lord
[25:11] also brother donnie reagan got
[25:13] coronavirus as well so let's remember
[25:15] him in prayer
[25:16] the other preacher at his church daryl
[25:19] ward has it as well in fact his whole
[25:21] family has it
[25:22] um you know so far they're doing okay by
[25:24] god's grace
[25:25] they're just at home kind of quarantined
[25:27] let's remember them in the word of
[25:28] prayer
[25:29] also let's remember the upcoming
[25:32] presidential election you saw
[25:34] the vice president a democratic person
[25:36] was chosen and
[25:38] billy graham's son put out a post she's
[25:39] the most pro-abortion senator
[25:43] i think to date she's out of california
[25:46] so
[25:47] let's just remember that ask the lord to
[25:49] direct us and
[25:50] give us righteous leaders because
[25:51] righteousness exalts a nation
[25:53] that's why america is what it is today
[25:55] but of course we know it's backslidden
[25:56] but let's just pray for god to
[26:00] withhold the evil we know he will
[26:03] and he does it in long-suffering that
[26:06] people might be saved so let's remember
[26:07] those
[26:08] in a word of prayer does anybody else
[26:09] have any other requests they'd like to
[26:10] be remembered
[26:14] haven all right praise god
[26:18] also i heard from brother uh austin i
[26:21] shouldn't say brother
[26:22] i want to make sure he's saved first but
[26:24] our friend austin and he said
[26:26] he's feeding on our sermons so i said
[26:28] well go ahead send your tithes you know
[26:30] if you don't have a home church and
[26:32] um so i just told him to go ahead and do
[26:33] that if he's feeding so hopefully lord
[26:36] bless you austin my friend and uh
[26:38] hopefully he gets a chance to watch this
[26:40] um so let's bow our heads in a word of
[26:43] prayer amen
[26:46] the fervent prayer of a righteous man or
[26:48] woman avails much
[26:50] it prevails much so let's believe that
[26:52] let's be uh
[26:54] encouraged with that that god hears our
[26:56] fervent faithful prayers

[32:00] one
[32:00] two three wherefore if god so clothed
[32:04] the grass of the field
[32:06] which today is and tomorrow is cast
[32:09] into the oven shall he not much more
[32:12] clothe you
[32:13] o ye of little faith therefore take no
[32:17] thought saying what shall we eat or what
[32:20] shall we drink
[32:21] or wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[32:24] after
[32:25] all these things do the gentiles seek
[32:27] for your heavenly father
[32:29] knoweth that ye have need of all these
[32:31] things
[32:32] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[32:35] his righteousness
[32:37] and all these things shall be added unto
[32:39] you
[32:40] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[32:42] for the morrow shall take thought for
[32:44] the things of itself
[32:46] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[32:48] thereof may god has blessings to read of
[32:50] his word you may be seated
[32:52] so let's not worry about thursday praise
[32:54] god let's focus
[32:56] on wednesday night praise god amen
[32:58] hallelujah
[33:00] that's just an in good encouragement i
[33:02] know on my to-do list i don't know about
[33:03] yours but i already got lots of things
[33:05] for tomorrow but
[33:06] i'm just going to forget about that and
[33:07] let's uh let's focus on the word of god
[33:09] praise the lord
[33:11] just real quick i did post a new video
[33:12] today on youtube uh i had
[33:14] two questions about water baptism and i
[33:16] thought i could put together a video
[33:18] real fast so i did can't or does
[33:21] water baptism the answer is no of course
[33:24] grace saves you
[33:25] by faith uh so i share brother bran's
[33:28] quotes on there plus the scriptures
[33:30] and can you get the holy ghost baptism
[33:32] in your soul before you're baptized in
[33:34] water the answer is yes
[33:35] and that's in acts chapter 10 cornelius
[33:37] in his house got the baptism in the soul
[33:39] before they got the water baptism we're
[33:42] not sure maybe they didn't know about
[33:43] the baptism
[33:44] uh maybe it was like the ephesians in
[33:46] acts chapter 16
[33:47] or maybe they had no preacher to baptize
[33:49] him there
[33:50] at cornelius house but either way they
[33:53] were justified sanctified
[33:54] and they weren't even baptized in water
[33:56] but they got the holy ghost while peter
[33:58] yet preached those words
[34:00] and then he commanded them go be
[34:01] baptized and they were baptized
[34:03] so those are it's just a nine minute
[34:05] video um
[34:06] by god's grace we're up to uh 11 04
[34:10] subscribers
[34:12] just to encourage you i'd like to read
[34:13] that and we have almost a million
[34:15] views we're at 982 000.
[34:19] so we're almost at a million our website
[34:21] currently has 70 000 views since we
[34:23] started it in uh
[34:24] 2014 i think so i was just checking some
[34:27] numbers just encourage you
[34:28] you never know who's going to get on
[34:29] there and i like i said about every week
[34:31] we get a nice testimony from there that
[34:34] god is
[34:34] reaching people for the kingdom of god
[34:37] so we're thankful
[34:38] praise god it's our duty like we're
[34:40] fulfilling that scripture church
[34:42] uh prophesy again to many nations
[34:45] kingdoms and tongues if we can't go
[34:47] we'll put it on the internet because we
[34:48] know the internet will probably get
[34:49] there
[34:51] and i and like i told you my whole life
[34:53] i told you this since i've been a pastor
[34:54] my desire if the lord terry's is to
[34:56] retire and then i'll set some pastor
[34:58] here and i'll go preach out
[35:00] to the nations that's my desire now i'm
[35:02] not saying i'll do that but that's what
[35:03] i want to do
[35:04] uh i want to go be a missionary i want
[35:06] to go preach a lot of it will probably
[35:08] be evangelism you know
[35:09] we're just going to establish churches
[35:11] and then trying to work out
[35:12] uh where people never heard it but i
[35:14] don't know what god will do but god
[35:16] knows my heart i want to do
[35:17] something for the kingdom of god uh
[35:19] after this but i love
[35:21] pastor and i love this uh this gift i
[35:23] love just staying in the word of god
[35:24] don't you
[35:25] i love saying the channel of the word
[35:27] just meditating on it and just seeing
[35:29] more and more scriptures tied together
[35:31] that's what brother bam's message did it
[35:32] finished the mystery of god
[35:34] it took all the loose ends and all the
[35:35] mysteries that were out there through
[35:37] all the ages and brought them back
[35:38] together into one
[35:40] finished mystery of god amen we're so
[35:43] blessed church
[35:44] to have these uh facts these brother man
[35:46] calls them bible facts
[35:49] bible revelations restored to us so let
[35:51] me set the
[35:52] timer here and we'll be getting quickly
[35:55] here to uh uh the message we'll bring it
[35:59] up here
[36:00] by god's grace okay 40 minutes all right
[36:04] so uh we're starting here we're picking
[36:06] up where we left off
[36:07] uh we left off with jesus uh
[36:10] giving eight woes to the pharisees
[36:14] uh because of their iniquity they
[36:16] continually worked it
[36:17] and we find them here now uh that was
[36:20] matthew 23 so that was the week before
[36:22] uh they crucified christ about a week
[36:24] and a half two weeks before they
[36:25] crucified christ
[36:29] and so a week and a half later after
[36:31] giving eight woes upon them
[36:33] the workers of iniquity crucify him they
[36:36] deliver him up to be crucified
[36:38] and there's great depths of meaning
[36:40] brother brand taught us
[36:41] in the indictment with there they
[36:44] crucified him there
[36:45] the jerusalem the most holy place on
[36:48] earth
[36:49] they the world's most powerful
[36:50] government rome agreed with judaism the
[36:53] most holy people on earth
[36:55] crucified the most gruesome tortuous
[36:58] painful death him the world's most holy
[37:01] innocent
[37:02] perfect person jesus christ this
[37:05] shows us the extreme wickedness that the
[37:08] workers of iniquity
[37:09] always go to so church we
[37:12] we know it's true today as well right
[37:14] because jesus christ is the same
[37:16] yesterday today and forever
[37:17] demons don't die they keep living the
[37:19] most religious
[37:20] people will commit the most wicked
[37:23] crimes
[37:24] against the most holy person they claim
[37:26] to love
[37:27] let it not be us church because let me
[37:29] say it like this i want to be
[37:31] the most religious person right i want
[37:33] to be i want to be but i want to be
[37:34] sincere with it
[37:36] because remember james 1 says you must
[37:38] have pure religion how do you remember
[37:40] the scripture
[37:41] we must have pure religion there's
[37:43] nothing wrong with religion religion is
[37:44] a good thing
[37:45] but see uh the workers of iniquity have
[37:48] perverted religion
[37:50] and they don't have the anointing of the
[37:51] holy spirit for their religion it's
[37:53] scriptural
[37:54] pure religion is remember giving to the
[37:55] poor and visiting the childless and the
[37:58] fatherless
[37:59] uh though that's pure religion before
[38:01] god keeping your tongue
[38:02] undefiled amen pure religion before god
[38:07] james says
[38:08] so see church uh how did israel get to
[38:11] this condition to crucify their
[38:13] very own messiah it was slow spreading
[38:16] of
[38:16] sin until it you know maybe it was first
[38:20] compromising on their their fasting or
[38:22] you know or on their prayer but pretty
[38:24] soon it spread to their entire
[38:26] uh religious experience it went from all
[38:29] the way to the high priest all the way
[38:31] down
[38:32] uh to the to the child to the mother
[38:34] right to
[38:35] you name it the janitor we'd say from
[38:37] the pulpit to the janitor brother
[38:38] branham says
[38:39] it was just spread slowly but now
[38:43] in the book of hebrews you know hebrews
[38:46] 6 1-8
[38:48] it teaches jesus is crucified daily
[38:51] now so beginning even after
[38:54] he raised and resurrected sent the holy
[38:56] ghost the hebrews writer
[38:58] says he's crucified afresh daily not
[39:01] physically but spiritually spiritually
[39:04] through workers of iniquity who disobey
[39:07] the truth of god and then teach others
[39:09] to do the same
[39:11] oh my he's presently christ's spirit is
[39:14] presently crucified
[39:16] the effects of his holy spirit are
[39:18] crucified
[39:19] the cleansing effects and the people
[39:22] temporarily experience god's blessings
[39:25] only to publicly disobey his teaching
[39:28] at a later time jesus calls them thorn
[39:31] bushes
[39:32] he says they produce sharp prickly
[39:35] thorns
[39:36] you ever been around people like that
[39:37] message churches it's not
[39:39] it's not gentle it's not gentle it's not
[39:41] a gentle experience to be around them
[39:44] it's sharp and pricky prickly right
[39:47] oh my goodness i don't like i don't like
[39:48] i'm gonna go talk to somebody else right
[39:50] now in the parking lot uh you know
[39:53] that's what jesus says they're like
[39:55] being around them is not easy it's hard
[39:58] it's it's we'd say it's violent right
[40:00] it's it's contentious right
[40:03] it's a hard thing to do
[40:06] uh but we see it
[40:09] that the religious uh they enjoy the
[40:12] blessings and feelings of god's spirit
[40:14] but they commit
[40:15] sharp despicable iniquities like judas
[40:18] that sharp judas kiss right it's a
[40:21] betrayal
[40:22] it looks nice but it's sharp and it's a
[40:25] sharp
[40:26] betrayal it's a sharp rebuke he kisses
[40:28] the very one
[40:29] that he really despises
[40:32] that's hebrews 6 1-8
[40:35] they have a temporary rain they receive
[40:38] the rain temporarily but then they
[40:39] produce sharp
[40:40] uh rebukes or betrayals against the very
[40:43] word that they claim to love
[40:45] hebrews 9 29 describes their crucifixion
[40:49] as smashing it under their feet
[40:52] the bible says of how much sore
[40:54] punishment shall he be thought worthy
[40:56] who hath trotted under foot the son of
[40:58] god
[40:58] and hath counted the blood of the
[41:00] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[41:02] an unholy thing and had done despite the
[41:05] spirit of grace
[41:07] church very sore punishments await those
[41:10] who deny
[41:11] the works of the holy spirit this
[41:13] continual sanctification we're enjoying
[41:15] now
[41:15] we enjoy it praise god but the workers
[41:18] of iniquity despise it so they leave it
[41:20] and because they leave the good
[41:23] sanctifying effects of god
[41:25] they get the sore or the more harsh
[41:27] punishments
[41:28] because church god's spirit god's
[41:30] gracious spirit is leading us
[41:32] to a sanctified life not a sinful
[41:35] disobedient one now listen church
[41:39] i always say like this i rejoice in this
[41:42] there's going to be something under your
[41:43] feet
[41:44] either the devils are going to be under
[41:46] your feet praise god
[41:48] that's us amen there's satan's under our
[41:51] feet or the word is going to be
[41:52] crucified under our feet amen
[41:54] i say like romans 1 says satan will be
[41:57] shortly under your feet praise god
[42:00] that was paul's prayer for the church in
[42:02] rome that satan would shortly be under
[42:04] their feet which means they overcome
[42:06] which means they have authority over
[42:08] demon powers amen
[42:10] they cast down as we said at last on
[42:11] sunday they cast on any thought that
[42:13] exalts itself against the word of god
[42:15] amen
[42:17] glory i'm so glad about it praise god
[42:21] remember jesus's feet in revelation 1.
[42:23] remember they were feet of
[42:24] brass which means he took the judgments
[42:27] of god hallelujah
[42:29] he walked through the fires of god
[42:31] judgment so
[42:32] all sin is under his feet praise god he
[42:35] bore the shame of all the
[42:37] all the pain and all the guilt and so we
[42:39] can be free from it
[42:40] and because his feet walked over the
[42:43] fiery judgments of god
[42:44] our feet can rule over those demon
[42:47] powers amen
[42:48] our feet can rule over the guilt and the
[42:50] shame of our past life
[42:52] or our current struggles we can get
[42:54] victory over them and we can have satan
[42:56] under our feet praise god
[42:58] let's be a victor in christ amen let's
[43:00] put devils under our feet let that be
[43:02] our testimony amen
[43:04] let me say like this let's keep covered
[43:06] under our feet praise god
[43:08] hallelujah let's keep a doubt away
[43:11] praise
[43:12] god let's keep the lust and the greed
[43:14] and the
[43:15] the the confusion and the division and
[43:18] the anger and the wrath let's keep that
[43:20] under our feet praise god
[43:21] amen that's what the bible says
[43:23] something will be under our feet
[43:25] let's have it devils under our feet in
[43:26] jesus name
[43:28] you know church here's some good
[43:29] examples you've seen it you know judas
[43:32] and church there i don't know if you've
[43:33] been watching it over the last few years
[43:34] there's been numerous
[43:36] preachers that are dominational leave
[43:38] the
[43:39] just leave christianity there's been
[43:41] numerous song leaders i'm sure my wife
[43:42] and i we talk about it from time to time
[43:44] that used to be worship leaders so mega
[43:46] churches now denominational or
[43:48] independent and all of a sudden they'll
[43:50] just put on their instagram i no longer
[43:52] believe i no longer believe
[43:54] the most uh the most well well known to
[43:57] me was a
[43:58] was a preacher who wrote a book that i
[44:00] read called i kiss dating goodbye
[44:03] cam and i read that when cam first got
[44:05] saved he read that book because he was
[44:07] he wanted a godly
[44:08] wife and then after reading that book he
[44:10] wrote eight things he wanted his wife
[44:12] and hung it up i imagine julia was
[44:13] probably like
[44:14] more than eight probably like 20 things
[44:16] he he wanted
[44:18] because god's so good he gives you more
[44:19] than you ask or think is that right
[44:22] amen well i read that you know when my
[44:24] wife and i you know we first became
[44:25] christians
[44:27] and it was a great book it was all about
[44:29] holiness in fact it would
[44:30] it caused a lot of scandal just in
[44:32] denominational churches because they
[44:34] thought it was legalism but it was love
[44:36] the man wrote a good book christians
[44:38] don't date they're supposed to court in
[44:40] in preparation for marriage it's a great
[44:42] book
[44:43] well the man last year came out on his
[44:45] thing and said you know i was real
[44:47] arrogant when i wrote that
[44:48] and now he's for homosexuality and all
[44:50] these things like that church he's done
[44:51] it
[44:52] i'm i'm not judging him but it looks
[44:53] like he's publicly disgraced
[44:56] and put to shame the god who sanctified
[44:59] him
[45:00] and he got divorced and you know just an
[45:02] awful mess
[45:04] you know he's in other words he was
[45:06] saved he was sanctified at least in his
[45:08] marriage relationship
[45:09] uh you know to live a a godly courtship
[45:12] get married uh publicly but then turn
[45:15] around and deny it and walk away
[45:17] he's in danger of putting christ under
[45:20] his feet
[45:21] so let's not be like that let's not walk
[45:23] away from the word of god
[45:24] let's walk in the word of god and let's
[45:27] put devils under our feet praise god
[45:29] amen
[45:30] just a good example that i thought i'd
[45:32] share a book i read around
[45:34] it would have been around uh 2000 2001
[45:36] or 2002 right before i heard the message
[45:39] a book that helped me in our my wife and
[45:41] i our courtship of course we were dating
[45:43] until we knew there i didn't even know
[45:44] there was a thing called courtship
[45:46] but uh eventually god let us know by the
[45:49] grace of god which was so wonderful
[45:52] so see church that's just one example
[45:54] you see it all the time now you can
[45:55] bring it to the message where people
[45:56] walk away from the message
[45:58] and then they speak evil brother branham
[46:00] the bible said touch not mine anointed
[46:02] and do my prophets no harm some of them
[46:06] you know we i haven't seen
[46:07] you know any judgments strike the people
[46:09] that have left i haven't seen it
[46:11] but they may be awaited for judgment day
[46:13] i don't know
[46:14] but to look at god's man a god's prophet
[46:16] and then call him a liar and make fun of
[46:18] him and mock him
[46:19] there's going to be some awful things on
[46:21] the day of judgment for people that will
[46:22] do that
[46:23] a man that will speak god's word a man
[46:25] that will tell you the bible revelations
[46:27] he'll leave his wife and go around the
[46:29] world and preach and
[46:30] and travel weeks upon end and he'll
[46:33] minister till he
[46:34] loses his strength and loses his mind
[46:36] almost
[46:37] just to help people because he loves
[46:39] them so much and to look upon a
[46:41] christ-like ministry like that
[46:43] where a u.s representative gets out of a
[46:46] wheelchair and walks
[46:48] praise god that's that's the holy spirit
[46:50] amen hallelujah
[46:52] that's the man of god hallelujah and to
[46:54] speak evil against that god be merciful
[46:57] but they're in danger of of smashing
[46:59] under foot
[47:01] the christ that once sanctified them
[47:06] see church you and i know you can
[47:07] temporarily enjoy god's grace but then
[47:10] fail to let it continue
[47:11] but the bible says this grace will never
[47:14] fail you and i
[47:16] the sinners will fail grace but grace
[47:18] will never fail you and i
[47:20] hallelujah the bible says looking
[47:22] diligently lest any man
[47:24] fail the grace of god lest any root of
[47:27] bitterness springing up trouble you
[47:29] and thereby many be defiled see church
[47:32] i've seen it with a couple of the people
[47:34] that left the message because i listened
[47:35] to their podcast in order to know how to
[47:38] answer them hopefully i'll do okay by
[47:39] god's grace
[47:40] i'm trusting in the holy spirit for next
[47:41] month's debate i'm trusting in the holy
[47:43] spirit
[47:44] but listen and i can hear how they're
[47:46] bitter against message believers or
[47:48] they're bitter against brother branham
[47:49] and what the bible say they fail god's
[47:52] grace
[47:52] when they let a root of bitterness grow
[47:55] up in their heart and
[47:56] instead of having a nice a nice heart
[47:59] where
[47:59] there's there's no there's no weeds
[48:01] there's no thorns
[48:02] it's a good ground where fruits of the
[48:04] holy spirit can grow instead of having
[48:06] that
[48:07] weeds have sprung up and choke the life
[48:09] of the word
[48:10] and the word can't produce what it's
[48:12] supposed to produce it's supposed to
[48:13] produce love amen
[48:15] it's supposed to produce patience it's
[48:17] supposed to produce long suffering
[48:19] it's supposed to produce all these godly
[48:21] attributes that we need
[48:23] but instead roots of bitterness choke it
[48:25] out and you don't no longer feel as
[48:27] clean and pure as you used to
[48:29] god help us to weed out unbelief weed
[48:32] out bitterness right
[48:33] and let the let the love of god let the
[48:36] seed of god's love
[48:37] produce the fruits of the holy spirit
[48:39] that people can see our lives are
[48:40] sincere and genuine
[48:42] and real christian fruits praise god
[48:46] amen
[48:48] see it's all about that seed right
[48:52] roots of bitterness a seed of bitterness
[48:54] right grows up
[48:56] and it chokes the seed of the word of
[48:58] god
[49:00] you know it church multitudes of
[49:02] preachers are
[49:03] currently crucifying the effects of the
[49:05] holy spirit not all
[49:07] but many paul says the ones who mention
[49:11] the cross
[49:12] are often enemies of the cross remember
[49:14] that scripture
[49:15] because their god is their belly we
[49:16] haven't got to it in philippians 3
[49:18] 18-19 can you hold it up there
[49:19] occasionally real quick we'll get there
[49:21] soon i think we just got to the end of
[49:22] chapter 2 on sunday right
[49:24] and we'll look to chapter 3 here soon
[49:26] isn't that something the very ones
[49:28] who preach about the cross are actually
[49:31] enemies of its effect
[49:36] for many walk of whom i have told you
[49:38] enough many were walking what about
[49:40] today
[49:40] many walked and were enemies of the
[49:43] cross in paul's day
[49:44] than most are today and now tell you
[49:47] even weeping that they are the enemies
[49:49] of the cross of christ
[49:50] whose end is destruction whose god is
[49:52] their belly and whose glory
[49:54] is in their shame who mine earthly
[49:57] things did you see that preacher

[50:16] together and she had like a
[50:18] short shirt on and he had like a drink
[50:21] alcohol
[50:22] it was just awful and this guy's
[50:24] supposed to be like a religious
[50:26] majority or yeah moral majority or
[50:29] something like that
[50:29] he's supposed to be a minister of the
[50:31] gospel that's a shame
[50:34] there that's the enemy of the cross the
[50:36] cross
[50:37] teaches holiness godliness in the fear
[50:40] of the lord amen
[50:42] it's the enemies of the cross what
[50:44] everybody's making all that money as a
[50:45] university president see
[50:47] if they're not for the cross they're
[50:49] against the cross
[50:54] how many preachers are enemies of the
[50:56] cross if many in paul's they were
[50:58] enemies
[51:00] how many are there today i don't want to
[51:03] be an enemy of the cross i want to carry
[51:05] the cross
[51:07] and i'm in saints i know what i'm asking
[51:09] for well jesse you're asking for a hard
[51:10] life i know i am
[51:12] but i don't want to be what those uh uh
[51:15] crucifiers of christ i don't want to be
[51:17] that so god you have my god you have my
[51:20] my requests and my humble my humble
[51:22] request
[51:22] just make make me a real follower of
[51:25] christ

[51:28] follow jesus
[51:29] amen don't let me get deceived don't let
[51:31] me get comfortable in the
[51:33] lust of the world the cares of life help
[51:35] me to be humble let me be a real servant
[51:37] of jesus praise god
[51:42] see they preach the cross for their
[51:45] belly and their wallet
[51:47] then deny the power to live a real
[51:50] christian life
[51:52] they give license for immorality and
[51:55] present an
[51:55] outwardly clean wealthy appearance but
[51:58] pull up jude 1
[51:59] 4 question would you jude foretold this
[52:02] my this is i think this was written
[52:04] right around the time of the book of
[52:05] revelation if i'm not mistaken on my
[52:06] date so i can look it up real quick here
[52:09] jude the book of jude
[52:10] yeah there is jude was written around
[52:15] oh no i'm sorry it was well before that
[52:17] 66 a.d okay so right after paul died
[52:19] paul died in 65.
[52:20] so this was written the year after paul
[52:22] died jude i believe he's the brother of
[52:24] jesus if i'm not mistaken
[52:27] yeah brother james jude
[52:31] 1 4 for there are certain men crept in
[52:33] unawares i look
[52:34] remember we said how last week how they
[52:35] creep into your house these men
[52:38] slowly now it's women too now with women
[52:40] preachers but amen
[52:41] creeping in unawares now be careful what
[52:44] you're listening to in your home church
[52:46] especially the preachers right
[52:50] who were before of old ordained of this
[52:52] condemnation so
[52:53] god foreknew their that they were going
[52:55] to do this
[52:56] ungodly men turning the grace of god
[52:59] into that means lawlessness
[53:01] the cheviousness means no law see we got
[53:04] the law of the holy spirit praise god
[53:07] and denying the only lord god and our
[53:10] lord jesus christ
[53:12] see they turn grace into lawlessness
[53:14] live however you want we're under grace
[53:17] and they they turn like that but the
[53:18] bible said they're ungodly men
[53:20] if they're not living a godly life
[53:22] they're not godly men paul says from
[53:28] such
[53:29] turn away turn away from this crowd
[53:33] real christians though die daily like
[53:36] paul said paul said
[53:37] i die daily and church we die to our
[53:41] selfish
[53:42] desires uh pull up luke 9 23
[53:46] jesus urged them he said take up your
[53:49] cross
[53:50] daily and follow me in fact he says if
[53:53] you can't do that
[53:54] you're not a real christian
[53:57] luke 9 23
[54:03] and he said to them oh if any man will
[54:05] come after me let him deny himself
[54:07] and take up his cross daily and follow
[54:09] me
[54:11] hallelujah paul says the proof
[54:15] of you belonging to christ is that you
[54:18] crucify and mortify
[54:21] he said the deeds and lusts of the flesh
[54:24] and of the world
[54:26] now listen i've said it before you'll
[54:27] either crucify god's word or you'll
[54:29] crucify
[54:30] your selfish lust with god's word let's
[54:33] kill our own sinful wills
[54:34] and let's do god's will let's keep doing
[54:37] it by the grace of god
[54:39] amen now that's all those are putting
[54:41] numerous scriptures together but if you
[54:42] put all those
[54:43] romans 8 12 galatians 5 24 galatians 6
[54:47] 13-15
[54:48] colossians 3 5 they will all say that
[54:51] real christians
[54:52] mortify and crucify the lust of the
[54:55] flesh
[54:56] and walk according to the spirit praise
[54:58] god amen
[55:00] hallelujah now next thought here how am
[55:04] i doing on time good 20 minutes all
[55:06] right
[55:07] that's half the time already praise god
[55:10] now church the next section i called you
[55:13] and i can recognize
[55:14] antichrist by their hell-deserving
[55:18] and non-kingdom works in other words you
[55:20] can recognize
[55:21] a corrupt tree by its fruit but i found
[55:24] specific scriptures and i'm just going
[55:26] to go through these kind of fast
[55:28] i have three scriptures or three
[55:31] sections of scriptures
[55:32] that list 36 sins of people that will go
[55:35] to hell
[55:37] and then i got another page with 37 of
[55:41] people that will not
[55:42] be in the kingdom of god
[55:46] so you ready for this everybody better
[55:48] take a deep breath
[55:49] you better get on your uh shock proof
[55:50] vest brother brandon calls it
[55:53] and in church if you if now listen we're
[55:55] all going to battle with some of these
[55:56] so let's be ready to confess all these
[55:58] praise god if there's if there's
[55:59] anything we've done
[56:00] let's be careful and ready to say god
[56:02] forgive me take this out of my life
[56:04] lord put it under my feet praise god let
[56:06] me do my part to cast down
[56:08] the imagination or the things i do or
[56:10] the lust or the desires help me to put
[56:13] that
[56:13] under the the feet in jesus name
[56:18] paul said antichrist will have a drastic
[56:21] increase waxing worse and worse
[56:24] but i love this he promised brother amen
[56:27] he said the holy scriptures he said
[56:29] will make you wise unto salvation amen
[56:32] so again what does it prove the wise
[56:35] virgin is wise
[56:36] and the wisdom of god takes her away
[56:38] from sin and makes her live righteously
[56:40] praise god
[56:41] that's all that's what it comes down to
[56:43] wise versus foolish praise god
[56:46] oh my i love it it's the wise versus
[56:49] foolish
[56:50] all through the this new testament
[56:51] paul's the one
[56:53] who teaches that that was second timothy
[56:54] 3 13-15
[56:57] the holy scriptures make us wise and i'm
[56:59] glad to preach the word of god to you
[57:01] praise god
[57:02] i might be a little heavy lately on
[57:04] scriptures right you haven't heard me
[57:05] use a lot of quotes lately right
[57:07] i did for numerous series from some
[57:09] series i have to do that
[57:10] but church don't be discouraged if i'm
[57:12] heavy on the scriptures that's what's
[57:14] going to make you wise
[57:15] yes the quotes will too don't get me
[57:17] wrong but here i'm laying if i'm laying
[57:19] in a bible revelation of a bible mystery
[57:22] then the bible you have to know the
[57:24] bible interprets itself
[57:26] in other words the bible gives the
[57:27] answer to the mystery pray god
[57:30] and the holy scriptures are the answer
[57:31] to the mystery amen
[57:34] so see there'll be times i labor real
[57:36] heavy on quotes and it might be hard to
[57:38] keep watching and stay awake because i'm
[57:40] reading quotes but there's a purpose
[57:41] behind it praise god
[57:43] but there's other times of just word
[57:44] word word word praise god
[57:47] for god's glory and i know you love it
[57:51] you come back sir i know you love it you
[57:52] come back service after
[57:54] service after service and you press
[57:57] through the flesh and the trials of life
[57:59] and you sing to
[58:00] give god praise and you sing with
[58:02] brother amen and all the
[58:03] and i you just love god and let's keep
[58:05] doing that by god's grace
[58:06] let's be diligent let's be faithful
[58:08] let's take up the cross daily and follow
[58:10] him
[58:12] jesus said these lawless ones can be
[58:15] recognized by their hell-deserving works
[58:17] revelation 21 7-8 say list
[58:20] eight sins of people that go to hell
[58:23] fearful
[58:24] unbelieving abominable murderers
[58:28] whoremongers sorcerers idolaters
[58:30] all liars shall have their part in the
[58:33] brit and the fire which burneth with the
[58:35] brimstone
[58:36] there's eight here's twelve more
[58:40] peter in second peter chapter two says
[58:43] these
[58:43] are all hell deserving acts walking in
[58:46] fleshy lust not a stumble
[58:48] not i stumbled into a sin i'm walking in
[58:51] sin
[58:52] in other words i'm enjoying sin
[58:57] he said despising government there you
[58:59] go with the election coming up
[59:01] we shouldn't despise it let's pray for
[59:03] it let's pray that god will clean it out
[59:05] praise god
[59:06] church don't you know do you remember
[59:08] this remember when we preached on the
[59:09] kings of israel
[59:10] there would be a good king bad bad bad
[59:12] then a good one right
[59:14] let's pray for that praise god we might
[59:17] have had some bad ones
[59:18] let's pray god give us a good one praise
[59:19] the lord
[59:21] okay it's not outside of god's a power
[59:24] remember brother said you can put a
[59:25] george washington abraham lincoln in
[59:27] every
[59:28] in every government in every state and
[59:31] the nation's still going wrong
[59:33] and that's true but let's pray god raise
[59:35] those up a good man praise god
[59:38] i know i mean it might seem hard to pray
[59:41] for that and believe that but let's pray
[59:43] for that praise god
[59:45] see self-willed is another one
[59:49] speaking evil of good adultery sin
[59:52] addiction
[59:53] coveting loving money forsaken the right
[59:55] way serving corruption
[59:57] unbridled lusts and other pollutions of
[1:00:00] the world there's 12 more so i've
[1:00:01] listed 20 already to you these are
[1:00:04] worthy of hell
[1:00:06] in other words all of these now listen
[1:00:09] all these people that do these things
[1:00:10] they love
[1:00:11] sin more than they love simple
[1:00:13] repentance
[1:00:15] remember church don't forget the rich
[1:00:17] young ruler he did
[1:00:19] he never broke the commands but remember
[1:00:21] remember he only failed in one thing
[1:00:23] what was it the love of money
[1:00:25] but listen church that don't mean he was
[1:00:26] like really loving god and loving
[1:00:28] righteousness
[1:00:29] he just loved money so much he didn't
[1:00:31] commit adultery he didn't murder
[1:00:32] because he loved money so much right
[1:00:35] that's why brother ham said one thing
[1:00:37] can keep somebody out of heaven
[1:00:41] because it's it's all based upon what
[1:00:43] they love do they love the pleasures of
[1:00:45] the world do they love darkness or love
[1:00:46] light
[1:00:47] i love light i wouldn't want to be in
[1:00:49] here without light i love the natural
[1:00:50] light and i love the spiritual light of
[1:00:52] god's word amen
[1:00:54] we need the light of god hallelujah but
[1:00:56] see they love
[1:00:57] darkness rather than light
[1:01:02] so there's 20. here's 16 more in the
[1:01:05] book of jude we're not going to read it
[1:01:06] but i'm going to list them out to you
[1:01:08] he says these are all damning acts he
[1:01:10] says damning
[1:01:12] turning grace into lawlessness that's
[1:01:13] called lecheviousness we just read it
[1:01:15] that's the first one in the list
[1:01:16] he this whole chapter is filled he names
[1:01:19] all the works of iniquity
[1:01:21] fornication defiling the flesh
[1:01:24] despising dominion see leadership
[1:01:27] preachers
[1:01:28] right governments they despise it
[1:01:31] they speak evil of those dignities
[1:01:34] be careful what we say right we can call
[1:01:36] out sin let's be careful
[1:01:38] if it's just or not
[1:01:42] corrupting themselves greed not fearing
[1:01:44] god
[1:01:45] shamefully violent wanderers ungodly
[1:01:48] deeds
[1:01:48] hard speeches my murmuring complaining
[1:01:52] walkers after their own lusts and
[1:01:54] mockers there's 36 sins
[1:01:56] that will take people to hell right
[1:01:58] there 36
[1:02:00] workers of iniquity the bible says in
[1:02:02] other words these people walk in
[1:02:04] and they love to they love to mock right
[1:02:06] you see it on the internet all the time
[1:02:07] right facebook and
[1:02:08] instagram they love to mock people they
[1:02:10] love to they love to get on do their
[1:02:11] live speeches right
[1:02:13] they're in their car and they're like
[1:02:14] this and or they're walking down with
[1:02:16] their
[1:02:16] stick and they're just they're
[1:02:18] blaspheming the word of god
[1:02:20] and the bible said if they don't repent
[1:02:22] of that they'll burn in fire and
[1:02:24] brimstone
[1:02:25] thank god we have a good and gracious
[1:02:27] king who reached out his goodness to us
[1:02:29] that we can repent praise god
[1:02:31] because that would have been you and i
[1:02:32] brother sister we would have been making
[1:02:34] all those hard speeches against
[1:02:35] dignities and we would have been
[1:02:37] rebuking preachers and we would have
[1:02:38] been rebuking the president and the vice
[1:02:40] president
[1:02:41] all these things like that but god help
[1:02:43] us to have words
[1:02:44] that are seasoned with grace amen we got
[1:02:47] to take a stand we got to speak against
[1:02:49] evil but we can do it with grace
[1:02:52] i've had preachers not preachers yeah
[1:02:54] i've had preachers i've had preachers
[1:02:55] recently and other people say

[1:02:58] all your comments and they said
[1:03:00] i love how you're so gracious to the
[1:03:01] people that are so mean to you
[1:03:03] because they call me some awful names
[1:03:05] sometimes you wouldn't like it
[1:03:07] i don't like it either but we got to be
[1:03:10] gracious praise god and the nice thing
[1:03:11] is i can just click delete if i don't
[1:03:12] like it
[1:03:14] i don't and i can say i'm banning you
[1:03:16] for my page you can't lo you can't
[1:03:18] comment on my page anymore that's the
[1:03:19] nice thing
[1:03:20] now there's three more portions of
[1:03:22] scripture where there's 37
[1:03:24] plus acts that will keep people out of
[1:03:27] the kingdom of god that means they won't
[1:03:29] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:32] right that means they won't be they
[1:03:33] won't be ruling in the millennium
[1:03:36] they won't rule over cities or nations
[1:03:38] remember remember
[1:03:39] jesus told the sardis age you'll rule
[1:03:41] over nations with a rod of iron if you
[1:03:42] overcome my martin luther
[1:03:44] there he's going to be having a rod of
[1:03:45] iron and ruling over nations my what a
[1:03:47] soldier what a saint of god amen
[1:03:50] to stand up against that roman system
[1:03:52] god help us to stand up against it
[1:03:54] praise god
[1:03:55] to be ruling with a rod of iron
[1:03:59] and they won't be with jesus right in
[1:04:00] the future home
[1:04:02] because they weren't the kingdom people
[1:04:04] they weren't
[1:04:05] in other words they didn't have the
[1:04:06] kingdom inside of them praise god jesus
[1:04:08] said the kingdom of god is within you
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:12] because they kept the kingdom out of
[1:04:13] their souls they're kept out of ruling
[1:04:15] in the kingdom
[1:04:20] first corinthians 6 9-11 lists
[1:04:23] 10 sins paul says do not be deceived
[1:04:27] fornicators idolaters effeminate which
[1:04:30] is child molesters there's a big thing
[1:04:32] on child
[1:04:33] trafficking right now right people
[1:04:35] stealing children and trafficking them
[1:04:37] it's awful it's wicked
[1:04:38] they're deserving of hell abusers of
[1:04:41] themselves mankind that's homosexuals
[1:04:43] thieves covetous drunkards revilers
[1:04:45] that's complainers
[1:04:50] and extortioners that's robbers
[1:04:54] they will not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:04:55] but paul gives us some of the most
[1:04:56] beautiful words in there
[1:04:58] he said and such were some of you
[1:05:01] you used to be outside the kingdom he
[1:05:03] said but now you're in the kingdom
[1:05:05] such were some of you now you're washed
[1:05:07] you're sanctified you're justified
[1:05:09] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:05:12] spirit of our god amen
[1:05:14] i used to be in that camp but i'm out of
[1:05:16] that camp i'm out of that kingdom
[1:05:18] now i'm in the holy kingdom of god amen
[1:05:21] i'm in jesus's kingdom praise god
[1:05:24] oh my thank the lord
[1:05:28] such were some of you you believe that
[1:05:31] god can you believe god can hear
[1:05:33] or forgive a child molester you believe
[1:05:35] god can heal a homeless or
[1:05:36] forgive a homosexual yeah oh yeah
[1:05:39] there's nothing too far there's nothing
[1:05:40] too hard for god amen
[1:05:42] he's the great washer he's a great
[1:05:43] dishwasher praise god he's the great
[1:05:45] cleanser
[1:05:47] galatians 5 19-26 list
[1:05:50] 17 sins that people do and they will not
[1:05:54] inherit the kingdom of god
[1:05:55] i know there's some overlap church but
[1:05:56] i'm reading them all for effect
[1:05:59] right that give you a more of a fact if
[1:06:02] you hear it again oh my
[1:06:03] that's you hear it more and more you
[1:06:05] won't you'll god will keep you away from
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:08] these people shall not inherit the
[1:06:09] kingdom of god adulterers which we have
[1:06:11] many in our family
[1:06:13] especially my side fornicators
[1:06:15] uncleanness which is lustful luxurious
[1:06:17] living
[1:06:20] la cheviousness already said that one
[1:06:22] idolatry witchcraft which is drug use
[1:06:24] think about all the drug
[1:06:26] users hatred variance now variance is
[1:06:29] contention so people that want to fight
[1:06:30] and have contentions and
[1:06:32] battles amongst each other emulations
[1:06:34] which is rivalry or jealousy
[1:06:37] can i tell you a perry green story about
[1:06:38] brother branham
[1:06:40] with emulations brother brown would go
[1:06:42] hunting with the brothers
[1:06:43] and they've had contests for the amen
[1:06:45] about shooting contests and dart
[1:06:47] practice and every time brother branham
[1:06:50] would lose
[1:06:52] and then peregrine would walk on and
[1:06:54] then he'd watch when when brother bran
[1:06:55] would practice and he'd get
[1:06:57] bull's eyes every time and perry green
[1:07:00] said brother branham how come
[1:07:02] you lose every time but when i watch you
[1:07:04] you do it he said i don't want to have
[1:07:05] any emulations i don't want to have any
[1:07:07] rivalry amongst the brothers
[1:07:10] look at that he didn't want any jealousy
[1:07:12] he didn't want any competition spirit
[1:07:14] so he let all the brothers think they
[1:07:15] were better at him than darts
[1:07:18] now so see that must been something
[1:07:20] brother struggle with right because if
[1:07:22] you go to so much length to make sure
[1:07:25] that i mean like remember he with money
[1:07:27] he said of the three things preachers
[1:07:29] fall to money was his hardest battle
[1:07:30] so he totally made sure he didn't use
[1:07:32] any money or the wrong way
[1:07:34] he took extra effort so he must have
[1:07:36] been a competitive person
[1:07:39] we got any of those in our church any
[1:07:40] competitive people here you like to win
[1:07:42] you like your way that's the story from
[1:07:46] barry green tells uh
[1:07:47] jose would like that he's he's probably
[1:07:49] he's probably laughing right now if he's
[1:07:50] watching
[1:07:52] emulation is jealousy rivalry
[1:07:56] wrath strife strife is electioneering
[1:07:58] for office
[1:07:59] so you guys vote for me i'm going to be
[1:08:01] the next uh so and so right
[1:08:03] vote for me vote for me without the
[1:08:04] leadership of the holy spirit
[1:08:06] vote for me instead of him vote for me
[1:08:08] instead of her
[1:08:10] seditions which are divisions heresies
[1:08:13] man-made tenets or doctrines
[1:08:17] envyings murders drunkenness revelings
[1:08:20] which are
[1:08:20] late night parties and rioting
[1:08:23] such as such will not inherit the
[1:08:25] kingdom of god
[1:08:27] god will not let those writers if they
[1:08:28] don't repent god will not let them rule
[1:08:30] in the next kingdom
[1:08:31] why they're destroying this one already
[1:08:34] and the last one is a feat now that's 27
[1:08:36] all right i've read you 27
[1:08:38] already that proved people don't have
[1:08:40] the holy ghost
[1:08:41] uh ephesians 5 1-8
[1:08:44] paul warns the following acts gives
[1:08:47] someone no inheritance in the kingdom of
[1:08:50] christ
[1:08:50] and of god
[1:08:54] do you understand that church if you can
[1:08:56] no the reason i'm going to say this
[1:08:58] if you can control your sexual desires
[1:09:00] and keep from fornication and adultery
[1:09:02] you've got heavenly rewards in the
[1:09:04] kingdom of god
[1:09:06] if you can keep this guy from lying if
[1:09:09] you can keep this
[1:09:09] tongue from lying and and debating and
[1:09:12] hard speeches
[1:09:14] you'll have treasure in the kingdom of
[1:09:15] god you can just control this
[1:09:18] this this this tongue this fire of
[1:09:20] iniquity right this
[1:09:22] this world of iniquity that this
[1:09:24] igniting of fire
[1:09:25] if you can just control this guy jesus
[1:09:28] will make you rule in the next world
[1:09:29] amen
[1:09:31] we can just control this guy
[1:09:35] you'll have inheritance you'll be
[1:09:38] an heir don't you like the sound of that
[1:09:40] i'm a joint heir of jesus
[1:09:43] but amen my name and your name is on his
[1:09:46] list of heirs
[1:09:48] praise god we inherit by god's grace
[1:09:51] right
[1:09:52] where our names are on there we inherit
[1:09:55] all these blessings
[1:09:56] why because we honor christ if we honor
[1:09:59] god
[1:10:00] god will honor us amen
[1:10:03] so let me read through this list of 10.
[1:10:05] this will take us up to 37.
[1:10:07] and that's that's now you see some
[1:10:09] overlap with a 36 i've already read
[1:10:13] so you can't come to church tonight and
[1:10:14] say nobody brother jesse didn't tell me
[1:10:16] any scriptures
[1:10:18] i just told you over 70 sins
[1:10:21] right ephesians 5 warns us
[1:10:25] fornicators uncleanness which is lustful
[1:10:27] luxurious living
[1:10:28] covetousness greedy desire to have more
[1:10:31] filthiness immoralities
[1:10:33] foolish talking jesting which is evil
[1:10:37] humor evil jokes
[1:10:39] whoremongers all unlawful sex
[1:10:42] unclean person evil thoughts and acts
[1:10:44] idolaters
[1:10:45] and speakers of vain words which means
[1:10:48] devoid of truth
[1:10:49] people that just speak words that aren't
[1:10:50] true they will have no inheritance of
[1:10:52] the kingdom of god
[1:10:58] 36 plus 37 what's that 73 is that
[1:11:01] yeah 73 73 sins i just listed you
[1:11:04] and church the blood of jesus is so
[1:11:06] powerful can wash all those away
[1:11:08] amen it can take all those away
[1:11:12] you and i might have been guilty of 70
[1:11:14] of those right
[1:11:15] we might have been guilty of 50 of those
[1:11:18] but when the blood of jesus touches you
[1:11:20] and cleanses you
[1:11:21] and you confess your sin you're guilty
[1:11:23] of none of the praise god
[1:11:24] because they all got placed upon the
[1:11:26] back of our lord and savior jesus
[1:11:28] amen jesus dropped the charges amen
[1:11:32] hallelujah we were wrong but our sins
[1:11:34] were put upon him
[1:11:36] and now there's no charges for you and i
[1:11:38] we are justified
[1:11:40] legally declared righteous because he
[1:11:42] took our shame
[1:11:43] that we might take his righteousness oh
[1:11:45] praise be to god amen
[1:11:47] well amen i was probably guilty of 60 of
[1:11:49] those or something like that probably
[1:11:51] maybe maybe more but jesus's blood
[1:11:54] has washed me away the scapegoat the
[1:11:56] goat has taken away my sin
[1:11:59] far away and the goat that died he died
[1:12:02] in my place
[1:12:02] that i can take his righteousness praise
[1:12:05] god
[1:12:06] amen 73 i went from 73 to zero just like
[1:12:11] that amen
[1:12:13] oh thank you jesus oh press
[1:12:16] can i just oh precious is the flow
[1:12:19] that makes me whiter snow there's no
[1:12:22] other fount i know
[1:12:24] nothing but the blood of jesus amen i
[1:12:27] such were some of you we were guilty of
[1:12:30] 70 40 50 some of you maybe just 10
[1:12:33] but you're still guilty of 10 but jesus
[1:12:35] takes you down this hero amen
[1:12:38] he drops every charge the handwriting
[1:12:40] against you
[1:12:41] was brought it out praise god amen
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:47] but church the route is most church
[1:12:49] members are antichrist following
[1:12:51] antichrist preachers
[1:12:54] who legalize sins that whole list
[1:12:57] they legalize them and say it's okay
[1:12:58] most of them
[1:13:02] and then church the awful part is they
[1:13:04] flaunt it
[1:13:06] right they fought their greed remember
[1:13:08] that one woman preacher a couple years
[1:13:09] ago went on and said
[1:13:10] uh if you want to sign a million dollar
[1:13:12] contract you need a thousand dollar pen
[1:13:15] so she bought this thousand dollar gold
[1:13:17] pen and signed her next book contract
[1:13:19] with it
[1:13:19] like that has something to do with
[1:13:21] spirituality she probably just sold out
[1:13:23] a toll to the devils probably what
[1:13:24] happened
[1:13:26] see that's not that's not humble that's
[1:13:28] prideful
[1:13:30] and that's being preached behind pulpits
[1:13:33] she needs to give a thousand dollars to
[1:13:34] the missionary account praise god
[1:13:37] right and just buy the cheap pens they
[1:13:40] flaunt it
[1:13:41] they flaunt their adulteries their sins
[1:13:44] they put christ to an
[1:13:45] open shame the bible said we must flee
[1:13:47] from those
[1:13:49] and anyone who condones any of these
[1:13:50] sins we've just read you
[1:13:54] church jesus remember this jesus
[1:13:56] attacked
[1:13:57] every part of the pharisees worship now
[1:14:00] church that was the first coming what
[1:14:01] about the second
[1:14:03] don't be discouraged if i got a ball out
[1:14:05] sin don't don't move
[1:14:06] don't be discouraged it's part of my job
[1:14:09] and remember brother mark said the
[1:14:10] bride's ministry is going to match jesus
[1:14:12] ministry
[1:14:13] amen we've got to continue the ministry
[1:14:15] of jesus praise god
[1:14:18] so we're going to have to ball out every
[1:14:20] aspect of their worship
[1:14:22] but at the same time we've got to keep
[1:14:23] our hearts pure
[1:14:25] for pure worship pure religion
[1:14:28] make sure it's sincere and we're tr
[1:14:30] we're doing all we can to leave sin
[1:14:33] behind and put the devils under our feet
[1:14:35] we've got to ball out
[1:14:36] all of theirs and we've got to take them
[1:14:38] to the cross and follow jesus daily
[1:14:41] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:44] forever
[1:14:45] so if he if he had to rebuke every part
[1:14:48] of the denomination service
[1:14:50] well so do we right
[1:14:56] let me just give that example like when
[1:14:57] brother amen went to that denominational
[1:14:59] church and they had beer in the basement
[1:15:00] that's quite a statement there beer in
[1:15:03] the basement
[1:15:04] so that part can be rebuked if we would
[1:15:07] have went there sunday morning
[1:15:09] maybe that women showing off their their
[1:15:10] cleavage or maybe they had uh
[1:15:13] men smoking cigarettes outside or
[1:15:15] looking at evil videos making foolish
[1:15:16] jokes before the service
[1:15:18] church we if we had the holy spirit we'd
[1:15:20] rebuke every part of their worship as
[1:15:22] well
[1:15:23] now if that's true we should make sure
[1:15:25] we come in here and we let the holy
[1:15:27] spirit correct us if just one or two
[1:15:29] things are off in our worship
[1:15:30] may we accept it and say god help every
[1:15:33] part of my worship to be pure
[1:15:35] help me to obey and live by every word
[1:15:38] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:15:40] amen let that be our desire that we can
[1:15:43] take some correction not not not say
[1:15:45] well i
[1:15:46] i've given up so much can i have a
[1:15:48] little bit of this a little eleven
[1:15:50] leavens the whole church
[1:15:52] god help us to be sincere
[1:15:56] there's my 40 minutes give me five
[1:15:58] minutes here
[1:16:01] my glory
[1:16:08] i will close just a moment here see
[1:16:11] jesus
[1:16:12] now listen church he has to reject every
[1:16:14] he has to attack every part of their
[1:16:15] church service because they're full
[1:16:17] of iniquity they're full of it right
[1:16:20] they're full of iniquity
[1:16:21] they're full of sin loving religious
[1:16:24] worship
[1:16:25] so he has to rebuke every part of it
[1:16:28] only
[1:16:28] evil flows from their hearts and mouths
[1:16:31] corrupt trees only produce corrupt fruit
[1:16:36] like i said i appreciate the miracles
[1:16:37] remember i mentioned those miracles the
[1:16:39] brother i talked to from the
[1:16:40] assembly of god church but the thing to
[1:16:42] do would be follow those people around
[1:16:44] to see how they act the rest of the week
[1:16:49] like the one i had a roommate who uh who
[1:16:52] preached
[1:16:53] he now we both got saved about the same
[1:16:55] time he went with the apostolic oneness
[1:16:57] we both believe god was one
[1:16:59] but he went with the apostolic oneness i
[1:17:01] went to the message
[1:17:02] i shared the message with him he said
[1:17:04] brother brown was a false prophet i said
[1:17:05] well
[1:17:07] that's fine you could say whatever you
[1:17:08] want i believe it i believe it's true
[1:17:10] anyways
[1:17:14] and then we both started preaching and
[1:17:16] he would go in his room but amen he'd
[1:17:18] always preach on a sunday night and he
[1:17:19] would turn up the music and just shout
[1:17:21] and start speaking in tongues and
[1:17:22] screaming
[1:17:23] in other words he would just cry out to
[1:17:24] god for the anointing and he'd go to
[1:17:26] church and they'd have the anointing
[1:17:28] but he would come home and guess what he
[1:17:29] do church he'd watch
[1:17:31] dirty movies throughout the week and
[1:17:33] then we
[1:17:34] he and i would have prayer meetings he
[1:17:36] would speak in tongues i just speak
[1:17:37] regular
[1:17:38] and then he would break into this
[1:17:39] laughing spirit he would just laugh for
[1:17:41] like an hour straight and longer
[1:17:43] we'd have friends there and come out
[1:17:46] come to find out after he got married
[1:17:49] he neglected his wife and and spent all
[1:17:51] the money or he spent all his time on
[1:17:53] trying to build up his business in other
[1:17:54] words he was worshiping money
[1:17:56] and his wife committed adulteron they
[1:17:58] were divorced within two years
[1:17:59] when they got married and here i stand
[1:18:01] look where i stand i stand upon
[1:18:03] the the the right solid rock of god's
[1:18:05] word amen
[1:18:07] so you can see that man's foundation was
[1:18:09] saying because when the trials come
[1:18:11] everything fail but when the trials come
[1:18:13] for us we stand on thus saith the lord
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] hallelujah
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:22] i don't know why i'm bawling out so many
[1:18:24] people tonight but
[1:18:25] i guess that's just jesus's ministry
[1:18:27] today praise god
[1:18:28] i'm trying to close
[1:18:33] in the book i finished this section i
[1:18:35] said but god does have saved preachers
[1:18:38] and certain church members are saved in
[1:18:40] every denomination how many know that
[1:18:42] brotherhood said that there's saved
[1:18:43] catholics there's say methodist baptist
[1:18:45] he says it in the seals and there has to
[1:18:48] be because the bible says it
[1:18:49] most of the saved are foolish because
[1:18:52] they deny the full revelation of
[1:18:53] scripture
[1:18:55] now i made a list here i made a list for
[1:18:57] the the book of
[1:18:58] all these things that anyone should be
[1:19:00] able to see or
[1:19:02] are things christians should do
[1:19:06] well here let me read these are the ten
[1:19:08] uh
[1:19:10] most sinful teachings most churches
[1:19:12] accept homosexuality
[1:19:16] adultery they'll marry people two three
[1:19:18] times my wife and i
[1:19:20] our family members we have numerous
[1:19:21] family members that are married two
[1:19:22] three times
[1:19:24] fornication they'll let them live
[1:19:26] together and sleep together before
[1:19:28] they're married
[1:19:29] they don't say nothing about it in fact
[1:19:31] they're happy for them
[1:19:33] murdering babies through abortion and
[1:19:34] birth control pills
[1:19:36] women preachers substance abuse smoking
[1:19:40] drunkenness other drugs
[1:19:43] viewing sinful movies and television
[1:19:45] shows
[1:19:47] shameful hair lengths right that's
[1:19:50] shaming your spouse when a woman cuts
[1:19:52] hair that brings shame upon her husband
[1:19:54] and then shame upon christ when a man
[1:19:56] grows his hair long that's shame upon
[1:19:57] jesus
[1:20:00] false conversions they tell people that
[1:20:02] just say a prayer
[1:20:03] that they're filled with the holy ghost
[1:20:04] and they can do the greater works in
[1:20:06] christ
[1:20:07] in modest clothing yet they the bible
[1:20:09] says they have the attire of heartless
[1:20:11] they have a heartless spirit on them
[1:20:13] that's just ten let me read you five
[1:20:16] more
[1:20:19] now church let me read these five more
[1:20:21] water baptisms are
[1:20:22] you don't use the name of jesus anymore
[1:20:24] you sprinkle everything's outside the
[1:20:26] word
[1:20:27] how you gonna get the holy ghost when
[1:20:28] you you delete the way to the holy ghost
[1:20:35] they get rid of the three works of grace
[1:20:37] there's only one work
[1:20:39] god is three persons idolatry
[1:20:46] the transgender movement they can
[1:20:47] cross-dress men pants
[1:20:49] i'm sorry men's skirts women pants they
[1:20:51] can cross-dress all they want
[1:20:53] bruce jenner's okay that's okay that
[1:20:54] that man the olympic medal winner he's
[1:20:57] trying to be a woman that's okay if he's
[1:20:58] trying to do that
[1:20:59] he can take hormones and try to grow
[1:21:00] body parts like a woman that's okay
[1:21:02] that's sin that's wickedness that's
[1:21:04] abomination
[1:21:06] and some of them deny the supernatural
[1:21:08] power to perform miracles
[1:21:11] now church there's 1.3 billion roman
[1:21:13] catholics
[1:21:14] and of all those things i listed how
[1:21:16] many of them do they support
[1:21:18] we know catholics that are married twice
[1:21:20] three times
[1:21:23] protestants have 900 million how many of
[1:21:25] those 900 million
[1:21:27] watch those bad tv shows cross dress
[1:21:31] get baptized the wrong way eastern
[1:21:34] orthodox is the next biggest group
[1:21:36] with 270 million so you have catholics
[1:21:38] protestants
[1:21:39] ether eastern orthodox 270 million
[1:21:41] they're a lot like catholics
[1:21:43] anglican church has 110 million the
[1:21:47] oriental orthodox
[1:21:48] have 62 million and all others have 37
[1:21:52] million
[1:21:53] which of those keeps all those commands
[1:21:55] that we just
[1:21:56] read very few but church we are
[1:21:59] some of the few praise god we are the
[1:22:02] little flock
[1:22:03] who's keeping the word of god who's
[1:22:05] letting the holy spirit wash
[1:22:07] and sanctify sanctify our lives such
[1:22:10] were some of you
[1:22:11] but ye are washed you're justified and
[1:22:14] you're sanctified
[1:22:15] by the spirit of god in the name of the
[1:22:17] lord jesus christ
[1:22:18] let's stand
[1:22:22] doesn't matter how beautiful their
[1:22:24] architecture is church
[1:22:25] does it matter uh how big their
[1:22:28] memberships are
[1:22:31] church out of those 73 the even one of
[1:22:34] those should
[1:22:35] should make us tremble for guilty of it
[1:22:37] because it's going to keep us from the
[1:22:38] holy ghost
[1:22:39] or it's going to keep us out of heaven
[1:22:42] and that's the kind of church we want to
[1:22:43] have right we want to search out our
[1:22:44] salvation as paul said
[1:22:46] with fear and trembling we just read it
[1:22:48] on sunday
[1:22:50] now which of those churches have fear
[1:22:52] and trembling with the word of god
[1:22:54] hardly any probably none of them
[1:22:56] there'll be a few believers in there
[1:22:58] but we should be a church that's fully
[1:23:00] cleaned out we want to be the bride of
[1:23:02] christ
[1:23:03] we want to be the mature woman the
[1:23:05] mature wife
[1:23:06] who fully submits to every word of her
[1:23:09] husband
[1:23:10] she's obedient to every word let's have
[1:23:13] our musicians come here praise god

[1:23:45] something or for we need help

[1:23:49] to rebuke us
