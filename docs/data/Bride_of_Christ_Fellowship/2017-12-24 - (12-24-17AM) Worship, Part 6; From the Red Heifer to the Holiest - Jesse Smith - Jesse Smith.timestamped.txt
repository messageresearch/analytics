[37:06] by God's grace let's go to numbers
[37:09] chapter 19 like to continue this little
[37:12] series on worship we've been looking at
[37:13] where this gonna be part 6 this is a
[37:16] little message I preached in Iowa last
[37:18] weekend we had a really good response by
[37:21] God's grace I'm trusting to be a
[37:22] blessing to you this morning by the
[37:25] grace of the Lord Numbers chapter 19
[37:34] we'll just read verses 9 and 10 for the
[37:36] sake of time I know I'm kind of I want
[37:39] to be cautious the time I know people
[37:40] might be going to see their families and
[37:41] so forth afterwards but let's sing a I'm
[37:46] sorry
[37:46] let's read numbers 19 verses 9 and 10
[37:50] there will be 2nd service though for
[37:52] those who would like to come back this
[37:54] evening by God's grace I'll pride just
[37:57] do a Bible study on Christmas and some
[37:58] of the reasons you know we have certain
[37:59] standards and so forth I just like to
[38:02] review that spend years since I preached
[38:03] that so I was going over the notes
[38:04] yesterday and today and was blessed by
[38:06] the scriptures and the quotes and
[38:07] everything like that I'll be looking at
[38:09] that this evening by the grace of the
[38:11] Lord God is so good to us praise God
[38:14] amen numbers chapter 19 I'd like to take
[38:19] this thought and I'd like to call it the
[38:22] red from the red heifer to the holiest
[38:24] of holies I want look at this thought by
[38:26] God's grace a couple years ago I
[38:27] preached on the red heifer and and as
[38:29] I've been preaching on these other
[38:29] thoughts everything just kind of it all
[38:31] just is making more sense now by God's
[38:33] grace it becomes more clear you know all
[38:36] the types and shadows and
[38:37] Old Testament we see the reality of in
[38:39] the New Testament and so I like to
[38:41] preach on that this morning you know if
[38:44] you're expecting a Christmas message I
[38:46] guess it is a Christmas message in some
[38:48] degree you know but might not be about
[38:50] the wise men and the shepherds and so
[38:52] for like that well I'll tell you one
[38:54] thing it's gonna be about Jesus Christ
[38:55] amen
[38:56] so that's what we're all interested in
[38:57] in the first place
[38:59] numbers 19 9 and 10 for there say men
[39:03] let's read 9 together and I'll read 10
[39:06] by myself let's just read verse 9 on
[39:07] three one two three and a man that is
[39:11] clean shall gather up the ashes of the
[39:13] heifer and lay them up without the camp
[39:16] in a clean place and it shall be kept
[39:19] for the congregation of the children of
[39:21] Israel for a water of separation it is a
[39:25] purification for sin I'll just read
[39:27] verse 10 and he that gathereth the
[39:30] Astra's of the heifer shall wash his
[39:31] clothes and be unclean until the even
[39:33] and it shall be unto the children of
[39:35] Israel and unto the stranger that

[40:59] I got some quotes and pictures I want to

[41:10] children show up a little late those
[41:12] gifts are for them so just feel free
[41:15] like if I forget at the end of service
[41:16] and people walk in and I see some
[41:18] families that aren't here yet maybe you
[41:21] all can just come up here at the end of
[41:22] service and just take them oh we need to
[41:24] give one too I'm sorry Naomi's children
[41:26] so that we can do I get to do the after
[41:28] service so god bless you sister now we
[41:29] got some no gifts for that your girls up
[41:31] here by God's grace amen
[41:34] so I'd like to look at this thought here
[41:35] this morning this is part six in our
[41:38] worship series from the red heifer to
[41:40] the holiest of holies but I could look
[41:42] at this thought this morning and I
[41:46] believe it types the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:47] very well we're gonna be focusing on at
[41:51] the beginning on the red heifer and
[41:53] remember in our scripture we read the
[41:56] red heifer was important for all
[41:57] Israelites and then for any stranger
[42:00] would be a proselyte to to the Jewish
[42:03] faith we'd say you know like a Rahab you
[42:06] know she was a proselyte she married
[42:08] into the Jewish faith we'd say like a
[42:11] Naomi and a Ruth they married into the
[42:14] Jewish faith now family was I'm sorry
[42:16] know me was already part of it
[42:17] Ruth was married into it by God's grace
[42:20] so no one could join the Jewish faith no
[42:23] one could even come into this the this
[42:25] gate around here you know or the the
[42:27] tent no one could come into tent unless
[42:29] they were sprinkled with the waters of
[42:32] separation from the red heifer so you
[42:34] could only get so close to God you could
[42:37] know you couldn't get as close as you
[42:39] wanted to without the sprinkling of the
[42:41] ashes and the we caught the waters of
[42:43] separation from the red heifer so
[42:46] without this sprinkling this sprinkling
[42:48] was so important you couldn't get to the
[42:51] outer core and without the sprinkling if
[42:53] born in the family of Levi you couldn't
[42:56] get into the holy place and if you were
[42:58] the high priest even the high priest
[42:59] born into it you're of the right of the
[43:02] calling of God as a man and everything
[43:04] and trained up
[43:05] you couldn't get into the holiest of
[43:06] Holies without the sprinkling of the
[43:09] Lords of separation amen
[43:11] how many grateful for the blood of Jesus
[43:12] this morning that's what this all
[43:14] symbolizes everything that in this Old
[43:16] Testament Tabernacle was symbolizing the
[43:18] Lord Jesus Christ they meant so we read
[43:21] our text here and so remember these
[43:23] waters of separation were necessary both
[43:25] for new believers like we said like Ruth
[43:27] and Rahab who were no doubt unclean
[43:31] because they didn't have the knowledge
[43:32] of the word of God that if they
[43:34] contacted anything dead if they came
[43:36] across a dead soldier or if they came
[43:38] across any death and if anything died in
[43:40] their home they were instantly unclean
[43:43] and couldn't worship before God for the
[43:46] experienced believers who contacted dead
[43:49] things that became unclean as soon as
[43:52] you contacted something dead you were
[43:54] unclean that's how that's how much of a
[43:57] curse a death is as soon as you touch it
[44:00] as soon as it was in your house
[44:01] everything everything that had an open
[44:03] vessel was considered unclean and you
[44:06] had to go through the purification laws
[44:08] and so let's look at that let's take
[44:10] your Bibles this morning let's go to
[44:11] numbers chapter 19 there as we read our
[44:14] text let's look at verses one two and
[44:18] three and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[44:20] unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance
[44:22] of the law which the LORD hath commanded
[44:23] saying speak unto the children of Israel
[44:26] that they bring the red heifer without
[44:29] spot where there is no blemish and upon
[44:31] which never came a yoke and ye shall
[44:35] give her unto Eleazar the priest that he
[44:38] may bring her forth without the camp and
[44:39] one shall slay her before his face you
[44:44] know it's interesting that this called
[44:45] as she and it could still represent
[44:48] Christ the red effort could still
[44:49] represent Christ as his she because she
[44:52] represents a part of the man because
[44:55] remember in the beginning she came out
[44:57] of he praise the Lord
[44:59] Adam had she and he he was she and he
[45:02] she had that he had the she inside of
[45:04] him because in the beginning they were
[45:06] one spirit and God pulled out that
[45:08] feminine part so Christ this is a red
[45:11] heifer she effort she represents the
[45:15] submissive part of God amen
[45:18] God has a masculine part and God has a
[45:20] submissive part and that submissive part
[45:23] was Christ Christ came totally
[45:26] submissive to the will of God that's
[45:28] what the female represents it doesn't
[45:29] mean Jesus was a female Jesus was male
[45:31] we know that but female represents a
[45:33] part of God
[45:34] that's submissive aren't you glad God
[45:37] pig came submissive to his own word God
[45:40] sent his son submissive to his own word
[45:42] to die for us amen and notice it was a
[45:46] red heifer ever had to be completely
[45:48] read there there could be no blemish in
[45:50] the red heifer no spots of white no
[45:53] spots of brown no black spots it had to
[45:56] be totally red and the Prophet tells us
[45:58] from one side to the other everything in
[46:00] the tabernacle types even the water
[46:03] separation the red heifer
[46:04] it couldn't be a brown one it had to be
[46:06] a red run not a spot on it had to be
[46:08] burned and then made into the waters of
[46:10] separation which we'll get to
[46:12] and it's sprinkled the people but after
[46:15] they had sinned and had gone outside the
[46:17] camp how the hyssop and cedar wood and
[46:19] all mixed together how the wood the
[46:20] tabernacle how the brazen altar of the
[46:23] labor the shewbread everything pointed
[46:26] to Christ
[46:28] hey man art so glad everything in the
[46:30] tabernacle pointed to Jesus Christ
[46:34] complete in Jesus Christ
[46:37] now the without spot or blemish first
[46:41] Peter chapter 1 verse 19 I'll just be
[46:44] reading this here if you got your Bible
[46:46] you can turn there this is all typifying
[46:50] the Lord Jesus amen
[46:53] first Peter 1:19 says this but with the
[46:57] precious blood of Christ as a lamb
[47:00] without blemish and without spot amen so
[47:05] we see how the heifer had no spot had no
[47:08] blemish and Jesus Christ was the same
[47:10] way amen there never came a yoke upon
[47:14] Jesus and the Prophet tells us what that
[47:16] means it means the red heifer died which
[47:18] was a type of Christ a member never a
[47:20] yoke on his neck Christ was not yoked
[47:23] with any organization and neither are we
[47:26] gay men we're not linked to any man-made
[47:28] organization the only organism were
[47:31] linked to
[47:31] heaven hallelujah because we are living
[47:34] organism we're not an organization that
[47:36] denominates and builds walls and and
[47:38] sets its bylaws our bylaws were written
[47:41] in the mind of God before the foundation
[47:42] of the world our bylaws are fret or ever
[47:46] settled in heaven amen
[47:47] how do you search his organization's
[47:50] change their bylaws from year to year
[47:51] but God's church never changes bylaws
[47:54] because it's God's forever eternal word
[47:57] see Christ wasn't yoked he wasn't a
[48:00] slave to any organization pharisees
[48:01] sadducees Herodians he wasn't yoked to
[48:05] anything he didn't fool with them at all
[48:07] he wasn't yoked up with all this nothing
[48:11] remember Jesus was crucified outside the
[48:15] camp you had to take this red heifer
[48:17] outside the camp
[48:18] it could not be crucified in the camp of
[48:21] Israel I'm sorry our killer or sacrifice
[48:23] the Christ was crucified and so this is
[48:27] a picture I found online in the days of
[48:28] Solomon you know just here's here's of
[48:30] course that the city and the temple of
[48:32] God and it was Solomon made sure they
[48:35] built this path and made sure the red
[48:37] heifer got far outside because this was
[48:39] going to represent sin and anyone who
[48:42] touched it was going to be unclean the
[48:44] red heifer because this red heifer was
[48:46] becoming their sin and so the Bible said
[48:49] that Jesus was taken without the gate so
[48:53] Jesus was taken outside of the city of
[48:56] Jerusalem and he was crucified outside
[48:58] the camp as well amen as a type and then
[49:03] let's go to our Bible here now back to
[49:05] numbers 19 verse 4 and Eleazar the
[49:09] priest now he would set the throat out
[49:12] there and the Bible said Elias the
[49:15] priest shall take of her blood with his
[49:16] finger and sprinkled blood directly
[49:19] before the tabernacle of the
[49:20] congregation seven times now this is
[49:24] very important they had to kill the
[49:28] heifer and had to catch the blood in a
[49:30] charger container and then at least had
[49:33] to walk back and he had to take the
[49:34] blood and he had to stand there before
[49:36] the gate there but before entering in
[49:39] the in the outer court and had taken
[49:41] sprinkle seven sprinkles before the gate
[49:45] and this represented the blood of Jesus
[49:48] Christ it represented that there would
[49:51] be blood for all seven Gentile Church
[49:53] ages amen thank god this blood for
[49:57] emphasis and some Myrna and Pergamos and
[49:59] Thyra tira thank god there's blood for
[50:02] Sardis and Philadelphia but you and I
[50:04] should be thankful there was blood
[50:05] sprinkled for Laodicea amen the same
[50:08] blood that was sprinkled for emphasis is
[50:10] sprinkled for us the same way Paul could
[50:13] be forgiven of his blasphemy the same
[50:15] way he was forgiven for his the same
[50:17] blood cleanses you and I from our
[50:19] mistakes amen
[50:20] there's blood there's seven sprinkles of
[50:23] blood for all seven Church ages and the
[50:26] Bible tells us what sprinkling actually
[50:28] represents and so we'll see if we're
[50:30] sprinkled this morning by God's grace
[50:32] 1st Peter 1 verse 2 I'm going to read
[50:34] that this shows if you're sprinkled and
[50:38] and I believe this explains why church
[50:40] means so much to the believer and to
[50:42] those that are unclean Church doesn't
[50:45] mean as much the preaching of the word
[50:47] and prayer and the so forth and ministry
[50:51] the Holy Spirit doesn't mean as much to
[50:53] someone who's unclean but it means the
[50:55] world to those who are clean hey don't
[50:58] worry
[50:58] 1st Peter 1 verse 2 elect according to
[51:01] the foreknowledge of God the Father
[51:04] through sanctification of the Spirit
[51:08] that's the purification of the spirit
[51:10] unto obedience and what's that next word
[51:14] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:18] grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[51:20] so what does this sprinkling represent
[51:23] the sprinkling represents that the holy
[51:24] spirit has anointed you and you're
[51:26] obeying the Word of God and you've been
[51:28] purified by the Holy Spirit amen
[51:31] see because it's sprinkling unto
[51:33] obedience so someone who's obeying the
[51:35] word of God they're walking clean by the
[51:38] Holy Spirit amen but someone who's
[51:40] walking in uncleanness they're
[51:42] disobeying the Word of God and so we'll
[51:45] see the the repercussions for that and
[51:48] they're awful the repercussions of
[51:49] disobeying even one word of God is awful
[51:52] how many understand that Jesus said we
[51:55] must live by every word that proceeds
[51:56] out the mouth of God
[51:58] so there's blood force at all seven
[52:00] Church ages thank God for that
[52:02] Hebrews 13 20 and 21 I'm going to read
[52:06] that briefly so we have to understanding
[52:07] the Bible cause this the blood of the
[52:09] everlasting covenant now the God of
[52:13] peace that brought again from the dead
[52:14] our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of
[52:17] the sheep through the blood of the ever
[52:20] lasting covenant amen verse 21 make you
[52:24] perfect in every good work to do his
[52:26] will working in you that which is well
[52:28] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[52:30] Christ to whom be glory for ever and
[52:33] ever
[52:34] Church when we see God cleaning out our
[52:37] lives purging our lives purging our
[52:40] homes purging our phones purging our
[52:43] tablets when we see God purging our
[52:45] lives we could rejoice in saying the
[52:47] blood of Jesus is working with me the
[52:51] blood of Jesus is helping me do the will
[52:53] of God now that's where people who obey
[52:55] the Holy Spirit if they don't obey the
[52:57] Holy Spirit then they're unclean in the
[52:59] eyes of God but see for those of us who
[53:03] are letting this blood of the
[53:04] everlasting covenant wash out our lives
[53:06] we can rejoice because God's working
[53:08] with us amen Oh hallelujah and it lasts
[53:12] for every age because the Bible said
[53:13] it's the blood of the everlasting
[53:14] covenant
[53:16] now Hebrews 10:10 says that this is the
[53:21] sacrifice once and for all and so the
[53:26] red heifer you know was a sacrifice and
[53:29] this would last a long time I'm gonna
[53:30] I'm have to I'll get to that in just a
[53:31] moment
[53:32] but let me go back we already looked at
[53:34] numbers 19 for there's blood even
[53:36] four-layer tasya now these seven
[53:39] sprinklings represent the seven spirits
[53:41] of God which are before the throne of
[53:43] God if you know the scripture the Bible
[53:45] said on the throne proceeded lightnings
[53:46] and thunderings voices and there were
[53:48] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[53:50] throne which are the seven spirits of
[53:52] God just as Eleazer had a sprinkle at
[53:55] seven times the blood represents the
[53:58] life and we know that blood represents
[54:00] the life and life represents the only
[54:03] real life there is is the life of God
[54:04] hey man the Holy Spirit so that
[54:08] sprinkling of seven times the blood
[54:09] represent the life of God there will be
[54:12] Holy Spirit anointing for you and I for
[54:14] every age in this hour now let's go to
[54:18] verse 5 numbers 19 verse 5 you got your
[54:20] Bibles after Eliezer would sit the throw
[54:24] and sprinkle the blood after the
[54:26] sprinkling came burning then mixing then
[54:30] cleansing so numbers 19 five and one
[54:35] shall burn the heifer in her sight her
[54:36] skin and her flesh and her blood and her
[54:38] dung shall he burnt see everything about
[54:40] this heifer became sinful just like the
[54:43] Bible said all the sins of all humanity
[54:46] all her iniquities were placed upon him
[54:49] every part three persons were placed
[54:51] upon our Lord Jesus verse six and the
[54:56] priests shall take cedar wood and hyssop
[54:58] and scarlet and cast in the midst of the
[55:01] burning of the heifer so three things
[55:04] had to be added this sacrifice verse 7
[55:08] then the priest shall wash his clothes
[55:10] and he shall bathe his flesh in water
[55:12] and afterward he shall come into the
[55:14] camp and the priest shall be unclean
[55:15] until the even so this sacrifice was
[55:18] unclean and it made even the priests
[55:21] unclean for the rest of the day verse 9
[55:26] and a man that is clean shall gather up
[55:29] the ashes of the heifer so the priests
[55:31] couldn't even do it himself he was
[55:32] already unclean by contacting this
[55:35] heifer but it had to have another clean
[55:37] man to gather up the ashes of the heifer
[55:39] and lay them up without the camp in a
[55:41] clean place and it shall be kept for the
[55:43] congregation of the children of Israel
[55:45] for a water separation it is a
[55:49] purification of sin amen
[55:52] now I want you to if you got your Bible
[55:55] handy there I just want to make sure I
[55:58] read the scripture here where he talks
[56:00] about mixing let's go to verse 20 I'm
[56:05] sorry verse 17 as we go look at verse 17
[56:08] so they'd have these this pile of ashes
[56:11] and they had to be put in a clean place
[56:14] but they couldn't be sprinkled yet until
[56:17] you add the water so it took the death
[56:20] of the sacrifice plus the running water
[56:22] and you mix that together now you've got
[56:24] something you can spring
[56:25] with praise God verse 17 and for unclean
[56:30] person they shall take up the ashes of
[56:32] the burn heifer a purification for sin
[56:34] and running water she'll be put there
[56:37] unto into a vessel Amen now if you go
[56:41] back to verse 9 the Bible said that it
[56:44] shall be kept for the congregation of
[56:45] Israel for a water of separation it's a
[56:49] purification for sin now one thing I
[56:53] read I read it in a commentary said that
[56:55] this waters the separation now when you
[56:57] got the ashes mixed with the water and
[56:59] you've mixed it up this water they said
[57:03] will last from 300 to 400 years and it
[57:06] was showing that the sacrifice would
[57:08] never lose its power during your
[57:10] lifetime it would extend generations
[57:14] truth we see in Jesus Christ his blood
[57:17] never loses its power the Holy Spirit
[57:21] will never lose its power people say
[57:23] well I can't have more children because
[57:25] or I don't want to have any children
[57:26] because it just gets more wicked and
[57:28] wicked all the time but remember the
[57:31] same blood that cleansed you will be
[57:33] available to the cleanse your children
[57:34] and if God tells your grandchildren and
[57:36] if God Terry's law your
[57:38] great-grandchildren amen lose its power
[57:41] amen
[57:42] it would be kept up and see the blood of
[57:45] Jesus Christ is not cut up by a man that
[57:47] might lose it or spot it's kept up by
[57:50] heaven itself amen hallelujah Jesus sits
[57:54] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[57:56] and he ever liveth to make intercession
[57:58] by his blood for you and I hallelujah
[58:01] and he can say to the utmost this
[58:03] morning hey man you might think his
[58:06] blood might be and not be able to reach
[58:08] someone but if you believe and if you
[58:09] trust in God the Bible said beat only
[58:12] you according to your faith amen
[58:14] did not lose its power that a blood of
[58:17] Jesus Christ now the Prophet says this
[58:21] he tells us here this scarlet hid
[58:23] something
[58:23] it was put together and burnt which
[58:26] meant the dispensation of grace
[58:27] justification sanctification the baptism
[58:31] of the Holy Ghost so he saw those three
[58:34] things that had to be added in the fire
[58:35] and it was showing that it was going to
[58:37] take three stages
[58:39] really take effect upon the believer
[58:41] amen it's going to take justification
[58:43] you're saved you're forgiven
[58:44] sanctification your daily habits and
[58:47] your daily words and your house is
[58:49] cleaned out you got all the trash out of
[58:50] your house and now the baptism of the
[58:52] Holy Ghost can come upon you
[58:54] amen because the token cannot be
[58:56] required until all the leaven is out of
[58:59] the house they men oh that's exactly
[59:01] right
[59:02] glory now let's go to numbers 1911 he
[59:09] didn't have to part me I'm a little
[59:10] excited after last weekend seeing the
[59:11] Holy Spirit move like that I'm just a
[59:12] little excited this week by God's grace
[59:14] of bear with me oh we just had a
[59:17] glorious time it was just so tremendous
[59:18] to see the Holy Spirit minister numbers
[59:22] 1911 he now here's where he goes the
[59:24] main thought I've worked with last
[59:26] weekend he that touches the dead body of
[59:29] any man should be unclean seven days he
[59:33] shall purify himself with it on the
[59:35] third day and on the seventh day he
[59:36] should be clean but if he purified not
[59:40] himself the third day then the seventh
[59:41] day he should not be clean I look at
[59:43] this you had to follow God's Word to the
[59:45] tea if you want to be clean praise the
[59:48] Lord and God gave you a little
[59:50] encouragement God said if you can make
[59:52] it to the third day I'll sprinkle you a
[59:54] third day and if you made it to the
[59:56] third day I'll give you enough grace to
[59:57] make it to the seven day amen
[1:00:00] God gave a little break you know I was
[1:00:02] telling people that were repenting in
[1:00:03] tears at the altar I said if you can
[1:00:05] make it to Wednesday and not give in to
[1:00:08] that pornography or not give in to that
[1:00:09] movie lustful spirit you have watching
[1:00:11] movies or these other custom spirits if
[1:00:13] you can make it to Wednesday God will
[1:00:15] give you another anointing and
[1:00:17] sprinkling amen that's right and some of
[1:00:21] you know if you had addictions it's so
[1:00:22] hard to get to the next day but with the
[1:00:24] blood of Jesus Christ all things are
[1:00:26] possible to them that believe amen
[1:00:28] it'll never lose its power amen that's
[1:00:32] exactly right so he says if you make it
[1:00:35] the third day I'll sprinkle on noise
[1:00:37] I'll give you a fresh anointing so you
[1:00:38] can make it for the rest of the week and
[1:00:40] then you can be clean Eileen oh yeah I
[1:00:43] love it my the word of god is so
[1:00:44] beautiful whoever touches the dead body
[1:00:48] of any man that is dead and purified not
[1:00:50] himself he defiles that
[1:00:52] NACO of the Lord see you see how this is
[1:00:56] important if someone doesn't come to
[1:00:58] church prayed up and asking forgiveness
[1:01:00] and obeying the Word of God
[1:01:02] it actually defiles the whole church the
[1:01:05] Holy Spirit can't move when someone
[1:01:07] doesn't get sprinkled by the blood of
[1:01:08] Jesus and obey the Word of God it hurts
[1:01:12] the whole church that's what we look at
[1:01:14] here because the waters the separation
[1:01:18] was not sprinkled upon him he should be
[1:01:20] unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
[1:01:23] glory now here's what I said today now
[1:01:27] this is a beautiful type you were cut
[1:01:28] off from the congregation if you were
[1:01:30] unclean they would not let you into the
[1:01:33] outer court how many could say amen to
[1:01:35] that you're cut off and this is like
[1:01:38] today people are cut off from the
[1:01:40] spiritual effects of the Holy Ghost in
[1:01:43] worship why they cut off the Bible said
[1:01:47] they become dull of hearing due to their
[1:01:49] hard hearts because they grieve the Holy
[1:01:51] Spirit they do things that the Holy
[1:01:54] Spirit says not to do they get in
[1:01:58] contact with dead things with sin they
[1:02:02] contact dead sin they don't repent of
[1:02:05] the sin they keep living in sin and no
[1:02:07] wonder no wonder the effects of no
[1:02:10] wonder they can fall in love with God
[1:02:12] anymore they're not even allowed
[1:02:13] spiritually to come close to God because
[1:02:16] God they've grieved the holy spirit away
[1:02:18] from them and they cannot enjoy the
[1:02:20] effects of God's Spirit we should all
[1:02:22] desire to it what more of God's Spirit
[1:02:24] we should all want to be so clean before
[1:02:26] God that the word of God means more to
[1:02:28] us every day
[1:02:29] amen they cannot experience the joy of
[1:02:33] true worship because they're cut off due
[1:02:36] to their sin that's why worship doesn't
[1:02:38] mean anything they could come to church
[1:02:39] and eat and they're there they're not
[1:02:41] impacted it's because God spiritually
[1:02:43] does not let them come in because
[1:02:45] they've sinned and they know better and
[1:02:47] they're cut off from the effects of the
[1:02:49] Holy Spirit
[1:02:49] how many can say amen to that they've
[1:02:52] grieved the Holy Spirit where now
[1:02:54] they're cut off and they just like
[1:02:56] Abraham just like Abraham and Peter
[1:02:58] Abraham never got back to worshiping God
[1:03:02] until he repented from going to Egypt
[1:03:04] and he had to come right back to the
[1:03:06] alter where he left God and so are you
[1:03:10] and I we have to come back to the same
[1:03:11] spot where we sinned and let's God we've
[1:03:13] got to come back right there and repent
[1:03:15] of our sins and say God bring back the
[1:03:18] fellowship bring back the love bring
[1:03:20] back the power bring back the joy we've
[1:03:22] got to repent and be sprinkled and come
[1:03:24] back to Christ amen it's exactly right
[1:03:27] that's why they don't enjoy church
[1:03:29] because they're cut off from it and this
[1:03:31] is what I preached last week they
[1:03:35] contact dead things and then if you look
[1:03:37] at numbers 19 now the death comes in
[1:03:39] their home and I preached on TVs movie
[1:03:43] smartphones bedroom wallet church
[1:03:45] attendance and I'm gonna preach on that
[1:03:46] again this morning because I I have to
[1:03:49] look at verse 14 numbers 1914 this is
[1:03:53] the law when a man dies in a tent all
[1:03:55] that come into the tent and all that is
[1:03:57] in the tent shall be unclean seven days
[1:04:00] think about if somebody let's a let's
[1:04:03] say how a man lets in a little evil
[1:04:06] movie into his home and let's that lets
[1:04:09] the death of that evil movie with custon
[1:04:11] and maybe a morally dressed women he
[1:04:13] lets that spread out in his home this
[1:04:15] and without repenting of that that that
[1:04:17] death lays there in the house and it
[1:04:19] impacts the whole home how about a
[1:04:22] sister that'll wear sexy closer and or
[1:04:25] bring some clothes and she to the house
[1:04:26] she shouldn't wear and that's like death
[1:04:29] that's like a sin that's coming to the
[1:04:31] home and it defiles the whole home how
[1:04:35] about your children they see something
[1:04:36] they shouldn't see out there in the
[1:04:37] world right and they come in and they
[1:04:39] start saying some of the things they
[1:04:41] heard Karen if not repented of that sin
[1:04:44] that death affects the entire home how
[1:04:47] many can understand that that's exactly
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:50] and every open vessel was unclean
[1:04:53] because the effects of sin and your and
[1:04:56] you and I are our minds are always open
[1:05:00] vessels right Satan can't get into your
[1:05:02] soul thank God amen how do you know
[1:05:05] thank God your soul sealed to the
[1:05:07] knavery redemption but your mind isn't
[1:05:09] open that song right your eyes whatever
[1:05:13] comes in your eyes and never goes
[1:05:14] through your ears if it's sin it'll
[1:05:16] torment a real believer
[1:05:19] is that that's right that's exactly
[1:05:20] right if you see sin and you're a
[1:05:22] Christian it will torment you until you
[1:05:24] confess it and get it out of your home
[1:05:25] and the church said Amen that's exactly
[1:05:29] right see death in the home caused
[1:05:32] everything in the home to be unclean and
[1:05:35] then the Bible said that to get hissed
[1:05:37] up and come sprinkle the house sprinkle
[1:05:38] the tent hallelujah when we watch the
[1:05:42] wrong thing or something it goes wrong
[1:05:44] in our phones or whatever more if we
[1:05:46] don't ask God to cleanse us what happens
[1:05:48] it becomes dead it becomes unclean we
[1:05:51] don't want to be unclean we want to be
[1:05:52] clean amen
[1:05:54] we don't want death to infest our home
[1:05:56] we want life to flow into our home amen
[1:05:59] we let the love of Christ to throw into
[1:06:02] our home not sin and compromise and
[1:06:05] unbelief that's the script that's the
[1:06:10] scripture look at it says unclean
[1:06:12] seven-eighths verse 15 and every open
[1:06:14] vessel which hath no covering bound upon
[1:06:15] it is unclean thank God your soul is
[1:06:18] covered I'll hear your seal to the day
[1:06:21] of your Redemption amen no I preached
[1:06:25] pretty hard on some of these things and
[1:06:26] I got people weeping and repenting at
[1:06:29] the altar for every one of these I
[1:06:30] preached so I know it was God I know it
[1:06:34] was God because God doesn't want to try
[1:06:36] to I confession well I'm sorry I I stole
[1:06:39] this I'm sorry I was thinking those God
[1:06:42] wants somebody that's really dead to
[1:06:43] themselves praise God
[1:06:46] that's the only way you're gonna get any
[1:06:48] victory we've all tried it you know
[1:06:49] half-hearted confessions or we got
[1:06:50] caught we're sorry well you're sorry you
[1:06:52] got cause you're not sorry that you're
[1:06:53] doing it you got sorry you're caught and
[1:06:56] we got to be sorry we did it and died to
[1:06:58] that and get clean in our house amen
[1:07:00] get clean in our home now I just started
[1:07:05] with some of these I started with ties
[1:07:07] the reason people don't pay ties is
[1:07:10] because they fear the bank more than
[1:07:11] they fear God and that scriptures
[1:07:15] this is a faith issue if someone doesn't
[1:07:17] pay their tithes and offerings there are
[1:07:19] weak in faith some dead thought about
[1:07:22] being fearful about the mortgage or the
[1:07:24] bank or groceries or whatever more
[1:07:26] whatever cost and car payment you name
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:28] some dead thought has centered in God's
[1:07:31] not going to take care of you
[1:07:32] God's not gonna take care of you better
[1:07:34] not pay your tithes and offerings and we
[1:07:36] just saying Jehovah Jireh my provider
[1:07:38] he's more than enough for me boy because
[1:07:44] the Bible says when you don't pay your
[1:07:45] tithe the reason you pay your tithes and
[1:07:47] offering is because you want to learn
[1:07:48] how to fear God when you don't pay your
[1:07:50] tithes and offerings you fear man more
[1:07:52] than you fear God and you'll never get
[1:07:54] over that until you repent and start
[1:07:55] paying God your tithes and offerings
[1:07:57] when I preach that so hard I do people
[1:07:59] coming up we've been and crying about
[1:08:01] paying ties it was quite it was quite
[1:08:03] the leadership of the Holy Spirit church
[1:08:05] attendance the Bible literally says we
[1:08:08] must gather more as you see the Day
[1:08:09] approaching and I'm not talking about
[1:08:11] just loose fellowship I'm talking about
[1:08:13] fellowship under the Holy Spirit now if
[1:08:16] you have fellowship at your house is not
[1:08:18] a church time and people are praying and
[1:08:19] I'm sorry not praying but just maybe
[1:08:21] singing and glorifying God that might
[1:08:23] count it might be if there's a real
[1:08:24] sweet spirit there but if it's just
[1:08:27] gathering and not really with the
[1:08:28] sincerity the Holy Spirit then we're not
[1:08:30] fulfilling the scripture we must fulfill
[1:08:33] the scripture hebrews 10:25 says we do
[1:08:37] not forsake this something of ourselves
[1:08:38] together as the manner of some is but
[1:08:40] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:08:42] more as you see the Day approaching
[1:08:45] commands we have to gather mores you see
[1:08:48] that Day approaching now my plan for the
[1:08:50] file that was to have a Sunday night
[1:08:52] service every week every week that I
[1:08:53] possibly can that helps me ensure that
[1:08:56] I'm gathering with the Saints more all
[1:08:57] the time but to break this command the
[1:09:00] idea here I don't need to be with the
[1:09:02] Saints and I've heard enough word or I
[1:09:04] don't need to really study my Bible
[1:09:05] anymore that's a thought of death and
[1:09:07] when death enters in the house the
[1:09:09] family a person is unclean and then he'd
[1:09:12] sprinkled with the blood of Jesus to
[1:09:14] correct that thought and I'll preach all
[1:09:16] movies and I numerous people crying
[1:09:18] about movies and the last week Star Wars
[1:09:21] came out so just on my mind you know I
[1:09:22] was rebuking Star Wars I said they'll go
[1:09:25] to Star Wars and they'll watch murders
[1:09:27] and say yeah
[1:09:29] that's what they're doing now on
[1:09:33] cleaning the eyes of God the man or
[1:09:36] woman that will kiss what is that that's
[1:09:37] fornication they'll say oh this person
[1:09:40] fell in love
[1:09:41] shame on anybody that would pay money
[1:09:43] for Satan to pour down sin down their
[1:09:45] throats
[1:09:45] shame on anybody that would do that and
[1:09:48] I told that this got inspired you and I
[1:09:49] said these people that love these new
[1:09:50] movies and so forth I don't even care if
[1:09:52] it's the older one the older one were
[1:09:53] just bad because I watched him as a
[1:09:56] child and one of the women they dressed
[1:09:57] up in a bikini even in the 70s you know
[1:10:00] and cussin there was cussing on theirs
[1:10:02] murders on there that thing's unclean
[1:10:04] the eyes of God I tell you if they love
[1:10:06] their Star Wars they're going to get
[1:10:07] their Star Wars at the Battle of
[1:10:09] Armageddon because the Saints are going
[1:10:11] to come back riding on white horses and
[1:10:13] the Bible said the seed of Abraham are
[1:10:15] like the stars of heaven amen
[1:10:17] and they're going to be fighting Jesus
[1:10:19] Christ and all the saints on white
[1:10:21] horses and they're going to have a star
[1:10:23] wars the Stars have they're gonna judge
[1:10:25] them they're in the Battle of Armageddon
[1:10:26] it's exactly right and the church said
[1:10:30] don't let this dead stuff get in your
[1:10:33] family
[1:10:33] don't let these dead things get inside
[1:10:35] your tent or your life because it'll
[1:10:38] corrupt your life it'll cut you off from
[1:10:41] the blessings of God you will hunger for
[1:10:43] the things of God anymore you know I was
[1:10:45] I was up I was just flipping through
[1:10:48] Facebook I forget Saturday morning or
[1:10:50] Friday morning you know I like to update
[1:10:52] and write some comments on there on
[1:10:53] people stuff I just try to quickly flip
[1:10:55] through there but well some of our
[1:10:56] friends from another community said oh
[1:10:58] we went to the meeting last night the
[1:11:01] the Christmas fellowship and I'm not
[1:11:03] trying to be critical but but just let
[1:11:06] me give you an example I I thought well
[1:11:09] I like to hear what that preacher said
[1:11:11] last night you know I was I was kind of
[1:11:12] on the drive to over here I was coming
[1:11:14] here early like at 6:00 in the morning
[1:11:15] and I thought well just listen to that
[1:11:17] was I you know so I got my headphones on
[1:11:18] and I listened to the message and the
[1:11:20] preacher starts off by saying well you
[1:11:22] have to forgive me I'm a little tired he
[1:11:24] said I was at the Star Wars movie till
[1:11:25] 3:30 a.m. last night and it just struck
[1:11:32] me like I just preached on that and your
[1:11:35] men of supposed men of God are
[1:11:38] sacrificing for the sake of Star Wars
[1:11:40] and
[1:11:42] here's a sermon you know it was just a
[1:11:44] very milky sermon on church I'm not
[1:11:46] trying to be critical to anybody
[1:11:47] understand but it was just like you know
[1:11:49] Jesus is the light we need to be light
[1:11:51] Jesus hope we need to be hope but what
[1:11:54] about the light to shine into the
[1:11:55] darkness of your heart that loves
[1:11:57] cussing and expose the the darkness in
[1:12:00] your heart that loves murder what about
[1:12:01] the light of Christ for that does
[1:12:04] everyone understand well this is the
[1:12:06] idea these are the these are the milky
[1:12:08] ideas that go out about Christmas well
[1:12:10] you're the light you need to have hope
[1:12:11] and that's true but the only way we'll
[1:12:14] really be light is to be clean amen
[1:12:16] to have our lamps from the glitter then
[1:12:19] we can shot in the line of Jesus Christ
[1:12:21] the right way Oh hallelujah thank you
[1:12:24] Jesus
[1:12:25] and so it was tremendous we probably saw
[1:12:27] ten people on Saturday night come up
[1:12:29] weeping a couple guys got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:31] it was tremendous it was fantastic the
[1:12:33] move of the Holy Spirit that Sunday
[1:12:35] morning about ten or more people come up
[1:12:36] for prayer and just on these things
[1:12:38] about the home one young man just had a
[1:12:40] baby starting his family I remember him
[1:12:41] he's a little boy I preached out in Iowa
[1:12:43] back in 2000 would have been 8 or 9 he
[1:12:47] said brace weep and he just cried to say
[1:12:48] brother Jesse he said pray for me that
[1:12:50] I'll clean out my house I've got a child
[1:12:52] now and I don't want this child to see
[1:12:54] all the sins I've let in the house and
[1:12:56] he hugged me and said I love when you
[1:12:57] preach brother Jesse I said what ain't
[1:12:58] me because I'm no preacher Jesus is the
[1:13:00] only preacher but it so encouraged me to
[1:13:03] see a young man who's seen who seen my
[1:13:05] ministry through the years and heard the
[1:13:07] preaching of the word that it could so
[1:13:08] prick his heart he's a new father so
[1:13:10] he's got this new zeal god help us some
[1:13:13] of us older fathers to have the same
[1:13:15] zeal to clean out our homes feed on our
[1:13:19] music that we listen to to make sure our
[1:13:22] lives are pure and sprinkled with the
[1:13:24] blood of Jesus Christ unto obedience
[1:13:27] where we obey the word not just say well
[1:13:29] that's just his opinion but if it's the
[1:13:31] Word of God it's God's opinion then it
[1:13:33] should be you and I own opinion amen
[1:13:36] that's exactly right now I'm almost done
[1:13:41] with this part on numbers 19 in verse 16
[1:13:45] it says if you touch somebody that's
[1:13:46] slain or touch a dead body or a bone or
[1:13:49] grave you're unclean I don't know how
[1:13:52] that worked about with Elijah's bones
[1:13:54] I'm not sure how that worked but
[1:13:56] there's something some mystery in there
[1:13:57] I'd ask the Holy Spirit to reveal it's
[1:13:59] cuz they were unclean but yet when the
[1:14:00] dead man fell on the lashes bones he
[1:14:02] come back to life I don't understand
[1:14:05] that but that's the scripture and then
[1:14:07] in verses 17 to 19 cleansing being fully
[1:14:11] cleanse was having the ashes mixed with
[1:14:14] the running water and then sprinkled by
[1:14:16] the blood of the red heifer and I
[1:14:20] remember that represent the obedience to
[1:14:21] the Holy Spirit Oh bang what the the
[1:14:24] life of God the Holy Spirit and now
[1:14:27] there's a warning in verse 22 the man
[1:14:29] who will not purify himself that's I'm
[1:14:30] gonna read it but the man that shall be
[1:14:33] unclean and shall not purify himself
[1:14:37] that soul shall be cut off from among
[1:14:39] the congregation see God doesn't play
[1:14:41] around with sin if you're gonna enjoy
[1:14:43] sin and disobey the word of God God's
[1:14:45] gonna cut you off and you won't enjoy
[1:14:46] the blessings of God anymore you have to
[1:14:49] suffer in your disobedience because he
[1:14:51] had to fight like he defiled the
[1:14:53] sanctuary of the Lord the water
[1:14:55] separation not been sprinkled upon him
[1:14:57] he's unclean because he chose to be
[1:14:59] unclean so see God gives us two warnings
[1:15:02] in that chapter and that's where the
[1:15:04] Amen where it came a reality to me I
[1:15:05] thought mine now I understand this now I
[1:15:07] understand why we got to obey every
[1:15:08] little thing because it's a fresh
[1:15:10] sprinkling it's a fresh blinkin that
[1:15:12] keeps us clean so that when we come to
[1:15:14] the house of God we can enjoy the house
[1:15:16] of God amen see if you were clean you
[1:15:21] could worship in spirit before your God
[1:15:23] if you're unclean you couldn't even get
[1:15:25] into the outer court does every
[1:15:27] understand that alright let's look at
[1:15:30] the outer court then someone that's
[1:15:31] freshly sprinkled can now get in now or
[1:15:34] is open and Jesus said I am the door
[1:15:37] Gouri see you've got to get a sprinkle
[1:15:40] first whether you're new proselyte or
[1:15:42] whether you're an experienced believer
[1:15:44] before you come in you can't come in on
[1:15:46] clean to church you should have come in
[1:15:49] here in your sins hallelujah when you
[1:15:52] know you've treats your husband wrong or
[1:15:53] your wife wrong or you know you mistreat
[1:15:55] your children or you know you to this
[1:15:56] dirty deal you shouldn't have done or
[1:15:57] you looked at something or listen to
[1:15:59] something you should not have done you
[1:16:00] should have come into church dirty
[1:16:01] you should come into church clean amen
[1:16:04] ask God to forgive you get clean get
[1:16:06] well so that the Holy Spirit will
[1:16:07] welcome you into the service
[1:16:09] and you can enjoy the Word of God that's
[1:16:12] why so many people I'm just convinced
[1:16:14] don't enjoy the Word of God because
[1:16:15] they're living in uncleanness and they
[1:16:18] they can't get any Word of God
[1:16:20] other than things they say well the Lord
[1:16:21] told me I could do this or the Lord told
[1:16:23] me I could do that and it's outside the
[1:16:24] Word of God that's a complete evidence
[1:16:27] that you're not hearing the Word of God
[1:16:29] if your leadership goes against the Word
[1:16:31] of God exactly right
[1:16:34] and Wednesday we looked at this a little
[1:16:37] bit briefly so form I will be by here
[1:16:38] Wednesday or livestream this will be a
[1:16:40] little bit of review for you the first
[1:16:43] article is a bracelet altar than the
[1:16:45] Laver and then the holy place so the
[1:16:47] first thing they had to happen was death
[1:16:49] so once they got to God's house
[1:16:52] something had to die
[1:16:54] praise the Lord when you come here
[1:16:56] Church something has to die if it's your
[1:17:01] first time in church then you recognize
[1:17:02] yes Christ as my sacrifice he died for
[1:17:05] me if you're an experienced then the
[1:17:07] Bible said you become the living
[1:17:08] sacrifice you've got to lay yourself on
[1:17:11] God's altar and say God help me to die
[1:17:14] daily help me not to think my thoughts
[1:17:16] help me to believe your word help your
[1:17:18] word to speak to my life yes sir and so
[1:17:22] first this is the first thing death you
[1:17:24] had to die to self and I said this on
[1:17:26] Wednesday how many people really come
[1:17:28] here to die how many people come with
[1:17:32] the motivation Oh God's gonna speak
[1:17:34] something to change my life today how
[1:17:37] many people really die I'm willing to
[1:17:39] leave this behind because I love God so
[1:17:41] much how many people come to service
[1:17:43] like that it would help this church if
[1:17:45] you did if not the entire sanctuary the
[1:17:49] entire congregation can be defiled if we
[1:17:51] don't make sure we come here clean and
[1:17:53] then die out to all will so that God's
[1:17:56] will can be done amen now I'm just
[1:18:01] looking at the burnt offering you know
[1:18:02] there was many kinds there's five
[1:18:03] different kinds of offering but just
[1:18:04] with the burnt offering from Leviticus
[1:18:05] chapter one first death came they set
[1:18:09] the throat of the burnt offering then
[1:18:11] there to sprinkle the blood at the altar
[1:18:13] of the brazen altar next was washing the
[1:18:17] inwards because this was going to be a
[1:18:19] burnt sacrifice and I I so enjoyed that
[1:18:21] from Wednesday
[1:18:22] after you die God wants to wash her
[1:18:25] inward parts God wants to wash your
[1:18:27] emotions out how many thankful for that
[1:18:29] he want some washed out your ideas about
[1:18:32] this person that person he wants to wash
[1:18:34] you out hallelujah and he cuts that
[1:18:38] sacrifice and he rightly divides it he
[1:18:40] places it upon God's brazen altar just
[1:18:42] the way God likes it we could use some
[1:18:46] washing of our inward thoughts couldn't
[1:18:47] we our little secrets that we hide that
[1:18:49] we wish we could say out loud
[1:18:51] well the sinful part of us wish we could
[1:18:53] say out loud we should talk to God and
[1:18:56] say wash me from the inside out cut me
[1:18:59] with your word wash me and let me be a
[1:19:02] living sacrifice before God
[1:19:04] say Amen glory now next you would come
[1:19:10] to the Laver to do the washing now this
[1:19:12] is if you're washing the sacrifices I'll
[1:19:14] say the burnt offering did you know the
[1:19:16] Laver was made from the looking-glasses
[1:19:18] of women did you know that in the Bible
[1:19:20] they took the mirrors that the Israelite
[1:19:23] women had they took the mirrors and they
[1:19:25] must have melted that down and then they
[1:19:27] made this Laver so the laborer had
[1:19:31] reflective properties and you can read
[1:19:32] that in exodus 38 so when the priest
[1:19:36] would go before the Laver to wash they
[1:19:38] would see themselves in the water
[1:19:42] the Bible says be doers of the word and
[1:19:45] not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:19:50] selves I wonder how many people come to
[1:19:51] church they see the Word of God and they
[1:19:55] see themselves either obeying or disobey
[1:19:57] but how many people we are warned not to
[1:20:00] be just hearers only we should say well
[1:20:03] this is what the word says and then I'm
[1:20:04] going to forget all about the word the
[1:20:05] rest of the week we should take this
[1:20:07] sermon at least to Monday morning you
[1:20:10] should take this sermon at least a
[1:20:12] Monday or Tuesday right don't forget
[1:20:14] what the Holy Spirit's saying what is so
[1:20:17] important you're going to replace what
[1:20:18] the Holy Spirit said and replace what
[1:20:20] the Holy Spirit said was something else
[1:20:22] from the world oh the new tax bill oh
[1:20:24] yeah I get a thousand more dollars or
[1:20:26] six hundred will Whitley do what are you
[1:20:28] going to do with that you're gonna give
[1:20:29] the donate to the kingdom of God or do
[1:20:31] something for it'll help the poor we're
[1:20:33] gonna spend it upon your lusts
[1:20:36] you see all the Willis focus we must see
[1:20:39] the Word of God we must go to the waters
[1:20:41] of the word and see our reflection of
[1:20:43] the word and remember what we're
[1:20:44] supposed to be by the Word of God if
[1:20:49] anybody hear the word and not a doer
[1:20:51] he's like a man that beholds his natural
[1:20:53] face in a glass or meal that literally
[1:20:55] means mirror in the Greek for he
[1:20:58] beholdeth himself and goeth his way and
[1:21:00] straightway forgetteth what manner of
[1:21:02] man he was
[1:21:03] forgetteth what a bride of Christ member
[1:21:05] ought to live like he forgets what a
[1:21:08] real Holy Ghost feel Christian should
[1:21:09] live like he forgets the word and he
[1:21:12] doesn't obey the word Oh hallelujah but
[1:21:17] whoso looketh in the perfect law of
[1:21:18] Liberty and continued there and he being
[1:21:20] not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
[1:21:22] work this man shall be blessed in his
[1:21:24] deed how many want to be blessed then
[1:21:27] you have to hear the word and you have
[1:21:28] to let the word mean something to you
[1:21:29] see but if you're in sin and you haven't
[1:21:32] confessed your sin you can't even get
[1:21:33] into the outer court you can't even
[1:21:36] enjoy the blessings of being a real
[1:21:37] sacrifice for God aren't you glad you
[1:21:39] can be a sacrifice for God amen and you
[1:21:42] can come to church knowing I'm clean
[1:21:44] I've done I've done the will of God I'm
[1:21:47] remembering where I'm supposed to be I'm
[1:21:48] supposed to be a Holy Ghost on fire st.
[1:21:51] going the rapture and I should be an
[1:21:52] example and everybody you can come to
[1:21:54] church that way man
[1:21:55] but it's your choice you got to be clean
[1:22:00] also at this labour the priest had to
[1:22:03] wash their hands and feet at the labor
[1:22:07] that they wouldn't die because once they
[1:22:10] cut it you know once they washed it cut
[1:22:11] the sacrifice they had to wash their
[1:22:13] hands because they had more work they
[1:22:14] had to do and how many want to clean how
[1:22:18] many want clean hands and and how many
[1:22:21] want to touch the right things and how
[1:22:22] many want to walk in the commands of God
[1:22:24] well first you got to be clean by the
[1:22:26] waters of separation then you got to
[1:22:29] come and make yourself a living
[1:22:30] sacrifice and you gotta let the Word of
[1:22:33] God wash you not forget it and now you
[1:22:34] can go a little deeper in Christ that's
[1:22:37] why people don't mean nothing to him
[1:22:39] because they're not founding the pattern
[1:22:40] of God's Word how many want to follow
[1:22:42] the pattern of God's Word everywhere not
[1:22:45] just some words every word of God
[1:22:48] as we said on Wednesday you're getting
[1:22:49] closer to God and I'm gonna get a little
[1:22:54] deeper now this is going to go back now
[1:22:56] to the church ages a little bit I want
[1:22:57] to get a little deeper here and I got
[1:22:59] I'll set the timer give me 15 minutes by
[1:23:01] God's grace now the next thing the first
[1:23:04] thing you would see when you walk in if
[1:23:05] you're a priest and you're bringing the
[1:23:07] sacrifice you pull back the curd the
[1:23:09] first thing you would see is the light
[1:23:11] of the menorah or the golden candlestick
[1:23:15] and now just so you know remember the
[1:23:17] Bible said recall the people had to
[1:23:19] bring oil for the light so not only did
[1:23:22] you have to be clean bring a sacrifice
[1:23:25] you've got to be packin oil with you to
[1:23:27] church I know you hey men or else the
[1:23:30] priests were not responsible for
[1:23:32] bringing oil the people had to bring the
[1:23:34] oil the people had to bring the Holy
[1:23:36] Ghost with them amen I won't be came
[1:23:39] with you this morning cuz I know he came
[1:23:40] with me if you don't bring him there's
[1:23:43] no light no light is going to shine into
[1:23:45] the holy place of people's lives if we
[1:23:48] don't bring the OTR and the anointing
[1:23:51] how many raise your hands say it's easy
[1:23:53] to forget some of these brother Jesse
[1:23:55] honey would say that it's easy we forget
[1:23:59] we get caught up in life we get tired
[1:24:00] busy worn out we I get tired we all get
[1:24:03] tired we need a reminder that this is
[1:24:05] how we must come to the house of God
[1:24:08] this is true worship now say like this
[1:24:10] the true worshipers will bring oil to
[1:24:12] the house of God the true worshipers
[1:24:13] because they worship in the oil and
[1:24:15] truth the spirit and truth they were
[1:24:19] true worshipers always bring an
[1:24:21] anointing the house of God now I'm gonna
[1:24:25] skip some of these here I just had some
[1:24:26] extra quotes on you I want to skip right
[1:24:27] down to this part right here I read this
[1:24:31] on Wednesday - I'm gonna read again for
[1:24:32] the sake of the church this is the
[1:24:34] introduction to seven church ages and
[1:24:36] remember that that menorah represented
[1:24:39] the seven church ages to the Gentiles
[1:24:40] and the Prophet said this he said
[1:24:44] Revelation chapters one through three
[1:24:46] its main theme as the setting forth of a
[1:24:48] detailed study of the seven church ages
[1:24:50] this is necessary in order to study and
[1:24:53] understand the rest of Revelation so you
[1:24:56] have to understand the menorah before
[1:24:58] you can move on deeper in the book of
[1:25:00] Revelation that's what's first just like
[1:25:02] holy place you walk-in menorah first
[1:25:06] because out of the ages come the seals
[1:25:08] and how the seals come in trumpets the
[1:25:10] trumpets come the vowels like the first
[1:25:12] verse of a roman candle the church age
[1:25:14] has come for with the mighty initial
[1:25:16] illumination without which there could
[1:25:18] be no further light you understand that
[1:25:21] you and I are not going to understand
[1:25:23] Revelation until we first have the real
[1:25:25] understanding of the light of the seven
[1:25:27] church ages when I can understand the
[1:25:30] six seven seals Rock understand the
[1:25:31] trumpets the lows the vials the marriage
[1:25:34] supper the land we honor we we won't
[1:25:36] understand the millennium we will
[1:25:38] understand any of that unless we first
[1:25:40] see the light of the seven golden
[1:25:42] candlesticks aren't you glad you see the
[1:25:43] light amen
[1:25:45] I'm so thankful for it but once the
[1:25:49] brilliance of the seven church age is
[1:25:52] given by divine revelation light upon
[1:25:55] light follows until the whole of the
[1:25:59] revelation opens wide before our
[1:26:01] wandering eyes and we being edified and
[1:26:04] purified by its Spirit are made ready
[1:26:06] for his glorious appearing even our Lord
[1:26:09] and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ
[1:26:12] I mean how many want to grow in grace
[1:26:15] but growing Gracie we should grow and in
[1:26:18] the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ him be glory both now and
[1:26:21] forever amen he that overcometh shall
[1:26:23] inherit all things and I will be his God
[1:26:26] and he shall be my son
[1:26:30] now I said I'm going to close I'm gonna
[1:26:33] go down to this in the golden
[1:26:37] candlestick the Prophet said every
[1:26:39] believer is dramatically depicted in the
[1:26:44] seven golden candlesticks the Prophet
[1:26:47] starts by showing how the candlesticks
[1:26:50] representing the messengers but he said
[1:26:51] every believer is represented in the
[1:26:54] seven golden candlesticks
[1:26:55] he said denominations which our man
[1:26:58] directed cannot be born of God for his
[1:27:00] spirit not man that gives life like I
[1:27:02] told you a while ago my mom is in the
[1:27:04] Assemblies of God denomination and last
[1:27:07] year I think was about I don't matter
[1:27:09] what time of the year it was it was this
[1:27:11] year I'm sorry I just mean like last
[1:27:13] spring or less I was
[1:27:15] pree Shawn you know a priest on the mark
[1:27:18] of the beast and everything and I was
[1:27:19] weeping I was saying God please let me
[1:27:21] talk to my mother about the mark of the
[1:27:23] beast and God sent my wife or my mother
[1:27:25] to my house one week later God answers
[1:27:28] prayer Church in this denomination
[1:27:31] Assemblies of God which I'm very
[1:27:32] grateful for the things I learned I was
[1:27:34] raised in some ways of God I was glad I
[1:27:36] was there compared to other churches I
[1:27:37] was thankful but God has given more
[1:27:39] light since then and so I got to talk to
[1:27:43] my mom I said mom I looked in the face I
[1:27:44] said mom is your denomination growing
[1:27:48] closer to things of God or are they
[1:27:50] falling away and she didn't even
[1:27:51] hesitate she said they were falling away
[1:27:53] and her way to say that was she said we
[1:27:56] go to the youth conferences now where
[1:27:57] they invited all the youth in there and
[1:27:59] she said it's like a rock concert and if
[1:28:02] you listen to some of these songs they
[1:28:03] sing the name Jesus isn't even in the
[1:28:05] song I mean it used to be just rock and
[1:28:08] roll music with the name of Jesus well
[1:28:10] now they just take the name of Jesus out
[1:28:11] it's just like God or you it's like your
[1:28:13] love is you you're great you know you're
[1:28:15] great but we need the name of Jesus
[1:28:18] demons tremble at the name of Jesus when
[1:28:22] it's spoken in faith because the sons of
[1:28:25] sceva were saying I journey by Jesus but
[1:28:27] they didn't have the faith Jesus had a
[1:28:29] man so they said we know Paul we know
[1:28:31] Jesus but we don't know you because your
[1:28:33] faith isn't in that name we need we need
[1:28:35] faith in his name and we need love in
[1:28:37] his name we need grace in his name we
[1:28:39] need the name of Jesus hallelujah so I
[1:28:43] looked at her right I said mom you got
[1:28:45] to be careful because it's thus saith
[1:28:47] the Lord mom every denomination will
[1:28:49] take the mark of the beast everyone
[1:28:52] because they've already grieved the Holy
[1:28:54] Spirit they've drawn their lines and
[1:28:56] they've drawn their bylaws and they
[1:28:58] can't move beyond that
[1:28:59] now you and I gotta make sure we don't
[1:29:00] draw our own imaginary lines
[1:29:03] well I only ever believe this or I could
[1:29:06] never really do this for God I could
[1:29:07] never really believe that we have to
[1:29:08] believe for rapture we should be
[1:29:11] believing for our tooth healing hello
[1:29:14] Church we should be believing for the
[1:29:16] saving of our loved ones
[1:29:17] the man said how are we gonna have faith
[1:29:19] for a body change when we can effe for
[1:29:22] two things we need faith for everything
[1:29:24] amen but we got to be clean we got to be
[1:29:28] clean
[1:29:29] to see my mom even tells me that that
[1:29:32] this denomination is getting further
[1:29:34] from Christ every denomination does the
[1:29:39] proper said how thrilling it is to think
[1:29:41] of those seven lamps drawing life and
[1:29:43] light from the resources of the main
[1:29:45] bulb because they had their wick dipped
[1:29:47] in I love this each church age messenger
[1:29:51] is depicted here his life is on fire of
[1:29:55] the Holy Ghost mmm glory his wick or
[1:30:00] life has been immersed in Christ that's
[1:30:05] what it is my life has baptized in the
[1:30:07] Christ
[1:30:07] I've been immersed in the Christ my life
[1:30:10] has been totally covered in Christ Oh
[1:30:12] glory through that wick he's drawing the
[1:30:19] very life of Christ and by it gives out
[1:30:21] the light to the church what kind of
[1:30:23] light is he giving the very same light
[1:30:26] that was in the first lamp that was lit
[1:30:27] and right on down the ages to the
[1:30:29] present time of the last day messenger
[1:30:31] the same life and the same light is
[1:30:33] manifested by a life that is hid with
[1:30:35] Christ in God
[1:30:37] hey man I was glad to see this light
[1:30:39] shine last week in Iowa Omaha the light
[1:30:42] was shining exposed to all those dark
[1:30:44] sins like I told you I had women and men
[1:30:46] both confessed pornography women and men
[1:30:48] I had people confess all this in their
[1:30:50] homes all the movies they're watching
[1:30:52] are there's other sins I don't just want
[1:30:54] to share I already shared some really

[1:31:39] guess aren't naming everybody they're
[1:31:41] all drawing from the same source

[1:31:46] they're all dead to themselves and their
[1:31:49] lives are hid with Christ in God they're
[1:31:52] sealed in by the Holy Ghost Ephesians

[1:32:25] burning and shining giving light in
[1:32:27] manifestations of the Holy Ghost the
[1:32:29] inner invisible life is hidden in God
[1:32:31] and fed by the Lord's word a brother
[1:32:35] sent me a text after satellite service
[1:32:37] he said might I'll never be the same
[1:32:38] after that he said that message was
[1:32:40] monumental and again I had to say it

[1:33:04] outer core and feel like you're saved

[1:33:29] victory in and through the Lord Jesus
[1:33:30] Christ amen and amen
[1:33:34] how many see your life dramatically
[1:33:37] depicted how many see this as a drama of
[1:33:39] your life right here
[1:33:40] you ought to if not you have the wrong
[1:33:42] thought about the candlestick well I
[1:33:44] just see you know brother Branham and
[1:33:45] Saint Paul and I rainiest and Martin
[1:33:47] then you got the wrong idea
[1:33:49] that's right it's okay to think that but
[1:33:51] you need to see the drama of your life
[1:33:54] how do you understand what I'm talking
[1:33:56] about you need to see your life my life
[1:33:59] is a wick my life is the wick dipped
[1:34:02] into this oil and I'm all the way dipped
[1:34:04] down brother amen down into the oil I
[1:34:06] mom dipped all the way down my life my
[1:34:09] wick is hidden Christ when God looks at
[1:34:14] me he sees me hidden in the oil he sees
[1:34:16] me hidden in Christ haha
[1:34:18] dory now I brought this up and I'm
[1:34:22] closing with this well I don't maybe I
[1:34:25] got three minutes so maybe I won't this
[1:34:29] is the glory of the church ages your
[1:34:32] whole life is like this you go through
[1:34:34] this in your entire life when you first
[1:34:36] come to God you have to make sure you
[1:34:38] keep your first love how many people
[1:34:39] have left their first love and they
[1:34:41] don't do the same things they did when
[1:34:42] they first got saved that shows they're
[1:34:45] unclean you have to keep your first love
[1:34:47] that first desire to want to serve God
[1:34:50] and you have to the first works if you
[1:34:53] love to used to love come early to pray
[1:34:56] and you don't do anymore that's why
[1:34:57] you're not feeling close to God because
[1:34:59] you're not doing the first works you
[1:35:00] used to do
[1:35:01] it's a scriptural principle your life is
[1:35:04] a drama and this is the drama of your
[1:35:06] life you have to keep your first love
[1:35:09] and you can't let the deeds or lies of
[1:35:12] the Nicolaitans member just just a lie
[1:35:13] first a little white lie oh it's okay
[1:35:16] not to this or it's okay to do this it's
[1:35:18] okay to watch this it's okay to not do
[1:35:20] this it's okay
[1:35:21] like we said all those sins earlier it's
[1:35:24] okay and see that devil starts getting
[1:35:27] the people's lives it makes them unclean
[1:35:29] does everyone understand what I'm
[1:35:30] talking about this plays out in all of
[1:35:33] our lives our lives are dramatically
[1:35:35] depicted right here and then we must see
[1:35:39] if people don't get this right they'll
[1:35:40] fall then false brother in the church
[1:35:42] will deceive them and they'll have
[1:35:43] little cliques in the church right where
[1:35:45] they now but not just one person can
[1:35:47] send both persons can sin it's the false
[1:35:51] brethren and then they're then they get
[1:35:52] scared of suffering in trials and then
[1:35:55] they actually get then that finally
[1:35:56] becomes in the doctor they start
[1:35:58] believing false doctrine and they
[1:36:00] disagree with the doctrine of the church
[1:36:02] that right says O'Connor you've seen
[1:36:04] this haven't you yeah you can say man
[1:36:07] you were telling me about it earlier
[1:36:09] down there from Florida and if they keep
[1:36:11] going they'll get seduced by the Jezebel
[1:36:14] which is the Roman Catholic Church we
[1:36:16] say the Protestant denominations they
[1:36:18] get seduced by denominational thinking
[1:36:20] and then they become a dead religion
[1:36:24] they have a name that they live they say
[1:36:27] they're Christians they say they're
[1:36:28] Master believers but they're dead
[1:36:29] there's no life in them than they are
[1:36:33] displeasing works their works don't
[1:36:34] glorify God their garments are defiled
[1:36:37] they're spiritually not clean like we
[1:36:39] said unclean and they get deceived
[1:36:41] relying church members they become
[1:36:43] lukewarm which is the worst condition to
[1:36:45] be is lukewarm in your works sometimes I
[1:36:48] serve God but sometimes I just got to
[1:36:50] enjoy some sin that is the worst life to
[1:36:53] possibly live and to prove it Jesus
[1:36:57] gives the most bitter denunciation for
[1:36:59] people that are lukewarm because you're
[1:37:00] lukewarm you're not even speaking for
[1:37:02] them anymore
[1:37:03] I'm spewing you out of my mouth you
[1:37:05] can't speak for God anymore and then
[1:37:08] this is the attitude at the end people's
[1:37:10] lives well I don't need more of God I've
[1:37:13] got riches I've got goods I got
[1:37:14] everything I need I don't need more of
[1:37:15] God I don't the surrender unto sacrifice
[1:37:17] more for God and they don't even realize
[1:37:19] it but the white horse rider red horse
[1:37:22] rider black horse rider and pale horse
[1:37:24] just wrote into their lives they don't
[1:37:26] even realize it and the church said your
[1:37:29] life is dramatically depicted right here
[1:37:33] never understand why this is so
[1:37:35] important you everybody see this from
[1:37:37] the red heifer all the way to the hose
[1:37:39] we're not even to the holiest yet the
[1:37:43] people's lives don't line up with the
[1:37:44] word of God then then they can't even
[1:37:48] move on to the next step which is the
[1:37:50] table of shewbread and we preach this on
[1:37:53] Wednesday night those 12 pieces
[1:37:55] represent the 12 mysteries of God I have
[1:37:57] quotes for brother Graham said the
[1:37:58] shewbread are the mysteries of God he
[1:38:00] didn't name them but he said the
[1:38:01] shewbread
[1:38:02] are hard the mysteries of God and
[1:38:03] there's 12 mysteries in the Bible that
[1:38:05] are called Bible mysteries in the New
[1:38:07] Testament how many understand that I
[1:38:10] always wondered why are there 12
[1:38:12] mysteries and Simon come and preached
[1:38:14] here on it and he preached on the
[1:38:16] 12 loaves of shewbread and just struck
[1:38:19] me I'll sit right back there my brother
[1:38:21] John or brother Malachi and it just
[1:38:23] struck me and I just about jumped in my
[1:38:24] seats and there it is
[1:38:25] Holly nearly now I know why there's 12
[1:38:27] 12 represents the 12 mysteries of God it
[1:38:30] represents government it represents
[1:38:32] nation a nation of people it represents
[1:38:35] the food that we feast on the 12
[1:38:37] mysteries of God but we're not done yet
[1:38:39] are we you're still not in the holiest
[1:38:42] of Holies where you can hear the thus
[1:38:43] saith the LORD how many want to hear
[1:38:45] thus saith the Lord when I come to
[1:38:47] church I want to hear thus saith the
[1:38:48] Lord
[1:38:49] well how am I going to hear though saith
[1:38:51] the Lord when I'm unclean way out here
[1:38:52] outside of the tabernacle and I'm not
[1:38:55] even living all the word that I know I
[1:38:56] should live how in the world am I going
[1:38:58] to get so close why go through all these
[1:39:01] acts I'm a sacrifice all these things I
[1:39:03] see the light my life lines up with the
[1:39:05] church ages I'm feasting on the bread
[1:39:07] and now the next step is prayer how in
[1:39:09] the world and I can hear the state the
[1:39:11] Lord how am I gonna meet with God from
[1:39:13] his very mercy seat when I'm living
[1:39:15] unclean outside the camp of God
[1:39:17] spiritually speaking right because
[1:39:20] anybody can come to church and just
[1:39:22] because they come to church doesn't mean
[1:39:23] they're right with God that's exactly
[1:39:26] right
[1:39:27] it's those people that hear the word of
[1:39:30] God and do the Word of God those are the
[1:39:33] ones that are right with God everyone
[1:39:36] understand what I'm talking about
[1:39:38] so those are the 12 mysteries there's 12
[1:39:41] loaves of shewbread I'm glad we get the
[1:39:44] feast on those all the time brother
[1:39:45] brother bang from time to time the Holy
[1:39:47] Spirit will lead us back into these I
[1:39:49] preach a message or a series on the
[1:39:50] rapture a couple years ago the Holy
[1:39:53] Ghost I preached 17 sermons on that last
[1:39:55] year oh I just I just enjoy feasting on
[1:39:57] the oh that's you've read my it's
[1:39:59] delicious now as I close I say into our
[1:40:02] feet we have to have a burden see every
[1:40:05] Christian dot every Christian is never
[1:40:08] satisfied they always want more of God
[1:40:10] the lukewarm attitude is I got enough
[1:40:13] for that I've got enough you can't tell
[1:40:17] me preacher you can't tell me anything
[1:40:18] about God that's the lukewarm attitude
[1:40:22] and listen it's not me trying to tell
[1:40:24] you about God its Christ I'm trying to
[1:40:26] tell you about God it's the Holy Spirit
[1:40:29] trying to tell
[1:40:30] about the word of God see we've got to
[1:40:33] have a burden to labor to enter into go
[1:40:35] past that shewbread now to the altar of
[1:40:39] incense I've been studying a lot on the
[1:40:40] altar of incense but the Bible said let
[1:40:43] us labor therefore to enter into that
[1:40:45] rest we've got a we got a labor we've
[1:40:47] got to crucify this flesh and the
[1:40:49] desires of it
[1:40:49] we got a sacrifice for God that this is
[1:40:52] what this tabernacle was all about it
[1:40:55] was all about sacrifice if we want to
[1:40:58] get closer with God we must be able to
[1:41:00] sacrifice for God
[1:41:02] we cannot get placed and say I've got
[1:41:04] enough of God I just come to church on
[1:41:07] Sunday morning that's good or just come
[1:41:09] on Sunday night or just come on
[1:41:10] Wednesday that's not enough
[1:41:12] we got a sacrifice and we got a labor
[1:41:13] and give God more of our lives because
[1:41:18] there's more to the tabernacle than the
[1:41:20] candlesticks and shewbread that's
[1:41:21] beautiful
[1:41:22] we need our lights to shine we need to
[1:41:23] see our lives dramatically as a
[1:41:25] candlestick then we need to eat the
[1:41:27] bread but remember the Bible said you
[1:41:28] can understand all the mysteries and
[1:41:30] still be nothing in other words you can
[1:41:33] make it all the way into sanctification
[1:41:34] and feasts to hum that those loaves of
[1:41:36] bread but if you don't get in the
[1:41:37] holiest of holies you're not where you
[1:41:39] need to be yet and so by God's grace
[1:41:45] next now not next week I'm out next week
[1:41:47] in North Carolina but Lord willing I'll
[1:41:49] be right it down
[1:41:50] Lord willing the following Sunday I'll
[1:41:52] try to preach on the altar of incense
[1:41:53] there's a lot of good things a couple
[1:41:55] weeks ago I showed I preached us in Iowa
[1:41:57] - there's three scriptures that say we
[1:41:59] need to come praying before we come to
[1:42:01] service you got to come praying before
[1:42:05] we here thus saith the Lord we have to
[1:42:06] pray those are three witnesses we preach
[1:42:08] on that so we'll begin Lord willing
[1:42:11] we'll begin 2018 looking at the altar of
[1:42:13] incense
[1:42:13] because after you received all the all
[1:42:15] the bread after you enjoy those
[1:42:17] mysteries after you see your life as a
[1:42:20] dramatic representation the Holy Spirit
[1:42:22] then the way to get in to hear God's
[1:42:24] voice is through prayer and that's the
[1:42:26] one thing we never do enough of right
[1:42:29] that's the one thing we can never do too
[1:42:31] much of is pray
[1:42:33] how many appreciate the Word of God this
[1:42:35] morning but America if you'll just come
[1:42:37] to the piano won't you just play that
[1:42:40] slow song take me into the Holies of
[1:42:41] Holies as we examine ourselves church I
[1:42:44] wonder if we could bow our heads and
[1:42:45] look into the labor of God's Word this
[1:42:47] morning the Word of God has been
[1:42:50] preached I like I said I just felt led
[1:42:51] of the Holy Spirit to preach this out in
[1:42:53] Iowa and just saw some tremendous
[1:42:55] results but I wonder if anything was
[1:42:58] said this morning that spoke to the
[1:43:01] hearts of the believers
[1:43:02] I sure hope something did if your life
[1:43:08] is clean from all the things I mentioned
[1:43:09] the worldly temptations then praise the
[1:43:12] Lord but you've still got a
[1:43:13] responsibility to be a living sacrifice
[1:43:15] and to draw near unto God for other
[1:43:19] people
[1:43:20] hallelujah you know we just came to my
[1:43:23] mind Jesus Jesus was going to the cross
[1:43:24] and he said I sanctify myself for their
[1:43:27] sakes hey hey man Jesus did nothing
[1:43:29] wrong he never sinned he never was
[1:43:31] unclean but he said I can live a more
[1:43:33] devoted life I can live a more purer
[1:43:36] life for the sake of others
[1:43:40] now with heads bowed and eyes closed I'd
[1:43:47] like you to think about your life look
[1:43:48] into the word and I'm not gonna ask him
[1:43:53] to raise their hands today but if you
[1:43:55] know death has entered into your home or
[1:43:57] you've touched something dad please
[1:43:59] confess it right now before the Lord
[1:44:00] you're welcome to come up for prayer of
[1:44:02] course if you desire that please do not
[1:44:05] defile your home yourself and this
[1:44:10] sanctuary God requires holiness God asks
[1:44:17] us to live what we know in your heart I
[1:44:23] just pray you're looking to the mirror
[1:44:28] of God's Word just as I did before I
[1:44:29] come to preach I knew what the Holy
[1:44:31] Spirit place on my heart I had examined
[1:44:33] myself I prayed
[1:44:35] hallelujah Lord Jesus
[1:44:39] nor with our heads bowed just come to
[1:44:42] your Lord father as we look into the
[1:44:45] mirror of your word
[1:44:46] may we see are we clean or unclean dear
[1:44:50] God Lord I pray if there's anyone
[1:44:55] unclean they would in their heart
[1:44:57] spiritually come before the high priest
[1:44:58] the high priest no I'm unclean
[1:45:01] we know that you know Lord God but
[1:45:04] father in those days they had to come to
[1:45:06] the priest and acknowledge themselves
[1:45:09] that they were unclean father help
[1:45:11] anyone who is unclean here may they
[1:45:13] confess it Lord and not be ashamed to
[1:45:16] confess it be ashamed of their sin but
[1:45:18] not to be ashamed to confess it fraud I
[1:45:22] trust no one here wants to be cut off
[1:45:25] from the blessings of God lord have
[1:45:29] mercy upon your people Lord this morning
[1:45:31] father may you lead them to repentance
[1:45:33] Lord I just trusted even one hardest
[1:45:35] help Lord one heart becomes clean then
[1:45:38] the Holy Spirit had his way Lord this
[1:45:39] morning we've labored we preached we've
[1:45:44] saying we've given our gifts lo were
[1:45:46] recognizing the time of the year but
[1:45:49] Lord the greatest gift we could receive
[1:45:50] is the Holy Spirit this morning dear God
[1:45:52] hallelujah Lord wash all those mae-mae
[1:45:56] every person unclean may they come
[1:45:58] before you to be clean Oh God wash them
[1:46:02] by the waters of your word wash them

[1:46:06] in the knowledge of Christ I pray for
[1:46:12] them Lord bring your people to
[1:46:14] repentance Lord those that have sinned
[1:46:15] against you Lord Jesus may this

[1:46:39] how we have to approach we have to be
[1:46:40] clean then we become as it come as a
[1:46:43] sacrifice to the worship of God we let
[1:46:46] you cut us and we let you wash our
[1:46:48] inwards even more we get more sanctified
[1:46:52] and we enter into the holy place and see
[1:46:54] our lives as a dramatic depiction
[1:46:56] polling on the oil of the Holy Ghost
