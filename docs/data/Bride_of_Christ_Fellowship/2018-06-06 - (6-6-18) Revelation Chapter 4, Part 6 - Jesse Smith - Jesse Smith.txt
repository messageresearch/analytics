announcements and prayer requests by God's grace we got here early tonight so I got to pray before service so that worked out really good let's go through a few announcements here this Sunday we'll just have one service I sent out an email earlier today just a few hours ago I will just do one service my family kinda needs to rest and then maybe after that we'll get back to two services once we can get rested up cuz now that my wife had the baby we're happy but now like I do all the chores you know so I do all the sweeping and the clean in and everything like that so just a little extra work there by God's grace so I'm gonna worn out myself but God bless you know my wife woke me up on Saturday morning at 6 a.m. she's like Jessie I think the baby's gonna come today I said are you serious and she said yes as I said Lord can you just make it come later tonight not right now and you know sometimes God answers our prayers sometimes he doesn't but he answered this one because we had Taekwondo that morning so went to Taekwondo and then I didn't want to come late in the night you know so it came at 9:00 9:20 p.m. so just amazing you know the prayers that God chooses the answer you know so I just want to thank the Lord for giving us grace also if anyone else has any questions and answers brother Aaron turned some questions and answers in if you have any questions answers I'll try to those Sunday unless I get more on Sunday then I'll put them off till Wednesday or something like that but like to do the questions and answers if anybody has any others also June birthdays Elijah's birthday's on the 10th I believe that's coming up is that Sunday yeah so I just birthday is Sunday he'll be 13 so that's wonderful then added in Bo's anniversary is on June 20th and then my anniversary with my wife is one day later on the 21st so I don't want to forget that one also again there's a women's retreat I emailed everybody about it a few days ago if anyone's interesting going it's just a bunch of women that go and they collect you their cellphones they collect your cell phones at check-in and now you can if you have children or things like that that lets you go down and check your cell phones but they actually collect your cell phones so you can just have the whole weekend to pray and hear the Word of God it's really really quite wonderful you know as I just been the preacher there one time but they've been doing it like 10 years now sir brother Vaughn asked me to preach again this September so I would like to do that so if anyone's interested let me know if you can't afford to let me know we could help you out by God's grace we want to support people seeking the Lord and hearing the Word of God if we possibly can and also on the email I did have to because of that meeting with Yvonne I had to adjust brother digs her brother digs will come the following Sunday September 30th so it's a long ways off but I just wanna let you know I don't know if you call it that on the email so brother bender ought to be here June 24th then we have our outreach services all July Jim shumake will be here on July 29th now if he's gonna preach the p.m. service if nobody comes but if somebody comes like a newcomer walks in because we sent out the postcards I think on the 18th of June if nobody new comes I'm just kind of Jim preach you know but if we have new people walk in here I'm sure I'll just preach the what I scheduled to preach and they can hear the word of God because it's all scheduled out and they're coming to hear that so I'm sure brother Jim will be okay with that then brother Keith Randolph will preach of Saturday night August 18th and then Sunday August 19th and then brother Diggs will preach to services on September 30th ok pardon me a few prayer requests here tonight please pray for my wife that you know she probably takes three naps a day she's so tired and worn out so just pray for her and the baby that they'll get a lotta rest by God's grace also a woman named Georgia emailed me and her her brother is addicted to alcohol and she said he he really needs deliverance so I don't know this woman but she wants our prayer so let's just pray that her brother gets deliverance from alcohol also an unspoken need for a brother the courts you know he's estranged from his wife or something he so he's not allowed to see his children ever so I just hold my pray for him tonight and he says I don't know if the Lord you know was punishing me I said well you got to seek his face you know then God will show you you know if it's a test or a punishment so let's pray for this unspoken need and then also Stephanie's friend Stacy I guess she's paralyzed now so whatever whatever was bothering her it's it's got worse so I don't know this woman but I asked I asked F&E can I come see her and she's like I don't know so I said let me know if I can come pray for her and then also a friend of mine named John tried to commit suicide but I

I think we'll just read down to the end of the chapter here I'm almost finished you know as I've been studying slowly through brother branham's sermons from 1961 looking at Revelation chapter 4 almost through that there's so much though there's so many details or so many scriptures he packs in there it's just a wonderful process but just a slow process and brother Graham said that's always what brother Brandon do he said I always wanted to go through this slowly so we're fulfilling his desire to go slowly verse by verse through the Word of God and we're grateful for that tonight by God's grace verse five and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and the rest I'm sorry and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come amen our heads in word prayer ever need on your heart just condone unto

here Lord God in your presence as your word is being preached we're grateful for all you've done Lord let's feel your presence O God and respond to it in Jesus Christ's name everybody said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so by God's grace we look at this here tonight we'll keep going here on this Revelation chapter 4 and you can switch over Malachi whenever you're ready buddy so we're looking at the book of Revelation here this is part 6 of this series by God's grace part 76 overall and I want to give an update the the final postcards got approved this week and I asked them to make this stand out but they did the cross instead and I'm like how many times I got to ask him so actually time ran out they had to print them so I just said just leave it as it is just said just send them out I've asked three times they still couldn't get it right so must have been that maybe it was the devil I don't know what it was but I wanted the pillar of fire this to stand out like that and they just couldn't get it but you know this is brother Rams the heart his you know crawling the cross was always on his mind anyway so I thought well you can't really lose anyway you know you got the pillar fire you got the cross so this will be the final one they send out and so in July I will be preaching at 4 p.m. will preach thus saith the Lord for today during that service I'm going to show all that thus saith the Lord's brother Ram said about doctrines today that we need to apply today like Trinity he said Trinitarian em is of the devil thus saith the Lord all these things that we need right now today and then the Sunday after that we'll look at thus saith the Lord all the future thus say at the Lord you know about Russia you know science the seven major visions so if anybody gets this postcard and they want to come here that that's what we'll preach on that day July 15th we had preached on the power of Jesus Christ name through the Godhead water baptism casting out Devils everything's done in his name we could even show the seven compound were names compound names of Jehovah you know like brother Simon preached last time he was here we can preach that too and then July 22nd I want to show the 12 New Testament mysteries brother Branham preached and sirs is this the end time and then July 29th the book of Revelation revealed I just want to go a quick sermon about all these basically revealing all the things brother Branham taught about the book of Revelation and that remember that's the day brother of Jim schumake will be here so if nobody shows up you know we'll just let brother Jim preach that night but if people show up that are new they've never heard the message I want to preach that thought they're by God's grace amen so praise God amen we're just trying to go fishing you know one time it struck my heart you know and I thought well I'll never get any new fish if I don't go fishing right you're not gonna fish aren't just gonna jump into your house are they you got to go fishing so I'm trying to do some fishing here by God's grace so you know either way you know I don't I don't know if you ever heard his testimony but before before Simon and myself and this whole group there was about 40 people brother William that came into the message in Lima okay and it was around New Year 2000 2001 okay so there was like a little revival in Lima 40 people got baptized and most of them are still serving the Lord it was a little move of the holy small revival move of the Holy Spirit and to churches sprung out of it this is one and my brother cam searches the other so two churches have sprung out of it so God was just multiplying and it was all under brother Brooks's ministry there in Lima so anyways but the testimony behind that is that before that happened brother Craig and brother Dave Lewallen they sent out a church age book to every Church in Lima and they never heard back from one of them that's a lot of money and that was you know church age book was I think a dollar or two dollars at that time now it's eight dollars but that's a lot of money that's a lot of pastors to send the church age book to so they went fishing they never they never heard back but then I think a year or two after that that's when that revival struck so I'm not predicting your revival but I'm praying for a revival because we can't predict anything but the idea is we want to go fishing we want to see more soul saved now church if we know brother Rams message then I I lived an hour north of Lima brother I live in an hour north and I didn't even know there was a prophet I didn't even know there was a message of the hour I was just raised in Pentecost I thought all there was was miracles and speaking in tongues that's all I thought there was cuz I didn't know better but if brother barons message is right there was something inside of me there was a deep call to the deep and God knew I wanted the message even though I lived in our north of the message so God made away God you know had people witnessed and allowed us to drive down an hour to do Bible studies receive the message then God sent me all the way to Akron now we have a church here by God's grace so you know so we I take that same idea I don't know if there's anyone else in Akron who wants to know the message but I would have wanted someone to come to share the message with me so I'm thankful for those who did share with me now it's our responsibility to go take it to people who never heard it before amen so we're happy to do that that's what we want to do we're probably like $800 when it's all said and done maybe $900 to to do all that but most of it's already paid for and we appreciate any donations for that but our desire doesn't matter our desires just to get the gospel out praise God now let's look at our scripture this was our text this morning I'm sorry this evening sorry and the first thought brother BAM brings in this message is this again this thought about and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings this is in Revelation 4 verse 5 says and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne okay so brother Branham takes this up and he says he says oh I love this he said don't you he said let's speak on this throne now for a few minutes this is not a throne of mercy Mercy's throne is finished no more mercy house the judgment seat going to be the judgment seat of Christ the judgment seat he said the white throne judgment is there going to be mercy then and he says there's not one stitch or stretch of mercy to be given and that the judgment throne you could scream mercy until you couldn't scream anymore and you just might as well scream out in the air somewhere because there's no more mercy amen so in chapter 4 verse 5 we see a throne where there's no more mercy right it's a picture of after the rapture there's no more mercy to the Gentile people we know that and so the Bible says because John has come up as or a raptured person as the Bride of course is a type of the bride and there's lightnings and thunderings and voices and I just thought this was interesting brother bands that there's not one stretch of mercy to be given God's not going to give anyone any mercy at the white throne judgment but God told us what he's going to give them at the white throne judgement let's go to Revelation 20 verse 12 there is no more mercy God is not judging by mercy at the white throne judgment he's judging by something else amen and the Bible tells us that revelation 20 verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God I think about it Donald Trump will stand there think about that Barack Obama all these men and women will stand there this the small and great will stand before God and the books rope and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works amen there is no mercy here God is not judging and say well I'll just have mercy God is saying you are going to be judged by what you did plain and simple there's there's no other there's no other there's no more second chances this is only based upon what you did on the earth oh my how how every moment is important they meant hi every moment we must be seeking the leadership of the Lord and the grace of God to make sure that our works glorify God amen there's no mercy here it's only did you do it or did you not what are the books say one of the records say were you good to the bride or not is that right where you're good to the brunt that's what are you to the least of these my brother if you've done it to the least of the Christians the least of the then you've done it unto Christ and they're judged by works look at verse 13 and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and the and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them why there's the death angel and they judged every man according again to their works their works right and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written a book of life was cast into the lake of fire there's not one stretch of mercy given and they're judged by their works now the Prophet said now is the day of mercy he said the reason today's the day of mercy is because the mercy seat is sprinkled with an atonement blood and as long as blood is on the judgement seat then there's no judgment no more it's mercy because something died to stay judgment as long as blood is on the mercy seat it showed that something died to hold judgment back but when the church's raptured the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat Abraham said Adam and Eve made as good an apron as any Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostal could make it cover their nakedness but God could see through it so he killed something and took the dead skins of the dead animal and covered it blood had to take its place amen so fig leaf or blood fig leaf or blood a church a church of pretend experience or blood every time we must choose the blood amen we can't choose the cover well I made a mistake this week I've just covered over it and I'm sure God will forget about God does not forget about it we can't cover over any of our decisions or any of our mistakes with the fig leaf a man-made covering or a man produced idea it's all got to come through the blood of Christ and he says think of it the only thing that'll back off God from judgment is blood and there's only one blood that he'll back from and that's his own son when he sees that his own son's blood he'll back off and brother Mannis the old brother I don't never want to stand there at the white throne judgment look at this he said let me stand before a machine-gun I'd rather stand before machine-gun he said let me be cut to pieces let me be sawed inch by inch can you imagine look at he said let anything happen let them split open my belly and burn sulfur and everything else in me he said let my arms and legs be cut off whatever but never let me stand at the white throne judgment before God all right because you're not given any mercy it's just the works that you did and huh me knowing that it's hard without the Holy Spirit's hard to do any works honey no without the Holy Spirit you can't do any good works we have nothing he says let anything be done to me just don't let me stand before the white throne judgment oh my god help us to make sure our works glorify Christ amen then it's him working through us and not us doing it ourselves amen now to back this up brother Ram me you know the lightening of Thunder we went through this a few weeks ago but I'm just gonna skip over a little bit well Ram said the the mercy seat here in Revelation 4 is no longer there's no longer blood there he said because there's lightnings and thunderings and he said real blood on the mercy seat was found in Leviticus 16 on the Day of Atonement which I'm sure you're familiar with on the day of atonement one time a year Aaron could go in there and he can offer blood upon the mercy seat and then God would forgive everybody for the all their years sins they men by one man entering behind the veil and the Bible says now that Jesus has entered behind the veil in heaven amen and the Bible said now he sanctifies all of us because Jesus was sanctified he who was sanctified can now sanctify us amen and he's gone behind the veil in heaven we'd say hallelujah mmm said what Aaron did he sprinkled blood on the mercy seat and the mercy seat is the altar where you kneel and ask for mercy now look at this Ronit said god forbid we ever take it out of our churches the old-fashioned altar where men can kneel and call on God for mercy and mercy is rich and flowing free from the blood of the Lord Jesus amen I don't care how small our churches I don't care how small we get or how big we get there's always going to be an altar in this church because of that quote right there he said god forbid that we ever take the altar out of the church where people can come and find salvation and find mercy flowing richly to them amen if you haven't visited this altar lately I'd encourage you to visit the altar right I try to visit it every week by God's grace and keep visiting it because this is a place they don't have to be here but the point is we have to understand that there's a place where we must find mercy but we've got to go there praise God we can't just well I know it's there and not visit it right like a horse taken to the water but not drink it they got to know they got to do more than just go to the water they got to partake in the water and we've got a partake of God's mercy we've got an experience God mercy we've got to feel that we're forgiven we've got to come to church and leave feeling washed feeling clean feeling new again feeling it on fire for Christ again he said god forbid that we ever take it out of our churches this old-fashioned altar so this is a he said this is just a simple representation of the mercy seat that's in heaven where the rich flowing mercy of God comes down to us through the blood of Jesus amen oh I'm so grateful for that but brother says look at revelation boy said notice it is not mercy there's lightnings thunderings and voices and then he goes to Exodus 19 now we read this a few weeks ago but let's go to 1921 because I just want to this thought brother branham pulled out here I just really liked it rivarly I'm sure Exodus 1921 pardon me I'd never heard him say this before this was really nice you know the story you know God warns them and he says don't let any animals come you know before the mountain they'll be struck dead he warns them about his holiness he told them to wash themselves for three days she bought four hands so they're their holy unto the Lord now look at verse 21 Exodus 19 21 now brother ham reads this that he may and let's read it and then I'll read his comments we're focusing on the word gaze look at this he says and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai on the top of the mount verse 20 and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount and Moses went up verse 21 and the Lord said unto Moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze and many of them perish now it's interesting brother ram starts preaching on this idea of gazing so God was concerned I don't want people just coming to the mountain because they see my pillar of fire my cloud and they see all this supernatural there he said I don't want people just coming up and just gazing and just kind of looking at it and walking away God doesn't want any half-hearted curious scientific minds trying to study his glory and the church said well they have said look he said people will gaze today he said people sit back in the church and laugh as somebody speaking with tongues or laugh at people dancing in the spirit he said they've gone and blasting the Holy Ghost sealed forever whosoever speaks a word against the Holy Ghost will never be forgiven this world neither in the world to come he said don't gaze upon it he says stay away from it or either accept it I'm glad I've accepted it amen I didn't come to the message to gaze and just kind of wonder what that picture is all about it wonder what that Holy Ghost is all about I wonder the Holy Ghost and me praise God but God warns them do not come to gays this is not just something you look at and examine well maybe I'll do it someday maybe I won't that's not how we come to God we come we sell out everything we leave all the things in the world behind like Elijah we kill all the oxen that we used to work with we cut ourselves free from every contact anyone in the world we cut ourselves free from that we come to Christ with all of our hearts amen just don't come in gaze on it experience it praise God amen that's exactly right now if one commentary I read said this and I really liked he said Moses is warning not to gaze at the Lord on penalty of death shows God's concern to protect the Israelites and to reveal to them his awesome personal reality in other words God was going to protect them I'm going to protect you because he Scott is saying I have a powerful presence amen my presence is holy right remember Jesus presidents were so holy that John fell down like he was dead that's how holy is so God was going to protect them you don't walk around in gays and try to play with the Lord show me America do something fancy show me some fire I want to see a lick of fire you don't come to God like that God's trying to protect you from that he says God cannot be treated as an object of curiosity that one might walk up to examine it will and then walk away from without personal engagement see God doesn't want people that just come to observe him and learn about him just to kind of know about it God wants people to come to him that want to love him and serve him amen they wouldn't experience a relationship with Jesus Christ amen so God was protecting them remember when Moses came the burning bush and brother Branham said he didn't come like a scientist saying well I'm gonna take some of those burnt leaves that are not myrrh and I'm gonna take him back to the laboratory and see why they're not burning he didn't come that way and that's what God's saying here you don't come to just gaze upon it and try to learn something intellectual you come here to listen you come to church to hear the word of God to obey the Word of God to surrender to make yourself a living sacrifice to the voice of God amen that's why we come to church because that's what the boy said take off your shoes and the brother band said if he took off his hat he would have done wrong God's very specific if the Bible says this we need to do what the Bible says the Bible says something else what the Bible says God's very specific God has a very easy approach and it's just simply through obedience to the Word of God glory so it's not just a gaze well well that person is crying and shouting and that's pretty neat when the preacher cries and glorifies the Lord and tries to rejoice and the he casts out Devils and prays for the sick that's kind of neat I want maybe some day that could happen to me that's the wrong approach amen the right approach is God I believe it's real I'm gonna support it with all my heart O Lord and then it happened to me let me be a part of it I'm not here to be curious I'm here to receive Amen so Braham gives us this thought if they come that way it's possible they can be sealed out of the kingdom of God forever for laughing at speaking in tongues blaspheming dancing in the spirit blaspheming emotion and all these things if they do any of they blaspheme any of that just gaze upon it and walk away brother and so they can be cut out of the kingdom of God forever oh my how merciful is God now the second thought he gives is on the voices which are some of us are familiar with here but let's just go through it I don't I don't think I preaches too much here revelation 4:5 and all the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices now brother said the voice on the throne he says notice it's not voice you see but Ram says voices he said not one voice voices plural he says what what is it he said it's God speaking to the church reflecting himself through seven spirits mother and said those voices are God speaking through the seven spirits and we know the seven spirits of God are the ministries that God gave to the seven churches messengers how we know that these are voices Bellaire said when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God to read it is to remove the candlestick now it's pretty serious brother Adam and I were talking about this before service it's pretty serious if people won't listen to brother branham that's pretty serious if you don't have enough love and grace in your heart to listen to the man of God something's wrong with your walk with God is that right we were talking about that and it's so true people that we won't listen to brother Branham they're scared to listen to do it why would they be scared they're scared because there's light there's fire there's life coming out of that voice that's the voice of God coming out of that voice we hear the voice I've got enough don't get it mixed up don't worship brother Bram his literal voice wasn't the voice of God when he spoke the word then it's God's voice coming to us when he's just thinking and sharing his thoughts and his ideas that's just the man but when he gives us a scripture or gives us a thus saith the Lord or gives us something that the Holy Ghost told him now the voice of God has spoken Newhouse Amen that's exactly right so yes the voice of God was in brother Branham but now remember the church his book says now the voice is in the bride and the voice of God can be in you whether you're a man or woman preacher or not the voice of God can be in any of us when we say what God wants us to say it's exactly right so Bob Arum says this he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach a sermon he said if you're a preacher you're called to preach to the Pope at the pulpit if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be live and it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it amen so brother M said we're all preachers we all preach and declare the gospel some way or another by our lives right a member in in heaven in Revelation 4 the voices are thundering out in judgment and brother have said your life will Thunder out judgment against all those who reject it that you spent time around amen he says and they say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet they're loving if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up well you ruin them and yourself to just live your sermon the preachers called to preach his and to live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons hey man glory he said this is a quote you're very familiar with he said all right places oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes real Christians that's thunder against the enemy can the church say Amen glory see all these people that you know that got mixed up on the thunders they get mixed up on all these other things and they're they get so mad if you don't see their revelation well that's not that the quote says you have sweetness when you got the thunder of God and they'll cut you out of the church and snow you're not part of the message and you're not you don't see it my way you're not going the rapture and you don't follow my pastor or not going the rapture something's wrong with that because this life thunders out sweetness thunders out forgiveness and mercy and patience was it thundering out the fruits of the Holy Spirit in other words the life of Christ amen that's just one idea that's just one way it expresses itself in the expression of Jesus Christ character amen the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil how many one heard the devil but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God ha ha ha he said say anything to them call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws them away that's the thunder that shakes the devil you can say anything oh brother Jesse you know you look pretty ugly tonight or you're the worst preacher I've ever heard and if I got the life of Christ I can say well praise the Lord anyhow god bless you have a good night you know can I help you with anything you need any help after church here can help you see that's the real Christian when you can and that thunders against safety because that's what the Bible says do not overcome evil by evil but overcome evil with good amen and when you bless those who curse us Bible says like pouring coals of fire upon their head so when you bless them back you are making the devil mad amen you cause up the devil's in that person that said evil to you and now you're making them feel bad because you're living holy praise God and that shake that hurts the devil the Bible that's what I said it hurts the devil amen Oh glory well the band said I don't care if you can preach like Oral Roberts or Billy Graham he said God don't pay no attention to anything that I get he says the devil just sit back and laugh but the devil sees the life that you live he sees how we treat our brothers and sisters doesn't he he sees how we treat sinners who sin against us at work or at school right he sees how we treat them and that's the real life of Christ amen program gives the example necks of the disciples trying to cast out the demon you know the child and they couldn't do it and brother Bram said see he said look he said Jesus come real quietly after that he said Jesus walked walked up real quietly and just cast the demon off he said he knowed he had a he said he said not only a sermon but Jesus had a life not only a sermon he said come out of him that done it quietly he knows what he was talking about he knows what he's doing so Jesus must have been praying even more quietly than the disciples get out of their devil get out of there they just couldn't do it they said all your disciples couldn't cast him out Jesus walk right down there real quiet I said devil leave go like he said you know like what the maniac of gather or something like that go devil command you to leave and it listened to him because of the life that he lived amen that's what we need Church we need the voice of God living through us praise the Lord now program gives us another thought on this in the church age book well Adam said there's voices he says what is uh what is uh so he says waters represent multitudes of voices according to revelation 17 15 he says what is it waters he says our voices of multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Spirit all through the ages has testified to Christ and preaches gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment against the sinner who would not take warning so now we see lightnings thunderings and voices and with the by brother Aaron tells us these voices are the lives and the voices of the seven messengers but now Bertram tells us also these are the voices of all the believers amen so your voice is in that voice amen he said the voices of the seven message will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus who preached water baptism in Jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives but have said all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down through the ages now notice all of them so people that worship brother Brandon said he's the only voice of God he's that's wrong because brother Branham said all seven of them were voices of God down through the age see now somebody that lot worship another brand they'll get upset with you read this because brother branham's the voice he's the only voice of God but see what the Prophet teaches us is that all seven had the voice of God amen which is right hallelujah now let's move to the next thought here by the grace Lourdes this is one we already went over I'm sorry let me go back yeah the spirits of God is yeah you're familiar this but brother Aaron tells us here he said these seven spirits is not altogether meaning that God is seven spirits but the seven manifestations of the same Holy Spirit amen so these seven lamps are actually manifestations of the one Holy Spirit one spirit manifested in seven ways and then program tells us the seven spirits before the throat is the spirit that was in each of the seven messengers giving them their ministries for the age in which they lived praise God so it's one spirit manifested in seven ways just like there's one Holy Spirit who has nine gifts of the Holy Spirit program tell us the same thing there's one Holy Spirit but he has nine different gifts an operation for the congregation right there's one Holy Spirit he's got five preaching gifts for the church it's the same Holy Spirit praise God now let's go the next thought that's just a short one because I preached on that before most supposed to premiere with that one now here's a sea of glass this is the one I had not preached much on maybe if you've heard on it you may be heard more preaching I have on it but you know I'm a pastor I can't preach on everything so I finally got to this by the grace of Lord so revelation 4:6 this sea of glass and before the throne was a sea of glass like unto crystal and the myths of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now let's read this here now brother Branham is going to start talking about the Laver here so in heaven there's a sea of glass what partner in heaven there's a sea a glass but Moses saw first you know in the vision of heaven and then he brought it down to earth so this is what the sea of glass represents here on the earth but the sea of glass that john saw was of course in heaven program said the sea of glass is symbolized in the old temple for moses he was commanded of god to build the temple on earth like he saw in the heavens he said everyone knows that he said he say you have the outer court that inner court the holiest of Holies he said the outer court the next place here was the altar which was called the holy place okay no he's talking about in here the holy place he said but right before that was the sea of brass and that's where we're getting that here he's teaching on the sea of brass now in other words it's the place where the sacrifice was washed before they received on the altar at the brass altar the brazen altar where the sacrifice was burned but Aram said it was sent along about like this here was the sea of brass it was a Laver made out of brass where they washed the sacrifices he says before the sacrifices was burnt or accepted they had to be washed but man said Oh wouldn't that make a sermon right now doctor he said oh my he said oh he said it just strike me wash them before any sacrifice is received to God it's first got to be washed how not emotionally but washed by the word before we can ever come to God with true faith we first got to come by the waters of separation yes sir you've got to come by what the word now I preached this at Sheffield and I preached it here at numerous times before you could even come in here outside of here you had to be sprinkle with the waters of separation how many know that before you could even come in here before God would even receive your sin offering or your burnt offering or your drink offering before God would receive anything from you you had to be sprinkled with the blood of the red heifer which was mixed of course with ashes then it became the waters of separation how many know that by God's grace you couldn't even come here you could even you couldn't even enjoy the benefits of the outer core unless you got sprinkled first amen and that sprinkling meant now you're separated from anything that's dead anything that's unclean you're now sprinkle from that and you had to wait seven days after being sprinkled the first time a whole complete seven you had to be completely clean by sprinkling praise God amen you got a bath on the third day that you had to wait to the seventh day to actually come in here to church service amen you had to wait a whole week before you got to come into church to make sure you're cleaning stock amen to make sure you were really sanctified hallelujah amen and once you were sprinkled out here and you waited a whole week now you could bring your sacrifice here to the priests and look they all got their sacrifices here the priests are gonna cut him and rightly divide them you know on the tables and everything like that they're gonna burn them percent them before God most of us are pretty familiar with that but brother him said oh it struck me he said before and he says this before any sacrifice is received by God it's first got to be washed amen now once you go to Exodus 3 let's turn it on your Bibles I'm gonna probably finish the sermon with this thought here give me about 20 more minutes or so by God's grace I'll do 30 minutes Exodus 30 verse 17 this is quite a thought that struck brother Branham and I and this just kind of opened up to me today I never really understood this here until today Exodus 30 17 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying thou shalt also make a labor of brass and his foot also of brass to wash with all so I just want to let me skip ahead here this is the Salomon this is a model of Solomon's so this is the labor and then there's a foot now this is Solomon's this isn't Moses's okay but Moses this was a smaller version this is from the brazen sea of Solomon's Temple now and just so you this is this is what I learned new today they would not dip the sacrifices in there because that would pollute all the rest of the water so they had the Laver but then they had a foot even in Moses day they had a foot where they would they would take this water and then pour the running water over the sacrifice okay so that's what we see there and that really helped me to understand there that God always had running water because remember God even told Moses always wash your hands under running water right because the disease will spread if you don't have running water honey like the running water the holy spirit amen when God sends a good Holy Ghost shower amen it's a fresh shower a rain of Holy Ghost power down from heaven amen not to worry about any contamination you're just gonna enjoy the blessings of God amen that's right now let me go back to that scripture here I'll go back to this picture so there must be a foot down here at the bottom where they could take water and may pour it upon sacrifices but notice here also verse 18 and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar and thou shalt put water therein for Aaron and his son shall wash their hands and their feet there at when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation which we the boots which I'm sorry which would be the holy place they shall wash with water that they die not or when they come near to the altar to minister to burn off frame made by fire unto the Lord is that striking the priest before they could come here to minister they've got a wash before they could go to their minister they've got a wash so washing was required before they tried to do anything for God I like that honey no you're a king and a priest here tonight these scriptures should be speaking to you if I wanna do something to God I got to make sure my hands and my feet are washed by the waters of the word I haven't touched I haven't handled dirty things I haven't handled dead things I haven't walked in dead pass amen my feet are clean I've walked in the way of the gospel hallelujah look at verse 20 I'm sorry ready to already read 20 verse 21 so they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die not and there shall be a statute forever to them even to him and to his seed throughout their generations so before any worship before any person out here in these think of these dear people they just come to church and they just want to be forgiven hallelujah is that how you came to church tonight I just want to be right with God how many came that way I just want to be right with God before these priests can help any of these dear people their lives had to be cleaned out amen before you and I can help anybody we've got to be right with God amen and not only that but now go to Leviticus 1 verse 8 if you got your Bibles Leviticus 1 verse 8 we'll be reading a few scriptures here so any person could be helped by a priest they had to wash their hands in their feet my works have to make sure all my works are pure before God I've got to make sure every path I've walked in today has been God's pleasure and now now that now that they got washed now they can start serving now they can start doing something now that their hands and feet are wash if not they're gonna die look at verse 8 and the priest Aaron son shall lay the parts the head and the fat in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water and the priests shall burn all on the altar to be a burnt sacrifice and offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord isn't it beautiful before any church members can be blessed the priests had to make sure their hands are washed right and then they would go take their sacrifice they got it examine that sacrifice make sure it's a pure sacrifice right make sure there's no no blemishes on it and then they would take that they would cut it and they would rightly divide it over here and then have to take it and wash it before they put it on the altar God doesn't want any sin in our worship I hope we can see that tonight look at all the washing that needs to be done Church amen I mean there's so much washing involved here but for every single thing we do we got to make sure we're washed in the water of God everything before I help anybody I've got to be washed and then when I have a sacrifice to help somebody I've got to make sure this gets washed the right way and it's rightly divided the right way hey man I got to make sure I handle this deal the right way now for a preacher I got to make sure I preach this the right way it's got to be rightly divided Genesis to Revelation it's all of us say that hard that's for me as a preacher and for the preachers that's for them they've got to rightly divide this and make sure this gets washed and made right before they offer this sermon up to God amen hallelujah it's got to be rightly divided then finally then it gets cost with running water now God will receive that sacrifice that's beautiful and member this one we're reading of it occurs chapter 1 this was a burnt offering remember burnt offerings burnt offerings were not shared burn offering was a total consecration unto God the sin offering you know you'd eat it the the trespass offering other people could eat it different offerings you know drink offering different ones they thank offering there's all these the offerings but the burnt offering was the only offering that nobody partook of except God hallelujah you I'm giving all of my soul to you amen that's what we need today is more burnt offerings amen because members this all the offerings typed out Christ is that what Christ did then in Christ offer himself fully unto God we know he poured out his his soul like a drink offering him prayer you know in the Garden of Gethsemane we know he pulled out his soul like we preached last week with Hannah and a point out her soul unto God you know praying for the child Samuel and all these drink offerings all these things you know David pouring out the water that the mighty men got that was a drink offering a type of the drink offering but here Christ here sees he sees this every part has to be washed every inward part got to be washed and given to God that's how we are every part of our inside has to be given to God wash and then got to receive it all the doors of my life all the doors of my heart every idea that I have all my feeling everything's got to be washed and then presented to God and then got to receive that amen glory that's beautiful that's what the sea of glass is talking about here see it now in this case is a sea of brass at this point now I read in a Bible dictionary today said the Laver was the resident of for the base received and held water from it's this is the base of course look how big this is in Solomon's day there was only one in Solomon's they just made one big one and and the base held and received water and was the place for washing thus the water was kept pure until it was drawn in a vessel for use so the water didn't get contaminated by dipping bowls and oxes and pigeons and all these mourning doves and turtle doves the the water didn't get defiled but then it would actually pull out water with a pitcher and it would pour out upon the sacrifice amen running water only amen oh don't you enjoy a real Holy Ghost shower every now and then oh there's nothing like it by God's grace this is a wonderful Holy Ghost shower now brahim says put on your thinking now let's go to Ephesians 5 let's go to Ephesians 5 in our Bibles so now program takes his thought and he takes it to the washing of water by the word seasons 5 verse now he starts at verse 21 program reads as he says submit yourselves I'm sorry submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God boater have said congregation submit yourself to your pastor pastor submit yourself to your congregation now here's how the pastor does it if little cliques rise up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation praise the Lord congregation if you start a click submit yourself to your pastor and the fear of God and break up the clicks see why can't fellowship with anybody other than my two friends you know those are cliques right they I don't want anything to do with you I'm glad you come to church but don't talk to me clicks you know I never have you over to my house at all I never want to spend time with you cliques but the way we submit to each other is not by dividing but it's uniting that's that's what brother Ham brings out he said don't ease it don't cause cliques in the church everybody be United he says wives submit yourselves to their own husbands how he knows that you women he says the Bible said so in the beginning is still the same today for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ the head of the church and he's the savior of the body so is the husband he says you all know that you married people or children that's old enough to know that he says husbands love your wives even as Christ also another church and gave himself for Rome and said husbands don't you run over your wife don't run over her if you do that you're not fit to be a husband that's quite a statement that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the I'll say the word he says then every worshipper that has ever gains access into this presence has to come by the word there's too many that comes otherwise Melanson I believe in little stories where my mother died long ago and she's waiting for you in heaven program said that does all right after the word has been applied see people want to come to they want to come to church and go to heaven just so they can see their mom who passed away or their dad who passed away and Bertrand said that's not why you come to the altar you come to the altar first he said to apply the word to you he says many people come to altar because they want to meet their mother in heaven that's all right you shouldn't do that but that's not the reason you come to the altar you come to the altar here it is confessing your sins because Christ died for you in your stead by the word oh that's what we need more today don't we we've got to confess our sins amen now just come to church because we know it's right we don't want to go to hell but we've got a company if we've done something wrong we've got to confess our sins and that's why we come so Christ can cleanse us and then we know we're going to blessings after that you see your mom see your dad see your loved ones aunts uncles all those things that's right so Barbara Ham says any sacrifice as now to come according to the word is unaccepted brother Branham said I hate to say this he said but that's why acts 19 is in the Bible so let's go to Acts chapter 19 this is quite a statement 2x 19 in church this is why there's gonna be a lot on the day of judgment especially and we say like this in denomination or non-denominational churches because they honestly think they're going to build go in the rapture they honestly think that but honestly Church there and most of them are not washed in the waters of word for today they're not washed by the word the fresh word the word that you and I love amen the way that we've let wash us praise God and I'm not doubting denominational as I hope I'm not doubting independent churches I wanted to see them all say but they hardly will take any time to listen to us right I try to share about makeup and all these things and they just shut you right now they don't want to hear about it you know so my close friends you try to share about it and they don't want to hear about it but this scripture but I said this is why the scriptures in the Bible because it shows you've got to be washed by the present Word of God the message sour acts 19 verse 2 if you know the story behind this the church at Ephesus was living under Apollo's his teaching which was teaching you must go to John's baptism just the baptism of repentance right and so brother man said this is why acts 19 is in the Bible verse 2 and he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost boater have said see he and Paul told them that won't work your old days of John's baptism which was only a few years old that won't work John will be baptized into repentance not for remission of sins and when they heard this they were rebaptised why by the word they were washed by the waters of the word amen oh yeah and that's what we are Church this is like what we have today we've got the word here and we tell people about baptism about the godhead about makeup about a hair long hair for women all these things holiness and all these things and when they hear it they turn it down and they won't come in me wash by the waters of the word that's so true but a man said that he said I hate to say that that's the condition that it's in how many want to be washed by the waters of today's word oh I do too like I've always said I've I've always said this if there's the church in Akron that preaches more truth than us let's go join them I've always said that if somebody's preaching if I'm off the word there's a greater revelation that I missed or somebody showed to me but with all my friends and everyone I've ever met in this area it has proved to me one thing that God has sent a prophet God sent William Branham with thus saith the Lord and he preached the Bible and the Bible was restored and the Bible and the Bible says that the Jesus will not return to Earth until the restitution of all things until this Bible is fully preached and restored then Jesus Christ comes back in the rapture amen that's been proved to me all these years you know 15 years of the message or so 17 years I'm sorry the message it's been just proved to me over and over again this is the Word of God because you wonder you know you'd have all these friends why can't they see it why don't they want to see it all I'm preaching is the Bible it shows that they don't want to be washed by the waters of God's Word but you and I love to be washing God's Word hey man whatever it says let it cut me let it shuck me like a piece of corn even if I cry or get upset then hopefully I'll repent for that and let everything be torn away then everything be cut away and let it be wash and let me be placed on God's altar where God can accept my life as a living sacrifice a Mahana whatever needs shucker poured away whenever I need separated from then do it Lord because I just want to be like Christ amen it's exactly right like I'm Memorial Day I was walking I was trying to witness you know brother Adam and I always talking about witnessing I was trying to witness to this new friend I just met him he said what I said what church do you go to you know he told me his church says oh that's nice you know he said what church you go to I said we go I said I'm a pastor of a church we preached the message of William Branham he was a prophet that God said and the Bible is restored and we believe in the rapture and everything is restored he's just okay but he's just kept on walking in church my heart just sinks because part of me wants to like jump on his back pack them down to the ground and said did you hear just hear what I said don't you don't you feel like that like do you kind of like shake their face like all right did you hear me God sent a prophet and he's restored the Bible and all the days of the Apostles are restored amen right and you just you tried to witness like you get up in the morning you pray try to witness and just go but you know what there's God it's still gotta be some elect seeds out there there's God at least some seeds out there because we're still here so we'll just keep trying we'll just keep witness and we'll keep doing everything we can there's got to be somebody like me that loves the Word of God glory now look we says that's in the Bible now that will prove to you that not every church is getting washed by the waters of the word I'll say like this I believe like this church most churches today that don't believe the message the the farthest they can get is the waters of separation they cuz they won't even come in to be baptized in the outer court are you with me they won't even come by the Lord Jesus Christ so the very very most they can hope for of is to be sprinkle with a little anointing to feel like they can have some closest to God does every understand like they just they have a they just have some spring clean experience some little emotion some and they feel like they know God but there is so much more how many know there's so much more to God oh never Paul said all the depths and the heights and the breadth and the width of God's love amen the Deb's are so great there's so much more death of God's Word if we're just hungry for it but most church members just go to the sprinkling they just get they feel forgiven for a while who knows what they do after that they might walk back out in the world with a bunch of dead Creed's right a bunch of dead movies and sins and and relationships and fornications and adults reason they might just walk right back out there with the dead stuff but you and I were invited to come a lot closer we're coming to get washed by the waters of word amen glory that's right he says you've got you and I've got to hear the word before you can enter there let me go back we've got to hear the word before we can enter there he says because there's only one way you can approach into God and that's by faith not meet a man not meet a father not me to mother not meet a baby them's all true we will do that but the first thing we got to come is God's Avenue of approach will be washed when we hear the word of God that's why we want people we want people to come and sit in these seats and hear the Word of God for the first time like oh I never knew how supposed to be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ I never knew Trinity was of the devil I never knew that's an addition to the Word of God that's what brings faith when they hear the word of God preached aren't you glad don't you remember when you first heard the word preached don't you remember when that faith rose up in your hearts yes I'll be baptized yes that's God's Word I'm standing with God's Word what happened faith came by hearing hearing by the Word of God that's what we need people to sit and hear the Word of God then faith can strike them because that's the only way faith can strike them is to hear the word of God now let's close with this I got a lot of voice because I was off on vacation all week this week I my voice is kind of sounding kind of good to me like it's not like so I better be careful I better not overdo it you know but let's hear he says brother have cenotes we see the sea of glass it is like an under crystal now he said this is the glass see in heaven but Moses saw as a glass see and then made what was called the brass see this brazen altar and we know what brother Aaron tell us what brass represents say it out loud where's brass represented judgment divine judgment because the brass serpent it was sin already judged now he says now notice this labor was empty now less interesting this Laver was empty brother BAM says in let's go back to Revelation four five and six four six actually revelation four six program causes an empty labor yeah Revelation 4:6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before him behind sibel Ram said and he says and notice this labor was empty and was as clear as crystal he says why why is it clear as crystal and empty he says because the church has already been redeemed amen that's what he says he said but now we notice a little later on though when the tribulation Saints come up we find it again full of fire let's go to Revelation 15 here revelation 15 verse 1 relation 15 1 and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of God verse two and I saw as it were a sea of glass now its mingled with fire it's no longer Crete clear as crystal now it's mingled with fire I'm gonna skip ahead a few slides there to kind of give a picture of it so this is this is an artist idea of a sea of glass and then there's fire mingled in now I don't I don't know I've never seen visions I it could be Dell totally different than this okay I'm just giving you an idea does everyone understand like I I'm not really an artist and I've never seen ever see visions I'm not a prophet either so I don't know what it looks like I'm just giving you an idea but look at verse 2:15 - and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and then they've gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God amen says he says these are the tribulation Saints that come up now to me they could either be the tribulation Saints or the 144,000 and the reason is of that is because in chapter 14 if you read that the 144,000 all have harps in their hands so I don't know it could be program says tribulation Saints here he preaches again in victory day and doesn't tell us who it is in victory day 1963 he just says they got the victory amen and there they are singing about the victory playing on their harps glorifying God amen and they see the thing is I think it's I personally think it's the Jews because they sing the song of Moses that's just my thought but I could be wrong but brother Ham in 1961 he says it's the tribulation Saints so it could be that he says this now now let's read verse 3 and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints alright praise the Lord now let me quote let me finish up here he says how do we come he says we've got to come this Gentile church - the word the sea of glass the water of the word recognize the word the way it's written aren't you glad church brother man just said you've got to come to the sea of glass and guess what we've already come to the sea of glass glory we've already come to the Word of God to be washed by the waters of the word amen glory he says then the sacrifice is received and filled with the Holy Ghost from the inside shining through the light of that age here it comes out of the holy place into here out of the star into here do you get it now I notice at the end of this age John when he saw the seat of brass there it was called clear as crystal what was it the word had been taken from the earth raptured in the church and it was clear as crystal no more blood the church age was over brother ram calls it a clear sea of glass it's just all clear because the church age is over there no blood there there's nothing it's just clear because the church is already raptured amen now let me read this here now the tribulation Saints that come up had went through great tribulations and remember the church will not go through tribulation because they're already in glory amen so brother Anderson this is possibly the foolish virgin in other words the the the Christians who have to go through the tribulation they miss the rapture but they die and the Bible said they got victory over the Beast His image the World Council churches nine over his mark the 666 right the Vaqueros filleted a they victory over the Pope and over the number of his name and stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God amen now brother has said what kind of sermon or what kind of doctrine did they receive and brother have said read verse three again now let's read verse 3 verse three proves that God is one person I don't know if you caught it but verse three proves that and rub and hammers on this if you listen to the sermon what kind of God were these these people with hearts what kind of God were their hearing preached about and brother have said it was not a three-person God so these are not Trinitarians glory now verse 4 verse 3 and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty this is the song of the Lamb so they're singing to the lamb and they sing to the land they call the lamb Lord God Almighty are you with me Church just and true are thy ways thou king of saints he's the king of kings and Lord of lords the lamb is the king of kings and Lord of lords the lamb is the Lord God Almighty not a second person but the one true person of God amen but I said what kind of doctrine they heard see if that compares with the church now see what they wrecked to me not know third person at Trinity but the Lord God Almighty the king of saints amen he said they'll stand there they were washed by the water after they come through the fiery tribulation period so see that's why there was fire mingled in this sea of glass because they had to go through the fire of the tribulation period everybody with me Amen now go to chapter 14 just so you know this is just an interesting thought this is just a minor but this is what I said earlier this could be the 144,000 and here's why I think it is verse 1 verse 1 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's names written their foreheads and I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of the Harper's harping with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth see they were harping with their harps a hundred forty-four thousand and they're singing about they're all about the lamb look at verse four these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb wherever I'm sorry whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits of God and for the lamb I look at this thing I love this thought and in the mouth was found no guile for there without fault before the throne of God let's stand to our feet by God's grace in that beautiful I love that thought where Ensor it's describing the 144,000 and thus cries it describes them as this before the throne of God there is no fault to them how many wonder how many want to stay like that before the throne of God why isn't there any fault because they all went to the brazen altar right they all went to the they all got washed by the waters of the word amen now if 144,000 Jews who were blind into Christ can be the Bible said will be born in one day they'll recognize Christ and they'll weep and mourn and cry and then someday after that or maybe that day they'll get baptized with the Holy Ghost and if God can forgive all their sins and make them without fault before the throne of God how much for us we come service after service not just one natures but we come service after service year after year we come continually to this labor to be washed how do we know that you stand before God without fault before his throne hey man one day they get washed and the Bible said there's no more fault because they came to this sea of glass to see a glass one day and they're completely without fault before the throne of God and you and I get to bathe in this water all the time hey man I say God washed me afresh tonight amen glory let me be without fault before the throne of God so when I pray even if God knows an answer I have no kind of nation I know he heard me and whenever His perfect will is it will be done because I'm without fault before the throne of God I've been washed in the blood of God's own son let's get the Lord Rama pause amen oh my Gary hey man beautiful you and I come to this tonight let's bow our heads here there's anything we need wash from tonight let's confess it to him tonight by God's grace we don't come to play Church I don't come to play Church you don't come to play but we just want to be washed we don't want to try to live off another day or we with all due respect to brother brand we don't want to live off of his testimony although we appreciate it we would have our own testimony we want to feel that we're forgiven that we're washed that we have come by the water [Music] if anyone desires a fresh washing just raise your hand my eyes are closed I don't see any God bless every hand if there's just one hand bless that
