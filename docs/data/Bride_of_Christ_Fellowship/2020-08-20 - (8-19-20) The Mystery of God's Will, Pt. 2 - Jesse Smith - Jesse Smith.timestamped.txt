[23:57] let's take the bible here tonight i'd
[24:00] like to
[24:01] uh willing to get back to the history of
[24:03] god's will series we finished
[24:05] um mystery weekly on sunday night
[24:09] really great series there i'm just sure
[24:12] you enjoyed that i appreciate the
[24:16] feedback
[24:19] uh so let's uh have a scripture read
[24:22] i think it would not be nice if we could
[24:23] go to
[24:25] ephesians one let's go back there just
[24:27] to god's will
[24:29] don't worry about remember
[24:40] let's read uh actually let me just read
[24:43] 789
[24:44] just myself and then we'll read that
[24:45] verse together
[24:48] verse 7 says in whom we have redemption
[24:50] through
[24:51] his blood notice it's not your blood
[24:55] amen remember how gracious salvation
[24:59] through his blood the forgiveness of
[25:01] sins according to the riches
[25:04] of his grace that's one thing he's
[25:05] really rich in his grace remember grace
[25:07] and mercy
[25:08] amen chapter 2 says that he's rich in
[25:11] mercy as well
[25:12] rich in mercy rich in grace where he
[25:15] hath
[25:15] abounded toward us in all wisdom and all
[25:18] prudence if you need wisdom tonight just
[25:19] ask god
[25:20] amen if you need prudence discretion
[25:23] ask god he loves to give it
[25:26] verse 9 having made no notice already
[25:29] he's already made known unto us
[25:31] the mystery of his will according to his
[25:34] good pleasure
[25:35] which he had purposed in himself
[25:39] remember we found out his will was
[25:41] holiness
[25:42] praise god and having no blemish
[25:45] praise god in our lives that's his will
[25:48] for our lives let's go to uh matthew 6
[25:50] 30 we'll read our verses 30.
[26:02] [Music]
[26:09] let's read 30 down to 34. that's the
[26:11] holy spirit to write jesus
[26:14] on three one two three wherefore
[26:17] if god so clothed the grass of the field
[26:20] which today is and tomorrow is cast
[26:24] into the oven shall he not much more
[26:27] clothe you o ye have no faith
[26:30] therefore take no thoughts saying what
[26:33] shall we eat
[26:34] or what shall we drink or where
[26:36] wherewithal
[26:37] shall we be clothed for after all these
[26:40] things do the gentiles seek
[26:43] for your heavenly father know it that
[26:45] you have thee
[26:46] of all these things but seek ye first
[26:49] the kingdom of god
[26:51] and his righteousness and all these
[26:53] things shall be added unto you
[26:56] take therefore no thought for the model
[26:58] for the morrow shall take off for the
[27:00] things of itself
[27:02] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[27:11] [Music]
[27:14] lord willing we'll uh we'll try to just
[27:17] do a quick review of part one i know
[27:18] it's been a couple of weeks
[27:21] the reason i kind of took a break on
[27:22] that was because i i got some good
[27:24] feedback on the iniquity series and
[27:27] i just when i appreciate it i felt a
[27:28] little more annoying
[27:30] i just got to go with the one that i
[27:32] feel the strongest annoying amen
[27:34] by god's grace so uh let's just quickly
[27:37] review i i will honestly try to quickly
[27:39] review it
[27:40] right here so we can be very
[27:43] cautious
[27:46] so remember uh let's look at the mystery
[27:48] of god's will it's stated specifically
[27:50] it's already made known unto us and paul
[27:52] is speaking
[27:53] to holy ghost-filled saints uh
[27:56] of course remember he wrote this letter
[27:57] about 11 years after leaving ephesus as
[28:00] well
[28:01] and so uh he remember he spent three
[28:03] years there
[28:04] and he said i've made known to you the
[28:07] whole council of god's will
[28:09] he already made that known to them and
[28:12] so
[28:13] he was talking to people that already
[28:14] knew god's will
[28:16] how many would agree before you came to
[28:18] god you really didn't know god's will
[28:20] right you didn't know it you felt
[28:21] something in your heart like i know from
[28:23] a child i always wanted to serve god
[28:24] i never could do it but there was that
[28:26] holy thirst in my life
[28:28] i'm sure you felt the same uh but you
[28:30] didn't really know the will of god
[28:32] until you heard the preacher right and
[28:34] then once you hear the preacher
[28:36] then you know god's will it's very sick
[28:38] it's very simple
[28:39] it comes through jesus when he first
[28:40] adam preached he said repent
[28:42] and tell them the kingdom of god is at
[28:44] hand amen
[28:45] so the kingdom of god the will of god is
[28:47] to repent from sins
[28:49] and accept the authority of the holy
[28:51] spirit in your life amen
[28:52] and so it's very simple you know to know
[28:56] god's general will that's made known to
[28:58] us uh
[28:59] it's holiness how many people would
[29:01] really want to know god's will
[29:03] if they when they find out it's holiness
[29:05] how many really want to go deeper in
[29:06] god's will
[29:07] most don't right but but we're ones that
[29:10] want to praise god
[29:12] and paul says that we should be holy and
[29:14] without blame of form and love in
[29:16] ephesians 1
[29:17] 4 we should be remember holy means
[29:20] sacred
[29:20] physically pure and morally blameless
[29:24] so we don't want people to be able to
[29:25] come to our house and say oh look look
[29:27] look at what they're doing in their
[29:28] house
[29:29] they they deserve blame we don't want
[29:31] anybody to come to our work and say well
[29:32] look i can find where
[29:33] they cheated a little bit here they
[29:35] didn't do the right job here
[29:37] we want to be blameless praise god amen
[29:39] and that is the will of god and remember
[29:41] church will means
[29:43] desire choice or pleasure so we say what
[29:46] is god's will we're saying
[29:47] what is god's pleasure what is god like
[29:50] what does god desire
[29:51] he desires holiness amen thank the lord
[29:55] it's requirement for without holiness no
[29:58] man shall see the lord praise god
[30:00] remember the greatest prayer was luke 22
[30:02] 42 not
[30:03] my will but thy will be done the
[30:06] greatest prayer with the greatest
[30:07] temptation with the greatest load of
[30:10] of the weight of a burden of any human
[30:12] could ever experience
[30:13] he he uttered the greatest words not my
[30:16] human will but let the will of god be
[30:19] done praise god that's something we need
[30:21] to
[30:21] learn to pray church in every situation
[30:23] how many learning to pray that
[30:24] amen praise god learning to pray that
[30:27] it's easy to say it
[30:28] like that but you got to say it when we
[30:30] go through the hard trials
[30:32] we got to be afraid god not my will but
[30:34] thy will be done praise god
[30:37] and so we must learn to say that and
[30:40] remember
[30:40] the confusion is can it be no is god's
[30:42] will known or not
[30:44] and am i responsible for it the
[30:47] revelation is god's will
[30:50] is known he initiates reveals it to
[30:52] every person
[30:53] so all men are without excuse and then
[30:56] once he makes it known
[30:58] they're responsible for responding to
[31:00] him
[31:01] and then seeking his future desires
[31:04] praise god romans 1 tells us that he
[31:06] makes himself known in our bodies and in
[31:08] nature
[31:10] and then all men are responsible because
[31:13] all men have a soul thirst praise god
[31:15] amen and every life is a gift amen
[31:20] and then god gives you your soul but
[31:22] then he's going to demand that soul back
[31:24] and say what did you do with that soul
[31:26] what did you do with that nature did you
[31:28] fill with my nature or the world's
[31:30] nature
[31:31] and he's going to demand that soul back
[31:33] i'm so glad to see
[31:34] jesus nature living in me praise god i'm
[31:37] not doing what i want i'm doing what god
[31:39] wants me to do praise god
[31:42] remember we looked at god's sovereign
[31:44] will there's three aspects to
[31:46] it uh his unconditional will we know
[31:48] he'll do whatever he wants he didn't ask
[31:50] you for your opinion
[31:51] and so you don't really care really
[31:53] right he's gonna do what's best he'll do
[31:55] what's best for you but he didn't ask
[31:57] you what you want to happen praise god
[31:59] and then there's the second aspect is
[32:01] god makes his known will to us
[32:03] through the word and then there's a
[32:06] future will that we must seek out
[32:08] and we went through all the scriptures
[32:09] god didn't ask anybody
[32:11] right he declares the beginning from the
[32:13] end he raises up nations he takes them
[32:15] down
[32:16] ah he changes the times and seasons so
[32:19] we can trust anything that happens god
[32:22] already knew it
[32:23] god allowed it and god is with us amen
[32:27] praise god he says i do all things after
[32:30] the counsel
[32:31] of my will what a counselor god's got
[32:34] himself amen
[32:35] how did you have to ask us for the
[32:37] counsel he just
[32:39] he thought about it in his own mind
[32:40] praise god and he got counsel not from a
[32:43] second or third person
[32:44] but from his own mind praise god
[32:47] and he does all things always for our
[32:50] good praise god i know it's hard for my
[32:52] wife and i
[32:53] but this is for god's this is for our
[32:55] good this this little season here with
[32:56] the
[32:57] baby not be in the right position this
[32:59] is working out for our good
[33:01] praise god and so we don't have to
[33:04] wonder church we know god's going to
[33:05] work it out
[33:07] and we finished by by saying that we
[33:10] finish with that then
[33:11] uh we can make our requests known to god
[33:14] and whatever happens we can have peace
[33:16] as long as we
[33:17] express our desire we'll have peace
[33:19] because we know god will do what's best
[33:21] praise god and we know there's the
[33:24] aspects where god says
[33:25] you have not because you ask not now
[33:27] church that deals with unbelief
[33:30] so see you got you and i should be
[33:31] confident if we just ask in prayer we
[33:34] can have confidence that we're not in
[33:35] unbelief we have faith amen
[33:38] we have faith we have a belief that if
[33:41] we ask that
[33:42] we know god can do it but if we don't
[33:44] ask it shows we don't believe we can do
[33:46] it
[33:47] so we know god is pleased when we just
[33:49] ask and say lord if you can do this
[33:51] we would be glorious in my opinion
[33:55] my side i would like you to do this but
[33:57] nevertheless let thy will be done praise
[33:59] god
[34:01] see not asking shows unbelief
[34:04] right but asking shows faith but
[34:07] probably
[34:07] it's even more faith when you can accept
[34:10] that god didn't
[34:11] do you what he you wanted but he did
[34:13] what he wanted and you still love him
[34:15] amen
[34:16] that's real faith amen remember the
[34:18] status clef baby
[34:20] uh they died in germany they wanted to
[34:22] fly brother random over
[34:23] and they said let me go ask father about
[34:25] it remember that everyone
[34:26] and the baby died brother said god said
[34:28] you want to take the baby home
[34:30] and the woman said brother do i not have
[34:32] enough faith the brother said no you
[34:33] have great faith
[34:35] and this proves you have great faith
[34:36] because you still love god
[34:38] even after he takes your baby home
[34:41] that's right
[34:42] so it's great faith church that we want
[34:45] to have
[34:45] and we want to have faith in this hour
[34:48] especially when there's hardly any faith
[34:49] there's hardly any confidence in god
[34:51] there's hardly any revelation of god
[34:54] but we have revelation of god we must
[34:56] act upon that revelation praise god
[34:58] we must stand up on the rock of
[35:00] revelation praise god
[35:03] now the next next aspect is we did the
[35:05] sovereign unconditional will
[35:07] now let's go to god's known will to man
[35:10] now this is known of course
[35:12] uh through the scripture
[35:15] god gives you a thirst and it's your
[35:17] opportunity do you quench that thirst
[35:18] and
[35:19] you just is this a picture of you just
[35:21] drinking in the holy spirit is that a
[35:23] picture of you
[35:24] my children it was so hot this summer
[35:26] they would take the hose
[35:27] sister naomi outside they would take the
[35:29] hose and just go like this
[35:30] ah it took so hot whatever that cares
[35:33] she tried to get me to do it i wouldn't
[35:34] do it
[35:36] i like water but i don't like water that
[35:37] much but
[35:39] is that you spiritually are you just you
[35:41] just have a hose from heaven
[35:42] and you're just letting the holy spirit
[35:44] pour down blessings in your soul
[35:46] or are you stopping that and and
[35:49] enjoying the pleasures of the world oh
[35:51] let's let's receive the fresh water from
[35:54] heaven amen
[35:55] let's be like harrison david let that
[35:58] water pour over
[36:00] pour sweep over my soul holy spirit amen
[36:03] sweet spirits sweep over my soul amen
[36:06] since one or the other either gonna be
[36:08] uh uh filled with the
[36:10] the blessings of god's nature or hush
[36:12] that
[36:13] and do the will of the flesh so we
[36:16] choose
[36:17] the will of the lord amen and then you
[36:20] read the bible praise god
[36:22] and through the bible you find the known
[36:25] will of god
[36:26] now there's two things i'm not going to
[36:27] spend much time on them but church i
[36:29] preached this a few months ago
[36:30] maybe quite a few months ago by now
[36:32] remember it is god's will to do two
[36:35] things to save all men
[36:37] and to fill all men with the holy ghost
[36:39] it is god's
[36:40] will to do that amen you believe that
[36:44] remember that's the scripture second
[36:46] peter 3 9 the lord is not slack
[36:48] concerning his promise
[36:50] as some men count slackness but is
[36:53] suffering to us we're
[36:54] not willing that any let's all say any
[36:57] ready
[36:57] annie let's say it again annie god is
[37:00] not willing that
[37:01] anybody should perish he said but that
[37:05] all should come to repentance
[37:08] first peter 2 4 who will have all men to
[37:10] be saved and come to the knowledge
[37:12] of the truth don't let the devil tell
[37:14] you that god doesn't want to save your
[37:16] loved one don't let him say that god
[37:18] wants to save him amen
[37:19] but you and i need to be open saying god
[37:21] use me to save that praise god
[37:24] use me to share the word or pray for
[37:25] them or or
[37:27] if they get sick i can go pray for them
[37:29] in the hospital somehow
[37:30] lord use me to do it praise god
[37:34] that's biblical proof jesus says it is
[37:37] not the will of their father in heaven
[37:39] that one of these little ones should
[37:41] perish amen
[37:43] it's not god's will god desires them
[37:46] to be saved praise god
[37:51] the bible says hebrew galatians 1 4.
[37:54] while you're going there don't forget
[37:56] hold up there uh don't forget ezekiel 33
[37:58] 11
[37:59] as so say i unto them as i live saith
[38:02] the lord i have no
[38:03] pleasure in the death of the wicked god
[38:05] doesn't rejoice when wicked people die
[38:07] right but let's pull up galatians 1 4 it
[38:11] is god's will
[38:12] who gave himself for us that he might
[38:15] deliver us
[38:16] from this present evil world according
[38:18] to the will of god and the father amen
[38:21] if you are bound and chained up god
[38:23] wants you free praise god
[38:26] that is god's will it is the will of god
[38:28] to deliver us from this present world
[38:31] and his change
[38:32] and lust and desires and addictions so
[38:34] we knew god's desires amen
[38:37] it is the will of god that we could do
[38:39] that
[38:41] he wants that he said he who the son is
[38:43] set free
[38:44] is free in need it's it's so easy right
[38:48] for us to see it now right that god
[38:50] wants us free all we have to do is
[38:52] expose the devil
[38:54] and and make and let people know that
[38:56] he's there
[38:57] and we don't want him there and he can
[38:59] we can be free after that praise god
[39:02] it's such an easy uh thing but it's hard
[39:05] for the flesh
[39:07] to want to let go of the lust of the
[39:08] flesh that's why so many people are not
[39:12] delivered
[39:15] you see church it's biblical truth
[39:19] so see as soon as someone hears the good
[39:21] news they know it it's
[39:22] repent get rid of your sins be baptized
[39:25] go with the holy ghost
[39:26] they know follow jesus right love jesus
[39:29] don't love sin
[39:30] love jesus it's already known to them
[39:32] paul says it's known to them
[39:34] in that manner now there's a great
[39:37] scripture here
[39:40] yeah let's go ahead and read it ah it's
[39:41] just so beautiful how can i go
[39:43] ephesians 1 9 let's let's quote up there
[39:45] ephesians 1 9
[39:46] through 12. some of these things are
[39:49] just so precious i mean i just
[39:51] i know i preached that ephesians series
[39:53] years ago i don't remember much of it
[39:55] now but uh it's so precious let's read
[39:58] this map
[39:59] verse 9 says having made known unto us
[40:02] the mystery of his will
[40:03] according to his good pleasure so his
[40:06] will
[40:07] is his good pleasure which he have
[40:09] purpose in himself
[40:12] so what's the purpose of his will and
[40:14] his pleasure himself and who is he
[40:16] the word amen so his will
[40:19] is the word praise god okay next verse
[40:22] 10
[40:23] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:25] of times
[40:27] he might gather together in one all
[40:29] things in christ
[40:30] what is this speaking of the new
[40:31] jerusalem when is everything
[40:34] all gathered in christ at jerusalem
[40:36] right new jersey
[40:38] you might well you might even say this
[40:40] could be the i wouldn't say that
[40:42] it couldn't be the white throne judgment
[40:43] because then you've got still got people
[40:45] that haven't uh ceased to exist yet so
[40:47] this must be speaking of the new
[40:48] jerusalem
[40:49] both which are in heaven and which are
[40:51] in earth even to him so god's
[40:53] god's god's good will and pleasure is to
[40:56] eventually bring
[40:57] everybody back to christ everybody to
[40:58] look upon christ
[41:00] everybody to worship him praise god
[41:02] everybody to acknowledge
[41:03] that their life came from jesus and
[41:06] jesus sustains their life
[41:07] and jesus gives them eternal life amen
[41:10] because everybody look at one thing
[41:12] christ amen the word amen
[41:15] that's god's mystery of his will it's
[41:18] good pleasure to gather
[41:19] everything in jesus christ
[41:22] verse 11 hallelujah in whom also we have
[41:26] in pain
[41:27] oh i don't have any of this for my
[41:28] parents but i do have some in heaven
[41:30] praise god amen
[41:31] praise the lord that's okay i'm not
[41:33] upset with my parents
[41:34] i'm happy i'm just alive i'm happy i got
[41:36] jesus praise god
[41:38] that's the only real inheritance i need
[41:40] god probably knew if i had a lot of
[41:41] inheritance he'd probably draw me away
[41:42] from the lord
[41:43] right that's what i mean i said god gave
[41:46] uh
[41:47] made him poor because he uh he wouldn't
[41:49] make a future home on this earth
[41:51] his future home would be the new
[41:52] jerusalem
[41:54] let the denominations have their future
[41:56] homes let them have all that
[41:58] but we want heaven to be our future home
[42:01] great god
[42:02] inheritance being predestinated
[42:06] predetermined
[42:07] according to the purpose of him who
[42:10] worketh all things
[42:11] after the council of his will everything
[42:15] is all
[42:16] ordained for god's purpose it's all
[42:18] bringing everybody
[42:19] to a head it's all bringing them to the
[42:21] new jerusalem praise god the believers
[42:23] now praise god
[42:24] who have an inheritance i remember that
[42:26] song i've got a father over yonder
[42:30] i've got a home over yonder praise god
[42:32] church we've got an inheritance
[42:34] amen that the devil can't touch
[42:37] hallelujah amen
[42:38] we've got just houses and lands and a
[42:40] mansion
[42:41] but all outside of that we've got christ
[42:44] amen
[42:45] the greatest inheritance is the love of
[42:47] god hallelujah being in jesus's presence
[42:50] oh my the counsel of his own will look
[42:54] how wise and
[42:54] his great counsel that he has verse 12
[42:57] we'll just stop right here with this one
[42:59] that we should be to the praise of his
[43:02] glory see we're to
[43:03] praise him we're to glorify him that's
[43:06] why he saves all of us
[43:07] all these things he's so merciful right
[43:09] he's so loving and he's so good and so
[43:11] gracious
[43:12] that we'll praise him who first trusted
[43:15] in christ are you trusting him tonight
[43:17] amen let's trust in his blood amen
[43:20] let's trust in his plan that it's all
[43:22] going to work out because it's for god's
[43:23] glory praise god
[43:25] he's going to do great things hallelujah
[43:28] so the second thing is
[43:29] he wants all men to be born again now
[43:32] pull up deuteronomy 6 23 if you could
[43:34] this gives god great pleasure when men
[43:37] are and women are born again remember
[43:40] god did it as the type
[43:42] god didn't bring israel to leave him in
[43:44] the wilderness
[43:46] he brought us out from that that he
[43:48] might bring
[43:49] us in praise god what was the plan of
[43:52] god
[43:53] to take them out of egypt but take them
[43:56] through the wilderness
[43:57] and put them in to the promised land
[44:00] to give us the land which he swear by
[44:03] our fathers our inheritance
[44:05] amen praise god so see it's incomplete
[44:09] jesus brought you out uh but he doesn't
[44:11] want you to stop there
[44:13] he wants us to go possess the land and
[44:15] reign over all the enemies in laodicea
[44:19] he says you're a new creature when
[44:20] you're in christ
[44:22] right joshua them were real were new
[44:25] creatures
[44:26] once they got in the promised land they
[44:29] were mighty conquerors right they were
[44:31] possessors of land praise god oh it's a
[44:34] great picture isn't it
[44:36] and jesus commands all to be born again
[44:38] you must be born again
[44:39] in john 3 7. if they didn't reach canaan
[44:43] they fell
[44:44] short of god's will and jesus cried out
[44:47] he said if any man thirst
[44:48] let then come unto me and drink this
[44:51] fakie of the spirit
[44:52] for the holy ghost was not yet given oh
[44:55] no
[44:56] it's a universal invitation from
[44:58] revelation 22
[44:59] 17 the spirit of the bride say come and
[45:02] let him not hear say come
[45:04] and let him that is a thirst come and
[45:07] whosoever will
[45:08] let him take of the water of life freely
[45:10] oh
[45:11] he doesn't keep anybody out he wants
[45:13] them all to come in
[45:14] praise god oh it's god's will
[45:18] that whosoever will you're probably
[45:21] remembering some of these right
[45:23] all you need church to know god's will
[45:25] and do it is love
[45:27] jesus said all the laws are fulfilled in
[45:29] one word
[45:31] love praise god he says loving god with
[45:34] all your heart
[45:35] and all your soul mind and strength
[45:36] loving your neighbor fulfills
[45:38] every command three times
[45:42] paul says love fulfills the law
[45:46] it's in romans 13 8 13 10 and galatians
[45:48] 5
[45:49] 14 he said love will take care of
[45:51] everything oh my
[45:52] if we just love everybody here we just
[45:54] love all of our neighbors
[45:56] we just love our enemies we have to
[45:57] worry about all the details
[45:59] love will take care of it all praise god
[46:03] caring about people more than ourselves
[46:05] will take care of everything praise god
[46:07] oh it takes all the pressure off doesn't
[46:09] the church
[46:10] just loving god loving people it makes
[46:13] you fulfill
[46:14] it makes you keep all of god's commands
[46:17] go to first john 5 1. in case you pull
[46:19] it up there
[46:20] i don't well one point a couple years
[46:22] ago i wanted to preach a whole series
[46:23] just on the book of first john i
[46:25] probably will
[46:26] if the lord it's such a beautiful book
[46:30] verse one whosoever believeth that jesus
[46:32] the christ is born of god
[46:35] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[46:37] loveth him also that has begotten of him
[46:40] see you can't say you you love say can't
[46:43] say you have the holy ghost and not love
[46:44] somebody who has the holy ghost
[46:46] see by this we know that we love i'm
[46:49] sorry that we
[46:50] love the children of god when we love
[46:52] god and keep his commands first john 5
[46:54] probably verse 3 by now for this is the
[46:56] love of god
[46:57] that we keep his commandments and his
[46:59] commandments are not grievous
[47:01] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[47:04] the world
[47:05] and this is the victory that overcometh
[47:07] the world even
[47:08] our faith so when a person is born of
[47:11] god
[47:11] but born again they got the love of god
[47:13] the faith
[47:14] causes them to work right and because
[47:18] love is motivating it it's not a hard
[47:21] thing to do
[47:23] right when i was when i was uh recording
[47:25] my wife
[47:26] if i i didn't i didn't mind driving
[47:28] three hours every
[47:30] every weekend i didn't mind leaving so i
[47:33] i'd probably stayed to what like
[47:35] probably until like 10 o'clock on a
[47:37] sunday night 10 11
[47:38] 12 1. i'm going to get back to my dorm
[47:40] until 1am
[47:41] i never had any trouble staying up
[47:42] because i was dreaming about my wife or
[47:44] my future wife all the way
[47:46] on the roads in my honda it
[47:49] wasn't a grievous thing and i remember
[47:51] many of those times i get up early go to
[47:52] class at 7 45 the next morning
[47:54] or football practice see love love is
[47:57] such a motivator praise god
[47:59] and it's not grievous to keep the
[48:01] commands not grievous
[48:03] because love makes it easy
[48:06] love operates faith and faith works
[48:09] hallelujah
[48:10] oh my such a plain thing to see how
[48:13] people can miss it i don't see how
[48:15] they just don't want to see it you're
[48:18] seeking salvation church or if you're
[48:19] seeking the holy ghost
[48:21] undoubtedly it's god's will for you to
[48:22] do that
[48:24] undoubtedly there's nothing in the
[48:26] scripture that would ever
[48:28] say different now next let's go to god's
[48:32] known will through the bible
[48:34] is your spiritual food praise god
[48:37] uh if you would uh let get your book
[48:40] john 4
[48:40] 34 please john 4 34.
[48:44] so see that god has a sovereign will and
[48:47] then god makes his will known to you in
[48:49] the word
[48:50] but you and i have to keep feeding on
[48:52] the word
[48:53] because jesus said to them my me is to
[48:55] do the will
[48:57] of him that set me and to finish his
[48:58] work so we have the known will
[49:00] right i mean how do you believe we have
[49:02] the known will of god
[49:04] but you and i can't remember everything
[49:06] in here we forget
[49:08] sometimes to do the things we're
[49:09] supposed to do so we got a daily feed on
[49:12] it
[49:12] and not just feed on it but then go do
[49:14] something about it praise god
[49:16] and jesus said that is my meat when i
[49:18] get up in the morning and i'm hungry
[49:19] my meat is to do god's will amen amen
[49:23] see in other words it's a spiritual diet
[49:26] to do the will of god you've got to
[49:28] die your diet has to be the word of god
[49:30] and then you really read the word we
[49:32] hear the word we hear it preach
[49:33] and then we got to go act upon it i
[49:36] remember our facebook post a few years
[49:38] ago i don't know if case remembers this
[49:39] on a wednesday night i preached on the
[49:41] morning routine and getting up early and
[49:42] seeking god
[49:43] and in case you the next morning i put
[49:46] on facebook
[49:47] uh she said daddy i'm getting up early
[49:49] i'm going to read my bible first
[49:50] remember that
[49:52] i put on facebook i said that is doing
[49:54] the will of god right there
[49:56] hearing it on wednesday night and doing
[49:58] it thursday morning
[49:59] amen that's god's will
[50:02] that's when you know god's word is your
[50:04] meat because you act upon it you do it
[50:07] praise god
[50:09] that's right i
[50:13] and to finish his work i like that
[50:15] finished oh he got something to do amen
[50:18] we're at the very end of god finishing
[50:20] the word praise god
[50:22] we're at the very end otherwise we're
[50:24] the last
[50:25] harvesters amen we're the last ones that
[50:28] are out here we get to be the last ones
[50:31] to finish it up and say there's nothing
[50:32] left it's time to go enjoy the harvest
[50:34] amen
[50:35] amen oh the last one's the finish
[50:39] god's work in the gentile dispensation
[50:43] now in the book i just go through these
[50:45] obvious these
[50:47] are all called the will of god
[50:49] sanctification
[50:50] is the will of god we're not going to
[50:52] read all these because you know keeping
[50:54] your body sexually pure
[50:56] so from fornication homosexuality or
[50:59] adultery
[51:00] finding a home church listening to male
[51:02] preachers only
[51:04] living preachers only and increasing
[51:07] your attendance to church more
[51:09] that's the will of god right that's what
[51:12] hebrews 10 says
[51:13] giving your tithes and offerings that's
[51:15] the will of god
[51:16] abstaining from substance abuse like
[51:19] tobacco alcohol marijuana
[51:22] uh keeping wicked lustful movies and
[51:24] shows away from your eyes
[51:27] being adorned in modest clothing the
[51:29] correct hair length for familiarity
[51:31] water batches of feet washing communion
[51:33] continual prayers
[51:35] giving thanks church if you haven't
[51:37] thank god all week then
[51:38] not tonight tonight to do it praise god
[51:41] that's the will of god
[51:43] instead in everything give thanks this
[51:45] is the will of god in christ jesus
[51:47] amen i like when the atmosphere changes
[51:49] amen i might be tired
[51:51] before the service but when we get in
[51:53] service it's time to do the will of god
[51:55] amen
[51:56] it's god's will to praise him and to
[51:58] pray and pass and give homes to the poor
[52:01] and work it's god's will to work
[52:04] support your family that's god's will
[52:07] obey the government unless they
[52:09] contradict god's commands and worship in
[52:11] spirit and truth that's god's will
[52:13] so this is where people backside they'll
[52:15] come to church and they don't worship in
[52:16] the holy spirit
[52:17] they're already disobeying god's will
[52:19] they're backsliding and then we see it
[52:20] later and
[52:21] you know they stopped paying ties and
[52:22] they stopped coming to church and they
[52:24] go off in some tangent or sin or
[52:26] something like that see it's god's will
[52:29] they instantly have broken the will of
[52:32] god they're disobeying god's will
[52:34] but if you love god these things are
[52:36] easy amen
[52:39] i don't know because it's all about love
[52:42] amen
[52:44] praise god those are just what are those
[52:46] three four five
[52:47] six seven eight nine ten eleven so those
[52:50] are thirteen
[52:50] simple clear-cut will of god
[52:54] now how many people keep those in the
[52:56] churches very few
[52:58] let's be the some of those few let's be
[53:00] the little flock jesus is going to give
[53:02] the kingdom to
[53:03] amen praise god you can clearly know
[53:06] right away i'm out of god's will
[53:08] if i'm doing this if i'm treating my
[53:09] body like that if i'm doing this if i'm
[53:11] not seeking more of god
[53:12] if i'm not worshiping the right way
[53:13] that's why worship is so important
[53:15] praise god
[53:16] with brother amen and malachi with it
[53:18] it's so important that we enjoy that
[53:19] and and do it in truth praise god
[53:22] because if not we've broken god's will
[53:26] and that something's going to happen
[53:27] unless we repent
[53:31] remember all this was prophesied to come
[53:33] elijah restore all things
[53:35] jesus remains in heaven to the
[53:36] restitution of all things elijah would
[53:38] come
[53:39] before the great and dreadful day lord
[53:40] turn the hearts of the children
[53:42] back to the apostolic fathers and god
[53:45] orchestrated all these mysteries to be
[53:47] finished in his lifetime
[53:49] so he could lead you to the revealed
[53:51] word for this day
[53:52] i bought a dictionary of the pentecostal
[53:54] dictionary i've been reading through
[53:56] that and it's awesome to see
[53:58] uh the world world war ii killed the
[54:00] revival of christianity
[54:03] and so after world war ii ended in 1945
[54:05] what happened in 1946
[54:07] god called william branham to a
[54:08] worldwide campaign healing ministry
[54:11] and the book says it the book says he
[54:13] got off on his doctrine you know
[54:15] the surface scene was wrong and all
[54:16] these things but everybody acknowledges
[54:18] william branham started
[54:20] the post world war ii revival and it
[54:23] said it's reached or
[54:24] today its effects still touch every
[54:27] denomination in every church
[54:28] in usa it says main street usa
[54:32] so brother brother went first billy
[54:34] graham didn't get popular until 49.
[54:37] i'm sorry oral roberts was 47. so
[54:39] brother ram46
[54:40] or robertson but rams called the the
[54:42] first the greatest giant of that age
[54:44] he's called a giant in that book
[54:46] yet he was a man five six right i missed
[54:50] him but he was he was a giant in christ
[54:55] he had the floor of god and he had the
[54:57] sword of the king that he lived by
[54:59] praise god he lived by that sword that's
[55:02] what we needed to
[55:03] live by the sword of god's word he was
[55:06] small
[55:06] stature but a giant of faith hallelujah
[55:10] amen so he goes first brother amen
[55:12] there's an article that says in that
[55:14] dictionary
[55:15] in 1950 a thousand preachers gathered i
[55:19] forget where the city
[55:20] a thousand preachers gathered in 1950
[55:23] and the whole event was to honor brother
[55:25] branham
[55:25] for brother brahm inspired a thousand
[55:27] preachers
[55:28] that was in 1950 and that was right
[55:31] after the pillar of fire picture can you
[55:34] imagine a thousand people
[55:35] gathering to honor you
[55:38] maybe it's your funeral but in your
[55:42] lifetime
[55:43] he's been on the field four years church
[55:45] he imagined
[55:46] preaching four years and a thousand
[55:48] people come now not the worst
[55:49] but just to say thank you for showing us
[55:51] that divine healing is possible
[55:54] i don't know yet praise god oh my this
[55:57] is all
[55:58] done to show the last signs of the
[56:01] gentile
[56:02] church with thus saying the lord amen to
[56:05] restore the hearts of the tutor
[56:07] back to the pentecostal fathers oh i'm
[56:10] so glad i can see it
[56:12] i never would have caught it by reading
[56:13] the dictionary i needed god to send my
[56:15] brother simon to
[56:16] make me listen to that sermon praise god
[56:19] oh
[56:20] thank you lord praise god billy graham
[56:22] got popular in 1949 look it up
[56:25] he started a sixth a sixth night revival
[56:28] in new york city
[56:29] and it went nine weeks he preached for
[56:32] nine weeks straight
[56:34] every night i've only done i think three
[56:36] is the most i've ever preached three
[56:37] days in a row
[56:39] of course he don't preach as hard we do
[56:42] we're sweating and screaming and
[56:44] shouting and spitting everywhere
[56:46] i can't hear my voice anymore
[56:50] different kind of preaching he's just
[56:53] trying to get them to the holy arabic to
[56:54] the salvation we're trying to get to the
[56:56] holy ghost
[56:58] it's a whole different thing we're
[56:59] trying to get him all the way to caden
[57:00] he's just trying to get him out of egypt
[57:02] but that skyrocketed him in the national
[57:04] eye history says
[57:08] now what's interesting too they had that
[57:09] meeting by the amen in 1915 to honor him
[57:12] in 1951 god healed that congressman
[57:15] upshur i thought was so awesome god gave
[57:18] him a vindication right from the white
[57:20] house
[57:20] well around the white house he wasn't
[57:23] the president
[57:24] but no man around the the capital could
[57:27] say
[57:28] oh god doesn't heal god raised up a man
[57:30] in a wheelchair amen
[57:32] amen through this prophet hallelujah
[57:34] amen
[57:35] and then they say well in the 60s he
[57:38] started
[57:38] forcing everybody to get out of that
[57:40] trinitarian baptism and
[57:42] uh said there was a sir see the serpent
[57:44] and they they misinterpreted the
[57:46] dictionary
[57:47] oh if only they look in this dictionary
[57:49] praise god
[57:50] right and it is scriptural it is the
[57:52] bible truth amen
[57:54] they think he went down yeah he went
[57:56] down in popularity
[57:57] but he came up and trained as a giant in
[58:00] faith amen
[58:01] hallelujah well i've just been so
[58:03] encouraged by reading the history the
[58:05] more you read
[58:05] the more you realize we got the truth
[58:07] saints we are
[58:09] in the truth of god's word amen there's
[58:11] no doubt about it
[58:13] and then you see billy graham and his
[58:14] wife they're all painted face like
[58:15] jezebel someone got skirts on some got
[58:17] pants up
[58:18] they're nice people somebody married
[58:19] some one of his daughters been married
[58:20] three or four times
[58:22] is on i think the fourth marriage trying
[58:24] to preach
[58:25] and write books now see they're fine
[58:28] people
[58:29] nice people nice people but that's not a
[58:32] life
[58:32] that's dedicated to all the will of god
[58:35] because the known will of god tells you
[58:37] the known will of god tells you not to
[58:39] do those things praise god
[58:44] ah thank the lord but see what is the
[58:47] church they fail
[58:48] many of these fail in first peter 4 2
[58:51] they are not established in the present
[58:53] truth
[58:55] that's i like jason demar's ministry
[58:57] name present truth ministries
[58:59] we must be established in the present
[59:02] truth
[59:03] it's the church is not the truth ever
[59:04] changed but the amount of truth
[59:06] available changed do you remember the
[59:09] church but ransom the key started
[59:11] of the bible is that god never changes
[59:14] nor do his ways
[59:17] but by the way i'm saying but do you
[59:18] remember god never said the church
[59:20] wouldn't change
[59:21] i don't remember that but
[59:24] i said god will never change he said
[59:26] what the church will
[59:28] see each age they lost a little bit of
[59:30] god's word
[59:31] till the fourth age you just had little
[59:33] groups you know on the
[59:34] outward parts of europe that were hiding
[59:37] out in monasteries or having holy ghost
[59:39] revivals and little churches
[59:41] way far away from rome and italy uh
[59:44] until god raised up a martin luther god
[59:46] rose up martin luther right out of the
[59:48] catholic system
[59:48] and condemned them everything it was
[59:50] amen amen
[59:52] if he called somebody right out of the
[59:53] midst of that and he didn't have all the
[59:55] truth but he had enough to start a
[59:57] reformation praise god
[59:59] oh man and so there wasn't as much
[1:00:02] revelation
[1:00:03] until god gave more with wesley and then
[1:00:05] god gave more to zeus the street
[1:00:07] and then god gave the full council with
[1:00:10] his prophet
[1:00:11] that's right church the present truth
[1:00:13] did you have it up there
[1:00:15] uh if you could please first peter 4 2
[1:00:18] for valentine
[1:00:22] that he should no longer live the rest
[1:00:24] of his time in the wilderness
[1:00:26] one hold on the rest of time is flush to
[1:00:28] the lust tonight but to the will of god
[1:00:30] okay
[1:00:30] well anyways that's a scripture where we
[1:00:32] must live
[1:00:33] oh yeah i'm way ahead of myself second
[1:00:36] peter 1 12
[1:00:37] but just yeah go to second peter 1 12
[1:00:40] but note there church
[1:00:41] you lived according to the will of the
[1:00:43] flesh before but now as a christian
[1:00:45] we have to live god's pleasure we have
[1:00:48] to live
[1:00:49] god's desire but what does god desire of
[1:00:52] me at this point in my life
[1:00:53] that's what we got to know we got to
[1:00:55] know that
[1:00:57] look at this one wherefore i will not be
[1:01:00] negligent to put you always in
[1:01:01] remembrance of these things
[1:01:02] though you know them and be established
[1:01:05] in the present truth he was saying
[1:01:07] there's a truth that's present that they
[1:01:09] had to receive in that day
[1:01:11] and so it is in every day you have to
[1:01:12] receive the truth that's available
[1:01:14] in that day praise god
[1:01:19] now no longer live the flesh but to the
[1:01:22] will of god
[1:01:26] now we need a hungry heart like dave you
[1:01:28] know what david said
[1:01:30] david had the word but you know what
[1:01:31] david said in psalms 143 10
[1:01:33] he said teach me to do thy will
[1:01:36] that's what we need that's what i need
[1:01:40] i need i need to have a humble heart and
[1:01:42] say god teach me to do your will
[1:01:45] because there's times i don't do your
[1:01:47] pleasure i do my pleasure
[1:01:49] instead of your pleasure but david
[1:01:52] said teach me to do thy will for thou
[1:01:54] art my god in other words
[1:01:55] don't let me be god you'll be let let me
[1:01:58] acknowledge you're my god
[1:02:00] that means i worship the god of this
[1:02:02] world satan
[1:02:03] let me worship you because you're the
[1:02:05] one who made this world
[1:02:07] amen but i gotta be taught how many are
[1:02:09] you learning tonight
[1:02:10] amen are we learning tonight or tonight
[1:02:12] at night off if you don't learn anything
[1:02:14] is it night off i don't think so i think
[1:02:17] tonight's a good night we can learn
[1:02:19] see teach me here's a man that slew
[1:02:21] giants within
[1:02:23] he defeated kingdoms constantly i'm
[1:02:26] reading through i'm at the end of the
[1:02:27] first saturday right up
[1:02:28] you slew everybody fight and destroy
[1:02:32] take back ziklag and just defeat
[1:02:33] everybody everybody fell
[1:02:35] but he's praying god teach me to do your
[1:02:38] will
[1:02:39] that's a humble that's a man after god's
[1:02:41] own heart
[1:02:43] not my god thy spirit is good lead me
[1:02:45] into land
[1:02:46] it's a land it's a promised land
[1:02:49] it's a spiritual land amen when we obey
[1:02:53] god and do his will
[1:02:54] it's a land it's a new uh it's a new
[1:02:57] experience i'll say like that
[1:03:00] it's a new life oh thank you jesus
[1:03:05] remember ephesians 5 17 be not unwise
[1:03:09] but understand what the will of god is
[1:03:11] now that's a good prayer church
[1:03:13] teach me to do your will and help me to
[1:03:15] understand your will
[1:03:17] oh god give us humble hearts like that
[1:03:19] we come to church and say god
[1:03:21] teach me and also help me understand it
[1:03:25] help me to understand why would you want
[1:03:26] me to do this why would i choose this or
[1:03:28] why would i sacrifice this and do this
[1:03:30] lord teach me
[1:03:31] and also help me to understand your will
[1:03:36] understanding what the will of the lord
[1:03:38] is
[1:03:39] james 1 5 if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:03:41] him ask god
[1:03:42] that give it to all men liberally and
[1:03:44] upbringeth not and it shall be given to
[1:03:46] them
[1:03:47] i was wondering for years but amen why
[1:03:49] do we have such a small church then god
[1:03:50] sent brother ray
[1:03:52] what i just had to ask right just had to
[1:03:54] ask
[1:03:55] and say lord what what is why is your
[1:03:57] what's your will about this why
[1:03:59] why how come it's so hard or how come
[1:04:01] it's there's
[1:04:02] things i thought would happen that
[1:04:03] haven't happened and god is faithful
[1:04:06] if you ask and wait upon the lord god
[1:04:08] will answer your prayer amen
[1:04:10] hallelujah patience is the key attribute
[1:04:14] hebrews 10 35-38 said cast not away
[1:04:17] therefore your confidence amen let's be
[1:04:19] confident in god
[1:04:20] which has great recompense of reward for
[1:04:23] you have need of patience that after
[1:04:25] you've done the will of god
[1:04:27] you might receive the promise amen amen
[1:04:31] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:04:33] come will come
[1:04:34] and will not care not terry
[1:04:38] when's the rapture going gonna come for
[1:04:39] just a little while
[1:04:41] so the word says yes right that's what
[1:04:44] the word says a little while and he'll
[1:04:46] come
[1:04:48] now the just shall live by faith amen
[1:04:51] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[1:04:54] have no pleasure in him
[1:04:56] see he has pleasure and those who wait
[1:04:58] for him
[1:04:59] and those who can be patient praise god
[1:05:02] and know
[1:05:02] that he's coming in a little while
[1:05:04] praise god
[1:05:07] amen let me close with a few more
[1:05:09] thoughts
[1:05:10] now in the book i show how the statue of
[1:05:12] perfect man connects to the known will
[1:05:14] of god
[1:05:14] god shows you the steps to become like
[1:05:16] christ it's known
[1:05:18] it's not a mystery how you get the holy
[1:05:19] ghost it's known each attribute each
[1:05:22] anointing is known right just like
[1:05:25] israel could know all the way from egypt
[1:05:27] they could know all the towns
[1:05:28] they could know all the deserts they
[1:05:30] passed through until they got to the
[1:05:32] promised land
[1:05:34] you can know it and paul said god has
[1:05:37] already made known unto us
[1:05:39] the mystery of his will
[1:05:43] oh hallelujah thank the lord
[1:05:50] all right i got a little bit of time
[1:05:51] left here let me see yeah let me just
[1:05:53] try to get through this section here
[1:05:55] so there's two principles that govern
[1:05:57] god's
[1:05:58] progressive will for man
[1:06:02] okay there's two things that uh
[1:06:05] govern it okay
[1:06:09] because after you're saved after you got
[1:06:10] the holy ghost because i said how many
[1:06:12] got the holy ghost most hands would go
[1:06:13] up right
[1:06:14] but after you get the holy ghost you
[1:06:16] still wonder what does god want me to do
[1:06:20] so there's two things that uh have to be
[1:06:23] made known after that
[1:06:26] all right his future plans are called
[1:06:30] the progressive will of god we would
[1:06:31] call it that
[1:06:32] the plans are already known to god but
[1:06:35] they're unknown to you and i
[1:06:37] he reveals his future desires as you
[1:06:39] seek his guidance
[1:06:41] traveling on this earthly pilgrimage
[1:06:45] so here's the two principles that will
[1:06:46] govern god's future will
[1:06:48] the first one is that his will will
[1:06:51] align perfectly with his known will in
[1:06:54] the bible
[1:06:56] praise god so anything god asks you to
[1:06:59] do if it's his perfect progressive will
[1:07:01] it'll line up exactly with the word of
[1:07:03] god
[1:07:04] and second it will happen in his
[1:07:07] ordained
[1:07:08] time in season hallelujah
[1:07:13] put up hebrews 11 8 uh if you could
[1:07:15] occasionally please
[1:07:16] abraham is the example abraham was
[1:07:18] constantly seeking the progressive will
[1:07:20] of god
[1:07:22] god said god called to abraham and the
[1:07:25] bible said
[1:07:26] he was called into a place which he
[1:07:28] should have to receive for an
[1:07:29] inheritance
[1:07:30] he obeyed and he went there not knowing
[1:07:33] where
[1:07:33] he went so abraham just acted on the
[1:07:37] word of god
[1:07:38] praise god a lot of us maybe don't know
[1:07:40] where our life is going
[1:07:42] right we might not know exactly where
[1:07:44] we're going give me
[1:07:45] five minutes here that's 40 minutes
[1:07:47] already
[1:07:49] a lot of us don't know what the future
[1:07:50] holds right
[1:07:53] a lot of us don't know like what's going
[1:07:54] to happen with our families what's going
[1:07:56] to happen
[1:07:56] with our jobs there's a lot of
[1:07:58] uncertainty right
[1:08:00] what's going to happen with the church
[1:08:02] or god going to send me to another
[1:08:04] church
[1:08:05] like a lot of us don't know there's
[1:08:07] uncertainty
[1:08:08] but we have to go by what god has made
[1:08:10] known to us
[1:08:12] and act upon it just like abraham
[1:08:15] we've got to obey what god has already
[1:08:18] made known to us
[1:08:21] and abraham was content the bible said
[1:08:23] each day he just waited for the next
[1:08:25] voice from god
[1:08:27] he just kept waiting he's the father of
[1:08:29] what faith
[1:08:31] see faith will grab ahold and obey what
[1:08:33] you know i know god wants me to do this
[1:08:36] i'll do it i'll act upon it i don't know
[1:08:38] everything but i'll act upon what god
[1:08:40] told me to do
[1:08:41] i'll obey and i'll walk by faith by
[1:08:44] sight
[1:08:45] praise god that's what we need today
[1:08:48] people that
[1:08:49] walk by faith and not by sight
[1:08:54] praise god he was content
[1:08:57] he was waiting for the next revelation
[1:08:59] see he went from city to city
[1:09:01] we go from faith to faith we go
[1:09:04] from glory to glory amen now we might go
[1:09:08] city of the city sometimes right
[1:09:10] but he went from city to city and he was
[1:09:13] going
[1:09:13] fake the faith so we do the same thing
[1:09:18] now here's some good examples god's will
[1:09:21] will always agree
[1:09:23] with his written word like when satan
[1:09:24] tempted christ and he tried to take him
[1:09:27] immediately rule over the nations don't
[1:09:29] wait take it now
[1:09:32] see the same the same impatience we
[1:09:34] talked about
[1:09:35] don't wait jesus take rule now you just
[1:09:38] got to bow down
[1:09:39] and worship me see but jesus triumph
[1:09:43] right he didn't have to do america he
[1:09:45] just obeyed the known will of god amen
[1:09:51] known will of god said never worship
[1:09:52] anybody but god well that's
[1:09:54] that should be pretty easy right
[1:09:57] so jesus kept that first principle it
[1:10:00] always will align with god's perfect
[1:10:02] will
[1:10:04] his progressive will made known it will
[1:10:07] always line up
[1:10:08] with the written word of god
[1:10:12] seems pretty easy how many would say
[1:10:13] amen seems pretty easy
[1:10:16] david tried to bring the ark back right
[1:10:18] but failed
[1:10:19] because he disobeyed one word it
[1:10:21] couldn't be on a cart it had to be on
[1:10:23] the shoulder brother ram said i heard
[1:10:24] him say it this week
[1:10:25] he said it was right above the left
[1:10:26] shoulder right above the heart
[1:10:28] the words got to be carried above the
[1:10:30] heart of a living man
[1:10:32] right
[1:10:35] you i'm sorry uza died god smote him
[1:10:39] three months later david fully obeys
[1:10:42] and he worships god the same way but
[1:10:45] this time they get blessings from it
[1:10:47] everybody gets blessings because david
[1:10:49] lined up everything with the known will
[1:10:51] of god
[1:10:52] amen praise god daniel 9 verses 1 and 2.
[1:10:56] daniel saying god show me your
[1:10:59] progressive will for israel
[1:11:01] how long is israel going to be out of
[1:11:02] the promised land how did he know
[1:11:04] he read the bible said in verse 2 he
[1:11:07] knew
[1:11:08] that the 70-year exile was about to come
[1:11:10] up because he read jeremiah's books
[1:11:13] amen he just put his he just put his
[1:11:15] eyes on this book
[1:11:17] and this book revealed god's future
[1:11:19] plans for israel
[1:11:20] he just had to keep reading church let's
[1:11:23] keep reading praise god
[1:11:24] there's so much there's so much bible we
[1:11:26] haven't really studied over right
[1:11:29] how many old testament texts are there
[1:11:30] where we haven't read over them
[1:11:32] but some of them may unlock blessings
[1:11:35] for us praise god
[1:11:36] some of them may reveal god's future
[1:11:39] will for our lives praise god
[1:11:41] like that one brother samuel brown has
[1:11:43] shared with me in genesis 12
[1:11:45] the bible said abraham god said i'm
[1:11:47] going to bless you
[1:11:48] and you're going to be a blessing to
[1:11:49] others and the revelation from that
[1:11:52] samuel told me he said wherever your
[1:11:53] home church is he said you'll be a
[1:11:55] blessing to other people
[1:11:57] and people will bless you i know that's
[1:11:59] beautiful
[1:12:00] that's a beautiful revelation brother
[1:12:01] may have never said that but it's in the
[1:12:04] bible praise god
[1:12:05] and you can see how that's a revelation
[1:12:08] that opened up further
[1:12:09] well i see my i see people being blessed
[1:12:11] by me and i'm being blessed by other
[1:12:12] people praise god
[1:12:14] just like abraham whoever blesses you
[1:12:16] will be blessed
[1:12:19] see the known will of god
[1:12:24] who will always the progressive will of
[1:12:25] god what he's going to have you to do
[1:12:27] will always line up
[1:12:28] with the previous known will of god
[1:12:31] remember i mentioned hananiah and
[1:12:33] jeremiah on sunday
[1:12:35] and i said two years jeremiah
[1:12:38] said us uh 70 years
[1:12:41] and the reason he knew jeremiah knew
[1:12:44] that because elijah had already i'm
[1:12:45] sorry ezekiel had already said
[1:12:47] all those years i'm sorry there's my
[1:12:50] time all right let me close
[1:12:53] in other words church no matter how
[1:12:54] strong you feel about a decision
[1:12:56] we must first see if it lines up with
[1:12:59] god's will
[1:13:00] and the example i use lord willing in
[1:13:02] the book like a woman cutting her hair
[1:13:04] well i'll give my hair to a cancer
[1:13:06] patient
[1:13:06] that breaks the known will of god and so
[1:13:09] i put the book
[1:13:10] lay hands on the person with cancer
[1:13:12] right
[1:13:13] don't break the word obey the word
[1:13:16] anoint the person with oil
[1:13:17] pray for them maybe god will do a great
[1:13:20] miracle praise god
[1:13:22] but it doesn't do us any good to break
[1:13:24] the known will of god
[1:13:26] when we're trying to find the
[1:13:27] progressive will of god in other words
[1:13:29] the future will of god
[1:13:30] it does it's no good to break the word
[1:13:31] of god i've seen it in many cases i
[1:13:34] can't remember that i can't remember the
[1:13:35] exact examples but i've seen women with
[1:13:37] long hair
[1:13:38] cut their hair and they become an awful
[1:13:42] uh aggressive arrogant person
[1:13:45] domineering dominate that's the word
[1:13:48] i've
[1:13:48] i can't remember i was going to think of
[1:13:50] some examples but i've seen them have
[1:13:52] long hair
[1:13:53] cut their hair and it's like they're
[1:13:54] like the big boss now because they cut
[1:13:56] their hair
[1:13:57] you can see the effects of it church
[1:13:59] because it breaks the
[1:14:00] known will of god god has a desire it's
[1:14:03] the best design
[1:14:04] let's stay with god's design amen
[1:14:08] very simple a man that's tempted to
[1:14:11] commit adultery
[1:14:12] or a man that's not married uh to commit
[1:14:15] fornication you know that's not the will
[1:14:17] that's not that goes against
[1:14:18] the known will of god god's not gonna
[1:14:20] lead you to that
[1:14:21] uh deuteronomy 13. keep it up here real
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] quick
[1:14:28] a good one deuteronomy 13 1-3
[1:14:34] if there arise among you a prophet or a
[1:14:36] dreamer of dreams
[1:14:37] and giveth me a sign or a wonder and the
[1:14:39] sign or the wonder come to pass
[1:14:41] wherefore he spake unto thee saying let
[1:14:43] us go
[1:14:43] after other gods which thou has not
[1:14:45] known and let us serve them
[1:14:47] thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
[1:14:49] that prophet or that dreamer of dreams
[1:14:51] for the lord your god prove with you to
[1:14:54] know whether you will love the lord your
[1:14:56] god with all your heart and with
[1:14:58] all your soul praise god
[1:15:02] see church do not follow
[1:15:06] anything that's outside the word no
[1:15:07] matter what sign or wonder
[1:15:09] because it's a test of your love for god
[1:15:13] god's testing us some people have
[1:15:16] miracles and their churches
[1:15:18] they got a better church in us or maybe
[1:15:20] that maybe there's something about that
[1:15:21] we'll just sit around and watch and see
[1:15:23] where they're pointing brother says
[1:15:25] right you saw the silence remember he
[1:15:27] said always listen for the voice of the
[1:15:29] sign
[1:15:30] after you see a sign what is it going to
[1:15:32] say afterwards
[1:15:34] like i'll give you example
[1:15:35] jeffersonville they had actually a man
[1:15:36] rise from the dead in their church a few
[1:15:38] years ago
[1:15:38] but what has the voice said afterwards
[1:15:42] they said the wrong thing it's not
[1:15:44] saying the right thing
[1:15:46] this week i've debated somebody who goes
[1:15:47] to that church uh
[1:15:49] i haven't heard back from the pastor
[1:15:50] either but he
[1:15:52] he he was saying every word is not saved
[1:15:55] the lord
[1:15:56] he said billy paul is joseph that was
[1:15:58] thus saith the lord
[1:16:00] and then it was changed to joseph like
[1:16:02] thus say the lord can change
[1:16:03] it can't he said i should have had thus
[1:16:06] saith the lord
[1:16:07] uh the white horse rider was the holy
[1:16:09] spirit but man said and then not three
[1:16:10] years later he said it's the
[1:16:12] uh the antichrist i said how can that be
[1:16:15] thus saith the lord
[1:16:16] he said there both us save the lord he
[1:16:18] said that's getting close to blasphemy
[1:16:20] right there
[1:16:21] but look what i'm saying church no
[1:16:23] matter if they have someone rise from
[1:16:24] the dead i mean they have miracles
[1:16:26] no doubt uh you know clapping and
[1:16:29] worshiping you get the anointing right
[1:16:30] but watch the voice that follows the
[1:16:33] sign praise god
[1:16:35] and look at this example they tell you
[1:16:37] to go do something you know is outside
[1:16:39] the word of god
[1:16:40] and god said i'm testing you i want to
[1:16:42] see if you love the word
[1:16:44] more than you love a movement praise god
[1:16:47] do you love the word
[1:16:48] more than you love popularity you have
[1:16:50] the word more than you love money
[1:16:51] you know the word more than anything
[1:16:53] let's love god's word amen
[1:16:56] verse four sorry yes
[1:16:59] first let me finish verse three to know
[1:17:01] whether you love the lord your god with
[1:17:02] all your heart with all your soul
[1:17:03] for ye shall walk after the lord your
[1:17:06] god and fear him and keep his commands
[1:17:08] and obey his voice
[1:17:09] and he shall serve him and cleave unto
[1:17:11] him
[1:17:12] and that prophet or that dreamer of
[1:17:14] dreams which will be shall be put to
[1:17:15] death
[1:17:16] because he has spoken to you to turn o
[1:17:17] you away from the lord your god
[1:17:20] anything that takes away your worship
[1:17:22] from jesus christ
[1:17:25] is turning you away from true worship
[1:17:28] which brought you out of the land of
[1:17:29] egypt and redeemed you out of the house
[1:17:31] of bondage
[1:17:32] to thrust thee out of the way which the
[1:17:34] lord thy god commanded thee to walk
[1:17:36] so shalt thou put that evil
[1:17:39] out of the midst of thee look at verse 6
[1:17:42] and thy brother
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:57] the bible says in verse 8 do not conceal
[1:17:59] him but surely he put him to death
[1:18:02] verse 10 says because he has sought to
[1:18:04] thrust thee away
[1:18:05] from the lord thy god so god says
[1:18:08] whether they have a sign or wonder
[1:18:09] whether they just
[1:18:11] nobody secretly know let's go up and
[1:18:13] drive this he said
[1:18:15] get that person away from you
[1:18:19] flee from the devil right resist the
[1:18:20] devil he'll flee from you and cleave
[1:18:22] unto god
[1:18:23] let's stand to our feet praise
[1:18:27] musicians if you like to come
[1:18:41] praise the lord
