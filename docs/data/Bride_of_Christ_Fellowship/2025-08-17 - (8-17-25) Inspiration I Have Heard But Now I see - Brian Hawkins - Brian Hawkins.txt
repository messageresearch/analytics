TRANSCRIPT
========================================
It says that this is my story and this is my song. What does that mean? That's that means you have your own experience with the Lord. This is my story. This is your story. This is your story to tell. This is your story to testify of, right? This is your song. This is a song that you can sing. Why? Because there's something that struck you and it applies to you. It's something that you have that you can give praise to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh just might as well get into the word. I've I've got uh many many pages here, but we don't we don't count the the quality of a service on how many pages you have, but uh just don't want to be dependent on the notes, but just want to be dependent on the on the spirit of the Lord. Amen. So, if you would turn with me to Job chapter 32. Appreciate the prayers. Appreciate the love that y'all have for us. and I'd probably be in trouble if I didn't do so. You know, everybody back home in Pennsylvania says hello. And uh it's been a busy summer. We've been to BYC. We just came back from TWT. We're getting ready to have our own uh Labor Day meetings and uh just a lot of things going on. There's meetings going on everywhere. Uh so what excuse would people have to not get closer to the Lord? Right. I mean, I I understand if you can't afford to travel, you know, we we understand those things, but the Lord knows your heart. And I'm not here to condemn you on those things, but I just think of the world uh the the people that uh they're just laden with excuses, excuse after excuse of why they can't do something, of why they won't surrender, why they won't go to church. You know, there's there's all kinds of excuses. But he that loves the Lord is not going to keep himself or herself away from the house of worship. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother, &gt;&gt; so uh Job chapter 32, let's start in the first verse. I wasn't going to read this, but I I was reading in the office and uh I was reading about that and I was like, you know, I should probably include this in here, so it might be a little lengthier. It might take what, a couple minutes. We have a couple extra minutes today, don't we? Yes, sir. But, uh, it's it's always good to go back to see what the thought is, you know, to to see where it started, you know, and you'd have to do that from Genesis to Revelation if you preach, you know, because Brother Jesse probably knows that when you start into something, well, wait, let me go get me the let me go get the the background behind this so you could see and then you'll keep going back to get a background, but you got to start somewhere, right? So Job 32, excuse me, starting first verse, it says, "So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes." That's a very important part there that he was righteous in his own eyes. Then was kindled the wrath of Eliu, the son of Berkeel, the buzzite of the kindred of Ram. Against Job was his wrath kindled. Not because he was jealous but his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God. Job was spent his time justifying himself instead of uh uh glorifying God uh on on his behalf. So we know we all know the story of Job in in the beginning where it talks about how the Lord loved Job and he the Lord was bragging on Job, you know. So we know how the Lord felt about him, but it seems that Job didn't didn't uh give place to the Lord. So verse three says, "Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet uh and yet had condemned Job." You know, a lot of people will bring out the the problem problem, but they give no solution, right? It's easy to call out the problem, but it's not so easy to give good counsel to give a solution, you know? So they were just answering whatever came to their mind, whatever they felt like felt like answering. He says, "Now Eliu had waited till Job had spoken." He had waited till Job had spoken because they were elder than he see the respect of this this man Eliu. He says, uh, "When Eliu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. And Eliu the son of Jericho the abusite answered and said,"I am young and ye are very old. Wherefore I was afraid and dur not show you mine opinion." So it just goes to show the respect that this man had that he held his peace. He let the elders speak. But when he saw that there was no answer, that's when he was upset and that's when he started to speak and gave his opinion. He said, I I I said days should speak and multitude multitude of years should teach wisdom, but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. &gt;&gt; Great men are not always wise. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Great men are not always wise. Do they have lifelong experience? Uh uh have they had good experiences? You see somebody that's overcome uh uh uh they seem like a wise man, but they don't always have the answers. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's a that's a good place to start, but just keep in mind they don't always have the right wisdom. Right. So neither do the aged understand judgment. He's not putting them down. He's saying they don't always they're not always wise. So therefore I said, hearken to me. I also will show mine opinion. Behold, I waited for your words. I waited for your words. I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you searched out what to say. Yay, I attended unto you, and behold, there was none of you that convinced Job. Not one of you convinced Job or that answered his words, lest you should say, we have found out wisdom, God thrusteth him down, not man. God will do the thrusting down. You know, they might have been aged. This man Eliu showed respect. And in Proverbs 16:31, you don't have to turn there. It says, "The horey head is a crown of glory. &gt;&gt; If it be found in righteous in the way of righteousness." &gt;&gt; Amen. So not every age person has wisdom and understanding. But that he that is in righteous in in righteousness in the way of righteousness he has uh uh that man the the hory head means mean means the gray head and you can't see my gray. I I hide it very well. But the the hory head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. But like I said, the first one that you want to go to is somebody with experience. But just keep in mind, they don't always have the answer. That's why we have to look unto the unto the Lord for the answer. And one more spot real quick while you're standing. Job 42 starting in the first verse. And while you're while you're turning there, inspiration in the Hebrew lexicon means breath, wind, angry or vital breath, divine inspiration, intellect, a blast of breath, inspiration, soul and spirit. This is in the Hebrew lexicon. So Job chapter 42, it says, "Then Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou can't do everything." Excuse me. Yes. I know that thou can't do everything, and that no thought can be withholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that I understood not. Things too wonderful for me which I knew not. See, Job had a very sharp rebuke from the Lord. And uh now he's come to terms with it. Verse four, he says, "Here, I beseech thee, and I will speak, I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eyes seeth. Wherefore I abhore myself and repent and dust and ashes. Job is saying, I have seen the error of my ways and I bring myself to you with repentance. &gt;&gt; Because he spoke things that he didn't really understand. He had uh uh he had his emotions that were running wild and he was just speaking. He was speaking how he felt, not realizing who he was speaking to and the complaint uh to the complaint department. He didn't realize the effect that it was going to have. But it was so selfish upon himself. It was until he had to he had to come to this selfnowledge of his wrongs. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So what I'd like to speak on this morning is is uh inspiration. I have heard but now I see. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have heard but now I see. &gt;&gt; So seeing is also understanding. Understanding is seeing. You know when we read through the scripture where I I have come face to face with something that doesn't mean that I've that I've come face to face with the with the person but I've come face to face with the situation. I finally understood. I come to terms with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's look to the Lord in prayer. Blessed heavenly father, I just thank you so much for the privilege that we have to be here behind this sacred desk one more time amongst your people. What a wonderful people uh they are to to come and speak to. Oh father Lord, just come with worship in their hearts, worship and praise coming from their mouth, Lord God, and their hands raised, Lord. They just want to come and they want to have church this morning. They want to hear from your spirit, oh God. They want to hear from you. Father, I just pray that you would uh help me to get myself out of the way to let your spirit do the speaking through my lips. So, Father, I yield this vessel unto you that you would speak freely, oh God. Father, I just pray that it would be a blessing to the people that we would take your word, that we would hear your word and not just only hear it, but we would apply it into our lives. Not that not that it would just be something that sounds like a good philosophy, but Lord, that it's a way of life, that it would change our lives for the better, oh God, in a positive way. Father, we just ask that you would strengthen every believer here, God. those that are weak, we just pray that you would give them strength, that they would continue to walk in your gospel, that they would not uh uh forsake you, oh God, but they would forsake the very things of the world, that they would dedicate or rededicate themselves to your way and to your purpose and to your kingdom. Father, we just ask for your blessings to be upon this service. Bless brother Jesse for opening the pulpit for us to come and minister uh to your people one more time. Lord, we ask all these things in your precious name, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. And is anybody in a hurry this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hopefully, you got good sleep. I don't know if you've ever listened to Brother George Smith preach, but he he he carries a level with him and he puts it on the pulpit. If he sees somebody sleeping, he'll slap that level on the pulpit and it'll scare you. It scares those that are awake. But, like I said, I'd like to speak on inspiration. I have heard but now I see. So inspiration in the free dictionary the definition is this just trying to uh uh lay the foundation here so we can so we can uh just hit our feet uh on the ground running right so inspiration is the excitement of the mind and where's the greatest battle ever fought &gt;&gt; is in the mind right so the excitement of the mind or emotions to a high level of feeling or activity so there's something behind The excitement of the emotions, it drives you to do something, &gt;&gt; right? The condition of being so excited. Who's excited this morning? &gt;&gt; Then you must be inspired. &gt;&gt; What inspired you? It must have been the worship because you were being happy in the Lord this morning. Raising our hands and giving God praise. There must have been something exciting about it. Something exciting that the that the world doesn't see as being very exciting, right? Uh, a lot of people think that that all church is just so boring. Ah, they haven't been to Akran, Ohio before, but and I've and I've been to other places and it's just so great to see people worship and it's not always in the jumping and shouting. Don't let that fool you. It's not always in jumping and shouting because that could fool the very people within the room, &gt;&gt; right? So, some people jump and shout because they heard something that that would tickle their ears or make them it'll have a feelood on their spirit, right? So, then they jump and they shout or they might have been talking about something the night before and the minister comes and and he's talking right to it. Isn't that exciting? That excites people. That excites me as a minister. That excites brother Jesse as a minister. That's exciting because you know it's the Lord moving. You know the Lord is in the presence and in the presence of the Lord there's liberty and excitement. &gt;&gt; Right? There's a high level of emotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have a high level of emotion and express it quietly, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, but wait a second. It's it's all you got to shout. You got to jump. You got to run. But it the Lord wasn't in the earthquake. The Lord wasn't in the in the thunderings. The Lord wasn't in all the loud stuff, but what was it? A still small voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't want to be deceived by all that by that all that electric emotion uh uh uh uh being anointed on the spirit, but we want that Holy Spirit anointing on the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; the quality of being so excited as manifested in something, something is showing forth because you've been excited about something. you something has moved you. Amen. A person or thing that moves the intellect or emotions or prompts action or invention. &gt;&gt; Look at the light bulbs. Look at carpet. Look at the chairs. Look at everything in this room. Drywall, glass, whatever it is. Somebody was inspired to develop something. They they were inspired by something to create, to invent something. &gt;&gt; There was an inspiration. They saw a need. They were inspired to research, to develop, to create, to help uh make it a better place for uh uh men and women on the earth. Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So something such as a a a creative act or idea that is inspired. Now this that also is is a divine guidance or influence. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, inspiration is an influence. Absolutely. It is an influence &gt;&gt; divine guidance or influence exerted directly on a human mind. Oh &gt;&gt; here it is or soul &gt;&gt; a divine guidance or influence. We have the watchtowwer on the inside, right? The inside man is the watchtowwer. Whether you whether you have faith in God or whether you doubt God, it's the faith or doubt struggle within the soul, right? Within the inside man. &gt;&gt; So it's that watchtowwer that we want to influence it. What happens when you cast out a spirit? What do you need to do? You need to influence your body. You need to influence your spirit. You need to influence your soul with righteousness. You need to fill it with something good. or else what? That same spirit that was cast out will come back. &gt;&gt; And bring seven other worse than it. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to do something about it. When there's that change in your life, a change for the positive, &gt;&gt; there has to be something that comes behind it to reinforce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There has to be something there of righteousness because if not, the influence of the wicked one will surely rush in. and to take try to take you captivity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 it says all scripture is given by inspiration of God. We know that we understand that as being God breathed, right? How many's heard that term God breathed? So the the all scripture, &gt;&gt; we like that threeletter word, right? &gt;&gt; All scripture &gt;&gt; is given by inspiration of God. We we'll get there in a minute. Just remember that it says all scripture &gt;&gt; and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction. How many wants to be corrected? &gt;&gt; Look, Job is our example, right? The Lord bragged on him for being an upright man and he shued evil. He didn't like evil or kicked evil out. He didn't entertain it. &gt;&gt; But he still had to go through that correction, &gt;&gt; right? It shows what spirit's on the inside of us. And it's not a godly spirit when we uh re rebuke reproof. &gt;&gt; Try to say that a few times fast. Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So when you come against correction, see if you if if the Lord loves you, right, &gt;&gt; he's going to come and correct you. &gt;&gt; He's going to come and chastise you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're his son. You're his daughter. He doesn't want to see you go in the error of your ways. &gt;&gt; Because there's no error in his ways, &gt;&gt; right? He's trying to keep your foot less you dash your foot against a stone. let you let you misstep a foot &gt;&gt; and take a step in the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's there to guide you. He's there to comfort you. He's there to help you. &gt;&gt; He's there to strengthen you. &gt;&gt; He's there to inspire you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it it is profitable for doctrine, for reprove, for correction, for instruction and righteousness that any common man may be perfect. Oh, did anybody catch that? That's wrong, isn't it? You should come against me all now. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's rewind. It doesn't say that any common man. &gt;&gt; It says that the man of &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; that the man of God is not just for anybody, but the one that loves him, &gt;&gt; the one that loves the correction, the one that loves the rebuke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one that loves his loving kindness, for his mercies are made new every day. Right? That the man of God may be perfect through thoroughly thorly furnished unto all good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to mold you. He wants to change you into a way that he is pleased with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You are a masterpiece in his eyes. Amen. Because he's done a work for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been trying to think of a word and I and I can't think of it, but uh somebody help me out. That's uh begins with an R and it's the same as witchcraft. &gt;&gt; Rebellion is the same as witchcraft. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Devil get thee behind me. We're going to get through. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to rebel. That's the word that I was looking for. We don't want to rebel against his instruction, right? &gt;&gt; So, oh, I could go to another one. It's Psalms 119 and 140, but uh you don't have to turn there, but y'all can read it later. Psalms 119. There is so much in Psalms 119. If you don't know how to worship, let me direct you to Psalms. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; David knew how to worship. &gt;&gt; Let David be your inspiration. Amen. But second Peter chapter 1 verse 20 it says knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. The Methodists just don't have it. The Baptists just don't have it. Right? Knowing this verse that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. I'd go so far as to not every message person is a message believer that even the message doesn't have it. &gt;&gt; If if you understand what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because people try to make message a denomination. They use it as a label. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we don't know how what what else to do with it, right? &gt;&gt; But what is the message? The message is Jesus Christ. Turning the hearts back to the father. Right? &gt;&gt; Message is Jesus Christ. Message is not of any man save the man Jesus Christ. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could always always always always always point to Jesus Christ, we are doing well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad you all understand that because because usually I feel a resistance of of what I say then I have to explain it. So, I'm glad you understand what I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to to knock message by any by any means, right? So because I believe the message is Jesus Christ and if I keep that at the forefront I could understand and actually see what the message is because all scripture points to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it points to somebody else it's wrong. It's a wrong interpretation because then it becomes a private interpretation and then we know all the Joseph Smiths out there, &gt;&gt; right? all the all the other ones that all all the false Jesuses back in his day, &gt;&gt; you know, there were there were other people named Jesus than than the one that we call the Christ. &gt;&gt; There's many many with the name Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, oh my, we're getting into something good here. &gt;&gt; But remember what I'm speaking on this morning, inspiration, right? &gt;&gt; And remember second Timothy, what I told you to remember. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; So this is a quote that brother Brandham and this should be very familiar to a message believer. It reminds me of a lady in Chicago. Her boy went away to a seminary to learn to be a minister. Some Bible schoolers were in some seminary. And while he was away, the old mother took real seriously sick. And so they sent word for the boy to stand by. His mother was in such a high fever she had pneumonia and said that uh it might be an emergency call. So the boy packed his clothes and got ready, right? About sounds like the rapture. Getting your stuff in order. Getting your stuff packed. Of course, we're not going to pack any clothes because we can't take it with us, right? So he says, "Finally, the next day, he never heard no word through the night." And the next day said, "All is well." So about a year later he returned from the school in the east some great school of teaching and he came home and he greeted his precious mother and said uh after talking a while said mother I never did get the chance to ask you what happened. Said one night they told me to stand by and the next morning said you were well. Said what drug did the doctor use? &gt;&gt; What drug did the doctor use? &gt;&gt; She said honey the doctor didn't use nothing. He said well how did you do it? said, "You know where that little mission is down there at the square?" Says, "Yes." Said, "There was a lady that was having a prayer meeting down there one night and this little mission that that poor little humble bunch of people and said one of them was inspired. &gt;&gt; One of them was inspired to come up here and see me." And two women came and they asked me if if they could bring their pastor up and pray for me and anoint me with oil and lay their hands upon me that I'd be well. And said, you know, I told them, "Sure." And they brought the pastor up and he laid his hands on upon me and prayed and said, "Honey," he read it right out of the Bible. Remember all scripture. All scripture. He read it right out of the Bible. Mark the 16th chapter said, "These signs will follow them that believe." How many believes that? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many people have seen it? Amen. &gt;&gt; And said, "You know what? The next morning, the doctor was so puzzled, he didn't know what to do. There was no fever in me. &gt;&gt; There was no fever in me. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he said, "Mother, you didn't associate with that group, did you?" See, trying to have a private interpretation of the word, trying to hold it into one group, one sect of people, you Pharisee, &gt;&gt; instead of trying to share it with other people, you're trying to hold it to yourself, trying to say, "We're the only ones with the truth." That's very denominational thinking right there. is when you're saying that you're the only one that could be saved and no one else. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He said, "We in the school, we that are so highly educated, we that are that are so revelated above everybody else." Oh my, we in the school, we learned that Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is not even inspired. And she said, "Glory to God." God, I can imagine she could just jump and run and shout on that one. She says, "Glory to God." Says, "Way." He said, "Mother, you're beginning to act just like those people." &gt;&gt; She must have been in the atmosphere of somebody that was excited with inspiration. &gt;&gt; Somebody that had high emotions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She must have been in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She said, "Why?" He said, "Mother, you're beginning to act like those people. I would count it joy to act like those people that would glorify God because they saw something that happened. Being in the very presence of the God working when people say the days of miracles are passed. &gt;&gt; We've done seen it too many times. We've seen knees healed. We've seen hips healed. We've seen other things healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. She said, "You know, I was just thinking something." said, "I've been reading the Bible all the way through. Not just a portion here. Not just the thing that tickle my ears. Not just the things that that make me have a good philosophy to think about something. Not just a good quote for me to tell somebody when they're in despair, but I've been reading the Bible all the way through. &gt;&gt; Something struck this woman. There's something on the inside that she had to read the Bible. There's something that she had to get a hold of. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was something real. There was something true. &gt;&gt; And it defeated every falsicity that she came across. Amen. &gt;&gt; She was faced with death. &gt;&gt; You know, that's when that's that's about the time that a lot of people only seek the Lord &gt;&gt; is when they're on their deathbed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be so in the life of a believer, right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. She said, I was just thinking something. said, "I've been reading the Bible all the way through and other promises in other places, too, similar to that." &gt;&gt; Healing isn't the only promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I was just thinking, if God could heal me with the uninspired, what could he do with that which is really, really inspired?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he could give me the deliverance on something uninspired, &gt;&gt; what's going to hold a believer back? Amen. What's going to hold the mountain in your way back? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, if you're if you're in the Lord, you can find glory in just about anything you read. Amen. I'd go so far that you'd be able to find God in in Satan's Bible. &gt;&gt; Because when you have one, you've got to have the other. That's the law of contrast. You can't get away from it. If there's good, there's evil. If there's evil, there's got to be good. &gt;&gt; Because didn't the man say, "Whenever I do good, evil is present with me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, don't go saying, "Oh, Brother Brian's saying the Satan's Bible is a good book." I'm not saying that. But I'm saying when you see one, just know that the other one is near. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, whatever you talk about, that's what's going to be in your presence. If you start talking about demon spirits, you start talking about wickedness, you start talking about these things, those demons are going to come into your presence. &gt;&gt; You start talking about the Lord, you start talking about the angels, you start talking about the promises of God, guess who's going to show up? Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can find God in anything. Just like that little boy. He was searching. Have you seen God? Sunday school teacher, have you seen God? Well, nobody's seen God. Pastor, have you seen God? Nobody has seen God. &gt;&gt; Even the scripture says, "No man saw God face to face." Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because if you look upon them, they couldn't even touch the holy mountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Think of how holy God is. But coming to terms with the Lord, recognizing that who he is and putting him in his rightful place, giving his his him his rightful due, giving him his place of of of kingship, &gt;&gt; of redeemer, &gt;&gt; giving him his rightful place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you should be able to find God in anything. And then just a humble man that this young boy came across, have you seen God? I see God everywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all in what you're looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got another quote. We We like quotes. We could do quotes, right? &gt;&gt; So, okay. So, a young lady come from a country church. I know y'all like this one. If I like it, I know you like it. A young lady come from a country church and her father was an oldfashioned shouting preacher or a member of the church. And so she moved into the city and she got all mixed up with with the women down there and got acting like they did. See, birds of a feather feather flock together. &gt;&gt; You know, be careful who you keep company with. Make sure that you are the influence, not taking on an ungodly influence. Amen. &gt;&gt; When people start talking negative about the Lord, you just tell them how good God has been to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hate to contradict you. Actually, I love to contradict you, but that's not what I see with my God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Bring everything unto the obedience of the Lord. Amen. Let every man's word be a lie, but God's word be truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, she moved into the city and got and she got all mixed up with with the women down there and got to acting like they did and the fashions. And one day, she was she was kind of ashamed for her papa and mama and uh to come or her father rather. Her mother was dead. So the old man, only thing he'd do, get up of a morning, eat his breakfast, and get the Bible and read it and cry. You know what the world thinks about men like that? Oh, you &gt;&gt; Oh, but if you go back to Psalms, what do we learn that the Lord loves a broken and contrite spirit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would he would read it and cry and pray and shout all day long and run up and down the room and she was a little embarrassed about it. So then when all the time through the night if he got a hold of the Bible started reading it, he'd raise up out of the bed and holler, "Glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God." Just stomp and cry half the night because this is a man who knew what the Lord had done for him. &gt;&gt; This this man had an understanding of where his place was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he had a reason to shout. Why? Because his name was written on the book of heaven. Why? Because he found himself in the scripture. Why? Because there was something that when he read it, it excited him. It gave him inspiration. &gt;&gt; It didn't tell him that he was a crow and he didn't belong. It told him he was an eagle and he was going to fly higher than his his his symptoms and his trials and his tribulations. It told him it was going to take him higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, one day she was going to entertain her church members to a little tea party like they always have, you know. I don't know if they have them so much anymore. I guess they just I I guess the women folk just gather at the bars anymore. So, she didn't know what she was going to do with her dad. After all, it was her daddy. So, she decided she put him up in the attic and say, "Daddy, you don't want to be around where these women are, do you?" He says, "No, I don't believe I want to do that." You know, who wants to sit around and hear negativity and people gossiping about one another? You know, who wants to sit there in a conversation like that? You know, that should be in a believer. That should be so sickening to your spirit that you can't stand being in that. That you would intervene like Eliu that he would that you would intervene. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wait to turn. Those that are young, wait to turn and then you can then you could come with the truth. Eliu got upset because he was tired of hearing what he heard. Oh, just blabber this, blabber that, blabber this. You did this, you did that, you did this, you did that. You're you're a secret sinner &gt;&gt; is what they were trying to tell Job. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Eliu got sick of that. &gt;&gt; And so should we if we're ever in that atmosphere, we should get We should Oh, brother dear, sister, dear. We shouldn't speak ill about one another. We should say nice things about one another. &gt;&gt; And put the challenge forth. Can you say something nice and not something like I like your hair? That's an inside That's an inside story. Maybe we'll tell you someday. But genuinely say something nice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not saying something nice just to appease. You know, that's gains. &gt;&gt; So he says, "No, I don't believe I want to do that." He said, "Well, we're going to have the church women up here today and we're going to have a little meeting, a little prayer meeting." So, I tell you, Dad, why don't you just go up in the attic? Said, "I just believe I'll do that." Is that what they do now? Cloak a gossip session with a prayer as as a prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be careful. Oh, I saw brother so and so do this. Keep him in prayer. You know, I don't think he should be doing this and then just laying everything out there. Why can't you just keep it general? You &gt;&gt; know, you see a brother in a fault, you go to Matthew 18, go to him and him alone, right? &gt;&gt; Not blasting it before everybody. And then when you go to him alone, he doesn't hear you. Then you get two or three, right? Because a witness of two or three, let every word be established. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then if they don't hear you, then you bring it to the church. You don't sit in a group and call it a prayer meeting blasting your brother or sister. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sorry. This this story made me go there, I guess. So he says, "I I just believe I'll do that." So she said, "Here, read this nice book." And she gave him a geography book, took his Bible away from him. And you know, that's what people are trying to do so much in this day. And it started years ago, decades ago, taking prayer and Bibles out of the schools, right? And you see it so much. They're still trying to take Bibles away. They're still trying to take the word away from the believer. See, he took his Bible away from him so he'd keep quiet. And that's what people want to do is they want to they want to silence the Christian. Why? Because they don't want to hear the truth. They don't want to hear about their sin because they love to entertain those demons that are upon them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She knew if he read the Bible, why he would go to making a lot of noise up there. So, he's right up over them, you know, where they was having a party. So, she gave him the geography book said, "This is nice. You should read it, daddy, because it tells you all the truth about the world. Oh, he said, "I'll be glad to read that." So, she said, "Now you go up there and keep real quiet till these women leave and then you can come back down and then you can do whatever you want to." Oh, this this woman ought to be ashamed of herself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He agreed to it. So, he goes upstairs, sits up there, and they was all having their tea party, you know, talking about so- and so, and you know how it goes, having all that big time. And about that time, something cut loose upstairs. All the screaming and jumping and the plaster falling. He was tearing down the house with excitement. Amen. The old man running up and down. David, if you want to get the plaster off your wall, just have a jubilee in your house. Amen. The old man running up and down through the attic just as hard as he could go, jumping down, jumping up and down and hollering, "Glory to God. Glory to God." The women didn't know what happened up there, what they what they what he had upstairs. So directly down the steps he come as hard as he could go. She said, "Daddy, I gave you a geography book. I gave you a book that was supposed to be boring, uninspiring, right?" &gt;&gt; Said, "Yes, I know it." You know, said, "I was reading in this geography book here where there's a place in the sea that ain't got no bottom to it." Oh my. And he said, "I read over here in the Bible yesterday." He said, "Put my sins in the sea of forgiveness." Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. said, "They're still going. They're still going with whatever machinery they got. They can go further than what they ever have before, and they still can't get to the bottom." Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the pressure becomes too much. They can't handle the pressure. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when somebody tries to keep your sins on you, you just take them up higher because they can't handle the pressure. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; An eagle is a special built bird that's able to withstand the pressure. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm getting excited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says they're still going. They don't have an end and they just keep on going. That's right, brother. Sister, if you don't know why I'm excited, then you haven't tasted and seen what I've tasted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right." And he was shouting about it. Well, that's about right. God puts our sins in the sea of forgetfulness. Blasts them out. &gt;&gt; Who could lay any charge to God's elect? Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blast them out and then they're there as if they've if they never happened. Oh my. Then we stand by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Pure and holy just as holy as he was. &gt;&gt; Do we understand that statement? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we not understand what Jesus said? Be ye holy for I am holy. If we could if we could come to that same uh condition, &gt;&gt; he said that he is holy. Well, he is so holy. I can't become holy. We can't become holy all by ourselves. Now, see, we can't do anything because Jesus even said it. Without me, you can do nothing. &gt;&gt; But when we take on his spirit, Amen. &gt;&gt; then we could become holy like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We sing those songs. I I raise up holy hands. My hands aren't holy, but when I They weren't holy before, but now I'm in Christ. Now I can lift up holy hands because I've been cleansed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I've been cleansed by the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Usually I'm about wanting to fall on the floor by now, but just as holy as he was because he doesn't see me. He doesn't see me when I come up there. He sees his own son. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way he can't see me because I'm in his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he only sees his son. Isn't that wonderful? We don't have to think about sins anymore. It's all gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's under the blood. Yes, sir. Don't have to worry about it no more. It's all out of God's memory. He don't even remember it no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, see, God, &gt;&gt; like I said, people are always trying to take the word out of out of the hands of a believer. But, you know, the scripture tells us that before we were not a people of God, but now, but now we are a people. And he said that I will write my laws into into their minds and it will write it into our hearts. Amen. See, that might make it might them taking the word away for a little bit might make a believer stumble a little bit, but there's spiritual food put up in the storehouse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be in this Bible, read and pray every day. So, because we're storing up spiritual food in due season, in the time of a famine when it comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, what do you mean there isn't going to be a famine coming? I'm talking about a spiritual famine. What are you going to do when they start closing up churches? Amen. You're going to be like they did in the days of old. You're going to be looking for a house. You're going to be looking for a place to worship. And in that time, what are you going to have? &gt;&gt; So, we have to have his word written upon our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because what happens when when the book form is gone? I don't I can't say if that's going to happen, but what if somebody takes your Bible away? And you know, brother, I heard this, brother Brad heard me say this already recently. I heard this older minister say uh uh he was being interviewed that uh what what an older I think it was Riyle or I can't remember his name, but RC Ral, is that a name that sounds familiar? JC Ral RC Sproul maybe. I I don't know. I can't remember what it is, but I just remember the interview uh the the man said, "What would you say to the younger you?" And he was saying, "Well, one, I wouldn't go to the seminary." I thought that was pretty profound of him to say, but he's actually uh uh recommending not to go to seminary. So, there must be something about seminary that ruins people's ministry. Amen. It takes the inspiration out of people. &gt;&gt; So, and then he says, "Read your Bible and pray every day." Sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is a this is a denominational minister. Okay. &gt;&gt; Is is is that okay to say here? &gt;&gt; But this is the advice of an older minister. He's saying don't go to seminary. Read your Bible and pray every day. And then he says uh he he talks about ministers uh that they only read the scripture when they want to get a sermon together. I hope that's not the condition that that we as believers are in. &gt;&gt; We only read the Bible once in a while because somebody came to us and said, "Oh, I need your help. What do you think about this?" Well, let me go to the scripture and let me see what it says about it. Now, see, we should be so much into the scripture that we should know how to answer every man &gt;&gt; according as to what we've received and what our experience. Right? So, we should be so well-versed. That's another thing he says, know your Bible. &gt;&gt; Of how important that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just kind of throw that in there. I I thought that was pretty pretty profound with that with that older denominational minister advised people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what he would tell the younger him coming up into ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. It about sounds like we what we would advise, right, brother? &gt;&gt; So So now see, Job didn't have a Bible to go to. Abraham didn't have a Bible to go to. Moses didn't have a Bible to go to. These people in the Old Testament, they didn't really have a Bible like you and I have. &gt;&gt; They were making the Bible. &gt;&gt; They were living their experience that we could have a Bible. &gt;&gt; They had to go by what? inspiration. &gt;&gt; They had to go by what the spirit told them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the Bible as a prophet. It isn't man's words, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's God breathed. &gt;&gt; A prophet spoke what the Lord put on his heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Huh? Bam. They tried to get Balum to say something contrary, but he couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a prophet. He had to say what the Lord said. &gt;&gt; He couldn't say anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a magnificent story in itself. That should tell you that the spirit is true. &gt;&gt; Even when you're influenced by an evil one, there's something greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he couldn't speak but what the Lord what the what the Lord put in his mouth. Amen. Now, see, in order to follow something, okay, in order to follow something, stay with me for a second, in order to follow something, it has to catch your interest. &gt;&gt; It has to be able to catch your attention and turn your eyes like a burning bush that wasn't being consumed. In order to follow something, there has to be an interest in that something &gt;&gt; or else you won't desire that something. Right. &gt;&gt; Right now, in order to follow someone, in order to follow someone, you must be inspired by something that's in them. &gt;&gt; Or else, why would you want to follow them? &gt;&gt; If you are following someone, there must be an inspiration inside of you that wants to follow them. There's an interest on the inside that says, "I like being around this person. I want to hang around with this person. I want to be like this person. I want to do what this person does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So there must be something in that in you that likes that person. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. You you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so uh some people are inspired to do wicked works. &gt;&gt; Some people that have that interest, there's something on the inside that they want to do the wicked works, too. Oh, but there's a law of contrast. Well, maybe we should maybe we should have preached on that this morning. But where there's good, there's evil. Where there's evil, there's there's bound to be a good to to prevail against it. &gt;&gt; So other people are prone to do good deeds because they are inspired by someone else. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the scripture teaches us, "No wonder it says, "Provoke one another unto love and to good works." &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do good. &gt;&gt; I remember years ago when I watched TV, there was a commercial on that uh there was one person who did something nice and somebody caught it. So that inspired them to in turn do something nice to somebody else and somebody else caught that. that inspired that person to do something kind for somebody else. And and it was a whole chain reaction because one person saw somebody do something good, it inspired someone else to do something good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, we provoke unto love and unto good works. Be careful who you hang around with. Be careful who you like because those that you like, there's something on the inside of you that has an interest of that person that you're inspired by. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; It's not real complicated. I probably just put it in a complicated way. &gt;&gt; So, knowing that in order to follow his word, there must have been something on the inside to inspire you to do so, &gt;&gt; in order to be able to receive the word, there must be something on the inside to say that is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; There has to be something there. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There has to be something there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because how is the sunlight supposed to strike that seed? &gt;&gt; When that sunlight strikes the seed, whether it's a seed of evil or it's a seed of righteousness, whenever the light strikes it, it's going to bloom to whatever it is. &gt;&gt; You won't know what the seed is until you see the fruit of it. Right. That went in my notes, but but we'll go with it. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't want to lie. Part of that it it just I just kept going further. But there has to be something on the inside for you to be able to receive truth. Even Pilate himself said in Jesus' presence with truth right there with him, "What is truth?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's a philosopher's lifelong question. What is truth? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What do we know the truth to be? What did Jesus say? I am the truth, the life, and the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It become it's so simple to those that are able to see it. &gt;&gt; But it's a mystery to those that can't. &gt;&gt; Why? because they don't have that on the inside. All scripture is God breathed. It's good for reproof. It's good for correction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For whom? To make the man of God perfect. &gt;&gt; Because the world, they don't want it. There's nothing in them to desire it. &gt;&gt; Even if they know the truth, there's nothing on the inside. If they read the scripture and they say, "Well," and and some of these people know the Bible probably better than what we do and they could quote scriptures and they could they could defeat you. They could, you know, they could whip you with the with all the scriptures that they could quote. But there's nothing on the inside. &gt;&gt; Just because you know the scripture doesn't mean that you believe the scripture doesn't mean that you live the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. See, we don't do things for nothing, right? We don't do it for nothing. If if you smoke cigarettes and there is something in there to to make you want to smoke cigarettes. If you drink alcohol, there's something in on the inside that wants to drink the alcohol. There has to be something on the inside. If you're craving something, if you're wanting a Mountain Dew, there's something on the inside that you need or that you want &gt;&gt; that you want a Mountain Dew. &gt;&gt; If you want to try chewing tobacco, there's something on the inside of you that wants to try chewing tobacco. Oh, bear with me. We doing okay, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; The same with putting on makeup or ungodly clothing. There's something on the inside. If you want to go to a dance, there's something on the inside that makes you want to dance. If you want to go to a barroom, there's something on the inside that has a desire to go there. &gt;&gt; If you want to come to church, &gt;&gt; there's a desire on the inside that wants you that wants to go there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But wait, you all of a sudden feel that you want to go here, but a part of you wants to go to church. And then it becomes a battle. I want part of me wants to go here. Part of me wants to go here. Part of me wants to go here. What do I do? I want to go here. But something tells me I want to go there. I go over here. Ah, there's something. It's a struggle &gt;&gt; to wherever you do good or the uh whenever you want to do good, evil is present, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you do the things that you don't want to do, &gt;&gt; right? That's a struggle against the spirit in the flesh. There's something pulling you to one way and there's something else. I thank God there's something holding me. &gt;&gt; Then when I want to go here, something overcomes that and says may and the the greater desire is what I serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I love the Lord more than the world. &gt;&gt; So, what am I going to choose? &gt;&gt; That almost seems like an easy easy question, easy decision to make for a believer. But what about a new convert? &gt;&gt; Somebody that's not rooted and grounded. &gt;&gt; That struggle is real. That struggle is hard. &gt;&gt; And then we think to ourselves, why can't you make that decision? I mean, why would you do that? Okay, let's go there. How many Don't raise your hand because I don't want to embarrass you. Just think about it in your heart. How many have done something that you knew was not right and you did it anyways, &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; But then we want to look upon Job and condemn him for his wrongs. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to be the seasoned ones that make an easier decision to go to those to the things that are right. But we don't always do it do that, do we? Our struggle isn't as great as a new convert. Right? I don't know if that's a fair thing to say. Maybe I shouldn't have put it that way, but I think you understand what I'm trying to say &gt;&gt; is that it's like it it's harder for a new convert to make those kind of decisions. That's why we have to admonish and nurture them, right? &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be a mentor. That's why we need to provoke unto love and to good works, showing them, inspiring them, teaching them, helping them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whether it's a billboard or magazine or some YouTube video with some ungodly men or women or someone you hang around, there's something that comes within our atmosphere, our presence. I'm not talking about the ozone. There's something that within our our our atmosphere that inspires us to do what we do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So whatever company you keep, that's what's on the inside that you want to keep. Amen. Huh? What makes a person scream at a sporting event? Maybe it's their favorite athlete. I don't know. Somebody just hit a home run. Man, I can't hit a ball that far. Man, that guy is so good. What makes a person scream at a sporting event? What makes a person scream at a at a tractor pool? I tell you, I just told this story. I think it was yesterday. I went to our county fair. This was a few years ago. And okay, I'll go to a tractor pull. I've never been to a tractor pool. And I'm just, okay, I'm here at a tractor pool, you know. And then all of a sudden, uh, if you do the background, I used to really like hot rods. And, uh, sitting there and the first tractor, I think it was it was a semi, I think. I can't remember what it was, but it was that first engine revving up and then, man, it just, man, that sounds so good. And then the next one and then the next one. And then you see this one just who and then all of a sudden who what made me scream. It was something in the atmosphere that got me excited. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lie. I like the sound of a high revan engine. I guess you know if it's done in the right way. I like a hot rod, you know. And uh and and that's a that's a young man's weakness right there. I'm still young, but that's a young man's weakness. So, what would make somebody that's in the tractors and I've never seen a semi-pool like this. I' I've never seen a a semi-pool wheelie, man. If you've ever seen that, oh my goodness, that that's quite the, you know, in a controlled environment. I don't want to see that on the highway. But it was it was pretty neat seeing a semi-pool wheel. What in the world? But that's uh it might have been a semi. It could have been those tractors were popping out wheels. That's all I remember. But truck pulls, you know, these these different events. What makes a person scream and shout? It's something in the atmosphere. Some It's the excitement that's in the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; right? And you find you're not the only one who's doing it. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people losing their minds. &gt;&gt; What about a worship service? &gt;&gt; Yep. You can better believe I'm Brother Brian's here. We're going to head home again. &gt;&gt; What about a worship service? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why do I do that, you ask? Because I got to bring it to that level. I've got to bring it to where you're living, right? &gt;&gt; I have to. &gt;&gt; Something inside of me compels it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what kind of a minister would we be if we didn't bring it to where where you live? &gt;&gt; To where you are, right? So in a worship service, what makes a person scream and shout? &gt;&gt; What makes a person get up and dance and run? Something if some Oh goodness, my golly. If you've never seen a person struggling and they receive deliverance, &gt;&gt; if you don't know why they're running and shouting, then you just don't know. &gt;&gt; But if you have that understanding, &gt;&gt; you see them get deliverance and they just take off running, you can understand why. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then who's the next person screaming? Whoa. Go on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're cheering them on. &gt;&gt; Weep with them that weep, but rejoice with them that rejoice. Amen, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; We should be excited to see somebody get deliverance, especially a young one that's been struggling for so long. And when they jump up and down, I'm free. I'm free. There's something inside of them that's making them scream and shout because they struggled for so long. They finally got deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, you just don't know. &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, just keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Why do you say amen? Why do you raise your hands? I know I'm getting close to you. I hope I don't spit on you. But what makes a person say amen? &gt;&gt; You can agree with the word. There's something truth that struck your heart that says you can't help but say &gt;&gt; amen. I can relate to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's something relatable. &gt;&gt; There's a relationship there. &gt;&gt; You can see it where other people they search their their whole lives the the meaning of certain things of scripture. But blessed are your eyes &gt;&gt; that you could see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed are your eyes. &gt;&gt; And how dare we get proud just Oh, I could see the scripture. How come you how how come you can't you stuff shirt, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my say I don't believe in making people say amen. You know there's people say say amen. Say amen. Somebody say amen. I might say somebody praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if there's something in you that wants to say praise the Lord, then you're going to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If there's not, you're going to probably keep quiet, right? &gt;&gt; What am I going to say praise the Lord for? You haven't done anything for me. Oh, you just don't know yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I don't believe in forcing people to say amen. You know, because if you don't know what you're saying amen to, you should get quiet, right? Because what? Like that scripture that I read that any common man would be made perfect. You don't want to amen that because it's not true. &gt;&gt; Right? You see where I'm You see where I'm coming from? Be careful what you're &gt;&gt; amening. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I understand that we need to pause a second. Okay. He said this. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. He said this. Is that true? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say anything. &gt;&gt; I want to talk to this fell after service. &gt;&gt; I don't think that was quite right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, that's why I don't I don't believe in forcing people to say amen. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; amen is a powerful powerful statement. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; So be it. &gt;&gt; Let it be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, &gt;&gt; oh my. But what makes us do these things? It's something that strikes the spirit on the inside. &gt;&gt; You're involved in the spirit of the element. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're at a tractor pull, you're in the spirit of the tractor pull, &gt;&gt; right? There's a spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're in a truck pool, there's a spirit behind it. You're at a pep rally, right? &gt;&gt; That's what they're doing is they're they're pinging you up. They're building you up. They're trying to get you in the spirit of the thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Remember that before football games, &gt;&gt; they would pump you up and pump you up and pump you up and and they would pump the audience up. You know, your classmates, they pump everybody up. Remember the wave? Woo! And everybody's getting all pumped up, getting rallied up. &gt;&gt; That's why we should read our Bible and pray before we get to church because we're getting pumped up. Amen. We shouldn't have to let the song leader get us pumped up. &gt;&gt; We should already be in that atmosphere. We should be bringing that atmosphere with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it's called the spirit of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But like that song that we sang, blessed assurance, how is it that we could sing blessed assurance? Because it's my story. This is my story. This is my song. This is my experience. This is my testimony that I've got to tell us and share with somebody else. I don't know what kind of time we got. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You could share that something has happened to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just not a small thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me tell I know you've heard my testimony. But cigarettes, the Lord taking the whole desire of smoking cigarettes. Let me tell you something, that was not a small thing &gt;&gt; to me. That was that was a miracle for me. &gt;&gt; Because I had struggled so hard with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; There's something about being in his presence, &gt;&gt; being where his spirit is. Amen. Oh my. What makes a minister preach what you have need of? And he has no idea what you have need of. &gt;&gt; What made Elijah speak the things? What What did he hear behind closed doors that that spoke what the king was about ready to do? &gt;&gt; Spoke the very secrets of what the king was going to do that it drove the king crazy and saying, "Who's spilling the beans?" &gt;&gt; What gives that person that? It's the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What makes you give your a person your last $20? &gt;&gt; What makes you give the a person in need the very the the shirt off your back? &gt;&gt; What makes you give a a word of encouragement when you have no idea what the person needs? &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the Lord. It's the inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could say, "Oh my, I have heard, but now I see." Because we know the scripture teaches that those that have eyes to see can't see. Those that have ears to hear can't hear. But blessed are your eyes that you could see. Blessed are your ears that you can hear. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, I have heard. I have heard the word, but now I see. Now I understand. Now I have the revelation. What is a revelation? Faith is a revelation. Revelation is an inspiration of the truth. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What makes us want to come to church? It's that spirit on the inside that drives us because we love him. We love his statutes. We love his laws. We love his grace. We love his mercy. We love to give him praise. We love to give him honor. We love to give him his place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he not reigning king in your life? Is he not reigning capital L O R D in your life? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we give our Lord, we give our King, our master, our God, his place, his rightful worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever we go, we're we're surrounded by spirits. There are some there are spirits that that uh uh uh what makes us want to throw our hands in the air? There's a spirit on the inside that just wants to wants to throw your hand up in the air and give him praise, right? But there are spirits all around us and they're trying to influence us in any direction that they can and that direction is away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; They try to get you to doubt, but there are other spirits. There are angelic spirits. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're trying to help you keep your faith. They get you there are some spirits that try to get you to criticize. There are other angelic spirits trying to get you to inspire grace. &gt;&gt; There's some spirits that try to get you to be prideful and thinking that you're better than someone else. But all the law of contrast, there's another spirit that that's there to try to inspire you to be humble. &gt;&gt; There are spirits that try to get you to gossip about the preacher. There are other spirits that try to get you to say something nice about the preacher. They try to get you to be greedy. There are other spirits that try to get you to be content. These are just some of the pools that we're dealing with this in this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's spirit influences everywhere you go. &gt;&gt; And we need to end. We're entertaining angels unaware. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But I am so glad there's something that is holding me. Amen. And it's keeping me in truth. When I'm in doubt, he is there. When I feel shame, he is there. When I feel like I lost faith, he restores. Amen. When I am afraid, he gives me courage. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was something that struck c the curiosity of Nicodemus one day. Why else would he come by night? Because he was too ashamed. &gt;&gt; Like that man's daughter was too ashamed to have her papa around &gt;&gt; because he'd be screaming and shouting, but he was ashamed to come to Jesus by day. So Nicodemus came to him by night and he had that that curiosity was just poking at him and he wanted to understand that mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. of being born again. &gt;&gt; How can I be born again? How could I be put back into my mother's womb to be born again? That's not what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; But taking on a change, letting this word take hold in your life, &gt;&gt; to let there be a change &gt;&gt; to recognize truth and to embrace it into our bosoms. Let the word, let the Lord's word be written on your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't resist the very spirit that would set you free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. But there was something on the inside of Nicodemus. There was a yearning. There was a thirst that was on the inside of him that he had to have some kind of a closure with an understanding of what the Lord meant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was something about Jesus when he spoke. There was something in his speech. It was full of grace but yet with the authority because they were baffled about this man because there was this man that never spoke like this man. &gt;&gt; There was something about this man that spoke uh boldness but yet it was gentle. &gt;&gt; It was with grace. It was instruction. &gt;&gt; But don't let that fool you because when wrath needs to come, wrath will come. that day when they were in the temple and those money changers when they're performing the evil. Oh, that struck the righteous indignation of our Lord. &gt;&gt; How dare you bring evil into the temple? &gt;&gt; Oh my. And that's how we should be. How dare you bring this that evil to this temple? For know you not that you are the temple of the Holy Ghost? How dare you bring that evil, vile, wicked stuff to this temple? Let the righteous ignation kick it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let it reside there. &gt;&gt; You know what's right and wrong. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and ponder, should I go this way of of of adversity, this way of of wickedness, or should I go this way of righteousness. You know the way. You know the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know which way is the way of prosperity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking monetary stuff. I'm not talking about worldly treasures, but you know the way of prosperity, of salvation. You know the way of prosperity, of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We doing okay. &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus asked his disciples one day, "Whom do men say that I am?" &gt;&gt; Well, some say that you're Elijah. Some say that you're John the Baptist. Some say that you're Jeremiah. But what did the Lord say? I don't care what those other ones are saying. That's not a quote. But he's he doesn't care what the other people were saying. &gt;&gt; He didn't want their influence based on what other people were saying. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "But who do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; How do you see me? And Peter struck with inspiration said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to be inspired for those words to come out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; Because you can't say that Jesus is the Christ but by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to be inspired to utter those words. And Jesus told him flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you. &gt;&gt; Men's philosophy didn't reveal that. &gt;&gt; Aristotle, all these Greek philosophers, philosophers, sorry, I was trying to think of another one. That's what happens when you're thinking and talking at the same time. But all these Greek philosophers, they didn't have it. &gt;&gt; They didn't reveal it. &gt;&gt; The humble man in the hut with the beard yay long, he didn't reveal it. &gt;&gt; Anome didn't reveal it. &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Flesh and blood didn't reveal it, but the father which is in heaven &gt;&gt; gave you that understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Could you now see we get so caught up in in these things that we don't even understand that the spirit spoke &gt;&gt; that the father spoke to me. &gt;&gt; Now to me in my mind if I was Peter and the Lord told me that in my mind I'm thinking glory to God. Hallelujah. The father spoke to me. Do you not realize how blessed you are to hear the spirit of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We just don't know what our position is. &gt;&gt; How blessed of a people we are. &gt;&gt; To be in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we take that for granted. &gt;&gt; Was I in the Lord's presence or not? Oh, people were jumping and shouting. We had to have been in the Lord's presence possibly. &gt;&gt; What was the fruit &gt;&gt; of it? &gt;&gt; That's where it's at. &gt;&gt; What happened in the service? &gt;&gt; Were people jumping and shouting because they heard some nice words? The the minister was getting fired up and it fired them up. Or was there something that really took place? Did it change the way of somebody's thinking? &gt;&gt; Was somebody delivered &gt;&gt; from fear? Was somebody delivered from anxiety? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's worthy of praise. That's worthy of glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's worthy of g shouting a hallelujah to our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But you know, that was so nice to be able to hear that Peter heard that flesh and blood didn't reveal that, but the father spoke to you himself. Just a few lines down. See, you got to be careful which spirit we're of because Jesus came by and he was speaking the things that he was going to have to suffer. And Peter came along. The same one that said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Came by, spoke with the father who laid on his heart, came by and said, "That's not so, Jesus." Oh, no. We don't We can't have that happen to you. As much as he spoke glorious thing, here in the next few moments, he spoke something that he was rebuked of. And Jesus called it out and said, "Satan, I rebuked you &gt;&gt; because you desire the things of man and not the things of God." &gt;&gt; So Peter had the influence of the Holy Spirit one time and then he had the influence of Satan and just a few moments later. &gt;&gt; Oh my. See how the spirits work? &gt;&gt; When you have one, there's the other. &gt;&gt; Be careful what spirit you're entertaining. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh my. I feel good. I don't know about you all. &gt;&gt; You might be getting weary, but I kind of feel like I'm just getting started. No, actually, I feel like I'm waning. I'm past 25 the second time. I'm twice this young man's age. So, he should have twice as much as I got. It's It's not what man has. It's the measure of what the Lord puts into the man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we try to shut things down if we if it doesn't come just quite to our understanding. Right. Well, we enjoyed that service, but I think it should have gone I think it would have gone better if it would have done this and this and this. And then what are you sitting What are you sitting at? You're sitting in the seat of the scornful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're you're bringing man's understanding into it. Well, I think it should have been this. I think it should have been that. I don't think this should have happened. I don't think that should have happened. &gt;&gt; Well, whatever happened happened. Okay? You can't go back and change it, &gt;&gt; right? If something bad happened, you be cautious for the next time, &gt;&gt; right? You repent and then you go on. If you find that you did something wrong, we should be humble enough. Oh, &gt;&gt; is that a bad word? &gt;&gt; We should be humble enough. &gt;&gt; It's hard for some people, but we should be humble enough to say, "I did wrong." &gt;&gt; That's what happened with Job. &gt;&gt; I spoke all this and I didn't have the understanding of why things were happening. I heard and now I see. Now I understand. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for speaking the things that I spoke. See, Job was able to humble himself and say that I did wrong. &gt;&gt; How hard that is even for some seasoned message believers. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It's hard. It's hard. See, we shouldn't say it should be this in the period, but it should be this and whatever the Lord shall desire to add to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever blessings he's willing to add to it, I want to be willing to receive whatever blessings he has. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we start putting the the w the fire out. We start bringing the the wet blanket out. when we start into these scornful thoughts. Now, if something blatantly is wrong, you know, yeah, pray about it. That's that's probably first and foremost, pray about it. &gt;&gt; And then find the area to rebuke that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think you I think you're well taught here. I think you I think it would be uh I think you would have the understanding of of what to do. Right. So the disciples had had a a zeal for the Lord. And I I I know I've got more. I'm probably just page. Yeah, I've got a lot more. So I don't I I probably won't go through everything. I'll just start trying to sum summarize everything. &gt;&gt; But the disciples had uh uh they they had a zeal sometimes to where they were overzealous. Right? There's a there's a time that we could be overzealous &gt;&gt; to where it becomes that we don't recognize what spirit that we have on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why I say you need to be cautious about what you do in in a in a h in a service, right? Be careful what you speak out against because it might very well be the Lord moving in that service, right? So the disciples were were rebuked for for No, they weren't rebuked. They were rebuking other this is a story that I'm thinking of, but they were rebuking other people for casting out devils. And they came to they came to Jesus and they said, "Hey, we saw some casting casting out devils in your name. We saw some casting out devils, but we rebuked them. We told them how they're they're not with they're not with the bride of Christ, Ohio." &gt;&gt; So they they can't they they can't cast out devils like we cast out devils. But we have the proprietary assignment for that, though. We are the only ones that could do that. Oh, what's the name of our church? Church. It's Oh, it's the church of of Jesus Christ in God. Oh, we're the only ones that can do it. I see, brother. I told you I get those moments a lot. But we'll overcome. So, they were trying to say that we have this that's a proprietary that we got the patent on that thing. How dare they? &gt;&gt; But Jesus came by and said, "Oh, no. You leave them alone. For those that are for us, they're not against us. &gt;&gt; You just go ahead and leave them alone. &gt;&gt; They're doing a work that I told them to do. He didn't say that, but I I could just see that because they have to be inspired, right? They have to be inspired by his spirit to be able to do that. Now, be careful you go on your own because those spirits might say, "Now, Paul, I know. Jesus, I know. Jesse Smith. I know. Jim Schumank, I know. &gt;&gt; Brother So and So, I know, but who are you? &gt;&gt; You try to come and take care of it yourself uninspired. &gt;&gt; You're going to fail at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they were rebuked by that. They rebuked other people, but Jesus came and rebuked that man. Now see the disciples tried to uh uh they they came because Jesus had his face set to where he was going to go somewhere else to another city. I can't remember where he was but but into this particular story you know his his face was set to go to another city and the people of that city were kind of upset because it seems like well it doesn't seem like he's he's interested in us. So they were getting angry. So the disciples were getting angry at them for getting angry. Be angry and sin not. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But their anger was so kindled they even asked Jesus, "Jesus, shall we not shall we cast? Shall we call down fire from heaven?" And Jesus says, "You don't even know what spirit you're of. You don't even realize what you're asking." &gt;&gt; Because what they were doing was the same thing what Elijah did or what they were they were thinking that they were going to do the same thing as Elijah did. But those men were coming up against a prophet. So he had to that was his defense, right? So they were wanting to do the same works as what Elijah did, not realizing what spirit they had upon them &gt;&gt; just because they were upset. Now see, there's a righteous indignation that you can go on and still still be good and be righteous about it. &gt;&gt; But there's a there's a sin of the indignation because it says be angry and sin not. You could be in uh you could have that indignation and then you can misstep and do something wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the influence, the inspiration being filled uh with another Satan filled Judas to betray Jesus. Saul had to receive inspiration to turn from the things Saul uh formerly Paul. He had to receive inspiration, right? Uh to turn from the things that he was doing. He thought he was doing a work for God when he was coming against the Christians. He thought he was doing a a a good work because he thought that they were heretics, &gt;&gt; but he had to have a change one day. &gt;&gt; He had to receive the the inspiration of the Holy Spirit one day. &gt;&gt; And it changed his thinking. It changed his mind. It changed on how he viewed things. &gt;&gt; He heard and then he understood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Ananas and Safar, let Satan fill their heart to lie to the Holy Ghost. Even Peter said, "Ananas, why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back a part of the price of the land?" King Agria felt so inspired, but he let it fizzle in the statement that he that it sounded good to him that he says, "Paul, you almost persuade me to be a Christian, but he couldn't go any further with it." &gt;&gt; The inspiration struck. You almost persuaded me, &gt;&gt; but he couldn't take that extra step. Why? Because it wasn't in him. Right? &gt;&gt; The sermon on the mount, Peter wanted to build three tabernacles. One for Jesus, one for Moses, one for Elijah, not knowing what he said. Why? It was an inspiration that struck him. Right? Rahab mentioned that the people of Jericho heard how the Jews God was with them. Right? They heard how they triumphed in their situations and the people of Jericho feared them because they knew what their God was capable of. But they weren't able to see it because by the time they saw it, it was a little bit too late, &gt;&gt; right? But Rahab got into that same inspiration that she wanted a part of that. &gt;&gt; She knew where the overcoming power was and she wanted to get into that one. &gt;&gt; She wanted to get into that boat. &gt;&gt; She wanted to get with that group of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see deliverance there. I want that God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That God is powerful. That God could do something. He isn't on holiday. &gt;&gt; He's actually doing something in there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's power within that God. &gt;&gt; I want that God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses had to catch real inspiration. He was taught from a young age that there was a deliver. He knew something was going to happen, but then it fell through because he thought he missed it. He thought he made a mistake, but he didn't. He Heard, but he didn't understand until he got on the back side of the desert. &gt;&gt; In the desperation, the in the understanding comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, not only Moses had to come under the inspiration, but the people that followed him &gt;&gt; had to come under the same inspiration. But were there some that rebelled? Absolutely. He had to deal with Kora and Nathan. &gt;&gt; Right. He had to deal with the rebellious spirits. But the people that followed, they had to come under the same inspiration. &gt;&gt; Why else were the signs shown to them? They had to see the signs. And that's how they believed it. Because they knew that God was with them. &gt;&gt; They had to get in the same inspiration. Your pastor preaches, preaches, uh uh service after service, has ministry come in, the congregation has to get under the same inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the times of doubt, the Lord would send an angel to inspire. You think of Gideon, right? We see that through the scripture when when when men of God would would uh uh uh just lose hope if if if if that's okay to say, they would they would uh they would be uh uh uh discouraged. I say, I'm getting tired. I should probably wind down because I'm having a hard time finding words. But people would when they would get discouraged, he would send an angel, &gt;&gt; an encouraging angel. Right? So Gideon Gideon said, "If God be before be before us, where are all the miracles? Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord of h face to face. He had an experience with the Lord." Amen. He came face to face with it. He came to terms with it. He had his experience with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua was told by an angel of the Lord, "Be strong and be not dismayed. Be strong and of a good courage." I can't even remember how many times that statement is all through the scripture. &gt;&gt; But a lot of it was spoken to Joshua. &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. Think of you read in Hebrews 11, think of Barack and Jeepa and David and Samuel and Job and all these these men the the heroes of the faith, right? &gt;&gt; They were of of they were men of like passions. &gt;&gt; They were men just like us. They weren't superhuman, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They had they probably had questions in their minds. Am I being led to the Lord? Is this the spirit of the Lord or is this the spirit of Satan? Is this this? Is this that? Is this it? Even John the Baptist had that struggle, right? &gt;&gt; Is this the one that we look for? And then Jesus had to send messengers. &gt;&gt; The lepers are healed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The blind see, the deaf ear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That answered his question. Yes. This is the one that we've been looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to wind down. Okay. And uh in Job 1 and two, Job is described as as perfect and upright, one that feared God and assued evil. He put evil away. And and and the scripture says that there was no one else like him in the earth. God bragged on him for doing so. Satan is one that walked around to and fro. That that fellow, poor guy, don't have mercy on him. He's got to walk to and fro. Amen. Satan accused Job of being babyed and sheltered from God. And that's why Job was the way that he was. Right? So that was that was the accusation that Satan brought against Job. So God told Satan that he could have his way with him. Only he couldn't take his life. And Satan didn't waste any time. He went right on it. &gt;&gt; Took his servants, took his family, took his uhh his riches, took everything that he had except what except his life, &gt;&gt; trying to get him to curse God. &gt;&gt; But Job's loyalty to God was greater than the temptation of Satan. Amen. Job 3, Job begins his lamentation theology. Amen. He starts lamenting about woe is me, why am I going through all this stuff and all the things that he's speaking. Sorry, I'd labeled that as his lamentation theology. And after Job was in his lamentation, he couldn't get any word from the Lord. He didn't get any comfort from the Lord. He was so focused on his situation. The company of his three friends didn't help him any which we read about Eliu even rebuking them for saying so. You said all this stuff but yet you had nothing to say. They were accusing him of being a secret sinner. So Job was trying to just him justify himself rather than God. Right? Seeing himself righteous in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; So that's what Eliu had enough. Not only was he angry with Job, but he was also angry with his three friends. because they were guessing. &gt;&gt; Now, the inspiration of God, it comes true every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were just guessing. They didn't have the inspiration. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They were guessing. Well, how do you know a prophet is a true prophet by what he says if it comes to pass or not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, inspiration struck Eliu that it came and rebuked these men. You just you just uttered all these things, labelled him as a hypocrite, but had nothing to say. You really had no answer for him. You could have at least said, "Hey, brother, we're here with you." Yeah. But I don't know. It was just criticism after criticism after criticism. It was hammer, hammer, hammer. &gt;&gt; Where's the word of encouragement? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Eliu right at that moment, he didn't have a respector. He wasn't a respector of persons, right? He just came and threw the rebuke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had respect, but he didn't have respect of persons. He respect them as because they were elders. He even he even said himself that I kept myself quiet. I let you say these things. I'm talking to the young ones and even to the older ones. You know, there are some people that just have no respect. You know, when you're talking to people, they just come and they just jump right into the conversation, &gt;&gt; right? When one of you is talking, &gt;&gt; you know, and they don't care what you're saying. They just jump right into the conversation. No respect at all. &gt;&gt; Zero. If they had an ounce of respect, they would have waited until the person finished. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't know why I'm teaching manners here, but you know, but that that's like a basic manner that you teach your young ones. Yes. &gt;&gt; Wait until the older one is done speaking. Then you could say, "Excuse me. &gt;&gt; May I say something?" &gt;&gt; That's the way it should be. That's a good example right there. Eliu kept himself quiet. Let the elders speak, brother. Sorry, I I don't mean to take your spot there. That's a pastoral spot right there. But you understand what I mean, &gt;&gt; he had respect. And oh my, that's I just think Eliu is a is a very good example in the scripture right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when the re when the Lord came and brought his rebuke, Eliu wasn't in the rebuke &gt;&gt; because he conducted himself with good manners. &gt;&gt; Amen. He conducted himself with respect. Amen. &gt;&gt; God isn't a respector of persons, but he respects respect. You have respect unto the Lord. God demands respect, right? So when we show respect unto the Lord, let me tell you something. This whole thing, I could go through this. I'm just going to cover it in in in a nutshell here. Pretty much what it's saying is if you bring a a a repentance unto the Lord, you might have done some wrongs. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; You might have done some wrongs, but if you can humble yourself and say, "Lord, I have done wrong. Please forgive me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Repentance will bring favor of God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you humbled yourself and you gave respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would encourage you to read Job. You know, it's only 40, what is it? 42 chapters long. 42 43 42 vers or chapters long. Not verses. Brother, you lied to us. There's more than 42 verses. There's 42 chapters, &gt;&gt; but there's some good stuff in there. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of it is repetitive. I I give you that. I I I understand that. Like, it took it took a whole chapter for Elijah to to say what he was trying to say before he even got started and say what he wanted to say. I I understand that. uh job in Job in 38 that's when God starts to rebuke Job. So I just wanted to uh in Job chapter 40 in the third verse he says then Job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile. He says I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once I have spoken I will not answer. He said I've already spoke once. I'm just going to keep quiet right here. I'm not going to say anymore. I done dug myself a hole. I got myself in trouble. I'm just going to keep quiet. Lord, whatever you say, that's what goes. Now, he's saying, once have I spoken, but I will not answer. Yay. Twice, but I will proceed no further. Amen. And now, we're going to get to the opening scripture uh sooner or later, I guess. Well, it's it's the second portion. Job 42. In the first verse, he says, "Then Job answered, Then Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou canst do everything, and that no thought can be withholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore, have I uttered that I understood not? I uttered those things which I didn't understand. Things too wonderful for me which I knew not. Here I beseech thee. I will speak. I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eyes seeth thee. Wherefore I abore myself and repent and dust and ashes. Amen. See, we we've got to get beyond the head knowledge. You know, a lot of it's up here, but we got to get beyond that. We've got to let it drop down into our heart. &gt;&gt; But people, until you see it for yourself, and I and I know that most of you, I don't know where everybody's sitting, but until you see it for yourself, until you see him for yourself, he is someone else's God. You read through the promises, those are someone else's prom promises. until you see it for yourself, he becomes yours. Those promises become yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't make it just a head knowledge, but it got to be on the inside. Amen. So &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to find a good place to close here. you know, when we get into the types of those situations of, you know, uh, in Job's situation where it feels like we're just down, we're discouraged, we're disheartened, we're in despair. We wonder how we get into those conditions, you know, and then we start feeling about the feeling the same way that Job did. But Job asked where is where is the one whom I believed? Where is the God that I have lived my life for? Where is my God in whom I have put my trust? You feel lost. These are some of the questions that the heroes of the faith people renown in the scripture. These are the same questions that they were asking. &gt;&gt; Where is my God? Where is the God of the Bible? Where is the God of that laid out these promises? Where is the God? Where is the one whom I have put my trust in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you might feel lost. You might feel abandoned. You might feel that he's far from you and that he doesn't love you anymore. That's not true. These are the trying times of faith. This is where the older eagles drop down. They they have had the same experience and they drop down the meat to the other eagles during the moping period. I don't have I ever preached that message here? I don't think I have. Well, Lord willing. Wait a second. Did something change? Didn't you have an eagle hanging up? Wasn't that y'all? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that was somewhere else. Okay, that must have been somewhere else. Sorry. But there there's something about the the the the way that eagles are and it's and it's a wonderful type because the older eagles, they get into what's called a moping period and they're they're discard they're discard dis oh goodness disheartened. Let me say that one first. Seems how it wants to come out first. They were discouraged. They were they're having a hard time. They they just feel like they can't fly anymore. They're just so weak they can't do anything. But the older eagles that have gone through that experience, they are the ones that go and they get the fresh meat. They get the fresh meat and then they drop it down to these ones that are going through the moping period. Not all the not all the ones that are going through the moping period overcome. But the ones that have a will, the ones that have a drive, the ones that want to stay alive, they'll eat the fresh meat. And then when they start partaking of the fresh meat, they tend to they they become strong. They become encouraged. They they they get to be able to start flapping their wings again. Their eyes are becoming open again. It's a renewing. It's a refreshing. &gt;&gt; That's where the experienced ones come in. Say, "I've been in your shoes before. I've had that experience before. This is how I got out of it. Let me encourage you a little bit. Let me give you a little bit of meat of the word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They drop down the meat and it just strengthens those eagles during the moping period &gt;&gt; to where they can rise up one more time. &gt;&gt; They can flap their wings and get into the skies where they belong. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is the time when we need to inspire one another. This is where we need to unify. I'm not talking just this body of believers. I'm talking the body of believers. This is a many membered bride. I'm talking about believers across the world. You hear when somebody has a has a a need of prayer, we go to pray for him, right? We pray for the bride across the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is the time where we admonish one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, which is what we're instructed to do in the scriptures, right? Singing with grace into our hearts unto the Lord. This is where we need to find inspiration in the Lord. Inspiration to sing out and praise him. This is the time to recognize who he is and our position in him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that's how songs and hymns came about was through adversity. &gt;&gt; It as well comes to my mind. A man that loses his family, but yet he can still write a song that encourages hundreds and thousands and millions that it is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. It's through adversity where people were able to receive an inspiration to write these songs, to write poems, to write different books, to encourage and inspire others. &gt;&gt; Amen. So inspiration is a good thing as long as you are in the way of righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I've taken a long time. I'm going to close with this. Second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 12, it says, "For the which cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. Hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and in love which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. Amen. Let's stand to your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might get tired of thinking wondering if God is real. I know we have young ones sitting here. You know, you hear the older ones talk about the goodness of the Lord and you you hear other people's testimonies of different things that of good things. You know, you hear these things that have happened in people's lives. I' I think I've said it here before. Don't go try to have a testimony like what I have, like what brother David has, like what my wife has. &gt;&gt; You need to have find your testimony. &gt;&gt; Don't go seeking one like what I have. I was in the world. You have a better, stronger testimony when you can keep yourself from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; People that have gone out of the world are scarred from the things that they endured. &gt;&gt; Don't go looking for those things. Be content with what the Lord has done for you. It's stronger than what you think. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you maintain that testimony, oh, yours would be better than mine any day. &gt;&gt; Any day. Because I would love to say that I was unmarked from the things of the world. I would love to be able to say I never picked up a cigarette. I would love to say I never picked up an adult book. &gt;&gt; I would love to say that I never drank alcohol for pleasure. I would love to say that I didn't do the things that I did. &gt;&gt; So keep yourselves pure, unspotted from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Greater is your testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you might be tired of hearing somebody else's testimony and you're wondering, you might be wondering when am I going to have my testimony. You've got your testimony. When you say, "I love to o when the doors of the the house of worship open, I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord." That's a testimony. When you could say, "I'm happy to sing praises unto God without things of the world, things that I've done, mistakes that I've done coming and clouding your mind, you're free of those things." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can worship more freely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're struggling with those things in our minds. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, when you when you it you think it's easy for me to come preach these things. How many times have I thought of myself as a hypocrite &gt;&gt; trying to get your to get your foothold in Christ? How many times I think of myself as a hypocrite knowing that I've done some of those things is not easy for somebody that was out in the world. You think it's easy to come and minister the things that I do. You know how many spirits, brother, you could attest to it. You You know how many spirits are battling up here? Just to bring you the word of grace. Just to bring you the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a breakthrough. It's not an easy job. &gt;&gt; You know, I was naive when I first started ministering, not realizing. I don't know why I'm going on, but it's it's it's not an easy thing to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, people just they they have the wrong idea about it. Well, well, I have so many thoughts I could be sermons. Did an anointing strike it? &gt;&gt; Did an inspiration strike it? Then it's not going to do me any good. &gt;&gt; Words are just that, words. &gt;&gt; Until some quickening life comes behind it. &gt;&gt; That's what makes it come alive. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I don't know why I said those things, &gt;&gt; but what I want to say is you might be looking at somebody else's testimony and thinking, "Why can't I experience those things?" You're having your own experiences right now to where somebody else might say, "Why can't I have that experience? You can't be me. I can't be you. You can't be brother Jesse. You can't be brother Jose. You can't be I don't know your name, brother, but you can't be brother Malachi. And I can't remember your name, brother, but you can't be somebody else. You have to live in your moment, in your life. &gt;&gt; You're developing your relationship with the Lord. Don't try to look at somebody else's testimony and say, "Why can't I be there?" You just be content and say, "Thank you, Lord, that you have kept me from these things and you've brought me here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're here, you're in a good spot. Now, see, when I was young, I understand you were forced to come to church. Don't raise your hands, little ones. But if you weren't forced to come to church because mommy and daddy goes to church and they can't leave you at home by yourself, would you still want to come to church? &gt;&gt; Would you still want to come to church? &gt;&gt; Now, you older ones, here I go again. bringing it right now. If so and so doesn't see me at church, are going to they are they going to think less spiritual? Am I are they going to think that I'm less spiritual? &gt;&gt; Are they going to think that I'm serpent seed because I didn't show up to church? Well, I better go to church. If you're thinking that, then you're coming for the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; The real genuine reason why you can't wait for the doors to open is because you want to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; You want to come and worship. You want to become better than what you than what you came in. &gt;&gt; You want to change your condition. &gt;&gt; And I've gone on. I've gone on. So So I just thank the Lord for all that he's done. Thank you for letting me yell at you one more time. But shouting, I just get excited sometimes. But remember, you can't judge the quality of a service by how much a a minister shouts or how excited they get. You know, and people get addicted to those things. I think I've talked about here that here before, but we be careful of those things. But what is the fruit of it? My whole purpose, my whole drive, the whole inspiration that drives me is has it made a difference in your life? &gt;&gt; That's the question that I want you to ask yourself. Lord, what what was spoken here this morning, is that going to have an impact for the positive in my life? What is it in my life that I need to change today before I even walk out of here that I want to walk out of here in a better condition than when I showed up? &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come and brother Jesse, if you want, let's bow our heads. Most gracious heavenly father. Lord, I just I' I've gone on for a long time, but uh Lord, I just uh pray that it was of good substance, &gt;&gt; but Lord, I more importantly, I pray that it was your spirit speaking these things through my lips. Father, I I know I spoke things as as a man in human flesh, but Lord, may I have been moved by inspiration of your Holy Spirit. May it be God breathed. But Lord, I just pray that there was an impact on somebody's life here for the positive today that they have seen something that they have heard something that they not only heard but they see and it turns into understanding. Being able to see is understanding. But Lord, I just pray that something has changed somebody today. Father, we know that there's nothing good in me except what you've placed in in in in in my life, oh God. And I just thank you and I appreciate you. But Lord, I pray that you would be with the young ones here today, Lord. Some may have no desire to be here because they're forced to come here. Lord, some might have a have have the desire to to want to leave up quick and in a hurry. But there are others that have a desire to stay here. And I thank you for those that have that desire. But the ones that don't have the desire for you, I pray that today would be a changing time in their life. That they would have a a hunger and a thirst for Jesus Christ. That they would have a hunger and a thirst for the word of God. That they would have a hunger and a thirst for the inspiration of your spirit to come into their lives. Lord, maybe they'll write a song. Lord, maybe they'll write a poem. Maybe they'll they'll they'll they'll write a book. Maybe they'll they'll they'll do something else that encourages somebody else. But Lord, when we when we receive the inspiration, may it may not just be a hearing, but may we act upon it. May it be a true inspiration when when a when a great excitement comes upon us that we that we have we can't do anything but what you want us to do, oh Lord. Father, may we be found uh uh uh uh faithful being about the father's business, Lord. May we just be faithful, found in your word, found reading and praying and waiting for you to come. May that may we be like the servants uh uh just waiting for your appearance to to arrive. Oh God, Lord, we just love you. We appreciate you. We ask that you would bless the ministry that would come through come through this place, be with the pastor, just help him and lead him and guide him as as the shepherd of this flock. Continue to give him revelation. Continue to to be with him that he would speak boldness with grace from his mouth. the thing the oracles of God Lord as you lay it upon his heart father as we depart from here uh uh may we never depart from your presence may but may you always be with us and about us oh God giving us h giving us encouragement giving us safety where wherever we would go and may we always have uh something nice to say coming from our mouths oh God Lord may may we not tear others down but may we may we lift one another up Lord I just feel tired of my body I just feel my thoughts waning. But Lord, I just pray that you would that you would come and and speak through me, oh Father. Lord, if there's anybody that has a need, we'd be happy to pray with them today. But Lord, uh just be it known that we believe that you are that you are uh you strengthen us to be an overcomer, that you strengthen us to to uh uh uh follow after the things of righteousness. And L Lord, we we long for your spirit to be within us. That would we would make good decisions that we would uh uh be around those that have a good influence. That we would lay our eyes on those things that are uh uh not the wickedness, but that we would lay our eyes, whether it's uh uh uh uh uh videos or whatever it is, reading material, that we would lay our eyes on the things that are of righteousness, that we would forsake and and and and uh uh walk away and shun the very appearance of evil. Oh God, we ask all these things in your precious name, our Lord Jesus Christ. May each one be go and give you glory and to give you honor and to give you praise. Again, we ask it in your precious name, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen.
