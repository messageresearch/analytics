[33:27] picture you know for what i thought i
[33:29] had
[33:30] um but one of the i like this pastor i
[33:32] don't know this pastor but he had a good
[33:33] text
[33:34] or a good tweet rather
[33:36] he said the statue resembles the beast
[33:38] from revelation 13. these things are
[33:40] done on purpose satan's behind it the
[33:41] u.n is finally erecting an image of
[33:43] defiance i just surprised it's not
[33:44] wearing a mask
[33:46] i thought that's a pretty good sense of
[33:47] humor don't you
[33:54] uh now brother brahm taught us
[33:56] revelation 13 2 was
[34:00] pagan rome i'm sorry there's always a
[34:01] always got to be careful there pagan and
[34:03] papua it's pagan rome
[34:05] okay
[34:06] because later in that chapter it morphs
[34:08] into papal rome
[34:10] remember it got a deadly wound and then
[34:12] it was healed
[34:14] the deadly wound was when pagan rome
[34:16] ceased and papal rome took control right
[34:20] through constantine and through i
[34:22] believe through the popes that they set
[34:24] up through uh it was through the uh the
[34:26] fourth and fifth century a.d
[34:29] so that's clearly laid out in the church
[34:30] age book it's a really uh wonderful
[34:32] study uh but as i've as i looked at it
[34:35] you know i realized it was actually a
[34:36] combination of two beasts
[34:39] it was a combination of the beast out of
[34:40] the the sea in revelation 13 and it's
[34:43] also a combination uh with
[34:46] the roman beast or the first beast
[34:49] that daniel saw in daniel chapter 7.
[34:52] okay so here's what i mean in in
[34:54] revelation 13 2 it talks about a beast
[34:56] he's like a leopard
[34:58] does that look like a leopard
[35:00] pretty similar right his feet were as a
[35:02] feet of a bear he does he did have big
[35:04] feet
[35:05] that's pretty big feet
[35:08] um
[35:09] mouth as the mouth of a lion we saw that
[35:12] got a big lion's mouth there
[35:14] um
[35:15] and then it ends so
[35:17] revelation 13 2 doesn't speak of the
[35:20] wings right but to find the wings you
[35:22] got to go back to you know daniel
[35:24] chapter 7. so i just thought i'd share
[35:26] that with you um
[35:28] daniel sees four beasts right and
[35:30] they're the four gentile kingdoms that
[35:32] will rule the world until the time of
[35:34] gentiles is over
[35:36] right the first the bible said was like
[35:38] a lion and had eagle's wings
[35:42] so this uh this of course was babylon
[35:46] this was nebuchadnezzar's rule
[35:49] okay and then of course the second beast
[35:50] come up in chapter seven i preached on
[35:52] them before uh bless you
[35:55] and so i just thought it was interesting
[35:56] they're combining the first
[35:58] roman
[35:59] symbols with the beasts out of the land
[36:02] i'm sorry the beast out of the sea
[36:03] rather
[36:04] so just interesting i thought you would
[36:06] uh appreciate seeing that to me it's
[36:08] just really striking i mean they are
[36:09] just getting so bold satan is getting so
[36:11] bold
[36:12] right but that makes sense as harvest
[36:14] time nears everyone has to show their
[36:16] true seed
[36:18] praise god how many want to show the
[36:19] seed of god amen
[36:20] that's that incorruptible seed that
[36:22] eternal seed of god that cannot sin
[36:25] praise god the baptism of the holy ghost
[36:27] in your soul hallelujah
[36:30] but they're getting so bold so that
[36:32] shows us if they're getting more bold
[36:34] than then obviously we are too like like
[36:36] people have been texting me all week
[36:37] this month or all month your videos are
[36:39] getting so bold your sermons are getting
[36:41] so bold i said well that makes sense
[36:42] we're supposed to come to seed praise
[36:44] god
[36:45] we're supposed to come to maturity
[36:47] we're supposed to come to the spot where
[36:48] we're bowing to the sun in everything
[36:50] amen
[36:51] we're obedient to the sun in all things
[36:54] praise god
[36:55] so it just it fits and of course this is
[36:58] just a uh this is a just a larger
[37:00] picture you can kind of see
[37:01] you know how it's a combination of those
[37:04] beasts
[37:05] and they say that's a symbol of unity
[37:09] that's a symbol of war
[37:11] right and they're going to have their
[37:12] war right they're going to try to
[37:14] they're going to try to kill the bride
[37:15] but jesus is going to rescue the bride
[37:17] amen
[37:18] and then they're going to take they're
[37:19] going to defeat anyone who won't take
[37:21] the mark of the beast and then that will
[37:23] turn against the jews as well they will
[37:25] try to destroy all the jews but thank
[37:27] god jesus comes to rescue them as well
[37:30] thank god for his mercy praise god so
[37:32] that was the first one and and just
[37:34] noticed too with the coronavirus you
[37:35] know jesus said men's hearts will be
[37:37] failing them for fear
[37:39] so just getting back to the omicron or
[37:42] delta variant whatever the variants are
[37:45] jesus said pestilences are going to come
[37:48] they've we've had the potato famines
[37:50] remember the potato famines in england
[37:52] they had them hundreds of years ago i
[37:54] mean jesus christ prophesied all these
[37:56] things and through coronavirus now we
[37:58] can see how this was going to be a major
[38:00] part of the end time events
[38:03] right we're still going to have more
[38:04] earthquakes and diverse places that's
[38:05] been going on for hundreds of years of
[38:07] course we know they're increased you
[38:09] know as as the the rapture is
[38:11] approaching
[38:12] but we just must remember that church
[38:14] never let our hearts be overcharged with
[38:16] fear
[38:18] god does not give the spirit of fear but
[38:21] of the power of love and a sound mind
[38:24] praise god
[38:26] uh
[38:27] so let's just you know let's just always
[38:29] aim to play or to place our hearts on
[38:31] the love of god that god loves me and
[38:34] god is for me and god is not against me
[38:37] and anything that happens in my life he
[38:39] allowed it to come to pass and i can
[38:41] trust him with my life
[38:44] and all the good things uh that he that
[38:47] he started in my life he will bring to a
[38:48] fruition
[38:51] uh like brother man said in the church
[38:52] age book he might allow me to have great
[38:54] blessings all my life or you or someone
[38:57] else but he might allow others to suffer
[38:59] more
[39:00] he like he allowed brother ram to suffer
[39:02] in a car accident at the end of his life
[39:04] or suffer with that stomach condition
[39:06] every seven years and how paul suffered
[39:08] with blindness you know uh off and on
[39:10] sight trouble you know god is going to
[39:12] allow he may commit some of us to the
[39:14] grave he may commit some of us you know
[39:16] to uh to three weeks in the hospital
[39:18] with covent brother you know just awful
[39:20] things that we would not want anyone to
[39:22] experience
[39:23] difficult times losing loved ones you
[39:25] know uh unexpectedly
[39:28] unexpected deaths you know all things
[39:30] that are are just are just so
[39:32] so awful to us
[39:34] but we must must remember that god has a
[39:36] great plan for our lives and if anyone
[39:39] is fair in this universe it is god
[39:41] almighty
[39:42] if anyone is just if anyone is righteous
[39:44] if anyone knows what they're doing in
[39:46] this universe it's jesus christ
[39:48] and he is our god amen and he has made
[39:51] us kings and priests unto god
[39:54] so we learn church as time goes on we
[39:56] learn to trust in the living god who the
[39:59] bible says he's without variableness
[40:01] he doesn't favor one nation above the
[40:04] other
[40:04] uh he doesn't favor one family because
[40:06] your last name over another family like
[40:09] the branham family or any other family
[40:11] you can name after that god doesn't
[40:13] favor any families amen
[40:15] god is faithful and he's righteous and
[40:17] he's just and our desire is to serve god
[40:20] and to give god thanks in the midst of
[40:23] all that he and his wisdom has allowed
[40:25] to come to pass
[40:26] amen hallelujah remember church
[40:29] suffering produces obedience
[40:32] suffering produces obedience last time i
[40:34] was sick i would just
[40:35] i couldn't do hardly do anything so i
[40:37] just said lord if you heal me i'm going
[40:38] to come out there and i'm going to
[40:39] preach harder than i ever have i'm going
[40:41] to make more videos than i ever have and
[40:42] i have
[40:43] so that taught me to redeem the time
[40:45] amen because look at this you know look
[40:47] at this we don't we don't want to we
[40:49] don't want to forget we don't want to
[40:50] waste our time now we want to make the
[40:53] most of our time now that we see these
[40:54] things happening
[40:56] right they're getting so bold to make uh
[41:00] their uh their powers known right and
[41:03] you know even the article said that they
[41:04] got this from uh
[41:06] the aztecs the united nations got this
[41:09] from the aztecs who were murderers
[41:13] and they had a they had a shrine as big
[41:15] as a football field a field filled with
[41:17] human skulls and that's their
[41:18] inspiration for unity and protection
[41:21] yeah they're going to guard they're
[41:22] going to guard satan's kingdom is what
[41:24] they're going to guard
[41:25] right they're not guarding god's kingdom
[41:27] so you always look at the inspiration
[41:29] behind something okay
[41:31] so now this is one i found yesterday uh
[41:34] pope francis christmas mass come god
[41:37] comes into the world in littleness now
[41:38] he's got that right
[41:40] but there he is kissing a statue
[41:42] so just another reminder about the
[41:44] idolatry he's kissing a baby porcelain
[41:47] or whatever clay statue
[41:50] they worship those things
[41:52] uh
[41:53] and he's right in one aspect but then
[41:55] he's a million miles wrong on the other
[41:58] so we just watch these people watch them
[42:01] now here's the one vang shared with me
[42:03] now van there there may be two i may
[42:05] have missed one of yours
[42:06] but this one there's an abrahamic family
[42:09] house in
[42:11] abu i'm no i know i'm saying this wrong
[42:13] abu dhabi okay i'm trying to pronounce
[42:16] that right
[42:18] and it's going to go up in 2022 so there
[42:20] it is united arab emirates okay just
[42:23] cause i i don't i could not have found
[42:25] it unless i looked on google maps
[42:27] because i'm not really good with my
[42:28] geography okay so there's israel and
[42:30] location to it you know you can see
[42:32] where
[42:33] so they have three buildings and then
[42:34] what it's going to be is this and it's
[42:36] supposed to open next year
[42:38] if you have a house for muslims you have
[42:40] a house for christians and a house for
[42:41] jews all together
[42:43] in one location there so we can
[42:44] obviously see the one world government
[42:47] clearly issuing in and letting us know
[42:50] which spirit is behind them it's the
[42:52] roman spirit and if you go back to that
[42:53] article it says the pope was he was one
[42:56] of the main contributors to make this a
[42:58] reality
[42:59] well that sounds right doesn't it he's
[43:01] going to sit in the temple of god saying
[43:03] that he is god now which of these
[43:05] temples i don't know it might be the
[43:06] jewish temple too right might be the
[43:07] third temple when they rebuild that
[43:09] so we're watching and praying how many
[43:11] watching and praying
[43:12] for the coming of the lord
[43:15] you know every year we hear a preacher
[43:16] say oh he's gonna god's gonna come back
[43:18] this year right
[43:19] and every year it's the next year and
[43:20] every year is the next year we've
[43:21] learned not to do that
[43:23] we've learned to just watch and pray and
[43:26] be stable and be solid like a rock
[43:30] and not make foolish predictions for no
[43:32] man knows the day or the hour
[43:34] but as we see these things we're aware
[43:36] of them and we
[43:37] we just
[43:38] we let it cause us to be more watchful
[43:41] and prayerful in our daily lives
[43:44] uh so the last one was this i saw that
[43:45] one yesterday i just i was i was
[43:47] scrolling looking for a video i was
[43:48] looking for one and but this one came
[43:50] out i thought oh my i even subscribed to
[43:52] them of course i subscribe to them
[43:53] because i'm keeping my eye on the purple
[43:54] curtain
[43:55] the catholic news service mary this
[43:58] woman says marrying is a mary is
[44:00] appearing to her in italy it's about 30
[44:02] miles
[44:03] from rome
[44:05] and every every week hundreds of people
[44:08] flock to this shrine of mary
[44:10] and this woman sees apparently sees mary
[44:13] writes down what she's saying and then
[44:14] tells the people about it
[44:16] and her message from mary was there's
[44:18] now let's listen her message from mary
[44:20] was there's a great tribulation coming
[44:23] and please pray to me so people can be
[44:25] saved from it
[44:27] now isn't that look how close that is we
[44:29] know the tribulation's coming but we
[44:31] know we're not supposed to pray to mary
[44:32] because that's spiritualism
[44:35] that's interacting with devils
[44:37] so see how close it would be it seems
[44:39] like it's so nice pray pray for souls to
[44:41] be saved but yet it has idolatry
[44:43] completely woven into it and the whole
[44:45] time she's there she's praying the
[44:47] prayer beads you know you can watch it's
[44:48] a three minute video i mean i watch it
[44:50] this morning
[44:51] uh but just again you know and people
[44:53] are flocking there and the uh the
[44:55] priests are investigating it saying
[44:56] here's another apparition and this this
[44:59] possibly could be god visiting us and we
[45:01] know it's not god visiting us
[45:04] that's why you got to watch that jesus
[45:05] calling book too right and all those uh
[45:07] any of those people that say they hear
[45:08] from god kenneth copeland we i mean we
[45:10] preached it last year remember
[45:12] all these people that say they hear from
[45:14] god
[45:15] a tree is known by its fruit
[45:17] any fruit that says pray to mary or pray
[45:19] to the dead is a fruit of satan it's a
[45:21] corrupt fruit
[45:23] so just you know i just thought i'd
[45:24] share those four or five things there
[45:26] was that was that helpful by god's grace
[45:27] and i like when vayne i like when you
[45:29] share those with i like when everybody
[45:30] shares those with me let's keep our eyes
[45:32] open praise god let's not fall asleep at
[45:33] this hour
[45:34] it's kind of it's slowly bringing to
[45:36] head and we know the coronavirus and the
[45:38] vaccine vaccine mandates it's just a
[45:40] prefigure to the mark of the beast
[45:42] right mandates it's just a prefigure
[45:45] where they're going to mandate worship
[45:46] with us or you cannot buy or sell
[45:49] but brother man tells us christ will
[45:50] rescue the bride right before the mark
[45:52] is laid down so we're trusting in that
[45:54] by god's grace so let's look here uh i
[45:56] would like to get to this here and i'll
[45:57] just let me set my timer for just 45
[45:59] more minutes i probably went 15 minutes
[46:00] on there i'll try to preach an hour
[46:03] uh lord willing
[46:06] uh
[46:07] so well let's uh we've enjoyed this uh
[46:09] joshua series i was telling brother amen
[46:11] that this
[46:12] has really been a huge blessing to me
[46:13] it's been a help to me to it really
[46:16] showed me that i was possessing god's
[46:18] promises
[46:19] and that god was with me
[46:21] for no man or woman has been able to
[46:23] cause me to stumble
[46:25] all the days of my life
[46:27] in other words every battle we face
[46:29] church every battle you face i face we
[46:32] will be victorious
[46:34] somehow or another we may stumble we may
[46:35] you know we may sin and fall short of
[46:38] the glory of god but if we humble
[46:39] ourselves and get back up and fight
[46:42] god is going to fight for us
[46:45] remember just like jericho some battles
[46:47] god fights all by himself you just got
[46:49] to praise god
[46:50] you just got to shout amen other battles
[46:53] like when they defeated all those kings
[46:55] the five kings that were attacking the
[46:56] gimme knights god let them have a part
[46:58] in the ambush
[47:00] amen god let them hold the sword of the
[47:03] word of god and fight off the enemies
[47:05] amen
[47:06] so there's different kinds of battles
[47:08] but god is going to be with us
[47:11] all throughout 2022 as well
[47:13] should he tarry praise god for god
[47:15] cannot fail amen
[47:17] and he loves his children now we're
[47:18] going to finish up this book hopefully
[47:20] in the next month or so this is part 35.
[47:23] we're going to look at chapter 21 and we
[47:24] may get to chapter 22 today uh chapter
[47:27] 21 we looked at the levites a few weeks
[47:29] ago and brother brooks was here last
[47:30] sunday um
[47:32] and we're look we're finishing up with
[47:33] god's faithfulness to israel
[47:35] and how the levites got their own cities
[47:37] of refuge next chapter is joshua's words
[47:40] to the tribes on the east of jordan the
[47:42] two and half tribes and then the
[47:45] confusion when they built an altar to
[47:47] the lord
[47:48] so praise god all right so let's finish
[47:51] joshua chapter 21. let's look again a
[47:53] little bit at god's faithfulness praise
[47:55] god how many glad he's faithful
[47:57] amen now remember church that joshua he
[48:00] writes this in joshua 21 and god has
[48:04] already been faithful to him around 110
[48:07] years
[48:08] imagine that living over a hundred years
[48:11] and you can look back at the entire span
[48:14] of your life and say god you were
[48:16] faithful to me when i was in egypt amen
[48:18] hallelujah god you were faithful to me
[48:20] when i was a sinner
[48:22] god you were faithful to me when i got
[48:24] justified and come out of egypt amen
[48:27] you were faithful to me as i wandered
[48:29] around
[48:30] in sanctification praise god
[48:33] and you were faithful to me when you
[48:35] took me into the promised land with a
[48:37] mighty hand
[48:39] and once i got in the holy ghost that's
[48:40] when the battle started amen amen and
[48:43] since i've been in the holy ghost jesus
[48:45] you've been faithful to me all 31 kings
[48:48] all the enemies have fallen before you
[48:50] because you're the conqueror you're the
[48:52] mighty warrior amen
[48:54] hallelujah so he looks back
[48:58] after 31 years in the baptism of the
[49:00] holy ghost
[49:01] and he says these beautiful words
[49:05] he says lord
[49:06] he said you've given me rest round about
[49:09] and no man should before me remember
[49:11] chapter 1 god tells joshua no man will
[49:14] stand before you all the days of your
[49:16] life
[49:17] the only time they fail was when they
[49:19] didn't pray
[49:21] they tried to go up to ai and not pray
[49:23] about it and joshua learned the lesson
[49:25] you got to pray before every battle
[49:28] you got to pray every morning you got to
[49:30] pray for every service you got to pray
[49:32] every day of your life
[49:34] amen especially when you're going into a
[49:36] battle praise god
[49:39] and god delivered all their enemies
[49:42] into their hand
[49:45] god's word never failed think of that
[49:47] god's word never failed
[49:50] now if god didn't fail them under the
[49:51] old testament of blood of bulls and
[49:53] goats what about you and i under the
[49:55] blood of christ god will not fail us
[49:57] either
[49:58] so if we seem disappointed the thing to
[50:00] do is let the word of god wash away our
[50:02] disappointment
[50:03] or maybe clean off our little lenses
[50:06] praise god and just help us to see more
[50:08] clearly or maybe look the other way look
[50:10] to jesus amen change our perspective and
[50:13] realize god allowed it and god's with me
[50:15] he's helping me he's making me a
[50:17] stronger christian he's making me more
[50:19] than a conqueror
[50:21] and i needed this trial so i could be a
[50:24] better christian hallelujah
[50:26] amen
[50:28] that's right like i think all of us got
[50:30] covered so we could tell austin it's
[50:31] going to be okay so he's probably
[50:33] streaming right now because he he
[50:34] admitted he told me that was one of his
[50:36] major battles and i agree i was when i
[50:38] got first got i was afraid too but after
[50:40] three days i was good thank you thanks
[50:42] to my wife for thanks to my wife nursing
[50:44] me back to health and jesus healed my
[50:45] body praise god
[50:47] and so see you know we think why would
[50:49] we go through these things well
[50:51] it's part of prophecy the pestilences
[50:54] have to come but also god has to
[50:56] manifest he's a healer amen
[50:59] and then also so you can testify that
[51:01] i've gone through this and i've overcome
[51:04] it and god was with me and god healed me
[51:06] and now i can testify
[51:08] because i overcome by the blood of the
[51:10] lamb and the word of my testimony amen
[51:13] that's how i overcome the devil amen
[51:16] you got to testify about it we got to
[51:17] testify about the grace of god amen
[51:20] that's how we overcome
[51:23] i mean it'd be a great test it wouldn't
[51:25] be great if you say well i never got
[51:26] covered all those years of covert that'd
[51:28] be a nice testimony that'd be wonderful
[51:31] but then what about all the other
[51:32] spiritual people are you saying you're
[51:33] more spiritual
[51:34] that could lead to pride amen
[51:39] so see we've got to be thankful that if
[51:40] god's allowed it god's going to bring us
[51:43] through we can still say god's word
[51:45] never fail me
[51:50] god is the author and finisher of our
[51:51] faith
[51:53] he started us he saved us he the bible
[51:55] said he led us
[51:56] to repentance through the goodness of
[51:58] god amen the goodness of god leads us to
[52:00] repentance and it'll be his goodness
[52:02] that leads us all the way home
[52:05] that's right
[52:08] now i just had a few thoughts up here
[52:10] um
[52:12] and there you know i didn't have a whole
[52:13] lot of time to organize yesterday was
[52:15] more when i studied it was more of like
[52:16] a bible research day i didn't have time
[52:18] to like present it real nice format so
[52:20] you just kind of have to live with my
[52:21] notes or i can just go back so you don't
[52:23] have to look at it how about that we'll
[52:24] just go back and i'll just have it on
[52:25] here
[52:26] uh
[52:28] you know in philippians 1 verse 6 that
[52:30] says whatever god started in your life
[52:33] he's gonna finish
[52:35] as long as you let him praise god god
[52:37] will not override your free more agency
[52:40] but as long as you when you fail you say
[52:42] jesus forgive me
[52:43] try me again let me be stronger this
[52:46] time i don't want to fail again then god
[52:48] is going to finish what he started amen
[52:51] he's faithful
[52:53] but as i said as i ended the service the
[52:55] last time i just said it briefly we have
[52:57] to be careful
[52:59] that every promise of god uh that that
[53:02] we're claiming is a divine promise to us
[53:06] and it's gonna be fulfilled in its time
[53:08] in season
[53:10] so i put some examples on here you know
[53:11] when we first come in the message
[53:12] there's numerous people they don't go to
[53:13] this church you know but they said i
[53:15] claim that person as my husband or i
[53:16] claim that person as my wife right
[53:19] and they and then they could have said
[53:20] well we sing that song every promise in
[53:22] the book is mine right
[53:24] they could have said they could have
[53:25] said that now we love those people i
[53:26] would never name them or anything like
[53:28] that but
[53:30] it's an idea where we think when we want
[53:32] something we think god wants wants it
[53:34] for us as well
[53:36] and we think just because we're serving
[53:38] god we deserve this
[53:40] but god is greater than our thinking god
[53:42] god's ways are higher than our ways
[53:45] so in both cases the lord allowed those
[53:47] other people to not be interested in
[53:48] them and married other people i believe
[53:50] and and then they married people now
[53:52] they're very happy both people are very
[53:54] very happy
[53:55] and we're still in good fellowship and
[53:57] you know both of them amen
[53:59] uh and i'm not saying i've never done
[54:01] that i'm sure i've claimed something
[54:03] before or maybe it didn't come to pass
[54:04] right we've all been guilty of that but
[54:06] we've got to be careful even when we
[54:08] read that joshua scripture see some
[54:10] people might be tempted by the devil to
[54:12] say well god failed me god no when the
[54:14] god didn't fail you god was trying to
[54:16] correct you amen
[54:17] right if you wanted something and god
[54:19] didn't give it to you god was trying to
[54:21] correct you and give you something
[54:22] better praise god because his ways are
[54:25] always better than our ways amen
[54:29] like riches well i don't even i wanted
[54:31] to be more rich well how do you know
[54:32] it's god's promise to make you rich
[54:34] you don't know that
[54:36] i've had brothers you know when we first
[54:37] come in the message say i'm going to
[54:38] live to be in the rapture and they
[54:39] passed away
[54:41] they were claiming that promise was
[54:43] there think about that they said
[54:45] god gave me a revelation i remember that
[54:47] brother told me that well actually this
[54:48] brother's still alive
[54:50] he's been married twice and all these
[54:51] things you know
[54:52] uh with living spouses so he's an
[54:54] adulterer in the eyes of god but yeah he
[54:56] told me he's got the revelation he's
[54:58] going to not die to see the rapture i
[54:59] said well i said time's going to show it
[55:01] brother
[55:02] and he was a church splitter and all
[55:04] these things i mean just the fruits of
[55:06] his life were not there
[55:08] but he says he has a revelation
[55:10] we must be careful what we say is a
[55:12] revelation
[55:14] praise god how about the number of
[55:16] children rachel only had two
[55:18] right and they all were weren't they no
[55:20] that was rebecca they're all blessing
[55:22] her like you're gonna have to be a
[55:23] mother of millions and millions and they
[55:24] say that
[55:25] of course they met you know uh natural
[55:28] beyond generations right generations and
[55:30] generations
[55:32] uh
[55:33] but rachel had two yet she was with leah
[55:36] in the word of god that said those two
[55:38] built the house of israel
[55:41] praise god
[55:42] amen
[55:44] some people guarantee their healing but
[55:46] what about paul's thorn
[55:48] so we know it's not always god's promise
[55:51] to heal you when you want to be healed
[55:53] amen
[55:54] right
[55:54] even all children being saved what about
[55:56] esau
[55:58] see we have to be careful to apply the
[56:00] promise of god in other words let's not
[56:02] say god said something unless he said it
[56:04] to us
[56:06] now what does that require a lot of
[56:07] humility
[56:09] right but most times people boasting and
[56:10] saying well god told me and i'm
[56:13] they're exalting themselves
[56:15] trying to make themselves more spiritual
[56:18] right but real spirituality is honesty
[56:22] humility that's real spirituality praise
[56:25] god
[56:26] not boasting and bragging right
[56:29] so we must see god's will for every
[56:31] situation
[56:33] and remember church
[56:34] god though there is a couple promises
[56:36] god desires for everybody and that's to
[56:38] be saved and that's to be filled with
[56:40] the holy ghost amen praise god amen i'm
[56:43] just going to read it i don't have it up
[56:44] here let's go to john 7 if you got your
[56:46] bibles john 7 37.
[56:50] jesus christ in red letter words i'm
[56:52] sorry these aren't red letter
[56:54] uh it was john's words no i'm sorry yeah
[56:56] they were red letter words yeah john 7
[56:58] 37 sorry i was looking at the wrong
[57:00] piece of the page
[57:02] in the last day that great day of the
[57:04] feast jesus stood and cried saying if
[57:06] any man thirsts let him come unto me and
[57:09] drink he that believeth on me as the
[57:11] scripture has said out of his belly
[57:12] shall flow rivers of living water amen
[57:16] that ought to be exciting for all the
[57:18] young people because when you're young
[57:20] sin only comes out of our bellies right
[57:23] a child's full of days or a young child
[57:25] is born and full of days he's full of
[57:27] trouble
[57:28] hallelujah oh that ought to be exciting
[57:30] for the young people say lord jesus
[57:32] forgive me of my sins let living water
[57:35] flow out of my belly amen amen let me
[57:37] say good things let me say blessings and
[57:40] not curses amen
[57:41] i was thinking about that this morning
[57:42] for some reason the thought about
[57:43] teasing came to me i was walking in my
[57:45] bathroom
[57:46] and coming out and studying and all of a
[57:48] sudden that this thought just came to me
[57:49] about teasing
[57:51] you know when people tease when people
[57:53] tease it actually means they're the ones
[57:55] that are weak
[57:57] right because they try to make others
[57:59] feel bad because they feel bad
[58:01] right so they're the ones when they
[58:03] attack others they're the ones that are
[58:05] being attacked praise god they're the
[58:07] ones that are in bondage to a spirit
[58:11] my children how many times you heard me
[58:13] tease you about something
[58:14] lydia how many
[58:17] zero good amen hallelujah sir god's
[58:19] helping me by his grace
[58:21] and you're the oldest tube so
[58:23] but that just thought came to me this
[58:25] morning i said i need to someone said
[58:26] like tell that to the young people this
[58:27] morning
[58:28] young people should always build up each
[58:31] other
[58:32] not tear down but build up praise god
[58:36] amen
[58:36] remember when nehemiah was building the
[58:38] wall what those tobias come around to
[58:40] come around to tease them oh if a fox
[58:42] jumped on your wall it'll fall down
[58:46] friends let's not tease one another
[58:47] let's build one another up praise god
[58:50] amen
[58:51] hallelujah
[58:52] let's strengthen one another let's let's
[58:54] make a let's make the battle easier for
[58:56] them to fight amen let's come around and
[58:58] fight for them not against them amen
[59:01] amen hallelujah
[59:05] that just struck me there
[59:07] verse 39 but this fake he of the spirit
[59:09] which they that believe on him should
[59:11] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[59:13] given because that jesus was not yet
[59:15] glorified all those beautiful words if
[59:18] any man thirsts if any man wants water
[59:20] flowing out of his belly amen if any man
[59:23] wants eternal life come and drink
[59:26] any man
[59:28] hallelujah so see there are some
[59:30] promises this will not fail anyone that
[59:33] wants the holy ghost can get the holy
[59:35] ghost
[59:36] the thing is with serpent seed god knows
[59:38] by four knowledge they just don't want
[59:39] it
[59:40] right but they have the opportunity and
[59:43] they have the invitation judas just
[59:45] missed it by what was it 50 days
[59:47] i mean he barely missed it he missed it
[59:49] by less than two months
[59:51] if he would have just kept pressing on
[59:52] and believing the promise of god but we
[59:54] know he desired money and transgression
[59:57] more than obedience god help us to love
[59:59] obedience the good solid the simple word
[1:00:01] of god that will obey every command of
[1:00:04] god
[1:00:06] amen go to revelation 22.
[1:00:10] i'm not going to give you one witness
[1:00:11] i'm going to give you two witnesses
[1:00:14] because in the mouth of two or three
[1:00:15] witnesses let every word be established
[1:00:20] revelation 22.
[1:00:28] it's verse
[1:00:31] yup verse 17. sorry it took me a little
[1:00:33] while to find that
[1:00:34] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:00:36] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:00:38] let him that is a thirst come and
[1:00:39] whosoever will let him take of the water
[1:00:42] of life freely
[1:00:44] see god's word for this day is come to
[1:00:46] the fountain
[1:00:48] come to the waters come and drink
[1:00:50] they're delicious
[1:00:52] come and drink their living waters
[1:00:56] the invitation is any man
[1:00:58] who wants to drink
[1:01:00] come and drink of the water of life
[1:01:03] freely we will not keep you away from
[1:01:05] those waters we'll encourage you we'll
[1:01:07] push you to those waters amen hallelujah
[1:01:09] like brother nessa they used to pat you
[1:01:10] on the back till you got bored again
[1:01:12] they're like pushing them to the water
[1:01:14] you don't have to do that praise god but
[1:01:16] you could do that amen
[1:01:18] but the thing to do is encourage them
[1:01:19] invite them come to the water come and
[1:01:22] repent come and be filled with the holy
[1:01:24] ghost there's eternal life that will
[1:01:26] flow outside of you amen
[1:01:28] you'll see it flow out of you praise god
[1:01:32] like did i tell you when
[1:01:33] austin came the first sunday three
[1:01:35] sundays ago
[1:01:37] i picked him up and he got in the car
[1:01:38] with lena he said brother he said can
[1:01:40] you show us how to pray i looked over
[1:01:42] and i smiled at him
[1:01:45] because right before i left i felt let
[1:01:46] the lord i said i felt just about the
[1:01:48] holy spirit say teach austin how to pray
[1:01:51] so i typed out how to pray i gave the
[1:01:53] scripture and i had the two papers
[1:01:55] sitting up there on my
[1:01:56] on my dash i said hey brother how you

[1:02:02] pray
[1:02:03] i slipped over he said whoa dude he's
[1:02:05] like yeah
[1:02:06] austin's probably laughing now
[1:02:09] that was a discernment
[1:02:10] he said because they spent the whole
[1:02:12] morning talking about how to pray
[1:02:14] and he come to church that day everybody
[1:02:15] almost everybody's out with kovad
[1:02:18] and he said when i prayed for him he
[1:02:19] felt the fire of god the sanctifying
[1:02:22] fire of god start at his waist and come
[1:02:24] up through his body and then the next
[1:02:26] week when he was tested by anger he said
[1:02:28] he didn't even give in to anger he
[1:02:30] overcame anger by the sanctifying powers
[1:02:33] of the holy spirit amen hallelujah
[1:02:36] praise god amen see that's the whole
[1:02:38] that's gifts working among us amen

[1:05:51] in chapter 21.
[1:05:53] the levites remember were not given
[1:05:56] a portion like the other tribes
[1:06:02] so let me say like this all the other
[1:06:04] tribes had rivers
[1:06:07] remember uh
[1:06:09] caleb's daughter had those springs
[1:06:11] remember that
[1:06:12] she said daddy give me some springs and
[1:06:14] you know dads you're gonna give your
[1:06:15] daughter whatever she wants within
[1:06:18] reason
[1:06:21] she had springs she had fountains of
[1:06:23] water
[1:06:25] all the other tribes had mountains
[1:06:28] a seaside fishing industry
[1:06:32] oil under their feet they could get the
[1:06:34] oils they could get the oil from the
[1:06:35] olive trees everybody had
[1:06:39] great
[1:06:40] agricultural blessings except the
[1:06:43] levites
[1:06:45] all they had was a house and land for
[1:06:47] their cattle
[1:06:49] everybody else would come to church
[1:06:50] talking like oh my we drank from the
[1:06:52] spring this was a beautiful spring we
[1:06:54] put up all these new houses we went
[1:06:55] hiking up there on our hills
[1:06:57] i got 300 acres it was glorious brother
[1:07:00] jesse
[1:07:02] everybody else would come but the
[1:07:04] levites
[1:07:05] they didn't have all that
[1:07:08] they had one focus
[1:07:10] and their focus was on the house of the
[1:07:12] lord
[1:07:14] now i see a beautiful type in here
[1:07:16] because levites had very little of the
[1:07:19] world
[1:07:22] while all the other christians in the
[1:07:23] promised land
[1:07:25] holy ghostfield christians now
[1:07:27] they had lots of external blessings but
[1:07:29] the levites had very little
[1:07:32] and god ordained that praise god
[1:07:35] god ordained them to be more poor and
[1:07:37] not as rich and wealthy as the other so
[1:07:40] they could minister before the lord and
[1:07:43] minister for others
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:47] how many can understand that by god's
[1:07:48] grace
[1:07:50] i'm going to skip ahead now to this
[1:07:52] what does the bible say the most
[1:07:53] spiritual people are usually the poorest
[1:07:56] people
[1:07:58] i can only think of a handful of rich
[1:07:59] people that were spiritual abraham
[1:08:00] solomon but solomon it ruined him
[1:08:03] abraham it didn't
[1:08:05] and the bible said most rich people
[1:08:07] can't be saved jesus said a rich man can
[1:08:08] hardly pass through i have a needle
[1:08:11] right and get to heaven
[1:08:13] but look what the bible says you have
[1:08:16] now the bible james said they were
[1:08:17] respecting people that wear expensive
[1:08:20] clothing
[1:08:21] and they would give them the better
[1:08:22] seats in the church
[1:08:25] he says are you not then partial in
[1:08:27] yourselves and become judges of evil
[1:08:29] thoughts
[1:08:30] so it's an evil thought to say i'm going
[1:08:32] to treat the rich person better than the
[1:08:34] poor person and naomi and beatrice know
[1:08:36] exactly what we're talking about right
[1:08:39] because they used to go to churches that
[1:08:40] the rich people would not talk to the
[1:08:42] poor i'm so glad church that it don't
[1:08:44] matter how much you make here you're
[1:08:45] just a child of god and you're loved and
[1:08:47] we want a fellowship with you and we
[1:08:49] want to help you out by god's grace
[1:08:51] we should have all things in common
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:55] but the bible says you you obtain evil
[1:08:58] thoughts
[1:08:59] when you start treating others better
[1:09:02] because they're more rich
[1:09:04] and he uh james says in verse 5
[1:09:07] hath not god
[1:09:10] who did god choose the poor or the rich
[1:09:12] poor brother vang
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:15] has he chosen the poor of this world who
[1:09:17] are rich in faith
[1:09:19] now how come you don't hear that across
[1:09:20] pulpits
[1:09:22] because they want the people and the
[1:09:23] rich people in their church they can
[1:09:24] have bigger buildings and bigger
[1:09:25] ministries and bigger everything and
[1:09:27] bigger incomes is what they wanted
[1:09:30] how come you don't hear that preach
[1:09:31] because they're not led of the holy
[1:09:32] spirit on those topics
[1:09:34] and they got to humble themselves and be
[1:09:36] led by the holy spirit on the word of
[1:09:38] god
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] so the poor of this world so don't feel
[1:09:44] bad if you're poor don't feel bad
[1:09:46] actually be encouraged because you know
[1:09:47] you're richer in faith
[1:09:50] and god has made you an heir of the
[1:09:54] kingdom
[1:09:55] which he promised because he loves you
[1:09:58] amen
[1:09:59] hallelujah jesus said foxes have holes
[1:10:02] birds have a nest but the son of man
[1:10:04] doesn't even have a place to lay his
[1:10:05] head
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:08] so don't feel bad if you don't have a
[1:10:10] mortgage you probably you maybe don't
[1:10:11] want one
[1:10:13] let me just i can advise you on that
[1:10:15] maybe you don't want one i rushed into
[1:10:16] one that was the biggest mistake when i
[1:10:18] bought that house in chicago falls
[1:10:19] that's the biggest mistake i ever made
[1:10:21] rushed into it rush i had to get a new
[1:10:22] car you know i had to get a new i had to
[1:10:24] get a house those are some of the
[1:10:26] biggest mistakes ever made now god is
[1:10:27] merciful he works with us in our
[1:10:29] mistakes
[1:10:32] but god says the poor of this world
[1:10:35] are generally richer in faith
[1:10:38] but see even christians in the early
[1:10:40] church were despising the poor
[1:10:42] and he said well who's the one that
[1:10:43] mistreats you the rich people
[1:10:45] because they know they got lawyers that
[1:10:46] can
[1:10:47] they can sue you right
[1:10:49] they know they can call their lawyer and
[1:10:51] they'll sue you or they'll
[1:10:52] they'll do whatever they can they'll
[1:10:53] take from you whatever they can
[1:10:56] and the the bible says god chooses
[1:11:00] the poor of this world that's god's
[1:11:02] choice
[1:11:03] let's all say god's choice can we god's
[1:11:05] choice that's god's choice
[1:11:10] so see these levites were not rich by
[1:11:12] standards of the other tribes but they
[1:11:15] were rich in faith they were rich in
[1:11:17] ministry praise god
[1:11:19] some of them brother amen could walk
[1:11:21] around and they weren't saying wow look
[1:11:23] i have a new fountain they say wow the
[1:11:25] priest could say i was in the presence
[1:11:27] of the shekinah glory today amen
[1:11:30] if
[1:11:30] it's a day of atonement today i saw the
[1:11:33] savior amen
[1:11:35] i saw the holy ghost he spoke to me from
[1:11:37] off the mercy seat praise god what a
[1:11:39] blessing nobody else can say that how
[1:11:41] rich they were it was only a chosen
[1:11:43] people that could experience the
[1:11:45] presence of god amen amen
[1:11:50] so if you have little this world don't
[1:11:51] worry you have great things in the
[1:11:53] kingdom of god
[1:11:56] as long as you're rich in faith because
[1:11:57] remember brother man said penny heirs
[1:11:58] can go to hell too
[1:12:00] millionaires can go to hell penny heirs
[1:12:02] can go to hell it's all about your
[1:12:03] attitude towards it
[1:12:08] so don't feel bad if other people get
[1:12:10] riches
[1:12:11] get more possessions
[1:12:13] let's be like john wesley let's see how
[1:12:14] much you can save let's see how much you
[1:12:17] can give let's see how much what do you
[1:12:18] say save give what's the other one
[1:12:21] remember lydia okay well if you don't
[1:12:23] remember i know i'm not gonna remember
[1:12:27] like we looked at last week remember we
[1:12:28] looked at oral roberts last week look at
[1:12:30] the look at the legacy of william
[1:12:32] branham versus oral roberts now i know
[1:12:34] everybody talks about other brands
[1:12:35] that's because they don't study his
[1:12:36] messages
[1:12:38] they don't even they just say a few oh
[1:12:39] there's a few strange doctrines he must
[1:12:41] be a fault that's ridiculous
[1:12:43] they've never listened to it they've
[1:12:44] never studied it
[1:12:45] but look at the legacy brother i'm a
[1:12:47] humble uh minister has started a
[1:12:49] worldwide healing revival that's still
[1:12:51] going on today
[1:12:53] i got the book in there i got the
[1:12:54] encyclopedia it says that any any church
[1:12:56] that's basically preaching divine
[1:12:57] healing is a result of god's prophet
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:03] and look at oral roberts remember
[1:13:04] brother i was there looking at oral
[1:13:05] roberts building he said i must not be
[1:13:07] very good i must not handle money and
[1:13:09] the voice said don't feel sad
[1:13:12] i'm your portion
[1:13:14] hallelujah
[1:13:15] don't feel bad about that eight million
[1:13:17] dollar building that's not your
[1:13:19] inheritance i'm your inheritance amen
[1:13:22] and remember the brother uh got the the
[1:13:24] tongues interpretation a great portion
[1:13:27] of heaven not of earth amen
[1:13:29] not a great portion of a university amen
[1:13:32] or a great
[1:13:33] portion of a board of trustees or
[1:13:35] something like that but a great portion
[1:13:37] of heaven divine heaven blessings amen
[1:13:40] memorials in heaven awaits for a real
[1:13:42] sermon of god
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:48] and look what happened to him now he's
[1:13:49] known for being the preacher who said
[1:13:50] god's going to kill me if you don't give
[1:13:52] me 8 million
[1:13:53] and he's a preacher that raised millions
[1:13:54] of dollars to build a hospital he said
[1:13:56] god was going to use and it only lasted
[1:13:58] a few years
[1:14:00] that's what his legacy is
[1:14:03] and look church look how money so often
[1:14:06] corrupts
[1:14:07] and the church said
[1:14:09] watch out corrupts
[1:14:11] that's why i'm glad brother ray
[1:14:12] hernandez told us that word of the lord
[1:14:14] a couple years ago i was so discouraged
[1:14:16] why are we so small and he said brother
[1:14:18] on a wednesday night he said brother
[1:14:19] jesse
[1:14:20] i've got a word of the lord from you and
[1:14:21] i was like what
[1:14:23] are you sure
[1:14:24] i love you brother ray but what are you
[1:14:25] talking about here
[1:14:27] he said god told me to tell you i'm
[1:14:29] keeping you small to protect you and
[1:14:31] your family
[1:14:33] and he said as a vindication he said go
[1:14:35] talk to lydia
[1:14:37] i'm like whoa but
[1:14:39] and uh tell her
[1:14:41] or ask her if she's always wanted a
[1:14:42] youth group
[1:14:44] so i said okay brother ray
[1:14:45] you always got to be cautious with the
[1:14:46] word of the lord you know
[1:14:48] i was okay
[1:14:49] and i went and talked to him right out
[1:14:50] there and i talked to lydia in here and
[1:14:52] lydia was sitting right there and
[1:14:53] started crying
[1:14:55] brother ray said don't feel bad he said
[1:14:57] i know many young people even close to
[1:14:59] me that they're in bigger youth groups
[1:15:01] and they get mistreated by other kids in
[1:15:03] the youth group
[1:15:04] and he gave me some personal testimonies
[1:15:06] from his own experience
[1:15:08] where young people young brothers in the
[1:15:10] message were mistreating sisters and it
[1:15:12] made their lives torment
[1:15:15] in other words these these men that were
[1:15:17] in the message these young teenagers
[1:15:18] they weren't really in the message
[1:15:19] because the message wasn't in them
[1:15:22] any young man that would mistreat a
[1:15:23] young lady he's got devils
[1:15:27] he's given a place to the devil the
[1:15:29] bible said because fear had torment
[1:15:31] praise god and these brothers are
[1:15:32] causing torment in teenage girls or
[1:15:35] young ladies
[1:15:36] what is that that's a devil that's got
[1:15:38] on that man to mistreat us if we can
[1:15:40] keep getting back to that teasing thing
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:42] to mistreat them so i said i said oh
[1:15:45] thank you lord after that i said so
[1:15:46] thank you god protect me do whatever you
[1:15:48] can protect my children amen protect me
[1:15:51] and i can serve you keep my eyes focused
[1:15:53] on you and that's your mercy your hedge
[1:15:55] will be around about me praise god
[1:15:58] and that don't make me disappointed that
[1:16:00] makes me love god more praise god
[1:16:02] because god's a god of variety
[1:16:05] we can't all be the same we don't all
[1:16:06] look the same
[1:16:08] right you got different hair than i got
[1:16:09] we all got different smiles we all got
[1:16:11] different statures right some are whiter
[1:16:13] some are thinner some are taller god
[1:16:14] loves variety praise god so i want to be
[1:16:17] what god made me to be
[1:16:20] so the levites could only be what god
[1:16:22] made them to be
[1:16:24] they wouldn't they might have looked out
[1:16:25] there and say my really like one day
[1:16:28] to have some fountains
[1:16:30] oh that'd be awesome dad dad wouldn't
[1:16:32] you
[1:16:32] son
[1:16:34] darling
[1:16:36] that just wasn't it wasn't our portion
[1:16:38] anything we forsake here
[1:16:40] god will make to us over there
[1:16:42] god will make up anything that we felt
[1:16:44] like we uh we should have had
[1:16:46] god will make it up to us and don't
[1:16:48] forget son god is our portion amen god's
[1:16:52] our inheritance amen
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:16:58] i just think that's beautiful
[1:16:59] now this is a lot i'm not going to read
[1:17:01] all this but paul says godliness with
[1:17:03] contentment's great gain because we
[1:17:04] didn't bring anything into the world
[1:17:07] you didn't bring those mountains and
[1:17:08] those 300 acres into the world so you
[1:17:10] ain't taking it with you praise god
[1:17:12] right
[1:17:14] be content with closing food because the
[1:17:17] rich are often in temptations and snares
[1:17:21] very rarely do you find a rich man who
[1:17:23] can really handle the temptations of
[1:17:25] money
[1:17:26] very rarely the bible says so
[1:17:29] the bible said flee all these things
[1:17:32] and fight glory amen that's what we need
[1:17:34] today we need some joshua fighters amen
[1:17:37] that will fight off temptations and
[1:17:40] snares from the enemy are trying to
[1:17:42] steal their faith or make them depart
[1:17:44] from the faith we need fighters who
[1:17:46] handle the sword of the word we need we
[1:17:48] need runners amen who run to the cities
[1:17:50] of refuge amen
[1:17:52] when they hear satan's after them and
[1:17:54] trying to get them with temptation we
[1:17:55] need runners spiritual runners that will
[1:17:58] run to jesus christ brother and said the
[1:18:00] cities of refuge are jesus christ amen
[1:18:04] paul is saying timothy run run to the
[1:18:07] city of refuge run to your refuge run to
[1:18:09] your portion jesus christ amen amen
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow
[1:18:16] worry about itself
[1:18:21] worry about today not worry but put god
[1:18:23] first today
[1:18:24] and watch god take care of tomorrow
[1:18:28] like i told you that testimony how that
[1:18:30] company gave us a brand new kitchen last
[1:18:32] year right
[1:18:33] i talked to that the same man this week
[1:18:36] and he said since that moment where he
[1:18:38] helped us out he saved us
[1:18:40] i'm not gonna say the number of thousand
[1:18:41] dollars he saved us but it's pretty high
[1:18:45] he said since that time their business
[1:18:46] has boomed 500 percent
[1:18:50] hallelujah god knows how to do it church
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] five can you imagine i see some of your
[1:18:57] minds blowing right now
[1:19:00] what if your income went up 500 percent
[1:19:03] and i love it this man is so humble he
[1:19:04] didn't go to church but he's a humble
[1:19:05] man and he he heard the voice of god to
[1:19:08] bless our family
[1:19:09] because he know god knows i'm not a not
[1:19:11] a construction man
[1:19:13] i'm a preacher
[1:19:14] amen i i'm building a spiritual thing
[1:19:17] going on amen i'm building a spiritual
[1:19:19] house amen
[1:19:20] i could do some of that i did a little
[1:19:22] bit with my brothers and
[1:19:24] but
[1:19:24] god has a different calling for me but
[1:19:26] imagine 500 percent
[1:19:28] god blesses your business
[1:19:30] all because you honored his voice and he
[1:19:33] said he tithed
[1:19:35] on all the money god gave his company
[1:19:37] and now he's at 500 percent he said i
[1:19:38] just need people to hire because we're
[1:19:40] just bursting at the seams with all
[1:19:41] these jobs
[1:19:43] that sounds like a and god did that
[1:19:45] after three years of make that three
[1:19:46] years they made no money the fourth year
[1:19:48] they helped us there's four's
[1:19:49] deliverance there it is amen hallelujah
[1:19:52] now they're going to their fifth with
[1:19:53] 500 percent bigger than they were
[1:19:55] church god knows how to bless you amen
[1:19:58] those goodness those those blessings are
[1:20:00] running after me church
[1:20:02] they're running after you just always
[1:20:04] put god first amen make god your portion
[1:20:07] seek god and everything else will be
[1:20:09] added unto you praise god
[1:20:11] don't worry if you're just rich or poor
[1:20:13] in this world you'll be rich in faith
[1:20:15] hallelujah
[1:20:16] amen don't let riches fool you
[1:20:21] they almost always fool all these
[1:20:22] message believers thinking money is the
[1:20:24] answer money is not he says it right
[1:20:26] there
[1:20:27] anyone that says gain is godliness just
[1:20:29] because you get more money or a bigger
[1:20:30] church or something the bi that doesn't
[1:20:32] mean you're more godly
[1:20:34] what's more godly is running from
[1:20:36] temptation amen
[1:20:38] now some can handle it right some can
[1:20:40] handle like abraham he can handle the
[1:20:42] money
[1:20:43] that's because he was a friend of
[1:20:44] god amen see rich people usually make
[1:20:48] money their friend or the lawyers their
[1:20:50] friends
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] more than god being their friend
[1:20:56] i'll move
[1:20:58] on now let's uh look at a little bit of
[1:21:01] chapter 22.
[1:21:04] get your bibles here let's do a few uh
[1:21:07] verses in here i still got about
[1:21:10] i still got a few minutes there
[1:21:13] joshua 22. let's go to verse 4.
[1:21:17] the beginning of this chapter churches
[1:21:19] is joshua
[1:21:22] uh
[1:21:23] encouraging the two and a half tribes on
[1:21:26] the east of jordan
[1:21:29] and i just want to pull out a few
[1:21:30] scriptures just to encourage you
[1:21:33] remember this is after 31 years can you
[1:21:35] imagine that 31 years of being a holy
[1:21:37] ghost-filled saint
[1:21:38] fighting every battle brother bang all
[1:21:40] the battles that come the financial ones
[1:21:42] the pride ones the lust of the eyes the
[1:21:44] lust of the flesh all these 31 years of
[1:21:47] battling
[1:21:48] and you get to the end and here's what
[1:21:51] joshua tells them praise god verse 4 and
[1:21:54] now the lord your god hath given rest
[1:21:56] unto your brethren as he has promised
[1:21:58] them therefore now return ye and get you
[1:22:01] unto your tents and unto the land of
[1:22:03] your possession which moses the servant
[1:22:05] of the lord gave you on the other side
[1:22:07] of jordan
[1:22:10] so god gave them rest
[1:22:12] they had to fight and labor for 31 years
[1:22:14] at least joshua did
[1:22:18] and after 31 years they can calm down
[1:22:20] and say thank you lord for the rest that
[1:22:22] i'm
[1:22:22] enjoying
[1:22:24] let's not be discouraged if we feel like
[1:22:26] we're in battles let's not be
[1:22:27] discouraged some battles last longer
[1:22:29] than others
[1:22:31] some battles will last years
[1:22:33] some will last decades
[1:22:36] but the thing to do is keep fighting
[1:22:38] keep battling keep taking possession
[1:22:40] don't give up don't quit because god is
[1:22:43] with you and god wants you to possess
[1:22:44] something
[1:22:47] maybe it's your bad habits or maybe it's
[1:22:48] your maybe maybe it's a temper right
[1:22:51] maybe it's a lust of the flesh lust of
[1:22:53] the eyes
[1:22:54] god wants you to possess that channel
[1:22:56] amen amen
[1:22:58] i want you to possess that gate so the
[1:23:00] devil can't get in and the devil's kept
[1:23:03] out praise god
[1:23:05] god's anointing is kept in and satan's
[1:23:07] kept out
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:10] now remember church the bible said god
[1:23:12] gave the saints rest in acts 9 31 after
[1:23:15] paul got converted
[1:23:17] see god has a way to do it some of those
[1:23:19] people that are against you let them get
[1:23:20] converted amen
[1:23:22] hallelujah then you're going to rest
[1:23:23] that's what happened with cam right
[1:23:25] cam tormented us well i shouldn't say
[1:23:26] torment we came he's talked about
[1:23:28] himself here you know
[1:23:30] he was just against us argue with us for
[1:23:31] a whole
[1:23:32] year and then god brought him in and
[1:23:35] then we had rest for a while
[1:23:38] hallelujah
[1:23:40] and that's a beautiful testimony that
[1:23:41] god brought him in
[1:23:43] it's beautiful
[1:23:44] because i can say it like this i thought
[1:23:46] in other words i fought holiness for all
[1:23:47] those years of my life too
[1:23:49] i was fighting i remember i used to make
[1:23:50] fun of christians in high school shame
[1:23:52] on me for that and i went back and
[1:23:53] apologized after i got saved
[1:23:56] and now one of them is a homosexual i'm
[1:23:57] encouraging i totally get out of that
[1:23:59] we still text from time to time
[1:24:01] i made fun of him but i apologize i said
[1:24:03] now i'm on jesus side amen
[1:24:06] god had mercy on me even down in egypt
[1:24:09] god had mercy on me praise god
[1:24:11] but see god has seasons for our rest and
[1:24:14] remember the main rest is in your soul
[1:24:17] jesus said come unto me all ye that
[1:24:18] labor and are weary heavy laden i'll
[1:24:21] give you rest unto your soul
[1:24:23] but the bible says in hebrews 4 10 11
[1:24:25] labor to enter into that
[1:24:29] labor rest
[1:24:29] other words give all your diligence give
[1:24:32] all your strength give all your
[1:24:33] attention amen
[1:24:36] put away any distraction that's not the
[1:24:38] word of god and focus on the word of god
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:44] i encourage all of our young people to
[1:24:46] do that praise god
[1:24:47] as they get closer to the baptism holy
[1:24:49] ghost they're going to see more and more
[1:24:50] fall away
[1:24:52] because the bible said god gives the
[1:24:53] holy ghost to them that obey him in acts
[1:24:55] 5 32. that's not old testament that's
[1:24:57] new testament
[1:24:59] god wants a person cleaned out
[1:25:01] so he can fill them and use them praise
[1:25:04] god
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:06] look at verse 5
[1:25:10] okay he says but take diligent heed to
[1:25:12] do the commandment of the law
[1:25:14] which moses is serving the lord your god
[1:25:16] uh to to love the lord your god to walk
[1:25:18] in all of his ways and to keep his
[1:25:19] commandments and cleave unto him and to
[1:25:21] serve him with all your heart and with
[1:25:23] all your soul
[1:25:26] there are one two three four five six
[1:25:28] seven times paul and peter tell us to be
[1:25:32] diligent christians
[1:25:34] and that's a message a lot of message
[1:25:36] churches don't like because a lot of
[1:25:38] them are lazy a lot of them don't pray a
[1:25:41] lot of them are overweight a lot of them
[1:25:43] are disinterested in praying for the
[1:25:44] government or disinterested in anything
[1:25:48] anything that caused them to do
[1:25:49] something other than go to church
[1:25:51] they're against it
[1:25:52] that's because they're lazy that's
[1:25:54] because they're lukewarm praise god you
[1:25:56] have to tell me you have to say man
[1:25:58] because i've seen it i've talked to them
[1:26:00] where they say i won't fast i couldn't
[1:26:02] fast and then they got diabetes later
[1:26:05] well what happened they weren't diligent
[1:26:07] with the word of god they made food
[1:26:09] they made their belly their god instead
[1:26:11] of god
[1:26:13] amen i know i remember i preached a few
[1:26:14] weeks ago
[1:26:16] the bible said their god was their belly
[1:26:19] you know we could use some rebukes and
[1:26:20] criticism in the word of god can we
[1:26:23] god said the bible said in hebrews 12
[1:26:25] every son that comes to god must be
[1:26:28] chastened amen
[1:26:30] and the reason i'm preaching is because
[1:26:31] god had the chase of me on it
[1:26:33] i'm not free from chastisement none of
[1:26:35] us are free from chastisement we've all
[1:26:37] got to be chastened if we're sons and
[1:26:40] daughters god brings us all the same way
[1:26:42] amen amen
[1:26:45] he says in romans 12 8 2 corinthians 8 7
[1:26:48] 2 timothy 4 9 2 timothy 4 21 hebrews 6
[1:26:51] 11 2 peter 1 5 and 2 peter 1 10.
[1:26:55] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:26:58] virtue and to virtue knowledge amen can
[1:27:02] i say it like this give all diligence
[1:27:04] church and add the anointing of god to
[1:27:07] 2022 amen
[1:27:09] glory you might have been anointed for
[1:27:11] 2021 but let me tell you you can't live
[1:27:14] off of that you need more anointing amen
[1:27:18] in other words what i mean is you need a
[1:27:19] renewed mind every single day because
[1:27:22] the end the trials get harder the enemy
[1:27:25] keeps coming in and you need to raise a
[1:27:27] standard and say i'm not going to bow to
[1:27:28] this i'm going to fight this let's go
[1:27:31] fight in the name of jesus amen
[1:27:34] hallelujah add to it be diligent pray
[1:27:37] read your bible give alms amen be a real
[1:27:40] sincere christian and god will bless you
[1:27:48] what's his word to these guys diligence
[1:27:52] diligence and love there it is right
[1:27:53] there
[1:27:54] amen paul said faith works by
[1:27:59] so now the faith works debate is now
[1:28:01] solved church
[1:28:03] it's all by one scripture galatians 5 6.
[1:28:05] in that austin we could solve that that
[1:28:07] whole debate to this morning isn't that
[1:28:08] great we could solve that
[1:28:10] faith works by love in other words the
[1:28:14] order is love
[1:28:16] faith works if we take that approach to
[1:28:19] god we're going to do god's works
[1:28:22] because they're all based upon love
[1:28:24] you've got to start with love and joshua
[1:28:27] the holy ghost amen the holy ghost said
[1:28:30] be diligent and love god with all you
[1:28:32] have amen
[1:28:34] oh glory
[1:28:35] i know usually i get louder as i preach
[1:28:37] and everybody else gets quieter you know
[1:28:39] because i start off real quite humble
[1:28:41] then i get really and you guys start
[1:28:42] real loud and we get quiet
[1:28:44] we're kind of opposites that completes
[1:28:45] us right there as a body of believers
[1:28:48] hallelujah so i'm trying to bring this
[1:28:50] down here
[1:28:51] give me about 15 minutes here let me set
[1:28:52] timer
[1:28:58] now
[1:28:59] beginning in verse
[1:29:01] actually yeah well i'm sorry in verse 8
[1:29:04] joshua says god has blessed you with
[1:29:06] money and clothes and houses and lands
[1:29:08] so he said be diligent and love god with
[1:29:10] all your hearts
[1:29:12] how many can say lord i love you thank
[1:29:14] you for blessing me with the job i have
[1:29:16] the cars the land the the home how many
[1:29:19] could say amen to that amen that's what
[1:29:21] i want to say
[1:29:23] so i feel like joshua the holy ghost is
[1:29:24] talking me today
[1:29:26] jesse be thankful but be diligent to
[1:29:28] always love the lord your god
[1:29:31] with all your heart soul mind and
[1:29:32] strength for by this love you'll
[1:29:34] overcome
[1:29:36] hallelujah now the rest of the chapter
[1:29:39] verse 10 all the way down to the end
[1:29:41] deals with this strange situation
[1:29:46] where these two and a half tribes go
[1:29:47] back to their land and the first thing
[1:29:49] they do is build up an altar the bible
[1:29:51] said it's a massive altar
[1:29:55] and word gets back to the other tribes
[1:29:57] and the nine and a half tribes on the
[1:29:59] other side
[1:30:00] these guys have
[1:30:02] built an altar
[1:30:04] look at verse 11.
[1:30:06] joshua 22 11.
[1:30:09] and the children of israel heard say
[1:30:10] behold the children of reuben and
[1:30:11] children of god and the half tribe of
[1:30:12] manasseh have built an altar over
[1:30:14] against the land of canaan and their
[1:30:15] borders of jordan at the passage of the
[1:30:17] children of israel and when the children
[1:30:18] of israel heard it
[1:30:22] the whole congregation of children of
[1:30:23] israel gathered themselves together at
[1:30:25] shiloh to go up to war against them now
[1:30:28] some people might criticize this but i
[1:30:30] like this
[1:30:31] i don't know about you i like this idea
[1:30:36] how you hear about your brethren
[1:30:38] building an altar and they didn't tell
[1:30:40] you about it and they weren't
[1:30:41] commissioned by god to do it
[1:30:44] and so they said if my brother is in
[1:30:46] idolatry
[1:30:47] let's go fight that devil
[1:30:49] and notice i didn't say fight that
[1:30:51] brother and the church said
[1:30:53] amen i'd say fight the brother i said
[1:30:55] let's go try to correct that brother
[1:30:59] they built this altar in their life i
[1:31:02] like that when they see sin they want to
[1:31:04] take care of it
[1:31:06] praise god god help us amen
[1:31:08] to take care of sins we see
[1:31:11] amongst one another
[1:31:12] to pray for them right and go to them if
[1:31:14] you have questions or concerns
[1:31:16] about our lives
[1:31:18] it'd be better than gossiping
[1:31:20] right
[1:31:22] it'd be better than ignoring it
[1:31:24] right church
[1:31:26] the best thing to do is pray about it
[1:31:28] and then go to the person like brother
[1:31:30] man i said the pastor doesn't always
[1:31:31] have to do those kind of things
[1:31:33] the bible says spiritual people can go
[1:31:36] to someone who sinned and tried to bring
[1:31:37] correction to them but they got to
[1:31:39] remain humble
[1:31:42] they got to be meek so the bible says
[1:31:43] the spirit that's on the center or the
[1:31:45] backside or won't come on the person
[1:31:46] who's going to do the correction
[1:31:50] so they come in verse 16 we don't have
[1:31:52] time to read at all but they say what is
[1:31:53] this rebellion and can you imagine there
[1:31:55] they got all these armies behind them
[1:31:56] but they got all the armies of the nine
[1:31:58] half tribes ready to fight
[1:32:00] what is this rebellion why are you
[1:32:01] building altars that was not sanctioned
[1:32:03] by god
[1:32:06] they said what trash is this in verse 16
[1:32:09] what rebellion is this
[1:32:11] and in verse 19 they say if if that side
[1:32:13] is so unclean and you're already into
[1:32:14] idolatry why don't you come over the
[1:32:16] jordan that's what i say praise god why
[1:32:18] aren't those foolish virgins that set up
[1:32:20] idols why don't they come over and get
[1:32:21] the baptism of the holy ghost amen once
[1:32:23] they leave their denomination brother
[1:32:25] bang we beg them for years once they
[1:32:26] leave their denomination and come to the
[1:32:28] real baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:32:30] gives you a love for holiness gives you
[1:32:31] a holy man's taste
[1:32:34] glory
[1:32:36] well all you do is keep begging and
[1:32:37] praise god all you do is keep asking all
[1:32:39] we can do is keep offering it praise god
[1:32:42] in verse 20 they say don't you remember
[1:32:44] aiken did this
[1:32:46] aiken didn't build an altar church
[1:32:48] how did achan build this well aiken did
[1:32:51] a similar sin
[1:32:53] ache and looked and saw the wedge the
[1:32:55] gold and the garments and he said i'm
[1:32:57] going to take that into my house i'm
[1:32:59] going to bury that in my house
[1:33:02] so we get this truth that no matter
[1:33:04] whether you build a big public altar of
[1:33:07] defiance
[1:33:08] or if you bury sin in your life and it's
[1:33:10] secret sin god still sees it i said god
[1:33:14] still sees it amen
[1:33:16] god still sees it
[1:33:19] whether it's some big public shame on
[1:33:21] facebook or instagram or whatever you're
[1:33:23] on
[1:33:25] or some private sin god sees it and it
[1:33:28] will hinder the church of the living god
[1:33:31] that's right
[1:33:32] so the suggestion is don't let sin in
[1:33:34] your life don't do secret sin and don't
[1:33:36] do public sin
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:39] hallelujah praise god
[1:33:41] aiken is the example don't be like aiken
[1:33:44] how could you be like aiken
[1:33:46] we're going to be destro you're going to
[1:33:47] be destroyed
[1:33:50] well i'm not sure if you know this part
[1:33:51] of the story
[1:33:52] but in verse 24 the other side that
[1:33:55] built the altar
[1:33:56] starts explaining why they built it
[1:34:00] and the purpose was not to get into
[1:34:02] idolatry
[1:34:04] the purpose was to have a witness
[1:34:07] that they had a part with god
[1:34:10] because they said in the years to come
[1:34:12] when all this generation dies away the
[1:34:14] children on the west of jordan will say
[1:34:16] well you're not a part of us because
[1:34:18] jordan is the boundary
[1:34:20] and so we want to witness on our side
[1:34:23] that shows that we have a portion with
[1:34:25] god almighty
[1:34:28] and you know the story you know if
[1:34:29] you're not i'll tell you
[1:34:32] they said in verse 27 this altar is a
[1:34:34] witness that we have a part
[1:34:37] or a portion of the lord
[1:34:40] and then verse 29 they say god forbid
[1:34:43] that we should rebel
[1:34:46] against the lord god of our fathers who
[1:34:48] brought us out of egypt
[1:34:51] look at their honest words
[1:34:54] this is so different from achan akin
[1:34:56] said i saw them and i wanted them
[1:35:00] so now we see this altar wasn't an evil
[1:35:02] thing although it looked like one right
[1:35:05] really looked like one
[1:35:09] and their testimony was different than
[1:35:11] against testimony aiken admitted i love
[1:35:13] sin i hid it in my house
[1:35:16] but their testimony was we just want a
[1:35:18] witness that shows we're a part of you
[1:35:21] when generations come we want to stay a
[1:35:23] part of you but we want to witness that
[1:35:25] even on this side we have a part with
[1:35:27] god amen
[1:35:28] that just reminds me of the foolish
[1:35:30] virgin they they will have a part with
[1:35:31] god amen
[1:35:33] they won't live in the city but they'll
[1:35:35] live outside the city praise god they
[1:35:36] have a part with god and god's not going
[1:35:39] to forget about them praise god
[1:35:42] but look they had honest words now look
[1:35:44] at church this is what we find when we
[1:35:46] feel like someone's in the wrong we need
[1:35:49] to approach them with love
[1:35:52] the bible says
[1:35:53] those that are spiritual
[1:35:55] in james chapter 3 i believe it is
[1:35:57] correct those who are in mistake or
[1:35:59] those are in heir
[1:36:02] but you got to go into it ready to fight
[1:36:05] i'll never forget when that man uh he
[1:36:07] lived around here
[1:36:08] he called me up and said can i meet you
[1:36:10] at subway on saturday i said yes sir and
[1:36:11] i knew it was going to be war brother
[1:36:13] brother amen i just knew it was going to
[1:36:14] be war so i went there praying and
[1:36:16] fasting he started off and saying well
[1:36:18] all this and then pretty soon his voice
[1:36:20] got louder right in the middle of subway
[1:36:21] and people looking over at us like
[1:36:22] what's going on
[1:36:25] and he's crying and he's saying how
[1:36:27] could you have a youtube ministry don't
[1:36:28] you know all the evil on the internet
[1:36:30] and i just let him go for like five
[1:36:32] minutes all these people are crying i
[1:36:33] just felt the holy spirit and just me
[1:36:35] say wait wait i knew it was war now
[1:36:37] church i could have lashed out at him
[1:36:38] really good
[1:36:39] but the holy spirit gave me the spirit
[1:36:42] of humility
[1:36:44] and i said brother these videos i made
[1:36:47] this youtube ministry i've made
[1:36:49] is winning souls
[1:36:51] i had a woman email me a few years ago
[1:36:52] said you've saved my soul through that
[1:36:54] water baptism video
[1:36:56] we just got that video from the guy who
[1:36:58] was about the minister's marriage
[1:36:59] requirements
[1:37:00] that minister he said when i listened to
[1:37:02] your video it brought me out of bondage
[1:37:04] he said now i'm set free praise god
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:08] and i said i did it so my family members
[1:37:10] if they wouldn't come to our church
[1:37:12] would listen to it and i've had that
[1:37:14] i've had family members text me and tell
[1:37:15] me
[1:37:16] that we did we listened to your videos
[1:37:18] and they were a blessing i don't know
[1:37:20] where they're going to end up with god
[1:37:22] but i said it's the same thing brother
[1:37:24] branham did
[1:37:26] it's the same thing brother neville did
[1:37:28] right
[1:37:29] and by the end
[1:37:31] he was all sobered up
[1:37:33] and i think
[1:37:34] his main concern was on youtube they put
[1:37:36] evil videos on the side but that's only
[1:37:39] if you're looking at him
[1:37:41] if you only click on good things church
[1:37:43] god is my witness i only click on good
[1:37:45] things on youtube those evil things
[1:37:46] don't come up on my feed
[1:37:49] i don't know what kind of algorithm you
[1:37:50] got going on but that tells me either
[1:37:52] you or your children are looking at the
[1:37:53] wrong things
[1:37:56] is that right
[1:37:58] and by the end i was war brother amen
[1:38:00] but by the end i come out of victor
[1:38:02] praise god i said show me where i'm
[1:38:04] wrong he said no he said okay i can see
[1:38:05] i respect that
[1:38:08] yeah i came to fight praise god but you
[1:38:09] got to fight with love amen
[1:38:12] fight with love
[1:38:15] so see the words the honest words will
[1:38:17] always say which side they're on
[1:38:19] in this case these men were set free
[1:38:22] because they're honest words we're not
[1:38:23] here to make an idol
[1:38:25] but church look how close
[1:38:28] right from wrong sometimes is
[1:38:32] look how close they build an altar and
[1:38:34] these men were ready to destroy them
[1:38:37] because there's only one altar
[1:38:39] there's only one savior that's jesus
[1:38:42] christ
[1:38:44] but god allowed it
[1:38:47] and god had mercy because there was
[1:38:48] going to be a need for it in future
[1:38:50] generations
[1:38:52] well we know they talk about it in verse
[1:38:54] 31 unity is restored
[1:38:56] but some things can be so close to evil
[1:39:00] and it all depends on your attitude
[1:39:05] right
[1:39:06] in romans 14 16 the bible said let not
[1:39:09] your good be evil spoken of
[1:39:13] so in context that's about meat
[1:39:16] paul was telling them some christians
[1:39:17] can eat meat and some can't because of
[1:39:20] their association with idols
[1:39:23] paul said if you're stumbling somebody
[1:39:25] don't eat meat but he also said
[1:39:27] let not
[1:39:29] your good be evil spoken of
[1:39:31] in other words stand up for your meat
[1:39:32] and say this ain't this ain't a struggle
[1:39:34] for me
[1:39:36] this ain't a battle for me
[1:39:38] praise god
[1:39:41] what about christmas oh that's some
[1:39:43] that's a good debate right there
[1:39:49] it can be so close
[1:39:52] right but it can be so far away
[1:39:56] right
[1:39:58] if brother braham said merry christmas
[1:39:59] what's wrong with saying merry christmas
[1:40:02] he was a holy ghost-filled man
[1:40:04] praise god if he put up a tree for
[1:40:06] joseph why can't somebody else put up a
[1:40:07] tree
[1:40:09] now me i just can't do it because of how
[1:40:11] i was raised
[1:40:13] right i just can't do that but if
[1:40:15] somebody can do that and still love
[1:40:16] jesus christ well then they're just like
[1:40:17] brother branham
[1:40:19] and the church said
[1:40:21] you think god will let brother brown do
[1:40:22] that
[1:40:23] all those years
[1:40:25] and let him do that sin i doubt it i
[1:40:27] highly doubt it
[1:40:28] and the scripture is in colossians 2
[1:40:31] the bible said one man concerns one holy
[1:40:34] day above another and the bible said let
[1:40:36] him let him be holy to him it's holy to
[1:40:37] other people it ain't
[1:40:39] but the bible said let them do it
[1:40:42] he said be fully persuaded in your own
[1:40:43] mind
[1:40:45] church see that's the thing just make it
[1:40:46] a holy day
[1:40:48] if they're going to put up a tree though
[1:40:49] and watch the football game on christmas
[1:40:51] then they're in sin
[1:40:53] because they just gave three hours to
[1:40:54] the world and didn't even pray take two
[1:40:56] minutes
[1:40:58] see
[1:41:00] it's
[1:41:00] it's worldiness that's sin addiction
[1:41:04] they're you can't say their minds are
[1:41:06] transformed by the word of god when they
[1:41:08] just get programmed by nbc or whatever
[1:41:10] it is a fox news or fox sports for three
[1:41:13] hours and you say your mind's
[1:41:14] transformed impossible
[1:41:16] impossible
[1:41:20] what about hoffman's head i get comments
[1:41:21] on this all the time well i liked your
[1:41:23] sermon except the idolatry you have in
[1:41:25] your church my brother
[1:41:27] enough of that
[1:41:28] now i just delete them because i'm tired
[1:41:30] it's the same guy over and over i said
[1:41:32] the same guy that said no idols is the
[1:41:34] one he said put up those two cherubims
[1:41:36] right by my presence
[1:41:38] i said it's just a reminder
[1:41:41] it's just a reminder about jesus christ
[1:41:44] and how humble he was it's simply a
[1:41:46] reminder what's wrong with that and you
[1:41:48] know they can bring those scriptures for
[1:41:49] it
[1:41:50] but see then we see other people on
[1:41:52] facebook that worship brother brown's
[1:41:53] picture
[1:41:54] they actually bow down and worship
[1:41:56] brother graham's pillar of fire picture
[1:41:57] now that's idolatry so see it can be so
[1:41:59] close
[1:42:00] just like this altar can be so close
[1:42:05] using wine
[1:42:07] costly jewelry
[1:42:09] the bible said you can't have costly
[1:42:10] jewelry but
[1:42:12] how much does that mean well you need
[1:42:13] the wisdom of god to know
[1:42:16] right
[1:42:19] that's what we need we need uh humility
[1:42:21] if we're concerned about someone like
[1:42:23] this book of joshua we need to go to
[1:42:24] them with humility
[1:42:26] and then be able to receive it if they
[1:42:28] have the right testimony
[1:42:31] because a tree will always be known by
[1:42:33] its fruit
[1:42:35] eventually each person is going to end
[1:42:37] up at their uh their destination
[1:42:40] the bible calls it their perfection
[1:42:41] either going to be perfected by the five
[1:42:43] full ministry or can be perfected by the
[1:42:45] devil right tossed about with every wind
[1:42:47] of doctrine
[1:42:48] either one of the other
[1:42:50] right you're going to come to your
[1:42:51] fruition or your protection
[1:42:53] or i'm sorry perfection rather
[1:42:54] completion let me close with this i'm
[1:42:56] closing give me five minutes here i'm
[1:42:57] set a timer five give me give me five
[1:42:59] minutes
[1:43:00] my next video out is about how brother
[1:43:02] brand was so open to correction
[1:43:05] how many know he was open to correction
[1:43:08] i've had so many people tell me who are
[1:43:10] you to correct god's prophet and i said
[1:43:11] i'm saying this on the video since i
[1:43:13] can't talk to them all i said who are
[1:43:15] you to exalt every opinion of his to
[1:43:17] infallible and unquestionable
[1:43:19] because now you've just made him equal
[1:43:20] to jesus christ
[1:43:22] i said who are you to be so lazy not to
[1:43:25] search out the bible and see what the
[1:43:26] bible says about it
[1:43:28] because the bible says you're supposed
[1:43:29] to labor in the word of god
[1:43:32] they always say that these preachers say
[1:43:34] that who are you to correct god's
[1:43:36] prophet when they're trying to bring
[1:43:37] more authority to their preaching but
[1:43:39] they don't having studied it out haven't
[1:43:40] looked in the bible they've just
[1:43:42] listened to a sermon listening to a
[1:43:43] quote and they're trying to get
[1:43:45] authority to it
[1:43:46] but they haven't looked in the bible and
[1:43:48] they're wrong
[1:43:49] amen praise god hallelujah so brother
[1:43:52] baby said the holy ghost corrected him
[1:43:54] on the first seal brother braham said my
[1:43:56] wife she's my correction and the church
[1:43:58] said oh i'm sorry and the brother said
[1:44:00] amen amen amen amen
[1:44:04] now she's not to do it with the word
[1:44:05] she's to do it by her chase conversation
[1:44:08] first peter three verse one the woman
[1:44:11] doesn't go preach at the man but she
[1:44:12] lives such a godly life
[1:44:15] and she can even be like sister meda
[1:44:16] where midas said was that exactly right
[1:44:18] brother bill when you lied to the irs
[1:44:21] she wasn't preaching at him
[1:44:23] she was asking him a humble question
[1:44:25] and he had to come back and apologize
[1:44:27] say i'm sorry i called you to lie
[1:44:30] brother branham was corrected by a man
[1:44:32] named brother sherrod the man said i
[1:44:34] hate to correct you on anything brother
[1:44:35] brandon but you're mistaken
[1:44:37] he said you've caused those people by
[1:44:39] not receiving their presence you caused
[1:44:41] them to lose their reward
[1:44:43] and brother bam said he corrected me
[1:44:46] oh i thought you can't correct god's
[1:44:47] prophet on anything you just can't
[1:44:49] correct him that's a lie
[1:44:51] that's a lie that's a that's a spirit of
[1:44:53] idolatry
[1:44:57] so church remember anytime somebody
[1:44:58] somebody gives you a gift as long as
[1:44:59] it's from god you accept it now if it's
[1:45:01] the devil if it's a box of rattlesnakes
[1:45:02] you cast it down
[1:45:04] don't take that that's a false gift amen
[1:45:06] don't take a sickness or disease but you
[1:45:08] take a gift god's gonna bless them amen
[1:45:11] brother brahm let him uh brother brahm
[1:45:13] let a brother correct him in questions
[1:45:15] and answers 1961 in a bunch of ministers
[1:45:19] brother abraham said now the star does
[1:45:20] not reflect its own light the star
[1:45:22] reflects the light of the sun is that
[1:45:24] right this is what he said he said a
[1:45:26] star reflects the sun's light and the
[1:45:28] brother said no
[1:45:29] brother i said huh
[1:45:30] he said in a sense the moon reflects the
[1:45:33] light
[1:45:36] the stars shine their own light and
[1:45:38] brother branham said
[1:45:40] yeah yeah yeah he said that's right
[1:45:43] brother brown let a preacher correct him
[1:45:45] right in the middle of a sermon
[1:45:48] that's how humble brother adam was
[1:45:51] praise god
[1:45:52] oh but you you can't disagree with
[1:45:54] anything the prophet said
[1:45:55] he's
[1:45:56] infallible it's a lie
[1:46:00] he accepted all kinds of correction
[1:46:04] brother brahm said if any time you see
[1:46:06] me get away from the scripture he said
[1:46:08] if i'm wrong i don't care if you're one
[1:46:09] of the trustees like vang or if you're
[1:46:11] the janitor
[1:46:14] whoever you are your duty bound to me as
[1:46:16] a brother in christ to tell me where i'm
[1:46:18] wrong scripturally he said let's sit
[1:46:21] down and solve it out together and the
[1:46:22] church said
[1:46:24] i don't care who you are in the church
[1:46:27] if i'm wrong and i need corrected bring
[1:46:29] it to me with the right spirit
[1:46:31] and we'll sit down and talk to that
[1:46:34] brother the rams said a baptist minister
[1:46:36] came to correct him he said i like to
[1:46:37] straighten you out on the godhead
[1:46:38] sometime when you got time he said i got
[1:46:40] time right now
[1:46:43] he said because i want to be straight we
[1:46:44] lay aside everything else to be right
[1:46:48] a lutheran dean tried to correct brother
[1:46:50] branham but he was wrong but brother
[1:46:51] brahm even said i said i love you
[1:46:53] because you're interested enough in our
[1:46:55] lord jesus to try to correct me
[1:46:58] what is it about people that don't like
[1:47:00] to be corrected it's pride
[1:47:02] because brother madam said the love of
[1:47:04] god moved a lutheran dean to try to
[1:47:06] bring correction to him god loves
[1:47:08] correction amen
[1:47:11] god don't want us to continue in our
[1:47:12] false ideas and our opinions that are
[1:47:14] wrong god wants to correct us how else
[1:47:16] can he guide us into all truth if we
[1:47:18] don't accept correction
[1:47:21] see it's love when you go to correct
[1:47:23] someone
[1:47:25] that's how brother branham saw it the
[1:47:28] bible says in proverbs 9 verse 8
[1:47:29] remember wednesday i preached on that
[1:47:30] brother who had
[1:47:32] i sent him a letter i called him on the
[1:47:33] phone i said you preached 24 false
[1:47:35] doctrines
[1:47:36] and i wrote in the letter i said i'm
[1:47:38] correcting you because i love you
[1:47:40] proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not a
[1:47:42] scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise
[1:47:45] man
[1:47:46] and he will love thee
[1:47:51] brother branham was corrected by a woman
[1:47:52] in a prayer line when he misspoke her
[1:47:54] last name
[1:47:57] he says uh
[1:47:59] would it make you believe me more it
[1:48:00] would mrs strong and the sister says mrs
[1:48:03] stout
[1:48:04] he said would you believe go and believe
[1:48:07] it's all over
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] let's stand to our feet
[1:48:13] brother branham said i want trustees in
[1:48:15] my church who are not puppets now think
[1:48:17] of how many puppets we got in the
[1:48:18] message
[1:48:22] the irs told brother brandon you got a
[1:48:23] bunch of puppets in your church and look
[1:48:25] what he said to the irs
[1:48:26] he said why your trustees are nothing
[1:48:28] but puppets i said if i had a trustee on
[1:48:30] the board that had a different idea and
[1:48:32] wouldn't stand up for it i don't care
[1:48:34] who
[1:48:35] is speaking about it would express his
[1:48:36] own views on it i'd throw him off the
[1:48:38] board
[1:48:39] and look at that
[1:48:42] brother said if i knew i had a man who
[1:48:43] was a yes man on the board i'd throw him
[1:48:45] off
[1:48:47] because then he can't help me
[1:48:50] all he does is say just okay brother
[1:48:51] okay brother bram okay brother bam
[1:48:54] and he has no differing opinions of his
[1:48:56] own
[1:48:59] he says though is contrary to my belief
[1:49:01] i want him to express what he thinks is
[1:49:03] right that's what i got him there for
[1:49:06] see what he says about it
[1:49:09] but we have that
[1:49:12] i could go on and on and on
[1:49:15] but musicians that's close
[1:49:19] church this was a little different
[1:49:20] message how many appreciate the message
[1:49:22] today
[1:49:23] you see in joshua
[1:49:27] where brethren are going to come to
[1:49:28] spots of dif differing opinions
[1:49:31] and the way to approach is by the holy
[1:49:33] spirit you go there knowing war is going
[1:49:35] to take place but you go in the spirit
[1:49:37] of humility
[1:49:39] you give the person a chance to say
[1:49:41] their side
[1:49:43] and you see if the holy spirit will give
[1:49:44] you a witness on your side
[1:49:47] in this case the holy spirit gave the
[1:49:49] nine and a half tribes a witness this is
[1:49:51] okay
[1:49:52] and we're going to leave here we're
[1:49:53] going to be happy rejoicing and church
[1:49:55] did you catch that these are battles
[1:49:57] within the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:49:59] hello
[1:50:00] these are battles in message churches
[1:50:06] where it looks so close someone looks
[1:50:08] like they're so close to wrong but in
[1:50:10] humility you got to go to them
[1:50:13] and say is this is it why are you doing
[1:50:14] this can you can you i like those words
[1:50:16] brother samuel taught me can you help me
[1:50:18] understand those before beautiful words
[1:50:20] can you i'm sorry five words can you
[1:50:22] help me understand i gotta learn how to
[1:50:23] count again
[1:50:25] can you help me understand
[1:50:29] and this is what mature christians do
[1:50:33] they rightly divide the word of truth
[1:50:36] they seek god for discernment about
[1:50:38] disagreements
[1:50:40] because they want to diligently love god
[1:50:42] and they don't want any false doctrine
[1:50:45] they don't want any sin any sin
[1:50:46] addiction creeping into the church
[1:50:49] how many went to church with unleavened
[1:50:52] let's pray
[1:50:53] heavenly father
[1:50:55] we see such wisdom in the books of the
[1:50:57] bible
[1:50:59] lord you know my heart i'm just
[1:51:00] overwhelmed every time i read this this
[1:51:02] is so beautiful
[1:51:03] i can clearly see how this applies to
[1:51:05] the new testament
[1:51:06] the saint who's born again who's crossed
[1:51:09] over jordan
[1:51:10] and has possessed the promises of god
[1:51:14] lord and i see amongst ministers that's
[1:51:16] why i'm trying to correct different ones
[1:51:17] from jeffersonville from other states
[1:51:21] and i accept correction on
[1:51:23] myself i accept it
[1:51:25] because i need it
[1:51:28] and i know you love me lord enough to
[1:51:30] correct me
[1:51:31] if you didn't correct me i wouldn't be
[1:51:33] your son but because you correct me
[1:51:36] i can be a son of god
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:41] lord as i think about the statements
[1:51:43] that i felt you preached down through
[1:51:45] this sermon i pray the young people
[1:51:47] would not tease one another
[1:51:48] but they would build each other up and
[1:51:50] lord let me just say to the adults too
[1:51:52] they wouldn't tease one another
[1:51:54] for lord it could have been for the
[1:51:55] adults as well
[1:51:56] but you know i felt that burden as i was
[1:51:58] preparing this morning not even i wasn't
[1:52:00] even thinking about it just come to my
[1:52:02] heart
[1:52:09] lord let us have a humble attitude like
[1:52:11] your prophet
[1:52:13] like peter who could be corrected by
[1:52:15] paul
[1:52:16] a man who could walk on water
[1:52:19] a man whose shadow would heal the sick
[1:52:22] mercy
[1:52:24] but yet he was humble enough to receive
[1:52:25] correction
[1:52:28] help us lord to receive your correction
[1:52:32] and if we would be the ones to go out to
[1:52:33] a spiritual war may we do it in love and
[1:52:36] meekness the bible said and may we have
[1:52:38] a listening ear
[1:52:40] may we be slow to speak
[1:52:42] and quick to listen
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:48] to me lord every sermon is almost like a
[1:52:50] shouting sermon i shout i thank you lord
[1:52:52] for your word for your truth o god now
[1:52:54] help me to live it lord in jesus name
[1:52:56] help our church deliver in jesus christ
[1:52:58] holy name amen
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:33] and make
[1:53:36] me more
[1:53:41] can we raise our hands tonight
[1:53:43] [Music]
