[32:16] praying in your own heart here
[32:18] heavenly father we come here lord in all
[32:20] sincerity lord in all truth knowing lord
[32:22] you
[32:23] you told us to go into all the nations
[32:25] and make disciples of every
[32:27] nation lord and teaching them to observe
[32:29] whatsoever i commanded them
[32:31] lord and so we believe that we want to
[32:33] observe all your commands lord god
[32:36] father here at the end time where the
[32:37] bible says the mysteries of god will be
[32:39] finished
[32:41] as as you've declared to your servants
[32:42] the prophet saw we want to do our part
[32:44] in
[32:45] in uh prophesying those mysteries again
[32:47] lord god
[32:48] and so father just write these
[32:50] revelations on the on the hearts of the
[32:52] girls lord and
[32:53] and the saints here lord god we pray and
[32:56] lord jesus we just
[32:57] thank you for your spirit we we're happy
[32:59] to sing to you lord it's a
[33:01] it's a joy we feel your presence lord
[33:03] god we know you're we're your chosen
[33:05] seed because of all these
[33:06] lord attributes of the true bride of
[33:08] christ and we're grateful for that
[33:10] lord we have confidence in your word
[33:12] lord
[33:13] it's called us out of darkness into the
[33:15] marvelous light lord and it's washing us
[33:18] constantly week after week washed in the
[33:21] waters of the word
[33:22] so i give you thanks and praise for that
[33:24] i couldn't do it on my own lord none of
[33:26] us could
[33:26] it takes the washing of the holy spirit
[33:28] so we thank you and we give you praise
[33:30] in jesus christ's name remember he said
[33:33] amen god bless you as you're being
[33:34] seated praise god
[33:43] that's my guy right there
[33:50] or me i just got a little runny nose
[33:52] here
[33:56] let's make sure i wash my hands before
[33:57] we shake hands after church okay
[33:59] everybody i need to wash my hands
[34:01] i need to i don't want to spread
[34:02] anything here
[34:04] all right so let's take a few minutes
[34:05] i'll set my timer here let's do about 40
[34:07] minutes here by god's grace
[34:08] and we'll teach this we're almost done
[34:10] to the end of this revelation here
[34:13] i trust you've enjoyed it uh learning
[34:16] about
[34:17] and receiving the revelations of the
[34:19] church as the bride
[34:21] to me after studying all this is just
[34:23] it's more obvious
[34:24] uh more than ever and today i was uh
[34:27] doing a little bit more research on
[34:29] jehovah's witnesses and mormons and
[34:31] i have a couple friends that are one of
[34:33] each
[34:35] and just doing some more research just
[34:37] listening to what they believe
[34:39] i'll start with jehovah's witnesses they
[34:41] really don't believe
[34:42] in a torment in hell they just believe
[34:44] when a person dies
[34:45] they no longer exist uh what a what a
[34:49] false teaching that is and they don't
[34:51] really believe jesus is god they believe
[34:53] he's like michael he's like a lower
[34:55] being and i know there's a few quotes
[34:57] from brother branham on that but he
[34:59] never labored on that and i don't think
[35:00] it was a
[35:01] major doctrine of brother branham i
[35:03] never heard even one sermon on it
[35:05] so uh just seeing that they deny the
[35:08] deity of christ and remember they deny
[35:10] the holy ghost supernatural power of god
[35:13] so when i told the one about my my
[35:15] mother being healed of cancer they just
[35:17] said well maybe
[35:18] maybe she didn't have it maybe the
[35:19] doctors got it wrong
[35:21] you weren't there that's the thing you
[35:24] you know nothing about it
[35:26] and so see what uh what a discouragement
[35:28] that would be right to my mom's
[35:29] testimony right or even my faith
[35:32] but we know you know we know my mom had
[35:34] the bruises
[35:35] like just like she did for the skinny
[35:37] stone she said she had and that's what
[35:38] she was so scared a couple wednesday
[35:39] nights ago and i shared that
[35:41] she had bruises on her back uh and she
[35:43] said that's what i had when i had cancer
[35:45] so we i remember that remember that she
[35:47] had those bruises and when she had
[35:48] cancer
[35:50] and then they had of course they had the
[35:51] x-rays and all the data
[35:53] but you know jehovah's witnesses they'll
[35:55] deny that and say well that was
[35:56] that was that wasn't it or the doctors
[35:59] healed her but
[36:00] she had no she had no uh what they call
[36:02] chemo she had no chemo
[36:05] when does cancer just vanish so we're
[36:08] thankful for the living god amen and we
[36:10] know that kind of faith
[36:12] although they couldn't be nice people
[36:13] fine people that kind of faith is not
[36:16] the faith of jesus's bride
[36:18] because that's not fully obedient to
[36:20] every word of god they can be good
[36:22] churches some of them can be saved no
[36:23] doubt very few though
[36:24] the bible says few there be that find
[36:26] the narrow road few of them can be saved
[36:29] i was listening to the mormons you know
[36:30] the mormons uh i have a good friend
[36:32] that's a mormon well i said that good
[36:33] friend but he read my book
[36:35] malcolm knows him he's a good good man
[36:38] he said he liked my book
[36:39] of course his wife wears pants and cuts
[36:41] her hair still so i don't know how much
[36:42] he liked about it but
[36:43] uh mormons you know they believe
[36:47] uh there's three levels to heaven three
[36:48] levels to hell and they believe even
[36:50] someone like
[36:51] uh and they even said it someone like
[36:53] adolf hitler could be in the lowest
[36:55] heaven
[36:56] they think he could possibly be in
[36:57] heaven
[36:59] uh well i doubt it the way the way his
[37:01] life story tells that
[37:03] he basically committed suicide and uh
[37:05] and then of course you know
[37:07] uh they have other false doctrines they
[37:08] have added an entire testament onto
[37:11] the new testament and they actually
[37:13] teach that the king james version has
[37:15] heirs in it so they actually have five
[37:17] books
[37:18] right they actually have five books i'm
[37:20] sorry five sources
[37:22] four books uh including one of these so
[37:24] three other books one of them is the
[37:25] book of
[37:26] mormon and then uh they have two other
[37:28] influences
[37:29] their main influence is actually the
[37:30] leadership the president of
[37:32] the mormon church he's actually what
[37:34] they call like a living prophet
[37:36] and he can change anything the other
[37:37] prophet said and that's the highest
[37:39] revelation is actually their living
[37:41] prophet
[37:42] uh but we know there's no mistakes
[37:44] praise god there might be a little
[37:45] translation here there or something i've
[37:48] not studied that too deep
[37:49] but i know every word i've read it
[37:51] dovetails with all the others
[37:53] amen hallelujah and the god of this
[37:55] bible comes to make this bible live
[37:58] praise god and so we're thankful for
[38:00] that
[38:02] and they actually believed god was just
[38:04] a god over earth
[38:05] and they actually believed god uh was a
[38:08] man that kind of changed into a god and
[38:10] he has all these wives that produce all
[38:11] the children
[38:12] and all the people on the earth today
[38:14] they actually believe that god has
[38:16] uh spiritual wives in heaven that's what
[38:18] they actually believe and they believe a
[38:20] man that
[38:20] that's really godly gets to go to heaven
[38:22] and have lots of wives and produce more
[38:24] children kind of like that same thing
[38:26] and then he's the ruler over all these
[38:28] peoples in heaven
[38:29] now look at that that's just a bunch of
[38:31] crazy stuff
[38:33] you don't find that in the word of god
[38:34] amen so just uh you know just
[38:36] when and then think about that and then
[38:38] they say almost they say almost
[38:41] nobody goes to hell that's totally
[38:43] contrary to what jesus said
[38:45] jesus said few people find salvation
[38:47] they say few people miss salvation
[38:49] so who are we going to believe we're
[38:50] going to believe christ the word amen
[38:52] because he is the word hallelujah that's
[38:55] why we judge
[38:56] everything and joseph smith said he's a
[38:57] prophet well now he added to the word of
[39:00] god and he never prophesied anything
[39:01] that actually came to pass
[39:03] so we we look at each one of these
[39:05] groups and remember church these are
[39:06] some of the churches that are growing
[39:08] the most
[39:08] in protestantism the mormon church i've
[39:11] seen numerous articles over the years
[39:12] how the mormon church is expanding and
[39:14] getting bigger and because people like
[39:16] you know the solemnness of it and the
[39:18] seriousness of it
[39:20] and they want something more than what
[39:21] the dead denominations well that's just
[39:23] as dead it's just got a little different
[39:24] twist on it
[39:25] and so sea church you know uh the
[39:27] deception is rising right
[39:30] uh the deception is rising but but the
[39:32] revelation of god is still available to
[39:34] those who want to receive it
[39:36] it's it's out there for those who really
[39:38] want to be the bride
[39:39] who really want to obey jesus it's out
[39:41] there and
[39:42] it's for those who want those five
[39:44] aspects
[39:46] remember there's five aspects to the
[39:47] bride christ
[39:49] is her head not a creed
[39:52] second she submits to all the word
[39:55] third she's washed by jesus's washing
[39:58] method amen
[40:00] the water of the word fourth she's
[40:02] joined to christ
[40:03] and also christ's body because you can't
[40:06] separate
[40:06] the head from the body right and then
[40:08] last she's got
[40:10] reverence the bible said see that she
[40:12] reverence her husband
[40:14] amen and so we got reverence for jesus
[40:16] christ all five attributes
[40:18] we can see are with the bride and we
[40:20] believe we're part of that bride i
[40:22] wouldn't be here if i didn't believe
[40:23] that amen
[40:24] i believe i'm a part of the bride of
[40:26] jesus christ praise god
[40:28] now last week we finished with eve
[40:30] remember we looked at lessons we did
[40:31] eight women
[40:32] uh that specifically typed rapture women
[40:36] gentile women jew gentile women rather
[40:39] and then we close with eve's redemption
[40:41] story i got a few more women i like to
[40:43] go through
[40:44] uh and then eventually i want to end
[40:46] with the revelation i'm sorry the
[40:47] proverbs 31 woman
[40:49] so got your bibles young people get out
[40:51] your bibles if you can we'll have some
[40:52] ready readers
[40:53] by god's grace appreciate all the
[40:55] reading on sunday night everybody did a
[40:56] nice job reading there
[40:58] so thank you all right let's start with
[41:00] jochebed so we learned
[41:02] a great lesson from eve how she's uh
[41:06] the last eve right there's christ was
[41:08] the last adam
[41:09] uh and we the church are the last eve
[41:14] what a story she is of redemption praise
[41:16] god she was glorious she was perfect
[41:18] she fell but redeemed by the blood amen
[41:22] thank god for that now let's look at
[41:23] another one jacob but i tried to just
[41:25] you know as i wrote this last summer
[41:27] i just tried to sit under the anointing
[41:28] of the holy spirit and see which women i
[41:30] looked at all these lists of bible women
[41:31] and
[41:32] which ones really spoke to me as lessons
[41:34] we can learn
[41:35] eve is a great lesson of redemption
[41:37] praise god
[41:38] and we learn great lessons we learn not
[41:40] to add to the word
[41:42] and we learn that there's grace and
[41:44] there's mercy
[41:45] especially if you're one with the
[41:47] husband praise god and thank god we're
[41:48] one with christ amen
[41:51] now jacob what a great example now she
[41:54] and her husband are examples of trusting
[41:56] god in the face of
[41:59] governmental oppression and persecution
[42:01] right
[42:02] egypt was killing all the hebrew babies
[42:05] but jochebed's faith
[42:07] caused her to reject fear so let's read
[42:10] that it's uh
[42:10] hebrews 11 23 malachi can you get that
[42:13] for me hebrews 11
[42:14] 23 if you could read that i'd appreciate
[42:17] that
[42:22] look at this woman what an example of
[42:24] faith
[42:26] and notice the bible says jochebed she's
[42:28] the one that casts the
[42:30] uh the the ark upon the waters right or
[42:32] she had her daughter miriam do it
[42:34] but it was her it was the scripture
[42:36] specifically
[42:37] points out to her faith hebrews 11 23.
[42:41] let's read that or malcolm going to read
[42:42] that for us buddy
[42:52] hey man now look the church you know we
[42:55] got to put ourselves in her spot she
[42:57] didn't even have the baptism of the holy
[42:58] ghost
[42:59] but look at the faith that she had she's
[43:01] seeing all the hebrew babies dying
[43:03] around her so she hides her baby boy for
[43:05] what was it three months
[43:07] i think look at zion's six so half of
[43:09] that
[43:10] she hit that baby for three months and
[43:14] the bible said they were not afraid now
[43:16] what would it take
[43:17] for us to be not afraid of something
[43:18] like that where they come around and
[43:20] take every hebrew boy right
[43:22] every christian boy they take them it
[43:25] would take a lot of faith right
[43:27] but the bible says i just like i love
[43:29] what it says it says the same thing
[43:30] about abraham
[43:31] he staggered not at the promise of god
[43:33] amen ahead we know he did we know he did
[43:36] but the bible
[43:37] shows how god forgives that staggering
[43:39] god forgives those stumbling
[43:41] like brother adam said about moses and
[43:43] joshua he's not looking at our mistakes
[43:45] he's looking at the commission
[43:46] praise god he's looking at our office
[43:48] he's looking at our position in christ
[43:50] jesus
[43:51] so the same thing here no doubt jacob
[43:54] would have been
[43:54] afraid just like i would be afraid just
[43:56] like you'd be afraid if someone was
[43:58] going to come around and take a child
[43:59] right
[44:00] but the bible said by faith they were
[44:02] not afraid
[44:03] of the king's commandment amen praise
[44:06] god now look at this woman's faith
[44:08] so faith caused her to reject fear and
[44:11] she
[44:12] cast moses upon the waters in an ark
[44:15] rather than let him die in egypt's hands
[44:18] amen
[44:19] what a what an example of a woman there
[44:21] she said i'd rather take my chances with
[44:23] god's word amen
[44:25] right then just surrender my child
[44:29] over to the government amen i like that
[44:31] praise god
[44:32] in other words church she's an example
[44:34] of
[44:35] god honoring faith praise god in other
[44:38] words here's her example she goes to all
[44:40] lengths
[44:41] to love and protect and train the child
[44:44] that god gives her she'll do anything to
[44:47] keep satan's hands
[44:48] off her children amen what an example of
[44:51] faith that should speak to every
[44:53] every child of god right do everything
[44:55] in your power
[44:57] to obey the word of god never surrender
[44:59] an inch to the government right
[45:01] or an inch to the devil praise god amen
[45:06] see and god so honored that he
[45:09] eventually had the government
[45:11] pay her to raise this child they wanted
[45:13] to destroy
[45:13] [Laughter]
[45:15] i love that praise god and then he would
[45:17] later overthrow egypt praise god and
[45:20] destroy
[45:21] oh their entire army amen what a what a
[45:24] masterpiece of god's story that he
[45:26] writes praise god
[45:27] amen see now both of them look their
[45:31] trust
[45:32] in god they had such trust in god they
[45:34] said i'm not going to obey the
[45:35] government
[45:36] so i'll do everything in my power to
[45:38] preserve the life of this child
[45:41] amen what faith that is so see we learn
[45:44] from jochebed
[45:46] honor god's word despite persecution
[45:49] because peter said we ought to obey god
[45:52] rather than man
[45:54] praise god trust god with your
[45:57] children's destiny that's what she did
[45:58] right
[45:59] she said i don't know what's going to
[46:00] happen lebron said there was alligators
[46:02] swimming all over
[46:03] all around in their river right and she
[46:05] just she had faith that the angels
[46:07] would shoo them away praise god amen
[46:11] so see trust god with the children's
[46:14] destiny
[46:15] god will reward you in ways you cannot
[46:17] imagine
[46:18] amen hallelujah see go to every length
[46:22] to train and protect your children
[46:24] that's why uh
[46:25] there's some things i'm looking at for
[46:26] my family to try to train and protect
[46:28] them a little more
[46:29] by god's grace do everything i can to
[46:32] protect them
[46:33] especially online in other words i might
[46:35] be paying some money to get some
[46:36] software to just
[46:37] protect them even more i've never i did
[46:39] that in the past but then i
[46:41] kind of took that off but i may do that
[46:42] again i just want to go to any lengths
[46:45] to make sure satan can't get a grasp
[46:47] on my children praise god that god would
[46:50] be able to raise them up and
[46:52] help me to sharpen them and train them
[46:54] and do everything in my power
[46:56] to protect them because god has their
[46:58] destiny in his control
[47:00] praise god thank god
[47:03] and what a what an example church
[47:07] to train up a child in the way that he
[47:09] should go and when he's old he's not
[47:11] depart from it
[47:12] when did moses really start serving god
[47:14] at 80 years old
[47:18] wow that's really something 80 years old
[47:20] the mother that cast him in the waters
[47:22] little did you know
[47:23] 80 years later he's finally going to get
[47:25] in his place
[47:27] and he was going to be a murderer right
[47:29] think of all those years she had to
[47:31] struggle with my
[47:31] he left and he's gone but you know she
[47:34] just had to trust
[47:35] there's a purpose for this god's got the
[47:37] destiny
[47:38] of my son and daughters and sons right
[47:41] aaron
[47:41] god's got their destiny in his hand and
[47:44] the devil could have said they haven't
[47:45] done anything they're 60 they're 70
[47:47] they're 75
[47:48] they haven't done anything for god and
[47:49] she just had to believe god protected
[47:51] him for
[47:52] a reason god has a purpose for his life
[47:54] amen
[47:55] hallelujah church if that can be if that
[47:58] faith is done
[47:58] under the blood of bulls and goats our
[48:00] faith is stronger
[48:02] under the blood of christ amen that's
[48:05] what we need to believe i'm believing
[48:06] that for my children
[48:07] we got to believe it for all of our
[48:09] children we'll do everything
[48:10] to protect our children train them up
[48:13] and god will control their destiny
[48:15] he'll take them to their destiny and we
[48:17] we can have confidence that god is
[48:19] faithful amen train them up in the way
[48:24] they should go and when he's old like 80
[48:27] moses won't debart from it oh i love
[48:31] that that's beautiful
[48:32] my goodness 80 years later oh what a
[48:35] testimony
[48:36] yeah we just had that remember i told
[48:37] you that story there's that that a man
[48:39] his name was herb
[48:40] or herb herb his name was herb
[48:43] up at brother samuel's church he just
[48:45] passed away last year
[48:47] right right uh right during cove but he
[48:48] passed away but i don't think it was
[48:50] from covid
[48:52] his daughter got cancer like 10 years
[48:54] before that
[48:56] and she was in her 60s the cancer
[48:59] drove her back to the message god healed
[49:02] her of cancer
[49:04] and she became a message believer in her
[49:05] 60s i got to shake her hand the last
[49:07] time i was there
[49:08] beautiful my that brother that brother
[49:11] just hung on service after service i
[49:12] never even heard him shout sister naomi
[49:15] i never heard him speak in tongues or
[49:17] prophesy or
[49:18] i never saw him stomp or dance in the
[49:20] spirit he just sat there service after
[49:22] service i'd see him cry and i didn't see
[49:23] that
[49:25] he'd amen he'd say hey man you know we
[49:27] gotta have that southern
[49:28] amen i think he's from kentucky or
[49:31] something like that
[49:32] but he just sat there service after
[49:34] service and finally
[49:35] all those prayers all that training they
[49:37] did uh god had a time and season
[49:40] god has a time and season for every baby
[49:42] to be born amen
[49:44] god will visit according to the time of
[49:46] life amen
[49:47] glory what a testimony god bless brother
[49:50] herb and there is
[49:51] god bless the soul there in heaven amen
[49:55] i can't pray for him but may god bless
[49:56] him what a servant of the lord amen
[50:00] so that's that's what we gain from
[50:02] jochebed
[50:03] trust god have faith pray until the fear
[50:07] leaves amen
[50:09] trust god with the destiny of our
[50:10] children have faith that's a great
[50:12] lesson for the bride of christ today
[50:15] amen
[50:18] do everything in your power to protect
[50:20] love and train them
[50:21] and god will fulfill his destiny for
[50:24] their lives all right
[50:26] next is deborah let's go another one
[50:28] here deborah that's actually the third
[50:29] one we did eve jochebed deborah i tried
[50:30] to go in
[50:31] you know the bible order deborah was the
[50:34] prophetess
[50:35] and wife of lapidoth he became a judge
[50:38] in israel during a period of spiritual
[50:40] decline
[50:41] when israel was without male prophetic
[50:43] leadership remember there was no
[50:44] prophets
[50:45] the bible said they did whatever they
[50:46] want during this time
[50:49] and she must have prophesied on a couple
[50:51] occasions because then god used her
[50:54] accurate prophecies
[50:55] to inspire barrick in his victorious
[50:58] attacks
[50:58] against the canaanites just like he used
[51:01] sarah
[51:02] to move abraham in sending away hagar
[51:06] and ishmael remember that
[51:09] god spoke to sarah and said cast out the
[51:12] bondwoman
[51:13] and abraham's like well i need god to
[51:14] tell me that and so abraham went prayed
[51:16] and god confirmed that
[51:18] that's what i told sarah cast out the
[51:20] bondwoman
[51:22] with the bond child because they are not
[51:24] heirs
[51:25] like the free woman right praise god
[51:28] and so prophecy here we see a
[51:31] prophecy can come through our sisters
[51:35] praise god see so the bride learns the
[51:38] power of prophecy
[51:40] from deborah's example amen
[51:44] the bible said the testimony of jesus is
[51:47] the spirit of prophecy praise god
[51:51] you know some of the most outstanding
[51:52] prophecies i've seen have been through
[51:54] women
[51:54] right like our sister karen sanders from
[51:57] uh
[51:58] from lima she's the one that told sister
[52:00] lisa thus saith the lord
[52:02] whatever you pray for you're gonna get
[52:04] and she got it nine months later she got
[52:06] rebecca
[52:07] that was a prophecy thus saith the lord
[52:09] and i was there when it happened
[52:11] and then i was there uh when she kind of
[52:14] gave that discernment with brother
[52:15] brooks outside
[52:16] of the church and our dedication as back
[52:18] in 2007 that boy it's been a while
[52:20] or 2006 rather i was there when it was a
[52:24] total discernment with thus saith the
[52:25] lord
[52:26] and then my wife's even that my wife's
[52:28] dream a prophetic dream of warning to
[52:29] that sister
[52:31] uh that eventually cut her hair left the
[52:33] message and
[52:34] now divorced twice and is almost gone
[52:36] insane
[52:37] uh and she laughed and she scoffed kind
[52:39] of laughed and scoffed at my wife's
[52:41] dream but yet it was prophetic
[52:44] now ezra 6 14 lydia can you read that
[52:47] ezra 6 14
[52:49] says we always prosper through prophecy
[52:52] so anything
[52:53] the lord prophesies it will make us grow
[52:57] more like christ praise god
[53:00] prophecy is not to make us prideful amen
[53:03] is to make us
[53:04] prosper in the things of god
[53:09] okay so lydia can you read that
[53:26] amen now we know some of the prophecies
[53:28] when we go to hegei
[53:29] right and zechariah the glory of the
[53:32] latter house
[53:33] will be greater than the glory of the
[53:34] farmer right there are certain
[53:36] prophecies that they gave
[53:37] zechariah talked about the oil not by
[53:39] might not by power
[53:40] but by my spirit saith the lord all
[53:42] these things all these prophecies were
[53:44] given
[53:45] and it encouraged them and they've come
[53:47] to pass some in their day
[53:48] some in nehemiah's day and ezra's day
[53:51] but others
[53:52] in jesus day praise god and some of them
[53:54] will be
[53:55] in the days of uh 144 000 jews praise
[53:59] god
[53:59] when they weep from house to house and
[54:01] said how could we do it we crucified our
[54:03] own messiah right
[54:05] uh so these these prophecies always make
[54:08] you prosper
[54:09] now church i believe this the reason we
[54:11] don't hear more prophecies
[54:12] is because we're not praying and seeking
[54:14] for it right so when was the last time
[54:16] we just had a prayer session
[54:18] god let's all pray for prophecy right so
[54:21] that's something we got to be
[54:22] we got to be open to that i've got to be
[54:24] i've got to be mindful of that
[54:26] you know we got to be the bible said
[54:28] desire spiritual gifts right
[54:30] covet after spiritual gifts that's what
[54:33] i was saying on sunday that's an area
[54:34] where we all can grow in that area right
[54:36] the reason we have not is because we ask
[54:39] that
[54:40] amen that's right that's the word of god
[54:42] we should expect prophetic things
[54:44] if we've got the holy ghost because the
[54:46] spirit of jesus is the spirit of
[54:48] prophecy praise god
[54:53] like i told you that one brother the
[54:55] denominational brother my friend
[54:57] uh he kind of noticed two prophecies
[54:58] about me the one time i prayed god
[55:00] uh remove this principle or change their
[55:02] heart and the next year the principle
[55:04] was removed
[55:05] i didn't even know they're going to
[55:05] retire another one i prayed i said god
[55:08] i said we need a break from bible club
[55:10] then the cronovirus came and we haven't
[55:11] done bible club for over a year now
[55:14] now i know my wife's really enjoyed that
[55:15] i've kind of enjoyed it too i kind of
[55:17] got worn out
[55:19] i prayed for those things and they just
[55:21] came to pass you know
[55:23] uh and god's grace is just god's grace
[55:27] so these things we must pray for and
[55:30] seek right
[55:31] we must seek prophecy they needed
[55:33] prophecy because they were having
[55:34] trouble finishing the wall
[55:36] right they got the temple bill but then
[55:38] they then they
[55:39] they stopped in the middle of building
[55:41] the wall so god sent
[55:42] prophets to stir them up with thus saith
[55:45] the lord praise god and it caused them
[55:47] to prosper
[55:48] and accomplish what god wanted them to
[55:50] accomplish how many want to accomplish
[55:52] god's will for your life
[55:53] amen well then you know i imagine we're
[55:56] going to need some prophecy to do that
[55:58] praise god
[55:59] we need some foretelling of the future
[56:02] tell us what to do or what to expect
[56:04] or what to happen my we can pray for
[56:06] that tonight when we're done remind me
[56:08] we'll pray if i forget
[56:09] remind me let's pray for prophecy at the
[56:11] end of this service here tonight let me
[56:12] write that down
[56:14] pray for prophecy
[56:21] if we've got the holy spirit we should
[56:22] expect the spirit of prophecy
[56:25] to speak to us amen
[56:30] know the few times there's been a few
[56:31] times i've really prayed hard remember i
[56:32] prayed a couple times uh
[56:35] jesus sent the holy spirit to akron for
[56:37] your sake jesus remember i prayed that a
[56:39] few times
[56:39] and a couple of people said they've got
[56:40] the holy ghost to me that's the spirit
[56:43] of prophecy
[56:44] i was burdened to see people born again
[56:46] and we prayed for it and then it
[56:48] happened by god's grace
[56:49] amen all right
[56:53] now see this also teaches us women
[56:56] cannot preach
[56:58] with authority due to eve's deception
[57:01] but they can and have all the rights of
[57:05] the nine spiritual gifts so they can be
[57:07] used
[57:08] in a very supernatural way praise god
[57:11] in other words the woman will never take
[57:13] the man's place can i say like this
[57:15] the bride will never take jesus's place
[57:17] right but at the same time we can do
[57:19] supernatural things
[57:21] if we're submitted to the husband praise
[57:22] god we'll never take his place
[57:25] but we can do little minor things
[57:27] compared to his great work
[57:29] if we're submitted and in tune with this
[57:32] holy spirit
[57:33] like this imagine this philip's four
[57:35] daughters that prophesied
[57:37] can you imagine having a church like
[57:38] that i where
[57:40] any of the four on a sunday will come up
[57:43] maybe once a year
[57:44] twice a year they come up and and they
[57:46] they tell dad
[57:47] they tell their dad philip phillip or
[57:49] daddy the lord gave me a prophecy
[57:51] it's thus saith the lord and then can
[57:53] you imagine it coming to pass
[57:56] four of them they knew these four
[57:58] sisters for sure
[57:59] let me name them out you know rebecca
[58:01] and sarah you know
[58:02] you can just give them names right
[58:04] they're for sure
[58:05] prophets as far as the gift of prophecy
[58:09] because these four sisters now think
[58:11] about their prayer lives these sisters
[58:13] must have been in prayer
[58:15] right that's why i encourage my little
[58:16] daughters right and all the little girls
[58:18] be in prayer
[58:19] if we're going back to the book of acts
[58:20] church we might have some
[58:22] prophetesses here tonight by god's grace
[58:25] amen
[58:26] but we got to pray for it praise god
[58:28] we've got to pray for that
[58:30] imagine a church where four of the
[58:31] little girls
[58:33] we knew were prophets
[58:36] they could they foretold things now for
[58:38] us it might be my dream right
[58:42] like i'm just talking with malachi a
[58:43] couple of dreams seem very prophetic
[58:46] especially the one about his will you
[58:48] know god's will for his life seems very
[58:49] prophetic
[58:51] i gotta go digging through my files i
[58:52] bet i can find some more of you guys
[58:54] dreams
[58:55] over the years we just wrote them down
[58:56] and i just forget about them
[58:59] but the spirit of the lord is the spirit
[59:01] of prophecy
[59:05] all right and we learned that from
[59:06] deborah deborah's an example that be
[59:09] faithful be faithful
[59:10] faithfully prophesy faithfully prophesy
[59:12] and the lord will use you to bring a
[59:14] great victory
[59:16] amen all right let's go next to
[59:20] macau i don't even know how to say this
[59:21] i know it's not michael dave or david's
[59:24] wife but macau lydia would you know how
[59:26] to pronounce that
[59:27] malachi have you heard how to pronounce
[59:29] that i'll just say macau
[59:31] because i can't be michael because
[59:32] michael has its own spelling macau
[59:34] the daughter of king saul wife of david
[59:38] she once saved david's life by helping
[59:40] him escape
[59:41] saul's wrath remember that i think she
[59:43] let him down by a basket
[59:45] right out the window when saul was after
[59:48] him
[59:50] or his men were after him but then
[59:52] church i don't know if you know the
[59:53] story but
[59:54] then she was given away after david fled
[59:56] macau
[59:57] was given away in marriage to another
[59:59] man and later when david got back into
[1:00:01] power he reclaimed her
[1:00:03] i don't know how that worked uh maybe
[1:00:05] they didn't have relations maybe he just
[1:00:07] married her
[1:00:08] i don't know how that would work because
[1:00:09] he couldn't take back a woman that had
[1:00:12] you know had already had another man's
[1:00:15] marriage another man had a relation with
[1:00:16] another man
[1:00:17] i'm not sure how that worked but he
[1:00:19] reclaimed her back after he gets on the
[1:00:21] throne
[1:00:22] and then david brings the ark back into
[1:00:25] jerusalem
[1:00:26] praise god and instead of rejoicing with
[1:00:30] david
[1:00:30] she criticizes him in other words that
[1:00:34] spirit that was on her daddy see how
[1:00:35] spirits sometimes
[1:00:36] live in families may god help our spirit
[1:00:39] our family to be free from evil spirits
[1:00:42] may our family be known for having the
[1:00:44] holy spirit praise god
[1:00:45] amen i don't want any critical spirits
[1:00:48] or
[1:00:49] or antichrist spirits or negative
[1:00:52] spirits
[1:00:52] we don't want any of those spirits on
[1:00:54] our family we want the holy spirit on
[1:00:56] our family
[1:00:58] but this spirit must have never left too
[1:01:00] far from that family
[1:01:01] oh yeah remember the bible said the
[1:01:03] iniquities of the fathers will be upon
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:05] children if they don't repent right so
[1:01:08] macau must have got a wrong spirit on
[1:01:10] her and that iniquity of saul came upon
[1:01:12] her
[1:01:13] remember the iniquity of salk remember
[1:01:14] it came upon the whole nation remember
[1:01:16] they had three years of famine you
[1:01:17] remember that
[1:01:18] preached on that on blessings and
[1:01:19] cursing a few months ago probably more
[1:01:21] than a few
[1:01:22] by now the iniquity of the fathers
[1:01:26] on the children
[1:01:29] and so david is dancing the bible said
[1:01:32] all his might now
[1:01:32] think about how high you could jump
[1:01:34] children think about think about all
[1:01:36] your might
[1:01:36] think about i do that at school
[1:01:38] sometimes yeah we we exercise
[1:01:40] think about how hot you can jump david
[1:01:43] was doing all of his might he probably
[1:01:44] had sweat on his face
[1:01:46] he probably had to get out that you know
[1:01:47] that holy holy cloth and
[1:01:49] he all of his might as high as he could
[1:01:51] jump
[1:01:52] imagine just shouting the bible said he
[1:01:54] was shouting
[1:01:55] jumping dancing and praising god he was
[1:01:58] so
[1:01:59] grateful that the ark of god which
[1:02:01] represent the presence of god
[1:02:03] the presence of god is going to have a
[1:02:05] permanent home amongst us
[1:02:07] amen oh my thank god that we can have
[1:02:10] that too praise god
[1:02:11] the friends of god can permanently dwell
[1:02:14] in our little church
[1:02:15] in our homes in our houses praise god
[1:02:17] and so david jumped with all of his
[1:02:19] might
[1:02:21] and macau stood out the window and
[1:02:24] brother brandon said he said
[1:02:25] she went like this just disk holy roller
[1:02:28] [Laughter]
[1:02:30] tis this disc holy roller that's what
[1:02:34] she said she called him a holy roller in
[1:02:36] her heart
[1:02:37] she despised all that freedom and all
[1:02:39] that joy
[1:02:41] and all that jumping and worshiping
[1:02:44] and god said because you've done that
[1:02:47] you're cursed
[1:02:48] your womb is cursed and you'll not bring
[1:02:50] forth children
[1:02:52] so that means she could have they could
[1:02:54] have had relations again right so
[1:02:56] he uh she must have not had any
[1:02:58] relations
[1:02:59] with that other husband
[1:03:04] so despising the holy ghost brings
[1:03:07] bareness right
[1:03:10] despising real worship brings barrenness
[1:03:14] now that was in the natural
[1:03:18] now i think that's a sad thing too but
[1:03:20] what's
[1:03:21] worse is spiritual barrenness that's
[1:03:24] worse
[1:03:25] because the bride the bride remember
[1:03:27] these are lessons we should learn as
[1:03:28] bride
[1:03:28] right bride members know the importance
[1:03:31] of inspired worship
[1:03:33] expressing in singing dancing shouting
[1:03:36] and more praise god
[1:03:38] amen paul said
[1:03:42] in first thessalonians 5 19 quench not
[1:03:45] the holy spirit
[1:03:46] so don't put a damper and a damper and
[1:03:48] say oh quiet down quiet down we should
[1:03:50] let our children
[1:03:51] shout and praise the lord amen we should
[1:03:54] let our adults praise
[1:03:55] the lord amen you don't want to quench
[1:03:57] that when
[1:03:58] uh when you feel like something's going
[1:04:01] to break inside of you let it out
[1:04:03] children when you feel like god wants
[1:04:04] you to cry or scream scream
[1:04:07] praise god let it out don't quench it
[1:04:09] let out that worship because god
[1:04:11] inhabits the praises of his people
[1:04:13] praise god
[1:04:15] amen now can i talk about that right
[1:04:17] remember when you were younger
[1:04:19] and you felt malachi was younger and he
[1:04:21] said he said a spirit came upon him
[1:04:24] and it was so powerful he had to stop
[1:04:26] singing
[1:04:27] that's what you're that's what you told
[1:04:28] me i've been going through the notes
[1:04:30] lately of our
[1:04:31] our old conversations and i've had that
[1:04:34] too
[1:04:34] i know if i keep singing i'm gonna cry
[1:04:36] happens to me quite a bit
[1:04:39] but i've realized it's for worship it's
[1:04:41] for me to express my love to god
[1:04:44] because that's what dave was doing he
[1:04:45] was just expressing his love for god
[1:04:47] god loves it when it were emotional for
[1:04:49] him right he
[1:04:51] in other words he loves sincere worship
[1:04:53] praise god
[1:04:54] he loves somebody who worships in the
[1:04:55] spirit and in truth
[1:05:00] and so when we feel that we've got to be
[1:05:01] willing to let that go and praise god
[1:05:03] and not stand there and say
[1:05:05] this what a holy
[1:05:08] oh man david knew david
[1:05:12] see david had already cast out devils
[1:05:14] amen david already cast out devils by
[1:05:16] music and he knew
[1:05:18] that when you worship god and you sing
[1:05:20] it's going to drive away the devils amen
[1:05:22] he knew they have liberty
[1:05:23] in the holy spirit and so that's why he
[1:05:26] was shouting dancing praising god
[1:05:29] he knew if god's presence was in the
[1:05:30] church if god's presence was in the camp
[1:05:33] god's people should be joyful god's
[1:05:35] people should be free
[1:05:36] god's people will be worshippers amen
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:43] but see churches that reject that like a
[1:05:45] lot of message churches
[1:05:47] they will go childless meaning they'll
[1:05:49] be cursed and nobody be born again by
[1:05:51] the holy ghost what a sad church that is
[1:05:55] just as natural babies are born noisily
[1:05:58] so are spiritual babies born with some
[1:06:01] noise and the church said
[1:06:03] there's got to be noise when the baby's
[1:06:05] born right there's got to be noise
[1:06:07] and that's what david's example was
[1:06:09] showing us and michael was
[1:06:10] here the example of what we shouldn't do
[1:06:13] we should learn
[1:06:14] not to uh criticize that but be
[1:06:17] thankful for that praise god now here's
[1:06:20] what i've seen overseas and other
[1:06:22] other services too one time i was
[1:06:24] preaching uh in south america
[1:06:26] and there's a girl in the back so just
[1:06:28] you know it was a really long it's about
[1:06:30] this wide this the congregation but it's
[1:06:32] really long
[1:06:32] there's maybe 100 people there maybe i'm
[1:06:34] probably exaggerating but anyways we
[1:06:36] were singing and there's this woman in
[1:06:37] the back and she started going like this
[1:06:40] and the women around her are like
[1:06:42] getting hit you know
[1:06:43] just trying to contain her and i thought
[1:06:46] later i thought
[1:06:47] that wasn't the holy ghost and it wasn't
[1:06:49] it was the devil
[1:06:50] because when the holy ghost is on you
[1:06:52] you won't hurt other people
[1:06:54] praise god and they we talked to that
[1:06:57] woman later she had some issues in her
[1:06:58] life i don't know of his divorce or
[1:07:00] abuse i don't remember what it was
[1:07:01] but that demon i just called the prayer
[1:07:03] line and i was praying for people in the
[1:07:05] prayer line
[1:07:05] so people were getting free god was
[1:07:07] answering prayer and that demon didn't
[1:07:09] like it
[1:07:10] right and i don't know if they brought
[1:07:13] it up for prayer i think they just
[1:07:14] escorted her out but the times i've seen
[1:07:17] that when people are just
[1:07:18] out of control hurting people it's the
[1:07:21] devil
[1:07:22] because it's trying to distract uh from
[1:07:25] deliverance
[1:07:27] right but the same time i've had a woman
[1:07:29] bite me i told you that bite me on the
[1:07:30] shoulder and she was but i held onto her
[1:07:32] hand and pretty soon she let out a
[1:07:33] scream fell
[1:07:34] down and she was set free praise god
[1:07:37] hallelujah and so david knew when the
[1:07:41] word is there
[1:07:42] people are going to be free they're
[1:07:44] going to get victory there's power
[1:07:46] demons will flee when there's freedom of
[1:07:48] the holy spirit that's what we need
[1:07:49] today freedom of the holy spirit praise
[1:07:51] god
[1:07:52] and let the let the ones that want to be
[1:07:54] filled with the holy ghost be filled
[1:07:55] with the holy ghost praise god
[1:07:56] no matter how much they sing or shout or
[1:07:58] pray or cry whatever
[1:08:00] let them be filled with the holy ghost
[1:08:02] that's what we're here for praise god
[1:08:04] we're not here to die and become a
[1:08:05] denomination we're here to rise and go
[1:08:07] to heaven praise god
[1:08:09] that's why we're here praise god
[1:08:13] i don't want a dead church you don't
[1:08:14] want a dead church we want a living
[1:08:16] church praise god
[1:08:19] so macau is best resembled by judas
[1:08:21] iscariot because
[1:08:22] judas degraded lazarus's sister mary
[1:08:26] when she had those costly spikenard and
[1:08:29] anointed jesus's feet
[1:08:31] with her long uncut hair the bible said
[1:08:34] right so we follow the example of
[1:08:38] the bride by getting in the spirit with
[1:08:41] fully
[1:08:42] loudly loudly worshiping god with bodies
[1:08:45] and emotions
[1:08:46] despite reproach from judas iscariot
[1:08:48] type mockers
[1:08:50] go to acts 4 here let's so sometimes
[1:08:52] church i just want to encourage the
[1:08:53] church
[1:08:54] hopefully i know all this well hopefully
[1:08:55] the saints are watching us if they're
[1:08:57] you know on archive or something here's
[1:09:00] what i like to see a little more too we
[1:09:02] talked about praying for gifts
[1:09:04] i like to see our church do this just
[1:09:05] feel free to pray loud
[1:09:07] when we pray out loud pray out loud you
[1:09:09] know when we pray at the end of the
[1:09:10] service
[1:09:11] just pray louder you know you don't have
[1:09:13] to be a whisper
[1:09:14] my voice don't have to be the loudest
[1:09:15] one right because when the holy ghost
[1:09:18] fell
[1:09:19] in acts 4
[1:09:23] the bible said they they lifted up their
[1:09:25] voice to god
[1:09:26] so it wasn't he lifted up his voice can
[1:09:28] you put that up there hun it's
[1:09:30] acts 4 24.
[1:09:35] sometimes i feel like my voice is the
[1:09:37] only one that's loud and that's fine
[1:09:38] sometimes but
[1:09:40] when where when the holy spirit is
[1:09:41] really here you know and really moving
[1:09:44] and
[1:09:44] we've you know really created a good
[1:09:46] atmosphere i
[1:09:48] should hear more than just my voice loud
[1:09:51] right and when they heard that they
[1:09:53] lifted up their voice to god
[1:09:55] with one accord see that's unity when
[1:09:58] when
[1:09:58] everybody can get in the holy spirit
[1:10:00] there's unity and everybody feels
[1:10:02] like they're talking to god amen oh
[1:10:04] that's what we need praise god
[1:10:06] amen not just me i get free up here i
[1:10:08] feel the holy spirit i feel liberty
[1:10:11] i feel joy and power and love and my
[1:10:13] eyes many times
[1:10:14] i'll lift my voice but here in the book
[1:10:17] of acts when the holy ghost fell in this
[1:10:18] prayer meeting
