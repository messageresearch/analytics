[1:08:26] morning in Jesus name amen so uh looking
[1:08:31] forward to this day we've been looking
[1:08:33] forward to it for a while especially
[1:08:36] this afternoon service when he's
[1:08:38] speaking
[1:08:41] right amen Aaron has really become a a
[1:08:44] real minister of the gospel and I'm uh
[1:08:47] I'm proud of him you know to see how the
[1:08:49] Lord's been using him and he too has
[1:08:52] been through the ringer he's been
[1:08:55] through the mill and he's um but he's
[1:08:58] been to the burning bush that changes
[1:09:01] everything you
[1:09:03] know I was thinking that uh this weekend
[1:09:06] of course is a national holiday it's
[1:09:09] Memorial Day and in doing that we
[1:09:12] remember those that uh gave their lives
[1:09:16] to in service to the country and
[1:09:20] um when I was cutting the grass the
[1:09:22] other day around two days ago I was
[1:09:24] thinking about a man I never met U his
[1:09:28] name was Ralph Smith and uh he loved my
[1:09:32] mother uh this is before my father and
[1:09:35] mother got together and uh he did a real
[1:09:39] beautiful painting for her a watercolor
[1:09:41] of her a portrait of her and gave it to
[1:09:43] her well he uh was drafted or signed up
[1:09:48] I don't know World War II where they
[1:09:49] sent him
[1:09:50] overseas uh I believe the Germans and
[1:09:53] they got a hold of him and hung him by
[1:09:55] his feet till he
[1:09:57] died he gave his life for his country
[1:10:00] and uh all we have is a painting to
[1:10:03] remember I pray that a man was a
[1:10:06] Christian you
[1:10:07] know and U my dad when he fought
[1:10:12] Japanese in World War II on the other
[1:10:15] side he uh served in many many areas of
[1:10:20] battle as a combat engineer but he was
[1:10:23] on what's called The Landing ship tank
[1:10:25] it's a great big vessel that carries all
[1:10:27] the equipment and tanks and trucks and
[1:10:30] stuff and they got hit by a comicazi
[1:10:33] came down blew up went down hit the
[1:10:36] magazine and the whole thing blew up and
[1:10:38] he saw men go just crazy you know they
[1:10:41] didn't know what to do some of them just
[1:10:43] turned and ran into the fire and
[1:10:46] disappeared they gave their lives you
[1:10:49] know and um so it's a it is something to
[1:10:53] remember
[1:10:55] and but I'm also thinking of a greater
[1:10:57] Memorial
[1:10:59] Day I think of uh like you hear people
[1:11:02] talk about well my people this and my
[1:11:05] people that my people were saw
[1:11:08] aunder right my people were burned at
[1:11:11] the stake during the Dark Ages amen
[1:11:14] those are my people they're every color
[1:11:18] every race amen wherever the gospel has
[1:11:21] been preached men and women and children
[1:11:24] have died for this gospel and what a
[1:11:28] service it's going to be on that day
[1:11:30] when that trumpet sounds and they all
[1:11:33] come forward and uh we join them on that
[1:11:37] parade March to the sky oh my I get
[1:11:40] chills thinking about it because it's
[1:11:44] real this isn't a fable this is more
[1:11:47] real than the room we're sitting in you
[1:11:50] know so I thank God for his grace and uh
[1:11:54] I think of uh uh how that every one of
[1:11:56] the Apostles they gave their lives and
[1:11:59] and it wasn't like they just took a
[1:12:02] bullet and died they were the they died
[1:12:05] in the most horrible ways you know hung
[1:12:08] upside down hung sideways burnt and you
[1:12:12] know dismembered
[1:12:14] whatever and they did it with
[1:12:17] joy because they met the burning bush
[1:12:20] they met Christ you know there's um I
[1:12:24] Heard message a couple weeks back where
[1:12:27] brother Brandon was talking about this
[1:12:29] Infidel that was writing critical things
[1:12:32] about him and a man didn't believe in
[1:12:35] God and he said what kind of a God would
[1:12:38] it be that would during the Dark Ages
[1:12:40] would just sat and watch his disciples
[1:12:42] women you know what they went through
[1:12:44] and being the baby taken out and just
[1:12:48] horrible unspeakable things done to them
[1:12:52] and a God would sit there and just laugh
[1:12:54] and look at them
[1:12:55] it's because the man will never met the
[1:12:57] burning bush once you've met him see
[1:13:01] that's what proves that this gospel
[1:13:03] isn't real every single one of those
[1:13:06] disciples they went to the death with
[1:13:09] joy because it wasn't an intellectual
[1:13:12] concept it was a living being in here
[1:13:16] that energized their human Spirit their
[1:13:19] mind their body amen they were quickened
[1:13:22] by the Holy Ghost and it changed them
[1:13:24] into entirely made them different people
[1:13:27] so when Christ comes inside it it
[1:13:30] changes everything and I'm glad to be
[1:13:33] one of them today right we're one of
[1:13:36] them oh yeah one of them I'm so glad
[1:13:39] amen amen right brother we can say we're
[1:13:42] one of them so may this be a memorial
[1:13:45] day may it be a day we long
[1:13:47] remember
[1:13:49] um let's stand for a reading of one
[1:13:52] scripture please I want to turn to the
[1:13:54] Old Testament

[1:14:30] amen behold the days come sayith the
[1:14:33] Lord that I will a future tense I will

[1:14:48] the Covenant that I made with their
[1:14:50] fathers in the day this is this is
[1:14:52] heartbreaking in the day that I I took
[1:14:55] them by the
[1:14:57] hand to bring them out of the land of
[1:15:00] Egypt which Covenant my which my
[1:15:03] Covenant they break although I was in

[1:15:16] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:15:19] those days sayeth the Lord I will put my
[1:15:23] law in their inward parts and will write
[1:15:27] it in their hearts and they will and and

[1:15:35] people amen next verse and they shall
[1:15:37] teach no more uh every man his neighbor
[1:15:40] and every man is brother saying know the
[1:15:42] Lord for they shall all know me from the
[1:15:47] least of them unto the greatest of them

[1:15:53] iniquity and I will remember their sin
[1:15:57] no more oh praise God hallelujah it
[1:16:01] won't be a case where he makes a
[1:16:03] covenant with them and they break it
[1:16:06] where he's a husband and she's an
[1:16:09] Unfaithful wife but his law his word his
[1:16:12] love will be in her she has no other
[1:16:15] choice she will be led by that same one

[1:16:27] sufficient name of Jesus Christ we're so
[1:16:30] honored and blessed to be among these
[1:16:32] precious Believers here today Lord God

[1:16:38] thankful for your servant brother Smith
[1:16:40] and his family Lord God for the
[1:16:43] invitation to to invite us to come here
[1:16:46] and to partake of this uh Priceless word

[1:17:19] hover over them may the the life of God
[1:17:23] the canopy of life and sh them and fill
[1:17:26] their inner being with the person of the
[1:17:29] Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ Grant
[1:17:31] it father bless this day we pray in
[1:17:35] Jesus name amen amen amen you can be
[1:17:38] seated uh again I'm very thankful for
[1:17:41] your pastor we had a wonderful time when
[1:17:44] he came to our little assembly amen
[1:17:46] right amen and spoke for us and it it
[1:17:49] was tremendous uh and we both felt the
[1:17:53] same way all right we're kindred spirit
[1:17:54] Spirits you
[1:17:57] know I won't say it we're just Kindred
[1:18:03] Spirits so it's an honor to be
[1:18:06] here and we half went
[1:18:10] crazy when he was speaking in our church
[1:18:14] because he spoke about the life of
[1:18:16] Abraham there is no way that he knew
[1:18:19] that we had been going through the
[1:18:21] covenants of God and at that time we
[1:18:24] were talking about God's covenant with
[1:18:26] Abraham now how could he know that and
[1:18:28] he comes in and when he announces his
[1:18:31] subject I'm already done you know we're
[1:18:34] all looking at one another can you
[1:18:36] believe this you know what it's a holy
[1:18:38] spirit that's all you know you just
[1:18:40] trust him there's no you know big me big
[1:18:44] Minister you little no no no no no we're
[1:18:47] all the same in Christ right amen amen
[1:18:51] so we when you have a humble heart which
[1:18:54] if if you have the Holy Ghost he gives
[1:18:56] you a humble heart it's just that's one
[1:18:59] of the very first signs a person has
[1:19:00] received the Holy Spirit is humility you
[1:19:03] know you don't get some big idea about
[1:19:05] yourself you love one another preferring
[1:19:08] one another over yourself you know so
[1:19:11] that's the way I felt when he came so I
[1:19:13] said if if his congregation is like him
[1:19:17] we want to be there so amen so we're
[1:19:20] here uh in the name of the Lord so we
[1:19:23] had been at the uh Open Door Tabernacle
[1:19:26] we've been gloriously enjoying the uh
[1:19:30] eight covenants that God had made with
[1:19:33] his people there's seven of them in the
[1:19:36] Old Testament and there's one in the New
[1:19:39] Testament and in prayer meeting
[1:19:41] Wednesday night I was praying because I
[1:19:44] had it on my heart to come here today to
[1:19:46] speak about the Covenant that God made
[1:19:49] with Israel as they were about to go
[1:19:52] into the new land because the new new
[1:19:54] land Covenant pertains to us because
[1:19:59] Ephesians is in the New Testament as
[1:20:02] Joshua is in the Old Testament and
[1:20:04] there's a perfect blending there and
[1:20:06] then when you read the scriptures you
[1:20:08] realize oh my word this is my land in
[1:20:12] Ephesians and Colossians and all those
[1:20:15] things it's for
[1:20:17] us and we have to take that land with
[1:20:20] our sword and when the enemy comes we
[1:20:24] take the sword out and it's a daily
[1:20:26] fight amen yes sir yes sir but I've read
[1:20:29] the book I know who wins the war you
[1:20:31] know so you can fight with confidence
[1:20:34] right so that was on my heart to speak
[1:20:36] on but at prayer meeting Wednesday night
[1:20:40] it totally changed the Lord showed me no
[1:20:43] bring the New Covenant now I hadn't
[1:20:45] studied it yet I hadn't done anything
[1:20:48] about it and it's kind of jumping ahead
[1:20:51] out of order where we're at in in our
[1:20:54] church you you know so um I had been
[1:20:58] listening to the message I when I was
[1:21:01] working I I do U landscape design and
[1:21:04] construction and when I was out there
[1:21:06] working all week I was listening to the
[1:21:08] message um the unveiling of God and I
[1:21:12] just seen it just oh my talk about the O
[1:21:15] the open uh Covenant the the the New
[1:21:19] Covenant to us and how God unveils
[1:21:21] himself you know so we've been going
[1:21:23] through those um covenants and I just
[1:21:26] want to make a quick just a very quick
[1:21:29] review of them as we uh kind of set it
[1:21:32] up for the for the uh the New Covenant
[1:21:37] so the edenic Covenant that was the very
[1:21:40] first one of course that was in the
[1:21:42] Garden of Eden before sin before
[1:21:46] everything went sideways and God told
[1:21:49] Adam and Eve uh it's all
[1:21:52] yours they walked like uh uh if you will
[1:21:56] if you forgive the terminology like a
[1:21:58] God and a goddess on the earth they had
[1:22:01] everything everything was at their
[1:22:04] disposal they could speak and it would
[1:22:06] create like that you know uh whatever
[1:22:10] they said it happened because he was on
[1:22:12] the inside and they were fashioned to be
[1:22:16] he you imagine a direct Son of God you
[1:22:20] know how many thousands of generations
[1:22:22] are we past that he was a direct walked
[1:22:25] off the hand of God walking on the earth
[1:22:29] I bet he could tell us a thing or two
[1:22:31] about living one with God am but we know
[1:22:35] the story there had to be a fall yes sir
[1:22:39] there had to be so they're walking the
[1:22:42] Earth in this edenic Covenant and he
[1:22:45] said there just one thing don't add or
[1:22:48] take away from my word what I say I mean
[1:22:53] it so this tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:22:57] and Evil just stay away from it because
[1:23:00] the day that you eat thereof you're G to
[1:23:03] lose everything right isn't amazing that
[1:23:06] Satan is so
[1:23:08] slick that this first beautiful identic
[1:23:14] couple would fall for the lie of Satan
[1:23:17] how could you I can't even imagine it
[1:23:20] but that shows us in the last days how
[1:23:24] lick he is yes sir so don't take
[1:23:28] anything for great granted you you know
[1:23:31] we
[1:23:32] uh a good warrior has respect for their
[1:23:36] enemy they know his tactics they know
[1:23:40] he's uh very hard to beat you know in
[1:23:44] natural terms and so forth and the only
[1:23:46] way you can beat him is to know Satan at
[1:23:50] every one of his tricks you know this
[1:23:53] whole message comes to life when you
[1:23:54] start studying this stuff it's just
[1:23:56] beyond belief so anyhow so he said don't
[1:24:00] add don't take away from the word of
[1:24:01] course they did and uh Eve uh did her
[1:24:05] thing and and so everything fell
[1:24:08] apart and so God had to make another
[1:24:11] Covenant and he made the what we call
[1:24:14] the adamic Covenant in uh Genesis 3 and
[1:24:19] in that
[1:24:21] Covenant he
[1:24:23] promised a way of
[1:24:25] redemption that her seed would bruise
[1:24:29] his head and he would bruise your heel
[1:24:32] in that was a promise of
[1:24:36] redemption this is so phenomenal if you
[1:24:39] go to the third seal right um of the
[1:24:43] Seven Seals and I the newer ver uh book
[1:24:47] um it's uh of course I I'm still
[1:24:50] oldfashioned I read paper books you know
[1:24:53] I haven't graduated to all you young
[1:24:55] guys I I still do the E and everything
[1:24:59] um but it's uh page um 2115 to
[1:25:02] 234 where brother brandom in the third
[1:25:05] seal before he gets the actual seal he
[1:25:10] explains the adamic Covenant perfectly
[1:25:14] and you know what's so amazing is these
[1:25:17] covenants throughout the Bible brother
[1:25:20] Brenham never preached a series called
[1:25:23] the eight covenants right and if
[1:25:26] somebody's so ignorant that they think
[1:25:28] well he never preached them he sure did
[1:25:31] it's throughout the entire message you
[1:25:34] know did he tell us about Adam and Eve
[1:25:36] and what happened and and the promise of
[1:25:38] redemption there it is that's the adamic
[1:25:40] Covenant did he talk about Abraham in
[1:25:43] almost every message that's the
[1:25:45] abrahamic Covenant did he talk about
[1:25:47] Noah and as it was in the days of Noah
[1:25:50] Noah Noah Covenant Glory Glory I you
[1:25:54] know so it's all there but when you go
[1:25:57] to searching it out that way you begin
[1:25:59] to see this word crosssection one and
[1:26:02] another and it's just so exciting so in
[1:26:06] that third seal he says that God
[1:26:09] promised Eve that she would one day come
[1:26:14] back to the full
[1:26:15] word he promised her read it it it's on
[1:26:18] in the third seal what that mean she
[1:26:21] would finally come back to the full
[1:26:24] Dominion of Mark
[1:26:27] 11:23 this last day's Eve would come and
[1:26:30] it has can only be in the last days the
[1:26:34] first church had it yes they did first
[1:26:37] church had rapturing faith we know that
[1:26:39] and you know Philip was needed somewhere
[1:26:42] gone he was translated somewhere but the
[1:26:45] seed had to go in the ground and die
[1:26:47] just like Jesus did otherwise that would
[1:26:49] have been it they would have gone and it
[1:26:51] a story over but there were seeds yet in
[1:26:54] the earth that had to come
[1:26:56] forth in 2024 there were seeds yet to
[1:27:00] come forth praise God I'll never get to
[1:27:03] my topic here so amen the adamic
[1:27:06] Covenant promises that she'll come back
[1:27:09] Eve to Dominion on the earth like she
[1:27:13] did have and then of course the uh
[1:27:16] Covenant that God made with Noah after
[1:27:19] he uh flooded the Earth and of course
[1:27:22] the whole story of Noah is to us uh a
[1:27:27] sign of the last days his message his
[1:27:31] preaching for 120 years his building of
[1:27:34] the Ark all these things were types for
[1:27:36] us in the last days how he built the ark
[1:27:39] out of this U uh type of a wood that's
[1:27:43] like Balsam and then they took the rosin
[1:27:45] out of another which they had to beat
[1:27:47] the tree to get the rosin out and they
[1:27:50] pitched it which is the Holy Ghost am
[1:27:53] typing the Holy Spirit Spirit making
[1:27:55] that light pliable wood suddenly hard as
[1:27:58] steel but still light that could float
[1:28:01] through the storms oh man you know it
[1:28:04] it's so great so the whole story of Noah
[1:28:07] is for us in the last days and God tops
[1:28:10] it off with a covenant a rainbow
[1:28:13] Covenant which is half of what you see
[1:28:17] around the Throne of God because in the
[1:28:20] last days the half had not been told now
[1:28:24] the entire book is
[1:28:27] open glory amen praise God oh my so it's
[1:28:33] not going to be a flood anymore no more
[1:28:35] flood but next time it will be fire next
[1:28:40] time it's the baptism of fire as he does
[1:28:44] to the Earth so he does to the
[1:28:46] individual praise God that's the Noah
[1:28:48] Covenant God promised it with a sealed
[1:28:52] it with a rainbow glory to
[1:28:55] godj abrahamic Covenant God came down to
[1:28:58] Abraham and uh here's a famous quote
[1:29:02] from brother Jesse Smith I wrote it down
[1:29:05] when he was speaking he said the bride
[1:29:07] of Christ follows Abraham's life it's
[1:29:11] exactly right that's why we were jumping
[1:29:14] off our seats literally because we've
[1:29:17] been just going through Abraham's life
[1:29:19] and how that everything reel uhu uh
[1:29:22] Genesis 12 gen gen is uh 14 6 17 18 19
[1:29:29] 15 all these things the abrahamic
[1:29:32] Covenant and how that God had to come
[1:29:33] back and reiterate it and reiterate it
[1:29:36] and reiterate it and tell him it's going
[1:29:39] to
[1:29:40] happen so Lord amen Satan comes to your
[1:29:43] mind or you run up into problems just
[1:29:45] remember he what he promised he's going
[1:29:48] to do it's
[1:29:50] yours don't let any evil spirit talk you
[1:29:53] out out of it and God swore by
[1:29:57] himself God glory you see that that's
[1:30:02] for
[1:30:03] youlu my goodness he swore by himself
[1:30:06] that Abraham would have a son Isaac
[1:30:11] which is Jesus Christ amenah right the
[1:30:15] Royal Seed of Abraham and that that life
[1:30:19] of Abraham how God promised in his life
[1:30:23] we have
[1:30:24] the Salvation the sanctification you've
[1:30:27] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've
[1:30:29] got the new name you've got adoption
[1:30:33] you've got the
[1:30:34] Resurrection The Rapture all these
[1:30:37] things are in Abraham's life praise God
[1:30:42] and He swore by himself it's going to
[1:30:45] happen sure it was for Abraham in the
[1:30:48] natural but in the end time these things
[1:30:51] become ours amen a real promises for a
[1:30:54] real bride and every Redemptive act that
[1:30:59] uh Abraham lived out it's to the
[1:31:01] believer in this last days amen every
[1:31:05] Redemptive promise then of course uh
[1:31:08] when Israel uh finally uh in fulfillment
[1:31:12] of part of the abrahamic Covenant God
[1:31:15] sends
[1:31:17] Moses and he Moses wouldn't go until he
[1:31:21] met God and he met God he went down and
[1:31:24] and he led them and this is this is just
[1:31:27] heartbreaking again like he remember how
[1:31:30] he mentioned in Jeremiah 20 31 whose
[1:31:35] Covenant they break I was a husband to
[1:31:38] them and so forth so the Mosaic
[1:31:42] Covenant he brings Israel out of Egypt
[1:31:46] with a mighty hand that we're still
[1:31:48] talking about today it was so tremendous
[1:31:52] right and did all these things 10
[1:31:55] plagues on Egypt opens the Red Sea
[1:31:58] brings them through 3 days in Israel
[1:32:01] begin to complain and moan and
[1:32:04] cry right even in Egypt one time they
[1:32:08] wanted to pick up stones and kill
[1:32:10] Moses it's like what's wrong with you
[1:32:14] people you've seen all this and you
[1:32:16] still can't believe will you ever
[1:32:19] believe well we know that the long story
[1:32:22] is that they didn't they didn't go over
[1:32:25] but there was a new generation coming up
[1:32:28] they might not have been the ones that
[1:32:30] saw squirrels spoken into existence and
[1:32:32] all these things but they know it's real
[1:32:36] Hallelujah Glory a new
[1:32:39] generation rising up that knows God is
[1:32:42] real praise God oh my
[1:32:46] goodness and then when God came with the
[1:32:48] Mosaic Covenant and if you listen to
[1:32:52] look for all the messages brother Braham
[1:32:54] talks about the law versus Grace and all
[1:32:57] these things he says
[1:32:59] Israel see when when God came with
[1:33:03] covenants they cried out we'll obey
[1:33:06] every word you say sure you will they
[1:33:10] already proved they can't they already
[1:33:13] proved they should at that time they
[1:33:16] should have hit their knees and say God
[1:33:18] we can't follow any Covenant we need
[1:33:22] Grace gave Abraham Grace give us Grace
[1:33:26] we can't do it but brother brandham said
[1:33:29] they wanted a law so that they could
[1:33:33] make churches you know and form
[1:33:35] organizations and have a hierarchy of
[1:33:37] priests and Bishops and all this so that
[1:33:40] it became a nickan scene just like in
[1:33:44] the early church where they could rule
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:48] Le and lay down iron laws you must do
[1:33:51] this our word is God and and uh you know
[1:33:55] if Christ is in your heart you know
[1:33:57] where the word of God is first of all
[1:33:59] it's in here number
[1:34:02] one and if anybody conforms to this Word
[1:34:06] of Life great you're my brother if
[1:34:08] anybody preaches 99% of this and they so
[1:34:12] well now those days are past watch out
[1:34:15] you better hit the street fast right
[1:34:18] exactly so
[1:34:20] um the Mosaic Covenant but it brought
[1:34:23] the law laws of God by which one day God
[1:34:27] will judge the world so everything
[1:34:30] serves a purpose you know but think of
[1:34:33] how he gave that law with great
[1:34:37] Glory right the pillar of fire himself I
[1:34:41] love it on Ten Commandments right the
[1:34:43] pillar of fire himself came down and
[1:34:46] wrote the law with the Finger of God the
[1:34:50] glory of God was fully made manifest
[1:34:53] over the Old Testament the old Covenant
[1:34:58] the Mosaic Covenant the full glory of
[1:35:00] God was on
[1:35:02] display and Moses when he looked he
[1:35:05] couldn't see he blocked his view but
[1:35:08] then when he passed by he saw the back
[1:35:10] of a man and we'll touch on that in a
[1:35:12] little bit it's just so
[1:35:15] glorious oh my so Moses met the pillar
[1:35:19] of fire for the Old Testament you know
[1:35:21] we're going to hit something with that
[1:35:23] coming from forward now I'll try not to
[1:35:25] go more than four hours
[1:35:30] so I'm just kidding so they should have
[1:35:33] cried out we can't keep the law we need
[1:35:36] Grace that's what they should have done
[1:35:38] hey you think I can keep the
[1:35:41] law I need Grace every day
[1:35:46] amen you know brother Brandon preached a
[1:35:49] message called the message of Grace when
[1:35:53] I went went back and really listened to
[1:35:55] it it wasn't a message entitled the
[1:35:58] message of Grace he was telling us the
[1:36:00] entire message is a message of
[1:36:04] Grace the whole thing from beginning to
[1:36:07] end is nothing but the grace of God oh
[1:36:11] is so good it's Rich it's real glory so
[1:36:15] then the sixth one the land Covenant
[1:36:18] that's simply an extension of the
[1:36:20] abrahamic Covenant because now they've
[1:36:23] got
[1:36:24] Joshua they're about to go over Moses is
[1:36:28] is giving them their final instructions
[1:36:30] then God's about to take Moses up on
[1:36:32] Mount pisga and take him home and um so
[1:36:36] he tells them wait let me just read hold
[1:36:39] on a minute just for a second here
[1:36:42] Deuteronomy uh 30 I I just love this
[1:36:45] because it speaks of the coming new
[1:36:48] covenant in Deuteronomy uh 30 on uh
[1:36:53] verse five he says and the Lord thy God
[1:36:56] will bring thee into the
[1:36:59] land which thy father is possessed
[1:37:02] talking about Abraham and so forth and
[1:37:05] thou shalt possess it and he will do
[1:37:07] thee good and multiply thee above thy
[1:37:10] fathers and the Lord thy God will
[1:37:13] circumcise thine heart there it
[1:37:16] isise there's a new covenant coming down
[1:37:19] the road see and that Prophet Moses when
[1:37:23] prophets look and brother Bram the same
[1:37:25] thing when they see the
[1:37:27] mountaintops sometimes it looks like the
[1:37:30] mountains are merging you know they see
[1:37:32] this Advent and that advent so here's
[1:37:35] Moses looking into the promised land but
[1:37:37] he sees a Time coming when God was going
[1:37:40] to circumcise their hearts God that
[1:37:43] couldn't happen until the New Covenant
[1:37:46] praise God glory circumcise thine uh
[1:37:50] thine heart and the Heart of thy seed
[1:37:54] to love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:37:57] heart with all thy soul that thou mayest
[1:38:00] live and then jumping down to uh verse
[1:38:03] 11 for this commandment which I command
[1:38:06] me thee this day it is not hidden from
[1:38:10] thee neither is it far off it is not in
[1:38:14] heaven that thou should say who shall go
[1:38:16] up for us to heaven and bring it unto us
[1:38:19] that we may hear it and do it neither is
[1:38:22] it Beyond the sea that thou should say
[1:38:25] who shall go over the sea for us and
[1:38:27] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[1:38:30] do it doesn't that sound like Jesus if
[1:38:32] they say Lo here or low there or loow
[1:38:36] it's in the desert or it's in this
[1:38:38] country or it's over there don't
[1:38:42] go because the word is with you even in
[1:38:45] you amen praise God but the word is very
[1:38:50] nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thine
[1:38:53] heart heart that thou mayest do it
[1:38:55] praise God see I have set before thee
[1:39:00] this day life and good death and evil in
[1:39:04] that I command thee this day to love
[1:39:07] isn't that beautiful didn't Jesus do the
[1:39:10] same thing to love the Lord thy God to
[1:39:13] walk in his ways to keep his
[1:39:15] Commandments and his statutes and his
[1:39:17] judgments that thou mayest live and
[1:39:20] multiply and the Lord thy God shall
[1:39:23] shall bless thee in the land with thou
[1:39:27] goest to possess it there's a land
[1:39:29] Covenant in a nutshell right there amen
[1:39:32] so you can see how these covenants they
[1:39:36] blend every one of them with the New
[1:39:38] Covenant and then of course the davidic
[1:39:41] Covenant was the last of the New
[1:39:43] Testament Covenant and the story of that
[1:39:46] is so beautiful because here's David
[1:39:49] he's got a heart after God right and
[1:39:51] he's like Lord I just want to do
[1:39:53] whatever ever I can for you and he and
[1:39:55] the Lord put it in his heart to build
[1:39:58] him a house you know so he goes to the
[1:40:01] Lord and then uh the prophet Nathan says
[1:40:04] look just do whatever is in your heart
[1:40:07] God is with you and he knew it that God
[1:40:09] was with him and so that night then God
[1:40:14] came to Nathan and said go tell my
[1:40:16] servant David you want to build me a
[1:40:19] house I'm going to build you a house
[1:40:24] isn't that just
[1:40:26] beautifulall he loved his wishes his
[1:40:28] will so much that he said thy seed will
[1:40:32] build me a house of course Solomon was
[1:40:35] the one to build the house but more than
[1:40:38] that the seed the son of David Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ and think of this beyond that I I
[1:40:47] son of David Jesus I go to prepare a
[1:40:51] place for you
[1:40:56] we want to give him our Temple right
[1:40:58] this is yours Lord he said I've got a
[1:41:01] temple for you you can't even imagine my
[1:41:05] the the mind can't conceive what it's
[1:41:08] like when you go over there so here amen
[1:41:13] so David uh I'll build you a house and
[1:41:17] of his lineage will come the Messiah but
[1:41:19] you know he was the last king all the
[1:41:22] kings
[1:41:24] uh were crowned of the lineage of David
[1:41:26] were crowned in
[1:41:28] Jerusalem the last king to be crowned in
[1:41:31] Jerusalem was Jesus but they crowned him
[1:41:35] with a crown of
[1:41:37] thorns my my my my my this gospel road
[1:41:42] is not a road of uh flowers and just
[1:41:46] good times and my goodness amen he's our
[1:41:50] example friends Hallelujah
[1:41:54] so then now the eighth one the eighth
[1:41:57] Covenant This is So Glorious so the
[1:42:00] eighth Covenant the New Covenant it's
[1:42:03] the only one in the in the New Testament
[1:42:06] why because it is the New
[1:42:12] Testament my goodness Hallelujah it is
[1:42:16] the New Covenant Testament means
[1:42:18] Covenant it's the same word
[1:42:21] interchangeable now as I told you on um
[1:42:24] Wednesday night I'd been praying and the
[1:42:26] Lord said no speak on this so kind of
[1:42:28] venturing into territory here I haven't
[1:42:31] done before but um among friends so if I
[1:42:35] Stumble and fall it'll be all
[1:42:37] right praise God but you know as I begin
[1:42:41] to really uh look at this and so
[1:42:44] forth I like uh last night this morning
[1:42:49] early I feel like uh joob how he
[1:42:54] said I'm just
[1:42:58] dust I come before almighty God who am I
[1:43:02] you know I'm going to lay my hand on my
[1:43:04] mouth and say nothing anymore when I
[1:43:07] begin to the look into the glory of this
[1:43:09] New
[1:43:10] Covenant or or like um Abraham remember
[1:43:14] when he was there and he was praying and
[1:43:16] talking to the Lord and interceding for
[1:43:19] lot which is Us in this day intercede
[1:43:22] for your family amilies and so forth
[1:43:24] your friends but he said I have taken it
[1:43:28] upon myself to speak to the god of ab
[1:43:31] the god of Heaven who am I each time
[1:43:34] when he went to as it were bargain with
[1:43:37] god well what if there's 40 what if
[1:43:40] there's 35 you know and he's like I've
[1:43:43] taken it upon myself to talk to this
[1:43:45] king the king of the universe and when I
[1:43:48] looked into this thing I'm like I've
[1:43:50] taken it upon myself to talk about this
[1:43:53] Eternal
[1:43:56] Covenant well you better have Sanctified
[1:43:58] lips that's all I can say you better
[1:44:00] have the Holy Spirit living in you
[1:44:03] Hallelujah this is sacred
[1:44:05] territory amen so I'm going to read a
[1:44:08] few scriptures now about the New
[1:44:10] Covenant we read the first one out of
[1:44:12] Jeremiah 31 and I want you to notice the
[1:44:16] numerology
[1:44:17] here God wanted us to see this and
[1:44:22] understand
[1:44:24] the number eight right it speaks of the
[1:44:27] new creation it speaks of Eternity it
[1:44:31] speaks of going back to the beginning uh
[1:44:33] It's A Perfect Circle Number Eight
[1:44:35] there's nothing beyond that amen so God
[1:44:39] positioned it so in the Bible that the
[1:44:41] New Covenant spoken of in the Old
[1:44:43] Testament is in Jeremiah
[1:44:46] 3131 four and four is
[1:44:50] eight right and then Jes Jesus begins to
[1:44:54] talk about it in Matthew
[1:44:57] 26 verse
[1:44:59] 26 8 and 8 and in the book of Hebrews
[1:45:04] guess where it's at Hebrews
[1:45:07] 88 three is a
[1:45:09] witness there's nothing Beyond this
[1:45:13] Covenant this is all you'll ever need
[1:45:16] Glory so let's get into it amen so Jesus
[1:45:20] Matthew 26
[1:45:24] he says um uh starting here verse
[1:45:30] 26 amen and as they were eating Jesus
[1:45:34] Took bread and blessed it and break it
[1:45:38] and gave it to the disciples and said
[1:45:40] take eat this is my body and he took the
[1:45:46] cup and gave thanks and gave it to them
[1:45:48] saying drink ye all of it for this is my
[1:45:53] blood of the new
[1:45:56] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:46:00] remission of sins and if you have a
[1:46:03] margin in your Bible uh I have a
[1:46:06] scoffield Bible and the it has the
[1:46:08] letter uh there which means uh New
[1:46:12] Covenant Testament and Covenant is the
[1:46:14] same word amen I want to turn uh to
[1:46:18] Hebrews 8 so this is a blood Covenant
[1:46:22] yes amen all right this is no light
[1:46:24] thing you know you can skip over you
[1:46:26] skip over this you just skipped over
[1:46:28] eternal life CU this is the all of it
[1:46:30] now amen this is dead serious Hebrews 8
[1:46:34] and turning to uh verse
[1:46:42] 8 and here it
[1:46:45] is uh we we'll go back a few uh
[1:46:49] verses we'll go to verse six but now now
[1:46:53] hath he obtained a more excellent
[1:46:55] Ministry by how much also he is the
[1:46:59] mediator of a better Covenant which was
[1:47:03] established upon better promises for if
[1:47:07] that first Covenant had been faultless
[1:47:10] then should no place have been sought
[1:47:13] for the second for finding fault with
[1:47:16] them he saith behold the days come saeth
[1:47:21] the Lord when I will make a New Covenant
[1:47:25] with the house of Israel and with the
[1:47:27] house of Judah see he's not just making
[1:47:29] it with Israel he's making it with Judah
[1:47:31] too so none of the Seed of Abraham
[1:47:33] misses out amen he wants to be sure that
[1:47:36] the Royal Seed of Abraham doesn't miss
[1:47:39] out on this
[1:47:40] Covenant amen and with the house of
[1:47:43] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[1:47:45] I made with their fathers in the day
[1:47:48] when I took them by the hand to lead
[1:47:50] them out of the land of Egypt because
[1:47:53] they continued not in my Covenant and I
[1:47:56] regarded them not sayeth the Lord for
[1:47:59] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:48:01] with the house of Israel after those
[1:48:03] days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws
[1:48:06] into their mind and will write them in
[1:48:10] their hearts and I will be to them a God
[1:48:13] and they will be to me a people see
[1:48:15] here's St Paul now placing it in the
[1:48:19] giving us understanding of what this new
[1:48:22] covenant is is which is the New
[1:48:25] Testament the the uh Matthew Mark Luke
[1:48:29] and John they were scribes they wrote
[1:48:31] what they saw but
[1:48:34] Paul he and I I'm going to get into this
[1:48:37] amen Moses met the pillar of fire there
[1:48:41] were all the other Patriarchs and
[1:48:43] Prophets and so forth but when Moses met
[1:48:45] the pillar of fire he wrote the
[1:48:48] Bible Genesis Exodus you know the Torah
[1:48:52] he wrote quot the Bible once meeting the
[1:48:55] pillar of fire St Paul met the same
[1:48:58] Pillar of Fire and St Paul wrote the New
[1:49:02] Testament wrote the New Covenant he
[1:49:06] broke it out and explained it the same
[1:49:09] Pillar of Fire now oh my
[1:49:12] goodness you got a painting in the
[1:49:14] office there of that same Pillar of Fire
[1:49:18] coming back in the last
[1:49:21] days to take this New Covenant and put
[1:49:25] it in your
[1:49:27] hearts he came back in a pillar of fire
[1:49:31] a son of man man I'm getting way ahead
[1:49:34] of myself here a son of man revealed
[1:49:38] Jesus the son of man which is the new
[1:49:42] land amen that's the land Covenant to
[1:49:45] take you into the promises of God but it
[1:49:48] had to be the same Pillar of Fire and I
[1:49:51] didn't understand it that way until I
[1:49:53] heard uh the unveiling of God he
[1:49:56] explained it on there thoroughly very
[1:49:57] thoroughly and I was just floored
[1:50:00] Hallelujah so here's St Paul doing just
[1:50:02] that he met God went on a road to
[1:50:06] Damascus right and then went in the
[1:50:08] wilderness and God opened the word to
[1:50:11] him amen we must do the same how you
[1:50:17] ever going to know unless you're
[1:50:18] constantly in the word reading and
[1:50:20] praying and seeking the Lord
[1:50:23] right so he says I'll put my laws in
[1:50:26] their mind and write them on their
[1:50:28] hearts I will be to them a God and they
[1:50:31] shall be to me a people and they shall
[1:50:33] not teach every man his neighbor and
[1:50:35] every man his brother saying no the Lord
[1:50:37] For All Shall know me from the least to
[1:50:40] the greatest for I will be merciful to
[1:50:43] their unrighteousness and their sins and
[1:50:46] their iniquities will I remember no more
[1:50:49] that is music to my ears amen Amen in in
[1:50:54] that he saith a New Covenant he hath
[1:50:57] made the first old now that which
[1:51:00] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[1:51:03] vanish away and in Hebrews here and in
[1:51:06] Corinthians and just everywhere Paul
[1:51:09] writes he explains how we've
[1:51:11] transitioned from the Mosaic Covenant
[1:51:14] into the New Covenant you see so
[1:51:17] um uh for a title I'm calling this the
[1:51:22] eternal
[1:51:23] Covenant because it is eternal this
[1:51:25] reaches from here clear over to the new
[1:51:29] city everything all through the
[1:51:32] Millennium the his coming on a white
[1:51:35] horse with the sword the final judgment
[1:51:38] right the white Throne judgment beyond
[1:51:41] all that beyond the 144,000 beyond the
[1:51:46] uh Jews being saved and rescued and and
[1:51:49] Christ coming for them as well right and
[1:51:52] bringing them home uh Joseph to his
[1:51:55] Brethren and then taking us right the
[1:51:59] bride with Christ judging the world
[1:52:02] passed all that all the way into the new
[1:52:05] city why why do you say that because the
[1:52:08] Book of Revelation is the revelation of
[1:52:12] Jesus
[1:52:13] Christ and the revelation of Jesus
[1:52:16] Christ is the New Covenant amen
[1:52:20] hallelujah oh my my my so amen so let me
[1:52:24] read uh Hebrews 9 I've got right written
[1:52:27] here to read Hebrews
[1:52:30] 911 uh nine okay here but Christ
[1:52:34] becoming an high priest of good things
[1:52:36] to come by a greater and more perfect
[1:52:40] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[1:52:42] to say not of this building neither by
[1:52:46] the blood of goats and calves but by his
[1:52:49] own blood he entered in once into the
[1:52:53] holy Place having obtained Eternal there
[1:52:56] it is eternal Redemption for us so it's
[1:53:01] not like forever for a space of time

[1:53:08] Covenant for if the blood of bulls and
[1:53:10] of goats and the ashes of a heer and
[1:53:12] sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to
[1:53:15] the purifying of the flesh that's the
[1:53:17] Mosaic Covenant how much
[1:53:20] more shall the blood of Christ who
[1:53:24] through the eternal spirit God offer
[1:53:29] himself without spot to God Purge your
[1:53:32] conscience from dead Works to serve the

[1:53:47] of death for the Redemption of the
[1:53:50] transgression that were under the first
[1:53:52] first testament the Old Testament they
[1:53:55] which are called might receive the
[1:53:58] promise of

[1:54:36] all the prophets and he says how they

[1:54:43] these all see they were under the Old
[1:54:46] Testament the old Covenant these all
[1:54:48] having obtained a good report through
[1:54:51] faith

[1:54:56] promise they were still under the blood
[1:54:58] of bulls goats Cales lambs and so forth
[1:55:03] but they couldn't receive the full
[1:55:04] promise yet because he hadn't come and
[1:55:08] he says in verse 40 God having provided

[1:55:15] what it does that they without us should

[1:56:54] Words which voice that they heard they
[1:56:57] that heard intreated that the word
[1:56:59] should not be spoken to them anymore for
[1:57:03] they could not endure that which was
[1:57:05] commanded see they couldn't and if so
[1:57:08] much as a beast touch the mountain it or
[1:57:10] it shall be stoned or thrust through

[1:57:15] so terrible was the sight that Moses

[1:57:33] right out amen these are the it's a
[1:57:36] fearful thing to fall into the hand of

[1:58:56] thank you Jesus his blood speaks to us
[1:58:59] today so
[1:59:01] what I'll I wanted to read a few things
[1:59:04] in a little bit out of second
[1:59:06] Corinthians and so forth and also out of
[1:59:08] the unveiling of God and where are we
[1:59:10] are 20 of 19 of um let me just hit this
[1:59:14] here so every
[1:59:16] Covenant that God made in the Old
[1:59:18] Testament comes
[1:59:20] alive under the new Covenant because the
[1:59:24] identic Covenant right uh just stay
[1:59:28] where you are do the right thing you got
[1:59:30] Dominion don't mess it up
[1:59:34] right but under the New
[1:59:37] Covenant you never messed it
[1:59:41] up you never did it in the first
[1:59:47] place you are thoroughly restored back
[1:59:51] to an Eden
[1:59:53] condition speak and their word is
[1:59:56] backed and they lay their hands on the
[1:59:58] sick they shall
[2:00:00] recover right they shall cast out Devils
[2:00:03] they shall speak with new tongues that's
[2:00:05] in the New Covenant Mark 16 if you want
[2:00:08] to look it up amen uh also um Mark chap
[2:00:13] 11 look it up it's all part of the new
[2:00:16] promise the New Covenant the New
[2:00:18] Testament praise God so we are restored
[2:00:22] back to the
[2:00:23] identic condition under the identic
[2:00:26] Covenant in the adamic Covenant the full
[2:00:29] word is restored to Eve the whole
[2:00:33] promise the whole package everything
[2:00:37] that we lost in the fall is restored
[2:00:39] back because God promised to Eve you're
[2:00:43] not going to be like this
[2:00:44] forever I love you I will restore you
[2:00:48] back all the years right where you went
[2:00:51] through all kind of things as the
[2:00:53] individual you've gone through all kind
[2:00:54] of stuff I will restore all that you
[2:00:57] lost and bride of Christ I will restore
[2:01:01] to you everything that you had in the
[2:01:03] Garden of Eden that's his promise
[2:01:05] Hallelujah and more than that you're
[2:01:07] going to bruise his head on your way out
[2:01:10] of here you're going to kick him off the
[2:01:13] the the cart going up amen amen you're
[2:01:17] free in Christ you are totally free the
[2:01:20] adamic Covenant becomes a reality to you
[2:01:23] amen and God swore with a by a rainbow
[2:01:26] Covenant to Noah right that as it was in
[2:01:30] the days of Noah so when God prepared
[2:01:34] had Noah prepare the ark with pitch and
[2:01:37] the wood so this bride is preparing her
[2:01:40] arkc by the word to be carried out of
[2:01:44] this world but more than that he said as
[2:01:47] it was in the days of Noah that links
[2:01:51] the Covenant of Noah to the last days so
[2:01:55] shall it be in the day when the son of
[2:01:58] man is
[2:01:59] revealed and like I said it's crazy
[2:02:01] world out there it's clown world had to
[2:02:04] be like that those conditions had to be
[2:02:07] here before the bride goes so when we
[2:02:10] look at it and it just Grieves your
[2:02:12] heart how could intelligent people think
[2:02:15] or believe this total anti-science
[2:02:19] nonsense they reject common bi ology and
[2:02:22] they they've lost their minds had it be
[2:02:25] that
[2:02:26] way days of Noah in the son of man yes a
[2:02:32] son of man revealed the son of man that
[2:02:35] son of man is there now enjoying
[2:02:38] everything that he told us about what
[2:02:40] it's like but the son of man is here in
[2:02:43] this
[2:02:44] church oh my goodness
[2:02:48] Hallelujah the son of man is walking
[2:02:51] around the seats right now amen praise
[2:02:54] God as it was in the days of Noah so
[2:02:57] shall it be in this day and he swore and
[2:03:00] put a rainbow out there and there's a
[2:03:02] rainbow around your Covenant a full
[2:03:05] rainbow because he looked at Jesus in
[2:03:08] Revelation one right and there was a
[2:03:10] rainbow about his head oh my
[2:03:13] goodness and you were in his right hand
[2:03:16] Seven Stars glory to God oh my word
[2:03:22] and then the uh abrahamic Covenant Every
[2:03:25] Blessing every Redemptive blessing that
[2:03:27] he gave to Abraham is ours now through
[2:03:31] this uh New Covenant every single one
[2:03:34] every promise he had given to Abraham in
[2:03:37] type is that was the type the type is
[2:03:42] pointing to something yes that was the
[2:03:45] type but you're the reality of it amen
[2:03:48] the abrahamic Covenant and as I
[2:03:51] mentioned before with the Mosaic
[2:03:53] Covenant that becomes real to us because
[2:03:56] like I said Moses met the pillar of fire
[2:03:59] and wrote the word right and he had to
[2:04:02] write the Mosaic Covenant and he wrote
[2:04:05] the first five books of the Bible the
[2:04:07] Finger of God that means something to us
[2:04:10] because that same identical finger comes
[2:04:14] back and writes the word in your
[2:04:18] heart only not on tables of stone but on
[2:04:21] the the fleshy tables of your heart
[2:04:24] glory to God
[2:04:26] hallelujah glory and then we inherit in
[2:04:29] the land Covenant we inherit the new
[2:04:32] land the son of man Christ amen
[2:04:36] revealing himself as he did through a
[2:04:39] son of man I don't know but he's still
[2:04:42] revealing himself I go through these
[2:04:44] here messages and every time I pick it
[2:04:46] up it's a new
[2:04:48] message it is the word just keeps
[2:04:50] opening and
[2:04:52] opening brother brandham isn't doing
[2:04:54] that the Holy Ghost is doing that
[2:04:57] because that same Pillar of Fire that
[2:05:00] Moses wrote the word that Paul wrote the
[2:05:02] word brought and restored back the word
[2:05:05] same one same one Glory Hallelujah Glory
[2:05:10] that Pillar of Fire is
[2:05:12] here don't look for it with your natural
[2:05:16] eye
[2:05:17] amen amen every mystery every former
[2:05:23] mystery pertaining to Redemption has
[2:05:26] been revealed amen they were former
[2:05:29] Mysteries but they're a reality now amen
[2:05:31] that's what makes you happy that's why
[2:05:34] we're so happy we look half crazy to
[2:05:37] people because it's been
[2:05:39] revealed amen and he said I love you
[2:05:42] bride all this is yours and it's not
[2:05:45] like a promise a far off someday it's
[2:05:47] going to come this is living T present
[2:05:49] tense reality
[2:05:51] right now in you is the power to speak
[2:05:55] the word in you right now remember what
[2:05:58] was one of the earlier messages and he
[2:06:00] said in you right now is your
[2:06:05] Resurrection imagine
[2:06:07] that the resurrection is in you right
[2:06:10] now it's not hyperbole or whatever you
[2:06:13] want to call it that's God that's his
[2:06:16] word praise God whatever God says is
[2:06:19] going to happen is that in you
[2:06:21] uh 1 Thessalonians 4 is that in you then
[2:06:24] the resurrection is in you through the
[2:06:27] New Covenant glory to God hallelujah
[2:06:32] because under the land Covenant like I
[2:06:35] said it's the Ephesians land that's the
[2:06:39] new land amen
[2:06:41] Joshua typed the Holy Ghost and he led
[2:06:45] them into the new land today because
[2:06:49] Moses had to go the one who met the fire
[2:06:52] he had to go back and be with God and
[2:06:55] his people
[2:06:56] right but Joshua which typed the Holy
[2:06:59] Ghost he led them
[2:07:02] over all right goodness where is Joshua

[2:10:19] Amplified as the word of of God you
[2:10:22] understand but we still we can
[2:10:25] definitely Garner some great things off
[2:10:27] of it oh my it's all already nine nine
[2:10:30] of well I'll wrap this up soon but right
[2:10:33] now we're in the thick of it all right
[2:10:36] this is too good this is wonderful
[2:10:39] amen well I could read 2 Corinthians 3
[2:10:43] out of the King
[2:10:46] James I'll just hit a a few verses out
[2:10:49] of the King James and I'll read the
[2:10:50] whole thing out of the U Amplified verse
[2:10:54] three well verse two ye are our epistle
[2:10:57] written in our hearts known and read of
[2:11:01] all men for as much as you are
[2:11:03] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[2:11:06] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[2:11:10] ink here it is the Finger of God but
[2:11:13] with the spirit of the Living God not in
[2:11:18] tables of stone but in the fleshy tables
[2:11:22] of the
[2:11:23] heart and such trust have we through
[2:11:26] Christ to God word see it's all through
[2:11:29] Christ amen um not that we are
[2:11:33] sufficient of ourselves to think
[2:11:35] anything as of ourselves right we're not
[2:11:39] going to think of ourselves higher than
[2:11:41] we we ought to but our sufficiency is of
[2:11:44] God who also hath made us able Ministers
[2:11:50] of the the New
[2:11:53] Testament he's made us Ministers of the
[2:11:57] New Covenant when you talk to somebody
[2:12:00] when you're witnessing to somebody about
[2:12:02] Jesus to come to Christ you're a
[2:12:04] minister of the New Covenant
[2:12:07] amen when you're just living a Christian
[2:12:10] Life out there in the street you're a
[2:12:11] minister of the New Covenant every one
[2:12:13] of you young old child doesn't matter
[2:12:17] amen amen so here's St Paul saying it
[2:12:21] now
[2:12:21] my goodness and he's saying don't think
[2:12:23] higher of me than you ought to but I'm a
[2:12:25] minister of this New Covenant oh my
[2:12:27] goodness and he sure was because he met
[2:12:30] that Pillar of Fire to tell us what it
[2:12:32] was able Ministers of the New Testament
[2:12:36] not of the leather letter but of the
[2:12:39] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[2:12:43] giveth life you can have the word the
[2:12:45] word the word and word until the Holy
[2:12:48] Ghost comes it's just going to be dead
[2:12:50] letter
[2:12:51] but when the Holy Spirit gets into the
[2:12:54] word it quickens your mortal body and it
[2:12:57] lives out Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[2:13:01] so he says then the old Covenant but if
[2:13:03] the ministration of death written and
[2:13:05] engraven in Stones was glorious so that
[2:13:09] the children of Israel could not
[2:13:11] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[2:13:14] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[2:13:17] was to be done away you imagine that how
[2:13:20] shall not the ministration of the spirit
[2:13:24] be rather
[2:13:26] glorious see the New Covenant is the
[2:13:28] Holy Ghost amen amen the New Covenant
[2:13:33] was explained displayed and poured out
[2:13:38] on the day of
[2:13:40] Pentecost right Jesus went gave the
[2:13:44] offering paid your price in mine then he
[2:13:49] wasn't done he went down to Hell and
[2:13:50] took the keys of death and Hell Rose up
[2:13:54] took paradise and took that to
[2:13:57] Glory then comes down and is
[2:14:01] resurrected with the keys of death and
[2:14:03] Hell walks around with his disciples in
[2:14:06] a resurrection Ministry to what did
[2:14:09] Jesus do for that whole time what did he
[2:14:11] do he pointed them to the
[2:14:16] word many he says how how all when Jesus
[2:14:19] met with them he opened open to them
[2:14:21] their understanding that they might
[2:14:24] understand brother Jones's Revelation no
[2:14:27] that they might understand the
[2:14:31] scriptures and that's all the Holy Ghost
[2:14:33] is going to do amen he's not going to
[2:14:35] give you some understanding of some
[2:14:37] whack out thing he's going to give you
[2:14:39] understanding of the word of God why
[2:14:42] because he wrote the word of God and the
[2:14:45] ministration of the Holy Ghost writes
[2:14:47] the word of God in your heart and mind
[2:14:49] amen praise the Lord God it's always the
[2:14:52] Holy Spirit not not just the letter of
[2:14:57] the word it's so you need to know the
[2:15:00] word you need to read and study the word
[2:15:03] on your knees and wait for Divine Light
[2:15:05] but until it's a holy ghost anointing
[2:15:08] the word you got a lot of head knowledge
[2:15:10] you can go in uh you can go into some
[2:15:13] ministerial conference and argue quots
[2:15:15] with people and that'll get you
[2:15:18] nowhere like I I I wrote some poor
[2:15:21] brother that was going down some rabbit
[2:15:23] hole on some uh thing and uh but I knew
[2:15:27] this that this poor brother he had
[2:15:29] prayed for people nobody got healed no
[2:15:32] there was no power I said brother all
[2:15:35] kid aside I'm like St Paul said don't
[2:15:39] show me your words show me your
[2:15:42] power is what you're talking about real
[2:15:45] well then it's got to manifest itself
[2:15:48] you don't have to manifest anything
[2:15:51] if your heart and life belongs to Jesus
[2:15:54] Christ he will manifest himself I don't
[2:15:57] have to vindicate
[2:16:00] anything it's been Vindicated the world
[2:16:03] around this word is thus sayith the Lord
[2:16:07] all I have to do is be yield to the
[2:16:10] spirit and allow the spirit to conform
[2:16:12] me to that word then you become a uh
[2:16:19] manifested written
[2:16:22] epistle you become the word Jesus Christ
[2:16:25] manifest on two feet to your parents to
[2:16:30] your coworker to those that have need of
[2:16:33] you know the days of the big revivals we
[2:16:35] know that's over over you know this

[2:16:50] Church Church kicked him out in 64 when

[2:17:00] and the other right and then God sent
[2:17:03] the earthquake in Alaska Good

[2:19:14] um if a man will completely yield
[2:19:17] himself to God he that man is om om
[2:19:21] nipotent think about that

[2:20:17] like Peter and the rest of them I would
[2:20:19] have run scared yes sir
[2:20:21] right but you know what it's different
[2:20:23] when he comes and then lives because
[2:20:26] that same Peter was crucified upside
[2:20:31] down he said I'm not worthy to be
[2:20:33] crucified like my w Lord did he didn't
[2:20:35] run then he ran to the Cross oh my
[2:20:40] that's what he does he changes your way

[2:20:48] is here right now oh my goodness I'm
[2:20:52] going to read this here this New
[2:20:55] Covenant I was going to read so many
[2:20:57] quotes uh I maybe maybe I'll make a part
[2:21:01] two and send it to
[2:21:03] you all right but I want to read this
[2:21:06] New Covenant which brother Cuts told me
[2:21:08] to read out of the uh out of the
[2:21:10] Amplified version because you know how's
[2:21:14] I as I said the holy spirit is Jesus
[2:21:17] Christ that's what Paul says he says it
[2:21:19] right in uh
[2:21:24] verse 17 now the Lord Jesus the Lord is
[2:21:28] that spirit amen it's one and the same
[2:21:32] Christ is the Holy Ghost oh my goodness
[2:21:36] Christ is Joshua the Holy Ghost is
[2:21:39] Joshua to lead us to this Promised Land
[2:21:43] the New
[2:21:45] Covenant he says here the Amplified are
[2:21:49] we starting to commend our ourselves
[2:21:51] again or do we need some false teachers
[2:21:56] letters of recommendation to you or from
[2:21:59] you no you are our letter of
[2:22:02] recommendation written in our hearts
[2:22:05] recognized and read by everyone you show
[2:22:09] that you are a letter from Christ
[2:22:10] delivered by US Written not with ink but
[2:22:13] with the spirit of the Living God not in
[2:22:16] tables of stone but on tablets of human
[2:22:19] hearts such is the confidence and
[2:22:22] steadfast Reliance and absolute truth
[2:22:25] that we have through Christ toward God
[2:22:27] not that we are sufficiently qualified
[2:22:30] in ourselves to claim anything as coming
[2:22:34] from us but our sufficiency and
[2:22:37] qualifications come from God Amen he has
[2:22:41] qualified US making us sufficient as
[2:22:44] Ministers of a New Covenant and that's
[2:22:47] what the that's the heading here above
[2:22:50] this chap chapter in the Amplified it
[2:22:52] says Ministers of a New Covenant all
[2:22:55] Ministers of a New Covenant of Salvation
[2:22:58] through Christ not of the letter of a
[2:23:01] written code but of the spirit for the
[2:23:04] letter of the law kills by revealing sin
[2:23:08] and demanding obedience but the spirit
[2:23:11] gives life now if the ministry of death
[2:23:15] engraved in letters on Stones The
[2:23:18] Covenant of the law which led to death
[2:23:20] because of sin came with such glory and
[2:23:23] Splendor that the Israelites were not
[2:23:27] able to look steadily on the face of
[2:23:29] Moses because of its Glory a Brilliance
[2:23:33] that was
[2:23:34] fading how will the ministry of the
[2:23:38] spirit the New Covenant which allows us
[2:23:41] to be spirit filled oh the New Covenant
[2:23:45] is a baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[2:23:48] take that away from me brother
[2:23:51] amen prise God Amen I'm so glad that
[2:23:54] ministers don't have a heaven they don't
[2:23:57] have a hell they don't have nothing that
[2:23:59] they can give or take away you just need
[2:24:01] to conform to the word you can only do
[2:24:04] that by Jesus Christ amen glory amen
[2:24:09] okay uh for the ministry of condemnation
[2:24:11] the old Covenant of the law has Glory
[2:24:13] how much more does TH does glory
[2:24:17] overflow in the ministry that brings
[2:24:20] righteousness the New Covenant which de
[2:24:24] declares Believers free of guilt and
[2:24:28] sets them apart for God's special
[2:24:31] purpose indeed what had Glory the law in
[2:24:36] this case no longer has Glory because
[2:24:40] the glory that surpasses it the gospel
[2:24:45] see the the glory that was in the law is
[2:24:48] now eclipsed and overshadowed by the
[2:24:51] glory of Christ in the gospel for that
[2:24:55] for if that law which Fades away came
[2:24:58] with Glory how much more must that
[2:25:02] gospel which remains is permanent abide
[2:25:07] in glory and
[2:25:09] Splendor I think of that imagine and
[2:25:11] Moses cried for a for give me a give me
[2:25:15] a greater Vision Lord and here comes God
[2:25:17] himself right Pillar of Fire and and
[2:25:20] that was the glory to be passed away
[2:25:22] because there was a greater see we don't
[2:25:25] realize who we are we really didn't
[2:25:28] remember he said something like one day
[2:25:31] she'll realize who she is and when she
[2:25:34] does then the Rapture will
[2:25:37] go that Glory that Splendor on Mount Si
[2:25:41] all of that writing the law the whole
[2:25:43] Mountain shaking Blackness sound of
[2:25:46] trumpet fire lightning everything the
[2:25:49] absolute glor glory of God so that
[2:25:51] everyone was
[2:25:53] terrified that's in
[2:25:56] you really yes really that really is in
[2:26:01] you amen he said so all
[2:26:06] right all right permanent abide in glory
[2:26:10] and Splendor since we have such a
[2:26:12] glorious hope and confident expectation
[2:26:16] we speak with great courage and we are
[2:26:18] not like Moses who used to put a veil
[2:26:20] over his face so that the Israelites
[2:26:22] would not gaze at the end of the glory
[2:26:26] which was fading away but in fact their
[2:26:29] minds were hardened for they had lost
[2:26:31] the ability to
[2:26:34] understand same with the Gentile Church
[2:26:37] same exact thing they lost the ability
[2:26:40] to understand the word even in the
[2:26:43] message they've got so
[2:26:46] message and they think well I'm in the
[2:26:48] message everything is fine
[2:26:51] that's one side they're dead as a door
[2:26:53] nail and then over the other side the
[2:26:56] the these crazy Revelations start
[2:26:59] perking up because they figure well the
[2:27:01] Bible just isn't enough we need more oh
[2:27:04] God that's what Eve
[2:27:06] said they don't realize the
[2:27:10] glory the power of the Eternal Word when
[2:27:14] he sets up sharp in
[2:27:17] you you know what people don't have the
[2:27:19] Holy Ghost that's the problem a lot of
[2:27:22] people don't have the baptism of the
[2:27:23] Holy Ghost so they get
[2:27:25] restless and they try to manufacture a
[2:27:29] Dynamics to their mechanics you can't do
[2:27:32] that no no no no let God be God and you
[2:27:36] be obedient that's what we want he he's
[2:27:40] happy with
[2:27:42] obedience then he manifests himself then
[2:27:45] when you pray for somebody they get
[2:27:47] healed amen how do you know I know
[2:27:50] because it happens all the
[2:27:53] time but the bride isn't going to blow
[2:27:55] the trumpet hey look God's no you're
[2:27:58] humble simple look when that bride
[2:28:01] begins to speak the word and it creates
[2:28:03] like that is she going to run a flag up
[2:28:05] the pole and say hey look we got it we
[2:28:07] got it we got spoken
[2:28:09] [Music]
[2:28:11] word that's
[2:28:13] absurd she's way beyond that Hallelujah
[2:28:17] she's walking with her King she's
[2:28:19] walking walking in humility amen she's
[2:28:22] walking in love every day she has she
[2:28:25] could care less what you know that kind
[2:28:28] of a mindset all right quit here we
[2:28:32] go their minds were hardened they lost
[2:28:35] the ability to understand for until this
[2:28:37] very day at the reading of the old
[2:28:39] Covenant the same Veil remains unlifted
[2:28:42] because it is removed only in Christ but
[2:28:46] to this day whenever Moses is read a
[2:28:49] veil of of blindness Lies over their
[2:28:52] heart but whenever a person turns in
[2:28:55] Repentance and
[2:28:57] Faith to the Lord the veil is taken away
[2:29:01] and so is it today now the Lord is that
[2:29:05] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[2:29:07] is there is Liberty emancipation from
[2:29:11] bondage true freedom and we all with
[2:29:15] unveiled face oh my continually see
[2:29:20] being as in a mirror the glory of the
[2:29:22] Lord are progressively being transformed
[2:29:26] see that progressively day by day by day
[2:29:31] unconscious growth amen
[2:29:35] amen seeing as in a mirror the glory of
[2:29:38] the Lord are progressively being
[2:29:40] transformed into his image from one
[2:29:44] degree of Glory even more to even more
[2:29:48] Glory which comes from the Lord who is
[2:29:52] the
[2:29:53] spirit you see that the New Covenant is
[2:29:55] the Holy Ghost
[2:29:57] baptism and until you really enter in
[2:30:00] Beyond the Veil and I'll paraphrase
[2:30:04] paraphrase a few things that he said on
[2:30:07] the unveiling of God as I had mentioned
[2:30:10] on there he was talking about how that
[2:30:12] there were two two men that make met the
[2:30:15] pillar of fire and those two men were
[2:30:17] authors of the Bible that was Moses for
[2:30:21] the old Covenant and St Paul for the New
[2:30:25] Covenant and those two literally met the
[2:30:28] literal Pillar of Fire
[2:30:33] then on that same message he says at the
[2:30:37] last days at the end that same Pillar of
[2:30:41] Fire has come
[2:30:44] back to get into the word and reveal
[2:30:48] what's already been preached by Paul and
[2:30:50] take us back to what he preached
[2:30:53] Hallelujah it has to be the same Pillar
[2:30:56] of Fire and it's a it the book becomes
[2:31:00] an open book and all us with open face
[2:31:05] beholding the glory of the Lord because
[2:31:08] he opened the Seven Seals and revealed
[2:31:13] the glory of his
[2:31:15] person he revealed how Christ operated
[2:31:19] down through all the ages amen amen he
[2:31:22] opened the book he had to come back as a
[2:31:25] pillar of fire in the last days to
[2:31:27] reveal the mystery of himself because
[2:31:30] none of the reformers could get it right
[2:31:33] right every church as soon as they get a
[2:31:35] new idea they form a group amen and call
[2:31:38] it this and you got to join our church
[2:31:40] or you're lost same the same thing goes
[2:31:42] on in the message there's all kind of
[2:31:44] ministers out there that have some whack
[2:31:46] Revelation and they say you got to join
[2:31:48] our group or you're not going in a
[2:31:50] Rapture here when that Prophet said on
[2:31:53] uh God's chosen place of worship he said
[2:31:56] some man called me the other day from
[2:31:58] bont Texas and said brother unless you
[2:32:00] be gone belong to our group you can't go
[2:32:03] you you you missed it he said who ever
[2:32:06] heard of such a thing he said to say
[2:32:08] such a thing is Antichrist that's right
[2:32:10] and then he said I'll say this if you
[2:32:13] believe something like that you're
[2:32:17] lost you're lost and you got people in
[2:32:20] the message screaming that same thing

[2:32:26] not going to go you got to see through
[2:32:28] my glasses or you're not
[2:32:31] going Antichrist lost now I'm not saying
[2:32:35] there literally lost that's between them
[2:32:37] and God I'm just quoting what thus
[2:32:39] sayith the Lord said
[2:32:42] right the New Covenant has opened the
[2:32:45] word oh my goodness he came back and
[2:32:49] ripped the seals off oh man can I read
[2:32:52] something to you all right I know it's
[2:32:54] almost a quarter after but uh let me see
[2:32:57] this is um page 17
[2:33:01] here he says um this is unfailing of
[2:33:05] God I think this is the one yeah this is
[2:33:08] just too glorious maybe we'll wrap it up
[2:33:10] on this all right in the Old Testament
[2:33:13] God was hid when he was on his mercy
[2:33:16] seat on The Mercy Seat by a veil and the
[2:33:20] Old Testament see I haven't even talked
[2:33:22] about the mercy seat and you know the
[2:33:25] Tabernacle and how that there's you know
[2:33:28] there's three things you got the outer
[2:33:29] Court inner Court Most Holy Place human
[2:33:32] being outer Court your flesh inner Court
[2:33:34] mind you know conscious reasoning Most
[2:33:37] Holy place the Throne of your heart you
[2:33:40] can have God here and here but unless
[2:33:42] he's in there you'll just be arguing
[2:33:45] quotes that's right y oh my so so he
[2:33:50] said but the people come in and worship
[2:33:52] like this but remember there was a veil
[2:33:54] that hid God they knew God was there
[2:33:57] they couldn't see him the pillar of fire
[2:33:59] never listen to this that Pillar of Fire
[2:34:01] never appeared anymore there did you
[2:34:04] notice there's not one time in the
[2:34:06] scripture from the time that the pillar
[2:34:07] of fire went in behind that Veil that it
[2:34:10] ever showed again till it come from
[2:34:12] Jesus Christ God was
[2:34:16] veiled when he stood on Earth and he
[2:34:18] said I come from God and I go go to God
[2:34:20] then Paul after his death burial and
[2:34:23] Resurrection on his road to Damascus
[2:34:25] there was that Pillar of Fire again what
[2:34:28] was it out from behind the
[2:34:31] veil glory to God he was in behind the
[2:34:35] veil now he was behind what skin Veil oh
[2:34:40] man see that God himself veiled in
[2:34:44] you my goodness that's why he says say
[2:34:48] you know love one another another say
[2:34:50] good things to one another encourage one
[2:34:53] another don't cut one another down
[2:34:55] you're you're talking about a skin Veil
[2:34:58] there's God in there right
[2:35:02] amen uh out from behind the veil he went
[2:35:06] was in behind the veil what kind of a
[2:35:08] veil a skin Veil see Badger skins in the
[2:35:11] Old Testament behind the veil and when
[2:35:14] that veil was rent on the day of
[2:35:17] crucifixion the Veil that he was wrapped
[2:35:20] in was rent on the day of crucifixion
[2:35:24] the whole Mercy Seat came into view
[2:35:31] oh that's
[2:35:33] love that's love he didn't want us
[2:35:36] wondering and confused and is this right
[2:35:40] he opened the whole Mercy Seat what did
[2:35:43] he do in the last days he came in the
[2:35:45] same Pillar of Fire and revealed the
[2:35:48] whole Mercy Seat amen every mystery was
[2:35:52] revealed as pertains to your personal
[2:35:57] Redemption glory to God there's no more
[2:36:00] Mysteries to be revealed outside of that
[2:36:04] Elijah that's what he said so he says
[2:36:08] um the whole Mercy Seat came into view
[2:36:11] I'll skip down since Pentecost since the
[2:36:14] crucifixion when that veil was rent from
[2:36:17] the top to the bottom for that
[2:36:18] generation Jesus was that God veiled and
[2:36:22] when he died at Calvary God sent fire
[2:36:25] and lightning and ripped that Veil from
[2:36:27] top to the bottom and the whole Mercy
[2:36:30] Seat was in plain view but they were too
[2:36:34] blind to see it yes imagine that they
[2:36:38] knew the word they and he said they were
[2:36:42] in the temple singing chanting Psalm 22
[2:36:46] while Jesus is out there screaming my
[2:36:48] God my God why have they why have you
[2:36:51] forsaken me you imagine that they're
[2:36:53] reading the same scriptures and yet
[2:36:55] they're veiled they couldn't see it and
[2:36:58] they're the same way today yes sir God
[2:37:01] revealed in the open unveiled before
[2:37:05] us and they think we need something more
[2:37:08] have mercy father my goodness the whole
[2:37:11] Mercy Seat came into
[2:37:13] view um ripped the veil from top to
[2:37:16] bottom but they were too blind to see it
[2:37:18] as Moses said here here though and as
[2:37:20] Paul said reading of Moses when Moses is
[2:37:22] read yet that Veil is still on their
[2:37:25] heart oh brother sister that's what's
[2:37:28] the that's what the Jews did when the
[2:37:30] veil was rent and God brought into Plain
[2:37:33] View hanging on the cross he was in
[2:37:35] plain view but they couldn't see it
[2:37:37] could it be possible that the Gentiles
[2:37:40] has done the same thing oh God when
[2:37:43] they've had the church ages a Son of God
[2:37:46] but when now the veil of this
[2:37:48] denomination and things this veil of
[2:37:51] tradition that we've got since Pentecost
[2:37:54] when the church Traditions have been
[2:37:56] rent and the things that the people said
[2:37:59] days of Miracles is passed and these
[2:38:02] things you know they say that yet in the
[2:38:04] message there's groups that say the days
[2:38:06] of Miracles are passed right you know
[2:38:09] that's true right and these things and
[2:38:13] God has took the veil off of it and
[2:38:16] brought it in plain view and they're
[2:38:19] ready to crucify it
[2:38:23] again oh my goodness they said he was
[2:38:26] too common he was too ordinary you're
[2:38:28] too common you're too ordinary God isn't
[2:38:31] failed in that not
[2:38:34] that right oh it's in this you know
[2:38:38] Grand somebody soand so with titles it's
[2:38:41] amazing how that denominational Spirit
[2:38:44] could come into the message and do the
[2:38:48] same thing he said they will never
[2:38:51] denominate this what's he talking about
[2:38:53] the
[2:38:54] word if you see a denominational message
[2:38:58] church or message they're not in the
[2:39:00] message the message I should say the
[2:39:02] message is not in
[2:39:04] them amen everywhere they're doing that
[2:39:07] again amen and they break up Unity break
[2:39:11] up Brotherhood Fellowship lost because
[2:39:14] we've got it and you don't you know
[2:39:16] you've got to agree with Pastor Jones
[2:39:18] from East B you know I need to agree
[2:39:21] with
[2:39:22] Jesus and he revealed himself in the
[2:39:25] last days he ripped back the veil and
[2:39:28] open the whole book it's a New Covenant
[2:39:31] on display oh God help me glory to God
[2:39:35] Amen is it real to you praise God so he
[2:39:39] says the Gentiles done the same thing
[2:39:41] they're ready to crucify him again he
[2:39:43] said he brought him in open View and
[2:39:46] they still don't see it they are blinded
[2:39:49] now he's a prophet he's speaking in 1964
[2:39:53] but he sees the message in 2024 right
[2:39:56] he's looking 60 years down the road oh
[2:40:00] my amen they still don't see it they are
[2:40:03] blinded God veiled in a human
[2:40:06] being and of course that's where a bunch
[2:40:10] of them went off on worshiping brother
[2:40:12] brandham that's right that's right they
[2:40:15] they went to the extreme on that side
[2:40:17] it's hard to maintain the middle of the
[2:40:18] road
[2:40:19] you know you get washed off to one side
[2:40:21] or the other you get washed off into
[2:40:23] formal you got washed off into crazies
[2:40:26] you know and it's hard to stay right
[2:40:29] with the word but I got news for you all
[2:40:31] power in Heaven and Earth is on the word
[2:40:35] through the spirit oh my goodness oh my
[2:40:41] all right he said all right I'll read
[2:40:43] this and then we'll close you you can
[2:40:45] come up and get ready to play start
[2:40:47] playing a himym I don't know something
[2:40:49] happen happy something of Redemptive all
[2:40:51] right and something I'll know you
[2:40:55] know all right brought him an open view
[2:40:59] he says uh God veiled in a human being
[2:41:03] God has veiled in you little
[2:41:05] bride amen is Christ in you he's the
[2:41:09] hope of glory a three-fold mystery it's
[2:41:11] Christ in you the hope of glory all
[2:41:13] these promises are see that whole thing
[2:41:16] the the Seven Seals this here unveiling
[2:41:19] of God all the promises that Abraham
[2:41:22] displayed the new name the son of man uh
[2:41:28] adoption all these promises were
[2:41:31] displayed in the seven covenants but the
[2:41:34] New Covenant takes and puts it in you
[2:41:36] for our day in
[2:41:40] reality and the Book of Revelation says
[2:41:43] the same you have a new name that the
[2:41:46] world doesn't know anything about your
[2:41:48] name is is written in a white
[2:41:51] stone perfect revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:41:55] all these things are to the
[2:41:58] individual because the church kicked
[2:42:00] them out he's on he's let me in let me
[2:42:03] in and the individuals is the only ones
[2:42:06] that let him
[2:42:07] out Revelation three proves that the
[2:42:10] days of big revivals is over because the
[2:42:14] church is all shut him out no other age
[2:42:16] like it not even thyra was his
[2:42:19] bad where he's totally on the outside
[2:42:23] can I come into my own
[2:42:26] church heartbreaking again she went off
[2:42:29] and committed adultery with men's ideas
[2:42:32] instead of saying pure virgin to the
[2:42:35] word yes
[2:42:38] sir God help me it's going fast Aaron
[2:42:41] I'm trying to all
[2:42:46] right oh should I read that one
[2:42:49] oh my goodness oh it's so beautiful he
[2:42:52] says uh listen to this how could God
[2:42:55] have mercy on foul Sinners as us when he
[2:42:58] hid himself was a mystery and now it's
[2:43:00] in plain view it's in full view revealed
[2:43:04] by his word it's always the word
[2:43:07] constantly that is God it's the word
[2:43:10] that opens it up if those people would
[2:43:13] have known that the word of God that day
[2:43:17] when Jesus died they would have seen the
[2:43:19] Mercy Seat they would have seen who he
[2:43:21] was who was that then why did the veil
[2:43:25] rent remember it was death to go into it
[2:43:28] nobody could see it Moses saw it in a
[2:43:31] form it was a man's
[2:43:35] back well here it is a bleeding back oh
[2:43:40] I read that I just wanted to die um
[2:43:43] bleeding back that same man what was it
[2:43:48] God wanted to show them The Mercy Seat
[2:43:51] God wanted to show them who he was so
[2:43:54] the veil in the temple from the hand of
[2:43:56] God above was rent from top to bottom
[2:43:59] and showed God in plain view it was
[2:44:01] Jesus Christ hanging on the cross The
[2:44:05] Mercy Seat and what was it the people
[2:44:09] were too blind to see it now it's
[2:44:12] repeated again he said but glory to God
[2:44:16] he promised in the last days what he
[2:44:18] would do he would show his word in plain
[2:44:22] view open before us again and open it up
[2:44:26] oh
[2:44:27] my Hallelujah what's this revival for
[2:44:31] now how could it Prosper how could it be
[2:44:33] blessed I don't care how many
[2:44:35] interpretations impersonations it's God
[2:44:37] or anything else when Moses went out
[2:44:40] there was a mixed multitude went with
[2:44:42] them and what's it done for it's Jehovah
[2:44:45] himself taking the veil off God to show
[2:44:49] the difference between right and wrong
[2:44:52] which is Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[2:44:55] or who is right God's word is Right
[2:44:59] glory to God hallelujah let every man's
[2:45:02] word be a lie and mine be truth God
[2:45:06] needs no interpreter he does his own
[2:45:09] interpretation he manifests it it gives
[2:45:13] the interpretation God unveiling himself
[2:45:16] oh my right in the midst of us we see
[2:45:19] his great hand telling us these things
[2:45:20] and doing these things listen to this
[2:45:23] message the unveiling of God and another
[2:45:25] one I was going to read is Christ
[2:45:27] revealed in his own word listen to those
[2:45:29] two messages they're fantastic oh isn't
