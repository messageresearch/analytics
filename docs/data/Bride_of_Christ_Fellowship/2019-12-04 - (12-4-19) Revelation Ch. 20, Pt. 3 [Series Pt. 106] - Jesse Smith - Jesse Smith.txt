tonight and after I finished the Thanksgiving messages I thought I'd try to go back and return those a return to the revelation series and try to finish it up here the next few weeks or months Lord willing we'll see what the Lord allows so we're on part three of Revelation chapter 20 and it's part 106 of the series so it just kind of keeps you thinking about it and let's go to Revelation 20 verse 1 by God's grace now read I read verses 1 and 2 and then we'll all read verse 3 threes a lot of reading so you got a little extra reading tonight by God's grace hopefully can handle that hopefully we can all handle that revelation 20 verse 1 I'll read 1 and 2 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years let's all read verse three one two three and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation's No More till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it on into the Lord here surely he's mindful and faithful our God is an awesome God he's a mighty ruler he's mighty in battle Heavenly Father we just love you Lord we come to reverently hear Lord God we just love you Lord our eyes are turned upon you Lord goddess even as we close our eyes Lord our spiritual eyes are focused our desire our will is to do your will Lord to be in your presence Lord which is your face may your face shine upon us Lord here tonight Lord and as we look upon your face as we set our faces Lord to seek your face so father minister to us now by your Holy Spirit bless each and every heart dear God just guide me Lord let me be a yielded vessel Lord God and there may be a glove that your hand can fill and use for your kingdom let me be just a microphone that your voice can speak through Lord God from nothing and I know that Lord that we know each and every here the same Lord let us all be in the Holy Spirit bless our gathering Lord and we'll know that we'll all say it was good to be in the house or Lord as we leave this place in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless should be in-situ praise God so we last looked at this series on August 14th right before I went to Iowa so I was looking on YouTube today and trying to catch up where I pick up where I left off so it's been about four months by God's grace but I knew I'd eventually get back to it so I'd like to get back to it so you got a good foundation in the book of Revelation we'll finish up Lord willing here in the next few weeks by God's grace so I want to just briefly review the themes of this chapter we have three themes the thousand-year reign with Christ upon the earth then you have the Battle of Gog and Magog and then you have the great white throne judgment those three and we've looked at those themes here in part one looked at those thoroughly by God's grace and then we in part two we focus more on the Millennium that was back on August 14th praise God and we looked at that so today I like to finish up the symbols and key revelations of this chapter and then I like to preach a little bit more on the Millennium by God's grace so we'll look to the Lord tonight for that for help because we always always need his help to preach because there's only one preacher and that's Christ he meant so thank the Lord praise God so the the first the main or one of those main symbols in this chapter as a symbol would be found in verse 2 and it says any laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years so the first symbol is of Satan and he's called an old serpent praise God now it's interesting that Jesus says be wise as serpent serpents and harmless as doves so there's something that's Admiral about a regular serpent as much as you probably shiver in your your church chair right now for those of you who don't like snakes but Malachi doesn't he sure likes him at least the ones in America but there's something Admiral about it because anything God created there's something good about it because he when he created everything it was good he said now of course the fall makes the the snake and the spider and you know different animals like that bugs and things like that cockroaches it makes them unpleasant maybe to humans but there's something Admiral about it and Jesus picks it up it's the wisdom of a serpent it's the the way that they move and and they they hunt and they're they're quiet the way they are it's their their manner of their hunting and Jesus says there are wise in the way they hunt and so there's something Admiral about it but here of course it's the negative aspect of the serpent the part what we we don't like and it's the symbol of Satan and notice it gives numerous symbols so if you go back to Revelation 12:9 in your Bible it lists the same titles for Satan so the symbolism is with a serpent and then the titles are repeated here as revelation 12 verse 9 it says and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so we get the same picture so revelation 12:9 and revelation 20 verse 2 give us multiple titles for Satan he's called dragon old serpent devil Satan right so he's got four and then he's got a real name Lucifer so just like G just like God has multiple titles Father Son Holy Ghost he's got one name praise God and that's the Lord Jesus Christ is the name above all names so don't forget that that's a great lesson to learn not to forget that Satan has many titles too but he's one person he's one fallen angel he's like into a dragon which the dragon in the Bible is liken we'd like it to a dinosaur right what we call a dinosaur a terrible lizard right and so you we see the bones of the biggest dinosaurs it makes us kind of imagine what they were but the Bible tells us you know even Jobe sees of the Leviathan and the behemoth ones in the water ones on the land and they're so great you know one of them has a tail like a cedar tree it's so thick and massive and then the other one that's the one in the land the one the water has scales that you can't even you can't even budget scales with the spear it's so great and it shoots out fire from its mouth a fire-breathing water dragon and that's what was alive in those days my because Jove is said to be a during the time of Moses so you get him about the same time there so even after the flood there was many dragons right there's no dinosaurs alive we know that from the scripture but the the only thing God can give us here the best thing the way to describe Satan is as a dragon a great dinosaur and as a serpent he's not like a dove right you're not like a lamb Satan's not like a lamb he's like a serpent and so these are the symbols here that God gives us of Satan so he has many titles but we know he's got one name and he's such a slick dragon or such a powerful dragon and that he deceives the whole world he conquers the whole world but he's such a serpent and sneaky that he deceives the nation's there to see this nation the majority's nation is deceived and the Bible tells us how he deceives them he turns the Word of God into unrighteousness so he makes them think they're serving God but allows them to sin right but Berlin says God gave us the Bible which is a thinking man's filter I just heard brother have to say this week he said you can't pull sin through God's filter praise God hey you can't pull a sinful life in other words you can't preach us it's okay to live a sinful life through the filter of this word because if you filter behaviors through this word you're gonna get a clean life praise God amen because it's a thinking man's filter thank God that we've got a filter in this hour amen but Satan like a serpent II very slowly deceives them praise odd now you've seen constrictors right constricting serpents they slowly get to a spot where they can quickly wrap around something right that right now guys the process of getting around the prey is really slow right it's got a slither and go real slow right a snake doesn't go real fast right and to be a constrictor now it's got to get into a position where it's just slither so quietly slowly and then all of a sudden it'll spring on the prey and then with its powerful muscles it'll quickly crush it right and that's what Satan does right he slips up slowly upon people and they don't even know how close he is right and then after once he's got his trap set then he'll jump upon his prey and quickly choke them out right like I've never said the maniac of gaturro he said all that started when he was he was foaming at the mouth he was cutting himself he was sleeping by tubes can you imagine that if you pass the graveyard on the way home he would sleep next to the dead he would cry out and how but he didn't it didn't start like that it started with one lie brother Ram said Satan just real it said it's okay just go ahead and lie this one time then he started lying again and he got drunk and then he got he just went further it was so sly and then pretty soon you know with the drunkenness Satan jump Don him and demon after demon slipped in and all the demons you know where's the twelve thousand demons slipped in there but it was something small just a little line you know it'll be okay God will forgive me November because he wanted to be delivered but if the Bible says that that Jesus had to cross the lake to get over to him because he cried out he wanted to be free amen remember God can deliver someone Jesus couldn't deliver somebody if they had unbelief if they worship that beam it's that man even though he's back sin that condition he wanted to be set free but the only one that could do it he had to call out to him and anyone that calls out to God God will save amen God is mighty to save him and the Bible said all who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen in other words if somebody wants to be free from the Devils they'll be free but God's not gonna force him to be free they gotta want to be free but that's how Satan worked with the maniac of Gadara one small lie at a time real small real slow and he slowly moves them into sin until he gets them and then he comes in then they they open the door for the devil not really that's what's happened in our church because I was watching our services the last couple of months and we have people here that were shouting and screaming and praising the Lord and somehow some devil slipped in there and change their mind toward the Word of God and now it's taking them away because I was watching I was mine look at those people worship and now they're not here anymore they don't believe what we believe in they're against us and everything like Derek what what happened it was something very slow just slowly it wasn't obvious right but it will happen very slow and when they let down the bars a little bit at a time until they let something big come in like in this case a false doctrine or more it'll start with some small one little compromise see that's what Satan is like he's like that serpent that he questions God's Word because the serpent says old serpent in Revelations that means you have to go all the way back to the beginning the old part of the book right the beginning of the book and then you go back and see Satan the beginning doing the same thing to Eve he develops a relationship with her perhaps that they had many conversations until the one in Genesis chapter 3 where Satan injects a little doubt upon God's Word don't let anybody make you got this word for not one thing don't ever doubt God's Word God's Word is proven to be true hallelujah amen see the serpent will at some point try to get you to doubt it and as soon as he's got you doubting it that's when he'll try to pounce on you praise the Lord and she just nodded a little bit and he kept working on her kept working on her Oh God God God didn't wants to be like gods and yet they already were like gods right yeah I'm just having to speak and it would happen he already was a miniature God on earth but he got him to think that they didn't have enough right that's what Satan wants to do today get us the thing that serving God isn't enough in this holiness he wants us to try to add something to it some something sinful something pleasurable but we are not to live our lives for pleasure now we're to live our lives for eternal pleasure and that is always the greater reward praise God and the Christian the Christianity is the way of the Cross jesus said you can't mean that by my disciple except you take up your cross amen your burden you and I must take up our daily burden of following the Word of God and that makes us true disciples it's not going to be popular but it's going to be right amen thank the Lord so he's like that old serpent in the beginning where Jesus said he's the father of lies he said the reason the Pharisees can't accept the truth is because they're of their father the devil because he's the father of lies Church each each thing we believe each thing we preach we should look to the Word of God and say is this true or not everything we believe we should look to the word God say is this true or not is this causing righteousness in my life is this causing a closer walk with God or is that making me relaxed on God and our beliefs the things we believe how we act should all draw us closer to Christ Satan will try to get you to doubt the Word of God but we must not doubt it we've got to believe it praise God now the same temptation in the Garden of Eden is what he tries to do today his mother said Satan has not changed his tactics right is the same tactics romance also says that God is evil age he's got greater weapons and he dad's now right then he had then because he's got technology he's got a Hollywood he's got all these things greater powers right or greater ways of deception but it's the same idea to doubt God's Word he's trying to get us to question God's Word now in Revelation 20 now let me go back here revelation 20 in Revelation 20 it's a beautiful picture of Satan finally getting what he deserves right it's a thousand years the Bible said he's bound up for a thousand years and he's cast into a bottomless pit and he shut up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation's No More now look at this after six thousand years of him deceiving right and not only that but he's got years where he deceived in heaven right the Angels God gives him a temporary prisons sentence you're gonna have a thousand years in a bottomless pit so Satan well you you know the awful feeling of what it feels like to fall right you ever been on a roller coaster that drops you it's not a very pleasant feeling might be fun for the three seconds you're falling but it measured for him for a thousand years so Satan is in this bottomless pit just following and it sees he's getting a foretaste of what the lake of fire will be like and God sets a ceiling I like that praise God Satan tried to seal Jesus into the tomb with a Roman seal but God broke that seal praise God amen and so foolish of saying the thing that he could have a seal that would be stronger than God's but that's how foolish he is and he's a worthy opponent but he thought he could seal Jesus in because he didn't know the scripture praise God he didn't ever early knew the scripture he'd never revelation praise God he'd have the revelation that Jesus gonna raise from the dead so he thought I can seal that Messiah in there I can seal that Holy Child in there but the power of God the power of life broke that Roman seal and it broke it my angels moving the stone and after they moved it life stepped out of their praise God and life broke the seal praise God and the soldiers fall down because the power of life amen but now God says it for the Millennium he says I'm gonna like you in this bottomless pit for a thousand years that you know more deceive anyone else so now he's going to get a thousand years of torment here falling and he's gonna be recompense for all the pain and death his lies has have cost well the RAM said remember every time every time there's a funeral it's because of Satan right every time there's a fire-engine go out right every time you see a gray hair in your head it's because of Satan and all the pain and suffering every school shooting and every mass shooting every stabbing at whatever all the evil news is all because of Satan and so here in Revelation 20 we see him he gets laid ahold of and the chained by the angel and he gets thrown down the bottomless pit and he gets locked up by so think about that we're on the earth during that time the millennium and we have to worry about that deceiver ever deceiving us amen praise God amen imagine that a thousand years waking up going to bed waking up never have to worry about being deceived amen all right praise God because now you've got a glorified body praise God now you have more than just your soul now your whole mind now your whole body is a brand-new body it's perfection plus perfection praise God now nothing don't worry about being deceived anymore because the deceiver himself is falling for a thousand years man what a what a consolation that will be praise God till a thousand years upon this earth a thousand years of sunrises and try to imagine that have sunsets and never have to go to bed thinking that I messed up there did I make the wrong decision mom we're gonna sleep like kings and queens amen I didn't tell ya we're gonna sleep well because there'll be no deception we'll know we did God's will for that day praise God amen well no because God will only put us in a place a position where he can trust us according to how we lived in this earth amen and so what should our attitude be our attitude should be Lord I want to go to bed tonight not being deceived and you've got the ability to do that because the Bible said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me amen praise God I've got the ability to go to bed tonight with peace in my heart amen five bad dreams I got the ability to pack or to cast on those bad dreams and rebuke them in Jesus name Amen because I didn't do that in the first place and just so you know I had awful dreams last night I forgot to tell my wife but I said some awful dreams I had to get up and rebuked them in the prayer class this morning you have to do that because Satan and I just remind me Satan has free access to the human spirit I was thinking about any of these evil things and this attack didn't feel like I got a good rest but see I've got I've got a source of strength I in me I've got the Spirit of Truth not spirit of deception I've got the spirit of truth praise God and truth will always set the believer free praise God amen so Satan finally gets his just prison sentence for that thousand-year millennium praise God so they're in the honeymoon there's nothing to worry about praise God I bet on one honeymoon and we didn't have much to worry about did we honey much to worry about not so much but see even will be even greater by God's grace Oh be even greater there in the Millennium because there'll be nothing to worry about because Christ is its Christ Day praise God it's our honeymoon with our Christ amen the bride and the groom praise God honeymoon time praise the Lord nothing to worry about no deception you know you're pleasing and then we can say like Jesus I always do that which pleases the father amen that would be the time for that praise God now that's the main symbol the symbol of Satan as a serpent now years ago I don't even remember the sermon I preached but I kind of preach on the trail of the serpent I don't know if you remember that row Graham mentioned that he was going to preach on it and he never got to it not what's interesting is that brother Donnie Reagan has a copy of brother Rams notes on the trail of the serpent and I'd like to I need to email him to see if I could get a copy of those because I guess they took a picture of they found his notebook I like I would like to get a copy of the house I just thought of that not right now but you know you see Satan and he slithers through human history and he tries to conquer the overcomer but he could never do it right he's cunning and deceptive he maxed himself behind religion right he's in religion and just remember some of the the order first he deceived in heaven then he was the beast in the garden and then he deceived through Kay and then he was deceiving the whole world the days are no other than 8 people my what a serpent what a deceiver the whole human population except for 8 and church if you'd have been alive he would have been one of those overcomers praise God but he slithered and deceive and he squeezed the whole population but he couldn't get his dirty tail around those 8 believers they had oh yeah why because they had a prophet who preached righteousness amen he preached holiness and he found grace in the sight of the Lord then he slithered up in Esau Jacob and Esau he saw was a fornicator married outside his faith despite his parents but obviously could not find a place of repentance so he slithered in there he slithered in the days of Moses behind a Balaam and Korah trying to go against Moses and take a place take their priesthood from them and to try to get the people try to curse God's people see how deceptive is Cain was worshiping Balaam was worshiping Cora was worshiping they were all right there amongst him not first let me say like this the devil's right amongst the message churches that serpents ride around us right he's right around us but see where the picture is worthless but we're really somewhat were really tiny and we really don't have any defense but we've got a mighty Shepherd protecting - protecting us and his name is Jesus amen praise God and if a a faithful Shepherd sees our serpent packing is gonna go after a sheep you know what he's gonna do he's gonna take that crook out and smack that fella there right or he's gonna get bigger the big old stone and don't drop it on him right we got a faithful Shepherd he'll protect us but remember Satan is right amongst us just gotta watch his trail he's always right amongst the believers in the days of Micaiah he was right amongst those false prophets of Ahab right in the temple in the days of Jena Jeremiah he was in Zedekiah saying oh it's not going to be 70 years it's going to be two years lying in the days of John the Baptist he was right there in those Pharisees those generations of vipers right the trail of the serpent so the serpent is always in those closest to the message right so we have to remember let's not forget that old serpent has got those same old tricks and he's going to hang right around us and we got to make sure we stay on our toes we stay true to the Word of God so that we can overcome and be a part of this millennium that our lives are worthy of the gospel in Jesus day he started right into Judas his heart right choked his life out soul and Judas sold out Jesus just like Cain killed Abel my same thing he said that brother have said that in 1960 in the days of Paul Satan entered he limas LMS Africa not sure to say that he entered those kanker preachers right that save their own bellies whose God was their belly so Paul said the same thing my I'm trying to deliver the message I'm trying to be the church age messenger but these Devils are these snakes are all around me they're all around here I've got to stand on the Word of God and as he went along he didn't get more popular he got more rejected because of the snakes because of the serpents slithering and choking out all those that started following him don't forget that church be just the same way Paul was saying we're gonna be Dimas follow Paul for a while but then he left him for the pleasures of the world that's how it's going to be we're gonna have fake word of you're either gonna be a faithful believer or Satan's gonna choke out your life and you're gonna leave the real Word of God right cuz you show you're not an unbeliever you're some type of believer praise God we want to be faithful that Satan doesn't choke us out but we can recognize him Shepard there he is squash him kill him stop him protect me Lord I don't what when he said I don't want his poison amen I don't want to be put to sleep by his poison I want to live for the glory of God I want to know there's only be a living sacrifice for God's glory the Bible said that Saint John battled a man who wanted the preeminence there was a man who always wanted the preeminence and Saint John had to battle that so Satan was trying to get preeminence over the Word of God let's read that boy spent a long time server that third John 1 verse 9 3rd John a long time since I read now let me read that that was just in my notes yeah its diode trifa's right because I said thou out trophies that diode trophies for 3rd John 1:9 I wrote another church but Diotrephes who loved to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not wherefore if I come I'll remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself received the Brethren and forbidding them that would and casteth them out of the church beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of God but he that doeth evil hath not seen God how did Paul how did John know this was a serpent man because he wanted the preeminence amongst Paul I'm sorry much John rather so John knew Jesus Christ but died off no trophies he says you need to listen to me he was exalting himself above those that even knew Jesus the original apostles and look at what he did he he spurted out prating were malicious words against the real servants of God you better watch people that say evil things about William Branham watch him when they bored out and spread out evil things watch their lives because they're always going to lead to destruction that's right how did John know John said they took preeminence over the word and then they spoke malicious things against God's true servants and then they kicked him out of the church he said they wouldn't even receive the Brethren they wouldn't receive the preachers that were wrong John they separate themselves the Bible said they'll separate themselves not having the Holy Spirit now some of them you got a kick out right some people they won't repent you got to kick them out like I've had to do a couple of times but there's other people that they will separate themselves because they want to have the preeminence they think they know more about it but here John lays it out verse 11 he said follow not evil but follow good amen see what they're preaching see what their fruits are bringing forth the real fruits of the Holy Spirit will bring forth good works and not evil works praise God a lot of times you won't recognize it right away right a lot of it especially today people being deceived they don't see the sin we you know we might not see their sinful works right away but give it some time and you'll see it it might just be church their sinful works might just be the words they say it may never go into adultery may never go into stealing and may never go into murder the evil works they may accomplish maybe that trading and malicious words against God's people that may be the end of it but that's all they to be lost right because the Pharisees we know they have a lives so holy if they commit any evil they'd be stone and killed so what was their evil their words now someone we're after money we know that - they love the garments and they love the sitting at the special tables and everything like that but they paid ties on every little thing every little ounce they paid ties on they were so religious so the only way to recognize them was their failure to obey the word and their evil words that they said against Jesus look at Satan's slither there in the days of John it was so it was so close the only way to know is that he was against he was speaking evil things against John and the other preachers of the message glory hey man god help us remember Jesus that's gonna be more deceptive in this day more Jews did the same thing he said call them false teachers false teachers where is it old sir end up he ends up in the Roman Catholic Church the beast Rome and not just in Rome but in the United States the beasts out of the earth this is where that old serpent ends up in Revelation 12 that old serpent is trying to destroy the woman the Jewish Church and the 144,000 praise God but God Jesus comes back he seals the 144,000 he saves them and no doubt they go in the rapture as well praise God amen 144,000 I'm sorry not rapture millennium under forward four thousand golden linen the at rapture took place I'm sorry they go into the Millennium somehow because they've got the seal of God in their foreheads they're born again praise God amen so how he heads up so Satan heads up this serpent slithers all the way through history church he's slithering now through riches and cares of the world in soft living but he heads up in an antichrist a man that sits in the temple of God the drew the Jewish temple declaring that He is God exalting himself above the Word of God this is how he heads up this is how he exalts himself as a serpent he's not a murderer right by physically physical thing he's not a he's not a Muslim right because if he's a Muslim he wouldn't sit in the Jewish temple killing himself God he wouldn't deceive the whole world he's got to look like he's a Christian right so the very height of hypocrisy is Satan that old serpent he ends up at the very at the very climax of history he ends up as a Christian sitting in the Jewish temple and that's his great deception and the way to know is test him by the word amen that's how you always know that Satan he's always saying no not the word say this not this that word say this and we've just got to say we know what the word says we're staying with the word we're keeping the word we're obeying the word we're gonna live righteously and we're not going to be a part of the supper we're not getting choked by the serpent we're going to fly away out of here like eagles in the raps hey man oh yeah thank the Lord so that was just a real quick review of that trail the serpent thought you see him all the way through the Bible he's always like that he's always really close upon the believer well we've got a great Shepherd here to protect us praise God amen now the next thing so that's the symbol that's the first symbol is the old serpent the next thing is the key revelation the key revelation is in Revelation 20 verse 5 let's go back there revelation 20 verse 5 the church don't forget that Diotrephes all's he did was speak evil against the message preachers and he wouldn't a fellowship with him anymore and that was the serpent in John's day so notice when people say they won't fellowship with us anymore or when someone says they won't fellowship with you or come to the church anymore there's something wrong with that something wrong with that because that's all it was but it was so religious it looks so good they thought they had it they just they just gave themselves preeminence over the truth of God's Word revelation 20 verse 5 but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so the one of the great revelations in this chapter is that there's two resurrections praise God there's the first resurrection the rapture and the second resurrection which is the resurrection under life and the resurrection under damnation now we're pretty familiar with this but I just want to state it again just so our children can hear the first resurrection is the rapture of the new testament church is smoking up in 1st Thessalonians 4:17 1st corinthians 15:51 to 54 and this is the wedding of Christ and his wife only those who have the Holy Ghost who have the oil in their lamps red and full of oil Oh they will go out to meet Christ at the weddings after at the marriage supper praise God the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished but they will rise at the second resurrection now the second resurrection is also later in this chapter in verse 11 to 15 let's just read it because we got time and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them see there's hell there's the heart of the earth see the hardy earth where all the sinners are they got to give up all those souls that come up to the white throne judgment and they were judged every man according to their works and death and he'll were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and who suffers not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire all right so everybody can see now there's two resurrections the first resurrection is God taking his bride Jesus taking his bride to the marriage supper and they get to enjoy the thousand year millennial reign but the second resurrection is all the dead that missed the rapture get brought up to the white throne and there's no escaping it can you imagine that church you've got to stand before Jesus Christ at the white throne judgment now look at that you'll either sit with him or you'll stand before him which one is it gonna be and it all depends who you're standing for right now praise God I'm gonna stand for Christ now so that when the white throne judgement comes I don't stand in front of him but I sit with him praise God so I'm willing to stand with the unpopular now I'm willing to be rejected now I'm willing to me he made mocked in front of now and stand with Christ because I don't want to stand before at the white throne judgment I want to be seated by his side you imagine all the people that don't want to come to church or they don't want to face judgment cuz judgments right now right for the believer judgment begins in the house of God they won't come instead that's why we stand before the Word of God right when I say let's take our Texas stand what are we doing we're standing before the king of kings and Lord of lords now we're standing for judgment now so at that day at the second resurrection we don't have to stand before mand shaking our shoes and wonder am I going to make it or not is my name on that book or not did it stay on the book or they could get blotted out we don't don't worry about it because we can experience his love now we can experience his forgiveness now and we can know like Jesus said you can rejoice that your names written in heaven now praise God hey man that's what we should rejoice that's what struck me on Sunday morning I start dancing around here because I was like mine so much be thankful for my children are healthy I know the message God's kept me from sin I just our dance around here because I thought about all the things that have to be thankful for praise God and the greatest thing Jesus said is to rejoice that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life amen hahaha the greatest joy the greatest rejoicing is to know that heaven is going to receive you that you're accepted in the beloved Amen I don't know you praise God thank you Jesus what a blessing to know that praise God so the second resurrection they got to stand before Jesus and they got a tremble like a little leaf they got trouble there because they wouldn't come and tremble now during their lifetime and Jesus will play the video of their life they got invited to church someone gave him a message book write some give some gave of my book or someone gave a website but they turned it down instead of facing the Christ during their lifetime now they've got to face Christ at the white throne judgment that's the second resurrection I want to read again out of John 5:28 because it's a very helpful scripture the first resurrection is for the rapture the catching up of Christ's bride but the second resurrection is the resurrection unto life or damnation John 5:28 and 29 Marvel none of this John 5:28 for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave she hears voice we just read about that revelation 20 the Seas got to give it up the land's got to give it up everybody definitely have to give up the souls verse 29 and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation praise God so God just brings it down to this have you done good or have you done evil now this is for the foolish virgin this is for the people that are scarcely saved and remember Matthew 25 so there were six things they could do to get saved give food give shelter give clothing I can't remember all the other ones there were six things they could do to get saved and Jesus says will you do good in your life or will you do evil and that's what will be determined the judge will determine it I say let's let's not try to judge others but let's leave it in the judges hands praise God we got to preach it we got to tell it but let's live it let's do what's right let's not trying to judge people now let's give warnings the Bible said warning every man praise God we must warn them but we don't know anyone's final destination right or anyone's destiny we don't know that for sure but let us give warning and let us tell men to do good let's encourage them to not do evil but clean to that which is good and let us do good praise God amen I'm gonna read that just so I got it six of those Matthew 25 I thought that was important to repeat today if you haven't done this church he said four hours a hunger gave me me if someone's hungry try to feed him if someone's thirsty give them a drink if someone's a stranger try to take him in or get him a hotel or find them a place to stay if someone's naked give them clothes if someone's sick visit them if someone's in prison visit them in prison six things so children you remember two children somebody sometimes God's moves through you sometimes God speaks through you if you see a need let's be Christians and let's meet that need because God is going to give salvation that he this is what he calls good this is doing good just being a helpful person praise God helping out the least of these my brother the least of the bride members helping out them gets them eternal life that's good doing good and not evil but that's that lets bit but let's be real Christians let's go step further and let's just not do good to the bride praise God let's love our enemies - thank you God amen let's be good as a bride that's be good to the foolish merchants let's be good to everybody let's have the love of the Heavenly Father praise God anybody can be good to those that are good to them it takes real Christianity a real Christian to be good even to your enemies praise God alright be a little bit more to go here the timing of this chapter is totally chronological revelation 20 this let's head back to this is one of the rare chapters in Revelation that is total totally chronological in the correct order so it starts with the tribulation I'm sorry I'm sometime after the tribulation Satan's bound for a thousand years which allows Christ and his people to complete their thousand-year honeymoon on the earth at the completion of the hundred I'm sorry thousand years Satan's loosed for a short season and deceives the nation's to come as Gog and Magog and battle against Christ his wife and beloved city foul fire devours the deceived Army Satan is cast in the lake of fire and the second resurrection gathers all men and women to stand before God at the white throne judgment and receive either eternal life or the second death in the lake of fire totally chronological let's read gog and magog again let's read that by God's grace verse 7 revelation 20 verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and should go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went up on the breadth of the earth encompass the camp of the Saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured him you would think you would think a thousand years in prison would get you to repent don't you thousand years he's fallen uh and he never thinks maybe I should repent and so he gets another lease on life he gets taken out of prison and what's his first thing let's deceive let's fight let's kill after a thousand years of being locked up and of course they can't repent but even other doesn't come to his mind he still wants to fight he still wants to kill he still wants to destroy this is his final shot at it and so even a thousand years of punishment a thousand years of prison will never change his heart Church we should be so thankful that our hearts of stone have been changed in the hearts of flesh praise God we should be thrown so thankful that the the evil thoughts we used to hold the evil sins we used to commit that we no longer commit them that we can sing that song are the things I used to do I do them no more amen because Satan can be put in prison for a thousand years and never changes way he never thinks any different he still wants a kill and deceive and destroy but you and I we get on a hard time and if we come in and sin will say God forgive me I want to do different I want to overcome I want to do better I want to please you I want to do the righteousness of God amen but a thousand years is enough to convince him to change his ways it's not enough but God finally sends it down Satan's last act is trying to gather people in a big group to kill God I'm sorry Jesus and the bride that's his last thing he wants the last thing he gets to do is trying to kill his wife him and his wife see he's always a homewrecker isn't he he's always trying to divide husbands and wife he's always trying to destroy families that's the first thing he did in the Garden of Eden that's the last thing he does here amen no I just struck me like that never saw it like that the first thing he does is divide Adam and Eve the last thing he does is trying to divide Christ in the church but just like always God's stronger and God knows how to protect his children he protects his children through fire amen Holy Ghost fire yeah let's just say in a regular fire this is Holy Ghost spot this is eternal fiery may god those are predictors grunt awesome fire amen that'll try that old serpent away in fact it'll drive him right to fire amen to the judgment fires of judgment because in verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast in lake of fire brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever now don't get deceived on that people have called me this week I saw your video on hell's that eternal what about this well Church if you give Satan eternal life then he must believe in Jesus as his Savior because eternal life only comes through believing Jesus Christ as your personal Savior but remember the Bible said no murder hath eternal life and Satan the bollocks that Satan was a murderer and a liar from the beginning right so what caused Cain to kill Abel it was the murderous spirit of Satan inside a Cain right so ultimately Satan was responsible for that Kane just yielded to Satan's desires that's right so see my master they may burn for thousands of years maybe millions or years but at some point they will come to destruction because their souls are not eternal but the fire is eternal because it's a part of God it's a manifestation of God our God is at what consuming fire amen so when the Bible said eternal fire that's what it means it's a manifestation of God amen God's eternal praise God whenever he manifests himself it manifests himself however he wants but whatever manifestation it's part of his eternal Creek creation praise God as I was part of his eternal nature hallelujah that's right so yeah they burned their tormented forever and ever and ever but that's not eternally it can't be because they don't have eternal life so this chapter is totally chronological now Oh as I get ready to close let me set a timer here try to give me ten more ten more minutes that would be a little over hour I want to close with this thought so forgot your Bibles go to Isaiah chapter two this was a fresh thought Isaiah 2 verse 1 well look we'll close here tonight by looking at the Millennium how many are living for that place I'm living for that one praise God I'm living for that honeymoon praise God verse two Isaiah 2 verse 2 and it should come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house should be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow into it now this check this goes all against the loss of gravity doesn't it so we have this mountain that's lifted up the Lord's house but all the nations flow into it it's like opposite of gravity so what is it it's God attracting all the people praise God it is God's glory everyone that's on the earth is attracted to God they're just drawn like magnets to God's house and so God goes against gravity and he draws them all up that's what he's doing right now he's drawing us up into heavenly places hey yeah because our Bible says our soul we have an anchor for the Soul and it's into the holiest of Holies it's anchored in heaven praise God so it's drawing our desires it's drawing our affections upward praise God all nations shall flow into this temple in the Millennium praise God verse 3 and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his pass for out of Zion shall go forth the law the word of the Lord from Jerusalem hey man where do you learn about God at your house praise God don't you live with Jesus I was gonna live with Jesus where they can learn about God they've got to go up to the house of God to learn and there you you and I will be with Christ praise God all these nations we're gonna learn about God same way we do today in the God's house praise God you should be learning about God's house tonight praise God we should be learning about the things of God anyone knows we learn about the ballgame go to the ball field well learn about music go to the Opera House we'll learn about God go to church praise God so for a thousand years God opens up his home and said come let me teach you about myself and Lord willing maybe we'll teach you those lessons maybe Jesus will let us teach a few of those lessons first for he so judge amongst the nations and shall rebuke many people look at that rebuked in the Millennium there'll be no sin there but that doesn't mean they they won't they won't they'll be human right but there'll be no sin so they must there must be something where they can maybe be tempted or something like that I don't know how if Satan is not there either but Jesus has to rebuke many people they got the wrong ideas somehow they got wrong ideas so Jesus needed to rebuke them now look at this verse 4 and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore so they're gonna come to the house of God Church with swords but after Jesus rebukes them and corrects them they're gonna take their swords that I don't need these swords anymore let me beat them down the plows shears my battles are not against my brothers here so I'm gonna get rid of my weapons I'm going to change my weapons and the tools to feed the people all because they went to the house of God and they got taught by Jesus because Jesus said i reaiiy love everyone that I rebuke praise God so even in Jesus were here they can feel as love Amen and they know that there's there gonna be no Wars there's gonna be no reason that these swords our battles are over let's turn these swords in the powering tools and let's go work the land and let's bring forth food let's enjoy this honeymoon praise God hey hey men my now of course they're not the bride but they're gonna enjoy the benefits of our honeymoon with Christ's mercy Lord go to Isaiah eleven verse three Isaiah 11 verse three and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord he shall not judge out to the side of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judged the poor reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with a rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins the wolf shall also drell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and the little child shall lead them I could and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like an ox what is this it's returning to the Garden of Eden conditions right getting closer to the new heavens and new earth the New Jerusalem verse 8 and the suckling child shall play on the whole of the ASP and the weaned child to put his hand on the cockatrices then they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious what is this what is the set or what is the Millennium it's a day of rest it's the thousand years of rest it's that millennial time praise God the whole earth should be full of the knowledge of the Lord my you can't even hardly walk out of this room and experience the knowledge of the Lord but one day church brno everywhere ever go is going to be knowledge of the Lord see me Jesus here Jesus there Jesus there everywhere because his his Spirit has rebuked any evil right and he's taught the people he's draw the knew himself he sought in the Lord then he sent him out same thing he's doing right now with us amen he's drawing us into his house and we go out and we manifest that we limit out in our lives in our homes as well praise God he doesn't on a small level now but there in the morning he does it all the global scale hey man praise God that's beautiful he draws him into his house to teach him to rebuke him and then he when he sends them out they no longer want to fight anymore that should be our church we got trouble with anybody we should come into here and we should leave have no more troubles I'm not gonna fight I'm not gonna hurt him not gonna speak evil not gonna get in a big fight I'm just gonna love him I'm gonna overcome evil with good praise God hallelujah go to Micah chapter 4 verse 1 Micah 4 verse 1 they asked milligram bro BAM are our people gonna die during the money he said looks like there maybe looks like there may not be he said don't know for sure so it looks like it looks like in some sense there'll be children there because a child shall lead an ox a child shall put his hand in a Serpent's dead a snake's dead don't have to worry about it because the earth is full of a knowledge of the Lord Micah 4 verse 1 but in the last days to come to pass that the mountain of the house of Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and it should be exalted above the hills and people shall flow into it high this upward flowing it's kind of like the Bible said when the apostles got the Holy Ghost it turned the whole world upside down amen praise God and now things don't flow down now they flow up praise God is that what it's like for you Church is that was like when you come to church is it like you're flowing in is it easy to come to church or is it hard I hope it's like you're flowing to church praise God hope it's not like you're all going upstream oh it's so hard to get there I open your heart it feels like oh I just can't wait to get to God's house I can hear the word of the Lord ha ha ha hey praise God they flow into it it's an easy thing to go to the house of Lord it's an easy to praise God because you're filled with God's Spirit hallelujah thank the Lord verse 2 and many nations shall come and say come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob and he shall teach us of his ways and we'll walk in his paths for the law shall go forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem he should judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up a sword against nation neither shall they learn of war anymore but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has spoken my that means you can walk it so I'll walk outside at night you don't worry about anybody robbing you you can go to bed at night you don't to lock the front door nothing to worry about because everybody has come in the presence of him hey hey man and when they saw his presence they rebuked they said I'm not doing anything for a thousand years because I've heard from the king I've heard from the Lord there's no deceiver here to deceive us it's going to be a time of righteousness doesn't mean no more fighting against one another it's just helping one another nobody can nobody can sneak up and say boo and make you jump and scream like they do at our house right nobody's gonna make you afraid the mob said no one's gonna make you afraid oh there was hear about the shooting or to hear about that hear hear about the bombing or about the explosion I mean none of that there no one can make you afraid why because the one that you're afraid of he told you he's gonna live for a thousand years there's nothing be afraid of he told you how it's gonna be he taught everybody the word of the Lord there's nothing to hinder it that's how it is we come to church there's nothing to fear here right there's nothing fear here because we got the power to cast out all fear praise God that's right so this is just our church here is like a foretaste of what the millennium is gonna be like praise God that's right verse 5 for all people walk everyone in the name of his God and we walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever now that's the interesting scripture it looks like false gods but I don't know for sure in that day saith the Lord will I assemble her that halted and I will gather her that's driven out and her that I have afflicted now make her that holdeth a remnant and her that was cast far off a strong nation and the Lord shall reign over them and Mount Zion from henceforth even forever that's Israel praise God remember he had to drive him out of Israel but he's drawn him back and now old tower the flock the stronghold of the daughter of Zion unto thee shall come even the first a minyan the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Zion I stand to our feet praise God the kingdom is coming to the daughter of Jerusalem praise God hey man the kingdom is coming back to Israel we preach it about 10-12 services on the kingdom of heaven right we've got the kingdom now but it's coming back to Israel praise God and all nations will flow into the house of the Lord praise God what a time to look forward to are you looking forward to that church are looking forward to just everybody flowing to the house and Lord you ever notice that ever notice in traffic jam all the cars they're all gonna head in the same way that's how it's gonna be like in the Millenium we're all just gonna be silly come in the house of God where is everybody going to the house of Lord they're all just gonna flow up into there and Jesus will rebuke all these nations that want to fight against he's gonna rebuke God and they're gonna let other change all their weapons not swords anymore not guns anymore but now plows shears let's play and water let's see God bring fourth the food and then we'll share it we'll have peace on the earth no enemies no fear nothing to be scared of this is what God wants for his people and we get to be a part of it praise God we won't be surprised by it because we're expecting it praise God we won't be outside the city we'll be in the city praise God hey man raise God amen do you think Jesus is gonna have to rebuke his own bride think about that church the Bible said here usually he'll be rebuking the nation's in the money do you think he's gonna have to rebuke you and I no way no way why because he's rebuking us right now where he's God he corrects us right now because He loves us we suffer rebukes hard sermons hard things we hear brother Graham saying what hard things we get review of God changed my life and God trying to get victory helped me we keep getting rebuked now because he knows we love him praise God and no doubt he loves us because he sent his son to die for us so he won't be looking at you Lydia and rebuking you sister Naomi he won't be rebuking you Beatrice he won't be rebuking you cos me got to live with it now we see our shortcomings and our faults and we have to take a rebuke now the Holy Spirit check you say you shouldn't have said that you should not have done that we have to rebuke now although I failed the Lord again my goodness I didn't want to fail
