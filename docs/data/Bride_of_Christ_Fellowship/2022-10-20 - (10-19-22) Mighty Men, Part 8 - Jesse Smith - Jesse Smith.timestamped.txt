[41:59] and that's what we see you know I I can
[42:01] honestly look it back in my life and I
[42:03] can see God has been working through me
[42:04] mightily because God has been forgiving
[42:07] my sins he's been strengthening me he's
[42:09] been keeping me on the right path I mean
[42:12] what more could I ask Church than that
[42:13] that Jesus Christ forgive me love me
[42:16] answer some of my prayers not all of
[42:17] them but he answered some of them and he
[42:19] keeps me on the right path praise God
[42:21] that's God working in me mightily just
[42:24] like he's working in you praise God of
[42:26] course we know he wants to work in all
[42:27] of us here tonight so I have some slides
[42:29] to show hunt if you want to I just have
[42:31] some quotes I have some scriptures and
[42:32] quotes I'd like to share here tonight
[42:34] just to kind of
[42:35] we're going to start with a little
[42:36] review here but then we'll move into
[42:39] of course those are David's three mighty
[42:41] men that broke through the miles and
[42:43] miles of Canaanites in order to get
[42:45] David to drink and the Bible called them
[42:47] Mighty Men praise God and uh David's
[42:49] least command was or at least desire was
[42:51] their command praise God that's what it
[42:53] is for us too the Bible's least command
[42:55] is our is our pleasure to do praise God
[42:57] we love how many love to live by the
[42:59] word of God
[43:00] how many love open him if you're open up
[43:01] your Bible and just say praise the Lord
[43:03] I'll do that amen I'll obey that promise
[43:06] of God oh it's a great blessing praise
[43:08] God to be a a real Christian today you
[43:10] know I just started I finished Jeremiah
[43:12] yesterday and I started Isaiah today and
[43:15] I was just blown away by uh the things
[43:17] God was saying to Isaiah to tell the
[43:20] people he said I don't even want I don't
[43:22] even want your animal sacrifices he said
[43:24] they become a stench in my nostrils I
[43:26] don't want to see them I don't want I
[43:28] don't want your new moons I don't want
[43:29] your Sabbath I don't want your Feasts he
[43:32] said because the land is filled with
[43:33] iniquity
[43:35] and I thought wow what a what a striking
[43:37] thought like God they were they were
[43:39] actively worshiping God actively singing
[43:42] actively praying and God said I don't
[43:44] want any of it until you get your lives
[43:46] cleaned up
[43:47] what a lesson for us may God help us to
[43:49] always have our lives cleaned out praise
[43:51] God
[43:52] so if there's anything tonight you need
[43:53] to be cleaned out let's get it cleaned
[43:54] out by God's grace it's your night
[43:56] tonight it's my night tonight it's all
[43:57] of our nights to worship God in spirit
[43:59] and in truth praise God
[44:01] Hallelujah just a blessing that God can
[44:03] strengthen us now we want to be we've
[44:05] seen these Mighty Men down through the
[44:07] the scriptures we looked at Mighty Men
[44:09] the Old Testament uh mighty men and
[44:11] women in the New Testament right sisters
[44:12] and the sister said
[44:14] looked at some mighty women in the Bible
[44:16] praise God a few of them Hallelujah like
[44:18] a like Priscilla right she was a mighty
[44:20] a mighty woman in the scripture praise
[44:22] God and all those different ones down
[44:24] through the Bible Hallelujah of course
[44:26] God has Mighty Men that's what the Bible
[44:27] use that terminology Mighty Men but we
[44:29] know God uses sisters mightily just the
[44:31] same praise God they have gifts to the
[44:33] Holy Spirit everything they can do
[44:34] except preach praise God they can do
[44:36] everything a man can do they can cast
[44:38] out Devils they can prophesy they can
[44:40] speak in tongues they can interpret they
[44:42] can do everything except they can't
[44:43] preach praise God but God says they can
[44:45] do everything except that because of
[44:47] what Eve done praise God but I love how
[44:49] Jesus uh the first one he shows after
[44:52] his resurrection was not Peter it was
[44:54] Mary Magdalene praise God Amen a sister
[44:56] that he cast Seven Devils out of amen
[44:58] and he showed himself a lie first to a
[45:01] woman praise God because she was there
[45:03] she would come back praise God she
[45:04] wasn't afraid she come back to worship
[45:06] praise God she come back to show God
[45:08] respect amen
[45:10] and God will respect any of you praise
[45:11] God God expect respect any of us if we
[45:14] respect him praise God
[45:15] and we love him and serve him and
[45:17] worship him with all of our hearts and
[45:18] soul and I got the wrong text there but
[45:20] uh let's look at Mighty Men forever now
[45:22] this is of course a millennium text here
[45:24] this is our scripture we read for
[45:26] tonight this is a millennium text
[45:29] in this in this in this scenario Thrones
[45:32] are set up not just one throne
[45:34] no doubt Jesus has a throne in the
[45:36] Jewish temple we call it the millennial
[45:38] Temple no doubt Jesus has a throne the
[45:40] millennial Temple but somewhere there as
[45:42] well there are other Thrones set up for
[45:45] other leaders
[45:46] praise God and judgment is given to them
[45:50] in other words they get to judge the
[45:52] people that are on the earth because the
[45:54] Bible said during the Thousand Years
[45:55] there will be children though the wolf
[45:57] will Lie by the lamb praise God uh the
[46:00] Bible said a child may die a hundred
[46:01] years old so it looks like there will be
[46:03] death there looks like there uh there
[46:05] could be we know we were not sure we'll
[46:07] find out when we get there by God the
[46:08] main thing is let's get there
[46:10] that's the main thing let's make sure we
[46:12] get to the Millennium praise God
[46:13] hallelujah how do we do that like the
[46:15] Bible said
[46:16] we need to give our lives for Christ
[46:18] whether through martyrdom which probably
[46:20] won't be us but could be
[46:22] uh but also re failing or or rejecting
[46:25] the worship of the Beast rejecting the
[46:28] mother Harlot rejecting rejecting the
[46:30] denominational systems praise God and
[46:32] don't let let's not be as immature to
[46:35] say where there's no denominations
[46:36] around the message of course there's the
[46:37] nominations around the message that's
[46:39] why you get the false doctrines that's
[46:41] why you get tape worshipers that's why
[46:43] you get brother Branham worshipers
[46:44] that's why you get a polygamy that's why
[46:47] you get racism that's why you get uh
[46:49] Liars that's why you get all these
[46:51] people predicting things and that fails
[46:53] see that's they become a denomination
[46:55] they they've uh they've rallied around
[46:57] their idea rather than taking the word
[46:59] of God denominations start easily praise
[47:02] God but a real Church uh can battle and
[47:04] overcome it because the Gates of Hell
[47:06] will not Prevail against the revelation
[47:08] of God hallelujah
[47:10] so denominations are very simply history
[47:13] teaches us that and no domination will
[47:15] ever have a Revival praise God but you
[47:18] and I could have daily Revival
[47:19] hallelujah thank God
[47:22] so we must reject the worship of a
[47:25] denominational spirit
[47:27] uh also we must reject the image of the
[47:30] Beast which brother Brad says is the
[47:32] World Council of churches he said and we
[47:34] must not receive the mark in their
[47:36] foreheads which is doing the will of the
[47:39] denominational system or taking the
[47:41] denominational systems Doctrine that's
[47:43] what program says one or the other he
[47:44] says or in their hands he said that's
[47:47] doing the will of the denominational
[47:48] system so not preaching against the
[47:50] mother heart I'm not preaching against
[47:52] the daughters right doing the will of
[47:54] them
[47:55] and if we do that church what a blessing
[47:58] if we do that the Bible says we will
[48:00] live and reign with Christ for a
[48:02] thousand years
[48:03] what a promise hallelujah what a promise
[48:06] now that word in the Greek uh rain means
[48:09] to be king
[48:10] to exercise kingly power
[48:13] to exercise the highest influence to
[48:16] control
[48:18] so all these things things think of
[48:20] think of Peter and Stephen who stoned to
[48:22] death Peter was crucified upside down
[48:24] because they stood for the truth and
[48:26] gave this ultimate sacrifice they were
[48:29] despised on this Earth they were
[48:31] ridiculed they were mocked on this Earth
[48:33] they were rejected on this Earth but in
[48:35] the next Earth God makes them Kings
[48:37] Hallelujah
[48:39] may God help us to get through whatever
[48:42] trials we're going through amen may God
[48:44] help us to deal with the pain to deal
[48:46] with the suffering amen how they need to
[48:48] deal with the trials may God help us to
[48:50] just deal with it keep the testimony of
[48:52] Christ because God has something greater
[48:54] waiting for you praise God Amen oh my
[48:56] God we don't have to be popular here
[48:58] we're going to be rejected here praise
[49:00] God we're going to be cast aside here
[49:02] praise God but we won't be cast aside
[49:04] there we'll be accepted there amen amen
[49:06] hallelujah you stand for Jesus Jesus
[49:09] will stand for you praise God
[49:12] if you can control himself like this if
[49:14] you can control your bodily passions
[49:16] here he'll give you control over the
[49:17] world later
[49:18] Hallelujah if you can control your
[49:21] thought life here he'll make you a ruler
[49:23] over there later amen we've got to keep
[49:26] it under control praise God we got to
[49:27] keep we got to keep this sin nature
[49:29] inside we've got to keep it under
[49:31] control we've got to cast down anything
[49:33] that exalts itself against the word of
[49:34] God church sometimes you know we forget
[49:36] we are walking around and we're supposed
[49:38] to have armor on Amen hallelujah we're
[49:41] supposed to wake up in the morning and
[49:43] get sharper in your sword praise God
[49:45] see we're supposed to wake up and that
[49:47] we forget we're walking around like
[49:48] soldiers around here that's how we're
[49:50] supposed to walk with the full armor of
[49:53] God on not just one Peace church we need
[49:55] to put on the whole armor of God
[49:56] hallelujah we're soldiers here we're
[49:59] soldiers here he makes us rulers over
[50:01] there praise God
[50:03] like I told you before we can just
[50:04] overcome our simple humble little
[50:06] battles in life can I say like that amen
[50:08] our humble little insignificant bows if
[50:11] we can just overcome them with a loving
[50:13] testimony that we love Jesus we love our
[50:15] enemies we love the family we love
[50:17] church we love everybody if we can just
[50:19] overcome with that he has great things
[50:21] in store for us he'll make us Kings and
[50:24] Priests unto God he'll give us Thrones
[50:26] the Bible says
[50:28] what awesome Rewards
[50:31] for what seems like such a small
[50:32] sacrifice
[50:34] but how many know he's worthy of all
[50:35] sacrifices
[50:37] Hallelujah
[50:38] the next verse says the rest of the Dead
[50:40] live not again so anyone that
[50:43] wasn't able to overcome like this group
[50:46] in verse 4.
[50:49] they do not live again until the
[50:51] thousand years are finished they they
[50:53] miss the first resurrection
[50:56] but blessed and holy is he that hath
[50:59] part in the First Resurrection on such
[51:01] the second death hath no power but they
[51:05] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[51:07] and shall reign with him a thousand
[51:10] years look at the church priests there's
[51:12] going to be priests in the millennium
[51:15] see what seemed like we would you know
[51:16] if there's going to be priests who what
[51:18] do they they intercede for people it
[51:20] would seem the nations of the world may
[51:21] have some deaths now that just seemed to
[51:23] just come to me right now I actually
[51:24] been thinking about that but the Bible
[51:25] said a child will die a hundred years
[51:27] old
[51:28] but God is going to need priests in the
[51:31] Millennium he's going to need people to
[51:33] reign with him praise God oh my church
[51:35] that's one trumpet I'm listening for not
[51:38] the seven trumpets I'm listening for the
[51:40] last trumpet praise God hallelujah
[51:42] that's what we should live our lives
[51:43] listening for the trumpet is this the
[51:46] day the trumpet sounds is this going to
[51:48] be the day Jesus calls me home praise
[51:49] God
[51:51] that's what we should be listening for
[51:52] praise God living our lives uh we're
[51:54] blessed by his holy spirit we should
[51:56] live holy in his presence praise God we
[51:58] should be living to partake of the first
[52:01] resurrection oh my Hallelujah
[52:04] how do we do that well we got to be
[52:06] priests here
[52:07] we got a Reign here praise God
[52:11] you know I was telling brother Austin
[52:12] you know when he sent out that request
[52:13] about his grandma
[52:15] I couldn't pray for it right away but
[52:17] later on that evening when I had some
[52:18] quiet time I just knelt there on my
[52:20] knees I started praying for your grandma
[52:21] brother just a simple humble prayer
[52:22] that's why I'm so blessed to see it
[52:24] answered praise God then we prayed for
[52:25] it Sunday we wept and cried for your
[52:27] grandma on Sunday we wept tears pleading
[52:30] with God and God turns around he changes
[52:32] the whole uh the the the whole doctor's
[52:35] diagnosis praise God Amen at least 10
[52:39] months now we'll see as at least 10
[52:40] months maybe more to our life praise God
[52:43] because the effectual fervent prayer of
[52:46] a righteous man or woman prevails much
[52:49] in the sight of God Amen amen hallelujah
[52:51] I'll be honest you know sometimes we
[52:53] don't especially feel like praying but
[52:54] it's your job anyway because you're a
[52:56] priest
[52:57] in other words nobody else is going to
[52:58] do it so you got to do it praise God
[52:59] that's right your flesh don't be like it
[53:01] we'll bring your flesh into subjection
[53:02] to the spirit of God that's inside of
[53:04] your soul praise God hallelujah don't
[53:07] let your flesh rule over your soul make
[53:10] sure your soul rules over your flesh
[53:12] Hallelujah
[53:13] let it rule praise God hallelujah come
[53:16] up my soul praise God don't get shy on
[53:18] me praise God hallelujah
[53:20] stir up that Soul say it's your duty to
[53:22] pray God's called you to pray God May
[53:25] answer this quickly praise God
[53:27] we never know praise God
[53:30] brother as soon as I got that testimony
[53:32] I shared it with another brother I said
[53:33] look I said you came to church on your
[53:35] expectation look what God did but we had
[53:37] to wait two days
[53:39] some of us we just want to see it that
[53:41] day right I like to see it that day but
[53:44] God made us wait two days is it any is
[53:46] it any less wonderful
[53:48] is it any less glorious no God teaching
[53:51] us patience God's teaching us endurance
[53:53] God's teaching us faithfulness praise
[53:56] God
[53:57] Hallelujah God's teaching us he cares
[54:00] he's showing us he's faithful he's
[54:01] showing us to wait upon the Lord renew
[54:04] your strength praise God don't let your
[54:05] strength run out don't let it leak out
[54:07] renew your strength like the eagle
[54:09] Hallelujah
[54:10] renew it
[54:12] get a fresh start with strength go and
[54:14] say Lord give me new Strength today I
[54:16] need strength to pray I need strength to
[54:18] witness I need strength to be an
[54:19] intercessor praise God give me strength
[54:21] I need your strength amen
[54:26] Hallelujah
[54:28] one day Church death will have no power
[54:30] over you
[54:31] oh I shouted I should have got Amen on
[54:34] that one by God's grace
[54:35] right there's on such the second death
[54:38] hath no power
[54:40] death slowly creeps into our bodies
[54:43] right brother Ray it slowly creeps into
[54:45] our bodies right slowly creeping in back
[54:48] pain body pains all these pains but one
[54:51] day death will have no power over us
[54:53] amen
[54:55] that's better enjoy it now because one
[54:57] day death is going to get cast in the
[54:58] Lake of Fire amen and death will be no
[55:01] more praise God but you and I will still
[55:03] be here with brand new bodies never
[55:05] experiencing death again never
[55:06] experiencing pain but Eternal Joy the
[55:09] eternal spirit of God
[55:11] amen oh
[55:14] that's what I'm looking for praise God
[55:15] hallelujah
[55:17] what a blessing what a promise
[55:19] and this goes to mighty men and women
[55:22] God's going to give this blessing to
[55:24] mighty men and women who overcome the
[55:25] Beast system
[55:28] in other words their their minds are
[55:30] marked by the Holy Spirit
[55:32] their hands do the works of the of God
[55:36] right giving alms fasting praying The
[55:39] Works of the Lord hallelujah that's what
[55:42] their hands do and that's what their
[55:44] minds do their minds meditate on the
[55:46] things of God they transform their minds
[55:48] by the renewal of it praise God
[55:50] finding the perfect will of God for
[55:52] their lives
[55:54] now this reminded me of Revelation 2 the
[55:56] promise to the the fourth Church age
[55:58] which brother Adam said was the darkest
[56:00] Church age
[56:01] because it was during the Dark Ages
[56:03] those Thousand Years where the Catholic
[56:05] Church uh the Bible was in 500 languages
[56:08] a few years before this but then after
[56:11] this the Bible was down to one language
[56:13] because of the devil's attempts that was
[56:15] the depths of Satan
[56:17] and the Bible says this as many as have
[56:19] not this Doctrine which have not known
[56:21] the depths of Satan as they speak I will
[56:23] put upon you none other burden but that
[56:25] which we have already
[56:27] I'm sorry but that what you have already
[56:29] hold fast till I come
[56:32] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[56:34] works and to the end to him will I give
[56:37] power over the Nations
[56:41] power over the Nations you know our
[56:44] President Joe Biden has power over this
[56:46] nation he can sign an executive order
[56:48] and almost everybody's got to listen to
[56:50] it right
[56:51] it's not official law but he's got power
[56:53] over the nation well Jesus promises if
[56:56] you overcome uh if you overcome
[56:58] balaamism if you overcome the Jezebel
[57:00] spirit praise God if you overcome the
[57:03] lust of the eyes lust of the fresh pride

[1:01:26] now Jesus goes on to say and he not I he
[1:01:29] the Overcomer shall rule them with a rod
[1:01:32] of iron
[1:01:34] as the vessels of a Potter shall that be
[1:01:38] broken to Shivers have you ever seen a
[1:01:40] clay pot
[1:01:42] how many ever drop a a clay pot and it's
[1:01:44] and it shatters
[1:01:46] you ever done that before
[1:01:47] oh yeah I did all we had some out in the
[1:01:49] garage this past fall and I'm sorry
[1:01:50] honey I dropped some of them but they
[1:01:52] were just the real small ones there
[1:01:53] maybe I didn't tell you but I was just
[1:01:55] trying to clean off the shelf yeah she
[1:01:56] said no I didn't tell her forgive me
[1:01:58] we can buy some extra they make more
[1:02:01] they thankfully they make some more but
[1:02:04] I dropped a couple now how many broken
[1:02:05] glass before I mean it's the same it's
[1:02:06] the same idea same picture right
[1:02:09] something so it looks so strong but so
[1:02:12] fragile at the same time
[1:02:14] and Jesus says my people are going to
[1:02:17] rule over this world in the Millennium
[1:02:20] with a rod of iron
[1:02:22] even as Jesus received this command of
[1:02:25] his father praise God hallelujah
[1:02:28] and I'll give him the Morning Star now I
[1:02:30] wish I understood this I don't
[1:02:31] understand this
[1:02:32] each one gets a Morning Star I don't
[1:02:35] know if you get one of those Stars up in
[1:02:36] the heaven I don't know if it's going to
[1:02:37] be something in your pocket I don't know
[1:02:40] I don't know if it's going to be a
[1:02:41] medallion but he said I'm going to give
[1:02:43] you the Morning Star as far as I know
[1:02:45] there's only one morning star that's
[1:02:46] Jesus the Bright Morning Star
[1:02:48] so I don't understand that but we gain
[1:02:50] that but don't miss the 27.
[1:02:53] and all you got to do to have 27 is do
[1:02:55] this hear what the spirit says to the
[1:02:58] church today praise God
[1:03:01] if you hear what the spirit says today
[1:03:03] you'll be an overcomer
[1:03:05] Hallelujah
[1:03:06] now where where did Jesus get this
[1:03:09] language from where did John get this
[1:03:10] language from where did Jesus get it you
[1:03:11] got it from the book of Psalm chapter
[1:03:12] two
[1:03:14] yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill
[1:03:17] of Zion I will declare the decree the
[1:03:19] Lord has said unto me thou art my son
[1:03:20] this day I begotten thee ask of me and I
[1:03:23] should give thee Heathen for thine
[1:03:25] inheritance
[1:03:27] and the uttermost parts of the Earth for
[1:03:29] thy possession so the father saying to
[1:03:31] the son ask anything and I'll give it
[1:03:34] unto you
[1:03:35] and God tells the son Thou shalt break
[1:03:38] them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash
[1:03:41] them in pieces like a Potter's vessel
[1:03:43] imagine take if we had Potter's vessels
[1:03:46] up here and you had a a rod of iron
[1:03:48] imagine how easy boom boom
[1:03:52] boom imagine it would just be so simple
[1:03:54] all you got to do is just line it up if
[1:03:56] you just line it up the iron is going to
[1:03:58] fall it's going to break the vessels
[1:03:59] that's what Jesus does and will do to
[1:04:02] every nation under Heaven amen oh he'll
[1:04:05] do that to America praise God he'll do
[1:04:07] that to Russia he'll do that to China
[1:04:08] he'll do it to Saudi Arabia Iraq
[1:04:11] Zimbabwe everyone Australia he will
[1:04:14] crush any man-made rule because it will
[1:04:16] no longer be men's day it will be the
[1:04:19] Lord's Day praise God oh and as easy as
[1:04:22] that is to crush clay pots that's how
[1:04:24] easy it will be when Jesus comes back in
[1:04:26] Armageddon Hallelujah
[1:04:28] and the sword goes out of his mouth and
[1:04:30] slays all his enemies
[1:04:32] and then Jesus said that's what it's
[1:04:34] going to be like when you're on the
[1:04:35] Earth
[1:04:36] in other words like that example
[1:04:38] when it's your time to give a decree
[1:04:41] hallelujah it's going to be followed
[1:04:43] through
[1:04:44] but you have to live right right now
[1:04:47] praise God you have to overcome now you
[1:04:50] got to Reign Over sin now praise God
[1:04:54] and then Jesus gives you a minor
[1:04:56] experience of what his experience will
[1:04:58] be like
[1:04:59] Hallelujah he'll do it on the major
[1:05:00] scale Armageddon he'll destroy Every
[1:05:03] Nation on the Lord's day and then he'll
[1:05:04] give you the authority praise God it
[1:05:07] gives he gives the Overcomer the
[1:05:09] authority to rule over a nation
[1:05:12] now for me church I'll probably I'm the
[1:05:14] least in the Kingdom so as long as I get
[1:05:15] at least one city to rule over I'll be a
[1:05:17] Victor praise God
[1:05:19] remember some people get 10 cities here
[1:05:20] he says rules over Nations I just hope I
[1:05:22] get one city to rule over praise God
[1:05:24] right we just want we just know God's
[1:05:27] promise we just want to be faithful
[1:05:28] we're not in other words we're not we're
[1:05:30] not competing against others but we do
[1:05:31] want to be faithful we do want to see
[1:05:33] Jesus give us a rod of iron we do want
[1:05:35] to be faithful we do want to be
[1:05:36] Overcomers is what I'm saying praise God
[1:05:40] Lord make me an overcomer by God's grace
[1:05:44] the Bible said do you not know the
[1:05:46] Saints shall judge the world judge the
[1:05:48] world
[1:05:50] know ye not that we shall judge Angels
[1:05:53] we'll judge Fallen Angels whoever we
[1:05:54] preach on those nephilims on on Sunday
[1:05:56] night we'll judge them
[1:05:58] we shall judge them they're the same
[1:06:00] ones same ones from the days of Adam and
[1:06:02] Eve right the demons never die same one
[1:06:04] down Through the Ages
[1:06:06] the same ones that deceived all you know
[1:06:08] deceive Moses and and deceive David and
[1:06:10] Solomon those same demons are still here
[1:06:13] today but we have power we have access
[1:06:16] to more power than them praise God we
[1:06:18] have better promises how many can say
[1:06:20] Amen to that you have better promises
[1:06:22] you have more power you can be an
[1:06:24] overcomer today praise God
[1:06:26] you don't have to fall like Moses as a
[1:06:28] murderer you don't have to fall like
[1:06:29] David as an adulterer praise God you
[1:06:31] have to be like any liar in the Bible
[1:06:32] like a Jonah you don't have to run from
[1:06:34] the presence of the Lord you can run
[1:06:35] into the friends of the Lord
[1:06:38] I get a little excited here
[1:06:42] we don't have to be like that yeah we're
[1:06:43] going to have shortcomings and Barbara
[1:06:45] says minor sins
[1:06:46] but we have access to more power
[1:06:49] we can be real Overcomers we can be
[1:06:52] Victors in this life remember he always
[1:06:55] causes you to Triumph in Christ
[1:06:58] don't forget your promises mighty men
[1:07:00] and women

[1:07:08] Christ Jesus
[1:07:09] I always come out on top because my king
[1:07:12] never loses a battle praise God
[1:07:14] always
[1:07:16] come on
[1:07:17] Jesus fighting for me pray
[1:07:20] I'm Malachi the
[1:07:21] Lord buddy if the battle is not yours
[1:07:24] the battle is the Lord's Glory
[1:07:26] let God fight your battle praise God
[1:07:28] take God's word and let the Flaming
[1:07:31] sword of the word of God cut through the
[1:07:33] enemy let the word do what it's supposed
[1:07:35] to do that's the only thing that can get
[1:07:37] through your enemy is the word of God
[1:07:39] let the word do its work Hallelujah
[1:07:42] thus if we're trying to let's stop
[1:07:43] trying to do the work let's let God do
[1:07:45] the work
[1:07:47] Hallelujah
[1:07:48] let's let God's word go forth let's
[1:07:52] believe God's word God's promises
[1:07:55] now the mature way as you know the
[1:07:57] mature way is find the will of God first
[1:08:00] find the will of and that's the hard
[1:08:02] thing that most people don't want to
[1:08:03] hear uh not maybe not our church but
[1:08:05] most people just want to say well I
[1:08:07] believe it I'll speak it I'll speak it
[1:08:08] but first find the will of God first
[1:08:11] speak this say Speak Lord I know you're
[1:08:13] going to say Lord I know you're going to
[1:08:14] show me your perfect will
[1:08:16] speak that and the church said
[1:08:19] just don't speak what you want make sure
[1:08:20] God wants you to have it first
[1:08:22] Hallelujah
[1:08:24] speak what God wants speak I want your
[1:08:27] will God Amen I want your will not my
[1:08:29] will Lord give me the will of Heaven let
[1:08:32] Heaven's will come down to earth praise
[1:08:33] God
[1:08:34] let Heaven come down to my life
[1:08:37] you'll judge Angels because you judged
[1:08:40] righteously in your life
[1:08:43] right we should be able to judge lie
[1:08:46] we should be able to judge stealing
[1:08:48] we should be able to judge homosexuality
[1:08:50] we shall we should be able to judge
[1:08:52] adultery and fornication
[1:08:54] and any any wickedness we should be able
[1:08:57] to judge that blasphemies we should be
[1:08:59] able to judge that Abominations
[1:09:02] we should be able to judge this and if
[1:09:03] we judge it right here he makes us a
[1:09:05] judge later and I imagine he gives you a
[1:09:07] special robe too not a black one he
[1:09:09] gives you a white robe praise God
[1:09:10] hallelujah
[1:09:12] white like his amen
[1:09:16] and you'll judge Angels you'll judge the
[1:09:18] world
[1:09:19] mighty men and women will do it praise
[1:09:21] God
[1:09:22] those who are Mighty in the scripture
[1:09:24] those who let the power of God Work
[1:09:26] mightily in them I'm going kind of slow
[1:09:29] but I wish I could speed it up here
[1:09:31] I love this quote from the church age
[1:09:32] book I got to read it some of this is
[1:09:34] review if you've been around I think I
[1:09:35] think I preaches in 2017. some of these
[1:09:37] things
[1:09:39] Jesus says he that overcomes and keeps
[1:09:41] my Works unto the end it's very evident
[1:09:44] from these remarks of the spirit on
[1:09:45] works that the Lord is trying to get his
[1:09:47] own to see his opinion of righteous
[1:09:49] works
[1:09:50] hey church I know we're saved by grace
[1:09:52] but don't forget after you're saved show
[1:09:53] God how much you appreciate your
[1:09:54] salvation
[1:09:55] and do some work for God tomorrow and
[1:09:57] the church said
[1:10:00] I believe saved by grace I'm not
[1:10:02] preaching work salvation I'm preaching
[1:10:04] get saved and then you'll want to do
[1:10:05] works praise God
[1:10:07] you want to work for the master praise
[1:10:08] God Amen not work for the devil you want
[1:10:10] to work for the master
[1:10:12] we need God's opinion of Works four
[1:10:14] times he mentions work Jesus does in the
[1:10:16] this forced Church age and now he says
[1:10:18] that he who keeps doing his Works
[1:10:20] Faithfully Until the End we'll be giving
[1:10:21] power over Nation see church this is why
[1:10:24] it's so important to find your gifts and
[1:10:25] your ministry in your life now dads and
[1:10:27] mothers it's kind of built into your
[1:10:29] life but you still have gifts on top of
[1:10:30] that so so keep seeking for your gifts
[1:10:32] praise God
[1:10:33] right you got to take care of your own
[1:10:35] the Bible says if a man don't take care
[1:10:36] of his own right it's worse than the
[1:10:37] Infidel right
[1:10:39] but see we got to find out what he's
[1:10:41] called us to do and if we're faithful
[1:10:43] with it he'll make us rulers over the
[1:10:45] Nations
[1:10:47] if you can just be faithful with your
[1:10:49] life your responsibility your circle of
[1:10:52] influence just be faithful with your job
[1:10:53] just be faithful in your church just be
[1:10:55] faithful in your family and I'll make
[1:10:57] you a rule over Nation Jesus says amen
[1:11:03] anyone that Faithfully does the works
[1:11:05] will be a strong capable unbending ruler
[1:11:07] imagine that in the Millennium no one
[1:11:09] will be able to tempt you
[1:11:11] to take a bribe
[1:11:13] well I just harvested you know uh 500
[1:11:16] pounds of grapes I'll give you that if
[1:11:18] you can allow me to do this murder or
[1:11:19] whatever no one's going to make you move
[1:11:22] no get behind me Satan I know of course
[1:11:24] there'll be no sin in the million but
[1:11:25] you understand they won't be able to
[1:11:27] bribe you
[1:11:28] because you'll be unbending because you
[1:11:30] have a glorified body
[1:11:32] amen even your flesh will be glorified
[1:11:35] amen you'll feel the glory all the time
[1:11:37] in your body praise God oh like I'm
[1:11:40] feeling tonight
[1:11:43] you'll be unbending and you can cope you
[1:11:46] can handle so powerfully with any
[1:11:48] situation
[1:11:49] that even the most desperate enemy will
[1:11:51] be broken if need be see broken right
[1:11:54] Shivers picture that Jesus breaking the
[1:11:57] pots Jesus breaking the vessels amen
[1:11:59] picture you breaking some vessels praise
[1:12:02] God
[1:12:03] Jesus breaking the vessels it's not even
[1:12:05] hard it's just a matter of gravity it's
[1:12:07] just a matter of effort it's just a
[1:12:09] matter of want to praise God save it is
[1:12:11] for you and I it's just a matter of our
[1:12:13] effort to overcome the gates of hell
[1:12:15] that come against us we are more than
[1:12:17] conquerors praise God we don't have to
[1:12:19] be defeated we are Overcomers
[1:12:22] Hallelujah
[1:12:25] his demonstration of rule by power will
[1:12:28] be likened unto the very Sons Jesus
[1:12:31] Christ this is very amazing
[1:12:33] see keeping the commands builds up your
[1:12:36] character in such a way you become
[1:12:38] unbending
[1:12:39] you will not give in to the sin because
[1:12:41] I've got a streak of all these days
[1:12:43] Glory I got a streak of all these weeks
[1:12:45] I got a streak of all these years I'm
[1:12:47] unbending I've got power I've got the
[1:12:49] character of Christ I will not Bend to
[1:12:51] the devil I'll overcome the devil praise
[1:12:53] God
[1:12:55] Hallelujah
[1:12:58] that's who Jesus gives power over the
[1:13:00] Nations to
[1:13:02] those who can be so unbending and stay
[1:13:05] with the word obey the truth and they
[1:13:07] can handle any situation
[1:13:10] now I know I'm a school teacher but I've
[1:13:12] got a pretty difficult class this year
[1:13:16] and it's actually pushing me further
[1:13:17] than I I thought I had I could go
[1:13:20] I'm being tested more than I've ever
[1:13:22] been tested in a lot of years
[1:13:24] people have asked me today they said
[1:13:25] have you ever had a class like this I
[1:13:26] said never in 20 years 19 years I've
[1:13:28] never had a class like this
[1:13:30] because once you have a class like that
[1:13:31] you never forget that class
[1:13:34] they put a scar on your spirit
[1:13:36] a broken Spirit who can who can bear
[1:13:39] well no I just you know sometimes I got
[1:13:41] spit on the last few weeks I got spit on
[1:13:42] I've gotten smacked I've got my uh tie

[1:13:55] decisions I love you
[1:13:57] push to the limits there's nothing more
[1:14:00] disrespectful than being spit on
[1:14:03] but see we got to handle any situation
[1:14:05] and cope with it so powerfully that it's
[1:14:08] just like how Jesus would handle
[1:14:11] and like I said our little trials are
[1:14:13] just light trials
[1:14:16] like they say small potatoes
[1:14:18] our trials our battles are just small
[1:14:20] potatoes now let's talk about somebody
[1:14:22] going to kill you now that's a real
[1:14:23] that's a real battle right there
[1:14:26] Martyrs that's a real battle
[1:14:29] but let's listen George if I can't cope
[1:14:30] with my Trouse how am I going to cope
[1:14:32] with other trials God's Got To Build Me

[1:14:56] where you do not Bend anymore
[1:14:59] you don't break you stand firm on the

[1:15:28] today and forever and then when the holy
[1:15:30] city comes down to New Jerusalem the
[1:15:32] Bible said the nations of them which are
[1:15:34] saved shall walk in the Light of Christ
[1:15:37] the future always has to be a pyramid or
[1:15:39] else if it's a it's a cube the light
[1:15:41] can't go it'll just go out you know but
[1:15:43] it's got to be a pyramid so the light
[1:15:44] goes down and out and everywhere and so
[1:15:47] all the nations of the world can walk in
[1:15:49] the light of Jesus
[1:15:52] the Bible said the kings of the earth do
[1:15:54] bring their Glory and Honor into it the
[1:15:56] Bible said the gates don't even close
[1:15:59] there's no reason to close the gates
[1:16:01] there's no reason like right every night
[1:16:03] every night at home I walked I walked
[1:16:04] make sure all our four doors are locked
[1:16:06] every night
[1:16:07] I don't want anybody coming in because
[1:16:09] one night it was left open
[1:16:10] just by uh a child that's all the
[1:16:14] details I'll give
[1:16:15] all night I wonder why is it a little
[1:16:17] chilly in here
[1:16:19] the back door's wide open
[1:16:20] they got us in the summertime too right
[1:16:24] but that's but that same Freedom now I
[1:16:26] don't we don't like that here but over
[1:16:28] there that's how it's going to be the
[1:16:29] gates are going to be open anybody can
[1:16:30] come in there'll be no night because
[1:16:33] we're Children of the day praise God
[1:16:34] we're not children of the night we don't
[1:16:37] walk in darkness we're always walking
[1:16:38] the light praise God as he is in the
[1:16:41] light Hallelujah
[1:16:46] and church if we're faithful I always
[1:16:47] love this picture I'm going to pull that
[1:16:49] picture back up there if we're faithful
[1:16:51] the gates we're going to have one of
[1:16:53] those we're going to have one of these
[1:16:54] little Mansions mine's probably right
[1:16:56] there right in the corner that's
[1:16:57] probably mine right there and then you
[1:16:59] know you know then my children you know
[1:17:00] right there you know
[1:17:03] Hallelujah I think Paul and Peter are
[1:17:05] going to be living up there don't you I
[1:17:06] think that's I think that's where
[1:17:08] they're gonna live
[1:17:10] but work Church we're gonna see those
[1:17:11] Gates they open and the kings of the
[1:17:13] Earth are going to flow into this city
[1:17:14] look they're going to walk right down by
[1:17:15] that River up to the king
[1:17:17] they're going to bring all their Glory
[1:17:19] think of all the produce they'll bring
[1:17:20] in think of the gems and the jewels and
[1:17:23] they'll bring all of this up to the king
[1:17:26] and what what we have never have to
[1:17:27] leave the king will always be in his
[1:17:30] presence we won't be living outside the
[1:17:32] city we get to live in the city praise
[1:17:34] God because he went to prepare a mansion
[1:17:36] for you and I praise God
[1:17:38] because you overcame now Hallelujah
[1:17:41] because you let him live with you now he
[1:17:44] lets you live with him later praise God
[1:17:46] hallelujah thank God lord just give me
[1:17:49] that little Corner Spot there by God's
[1:17:51] grace
[1:17:53] you'll know it's me you just hear that
[1:17:55] guy singing This is Amazing Grace
[1:18:00] let me singing oh how he loves you and
[1:18:04] me
[1:18:05] he gave his life what more that's
[1:18:08] brother Jesse what more could he do
[1:18:09] praise God
[1:18:13] Hallelujah think of it the Bible says
[1:18:15] they're going to have Glory Treasures
[1:18:16] Crowns who I was talking about a crown
[1:18:18] for the overcomer scepters robes I mean
[1:18:22] think about this Kingdom
[1:18:24] the Overcomer at least some of them gets
[1:18:27] rods for the the scepters
[1:18:29] they got robes on
[1:18:32] it's a whole brand new kingdom
[1:18:34] we can't really fathom it now the best
[1:18:36] clothes we can get now
[1:18:38] is Rags compared to those white robes
[1:18:41] rags and then well Jesus will give us
[1:18:43] crowns for overcoming it's unbelievable
[1:18:47] praise God
[1:18:48] the the honor that'll give to someone
[1:18:51] who can judge the matters correct today
[1:18:53] praise God
[1:18:55] if we can judge him right now he makes
[1:18:57] us judge over them later
[1:19:00] and we'll watch the kings of the Earth
[1:19:01] come in bring their Glory
[1:19:04] like they're grapes they're strawberries
[1:19:06] they're corn now probably like those
[1:19:09] original grapes they had in Canaan right
[1:19:10] two men got to carry a big huge bundle
[1:19:12] of them they're so big
[1:19:15] they'll bring all their Treasures into
[1:19:16] it now look Kings they're still mighty
[1:19:18] men like these are these are Kings
[1:19:19] outside the city
[1:19:23] or maybe this church maybe the Kings
[1:19:25] will live in maybe we'll we'll be these
[1:19:28] Kings and maybe we'll rule over the
[1:19:30] Nations and we'll go out to our nation
[1:19:31] and then we'll maybe maybe then we'll
[1:19:33] lead our nation in there praise God
[1:19:35] and they'll bring all the the fruits of
[1:19:37] their Ministries into the into the King
[1:19:39] City praise God the King City
[1:19:42] hallelujah thank God
[1:19:47] now I want to read this uh look
[1:19:49] the the
[1:19:51] the Bible writers look at this too now
[1:19:53] this is something you want to catch too
[1:19:54] the king shall be thy nursing fathers
[1:19:57] and their Queens thy nursing mothers now
[1:19:59] they're speaking to Israel but there
[1:20:00] could be a type here they shall bow down
[1:20:02] to thee with their face toward the Earth
[1:20:03] and lick up the dust to thy feet and
[1:20:05] thou shalt know that I am the Lord for
[1:20:07] they shall not be ashamed that wait for
[1:20:09] me
[1:20:10] in other words the kings and queens of
[1:20:12] the Earth are going to bring all their
[1:20:14] nurture or all their their produce and
[1:20:16] all their uh other food and everything
[1:20:19] into the city
[1:20:21] I'm sorry or it's a millennium could be
[1:20:23] one or the other
[1:20:24] and notice there's with each case all of
[1:20:27] them bow down before the bride and the
[1:20:29] Jews
[1:20:31] and their faces lick the Dust
[1:20:34] think about that
[1:20:37] that's what the Bible says
[1:20:39] Jesus said the same thing he says behold
[1:20:42] I make I will make them of the synagogue
[1:20:44] of Satan which say they are are Jews and
[1:20:46] are not but do lie behold I'll make them
[1:20:48] come and worship before thy feet to know
[1:20:50] that I have loved thee
[1:20:52] why because you've kept the word of my
[1:20:54] patience so all those that don't keep
[1:20:57] the word come down and bow down to those
[1:20:59] that do keep the word of God
[1:21:01] isn't that something
[1:21:03] a church none of us want anybody to bow
[1:21:05] down before us but Jesus gives us that
[1:21:07] reward Hallelujah if we bow down to him
[1:21:10] today can you say Amen to that if we can
[1:21:11] Bow Down and Worship Jesus today he's
[1:21:13] going to make all those who didn't bow
[1:21:15] down before us
[1:21:17] as the ultimate sign that we were
[1:21:19] Overcomers that we kept the word of God
[1:21:22] that we made sacrifices in this life we
[1:21:25] were rejected in this life but we were
[1:21:26] accepted in the next slide praise God he
[1:21:29] makes all those that wouldn't bother
[1:21:30] Christ bow down at your feet
[1:21:34] because you've kept the word of God
[1:21:38] now brother man met this man in 1953 and
[1:21:41] he said what do you mean brother said
[1:21:42] you mean tell me all those Christians
[1:21:43] that ever died
[1:21:45] all those born-again people will be on
[1:21:48] the earth he says you couldn't place
[1:21:49] them on this earth like cordwood now
[1:21:51] cordwood is chopped wood so think of all
[1:21:54] the stacked wood those guys that have
[1:21:55] you know those uh
[1:21:57] yeah what are they called
[1:21:59] Carpenters yeah they have all this wood
[1:22:00] stacked and they have their heating
[1:22:01] stoves what they call those stoves wood
[1:22:03] burning stoves sorry
[1:22:06] seems so simple
[1:22:08] well I don't have one that's why I can't
[1:22:09] think of it so
[1:22:10] but they have these huge stacks of wood
[1:22:12] and this man tells brother Adam you mean
[1:22:14] tell me all these people are going to go
[1:22:15] in the Rapture you couldn't even fit
[1:22:16] them in here like like cord would
[1:22:18] but random said who said they'd be here
[1:22:20] on Earth like cord would
[1:22:22] he said my heavenly father stood back
[1:22:24] there and blowed off his hands moons
[1:22:28] Stars
[1:22:31] moons there'll be millions of Worlds out
[1:22:34] yonder wow well my hard to tell where
[1:22:36] we'll live out in them great places
[1:22:39] now we might start in the future city
[1:22:40] but hard to tell where Jesus will take
[1:22:42] us amen hard to tell where he may send
[1:22:45] you praise God
[1:22:47] in other words if there ain't enough
[1:22:49] room on this Earth for enough Kings to
[1:22:51] rule he'll give you a word to rule
[1:22:54] praise God
[1:22:55] he'll give you a different world if
[1:22:57] there ain't enough room here praise God
[1:23:00] because he can just blow him off his
[1:23:01] hand
[1:23:03] oh that's that might be how he gives you
[1:23:05] the Morning Star right he might place
[1:23:07] you out there I'm gonna put a star right
[1:23:08] next to brother Jessica's Planet there
[1:23:10] now you got the Morning Star
[1:23:14] he said how about over 10 cities in all
[1:23:17] these cities he said he'd overcome a
[1:23:18] sharula over here I said why God's got
[1:23:20] worlds on top of Worlds and places on
[1:23:23] top can I say like this Jesus gives us
[1:23:25] blessings on top of blessings on top of
[1:23:27] blessings he answers prayer on top of
[1:23:30] prayer he gives us healing on top of
[1:23:32] healing he gives us Mercy on top of
[1:23:34] Mercy he gives us forgiveness on top of
[1:23:37] forgiveness he's got Grace upon Grace
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:40] this is amazing grace Hallelujah
[1:23:43] and if he needs it he's got worlds on
[1:23:46] top of worlds
[1:23:47] if he runs out of Nations that's okay he
[1:23:49] can make his own all right he don't need
[1:23:51] our help
[1:23:53] he'll just blow him out there
[1:23:56] that's right you stop right there
[1:23:58] he can do it
[1:24:00] so George in other words don't worry
[1:24:01] about the math don't don't be trying to
[1:24:03] Crunch in the math you just trust in the
[1:24:04] math the mathematician praise God
[1:24:07] he's trusting the master
[1:24:12] said how can our little infinite mind
[1:24:15] limit God
[1:24:17] why we can't there's no way at all to
[1:24:19] express to him when we look out and see
[1:24:21] how vast God is in his Universe why how
[1:24:23] marvelous but to think that he would be
[1:24:25] so concerned to come down to the lowest
[1:24:27] individual and the worst drunk or Harlot
[1:24:30] there is in Chicago or Akron that's
[1:24:31] right and save them that's love how many
[1:24:33] can say Amen in that
[1:24:35] he formed all these plans he formed all
[1:24:37] these stars but yet he'll come to Akron
[1:24:39] Ohio yet he'll come to Ghana Hallelujah
[1:24:41] that'll come to us he'll come to Illyria
[1:24:44] wherever you're from Brother Lorraine
[1:24:46] amen wherever you're from he'll come to
[1:24:48] you or South Carolina amen hallelujah
[1:24:51] you're out there in Arizona he'll come
[1:24:52] to you praise God because he loves you
[1:24:54] he's got a plan for you he wants you to
[1:24:56] overcome and he wants you to rule on
[1:24:59] Earth praise God amen amen he said
[1:25:02] that's love
[1:25:04] praise God
[1:25:05] when the God of all the universe comes
[1:25:07] down to your your place
[1:25:09] visit your church
[1:25:11] visit your house amen
[1:25:13] and gives you Grace and gives you power
[1:25:16] to rule and reign in this life so you
[1:25:19] can reign in the next life praise God
[1:25:21] Amen
[1:25:22] amen hallelujah
[1:25:24] I've said it before let them have their
[1:25:25] big jobs let them have their big money
[1:25:27] just let me have Jesus
[1:25:29] just let me have a faithful life let me
[1:25:32] just be a real Christian let me have a
[1:25:34] real Christian testimony that I'm an
[1:25:36] overcomer that's where it's more than
[1:25:37] everything praise God
[1:25:40] if somebody can see Jesus Christ in my
[1:25:42] humble little life
[1:25:44] Hallelujah
[1:25:46] it's worth any sacrifice
[1:25:49] because he's infinite he's Unlimited
[1:25:53] he can go Way Beyond my limited
[1:25:55] imagination
[1:25:58] well brother Jess how could I ever be
[1:25:59] this all I do is take care of the kids
[1:26:01] all I do is feed the kids well if you're
[1:26:03] faithful in that you'll probably rule
[1:26:04] over kids later or you'll be faithful
[1:26:06] later praise God because you were
[1:26:08] faithful with the ministry God gave you
[1:26:11] he'll make you ruler over much the Bible
[1:26:13] says
[1:26:14] faithful with little is faithful with
[1:26:16] much
[1:26:18] so churches picture that again
[1:26:20] there's going to be that's going to be
[1:26:22] all filled with mighty men and women who
[1:26:24] overcame
[1:26:26] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:26:29] their testimony
[1:26:30] only Overcomers are going to live there
[1:26:32] praise God
[1:26:33] the foolish version they get to come in
[1:26:36] but they don't get to stay
[1:26:38] imagine how sad they're going to be now
[1:26:39] that I know they're looking at perfect
[1:26:40] bodies right you know I said they're
[1:26:42] going to be when they got to leave
[1:26:44] and we get to stay say love you all
[1:26:47] God bless you
[1:26:49] but we get to stay with Jesus praise God
[1:26:51] they've got to leave that that that
[1:26:53] physical presence of Christ but we get
[1:26:55] to stay in that presence
[1:26:58] because we overcame
[1:27:01] Hallelujah
[1:27:03] because we judge the matters the right
[1:27:05] way here so he'll make us judges over
[1:27:08] there
[1:27:09] in some Holy City
[1:27:14] now this I said all this to get to this
[1:27:18] I said all that 45 minutes of preaching
[1:27:21] this is the thought that I got that I
[1:27:22] want to share brother Brown preached the
[1:27:23] sermon cut the contest how many ever
[1:27:25] heard that before amen real short sermon
[1:27:27] it was the New Year's Eve service 1962
[1:27:30] December 31st
[1:27:32] he had 30 minutes before the new year
[1:27:34] came in 1963 came in and he comes up to
[1:27:37] the pulp and preaches the contest out of
[1:27:39] Ephesians 6 12. I'm going to read it
[1:27:41] Ephesians 6 12.
[1:27:46] Ephesians 6 12.
[1:27:50] a contest is a test of strength
[1:27:55] in other words this life is testing you
[1:27:57] to see how strong you are
[1:28:00] that's all this is
[1:28:01] this is a contest to see how Mighty you
[1:28:04] are brother
[1:28:05] Hallelujah that's all it is
[1:28:08] it's a contest how strong are you
[1:28:09] brother
[1:28:10] sister how strong are you that's all
[1:28:12] this life is
[1:28:13] how strong are you
[1:28:15] what can you handle
[1:28:17] what can you cope with
[1:28:19] how strong can you be
[1:28:23] now we laugh at bodybuilders because we
[1:28:24] know they're wasting their lives
[1:28:26] and when they get older they get a lot
[1:28:27] of flab when they get older okay
[1:28:29] because I've seen them
[1:28:30] they gotta have surgery and all these
[1:28:32] things but really that's what we're
[1:28:34] doing spiritually we're building our
[1:28:36] faith muscles praise God Amen
[1:28:39] and the goal of our Christianity the
[1:28:41] Bible says is to build up your Most Holy
[1:28:44] Faith by praying in the Holy Ghost
[1:28:47] and to live and that when you have that
[1:28:49] strength then you live by every word
[1:28:51] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:28:54] Hallelujah
[1:28:56] well the ram says goes back to the
[1:28:58] Native Americans they used to have a
[1:29:00] fire and they put so many end on this
[1:29:02] rope men on this rope so many end and
[1:29:04] they have a tug of war it was a contest
[1:29:07] to pull the losing party Into the Fire
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:12] and now we know there's many things we
[1:29:14] could base this on for a few minutes but
[1:29:15] I want to speak of these events quickly
[1:29:17] the greatest contest there is is between
[1:29:20] you and Satan amen
[1:29:23] there's no greater contest
[1:29:25] I don't care when the World Series
[1:29:27] starts that's not a contest
[1:29:30] the Super Bowl that's not a contest
[1:29:34] the greatest contest is between Satan
[1:29:37] and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:40] who's stronger
[1:29:44] that great strength of Satanist does
[1:29:46] brother and call him a dumb devil
[1:29:49] No in fact this ceremony twice he says
[1:29:51] he's getting stronger every day
[1:29:53] because the love of God is waxing coat
[1:29:54] in other words there's less love so he
[1:29:56] gets more influence over people
[1:29:58] his influence grows every day well so is
[1:30:02] your influence growing every day amen
[1:30:04] hallelujah thank God
[1:30:07] and we want to speak of the great
[1:30:09] strength of God in his I'm going to
[1:30:11] change it to bride
[1:30:13] because Church means called out yeah and
[1:30:16] he said we're called out for his
[1:30:17] namesake a bride's sake
[1:30:21] now this great contest is going on for
[1:30:22] many years six thousand years starred in
[1:30:24] heaven Satan was kicked out into the
[1:30:25] Earth he become the enemy to God's
[1:30:27] people since then he's used all of his
[1:30:28] strength and his strategy to try to pull
[1:30:30] God's people across the fires into the
[1:30:32] virus imagine that Satan tonight is
[1:30:33] trying to pull you into a fire
[1:30:36] of sin
[1:30:39] a life of disgrace he's trying to pull
[1:30:41] you into the fire and burn up your
[1:30:43] testimony
[1:30:46] that's all it is
[1:30:48] that's all this week was his attempt to
[1:30:50] pull you he's imagine he's on the other
[1:30:52] end of the road when you're looking look
[1:30:54] at him in the face every day
[1:30:55] oh no say you're not getting me today
[1:30:57] I've got I got some spiritual muscles I
[1:31:00] took my vitamins last night praise God I
[1:31:02] just took my vitamins in prayer amen
[1:31:04] you're coming in the fire praise God
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:08] that's all this is a contest of who's
[1:31:12] stronger amen
[1:31:13] Satan or you
[1:31:16] of course it won't be you it'll be
[1:31:18] Christ in you because greater is he
[1:31:20] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:31:23] world
[1:31:25] so in other words you got to hold on
[1:31:26] that rope and say God give me your
[1:31:29] strength upon this road
[1:31:31] because my hands are if I use my
[1:31:33] strength my hands are going to get all
[1:31:35] these uh all these cows there you go I
[1:31:37] can never think of these words here I
[1:31:39] worked all day so I'm sorry I got about
[1:31:40] 5 15 to study so forgive me I can't
[1:31:43] remember all these words I get all these
[1:31:45] calluses I'll get i'll get bleeding Lord
[1:31:47] if you don't give me strength I'm gonna
[1:31:49] lose this I'm gonna get burnt today God
[1:31:51] keep me from being burned I imagine just
[1:31:53] about that time the Living Waters and
[1:31:56] the fire starts burning up and you feel
[1:31:58] the strength return you get that second
[1:32:00] win praise God
[1:32:02] and you pull the enemy into the fire
[1:32:04] praise God Hallelujah the Bible said he
[1:32:07] leaves for a season
[1:32:09] you can shake off the hands thank God I
[1:32:11] guess I'll get some uh bomb on these uh
[1:32:13] on these calluses here Bob and Gilead
[1:32:16] thank God there's Bob and Gilead today
[1:32:18] praise God
[1:32:21] but see sometimes our tug of wars lasts
[1:32:23] a long time how many understand that
[1:32:25] ain't just five minute tug of war
[1:32:28] sometimes it's days
[1:32:30] sometimes it's weeks sometimes it's six
[1:32:32] years brother amen just testified he had
[1:32:34] a whole year of a tug of war right
[1:32:36] sister a whole year of struggling a
[1:32:39] whole year I felt like I was tugging
[1:32:40] with him imagine we had tug of war last
[1:32:44] year at school my team won thankfully
[1:32:46] but I think we out know I think we
[1:32:47] outnumbered them too I think that's why
[1:32:49] we won
[1:32:50] so I was thankful for the victory though
[1:32:51] by God's grace I don't want to be
[1:32:52] pulling the fire
[1:32:55] he says
[1:32:57] he's trying to pull you into the fires
[1:32:59] of sin
[1:33:02] and we know who has the most power
[1:33:06] God does
[1:33:08] and God when he gave his people the best
[1:33:10] thing that he could give give him the
[1:33:11] compass combat Saint with was his word
[1:33:14] because the word is God and who's
[1:33:17] stronger than God so the word is God and
[1:33:20] the word becomes our strength
[1:33:23] God in his church becomes its strength
[1:33:27] to pull Satan to his own fires that he
[1:33:30] has made praise God
[1:33:32] Hallelujah
[1:33:34] oh it's so beautiful just like Haman he
[1:33:36] got hung by his own
[1:33:39] his own Gallows there it is my
[1:33:41] vocabulary is really down today forgive
[1:33:43] me
[1:33:44] his own Gallows praise God
[1:33:47] right Ahab got licked up by the very
[1:33:49] dogs
[1:33:50] right in that same place where he tried
[1:33:52] to get the land the same land that he
[1:33:53] had he thought he had he got licked up
[1:33:55] in the same location praise God the dogs
[1:33:58] licked his blood same thing with Jezebel
[1:34:01] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] amen what Satan works out for your
[1:34:05] demise will always do him in praise God
[1:34:09] whatever he's planned for you if you if
[1:34:12] you take the strength of God if you
[1:34:14] trust in the strength of God you'll pull
[1:34:15] him into his own trap praise God he'll
[1:34:18] get trapped in his own trap he'll get
[1:34:20] lost in his own fire praise God
[1:34:22] Hallelujah
[1:34:26] and the Bible says and the brother says
[1:34:28] you can do that by God's power
[1:34:30] you can bring Satan into his own fire
[1:34:33] Hallelujah
[1:34:37] was the word of God the best thing
[1:34:39] and the tug goes on see in my name
[1:34:42] they'll cast out devils
[1:34:44] Hallelujah in other words in my name
[1:34:46] they'll tug and the Devils will be cast
[1:34:48] out the Devils will be burnt praise God
[1:34:50] in the spiritual sense we're talking
[1:34:51] about the Devils will be defeated in my
[1:34:54] name in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:57] how many seen done before praise God
[1:34:59] Amen
[1:35:00] Hallelujah
[1:35:04] now I'm going to skip down to this dark
[1:35:05] part because I'm trying to finish the
[1:35:06] black part there the ballpark but the
[1:35:08] thing to do in my opinion is know your
[1:35:10] enemy
[1:35:12] train for the contest that you're going
[1:35:14] to have when you meet him because you're
[1:35:16] going to meet him
[1:35:18] in other words you can't escape the tug
[1:35:20] of war
[1:35:22] you can try to ignore the calendar well
[1:35:24] I'm not going to have any trials I'm
[1:35:25] never going to be tested oh no but
[1:35:27] there's a there's a date on there that
[1:35:29] God knows you're going to be tested that
[1:35:30] day you might not know it now you might
[1:35:32] know if it's a doctor's appointment or
[1:35:33] you might know if it's a certain thing
[1:35:34] you might know a certain date you know
[1:35:37] but sometimes you don't know the day
[1:35:39] so if you don't know the day you have to
[1:35:41] train for that day
[1:35:45] but a man said to my opinion
[1:35:47] you need to know how Satan works on you
[1:35:51] right
[1:35:54] train for the contest
[1:35:57] and know him know what his strength is
[1:36:00] huh so what is he good at tempting you
[1:36:03] with
[1:36:04] amen right
[1:36:06] and then train for this contest when you
[1:36:09] do meet him
[1:36:11] for it's one thing sure you're going to
[1:36:14] meet him so you train for the contest
[1:36:16] I didn't have time to do a researcher
[1:36:18] but on Saturday when I was driving I was
[1:36:20] playing and listening to some training I
[1:36:21] was listening to Mike Tyson's training
[1:36:23] regime when he was a champion
[1:36:25] and some of these other boxers like how
[1:36:27] do they train
[1:36:29] how did Floyd how did Floyd Mayweather
[1:36:31] train
[1:36:33] well he said he would sleep in till like
[1:36:34] 2 30 P.M
[1:36:37] and he would train he would eat and
[1:36:39] train I'm sorry train Eat Sleep Train
[1:36:41] Eat Sleep Train eat sleep for months and
[1:36:44] months and months and never and never
[1:36:46] ever have a bite of sugar it was all
[1:36:48] healthy food all the time it was always
[1:36:50] rice and chicken and greens everyone
[1:36:53] because he wanted to win and he was
[1:36:55] undefeated
[1:36:56] ah
[1:36:57] Jesus is undefeated praise God
[1:36:59] hallelujah and if we want victories we
[1:37:02] got to train the way our trainer says to
[1:37:04] train praise God
[1:37:06] Hallelujah
[1:37:09] in other words we know there's a battle
[1:37:11] coming up so what are we doing to get
[1:37:14] ready for it
[1:37:16] how many want to be Mighty when that
[1:37:17] battle comes
[1:37:20] I know some of the tug of wars are going
[1:37:21] to be long church but some of them don't
[1:37:22] have to be as long if we'd be more
[1:37:24] faithful amen
[1:37:26] please and the church said amen
[1:37:29] amen sometimes we let them go too long
[1:37:31] because we're using our own strength
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:34] amen right
[1:37:35] but if we use his strength it's a
[1:37:38] supernatural power Hallelujah he's more
[1:37:41] than able praise God he pulls the Rope
[1:37:44] for us hallelujah
[1:37:45] in us he's with us even in us as we pull
[1:37:48] the Rope even to the end of the world
[1:37:50] praise God
[1:37:53] one thing's for sure you are going to
[1:37:54] have a tug of war with Satan
[1:37:57] one thing is for sure so know your enemy
[1:38:01] when he come to Jesus when he was fasted
[1:38:04] but Austin's tried to fast right I try
[1:38:06] to fast sometimes I try to fast that's
[1:38:07] when I get attacked with
[1:38:08] headaches
[1:38:10] right or Temptations like where'd this
[1:38:13] come from I'm fasting
[1:38:15] that's the same thing that happened to
[1:38:16] Jesus
[1:38:17] that's you know he was fasting for 40
[1:38:18] days I've never done that
[1:38:21] but we should know our enemy
[1:38:23] when does he come to us some of us it's
[1:38:25] on Saturday night
[1:38:27] sovis is on Sunday morning
[1:38:30] the church said amen amen hallelujah
[1:38:33] someone says always that attack at a
[1:38:35] certain time or a certain place or when
[1:38:37] we're around a certain person
[1:38:40] and we almost know it's going to happen
[1:38:43] so we got to prepare for the contest
[1:38:46] what are we doing to prepare for the
[1:38:49] contest
[1:38:50] that's the question
[1:38:53] he said training for a contest is just
[1:38:55] like a boxer
[1:38:57] his enemy that he's going to meet out
[1:38:58] there in the contest to fight a real
[1:39:00] good fighter usually knows and studies
[1:39:02] his opponent
[1:39:04] he studies his licks know where he
[1:39:06] fights for I'm sorry nowhere he fights
[1:39:08] for whether he leans forward
[1:39:11] whether he hangs back like the old days
[1:39:13] fights right-handed or he fights
[1:39:15] left-handed
[1:39:16] he studies all this
[1:39:19] and then if he's a good smart fighter he
[1:39:21] gets him aspiring partner that'll fight
[1:39:22] just like his opponent fights for he'll
[1:39:24] know all of his licks when he gets to
[1:39:26] that place
[1:39:28] and so see George that's why we read the
[1:39:30] Bible we read how Satan fought this
[1:39:32] partner there
[1:39:33] oh he did that oh
[1:39:35] he surrounded oh he put Moses them at
[1:39:39] the Red Sea he surrounded them they felt
[1:39:40] there was no way out oh he's gonna he
[1:39:42] may try to put me in a situation where I
[1:39:44] feel like there's no way out
[1:39:48] or oh with with Noah he made him wait
[1:39:51] 120 years he may he may make me wait a
[1:39:54] long time I gotta know how he's gonna
[1:39:56] fight me I got to be willing to wait
[1:39:58] longer I got to be willing to build a
[1:40:01] house of safety for my family praise God
[1:40:03] I got to be willing to make ready I know
[1:40:05] the judgment is coming but I can have a
[1:40:07] place of safety praise God
[1:40:09] Hallelujah
[1:40:11] I know he's going to make me play the
[1:40:12] waiting game
[1:40:15] I've been praying and crying since
[1:40:16] probably second grade for my dad to get
[1:40:18] saved and have a real experience
[1:40:21] I was eight years old one of my 40 41
[1:40:23] now almost 32 or 33 years and church I'm
[1:40:26] not giving up this is the waiting game
[1:40:29] I know my enemy he'll try to discourage
[1:40:31] me
[1:40:32] he'll try to make me doubt but I but I
[1:40:35] studied the enemy I know his tactics
[1:40:36] amen hallelujah so when he comes I gotta
[1:40:40] grab on the rope and say no devil I'm
[1:40:42] not going to be discouraged I'm going to
[1:40:43] be encouraged I'm not going to give up
[1:40:45] I'm going to keep believing praise God
[1:40:48] amen you you won't pull me into doubt or
[1:40:51] unbelief I'm going to keep believing
[1:40:52] God's word
[1:40:54] Hallelujah
[1:40:56] now put your your put your loved one in
[1:40:58] there right
[1:41:00] I was I was I was listening on that
[1:41:02] Mayweather and he would spar
[1:41:05] he would Spar for like an hour straight
[1:41:07] no that's unheard of this guy was in top
[1:41:09] top tip top shape he that and the the
[1:41:12] sparring partners could only last 15
[1:41:14] minutes now I could probably last 10
[1:41:16] seconds in that ring
[1:41:17] maybe five
[1:41:19] but he was in such good shape he would
[1:41:21] just do 15 minutes with that guy he
[1:41:22] knocked this guy and then bringing the
[1:41:24] next guy
[1:41:26] he would just be back for a whole hour
[1:41:28] to get ready for this one battle
[1:41:31] at church that's what we need to be we
[1:41:32] need to be constantly feeding on the
[1:41:34] word of God
[1:41:35] we're going to be constantly getting
[1:41:36] ready because we know he's coming we got
[1:41:38] to build up our strength praise God Amen
[1:41:42] we got to build it up because we know
[1:41:44] the tug of war is coming
[1:41:47] and we don't want to get to the tug of
[1:41:48] war and Satan pulls us into the fire we
[1:41:50] get burnt by sin
[1:41:52] Our Testimony goes can I say that our
[1:41:54] testimony Goes Up in Flames because they
[1:41:56] like because we've seen them come right
[1:41:58] in here and their testimonies go open
[1:41:59] flames
[1:42:00] why because it's a battle it's a tug of
[1:42:03] war Battle
[1:42:04] but thank God we're still standing in
[1:42:06] church thank God we're not in the fire
[1:42:07] thank God you still got a hold of the
[1:42:09] Rope thank God you still can train today

[1:42:12] contest thank God that he's given you
[1:42:14] strength to pull on the road praise God

[1:42:26] getting started amen hallelujah that
[1:42:29] ought to be all of our attitudes
[1:42:31] I'm just getting started tugging that
[1:42:33] rope praise God
[1:42:35] I'm just getting started with my boxing
[1:42:37] career
[1:42:38] boxing the devil
[1:42:40] I just got started praise God
[1:42:43] now I better keep that good attitude or
[1:42:44] else I'm gonna get whipped because I'm
[1:42:45] gonna be overconfident I better keep
[1:42:47] training
[1:42:48] better get on my knees and train and get
[1:42:50] all that strength I need for the Rope
[1:42:53] because I'm going to be pulling praise
[1:42:54] God
[1:42:56] she got to know how Satan's gonna battle
[1:42:57] you but Amanda said you always come to
[1:42:59] me when I was tired and worn out
[1:43:01] so at the end of the day
[1:43:03] how many how many go through battles at
[1:43:04] the end of the day
[1:43:06] there's some days I just want to quit
[1:43:07] and go to bed
[1:43:08] I say this day I've had enough this day
[1:43:10] I want a new day I want new mercies
[1:43:12] tomorrow
[1:43:13] because I feel like all my mercies I ran
[1:43:15] out for today
[1:43:16] and God said I'm gonna give you some new
[1:43:17] ones tomorrow
[1:43:19] Lord I need some new ones
[1:43:21] see because I wasn't strong that day as
[1:43:22] I should have been
[1:43:23] all right maybe I didn't do enough
[1:43:25] training that day
[1:43:26] oh my goodness thank you Jesus for your
[1:43:29] mercy I love this I love what brothers
[1:43:32] and I think that's a very good thing for
[1:43:34] Christian do that's right
[1:43:35] now if you want to start training
[1:43:37] he says start with John 3 16 the Golden
[1:43:40] Rule
[1:43:41] start right out and then he says with
[1:43:43] that you'll get on the floor with John 3
[1:43:45] 16. I wonder what John 3 16 a little jab
[1:43:48] Church
[1:43:50] you know jab you got how many know John
[1:43:52] 3 16. you can really knock the devil for
[1:43:54] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:43:56] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:43:58] believed in him shall not perish but
[1:44:00] have everlasting life that's a pretty
[1:44:02] good point church amen
[1:44:04] that's a pretty good muscle can I say
[1:44:06] like that
[1:44:07] John 3 16 is a good place to start but

[1:45:20] oh thank God he's giving us different
[1:45:22] punches praise God
[1:45:25] then you train for The Knockout punches

[1:45:35] everybody know that
[1:45:37] amen oh you sisters need knockout
[1:45:39] punches
[1:45:40] I've never seen any of your sisters
[1:45:42] swing but I mean I imagine you're pretty
[1:45:44] strong
[1:45:45] holding those babies all the time like
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:47] they got bigger muscles than me
[1:45:49] it's a good thing they do too
[1:45:51] knock out punches
[1:45:54] everybody knows that you need a knockout
[1:45:56] punch with the devil I didn't know that
[1:45:58] did you know that
[1:45:59] yeah we know that you've got to have
[1:46:01] some punch to knock the devil out of
[1:46:04] your life
[1:46:05] out of your mind some scripture that you
[1:46:09] can use and it will remove the devil
[1:46:11] amen

[1:46:14] Amen
[1:46:16] you have to train to hit your enemy
[1:46:19] and always God uses his word we must
[1:46:22] remember that God uses his word to
[1:46:24] defeat the enemy if God could think or
[1:46:26] give his people anything better defeat
[1:46:28] the enemy with he would have done it so
[1:46:29] as I've always said when God makes a
[1:46:31] decision that's the best there is he
[1:46:33] never has to alter decisions so the
[1:46:35] first decision God gave his people in
[1:46:37] the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy
[1:46:39] was his word they were fortified with
[1:46:41] his word
[1:46:43] now look at this Brotherhood said you're
[1:46:45] going to need to train for knockout
[1:46:47] punches

[1:47:09] tongues or Screaming or dancing he just
[1:47:11] said get behind me Satan I'll go through
[1:47:14] this battle I'll go through this trial
[1:47:16] and what do you do he pulled Satan right
