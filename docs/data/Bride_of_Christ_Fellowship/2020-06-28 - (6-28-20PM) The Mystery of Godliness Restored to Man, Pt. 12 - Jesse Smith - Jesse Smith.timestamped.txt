[35:56] [Music]
[36:32] [Music]
[36:44] so get godliness tonight so let's go to
[36:46] second Peter 1 verse 6
[37:05] for the Jose I don't know if you heard
[37:07] this morning's message but if you have
[37:09] any mission or your desires let me know
[37:11] sometime you know pray about it like if
[37:12] you want to send message books somewhere
[37:15] or copies of any book just pray about it
[37:31] go to Nicaragua
[37:37] keep it on your heart hopefully by God's
[37:39] grace we'll get through this
[37:42] okay thank you I appreciate you sharing
[37:45] that
[37:48] God is perfect you know his timing is
[37:50] perfect he's never been late the rapture
[37:52] will be late praise God and there won't
[37:55] be one empty seat at the marriage supper
[37:56] of the Lamb amen he said make sure my
[37:59] house is full and it will be pulled by
[38:01] God's grace thank you
[38:04] so just it's nice to see that there's
[38:06] support there and
[38:08] you know brother BAM said the world is
[38:10] not won by money right but then there
[38:13] are times where people need support and
[38:15] you know Jesus had women following him
[38:18] just giving him money food and
[38:21] susana was one of them Mary Magdalene
[38:24] was one of them and it's not won by
[38:26] money but money is Avenue God uses
[38:29] so we're thankful and God will work
[38:31] everything out in his time and season as
[38:33] we said on Wednesday we just need more
[38:35] patience for his content so let's go to
[38:38] 2nd Peter 1 verse 6 the mystery of
[38:43] godliness
[38:44] restored to man
[38:47] let's just read in verse 6 then we'll be
[38:49] seated here verse 6 let's read it
[38:51] together on three one two three and to
[38:54] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[38:56] patience and to patience godliness may
[39:00] God as blessings three was work you may
[39:03] be seated I
[39:07] appreciate the feedback this week had
[39:09] numerous people tell me how much they
[39:10] enjoyed the temperance sermons helping
[39:14] people with their diet and just taking
[39:16] care of their body I appreciate that it
[39:18] really helped me I mean this week I
[39:20] think I'm letting one ice cream treat
[39:21] this this is what I think it was on
[39:23] Thursday night but I turned it down I
[39:25] mean I honesty jerks I'll just under
[39:27] such an anointing I didn't even bother
[39:29] me you know some sweets and even
[39:31] temptations that go out to eat you know
[39:33] places that probably shouldn't eat I
[39:34] really felt the anointing of God and I
[39:38] fixed my breakfast with you know
[39:40] hard-boiled eggs and getting though no
[39:42] healthy fats and things like that so I
[39:45] felt good and I appreciate the feedback
[39:46] for those people that it helped it's an
[39:49] anointing when you have the anointing of
[39:51] God on you you can curb the sensual
[39:54] passions of the flesh
[39:56] right that's what it's for you can
[39:59] switch over there I just have one little
[40:00] picture I want to show as we look at
[40:02] godliness now tonight then Wednesday we
[40:04] looked at patients that was a wonderful
[40:06] time in the Lord
[40:08] just an encouragement you know to know
[40:10] that just because you have one moment of
[40:12] impatience that doesn't mean God gets
[40:14] rid of you like Abraham he was the Bible
[40:17] said the Bible just recorded his good
[40:19] things in Romans right he was strong in
[40:22] faith giving God glory patient for 25
[40:25] years and so
[40:27] yeah now tonight as we look to godliness
[40:32] it's a dual it's a dual meaning there's
[40:36] in other words there's two kinds of
[40:37] godliness just like there's two kinds of
[40:39] faith faith is a is your first anointing
[40:42] but then there's the fruit of faith and
[40:44] we saw that a few weeks ago so godliness
[40:46] is the same it's a step here but then
[40:49] there's a state of godliness which is
[40:52] another word just to say fruitful or
[40:55] state of fruitfulness a state of
[40:57] Christian maturity
[40:59] but this this evening we'll look at Lord
[41:01] willing
[41:03] you know this this this at this
[41:06] anointing you you receive before you're
[41:08] born again
[41:10] so let me get to my other notes here I
[41:12] just wanna make sure I mentioned this
[41:15] from this morning from this morning's
[41:17] message just a reminder that we always
[41:19] want to have one mind
[41:20] God will continue to bless us as we
[41:23] focus on one thing the gospel so every
[41:26] day when we go to work remember it's
[41:28] about the gospel every day in our whole
[41:30] we got to remember it all about the
[41:31] gospel and as we meditate upon the Word
[41:34] of God
[41:35] God will further the gospel in our lives
[41:38] and I'm thankful for that by God's grace
[41:42] so I just want to make sure we emphasize
[41:44] that and our words will always tell
[41:46] what's on our mind right because out of
[41:49] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[41:51] speaks yeah so we have to mate and
[41:53] that's one that's the one thing we have
[41:55] control over the words that come out of
[41:57] our mouth the condition of our mind and
[41:59] our thinking in our affections that's
[42:01] one thing we can always
[42:03] always control by the grace of the Lord
[42:07] the freemore agency so I want to look at
[42:10] godliness tonight and then I want to
[42:11] share a little bit about my experiences
[42:13] with cultural integration you know as
[42:15] we're seeing a lot of the racial
[42:16] problems it's a very small group of
[42:19] course in America but with all the riots
[42:22] and everything a lot of people are a lot
[42:25] of people just don't have the love of
[42:27] Jesus if they just had the love of Jesus
[42:30] they wouldn't feel hatred toward any
[42:32] group any racial group but it's all
[42:35] about the love of Jesus
[42:37] well I just start with that I think I'll
[42:39] just start with that then we'll get the
[42:40] Gallinas this I don't forget let me set
[42:44] my time or two
[42:45] you know I'm sharing this from my
[42:48] perspective everybody has a different
[42:49] perspective so here's my perspective I
[42:52] grew up and as you can tell uh sister
[42:54] Brenda want a nice tan she had there
[42:56] but you know I get a little tan myself
[42:58] you know and I have numerous pictures
[43:00] from my childhood you know for my
[43:02] summertime I would get really really
[43:03] dark really dark like darker than Jose
[43:07] right now I've you really dark I can get
[43:09] really dark
[43:10] you get a much darker brother
[43:14] okay
[43:16] we just can't see it right
[43:25] so coming from my perspective you know I
[43:29] was raised in a very white community you
[43:32] know all the three communities I was
[43:33] raised and we're very high in just
[43:36] Caucasian you know I'm sure it's
[43:38] probably the opposite you know to like
[43:40] Ghana where most people were black right
[43:42] in Ghana you know brother Graham there
[43:45] was times he was hunting in Africa and
[43:47] he tells it on date black people would
[43:50] see him and they would scream because he
[43:52] was the first white person they ever saw
[43:54] there's numerous testimonies
[43:57] and so that that's the natural reaction
[43:59] right to humans when we see someone
[44:02] different than us and uh you know I'll
[44:05] be honest you know growing up we didn't
[44:07] have hardly any black people in our
[44:09] communities and so the first time we
[44:11] would see them I would be nervous
[44:12] because I was just all we saw was white
[44:15] people white people white people
[44:17] that's just common right
[44:20] and as we saw like in brother branham's
[44:23] life you know even with him visiting
[44:25] Africa and so I think really the first
[44:30] time I had a real relationship with a
[44:32] black person was the the coach who
[44:35] recruited me to play football he's a big
[44:38] tall man he's probably six foot two his
[44:39] name's Paul winters he was a running
[44:42] back for Akron and he came to my house
[44:45] you know he visited me he came to him
[44:46] with numerous football games and I I had
[44:48] and and then came to my track meets and
[44:51] my mom just fell in love with him like
[44:53] he was just a nice guy and you know he
[44:57] treated us so well and and so when I
[45:00] signed with Acker my mom was really
[45:01] happy and uh and she said she told Paul
[45:04] she said take care of Jessie you know
[45:06] she drops me off and leaves me and he's
[45:08] the only person I knew in Akron when she
[45:11] dropped me off in the fall of 1999
[45:14] but when I came to college most of the
[45:16] football players were black and it was a
[45:19] whole new thing for me
[45:22] and I had to learn just you know I was
[45:25] just a nervous person I was already a
[45:27] nervous person and so being around you
[45:31] know different races and then there was
[45:33] you know Indians on the team
[45:35] there was I think I might have been the
[45:37] only Spanish looking one but going back
[45:40] to my childhood I got so dark that a
[45:43] couple of my friends would call me the
[45:45] n-word they would call me and I would go
[45:47] home cry because I got so dark and so I
[45:52] kind of felt like a minority that was
[45:55] half I was half white and you know half
[45:57] Spanish or Mexican what everyone's say
[45:58] we're still not sure in our and our
[46:01] family situation I mean I have my DNA
[46:04] test showed you know I got some Spanish
[46:06] then I got some you know Mexico yeah
[46:09] Mexican he's you know family that came
[46:12] from Mexico
[46:13] but IRA meant so I some of my early
[46:16] memories in fact this might be funny but
[46:17] my dad called me he said you're my only
[46:20] black son my dad would joke all the time
[46:23] because I could get really really dark
[46:26] and so growing up like I remember just
[46:30] being teased because they people thought
[46:32] I was black
[46:33] because I could get so dark in the
[46:35] summertime and so I could I could relate
[46:37] to you know I can relate to people
[46:40] teasing you because your skin color
[46:42] because I experienced it as I would have
[46:45] been 2nd or 3rd or 4th grade
[46:48] just calling me names like that and then
[46:51] as I got older people call me the S word
[46:53] for a Mexican it's SP I see I got called
[46:57] that silent so all throughout my life
[46:59] I've been kind of teased and
[47:00] discriminated against and so
[47:03] I always had a heart for people I felt
[47:05] bad when people got mistreated because I
[47:07] knew what that was like I was just
[47:09] different from most of the white kids in
[47:12] our in our community but once I got to
[47:15] college it was I was the minority again
[47:17] because most the team was black and I
[47:20] didn't have any trouble with that I was
[47:21] just a nervous at first
[47:23] and so you know uh as but I loved
[47:28] everybody anyway like I just I love
[47:30] people I never had a hard time loving
[47:33] anybody it was just knowing like knowing
[47:35] the boundaries like I don't want to
[47:37] disrespect anybody I don't want to make
[47:39] any jokes about anybody any class of
[47:42] people
[47:44] and so I had to learn I just had I just
[47:46] always kept quiet until I felt like I
[47:49] knew a people's background so I didn't
[47:52] say anything bad against them right and
[47:54] I just I'd better to not say anything
[47:56] then say anything at all right
[48:00] but if you know you're really I didn't
[48:03] really have a whole lot of close friends
[48:04] on the football team a few but not
[48:07] really and so my really my closest
[48:10] friend became brother bro
[48:11] he became my real first close black
[48:14] friend you know and
[48:16] so much and it's interesting the first
[48:19] when we come in the message the first
[48:21] person that we we consider our pastor
[48:23] was a black man because once I became a
[48:26] Christian I you know even before I never
[48:29] had any trouble with it and so the Holy
[48:32] Spirit you know working on a person's
[48:34] heart will take any of those feelings
[48:35] away as far as like your your any
[48:39] any pride that would exalt well I'm
[48:41] better than this person if you're a
[48:44] sinner if you're honest sinner you know
[48:46] we're all sinners say we need to be
[48:48] saved by grace we all fall short of the
[48:50] glory of God so that was my kind of
[48:53] integration
[48:55] we just with other cultures because I
[48:57] grew up in a really white culture and
[49:01] then but where I was the minority I was
[49:04] the one people would make fun of and I
[49:06] go to college of the minority there at
[49:10] least on the football team and then even
[49:12] in my college classes I was I was the
[49:14] only guy in the in the classes because I
[49:17] was a teacher with little kids and so it
[49:21] was always women only and me
[49:24] and so I was a minority there too
[49:28] by the nineties I love kids yeah I still
[49:31] do this yeah they I love my job I'm glad
[49:33] I get to do Bible clubs and you know
[49:34] cheer about Jesus I just love kids and I
[49:37] love education like I was telling van
[49:38] you know I love having the whole summer
[49:39] off bulb innings out right now yes I
[49:42] it's a blessing to have the summers off
[49:44] and there's just so many benefits to
[49:45] being a school teacher I mean at one
[49:48] time I know this brother Brooks told me
[49:49] I was his best friend he ever had in his
[49:51] whole life here's a man that grew up in
[49:54] an african-american community right in
[49:56] the south and
[49:59] through the blood of Jesus Christ his
[50:02] best friends become a mixture I'm a
[50:04] half-breed I guess that's a like that in
[50:06] other words his best friendship came
[50:08] from a man who was half white and half
[50:10] Spanish or half Mexican I thought that
[50:13] was just such a good it was just a good
[50:15] example of the Holy Spirit of how God
[50:18] doesn't look at skin color
[50:20] you know God looks at the blood of Jesus
[50:23] Christ amen and he wants to say every
[50:25] skin color that's my brother man calls
[50:26] it revelation seven he said will it be
[50:29] that bouquet bride he called it I love
[50:31] that I love that phrase God has a
[50:33] bouquet of all the different colors and
[50:35] they're all beautiful and that's his
[50:36] bouquet bride
[50:39] so
[50:40] and even today you
[50:44] know I don't witness a lot of
[50:46] discrimination I don't and even in a
[50:49] school I think Copley has like I think
[50:53] it's only 5% minority group you know so
[50:55] again it's mostly white but I love our
[50:59] black kids just like our white kids I
[51:01] mean they're all kids to me they're all
[51:02] wonderful beautiful kids and so I'm just
[51:07] letting you know you know that's where
[51:08] where I come from and so I was never
[51:12] exposed to racism you know I was never
[51:14] of my parents never looked down upon
[51:15] anybody and never said any evil things I
[51:19] just know that we got teased you know we
[51:21] were the ones that got teased if anybody
[51:22] got teased it was our family
[51:25] so I have a lot of heart my heart goes
[51:28] out you know to the the black men who've
[51:31] been killed by the police officers my
[51:32] heart goes out to them and racism is
[51:35] always wrong it's always wrong and so I
[51:39] pray I hope you pray I hope you pray for
[51:42] reform to be made in the police system
[51:45] but God knows we need police officers
[51:48] praise God we certainly need them every
[51:52] time that there's been an emergency who
[51:54] do you call the cops and so I just want
[51:58] to just share those few words that's
[51:59] about all I want to say
[52:01] just let you know that I have a burden
[52:03] for people that get mistreated because I
[52:04] was mistreated I was never beat up I was
[52:06] never hurt or punched but I was laughed
[52:09] at made fun of I was the I was the one
[52:11] people were joking about I was the
[52:14] different one growing up all
[52:16] right like I said I loved all the guys
[52:18] on the team I love my coaches and
[52:21] and then today I love all of all the
[52:24] races and I love how Wendy says we
[52:25] always have like a multi-national Church
[52:27] here such a small church but almost
[52:29] every part of the the world is
[52:31] represented here
[52:33] I love it God has just he's great you
[52:36] know he's he's great and and I'll say
[52:39] this if I ever offended anybody with
[52:40] anything I ever said about race forgive
[52:43] me because I never would ever want to do
[52:44] that it's like I said I know what it's
[52:46] like to go home crying
[52:48] numerous times my parents asked me why
[52:50] you crying I said look that the boys
[52:52] called me this n-word you know I didn't
[52:53] even know what did that you know I just
[52:55] I just knew it was wrong
[52:58] so that's why you know I'm thankful that
[53:01] we have a multi-national Church here
[53:05] it just it's glorious and I thank the
[53:08] Lord for all the all the people but
[53:10] again our prayers should be God you know
[53:12] changed some laws but change hearts
[53:14] that's the biggest thing change hearts
[53:17] that that hearts will come to know Jesus
[53:20] Christ cuz when you know Jesus Christ
[53:21] you don't have any any evil feelings
[53:24] toward anybody you know you're no better
[53:26] than anybody else and everybody deserves
[53:28] God's grace
[53:30] alright so um sorry about that let's
[53:34] go to that
[53:37] okay
[53:39] so if you have any questions about you
[53:41] know the current events or anything like
[53:42] that you know you can feel free to ask
[53:44] me about them I'll give you my thoughts
[53:46] on them
[53:47] so I make sure I get everything okay
[53:51] alright so so get a godliness for a few
[53:53] minutes here tonight now to accept
[53:55] godliness Church you have to reject
[53:56] ereference
[53:58] FDJ reject ear evidence and it's
[54:01] specifically targeted towards sinners
[54:04] because remember on the statue perfect
[54:06] man godliness is being like God and
[54:10] that's specifically to sinners because
[54:13] brotherly kindness is kind of
[54:14] specifically to your church family
[54:17] the last thing God gives you before you
[54:19] gives you the Holy Ghost is kindness to
[54:21] your church family praise God that's why
[54:24] a lot of people that you know divide
[54:26] churches or split churches it shows they
[54:27] never had this they never had brotherly
[54:29] kindness if they're so selfish that they
[54:32] only are kind to themselves they only
[54:34] care about themselves it shows they
[54:35] never had this to begin with because you
[54:37] can't have that and be born again so you
[54:40] know yeah I'm sorry you have to have
[54:41] that to be born again you can't have
[54:43] that and divide God's family all right
[54:45] so a leanest is a it's a
[54:49] it's a I call it here in the book the
[54:52] devotion needed to be like God on God's
[54:55] Way or the reverence or devotion in
[54:57] other word for reverence so it's the
[55:00] reverence
[55:02] needed to be just like God
[55:04] on God's Way
[55:07] ok so again there's two types of
[55:11] godliness this is what I believe from
[55:13] Scripture is a godliness here and then
[55:15] there's a godliness where Paul says
[55:18] godliness with contentment is great gain
[55:20] now look the Bible calls it great now
[55:23] this they say this this godliness can't
[55:26] be greater than the charity baptism of
[55:28] the Holy Ghost
[55:29] if the batch atole ghost you know was
[55:32] was hidden for 2,000 years and it's the
[55:34] greatest thing that could the greatest
[55:36] gift you could receive well then how can
[55:38] this be greater than that it can't be so
[55:41] godly this has to be a higher mature
[55:45] form of Christianity it's on the same
[55:48] level of just being fruitful being
[55:50] faithful it's the highest level of
[55:52] Christianity I just put some more words
[55:54] like Paul said I'd kept the faith now
[55:56] there's another way to use faith other
[55:58] than just the first anointing I fought a
[56:01] good fight so it's a it's a victor who's
[56:04] won the battle praise God who's one
[56:06] who's overcome the enemy after years and
[56:09] years of battles praise God
[56:11] so in other words this is this is a
[56:14] higher form of godliness it means it's
[56:17] completely loyal and obedient
[56:19] now not sinlessness but it's a mature
[56:22] level of daily loyalty and obedience to
[56:26] the commands of God
[56:28] the church this only happens you and I
[56:32] will do our best we will please God our
[56:34] best all the after we suffer a lot
[56:38] you're only going to get here by
[56:41] suffering as we saw this morning Paul
[56:44] said I want you to believe God but you
[56:46] also have to suffer for God
[56:48] that was his prayer
[56:52] Jesus the Bible said you all know but
[56:54] Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet he
[56:58] learned obedience by the things which he
[57:00] suffered
[57:02] so we can expect this we can expect
[57:06] suffering in our lives some degree and
[57:09] it's different for everybody now that'd
[57:11] be interesting to see in the next few
[57:13] weeks as we listen to your testimonies
[57:14] what was your greatest suffering in your
[57:17] life it'd be interesting to see what God
[57:19] brought you through because I'm sure to
[57:21] be a little different like we looked at
[57:23] brother Branham member his greatest
[57:25] suffering was being left all alone out
[57:26] in Arizona with no preachers inviting
[57:29] him I just feeling all alone out there
[57:31] but see God had told him to walk with me
[57:34] you'll walk alone and thank God amen
[57:38] so he said that was his greatest
[57:40] suffering was out in the desert of
[57:42] Arizona
[57:46] so see Church you you and I we'll get
[57:49] there we'll get to this state of
[57:51] godliness and will please God the best
[57:54] will be our best form of a Christian
[57:57] after we suffer but we've got to go
[58:00] through the sufferings and that's how
[58:04] you get there Jesus became more obedient
[58:07] more and more beating never sinned but
[58:09] he became orbited as he suffered the
[58:12] Bible says he had to learn how to obey
[58:14] God
[58:22] praise God he said I do always those
[58:26] things that please him all the
[58:29] sufferings allowed him to please God
[58:32] more and more as time went on praise God
[58:38] it's a lot of maturity how many want to
[58:40] grow a maturity praise God it's the only
[58:42] way we're going to do it is through
[58:43] suffering
[58:47] now I want to move to this thought here
[58:50] notice how it's the sixth one I think
[58:53] I've mentioned this before one two three
[58:55] four five six so five grace we need
[58:57] grace and patience six is godliness and
[59:01] this is significant because in Genesis
[59:03] one man is made on the sixth day and he
[59:08] was created sinless so Adam was made on
[59:11] the sixth day and he was immediately
[59:13] like God
[59:15] that's why the anointing of the Holy
[59:17] Spirit that's why six is a good number
[59:19] because it's the anointing of the Holy
[59:21] Spirit on a man or woman to be godly
[59:26] and so what was Adam doing once he was
[59:28] on earth he had dominion
[59:30] he had control
[59:33] as he could church that's what God once
[59:35] in our life he wants us to have control
[59:37] over the enemy
[59:39] right that's that's the part of
[59:43] godliness that is ours we've got to
[59:45] start taking control notice this is you
[59:47] you you you you you you you you you you
[59:49] and now with patience you start have to
[59:51] be patient with others right temperance
[59:54] is where it's you you you you've got to
[59:55] control yourself but now with patience
[59:58] now I got to be patient with brother
[59:59] Jesse
[1:00:00] now I got to be godly to my neighbors so
[1:00:04] it starts with you building up you
[1:00:06] focusing on you you you you you right
[1:00:09] and then it builds out to other people
[1:00:13] and
[1:00:15] so with godliness now it's you being
[1:00:18] anointed to start taking dominion over
[1:00:20] yourself over your own life in other
[1:00:22] words right you have to start taking
[1:00:25] dominion because remember we're trying
[1:00:27] to go back to what Adam US Adam was a
[1:00:29] son of God who was anoint of the Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit he didn't sin he had dominion he
[1:00:35] had control he had the he had the choice
[1:00:37] praise God
[1:00:38] he had the authority from God as a
[1:00:41] lowercase God on the earth right amen
[1:00:47] and so see that is that is our example
[1:00:50] that six is the example of godliness
[1:00:53] that we need to apply to our life today
[1:00:56] it's God's desire for you and I to take
[1:00:58] dominion over our lives
[1:01:01] that's what godliness is you start
[1:01:03] taking dominion over your life and how
[1:01:07] you treat others
[1:01:08] Romans 5:17 says you reign in life by
[1:01:12] one Jesus Christ
[1:01:15] see you rain not yeah we don't want to
[1:01:18] rain in the next slide but geez just
[1:01:20] wants to see people rain right now in
[1:01:22] this life amen
[1:01:23] he wants to see people with Dominion in
[1:01:26] this life and how you doing got a star
[1:01:28] that flashing you gotta gotta got to be
[1:01:31] temperate you can't let this guy reign
[1:01:34] and tell you what to do and this this
[1:01:37] flesh determine how your weeks gonna go
[1:01:39] can I say like that as most weeks you
[1:01:41] don't lay around and you're suffering
[1:01:43] and sick all week right
[1:01:44] your body's usually healthy you normally
[1:01:47] healthy you don't got to determine you
[1:01:49] got to determine by the holy spirit that
[1:01:51] you're gonna bring this into subjection
[1:01:54] and you're gonna have a good week
[1:01:55] serving the Lord Amen
[1:01:58] Alleluia
[1:02:00] you have to reign over it praise God
[1:02:04] so what do you reign over demonic powers
[1:02:08] and temptations Paul says we wrestle
[1:02:11] against principalities powers the rulers
[1:02:14] of the darkness of this world against
[1:02:17] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:02:20] amen what do we roll over the demons
[1:02:23] that live around us the demons that
[1:02:26] hover over Northeast Ohio
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:31] we have to rule over those things that's
[1:02:34] our calling in life to reign in life by
[1:02:37] Jesus Christ
[1:02:39] your enemies are these unseen dena
[1:02:42] makaan sorry oh yeah denominational but
[1:02:45] also demonic influences and you defeat
[1:02:48] them through the whole armor of God as
[1:02:49] you cast down the imaginations as we saw
[1:02:52] on Wednesday night again we looked at
[1:02:53] that bringing it into obedience to the
[1:02:57] Word of God I know this is familiar just
[1:03:00] but let's let's think about our week did
[1:03:03] we rain this week do we reign over the
[1:03:05] flesh or to the flesh reign over us
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:09] I'll say like this you determined it
[1:03:12] yeah whether you got the victory or you
[1:03:15] got you were defeated it was your choice
[1:03:18] see because God gives us that free more
[1:03:20] agency and if we can get just that start
[1:03:23] with that anointing and build it up and
[1:03:26] continuing to keep that anointing on you
[1:03:28] and if you're patient then he'll give it
[1:03:31] he gives us anointing of godliness
[1:03:33] of being just like God wrote Amos says
[1:03:36] it's just like God
[1:03:37] it's a devotion or reverence is being
[1:03:40] reverent at all times
[1:03:42] praise God
[1:03:45] remember Church those demons will flee
[1:03:47] if you just quote God's Word through
[1:03:50] your lips and refuse him and turn down
[1:03:53] his temptation he has to flee eventually
[1:03:56] how many can be a witness of that you've
[1:03:59] been tempted tend attendant for this is
[1:04:01] you continually say no no no pretty soon
[1:04:03] you don't feel it anymore
[1:04:05] Ray's gonna that's right same thing with
[1:04:09] the Lord Jesus keep refusing to keep
[1:04:11] refusing it and then you will begin to
[1:04:14] subdue demonic powers and reign over sin
[1:04:17] the flesh the world and Satan
[1:04:22] early appraised God
[1:04:26] thank the Lord
[1:04:30] reigning in life so this deals with
[1:04:33] Dominion as we get into godliness now
[1:04:35] you start God starts giving you a little
[1:04:37] bit of independence but we have said the
[1:04:39] bride is an independent woman
[1:04:41] independent from Satan a man she's
[1:04:45] depend upon God but she's independent
[1:04:47] from the demonic powers of darkness
[1:04:50] praise God
[1:04:54] that's right church
[1:04:56] so reigning over sin the flesh the world
[1:05:01] Satan I've had so many people over the
[1:05:05] years come into my classroom and they
[1:05:06] say I just did usually the recess
[1:05:08] monitors which is funny because they go
[1:05:12] from one room to the next and the kids
[1:05:13] are like
[1:05:16] and they come to my class and they're a
[1:05:19] little more a little more under control
[1:05:20] it's just this year a numerous recess
[1:05:23] martyrs come in and they tell me they
[1:05:25] said there's something special about
[1:05:26] your class and I always say this is
[1:05:28] Jesus I said it's all about Jesus yeah
[1:05:32] yeah see cos you're a creator right you
[1:05:35] have dominion over the over your life
[1:05:37] right and that's what I do I try to by
[1:05:40] God's grace pray and just create the
[1:05:42] atmosphere
[1:05:44] your creator and that
[1:05:47] they don't visit I like coming in your
[1:05:49] room or and the other women are there
[1:05:52] Christians they go to church you know
[1:05:55] but see it's a it's it's you and I
[1:05:59] taking God's Word
[1:06:01] refusing so I've got to refuse anger
[1:06:04] I've got to refuse temptations to be
[1:06:08] bitter against teachers and anyone else
[1:06:10] who might hurt my feelings children yeah
[1:06:13] they spit on me over the years they
[1:06:15] kicked me they yelled at me they've
[1:06:17] called me a bad teacher but I know I'm a
[1:06:20] good one by God's grace by God's grace
[1:06:23] so you know we have to turn down any
[1:06:26] temptation if to refuse those and rule
[1:06:30] over it we gotta create a good
[1:06:32] atmosphere praise God
[1:06:34] I've had even the you know some of the
[1:06:36] leaders in our districts who
[1:06:37] superintendents and assistant
[1:06:39] superintendents email me over the years
[1:06:40] and say thank you for being a leader as
[1:06:42] a teacher
[1:06:45] you know one one year I had a super
[1:06:48] assistant superintendent come in and he
[1:06:49] just watched my room for 30 minutes and
[1:06:51] he's like he said you were doing a
[1:06:53] fantastic job he said you need to we
[1:06:57] wish all the teachers in the district
[1:06:58] were like you or something like
[1:07:00] something along those lines and I just
[1:07:02] said it was God's grace but it's
[1:07:04] creating that atmosphere
[1:07:06] you and I have the power to create the
[1:07:10] atmosphere
[1:07:11] so let's do it praise God right if
[1:07:14] you're a creator let's create pretty
[1:07:16] Scotty today let's create it have
[1:07:19] dominion cuz you're taught to read over
[1:07:22] it praise God
[1:07:24] now looking like this I look at like God
[1:07:27] is like a father right he'll slowly give
[1:07:29] you
[1:07:30] ownership over something like I used to
[1:07:34] let my children mow the grass but I
[1:07:36] would
[1:07:37] they're really busy now in learning so I
[1:07:39] just mowed the grass but the first few
[1:07:40] times I'd kind of watch them and give
[1:07:42] them a little more independence
[1:07:45] I'm sure my wife she probably sees it
[1:07:47] most with cooking right she teaches the
[1:07:49] little younger ones to cook and then
[1:07:50] pretty soon now in case you can do
[1:07:52] breakfast all by yourself you know she's
[1:07:54] real good with the knife they're never
[1:07:56] cut herself by God's grace it's just
[1:07:58] that same idea I believe with the same
[1:08:00] thing is with God as we stay faithful to
[1:08:03] God God just you give us all the
[1:08:07] direction at the beginning but then he
[1:08:08] slowly gives us so he steps away so that
[1:08:11] we can make decisions by what he's
[1:08:14] already taught us
[1:08:15] it has to be that way right it's
[1:08:17] adoption it has to be that way praise
[1:08:21] God
[1:08:22] and like brother Brandon even got to
[1:08:24] that spot where remember the Lord told
[1:08:26] him he said do I have to push you
[1:08:28] through a pipe every time
[1:08:32] does God have to push us through a pipe
[1:08:34] every time to do something right it
[1:08:36] shouldn't be that way
[1:08:38] he says what about your victory I
[1:08:41] thought the angel urgent what about your
[1:08:43] faith
[1:08:45] see not that not that you make a
[1:08:49] decision without is leading but you
[1:08:50] would pray and ask for his leading and
[1:08:52] then when the time comes where you have
[1:08:54] to make a decision you make the best
[1:08:56] decision you can based upon the Word of
[1:08:58] God not according to this flesh what
[1:09:00] this guy was with the desires of God
[1:09:05] that's what I I can see by God's grace I
[1:09:08] see it all the time preaching I don't
[1:09:10] feel that every time to preach a sermon
[1:09:12] like I don't in fact any brother amens
[1:09:15] come up to me as so many times he's a
[1:09:16] great servant I'm like before hand I was
[1:09:18] like I don't know Lorna I just don't
[1:09:20] know see it but what's the Holy Spirit
[1:09:23] gets in here for he's God and people
[1:09:26] start calling it the Word of God gets
[1:09:28] delivered to those that are hungry for
[1:09:30] praise God and you just learn to trust
[1:09:34] God you just learn well this is my
[1:09:35] channel this is my position Here I am
[1:09:37] I'm at my post of duty I'm waiting on
[1:09:39] the Lord and the Lord comes when we hire
[1:09:41] them to come praise God that's right
[1:09:45] so see Church this is God giving us the
[1:09:49] dominion over our lives the number six
[1:09:54] you get anointed you take Dominion
[1:09:57] praise God you rule over it
[1:09:59] do I have to move you every time you
[1:10:02] move is what the angel told brother
[1:10:03] branham do I need to move you every time
[1:10:06] before you do something
[1:10:09] I don't want to know what the Lord have
[1:10:11] to say that right in other words we want
[1:10:13] to know what God wants to be done
[1:10:15] progessive the bride will know what he
[1:10:18] wants done with the word amen
[1:10:20] she'll know what the word says praise
[1:10:23] God like beggin I were talking there
[1:10:26] with the missionary he said Jesus said
[1:10:27] go into all the world and preach the
[1:10:29] gospel to every creature praise God
[1:10:31] there's some sort that's the general
[1:10:34] Commission so we just asked the Lord God
[1:10:37] guide us with this opportunity that we
[1:10:40] have to reach those who need to hear it
[1:10:43] we know fewer and fewer people are going
[1:10:45] to receive it we know that but it
[1:10:46] doesn't it doesn't take away our
[1:10:48] responsibility to give them a chance to
[1:10:50] hear it
[1:11:00] so this is six this is a
[1:11:03] godliness anointing of being just like
[1:11:06] God in reverent just like God
[1:11:10] now brother Branham in the stature of a
[1:11:13] man he goes to Matthew five go to
[1:11:15] Matthew 5:43
[1:11:17] brother Branham specifically says you're
[1:11:20] godly like God says so in other words
[1:11:24] you treat sinners like God does and this
[1:11:28] is this is the main thought with
[1:11:30] godliness that I've even found through
[1:11:31] scripture
[1:11:35] Matthew 5:43 you have heard that have
[1:11:38] been said thou shalt love thy neighbour
[1:11:40] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[1:11:42] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:11:45] you
[1:11:46] do good to them that hate you and pray
[1:11:49] for them which despitefully use you and
[1:11:52] persecute you that ye may be the
[1:11:55] children of your father which is in
[1:11:58] heaven
[1:12:00] that's how you do it very very simple
[1:12:03] how can I believe sing about a chat via
[1:12:05] a child of God this morning when that
[1:12:06] beautiful son I'm a child of it then we
[1:12:08] see that song I'm a child of God yes I
[1:12:10] am how do you know you're a child of God
[1:12:11] because you love your enemies you bless
[1:12:14] them that curse you do good to them that
[1:12:15] hate you and pray for them which
[1:12:17] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:12:19] that's how you know your childhood God
[1:12:21] that's why sure I don't get
[1:12:23] if I said god bless you two people and
[1:12:26] they don't even look you know they don't
[1:12:27] even look like they deserve God and
[1:12:29] blessing I don't care because I know I'm
[1:12:31] supposed to bless those people that are
[1:12:32] my enemies I
[1:12:34] don't worry about that now if they
[1:12:37] blasting the Holy Ghost I'd have to pray
[1:12:38] about that right you know we have to
[1:12:39] pray about that we don't want to do that
[1:12:41] if they're beyond but only God knows
[1:12:43] that they're beyond this is the point of
[1:12:45] return
[1:12:45] right
[1:12:48] only God knows love your enemies bless
[1:12:51] them that curse you you're good to them
[1:12:53] that hate you then you'll be the
[1:12:55] children of your father this is mature
[1:12:58] stuff here this isn't like I'm just
[1:13:00] trying to get victory over my cigarette
[1:13:01] addiction that's this is beyond that
[1:13:04] that's your own battle I just got to get
[1:13:06] victory over this no you gotta you gotta
[1:13:09] love the person that hates you
[1:13:12] you're gonna say good things about the
[1:13:14] person that cursed you
[1:13:18] this is deeper right it's deeper than
[1:13:22] just getting victory over that
[1:13:24] bottle of alcohols much it's much
[1:13:27] greater it's a greater anointing praise
[1:13:29] God
[1:13:31] to desire good to desire God's blessings
[1:13:34] upon them that do evil
[1:13:38] let me just say like this for even
[1:13:40] though even that cop that shot the guy
[1:13:43] administer the minister not shot well
[1:13:45] yeah I was Atlanta but they I mean think
[1:13:47] about that as much as we despise those
[1:13:49] actions by those cops that did evil if
[1:13:54] we take that love them bless them do
[1:13:57] good to them pray for them we pray for
[1:13:59] them pray he's done I mean we would
[1:14:03] think that would be an enemy of the
[1:14:04] world right
[1:14:06] think about the Jews that crucify Jesus
[1:14:10] Jesus had divine love praise God he said
[1:14:13] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:14:14] they're doing
[1:14:17] this is godliness
[1:14:20] so see godliness T is all about how you
[1:14:23] treat sinners and unbelievers or enemies
[1:14:28] cuz your enemies can be even Christians
[1:14:30] right but they can be of the synagogue
[1:14:31] of Satan
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:35] so this is what God requires to be
[1:14:38] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:14:42] heaven is perfect
[1:14:43] love to bless do good pray for your
[1:14:46] enemies praise God
[1:14:51] for you maketh his Sun to rise on the
[1:14:53] evil we're back to Matthew 5 and
[1:14:57] on the good and sendeth rain on the just
[1:15:00] and the unjust for if you love them
[1:15:01] which love you what reward have ye
[1:15:06] not goodness do not even the publicans
[1:15:08] the same and if he salute your brethren
[1:15:11] only what do ye more than others do not
[1:15:14] even the publicans so be therefore
[1:15:17] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:15:20] heaven is perfect so Jesus calls
[1:15:23] perfection or completion
[1:15:25] when you love those who don't love you
[1:15:28] you return good for those people that do
[1:15:31] you evil
[1:15:33] praise God and this is a greater
[1:15:37] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:39] how many need that anointing
[1:15:42] yeah absolutely we all need it remember
[1:15:46] like Bob and me you know you lied to the
[1:15:48] IRS different things you know you'll
[1:15:49] fall short in little areas but then God
[1:15:51] asked you repent God or bring that
[1:15:53] strength right back he'll bring it right
[1:15:55] back so
[1:15:57] see when you garner with godliness you
[1:16:00] start becoming like God and you hope
[1:16:02] everybody gets saved you know everybody
[1:16:05] won't but you're hoping they do
[1:16:08] Peter says God is not willing that any
[1:16:11] should perish
[1:16:15] Paul says he God wishes all men to be
[1:16:18] saved in the scripture I
[1:16:21] loved Ezekiel 33 11 it says as I live
[1:16:25] saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the
[1:16:27] death of the wicked but that the wicked
[1:16:29] turn from his way and live terney
[1:16:32] turning from her evil ways for why will
[1:16:35] you die o house of Israel look at that
[1:16:37] father's heart he said why don't you
[1:16:40] turn turn I don't have pleasure in the
[1:16:43] wicked perish for
[1:16:45] I want to see the wicked turn to God
[1:16:53] no I was sharing with brother bang as
[1:16:56] well
[1:16:58] you know one of the brothers I think in
[1:17:00] Minnesota if I'm not mistaken he's a
[1:17:01] pastor he does a huge prison ministry
[1:17:04] and they get led they send message books
[1:17:06] they just send it in there every year I
[1:17:08] think last year they sent a thousand or
[1:17:10] maybe more and they get letters all the
[1:17:12] time of sinners that are in prison that
[1:17:14] gets saved in prison now they're they're
[1:17:18] in there for life
[1:17:20] but if they have faith in God's Word
[1:17:23] they're saved
[1:17:24] praise God and
[1:17:27] God and this this to me this shows the
[1:17:30] heart of God
[1:17:32] you see people and people that did they
[1:17:35] deserve a chance at the gospel no they
[1:17:37] probably murdered somebody's probably
[1:17:39] stole they robbed a bank they raped
[1:17:40] somebody they did too awful evil wicked
[1:17:42] things but yet there's still hearts of
[1:17:45] godly people that want to give them a
[1:17:47] chance to repent and go to heaven
[1:17:51] these people don't deserve it we would
[1:17:54] think but God doesn't delight in the
[1:17:57] death of the wicked
[1:17:58] according to the scripture I
[1:18:02] want to read
[1:18:04] go to Roman's 9 1 let's read this here
[1:18:08] because this is important
[1:18:26] verse one I say the truth in Christ I
[1:18:29] lie not my conscience also bearing
[1:18:32] bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] then I have a great heaviness and
[1:18:36] continual sorrow in my heart
[1:18:40] why why did he have sorrow why did a
[1:18:42] Holy Ghost filled Saint like Paul a
[1:18:44] missionary have sorrow because verse 3
[1:18:46] for I could wish that myself were
[1:18:49] accursed from Christ for my brethren my
[1:18:52] kinsmen according to the flesh who are
[1:18:56] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[1:18:57] adoption the glory and the covenants and
[1:18:59] the giving of the law and the service of
[1:19:01] God and the promises whose are the
[1:19:04] fathers and of whom as concerning the
[1:19:07] flesh Christ overcame who is over all
[1:19:10] God blessed forever amen
[1:19:14] so see how many believe Paul had
[1:19:16] godliness
[1:19:17] he was so much like God that he said he
[1:19:21] wishes I wish I could be cursed I wish I
[1:19:24] could see me destroyed so that Israel
[1:19:27] might be saved
[1:19:28] what godliness that is just like Jesus
[1:19:32] he took the curse that we might be
[1:19:34] saying amen
[1:19:37] of course we would never want to be
[1:19:39] cursed we never want to be sin sinners
[1:19:41] but we so badly want to see people
[1:19:43] accept God's grace and and walk in the
[1:19:46] truth that we would ourselves feel like
[1:19:48] we'd be willing to be a curse so that
[1:19:50] other people could be blessed
[1:19:52] this is real godliness this is like the
[1:19:55] heart of God
[1:19:57] God doesn't enjoy when the sinners dying
[1:20:05] heaviness and sorrow and heart
[1:20:10] now listen Church I think do you
[1:20:12] understand how many times you drive down
[1:20:15] the road and have sorrow and heaviness
[1:20:17] of heart for them the beggar you know
[1:20:20] he's a drug addict right
[1:20:22] we talked about that daily that's our
[1:20:25] that's on the heart
[1:20:27] our neighbors you know they might be
[1:20:29] evil people how often do we have
[1:20:30] heaviness and hardness just this this
[1:20:33] this burden heart for the beggar
[1:20:37] how about for the nomination
[1:20:42] they worship Mary and know they you have
[1:20:45] their prayer beads and they they
[1:20:48] continue to live in sin we should have a
[1:20:51] we should have a heaviness of heart for
[1:20:53] people shouldn't we
[1:20:54] know let me be totally honest I always
[1:20:57] feel it no well when I really start down
[1:21:00] getting down to thinking about that
[1:21:01] don't you feel that church don't you
[1:21:03] feel that let these people are lost and
[1:21:07] it's something I can do is there
[1:21:10] anything I can do see godliness makes
[1:21:13] you feel for them
[1:21:17] now Paul
[1:21:20] that looked under this is interesting
[1:21:22] Paul had a burn for them but Jesus told
[1:21:26] him don't go to them he said go to the
[1:21:27] Gentiles
[1:21:29] and that's in that striking yeah this
[1:21:32] burden it a burden for this this this
[1:21:35] say like this this racial group of
[1:21:37] people alright this certain race had a
[1:21:39] verb to this race but yet he wasn't
[1:21:41] called to go to them
[1:21:44] somebody else had to go to him Peter
[1:21:47] right more saints like that James James
[1:21:51] and Peter
[1:21:52] pillars in the church
[1:21:58] my goodness
[1:22:00] Steven remember when he was stoned he
[1:22:02] asked Jesus lay not this sin to their
[1:22:05] charge
[1:22:06] when Jews stoned him to death
[1:22:08] he said Lord lay it not to their charge
[1:22:11] don't let it be on their account that's
[1:22:14] real godliness right there that is true
[1:22:17] godliness and then Jesus uttered to all
[1:22:20] of his mockers Father forgive them for
[1:22:22] they know not what they do
[1:22:26] not goodness
[1:22:29] true godliness go to Ezekiel 9 verse 1
[1:22:32] let's go back over this here with sigh
[1:22:33] and cry for the abominations
[1:22:39] remember Church because of the iniquity
[1:22:41] abounding the love of many shall wax
[1:22:42] cold what that means is we're not gonna
[1:22:45] see many people with godliness that
[1:22:46] really love people today it's gonna be
[1:22:49] hard it's gonna be rare
[1:22:51] very rare to find people that have this
[1:22:54] heart like Paul
[1:22:56] that they care so much about the loss
[1:22:59] that they'll do something about it I
[1:23:05] think the last time I really felt like
[1:23:07] that was when we had Victoria I was
[1:23:09] telling her they Amen about that so when
[1:23:11] we had Victoria I was so burned I just
[1:23:13] want to see my family so I uh I took a
[1:23:16] well how they say like this I
[1:23:21] came here to the church and I mailed out
[1:23:24] about 40 church age books and I mailed
[1:23:27] uh
[1:23:28] tracts to everybody on my mom's side I
[1:23:31] think I just used my ties to do it you
[1:23:34] know just
[1:23:35] to give them a chance and I didn't hear
[1:23:38] back from one of them other than one of
[1:23:40] them said oh they're really nicely and
[1:23:41] professionally done
[1:23:42] now you know I'll be honest I was hurt I
[1:23:45] was expecting more
[1:23:47] but all's I could do all's I can do is
[1:23:50] act upon the burden in my heart
[1:23:53] what moved me to send it to my family
[1:23:56] members some of them in married three
[1:23:58] times sometime were married three times
[1:24:01] what what I saw I realized that's not
[1:24:04] the normal Jessie that doesn't care
[1:24:06] right that's not the that's not the
[1:24:08] flesh man that's the soul man praise God
[1:24:10] that's the godliness part of me which I
[1:24:13] know I've got a portion of it praise God
[1:24:15] but that was the godliness part of me
[1:24:17] when to come out where God is good even
[1:24:20] those that may not deserve it
[1:24:25] and so recently I can see that in my
[1:24:28] life that was you know what 44 years ago
[1:24:30] because Victoria's now for
[1:24:34] reaching out to people that have heard
[1:24:38] it but are not living it heard it but
[1:24:40] not living it xico 9 verse 1 he cried
[1:24:44] also my ears with a loud voice saying
[1:24:46] cause them that have charged over the
[1:24:47] city to draw near even every man with
[1:24:49] his destroying weapon in his hand this
[1:24:52] is
[1:24:52] see
[1:24:53] 594 it's about 600 years before Christ
[1:24:57] this would be fulfilled
[1:25:00] almost 700 years later at Titus
[1:25:03] AD 70 and behold six men came from the
[1:25:09] way of the higher gate which lied toward
[1:25:11] the north and every man a slaughtering
[1:25:13] weapon his hand and one man among them
[1:25:15] was clothed with linen with a writer's
[1:25:17] inkhorn by a side and they went in and
[1:25:19] stood beside the brazen altar and the
[1:25:22] glory of the Lord of Israel was gone up
[1:25:24] from the cherub whereupon he was to the
[1:25:26] threshold of the house and he called to
[1:25:28] the man clothed with linen which had the
[1:25:30] riders in corn by his side and the Lord
[1:25:33] said unto him go through the midst of
[1:25:35] the city go through the midst of
[1:25:36] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:25:38] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[1:25:40] for all the abominations that be done in
[1:25:44] the midst thereof
[1:25:46] so only the men and women that were
[1:25:49] sighing and crying that hated the sin
[1:25:52] only they got marked by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:57] verse 5 and to the others he said in my
[1:25:59] hearing go ye after him through the city
[1:26:01] and smite let not your eyes spare
[1:26:03] neither have ye pity verse 6 lay under
[1:26:07] the other other Lee old and young both
[1:26:10] maids and little children and women but
[1:26:12] come not near any man upon whom is the
[1:26:15] mark and begin at my sanctuary
[1:26:17] then they began at the ancient men which
[1:26:20] were before the house and he sent unto
[1:26:23] them to file the house and build the
[1:26:25] courts with the slain go ye forth and
[1:26:27] they went forth and slew in the city and
[1:26:29] it came to pass while they were slaying
[1:26:31] them and I was left that I fell upon my
[1:26:34] face and cried and said O Lord God wilt
[1:26:37] thou destroy all the residue of Israel
[1:26:39] in thy pouring out of the fury upon
[1:26:42] Jerusalem
[1:26:43] so this made Ezekiel cry
[1:26:48] seeing God just save a few faithful
[1:26:52] prayer warriors and then everybody else
[1:26:54] was going to suffer judgment this made
[1:26:57] the Prophet cry
[1:27:01] verse 10 and as for me
[1:27:04] I'm sorry go to verse 9 then he said the
[1:27:06] iniquity of the house of Israel and
[1:27:08] Judah is great now remember iniquity is
[1:27:11] purposeful sinning it is transgressing
[1:27:15] with knowledge of the transgression
[1:27:18] in other words you know it's wrong you
[1:27:21] still do it so God lets Ezekiel know
[1:27:23] these people knew better
[1:27:26] he said the iniquity house of Israel is
[1:27:29] exceeding great so they've been they in
[1:27:31] other words they'd heard it time and
[1:27:33] time and time they've heard it over and
[1:27:36] over and over but still
[1:27:38] the sins that it didn't cause him to
[1:27:41] change and they didn't cry about it and
[1:27:43] pray about it anymore
[1:27:46] these are people that did not pray about
[1:27:49] the awful sins that were being done in
[1:27:52] the city
[1:27:53] in other words these were people the
[1:27:55] people that got slain they were ones
[1:27:56] that were not like God because God can't
[1:27:58] look at sin and not feel sad about it
[1:28:01] praise God
[1:28:04] mercy Jesus
[1:28:07] it's such a strange agent I think it
[1:28:10] just lay out to see if you know there's
[1:28:12] no persecution on us there's so many
[1:28:14] financial things we could do and you
[1:28:17] know it's just such a strange age
[1:28:19] but we have to be burdened about the sin
[1:28:22] in the city we have to have a burden
[1:28:24] about our families that are living in
[1:28:26] sin
[1:28:31] he said it's exceeding great the
[1:28:33] iniquity is exceeding great they knew it
[1:28:36] over and over again is so great and
[1:28:39] the land is full of blood and the city
[1:28:42] full of perverseness for they say the
[1:28:44] Lord had forsaken the earth and the Lord
[1:28:46] seeth not they say Oh God left the earth
[1:28:48] there's no God God doesn't care what I'm
[1:28:50] doing God doesn't see what I'm doing
[1:28:52] but they're workers of iniquity
[1:28:55] they knew better but they said Oh God's
[1:28:58] out here God oh I don't feel the
[1:29:00] anointing anymore there's no more Holy
[1:29:01] Spirit and yet there was the whole time
[1:29:03] it was right in the church praying for
[1:29:05] the sinners amen that's where they know
[1:29:07] anything was amen it was right there in
[1:29:10] the church building of Sian crying
[1:29:12] against the abominations of the city
[1:29:17] verse 10 and he asked for me also mine I
[1:29:19] shall not neither will I have pity but I
[1:29:22] will recompense their way upon their
[1:29:24] head and behold the man clothed with
[1:29:26] linen which had the ink corn by side
[1:29:27] reported the matter saying I've done as
[1:29:29] thou hast commanded me this was
[1:29:33] fulfilled in 70 AD some people believe
[1:29:36] it was fulfilled in Zedekiah's day but I
[1:29:38] think I think it more applies to the New
[1:29:41] Testament with Jesus
[1:29:44] warning them he warned them he said when
[1:29:47] you see the armies he said compass about
[1:29:50] Israel he said run into the hills right
[1:29:52] he said don't go back to your house and
[1:29:53] try to get you just run to the hills
[1:29:57] he said don't spare any because if they
[1:30:01] really had godliness they would have
[1:30:03] been in church praise God if they really
[1:30:06] had a desire to serve God they would
[1:30:10] have been the house of God sad about the
[1:30:12] sins going on the city
[1:30:14] right
[1:30:17] God told his ego there's no excuse these
[1:30:20] people are exceedingly full of iniquity
[1:30:23] they've heard it time and time again
[1:30:25] they failed to repent
[1:30:29] so see Church when you have godliness
[1:30:33] it will separate you from fellowship
[1:30:36] with sinners
[1:30:39] because you despised their choices it
[1:30:42] burdens you and
[1:30:44] it also makes you weep inside in your
[1:30:47] private prayers and your church prayers
[1:30:51] because you're so burdened and concerned
[1:30:54] about other people's destinies that
[1:30:56] you're crying and pleading with God to
[1:30:58] show mercy on the disobedient and on the
[1:31:00] unholy
[1:31:03] that's why I'm gonna song was very
[1:31:05] fitting Hosanna that's very fitting
[1:31:06] break my heart for what breaks God's
[1:31:09] heart
[1:31:11] let me have a broken heart about it
[1:31:15] now you remember the story I
[1:31:18] need to find the message you haven't
[1:31:20] found it yet but
[1:31:21] one of the brothers walked up to brother
[1:31:23] Branham and one time it said he said if
[1:31:26] the coming of the Lord is so near why
[1:31:28] you out there hunting and he was
[1:31:30] rebuking brother Branham
[1:31:32] you know brother Graham said he said I'd
[1:31:35] go out there because if I didn't I would
[1:31:37] go crazy worrying about all the needs of
[1:31:39] the of the world remember he'd been to
[1:31:42] India the poorest nation
[1:31:44] he said he cried and wept and he gave
[1:31:47] every single thing and still they're
[1:31:48] running up and he told the brothers that
[1:31:52] I've got to go up there I also go crazy
[1:31:54] worrying about all the problems all the
[1:31:56] sinners out there isn't that the MOT
[1:31:59] same for you
[1:32:02] I'll be honest I battle condemnation all
[1:32:04] the time for their bank if I don't
[1:32:05] witness to the grocery store lady I feeI
[1:32:08] bad a condemnation like God help me
[1:32:11] Jesus you know I don't give my book away
[1:32:13] to somebody I feel bad like oh god I
[1:32:15] want to see them say God have mercy on
[1:32:17] me
[1:32:21] but if I have that all the time I'll go
[1:32:24] crazy I'll let the enemy condemn me for
[1:32:27] not doing enough right
[1:32:30] yeah I sit here and preach service after
[1:32:33] service and and get thousands I think
[1:32:37] we're at 960 thousand views on our
[1:32:40] YouTube channel that's just my channel
[1:32:41] then we have the church channel people
[1:32:43] are hearing it
[1:32:45] but see we would up we want to make sure
[1:32:49] we have the burden right we don't want
[1:32:50] to lose the burden but we can't go crazy
[1:32:53] either and be all condemned all the time
[1:32:57] so that's why I love it so where's your
[1:33:00] answer come in the house of God and
[1:33:01] praying for them praise God because
[1:33:03] that's what fits the scripture
[1:33:06] they sighed and cried for the
[1:33:09] abominations I can't force people to
[1:33:12] come but God may God hear my prayers
[1:33:14] that some might come
[1:33:18] praise God praise God
[1:33:23] now what do you think about let me get
[1:33:25] off on another tangent here what do you
[1:33:27] think about all the message people that
[1:33:28] use quotes about this to say this was
[1:33:31] Kovan 19 now anything about that
[1:33:35] remember there was message people
[1:33:37] showing to you they were using quotes or
[1:33:39] program uses and said
[1:33:41] they were twisting the quotes to make it
[1:33:45] say that everybody's going to die from
[1:33:46] Kovan unless you got the baptism the
[1:33:48] Holy Ghost come on here we are what
[1:33:51] march/april made you three months later
[1:33:56] amen
[1:33:58] see and uh it's instantly as soon as I
[1:34:02] saw them I knew those quotes are
[1:34:04] mistaken they've they've taken those
[1:34:05] quotes out of context
[1:34:08] now here we are three months later
[1:34:11] and we believe good Saints like brother
[1:34:14] Andy sighs who had covet 19 he's a real
[1:34:17] man of God we believe
[1:34:21] and so CY we just gotta we have to be
[1:34:24] able to we have to rightly divide the
[1:34:26] word of God
[1:34:28] prove all things hold
[1:34:30] fast that which is good try every spirit
[1:34:33] whether it be of God see that was the
[1:34:35] spirit of fear trying to get people to
[1:34:37] be fearful fearful fearful the the
[1:34:40] purpose of the scripture is to pray for
[1:34:43] sinners praise not to be sobered with
[1:34:46] sin that it drives you to more prayer
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:50] that's the purpose of the scripture not
[1:34:52] to scare people
[1:34:53] but to get people to pray and intercede
[1:34:55] and
[1:34:57] be a king and priest unto God amen
[1:35:02] this isn't my notes we go to Luke
[1:35:07] Bemis Luke 16 yeah
[1:35:13] no it's not Luke 16 it's Luke 18 Luke
[1:35:17] 18:1
[1:35:26] sorry Oh
[1:35:29] Genevieve took some real good pictures
[1:35:31] there oh it's going on Facebook tonight
[1:35:36] you know they steal my phone and then I
[1:35:39] don't know what they're taking pictures
[1:35:41] the funniest one there when they do
[1:35:42] themselves you know Genovese tried to do
[1:35:44] a selfie and it just gets that like the
[1:35:46] top of her head like that those are my
[1:35:48] favorite
[1:35:51] Luke 18:1 and he spoke a pair of unto
[1:35:54] them to this end so what's the purpose
[1:35:56] of this that men ought always to pray
[1:36:00] and not to faint
[1:36:05] saying there was an acidic judge which
[1:36:08] feared not God neither regarded man and
[1:36:10] there was a widow in that city and she
[1:36:11] came unto him saying avenge me of my
[1:36:13] adversary and he would not for a while
[1:36:16] but afterward he said within himself
[1:36:18] though I fear not God nor regard man yet
[1:36:21] because this Widow trouble with me I
[1:36:22] will avenge her less by her continual
[1:36:24] coming she where me and the Lord said
[1:36:26] hear what the unjust judge saith and
[1:36:30] shall not God avenge his own elect which
[1:36:34] cry day and night unto him though he
[1:36:37] bear long with them
[1:36:39] now be honest errs I don't cry every day
[1:36:41] I might look like it because I cry
[1:36:44] almost every Sunday but I don't cry
[1:36:46] every single day but Jesus when he's
[1:36:49] describing that he said they're often
[1:36:52] crying
[1:36:52] so I think the Lord for that
[1:36:55] cry day and night unto them though he
[1:36:58] bear long with them I tell you that he
[1:37:01] will avenge them speedily
[1:37:04] thank the Lord praise God
[1:37:06] doesn't seem speedily to us right but
[1:37:09] it's speedily to God
[1:37:10] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[1:37:13] shall he find faith on the earth so this
[1:37:15] connects fake with endtime prayer life
[1:37:20] right or your prayer life is connected
[1:37:24] to faith at the end time
[1:37:26] so those people that keep knocking the
[1:37:29] key pray they're still burned about
[1:37:31] abortion I'm gonna keep the hammer on
[1:37:33] that one they're still burned about
[1:37:35] murders and and unjust
[1:37:38] acts of violence there's still concern
[1:37:40] discern still saying God have mercy God
[1:37:42] have a grace upon these sinners the
[1:37:46] people that stay burning about it are
[1:37:48] the ones that have genuine faith
[1:37:51] jesus said sir he uses the same words
[1:37:54] cry day and night sign cry day and night
[1:37:58] and this was the end of this parable is
[1:38:02] so we'll always pray and not to faint
[1:38:05] I
[1:38:10] keep mention this but Keysha how many
[1:38:12] letters you think you sent to ad and
[1:38:13] Emily
[1:38:15] take a guess
[1:38:17] in four years how many think he's maybe
[1:38:20] a couple a year
[1:38:24] for a while you did get for the one and
[1:38:27] then it was then it got further and
[1:38:30] further in between
[1:38:33] so I was mentioning my cousin Adam on
[1:38:37] Wednesday with patience how I had to be
[1:38:41] honest I just didn't think he was gonna
[1:38:43] be saved he was so addicted to drugs I
[1:38:45] thought in my own human thinking I don't
[1:38:49] even see how it can be saved but God is
[1:38:52] my witness we prayed this altar numerous
[1:38:54] times and I wept for his soul and when I
[1:38:58] had given up God was still working
[1:39:00] praise God
[1:39:05] God was using that little heart of love
[1:39:08] over there acacia
[1:39:09] you know I saw him and his wife they
[1:39:12] came to my Sunday service my preaching
[1:39:14] appointment and she said I
[1:39:18] was talking to I just said Joey I said I
[1:39:21] really appreciate your faith just stay
[1:39:23] with that and let him come back and she
[1:39:25] said she said yeah she said it's all God
[1:39:28] because he had abandoned them for drugs
[1:39:30] he'd abandoned the two kids and the
[1:39:32] family and she said she has many friends
[1:39:34] like saying to her how can forgive him
[1:39:36] after all he's done in his time with the
[1:39:38] drug dealers all these things she said
[1:39:40] it was just the grace of God and she
[1:39:41] starts to cry and
[1:39:43] enters that you just did something for
[1:39:45] me because I remember praying for him
[1:39:47] where he's God I
[1:39:48] remember crying for the abominations
[1:39:51] that word km and simon everybody was
[1:39:54] invest in these prayers
[1:39:58] hi we know brother Randy Burton
[1:40:01] yeah some of us know right now he's a
[1:40:04] preacher in Texas
[1:40:08] well way before he got married
[1:40:11] his wife was out in the world I went out
[1:40:14] to preach for brother Brooks when they
[1:40:17] first started the church it must have
[1:40:18] been
[1:40:19] 2008 2007 long time ago I didn't have
[1:40:24] well this gray hair I got now when I
[1:40:26] preached on the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:30] Randy's mother-in-law came up to the
[1:40:34] altar it's in the hotel room is a little
[1:40:36] bit bigger than this one
[1:40:38] and she said my daughter's gone astray
[1:40:42] can you pray for her and
[1:40:46] she started weeping and I think we sat
[1:40:50] down on the the hotel chairs and we just
[1:40:52] prayed and
[1:40:54] by the Holy Spirit I said God has heard
[1:40:57] your prayer I can't imagine he's saying
[1:40:59] that
[1:40:59] basically like prophecy I said God has
[1:41:03] heard your prayer I said because you're
[1:41:04] sighing and crying
[1:41:06] glory praise God I would say that every
[1:41:10] time I cried but I did that time
[1:41:14] and I remember weeping and crying with
[1:41:16] her it must have been about maybe five
[1:41:19] years later I came back to the church
[1:41:21] and there she was sitting there her
[1:41:24] daughter got saved had come out of the
[1:41:26] world we're looking all holy and then a
[1:41:28] couple years after that she got married
[1:41:29] to brother Randy by God's grace
[1:41:32] praise God
[1:41:34] hallelujah
[1:41:36] and anyone when ice went back and
[1:41:39] preached you know I agreed her mom and
[1:41:40] said look what God did God heard your
[1:41:42] sighing and crying for the abominations
[1:41:45] see for most people spiritual things
[1:41:48] don't get real enough it's like some
[1:41:51] fable we're telling it's not a fable
[1:41:53] it's a reality praise God
[1:41:56] these things are real
[1:41:59] and when we so see that's why people
[1:42:01] don't get emotional enough because it's
[1:42:03] not real enough to them
[1:42:05] but see when it gets real the Bible says
[1:42:08] you'll sigh and cry because you're
[1:42:10] anointed that way praise God amen you're
[1:42:13] anointed by God leanness so you love the
[1:42:16] sinner you love the backside of praise
[1:42:18] God you love them because you have the
[1:42:20] anointing to do it
[1:42:22] hallelujah we're in the house of God
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:26] that's what the scripture says remember
[1:42:29] Peter said judgment begins to the house
[1:42:30] of God
[1:42:37] so I've seen that one Adam Lindsay Adam
[1:42:41] other one
[1:42:44] Beth sister barb that was the other one
[1:42:46] that's about 2009 there's my hour so
[1:42:49] bear with me to me so 5 minute timer
[1:42:52] here
[1:42:53] we were at our other church on mo drive
[1:42:57] the second one on mojo not the first one
[1:42:59] the second one and we had that oh my
[1:43:02] that was quite a sanctuary my goodness I
[1:43:04] can't even believe I run that out now
[1:43:06] thinking about it I
[1:43:09] [Laughter]
[1:43:13] guess I just fit our nature I guess
[1:43:15] you're just
[1:43:17] old-fashioned
[1:43:18] [Laughter]
[1:43:20] bang why'd you let me rent that out
[1:43:24] I'm just kidding buddy we just needed a
[1:43:27] place you know
[1:43:28] anyways we had Jim schumake preach
[1:43:32] brother amen and Beth and Simon I was I
[1:43:35] was their pastor at that time hard to
[1:43:37] believe the man who introduced to me the
[1:43:39] message I was at best
[1:43:41] God has God has got a great sense of
[1:43:43] humor what Jim just preach on sighing
[1:43:46] and crying for the bomber nations and
[1:43:48] there was only two people that came up
[1:43:50] no Beth might've been the only one that
[1:43:51] came up for prayer and she come up and I
[1:43:53] still remember this day we just paid her
[1:43:55] and church I saw the tears drop down on
[1:43:58] her eyes
[1:43:59] down to the floor she was just praying
[1:44:02] she said brother Jim pray for my sister
[1:44:04] barbash you'll get saved and come in the
[1:44:07] message oh
[1:44:09] ha they're just a few years later for
[1:44:11] they event
[1:44:13] she started Beth and Simon started
[1:44:15] witnessing to her she's starting to come
[1:44:17] into church and one of the services I
[1:44:18] preached got delivered from cigarettes
[1:44:20] at that sermon it's on the testimony you
[1:44:23] can look it up it's on Vimeo Vimeo
[1:44:27] and so I've seen at least three cases
[1:44:31] where Saints have sighed and cried for
[1:44:33] the abominations and God has moved on
[1:44:36] the scene and God has saved Souls Church
[1:44:39] and I just saved them but I believe
[1:44:41] filled some of them with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:44] because they're solid they're faithful
[1:44:46] they're right in the Word of God amen
[1:44:49] desiring more and more of the Word of
[1:44:51] God
[1:44:58] now with this anointing Church you have
[1:45:01] the ability to either show mercy or
[1:45:04] pronounced judgment with this anointing
[1:45:07] of godliness
[1:45:09] right because you become like God you
[1:45:12] can either grant mercy to people like
[1:45:14] brother Branham everybody grab mercy on
[1:45:16] the couple making love it was a test was
[1:45:18] he to show mercy or judgment well
[1:45:20] godliness instead of having the heart of
[1:45:22] man he had the heart of God in that
[1:45:25] situation God wanted to show mercy to
[1:45:27] them
[1:45:32] the Bible said be slow to anger
[1:45:35] praise God godliness you'll be slow to
[1:45:38] anger just as God is slow to anger
[1:45:41] Jesus said blessed are the judgmental
[1:45:44] for they shall obtain judgment
[1:45:47] no blessed are the merciful for they
[1:45:51] shall obtain mercy
[1:45:53] mercy God have mercy on their souls God
[1:45:58] have mercy on their bodies
[1:46:03] see this is the anointing of the Holy
[1:46:05] Spirit mercy
[1:46:07] Jesus was harsh and judgmental towards
[1:46:09] certain sinners of course
[1:46:12] but we recognize his mercy and
[1:46:15] forgiveness that's what we love him and
[1:46:17] that's what we admire him for His mercy
[1:46:19] and forgiveness go to second Timothy
[1:46:21] we'll close to this one 2nd Timothy 4 14
[1:46:24] through 18
[1:46:28] here's Paul he's got the anointing of
[1:46:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:46:33] I
[1:46:41] like going over some of these many men
[1:46:43] because I forget some of the testimonies
[1:46:44] that God has done there's no greater
[1:46:46] miracle than a saved soul yeah that's
[1:46:49] right
[1:46:50] you know and imagine having mothers cry
[1:46:53] and sisters cry just wanted to see and
[1:46:55] then God answers all that's that's
[1:46:57] that's real rejoicing right there pays
[1:46:59] God
[1:47:00] cuz you know you can't save anybody
[1:47:02] that's to be in God's what God has to
[1:47:04] give the increased praise god I
[1:47:07] thank the Lord for His grace 2nd Timothy
[1:47:10] 4 14 through 18 now notice just I think
[1:47:13] it's beautiful this was just quickened
[1:47:15] to me by the Holy Spirit in a matter of
[1:47:19] just five little sentence five verses
[1:47:22] Paul switches from judgment on some but
[1:47:26] mercy on others the only way he would
[1:47:29] know how to do this would he be in
