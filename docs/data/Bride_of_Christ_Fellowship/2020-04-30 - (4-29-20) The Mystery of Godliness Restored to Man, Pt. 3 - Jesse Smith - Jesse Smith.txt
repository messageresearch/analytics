[Music] anoint us here as i preach lord knowing each person to hear it that our hearts be transformed lord god drawn closer to you may we not stop on our spiritual journey but may we pick up and follow after the leadership of the holy spirit in jesus christ's name and the church said amen praise god let's take our bibles and stand here we'll do our memory burst so let's start with uh our text though for the the scripture here let's just go to second peter chapter one we like to look at the mystery of godliness restore to man part three second peter chapter one then we'll go to philippians four seven and eight and then lord willing i'll reach out to the next person to see what memory verse they'd like to do i'm not quite sure who was next but uh off to think about that this weekend by god's grace second peter chapter one praise god now we looked at uh last wednesday how peter said add which is supply so god wants to supply us with faith then we saw in romans that it's a measure god wants to give us a measure of each one of these spiritual attributes aren't you glad about it how do you get it by believing the promise it's a gift each one is a gift on this journey to the promised land praise god so let's read that actually i'll read first let's i'll read myself and then lord willing we'll do our memory verse after this i'm going to read verse 4. ii peter 1 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so see each one is a promise faith is a problem if you believe it virtue is a promise if you believe it knowledge and so forth having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence how much human effort is required all all diligence because jesus sold out all and poured out all his love to us so the least we can do is give all of our love to him giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and the virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance of the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the burly kindness charity okay let's go to philippians 4 7 and 8. how many are thankful for god's peace tonight praise god it passes all understanding let's read verses uh seven and eight let's read it together on three one two three and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word may be seated [Music] it's a little bit warm so i'm going to take off my jacket here for god's grace so lord willing uh we'll preach part three tonight by the grace of the lord um i'll just real real quick review here uh we started with godliness and we saw it was loyalty it was reverence respect or loyalty to god it's a great mystery now it's not just a small mystery it's a great mystery you know looking at all the mysteries i would say the small mystery might be how jew and gentiles are one church if you're looking at as far as which one is maybe the easiest to grasp uh definitely that one and maybe the bride isn't as the i'm sorry the church rather as the bride those are pretty uh i'd say they're easier um mysteries to grasp but paul calls this one great mystery and that's why there's so much confusion in the message it's a great mystery uh but it's god manifest in the flesh the life of jesus christ revealed true godliness true loyalty uh true faithfulness and devotion to god and that's what we are invited to partake of by jesus be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect so he made a way through it was through constant addition of more and more of god's anointing there's no shortcuts that's what the foolish virgin wants to do right they want to go find a shortcut well how can i quickly get the oil but it's not done through shortcuts it's through a daily life of sacrifice devotion loyalty uh and all these reverence all these uh diligence all these adjectives that describe a christian's daily walk of taking up his cross daily and following the leadership of the holy spirit just like jesus uh even by the age of 12 it was increasing in wisdom and understanding uh and knowledge of god then we saw the biblical proof we looked at jesus saying how much human effort is required all your strength all your love and that's because uh some human effort is required it takes the will of the human in order to be saved or else everyone will be saved the human has to surrender uh choose to hate the things of the world and love the things of god and we'll get a little bit more to that tonight by the grace of the lord then we saw there was two types of godliness there's one in sanctification before you're born again and then there's uh the maturity level of godliness after you're born again and we saw how peter and paul both taught on this paul was most extensive on this teaching paul said we can inherit all godliness or we can uh yeah we can receive it by god's gift through bringing our body into subjection to the word of god and remember it was so valuable he said uh great gain it's great gain to have the attribute of godliness fruitfulness christian maturity that's the stature of a perfect man the maturity of a perfect man in church that's what's burning on my heart that's what i want to grow into a more mature christian that can follow the leadership of god right in the spur of the moment and so we don't want a form of godliness we saw that was satan's tactic to trick people into a form like the pharisees now attending church and and memorizing things and paying tithes is good they all did that but remember it was the wrong thing they were memorizing the mishnah rather than god's commands and they made the commandments of men more important than the commandments of god now we should memorize god's word and quotes from the gods prophet when they line up with god's holy bible right here the absolute praise god uh and then if we do that then he'll give us the token the holy spirit praise god so we saw that and then now we looked and uh now we went to peter we looked at peter's teaching on godliness as part of sanctification so the first godliness you receive is sanctification all right and this uh this is what peter said he said it's adding he's gonna give us a supply so i love this god is gonna supply you and i with our fuel for the journey right he's going to give us the fuel that we need to make it all the way to the promised land praise god and we saw this of course comes through the preaching of the five full ministry i hope church every time you live stream you feel stronger you ought to because it's god's way to fuel your soul praise god uh so you'll receive the end of your faith a lot of people start start with faith right but then like jesus says it can be snatched off your ground if you don't take that seed and if you don't water it and clear out the ground and rid it of all those weeds it won't produce what it's supposed to but if you if you like i talked with that brother wesley you know after we got done off the phone you know he lives in texas i think he sent me a text the other day just saying i'm so strengthened and encouraged just by talking to you i thought praise the lord see virtue has to be able to flow out of us praise god we don't have virtue for a hungry soul we don't have nothing except maybe faith that might be all we have we should have virtue so that people come in contact with us and they can uh receive some blessing from god some strength from god and that's what we hope to do tonight as we preach god's word that you'll receive god's portion god's supply of his spirit for you tonight his word praise god through the five bowl ministry now we ended with that now starting tonight each of these character qualities that we read from peter faith virtue knowledge temperance patience goddess brother kindness and charity is a character quality god wants to give us and each one church and children is a spiritual crossroad you come to the intersection uh of faith right that's when you got saved each one is a spiritual crossroad or we can like it until like the uh each one is a stop when the pillar of fire is leading us on right just like the pillar of fire led israel out of egypt we have to follow the holy spirit to the first crossroad right theirs was the red sea baptism praise god that's very fitting amen and it's like a cross road we have to be able to go through that red sea go through the water baptism praise god thank god most of us were not ashamed to be baptized uh we called upon the name of the lord in the friends of a public people we're not ashamed to say i want the holy ghost i want to be forgiven i want to go to heaven you weren't ashamed at that crossroad to go through that road and keep following the leadership of the holy spirit praise god that's what it is it's a crossroad and so see believers must decide at each step to either continue growing or continue progressing in your walk with the lord perfecting holiness in the fear of god receiving god's strength to keep going or turn it down walk in obedience and keep going and growing or disobedience and stop and atrophy or fall back or like the bi like peter says like a a dog go back to its vomit or sow go back to the mud all these illustrations that they give us we must at each crossroad we must move on with the holy spirit and follow the right leadership of the lord praise god so at each crossroad god is going to have his his supply of anointing and then satan's going to have his bait right his trap and we've got to be able to choose god's anointing and god's supply and turn down the trap that satan wants to and snare us in okay life and death is set before every believer right at each stage just like adam and eve the choice knowledge of good and evil or life each one is set before us all throughout our journey just like israel they had a choice each step from red sea all the way at each step all the way to kadesh barnea to go in and possess the promised land they had a choice each time so i have i implore you i beseech you to obey the holy spirit at every spiritual crossroad of your life that's what i'm aiming to do i hope you're doing the same thing by the grace of the lord you'll either accept god's gift at the crossroad or you'll turn it down to accept something worldly all right so let's go through each and every one here the first one is faith faith is a substance needed to choose god's way so you either accept god's gift of faith or you'll reject it for unbelief you'd rather choose not to believe and because i don't believe i don't love it then i'll love the things of the world so that's the first choice you have to make do i want a substance of god's assurance his trust his faith because that's what faith is trust or revelation you trust you know god's will and you're trusting in god's will praise god or do you reject it and choose to disbelieve and live according to your your pleasures of your flesh or the lust of the eyes the pride of life lust of the flesh now in this series lord willing you know i felt i know i was anointed the holy spirit to write on each of these subjects and i felt led to do the same thing brother branham did when he taught the seals he would get the revelation and then search every time it was used in the concordance well that's what i've done is i wrote this book months and months ago i wrote this chapter by the i believe by leadership of the holy spirit so i take each word faith and trace it all through the bible though as a that was a big study right there faith i think it was over 200 times just in the new testament uh and then what brother graham did like with oil and wine and then or the color white like white horse rider your your sins worst crimson but they'll be made white like snow you know from isaiah you got to take each one and rightly divide it and place it in the right category right so the white horse rider went into the antichrist category but the white horse rider of revelation 19 that's christ amen that's good white that has a a good spiritual representation isaiah you know your sins scarlet made white that's on the good side that's the holy spirit side right uh forgiveness because that matches in revelation 7 that great multitude that no man could number he said where did these come from he said these have washed their robes white they've gone through great tribulation and they've washed their robes white in the blood of the lamb praise god amen thank god for the blood of the lamb today praise god that we can wash our robes white and it's fitting i got a white shirt on i didn't plan that but that's our garment should be white like the shirt uh free from sin stains praise god confess our sins of following the leadership of the holy spirit desiring to grow closer to god be more like him and get a fresh supply of his spirit amen so let's get our bibles here now we'll start looking at a few scriptures here kesha hebrews 11 1 and malachi hebrews 11 6. so let's have acacia read uh hebrews 11 1 so the first character quality that god wants to supply you with god has laid this before us right this measure god has laid it out and said it's a gift it's like a christmas present or a birthday present just hand it to you god is trying to hand it to you right satan wants to hand you that box of rattlesnakes unbelief but god's trying to hand you this divine gift of faith so uh can you read that hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen okay malachi hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him praise god so we see faith is the foundation and it is not just an imagination it's an actual substance it's a spiritual substance now we know it's not natural right it's spiritual substance so that means what other substance could it be it has to be the holy spirit right because there's only two kinds of spirits there's either holy or unholy so faith has to be a measure or characteristics of the holy spirit that god gives to us and you cannot please god without it see god would be unpleased god would be displeased rather if you turn down his gift how could you how could you and i turn down such a matchless gift the gift of faith eternal life praise god and so god cannot be pleased unless uh we accept that gift and then he lets us know there's more so we should diligently seek for more and then he'll reward us if we know this small portion is so great what faith can do in someone's life like zacchaeus or the woman the forgiven woman as we'll get to later look if it can do that if it can cause a man to give a fourth of his money away a four think about that a fourth of your bank account would you give it away a woman embarrass herself in front of everybody and wash and kiss a man's dirty feet uh uh and and and change her from a prostitute life to a life of a saint if if that power could do that how much more what greater rewards lay in store praise god and we know there are like on the day of pentecost right and afterwards when peter raised that paralyzed man from the dead hey i'm sorry not not from the dead but raise them up onto his feet praise god there's so much more and god rewards those who seek more of it we want more of god's spirit now faith is a gift salvation is a gift ephesians 2 8 by grace you're saved through faith that not of yourself it is the gift of god not by works lest any man should boast so faith your faith is not earned by human effort but rather it's freely given god's with open hands he's trying to give it to us right it's it's a good news now romans 8 32 he that spared not his son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen so each one of these attributes are freely given now church the struggle is the struggle is not god's you know like we're waiting for god to give us something the struggle is us accepting it right just accepting the free gift because the bible said he freely gives it but many times we've got to die out to these temptations and snares we're wrestling with with like unbelief hypocrisy or human reasoning sensuality haste irreverence selfishness resistance uh all the pride we might even say and so god is freely offering these and we've got to die out to our our own will and then accept the free gifts most people i know when sister wendy gives them a birthday gift they don't have any trouble receiving it i've hardly seen anybody ever give that back have as have you you have to whisper at your house there and ask it anybody ever give out those free gifts that she gives out so frequently or any gift at your birthday party or a work party school party most people are so happy to receive a gift that's how we should feel with god's gifts yes lord more faith yes lord virtue and more oh i need your knowledge i need to understand this i'll receive it because it comes by promise god you promised to send it thank you lord i know i'm gonna receive it i'm just waiting to receive it praise god that's the kind of attitude we should have because god wants to freely give it to us okay and then and then remember second peter 1 3 his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness not some things all things that pertain to life and godliness see this so we have every every possible gift divine gift you could ever want to receive god is freely offering it but we know as we saw on sunday god works everything for your good for my good and there's a time and season to receive all those gifts god has to teach us all these lessons we must learn all of them so that when we receive the gift we don't take it for granted like i was looking at that today in romans 11. paul said you know gentiles you're grafted into the vine he said don't boast against the branches that are cut off he said because if you don't continue in them you're going to be cut off so there's a tendency when we hear the message we get so thankful we're grafted in there's a tendency though to get complacent and to brag and feel like we're so much better than lutherans or methodists or catholics or presbyterians we've really got to fight against that we've really got to humble ourselves and really gotta find ways to serve others that's why bible club is a way i can serve others uh that maybe don't have the revelation we have uh you know of course preaching to our church you know that's a way i can serve other people making the youtube videos answering their emails and their texts and sending people free books any way we can serve other people at our expense and our sacrifice is a way to keep us humble so all of us need a ministry right all of us we've been looking at that over the last year or two now jesus said church it's hard to believe but jesus said few there be that find it can you imagine most people will take that box of rattlesnakes because it's pleasurable for a season they like to play i don't know how they could see that's pleasurable but satan must disguise it he must show some disguise that make it look so pleasurable that they'll take that death they'd rather love the unbelief than love faith jesus said few will find love for faith this this amazing divine gift that he gives so this is the starting place faith is a starting place for our spiritual journey before faith comes a person is lost in unbelief or spiritual death so without that anointing they're spiritually dead right in their souls ephesians 2 1 says unbelievers are dead in trespasses and sin well church i hope i get a hearty amen from your house praise god that you were dead in sins but now you're made alive in christ jesus amen dead no hope no covenant no promises no nothing but now we have life through jesus christ amen every every person listening to me should know what it feels like to be dead i remember being a slave to sin i was dead i hated going to church i mean i knew it was right but my flesh hated it and ran for 19 years from that but when i saw that six foot four man raised his hands at the athletes in action conference i repented of my sins it was a shame to myself but i found mercy i found forgiveness uh i i found all that i was looking for it all flowed down with me onto me from jesus's cross praise god that's right so see jesus says when you receive faith you passed from death unto life praise god see in heaven your name uh you recognize your name is there praise god because we know all the names are written before the foundation of the world you recognize your name is on the book of life praise god so faith comes when a believer rejects unbelief and repents of his sins trust in christ for forgiveness now in the greek repent means to change your mind for the better to hardly amend with abhorrence of one's past sins so we do three things you're going to change your mind you're going to make amends for your sins try to undo them and then hate your old sins so scripture calls this change of mind he calls it a turning of the heart so malachi and lydia uh that's her america and kate yo yup she's back okay so let's do lydia uh lydia luke 1 17. malachi acts 26 18. so luke 1 17 and acts 26 18. so scripture will call this repentance it'll call it the turning of the heart because the mind changes it used to think one way and go one direction but now it changes and goes a different direction as we know repent means to make a 180. so here's john the baptist in luke 1 17 lydia and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make great people prepared for the lord remember his message was repent repent so repent means to turn the heart your heart was uh grasping for the we'd say the supply of the devil right uh his pleasures and his cares of the world but now you grasp for the su now you're you're going in the direction of god's supplies god's spiritual goods amen thank god malachi acts 26 18 this is about the apostle paul turning people turning their hearts to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me praise god so paul was trying to turn them from the darkness to light and that was his commission there from the lord jesus himself praise god so so now you'll see you know now the bible will make a lot more sense as you see the turning of the hearts right the turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children now both jesus and john the baptist their first message they preached was repentance why because that's the foundation that's your starting spot that's where you start following the leadership of the holy spirit or the pillar of fire mark 1 4 says john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins praise god and then mark 1 14-15 says now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel the kingdom of god and saying that time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel praise god so even god god himself god manifests in the flesh the mystery of godliness he didn't he didn't start preaching where it was way too high over people's head he started right where they were at he said repent for the kingdom of god is at hand it is time for you to repent praise god thank you jesus so jesus says repent he says the gospel and believe the gospel which is the good news that we can be forgiven of all of our sins and become part of god's kingdom jesus says i came to i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance praise god oh church have you heard god's call amen most of us have praise god but i know i'm preaching the little children i know i'm preaching to people that will watch it later on the archives and people that may think they're saved and they may not be saved they may be make believers and this is why they struggle so much with living the message because they never really received genuine faith it was never the genuine faith of god uh the supply of faith that produced uh the fruits of repentance right like john said bring forth fruits meat or worthy of repentance praise god so jesus has called us to repentance praise god now at the very moment a person gets saved the anointing of the holy spirit comes drops down a very small anointing into their soul and it's called faith praise god it has to be because you have three parts to your being you have a body human spirit and soul remember uh peter said that lot was a righteous soul all right the bible said how abraham was justified by faith and his soul was saved we know so there's numerous scriptures where people in the old testament are described as being righteous having righteous souls so that has to be a small anointing in the soul it's a faith substance praise god and you get new life when that comes in faith comes in as new life prior to faith remember you used to walk according to the course of this world according to the prince and power of the air the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience all right so see we used to be anointed to work for satan's kingdom and walk in satan's paths but when you have faith now you change your path you don't walk in the path of darkness you're not anointed with demons anymore you're anointed with faith and it causes you to keep god's commands and walk in the light as he's in the light praise god so let's look at these two examples briefly zacchaeus and the woman the sinner who became a saint at simon's house two examples capture the very moment faith anoints their souls praise god it's beautiful so after zacchaeus learned that jesus was coming to his house and right there jesus we remember called up to him and said i'm coming to your house today zacchaeus and he says he said lord he said if i've done anything wrong i'll restore it fourfold right so four times the amount i stole i'll give it back praise god i think he said half my goods i give to the poor is that right so i think i said a fourth earlier i think he said a half he would give half of his bank account praise god and then give people four times the amount he stole back and i love what jesus said jesus didn't say yesterday or next week jesus said this day he said salvation has come to this house for as much as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man has come to seek and save that which is lost praise god aren't you glad that jesus seeks out your life uh no matter if you're up high in a tree right or you're down in a ditch or you're off in the uh you're the pig pen of the world jesus will come find you praise god he seeks and saves that he just had to walk by that particular oak tree right uh not oak tree sycamore tree he had a walk right by that sycamore tree right down that street he was led by the holy spirit he after he had to seek out that little lamb he left the 99 pharisees right to go get that lamb praise god so see church you and i can know the very day that we received faith because jesus said zacchaeus knew this day salvation came praise god salvation was already written in heaven right but the reality of it came and the anointing of salvation came on that day and zacchaeus received it praise god that anointing of faith now let's look at this woman at simon's house now we're not going to read all this of course but in luke 7 35-50 a sincere repentant woman called a sinner she found salvation at jesus christ's feet praise god what a what a perfect place to find it amen and she washed jesus feet with her tears her faith moved her to do this and anoint jesus feet and then wash it with her hair and then jesus pronounced her and said thy faith has saved thee go in peace notice she didn't save herself it was that supply of faith right because it's a gift of god hallelujah now this next part i'm going to skip is just on water baptism but most of us know just like john when john saw faith anoint people's hearts he said get him to the water to be baptized we know the same thing happened with philip and the eunuch as soon as eunuch believed he said get into the water and be baptized faith has entered into your heart so go do the natural act and prove in the natural what's already happened in the spiritual praise god of course we see acts chapter 2 3 000 people coming uh into the church now we don't know if they're born again or not the bible just said three thousand words three thousand souls were added that day now i did put a little section in here here let me uh let me just go over this real quick again um staying in the book of acts when people got saved they first had to hear the bad news in order to ex to realize the good news right so peter on the day of pentecost he gets drunk with the holy ghost praise god he's praising the lord he stands up there and said this is not what you think it is it's spiritual wine now his preaching is so powerful he first says it's not wine it's new it's not new wine it's spiritual anointing then his very next point is to indict the multitudes wicked act of delivering christ to be crucified so what would that look like today it's like when amen came to church you know and came up to the altar i spent that whole sermon rebuking sin telling the bad news right that churches and denominations were of the devil and and they allow you to they give you a license for sin i spent that whole sermon telling the bad news and then i threw out the net for with good news praise god if you want to be free here's the you want to be delivered from that here's the net come come join god's kingdom hallelujah and amen responded six people came up right i remember that day six one of them stayed looks like the five might have went back we're not sure only god knows but see you had to hear the bad news first and then after that he quotes psalms where jesus is the messiah god would raise from the dead psalm 16 david was not speaking of himself and then he makes himself he said i'm a witness of this jesus raised and uh the events of the the resurrection and he said now the events of today on day of pentecost were the promise of the holy ghost and he concludes it by declaring that the house of israel he said that god has made this jesus both lord and christ amen he's both the lord and the christ the anointed one so god has become man god god is manifest in the flesh praise god what a way to end it with the godhead praise god and that was enough he had to preach bad news said i'm a witness i know what i know what's happened i'm a witness of this and then he ends with the godhead and over 3 000 people right 3 000 people heard the bad news they knew they were guilty and so that's what preaching real preaching has to tell you what you're guilty of and then let you know the innocent messiah died in your place [Music] and you spent your life rejecting the savior but the good news is that jesus took your sin upon him paid the sin debt that you owed and defeated death by resurrecting and is now at the right hand of god and now he's pouring out his holy spirit upon believers praise god this news was so powerful it convicted 3 000 people from 17 different nations the bible said it prick their hearts in church if we go too long at services and our hearts not pricked we are backslidden we should always have that prick it's a sorrowful prick in the greek means sorrowful or agitated i see it on people's faces all the time right you may see it on mine when i'm when i'm convicted we when you're pricked you get agitated you're uncomfortable and it also means you're pained in your mind so you're you're not settled in your mind things are uh nerve-wracking right you can't get peace in your mind that's what pricked in their hearts meant so see bad news really hurts but it causes you to seek deliverance now you either run to the box of snakes right drugs alcohol sexual immorality uh tv movies entertainment uh money spending things shopping sprees chocolate right mcdonald's freeze whatever people whatever they do to try to escape the conviction to escape the pricking of their heart or you can say like they did peter what shall we do or you can come to the author and say preacher i know what i must do help me to do pray for me so i can do what i know i must do praise god amen that walking on water apostle peter he gave him the church's first and only creed acts 2 38 repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost praise god if the church ever had a creed but abraham said that was the creed of the church acts 2 38 and 39 now notice faith came after god's word convicts us of being guilty sinners we must admit our guilt and turn from our hopeless and wicked state which is called repentance and desire to trust in jesus christ for complete forgiveness this is the pattern that worked two thousand years ago it's a pattern that works today praise god hallelujah now i'll probably lord willing i'll try to uh get a couple more thoughts before i close here it's already 10 after eight maybe go about 20 more minutes by god's grace i really want to hone in on this uh story i want to get back now to that woman uh at simon's house that found forgiveness i kind of want to get ready so turn if you get your bibles here briefly here okay can you get luke 747 we'll start with luke 747. now i want to use her as an example again to what i what i showed uh last wednesday i kind of brought it back every person's decision is based upon love love is the very beginning of every decision jesus said they love darkness the condemnation came because they love darkness and then maokai can you get galatians 5 6. i just want to prove this again by the scripture the church every decision you make and i make is based upon love either agape love obedience by the spirit of god or filio love human love which is a perverted love it's not a faithful love it's a selfish love so by watching this woman you can uh unveil the origin of the order of all works they start with love then faith then works okay so occasionally you read luke 4 i'm sorry luke 7 47 second wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to the rumor little is forgiven the same love is little praise god now notice she was forgiven because she chose to love so you have to do something to be forgiven you have to love righteousness you have to love the truth praise god she couldn't be forgiven until she loved christ first love the gift the gift of faith uh malachi uh galatians 5 6. for in jesus christ neither circumcision avail if anything nor uncircumcision but faith faith which worketh by love absolute bible proof faith works so faith is first then works but before faith is love right faith works by love such beautiful uh scripture as my just it just amazes me every time i read this that god unveils the very uh purpose of everyone's heart it's love they either love the things of god or they love the things of the world and will be judged accordingly right so this forgiven woman first loved jesus christ which helped her receive faith then her faith went to work because faith works by love so let me go through this quickly so where did she get love i we don't know church but i'm guessing in her sinful state somehow she learned about jesus she heard that sweet name jesus or a rabbi the young rabbi uh and she must have went and watched him preach she maybe she watched him do miracles uh maybe maybe she saw great godly miracles maybe people in her family or maybe uh you know she saw great things or maybe she just heard right faith cometh by hearing maybe someone just gave a testimony that they were forgiven and baptized and saved and and uh and just shared it with her but somehow she fell deeply in love with jesus christ for his godly character amen and not just a little bit because jesus said she didn't love a little bit she loved much do you love jesus very much hallelujah do we love jesus very much i want jesus to say that about me jesse was a man that loved me much praise god not just a little not just a little bit of love for the message but love the message the word of god vindicated scripturally authenticated today that's the message what god is doing right now in the word of god jesse is forgiven because he loved much oh i that just makes my heart rejoice praise god put your name in there you're forgiven because you love much see it starts with love we got to hear a story about jesus we got to see jesus do a miracle right to see jesus do something hear about him the goodness of god right the goodness of god lepens hear about his goodness and that causes us i love that person i love this god and any god that would do this any god that would save me or spare me i love this god now because she loved she received faith because faith works by love she had faith she could be forgiven of her many sins no doubt she met other people saw their people uh receiving forgiveness of sins and she saw herself as a sin debtor because that's how jesus described her condition right she was forgiven much right so she had a huge sin debt so her faith in christ moved her to prepare to do the work of washing and anointing jesus feet we know she bought a very expensive aller alabaster box of anointment or ointment rather to brought it to simon's house and waited for the right moment to start working praise god so because she loved she went and sold uh you know all she had or maybe just took her money rather and bought the ointment and she waited to do the work church that's what we just have to do wait to do god's work just have just be so full of the love of god and just wait until someone needs you to pray for them or wait till someone needs you to give them some food or clothes just be so full of the love of god with faith in your heart say in your god i know you're gonna use me here i am lord i'm just waiting help me to be ready praise god and then at that moment when you see it it's time that's the time to go to work and she just didn't do a little half job she really did an awesome work job praise god because as soon as she gets there jesus feet or she starts crying and weeping and she uses those tears to wash jesus's feet with her long uncut hair what was it bob's hair it was long uncut hair then she starts kissing his feet and anointing them with ointment and then jesus tells her what she wants to hear he says thy faith has saved you praise god jesus always sees works as faith in action right jesus jesus wasn't looking and saying oh boy she's really earning this with her works jesus saw his faith jesus said she's she's expressing her faith and that's what we do with our works our works are an expression of our faith that's what jesus told the men that lay that brought that pal uh palsy stricken man down through peter's roof remember luke 5 says and when jesus saw their faith he said unto man man thy sins are forgiven thee praise god he saw their faith faith is always an action faith is always a work in fact we know james 2 says without faith uh without works your faith is dead we don't want dead dormant faith we want living faith praise god we want faith that people can see we want faith that that jesus sees as our works that are done for his glory praise god let me bring this down to close here so remember christians are not saved by works ephesians 2 8 but once saved christians recognize god created us to do good works so uh lydia can you get ephesians 2 10 for lydia see this forgiven woman she was created to wash jesus feet amen she was created to kiss those feet she was created to wash those feet the men couldn't do it right the woman had to do with her long hair she was created to do that oh church let's find what god created us to do and let's be so willing to do it let's be so full of love waiting to do it that we can't wait for the moment and then when the moment comes we'll jump at the chance and we'll do a love work for jesus christ uh ephesians 2 10. for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them praise god see before she could do this she had to fall in love with jesus in church some of you might be created uh to fast and pray to dance around the church right to cry at the altar to scream and praise god and cast out demons or something but you got to be so first so full of the love of god that you're just ready and waiting and willing and then when god tells you it's time that's the time to do it praise god so once full of love for him her faith went to work just like ours should do as well now in closing this section here so now faith versus works remember that good old debate that age-old argument it should be settled is it sound in your heart is it faith or works well it's faith that works by love right it has to start with love because faith works by love church you and i are saved by god's amazing grace and this experience of salvation begins when your heart starts loving god [Music] and this love produces faith in his eternal word and then faith motivated by love works out god's plan for your life and then genuine works of obedience always originate with a loving heart that receives god's supply of faith in the soul see that that loving heart just says yes lord i love faith i love virtue i love knowledge i love temperance and godliness and praise patience and brotherly kindness and charity i love the gifts of god so we've got to start with love when we don't love the preaching of god's word something's wrong we don't love sing along with brother amen or the song special something's wrong we got to love it if we don't love it we're not going to receive anything so church it all goes back to love how many at home want to love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength how many want to love him with all your effort tonight let's stand by god's grace so stop a little bit early there about just about 50 minutes of the sermon i love him i love him oh church i hope hope the word was a blessing to you tonight i know i've got children listening i've got people that struggle with their salvation like i told you i went to a church last fall and 50 or 60 year old saint what i thought was a saint comes crying weeping at the altar saying i don't even know if i'm saved sat in a message church their entire life if we don't catch these foundational things we'll never we'll never get to cadis barnia right if we don't cross through that red sea and really know i went through the red sea with the love of god in my heart there'll be questions later on let's settle it tonight if it's not settled in your heart tonight that you love god settle it [Music] reject unbelief reject the cares of the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes the pride of life hate your abhor your sins and fall in love with the one who can take all your guilt and shame away praise god that's the one to fall in love with
