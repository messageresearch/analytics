========================================

Holy Spirit I was sitting there saying amen I was enjoying it and I just appreciate a faithful brother like that he's always got a special place in my heart brother Brian he's just intrical part of our church and my testimony we're glad to be brothers in Christ Hallelujah and I just want to tell I don't maybe sister ha can rely or relay this on to brother amen um he and I were talking we talked for about 45 minutes on his drive home and he said when he walked out the second service he said he felt the the Holy Ghost was already there in a very powerful way he said he hadn't felt that in a while and he just he said just I just want to encourage you brother Jesse he said it it really encouraged me he said because uh sometimes in our church we'll sing 10 songs before the sermon 10 ssongs what how would you like it if I did that no it's all good but every church is different they're Sovereign of itself he said we normally do 10 songs at our church he said U but he was he said he was preaching in Indiana and they did about eight songs and he came out to this presence of God and he said after three songs on Sunday night he stepped out and he said he felt the presence of God the same he did with eight or 10 songs and so he wanted to remind me he said brother Jesse said don't ever feel discouraged he said God is in the quality not so much the quantity so just another good reminder and I told Brother Brian too I was we were watching the live stream when he when he prayed for Zion and it was either right before that prayer or during that prayer that Zion perked up and he started feeling better and he has not any of those sicknesses since then I'm just trying to say it real nice let's thank the Lord for that praise God brother Brian was really encouraged now we're starting to get worried you know it's been it's been about you know 14 or not 14 been about 10 or 12 hours since he'd been able to eat anything and I was starting to get worried but when he was praying there you know coming through the live stre Z just kind of perked up and started being his regular self there by God's gra reminded us of Jesus right the Roman ceran said just speak the word and when they got back he said when did did my servant get well he said right about the time right about the time so we're thankful for the word of God you know I want to give all the all the glory and all the credit to our Lord Jesus Christ because he's rich in Mercy acts 8:26 here thank you for standing I know it's been a long time to stand but we'll just read verse 26 let's read that together then we'll have you be seated one two three and the angel of the Lord spake unto Phillip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise God yeah I appreciate everybody standing so long there I didn't really mean to have you stand so long um so we'll pick up here on part nine we did part eight back in January so I kind of took a little break from that one was looking at the book of Romans series I'm still enjoying that one and we'll keep going on that one soon by the grace of the Lord but just A Brief Review you know we looked last time at the beginning of this chapter verses 1 to 25 on uh the Revival in Samaria and we we were looking at Simon the Sorcerer And what a what a character uh we see here you know we see how he went from Joy where he actually got baptized he went from Joy here and then after the Holy Ghost fell then he got bitter because Peter said you you got you're full of bitterness right your heart is full of bitterness so it's amazing how how people can have such a response to the gospel but if they're not careful the enemy can can fly in there Jesus said it's like a bird flies in there and snatches away the seed word of God so may God help us to have good ground that the word of God can fall on Hallelujah I know you do because you've been here a long time Hallelujah but remember even Judas the scarat had the ground for three and a half years until really showed up what kind of ground it was right here Simon the sorcer this might have been a few days we don't know maybe a few weeks he was baptized and then watching the ministry of Phillip uh but then it wasn't long he he sees the Holy Ghost fall and then he says I want to buy that with money now think about about that before he had all the power over the city with demonic powers and then he thinks I can spend money and now I can have control over the power of God and Peter says you don't even know what's in your heart in other words no man can control the move of God Amen God is Sovereign Hallelujah now we want the mind of Christ but no man is perfect right no man always has the mind of Christ no man outside of Jesus nobody's perfect only Jesus is perfect Hallelujah but it just it's just it's amazing how he went from such joy to such bitterness that fast and God help us now let's let's be honest sometimes we go from such joy to services and right after we can be so disappointed right or we can go through a Temptation go from such overwhelming joy we sing about to getting home and and there's such a disappointment maybe the pipe's broken you know or maybe we forgot to pick up groceries the day before Oh I don't have any food for supper tonight or you know you get a call someone died in the family and it's grief you know you experience such roller coasters but we must remember God is the author of all of this praise God the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord all things work together for good to them that love the Lord hallelujah so we're thankful for God's mercy and love and uh it was a wonderful time to look at the scriptures there last time now here we're going to look at uh uh we're going to start here again with uh verse 26 by the grace of God actually you know I'm going to just back up a little bit I'm going to share a few more things you know here you know in this chapter so far we've seen such a a contrast between Simon the sorcerer and Philip the Evangelist right we see such a contrast of course Simon was working under demonic power he was a sorcerer but philli was an evangelist right and we know an evangelist is to turn the hearts of the people right to get them to repent to get them uh to believe God to show the miraculous power of God Church we've seen that in brother Brian Hawkins life remember he was evangelist just came in here we've seen the supernatural I've seen God do Miracles through that man Hallelujah and I was privileged to be in the presence of one of them praise God the doctors had said brother Rod the doctors said uh he's a veteran the in the Air Force Air Force and he had degenerative hips and he said you're 45 and you got to have a double hip replacement and he told me that and I felt the Holy Ghost follow me I said brother you're too young to have that I said is all your sins confessed he saides I said let's pray we're going to speak to those hips we're going to speak life into those hips and so we just said a simple prayer few days later he goes back to the doctor the doctor said we don't know what happened Hips Don't regenerate but yours did hallelujah amen hallelujah I was there when it happened I was there when Jesus did it praise God and he's told that testimony and the doctor said we don't know what happened this happened before but we know Jesus Christ does it Hallelujah then the one time he prayed for the sister who she'd fallen and she had a um uh what's that sciatic nerve problem or the the backbone or uh and just had pain all weak and could hardly walk I remember she walked in here brother Brian prayed for her and she walked out here completely well pain all week and in the presence of God and she was sitting right there that third chair I always remember that third chair and she walked out of here perfectly well by the grace of God hallelujah so we're thankful you know God does that God sends us men that have gifts right since Jesus left the Bible said he ascended on high but he gave gifts unto men and if we can get into the will of God if we can get under the anointing of God God's gifts will operate for us praise God but we have to have pure hearts as well the preacher the gifted one or the gifted sister sisters can have all nine gifts but they've got to have pure hearts we've got to have pure hearts and then the gifts of God can operate praise God the word Charisma the gift of God hallelujah the power of God Amen God wants them use them Hallelujah so we must be ready so God can use us hallelujah so uh Simon was an enchanter he tormented people right he he brought vexations upon the whole city he would bring fear upon the whole city but Phillip always told the good news of Christ what a difference amen hallelujah what a difference you know that's what we should have tonight the good news of Jesus Hallelujah Jesus Lives Hallelujah he's here he's here to minister to us hallelujah he's here to forgive us hallelujah if we're in sin if we're discouraged or depressed he's here to lift us out of that Hallelujah he's here to give us hope Hallelujah but see Simon worked under fear and enchanting people and he made himself that he was great one right he made himself a great one but God made Phillip a great one is that right church right real real preachers real men and women of God Don't Make themselves great Paul said I was the least of the Apostles and then he said I was the least of the Saints that's a real man of God right there and yet we believe he was the greatest the greatest New Testament I believe he was the greatest New Testament believer because of all his sacrifices all his sufferings for Christ Hallelujah his whole resume of suffering we've been through that many times but look at this uh example of Philip he's used by God so Simon Bewitched the people but Phillip liberated the people that's what I love about Jesus you can come in here in any condition whatever the awful condition but you can leave out of here free Hallelujah I've I've come in here sick I've left out well amen I've come in here tired I left out uh rejoicing and full of the joy of the Lord amen you name it Hallelujah you name it any negative emotion you bring in you can be free of it and you can walk out of here feeling like you're brand new Hallelujah I tell you since brother Dennis came and preach on secret sins I've been living in so much Victory I want to tell you that I have just been noticing wow the God has God has raised me up a step by God's grace I've noticed it in my life Hallelujah and church is that what God does he sends his word to heal the people amen the Bible said God sent his word and it healed them Hallelujah I I love how Jesus does it praise God it's always the right place at the right time hallelujah amen Simon was under the power of Satan of course uh philli was under the power of Christ Simon was the power and kingdom of darkness and Philip was the Kingdom of Light Hallelujah Simon was full of evil spirits but philli was full of the Holy Ghost amen how many appreciate that by God's grace amen oh what a blessing amen now like verse 25 I'm going to read that again and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preach the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans and I just thought that was a good did you notice that phrase testified and preached you know this is what I found as a minister I've been preaching for 20 years right I found my when when God uses my sermons the most it's when I preach the word which means declare I publish the good news but then I give testimonies about what I've seen God do right because what good is it just a to talk about well God can God can God wants somebody who can also say I'm a testimony I've seen it myself hallelujah hallelujah see that the apostles just didn't say well let's preach preach preach preach preach they also gave testimony that's why it's so important for you and I to give testimonies tell somebody what God has done for you lately don't be ashamed of it we right just bring up his name you'll find when you bring up his name the atmosphere will change Hallelujah testify about what he's done hallelujah declare it yes and as as ministers we preach we declare the word of God we teach the word of God but each one of us can give testimony and that's how the Holy Ghost moves people just don't want to know about God you know the historical God they want to see the living Christ hallelujah amen glory to God Amen I'm saying Amen to the word of God hallelujah we always got to have both praise God testimonies and preaching Hallelujah and also I was studying and I found this thought too this a really good thought in this chapter Peter and John call down the fire of the Holy Ghost on Samaritans these are half Jew half Gentile so you know we we know there was there was this this discrimination right like the woman at the well in John chapter 4 there was always this discrimination Jews were more holier than than Samaritans because Samaritans were half Jew and half Gentile right there was always this uh the segregation and well you're not as holy as us you're not as holy as us you know remember Peter battled that later in Galatians Chapter 2 he battled that segregation sphere right that we're better the prideful thing or the for him it might have been fear of the Jewish teachers the fear thing but you know it's really interesting here that that that Peter and John now that they got the Holy Ghost they're sent there to a people that normally they wouldn't associate with but Hallelujah but there's Peter with the keys to the kingdom hallelujah amen Peter had already unlocked the kingdom to the Jews on the day of Pentecost we here he comes opening the the the kingdom of God with the door of knowledge I'm sorry the key of knowledge the Bible said Christ is the door Hallelujah but Jesus said it's a key of knowledge now Peter comes and opens it up to another another people the the Samaritans Hallelujah and now he's calling down the Holy Ghost upon the people oh what a what a desire church we should have that desire let your Holy Spirit fall Lord fall in this place Hallelujah fall in my home fall on the job follow my children follow my parents let the Holy Ghost fall Hallelujah now the reason that's so awesome is because earlier before they got the Holy Ghost in Luke chapter nine James and John were trying to call fire down from heaven to destroy people and the church said look at the difference between someone who's born again and someone who's not born again my goodness hallelujah what a difference someone who's not born again will want to call Fire And judgment and these people need destroyed these people need wiped out the Earth but now that they' got the Holy Ghost those they're called say God send us a different fire send us a holy fire send us a fire that brings joy unspeakable and full of glory amen look at that a different kind of fire they want to fall that's what we want to fall Amen Let the Holy Ghost fall hallelujah amen hallelujah oh I love it praise God now they're calling down for the fire of the Holy Ghost of fall that's what every Christian should desire that's why we should live our lives in such a way that the Holy Ghost can fall praise God that's the kind of life we want to live where the Holy Ghost can fall think about that when was the last time you felt like it fell now I can't think of it like recent times I'm sure it has but I know for sure in in Napoleon it fell right you just felt a change when we had the service about almost a year ago back in April I just felt something fall it just it just broke forth It's Like A rushian Mighty Wind came into that church right hallelujah it's like like a it's like living it's like a artisian well sprung up and all the joy and the worship and then the sighing and the crying and the repenting and the crying out to God hallelujah it just that's how the Holy Ghost operates praise God and no man like Simon can take control of that God moves the wind blows when God wants it to blow Hallelujah but we should live in a condition where the Holy Ghost can fall praise God it only takes two or three because Jesus said wherever two or three are there I am in the midst praise God Oh Glory Hallelujah now acts 826 we read 26 this is just a wonderful thought here a Phillip here is called to leave we'd say the Revival a Citywide Revival the Holy Ghost says I want you to leave this revival and go go south to the desert now think about this he's in a city the Samaritan cities he's got all the water he needs he can probably go down the market and he can buy whatever he wants right here and the Holy Ghost says I want you to leave here and he's he's seeing people saved and baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost saysi want you to leave this city now he could have said no how many know prophets sometimes disobey the word of God now Philip wasn't a prophet he was an evangelist right but how many know sometimes prophets disobey God's word right Jonah disobeyed thus sayith the Lord Abraham disobeyed thus sayith the Lord he said don't take any Kindred he took lot with him sometimes we disobey thus sayith the Lord right sometimes we dis disobey the word of God but look how humble Philip is I'll leave the Revival Lord and I'll I'll go down into the desert I love this he was so humble Lord if you want me to leave uh if you want me to leave this revival I'm not interested in numbers I just want to do the will of God I I'll go to a place where I don't have anything where I'm just out in the desert I'll go wherever you want me to go Lord I'll leave wherever you want me to go just let me know I've got thus sayith the Lord amen what a humble servant now for us it might be like leaving a big church they go to a small church right it might be something like that where you know looks like everything's going good the Revival's going good and the Holy Ghost would call you away now remember according to scripture we don't know if we ever came back to Samaria right because after this he goes up to cesaria if I'm not mistaken after he goes down to uh down south there uh and then to the desert and then he goes to cesaria after that we don't know exactly if he ever went back to the Revival but church we got to be willing to follow the leadership of the the Holy Spirit would you follow Christ into a desert guess where the Holy Ghost LED Jesus after after he got the Holy Ghost into the desert right you would think oh he's filled with the Holy Ghost when he got baptized that's what the Bible said the Holy Ghost is sent and remain but then the Holy Ghost didn't lead him out other places you know to he actually sent him into a time of testing right so we see that the Holy Ghost can fall and then it can lead you to a test kind of unexpected but we got to be be willing to follow the voice of the Lord how do you know it's the voice of the lord well you better pray and seek God's face you better make sure and the church said you better make sure we've seen a lot of people I've seen a lot of people as Pastor told me the Lord told him to do things and turned out the Lord didn't tell him to do that because it breaks the word of God God will not tell you to break the word of God like stop going to church stop paying ties marry a sinner the Bible don't say to do those things right but they can tell me whatever they want all you can do is tell them the truth and and ask that God would reveal to them that they need to follow the voice of God from the scripture but also if any voice is scriptural let's follow that voice it's God's voice amen but it's this testing time Hallelujah and so Philip gets called he's called to leave the great crowds and the great blessings now you would think wow Philip would be saying man look at all the fruits of all my ministry right wow finally I I've I've served the Lord I've Loved God all my life I'm seen all these fruits and then God asked me to leave the place where I'm so fruitful but God God was gon to do something greater church God was G to do something greater than just one city God was going to a whole nation Hallelujah everybody know the end of the story praise God Hallelujah the Ethiopian unic anybody know that story glory amen God was doing something but he still had to be obedient to the voice of the Lord Hallelujah he's called to the desert and he's called not to a Revival he's called to One Soul so this tells us Christ is concerned with the individuals Hallelujah yes he wants to see big revivals and big crowds and lots of healing and lots of Deliverance he wants to see that but he's not done hallelujah praise God he's got more souls there must let me say it Church there must be a fullness of the Gentiles before God can go back to the Jews we need more Gentiles to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen we're not going anywhere to the fullness every seat of God in heaven at the marage supper lamb has a soul that's ready for it praise God we're not going anywhere praise God and so Philip was was able to tap into that and be led by the holy spirit away from all this fruit we'd say and all this all this excitement and joy so he can minister to One Soul hallelujah it's a blessing my God is concerned with both the crowds and the individuals didn't the Bible say he never leave us nor forsake us the church said didn't the Bible say there's a friend that sticks closer than your closest friend right can I just paraphrase that than a brother you have a friend that's closer than your closest friend and that's Christ and think about this Christ thought so much about that unic that he hold the preacher away from his Revival he'd put all the seeds brother he'd sewed all those seeds and he wasn't going to see the end of that wow brother just I put so much in this and God's asking me to leave it sometimes he does sometimes he does this really shows how he wasn't a selfish person he was a humble person you know some some preachers especially we see with preachers they'll grasp on oh this is my Ministry and this is my work and I've done this and they would never be able to let go and say well somebody God has somebody else for this right church or it could be a song leader you know I'm not make I'm not preach on on Amen but I'm just saying you know because it's me too I could I could hang on this no one will ever preach here again but me or Malai on the piano you know people can get so attached to what they feel like they've invested in that they wouldn't even let it go and say well maybe go I feel God calling me to do something else and not realizing if God calls you away from it he's going to take you to something greater right either home to Glory if you go to the Grave or in this case going to take him to more souls he can have a broader impact amen hallelujah Glory that's what Jesus said if I give you five tals you make it 10 Hallelujah that's what here that's what Phillip does Amen he's able to follow that and now he can have more impact than just one city he can impact the entire nation of Ethiopia oh my Hallelujah so this is what it takes it takes a spiritual maturity to be able to accept the word of God and God's current perfect will for your life how going to live in the perfect will of God I do not want to be in the permissive will of God I don't want to be a Jonah running and getting spanked all over creation or all over the all over the ocean or whatever it may be all over Aran I don't want to do that I want to do what God has told me to do how do you know it the Bible said he'll put it in your heart amen I was just reading down to that numerous times in the Old Testament this week the Bible said God put it in the heart of Moses God put it in the heart of Ezra amen God put it in the heart of zerubabel God put that in their hearts in other words God's going to put something in your heart and only you can do it praise God but you got to take that to the word of God and make sure it is the calling of God hallelujah but we got that great confidence the elect will not be deceived like Jesus said it could be so close if it were possible the elect could be deceived but it's not possible to deceive the very elect you ever see Paul deceived no sir Hallelujah you ever see Peter deceived after he got the Holy Ghost well he actually he did fall one time so I better better be careful on that one it won't last for a long time I'll say I say they won't be permanently deceived that's how I should say that Hallelujah yeah we'll go through little tests and trials amen but they'll always know Christ is the the way Christ is the truth Christ is the life hallelujah amen so Christ is concerned in all these things and he goes down to verse 27 he rose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia and unic so he was a single man a celibate man of great Authority this was not just a common person he had great Authority Under Candice the queen of Ethiopia having charge of all her treasure this is a guy that knew how to handle money right that Queen wouldn't put somebody there that's a little fishy on money don't make the right deals don't you know don't put money in the right places Queen ain't going to choose somebody like that that's her treasury right he's a man that could be trusted with money May God help us all to be like that Hallelujah God can trust us with his resources saying a man who's just got he's got a small little influence this man has control over the whole Kingdom's Finance remind you of anybody Joseph Joseph Daniel the three Hebrew children children these men of great political influence right somebody asked me that this week could should a Christian be in politics I said only if God calls you right because it corrupts most people because they don't have the spirit that Daniel has amen hallelujah if you got the spirit of Daniel you'll be able to separate from all the things of Babylon Hallelujah and you'll get persecuted but you'll overcome because you know you're God hallelujah not something you just jump into you got to be LED if you go into politics but very few people I imagine God has to have somebody in there right but very few people probably will say true that's why God doesn't call a lot of people into that but here this Ethiopian has great Authority charge of all the treasury man and he come to Jerusalem for to worship anybody know how many miles he traveled to get there 1,598 about almost 1600 miles and I looked it up if you and I got in the car today well my wife and I should say and if we drove to Juno Alaska by car that'd be about that that one trip would be about the uh the round trip for the Ethiopian unic to get up to Jerusalem and back to Ethiopia imagine driving up to Alaska who wants to go on a road trip sleep in the car that's a huge distance and they didn't have air conditioning Cadillacs like we got today this this man look at this man this was a a Godly Man and church just goes to show this if you make a sacrifice God is going to honor you now the prosperity preachers always got well I hear the Lord telling me give me a thousand tonight nonsense and yet then they're doing drugs behind the scenes and all kinds of nonsense nonsense right I'm talking about look at this look at the sacrifice of a travel reminds us of the queen Queen of the South and she can't like what brother says she came ready to support it if God's in it I'm going to go find out I don't know but if God's in it I'm GNA be ready to support it hallelujah amen I'm going to support the gift of God if there's a gift of God I'm going to go check it out if there's a real gift of God and God answers my questions and God serves my soul then I'm going to support it with all I got Hallelujah that's how my wife and I came the message we came with our stack of printouts and what's these are all the attack against brother Bram show me where it's wrong and he just had to go to the first few page I'm like yes they're misquoting brother BR yes brother Braham grew in understanding and they're all just slanderous attacks brother wasn't perfect but he was a true Christian praise God he was Washed by the blood of Christ Hallelujah Church listen to him preach you don't hear any hardly anybody preach like that today such a man so in love with Jesus Christ and such living such a sacrificial life but that's what we need this this desire like the the unic like the queen of the South Lord I don't know if it's you but Lord if it's you I'm ready to support it with everything that I've got amen and God will honor somebody that makes a sacrifice like that Hallelujah such an amazing sacrifice this was not a guy who played church I'm willing to drive 1600 Miles by horse carriage boy it's been a couple years since we rode in a horse carriage that wasn't very comfortable even on the roads we had right over there in Pennsylvania a couple yeah a couple summers ago we all rode our that I wasn't enjoying that very much but you read later he was while he was writing he was reading the scriptures out loud and the church said oh come on jch in other words he was just all about the word I'll go to any distance I'm Gonna Fill my life with the word of God I'm gonna let the word of God be nigh even in my mouth hallelujah amen take a hard trip let's read the word of God you're sick let's sing to God hallelujah put on some worship music amen going through a hard time let's give God praise Hallelujah let's worship god let's got the Bible somebody just read the Bible somebody just call Jesus on the scene Hallelujah Glory that's what this guy did no doubt they didn't have paved roads right or anything that would we' resemble today's roads we know all roads lead to Rome you know but they surely weren't as nice as they are today and yet when Philip comes on him he hears him reading the scripture that's a good sign a man is hungry for the word of God he's reading the scripture everybody read your Bibles this morning you don't have to say Amen you can say ouch if you didn't hallelujah we're not all perfect but we want to make this uh a a constant seeking he come almost 1600 miles this shows he had a real heart for God he wanted the true God hallelujah like brother Ram said with the queen of the South he wanted something that could speak back to him amen all those Idols of the Ethiopia all the idols of the queen of South they couldn't speak back she seen there's nothing to it she wanted a God that could speak back and how do you know God was speaking to her she knew because my thoughts and intents and my hearts were being discerned my secrets were being exposed I knew God was there because nobody knows my heart except the one who made my heart and that's Jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah that's how I know when I come to this message the brother brandom and this bible-based message all my questions were answered Hallelujah all the fog and all the mystery of uh I was raised in Assembly of God brother uh all the Assembly of God questions I had and then I went to the Baptist church and then all my Baptist questions were answered amen just within a matter of a few sermons from brother brandham and where were the answers in the Bible they were already laying there in the Bible about our tongues the evidence well of course Paul said do all speak with tongues of course not you know the question of how can how can somebody uh do gifts of God and then Jesus in Matthew 7 says I never knew you depart from me the work iniquity and then brother R takes us back to balum the same thing you can temporarily have the anointing but later reject the anointing and be lost Jesus said I'll blot your name out Revelation 3 verse five I don't know why that verse has been on my heart these last few weeks but he said if you don't overcome I'll blot your name out you think Jesus is lying or telling some uh some great Fable story of course not Peter says God doesn't give us fables amen he gave us a more sure word of Prophecy hallelujah amen it's a more sure word hallelujah what a man what what a Godly Man here my church you know see this you know if he goes back and now he's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who's going to notice that Queen Hallelujah she's GNA come and say uh Mr Unix sir uh can you give us the daily update on the finances he's say glory to God yes Queen I loved you I was up this morning praying can I give can I just give you a testimony right after the the financial update tell you about all your interest and everything after that can I give you little testimony I met a preacher Hallelujah his name was maybe maybe he didn't get his name it was such a such a a short meeting there amen and then who's that Queen going to influence the queen or king of an entire land I think they're gonna have a pretty big influence don't you oh man I gotta go research more on the history of that but look God takes philli away from one city and then takes him to this man of authority over an entire nation God knows what he's doing because Jesus said you go and preach to every nation and we still haven't done it yet right internet that's helping out by God's grace but we need people to go there and demonstrate the power of God to show them that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever not just preach but testify hallelujah amen like I told you that one time I was preaching those young people there in Guyana South South America I I didn't know I was going to preach a youth meeting but I just felt the power of the Holy Ghost that morning and I said if God doesn't vindicate this message then I'm a false preacher or not when it was the last time you heard a preacher say that I didn't plan to say it that day it just came out I was 90 degrees I'm sweating you know I'm loving it you know I just love preaching you know I said if God don't vindicate this I'm I'm a false preacher and then I I ended with the altar call said now who wants to be baptized I'll run down there I'll be the first one down there and we had 20 baptisms that morning and God God even had the pastor son he's getting married this year the pastor's son was the first one to be baptized amen Hallelujah he ran from God rebelled against God and there God softens his heart praise God Amen Hallelujah this man was a worshipper now this is awesome I read this in uh have you ever heard of Kevin Connor he he died he's from okay he was from Australia he's a good Pentecostal teacher boy he is a quite a teacher I have a book of him on the Feast of Israel if you want a copy let me know brother it's so in depth but anyways he said said what had the unic found he was coming back home to Ethiopia from Jerusalem did you I I never really caught that from the text he was leaving Jerusalem after worshiping there but what what did he leave he left the Pharisees ritualism form ceremony traditions of men and Jesus said they're in vain unbelief spiritual deadness Jesus said you're full of dead men's bones so here's a man he travels 1600 miles I love this amen hallelujah he comes he wants to hear from God I want to know God I believe God I'm gonna listen I'm gonna read God's Bible all the way there and back he goes there and is disappointed there's no life here I know God used to be here glory amen hallelujah but I need a fresh message of the hour are amen these people don't have God I know God was here and God says I'm not going to let this son I'm not going to let my son travel all these miles without me doing something to bless him he came here he was disappointed kind of like the opposite of Queen of Sheba right she got there she found what she needed he got there he leaves away but I love this God knew he wouldn't stop seeking him oh you know why because God has for knowledge God knew you'd seek after him God knew you'd love him amen no matter how many years you ran from him God God knew eventually you'd you'd repent you start following him and that's why God never took his Blessing off your life hallelujah amen hallelujah so he's on the way home maybe he's on his uh 2,000th Mile and he's just reading Isaiah 535 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities all of a sudden Philip's like somebody's talking about me my Jesus Hallelujah and God's like I'm not going to let this unic I'm not going to let him travel all those miles I'm not g to let him get all that sacrifice and not reward my son you would think he might have been disappointed right the devil for have fought him you made all this trip and it's just a bunch of dead religion Tre Creeds and traditions of men but look he didn't give up God knew he was a faithful Saint God knew there was nothing that was going to turn this guy away if you want to know God there's nothing that's going to stop you Hallelujah from finding him amen you'll wait like Abraham you might have wait 25 years amen you waited 25 years for Isaac if you really believe you'll wait your whole life Hallelujah and then God will show himself alive to you that's what happened to this man this great sacrifice he doesn't give up he knows I know there's something real about God these men aren't manifesting it and so he goes looking he he goes there he sees this big crowd and look what he look you know he thinks he's going to find God in this big crowd but where does he find God in one little evangelist and said this one little halfwit preacher and said that because he wasn't accepted by the main the main group maybe he spit and slobbered like I do I don't know but he sure wasn't the popular preacher they had those they had the veres they had them and one man God used one man I love this this man the Unix reading the word and this man has just been the Living Word he's been preaching the Living Word I love this God is working on both ends this guy's meditating on the word this guy's got the Living Word he's got the word of the hour he's got the message of the hour and the church said he's got the revelation of the hour and God brings one who's hungry for it but hasn't found it to one who's found it and God brings it to him remember there's two parables in one of The Parables the man is looking for pearls and he finds the greatest Pearl that's if you're like looking for the truth right but the other one the man he he finds the treasure in a field maybe tripped over the the treasure trunk in the field he said I'm gonna go by this field I found it by accident right so however your testimony is God's the author of it Hallelujah whether you you were surprised in finding it or whether you were looking for it and you find like Simon Simon was fasted what two months before God showed him this message of brother Randa the bible message Hallelujah right other people they just kind of they just kind of stumble on it you know kind like me it just kind of I wasn't really looking for it I was you know I knew there was something more but I wasn't praying in my closet fasting for more of God like that and I just kind of stumbled upon it thanks to brother Simon praise God hallelujah is that that's beautiful Church your story is going to have a special testimony to it Hallelujah and God is drawing you to himself praise God so you just have to keep seeking after God right we have to keep seeking after God and as he reads the scripture he doesn't understand he's reading Isaiah the prophet verse 29 then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to The Chariot we just read last week they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God see right we got to be led to do things I feel God leading me to go to this person right I feel God leading me to pray for that person we must be led by the spirit of God see that and he says Phillip ran thither look he was in a big hurry he's running and he heard him read the prophet Isaiah so he's reading out loud in his Chariot kind of be like you and I somebody driving down the road they got Jesus music on you know or listen to their Bible app and hey praise the Lord like Austin had that Christian chain on right and he got to talk to a friend today Austin invited somebody to church today and he had that the chain of the cross on and that's what opened up the conversation kind of like my Jesus hat that brother forget that brother's name now MJ yeah MJ MJ saw that Jesus hey do you you serve Jesus oh yeah I serve Jesus hallelujah amen I love Jesus but he's reading it aloud and then Philip runs and says understandest Thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept some man should guide me now Look at look how humble this guy is he's not like you know I'm a great Authority I don't need somebody to teach me that's a lot of message people today I don't need a preacher I don't need I can just understand it myself look how humble he was he's willing to go 1600 miles one way he's reads the Bible out loud meditating on the word of God and then he says I need God to send me a man to teach me the word of God is that how you feel too you want somebody to tell you the scriptures praise God that's the that's the Bible Way didn't Paul didn't Peter say this is that which Joel spoke of right telling you what the word of God says hallelujah oh my it's beautiful see and I love this thought too this brother Connor brings this up he was still reading the scripture though he understood not the word he still read it if you don't understand God's word keep reading it don't say I'll never understand this or I'll never get it just keep reading praise God one of these days that Bible's going to open up hallelujah amen like it did for many of us I'm talking about for further Revelation just keep reading it will open up God's book is always unfolding praise God Amen it shows a heart that's really hungry for God and church that proves you have a pure heart when you seek God even when you don't feel nothing you seek God even when you're disappointed that proves you really love God no doubt he was disappointed who wouldn't be go up and see a a bunch of den of Thieves he went all the way to make a sacrifice to serve God and he finds a den of Thieves there but he's still reading his Bible on the way home let me just say like this if you ever come to church and you're disappointed go home reading listen to the Bible okay go home and praise God is that right church now hopefully nobody feels that here if you if you ever get disappointed don't give up on God it wasn't God's fault Hallelujah many times what I've seen over these years it's people's fault they don't read the Bible and study themselves enough so they can't grasp what the preacher saying that's what I found right or the Bible says they'll Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and that heat means to pile up they'll pile up all these false teachings and that's what they want to hear they only compile all the things that tell them what they want to hear these teachers promising them things they never ever get to right they promise themselves Liberty but then they get entangled again in the bondage that they already came out of in other words they get to go back and live their sinful life and still feel like I'm learning from the word of God they're not they're learning how to sin but Jesus wants to wash you in the waters of his word hallelujah amen we don't have itching ears I don't I didn't come here for somebody to itch my ears I came here so my ears could hear what the spirit says to the church tonight amen how many came that way tonight you came and I want the holy you said I want the Holy Spirit to speak to my ears tonight Hallelujah that's how we come to hear the word of God Amen so God's working on both ends he brought the Evangelist and the unic together for an eternal meeting hallelujah amen the spirit went before the word of God so he's got the word he's got the word but God had a somebody somebody who had the spirit to him and this is the point brother Brandon makes brother Brandon says notice God didn't send an angel to the unic God sent a body member of the body of Jesus Christ someone who had the Holy Ghost amen someone who knew the love of God the power of God someone who believed in the Supernatural That's who God said and church that's what the Bible says uh Paul says that God gives preachers to every man that's in the book of Timothy I believe he says the preachers whom God has given to every man so think about that there's preachers all over that that God has sent to them now the question is will you hear the preacher that God send you that's the question we know Jezebel didn't accept her pastor Pastor Elijah right it's a joke he's a prophet he wasn't a pastor but brother BR makes that joke right that ah 's Pastor was actually Elijah and he accused Elijah you're the one that troubles Israel Elijah said nope you're actually the one troubling Israel the devil always accuses you of what he's he's guilty of right right you're the one that's troubling Israel and who was right it was Elijah of course but they wouldn't accept the man that God sent to them God help us to receive the the The Men Who preach the word of God to us amen that's right that's the word of God and I love this Philip here and I'm almost done here y it's almost it's almost 8 o'clock clock's a busy body and he says how can I understand it except a man guide me see that's what God sends preachers for to guide you in the word of God but you got to have a learner Spirit remember Jesus said he said come and learn of me I'm meek and lowly in heart learn of me well how how can we learn from Jesus today through the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4:11 Apostle pastor Prophet teacher evangelist that's how we learn we got to come to church humbling ourselves right I'm talking just in general we got to come humble and ready to receive some instruction from the word of God hallelujah and notice he even invited him in I like that when God opens the door this man is so ready for the word of God he's like come on jump in my chair he's like he wasn't saying hey teach me some new uh uh Financial formulas so I can make some more money on the stock market he say no come tell me about Jesus I've got money I need Jesus money don't fill my soul money don't Satisfy My Soul only Jesus can fill my soul whatever I'm reading about here in Isaiah 53 whoever this Messiah is that's who I need to fill my soul praise God I know the queen I know big people I know big politicians what I need to know is the king of Heaven hallelujah amen my goodness verse 33 or 32 the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led to the Sheep as to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before a Shear so opened he not his mouth in humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the unic answered uh philli and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or some other man see God given him these good questions see those questions you got church those are good Bible questions God has a man who's got the answer but you got to do what the unic did if you want answers like the unic you got to do what the unic did you got to make a sacrifice Hallelujah you got to show devotion even when others are corrupt Jesus said they were blind leaders of the Blind and they'll both fall in the ditch but even though he saw it he said that's fine they they got to do what they got I do but I'm going to keep searching the scriptures oh we can learn so much how many how many glad you can learn from this gentleman right here I learned a lot from this guy the last few moments here or last few hours I've been studying this it's pretty good by God's grace I'm like my what a man and he says verse 31 then philli opened his mouth I like that look he was listen this this guy was a good listener too let me hear what you have to say he didn't take the floor and just you know just let me talk for first okay share share what's on your heart and maybe the Holy Ghost will give me a word to say amen I traveled all this way but I'm still so patient I'll wait for you to ask me a question the Bible said he opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Paul Peter Peter was a prophet but look what he did he preached to him Jesus that's what we need today people to preach Jesus hallelujah praise God he didn't preach about himself he preached about Jesus now no doubt he probably shared testimonies about what God did in Samaria there right because before they thought well it's only for the Jews remember Jesus told them only go to the house of Israel right Jesus told them but now they're starting to see wow God did this in Samaria he's got half Jew half Gentile and now clearly Gentile right but a Jew of Faith But a G Gentile by birth and now he preaches Jesus to him oh my glory then he says this as they went on their way they came a certain water and the unic said see here's water what doth hinder me to be baptized now what a sermon that was Philip preached all of Isaiah 53 Jesus is the Lamb of God he died for your sins and then he goes into I you know I just baptized all these Sam in water and then Peter and James come and the Holy Ghost fell and I was he was casting out all these devils and of course here's a holy man he don't have any devils in him so he's not saying hey cast The Devils out of me he knew where he stood he realized the one thing I need I need to be buried in the name of my savior praise God like Paul said I need to be buried in the name of the crucified one this this Mighty servant this this wonderful servant who gave his life I how do I become identified with him I've listened to your story now why can't I be baptized I just had somebody email me from Africa I don't remember the country but said they said the preacher was so busy he didn't have time to baptize the people because they have so many meetings and setting up all these things so they left that church and went to a place where the preacher said yeah I'll baptize you today and this is the scripture I share with them as soon as that heart is ready now the difference here is that they believe with all their hearts that's the thing this man was already a servant of God look his actions already declared he believed amen all his actions declared I already believe I'm willing to travel 1600 miles one way I'm really will willing to read my Bible in my car of course we wouldn't read while we're driving but he could I'm willing to listen to my Bible in my car I'm hungry for God and his actions everything backed up his actions and Phillip knew here's a man that loves Jesus with all of his heart praise God here's a man that's ready for the message of the hour Hallelujah and as he went on their way yeah he said verse 37 and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and answered said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God it took one sermon from this guy with the message of the hour to show this man the desire of his heart the Bible said Jesus is the desire of all Nations hey Jesus is Jesus is the desire of Ethiopia you know what America really desires Jesus you know what Africa desires and Australia they desire Jesus he's all of our desire Hallelujah now we know if few will find it right because they love Darkness more than light Jesus says but this is the desire this desire was in his heart and so God he had a deep call to the Deep so God had a deep to respond so church if you ever feel like you're alone don't be discouraged God can send you a Phillip here's a man he's all alone his Chariot he wants the truth for his day God will send it to you just have an open heart be ready to to understand the word of God when it's preached to you amen glory amen I was ready Hallelujah all those years ago in 2001 I was ready for this message Hallelujah I was ready for more of God hallelujah amen I know you felt the same praise God I'm trying to find a place to close all right now notice the Bible says verse 38 and he commanded the charch to stand still and they went both down to the water see this wasn't a sprinkling my Presbyterian friends listening on the lary or my Catholic or Lutheran friends they went into the water and the word baptized means immersion baptismo I think is the Greek word I'm not a Greek scholar I have enough trouble with the English right but he says they went down the water both unich and and Phillip and he baptized him and then what is this man going to do with the Gospel of Jesus Christ see it just needs the gospel just needs put in the right person's hands Hallelujah briyan just told me said brother Jesse he said me and these brothers we talking we don't know how you do all you do write the Books make the videos and preach I said brother it's because my job starts at 8:45 that's why I got all morning to get things done I said don't don't beat yourself up don't feel bad brother but I like when people can give you a testimony like that we preached last week the spirit Bears witness with your spirit that you are the son or daughter of God Amen so who would have thought like I was thinking on the way here who would have thought I used to spend all my Sundays watching the cev Browns and then uh you know I was a sinner i' watch the morning game the mid game and then the late night game I'd watch him all now I might take a break and go out and you know play the football in the yard or something like that but I used to religiously do do that and who would have thought if you would have watched me all the years who would have thought that I would trade all that Sunday for trade it for worshiping Jesus and preaching and shouting and praising God and dancing around the church and praying for the sick who would have thought I would have traded that only Jesus knew that praise God hallelujah who who would ever known that I would have woke up one day and said this doesn't satisfy I don't want to fill my days with this I want to fill my days with a man called Jesus hallelujah amen because the gospel is so real Hallelujah you've got a testimony you know about it praise God see the unic had heard had heard but it's kind of like job where job said in job 425 and6 I have heard but now I see hallelujah praise God I've heard all about God I've heard about the Old Testament but now I see God God sent me a evangelist now I'm getting better baptized and then he gets to see a preacher disappear right in front of him amen he gets to see a prefigure of a Rapture hallelujah what a type amen hallelujah see search the Scriptures Daily like the unic love God make sacrifices and you'll see a translation hallelujah amen hallelujah there's that this is the earnest of the Rapture the Bible said he translated 30 miles away it's like going up to Cleveland imagine that one day I'll be preaching here I vanish from the pulpit I go to Cleveland now I don't know if that happen but wouldn't that be awesome there's one still up there in Cleveland who needs to hear the gospel 30 miles he comes up by the water he's praising God where's the preacher God took him sound familiar like Enoch God took him amen you know Church Elijah had done this before Elijah had translated you remember the scripture this was new to me or fresh to me first put up First Kings 18:12 my good friend and we're almost done it's already 87 I didn't realize this but Elijah had been translated before he was raptured and it should come to pass as soon as I gone from thee that the spirit of the Lord shall carry thee wither I know not and so when I come to tell Ahab he cannot find thee he shall slay me but I thy servant fear the lord from my youth so see he had had this transport in other words Elisha knew that God could trans transport him Hallelujah they knew and remember Elijah had such power from God he could outrun ahab's Chariot even in a famine they knew this guy's a little different he can outrun chariots in the midst of a famine what kind of diet is he on hallelujah amen and he' been known Elijah said this guy could disappear he could vanish oh hallelujah amen that's that's a supernatural element to the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and this gives us courage there's no human curtain there's no Iron Curtain there's no bamboo curtain there's no Roman curtain that can keep the people of God trapped God can make them disappear Hallelujah and he's going to do that one day in a moment and the twinkle an eye with the shout the voice and the Trump they that are alive shall be gathered and changed in moment death will be swallowed up in Victory and will meet our loved ones will meet the dead in Christ in the air with Jesus Hallelujah this is what this shows us God has power to translate us any time any place Hallelujah let's stand to our feet by God's grace you've been a wonderful audience who called him away the spirit of the Lord CAU him away I'll say like this may God just catch us away out of our daily lives and may God just catch up may he just catch us and raise us up into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I mean the meditation of our heart Paul says we're already in Heavenly places and we understand that we've got a theophany already in heaven waiting for us we understand that but I mean let's get our minds off the things of the world and let's let's let's set our affections on things above by God's grace let's bow our heads
