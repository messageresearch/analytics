[3:18] here tonight we'll go to Romans chapter
[3:20] 13 I'll continue on this book of Romans
[3:22] series here it's part 28 by God's grace
[3:32] Romans chapter 13
[3:47] verse1 Lord willing we may get through
[3:50] uh the chapter here tonight almost
[3:53] towards the end of this book by God's
[3:54] grace been a refreshing
[3:56] book God's word is so true
[4:00] as we saw uh Martin Luther
[4:03] was converted through this book
[4:05] Hallelujah John Wesley was converted
[4:07] through the book of Romans hallelujah
[4:10] hallelujah and God sent brother Braham
[4:11] to restore all these truths amen all the
[4:13] mysteries of God and numerous of them
[4:15] were in The Book of Romans Hallelujah so
[4:17] we're grateful for Amazing Grace Romans
[4:20] 13 verse one we'll just read verse
[4:23] one then we'll be seated by God's grace
[4:26] let's read that on three one two three
[4:28] let every soul Soul be subject unto the
[4:31] higher powers for there is no power but
[4:35] of god the powers that be are ordained
[4:39] of God Amen may God bless the reading of
[4:41] his word we may be seated praise
[4:47] God we're now in this sixth section here
[4:50] of the book of Romans we uh looked at uh
[4:53] chapter 12 on Sunday by God's grace the
[4:55] Christian Life and service according to
[4:57] CI scoffield
[5:00] and got through chapter 12 and Lord
[5:02] willing tonight we'll get through
[5:03] chapter 13 13 is about submission to
[5:06] authorities and how love fulfills the
[5:09] law Hallelujah then chapter 14 gets into
[5:12] U judging not one another apparently the
[5:15] Roman Church had issues judging one
[5:18] another and no doubt because you had
[5:20] half half of them were Jews and half of
[5:21] them were Gentiles the Jews were very uh
[5:24] legal minded right and then the the
[5:26] Gentiles they were just naturally more
[5:28] worldly and so of course you had uh you
[5:31] know one judging the other and so Paul
[5:33] has to bring a balance to this by the
[5:35] grace of God Amen and then chapter uh 15
[5:38] is about Christ's example of service
[5:40] hope for Jews and Gentiles and Paul's
[5:42] Ministry praise God so we'll look at
[5:44] verse one here I'll just preach through
[5:45] this here by God's
[5:47] grace then at the end I there's is
[5:50] there's one more special prayer request
[5:51] I want to do at the end I have a uh I
[5:55] have a friend uh from my hometown uh he
[5:59] has is
[6:00] Ms and uh he's in Hospice now I think
[6:03] he's 30 we'll be let's see six years
[6:07] younger than me so he'd be 38 and he's
[6:09] lived a long life that's a long life
[6:10] with Ms um and his dad texted me and
[6:14] said can you come see him before he dies
[6:16] and I'm like well you know we got all
[6:18] this going on you know my wife's not
[6:20] feeling well got the bank situation you
[6:22] know with identity the so Lord willing
[6:24] I'll try to see him on Friday but I do
[6:26] want special prayer you know maybe we
[6:27] can all just pray for him
[6:31] um uh I was I went to bed crying on
[6:33] Sunday night you know thinking about
[6:35] this uh good friend and uh I just I hope
[6:38] God will just give me Grace so I can be
[6:39] there and make sure the man is saved you
[6:41] know he's a 38- year old man but he's
[6:42] been in a wheelchair since I since I've
[6:44] met him and he's just lost more and more
[6:46] control where he can't even talk anymore
[6:48] you know when I met him he could move
[6:50] his arms and his head and everything
[6:51] like that and now he can't move anything
[6:53] you know that's just the that's the
[6:55] nature of
[6:56] Ms so uh that's I want to remember to
[6:59] pray at the end and I've forgotten a
[7:01] couple times to pray at the end so
[7:02] brother Rod remind me or somebody remind
[7:03] me by God's grace I get thinking about
[7:06] the word and I just forget but that's a
[7:08] really important need
[7:10] there so uh Chapter 13 Verse one let
[7:13] every soul be subject under the higher
[7:14] powers for there is no power but of god
[7:17] the powers that be are ordained of God
[7:20] there's quite a lot in there I'm not
[7:22] going to get on all this but you can
[7:23] look at every example down through the
[7:25] Bible and in every example there was
[7:27] always a Believer but that believer was
[7:29] normally under the headship of a heathen
[7:31] ruler like we just saw Daniel a couple
[7:34] weeks ago and there's Daniel under
[7:36] Nebuchadnezzar right and Daniel had to
[7:39] submit to the law of the Babylonians
[7:43] right and then the mes and Persians but
[7:45] in each case where it it the laws you
[7:48] know went against his faith he cried out
[7:50] to God and he would ask for Mercy he'd
[7:53] ask for an exception in every case
[7:55] according to the word of God God granted
[7:57] his request because his one desire was I
[8:00] don't want to be defiled with the world
[8:03] praise God him and the three Hebrew
[8:05] children you know they uh they didn't
[8:07] want to be defiled and so I just love
[8:09] that if there was a desire to be pure
[8:11] God made a way for them to be pure
[8:14] Hallelujah remember in when Paul wrote
[8:16] this this was a time of Peace for
[8:17] Christians but the peace didn't last
[8:19] very long in
[8:21] Rome uh Scofield says this letter was
[8:24] written around 60 AD how many remember
[8:26] the name Nero the Roman Emperor Nero
[8:29] well in 64 ad uh on purpose he burnt
[8:32] down three quarters of Rome and blamed
[8:34] the Christians I don't know if you read
[8:36] that in history and he went they went
[8:37] through the city and martyred nearly
[8:40] every
[8:40] Christian and so uh you know in this
[8:43] case you know we have to look at the
[8:45] context of this so Paul must have wrote
[8:47] this in a time of Peace where Christians
[8:49] have had the Liberty to exist in Rome
[8:52] right let every soul be subject under
[8:54] the higher Powers there's no power of
[8:56] God but the powers that be are ordained
[8:58] of God so God ordained Nero right in the
[9:01] first century right God ordained
[9:03] Nebuchadnezzar in fact he calls
[9:05] Nebuchadnezzar my servant right he
[9:07] called Cyrus my
[9:09] servant right God will use them for
[9:12] God's purpose so we have this reality
[9:15] there's times where Christians have
[9:17] peace and there's times where they go
[9:18] they go through persecution and God
[9:21] allows both right each one is for a
[9:23] different kind of testimony remember
[9:25] there's two kinds of crowns there's a
[9:27] martyr's crown and there's a crown that
[9:29] you must strive for those who strive for
[9:30] the Mastery Hallelujah and so we must
[9:34] strive until persecution comes to us we
[9:36] must strive
[9:37] Hallelujah and as long as we have peace
[9:39] we must submit to the higher Powers the
[9:42] law right uh because God ordained this
[9:45] you know it's hard for us to imagine but
[9:47] God ordained the current president in
[9:48] there right now it's hard for us to
[9:49] imagine that right but if we go back a
[9:51] couple more you know with other ones
[9:53] it's hard to imagine how God allowed
[9:54] that but God did allow it it's all
[9:57] fitting into prophecy
[9:59] right this nation we know this nation is
[10:01] in Roman or Revelation 13 11 to18 this
[10:05] nation is the Beast that rose up out of
[10:06] the land not the sea not many people but
[10:08] out of the land North America right this
[10:12] and this this nation is going to be used
[10:13] to lay down the mark of the beast we
[10:15] don't know if it's in our lifetime or
[10:16] another lifetime but we can see it going
[10:18] that way look how they're persecuting uh
[10:20] the administration is persecuting the
[10:22] the leading opponent right you can you
[10:24] can search that's what Nero did Nero
[10:26] Nero murdered all his political
[10:28] opponents
[10:30] right and in the history of our nation
[10:31] we've never had the persecution with an
[10:33] opponent like it is right
[10:35] now and remember it's birth pains it's
[10:38] just going to get slowly worse and worse
[10:40] Jesus said it's birth pains all these
[10:42] things are birth pains right so we can
[10:44] see it going that
[10:46] way but God allowed this what is it
[10:48] bringing us to it's bringing us to a
[10:50] place of pressure where the Potter is
[10:52] applying pressure to the clay praise God
[10:55] we've got to be willing to uh praise God
[10:57] no matter what pressure comes way am I
[11:01] know God knows I need that hallelujah
[11:03] amen we all need that because we've had
[11:04] nice lives right we've had very peaceful
[11:06] lives for the most part but we can start
[11:08] to see things are changing slowly but
[11:11] surely and you know as the scripture
[11:13] says as long as the higher powers are in
[11:16] obedience to God then we should uh obey
[11:18] them now we know earlier you know in
[11:21] time you know around 34 ad right in the
[11:24] book of Acts we know as soon as you know
[11:26] the uh the the government arrested the
[11:28] Christians you know uh they said don't
[11:30] speak in the name of Jesus but we know
[11:32] they had to speak in the name of Jesus
[11:34] we know if a man if a man government
[11:36] says something against the word of God
[11:38] we'll take the word of God Amen so that
[11:40] must be understood within this context
[11:42] here Paul's not saying you know uh stop
[11:45] worshiping you know or stop praising God
[11:47] he's saying as long as the laws are
[11:49] align with uh Christianity obey them now
[11:52] it's interesting as you know maybe in
[11:54] Canada they're not allowed churches are
[11:55] not allowed to speak against spanking
[11:58] children did you know that
[12:00] so preachers have to make sure in Canada
[12:02] they could go to jail if they and this
[12:04] has been for years they've had this for
[12:06] years because I asked the brother about
[12:07] it they're like yeah you just got to
[12:08] wait till the live stream's off and you
[12:09] got to teach it in small small groups
[12:12] and don't you think they're going to
[12:12] send at some point don't you think
[12:13] they're going to send spies in
[12:16] there yeah so we have to understand this
[12:19] in light of uh in light of what
[12:22] government says we understand the
[12:24] pressure is coming down and so we got to
[12:26] be ready by God's grace Paul's going to
[12:27] say it later he said he said it's high
[12:30] time that we've slept let us wake unto
[12:32] righteousness Amen in other words we got
[12:34] to stir ourselves up praise God because
[12:37] we don't know what God will allow we got
[12:39] to be ready right we have to be ready
[12:40] for whatever God may allow and so Nero
[12:43] four years later as we said uh he he
[12:46] purposely B he created he created a
[12:49] disaster brother Nero created This
[12:51] Disaster himself and then he blame the
[12:53] Christians for it sounds a lot like our
[12:56] government right they create 911 and
[12:59] then they take rights away right they
[13:02] create January 6 and they do other
[13:03] things right political persecution the
[13:06] same thing same Spirit right it's that
[13:09] Roman Spirit hallelujah it's that iron
[13:12] Spirit right we can see it
[13:15] plainly and so this is and brother Ram
[13:17] says thus sayi the Lord the same
[13:19] persecution uh that that the the Pagan
[13:21] Rome put on the Christians will repeat
[13:22] in America and that's in Revelation 13
[13:25] if you don't take the mark of the beast
[13:26] the Bible said they'll kill you right
[13:29] but thank God we're trusting we'll be
[13:30] out of here by God's grace that's
[13:32] according to Revelation 3:10 because you
[13:34] kept the word of my patience I will keep
[13:36] you from the hour of Temptation that
[13:38] will come upon the whole world
[13:39] Hallelujah that's a promise that we
[13:41] believe Hallelujah now Romans 13:2
[13:44] whosoever therefore resists the power
[13:46] resists the ordinance of God so when a
[13:49] uh when a government is in obedience
[13:51] with God and you resist it you're
[13:52] actually resisting
[13:54] God right and they that resist shall
[13:57] receive to themselves damnation
[13:59] Hallelujah so people today you know uh
[14:03] you know you you've seen it over the
[14:04] years I forget the name of that one
[14:05] group down there in Texas but there was
[14:06] this radical Christian group and they
[14:08] were uh speaking murder and all kinds of
[14:11] things and uh they were and they were
[14:13] eventually arrested and that was rightly
[14:15] so right they they don't have they don't
[14:17] have the freedom of speech to to want to
[14:20] kill people and murder people you can't
[14:21] say those things right that's rightly so
[14:24] so when people break the laws and they
[14:27] get punished that was the that was a
[14:29] just punishment in other words right so
[14:32] to resist the the the the laws that are
[14:34] acceptable to God is to resist God
[14:37] hallelujah now we can see it on things
[14:40] like we should be very honest with our
[14:42] taxes right we should very be very
[14:45] honest when we drive our
[14:46] cars Hallelujah we should be completely
[14:50] honest in those things right because if
[14:52] we resist the the laws of God as long or
[14:54] laws of man as long as they obey the
[14:56] laws of God if we resist that then
[14:58] there's going to be punishments for it
[15:00] Hallelujah verse three for rulers are
[15:03] not a terror to good works but to evil
[15:05] now again that's in context as long as
[15:08] the rulers are not evil right think of
[15:12] again think of uh the book of Acts wil
[15:14] thou then not be afraid of the power do
[15:16] that which is good and thou shalt have
[15:18] Praise of the same so in a peaceful
[15:20] government if you do what's right people
[15:22] will praise you right you have you have
[15:24] a good reputation good now verse four
[15:26] for he's the minister of God to thee for
[15:28] good
[15:30] this is when you have good leaders but
[15:31] if thou do that which is evil be afraid
[15:33] for he beareth not the sword in vain or
[15:36] punishment right corporal punishment is
[15:38] what Paul's speaking of in the Roman
[15:40] civilization for he's the minister of
[15:42] God a Revenger to execute wrath upon him
[15:44] that doeth evil wherefore you must needs
[15:47] be subject not only for wrath but also
[15:49] for conscience sakes you won't obey the
[15:51] laws of land so you don't get wrath
[15:53] God's wrath upon you right but also for
[15:56] your conscience so you have a good
[15:58] conscience I know I've kept the laws
[16:00] amen right I've kept the word of God
[16:02] also I've kept both Hallelujah laws of
[16:04] man laws of God right verse six for for
[16:08] this cause pay you tribute also so he's
[16:10] speaking of paying tribute to Rome or
[16:12] taxes to Rome for they are God's
[16:15] ministers attending continually upon
[16:18] this very thing verse seven render
[16:21] therefore to all their dues tribute to
[16:23] whom tribute is due custom to whom
[16:24] custom Fear To whom fear honor to him
[16:27] honor I'll never forget this one uh man
[16:29] man he was a preacher and he he was a
[16:32] Baptist preacher he found what he
[16:33] thought was a loophole not to pay taxes
[16:36] well guess what he he went around
[16:37] bragging around I have to pay taxes well
[16:39] he got arrested and spent about 15 or 20
[16:40] years in
[16:42] jail right now that that's fine I mean I
[16:46] mean I guess I'll say like this you know
[16:48] he might have found something but like
[16:50] he should have known they're not going
[16:53] to let you get away with that it would
[16:55] have been better just to give them their
[16:56] their money that they want and have your
[16:58] freedom to preach the gospel and the
[17:00] Very Prime of his ministry lost it all
[17:03] in the very Prime of his ministry right
[17:05] he's still alive today every now and
[17:07] then I'll watch one of his videos I
[17:08] don't want to name him but that that's
[17:09] just something where you know uh uh
[17:12] someone thinks they see something but
[17:14] you better be careful it'd be better
[17:16] just to go with the flow Hallelujah
[17:18] right and keep just a couple a couple
[17:20] dollars right verse eight owe no man
[17:24] anything now of course this doesn't mean
[17:25] not to take out debts it doesn't mean
[17:27] that it just means you better pay pay
[17:29] your debts
[17:31] Hallelujah but to love one another for
[17:33] he that loveth another hath fulfilled
[17:35] the law so now we get into this uh
[17:37] section here on love this is how love
[17:40] this is how the love of Jesus Christ
[17:41] fulfills all the all the commands
[17:43] hallelujah amen this is it right here
[17:46] verse n for this Thou shalt not commit
[17:47] adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt
[17:50] not steal Thou shalt not bear false
[17:52] witness Thou shalt not covet and if
[17:54] there be any other commandment it is
[17:55] briefly comprehended in this saying
[17:57] namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[18:01] thyself this is how love keeps all the
[18:04] law of God Amen right because when you
[18:07] love when you love you never as we're
[18:09] going to hear in a few verses when you
[18:11] love God and love people you you'll do
[18:13] everything you can not to do them any
[18:15] ill will
[18:18] Hallelujah love keeps all the entire law
[18:21] so if I love God then I'll love his
[18:22] creation if I love his creation I won't
[18:25] commit adultery I won't kill his
[18:26] creation I won't steal I won't bear
[18:29] false witness I won't covet because I
[18:31] love God and I love God's people
[18:33] hallelujah verse 10 love worketh no ill
[18:37] to his neighbor therefore love is the
[18:40] fulfilling of the law Hallelujah that
[18:43] that's how you know uh the Bible also
[18:45] calls it Integrity right this is what
[18:47] aimik had right this is what Abraham had
[18:49] this is what job had Hallelujah Hezekiah
[18:51] had Integrity right when you when you're
[18:54] walk in Integrity you don't want to do
[18:55] anybody any wrong you just you wish the
[18:58] best for everybody
[19:00] Hallelujah and so this is the uh reality
[19:03] of Love Christian love within a peaceful
[19:06] government praise
[19:07] God and we have that for the most part
[19:10] now of course you know Church uh there
[19:12] are some states where it's it's just
[19:14] totally chaos right now like New York
[19:16] New York City and Chicago Philadelphia
[19:19] there's some places you might not want
[19:21] to go in Philadelphia right we talked
[19:23] about that there are some places you
[19:24] don't want to go because it's it's there
[19:26] there's uh violence crime
[19:29] uh people wandering the streets all
[19:30] kinds of things I mean uh the cops I
[19:33] just watched a video this week uh the
[19:35] cops passed somebody breaking into a
[19:37] business and didn't even stop him out in
[19:38] California just let him
[19:40] go uh you know it just this is the way
[19:44] some places are are coming right because
[19:46] there's no law there's no rule of law
[19:49] there's no consequence to the law the
[19:52] I'm talking about the natural law right
[19:55] and so when we walk by love we seek no
[19:58] ill to anyone we want to be pure in
[20:01] everyone's sight verse 11 and that
[20:04] knowing the time that now it is high
[20:06] time to wake awake out of
[20:10] sleep for now is our Salvation nearer
[20:14] than when we
[20:16] believed so this is quite a statement
[20:18] now now I just thought I didn't even
[20:20] catch this he wrote this just four years
[20:22] before Nero would bring persecution on
[20:25] Christians wake up in other words wake
[20:27] up make sure you're treating others the
[20:30] right
[20:30] way
[20:32] Hallelujah because the holy spirit is
[20:35] here is going to warn them it's time to
[20:36] wake up live pure live honest he's GNA
[20:39] he's going to say that a little later
[20:40] live honest before all
[20:44] men now this also calls to mind the
[20:47] parable of the 10 virgins right in
[20:48] Matthew 25 they were all sleeping but
[20:52] then there was a voice that said the
[20:54] bridegroom's coming go you out to meet
[20:56] him it woke them all up Hallelujah
[20:59] so it kind of gives this idea in every
[21:01] generation there comes a waking or a
[21:03] shaking to the generation I believe
[21:05] we're getting close to that by God's
[21:07] grace with this political we're getting
[21:08] closer to that I've never seen it like
[21:11] this right it's a shaking time
[21:17] Hallelujah God gave us four years of
[21:19] Peace you know from 2017 to 2020 kind of
[21:22] well kind of I guess Co was in there too
[21:25] right there was peace for Israel
[21:27] remember all the the peace treaties with
[21:28] isra is during those years economy was
[21:30] good everything was good now look what's
[21:32] happened these last four years just a
[21:35] little space of Grace right there right
[21:36] those four years so Paul is saying hey
[21:40] wake up we got to be spiritually awake
[21:43] our Salvation is nearer than when we
[21:45] believed right and and that's just
[21:47] logical that's common sense right the
[21:50] Rapture is sooner than it was last year
[21:53] Hallelujah whatever God whatever big
[21:56] move is coming with the tribulation or
[21:57] whatever rapture
[21:59] it's nearer than it ever has been we
[22:01] ought to wake up
[22:03] Hallelujah be awake and this is now this
[22:05] is in the context of doing good works of
[22:09] of being a A good rule following citizen
[22:12] by God's grace a law-abiding Christian
[22:15] citizen
[22:17] right verse 12 so I believe it's very
[22:19] applicable for today
[22:21] Hallelujah the night is far spent the
[22:25] day is at hand the dawning of a new day
[22:27] what's he talking about the day of the
[22:29] Lord the Millennium right now the day of
[22:31] the Lord is Armageddon and after Christ
[22:33] comes down now it's God's day but God
[22:35] has to destroy all his armies all the
[22:37] enemies the enemy armies rather and then
[22:41] a new day Dawns the Millennium
[22:43] Dawns
[22:45] Hallelujah so the the night is far spent
[22:49] Hallelujah the day is at hand in other
[22:51] words the Rapture and the millennium are
[22:53] at hand let us therefore cast off the
[22:55] works of darkness and let us put on the
[22:58] armor of light let us put on the full
[23:00] armor of God hallelujah amen all the six
[23:03] pieces Hallelujah five of them are
[23:05] defensive one of them is offensive
[23:07] Hallelujah put on the armor of God
[23:10] remember this is the same thing he said
[23:11] in first Thessalonians 5 we are not
[23:13] children of the night we're Children of
[23:14] the day
[23:16] hallelujah hallelujah we are not
[23:17] children of Wrath God has promised us a
[23:20] pardon of
[23:22] Wrath right as far as the tribulation
[23:25] it's a pardon from the tribulation but
[23:27] just like those Christ down in Rome in
[23:29] Nero's Day sometimes God allows people
[23:32] to be persecuted and give their lives as
[23:34] Martyrs it's happening a lot in Kenya I
[23:37] saw some uh news about Kenya Christians
[23:38] being persecuted in
[23:40] Kenya right there I mean there's
[23:42] different places all around the world
[23:43] where people are being persecuted and so
[23:45] Paul's saying wake up God help us to
[23:48] wake up
[23:49] Hallelujah help us to put on the armor
[23:51] of light help us have on the full armor
[23:54] of God hallelujah verse 13 let us walk
[23:57] honestly as has in the day not in
[24:00] rioting and drunkenness now think about
[24:02] all the Riots of 2020 my goodness I'm
[24:05] glad we weren't a part of that
[24:07] Hallelujah and of course drunkenness we
[24:10] shouldn't get drunk I hope you haven't
[24:12] Hallelujah since you became a chrisan
[24:15] now chambering is sleeping around like
[24:17] fornication so don't don't Riot
[24:20] drunkenness uh fornication and
[24:23] adulteries and uh wanness which is
[24:26] lusciousness or lawlessness
[24:29] don't live a life like that not in
[24:31] Strife striving against people or
[24:34] envying other people hallelujah and so
[24:38] here Paul this is what he's telling the
[24:39] Christians living in Rome which was full
[24:41] of that I was reading some history and
[24:43] they had all these festivales to all
[24:45] their gods and these people would have
[24:47] parades it's just like today my goodness
[24:48] it's just like today where they have all
[24:50] their pride parades and all their sin
[24:52] parades and everything and they be up
[24:54] late nights and loud music and
[24:55] everything those Spirits don't die but
[24:57] thank God the Holy Spirit will never die
[24:59] Hallelujah one day the evil spirits will
[25:01] die Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost will
[25:03] never die
[25:05] Hallelujah and so Paul's saying now so
[25:08] see people in the church some of the
[25:09] Gentiles must have been kind of getting
[25:11] tempted by this because he said don't do
[25:13] this he said put on the armor of light
[25:16] put on the armor of God hallelujah
[25:18] remember in every church if it's a
[25:20] believing church sometimes you got wise
[25:22] and foolish virgins I talked to a
[25:24] preacher years ago and I I said brother
[25:26] I said H how come I said said brother is
[25:28] you know is everybody in your church
[25:30] born again he's like no I don't believe
[25:32] that I said well then what do you do
[25:35] well he said well I keep offering the
[25:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but
[25:38] then I realize if they're a foolish
[25:40] virgin I just want to help them be the
[25:42] best Christian that they can be I
[25:44] thought that really blessed me that gave
[25:45] me a lot of wisdom in other words I
[25:47] can't force somebody I can't give the
[25:49] increase only God can give the increase
[25:52] I need more increase in my life amen we
[25:55] all need more increase in our lives
[25:56] Hallelujah that really help me right and
[25:59] that that scripture going back to
[26:00] Jesus's parable of the wise and voen
[26:03] virgins they were both together
[26:05] Hallelujah they both heard the cry amen
[26:08] they both heard wake up the bridegroom's
[26:10] coming Hallelujah the night's far spent
[26:13] the day is at hand put on the armor of
[26:15] light Hallelujah go you out to meet
[26:17] Jesus
[26:18] amen hallelujah so it makes it makes
[26:21] scriptural sense it fits all the
[26:24] scriptures Hallelujah that you know some
[26:26] foolish vergins might have been kind of
[26:28] tempted by these
[26:30] things and so Paul's got to say do not
[26:34] walk there walk an honest Life Walk in a
[26:36] life of Holiness and Purity putting on
[26:39] the armor of God
[26:42] hallelujah so out of these which ones
[26:44] will we be most tempted by probably by
[26:45] strife and envy right right if we're
[26:48] going to be tempted by some of these I I
[26:50] don't think any of you going to get on
[26:51] your riding gear and go out and try to
[26:53] join somebody in Minneapolis or
[26:55] something like that right no no we won't
[26:58] but by God's grace we won't find you
[26:59] down at the bar getting drunk but some
[27:01] of these things do enter in Strife right
[27:06] divisions envying you know wondering why
[27:08] this person has it better than we got
[27:10] it right we all battle I battle we all
[27:13] battle these things right it's Satan's
[27:15] job to fight us amen but we're more than
[27:17] conquerors in Christ Jesus amen we got
[27:20] to have a battle we got if we're going
[27:21] to be Overcomers we got to overcome
[27:22] something
[27:24] Hallelujah and this is the good memory
[27:25] verse I think it was was Eden chose this
[27:27] one or was it virtue but put you on the
[27:30] Lord Jesus Christ remember that memory
[27:31] verse one of the girls it was Eden God
[27:34] bless you Eden this is a memory verse a
[27:36] couple weeks back but put ye on the Lord
[27:38] Jesus Christ don't put on rioting gear
[27:41] don't put on drunkenness sleeping around
[27:44] uh
[27:45] lawlessness uh strife and envying other
[27:47] people put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[27:50] am and don't make a provision don't make
[27:53] a plan for the flesh to be
[27:56] satisfied right
[27:59] to fulfill the lust thereof don't plan
[28:02] it out don't plan out uh fulfilling any
[28:06] lust plan to stay pure amen plan for
[28:10] Purity amen hallelujah plan for the
[28:13] presence of God hallelujah amen let me
[28:16] just share this when I was a sinner and
[28:18] even when I first come in the message
[28:19] when I was a sinner in the message I W
[28:21] uh I would do most of my evil sins when
[28:23] I was locked in a room all by
[28:25] myself right I get out I get out the
[28:29] things that were evil in other words I
[28:30] knew they were evil right but I I I made
[28:33] a plan well this time I'll go do that so
[28:36] like one example when I was a teenager I
[28:38] had really uh bad things and so I'd go
[28:40] in the bathroom I'd been there for a
[28:42] long time and they'd be like come on I
[28:43] got to use the bathroom I'm like um I'm
[28:45] sick or my stomach hurts in order so I
[28:47] could sin like chewing tobacco or other
[28:49] things I'm not going to mention the
[28:50] details but worst
[28:52] details right and
[28:54] see and then even as a Believer you know
[28:57] the same thing too I remember when I
[28:58] first got saved I was still chewing
[29:00] tobacco and cam would be in the room and
[29:01] I tried to hide it like I wasn't chewing
[29:03] cam was a Christian you know I tried to
[29:05] hide it you know I try to do it when
[29:06] nobody was
[29:07] looking you know but here he says don't
[29:10] make provision for it now eventually by
[29:12] God's grace I got strong enough where I
[29:14] didn't do that anymore praise God and
[29:16] haven't for you know over two decades
[29:19] Hallelujah but that that's you know but
[29:21] that that was the characteristics of
[29:23] when I was a sinner or a new Christian I
[29:25] made plans to fulfill the lust thereof
[29:28] but now we should make plans to obey
[29:29] God's word hallelujah amen in other
[29:32] words we should make a plan last time I
[29:33] fell here how am I going to overcome it
[29:35] this time Hallelujah I'm going to pray
[29:37] more this time or I'm going to avoid
[29:39] that or I'm going to turn this off this
[29:41] time or you know we got to make plans
[29:42] for Purity
[29:44] Hallelujah make make make plans for
[29:46] Holiness praise God this is Paul's
[29:49] advice to the Saints in Rome Allelujah
[29:53] they saw the parades they saw the loud
[29:54] music the drunkenness the sleeping
[29:56] around they saw all these things but he
[29:59] said don't put that on put on Jesus
[30:01] Christ hallelujah amen put on the word
[30:04] hallelujah remember he said it back in
[30:06] chapter 10 the word you don't have to go
[30:07] up to heaven to get the word you have to
[30:09] go descend down to get the word he said
[30:11] the word is close to you it's nigh even
[30:13] in thy lips hallelujah amen so other
[30:16] words speak the word of God hallelujah
[30:19] hallelujah I shall not be afraid I shall
[30:21] not be moved amen I shall overcome amen
[30:25] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[30:27] the testimony Hallelujah he is with me
[30:29] Hallelujah he'll never leave me he'll
[30:31] never forsake me
[30:33] hallelujah amen I've always set the Lord
[30:36] before my face as David said
[30:38] Hallelujah the Lord goes before me he's
[30:40] my re reward Hallelujah God is all
[30:43] around me he's the hither to God Amen
[30:46] Hallelujah if he's done it hither to
[30:48] he'll do it the rest of the way
[30:50] Hallelujah call recalling Brother Jim
[30:52] sermon
[30:53] amen put that on so Paul's saying don't
[30:57] put on these carnal things put on the
[30:59] word of God
[31:02] Amen and then of course this is in light
[31:04] of obeying man's commands and here now
[31:06] he starts getting into overcoming um the
[31:10] sin that was around the society that
[31:12] they lived
[31:13] around right I just read it I think of
[31:17] of it now you know even homosexuality
[31:18] was a big thing Nero married a
[31:21] man yeah he married a man and so Nero
[31:23] acted as the woman that's what history
[31:24] says at least the the web page I was
[31:26] reading just aw awful I mean this is
[31:28] such I thought this just like this just
[31:31] like this nation right just like this
[31:34] this this nation because it's the same
[31:35] Roman spirit it's still the legs of iron
[31:38] right we're down at the feet actually
[31:39] we're down at the feet now remember
[31:40] Church don't forget those 10 toes are
[31:43] the 10 tyrants or rulers that raised up
[31:46] during the Great Tribulation remember
[31:47] they give all their power unto the Beast
[31:50] for an hour remember
[31:52] that so I just want to on on that
[31:54] picture of the man remember so we're
[31:56] down here we're right by the feet right
[31:57] we're almost towards we're almost at the
[32:00] Great Tribulation period but we're not
[32:02] there yet right
[32:06] close see just give you idea where we
[32:08] are on that statue right it's from the
[32:10] time of Nebuchadnezzar here we are we're
[32:12] right at the feet my my goodness we're
[32:13] right at the
[32:15] feet it's it's a it's quite a shock here
[32:17] by God's
[32:19] grace so here and this this word was
[32:22] powerful amen this word was powerful
[32:25] enough for them to be arrested and then
[32:28] thrown in the Coliseum and then mocked
[32:31] and then fight animals and lions that's
[32:33] what the history says they were fed to
[32:35] Lions but they had this word amen they
[32:38] had a prophet thus sayith the Lord
[32:41] hallelujah and it was enough to overcome
[32:43] hallelujah praise God what they do they
[32:45] put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen one
[32:48] picture just showed all these Christians
[32:49] huddled around in the Coliseum and
[32:51] they're all just saying their last
[32:52] prayer as the lions come running at him
[32:54] and the Lions just tear him up but the
[32:56] last picture of them is just praying
[32:58] together huddled up like a bunch of
[32:59] lambs
[33:01] Hallelujah bunch of lambs huddled
[33:04] up and what was their testimony their
[33:06] testimony was we're not going to fight
[33:07] back we'll go see Jesus today I'll see
[33:10] Jesus Hallelujah in Paradise amen I'll
[33:13] be with Christ in Paradise Hallelujah
[33:16] now it's not the heart of the earth now
[33:17] it's in heaven
[33:21] Hallelujah chapter 14 verse1
[33:29] him that is weak in faith receive ye but
[33:31] not to doubtful dispensations in other
[33:33] words uh don't argue with them dispute
[33:36] with them so this is an interesting
[33:38] point too my wife and I and I'm sure we
[33:40] talked about it over the
[33:41] years there's always going to be
[33:43] Christians that are stronger than others
[33:46] right that's why you have the wise and
[33:47] foolish virgins there's a scripture in
[33:50] Thessalonians uh it says support the
[33:53] feeble-minded right so that's going to
[33:54] be the wise virsion I'm sorry the
[33:56] foolish virgin is going to be the feeble
[33:57] minded and Paul had it in his church too
[34:01] let's look that up let's go to uh I
[34:03] think it's 1 Thessalonians 5 but I I'll
[34:05] find
[34:06] it support the
[34:08] feeble-minded you're always going to
[34:10] have some Christians uh that
[34:12] are in need of maybe more support yes 1
[34:16] Thessalonians 5:14 there it
[34:22] is or they might be newer Christians or
[34:26] something but again church I've said I
[34:28] believe we have a very mature Church by
[34:30] God's grace because remember the
[34:31] Corinthian Church was suing one another
[34:34] right they had men sleeping with their
[34:38] stepmothers they they would get drunk
[34:40] before
[34:42] communion Hallelujah the church said
[34:46] Paul said remember I always read it for
[34:48] communion eat at home don't come
[34:50] together and get drunk at the Lord's
[34:52] table so so that's why I say by God's
[34:56] grace we're a mature Church Hallelujah
[34:57] we can handle the Deep things of God
[35:00] Amen do we want more of God of course do
[35:02] we need more of God I need way more
[35:03] Hallelujah we need way more but let's be
[35:06] thankful for what we got and reach out
[35:07] in the spirit for more hallelujah
[35:11] amen now uh 1 Thessalonians 5 yes 14 now
[35:15] we exhort you Brethren warn them that
[35:17] are unruly that's why we got to give
[35:19] warnings Comfort the feeble-minded
[35:21] support the weak be patient toward all
[35:23] men now that's faint-hearted Comfort the
[35:25] fainthearted
[35:30] now there's all times when we feel like
[35:31] there's there's times when all of us
[35:32] feel like fainting right like when these
[35:35] things happened to me I feel a thing in
[35:37] my stomach I'm like I feel like I I feel
[35:40] like this is GNA be a hard
[35:42] day I felt better by God's grace after
[35:44] going to the bank today or the the
[35:46] banker today but you know there there's
[35:48] times when we all feel faint like can I
[35:50] how long can I keep battling this how
[35:51] long does this have to go on right and
[35:53] we need God to give us Grace hallelujah
[35:56] amen but now let's look at the context
[35:58] here this is Comfort the
[36:01] fainthearted okay now let's go back to
[36:03] Romans 14 so here now in Romans 14:1 we
[36:06] see people that are weak in faith now
[36:08] Faith remember is Assurance or trust
[36:11] that's what the Greek means there's some
[36:14] people that have a difficult time
[36:15] trusting
[36:17] God right and we know that's what
[36:19] Satan's job is to make us doubt God's
[36:21] word right that's what he did with Eve
[36:22] that's what he did every time he tries
[36:24] to get the Believers to distrust God's
[36:26] word but that's why there's Services
[36:29] Hallelujah that's why there's preaching
[36:30] that's why there're singing amen that's
[36:32] why there's texting and calling your
[36:33] your loved ones amen your Saints
[36:35] Hallelujah that's why there's that we're
[36:37] to encourage one another praise God Amen
[36:39] when we need it so brother Austin you
[36:41] and I need to text each other a lot the
[36:42] next few days okay buddy let's send each
[36:44] other our favorite songs and just let's
[36:45] encourage each other by God's grace
[36:47] we're going to need it we're going to
[36:48] need it by God's I need it we got to do
[36:50] that Hallelujah but him that's weak in
[36:53] faith receive you but not to doubtful
[36:55] dispensation so don't receive people
[36:56] when they just want to dispute and argue
[36:58] we've all seen the difference there's a
[37:00] difference between somebody coming in
[37:02] and accusing somebody but then the the
[37:04] humility the difference is somebody's
[37:06] humble and says you know could you help
[37:07] me understand why this is that and that
[37:09] there's a big
[37:10] difference right so Paul's saying
[37:13] receive the person that's weak in faith
[37:14] or having a hard time I don't understand
[37:16] this could you really really struggle
[37:18] and I love you I really like to
[37:19] understand versus someone who's like oh
[37:22] you're a false you're not a real
[37:23] believer you're a liar you're a you're
[37:25] an impostor you're a Judas you're doing
[37:26] this and that there's a big difference
[37:28] amen
[37:30] hallelujah so he's saying those that are
[37:32] weak in faith receive unless they're in
[37:34] these disputations they're in the
[37:36] accusation mode and I've seen it and I
[37:39] don't like it right but we have to deal
[37:42] with it sometimes verse two for one
[37:43] believeth that he may eat all things
[37:45] another who is weak eateth herbs and now
[37:47] look in Paul's case they were disputing
[37:49] about what Christian should eat well I'm
[37:51] a vegetarian well I I eat both I'm an
[37:54] omnivore you
[37:55] know and this is one of the problems in
[37:58] Rome right you have Jews and you have
[38:00] Gentiles Jews had very strict dietary
[38:03] laws right Gentiles
[38:06] none verse three let him that eateth
[38:09] despise him not I'm sorry despise him
[38:12] that eateth not so let him not despise
[38:15] him and let not him which eateth not
[38:17] judge him that eateth for God hath
[38:19] received
[38:21] him Hallelujah so God received both God
[38:25] receives a vegetarian and God receives a
[38:27] meat
[38:28] eer verse four who art thou that judges
[38:30] another man's servant so now we get down
[38:32] to the bottom of this Paul says the
[38:33] problem here is people judging
[38:35] Christians judging each
[38:37] other right you're not living up to my
[38:39] standard you're not as holy as I am and
[38:42] it's a sinful attitude of judging
[38:44] another man's servant let's remember
[38:47] that we're all God's servants
[38:49] Hallelujah I'm not the boss of
[38:51] everybody I'm not I'm a I'm I'm supposed
[38:54] to be an example I'm not supposed to be
[38:56] the boss I'm an example Hallelujah a
[38:59] minister is supposed to be an example of
[39:00] a servant God help me
[39:03] hallelujah
[39:05] amen who art thou that judges another
[39:07] man's servant to his own Master he
[39:09] standeth or fth yay he shall be Holden
[39:11] up for God is able to make him stand
[39:14] Hallelujah God's going to help you stand
[39:16] Hallelujah God will help this person
[39:17] stand if he's got a different idea than
[39:19] you God will help both of you stand
[39:21] hallelujah we're not in other words
[39:23] we're not to judge and tear people down
[39:25] we're supposed to build people up
[39:26] Hallelujah
[39:27] in these areas of Christian Liberty now
[39:29] he's going to get into some areas mostly
[39:31] food and wine
[39:35] okay food and wine now of course this
[39:38] doesn't impact us very much you know
[39:39] under brother bram's Ministry brother
[39:41] Bram was very strict against drinking
[39:43] wine you know he would only do it in the
[39:45] the communion of the Saints in the
[39:46] church right now there is a liberty Paul
[39:49] says here there is a liberty to drink
[39:50] drink wine but he says do it just
[39:52] amongst yourself do it in your own home
[39:54] and don't cause other people to stumble
[39:56] we'll get to that here towards the end
[39:58] you can do that but be careful you might
[39:59] get
[40:00] drunk right and that would be a real
[40:03] shame right now remember those days were
[40:06] different too they didn't have clean
[40:08] cleaning water units like we got today
[40:11] their main drink was watered down
[40:13] wine right because the water was not
[40:16] clean they could easily get sick if they
[40:18] just drank straight
[40:20] water right that's why Jesus at the
[40:22] wedding that's why uh he he gave them
[40:24] wine he can give them even the best wine
[40:27] and but it it would be the cleanest wine
[40:29] it wouldn't be wine that would make them
[40:30] drunk God who is against drunkenness
[40:33] would not make people
[40:35] drunk It's a cleaned out water and wine
[40:38] mixture
[40:41] Hallelujah God will never contradict
[40:43] himself
[40:44] Hallelujah now oh yeah also we get
[40:47] holidays in here as well or holy days
[40:49] you have that Liberty in there as
[40:52] well verse five one man esteemeth one
[40:54] day above another another esteemeth
[40:56] every day alike
[40:58] let every man be fully persuaded in his
[40:59] own mind
[41:03] Hallelujah so we've tried to preach on
[41:05] that you know especially Christmas is
[41:06] the main example in the message you know
[41:08] uh in brother R's Ministry there's times
[41:10] brother ramam spoke really harsh against
[41:12] certain elements of Christmas but he
[41:13] always celebrated Christmas he gave his
[41:15] children gifts and they had a tree and
[41:17] everything but there's times brother R
[41:18] rakes people around the coals because
[41:20] they were worshiping those things right
[41:22] they talked about Santa Claus they lied
[41:24] to their kids and so if you if you take
[41:26] the balance up it makes perfect sense if
[41:29] you balance it
[41:30] Hallelujah in other words if you
[41:32] celebrate Christmas and all the focus is
[41:34] on Christ and we give gifts uh that that
[41:37] make us remember God's gift to us Jesus
[41:39] Christ there's nothing wrong with that
[41:40] praise God there's also nothing wrong
[41:43] wrong with going well it's December 25th
[41:44] I'm going to treat it like any other day
[41:45] I'm not going to give out gifts there's
[41:47] nothing wrong with that
[41:48] either the main thing is don't cause
[41:51] somebody else to stumble don't lead
[41:53] someone down into a path of
[41:55] sin Hallelujah that's the the main thing
[41:58] we get from the
[41:59] scripture Hallelujah let everybody be
[42:02] fully persuaded his mind isn't that
[42:04] something Paul says Paul says it's okay
[42:05] in a Christian Church that we're fully
[42:07] persuaded on opposite ideas and
[42:10] that that's exactly how it is with
[42:12] Christmas right some people are just
[42:13] fully persuaded I can do it the right
[42:15] way some people are fully persuaded I'm
[42:17] not even going to touch anything of it
[42:19] and Paul says that's
[42:20] okay whatever whatever you're fully
[42:22] persuaded by he said allow just just be
[42:25] persuaded Hallelujah
[42:28] as long as you don't
[42:29] sin
[42:31] amen what a what a message for some Jews
[42:33] and Gentiles amen now you know the Jews
[42:35] all the Jews would think oh it's
[42:37] Passover oh it's first fruits it's it's
[42:39] Pentecost it's Tabernacles we need to
[42:40] have this big Festival right and the
[42:42] Gentiles would be like you don't have to
[42:44] have all that and Paul's like okay let
[42:46] him right because remember even Paul he
[42:49] kept his vow and he went to Jerusalem
[42:50] and shaved his head remember when he
[42:51] kept The Vow there in the book of Acts
[42:54] and Paul's the one saying you can do
[42:55] that or not either way just be fully
[42:58] persuaded in your mind just love God
[43:00] because love fulfills all the law
[43:02] Hallelujah just don't judge others don't
[43:04] just don't exalt yourself be humble
[43:06] Hallelujah there it is
[43:09] amen don't judge another man's
[43:12] servant we're all Servants of God
[43:14] hallelujah we're not to be judges over
[43:16] others we're to be servants and
[43:18] encouragers of others
[43:22] Hallelujah now verse six he that
[43:24] regardeth the day regardeth it unto the
[43:25] Lord and He that regardeth not not the
[43:27] day to the Lord he doth not regard it he
[43:29] that eateth eateth to the Lord for he
[43:31] giveth God thanks and he that eateth not
[43:33] to the Lord he giveth I'm sorry he
[43:35] eateth not and giveth God thanks either
[43:37] way God gets
[43:38] thanked right how many thank God on
[43:40] Christmas right if if you're doing
[43:43] Christmas how many thank God on December
[43:45] 25th even if you're not doing Christmas
[43:46] right amen either way we thank God for a
[43:49] day hallelujah thank God for a life and
[43:51] health and All His blessings Hallelujah
[43:54] we give it all to the Lord so whether
[43:57] you eat meat or don't eat meat give
[43:59] thanks to God all time so the main idea
[44:01] is give thanks love one another do not
[44:04] judge one another encourage one another
[44:06] we see the mind of Christ here
[44:08] hallelujah verse seven for none of us
[44:11] liveth to himself and no man dieth to
[44:15] himself Hallelujah ain't that beautiful
[44:18] we all live and die to Christ how many
[44:21] living for Christ here hallelujah how
[44:23] many when you die if Lord willing if we
[44:25] die how many will die for Christ die to
[44:27] Christ Hallelujah we'll go to meet him
[44:29] Hallelujah that's why I'm living
[44:31] hallelujah we're all doing this for God
[44:33] whether we celebrate the holy day or not
[44:35] whether we eat meat or not whether we
[44:37] drink wine or not we're all doing it for
[44:40] God's Glory
[44:41] Hallelujah verse eight for whether we
[44:44] live we live unto the Lord whether we
[44:46] die we die unto the Lord whether we live
[44:48] therefore or die we are the Lords
[44:51] amen that's why Paul said for me to live
[44:54] is Christ to die it is gain Hallelujah
[44:57] cuz he gained Christ hallelujah amen
[45:00] Paul said when we're absent from the
[45:01] body we're present with the Lord
[45:03] hallelujah amen second Corinthians
[45:05] chapter
[45:06] 5 verse n for to this end Christ both
[45:10] died and Rose and revived see there's a
[45:12] one of the six kinds of Revival right as
[45:14] a resurrection that he might be Lord
[45:16] both of the dead and the living this is
[45:19] the very effect of the death and
[45:21] resurrection of Christ that he paid the
[45:23] price for everyone's sins sinner or
[45:26] Saint so he he redeemed all those people
[45:28] right and then they can choose they can
[45:31] accept his grace and be redeemed in
[45:33] their soul but he purchased their souls
[45:35] amen with his own blood Hallelujah and
[45:38] so all men have to come all men have to
[45:40] come and and bow before Christ and
[45:42] recognize that he purchased them amen
[45:45] and the Bible says you're bought with
[45:46] the price the precious blood of Jesus
[45:49] hallelujah
[45:51] amen verse 10 but why Dost thou judge
[45:54] thy brother so see there were some judg
[45:56] Jud going on the
[45:58] church right and I'm talking about
[46:00] sinful judging brother you're on the way
[46:02] you're brother you're on the way to hell
[46:04] you're not even a brother anymore you
[46:05] might be serpent seed sister you're a
[46:07] serpent seed because you eat meat or
[46:09] don't eat meat or you don't celebrate
[46:11] Passover or do celebrate Passover
[46:15] Hallelujah there's too much judging
[46:17] going
[46:18] on right why and so he says why do you
[46:20] judge them why Dost thou said it not thy
[46:22] brother for we shall all stand before
[46:25] the Judgment seat of Christ
[46:27] amen so see some people in the church
[46:29] were acting like they were judges but
[46:30] Paul says hey don't don't don't get
[46:32] caught up on that because you going to
[46:33] be judged
[46:34] too we've all got to stand before the
[46:37] Judgment seat of Christ I tell you that
[46:39] that that's a fearful thing sometimes
[46:42] you think about that I'm going to stand
[46:43] before Christ and the Bible said I'll
[46:45] give an account of what I've done in my
[46:48] life now church sometimes I have a hard
[46:50] time remember what I did yesterday if I
[46:53] had to give an account to Malachi what I
[46:54] did yesterday i' have to go look on my
[46:56] phone
[46:57] right what what did I have on the
[46:58] schedule
[46:59] yesterday but there some somehow when we
[47:01] when we when we come to the presence of
[47:03] Christ we'll be able to give account
[47:05] whether good or bad of our
[47:07] lives so we want to have given a good
[47:09] account hallelujah
[47:11] amen so the way to do that is not judge
[47:14] other
[47:15] people right serve God don't Lord over
[47:18] other people serve God do the best you
[47:21] can be fully persuaded that what you're
[47:22] doing is the word of
[47:24] God this is the way this is the way that
[47:27] we'll have a good conscience and when we
[47:29] give account of Our Lives to Christ
[47:31] we'll know we're doing it with all
[47:32] honesty Hallelujah and we know he'll
[47:35] receive us because he looks at our heart
[47:37] he Sayes does this person have the love
[47:39] of God or not are they trying to do good
[47:41] for everybody or they trying to do ill
[47:43] will towards other people
[47:48] hallelujah I love this verse 11 for it
[47:51] is written as I live sayith the Lord
[47:52] every knee shall bow to me and every
[47:54] tongue confess shall confess to God
[47:58] hallelujah every knee shall bow every
[48:00] tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
[48:03] Lord of of course we know we better bow
[48:06] our knees right now Hallelujah that's
[48:07] why Paul said I bow my knees to the God
[48:09] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ we
[48:11] bow now Hallelujah we worship now amen
[48:14] we confess him now praise
[48:16] God because we know if we don't we'll be
[48:19] forced to do it there we don't want to
[48:21] be forced to do at the white Throne
[48:23] judgment we want to do it now while
[48:24] we're alive hallelujah amen amen verse
[48:27] 12 so then every one of us shall give an
[48:30] account of himself before
[48:33] God now let's just review this one CA
[48:36] can you put up Luke 1233 real quick just
[48:40] a reminder
[48:46] here just a
[48:48] reminder you know one thing in America
[48:50] we have to give account of is our
[48:52] finances just a reminder now Jesus
[48:56] plainly tells us how to get treasure in
[48:59] heaven sell that you have and give alms
[49:01] provide yourselves bags which wax not
[49:04] old a treasure in the heavens that
[49:05] faileth not where no Thief approaches
[49:08] neither moth corrupt so other words
[49:10] giving God loves a cheerful
[49:13] Giver Hallelujah so Jesus plainly tells
[49:16] us when we give to others that can't pay
[49:18] us
[49:19] back that Soares up a treasure in heaven
[49:22] and that will not fail
[49:24] hallelujah amen
[49:27] so we want that we want to have that in
[49:29] our account in heaven
[49:31] Hallelujah right we want to have it
[49:33] recorded because we're in a given an
[49:35] account the Lord will say what' you do
[49:36] with your money what' you do with your
[49:38] time may we saw it on on uh we saw it on
[49:40] Sunday I gave you these talents I gave
[49:42] you this money what' you invested
[49:45] in right I gave you the ability uh to
[49:47] have words of wisdom or words of
[49:49] knowledge right all the nine gifts of
[49:51] the holy spirit I gave you ability to
[49:53] preach I gave you the ability to sing or
[49:56] Gifts of healing I gave you these gifts
[49:57] what' you do with them oh God we got to
[49:59] give an account
[50:00] hallelujah
[50:02] amen oh it's it's a striking thing so
[50:06] Paul says don't judge others in these
[50:08] areas of Liberty because you're all
[50:09] going to stand before Christ and give an
[50:11] account of what you did in the
[50:14] body this is a sobering
[50:17] chapter every one of us will give an
[50:19] account of himself before God pull uh
[50:22] Matthew uh 25 19 and 20 of course this
[50:25] is the parable that
[50:27] uh the talents as we mentioned on uh
[50:29] Sunday after a long time the Lord of
[50:31] those servants cometh and reckon with
[50:33] them so here's where Jesus is going to
[50:35] reckon with us what' you do with what I
[50:37] gave you here's the
[50:39] account now look look at the confidence
[50:42] of this man and so he that received five
[50:45] talents came and brought the other five
[50:46] saying Lord thou deliver me unto me five
[50:49] talents and behold I've gained beside
[50:51] them five talents more here's a man
[50:53] that's ready to give his account
[50:55] hallelujah amen
[50:57] in other words what I'm saying there's
[50:59] 45 minutes I'll try to finish up here
[51:01] what I'm saying is we should have some
[51:02] idea what do we do with our
[51:05] money right how much did we give to the
[51:08] poor right how much did we invest in our
[51:11] gifts in our lives what did we do what
[51:13] what do we try to do for God
[51:15] hallelujah we should have an idea of
[51:18] what we gave to God because we're going
[51:20] to give an
[51:22] account Hallelujah
[51:26] this is also related of course
[51:28] accountability that's where we get the
[51:29] word from right
[51:32] accountability how many like
[51:37] accountability
[51:38] right accountability somebody gives you
[51:40] something well I'm gonna come back and
[51:42] get it or I'm let you borrow this
[51:44] they're going to come back and get it
[51:45] aren't they you're going to be
[51:46] accountable what' you do with this right
[51:49] uh like oh I let my neighbor borrow my
[51:52] lawnmower well there's accountability
[51:53] what do you do with my
[51:54] lawnmower right what did I do with his
[51:57] lawm more what did I do with his ladder
[51:58] he let me borrow his ladder what do I do
[52:00] with it I got I got to be accountable
[52:01] for it I want to say I used it and here
[52:04] it is it's in better condition than when
[52:05] you gave it to me right like if we ever
[52:08] move out of this place we'll have to
[52:10] give an account now if the Lord terries
[52:12] right and and even the landlord has
[52:14] already said you guys have made this way
[52:16] more beautiful than it was you've uh so
[52:19] we we have the we we have the the
[52:21] account we've we've we've invested in
[52:23] this and this is better off because we
[52:25] were here praise God
[52:27] that's just the natural amen what about
[52:29] spiritual we should try to make people's
[52:30] lives better spiritually because they
[52:32] were in contact with us
[52:35] hallelujah
[52:39] amen
[52:41] hallelujah let verse 13 let us not
[52:44] therefore judge one another anymore so
[52:46] he says stop all this judging now talk
[52:47] about a church right there talk about a
[52:50] church where people were judging
[52:52] others oh you're you're condemned
[52:54] because you ate that you're condemned
[52:55] because you drank that you're condemned
[52:57] because you you didn't worship on the
[52:58] day like I
[53:00] did they're judging each other Paul says
[53:03] let's not judge anymore stop
[53:06] judging he says but judge this so here
[53:09] here's here's something you can judge
[53:11] each other
[53:12] on here's where you can go around and
[53:14] and judge each other that no man put a
[53:17] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[53:20] in his brother's way that's how you
[53:22] should judge each other in other words
[53:24] go I go to Brother house brother have I
[53:26] called caus you to stumble in
[53:27] anything right sister Zur have I caused
[53:30] you to
[53:31] stumble sister n me have I caused you to
[53:33] stumble Casa have I caused you to
[53:35] stumble that's the judging God wants us
[53:37] to do hallelujah amen to live so pure
[53:40] before each other that we don't condemn
[53:42] each other but we go and say judge me
[53:45] right uh let me know have I caused you
[53:47] to stumble this is the kind of church
[53:49] God wants Hallelujah I believe it's what
[53:51] we got Hallelujah by God's grace I'm
[53:54] just so you know I'm not blasting the
[53:55] church tonight I'm just I'm letting you
[53:56] know what the gospel says right and
[53:58] we've lived it by God's grace amen
[54:01] hallelujah we've lived
[54:07] it so let us judge that I'm not going to
[54:11] cause somebody to stumble now the
[54:14] obvious example I've named this one
[54:15] about a thousand times in the last few
[54:17] few few weeks Peter in Galatians Chapter
[54:19] 2 everybody think everybody remember
[54:21] that stumbling
[54:22] block he he told Barnabas and these
[54:25] other Jews we're not going to eat with
[54:26] the Gentiles because I fear these other
[54:29] Jewish teachers and he taught the church
[54:31] to separate
[54:33] themselves what he do he caused them to
[54:35] stumble over what
[54:38] food just like Paul said amen Holiness
[54:42] we're more holy because we're Jews and
[54:44] we have the 613 laws and we have all
[54:46] this background information on Moses's
[54:48] law but Peter put a stumbling block in
[54:52] the people's way and caus them to
[54:54] stumble but we know by history of course
[54:56] he repented but it took a prophet to
[54:58] walk up and put his finger under his
[55:00] nose in front of everybody said you're
[55:01] the one to be blamed now could we accept
[55:04] that kind of rebuke if God did that to
[55:05] us that take a real man of God but you
[55:08] know Peter was used to it Peter was
[55:10] humble he was a humble man Hallelujah
[55:12] because he'd been
[55:14] humbled right he said Lord I'll never
[55:16] leave you I'll die with you and within a
[55:17] few hours he denied him three times and
[55:19] he wept his he bitterly wept after the
[55:22] the cck crowed Hallelujah he bitterly
[55:25] wept and then Jesus Jus asked him do you
[55:27] love me Peter do you love me more than
[55:29] these do you love me he said thou
[55:31] knowest he said feed my sheep preach the
[55:33] word of God be an example be a servant
[55:36] serve God's sheep
[55:38] Hallelujah so if he could accept that
[55:40] rebuke from Jesus surely he could accept
[55:42] it from Paul
[55:44] Hallelujah so that's the only judging we
[55:46] should do in here judge ourselves
[55:48] brother amen have I offended you in any
[55:50] way brother that's that's how we should
[55:52] judge each other Hallelujah let's have
[55:55] that kind of judgment amen
[55:58] be so pure think about that we'd be so
[56:00] pure that we could s go up to one
[56:01] another after service and say you know
[56:02] brother brother Malachi did I you know
[56:05] did did I offend you in any way that's
[56:08] Purity right that's that's trying to get
[56:10] others to be encouraged not to cause
[56:12] them to
[56:15] stumble
[56:18] Hallelujah now there's certain stumbling
[56:20] that we won't do the Bible said let the
[56:22] blind lead the blind Jesus said that
[56:24] there's certain stumbling they'll do
[56:26] but Paul's talking about stumbling in
[56:28] the Christian church between wise and
[56:29] foolish virgins and no doubt how how
[56:31] many believe uh Peter was a wise virgin
[56:34] if anybody was a wise virgin he had the
[56:37] Holy Ghost he's a spokesman on the day
[56:38] of Pentecost he had the keys to the
[56:40] kingdom he opened the door to the Jews
[56:42] Samaritans and the Gentiles in
[56:43] cornelius's house all three human groups
[56:46] he opened them up to but then he
[56:48] stumbled here in Galatians Chapter 2 was
[56:51] God done with him did God throw him away
[56:52] no sir Hallelujah he's one of those he's
[56:55] one of those elders ERS on the 24
[56:57] Thrones in heaven Hallelujah the four
[57:00] and 20 Elders amen the 12 apostles and
[57:03] then of course not Judas somebody took
[57:05] his place either Paul or Mias and you
[57:06] have the 12 sons of Jacob amen he's
[57:08] still one of those amen he still
[57:10] surrounds the Throne of God hallelujah
[57:13] am that's amazing grace amen that's the
[57:16] kind of Grace I believe in right
[57:19] there thank you Jesus amen if I call
[57:22] somebody to stumble I know there's Grace
[57:24] to forgive me hallelujah amen amen if I
[57:26] seek it and if I Repent just like Peter
[57:29] did
[57:36] hallelujah what a scripture my so this
[57:39] is what we got to judge Lord help me not
[57:42] to cause somebody to
[57:44] stumble verse 14 I know and am persuaded
[57:48] by the Lord Jesus that there's nothing
[57:49] unclean of itself but to him that is
[57:51] seeth anything to be unclean to him it's
[57:53] unclean now he's going back to Food and
[57:54] Wine but If thy brother be griev with
[57:57] thy
[57:58] meat now walst thou not charitably
[58:02] destroy not him with thy meat for whom
[58:04] Christ dith okay so Paul Paul must have
[58:07] heard about somebody in the church a
[58:09] young Christian saw a more mature
[58:11] Christian eating meat and that meat was
[58:13] probably sold in the market by a sinner
[58:16] who had sacrificed that animal to their
[58:18] Idol that's what this context
[58:21] is Right Wendy Wendy talked about that
[58:23] you know she'd seen in her country and
[58:26] and things she'd seen where the they
[58:28] they lay the meat before their Idols the
[58:30] Hindu and all kinds of Idols that they
[58:32] have and then they would eat that people
[58:33] would have parties there in Hong Kong
[58:35] and they actually sacrificed for uh
[58:38] their gods like that was something she
[58:40] saw she witnessed it okay but here Paul
[58:43] sees it in
[58:45] Rome and he says if a Christian can buy
[58:47] the meat and it doesn't matter it
[58:48] doesn't cause him to stumble it's just
[58:50] meat I don't worship those Gods it's
[58:51] just a piece it's just a slab of
[58:53] meat but if a young Christian looks at
[58:55] that says he's eating meat to a
[58:57] sacrifice Idol and Paul says don't eat
[59:00] it right care about your brother if you
[59:02] do something that Grieves somebody and
[59:04] they get weaker he said leave it alone
[59:07] and don't do it
[59:09] Hallelujah now you again you'll know the
[59:11] difference between somebody who's an
[59:12] accuser a critical spirit versus
[59:14] somebody who's just weak in faith or
[59:17] faint-hearted and the church said you
[59:20] can always tell the accusers is always
[59:22] prideful and uh they're not humble but
[59:26] per someone who's weak in faith or
[59:27] fainthearted they're
[59:29] humble they're still
[59:33] loving
[59:35] right
[59:38] Hallelujah destroy not him with that
[59:40] meat whom Christ died Hallelujah for
[59:43] whom Christ died verse 16 let not then
[59:45] your good be evil spoken of for the
[59:46] kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but
[59:48] righteousness peace and joy and the Holy
[59:50] Ghost so Paul says both sides right you
[59:53] can look at both sides right don't
[59:55] destroy somebody but also don't let your
[59:57] good be evil spoken of so you have a
[59:59] right if you're the one eating meat you
[1:00:00] have a right to say brother this doesn't
[1:00:02] offend me I pray over this I got Paul's
[1:00:04] other letter that says I give
[1:00:06] Thanksgiving for this amen every
[1:00:08] creature of God is to be received with
[1:00:11] Thanksgiving but then a mature Christian
[1:00:13] he goes on to say a mature Christian
[1:00:15] won't do it in front of the the younger
[1:00:17] Christian right that's what this is all
[1:00:20] about keeping your brother strong
[1:00:23] keeping your sister
[1:00:24] strong right
[1:00:27] so you got to right in verse 16 you got
[1:00:28] to right to stand up and say you know
[1:00:29] this brother sister I'm sorry this
[1:00:31] Grieves you but this doesn't grieve me I
[1:00:33] understand it God made the meat right
[1:00:35] the meat doesn't defile a man it's what
[1:00:37] comes out of a heart that defiles a
[1:00:40] man right but if this hurt you I'm not
[1:00:42] going to do
[1:00:44] it verse 17 for the kingdom of God is
[1:00:47] not in meat and drink but righteousness
[1:00:49] and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:00:50] hallelujah amen all three of those amen
[1:00:53] I love that what a what a trio
[1:00:54] hallelujah it's like faith hope and
[1:00:56] charity Hallelujah but it's a it's a
[1:00:58] Rome a Rome version Hallelujah he he
[1:01:01] told the Corinthians faith hope and
[1:01:03] charity here he says righteousness peace
[1:01:05] and joy and the Holy Ghost amen I like
[1:01:08] that for he that is that in these things
[1:01:10] serveth Christ is acceptable to God and
[1:01:12] approved of men so this is now called
[1:01:15] serving Christ when you keep yourself
[1:01:18] from doing something you'd like to do
[1:01:19] but you you do it just to help out your
[1:01:21] brother now that's called serving Christ
[1:01:27] so when I have to sacrifice just so I
[1:01:29] don't cause my brother or sister to
[1:01:30] stumble that's a Ser that's a servant's
[1:01:32] heart right
[1:01:33] there right now I'm now I'm serving
[1:01:36] Christ and as you'll see in the next
[1:01:38] chapter that's what Christ did Christ
[1:01:41] forsook everything in order to serve us
[1:01:43] he had a right to be married he had a
[1:01:44] right to live long he had all these
[1:01:46] rights but he forsook all of his rights
[1:01:48] that he might serve us hallelujah and so
[1:01:51] we must follow his
[1:01:53] example praise God
[1:01:58] Glory verse
[1:02:00] 19 let us therefore follow after the
[1:02:03] things which make for peace the things
[1:02:04] wherewith one may edify one another so
[1:02:06] see it's all about building each other
[1:02:08] up not grieving or offending others but
[1:02:10] building them
[1:02:11] up verse 20 for meat destroy not the
[1:02:14] work of God see meat eating meat's not
[1:02:16] going to destroy the kingdom of God all
[1:02:18] things indeed are pure but it's evil for
[1:02:21] that man who eateth with offense so if
[1:02:23] that man who eats meat he knows about
[1:02:26] this offense and if he still eats it
[1:02:27] says I don't care what that baby
[1:02:29] Christian says then that's an offense to
[1:02:32] Christ all
[1:02:34] right I'm trying to think of a way it
[1:02:36] applies to us you know I guess the
[1:02:38] closest one is probably Christmas right
[1:02:42] I can't really think of any others that
[1:02:43] would be like a real controversial thing
[1:02:47] I can't think can you think of any
[1:02:48] brother amen what are some Christian
[1:02:50] Liberties I yeah I think with you know
[1:02:53] women's clothing Sometimes some people
[1:02:55] go really far on that like we talked
[1:02:56] about with the toes showing toes and uh
[1:02:58] wearing jean skirts and things like that
[1:03:00] that would probably be something later
[1:03:01] but we don't have any we don't have any
[1:03:03] interactions with that we just hear
[1:03:04] about
[1:03:05] that all
[1:03:08] right now
[1:03:10] verse 20 for meat destroy not the work
[1:03:13] of God all things endured to are pure
[1:03:15] but it's evil for that man who e with
[1:03:16] offense so if we offending somebody and
[1:03:18] we still we know we're offending them
[1:03:20] and we still do it it's evil that's evil
[1:03:23] verse 21 it is good neither to eat flesh
[1:03:25] nor drink wine nor anything whereby thy
[1:03:28] brother stumbleth or is offended or is
[1:03:31] made weak Hallelujah so everything we
[1:03:33] should do should edify other people
[1:03:36] should encourage other
[1:03:38] people
[1:03:40] amen verse 22 hast thou faith faith have
[1:03:43] it to thyself before God so now let's go
[1:03:45] back to the meat and the wine and
[1:03:47] everything else if you do that just do
[1:03:49] it with you and God in the privacy of
[1:03:51] your
[1:03:52] home right something's going to cause
[1:03:55] you to stumble
[1:03:56] just do it in the privacy of your
[1:04:00] home so I guess how it may apply to
[1:04:02] Christmas if I know somebody doesn't
[1:04:03] worship or was doesn't celebrate
[1:04:05] Christmas I'm not going to go in there
[1:04:06] in church and give them Christmas gifts
[1:04:09] all right maybe that's one a good
[1:04:10] example I'm not going to go in there and
[1:04:12] say Merry Christmas Merry Christmas I'm
[1:04:14] just going to be careful what I say
[1:04:16] around them if they don't want to
[1:04:16] celebrate Christmas Yeah Christmas cards
[1:04:19] got to watch everything no gift cards
[1:04:21] you know don't give anything don't talk
[1:04:23] about it just have peace just edify them
[1:04:25] oh a wonderful service and praise God
[1:04:27] hope you enjoy the weekend and have a
[1:04:28] wonderful week in the Lord I've been
[1:04:29] thinking about you you know just keep
[1:04:32] everything off of something that might
[1:04:33] cause somebody to
[1:04:38] stumble
[1:04:39] Hallelujah uh verse 20 oh yeah we are 22
[1:04:43] okay finish up 23 and he that douth is
[1:04:45] damned if he eats because he eateth not
[1:04:49] of faith for whatsoever not of faith is
[1:04:52] sin what a great rule that is for us
[1:04:56] right that's a good uh that's a good
[1:04:58] scripture we should use for all of our
[1:05:00] lives do I re and and I've said it
[1:05:02] before but if there's a question about
[1:05:04] it we want to leave it alone until we're
[1:05:07] sure right because we have any doubt in
[1:05:09] our mind the Bible said it's sin I'm not
[1:05:12] sure if this is right or this is wrong
[1:05:14] now one area that's been uh working on
[1:05:17] me the last few years is with music
[1:05:19] that's why I preached on it I wonder
[1:05:21] brother awesome I thought is this right
[1:05:22] or wrong to listen to this amen I
[1:05:24] thought should I listen to this or not
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] but God's giv me Grace now where I can
[1:05:28] understand like I've told Malachi we can
[1:05:30] listen to some songs but if we played it
[1:05:33] like that in the church it wouldn't be
[1:05:35] right right in the church we just want
[1:05:37] everything as holy as it can possibly be
[1:05:40] in other words if anything's kind in the
[1:05:42] middle we're not even going to do that
[1:05:43] it like that in the church we're just
[1:05:44] going to keep it totally clean
[1:05:46] Hallelujah right because there that
[1:05:48] there's another one I just thought music
[1:05:49] is an area of Liberty too that's right
[1:05:51] amen all right see that just comes as
[1:05:53] I'm preaching but I'm going to close I'm
[1:05:54] not going to keep going okay I'm not
[1:05:56] going to catch the Revelation now and go
[1:05:57] with it but you you understand there's
[1:06:00] areas of Liberty now jewry one I wrote
[1:06:02] that book where's my book I just go
[1:06:04] through the areas of Liberty like with
[1:06:05] rings you know Joseph and morai had
[1:06:07] rings on and there are these people that
[1:06:09] say Christians shouldn't wear Rings well
[1:06:10] then you're condemning morai and Joseph
[1:06:12] for wearing rings it goes back to your
[1:06:15] why are you doing it what's your
[1:06:17] objective what's your motive behind it
[1:06:20] like even that scripture about plating
[1:06:21] the Hair Braiding the hair you you'd be
[1:06:23] surprised how many people from Africa
[1:06:24] email me about that it's honest question
[1:06:27] but you have to look at the context I
[1:06:29] mean anyone looks like looks at a girl
[1:06:31] like a let's say a 10-year-old girl with
[1:06:32] a braid at nighttime you know that's not
[1:06:35] sinful like you just have the common
[1:06:37] sense she just don't want her hair
[1:06:38] getting all tangled up at night I mean
[1:06:41] right but if you look at the context
[1:06:43] he's talking about people that are
[1:06:44] spending lavishly on gold and and costly
[1:06:47] array in other words spending a lot of
[1:06:50] money on fancy worldly hairstyles
[1:06:52] wasting
[1:06:53] money that's the context a braid is not
[1:06:56] a
[1:06:57] sin right it's an area of
[1:07:00] Liberty if you I mean any Common Sense
[1:07:03] the reason people condemn it is because
[1:07:05] the uh it's Pro it's probably men that
[1:07:07] don't have long hair that doesn't get
[1:07:08] messed up at night time you don't get
[1:07:09] all entangled and everything like that
[1:07:11] they have to do that the girls have to
[1:07:13] do that in order to keep their hair from
[1:07:15] breaking and tangling and everything so
[1:07:17] it's these areas of Liberty that we have
[1:07:19] to have even Joseph had a necklace the
[1:07:21] Bible said Pharaoh gave him a necklace
[1:07:23] well if you condemn necklaces on men
[1:07:25] then Joseph is
[1:07:26] condemned if there's a purpose for it
[1:07:29] there's got to be a purpose for it
[1:07:31] Hallelujah a Godly purpose amen right
[1:07:34] all these areas and so God gives us this
[1:07:37] final word here at this chapter for
[1:07:39] whatsoever is Faith is not I'm sorry
[1:07:41] whatsoever is not a faith is sin so
[1:07:44] let's make sure all of our decisions are
[1:07:46] rooted and grounded in our faith our
[1:07:48] Revelation and we do everything we can
[1:07:51] to edify one another and not to judge
[1:07:53] one another musicians can come let's
[1:07:55] stand to our feet here praise God how
[1:07:56] many enjoy the word of God tonight amen
[1:07:59] amen good scriptures like I said I felt
[1:08:01] like we've been a mature Church we've we
[1:08:03] haven't judged one another we haven't
[1:08:06] done some of these things like the
[1:08:07] Corinthians did by the grace of God
[1:08:10] that's how I know we're a mature Church
[1:08:11] Hallelujah we look at the word of God we
[1:08:14] live the word of
[1:08:17] God another good example is that flat
[1:08:19] top haircut you know I preached on that
[1:08:20] a few weeks ago 10 times brother Ram
[1:08:24] said oh they got their flat top hair
[1:08:25] haircuts then they ask him brother
[1:08:27] Brandon is a flat top haircut wrong he
[1:08:28] said no he said I just say that he said
[1:08:31] there's no scripture against a flat top
[1:08:33] he said brother you live as you live to
[1:08:35] be 56 like me you'll have a flat top
[1:08:37] you'll have no hair I love that
[1:08:40] joke you'll have a flat to all your hair
[1:08:43] is GNA fall
[1:08:44] out
[1:08:46] Hallelujah so Church what does it take
[1:08:48] it takes the love of Christ how many
[1:08:51] want more love in their lives how many
[1:08:53] want to wake up from any Slumber
[1:08:54] Hallelujah and just be alert with the
[1:08:56] full armor of God what what amazing
[1:08:58] chapters these are how they apply to us
[1:09:02] as persecution was coming on in four
[1:09:04] years now think about that at some point
[1:09:07] there's going to be a number of years
[1:09:09] before the persecution hits the us we're
[1:09:11] starting to see it where they're like I
[1:09:13] said they're putting them they're doing
[1:09:15] kangaroo courts is what they're doing
[1:09:16] against their political
[1:09:19] enemies we're starting to get there and
[1:09:21] so God help us to recognize what time it
[1:09:24] is hallelujah put on the armor of God
[1:09:27] let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:09:28] prayer father God we thank you for
[1:09:30] tonight Lord God we thank you for the
[1:09:31] word of God what a beautiful chapter
[1:09:33] you've given us through St Paul Lord as
[1:09:36] Peter said holy men of old were moved by
[1:09:38] the Holy Ghost hallelujah thank you
[1:09:41] God for moving your men to write the
[1:09:44] word of God and give us these wonderful
[1:09:46] Revelations I thank you Lord for the
[1:09:48] kingdom of God in our church it's
[1:09:50] righteousness joy and peace Lord I
[1:09:53] preached it last year that we've had
[1:09:55] this wonderful season of Peace since
[1:09:56] 2018 Lord
[1:09:58] God hallelujah six wonderful years Lord
[1:10:02] of
[1:10:02] Peace haven't had to deal with the
[1:10:04] critical Spirits Lord we thank you for
[1:10:07] that God thank you for your mercy and
[1:10:08] Grace Lord and that's what we've been
[1:10:10] trying to we've been trying to edify one
[1:10:11] another here Lord God
[1:10:14] yes Lord may we do like Paul said judge
[1:10:17] this may we
[1:10:19] judge whether we're causing people to
[1:10:21] stumble or building them up Lord God let
[1:10:23] us judge ourselves as Jesus said judge
[1:10:27] yourselves lest you be
[1:10:30] judged
[1:10:34] Hallelujah Lord I look at our church and
[1:10:36] I don't see in my perspective I don't
[1:10:39] see people causing others to stumble
[1:10:41] Lord
[1:10:44] God so Lord our desire tonight Lord is
[1:10:47] to always have faith in everything that
[1:10:48] we allow in our lives these areas of
[1:10:51] Liberty Lord
[1:10:53] God lord you receive someone who eats
[1:10:55] meat you receive someone who doesn't you
[1:10:58] receive one who celebrates certain
[1:10:59] elements of Christmas like brother
[1:11:01] brandom and you receive those who
[1:11:03] don't you receive them Lord God you just
[1:11:07] want them fully persuaded
[1:11:09] hallelujah thank you
