[31:22] Sunday so we're looking forward to

[31:29] know I know I said it earlier but to the
[31:30] working moms you know children even
[31:33] working with just work in
[31:34] general we'll talk about what time we

[31:41] here 5:30 everybody can eat you know so
[31:44] we'll just talk about that see how that
[31:46] works out by God's
[31:49] grace forward to those meetings
[31:55] there acts 241 one the supernatural book
[31:58] of Acts Church part
[32:01] two I think as we preach on the book of
[32:03] Acts it just becomes more real to me it
[32:05] becomes more obvious that we are a
[32:07] continuation of the book of Acts just
[32:09] like brother brandom said we're not a
[32:11] different church we are the same church
[32:13] praise God Acts 2 verse
[32:16] 41 remember in the body of Christ
[32:19] there's members in particular every
[32:21] member uh plays a particular part every
[32:24] member might have a different sort of
[32:25] gift a different type of min there like
[32:27] the Bible says there are different kinds
[32:29] of healings there's not just one kind of
[32:30] healing there's numerous kinds of
[32:32] healings well that means there's
[32:33] numerous kinds of each and every gift
[32:35] and so we want to thank God for the
[32:37] gifts Hallelujah we want to be more
[32:39] dedicated for the gifts praise God
[32:41] that's why we're here that's why we come
[32:42] that's why we keep serving God all the
[32:44] time we want to learn to be more
[32:45] dedicated to Jesus Hallelujah acts
[32:50] 241 I just thought I would
[32:52] uh kind of start here and then we'll go
[32:55] into Acts chapter 3 here tonight I just
[32:57] want to hit some highlights here by
[32:59] God's grace acts
[33:01] 241 we'll read just 41 together okay and
[33:04] then I'll read
[33:06] uh 42 and 43 myself so let's read 41 one
[33:11] two three then they that gladly received
[33:14] his word were baptized and the same day
[33:17] there were added unto them about 3,000
[33:21] Souls 3,000 baptisms or at least people
[33:25] saved that Day verse 42 I'll this myself
[33:28] and what they do once they got saved did
[33:29] they go crawl back to their uh Pharisee
[33:31] religion or sadducee religion no they
[33:34] continued
[33:35] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and
[33:37] fellowship and in Breaking of bread and
[33:40] in prayers that's when you know you had
[33:41] a real conversion you know when you
[33:43] leave your old religious system and you
[33:45] join the real group that has life so we
[33:49] see those that may fall away just proves
[33:51] you know either they had something
[33:52] genuine like that Third Kind of ground
[33:54] you know they had something I'm sorry
[33:56] the second kind of ground sprang up
[33:57] quickly but they had no real Roots right
[34:00] they had a what the Bible said a Stony
[34:02] heart they didn't really have it verse
[34:06] 43 and fear Came Upon every soul and
[34:08] Many Wonders and signs were done by the
[34:10] apostles let's have one more word of
[34:12] prayer here Heavenly Father we thank you
[34:13] again for tonight bless us as we look to
[34:15] your word just anoint me Lord let it be
[34:17] inspiration to me and your people I know

[34:23] ministered by the Holy Spirit we need
[34:24] you Lord we need a real move of God H in
[34:27] our lives we need something real Lord

[34:39] real here tonight we pray in Jesus
[34:41] Christ's name Saints said amen God bless
[34:43] you as you're being
[34:48] seated I'm G to try to watch your time
[34:51] again I was telling sister Lena and AAA
[34:54] that I got another night tomorrow night
[34:57] so I'm going try to really watch the
[34:58] time and if you see me go out fast
[35:00] tonight it's not because I don't want to
[35:01] Fellowship it's I got a long day
[35:02] tomorrow and if I uh don't get good
[35:05] sleep then I'll get I probably get sick
[35:07] or something like that just using wisdom
[35:10] and I just got two more nights like that
[35:11] you know so I've only got two more so
[35:13] and then we'll be all set then I can
[35:14] hang around and fellowship a little more
[35:16] by God's
[35:17] grace so we're looking at the
[35:19] supernatural book of Acts church and
[35:20] remember brother bam said we are
[35:22] continuation of the book of Acts we're
[35:24] not something different we're a ation
[35:28] and uh I I've mentioned that before you
[35:30] know we went through that and and it's
[35:32] just wonderful it's a great reminder to
[35:33] see all the things we have in common
[35:35] with the book of Acts of course like
[35:37] brother randam says we preach what Paul
[35:38] preached right we preach the same water
[35:40] baptism we preach the same godhead we
[35:43] preach the the supernatural praise God
[35:46] uh we preach how there's the five-fold
[35:48] ministry we have the same book of Acts
[35:50] praise God it's a wonderful thing to see
[35:52] that we continuation you know when I
[35:54] first came to the message I could look
[35:56] back to the doin ination I could say wow
[35:57] the denomination I was raised in
[35:59] Assembly of God that was not a
[36:00] continuation of the book of Acts right
[36:03] the book of Acts didn't have sinful
[36:04] living like many of them had right they
[36:07] didn't have all the they didn't have
[36:08] cussing preachers in the book of Acts
[36:11] you know I'm sad to say that but that's
[36:12] what denominations have cussing
[36:14] preachers uh they didn't have all this
[36:16] unknown tongues with no interpretation
[36:19] right wherever there was tongues it was
[36:21] always
[36:22] understood right but I was raised in a
[36:24] church as somebody God that there was
[36:26] tongues there was hardly ever an
[36:27] interpretation right hardly ever and so
[36:30] we're thankful to be a continuation of
[36:32] the book of Acts and then brother Bram
[36:34] said the true church will always try to
[36:36] attain to what the book of Acts attained
[36:39] to so I love that you know when we read
[36:42] the book of Acts we should say that's
[36:43] what we need to do we need to do just
[36:45] what they did praise God not something
[36:47] different but the same Hallelujah
[36:49] brother Brooks one time in Guana
[36:51] preached a sermon called the same and
[36:52] and he he just used something very
[36:54] similar he said you know he had two cups
[36:57] he said here's one cup he he said here's
[36:59] another cup and they were totally
[37:00] different one was like plastic and one
[37:02] was foam you know one was metal he said'
[37:04] they're not the same and he went through
[37:06] all these examples then he said here's
[37:08] the denomination and here's the message
[37:10] they're not the same praise God
[37:12] hallelujah and the point is
[37:14] denominations and message churches
[37:15] they're different he said but then he
[37:17] put up the same one I don't have the
[37:19] same pens but then he put up the same
[37:20] cup with the same cup he said they're
[37:22] the same and he says that's what we
[37:24] should be our church is the same as the
[37:26] book of Acts Church praise God not a
[37:28] different church but the same church I
[37:30] guess I can do it like
[37:31] this here's the same song books
[37:35] right probably not crafted real well
[37:38] that was my fault it didn't last very
[37:39] long but this the point is they're the
[37:42] same same songs same size Hallelujah
[37:45] that's what we are same church
[37:46] Hallelujah same God same Holy Spirit
[37:49] same Doctrine same Fellowship praise God
[37:51] same communion hallelujah it's exactly
[37:53] the same and that's what the Bible said
[37:55] in verse 42 we have we have the same
[37:57] Doctrine same Fellowship breaking of
[37:59] bread prayers we have the same
[38:01] everything as the book of Acts praise
[38:03] God and what we desire of course is more
[38:06] wonders signs and miracles that's what
[38:09] we desire more of praise God hallelujah
[38:13] verse 44 they and all they that believe
[38:16] were together and had all things in
[38:19] common verse 45 and sold their
[38:22] possessions and goods and parted them to
[38:24] all men and to every man had had needs
[38:27] so all the needs of the church were met
[38:29] and of course as you read later this is
[38:31] speaking of some people didn't even have
[38:33] daily
[38:34] food so uh you know consider that
[38:36] consider if you know God did Miracles
[38:38] and people came in here had no food we
[38:40] say off the streets or something it's
[38:41] our duty to give them food shelter and
[38:43] clothing praise God if it's cold it's
[38:45] our duty to put a coat on their backs
[38:48] right that's the duty of the church okay
[38:50] and when that's been met then then we
[38:52] have all things in common as long as we
[38:54] all have food shelter and clothing we
[38:56] all have it in common because remember
[38:58] just a few chapters later you know
[38:59] people forget the book of Acts church
[39:01] one time they had trouble with the
[39:03] people that needed daily food remember
[39:05] that in the book of Acts I think it was
[39:06] chapter six if I'm not
[39:08] mistaken we'll get to that eventually
[39:10] yeah chapter
[39:12] six there was widows that were neglected
[39:15] so it was such a big church it sprang up
[39:17] so fast that some group of widows
[39:19] without husbands needed food but they
[39:21] were neglected imagine that a book of
[39:23] Acts church but the people were so on
[39:26] fire they forgot to feed they were so on
[39:28] fire for the the doctrine and everything
[39:29] the fellowship they forgot to feed the
[39:32] widows is any church perfect no there's
[39:35] only going to be one perfect Church
[39:37] really and that's when we all get
[39:38] glorified bodies but here the book of
[39:40] Acts Church they neglected to give
[39:43] people their daily
[39:44] food right and so what they have to do
[39:46] they say well we need people to watch
[39:47] over this we need special anointed men
[39:49] to watch over this give me seven deacons
[39:51] full of the Holy Ghost amen what does
[39:54] that prove a holy ghost filled person
[39:55] wants to see people fed he wants him to
[39:58] see him with coats right they want to
[39:59] see him with a shelter a holy ghost
[40:01] filled person wants the needs of the
[40:03] church met praise God Amen so that's
[40:05] what we must be uh book of Acts church I
[40:07] remember years ago there's this man and
[40:09] I later found out he was a drug addict
[40:11] but he would text me like I need the
[40:12] money now I need the money now and that
[40:14] was in my younger days and so I would
[40:15] just drive up i' leave my family I just
[40:17] drive up and give him food and pretty
[40:19] soon I figured out he was a drug addict
[40:21] and he was trying to just get everything
[40:22] for money well one night it was in the
[40:25] winter time his name was Mike
[40:28] I drove all the way up there from my
[40:29] house in no all the way up there uh
[40:32] right by the University of back right by
[40:34] the chapel there we I met him there and
[40:35] I bought him this tent he had no shelter
[40:37] I said well you can't stay at the church
[40:39] right you can't stay at our house I'm
[40:40] not letting a crazy a drug addict that
[40:43] live in my house I got to protect my
[40:44] children right I said but I'll get you a
[40:47] tent right I can't AF I couldn't afford
[40:48] a hotel I can't afford to put them up in
[40:50] a hotel and he wouldn't come to church
[40:52] he wouldn't do all these things I said
[40:53] but I'll get you a tent and so I bought
[40:55] him a tent
[40:56] but then later on I found out all the
[40:58] some of the things I bought him he went
[40:59] and sold it so he could get money for
[41:01] drugs so see Church you know as the book
[41:04] of Acts church we care about people we
[41:05] do all we can do right but it comes down
[41:08] to the individual they got to accept the
[41:10] word of God and they've got to overcome
[41:12] too praise God remember brother Ram let
[41:15] that brother Ram let this thought uh
[41:18] torment him for years he went to India
[41:19] he saw the Beggars and he's and he he
[41:22] got tormented like you know he would
[41:24] torment himself and feel like he had to
[41:26] he had meet every need and he used to
[41:28] tell the people he said neither rain or
[41:30] shine or anything if you need something
[41:31] I'll come pray for you he said but I
[41:33] learned I can't do that I run myself
[41:35] ragging and I almost killed myself he
[41:36] said so he said I had to learn I had to
[41:39] find the balance I have to do all I can
[41:41] do but I also got to take care of God's
[41:43] man Hallelujah that's the balance I've
[41:45] tried to find you know and I think you
[41:46] try to find too we want to help all the
[41:48] people we can help but we also have to
[41:50] find balance in our lives praise God
[41:53] right because even Jesus rested in the
[41:55] boat right right you know even Jesus
[41:58] went off to pray early in the morning
[41:59] praise God you know uh even Elijah had
[42:02] to go off in a cave and get some rest
[42:04] praise
[42:05] God so it's a we're a continuation and
[42:08] by God's grace church we'll always try
[42:10] to be like the book of Acts church and
[42:12] if you see us getting off into Nom
[42:14] denominationalism as AAA has been
[42:16] studying on that lately we've heard
[42:17] different sermons on it so it seems like
[42:18] the holy spirit's been dealing with her
[42:20] on that uh just a good a good
[42:23] reminder you know if we ever see it go
[42:25] in that direction we really got to pray
[42:27] Hallelujah really got to get back to the
[42:29] word of God and not live by Traditions
[42:31] but live by the word of God now remember
[42:34] this too all Traditions aren't bad there
[42:36] are some good
[42:37] Traditions okay let's turn there into
[42:39] scripture that just came to my mind let
[42:41] me look that up here real quick I
[42:43] believe it's
[42:47] uh Timothy but let let me let me look
[42:53] here oh yeah second second Thessalonians
[42:56] 2:15 let's go there if you got your
[42:58] Bible here know some people say well
[42:59] brother Jess we can't have any
[43:00] Traditions if we're in the book of Acts
[43:01] Church well I'm sorry you misunderstood
[43:03] the word you forgot there's uh there's
[43:07] also an era called Christian Liberties
[43:09] don't forget that church and the church
[43:10] said there's commands we got to keep
[43:12] those but then there's an area of
[43:14] Christian liberty before there's the
[43:15] area of sin Hallelujah so just because
[43:19] well you know our church has this
[43:20] tradition that doesn't mean it's wrong
[43:23] we just got to make sure we keep the
[43:24] sincerity inside of our
[43:27] tradition for example you know like I
[43:29] was telling brother amen if we have uh
[43:31] two or three Youth Services a year
[43:33] that's a tradition what's but what's
[43:34] wrong with that there's nothing wrong
[43:36] with that as long as our hearts are
[43:39] sincere now if I say at one of the youth
[43:41] service say well we're not going to pray
[43:43] for the Holy Ghost come up here and have
[43:45] this wafer and this wafer represents the
[43:47] holy ghost that would be Catholic then
[43:49] it' be denomination you know I never do
[43:51] that I'm just giving an obvious example
[43:55] when when a when a uh sin comes into the
[43:57] the tradition then the tradition's wrong
[43:59] but if the tradition has nothing against
[44:01] it it's an area of Liberty and we've got
[44:03] to keep that area clean from any
[44:06] unbelief just like a good example is
[44:08] communion there's nothing in the Bible
[44:10] says You must have communion every time
[44:11] you meet right so it's an area of
[44:13] Liberty and and that's why I you know
[44:16] when we were at Lima I just saw some
[44:18] people you know get away from the
[44:19] sincerity because we had it every month
[44:21] so when I when we started the church
[44:22] here and I became Pastor I said I'm not
[44:23] going to do it every month we'll do it
[44:25] every three months or whatever it is now
[44:27] now I want to try to do it every three
[44:28] months or something like that I just
[44:30] want to make sure our Traditions are
[44:32] sincere is that help therefore Brethren
[44:36] Stand Fast and hold your Traditions
[44:37] which you have been taught whether by
[44:39] word now look or by epistle epistle are
[44:42] written letters and the church said so
[44:45] you either got Traditions that are Bible
[44:47] you know our tradition to baptize is
[44:49] Lord Jesus Christ amen that's our
[44:51] tradition praise it'll always be our
[44:53] tradition
[44:54] Hallelujah but we also o might have some
[44:57] words that are passed down some
[44:58] traditions that are just passed down
[45:00] brother J I heard the church said this
[45:01] this is a good thing to do have you
[45:04] Services that's the most recent one
[45:05] we've done or have prayer and fasting or
[45:08] have uh have a annual Revival Services
[45:11] what's wrong with that there's nothing
[45:12] wrong with that as long as we keep our
[45:14] hearts
[45:15] pure and remember this is the book of
[45:17] Acts church the church in thessalonica
[45:19] that's a book of Acts church but
[45:22] remember Paul also told that church if
[45:24] those guys don't eat I'm sorry those
[45:26] guys don't work they don't eat so see we
[45:29] see the book of Acts you got to feed
[45:30] people that don't have food but now
[45:31] there's a balance to it unless they're
[45:33] lazy then they don't get any food and
[45:36] the church said so see I love it I love
[45:38] it this is a continuation the book of
[45:40] Acts we are a continuation of the book
[45:42] of Acts Church praise God Amen so we
[45:46] must always try brother you pray for
[45:48] your pastor Lord help brother Jesse
[45:49] always to try to attain to the book of
[45:51] Acts Church Hallelujah help me help my
[45:53] family help me or my husband or my wife
[45:55] help help help help our children help us
[45:57] always to attain to the book of Acts
[45:59] Church praise
[46:00] God hallelujah so see when they got the
[46:03] holy ghost or they got even saved we
[46:05] don't even know if these 3,000 got the
[46:06] holy ghost or they just got saved just
[46:08] Souls were added right that could be
[46:10] saved or filled with the Holy Ghost what
[46:12] they do they constantly Fellowship they
[46:14] wanted to be taught the doctrine they
[46:16] wanted to have communion they wanted to
[46:17] pray together they wanted to be together
[46:20] praise God Amen that's a book of Acts
[46:24] Church
[46:28] now I want to read a few quotes here
[46:29] brother BR said this where I think
[46:31] Pentecost failed 1955 now he said what a
[46:35] Time Paul had with these Corinthians now
[46:36] we're looking just briefly at the
[46:38] Corinthian Church as because they're a
[46:39] part of the book of Acts Church they
[46:41] were all seeking after different
[46:43] blessings and spiritual gifts and Paul
[46:45] had to speak to them as
[46:48] children but when he come to the
[46:50] Ephesian church he speaks to them in a
[46:52] different way the Church of Ephesus they
[46:54] are a solid gospel Church how many want
[46:57] to be a solid gospel church I don't want
[46:59] to be a flimsy jellyfish church I don't
[47:02] want that brother R said compromisers
[47:03] are like jellyfish churches right
[47:06] they'll compromise they'll let the women
[47:07] wear sexy clothes they let the men smoke
[47:09] and drink and cuss and carouse women
[47:12] that's a jellyfish church we want a
[47:14] solid church that's got a backbone
[47:16] praise God Amen they know where they
[47:18] stand they believe the word of God they
[47:20] stand behind the word and they believe
[47:22] all the Traditions whether by epistle or
[47:24] word of God hallelujah amen thank God
[47:28] Amen another quote 1957 brother said the
[47:31] Corinthians they could just believe
[47:33] anything but they didn't believe the
[47:35] right thing of course he was talking
[47:37] about how they let they let all these
[47:39] tongues and tongues go tongues go but
[47:41] Paul said just have three tongues
[47:43] interpretation in the church
[47:46] right see uh that's what I love about
[47:48] the Corinthians their book of Acts
[47:50] church and they really love spiritual
[47:52] gifts and let me say like this too
[47:53] Church they had a lot of spiritual gifts
[47:56] in other words we can't manufacture
[47:58] spiritual gifts we can only get in the
[48:00] channel and let God use the gifts that
[48:02] we've already
[48:03] got right and there could be a time and
[48:06] season when those gifts start moving
[48:09] right we'll we'll definitely see it if
[48:10] the children grow up and they get they
[48:11] get to stay at our church hopefully they
[48:13] get to stay at our church Hopey they
[48:14] don't move away too far you
[48:17] know but we'll especially see it in
[48:20] their lives and of course all of our
[48:21] Lives we start seeing it how oh God used
[48:24] that one for a testimony you know like
[48:26] we were talking about you know our
[48:27] individual gifts you know all these
[48:28] things that are happening in our lives
[48:29] the wonderful testimonies it's probably
[48:32] an indicator of gifts in our lives
[48:33] praise God but we can only be what God
[48:37] called us to be brother said you can't
[48:38] be something that you
[48:39] hate he used his old Kentucky English
[48:43] you can only be what God's called you to
[48:45] be praise God you stay consecrated to
[48:48] Jesus right and God will use you at the
[48:51] right
[48:54] time I like that
[48:57] brother Braham said Do you believe the
[49:00] Ephesian Church spoke in tongues brother
[49:02] Braham saidwhat certainly now Paul never
[49:04] wrote to them about tongues but he said
[49:06] certainly they did do you believe they
[49:07] had signs and wonders yes sir but they
[49:09] knowed how to place them their pastor
[49:12] know how to set them and put the church
[49:13] in order but the Corinthians didn't now
[49:16] so far by God's grace our church has
[49:18] been in order right so every time we've
[49:22] had an unknown tongue what have we done
[49:23] we prayed and got tried to get it
[49:25] interpretation right that's order and
[49:28] I've even told you this if you feel led
[49:30] to speak in tongues and you don't even
[49:31] know if there's an interpreter just
[49:32] speak in tongues we'll pray about it
[49:34] praise God I just want people to feel so
[49:37] free that they can be moved by the Holy
[49:38] Spirit and they can let God have his way
[49:40] praise God Amen I'm trying to yield to
[49:43] the Holy Spirit you're trying to yield
[49:44] to the Holy Spirit but we have to learn
[49:46] to yield to the Holy Spirit we don't
[49:47] want to quench the Holy
[49:49] Spirit right we want to yield to the
[49:51] Holy Spirit and let God's will be done
[49:54] hallelujah
[49:58] so it's a great thing Paul told them
[50:00] you've got great gifts I'm thankful for
[50:02] them but they didn't know how to use
[50:03] them he said that's the way it is in the
[50:05] church today it's went went on long
[50:07] enough till the Devils begin to slip in
[50:09] and give you some false signs of Wonders
[50:10] now remember church that's what happened
[50:12] at zza Street remember few months ago
[50:14] can everybody can everybody F uh I'm
[50:15] sorry rewind 10 months ago when I was
[50:17] preaching on zza Street remember
[50:19] that 1906 ever remember that April I
[50:23] forget which day in April 1906 the Holy
[50:24] Ghost fell but it was such a move of God
[50:27] Satan couldn't get past the gifts so he
[50:29] had to send witches in there to
[50:31] impersonate
[50:33] gifts right so what I'm trying to say is
[50:36] no matter how close we are to God no
[50:37] matter uh which side we're on whether
[50:39] lots of gifts or less gifts or big
[50:41] church or small Church we're going to be
[50:43] battled by Satan but we can overcome
[50:45] Satan hallelujah amen and and I've
[50:48] always and we always want to and you've
[50:50] always done it you've always been a
[50:50] wonderful church we never want to
[50:52] impersonate anything i' rather have less
[50:56] and have no impersonation than try to
[50:58] impersonate and miss it right so in
[51:01] other words just wait till something
[51:02] genuine praise God as I said a few weeks
[51:05] ago you'll know when it's genuine praise
[51:07] God like remember at Napoleon I'm
[51:09] talking about special services when the
[51:10] Holy Ghost Falls and it's very
[51:12] Supernatural it's very spiritual you'll
[51:14] know when it's God hallelujah you'll
[51:16] start acting differently like real
[51:17] differently praise God because it's God
[51:20] doing something it's God moving it's God
[51:22] manifesting something it's a visitation
[51:24] from Heaven praise God see now look he's
[51:27] always with us all the time he never
[51:28] leaves us or forsakes US but there
[51:30] sometimes he likes to visit us
[51:31] hallelujah in a special way that's
[51:34] exactly right amen there's sometimes
[51:37] where there's great visitations it's to
[51:39] give us signs Miracles or wonders now
[51:42] what do you think that aoon service was
[51:43] that was a wonder wow look what God can
[51:45] do when people get in one Accord look
[51:47] what God can do when parents and and and
[51:50] and spouses take work off or travel
[51:53] three hours across the state
[51:56] and show up and praise God for four
[51:58] services in a row that's a Wonder look
[52:01] what God can do
[52:04] amen now I'll say like this if any of
[52:06] those little girls got saved up there
[52:08] that was a uh that was a miracle because
[52:10] the greatest Miracle is what salvation I
[52:13] like that amen thank I was just going to
[52:15] say can I get amen good amen didn't have
[52:17] to ask but I just want to emphasize
[52:19] that's the real Miracle it's a soul
[52:21] saved praise God now how many of those
[52:23] little ones got the Holy Ghost we were
[52:24] guest around five yeah four five
[52:26] hallelujah amen glory that's an even
[52:29] greater miracle I mean it's a soul
[52:31] you're sealed to the day of your
[52:33] Redemption praise
[52:34] God hallelujah see we're just a
[52:38] continuation we're just keeping it going
[52:41] amen hallelujah we're just waving the
[52:44] banner Hallelujah this is the standard
[52:46] we're we're saying rally around the
[52:47] standard rally around the message of the
[52:49] hour rally Around Jesus Christ rally
[52:51] around the book of Acts that's where we
[52:53] gather we rally around the book of Acts
[52:55] Hallelujah we don't worship the Bible
[52:57] that's not what we're saying we're
[52:58] saying we're we're rallying around the
[53:00] the truth the Divine truth that is in
[53:03] the Bible praise
[53:05] God we never worship the Bible like I've
[53:07] seen people kiss the Bible you shouldn't
[53:09] do that that's worship
[53:12] almost the Bible said kiss the son lest
[53:15] he be angry huh the Bible never said
[53:18] kiss the Bible now we know the Jesus is
[53:20] the word of God right but this Bible
[53:23] itself is not Jesus's holy spirit it's a
[53:26] it's a bunch of paper and
[53:28] glue right and ink right so we have to
[53:31] make sure we don't worship the Bible now
[53:33] how you might have hugged it if it you
[53:35] know maybe gave you something real nice
[53:36] there might have slept on it if you fell
[53:38] asleep on your Bible but it's not to be
[53:40] worshiped praise God it's Jesus that
[53:42] gets all the worship he's the word and
[53:45] the Bible said he was the word he is the
[53:47] word in the beginning was the word the
[53:49] word was with God and the Word was God
[53:51] Hallelujah the word is a person
[53:54] Hallelujah but to know the person you
[53:56] read his written word that's how you
[53:59] know him that's how he speaks to you all
[54:03] right now I want to read this quote
[54:05] before we get out of Acts chapter 2 this
[54:07] is a very uh famous quote if you haven't
[54:10] listened to the invisible Union of the
[54:12] bride of Christ you might want to do
[54:13] that I didn't listen to it I've just
[54:14] pulled this quote I listened to it uh
[54:16] earlier this year when I preached
[54:18] uh you never did in the first place
[54:21] remember that right before went to an
[54:22] appoint brother bam said you see she's
[54:25] pregnated with something he's talking
[54:27] about two women he's talking about the
[54:28] denominational church and the true
[54:29] church the bride of
[54:31] Christ because she's bringing forth
[54:33] members all the time see how these
[54:34] churches grown they're having members
[54:36] but what produced that what pregnancy
[54:38] did they get pregnated with spiritually
[54:40] was it God seed or was it the serpent
[54:43] seed only time will
[54:46] tell that's scriptural because the
[54:48] mother Harlot has
[54:51] children Hallelujah just kind of went
[54:55] from real easy to real deep real fast
[54:57] there brother manam said she is the
[54:59] denominations are bringing forth
[55:01] children all the time now this is as far
[55:02] as I'm going to go with bringing forth
[55:04] children but how how is she bringing
[55:07] forth children because she's pregnant
[55:09] she received the seed of serpent the LIE
[55:13] now can there be genuine people in they
[55:15] saved yes but we're talking about
[55:17] brother is talking about the false
[55:18] church and the true church
[55:22] amen he said but she don't want the
[55:24] false Church don't want none of them
[55:27] screaming
[55:28] hollering blabbering blabber
[55:33] blabber acts 238 miserable creatures
[55:37] that she thinks they are amen I'm glad
[55:40] I'm a hollering screaming blabbering
[55:43] acts 238 miserable creature amen
[55:46] hallelujah I love being that I love
[55:48] being that amen I'd rather be that than
[55:51] anything else I could think of
[55:53] Amen thank God amen the denominations
[55:57] don't want
[55:58] that they want now they want somebody
[56:00] who's maybe shouting or blabbering but
[56:02] they want them to give them their all
[56:03] their money and get rich off them right
[56:06] they got a Prosperity Gospel that's
[56:08] usually who does it the charismatics not
[56:09] only are they charismatic they make up
[56:11] their gifts they make up their false
[56:12] prophecies not only do they do that but
[56:15] they want your
[56:16] money you know there's people there's
[56:18] preachers that pretend to be like
[56:20] brother brandom and they got their phone
[56:21] up there and they're searching Instagram
[56:23] about people that are at the meeting and
[56:25] they pretend to discern them and tell
[56:26] them the secrets of their heart and
[56:28] they're crying and all these things and
[56:29] they proved it they're just they're just
[56:30] surfing Instagram the people that are
[56:32] there or Facebook and telling them uh is
[56:35] your address so and so uh bunch of
[56:39] liars that's charismatic that that's
[56:41] what I'm talking about that's the woman
[56:42] who's bringing forth members all the
[56:43] time pretending God's spirit doesn't
[56:47] pretend God's spirit is a truth
[56:49] hallelujah amen hallelujah God won't lie
[56:53] God don't play around God don't tease
[56:55] God is truth he's always truth he always
[56:57] will be the truth praise
[57:00] God but Ram said it would certainly
[57:02] embarrass her in Acts 238 miserable
[57:05] creature would embarrass the Catholic
[57:08] church church you would embarrass say
[57:11] like I'm not sure how far I should go on
[57:13] that some say sometimes when we visit
[57:15] other churches I can tell some people
[57:17] are embarrassed because of our clapping
[57:18] and singing shouting not everybody I
[57:21] noticed I said not I said some of them
[57:23] some of them were like I see them I'm up
[57:26] at the front I can see people's faces

[57:43] her out at the next Council she can't
[57:45] have it no she don't want to be
[57:47] pregnated with the word because that's
[57:48] the only kind that the word can bring
[57:52] forth there's only one kind of Christian
[57:55] that's the Holy Ghost acts 238 screaming
[57:57] hollering blabbing acts 238 younging

[58:08] because that's how I got the Holy Ghost
[58:09] screaming crying blabbering shaking
[58:13] hallelujah oh thank God Amen it's the
[58:16] only kind that the word can bring forth
[58:19] now let's go to those Devils lying in
[58:20] some of those message churches oh it's
[58:22] the Holy Ghost without sensation now
[58:24] what you do about that
[58:26] quote see they say there's there's no
[58:29] sensation what about this one brother

[58:38] Malachi sometimes I want to shake your
[58:40] hand say LD I really enjoyed that
[58:41] blabbering you did there
[58:45] Hallelujah wonderful screaming there
[58:47] sister who I appreciate that Hallelujah
[58:49] you're a real acts 238
[58:51] person that's the only kind not every
[58:54] every service but when the Holy Ghost

[58:58] can eternal life come in and life
[59:00] doesn't respond praise
[59:02] God you've that's all you've ever wanted
[59:04] is eternal life if eternal life ever
[59:06] comes in there you've got the desire of
[59:08] your soul you've got the desire of your
[59:10] heart something has to happen praise God

[59:22] Revival Services amen couple weeks away
[59:25] here by God's grace trying to get you
[59:27] stirred up trying to get myself stirred
[59:30] up brother said now notice what the
[59:33] denomination loves watch her L her you
[59:35] want to see who she's in love with the
[59:38] word says this but she says no my church
[59:40] says this then who is she in love with
[59:42] who's her husband who is the husband of
[59:45] the Catholic Church
[59:47] Satan I'll say like this who's the
[59:49] husband of the US government
[59:51] Satan now not everybody's in there
[59:53] satanic like brother BR you know like
[59:55] brother Bram said we're not against the
[59:57] people in the denominations we're
[59:58] against the system the Demonic Source
[1:00:01] behind it
[1:00:04] right her own fruits prove what she is
[1:00:07] exactly right shows what she
[1:00:10] is he said that's a lover of the world
[1:00:14] she claims that she's born the second
[1:00:15] time to Christ but notice her lover she
[1:00:18] said but she loves the
[1:00:21] world right they love the selfies on Tik
[1:00:23] Tock and whatever showing off their
[1:00:25] bodies you know look at me they love
[1:00:28] that because they love the world and the
[1:00:30] Bible said if you love the world you
[1:00:31] don't even have God's
[1:00:33] love trying to make a few bucks why
[1:00:36] don't you go work at the grocery store
[1:00:37] or something like that or why don't you
[1:00:39] go work at Walmart or make a honest Buck
[1:00:41] praise God come work at my school I need
[1:00:43] some workers at the school PR anywhere
[1:00:45] just work somewhere get an honest dollar
[1:00:49] Hallelujah but see they love the world
[1:00:52] more than they love
[1:00:53] God brother man said another thing
[1:00:55] notice the kind of children that she's
[1:00:57] bearing the denominations that tells who
[1:01:00] her papa is whether it's the first Adam
[1:01:02] or the second Adam so brother man says
[1:01:03] the first Adam was denominational right
[1:01:05] Adam sinned so sin the second Adam is
[1:01:08] Christ amen he said if the church brings
[1:01:11] forth a child of the second Adam he acts
[1:01:14] like the second Adam's way of acting
[1:01:16] like they did on the day of
[1:01:19] Pentecost hallelujah what they do on the
[1:01:22] day of Pentecost they got baptized what
[1:01:24] did they do after that they said teach
[1:01:26] me the word of God teach me the doctrine
[1:01:29] and they said let's have
[1:01:31] communion Hallelujah is that right and
[1:01:34] then they said let's not stop after a
[1:01:35] few weeks let's continue this thing
[1:01:38] hallelujah amen let's not just do this
[1:01:40] for a little while let's be in this all
[1:01:42] the way praise God this is worth my life
[1:01:46] this is worth my energy this is worth
[1:01:48] everything to me because it's eternal
[1:01:50] life
[1:01:51] hallelujah amen and I'm bored not from
[1:01:55] the first Adam really I'm born from the
[1:01:57] second Adam
[1:01:59] Hallelujah right my mother the church
[1:02:02] birth me right the Church of the Liv the
[1:02:04] firstborn Hallelujah my father was the
[1:02:06] second Adam Christ Hallelujah I've been
[1:02:08] born again of the word of God The
[1:02:10] Incorruptible seed of God
[1:02:14] hallelujah he said that's really the
[1:02:16] true second Adam's children acting like
[1:02:19] they did on the day of
[1:02:20] Pentecost but her daughters are painted
[1:02:23] faed bobbed haed wear men's clothes
[1:02:25] trousers the Bible said for her not to
[1:02:27] do it she cuts her hair it's a shame for
[1:02:29] her to do that you say brother Ram shut
[1:02:31] up on that he said that's what the word
[1:02:32] says I'm only pointing out the nature
[1:02:35] that's what she
[1:02:37] does he said her sons the denominations
[1:02:40] they rely on education well Jesse you
[1:02:42] didn't go to Seminary I don't have to go
[1:02:44] to Seminary all they're going to do is
[1:02:46] pollute my
[1:02:47] mind right it's just going to turn into
[1:02:49] a cemetery right Seminary is a cemetery
[1:02:52] that's all it is it's where you go to
[1:02:53] die
[1:02:55] but said The more degrees you get the
[1:02:57] further you get from God in a
[1:02:59] seminary Hallelujah I got two natural
[1:03:02] degrees I got a a ma a bachelor's and a
[1:03:04] master's but I'd say this I'm closer to
[1:03:06] God than I ever was because I know more
[1:03:09] and I obey more the church said say it
[1:03:12] ought be the same for you so my natural
[1:03:14] degrees has nothing to do with my
[1:03:15] spiritual life because I'm not getting
[1:03:17] degrees about God I'm just getting
[1:03:18] degrees to try to make a few extra bucks
[1:03:20] for my family
[1:03:23] Hallelujah but it's it's how much can
[1:03:25] you grow spiritually praise God like the
[1:03:28] brother said I got a degree of
[1:03:30] neology I've been praying all my knees
[1:03:33] for decades now is that right how many
[1:03:37] want to graduate with that degree and a
[1:03:39] degree of Ney not an honorary degree but
[1:03:41] a real degree amen a real degree that I
[1:03:45] prayed on my knees amen I sought God I
[1:03:48] keep seeking God
[1:03:51] hallelujah that's what he said this
[1:03:53] woman relies on the denominational
[1:03:54] Church some Bible School so-called some
[1:03:57] great College that's supposed to be from
[1:03:59] a long time ago he said they're
[1:04:01] denominational Seekers religious like
[1:04:03] Cain but illegitimate to the word as
[1:04:06] Cain was God never did organize a
[1:04:09] denomination right he's always been
[1:04:11] against it his word is against it
[1:04:13] Hallelujah okay I'll stop all right
[1:04:15] there move on I got 20 minutes okay bl's
[1:04:18] PL time all right go to Acts chapter 3
[1:04:20] now I wanted I wanted to finish that
[1:04:21] with Acts chapter 2 tonight I wanted you
[1:04:23] to remember that brother Ram had those
[1:04:26] quotes the true church can only bring
[1:04:28] forth children like Acts chapter 2
[1:04:31] everybody has to have an Acts chapter 2
[1:04:33] experience somehow
[1:04:35] somewhere right that's how the church is
[1:04:38] born and if you're ever born you'll act
[1:04:40] like they did on the day of Pentecost at
[1:04:41] some point in your life right at some
[1:04:45] point we don't know how much we have to
[1:04:46] act like that but we know this we want
[1:04:48] to be in the spirit as much as
[1:04:51] possible but clapping singing shouting
[1:04:53] and crying that's doesn't always mean
[1:04:54] the spirit right that can just be human
[1:04:58] emotion but we want to have we want to
[1:05:00] have one time where we know a birth
[1:05:01] happened life came in power came in a
[1:05:04] testimony came in Hallelujah an
[1:05:06] experience happened and you know you're
[1:05:08] different from that point on and then
[1:05:10] the rest of your life will prove that
[1:05:11] that was a genuine
[1:05:14] experience
[1:05:18] Hallelujah that then that's your and
[1:05:20] that's when the devil battles me and say
[1:05:21] well you're not born again that wasn't a
[1:05:23] real birth I said well devil look at my
[1:05:26] life look at these I said I got it in
[1:05:29] 2003 here I am 20 years later amen since
[1:05:31] I got the Holy Ghost I didn't even know
[1:05:32] that here I am look at my life does my
[1:05:35] life look like the book of Acts or not
[1:05:36] do I preach the book of Acts do I live
[1:05:38] the book of Acts do I try to do
[1:05:39] everything like the book of Acts that's
[1:05:40] exactly my that's my pattern praise
[1:05:42] that's my blueprint brother Ram said the
[1:05:44] blueprint is the Bible the blueprint is
[1:05:47] the book of Acts and I built my life I
[1:05:49] tried to build this church by preaching
[1:05:51] I tried to build this church upon the
[1:05:52] blueprint of the book of act act
[1:05:54] hallelujah amen
[1:05:57] amen and where do they say in the book
[1:05:59] of Acts they're the greatest of all time
[1:06:00] they didn't say that that's one proof
[1:06:02] I'm not building into domination
[1:06:05] remember the same people that said that
[1:06:06] are now saying now we're just seconds
[1:06:08] from the
[1:06:09] Rapture back at last year they said
[1:06:11] there were days and minutes from the
[1:06:12] Rapture and now they're saying we're
[1:06:13] seconds a church not to disagree with
[1:06:15] any godly man but to me that's just a
[1:06:18] lack of understanding because seconds
[1:06:21] passed how many seconds have passed
[1:06:22] since they said that last Sunday how
[1:06:24] many seconds have
[1:06:25] passed when and these are the same
[1:06:27] people that you know they falsely
[1:06:28] predict people are going to be healed
[1:06:29] and they
[1:06:31] die so I you know to me God's word will
[1:06:36] make somebody humble God's word will
[1:06:38] make somebody
[1:06:40] teachable and not try to move the people
[1:06:43] by fear but let's move the people by the
[1:06:45] word of
[1:06:46] God that the same people that said uh
[1:06:49] there's no more scriptures left to be
[1:06:50] fulfilled before the Rapture well then
[1:06:52] why hasn't the Rapture happened if all
[1:06:54] the scripture has been fulfilled how
[1:06:55] come the Rapture hasn't happened because
[1:06:57] there's scripture left to be fulfilled
[1:06:59] there's Souls left to be saved there's
[1:07:01] preaching left to be
[1:07:03] done right Jesus said in Luke 21 when
[1:07:06] the fullness of the Gentiles come in
[1:07:09] then God will return to the Jews well
[1:07:11] that means there's still scripture
[1:07:13] there's still we need missionaries
[1:07:14] praise God now how many want to line up
[1:07:17] and be a missionary don't raise your
[1:07:18] hand especially the brothers or sisters
[1:07:21] how many want to be married to a
[1:07:22] missionary and leave and go to a real
[1:07:24] destitute country where you might not
[1:07:26] have all the blessings of America you
[1:07:29] might not have
[1:07:30] Plumbing like brother digs just got back
[1:07:32] from Guyana where we used to go and once
[1:07:35] you leave the city there's no
[1:07:37] Plumbing there's no Plumbing you got to
[1:07:39] get water down from the river I stayed
[1:07:41] at the camp Cam and I stay at the camp
[1:07:42] there for what seven days or whatever
[1:07:44] five days there's no
[1:07:46] Plumbing you go in that restroom you go
[1:07:49] in that ous that's back to the
[1:07:51] ous it's hot in there there there's no
[1:07:54] air conditioning in there and that's all
[1:07:56] day every day and there's no flush you
[1:07:58] can't flush it's just a hole in the
[1:08:01] ground now how many want to be
[1:08:02] missionary wives
[1:08:04] now
[1:08:07] see how many want to be Miss how many
[1:08:09] preachers want to leave all the
[1:08:10] blessings of
[1:08:11] now go there or get eat up by mosquitoes
[1:08:15] like I did I don't want to do that I
[1:08:19] might have to if God calls me that but
[1:08:21] it's the reality of it what do we need
[1:08:23] we their scriptures will be fulfilled we
[1:08:25] need preachers we need missionaries Amen
[1:08:27] brother said we need more of them praise
[1:08:29] God yes brother Bram brother Bram I feel
[1:08:31] call to preach and I preach he said get
[1:08:33] out there and preach Hallelujah we need
[1:08:35] more preachers Hallelujah we need more
[1:08:37] people preaching the book of Acts
[1:08:39] Hallelujah baptizing in Jesus Christ's
[1:08:41] name amen praying for the sick and the
[1:08:44] sick shall recover hallelujah amen
[1:08:46] that's what we need more of how' I get
[1:08:48] on that praise God I don't know Acts
[1:08:50] chapter 3
[1:08:52] ver1 but Peter and John went up together
[1:08:55] into the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[1:08:57] being the ninth hour now there's a good
[1:08:58] example there's a tradition of man right
[1:09:02] there where does the bible say somebody
[1:09:04] show me where does the New Testament say
[1:09:05] you have to pray at the n9th hour which
[1:09:07] is three o'clock how many of you prayed
[1:09:09] at three o'clock today you stop what
[1:09:12] you're doing and pray anybody pray at
[1:09:13] three o'clock why because it's not in
[1:09:15] the
[1:09:15] Bible but it was a tradition that they
[1:09:18] had the Jews I think if I'm not mistaken
[1:09:20] they would pray at the sixth hour the
[1:09:22] 9th the 12 12 yeah the six 6th 9th and
[1:09:27] 12th 12th hour that's why Daniel Prayed
[1:09:28] three times a day now the Muslims pray
[1:09:31] five times a day and it's not shame on
[1:09:33] us because they're they're doing it out
[1:09:34] of a demon Spirit they're trying to
[1:09:37] impersonate real religion but they don't
[1:09:38] have real religion it's a false lying
[1:09:41] religion that likes to murder people
[1:09:43] that's a it's a shame on them but the
[1:09:46] Bible said also we're supposed to pray
[1:09:47] without ceasing so see you got to
[1:09:49] balance that out but here they're just
[1:09:52] following a Jewish tradition they're not
[1:09:54] under the law they're je they're they're
[1:09:56] Christians now verse
[1:09:58] two and a certain uh man lame from his
[1:10:01] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[1:10:03] daily at the Gate of the temple which is
[1:10:06] called Beautiful to ask arms of them
[1:10:08] that entered into the temple Now isn't
[1:10:10] that a great place how would you like it
[1:10:11] if there was a man begging out here
[1:10:13] every service before you came would you
[1:10:15] give to him every service will you start
[1:10:18] dividing your money well I usually give
[1:10:19] $10 for offering every week so I'll give
[1:10:21] if I know he's going to be there I'll
[1:10:22] give him five $5 on Wednesday and I'll
[1:10:23] get five on Sunday see how you start
[1:10:26] having these I I need to help out the
[1:10:30] poor traditions we have to serve God in
[1:10:33] our
[1:10:37] Traditions verse three who seeing Peter
[1:10:39] and John about to go in the temple asked
[1:10:41] on and alms and Peter now look at this
[1:10:43] look at this Faith fastening his eyes
[1:10:45] upon him with John I don't know this but
[1:10:46] it looks like he probably a vision
[1:10:48] because how could you say this without a
[1:10:50] vision and said look on us and he gave
[1:10:53] heed unto to them expecting to receive
[1:10:54] something of them then Peter said Silver
[1:10:56] and Gold Have I None but such as I have
[1:11:00] give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:02] of Nazareth rise up and walk now that's
[1:11:05] power right there numerous times I've
[1:11:07] been asked to pray for people that
[1:11:08] couldn't walk and I pray with all my
[1:11:09] heart but God didn't move at that moment
[1:11:12] but I've had the faith to pray one time
[1:11:14] was in Trinidad I don't I think Ghana
[1:11:16] was other time oh the other one was over
[1:11:17] there in Pennsylvania that's right
[1:11:18] Pennsylvania last time I was out there
[1:11:19] last last year about this time and you
[1:11:22] just I just Tred to ask him have you
[1:11:23] confessed your sin I try to pray as much
[1:11:25] as I can as much Faith as I can but
[1:11:29] there's no doubt Peter knew he must had
[1:11:30] a vision he was a prophet he must have
[1:11:32] knew this man's going to rise he must
[1:11:34] have seen it praise God because we know
[1:11:36] later didn't he see cornelius's house
[1:11:38] right didn't he see the Visions rise
[1:11:40] kill and eat Angels gonna come take you
[1:11:42] to a man's
[1:11:43] house he was a
[1:11:46] prophet and notice here verse seven and
[1:11:49] he took him by the right hand and lifted
[1:11:50] him up and immediately his feet and
[1:11:52] ankle bones received strength look at
[1:11:53] that that immedate this is a miracle
[1:11:55] Hallelujah and the Miracle's done in the
[1:11:58] name of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh it's
[1:12:01] beautiful a true Miracle he never even
[1:12:04] walked from his womb imagine it's like a
[1:12:08] baby elephant they can walk on the day
[1:12:09] that they're born they just they're born
[1:12:10] and as soon as they get their bounce
[1:12:12] they're walking that's what God did here
[1:12:13] amen he took something from the Animal
[1:12:15] Kingdom amen he never walked but now
[1:12:17] you're now you're healed now you can
[1:12:19] walk immediate strength in the in the in
[1:12:22] the joint I'm sorry in the joints in the
[1:12:23] bones think about that praise God
[1:12:26] immediately Powers going given into the
[1:12:28] the joints this is a level of Faith
[1:12:31] where this is no doubt a sign Miracle or
[1:12:33] wonder something was one of those or
[1:12:35] maybe all
[1:12:36] three
[1:12:38] Hallelujah now going on to verse
[1:12:40] 16 everybody gets moved by
[1:12:44] this oh don't forget he went uh dancing
[1:12:47] and leaping all around the church there
[1:12:49] praise God and Jesus said if you get if
[1:12:51] you get accused he said do the same
[1:12:53] thing leap and dance and praise the Lord
[1:12:55] hallelujah verse 16 Peter's testifying
[1:12:58] here he says and his name now this is I
[1:13:00] like what scoffield said this is the
[1:13:02] second sermon in the Bible in the book
[1:13:04] of Acts the first one was the day of
[1:13:06] Pentecost so here's his second sermon
[1:13:09] and his name through faith in his name
[1:13:10] Ha made this man strong what's made you
[1:13:13] strong it's been the name of Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ how'd you make it through this
[1:13:17] week how'd you become a Christian in the
[1:13:18] first place how'd you get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:20] it was the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:22] strengthen you
[1:13:24] hallelujah amen that's see I'll say like
[1:13:26] this it's the only thing that'll
[1:13:28] strengthen you it's the only thing
[1:13:30] that'll strengthen me is the name of
[1:13:32] Jesus Christ the power of God the Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit we should sing that song I just
[1:13:36] speak the name of Jesus Hallelujah over
[1:13:38] my family over this church Hallelujah
[1:13:41] over our lost loved ones over our
[1:13:43] sicknesses over our confusion let's
[1:13:45] speak the name of Jesus there's power in
[1:13:47] the name of Jesus
[1:13:51] am hard did this man he's never walked
[1:13:54] how do he walk and get immediate strike
[1:13:57] his name through faith in his name and
[1:14:00] what is faith brother tells us it's a
[1:14:01] revelation so God gave the Revelation to
[1:14:03] Peter that this man was going to be
[1:14:05] healed here
[1:14:09] hallelujah I love that
[1:14:12] verse Faith through the name of Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ go on to verse 21 this is a great
[1:14:17] message verse this would be good for you
[1:14:18] know uh sister Lena and sister Zer here
[1:14:21] and the children if you haven't heard
[1:14:23] this one I use this one a lot in the
[1:14:25] book uh the 12 New Testament
[1:14:27] Ministries let's actually read verse 20
[1:14:29] and he shall send Jesus Christ which
[1:14:31] before was preached unto you whom the
[1:14:34] Heaven Must receive until so Heaven is
[1:14:37] going to hold Jesus's body until when
[1:14:40] the times of restitution of all
[1:14:45] things which God has spoken by the mouth
[1:14:48] of all his holy prophets since the world
[1:14:50] began okay so that's why we know
[1:14:53] this this new testament teaching must be
[1:14:55] restored and then Jesus can come because
[1:14:59] heaven receives him Heaven holds Jesus
[1:15:01] Jesus constrained there by God's plan
[1:15:04] right he's restrained there until all
[1:15:06] things are restored until every nation
[1:15:08] has heard the message amen heard the
[1:15:10] gospel to every name glory to every name
[1:15:13] that's on that beautiful L's book of
[1:15:15] life has been received the Holy Ghost on
[1:15:17] Earth amen oh and then after that then
[1:15:21] Jesus can come back because the church
[1:15:23] is has been restored it's not a
[1:15:24] different church it's the same church
[1:15:26] restored it's the same church continued
[1:15:28] praise God oh my
[1:15:31] amen thank God I love I love this praise
[1:15:34] God I'm just continuing the same thing
[1:15:37] that was in the book of Acts that's I'm
[1:15:38] just preaching the same thing they did
[1:15:39] in the book of Acts I love it I love I
[1:15:42] don't I don't have to go to school and
[1:15:43] get some new understanding about the
[1:15:45] book of Acts I can just read the book of
[1:15:47] Acts and say that's what I
[1:15:49] believe
[1:15:51] Hallelujah that's a restoration
[1:15:53] scripture there I don't know if that's
[1:15:54] new to you or not but that's where we
[1:15:56] get it and then go to Matthew 1711
[1:15:59] here's another one you pull up there Cas
[1:16:00] it's probably faster than me turning
[1:16:01] there because we're short on time
[1:16:04] here and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:16:06] his the disciples Elijah truly shall
[1:16:09] first come and restore all
[1:16:12] things now brother Ram tells us plainly
[1:16:15] when Moses and Elijah come in the
[1:16:17] tribulation uh Elijah doesn't restore
[1:16:19] the
[1:16:20] law they're not trying to restore the
[1:16:22] law right
[1:16:23] because they're trying to get them to
[1:16:25] Christ they're trying to get them uh to
[1:16:27] weep and mourn from house to
[1:16:29] house right so this speaks of a
[1:16:32] different Elijah and this wasn't John
[1:16:34] the Baptist because John the Baptist
[1:16:35] didn't
[1:16:36] restore the Bible said uh John the
[1:16:39] Baptist declared the way of the Lord he
[1:16:41] made straight the paths of the Lord he's
[1:16:43] a voice in the wilderness crying right
[1:16:46] uh the day of the Lord is at hand I
[1:16:47] believe I mix that up a little bit but
[1:16:49] the voice of one crying in the
[1:16:50] wilderness praise God that was John so
[1:16:52] this has has to be another man who's got
[1:16:54] a prophetic Ministry just like Elijah
[1:16:56] and he restores all things oh hallelujah
[1:17:01] amen see I was in Pentecost and there
[1:17:03] was partially restored we had uh
[1:17:06] justification I guess we didn't have
[1:17:07] sanctification I guess they skipped
[1:17:10] sanctification um because they were
[1:17:12] already rotting right the denomination
[1:17:13] was rotting from the inside but at one
[1:17:15] point they had sanctification remember
[1:17:16] remember William Seymour had
[1:17:18] sanctification remember they believed
[1:17:20] that's how he got that's how they
[1:17:21] eventually got the Holy Ghost he
[1:17:23] believed in total sanctification of
[1:17:25] heart and life remember that that uh the
[1:17:29] black brother who just had sight in one
[1:17:30] eye remember he was he went to a
[1:17:33] wesleyian group and they taught him
[1:17:35] sanctification it's more than just being
[1:17:37] saved we got to live holy too we got to
[1:17:40] get some new thoughts about our lives
[1:17:43] and this is not about me my life's not
[1:17:44] about pleasure my life's not about me
[1:17:46] having fun my life's about serving God
[1:17:48] hallelujah
[1:17:50] amen and now I need the Holy Ghost
[1:17:53] praise God I want my soul on fire
[1:17:56] hallelujah
[1:17:59] amen okay
[1:18:01] now restoration now those are two
[1:18:03] scriptures on restoration and of course
[1:18:06] Joel to I restore sayith the Lord we
[1:18:07] don't have to read that I preach on that
[1:18:11] recently now let me say this too Jesus
[1:18:14] said more blessed are this are are they
[1:18:16] who believe in Christ's Resurrection but
[1:18:19] haven't seen
[1:18:20] it so we get a greater bless bling if we
[1:18:23] believe in Christ yet haven't seen the
[1:18:25] most outstanding Miracles I hope
[1:18:28] somebody can say Amen to that in other
[1:18:30] words it doesn't matter if we didn't see
[1:18:32] brother Ram's Ministry it doesn't matter
[1:18:34] if we saw eyes form in people's sockets
[1:18:37] like some of the the Saints did in
[1:18:39] brother Bram day it doesn't matter as
[1:18:41] long as we believe in it Hallelujah as
[1:18:44] long as we believe in the book of Acts
[1:18:46] Church Jesus said you're more blessed if
[1:18:48] you believe without seeing something but
[1:18:51] God is so gracious if you want to see
[1:18:53] something God will let you see something
[1:18:55] like I said before just hang around hang
[1:18:57] around pretty soon you're going to see
[1:18:58] something
[1:18:59] Hallelujah some Supernatural move of God
[1:19:02] something that is unexplainable amen had
[1:19:05] to be God
[1:19:07] hallelujah but then you'll see you'll
[1:19:09] see it like every just like Israel right
[1:19:10] Israel saw the Red Sea part of but what
[1:19:12] they forgot about it just a few days
[1:19:13] later and church don't you know if God
[1:19:15] does something great for you don't you
[1:19:16] know the enem is going to fight you
[1:19:18] you're probably going to forget about it
[1:19:19] a few days
[1:19:21] later right that that's why the the
[1:19:24] signs don't save us salvation saves us
[1:19:27] repentance water baptism getting a new
[1:19:30] heart instead of a Stony heart a heart
[1:19:31] of Flesh that's what saves us hallelujah
[1:19:34] a new heart but thank God for the signs
[1:19:36] wonders and miracles don't get me wrong
[1:19:37] thank God we need that praise God they
[1:19:39] cause some people to believe I'm just
[1:19:41] saying that's not what saves repentance
[1:19:44] and baptism and trust in Jesus Christ
[1:19:46] the love for the cross that's what saves
[1:19:49] Hallelujah the finished work of Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ Hallelujah and the church said
[1:19:53] amen I'm almost done
[1:19:56] here all this screaming and blabbering
[1:19:59] sorry I guess that's just how I was
[1:20:01] born that's
[1:20:03] true
[1:20:07] Hallelujah okay now I left my book there
[1:20:09] I Clos my Bible okay Acts chapter
[1:20:16] three so Peter preaches his second
[1:20:19] sermon bless
[1:20:21] you now Acts chapter 4 and this is what
[1:20:25] I ended with last time but let's read
[1:20:26] verse 1 2 3 and 4 and as they spake upon
[1:20:29] I'm sorry unto the people the the priest
[1:20:31] and the captain of the temple and the
[1:20:32] Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved
[1:20:35] that they taught the people and preached
[1:20:37] through Jesus the resurrection from the
[1:20:38] dead that's what people don't want you
[1:20:40] to preach that Jesus Christ is
[1:20:42] resurrected and if he's resurrected that
[1:20:45] means he's here hallelujah he's not in
[1:20:48] some school he's not some denomination
[1:20:50] he's here praise God because he said
[1:20:52] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:20:53] of the age praise God they don't want to
[1:20:55] live in Christ they just want to have
[1:20:57] some denominational rules and live by
[1:20:59] that but we got to let Jesus into the
[1:21:01] church praise
[1:21:03] God now verse two or verse three and
[1:21:06] they laid hands on them and put them in
[1:21:07] hold unto the next day for was now even
[1:21:11] tied now many of us will say my I wish I
[1:21:13] could have seen a lame man walk but do
[1:21:15] you also want to get thrown in jail for
[1:21:17] a night would you do that and would you
[1:21:21] pray to God you know wherever you are in
[1:21:22] your most honest place would you be that
[1:21:25] willing to sacrifice to see the
[1:21:29] supernatural it's just something good to
[1:21:32] remember now in this chapter they only
[1:21:35] go to jail for the night they don't get
[1:21:37] beat
[1:21:38] up okay then in verse later on in the
[1:21:43] chapter it says they only get threatened
[1:21:46] let me find that
[1:21:49] verse thought I had it right there oh
[1:21:51] yeah 21 421
[1:21:53] so they spend the night in
[1:21:55] jail all because they just preached and
[1:21:58] they saw a paralyzed man walk and dance
[1:22:01] and leap and Shout praise God they get
[1:22:04] hands L on Malachi can you stand up now
[1:22:06] if if I was going to arrest this guy
[1:22:07] he's bigger than me he could probably
[1:22:08] throw me down right but if I was goingon
[1:22:10] to arrest him how would I do it I'd have
[1:22:11] to get him like this right I say you
[1:22:13] come here I'm gonna throw you in the
[1:22:15] Patty wagon or have to you know grab him
[1:22:17] or something like this if I'm really
[1:22:19] going to arrest him well the the
[1:22:21] disciples got treated like like that now
[1:22:23] Church don't forget this before they
[1:22:24] could do this before they could do this
[1:22:26] now you can take a seat Satan had to go
[1:22:28] up to God and say well they only serve
[1:22:31] you because they got a big church
[1:22:33] 3,000 and God said you can touch them
[1:22:37] but save their life don't kill them yet
[1:22:40] and Satan went off and said all right
[1:22:42] I'm gonna get him now I'm gonna go get
[1:22:44] him I'm gonna throw him in jail and God
[1:22:47] must have said don't beat them all you
[1:22:48] can do is arrest them put them in jail
[1:22:51] for the night now how many want to be a
[1:22:52] real book of Acts
[1:22:54] Church see what I'm saying remember
[1:22:57] Church nothing can happen to you except
[1:22:59] God allowed it
[1:23:01] first God allowed them to push you into
[1:23:03] the prison God allowed you to maybe they
[1:23:05] didn't feed you all night think about
[1:23:07] that I'm not saying we'll ever go
[1:23:08] through that I don't even know we don't
[1:23:09] know when the no man knows the day or
[1:23:10] the hour I'm saying this is this is our
[1:23:13] continuation this is our church and
[1:23:16] brother R said thus sayith the Lord the
[1:23:18] same persecution that Rome put on the
[1:23:20] Christians Is Coming To America thus
[1:23:23] sayith the Lord we know it it's Romans
[1:23:24] I'm sorry it's Revelation chapter 13 the
[1:23:26] mark of the beast being laid
[1:23:29] down Satan said well they only serve you
[1:23:31] because you know they saw fire they saw
[1:23:33] a pillar of fire and they felt the
[1:23:34] rushan Mighty Wind that's the only
[1:23:35] reason they serve you he said fine go
[1:23:38] you can go test them but don't hurt them
[1:23:40] only lock them up in prison that's all
[1:23:42] you can do Satan said all right I'm
[1:23:43] gonna do that well guess what happened a
[1:23:45] few days
[1:23:47] later Satan went back he got more
[1:23:49] permission to beat
[1:23:51] them remember it can't happen unless God
[1:23:53] allowed it and Satan had to ask for it
[1:23:56] too the church said am then church don't
[1:23:59] forget
[1:24:01] later God in his Sovereign will said
[1:24:06] Satan go ahead and take James's
[1:24:10] life and then when and then God God let
[1:24:14] the enemy take James's life he was one
[1:24:16] of the what the second
[1:24:18] martyr and also the same thing God said
[1:24:20] go ahead and take Steven's life devil
[1:24:23] and think about that we would think oh
[1:24:25] these young lives they they were taken
[1:24:27] away but don't forget the honor that
[1:24:29] these men are going to get as well don't
[1:24:31] forget the martyr's
[1:24:33] crown right there's two kinds of crowns
[1:24:35] there's a Crown of Life and there's the
[1:24:36] crown for the martyrs remember I
[1:24:38] preached on that last earlier this
[1:24:42] summer and and don't think Stephen or
[1:24:44] James for one second would say oh it was
[1:24:46] awful you know or oh I wish it never
[1:24:49] would have happened the Bible said they
[1:24:51] were honored to to suffer for the name
[1:24:53] of Jesus Christ it was an
[1:24:57] honor and then think Peter you know
[1:24:59] Peter gets locked locked up in prison
[1:25:02] but but God or Jesus tells the devil you
[1:25:04] can arrest him but don't touch his
[1:25:07] life because he said I'm sending my
[1:25:09] angel I'm not telling you devil I'm
[1:25:10] sending my angels down there to go get
[1:25:12] him out of there praise God Amen because
[1:25:14] he needs to preach Hallelujah and then
[1:25:16] later Peter would mess up with the
[1:25:17] segregation
[1:25:19] right but then he'd get it right he'd
[1:25:21] repent and get things right
[1:25:22] he prayed for people with get the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost all these wonderful things that's
[1:25:26] the book of Acts Church how many
[1:25:27] thankful would be a part of the book of
[1:25:28] Acts
[1:25:30] Church remember brother R said that I
[1:25:32] read this to you last time let me tell
[1:25:33] you if you want the devil stirred up
[1:25:35] just start preaching Divine Healing
[1:25:36] Peter preached on the day of Pentecost
[1:25:38] and 3,000 Souls were saved Satan never
[1:25:40] even moved right they didn't from the
[1:25:42] day of Pentecost till that day where the
[1:25:44] man was healed we don't hear of any
[1:25:46] persecution on them it only came so
[1:25:49] Satan didn't Satan didn't bother their
[1:25:51] Revival services
[1:25:53] Satan didn't bother their water baptism
[1:25:56] Services he only got upset when the
[1:25:59] supernatural Miracle started happen that
[1:26:01] would convince some people to believe
[1:26:04] that's when he got
[1:26:07] upset he said a couple days afterwards
[1:26:09] he healed a man at the gate called
[1:26:10] Beautiful who was lame and all hell
[1:26:13] turned loose on him but what was the
[1:26:15] hell that turned loose it was grabbing
[1:26:17] him like I grabbed Malachi grabbing him
[1:26:20] and pulling off the prison locking him
[1:26:22] up and not letting him out for a whole
[1:26:23] night and then threatening him don't you
[1:26:26] ever preach don't you ever teach in that
[1:26:27] name again you you can go
[1:26:30] now that was all hell breaking loose on
[1:26:33] the early
[1:26:34] church but did the church persevere did
[1:26:37] the church overcome did the church give
[1:26:40] up well you know what they did what'
[1:26:41] they do right after they got thrown out
[1:26:43] what they do they go cry about it no
[1:26:44] they went to have a prayer
[1:26:46] meeting and what were they praying for
[1:26:48] God give us more boldness in other words
[1:26:50] help us to overcome the fear of dying
[1:26:53] help us to overcome a fear of more
[1:26:55] persecution give us boldness to keep
[1:26:57] teaching and preaching and stretch out
[1:26:59] forth your hand to heal with signs
[1:27:02] wonders and miracles what they just
[1:27:03] wanted more of God they just wanted
[1:27:05] God's will done in their life no matter
[1:27:07] the cost praise God let's stand to our
[1:27:09] feet musicians you can

[1:27:32] of Acts Church did this did this help
[1:27:34] somebody tonight by God's
[1:27:36] grace I felt like the Holy Spirit gave
[1:27:38] me that thought about how Satan had to
[1:27:39] go and ask permission for each one of
[1:27:41] those
[1:27:43] disciples where you been devil I've been
[1:27:45] wandering around the earth he said have
[1:27:47] you considered my servant

[1:27:52] John well you just they saw the pillar
[1:27:55] of fire they s they felt the rush of
[1:27:57] Mighty Wind he said let me throw them in
[1:28:00] jail let's see if they'll praise you he
[1:28:02] said go ahead throw him in jail don't
[1:28:03] beat
[1:28:05] him but the next time God said go ahead
