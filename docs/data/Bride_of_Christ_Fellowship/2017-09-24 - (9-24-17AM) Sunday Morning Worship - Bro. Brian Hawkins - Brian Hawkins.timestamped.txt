[15:38] thank you appreciate all that you do
[15:40] everything that you provide and Lord you
[15:43] see fit to meet each and every one of
[15:45] our needs like the brother said whether
[15:46] its financial or whether it's an
[15:48] encouragement whether it's a healing
[15:51] touch we have need up in our bodies is
[15:54] Lord we singing that song only believe
[15:56] that's all we need to do learn is to
[15:58] believe in that state in your word and
[16:01] faith into your promise of God faith
[16:03] that you are who you say you are oh God
[16:07] Gouri just our faith is anchored in what
[16:11] you've told us in your scriptures oh god
[16:12] there's something within us that just
[16:14] tells us that it makes a heart to say
[16:17] Amen oh God
[16:18] there's just something within us that
[16:19] telling us I know this is right I know
[16:21] that I can obtain it I know that there's
[16:23] something there there's something that I
[16:25] can receive from God there's there's an
[16:27] entity there and then all I had to do is
[16:29] reach out and touch them just think of
[16:31] that woman that all she wanted to do is
[16:33] reach out and it touched Jesus that hem
[16:35] of Jesus garment that she was made home
[16:37] didn't have that faith this morning just
[16:39] to reach out to Jesus Christ was born
[16:41] then we could touch him or he is a high
[16:43] priests of the feeling of our
[16:44] infirmities he knows what how we feel in
[16:47] our pain situation he knows how we feel
[16:49] in our in our needs are
[16:51] and whatever it might be he understands
[16:55] those because he came down into flesh as
[16:57] a man to experience those things because
[16:59] his God of the Spirit II didn't know how
[17:01] it was but Lord we just appreciate that
[17:04] the promises that you've given us and we
[17:06] thank you for lending us a better year
[17:09] here to hear our our petitions for bring
[17:11] it forth before you this morning Oh God
[17:13] Lord as we open up your scripture open
[17:15] up your word this morning we just pray
[17:16] the to it that you would bless the word
[17:18] the reading of the word and the
[17:19] administering of your word this one I
[17:22] just asked for your blessing spirit to
[17:23] cover though I think to speak to your
[17:25] children to speak to your people to
[17:27] speak to your bride here this morning Oh
[17:29] God there's nothing good with Timmy Lord
[17:33] there's there's no great skill that I
[17:35] have to come and preach the Word of God
[17:37] but lord I do believe that it's the
[17:39] calling that you've laid upon me this
[17:41] morning that's my life this morning I
[17:43] just pray the tuba company to get out of
[17:44] the way the Lord more importantly help
[17:46] to each and every one of us to get out
[17:48] of the way that we each one of us can
[17:50] hear the word coming forth to our hearts
[17:52] with smoke up Lord we love you and we
[17:54] appreciate you bless brother Jesse
[17:56] wherever he may be better straight and I
[17:58] believe it's in New York somewhere I'm
[17:59] not sure but when Lord you know exactly
[18:01] where your people are and then we just
[18:03] pray that you'd just be with him
[18:05] wherever he is just want to be with our
[18:07] pastor as he ministers today unless your
[18:11] bride all the way around the world Oh
[18:12] God how pray that you would speak
[18:14] something to somebody's heart this order
[18:15] of God that it's the condition of
[18:18] backsliding whatever it might might be
[18:21] the Lord I know that you could address
[18:22] the needs this corner for you have
[18:24] you've done it so many times before and
[18:26] I'm just counting on you this morning
[18:27] then Jesus Christ thing we ask if I
[18:49] don't get you some spices we don't want
[18:59] you falling asleep anyway
[19:02] he would turn to Matthew 25 usually if I
[19:13] get to more my kids pretty sleepy if I
[19:21] said still 5 and verse 1 it says then
[19:34] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[19:35] unto ten virgins which took their lamps
[19:38] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[19:39] and five of them were wise and five were
[19:42] foolish they that were foolish took
[19:45] their lamps and took no oil with them
[19:47] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[19:51] with with their lamps while the
[19:54] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[19:55] and slept and at midnight there was a
[19:59] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[20:02] ye out to meet him then all those
[20:05] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
[20:07] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[20:10] us of your oil for our lamps are going
[20:13] out but the wise answered saying not so
[20:16] lest there be not enough for us and you
[20:19] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[20:22] buy for yourselves and while they went
[20:25] to buy the bridegroom came and they that
[20:28] were ready went in with him to the
[20:30] marriage and the door was shut
[20:33] afterward came also the other virgins
[20:36] saying Lord Lord open to us but he
[20:39] answered and said verily I say unto you
[20:41] I know you not watch therefore for you
[20:44] know neither the day nor the hour
[20:46] wherein the Son of man cometh thank you
[20:49] you may be seated for real this time but
[20:55] I just hope you don't think to yourself
[20:56] this morning as we read the scripture
[20:57] because this has being covered so many
[20:59] times it should be a very familiar
[21:01] scripture to everybody that though oh no
[21:03] here he goes on the on the five foolish
[21:05] and and the five wise virgins again you
[21:07] know but one thing we can't let this
[21:11] work do is just to become a commonplace
[21:13] to us but something I want you to pay
[21:15] institute is when the bridegroom came
[21:17] out that only five of these ten virgins
[21:21] were ready for the coming and five were
[21:25] not ready so what I'd like to speak on
[21:27] this morning is a day late and
[21:31] disappointed but as we read through this
[21:35] each of these virgins had a choice to
[21:37] make it wasn't something that was
[21:39] automatically the oil wasn't just later
[21:41] in their laps and say and take thy knees
[21:43] and just just wait for the call to come
[21:45] and when the call comes that you'll be
[21:46] ready it didn't happen that way there's
[21:48] a choice that had to be made five were
[21:50] wise that they already had the oil they
[21:52] were prepared the other five didn't have
[21:55] the oil they were unprepared so that's
[21:57] the differences one was ready one was
[21:59] not one group was ready one group was
[22:01] not but if I believe and we're
[22:03] anticipation to meet the bridegroom the
[22:05] other five were just sitting in the
[22:06] background procrastinating half
[22:08] expecting the bridegroom to be real and
[22:10] actually show up so that's the condition
[22:12] that they were in is they weren't
[22:14] exactly sure if that bright bird they
[22:15] heard about the bridegroom but they
[22:17] didn't know if he was real or not no I'm
[22:19] just kind of speculating I don't mean to
[22:20] add or take away but just kind of enter
[22:24] in the way that I think a little bit
[22:28] just kind of picture these virgins in
[22:30] the background they're just you ever get
[22:33] into that spot where you well I don't
[22:34] know if the Lord why why am i walking
[22:36] this walk is this is this really real
[22:39] and so you go to church service service
[22:42] after service and you're around people
[22:44] and you you might be pretending that
[22:46] you're that you're a believer I don't
[22:48] know the position that everybody's in I
[22:50] don't know your heart I don't know the
[22:51] type of life that you live my privilege
[22:54] is I get to come in and visit once in a
[22:57] while and say some things that if Lord
[22:59] hits your heart then then move on with
[23:01] it take it accept it and move on with
[23:04] the Lord and man but you get into that
[23:06] spot well I don't know if God is really
[23:08] real or not I don't know if I could
[23:09] really receive the healing or not it the
[23:11] promises laid laid here for me they say
[23:15] that I could be healed if I could just
[23:17] believe in the Lord Jesus but I'm not
[23:18] healed yet well you haven't given your
[23:20] whole self to God yet you haven't given
[23:21] that whole faith you haven't actually
[23:23] believed that he is who he is so therein
[23:27] lies that problem is you
[23:28] got the half half faith and a half doubt
[23:30] those times that you're up on the mound
[23:32] you've got the faith that you feel that
[23:34] you can conquer all but down in the
[23:35] valley you have that doubt well you got
[23:37] to have that same faith that's up on the
[23:39] mountaintop you gotta have that same
[23:40] faith down in the valley to get you out
[23:42] of the valley so these these five
[23:46] foolish words were procrastinating half
[23:47] expecting the bridegroom to be real and
[23:49] actually show up you know we've heard so
[23:53] many times that that the end is near get
[23:55] ready the the the end time is coming
[23:57] well the thing is is we don't know
[23:59] exactly when when it's going to be
[24:01] coming so we continue to make ourselves
[24:02] or try to get ourselves grooving and
[24:04] ready for that coming because we don't
[24:06] know when it's coming we don't know the
[24:07] hour we don't know the day and all these
[24:09] people that that that think that they
[24:12] have the revelation or I know the day
[24:13] it's going to be September 23rd of
[24:15] whatever year we're on I think I just
[24:18] heard another one I think it was
[24:19] September 23rd so all these people they
[24:22] say well it's going to be November oh
[24:23] it's going to be whatever it is it's a
[24:27] false prophecy it's a false revelation
[24:31] because even Jesus didn't know the day
[24:33] or the hour and he had a closer
[24:35] relationship with with the father than
[24:37] what we did so all these things we don't
[24:42] know but we have to be ready we must be
[24:46] fully persuaded in some cases this is
[24:49] okay but that you that you kind of have
[24:52] to expect some things but not this this
[24:54] is a matter of life and death a matter
[24:56] of where you're going to spend eternity
[24:58] is that right
[24:59] but Matthew 24 and verse 42 it says
[25:03] watch therefore for you know not what
[25:06] hour your Lord doth come but know this
[25:08] if the Goodman of the house had known in
[25:11] what watch the thief would come he would
[25:13] have watched him would not have suffered
[25:14] his house to be broken up now you take a
[25:18] US citizen if he knew what time the
[25:21] thief was going to come into his house
[25:22] he'd be calling the National Guard he'd
[25:24] be calling Army Reserves he'd be calling
[25:26] the police state troopers whatever it
[25:28] might be at every window would be loaded
[25:29] with a firearm waiting for that thief to
[25:31] come but that's if he knew when that
[25:33] thief was going to be coming because
[25:34] he'd be prepared waiting for that thief
[25:37] to give that thief what he had come so
[25:40] the same thing we must be ready with the
[25:42] same
[25:42] of anticipation to keep to keep those
[25:46] that would try to influence us out of
[25:48] this rapture out of this this walk with
[25:50] the Lord out of this blessed gospel that
[25:52] we should hold so dear now because there
[25:55] are people they're going to try to talk
[25:57] you out of it I'm sure you've already
[25:58] encountered them already look at I don't
[26:02] have to tell you you can see what's
[26:03] happening in this day you just turn on
[26:05] the news a little bit and you can see
[26:07] what's happening they're trying to get
[26:09] rid of they're trying to get rid of us
[26:11] all together
[26:12] but in verse 44 says therefore be also
[26:16] ready from in such an hour as you think
[26:18] not the Son of man cometh who then is a
[26:22] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[26:24] have made ruler over his household to
[26:26] give them meat and due season blessed is
[26:28] that servant whom his Lord when he
[26:30] cometh shall find so doing that is a
[26:32] responsible servant that is a
[26:34] responsible disciple when he's contented
[26:36] continuing to make himself ready
[26:38] continuing to stay steadfast in the Word
[26:40] of God verily I say unto you that he
[26:44] shall make him a ruler over all his
[26:45] goods isn't it nice to know that we're
[26:47] gonna go somewhere he's got a mansion
[26:48] prepare for us and we're gonna rule and
[26:50] reign with him amen he was kind of
[26:53] laying out what he has in store for us
[26:54] those that follow his commandments those
[26:56] that follow into the way and the truth
[26:58] of the life the truth of the way but and
[27:01] if that evil servant shall say in his
[27:04] heart my lord delayeth his coming and
[27:07] shall begin to smite his fellow servants
[27:09] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[27:11] the lord of that servant shall come in a
[27:13] day when he looketh not for him and in
[27:15] an hour that he is not aware of and
[27:17] shall cut him asunder and appoint him
[27:19] his portion with the hypocrites there
[27:22] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[27:24] now you go in first forty nine it says
[27:26] it shall begin to smite his fellow
[27:28] servants and eat and drink with the
[27:30] drunken do we not see that in this hour
[27:32] that the people that used to go to
[27:34] church now they got tired of waiting
[27:36] they have fallen away they have left the
[27:38] faith they have left God and now they
[27:40] come and persecute those that are stayed
[27:42] and remain faithful they're starting to
[27:44] smite the service because their patience
[27:46] has run out they can't wait any longer
[27:48] amen
[27:49] but you might think there's messages for
[27:53] the unconverted but
[27:55] I'm trying to talk to those that have
[27:57] been once enlightened it still applies
[27:59] to the unconverted also I don't I don't
[28:01] know everybody in here but uh but you
[28:04] may think that you have time to get
[28:06] right but there's there's a it
[28:08] Ecclesiastes 3 says to everything there
[28:11] is a season any time to every purpose
[28:13] under the heaven a time to be born and a
[28:16] time to die a time to plant at a time to
[28:18] pluck up that which is planted a time to
[28:21] kill and a time to heal a time to break
[28:24] down and a time to build up a time to
[28:26] weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn
[28:28] and a time to dance now we know Jesus
[28:31] said those that weep now shall rejoice
[28:33] later amen so a time to cast away stones
[28:37] and a time to gather stones together a
[28:39] time to embrace and a time to refrain
[28:41] from embracing a time to get and a time
[28:44] to lose a time to keep and a time to
[28:47] cast away
[28:48] a time to Rend and a time to sow a time
[28:51] to keep silence and a time to speak die
[28:53] pay attention to that one we're going to
[28:55] try to get into that a little bit not
[28:56] not specifically but I hope you get it
[28:59] this morning but a time to love and a
[29:01] time to hate a time of war and a time of
[29:04] peace now again I don't want to try to
[29:06] add or take anything away but there's a
[29:08] time of play and there's a time of work
[29:10] you kind of get that you kind of get
[29:12] that in Ecclesiastes it doesn't exactly
[29:15] say it that way but there's a time to
[29:17] play and there's a time to work by the
[29:18] time the play is passed
[29:20] now it's time to work and we must work
[29:22] diligently to get ourselves ready is
[29:24] that right but we should see in this day
[29:27] that that it's getting so close at play
[29:33] time we can't play time anymore we
[29:35] should be we should be entering into
[29:37] we're women that mature bride that he's
[29:40] looking for it's we've come too far to
[29:42] turn back now is that is that right you
[29:44] know who wants to turn back now after
[29:46] all that I've done and let's say I gave
[29:48] I was baptized in 2002 so 15 years I
[29:51] spent 15 years trying to come this far
[29:54] that the Lord has brought me why would I
[29:56] want to turn back now
[29:57] all the work that's gone into it all the
[29:59] trials although all the tribulation all
[30:01] the battles that I've faced was it in
[30:03] vain for me to turn back now but
[30:08] but you may say well what do you mean I
[30:11] must get ready I'm always told that I
[30:12] can't do anything for salvation that's
[30:15] right you can't do anything for
[30:16] salvation I'm not talking about
[30:18] salvation salvation is is deliverance to
[30:21] unpack the baggage of worldly things so
[30:23] you could get ready for rapture
[30:25] salvation is of deliverance you removed
[30:28] whether it's smoking drinking cussing
[30:31] riotous living whatever it might be
[30:33] that's salvation salvation is
[30:35] deliverance it's taking you it's taking
[30:37] that baggage off of you so you don't
[30:38] have to carry that weight anymore you
[30:40] can make the journey with other without
[30:42] on all that extra baggage is that right
[30:45] but when you get ready for supper you go
[30:47] in and clean yourself up you wash your
[30:49] hands or whatever you need to do to get
[30:51] yourself prepared to eat a meal now when
[30:55] you go somewhere special like a a
[30:56] wedding supper there's more involved to
[30:59] get ready it's not enough to say I spoke
[31:02] in tongues it's not enough to say I
[31:03] prophesied it's not enough to say I pray
[31:05] for so-and-so and they were healed it's
[31:07] not enough to say I spoke in tongues
[31:10] it's not enough for all that it's not
[31:14] enough to say that God sent a prophet
[31:16] because it's more than the Prophet and
[31:17] it's more than tongues and more than
[31:19] prophesying or even healing it's more
[31:22] than that the rapture is the brides
[31:25] revelation it's a revelation to the
[31:28] bride the rapture is our preparedness
[31:30] for revelations tells us the bride has
[31:33] made herself ready
[31:35] someone when some women have to get
[31:37] themselves all dull now I'm not going to
[31:39] try to knock women so don't think I'm
[31:41] going to do that but some women have to
[31:44] get themselves all dolled up before they
[31:46] go anywhere or the show their faces
[31:47] anyone if someone if the salesman was to
[31:50] come knocking on the door and they just
[31:51] the woman just gets out of bed they're
[31:53] not going to go run it to the door they
[31:55] gotta go make themselves ready to
[31:58] presentable amen so they're making
[32:02] themselves ready to face them the world
[32:04] that day but there are other women that
[32:06] are working on their character to face
[32:08] her Lord on that great day amen so
[32:12] there's a difference between a godly
[32:13] woman and a worldly woman a worldly
[32:15] woman is getting all dolled up too so
[32:17] she can uh I don't know make me make men
[32:20] desire after or make
[32:22] other people that sure is one pretty
[32:24] woman but you know I was just talking to
[32:25] some young girls I think it was
[32:27] yesterday just talking to him I asked
[32:30] them now it's a personal question when
[32:32] you talk to to the girls and I
[32:34] understand that when you ask them well
[32:35] do you have any do you have any desire
[32:38] to put on makeup and and stuff like that
[32:41] you know and out of not to be shamed
[32:45] into anything that they might they might
[32:47] fire off real quick no I I don't want to
[32:50] have that desire you know I you know how
[32:52] you get you get defensive because you
[32:54] don't want to admit to anything so I'm
[32:57] not saying this is what they were doing
[32:58] but I just told him I said you don't
[33:00] have to tell me if you don't want to but
[33:02] just to tell them my perspective before
[33:05] I was saved and you could ask my wife I
[33:08] didn't like makeup back then and I don't
[33:10] like makeup now and I told these young
[33:13] girls I said I'll tell you something
[33:15] about makeup it stinks I couldn't stay
[33:20] in the smell of it you'd ask my wife I'd
[33:23] always tell her cars but I think a woman
[33:28] looks more beautiful in her natural
[33:30] appearance and you know these women they
[33:32] try to put on all this makeup to look
[33:34] pretty because they think the men like
[33:36] it you talk to most men most men don't
[33:38] like makeup a lot of a lot of men don't
[33:41] like makeup I've talked to a lot of guys
[33:43] and they don't they don't like the
[33:44] makeup either so the women are putting
[33:47] it on in vain because a lot of men don't
[33:48] like it but there's a preparedness we're
[33:55] working on our character in this day
[33:57] we're not so much about it worried about
[33:59] our our natural appearance or at least
[34:01] we shouldn't be yeah you want to make
[34:03] yourself presentable you don't want to
[34:04] go out look at like a slob if you're
[34:06] going out for a job interview I'm not
[34:08] talking about that I mean there's a time
[34:10] to go out and make yourself presentable
[34:11] but there's a time when it become so
[34:13] vain to you that's all you think about
[34:15] is being so pretty and why you're trying
[34:18] to make yourself look pretty you know
[34:20] it's okay to to put on a suit and tie
[34:22] comb your hair because you want to make
[34:24] yourself presentable because you want a
[34:25] job it might be a banking job where you
[34:27] have to deal with people customer
[34:30] service or something it might be a
[34:31] Walmart greeter you know they don't want
[34:33] somebody with their you know looking
[34:35] shabby they want somebody that looks
[34:37] presentable the Lord Jesus isn't gonna
[34:39] want some shabby look a woman that is
[34:42] unkempt it doesn't take care of herself
[34:44] she hasn't worked on her character she's
[34:47] looking for somebody who's worked on
[34:48] that character a man
[34:49] her brother branham said that's the only
[34:51] thing we're gonna take with us I do
[34:52] believe but you can't sell or you can't
[34:58] share your character each person has to
[35:01] develop their own character so when he
[35:03] comes
[35:04] there's no time to develop it it has to
[35:06] be ready for when he comes as a thief in
[35:08] the night
[35:08] now I'm sure you I'm pretty sure I've
[35:12] said it here but back in when I was in
[35:14] the military we had where there were
[35:16] mobility bags you had to have all your
[35:18] all your uh your uniforms that you that
[35:21] you might have needed you had to have
[35:22] that in there all your toiletries your
[35:24] soap shampoo all that stuff you had to
[35:26] have some of that in your bag because as
[35:28] soon as they call you got to go you have
[35:31] 24 hours to respond and and when you're
[35:33] called to to go serve in a war you don't
[35:35] have time for all that other stuff so
[35:37] that's why you're supposed to have a
[35:38] mobility bag ready so all you have to do
[35:40] is grab that bag and you go get ready
[35:42] for your deployment same thing no you
[35:44] got to have you got to have your
[35:45] backpack you got to have everything
[35:47] ready in line for that time when he
[35:49] comes and says come with me now we know
[35:57] that the word rapture is not in the
[36:00] Bible everybody knows that because when
[36:02] you start arguing about why not argue
[36:04] when you have it discussion about
[36:06] Trinity with somebody they you might say
[36:08] well Trinity is not in the Bible well
[36:10] some of them shoot right back well
[36:12] rapture is not in the Bible either well
[36:14] yes it is the definition of it is in the
[36:18] in the Bible the actual word rapture is
[36:22] not in the scripture but first let alone
[36:26] ian's 4:17 it says then which we then we
[36:30] which are alive and remain shall be
[36:32] caught up together with them in the
[36:35] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[36:37] so shall we ever be with the Lord now
[36:41] what is the definition of a rapture this
[36:45] was out of the lexicon it means to
[36:49] sieze carry off by force to seize on
[36:53] claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out
[36:56] or away cut up your getting taken away
[37:02] this is the free dictionary so it could
[37:11] be unbeliever putting the making these
[37:12] definitions I don't know but we'll read
[37:14] what they have to say anyway the
[37:17] transporting of a person from one place
[37:19] to another especially to heaven by
[37:22] supernatural means rapture an event in
[37:27] the I'm not even going to be able to
[37:30] pronounce that name I'm not a scholar so
[37:34] es CH aetiology so assault eschatology
[37:41] I'm not sure what it is I should have
[37:43] looked it up I usually do but I'd I
[37:44] think I read at a time but of certain
[37:48] Christian groups in which believers in
[37:50] Christ will be taken up to heaven either
[37:52] prior to or at the Second Coming now I'm
[37:57] sure many of you have thought to
[37:58] yourselves you know especially new
[38:00] converts or even when we get stuck stuck
[38:04] in a rut we we tend to think why I mean
[38:08] Lord why did you choose me I'm so full
[38:11] of faults and failures I have nothing to
[38:13] bring how am I going to go in a rapture
[38:17] how is it that you would even be
[38:18] remotely interested in me anybody ever
[38:24] think that it's okay to be honest this
[38:29] morning I'm I'm honest with you all well
[38:35] you might say why me Lord I'm not worthy
[38:36] for you to choose me but I thank you for
[38:38] it I'm not worthy for you to come visit
[38:40] me
[38:41] just like the Centurion you know even
[38:44] the Centurion said Jesus told I'm come
[38:47] to your house he says oh no I'm not even
[38:49] worthy for you to even enter in through
[38:51] the the door of my house I'm not worthy
[38:53] of but see that's a humility it's just
[39:02] like we could relay
[39:03] - that that Centurion that said I'm not
[39:05] even worthy for you to come we could
[39:07] also relate to that man that was at the
[39:09] Pool of Bethesda is that right uh-uh all
[39:12] those people you know when when the Lord
[39:14] came up to me says well why aren't you
[39:16] here how come you're not going into the
[39:17] pool he says I have no man to help me
[39:19] but out of all those people Jesus chose
[39:24] that one man and of all those people in
[39:27] there to heal to even talk to and he
[39:30] even gives the privilege of healing so I
[39:32] could imagine in his mind why me why did
[39:35] you choose me I'm not worthy of it
[39:37] oh my but we truly are not worthy of his
[39:42] love for we or not
[39:43] we were not a people according to 1st
[39:45] Peter excuse me but we were not a people
[39:48] but now are we the sons and daughters of
[39:50] God which makes us worthy by His
[39:52] righteousness we were not his people in
[39:55] time past but since Jesus came into my
[39:58] heart I am his you are his you know I
[40:02] wasn't going to talk on this but I just
[40:06] came across something I just feel - to
[40:09] say just an experience that I've had
[40:11] talking to somebody not physically but I
[40:16] was on Facebook I wasn't being honest it
[40:18] was on Facebook and somebody had they
[40:22] were talking about tape ministry and and
[40:24] well something came up about revelations
[40:27] 23 and there's only 22 chapters in
[40:31] Revelations but I think they're their
[40:33] reference and I'm not trying to belittle
[40:35] anybody by any means I'm getting to
[40:37] something uh wherever they get this this
[40:40] doctor and I don't know for sure but
[40:44] talking you know just she was talking
[40:49] about brother Branham how he could how
[40:51] he could be revelation 23 and then she
[40:56] went on to say well he's Bible he's in
[40:59] the scripture and I set my reply but at
[41:02] the end I wanted to tell her I said you
[41:04] know I don't believe that brother
[41:06] Branham would be revelations 20 through
[41:08] 23 but I said you say that he is in the
[41:14] Bible because you believe that he's
[41:15] revelation 23
[41:16] you know you also are scripture you also
[41:20] were in the Bible you know people want
[41:22] to try to put brother Brandon way up
[41:24] here and they say he's in the Bible he's
[41:25] in the Bible and and they just talk him
[41:28] up so much that I think they forget
[41:30] about themselves well well you're also
[41:32] in the Bible are you not the pearl of
[41:34] great price are you not the Bride of
[41:35] Christ when revelation 22 where it says
[41:37] the spirit and the bride say come
[41:39] are you not part of the bride if you if
[41:42] you don't feel that you're part of the
[41:43] bride and now sometimes I don't feel
[41:45] that I'm part of the bride because I
[41:46] make false but we've got to have that
[41:49] faith if we can't have enough faith to
[41:51] for a headache how are we gonna have
[41:53] enough faith to to go into a rapture
[41:55] amen so you're just as much Scripture as
[41:58] brother Brandon with Scripture
[42:00] as Jesus Christ as a scripture if you
[42:02] are grounded in faith in Jesus Christ
[42:04] you are just as much Scripture now she
[42:10] went on to say something about preachers
[42:12] I know about preachers and I haven't got
[42:14] a response back yet but but what do you
[42:16] know about preachers brother Branham was
[42:18] I know I'm treading on dangerous ground
[42:20] depending on who you talk to but brother
[42:23] Branham made mistakes just just like we
[42:25] as laity or ministry with it you know he
[42:27] made mistakes just as just as well as we
[42:29] did so what we ought to do is exalt
[42:32] Jesus Christ above any man of this land
[42:35] I don't I don't care what man it is I
[42:37] don't care if it's Donald Trump I don't
[42:38] care if it's Barack Obama I don't care
[42:40] if it's Putin over there and I don't
[42:42] care who it is
[42:43] hey Jesus Christ there's one that ought
[42:44] to be exalted more than anybody amen I
[42:48] know because she said something that
[42:50] probably won't leave me astray and uh
[42:51] well Jesus Christ won't lead me astray
[42:54] hey man so I have one that's a little
[42:56] bit well a lot more important then you
[43:00] understand what I'm saying is uh so
[43:02] brother branham even spoke about he
[43:05] exalted Jesus Christ he put Jesus Christ
[43:08] up here we ought to do the same now so
[43:11] we exalt ourselves no because he who
[43:14] exalts himself shall be abased amen so
[43:17] we don't want to have that pride and say
[43:19] well I'm better than so so no it's not
[43:21] like that
[43:24] is that okay this morning
[43:27] I'm sure bill Jesse feels the same way
[43:29] as I do
[43:30] I just think God that I'm one of his
[43:40] maybe we sing that song I'm one of them
[43:42] on one of them so if you're one of them
[43:44] you're in the scripture too but we as
[43:51] men we it is uh we think well I'm not
[43:55] worthy of that how can I say that well
[43:58] you know even even the Devils in the
[44:00] scripture yeah I mean why can't you
[44:03] place yourself in the scripture you know
[44:06] by His stripes Brian Hawkins is healed
[44:08] by his stripes
[44:09] brother John Graham is healed no so what
[44:13] was that young man he or he was talking
[44:15] about put yourself in this scripture you
[44:17] know because he is talked about you if
[44:19] that's a promising in your heart you
[44:20] could say Amen you can relate to it I
[44:22] can relate to that scripture that's for
[44:24] me well put your name in there and you
[44:26] repeat it over and over and over again
[44:27] and then that that's the way brother
[44:29] Brant Artie says if you want to if you
[44:31] want him you say I'm healed and you keep
[44:33] repeating it until you believe it amen
[44:37] because I'm here to tell you the
[44:40] adversary is going to be right there
[44:41] behind it and pound it you're not healed
[44:43] pounded you're not healed you're not
[44:45] healed so you have to combat it well yes
[44:47] I am yes I am God will provide for me
[44:50] he's Jehovah Jireh
[44:52] mr. Oliver Sharma his job all these
[44:55] different names are redemptive names of
[44:57] Jehovah God is still God just because
[45:00] somebody's telling you that he's not
[45:01] just because you say heaven isn't for
[45:03] real doesn't mean that it's not for real
[45:05] it says say you don't believe it I'm not
[45:08] I'm not entering his gates by someone
[45:11] else's opinion it has to be my
[45:13] experience amen
[45:15] but they when we read that blessed word
[45:18] our heart said Amen not everyone has
[45:21] that wonderful privilege no matter how
[45:23] much truth you set before them you can
[45:25] drown somebody in truth and they still
[45:27] might not see it but it won't make a
[45:30] difference if they won't accept it they
[45:33] must come God's provided way there are
[45:36] no shortcuts no cliffnotes no cheat
[45:38] sheets or any special treatment forgot
[45:40] not a respecter of persons he has sent
[45:43] his message now we must receive it or be
[45:46] left behind it's cut and dry there's no
[45:49] grayer
[45:53] Jesus told a parable about uh Moses in
[45:57] the prophets and I don't even know what
[45:58] time it was a contractor
[46:00] are y'all worried about time let's see
[46:09] we're in Luke chapter 16 and verse 22 it
[46:16] says and it came to pass that the that
[46:18] the beggar died and was carried by the
[46:19] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[46:22] also died and was buried and in hell he
[46:25] lift up his eyes being in torments and
[46:27] seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus
[46:30] Lazarus and his bosom and he cried and
[46:33] said father Abraham have mercy on me and
[46:35] send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of
[46:38] his finger in water and cool my tongue
[46:40] for I am tormented in this flame
[46:43] but Abraham said son remember that thou
[46:46] in my lifetime receive a sight good
[46:48] things and likewise Lazarus evil things
[46:50] but now he is comforted and now our
[46:54] tormented the tables have turned so and
[47:00] beside all this between us and you there
[47:03] is a great gulf fixed so that they which
[47:06] would pass from hence to you cannot
[47:08] neither can they pass to us that would
[47:10] come from there then then he said I pray
[47:14] thee therefore father that that would
[47:16] have sent him to my father's house for I
[47:19] have five brethren that he may testify
[47:21] unto them lest they also come into this
[47:24] place of torment abraham saith unto him
[47:28] they have Moses and the prophets let
[47:32] them hear them and he said nay father
[47:37] Abraham but if one went unto them from
[47:39] the dead they will repent and he said
[47:42] unto them if they hear not Moses and the
[47:44] prophets neither will they be persuaded
[47:46] though one rose from the dead so no
[47:49] matter what miracles no matter what
[47:50] testimony that you try to tell these
[47:52] people no matter how
[47:53] it's truth you lay before them if they
[47:55] can't say it they're not going to say it
[47:57] if they can't see it they can't accept
[47:58] it so blessed are our eyes that we could
[48:04] see blessed is our spirit that has been
[48:07] renewed amen
[48:12] but the problem is is people don't
[48:14] believe what they say they believe so
[48:16] surely they don't live what they say
[48:18] they believe they will be sadly
[48:19] disappointed on that day this is what
[48:22] brother Branham says in Satan's Eden it
[48:26] says and again it is religious sin as at
[48:29] the beginning so deceitful watch it now
[48:32] it's not just purely old everyday sin
[48:35] committing adultery and getting drunk
[48:37] and using God's name in vain that's not
[48:40] it
[48:40] no you remember years ago many of you
[48:43] hear the old timers remember that sermon
[48:45] I preached on and I tried to find this
[48:47] where I can't find it unless it's a
[48:49] different title it says the
[48:50] disappointments at judgment the harlot
[48:54] she ain't gonna be she ain't going to be
[48:57] disappointed there she knows where she
[48:59] is going
[48:59] the drunkard ain't going to be
[49:00] disappointed there the bootlegger the
[49:02] gambler the liar the thief he is not
[49:04] going to be disappointed but the man who
[49:07] thinks he's right there's the
[49:08] disappointment that's the fella say come
[49:12] say Lord heaven I preached the gospel
[49:14] have not I cast out devils in thy name
[49:16] and Jesus said depart from me ye that
[49:19] work iniquity I never even knew you
[49:22] there's the disappointment see the
[49:25] deceitfulness that's uh he says that's
[49:30] where I'm so misunderstood it's not that
[49:32] I want to be different I don't want to
[49:34] be different but I've got to be honest I
[49:36] have a message and that must go to the
[49:39] people makes it very much misunderstood
[49:42] of much the people they think I'm
[49:44] against everybody they only know I'm for
[49:47] everybody and trying my best to bring
[49:49] them to what's the truth just as its
[49:52] laid on my heart and the way it's laid
[49:54] in the Bible here so people thought that
[49:57] he didn't like them and that he didn't
[49:59] like women that he didn't like them that
[50:01] he didn't like the people but he loved
[50:03] him he wanted to set them in the
[50:05] straight path amen he wanted
[50:07] to correct the errors and God proves
[50:09] that to be the truth so there is nothing
[50:11] else can be done about it so be they
[50:14] look at it or they don't you know a lot
[50:17] of times I worry about you know trying
[50:20] to to give a testimony or try to talk to
[50:23] somebody and then I'm thinking of my
[50:24] heart well well what if they don't see
[50:27] it you know how come I come I can't get
[50:31] people converted because no matter what
[50:35] you say like I said you could drown
[50:38] somebody in truth you can have you
[50:41] conceived a testimony after testimony
[50:42] after testimony what is it a prophet
[50:46] visit South Africa or some of the book
[50:48] is just full of testimonies and uh they
[50:52] could read that they could see that they
[50:54] could hear that but it doesn't mean that
[50:55] they're going to believe it which is sad
[50:59] because it's it's it's frustrating
[51:02] because you try to you try to persuade
[51:04] people but we don't want to talk people
[51:06] into a false birth you know so you got
[51:09] to be careful in that aspect that you
[51:10] don't push and push and push and push to
[51:12] where they get tired of okay I'll give
[51:14] in to what you're saying because we
[51:15] don't want false birth amen so you just
[51:18] continue to preach the truth you
[51:20] continue to stand firm or what you
[51:21] believe on your convictions you know I
[51:23] know I've said it before that I try to
[51:27] live by the the I can't even think of
[51:31] what they're called down I try to live
[51:35] by the the saying you better I know I've
[51:38] said it here before then if I'm a nice
[51:40] thirsty give him something to drink
[51:41] don't put a fire hose in his mouth
[51:43] you know you can lay off Scripture you
[51:45] could lay out truth you can just put it
[51:47] before you but if when you're trying to
[51:48] shove it down their throat and try to
[51:50] shove it and shove it shove it you got
[51:51] to believe this you got to believe this
[51:52] you got to believe this well I've heard
[51:55] it once said that preach the gospel use
[51:59] words if necessary you know the people
[52:02] are going to watch you to see if you
[52:03] actually believe and live it believe
[52:05] what you what you're trying to get them
[52:07] to believe amen so it's it's not just at
[52:09] all what you say it's all of what you do
[52:14] but like we said we we can't force
[52:18] anyone to believe it
[52:22] I'm gonna wind down here in a couple
[52:24] minutes probably everybody knows Eli in
[52:28] the scripture and Samuel I'm probably
[52:35] gonna say his sons names wrong huffner
[52:37] and you know some people say finna has
[52:40] or I say finance so however you want to
[52:43] pronounce him but but they still did
[52:45] wrong I don't care how you pronounce it
[52:47] but he'll I thought his sons would come
[52:49] around but God means business you know
[52:52] he said a man said your your boys are
[52:54] doing wrong you know you got to
[52:56] straighten him out well you didn't do
[52:57] anything about it so when somebody comes
[53:01] and says to you you're not doing right
[53:03] straighten up how do you respond to them
[53:06] you know I preach the message years ago
[53:08] about accepting accepting rebuke some
[53:12] people cannot accept rebuke because of
[53:14] the too much pride gets in the way they
[53:17] had that wall of pride up there where
[53:18] you're not going to tell me what to do
[53:19] but if it's scriptural and you know
[53:21] you're doing it get yourself right you
[53:26] got to get yourself right you got to get
[53:27] yourself ready nobody else could get you
[53:29] ready it's a personal thing I can't get
[53:31] you ready your mom and dad can't get you
[53:33] ready your brother your sister your your
[53:36] wife your husband they can't get you
[53:37] ready you have to get you ready the
[53:41] responsibility falls upon you but Allah
[53:45] I thought his sons would come around but
[53:47] God means business Eli told us us to
[53:49] quit living in their wickedness because
[53:50] they were causing the women too they
[53:53] were causing the people to sin no but
[53:57] there was no repercussions from Eli Eli
[54:00] just said hey stop doing it but he
[54:03] didn't there were no punishments there
[54:05] were no repercussions and just like in
[54:07] this day people are they're not
[54:09] responsible for their own actions you
[54:12] know they want to blame everybody else
[54:13] they want to blame this party they want
[54:14] to blame white people they want to blame
[54:16] black people they want to blame
[54:17] government they want to blame church
[54:19] they want to blame this I want to blame
[54:20] that well nobody told you to throw the
[54:23] brick through the window you did that on
[54:27] your own nobody told you to go in that
[54:30] house and steal things you did that on
[54:33] your own nobody told you to
[54:34] puncture somebody's tires you did that
[54:36] on your own but there's a time that if
[54:40] you do the crime you do the time that's
[54:43] how I grew up that's how I learned it
[54:45] you got to face up to your
[54:47] responsibilities you do something wrong
[54:50] you pay the price for it but isn't it
[54:53] nice not all of us could can do what
[54:56] Jesus did by going and paying the price
[54:57] for us amen
[54:59] I heard this this story one time about
[55:03] an Indian chief I can't I can't exactly
[55:06] remember what they were what the people
[55:09] were doing but he he laid down the law I
[55:11] think if they were caught stealing then
[55:14] they were going to whip him put him on a
[55:16] whipping post and whip him well there
[55:20] was a person that was caught stealing
[55:21] and they said well bring him to me well
[55:25] it turns out that it was his own mother
[55:27] so the people are just waiting to see
[55:30] what decision he was going to make
[55:32] because is he going to let her go
[55:34] because it's his mother well he was
[55:37] thinking when I can't do that because
[55:38] then the people get unruly you know that
[55:40] I won't be much of a leader if I back
[55:42] down on what I said I laid down the law
[55:44] this is what we're gonna have to follow
[55:45] no matter if it's my son daughter mother
[55:47] it doesn't matter so what he did he said
[55:50] tie her up so they were getting ready to
[55:54] whip her and what he did is he wrapped
[55:55] himself around her and took the whoopin
[55:57] for are we willing to do that for one
[56:02] another and then I'm it's not going to
[56:04] take away our responsibility of what
[56:06] what we've done wrong you know what I
[56:08] mean
[56:08] so can we not take the wrong instead of
[56:11] arguing a backbiting and and just
[56:14] tearing one and one another up like I
[56:16] said this this time is there's a time
[56:18] for play there's a time for work this is
[56:19] not a time for for playing around this
[56:21] is a time to unifying getting at one
[56:24] mind and one accord so if somebody says
[56:27] well well you did such-and-such that I
[56:28] didn't like it well you're you're right
[56:30] I'm sorry
[56:31] you know can't we suffer the wrong
[56:33] that's scriptural that's a Corinthians
[56:35] if you want to read it that you know why
[56:37] not suffer the wrong because you take
[56:40] away a lot of a lot of hardships by
[56:43] taking away contention you just ease the
[56:46] situation
[56:48] where you gonna get with argument and
[56:50] infighting I don't want to get too much
[56:54] into that right now but we say we say we
[57:02] want revival we want revival we want a
[57:04] refreshing of the Holy Ghost but we
[57:06] don't clean the house for it we just
[57:08] continue in the same way just like it
[57:10] Eli sons we just continue in the same
[57:13] way that we were going we don't want a
[57:14] clean house but when you do clean house
[57:16] when you finally some evangelist comes
[57:19] in and you get all scoured out and you
[57:21] know yeah everything's cleaned out you
[57:23] don't replace it with something of God
[57:26] that's that's where the problem says
[57:29] once you're cleaned out then fill it
[57:31] with something wholesome fill it with
[57:33] something godly or those Devils Devils
[57:35] that were cast out will come what 7
[57:37] times greater for many times greater and
[57:41] you thought you had a battle before you
[57:44] just wait until you take on those other
[57:45] ones that are even stronger so once
[57:48] you're cleaned out fill it with
[57:50] something of the Lord amen fill it with
[57:51] godliness amen
[57:55] I just kind of think about that
[58:00] everybody knows that story uh I don't
[58:03] know if everybody I should have brought
[58:04] it out with me but I did about the that
[58:10] young man that I think it was the name
[58:13] was armor the armor and something else I
[58:17] can't remember the other name but he
[58:18] came and and they were having some some
[58:22] party or something and all the the women
[58:26] were dressing themselves up to try to
[58:27] get to marry this fellow I know I'm
[58:30] sorry I wish I could remember his name
[58:31] but I can't but all those all those
[58:35] women trying to impress trying to dress
[58:37] and impress and he wasn't interested in
[58:39] it but he found a wash woman what a
[58:42] cousin to all those or to the women
[58:44] there the the wash woman they didn't
[58:48] they didn't like her I guess her mother
[58:49] and father passed away and uh the aunt
[58:52] and uncle or whatever it was taking care
[58:54] of this woman while they through her
[58:55] kind of like a Cinderella ordeal they
[58:57] threw her that made her do all the
[58:58] washing all the Lord
[58:59] and all that well this is what that that
[59:01] man was interested in as somebody that
[59:03] was responsible in doing work somebody
[59:07] that was going to make a real good wife
[59:09] is what he was more that's what he was
[59:12] looking for not somebody that's going to
[59:14] be somebody that's high-maintenance
[59:16] looking all pretty and has to look
[59:17] pretty all the time and take care of me
[59:19] here take care of me there I want I want
[59:22] pedicures and manicures and all that
[59:23] take care of give me this give me that
[59:26] then don't want that you know some men
[59:29] want and they go after the beauty but
[59:31] after after that wears off after a while
[59:33] but you got to find somebody that that's
[59:35] going to be long-lasting
[59:37] somebody's going to stay there through
[59:38] thick and thin and I thank God for a
[59:40] godly wife that she stuck with me
[59:42] through sickness through pain through
[59:44] financial problems this was going to be
[59:49] 21 years that we've been married and I
[59:52] just thank God for a godly wife so I can
[59:54] understand what this man was looking for
[59:55] as I looking for a godly wife or a
[59:58] responsible wife somebody that's gonna
[1:00:00] be able to take care of herself and and
[1:00:01] not high-maintenance that he has to
[1:00:03] pamper her all the time somebody that
[1:00:05] has good character good wholesome
[1:00:07] character amen now if you now imagine so
[1:00:14] as everybody know that story so if you
[1:00:17] could imagine if this this woman came
[1:00:19] out and she's deliberating or she's
[1:00:24] debating within herself because he said
[1:00:25] from this day one year from now I'll be
[1:00:28] back to come and get you now through
[1:00:31] that whole year she she endured taunting
[1:00:33] it and uh just verbal abuse he's not
[1:00:39] coming for you
[1:00:39] he's not coming for you just just like
[1:00:42] the adversary tells you you're not God's
[1:00:44] child you're not saved he can't save you
[1:00:48] so just think of these cousins as a does
[1:00:51] a hammer and our hammer and a hammer on
[1:00:53] her trying to make her doubt so imagine
[1:00:55] debating within herself well is he going
[1:00:57] to come for me where is it he's got a
[1:00:59] compass should I get ready I'll make the
[1:01:01] dress just a case and and uh well the
[1:01:05] day comes what if the day came that she
[1:01:07] was still undecided to make that
[1:01:11] decision to go out and meet him
[1:01:13] well what about the next day she'll say
[1:01:16] well okay I decided I'll go ahead and
[1:01:19] marry him that wouldn't make any sense
[1:01:22] now wouldn't she'd be a day late and
[1:01:24] that she'd be disappointed because she
[1:01:28] wasn't ready at the time now
[1:01:30] she had the privilege privilege of
[1:01:32] knowing what day he was going to come of
[1:01:33] course this is natural so we don't know
[1:01:35] what day our Lord is coming so we must
[1:01:38] make that decision now it's not
[1:01:40] something that you can make later amen
[1:01:42] so make your decision to follow him now
[1:01:45] amen
