told a menacing Lord Rama Falls thank you Jesus amen thank God first presence let's take our Bibles tonight by God's grace and let's open up to proverbs chapter 31 like to try to finish this thought on the proverbs 31 woman tonight Lord willing verse 21 proverbs 31 verse 21 we'll read verses 21 to 27 thankful we can sit and learn at Jesus's feet amen he give us all this wisdom in his word and we're here to hear the words of life tonight amen proverbs 31 verse 21 we started looking at the first few verses on Sunday night verse 21 she's not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the outers of the land she maketh fine linen and sell Fateh and delivereth girdles unto the merchants strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she opened with her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness let's stop right there let's have a word of Prayer if you have anything on your heart just make it known unto God as we go before our gracious Heavenly Father dear Lord in heaven we come before the throne of grace Lord and we're meeting here at the appointed time Heavenly Father Lord we gather Lord at these times to hear from you Lord we sit and learn at your feet Lord we humble ourselves O God we give you preeminence on this day Lourdes midweek service we come by the blood of your son Jesus we thank you for a sufficient sacrifice Lord we're trusting in the righteousness of Christ our sacrifice and out of our own Lord God pardon our transgressions forgive us Lord God of our sins and iniquities O God let us Lord God appreciate more and more your saving grace Lord let us walk daily with you Lord and learn to walk in your ways Lord as we sing that song Lord teach us today Lord to walk closer to you or let us take advantage of this opportunity Lord as your prophet said before the government closes the doors Lord we know that will happen father at some point Lord for the mark of the beast will be laid down so lord help us to take advantage and remember that these times are blessing times Lord and father we take courage and strength Lord from thy spirit Lord tonight and Lord we thank you for the gathering of the saints bless each and every heart may they be fed the Word of God tonight in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen god bless she's been and seen the praise the Lord so we'd like to look at this is part 4 on the proverbs 31 woman and we'll look at this apart 9 of the series tonight by the grace of the Lord I want to begin with the court I mentioned on Sunday so they asked the prophet of God this sorry in 1964 they said brother Branham are women allowed to work in public affairs when they have a healthy husband and children I'm asking this question for someone else buh-bam he says well I I I don't know about that I can't say but I I just have this feeling let me say this I believe if I was a woman and I know that my husband was healthy and had a good job working I believe would be a great pleasure to me to stay home take care of my children and make the and take care of my children and raise them up to love the Lord if I had any time from washing and things that I was going to do I think I would teach my children how to serve the Lord he said now here's where he balances it out you know cuz so often we feel like well so often we hear sometimes preaching and people are so hard on any woman that would leave the home you know or or do anything outside of the home but we've got to balance it out by the grace of the Lord just like this week I got an email from overseas and the brothers like do you condemn all smartphones and all tablets and all these things because of what brother Graham said about TVs and and so I just tried to bring the balance brother branham said if you make the TV evil then you make the newspaper evil anything that has any evil in it would then be something you can't touch right he said but it all depends what you do with it and the brother wrote me back and said oh praise the Lord thank you for your answer you know I just try to show the balance and show if you have godly character you'll always turn away from sin whether it's on your phone or tablet or TV if you really have Christ in you you'll hate sin and you'll turn away and that's why a smartphone isn't a sin of itself it's what someone does with it and so just encouraging to see the balance and so just as that topic of TVs and Internet and cell phones and smartwatches just as that has balance so does this subject has balance as well the RAM says if you've got a debt or something like that you're trying to help your husband pay for or something that you have to do that well I think that's fine as you'll try to help him and you live a lady and I think it's hard no man that's got good understanding once if his wife to get in a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things like that so as I said on Sunday the prophet of God is repeatedly mentioning the atmosphere that a godly woman would be around her character her virtue is so sacred the Prophet is just he's leaning hard on this don't let your wife get in a bad atmosphere and how many know that a real Christian doesn't want to work in that atmosphere anyway they would leave a job that had an awful atmosphere right because they would grieve the Holy Spirit inside of them and a real Christian can't stand to grieve the Holy Spirit that's right so he says but if the woman has to get in that so she has to get in that so he knows there's times that would I think she ought to her husband ought to know that she's a genuine Christian that can be trusted a trustworthy woman that's what we saw in proverbs 31 right her husband can safely put his trust in her amen so brother hands talking here about a proverbs 31 woman just not saying the words proverbs 31 woman but now as I as to say that she wouldn't work I don't know see there's no scripture to back that up I'm just I'm just passing that opinion but I think if a woman wants to work and she wants to work now I'm certainly against women working in these offices where all these businessmen they carry on they tell the dirty jokes a nice clean woman sitting there and all these smutty dirty things around like that I'm against that I think you ought to come out from among such stuff as that but now if a woman can hold herself as a real lady and trying to help her husband do something to meet some clothes for the kids to go to school or pay off a bill or something like that and she wants to work till that's over now that this is not she said this is not the Lord because I don't have no scripture for this I'm just saying that be my opinion but otherwise I wouldn't think just because she wants to work just to run around or have money to spend and run to bar rooms and drink or smoke or carry on I don't think she should do it I think she should stay home truly or try to be a lady and take care of the house amen that's the end of the quote how many appreciate the balance of the prophet of God yeah he admits here he doesn't have any scripture where a woman could work outside the home but he doesn't condemn it either he leaves that open that's that's the way a real man of God would do that if he doesn't have a scripture he just says that's my opinion and the Holy Spirit will guide you but look the Holy Spirit will never guide you into a bunch of sin and a filthy smutty atmosphere won't guide you into that amen just like we know with lot member he first planted his tent toward Sodom and then we found him in Sodom the Holy Spirit wasn't leading him there right it was just his own desire he saw and it looked like the Garden of Eden he thought my this place looks like this doesn't really have much promise I want to go to some places great financially and in doing that he went to a city that tormented him day and night you see at Abraham he was a real believer a dollar bill we'd say a silver dollar he stayed outside all that and God protected him amen angels enter at the pole Abraham out of destruction he had wisdom to know you stay away from homosexuality right you stay away from sodomites he had wisdom to know you never plant yourself in a situation like that amen so we see the same thing here with our sisters working outside the home they've got to use the wisdom of the Holy Spirit there has to be a reason for and it has to be God ordained because God will never lead us into a sinful situation now let's look at these next verses here 21 down to actually that's 27 I meant to make that a 27 so pardon me so in this portion here now we've gone through these other things she does and many of these can be done right from her home that we've gone through in the earlier verses but now in these verses it really focuses in on the home so the virtuous woman provides for a family with faithful character let's look at proverbs 31 21 if you got your Bibles there we'll just make a few comments and remember I'm using comment from some writers from the the Philadelphian church age and remember if you remember when we preach on that series on the church ages brother Branham said God anointed those men like Matthew Henry and Albert Barnes he anointed them with that man wisdom of the Holy Spirit and he said there never was a greater riding age than the age of the philadelphia church age so it's not sin for me to use these commentaries as long as they line up with the Word of God amen now look at verse 21 she's not afraid of the snow for a household for all of her household are decked I'm sorry clothed with scarlet so see she does not fear the snow because her house is clothed look they're already clothes so in other words she's already got preparations to keep her children and and her entire household warm in the cold months and remember that included in this case and included her children but also maidens or we'd say serving girls young girls that were not married and so remember this was a double-layered garment I went over this on Sunday night so we added this to her list now there's a couple other slides of these I think there's five slides of these now all these godly attributes of a proverbs 31 woman amen so she produces high quality merchandise prepared an alert inside the home she works with her hands with most ancient of tools she takes initiative to help the poor in the needy and she prepares warm clothes for her children and her servants amen verse 22 now she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple now if you ever study if you study the scripture tapestry is a bed covering if you study the scripture so what's that called honey of the blanket on top what's that called again the comforter yeah thank you aren't you glad for the comfort of the Holy Spirit but see she's worked she works with the comforter I like the spiritual types here she works with the cover just like she works with the thread right they get the token ready amen she works are these things amen so that's an important especially in the cold months that's an important blanket how do we know that can't sleep in your sheets in the wintertime she makes that herself because the Bible says this that you know now this is the the moral woman talked about the coverings of tapestry on her beds that's how we know that tapestry was that comforter or the heavy blanket there and notice her clothing is silk and purple and that's what God adore in Israel with after he found her in the blood her own blood he picked her up he washed her off and he decked her with bracelets and a beautiful garment and and put a crowd on her head and all these things like that but he clothed Israel with fine linen and silk the Bible says that in Ezekiel 16 now silk was probably imported from Egypt and the purple dye came from Phoenicia because I forget where it was but they had to get these little water creatures that were purple and you know kill them and then get out they're purple they're purple whatever blood or whatever it was and then they had to get enough of that to make the purple garment so these were very costly garments so now we know this woman is certainly the wife of a rich King so that's got to give us some context remember it's hard to find a woman like this just as it's hard to find a real Christian woman at all in the world how do we know that it's hard to find a real Christian woman let alone a Christian woman who has all this influence all this money all this power all this possibility it's very hard to find one of these so now it's interesting so in this in this next verse then we see the proof that this is a really a wealthy woman the as the wife of the king because she has soaked garments with now scarlet was costly as well red garments and purple garments were costly now I just want to stop and say this we know God ordains something to be rich and others to be poor in fact I was listening to a letting off the pressure brother Branham said God made some rich and God made some poor he does that he just places people in different situations so I want you to know this proverbs 31 is not condemning poor Christians or Jews but it's just showing how a godly woman presented herself the resources available to her it's not condemning the the rich or the poor so whatever God makes you just be the best rich Christian or the best poor Christian you could be and now we know in America we know all of us were richer than most of the entire world put together right we're have so many goods and there's so many riches and I got to work for it right but most of us live paycheck to paycheck unless you're really good at saving and you're really good at cutting your costs but a lot of us like me had to go into debt to buy a house so I go again we'll go into debt I got to get a vehicle that will make it to work every day so I gotta take a loan out there a lot of us have just lived in debt because that's the way it's set up I come from a poor family my parents didn't give me any money also I got is what God gave me so most of us live on debt in America we're never not really rich but we have access to a lot of things a lot of goods most of us now I want you to bring this quote I wonder well because I want to balance this now we're not saying you know if you're not rich and you if you're not dressed in the nicest dresses you're not a proper 31 woman we're not saying that we're just looking at how a godly Jewish woman would have dressed if she was the wife of a king because remember this type spiritually but look her brother Adam says we preach this last year around said the people of God are not material minded they are Christ minded they do not seek the treasures that are below them they stick those above it's absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy so this proverbs 31 woman these clothes didn't mean a whole lot to her she was not her mind wasn't on all I want the prettiest dress it was just something she just dressed herself nicely because that's what was available to her her mind was not on the clothes to make herself beautiful it was on I want to provide the needs of my husband the children and I want to I want this house to run well by the grace of God it wasn't all my look at that online IRA I think I'll spend an extra two thousand and buy that that's skirt that's a really nice skirt you know that that's not what her motivation was her motivation was to fear God and do good to her husband all the days of her life so in doing that I fear God I'm gonna obey my do good to my husband today I'm the I'm the wife of a king they placed these garments before me I'll wear the nice ones that's just what she had she in other words she cared about her her presentation her appearance she didn't want to look messy she wouldn't look nice but brother have says that most Christians are wealthy rather they're on the poor side it was so in Jesus's day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not so it is not too true today for the lay of caen age is one of a vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly Goods my how the rich how rich the churches and goods but how poor in spirit blessed are you poor for yours of the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not meat and drink it is not material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things a method that beautiful so our main motivation is not to get more Goods and more Goods and more goods our mone may our main motivation is to spread the kingdom of God that's right because we always have it you know always have things always you know we have you know you just look at our church for example if you go to my office my office is a storage room from all of our earthly goods being a big Church for a bigger church for a few years and then down you know downsizing and we just have extra goods there we've got to work hard to keep less goods because you're my mother-in-law will bring me over three bags of clothes and what am I gonna do with these you know and I don't even have hardly room for these you know or somebody blesses you with all these extra things you've just got to work hard to not be material of mind at amen but that's Laodicea so we've got to constantly get our mind off material things and get it on spiritual things things above so now we now let's add to that list so not only does we read this one already here's this scripture she makes her own blankets and then she wears high quality clothing as wife of the king so she presents herself in a way of dignity we'd say she's very dignified but she's the wife of a king she ought to present herself that way because she's the role model for all the women of the kingdom right that's right that's what the scripture says about Vashti and we know an Esther and we know brother man talked about with Jacqueline Kennedy and how the first lady you know influences the rest of the women I hope you're not influenced by mrs. Trump the third mrs. Trump right because he's on his third marriage with her high heels I saw a picture of her she had the highest high heels on my goodness I know how she even walks afterwards wearing high heels like that and again I'm not condemning her attacking her but I'm just saying she's not our example the proverbs 31 woman is our example amen so now let's look at verse 23 look remember she's good with her hands like a lot of this she does herself we saw that on Sunday and Sunday night all that she did with her own hands the spindle the thread the clothes and now her bed comforter she does all this with her own hands verse 23 her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land now this gives us a good clue as to what time period of life this takes place in I don't think I said more later but I didn't get to that part I don't think I'll be able to preach that tonight now her husband is not a youngster her husband is an elder to see this so see the proverbs 31 woman was not focusing well if you're not 25 if you're 25 and you don't do all these things you're not a proper that's not what it's saying proverbs 31 looks at the whole entire scope of a woman's life and said these are all things that are what godly woman could do if extremely gifted and if given all these resources because she was given thee she was the queen she was given this money she was given these servants she was good this is all she that she was given and look what she accomplished what she was given but let's not feel bad about it let's look and see what Jesus gave us amen let's say God whatever you give me I'll give it back to you like the boy with the loaves and the bread I'll give it back to you and may it be blessed to glorify your name but see this gives us a clue now at the end of their lives as they're getting older maybe we'd say the empty nest stage or you know the the parenting stage where the children are all older now that her husband's an elder she has lived such a godly life that she she she she helped supports her husband's reputation and we'll look at this here in a moment her godly character helped vindicate her husband's godly character so because she lived a godly life it gave her husband an influence in the political realm praise God and Holman said she enabled her husband to sin among the elders a respected local authority how many have seen a preacher fall because his wife didn't live the right kind of life I've seen a couple so see see how close to see how the husband and wife or one is everybody see that she because she lives such a godly holy fearful life of fearful of the Lord it allowed her husband to be respected in public amen to see sisters and brothers you know we're just not living for ourselves we represent one another amen I represent my wife at the people that know me at work they have a certain reputation of me when they see my wife whatever they think of me they probably think the same thing of my wife right there that's how it is to you when you see a woman you see a godly woman then you see a godly man whatever their reputation is it reflects on the other because these two are now one that's right so this deals with reputation and the character he is known in the gates because she helped allow him to be there because if she doesn't stay in order then he would lose his influence and that scriptural as well here's what Clark said she's a loving wife she feels the she feels for the respectability and honor of her husband he's an elder among his people and he sits as a magistrate in the gate he's respected not only on account of the neatness and cleanliness of his person and dress but because he's the husband of a woman who is justly held in universal esteem everybody sees just like Ruth everybody she sees she's a virtuous woman and her complete management of household affairs gives him leisure for leisure to devote himself to the civil interest of the community so that's that's that's why the woman's role is so critical like my brother Graham calls her the backbone right she gives that man stability he can go out and do things publicly or he can do things in the church or politically or wherever he can have an influence he can have a bigger influence because of the stability of his wife and now this should remind you godly men were elders at the at the city gates remember Boaz in fact the Bible said Boaz just went to the gate and sat down and pretty soon the rest of the elders came see he knew these wise men of judgment he knew these judges were going to come by because that's where judgment took place was at the gates he knew wise men will come here to the gates and no doubt Boaz was one of them remember when Ruth couldn't be redeemed by her nearest of kin you know he takes off his shoe and he says I'll redeem Ruth right and he said let this be a witness and all these elders be a witness that I've redeemed Naomi and Ruth is that right and he was a godly man and he could do that because of his godliness and there he's taken a godly wife a virtuous wife amen now remember a lot was a righteous man we said he was like a foolish virgin no because he chose to put his family in an awful spiritual situation but yet he was righteous so he was a righteous man a good man a save man who made an awful decision right but where did he sit when the angels came where'd he sit in the gate of the city so see his wife must have been doing something right although we believe she was lost because Jesus user has a bad example she turned and wanted to look back and and then and just miss Sodom but even she must have did some good because her character or whatever however she lived allowed him to sit in the gates and that's a Genesis 19 1 & 2 and second Peter 2 8 and I feared it's okay now this is also very similar in the New Testament because a church elder or a bishop or in this case a pastor like myself or any pastor you know must also have a godly wife the Bible says and so much the Deacons wife be godly as well so this scripture speaks to the point of how if the man's holy his wife must be holy right and if the woman is only the man must be holy if people are going to serve other people they must be examples to the rest of the people the leaders must not be hypocrites they must live the life amen and if they can live the life at home then God will trust them with public offices and public responsibilities amen and that's what she had because of her godly life her husband was known at the gate oh you're so your brother so-and-so all yeah I've heard great things about your wife yes she bought that field out there planning a vineyard and my wife was tell me she on the radio that a vineyard took at least 20 years to become fruitful so she had a 20-year vision which makes sense I mean if you plant the vines they got to grow up and you got to stake him up and then the grapes got to grow this is a long process so she was a visionary she's thinking my years down the line if I can get this ground cleared and get these vines planted mom we're gonna be blessed in about 20 years so she must add some income right there but was also planning for future income as well all right what a I don't think I could do that that's a wise business mind I've always admired all my friends who are like a business owners like my goodness how do you do that I'd be so I'd be a nervous wreck am I gonna get a job tomorrow you know and I just talked to my friend on Tuesday you know Jacob ah bond he said well my workout cancelled for dad well he said I wonder what the Lord's gonna lead me to I thought one of what a man of faith he's just used to it he he works for himself he's in construction when something falls out he just knows God's got something else for me I like that but see me a mile and sell my own personality I just like to rely upon the everyday job I know I just I'll go to workout I'll give my time I'll trade my time for that paycheck but that's you know it's just interesting when you look at that that he they must live the godly life and when they live that God life then people know these people are good judges because they judge their lives in their home and so the godly men she he or her husband has known the gates because partly because of her character now no doubt his character - we're not gonna put it all on the woman because no one wants a rascal man if even no matter how good his wife is nobody wants a rascal man as a leader or a judge because he's a rascal now so now let's add this now in her long list of works now she's got a public reputation and household management that supports her husband's reputation because she lives such a godly life right this is the kind of woman that this is the very embodiment of wisdom Ember this is wisdom made flesh this is how she lives verse 24 let's go there now look she's back to making things with her hands she's back to producing things if if comforters weren't enough if clothes weren't enough if thread wasn't enough now she's making something else verse 24 she maketh fine linen and sells it not only does she have a vineyard on the side of the home over here where she's selling grapes and selling grapes and fruits and all these not only doing that now she's got another business here she's working with brothers don't I heard the preachers say this on the under the YouTube sermon he said now brothers don't go home and tell your wife you need to have three businesses on the side or else you're no good right cuz I don't even think I could handle that many businesses I know I couldn't but look how god now she's I remember your sister she's got all these resources she's got the husband's bank you know he's the king he's got a pretty big bank account right he's the king and Salman was getting all those taxes remember all the taxes he pulled in and they warned him there he's gonna tax you he's going to take your firstborn he's gonna take your horses he's gonna take and they're like that's fine we want a king you know and that's where they warned him with Saul you know but then Solomon even increased it upon top of that on top of Saul's taxes and so here we see one more thing about her she has a business on the side not only does she make clothes and comforters now she makes other clothes and sells it and also the girdles are the belt so she made clothes and belts honey like this woman so far she's a pretty good woman and she she's much much more smarter than me I'll tell you that so she sells clothing that she makes so out of she has to be in a certain time of her life because you can't renew a baby and have both hands on the spindle or however they do it you know they they gotta Pat the foot and they gotta get the thread in and I forget how to use the spindle it's in the story Rapunzel you know but you got to have two hands you can't have one nurse and a baby over here just one and what you can't gotta have both hands on that so see you got to take these into context what time period of her life would she do this in and so Clark said makes linen which can be used in both inner and outer garments and even girdles which are put on last as a belt or sash so they walk around the town and they see oh that's that belt that sister so-and-so made that's pretty nice where did you get that oh yeah the sister down there the King's wife made that yeah she's not up there you know sleeping all day or you know pampering herself all day she's up there working hard she's trying to bring honor to her husband she doesn't want to be a burden for the husband she wants to be a blessing for a husband she wants to do good to King Solomon all the days of her life what a testimony and not only that church but the Bible said that she delivered them herself to the merchant so she would bag him up can we say box him up maybe I don't know they had boxes in those days maybe wood boxes but not only did she make sure all these clothing and skirts that were in line in these robes not only that but she boxed them up and then she delivered them herself don't you think if you were a king or queen you'd want to have like a errand boy or something like that but not this woman this woman found time to even deliver her goods so again there can't be little children running around that she's got to take care of she's has to have little more free time right because if she neglects her children then she's guilty of neglecting her home she's left her first her first mission her first duty is to her family her children so now at this stage of her life she makes her own goods and sells them on Amazon or Ebay or whatever you use Craigslist whatever that's dangerous but look look at her life this is her testimony and at the end and at the end church everybody's gonna praise this woman she's not gonna brag on herself but everybody in her home is gonna bless her now why is she doing all this is she doing this for money not necessarily for money she's doing it to make sure her house is taken care of and to do good to her husband and to fear the Lord you can make a belt and fear the Lord yes you can according to the Bible right sisters you can have a little a business on the side and you can still serve the Lord and still fear God and God knows you're not in it to be a millionaire God knows you just want to be a blessing to your family praise God now did the Holy Spirit write this chapter or not church the Holy Spirit wrote this chapter so she must have worked from the homes maybe she had little home office and she made these fine linen robes she made these nice Jewish belts and then went and sold him she delivered them herself to the merchants quiet quite a quite a story in quite a part of you so now this after she has this reputation she is such a godly life she produces high quality clothing and delivers it in sells its herself kind of it kind of changing our thoughts our minds on what a godly woman is doesn't it it's really changed my mind a lot and don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with just wanting to cook or clean or make your house spotless and there's nothing wrong with all those those are good things wash your clothes that's wonderful things but there comes a certain stage of your life where you have a little more time to do other things and so this shows us that a woman if gift in these areas can be used by the Holy Spirit to be a blessing to her family that's right yes sir proverbs 31 25 now it really gets down to her spiritual character here strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come so this woman here her true clothing is spiritual now we saw earlier right we saw how she had the finest scarlet purple she had she had access to the nicest clothes she had the nicest brand names I don't even know what they are I think for men it's chaps I think about I think that's the best shirts I have I think somebody bought him for me I didn't buy myself but she had access to the nicest clothes but when it all comes down to it God shows us that that's really not what she's anointed that's not really what she looks like she looks like an anointed daughter of God because she's anointed with strength strength of what the Holy Ghost and she has the anointing of Honor on her this is what she's really clothed in know people they just see oh she's a queen and she has all this money beautiful belts look at those belts look at those beautiful dress that's what they see but the Holy Spirit gives us the picture that really deep down inside of her she's strong in the Lord amen and she's strong in the power of his might hallelujah she strengthened by Jehovah amen and she has honor because she honors God because the Bible said in you know first samuel those who honor God God will honor them so she she honored God she must have got up and and and love the Lord and prayed and read her Bible and she must have took care of all the needs memory earlier she gave she gave portions to her maidens portions to her children she made sure everybody had what they need for their jobs of the day and then she had time for some other activity some side businesses on the side oh this woman but for us it's the it's the the clothing we need is that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost because jesus said you'll be endued or clothed with power from on high so she had this Old Testament anointing which was the Holy Ghost just not on her soul she had that anointing she was a real believer and because of that she was really clothed with the anointing of the Holy Spirit now look her rejoicing will take place in the future after seeing the fruits of all of her Labor's so she didn't she didn't take a day off and say mine look how great I am you know put her feet up on the coffee table and say oh I've done such a great job she didn't get involved with pride see because she's not rejoicing now she's not looking at all look what I've done look she would always had a goal she always had more to do because God was giving her more time on the earth and she must make best use of this time and she knew and I'm older and I can't do the spindle when I'm older and I can't make my tapestries I'll rejoice then amen when I can't go out on the field and I can't you know I can't pull out the rocks you know and and plant a vineyard when I'm older then I'll rejoice then because I'll see the fruits of all my efforts so she didn't relax now there's nothing nothing wrong with taking a day off and relaxing okay so don't get me wrong there you gonna put your feet up and on Sunday night and take a rest you take her ass you need a day off you take a day off but I'm just saying pride you don't pat yourself on the back side look what I've done mom the best you know we don't pride always leads to contention the Bible says pride always leads to a downfall so this shows this woman was not prideful she was doing all these side businesses with humility saying god you're my strength you're gonna give me wisdom for this vineyard or it's gonna feed our family 20 years down the road when I have grandchildren and all these all these needs that come up you're gonna be my strength and everything she did she was looking to honor Christ amen which we know Jehovah right but we know Moses serve each owes Christ right and Christ ministered to him in the wilderness that's right that's what Hebrews says so we know it was the Holy Spirit Christ so she looks forward with gladness and she's confident in the fruits that she shall reap she knows she knows she's live a godly life she know she's planning a lot of things and what the Bible say the Bible says do not become weary in well-doing for ye will reap if you not faint Amen always about in the work of the Lord for anything you do for God is not in vain Amen hallelujah that's exactly right nothing we do for Christ is in vain he sees it all and just like that will rejoice in time to come that's right and then she has stray like the young and honor' like the elders that's what she has she's so strong so she has strength and honor her clothing she's strong she's she acts younger than she is we'd say and then she's she's so honored she acts like an elder to a head now I don't have time for all these scriptures but I've just I was caught up in my concordance and I noticed all the times clothing was it was a type of spiritual anointing of the anointing of the Holy Spirit so job said righteousness has clothed me my judgments were my robes so see that's what judgments is your wisdom so he was anointed with wisdom it's like he wore it every everybody saw his wisdom by the life that he lived so when strengthened on her her clothing it means the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the Bible said we are clothed with salvation the Bible said we wear robes of righteousness which is doing the right thing Romans says I love this one put you on the Lord Jesus Christ put him on wake up in the morning and put on Jesus amen being Jesus to your your family aim ahead your work your school be Jesus wherever you go put him on and the Bible said Timothy or Paul told Timothy be adorned with good works more than riches so put on good works more than you do riches and then the Bible said be clothed with humility so search if you picture this woman this picture had you know this woman was going to sleep she had you know that that candle on at night if something stirred she got up took care of it maybe went back to bed but then got up early got everybody's food ready made the food and then once all this the maidens wet and the children and all their things remember she's out of order stage of her life then she got down to some of her businesses that she had on her heart to do and she never did it with pride she did it with humility in other words God give me the grace to make these belts so I can sell them and make a good increase here and make a profit so I can take care of my family that's what she wanted to do and so that everyone will know that my husband's a godly man that were a godly family we'll sell them for a good price won't cheat anybody right he had a good reputation she made it a one product we saw that on Sunday night she had the finest of these clothes I mean she she made a good product that's what I love about you know a voice of God you know I don't agree with their doctor now about you know tapes only and things I don't agree with that and I don't agree with brother Brahim every word he said was the state the Lord we'd none of us none of us believe that I hope you don't believe that as much as we appreciate here but one thing I love about them is that they do at a one product that's what I love about them and I certainly respect that and appreciate that that's why I support them and I buy their books for you if you want their books now if they start injecting thoughts in those books then I'll get rid of those and well not buy those but as long as they just keep it what brother bear have said then we can rejoice right because brother Ram never taught those things some of those things that we disagree on he never taught those things like recently I heard a certain member of the family say that the real fivefold ministry was tape boys people that just go and you know play tapes and don't preach and brother Branham never said that so see they missed they took a quote I forget which quote it was they took it and they misinterpreted it was from desperation his desperation 63 and they they're they're making a statement saying well brother Graham said oh the tape boys finally got in there to Rahab and the family members step back and said see that's the real fivefold ministry and I have the link if you want to watch it I'm not making this up I would never I'm not speaking bad about people I'm just letting you know we've got to rightly divide the word of truth and that's what my job is to do rightly divide the word of truth to make sure you're eating sheep food all the time and that you're solid you cuz you're solid on the word and you just believing the word of God okay so her anointing not after she delivers her own goods when she's little older her real anointing is strengths and honors the real Holy Ghost that's what she's really clothed with and she she's so shamed face it in a where that her greatest joys lay in the future she's not going to get caught up in her current prosperity and all the good things that aren't gonna get caught up on that and get prideful or get lazy or think she's better she's gonna stay humble because the Bible says she's not rejoicing now she's gonna wait till later to rejoice when I'm older when I'm ordering I can't do this anymore and the evil days come member Solomon said that the evil days come when you get old and you don't enjoy life anymore oh it sounds so awful but I've you know I talked to Helen and Helen does it I don't think she mind me telling she's but but she you know she said every time I get up I heard and there's she said I guess that's how old I am I'm 92 years old you know and it's kind of just this running joke she tells me that's hard being old and that's what Solomon said when the evil days come so remember the creator in the days of your youth I'm so glad I got saved at 19 and I heard the message at 21 I could give the greatest years of my life but and I'm starting to get a little pain now like for example I sit on the floor at school and I sit indian-style to read with the kids and 20 minutes later I can hardly stand up that's how old I'm getting I feel like I'm oh I can hardly I just walk like this I mean like what is going on with my body I never had trouble like this I'm only 37 but that's what they're saying like when you get older your body's breaking down and you want to look back and at the end of your road as you're closing your eyes you want to say this is the greatest moment of my life even though I'm in all this paint because in five minutes I'll be with Jesus Christ amen hallelujah like Billy Sunday said hey man are you nervous no he said this is the day of my coronation amen he said I'll be with Christ in five minutes hallelujah because he gave His life he gave the early years of his life to Christ and he knew who he was serving hallelujah he was serving the risen Lord amen and then that's a time he would rejoice they cry tears of joy remember when says I did I tell you this one sister Karen's mom passed away she and her brothers heard the angels singing before she passed away and she served a brother peregrines church from 1966 all the way to when Peregrine passed away and angels were singing now what it would be more important to be a millionaire she was a millionaire not hear the angels singing or just live a humble godly life a shamefaced life a life of humility and then at the end of your life hear the angels singing before you cross over in that dimension hey I'd rather have the angels singing amen I'd rather have that testimony to keep humble and then rejoice in times to come hallelujah that's the kind of clothing I on one to strengthen honor the baptism of the Holy Ghost proper 31:26 I didn't send a timer so I better set one now give me 15 minutes I'll try to finish up here 31:26 I like this she openeth her mouth with wisdom not with foolishness wisdom now brother's us to write we can say foolish things too but this is member the focus and this also can apply to the church we we all need to open our mouths with wisdom there's a time to joke I don't understand I understand letting off the pressure brother man man had left we understand there's times a joke but the majority of our time open our mouths it ought to be the wise words of God now idle words she opened to their mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness now that law makes it seem like it's really stable it's really firm right the laws the the bottom line so the bottom line of her speaking was kindness she was kind and that's what I want to be kind of voice of God tonight or I want to be kind you know I want to be kind everybody don't you just be honest you know just say well here's where we disagree but I love you yeah I appreciate you you know I thank you that you do nice things for the Lord you know kindness kindness I got an email this weekend I said brother Jesse you know yeah I watched your videos and he's a sabbatarian all he believes is that he just keeps condemning me because I don't I don't take the Sabbath day as a literal day and I keep saying it's shown in the same scripture the Bible said this is the rest with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people and this is the rest I told him the rest is the baptism with all he goes but he's so indoctrinated he can't see it I'm trying to be kind to him anyways he said I watched your videos I never sense one ounce of love and all these things I felt bad but I just was real kind I said well thank you brother I appreciate your your email I said but even though you don't feel love I know I made those videos with love and my proof is jesus said if you love me keep my commands and all my videos are teaching you to obey Jesus's commands they met but people but oh you don't feel any love I don't feel any emotion I don't feel any love and all these things like that let people criticize but let us have the law of kindness like I was talking to I'll just let me just put a let me just put a wreath on brother Jim schumake's neck for a few minutes can I do that he doesn't even know I'm gonna say this but those two Canadian brothers we talked about that are visiting churches and they're causing all these you know they're having to call the cops on him because they're condemning people in the parking lots well they came to brother Jim's Church and he was telling me this story and he said the brother the two brothers were condemning their music and saying oh you can only sing hymns you can't sing like new contemporary songs and brother Jim said as their voices rose brother Jim stayed calm and used the law of kindness now he didn't say that but that's what I see in the situation and he looked at him and said and he said real calmly he said brother is the Lord leading you to go around churches and cause divisions and brother Jim said the brother looked at him didn't answer and just started talking about something else at church that's the law of kindness right there see you can correct and rebuke somebody with total kindness it's all about your spirit if you keep your spear under control and ask for the wisdom of the Holy Spirit you can rebuke and bring correction and you don't you don't to get mad you don't to stomp your feet you don't have to loosen up your tie and your shirt and say well let's talk about this let's go sit down in the officer let's go let's go out to the parking lot well how will talk this out clothes strength and honor right open your mouth in wisdom that was such a wise question and isn't interesting the spirit behind that person couldn't answer and say God is leading me to do this I know God's leading me to preach the gospel I know God's leading me to have more children amen I know God's leading me to make youtube videos I know that how do you know because I've already prayed about it and God's already put it on my heart praise the Lord so now no one could talk me out of it when I see God's hand in it and he's leaving me to do that and the Holy Spirit is with me amen nobody could talk me out of that see in everything we do we need to have God's approval first right there's no way this woman would go out and buy a field until she pondered it in other words prayed about it or this is this Lanza land is getting more expensive Lord here in Judea or what is it get in Ohio a lot more expensive in Ohio in it brother Adam it's getting really expensive Lord is this something I should do a you know 20 years we'll have more children and and we'll have a grandchildren Lord is this something you're lead and the Holy Spirit must have put on her heart yes do this you have to get out there and work but you have the time to do this now and so the Holy Spirit was guiding all this Lord should I make belts at my house or not should I sell on eBay should I do this on Amazon humble yourself humble yourself and see if God will anoint you to do his will but see the most most usually people don't really pray about it they just do like a five-second prayer or in their little quick bedtime prayer but you got to lay before the Lord and you got to pray with sincerity because if not you're just guessing you're just guessing and what I waited eight years with the YouTube videos because in 2005 I had the burden to make videos and I just waited on the Lord waiting on the Lord we learn and then 2013 to finally put them on YouTube I just got more emails back today just people being blessed all around the world you know so it's just you just got to wait on the Lord and you got to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit now look Jesus said from abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so this woman had an abundant of wisdom just laying there in her heart because wisdom and then wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord so before she had all this wisdom in here she had the fear of the Lord first Lord I don't want to displease you Lord I know you're a rewarder of those who diligently seek you I also know you rebuke all those who transgress your laws so before she did any of these great works she first had to wrestle it out and say well lord I fear you first whatever you say I'll do no matter what the Word of God says I won't compromise God's Word amen I'll never compromise God's Word she had to get that settled first and then God could trust her with the field then God could trust her with a belt business I just I think that's so so interesting that God would use her as the model so belts made comforters for her bed I think this is astounding astounding no now speaking of her words remember contrast this godly woman with a adulterous harlot who is loud and clamorous and everybody could hear in the streets what a contrast she only speaks wisdom she's not rejoicing now you know she's not boasting now she just speaks wisdom she only opens her mouth really for wisdom and here we got this loud obnoxious glamorous woman who's always bragging and laughing and joking and dirty words and cuss words and all kinds of things like that look at the difference between these two now she speaks with the law of kindness and God help us to minister grace to the ears of our words I'm gonna read that Ephesians 4:29 that's a good scripture to read just to remind us now Church you know this but if you if you really feel led to rebuke somebody and doesn't sound kind then if that's of God then you got to do what God tells you to do but if we don't have that leading to rebuke somebody then let's just be kind about it visions 4:29 you know it's the most often I feel led to rebuke people is just behind the pulpit because the Bible said rebuke them before rebuke them that sin before all that others may fear does he that makes perfect sense the main time I'm supposed to rebuke is behind the pulpit because that's what the scripture says that's when I feel the most zealous for the word and you know I don't care what anybody says if people walk out or leave that's fine I hear I'm anointed I don't care what anybody says all I care about is what God says that's how hard to say but that's the truth remember there's quotes from a person I wish I'd have to bring this message on my own self I don't want to hurt people but I remember that quote from the church age brother Graham said but if I don't preach it and you said Jesus will send me to hell remember that from the church ages if brother Eminem preached these things about the Trinity and the false baptism and the cutting the hair and the makeup and all this adultery and all these things if he didn't preach it he disobeyed Christ and he did he'd be a worker iniquity and be sent to hell that's for all of us we've all got to stand with the truth how many gonna stand with the truth I am seasons for 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying which means building up building up the person that's right in the email I try to thank the sabbatarian thank you for your study thank you for your time but here's where we disagree try to build him up pray about it he says that it may Minister grace to the ears so most of our words are going to be kindness and grace to people we have to we have to tell them the truth we have to differ with them but we have to say it in a kind graceful way right like people invite me oh let's go bowling on Wednesday night or let's uh can your children watch this movie I have to say oh I'm sorry you know I just say with grace I'm sorry you know we have church Wednesday night and that takes precedence over a birthday party bowling on Wednesday night you know I appreciate that but oh you know we like to do or that that movie might be good but let me read the reviews and my wife and I we'd like to preview the movies before our children watch them because Satan might slip some awful stuff on there and then who's accountable I am well I'm sorry they can't go to the movie theatres with you I'm sorry about that but that's that's that's how we you know the Bible says said no evil thing before their eyes right I've said no wicked thing before my eyes so see we have this we have to be up they'll have the law of kindness we must minister grace to the ears all right so we keep building her resume well John I've been talked about his resume I bet it's a pretty good resume from brother John but this is a pretty godly resume here for the proverbs 31 woman she speaks wise and gracious words look at this woman look at this godly woman right proverbs 31 27 and I got I got four minutes on my 15 I get I told you okay I'll try to stop there 27 I'm sorry proverbs 31 27 I'm in Ephesians she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness so in other words Church she's a dedicated guide of the home she knows everything that's going on in the home and she's very active not I don't know what does the Bible call idle busybodies the Bible calls them going from house to house basically gossiping right so we know that's what idleness is spending your time gossiping spending your time on things that don't promote the welfare of others they don't build people up right so this woman was not involved with that she was constantly trying to make the home a better place and she didn't partake of idle words and idle moments remember she's not rejoicing now she's gonna work hard now then she'll rejoice at the end of her life amen so what is it now what is she let's add to a resume now she's extremely focused manager of the home just you know this is why I've been called to do I've got jobs on the side here but but I can do those but still be focused right here right I know what's going on here and she's an active worker in her home she's not getting into other people's business she's just taking care of her own business that's this is a godly woman now let's stand here and let's just read that let's listen as we stand here let's listen what is going to happen to a woman who has all this wisdom flowing from her heart of fear of God what are the people in her house gonna say about her proverbs 31:28 so see now we're done we have gone through all those and I want I want to put those on a slide and just I just want to be overwhelmed and I want to be challenged by all the attributes this woman has so I may have that next week by God's next Wednesday night because I just want to be challenged with that I want to be blessed by that and I'd also like to do this I may be one more sermon on this I like to take all those attributes and then place it for her time period of her life so for example you know married without children married with young children married with older children and empty nest wouldn't it be nice to kind of place those so you could see which which stage of her life were these for I think that'd be really nice but I think you know if we read it again I think God would show us which stage were in right or if the sisters let's look at this that says because let's look at verse 28 her children arise up and call her slave-driver did I read that right no now they rise up so they were down maybe little we'd say but they rise up so once they get older they'll call her blessed and I'm a witness to that I didn't like my mom very much growing up cuz I was a sinner I didn't say much good things about or growing up but now if anybody asked me also I'm gonna say his good things I'll say we differ on this I hope my mom grows out her hair I hope she stops wearing makeup I love my momma my even children my children even witness to her about makeup last time at the house in a very godly way and I tell her to her face I'll tell her the differences that we have but if somebody asked me now I'll praise my mom and say thank God she prayed for me all those days thank God she drugged me to church you said your parents drugged you yes they drugged me to church that's right they drugged me to church and very thankful for that her children rise up call her blessed her husband also and he praises her so brothers you need to do that to your wife your wife does something good praise her and mean it from your heart don't overuse it like I overused I told my wife you're the best cook in the country and I just joke around about that but you know bro Graham used that one it gets overused you know tell her how pretty she is you know I like that new dress or you know all your hair looks pretty like that you know when you wear like that but also bless her for all that she does in the home because I think I told you before but you know when my wife's been sick and I've had to take care of the whole home I'm worn out at the end of one day I'm exhausted my feet her from being in the kitchen all day and back hurts from leaning down and doing all the work you know I just hold all the children all day you know I just I'm tired of the day they do a lot of great amazing work and the Holy Spirit tells us why right here this is her this is her position her husband also and caught and he praises her verse 29 many daughters have done virtuously right but thou excels this woman excels all of them this woman is this is a special woman and just like Christ was an amazing a perfect immortal man we could never live up to that we should strive to live as close to like Christ as we can glory and sisters you should strive to be like this woman this one excels all the other ones this one and how did it start she feared the Lord that's how it started verse 30 favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feared the Lord she shall be praised so at the end of this woman's life what are some of the rewards that she has her children bless her her children don't curse her and run her down her children bless her and her husband praises her this is what a godly life will produce the people you're closest to will bless and praise you right and how many want to live like that we're the people around you no you're not pretending you're not perfect but you've got the perfect one inside of you correcting you every day my children know I'm not perfect I get tired I get worn out I get discouraged but I hope I trust they see Christ in me that I'm trying I and I and I trust by God's grace they'll raise up and call their mother blessed and I always I tried to praise my wife on Facebook and also to her face as well I try to do that often to let everybody know how much I appreciate my wife for all she does look at verse 30 give her what the fruit of her hands in other words let her reap what she has sowed let all this love and all this work and all this effort and all this diligence let it all flood back to her because Jesus is gonna say well done enter into the kingdom the joys that been prepared for you from the foundation of the world if you invest in in your family your children in your church in your community and helping the poor if you invest all that it'll all come back to you how many believe that God will not owe you one penny he will pay you back right amen give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gate so she she wasn't praising herself but her works praised her everybody said my this woman she just does she just does wonderful things when does she sleep when does she have time for anything she has certain stages of her life she found what God wanted her to do and she poured herself into that for the glory of God that's just our head seers were closing by the grace of Lord next time maybe I didn't get to this but I want to get to this but like I said the timing of the

to the scripture hallelujah before your coming and we can see this is the kind of character that the Word of God will produce these are the works these are the actions in the lives of the sisters that we should expect and then as brothers we can take encouragement and we can also learn spiritual lessons or that we can be more diligent that we can close ourselves we can put on the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah we can live such a life of holiness that it shines such a bright reputation on our wives and our family hallelujah Jesus hallelujah if we have an enemy it's not because we made them or or
