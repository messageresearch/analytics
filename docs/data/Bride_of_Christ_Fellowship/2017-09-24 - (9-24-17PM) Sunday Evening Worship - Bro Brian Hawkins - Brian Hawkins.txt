singing songs those worries seemed to melt away a little bit and get your mind set and prepared to get ready for for the Word of God that's what we want to do this evening is prepare our hearts regard minds to receive what the Lord would have to have to say to us to see them if you would standard once all the minute just get straight into it if you would turn with me to proverbs chapter twenty five thirty point eight also in proverbs twenty five twenty eight it says he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that has broken down and without walls James 4:17 says therefore to him that knoweth that knoweth to do good do with it not to him that knoweth to do good and do with it not to him Thanksgiving is humility in our heart nothing sacrifice that you've made for us we are something now we belong to you we are your people all condemnation is away from us there's this is our heart then what can stand in our way or any of that to be on our way tonight or God but if we have something if we have a need from you tonight just pray that you would move everything out of the way Lord if there's something wrong in our hearts we pray to it make it make it known unto us Oh father Norval we don't want any hindrance tonight the Lord we want to reach out to you and receive what we have need Oh Lord we ask that you just be in the service help me to minister your word to your people tonight you just a calling that you place being back slid or just questioning their walk with you and wonder if they should step away we just we just want to try to head those things off and try to encourage a soldier of the cross to continue on and and to fight the good fight of faith so Lord with with your help we just do that tonight father we ask it your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen it may be seated thank you for your attention this morning Oh y'all are always a good group to come and talk to let's turn to First Samuel chapter 15 I'm just going to kind of talk a little bit on try not to preach it too much just just want kind of talk to you like we were sitting in my living room just talked to you for a little bit just like we were sitting down kind of like a Bible study type type deal First Samuel chapter 15 and 24 it says and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turning in with me that I may worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel now beforehand if you know the story which every Bible reader should know the story is that Saul was specifically told to slay everything all the Amalekites all the all the goats all the sheep and not keep anything he was supposed to destroy all and which he did not so he had a specific instructions and he didn't obey Anna as we read in James 4:17 therefore to him that knoweth to do good it's all new to perform a specific order he knew he should have carried it out but and do with it not to him it is sin so when Samuel had confronted him with this wrong saw knew that he did wrong he knew it but he was just afraid of what the people was what they were going to think as he said I feared the people and obeyed their voice instead of giving God the honor just like we were talking about Eli and his sons that he was more concerned about his sons he doesn't you could kind of take it how you want but you can kind of view it as as I he didn't want to hurt their feelings or he didn't want to get in an uproar over but it it is said in the scripture which we didn't read it that that Eli had given more honor unto his sons than then under God which we know that honor should be bestowed upon God you know we ought to honor God more than brothers and sisters and and prophets evangelists you know God is the one that needs to be honored above all for he is king of kings and the Lord of lords he is all and above all and the creator of all so we should always put the praise and thanksgiving up above to exalt God amen and I pray that that will always be my song is that I will give God praise I praise itself that's always my desire and I wouldn't fall short of that being far from us that we would give more honor unto unto man that is only here as a vapor been Oh a little while back I was I was having some issues that I wanted to discuss with with some people unfortunately I didn't I didn't get to discuss those issues because I do it would start a conflict I do or at least I think I know sometimes you think you know something you're afraid to do something because you think it's going to have a certain turn out and that sometimes you do that it has a completely different turn out that what you thought so I had some predetermined thoughts that things were going to go a certain way so that's why I didn't want to talk to discuss those issues because I don't like to argue except it fits in with my own family of course that's I generally don't like to argue especially over Scripture I don't I don't like confrontation I don't like contention I don't I don't like conflict not to say that I can't handle it but I just don't like those situations and I generally get nervous because I know I've seen what it can turn into so I like to discuss things we can discuss the scripture some people like to argue and debate Scripture and if you don't see it their way they get pretty heated and if you don't see it their way you're going to hell and I just don't like those kind of confrontations because it doesn't really it's not beneficial it's not edifying I meant so when I get what I get defensive I get pretty angry so I try to stay away from that because I don't like the spirit of anger upon me because sometimes when people get angry they they're they're you're out of your mind and some people just don't know what they're doing and they take things a little too far whether it gets to fisticuffs fighting or just like Cain and Abel you know ends up in killing one another but uh one night brother Jim was ministering and I thought it just struck me I thought wow how true that is and so I wrote it down and I just write my notes down of what might possibly possibly preach on or were to discuss with you know just have a topic of discussion with with people and so I want to share that thought with you tonight we were around a campfire I didn't think that it would amount to much and our Labor Day meetings we had a campfire testimony service and people were testifying I was thinking about there wasn't really anything great that had happened I can't think of any testimony I just couldn't think of it not that nothing happened you know within the family even a even a healing of sicknesses of testimony for us and you know we appreciate those things but I couldn't think of anything all that kept coming to my mind was this thought and a brother had said one time he said you know I've learned that when I'm sitting here and I feel that I should say something and I I sit here and I battle with it I'm not going to say anything I'm not going to say anything but something keeps pushing what just go ahead and say he said you know I found out when I when I eventually said I give it and I say it that somebody says I absolutely needed that thank you so much for sharing that that has really helped me he said that uh that's what that's when he learned that he should just say it anyways there's a because it might help somebody so that feeling that you have to try to hold back that's probably not the Holy Spirit trying to hold you back trying to help somebody man so that's the other fellow that's probably trying to hold you from helping somebody Amen but what I'd like to speak on I'll talk to you about tonight as a fear of conflict causes compromise we might try to avoid conflict and in a pieces situation so it doesn't get out of control because if you've gotten into some heated discussions some people get out of control it's like a defense mechanism when when people get uncomfortable you know I've heard it said that you know people get uncomfortable when you I don't know how they could say this you know if there's another when there's an elephant in the room you know if people are uncomfortable talking about the elephant in the room yeah and it's something big and noticeable but nobody wants to discuss it so some there are some topics out there that are uncomfortable talking about if you see somebody that you are doing something that you don't exactly agree with you kind of feel I don't really want to talk about it you know but it's okay to confront somebody with something look I disagree with what you did you know so you don't have to go and yell with them in their face and and you know just put them down but there's there's a way that you can go and talk to people you know some people are really good at it probably sales salesmen those are good salesmen you know this can put you down in a nice way but it's on how you on how you deal with people it's like people that I work with we have some apprentices and I just feel humbled when they tell me I'm glad I got to work with you I told one fellow I said you know you did a good job today I appreciate you doing a good job and doing what you did you did a good job he said coming from you that means something what do you mean he said cuz other guys and we might not do anything all day and then they tell me at the end of the day that good job well we didn't do anything but I've had a couple tell me that they part me out I don't mean to lift myself up by any means but I'm just trying to illustrate that I need a couple tell me that they'd like to work with me because I try to show them things and I try to teach them something and if we have some down time I try to take them to something else to try to show them and instead of just sitting there doing nothing because you're not gonna learn anything doing nothing right staring at the wall you just learned what color the wall is you know what pattern is on the wall and that that's all you're going to do but what I'm getting we need challenged a meant is we need something to come against us sometimes we need a little conflict in our lives we need something to get us out of our comfort zone because one it's not that it's going to shake you from your faith but it's going to rattle you a little bit to find out it's going to let you know where you stand with the Lord if you're going to you know God tested the children of Israel as far as you know he would do different things and I can't remember if it's the numbers he's we're an exodus I can't remember which one it is but he said I tried you to see if you would stay with me to stay see if you would stay loyal to me so it's nice to have conflict it's not so nice when you're going through it but it's nice to know when somebody asks you why do you believe what you do why do you go to church and then you might get that uncomfortable while they're gonna try to rail me and bring all kinds of accusations and put me down and maybe they maybe they're genuinely asking because they they see something in your life and so sometimes people get defensive right away with that conflict is well that's a good question why do I believe what I why do I say I believe something or why do I stand for truth what truth am i standing up for what exactly do I go to church why don't I drink why don't I smoke why don't I go to clubs and the movie theater and the bowling alleys and and the different things that people were refrained from doing it's because you don't want to be in those atmospheres at least that that's my my reasoning I don't want to be in those type of atmosphere because I used to do those things and that's not to be entangled with being bondage and entangled with the yoke of bondage of what we were before so we try to shun the very appearance of evil and then so that's why I don't like to do those things brother Branham said you know I smoked all I want I drink all I want to do all these things I do all I want to do but I don't want to do those things the Lord has taken that desire from ease so I don't want to be as a dog returning back to his vomit so when somebody asks you about Trinity or why don't you see the Trinity the way that they do or why don't you see the rapture is pre-trib or post-trib whichever they they believe or wherever you stand or however you sit why don't you see it the same way that I do it's going to check you to see what you actually believe but like I said we we may try to avoid that kind of conflict too because if you know people that try to argue it and argue it and put you down with it you're going to be a little bit more defensive but when we do that when you have that fear of conflict you tend to compromise on the way on where you stand because you don't want to explain how you believe or because of a fear of something coming back at you or somebody railing against you do you see what I'm trying to say is when you had that fear that you don't want to confront the truth or make the error or to try to correct the error sometimes people compromise because if you don't correct something if you see somebody robbing a bank and you don't say hey you shouldn't be robbing a bank then and you're there you don't try to stop it you're you're kind of like an accomplice I mean not not exactly I mean you're not going to get charged for being accomplished but if there's something that you could have done to avoid it then you have become a part of it I can't think of the scripture now but there is a scripture about not partaking of the things that they do in the darkness you know I don't think people like conflict because they don't want to offend people maybe people like offending others so maybe that's why they like conflict but I just think that it's it's better to to be upfront and to show where you stand to be bold and and speak the truth speak of why I mean if there's a Bob Harrod woman that's somebody that's that cuts her hair a woman that cuts our hair and she'd be in the room or something and and they ask why don't you cut your hair and well I don't want to offend you you know but go ahead and say it because you can say it in love there you know so if you're going to stand for something stand for it but if you if you fall you're gonna fall for anything hey man so we've got to have a backbone in this in this day you've got to stand for something what is conflict everybody knows what conflict is I'm sure just to kind of give definition a little bit it's a state of disagreement or disharmony between persons or ideas or a clash to fight or to contend it's a battle or it's a warfare it compromise compromise is a weakening or reduction of one's principles or standards I was getting a an infusion uh in August it was a little bit ago anyway and the night nurse practitioner that was administering the infusion uh that I battled Crohn's disease I'm not going to say I have Crohn's disease I'm not going to say I suffer from Crohn's disease but I battle Crohn's disease because I don't want it there it doesn't belong here so I don't want it and but she had I told her some things that some of the things that I was going through and she decided to get a little bit adamant about telling me that I have a certain disease she's like getting in my face and you have such a such as ease you have such a such disease and she said it like three times in a row and I didn't really like that but the way that I the way you know why do people make that personal like it's a license plate or something or like like it's my pet dog you know and they say well how's your Crohn's well it's not my Crohn's for one thing and second of all we don't get along very well and I want to give it back you know we don't have a good relationship I don't like it and but it wants to stay on me it's kind of like one of those ankle-biting dogs that love you no matter what they'll follow you anywhere but I don't how battling it so that's all I'm gonna say is I I keep giving I keep giving it back where it belongs and I just keep giving back to the devil but I just never understood why people well how is your Crohn's like I put my name plate on it like I wanted it you know I got dibs I didn't do that you know it wasn't my choice well when I converse with people I tend to I tend to nod my head and say yeah because I'd like to keep the flow of conversation going and let the person know that I'm paying attention to what you're saying you know okay yeah so he says where she told me you have such a such disease and I'm sure yeah you know wait a minute that's not what I meant you know I wasn't shaking my head in agreeance so I was fueling that in my heart and that's not how I feel and immediately I just went to the Lord and you know I was thinking of my mind and praying on my heart Lord that is not what I meant I did not want to confess to this disease that I had this that I had this disease I did not want that confession so in my heart I always checked right away lord I did not mean that you know please forgive me if I gave a negative confession but where I made a mistake was is I didn't correct the error - this - Beth is her name I didn't make a correction to that because I I felt that it was going to lead to conflict you know because she's not a I had already given a testimony excuse me I've had to experience with her already but I testified of how the Lord took cigarettes away from me and she's she combated it with well if you want to quit something if a person wants to quit they can quit no you don't understand because I wanted to quit I tried to quit and I couldn't quit no matter how much I wanted to quit because I had butts on my garage floor that I would go back if I tried to quit I might made it a day but that next day I was back in the garage trying to take a hit off that cigarette or something now I was trying to find something to ease that craving I tried cigars I tried candy nitride snuff but I tried almost everything except acupuncture and medication with some of that stuff out there isn't very good I've heard chantix you know give some people nightmares and it makes some people think they're in paradise so it it's kind of playing roulette with with something like that but but one day April April 19th of 2002 was the last day I ever had a cigarette and to me that was a miracle I don't care what any doctor says yeah some people might have been able to quit but I couldn't I tried to quit and I wanted to quit because I didn't want to pay the money for it but I'm telling you what after after that April nineteenth day I was working midnight shift and and I bummed a cigarette off of a guy it would have been a couple days later I had have had to crave a much lissa a week you know so within a week a week's time I couldn't stand the smell of cigarette smoke which before it would have stirred up the craving to make me want one so to me that was a miracle now that nobody's gonna talk me out of that with you anyways so I had already had a confrontation with her before I mean it wasn't I knew that she was going to continue to stay in her ground and I was going to stay in my ground because I wasn't gonna get shaken because it happened to me I was there when it happened so that's something when you could have that experience as you can remember you could point back to that that happened to me Amen but uh this is another situation now I was thinking about along with wanting to talk about people was the listener nurse practitioner Beth that I have felt that I had compromised on my stand with my confession of healing because I didn't want to I didn't want to engage in that conflict so to me by not saying anything that was agreeing with that you see what I mean now if I'm confusing you I apologize I God's not the author of confusion so I don't want to I don't want to be the confusion so because I didn't battle that and correct that I just felt that I had compromised and it just made me sick in my heart you know my heart just sunk I can't believe I did that I should have said something to combat not that I want a contentious spirit I don't I don't like that I used to be like that I don't I don't want to be like that again again the scripture says be not a tank with the yoke of bondage again but some people are just timid they're their meat they're quiet not having a contentious spirit right I can't help but think of piglet you know if you've seen Winnie the Pooh piglets that real meek and timid a little creature but I'm not saying that we should be training as cage fighters either but dialled oh brother jewel for me no brother jewel forty told a story at one time or if he would pray for somebody he would say if I brought you a box of rattlesnakes would you accept that box of rattlesnakes would you accept a box of rattlesnakes would you accept a box box around snakes Malakai no I wouldn't accept the box of rattlesnakes so why would I accept the confession of a disease I don't want to accept that I also think of Shamgar Shamgar he only took so much from the Philistines according to the story of according to the version that brother Branham gives because there's only a small portion of Scripture it doesn't describe Shamgar very well only that he slew 600-650 I can't remember the amount of what it was about Philistines but brother brother branham went on to tell the story of how they would come an army would come of so many men and would take their harvest every year and do whatever else that the army wanted to do and there was nothing Shamgar could could do about it until one day now if you notice we are weak until the Lord shows up and I just see that in the Old Testament Saints and and even even the New Testament Saints well all of them all of them were weak until the Lord showed up so the Lord well he promised to go and fight the battle for us is that right so he told that to get in he told that to two other men of faith said I will go before you I can't remember where where it was but I've been thinking about the there's a picture hanging up in here about the different names of God and and one is the strength of Israel they call him the strength of Israel and I never caught that before until I think it was today I was reading through reading through the Bible and it was capitalized strength you know that he is the the strength of Israel but we are weak until he shows up when we allow him to have his way what's going to stand in our way he said what what weapon formed against these shall prosper but of how Shamgar he can only take he only took so much of about the the pilfering and the pillaging as a he had enough so we don't have to sit in a corner and let people bully us and we don't have to sit in the corner and uh just people tell us that we're worthless and tell people that our Bible is dead that our God is dead that this Bible is a myth our God is a myth we don't have to stand in a corner and take that kind of you're only going to take so much event until you could stand okay I can't think of that that term now your righteous indignation comes up and that you stand for truth it's okay to stand for truth amen but if you if you back an animal in a corner and they feel threatened they go into a defensive mode to try to survive you try that with a dog you try to corner a dog or raccoon or something and you try to get them you know I'm I'm saying not a not a tame dog I mean you're gonna be able to go get your little pooch in the corn you know I'm saying you try to let's use a wild animal like a raccoon or a possum and yeah or skunk and you try to get one of those you back them up at a corner and you're gonna be surprised even a groundhog the groundhog can get pretty uh big run or get pretty violent because it's a survival mode with with the animal kingdom but we don't have to we don't have to take that kind of abuse duh but I think of I it seems like I'm kind of getting I want to move on I want to progress here so I think of brothers and sisters that have that have left the faith and I I really want to go talk to them I want to persuade them back and but it's a mind battle to me to go talk to them because like I said I don't like the contention but we don't have to cower in fear we've been taught that brother Branham tardis said that faith has muscles on faith has muscles that we come boldly to the throne of God man so we don't have to kneel an oppression just because we get a little uncomfortable doesn't mean we have to compromise with our faith to fit in but uh I just think of let's you could turn to Matthew 26 69 I apologize I kind of feel like I'm rambling Matthew 26 what I want to say is we don't have to feel bad when we do fall if we do find ourselves in that condition you don't have to beat yourself up though because even Peter did he did the same thing Matthew 26 and 69 it says now Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying now also what's with Jesus of Galilee but he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth and again he denied with an oath I do not know the man and after a while came unto Him they that stood by and said to Peter surely thou also are one of them for thy speech be wrathy which that means that your speech is showing who you are because you talk like it's being made manifest of of who you are then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crew and Peter remembered the word the word of Jesus which said unto him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out went out and wept bitterly now there's an issue if we deny Christ and we continue on in that same condition but there's a difference when you catch yourself like Peter did here he went outside and he realized what had happened and he wept bitterly now so see if you can repent not a dry eye confession well well I'm sorry you know just whatever no but if you really mean it if you're really sincere you're weeping within yourself or weeping on the outside whatever it is you can weep bitterly in repentance saying lord I didn't mean that I don't want that kind of a spirit on me I don't want to deny you because the scripture tells us if you deny him he's going to done deny you now I don't want to be that in that way again here's a story with Peter it's and Galatians two and verse seven I'm gonna go I'm gonna read seven and then skip to eleven because I just want to establish something in verse seven well it's already established but I just want to point it out but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed on to me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter excuse me I yeah I did say it's a story about Peter but Paul is saying that he is called to the uncircumcision and Peter was called to the circumcision so just establishing that adversity lemon it says but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were the circumcision see the fear of the conflict fear of being railed on he separated himself and he went with the circumcision which it which is of the Jews and the other Jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation or that means their hypocrisy or their deceitfulness at verse 14 it says but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel not according to his opinion but according to the truth of the gospel I said unto Peter before them all if thou being a jew live after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us thou the gentiles to live as do the jews so he's trying to Paul saw what they were teaching that part that Peter was teaching falsely and living in hypocrisy at that point in time is uh trying to appease the Jews and trying to appease their opinion but he was wanting the Gentiles to do the same as his Jews when he's telling the Gentiles and it doesn't matter so he's kind of talking out of both sides of his mouth to try to appease the different groups that's kind of the way that I think about it but what I want to get at is Paul had no problem confronting Peter about this situation because Paul was just a it was a bold man to begin with he wasn't a pigley he wasn't a timid little creature so we know Paul didn't compromise to try to save Peters feelings maybe he didn't care if it hurt his feelings or not a matter of fact I think he wanted to hurt his feelings to get him into the truth to get him back according to the truth of the gospel and I don't want to talk just kind of give another example there's a Exodus 32 in Chapter 1 excuse me 32 and verse 1 everybody okay this evening Exodus 32 and 1 it says and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the Mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we wot not what has become of him now we spoke earlier this morning about the servant that that was getting upset you know saying that the lord delayeth is coming I couldn't help but notice that I think I noticed that this mortar or something when I was looking at man is Moses there thinking that Moses is delaying his coming down from the mountain and uh how we talked about with it the evil certain servant when they see that the lord delays is coming that they start fighting and and start drinking and and and the different things so this is the same thing as I where Moses Moses delayed his coming and the people started to they wanted to worship other gods but I thought you know through impatience people will start to they start to fall away to to find something else to follow or worship you know they try to find something else like I was saying earlier that when we get cleaned out we got to fill it with God you know we got to fill that void with with something of righteousness but I thank God that there's something that keeps holding me amen there's there were times that I wanted to quit there were times that I didn't I didn't want to continue on you know it just felt like it was I wasn't getting anywhere just kind of stuck in a Retton you know like I said this morning that I've had I've had times I'm not even I'm not even worthy to beer you know what point is there to go on oh you know just the different mind battles and and if you let those mind battles hammer you and hammer you and hammer you you tend to believe it after a while if you don't combat that you're going to compromise and remember what compromise is is a weakening or a reduction of one's principles or standards so maintain the standard of righteousness amen then I was just second there's a scripture there you know when when the enemy comes in like a flood but I just I'm gonna try and stick to to the text of yeah yeah an errand said unto them verse 2 and Aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and fasted it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made a proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the Lord and it's capitalized Lord is capitalized so there's a difference there so he's not talking about the golden calf and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play like I said through people's impatience because they can't hold on for the time that's coming they can't hold on when they get impatient they don't see things happening of what they should they tend to follow us something else because they can't follow they're compromising their faith to follow something else which is it got a saving you know something that's going to cause them to fall for time say god I didn't want to be very lengthy tonight but I was good though that's Elijah in the 450 prophets of Baal you know just continue on but they're in John John chapter 9 and verse 19 John nine and nineteen it says and they asked them saying is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he now see his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now see if we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words spake his parents because they feared the Jews see because out of fear they compromised they chose not to say anything because I didn't want to get kicked out they were afraid of losing their meal King and I think it's how it was preaching no because they feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he is of age ask him then again then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give God the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no I know not one thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see you know you couldn't take that away from him just like I was talking about cigarettes and stuff like that the drinking it and just my old life you can't take that away from me I'm not going to tell you that something else happened because to save your feelings and it's not happening so he was the same way I don't know one thing I know is I was blind now I see then said they to him again what did he do to thee or what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again or why would you hear it again will you also be his disciples I like how he turns the tables on we know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing they you know not from whence he is and yet he have opened my eyes now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth His will him he hear it you know this guy isn't even a Pharisee or sad you see or well-educated person such as such as that and he could see this so see it comes to the simple you don't have to be a scholar to be able to see how God can move hey man oh the first 31 he says now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and do with his will him he here since the world began was it not her that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind this is something new that people are seeing if this man were not of God he could do nothing see the confession in the testimony that this man has he's turned it from them railing on him to where he's preaching to them and they answered and said unto him that was altogether born in sins and dust south teach us and they cast him out they couldn't take it anymore because they're like I said they were trying to then this man maintained his profession for he was the one who was blind and they were trying to get it out of him what did he do did he do some kind of a magic thing that he getting is there some kind of a magic ointment of course it's not in there but but I'm just I'm just going on a pseudo means so they're looking for some other avenue to explain what happened and these are supposed to be the religious people that they they can't even see God to know that this has never happened before this is something new that we're seeing and if any man be a worshipper of God and do his will God's gonna honor that in here so this man is doing the works of God and you're trying to call him a sinner but the Pharisees kept pushing and pushing it wasn't this guy who kept pushing he answered and said why do you have to hear it again but it was the Pharisees that kept pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and just like Shamgar Shamgar could they take so much he says up but he just he just spoke up he didn't fall apart under their pressure instead of getting under upset he preached to them and put them in their place then they got all embarrassed and they're the ones who got upset so he didn't compromise no matter what kind of pressure was to to get him to doubt he maintained his profession and that's what I want to and go through all this that's what I want to get at is don't compromise on your stance with God because somebody's trying to pressure you into doing something else I'm gonna bring this to a close but there's something not with just not just with other people there's a fear of conflict with oneself so what do you mean by well have you ever had the thought that well I've come this far now what's it matter if I'm if I continue on I've already committed the sin what's it whether you held a beer in your hand or you took a sip of beer why I've already come this far what's it going to hurt if I continue and just drink a six-pack or a 12-pack where do you stop if you know that what you're doing is wrong when you come whether it be on a website of a pornography or whatever it might be whatever how whatever the situation might be you might say to yourself and it's just a philosophy and it's just trying to be a justification to continue doing what you're doing but when you once you recognize I have a beer in my hand I'm not supposed to be drinking when you start thinking I'm already this far what's it gonna hurt and you finish that beer you could have said I've come this far I'm gonna stop I'm not gonna compromise my testimony I made a mistake I'm not going to continue in the mistake you can stop and repent repent means to turn go the other way right so you don't have to keep going when you get where you're not supposed to be you don't have to keep going you can stop and turn around I'm talking about temptation that's the that's it that's a conflict with oneself because it's a war against the flesh it's a flesh warring against the spirit it's warring against yourself because this flesh wants to experience a moment of pleasure whether it be adults or not that we want to do it but there are certain things that this flesh wants to wants to have so we war with the spirit that's within us because with my mind I follow Christ and I die out daily with my mind I follow Christ with my mind I'm having a mind battle I'm going to kick this thing out I'm gonna kick this desire out I don't want that desire here it doesn't belong here you don't have to harbor that if there's a bird coming to make a nest you don't have to let it make a nest there just because it lands doesn't mean that you have to let us sit there and make a nest you can knock that thing down but it's a war against the desires of the flesh but yeah what I what I want to get to is people tend to compromise with death thinking that it's better than their present situation which at that time seems hopeless to continue on which is suicide people tend to compromise with that they think that I'm not worth anything people might have told them well you're worthless you're useless nobody could use you nobody likes you you're ugly you're fat you're you're this I don't like being around you you I don't like the food that you eat I don't like this I don't like that people don't like to be told those things over and over and over and it gets people and despair it's better instead of speaking words of a doubt and discouragement and and uh trying to bring people down how about a word of encouragement we can combat those things by saying a soft answer turneth away wrath that's proverbs 15:1 a soft answer turneth away wrath you don't have to let somebody beat somebody else down verbally you don't have to don't put people down because you put them in that in that spot of despair where they feel that and I'm not saying everybody but people there are some people that are not as emotionally stable as what you are there are some people that are for lack of better terms weak minded weak spirited that they can't come back they're different things on their own or they need to help with the pressures that come their way so what are these people they think that I'm not useful enough I'm not good enough what's the purpose of me to continue on which somebody knows that person so they don't think at that point time it's a selfishness because they think that nobody loves them and they don't take into account of how many people around them that do love them maybe they don't tell them enough you know if you have a father and a mother brother and sister tell them you love them it seems like anytime my sister comes on my mind recently not that I can't think of the term now but anytime and I would think about my sister and uh I would want to text her I wouldn't do it and then I would text her her her husband was hurt getting hurt somehow every time I would text well but it doesn't hurt when you have somebody come on your mind text them call them whatever it is send a leave a note form hey I appreciate you you know I thank you for doing such and such what's it gonna hurt to take five seconds of your time to say something nice to somebody or to encourage somebody a co-worker a neighbor whatever it might be it might take five seconds so what if they grumble and complain I had a guy that I worked with years ago he told me I needed to be shot we were working midnight shift and uh I was on a steady midnight shift at the time and and uh I got a little bit happy because it was getting close to the end of the shift and I think I was kind of bouncing around a little bit then and I was singing I was happy because I was getting ready to go home and uh sometimes when I get I get tired I get a little goofy anyway but this man he says you know what you ought to be shot what he said there's nobody in the right mind that should be that happy on a midnight shift like that well what's it gonna hurt to give a word of encouragement to somebody so what if they say something and then you say something encouraging again it's gonna wear on him eventually so where they're gonna accept that you know they're going to see that hopefully you mean it you know and not say just just to go through motions you know I want people to have a good day you tell people have a good day but we say it's so so empty sometimes because it's just filling words that we say is that it becomes a common thing okay have a good day and but do you really may not really I want you to have a good day I pray that you have a wonderful day I have pray that you have the most wonderful day you've had in years or ever have you know what's wrong with saying something like that but spiritual suicide what is suicide suicide is a separating oneself when we know that death is separation from God so that spiritual suicide but suicide is the act or an instance of intentionally killing oneself the destruction or ruin of one's own interests whether it be political whether it be managerial in a company or whatever it might be or one who commits suicide it means to kill oneself commit suicide relating to embalming or resulting in one's voluntary death now what do you mean you might ask what do you mean about spiritual suicide because suicide means to separate oneself voluntarily so when you withdraw yourself from fellowship you are committing spiritual suicide because when you withdraw yourself from fellowship you draw your you take the strength away iron sharpens iron when you don't when you're not fellowshipping with saints of like precious faith when you're out there a fellowship in with the world instead of and instead of other Christians you're gonna fall you're gonna come remise you're going to go the way of the world you're not going to go in the way of faith that's spiritual suicide when you decide that you're not going to serve God anymore you now withdrew yourself or withdrawn yourself from fellowship with God you know those are the people that have been falling away and I have seen people fall away almost like it's a plague and it hurts to see people fall away I could understand disagreeing on on certain things but when you take it seems like when people completely take themselves out of fellowship or let's say out of the message ranks or whatever it is they completely stop being a Christian all together not just not just falling away from the message but falling away from God completely I don't understand it but we know the scripture tells us that there will be a great falling away before the before he comes amen I kind of want to close with this as a everybody knows what a faucet is or a spigot I heard this analogy one time about a faucet excuse me a faucet is very useful brings us water you can wash your hands you can fill fill jugs up fill pots and pans or whatever you need to do bathe your children bathe yourself you know a faucet is very useful but it's absolutely useless an order for a faucet to work there has to be something behind it there has to be a power behind it in order to be a useful tool so if it has no power then it becomes useless it just sits there so are you gonna be a closed faucet or are you gonna make open faucet you're gonna have the power of the Holy Ghost behind you are you gonna withdrawing yourself from fellowship go ahead and stand your feet hope I could say something to help you this evening there was an article that I had read by the man his name is thank you with matches he had an article conflict is an opportunity for grace and he says something that he really stuck out the statement that he made said for the Christian conflict is not something to avoid or ignore it is an opportunity for the triumph of grace amen straight to Stephanie father or just talking with the people tonight not so much preaching but just lay it on what's been on my heart recently just some things that I've been going through it just praying it would be help to somebody here jumping shouting message nor it's just something from the heart as Esther just created your word that was spoken tonight just be embedded in the hearts of your people here tonight father and that they would go strengthened with the with the power of the mind of the Holy Spirit tonight and Lord the Spirit is withdrawn from the Lord I pray that you would give it a refreshing of that Holy Spirit tonight on

something bad is going to happen it serves as many purposes and Lord we need your Holy Spirit in this day to keep this pure to keep the strong to so we can withstand the wiles of the devil and Lord just help us in this day in this hour - Lord maybe not be found without the armor of God but maybe we have that each piece of armor in place as we walk from day to day may be growing strength with you or God not compromising with pressure comes our way with conflict comes our way for Lord we know that in your scripture that trouser are worth more than then gold itself O God for it's in the triangle fire that molds us and shapes us and the more that we have adversity the stronger we get and the more grounded we get into your word Lord we appreciate those things we appreciate the tests and the trials that come our way and may we take it patiently and may we endure it patiently then we endured with prayers Thanksgiving and reading it in your Scripture to continue get stronger and stronger Oh God father those those that would be unbelievers those that had fallen away and then a Lord you know who is on my heart and lord I don't want to call our names tonight and Lord you you know who's on my heart and I can't stop thinking them when lord I just pray that that grace was just reached down it and strike him and his hardened and strike something in his mind and break him free of that bondage that was drawn withdrawn from fellowship or God I just pray that it would be with his family Lord I love him I appreciated and Lord I want to see it back and fellowship and Lord many others that have fallen away learned there's so many people that I could think of and uh when Lord those that are that are alive and remain Lauren I'm just praying that each one was safest state faithful and steadfast to that word of God I pray that you would be a brother Jesse and this whole congregation here that they would continue to press on and then they would continue to stand strong and faith and
