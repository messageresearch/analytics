introduce a new songs to us don't you god loves that because God said seemed to me a new song the old ones are classics and always will be singing them in heaven too but there's some about a new song praise God gives your fresh strength and joy that is such a tremendous blessing let me just say one thing let me give our brother little rose here why I can't I don't know when I'll get a chance but I walk in here sometimes on the weekends Oh appreciate that thank you but I just walk in on the weekends sometimes and brother Amen maybe here practicing songs all by himself and he's singing his heart to God and he's sweating he's so into it and that just means the world to me praise God and that a blessing praise God that just I just appreciate you so you're pouring yourself into a road just keep doing that if you found your purpose to life you just give yourself to that God will bless it it's a tremendous blessing to us praise God praise God amen thank the Lord all right let's take our Bibles here I like to preach on a little different thought just because there's some situations in the church I like to just look at a little simple thought called two different wins I just wanna look at two different wins kind of dealing with some doctrines recently that kind of haven't blown through the church and thankfully not through everybody but just mainly with the brothers so let's go to John chapter 3 I told you on Wednesday I would like to deal with it and I really want to get back to the purpose series you know and the gifts and everything like that but I do want to just clarify this and kind of show some of the things that were shared with me and the brothers and just cry try to give a balance to it by the Word of God and then Lord willing tonight we'll look at you know the kingdom of heaven I want to keep going on that series that's been a wonderful series I appreciate all the feedback you know some of the sayings have really enjoyed that so I thank the Lord for that so John 3:8 - there's two different kinds of wins right because we know a win represents the Holy Spirit or represents a spirit in this case well we only know there's two kinds of spirits that's the only kind and so it's either the Holy Spirit or it's the unholy spirit the spirit of Antichrist so John 3:8 let's all read that one together one two three the wind bloweth where it listeth and now here is the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit so think about the day of Pentecost you know they were gathered there they didn't know it was going to come on the tenth day you know Jesus said just wait until but they got in the condition for the winds to blow praying one Accord that means passion one passion everybody came with one passion to church that day you know not to church that day but uh upper room and the wind of the Spirit blew praise God because they were all in one Accord now the other one of course real familiar seasons 4:14 and there's a few others Lord willing we'll look at those I do want you to I don't want you standing for all these usually you know three is the maximum I've ever read for at acts three three portions of Scripture so Ephesians 4:14 encourage you before reduce you know be on your toes spiritually because Satan just needs one thing to get in he just wants to find one little weak spot it's that little that hidden 11 right with a parable we looked at a few weeks ago it's one word with Eve surely you shall not know we know that was a big word right cuz I totally changed the complete meaning of God oh you'll not die but it was still one word and Satan only needs one area of her life to open up and then he can get in there and get a stronghold so be on your toes you just don't say well brother oh she's just gonna teach today it's more than that it's the Holy Spirit trying to anchor our souls in the Word of God and it's trying to keep our lives leaven free if I can just say like that leaven free seasons 4:14 that we henceforth be no more children so see this kind of tells you where a person is in their spiritual life when they're getting tossed around by false doctrine tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight that means the gambling of man so sometimes men will come to the pulpit horse I've never believed in our church as far as I've seen and they'll just gamble those kind of trying to put things together and see for the people it'll bless the people but when you prayed and been with God you know gets gonna bless the people as long as they got humble hearts see some preachers were just and we know it's not around our groups our friends it's really not around us too much but we hear about it and they just gamble with the word is trying to get the people excited about something that's a shame by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but see we are speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so see false doctrine will cause people to stunt their growth they'll never grow into Christ any more from that point they can't grow any more because you can only grow the pure Word of God from the reign of God right because the we saw the sins choke out the effects of the word the cares of this world and of course that could be anything false doctrine whatever it is chokes out the effects of the word and the person will never grow with God Almighty let's have a word of Prayer here if you haven't eaten your heart just make a note unto the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy and your grace we're happy to be in your house and lord I just thank you for your presence Lord your songs in which it's a glory to lift our names to your great name Lord God hallelujah listen lift our voices to that great name Lord we thank you for this opportunity Lord just let your word be preached Lord God and let us Lord as we said let's watch our lives and and father keep them pure before you examining ourselves to make sure we're in the faith Lord God for Lord the spirit of truth is here Lord God because there's two or three gathered in your name and here you are you are the spirit of truth let your Holy Spirit dwell amongst us Lord and lord teach us a clean us purge us keep us pure before your Lord and we just thank you for all things in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you be in see the praise God after but there's of course numerous scriptures about wind and we'll get to those in just a moment I just kind of want to mention a few by the grace of the Lord of course I think you've seen them one of most important ones there's you know John 3:8 with the Lord Jesus so Lydia should be up there whenever you're in yeah there's two spirits or two winds and we see it by the scripture now let me turn to the page here I got a few notes here now we know in the beginning the Spirit of God hovered above over the waters in Genesis praise God we might say that's the first wind at least in Scripture of course we know there was a wind in heaven right Satan's false Drinan the war that he started in heaven and brother Babson wars represent after winds represent Wars praise God so it's kind of like when God moves it's battling up its battling and coming against the evil forces praise God because don't you know the Bible said God's a mighty warrior to st. likes to fight wars but God's my army so much stronger amen he's got the real wind of power Amen hallelujah but Satan of course he's allowed to have power there is power of darkness and we never make fun of Satan we never mock Satan people that I've seen that have fallen into some awful trials they mock Satan and call them dumb devil and things like that we never want to say things like that let's not be guilty of things like that you must respect your opponent if you go into a match and you don't respect your opponent you're gonna get knocked out and we never want to we're never want to disrespect Satan what we do want to do is we want to bring authority against him and we want to be bold against him praise God but we don't want to mock him unless you're like Elijah then you can do that you got the spirit of Elijah on you go ahead and I know some people say that we got the bride has Elijah spirit but I don't know about that church I don't know I'm not a prophet I don't prophesy I don't see visions and I don't say thus saith the Lord and I know there's some quotes and I don't things like that but remember you better take every quote back to the word because you get yourself in a pretty strange situation now all the women have the spirit of Elijah on them too you know and you see you got to take every quote back to the word that's what we're seeing as time goes on we're seeing that more and more we've got to be more balanced in the Word of God right like brother man told Perry green you keep your balance in the scriptures I've always appreciated that statement and that's what brother Branham says the and he says that in different words and the message he said the greatest gift the most important thing of the day is a man who can rightly divide the word of God see because it's either gonna allow life the right wind to blow through the church or it's gonna let the wrong wind blow through the church praise God so we want to recognize those two kinds of winds now it's all through the scripture about the winds I'm just gonna hit a few highlights the Bible said in Hosea 87 I preached on this a few years ago they sow to the wind and then they weep Oh a whirlwind so see they plant or they they do evil things and they plant seeds of rebellion and so they're gonna reap a whirlwind we preach on that a few years ago it's actually my book as well with America that's what America is experiencing now the whirlwind starting to form right we know birth pains right the earth is gonna break forth into a new day but it's gonna come through destruction atomic fire volcanic fire right it's gonna break forth into a new day but it's gonna reap all the effects of sin praise God and so there's the evil wind right the whirlwind they reap the whirlwind that's right but and then Jesus said you know what you go out to see a reed shake it with the wind wait to go to some some little wimpy preacher out there and oh he says he said you went out to see a prophet and I say more than a prophet John couldn't be swerved by those Pharisees than those Sadducees he couldn't be swear he knew where he stood he was stood with on the he stood on the well said I guess the sacred sands of God's presence amen because he God had told him when you see a dove he said then you'll know that this is the Messiah and then that's what he testified he said follow him that's the Messiah because I have seen the Dove and I know what I've seen from heaven he's the bridegroom I'm a friend of the bridegroom amen see cuz he knew where he stood praise God he wasn't shaken by any winds of doctrine remember in Ezekiel 37 with the dry bones and said prophesy to the wind hallelujah praise the Lord Amen he prophesied to the holy spirit prophesy for the holy spirit to to move praise God that's part of what I'm starting to understand the Bible said we have keys to bind and loose and sometimes it's too loose the movement of the Holy Spirit on people's lives now I know they impersonate it on TV like it's just it's a mockery every time they're on there there's some loose in a new season I'm loosing a new that I'm loose come on now and that's just it's going overboard that's all for a show but there is a genuine time when God is moving in your life there's certain crossroads of your life when you need deliverance or you need victory or you need to answer from God and a man of God may pray with you or a sister of God may pray with you and ask for something to be done and if it happens what just happened the keys of the kingdom cause something to be loosed upon your life amen hallelujah praise God and then of course the other one is buying the spirits right bind them right we bind evil spirits and and we we have we have authority to tell them to never come back praise God just like the Lord Jesus Christ did but we also have the authority under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to loose God's blessings upon people praise the Lord amen now here's another with the false doctor so you seem good the gods win and you seen Satan's win well you got a couple more acts tutu is a good one the wind of the Holy Spirit came in like a rushing mighty wind amen and we've had that here in our church thank the Lord for that hallelujah now here's two negative one so let's go to James 1:6 and Jude 12 James 1:6 and Jude 12 just to kind of need a refreshment right I don't think I've ever preached just one sermon on the wind James 1:6 but just to give you a little background here some more support I'd say from the Word of God James 1:6 now let's just read five because in context it's about being more patient and then asking God for wisdom if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wave earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed we don't want to be this kind of person right we ask God to do something and then we then a week later a month later a year later we're not sure if God heard us or not see the thing to do is get so sincere you're so desperate with God and to be so humble before God that you pray and that in that you know you've been totally sincere you were totally cleaned out when you prayed and so that you know you made your requests unto God God heard your requests and then you can have peace from that moment no matter what happens you know you ask God for wisdom and you know God's gonna answer no matter which way it goes praise God like romance are you're neutral with the will of God see but if you don't pray and fast if you don't seek God's face if you just throw like a half-hearted prayer up there and it's not genuine it's not sincere maybe we didn't maybe didn't confess your sins before you prayed about something and that's why people will wonder and just be discouraged for months or years on end it's because they didn't ask in faith they didn't ask believing and see and then they they're still leaning towards the selfish answer to the prayer because the Bible said later in James 4 they asked upon their lusts and that's why they get impatient but if you ever ask for something in faith you can be patient because jesus said impatience possess your souls Amen plenty of patience you can wait on God amen see because you've got the the divine character of patience the stature part of the statue of a perfect man amen glory see tossed about when they don't have the wisdom of God see some people as we'll get to here in a little bit people will take a quote from brother Branham and they won't even ask God for wisdom they'll just take up for face value what it says instead of really praying about Lord and they'll start sharing it with every every other people rather than actually praying about it first we ought to ask ourselves is this something I should share praise God and do I have the do I have the office to share it what am i sharing it for am i shared to edify or am i sharing to criticize see that's the trouble with social media or let's just say the trouble with group texts got to make sure you're sharing the right thing right so trouble with whatsapp and trouble with Facebook people get on there and I've seen it too you know nothing related to our church but people just post things and they'll criticize churches like this week this man I forget where he lives the United States but he's a message believer so call and he just gets on there and post something just to criticize preachers that preach longer than 30 or 45 minutes because he takes one quote where brother brand says you know you need to preach 30 or 45 minutes you know and but he leaves out all the other quotes where broadband says some fill up long some fill up easy you know he needs out that one praise God and they just get on there to criticize they say well in Mayas situation I experienced this that doesn't edify and it causes arguments and I'll tell you the biggest one is Christmas you all know that one right especially on Facebook if you haven't log into Facebook around December 10th or something like that Lydia's birthday you want to see some arguments oh man you get them going on Christmas boy they'll fight to the death for that one and don't get me wrong I mean obably there's a lot of work there's worldliness attached to any American holiday Thanksgiving you know eaten too much being a glutton that's an evil spirit shopping and the commercial spirit of money and and and the pride of the eyes and lust of the flesh and getting big deals and feel like you're something because of the money you have them that's pride and arrogance amen it takes a real Christian to get down live godly even in the even in the godly holidays see if you gotta be careful why we share things what's our purpose behind that and see the answers right here they don't even ask God for wisdom they don't even take enough time to ask God for it Oh something new I'll share it oh you better be careful don't share something just cause it's new wait on it especially if it's going to cause controversy verse 7 let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord see people that don't seek the wisdom of God they're not going to receive anything from God see they can't grow they can't move on with God like we said earlier false doctrine stops people right in their tracks and they can never move on with God and we're gonna show in just a minute it's a very good indicator they're not born again when people bring false doctrine and think about the churches all the churches you've been - I can see sister Karen she's probably thinking you know churches I've been to a Mike mm right you see people who's the people that bring the false doctrine they're the ones that are probably not born again unless they got a swift repentance and I mean a real one not just hey I'm sorry guys sorry hey let's go out - it's got to Burger King afterwards yeah that's not a repentance that's not a repentance you see every false doctrine has a devil behind it and he's trying to like a demon serpent he's trying to slither into your spiritual life to choke you out and then try to choke out other people and kill their influencing and just death he wants the D wants you to die spiritually and take your your your love for God take your love for people many times he wants them to exist exalt themselves because remember every demon stays because people love it that's what we're gonna see with some of these falls doctors when we go through these in just a minute there's just a couple there's devils behind it and the people that love false doctrine they love it because their false doctrine allows them to love the demon of whatever it is like that maniac he loved that demon of murder right because he went to kill brother branham he loved it and so that one couldn't be fully cast out because he loved it he worshiped it he liked the feeling of being strong and like he could beat somebody up he loved that feeling because he gave him strength all but if he only knew the strength of God's love amen where that's that love feels like this I just want to help everybody I just want to be a blessing to everybody praise God I don't want do anything wrong I just want to do good to everybody praise God such a glorious anointing is the love of God Jude when I say Jude 1:12 yeah there's only one chapter little big book Jude 12 now in verse 11 the context is Cain and Balaam one went after greed it was Balaam went after greed cain was just straight rebellion he was just straight rebellion and that's what we see we'll get to a little bit with all the people that don't like fivefold ministry the spirit they love behind it is rebellion they don't want to submit to any man but the Bible says submit to them preachers but they don't want to do that so they love the spirit of rebellion because it makes them feel like they're the ones in charge but see any real pastor any real man of God doesn't even like them they know all the the pressure that goes with being responsible for people's souls and it's not something they enjoy but it makes them humble it makes them like Moses and Aaron when Cora tried to come against him they threw themselves down on their faces before God and pleaded to God for the people that's what a real leader does Amen throws himself down at the altar seeks God's face and ask God for mercy because he knows our God is a consuming fire he don't play around it's a serious thing to fall into the hands of the Living God now I got not lots of notes and I didn't have there's so much on these things I I didn't have time maybe we'll continue next week I don't know but there's much to say and to do but let's go to Jude though Jude 12:11 was rebellion Keynes rebellious spirit because God said all he gate remember he gained the revelation the revelation is the will of God so God gave Cain though his will just do like your brother and you'll be accepted and you'll actually lead him but he turned it down he walked away because he went to rebel and then Balaam tho went after greed he said God give me a second perfect will and gods I don't have one perfect whale but you can walk in my permissive will if you want because I know you love money more than you love the Word of God so it's the error of Balaam Earth's well these are spots in your feasts of charity so see that's what we're having today we're having a feast of love today today's the love feasts praise God we're all feasting together we're just a family with the love of God in our hearts and we're just happy to be together and we're all feasting on God's Word but these these carriers of false doctrine are spots or defilement in our feast right when they come amongst us when they feast with you that's like brother ham says in Christ a minister of God revealed he said all your happy family now God said he said Saint won't let you stay that way and he said if he can't turn somebody in the church against one another he said he'll inject somebody with poison and then send him into the church why because it's right here see all these closer brother brand they all go back to the word amen glory we just got to look harder amen see they feed themselves without and there they are feeding themselves without fear now I got a good notion on that Scripture alright yeah because it seems like there's a parable Jesus tells where the householder is the one who feeds the meat in due season never know what I'm talking about there's a parable so see we're supposed to let the ministry the fivefold ministry is supposed to feed us but these that are carried about with winds they feed themselves they only hear what they want to hear now what God wants them to hear how do you know what God wants you to hear because it's right in the Word of God amen and these false doctrines that are propagated all around now that's not the Word of God and 99% of the time point 9 it's just quotes that are misunderstood it's not the word and it becomes a quote war a quote battle but thank God there's always more quotes in what they find that's what I found in every situation there's always more quotes and that way I'll show you today when they get a quote they think it's right they need to read before that and read after that and that's what they don't do what they do they ignore it see it's just being more thorough to being faithful it's be more diligent see clouds they are without water carried about sea of winds again so here we have again winds representing the evil spirit winds and they carry people that hold false doctrine like clouds they just carry them but there's no rain there's no real holy presence of God trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their shame oh my look at that what causes the waves wind praise God so the winds make their lives just there life is a total mess their life is one storm and all these storms and that's because of their own disobedience he says wanderingstar see they can't find a home church right wandering stars now of course everybody a home church that stays there we know isn't a sound believer because the devils can sit around for years and decades too but it's one of the signs that you are is when you're not wandering from pillar to post but you found your position in Christ it is one of the evidences because it's the evidences all the Word of God we looked at that recently to whom is reserved the blackness of Darkness forever now that's for those people who are predestinated to be lost we don't know whose predestinated be lost unless they already we're told in the Bible but to Pete men and women today who are live we don't know which side they're on but we got to issue warnings and we got to tell them if they got wrong doctrine and that's what I've done I've done it over the phone I don't believe the things that I've heard the winds and teachings I don't believe they're of gods I said I don't believe these are evil spirits these are wrong spirits and let's let's begin looking here so see the Holy Ghost wind I want to read this quote here I got a few quotes I want to share with you now how many member broken cisterns brother Ram told a story in this this sermon I'm gonna read a portion of it and brother Boehner had wondered about the evidence of the Holy Ghost for years but in this sermon he tells the angel of the Lord told him what the evidence was the first time he'd ever heard it from an angel because he was telling brotherly Vail he was saying was it speaking in tongues no can't see that he said neither do I said brother Vail though I've been taught that what would you think it would be I said well the most perfect evidence I can think of his love and so we got to talking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held that and said if a man has got love but one day the Lord and the vision straightened me out and he said that the evidence of the Spirit was those who could receive the word now you've got to balance this next part out neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word now how many know what I'm gonna say now I hope you know what I'm gonna say god is love so what what brother was referring to was just people that act real loving but don't don't misunderstand the evidence of Holy Ghost is love because God is love because you know in other quotes he talks about how Christians science seemed more loving than other people right but see God the angel of the Lord here is trying to show them that the Lord was trying to show them it's those who keep the word right he said that's the evidence receiving the word brother Vail said that's scriptural because in john 14 jesus said when the Holy Ghost is coming to you he will reveal these things you that I've taught you and will show you things to come let's read now let's go to John 14 that is very scriptural verse 26 we read 14:26 and 16:13 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things now you got apply that right all things for your age right so that's what it means it means all things for your age cuz you and I are never gonna know the day or the hour of Christ's coming although we'd like to we'd love to get a sneak peek just give me the week lower number man said you might know know the week - because he didn't Jesus and say you can't know the week but in other words we want to be ready because we love Christ but it's all the word he said all truth teach you all things for your age that's what it means and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I've sent unto you so whenever you need to remember during your lifetime we just got to pray and say God help me remember it has promised you the Holy Ghost will help you remember it so we don't to go into any meeting or any any uh that's gonna fall there sorry about that we have to go into any meeting or any phone call or conversation or church service you know or fellowship we have to go into any fellowship or anything at all and be worried because if we're born again we can quote the promise and say Jesus bring everything to my remember it's amen and I'll just have a quick story last year a brother the message he didn't never eat he didn't go to our church he's never gone to our church he called me up and left me a voicemail and said I need to meet you at certain certain place I got to talk to him like here we go again I hate those kind of voicemails like tell me what you want to talk about so I least I can prepare like to leave all that vagueness aside to pray and say God help me out to be nervous but I walked into that meeting I fasted and prayed that morning it's on a Saturday morning and I just said Lord bring all things to my remembrance I'm trusting you Holy Spirit well he started off he did all the talking for like the first half hour tell me I was wrong to do a YouTube ministry and my church is wrong to have YouTube or services on YouTube and just bawl me out he was crying but it was misguided the reason he was crying because there was so much evil on YouTube well that doesn't make everything on YouTube evil as I said there sister Brenda I just sat there taking it and I got more courage as I sat Dericks I'm like oh holla it's coming it felt like a river of water coming up I'm just waiting for my turn mercy but and then after that after about that four additional half-hour that it started flowing and by the end and nothing more to say and by the end he was crying for the testimonies I was sharing about the YouTube testimonies about a woman fasting for three days God is makeup right and that she said there you are on YouTube she said I'll never wear makeup again see I just got it we just got to trust the word amen if Jesus said he's gonna bring all things to remembrance then he'll bring all things to your remembrance amen everything that you need that now that doesn't mean he will he'll make you win every time you feel like you win in every every conversation but on the on the moments where you need to feel victorious he will be with you it doesn't mean you're gonna win every argument or win every discussion but it's gonna mean like if you ask him and invite him to come he's gonna come and help you so that was broken cisterns now one when Joyce and her husband West were here a few Wednesday's ago I read these at the end I want to reread them from the church age book here's now this is nine things brother Graham says about who has the Holy Ghost first one who's taught the word by the ghost second the group that can and does hear what the Spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof third hearing what the Spirit says is the evidence forth that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth heard the word received it and live by it see that's the thing that's the trouble with us that's other words that's the battle Satan is battling us with we go to church so faithfully but we got to live what we hear we got to live by it praise God and that's all that's my battle that's your battle all of our battles but see we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus abide in the vine and you'll bear much fruit praise God stay in the word on Monday morning on Monday night stay in the word stay in the word abiding the word and you'll bring forth much fruit hallelujah fifth in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it six for the believer to receive the word for their age in which he lives seventh if you are true seed you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will steam his word above your necessary meat so you're gonna have to fast sometimes and I've been I've been to churches in one in Arkansas I've been to message churches where they don't believe in fasting anymore because they say since the cloud came Christ is here we don't need a fast anymore that's just an excuse for gluttony I keep going to gluttony is that right really huh that's it and that and the many people in the church are gluttonous I've been around them and they don't want to fast but brother man says when you got the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said the word it's more important than your food amen glory and yearned to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God my brother have said we read a few weeks ago he said one of the greatest evidences I know is something that just wants to do something for Jesus amen there they got soul travail they just want to do something so badly number eight he said the evidence is just the same as it was back in the day of our Lord it's receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew and if the people got the word the works would follow that is the Bible so see the most important thing is believing and accepting the revelations and then if you believe and accept the truth of God you will start working by the grace of God and you will do the right works a lot of people just come to the message they jump right and they just try to do the works they just try to dress holy they just try to cut out anything that's that's bad and they don't actually understand why they're doing it we but see those of us run right with the revelation we know why we're doing it because the word is the absolute and whatever God says it's the best thing for us because God's never gonna lead us into confusion or lead us into an evil life of sin he's gonna lead us into holiness and we know God's choice is the best choice because he's a faithful father hallelujah so we got the revelation but see people just fall in love with brother Branham and make him the absolute rather than making Jesus the absolute oh yeah that's right so get the revelation first then go to working then you have the right works but get the word first and number nine a person that's truly baptized with the Holy Ghost in the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the Spirit will be in the word all the way see they'll never get tired of the preaching of the word because that's what they're feeding on amen they're in the fullness of the word amen now go to John 16:13 so yeah you can you if you ever need scriptures on what is evans to the holy ghost ever to anyone anyone ever asks you use these two in fact there on my video I made a video on YouTube called the evidence of the Holy Ghost according to Jesus cause that's what brother BAM says and it's broken cisterns he says let's look at the evidence according to Jesus we already say that I might not be able to find it but that's what he says he said let's see what it is according to Jesus I don't know if I can find it right now well I would have liked to find it but I didn't find it ok John 16:13 use those two scriptures if anyone ever asks you what's the evidence it's being guided into all truth and it's learning all truth from the word howbeit when he the Holy Spirit I'm sorry when the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come praise God so see it all truth your guide into all truth and the true jesus said thy Word is truth and then he should teach you all things so see you have a teachable spirit you can be taught new things in the word that maybe you're not living yet you don't come to church trying to teach the preachers although you could share something afterwards that would bless my heart that's happened many times to me but that's not your main focus your main focus is to be taught by the Lord the word see and then you're guided into all truth now I want to read a church age book quote and I got to find it like I said I'd have enough time there's so much copying and pasting to show you the great quotes I just want to remind you of some of these here the first one is brother bran told us to not change a thing and that's Galatians 1 so why you turn to Galatians 1 we might as well read that just to lay a little bit of a foundation and all my foundation is kind of slow but bear with me okay yeah Galatians 1 verse 6 Galatians 1:6 I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached in you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be cursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men Paul was not a man pleaser he was such a God pleaser that all the men rejected him at the end of his ministry just like brother Branham for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received an aura of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now in a church age book quote brother Branham says on paragraph or page 84 that Paul was confronting false teachers and he said but early apostles looked them in the eye and said you were not saying what Paul said you were therefore false he said o Rome and said oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word he says it is not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and the teacher it's the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the Laotian church age and you will know if he's the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he's of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota amen and that's the authority of Galatians 1 for all message Churches brother Branham cannot bring anything different than what Paul brought he has to bring the same revelation and more of the same because we know Paul didn't know about the seven seals but that none of those revelations go against anything Paul preached but we have many today saying they have revelation from brother Branham or even Jesus as I'll showed you a little bit they say they got revelation from Jesus that has now changed it's no longer preachers it's just tape players that's the wrong revelation because Paul never said read my epistle only he told Timothy preach Amen he said preach the Word of God amen preach it Timothy amen be instant in season out of season four there'll be many it teachers with itching ears and they won't be able to handle sound doctrine because they don't live the doctor and they don't love the word they don't love Jesus Christ they might love him a little bit but they love their selfishness more than that they love worldliness and pleasures more than that but this is how you know the the reason brother Brandon is the seven church age messenger he taught the word exactly the way Paul did and the attack now is on the pastors and the fivefold ministry why because you most often feed from the pastors and Satan's trying to try to trap their stop your main method of feeding praise God it's kind of missing the natural is kind of like if Satan would try to stop you from going to the grocery store well pretty soon you'd only eat fast food and get real unhealthy that right church and then after that he'll shut off the fast food well then pretty soon you'll be digging out of garbage cans that's what Satan try new now he's not he's going after he's going after the the grocery stores he's trying to stop you and I from feeding the way God said we should feed and it's the only way God said we should feed because he says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God and the Word of God is preached by the spirit and the bride amen the fivefold ministry Paul started it Paul ordained the fivefold ministry and it never changed it's never it's never going to change because we keep it until we come in the fullness of the stature of Christ so we all come in a unity of the faith praise God now I don't have the time I actually didn't look look this one up but there's a great quote I think it's in questions and answers on the seals or I think it's yeah it's the beginning of that sermon brother Ram says no he tells the people and the RAM says well he said he said don't try to make anything of the seventh seal he said don't put your interpretation of it he said don't make yourself odd to be a Christian he said just live the same simple humble Christian life telling everybody how much you love Jesus that's what I love about you know this invitation I got last Friday to preach at a fc amen all those people know is that I love Jesus I never went and and and called them dog missus dog meat or anything like that I never shoved the word in their face like that if they would have if they're caught of God they'll see such a difference in my life that they'll want to hear the word of God but I'll to beat anybody up I have to argue or fuss with anybody what people want to see now is love amen and I know love is corrective sometimes it is but the attitude of going out and argue in a name-calling and things like that that's not what the world wants to see they want to see genuine love not someone who's odd but someone who is a real Christian amen they just want to see someone who's got a reality in their life and it really got the love of God anybody can hate my hate is everywhere hates and politics hate sin the riots overseas you know hate sin the wars between nations hate is everywhere but love is so rare it ought to be in our church amen people ought to see the love the love of Jesus Christ in our lives now arla our wind is the Holy Ghost wind like brother Evan tells that story Watson Lake Erie and he saw the wind blow up and it moved all the trash to the shores that's when we know Oh glory that's what we know love is coming to rinsable in this church ha ha hey men when people come to church and God has done blowing all the trash out their lives throughout the week oh now we know God stirred up and it might look small to the world but it's great in the sight of God because God's wind is blowing through the church amen hallelujah and it means a clean now lake praise God I clean that life amen because the winds of God have driven all the trash away but see sinners we reap the whirlwind they will reap the whirlwind now Church there's a lot of things I don't know a lot of details but I see I'll say like this of the few churches I know that preach false doctrine evil things follow them like adultery like money scandals like suicide you know and don't take that personal I know suicide can hit anybody but when false doctrine is allowed to happen spirits can run free and they they take a stronghold in the people's lives because see the word will set everyone free because he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and the love of God uproots all roots of bitterness praise God because he's there but when the Holy Spirit is choked out or he's hindered he's limited then people are allowed by the evil spirits to stay in those conditions and the prisoners are not sent free we ought to rejoice if the word that we've heard it's keeping us free in Christ amen how do I know you amen even little services like this every Wednesday night my Wednesday was such a great time at Lord every time that we gather it's great because we're just getting sent free from demon powers amen temptation and any shackles we can break free anytime that's why the Word of God is here and that's why we have the real Holy Spirit praise God to guide us in the truth of God's Word not just Church joining in religion but really being free from all false doctrines in all sins that's what the real preaching of the word does amen and just like in the waters of separation you can only get clean by a man who's clean thank God God has kept my life clean amen right you can't go to a dirty priest and get clean you got to go to a clean priest and say I try to keep my life pure before the Lord and confess everything praise so that you can experience the same hallelujah now I already mentioned this but here's some of the spirits that are I believe are behind these false doctrines I'm about to show the spirit of idolatry now that's probably a part of with pride because an idol is something that you exalt more than God so you created your selfishness and your pride has created your own God and they do it with brother Branham the very one that we thank God for the Seven that's the one they I idolize and so they love exalting William Branham more than Jesus Christ for their own gain I don't know why brother way but we're gonna find out one of these days we're gonna find out why do they love exalting a man making every word he said thus saith the Lord instead of Christ because there's must be some sin that they get to enjoy on the side and let me say this I listen I subscribe to some people from Jeffersonville Tabernacle just so I can find their false doctrine because I have to have to watch out for the souls of the saints so here's what they say and I've told them to when you were when you brothers there here's how they can justify saying every word brother Ram said as I say the Lord I said well what about Abraham memmer I said that what about Abraham lying was that let's say at the Lord they said yeah because it's in the Bible and the Bible is I say at the Lord well no you just Church twisted that the Bible's thus saith the Lord in that every account of every event is true but the fact that Abraham lied doesn't give you as I say at the Lord to lie see how thick that is see how deceptive Satan is the Bible just records everything true the facts are true and those facts are thus saith the Lord its thus saith the Lord Abraham line but that doesn't give anyone the license to lie and say it's okay that's why they can say yeah bream lied to the IRS it's thought it was thus saith the Lord though no it was the permissive will of God and the church said and when you lie or I lie it's the permissive will of God amen God's not pleased with that it's not about say it's the Lord so see how twisted up they are they don't even have see the thing is they're not born again because if they're born again it would guide them out of that foolishness out of that nonsense and it would guide them into the truth amen that's the reason they're there like that that's the reason they can say things like that can you imagine saying a man born in sin who lied or anything every word he says is infallible that's Pope stuff that's Roman Catholic stuff that's Antichrist stuff no matter what you say after you cannot mix one or the other there's only one who spoke everything thus saith the Lord that's our Lord Jesus Christ something behind that statement or something demon power behind that that loves worshipping brother Branham more than Christ maybe maybe they're maybe they're in competition maybe it's a demon of competition I've we've seen that in our church years ago it's no longer here at least have a demon of competition amongst certain people so every time God would bless somebody in a certain area the other person would get mad and upset and how do I know because the person admitted to me that's how I know they told me they told other people to a demon of competition oh you know brother Jesse's children to this so they got all mad my children need to do this and in church we're not doing anything and our children don't sing song specials our children don't memorize the Bible for any competition we do it because it's training to get them to love the Lord but some people take that and say man I'd have to do better than that they're just trying to show off or something like that demons and they admit it to us Missy Church what are we all human we all need the grace of Christ and listen grace is available if we'll humble ourselves but that's the thing Satan won't do he won't humble himself because he's so full of pride and when the people today refuse to repent refuse to say their song it shows them about the demon power Satan on him because that any man have got any woman of God will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God's Word amen then God will exalt them in due season that's what Bram did he lied yeah but he also humbled himself and went back and told the IRS agent he lied see that lying spirit of the devil he's the father of lies see how good his lies are it's not better than the truth though it's not as good as the truth he's got some good lives but it ain't as good as the truth praise God hallelujah sees that idolatry they worship they love brother Brandon getting more credit than the preachers which he should he does he should have he should have just as much honor as John the Baptist had but John the Baptist did have more honor than Christ and that's where they get mad they want brother Ram to have all the honor and greed greed with tithes and offerings find any reason they don't have to come to church and pay ties greed we'll get to that one a little bit and then rebellion they don't want to sit under man they don't have to listen to a man and then they accuse the men of having a denominational spirit when the men are just trying to lead by the word because God wants somebody to lead right we'll get to that in just little bit now let's go through a few these things windsor i'm way behind now now there's two kinds of wins now the word win means to be carried or agitated and notice only immature christians get blown by these so you don't encourage your church not to be prideful it encourage you when winds blow through churches and you stand there like the rock of ages' because you're standing on the rock of ages' amen the first time i heard some of these things i knew they were wrong right away why cuz i'm anchored in Christ amen I've got to get the discernment amen you have discernment in your life too if you've got the word in you amen I've got different measures of discernment but everybody the words inside of you if the Holy Ghost inside of you the words inside of you you've got discernment to know right and wrong and it means driven to different opinions we watch different ones over the years go from this opinion to that opinion totally flip-flop some it just takes a matter of a year they can be totally there they can be screaming shouting amen on this idea that the doctor not one year the next year they hate it I've never seen that happen in my Christian life never the only the major the only major doctrine I've ever seen changement William is that doctrine well I wouldn't say it's major but the doctrine about Judas did he have real faith or not four years I believe I just took those quotes from see the discrepancy but Ram said Judas never had no faith to begin with in the first place but then I found the scripture says in Hebrews 10 the scripture says that they they crucified again afresh the Son of God who they were already sanctified by so to me that's the only major dot or the only doctrine significant doctrine I've ever had to change in my Christian experience but it wasn't like one year I was all for the fivefold ministry the next year I'm against it or one year I'm all for paying for ties but afterwards no give your ties to Jeffersonville or give your ties to a widow woman nonsense you see see a real sister Kari knows that's true and Brenda you've been around long enough sister Beatrice you know by the way and you know Jose you know real solid saints of God when God's revealed the truth of them they stand on an amen they're not wavering and shaking and wondering what's going on they see the Word of God it's revealed to them the covers torn off it's unveiled the truth is there and they know the truth they study the truth if you give somebody a counterfeit dollar that knows the real dollar you're not going to see them we're not going to take a counterfeit message we're not going to take a counterfeit lie we're taking the truth of God's Word Amen hallelujah you know why Greg because we started the word long enough we know what the word says I served that sculpture long enough I know that masterpiece sculpture I said I long enough I know it looks like I little yeah praise God there's only two kinds and I want to see my life moved by the holy wind where my opinions like my man says my opinions only change to be more holy that's what he says he's the only change you see is more holiness glory see decieved are not born again false doctrine shows you're not born again let's read that first corinthians 6:10 in galatians 5 it's actually scriptural oh yeah and then the one we read a few weeks ago in 2nd John the Bible said if they don't abide in the doctrine of Christ they don't have Christ so there's three right there I only did two but you know there's a third one to 1st Corinthians 6:10 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God now revilers one that says evil things about Christians and so that's kind of connected like whenever you see person who's got the false doctor and they start reviling or speaking evil against real believers they do they revile them now Galatians 5:19 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adulteries so the thing about this false doctrine is on the same level as adultery because it's a spiritual fornication that's right that's right I mean making love to demon powers right adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft now there's idolatry there's for all those brand worshippers witchcraft hatred and they hate the truth variance emulations wrath strife seditions and heresies I'll give me just a minute let me look this up here I didn't get a chance I wanted to find that scripture about seditions I want to give you the Greek definitions bear with me Carrodus yeah Curtis okay so sedition is a division so never someone tries to make divisions or well this if you believe what I believe you're more spiritual right or like they'll call you you're you don't have enough revelation that's what they said they'll say you're carnal because you don't leave there fresh revelation nonsense that's the sedition a disunion a division heresy no I believe I'm starting to believe now my some of these things about program is heresy what they're saying making him every word he says thus saith the Lord I mean come on what's the heresy it is a disunion it is a a sect so a division it's a more secure division of false teaching so they separate themselves and they go to heresies right and then the Bible says in verse 21 and suchlike and of which I tell you before as I've sold you in the past that they which do these things shall not inherit the baptism of the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God see people that hold false doctrines like this it's great proof they're not born again how can you be like I showed you last year how could a Holy Ghost Saint Holy Ghost filled Saint call call names call people who don't play tapes cost names how could you do that so you'd have to have a angry spirit against them so I showed you the call last year it was actually September 2018 because I wouldn't listen to the sermon when I showed you all those the things wrong coming out of Jeffersonville where they call us they call us what's the name of that who's the one that left Paul again why'd I always forget this man's name Dimas they cause Dimas is because one of their members says if you don't play the tapes in the church you're a make believer Adiemus and he says Dimas and I got the video I listen I can show it to you I can I I'll let you download it we're a Dimas Church coming out we're in their name calling us just because we don't believe in playing tapes as the main ministry I believe in playing tapes all week long but Sunday I want to hear from a man that's anointed of the same spirit that was in brother Branham amen because Mel Abraham is no longer in the land of living his ministry is no longer living we can listen to it on tape but his ministry is over Moses is gone raise them up at Joshua Amen now we know the Joshua is the Holy Ghost because that's the very ancestors but it's in the fivefold ministry praise God as far as preaching the Word of God so but we're called D mice's because that now see the elect now but let's balance that out because you can grow in understanding remember brother Branham called Jesus the third person the Trinity three months before the church ages but see that brother William then we started when he started selling down brother Jose with the books God showed him it was wrong hey man we started studying down to teach the Word of God God showed him it was wrong he never said it after that because he felt worn by the Holy Spirit I'd better warn the people seeing that the Catholic Church is coming in under JFK I better warn the people I feel pressed to the Holy Spirit so when he sat down to settle it and studied out what the Holy Spirit show him he showed that Jesus Christ they'll Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and that's all the revelation chapter one is all about the supreme deity of Christ amen not a second or third but the person amen the visible manifestation of the one person of God but all the way up to three months before he was saying third person attorney let the third personal attorney the Holy Spirit come into our services he wasn't deceived he just wasn't time for the revelation because the Bible said the elect can't be deceived praise God Oh cuz God knows we're gonna receive it eventually because the elect will that's right yes sir time and season now let's review these past wins real quick just a minute I just wanna do a minute on it I promise well understand I promise I'll try I don't want to promise things I can't keep you know getting the spirit of that and then spirit of a thought and I'm the Holy Spirit might want me to finish it so that was Ephesian sermon that was Ephesians series yeah so I did four winds that were blowing out of there I already went over to one they said every word was thus saith the Lord yeah and their reasoning behind that will all the Bible's thus saith the Lord I mean yeah it is but it's not with the way you're saying that what is thus saith the Lord the second thing they type Joseph are the Old Testament as the prophets son which brother Graham never did that and that and then and then they say and then they said in that letter here I stand they said why should the bride be starving and Joseph's wife was never starving Asuna tha's never starving Amen you and I are never starving as long as we're facing on the Lord Amen that evil spirit is making the bride the starving Egypt I'm sorry I'm not a sinner I'm not I used to be about not anymore I'm the life of Christ amen I got food on the table every time I come to the table praise God see that's their to that's to the lies the third is what house will you bill me that they when program preached that right before Perry green preached it as an ordination they take a court out of context and they say that brother Branham was supposed to be back in every pulpit but we showed how that's see they added their own interpretation brother BAM never said that well the bram said him up to make some announcements not to take brother Green's pulpit see this is another scene that they used to say all we only say with the tape saying now they're injecting their own thoughts like a spear while he's doing a spirit won't be content with a little bit of sin he wants to eat up more of their life right he wants to consume more and if they don't stop it it will it has growing power like leaven praise God and it's growing power like like gangrene like hankering if they don't stop the lies they'll grow and greater and the greater lies and the fourth thing was tape boys are the true fivefold ministry that kind of goes along with some things I'll share today and they used the sermon the token where brother BAM says the spies that got into Jericho we're tape boys well but I'm just using that as an example but if scripturally if if Rahab came out she had to go to the priest if she wonder worship amen she started to follow the waters of separation you couldn't separate Rahab from the Aaronic ministry praise God so it is today you can't separate the Gentile bride from the fivefold ministry hallelujah okay now let's go today recent wins I have a tape I can show you where the Jeffersonville people call themselves the lion's den can you imagine that about fell over and I heard that they say welcome to the lion's den and their reasoning is a most 3/7 when a lion roars it's like a prophet the word Lord comes the Prophet but that's the wrong type Church Daniel wasn't Daniel was the prophet amongst lions amen and that's what's happened amen brother Brad was a bunch of money my man's message is to around a bunch of lions amen and they ain't prophets that's not the kind of line I'm talking about how to know about the other kind of lion the liars praise God glory that just came to me I didn't know I didn't plan that one I'm not trying to be smart out but that's the reality that's the wrong time Daniel was the prophet in the midst of the hungry lions and God silenced the Lions for the prophet's sake and they come out right there and say welcome to the lines then because the lion's roar damos 3/7 you got the wrong type that's what we see year after year wrong miss out book they don't apply the word right they miss apply the word and in that they say it's the tapes or nothing so in other words we are either gonna play tapes or we won't listen to any man there's the rebellion spirit let's see here's the balance church but for us it's not preaching or nothing because they ask brother Branham we have no preachers to go - can we play tapes and brother BAM said yeah yeah if you have no other church to go to then play a tape if you're out traveling and you your plans get mixed up and you don't have a church you better play a tape go do something but don't forget the other Cobra man said if I knew there's a church in the city that only had one slice of bread he said if the only thing they taught was Jesus was divine I'd go to that church because I want to show God which side I'm on amen so see we don't take the arrogant attitude well I'm preaching only know there there may be times there may be scenes of life where there's no pastor there and God's trying to race up on those little boys to be a real man of God he had a pastor yet but God's trying to raise them up to be a real preacher so see you gotta balance these things out your sin see that's what they don't do they don't bounce it out they don't pray long enough they don't get the wisdom of God they just find a quote and spew out whatever they want to satisfy they're less behind the scenes now I about fell over and I heard this one too and I just found this one this year well these are both this year by the way go to revelation 22:16 well I think I got it up here I'm sorry yeah you can look up here right but it's kind of hard to see I should have used black I'm sorry about the light brown so there's a video where prophets family says Jesus teaches tape churches in revelation 22:16 and you ought to hear the people shout or scream they're like that's the same thing same thing in the seven thunders that's that that false movement when those preachers would say certain words the people go out and then and then we had friends that came out of that and said we didn't know what we were screaming about we just want to act like everybody else and try to get anointed and the people are screaming about things they're crowing about things they don't even understand right and I said this last year I still mean it I know there's lot of people in that church system any that been hurt by preachers I know that but that doesn't doesn't give us any right not to forgive them preachers or go back and what really should be done they should go back and have a meeting face-to-face and make that right but instead you can hear the pain and their screams you can hear it listen to it sometime you can hear the pain they'll just scream and on all this tape stuff tapes huh no no preachers no preachers no preachers cuz they've been hurt and doesn't even sound right but it takes and as the vindication that my wife talked to another preacher's wife and she said the same thing and we never even talked about it so both of us that but have the Holy Ghost we both can hear those spirits crying out so it's not just one witness just two and if you listen to it you'll be the third fourth so they read this quote I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify of these things in the churches this is the last chapter of the Bible I'm the root and offspring of David so they say this angels brother branham and then the church is our local churches and guess what they use they use the Scofield Bible because if you go to revelation 22:16 look at the footnote see the same Bible they print in there they're so proud out there quotes which that's fine I mean I'm not doubting that but I'm just saying revelation 22:16 it's on F yeah there F reference is local and so the family members read that and the people shout the exact quote is Jesus himself said play tapes in your local churches and the people just receive it like screaming and shouting and they don't even realize Saints that if that's true then Jesus just undid what he did through Paul because Paul said teach preachers trained them up that they might teach others also amen he said ordained preachers in every city that they might preach the word amen so then Jesus contradicts himself tells Paul one thing and then Jesus comes around to know I'll change it because now Paul is dead and they can't much that they don't enough spiritual discernment to catch that that now it's actually a curse to change anything Paul said it's now a curse and the people receive that curse and they say glory to God can you believe that it's shocking it's shocking to see what people will swallow all because they don't want to believe the truth go to first Corinthians 3 real quick I read this on Wednesday night but I said I'm gonna hold off till Wednesday I know if you remember this turn habit now he's talking about how the corinthians were carnal because they favored preachers now let's not be guilty of that 1st corinthians 3 for for while one saith I am of Paul and another I'm Apollo see I'm a brother Jessie's Church I'm a brother Sam miss church I'm a brother Brooks's Church he said aren't you all carnal let me let me bragging I'll tell you my pastor is let me oh come on mom we're all just sinners saved by grace he's aren't you carnal verse 5 then who that is Paul and who is Apollo's but ministers by whom he believed and here it is right here as even as the Lord gave to every man God gave every man a minister to preach you the word that you might believe they met and they said I'll blessed are the feet of them who bring the tidings of truth amen hallelujah who bring great news that's what God thinks of preachers but this movement wants you to think the opposite of them don't get me wrong someone shouldn't be preaching some of them our slight are doing slight at the pulpit they're playing around with the word trying to just get the people excited praise God I know this it's not my job to get you excited if the word doesn't make you excited nothing will praise God amen and if the word don't make me excited nothing will the word has to lift us up the word has to encourage us the word has to strengthen us but we've got to receive it amen that's the exact quote I listened to this morning my wife heard it too Jesus himself said play tapes in your local church well that totally does undo everything Jesus already told Paul so if you're gonna believe who's gonna be Jeffersonville or Paul I'm gonna side with Paul every time the second one I'm sorry though there's a link it was May 12th this year if you want the link I got it now for times sake let me do two doctrines that pass through our church and I'm gonna cut off the live stream and share a few things personally do with just our church here so there's two main false teachings that have been spread amongst the brothers I believe now if sisters if a spread to you let me know the first one is there's no Merton there's no mercy for the church ages and there's time no longer now here is the Miss applied quote now look look where it's in its before it's actually a couple days before the seals were loosed but see that the error of this is that these people will say we'll see it's in the seals it's got to be thus saith the Lord well actually it's right before the seals were opened if you want to get technical and you ought to now notice this is not revealed until this this book is not revealed until the church ages and denominations has run out and there's time no more to see this group whatever group it is they're taking this quote and saying well if the seals are broke in 1963 church age is 60 well then there's no more mercy anymore and what they say is it's there's only mercy for the elected bride and that's wrong there's mercy for everybody so I replied and I said oh I shouldn't the name up there sorry is this on the light is the screen on the livestream okay okay thank you sorry I didn't mean to put that up there I replied and they said yes there's still mercy just not for the church ages the individual who picks up the anointed word but not the church whole the building speaking of in other words the denominations no there is still mercy and salvation for the foolish virgins than they were to see you 64 after the seals program said they asked me what about now look at this what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't like what you preach they don't have to believe this that's why I just let my friends go my friends I want to leave the message fine I'm still your friend i'm still gonna shine the light of christ to you they don't have to believe the way i prayed you see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved but i'm told no because that one quote will see you gotta keep reading you gotta keep praying ask God for wisdom if they believe the Lord see and if they disagree with this say I don't believe the word I don't know look at this I don't believe in the bat Zilla ghost that shows where their head in the Tribulation Period oh thank God for the baptism of the holy ghost then he says this but those who can accept this word is fullest not me preaching it because because it's the Bible see he never emphasized himself it's always about the word amen it's not about so much brother brand it's not so much about John the Baptist it's about Christ the Messiah amen he's never never pumping up himself we're not to fall in love with Eleazar we're to fall in love with Roberto I'm sorry with with the eyes again the head now we are Rebekah we don't fall in love with ourselves sorry see how the Holy Spirit corrected that those who accept that is what free they're forgiven just accept the word because the words already been judged Catholic can be saved Lutheran methis they can all be saved as long as they judge the word the right way are they gonna have any reward probably not because they turn down truth they ask him again same sermon and this is what this is what people are saying the church age ending and blacked out the bride is called have we already entered the Tribulation Period some people believe that no no I wish I could just have more time when I see the bride when she's taking for the church then the church age will cease now here's where people get this they get so off on this scripture they get off on this right here because revelation 10 7 we all know that but a man's ministry time is no more after the rapture and many interpret that many falsely interpret this and say see after the seals there was no time no more longer there's no more mercy for anybody nonsense nonsense look what he says now I'm sorry I put that one up again next one don't you believe that Jesus might come 100 years yet I don't know when he's coming no man knows when it's coming but I'm gonna try to keep on preaching and doing everything I can till he comes if he isn't here today I'll be looking for him tomorrow it isn't here this week I'll be looking for him next week if he isn't here in the next 10 years and I live I'll be looking for him in the next 30 years see I'll still be looking I don't know when he's coming I but I want to live true to his word and true his people and live like a Christian and wait for us coming keep on preaching jail services getting everybody saved you can I don't know when he's coming over to us let's remember this don't change here here's the court I mentioned earlier don't change anything only your ways from sin to righteousness just keep right on that's your job go right on the same all that understand that clearly say Church age book I'm sorry now look he even admits he could have been wrong in the seals he admits it right here he said I could have been wrong about that Sheba's program didn't have time to go back and study he was praying for sick people he didn't have time to go back and look at every single sermon ever preached brother Graham have you made statements recently concerning the church ages the ended Laodicea no I never said it's ended if you did you misunderstood or eyes look how humble that is or I said it wrong yeah and I'll be honest how many I've listened to the breach and thought that there was no more mercy I'll be honest I did the first time I thought because broadband makes it sound like when that lamb in Revelation 5 comes to take the book but a man makes it sound like he left the intercession booth and there's no more intercession but maybe maybe he said it wrong maybe of course he said it wrong because he just tells you he said there is still mercy there is still mercy Oh will you be surprised how many people want to bawl me out for saying that well he said maybe I was wrong and then he tells him straightly no it's not the tribulation we're still in the church ages if this is the last Church ages then the church ages latest yeah it has an end when it ends the church is gone so as long as Dirks is here it hasn't ended see brother haven't admitted he might have said it wrong see any true true Christian can home of themselves and say that I might have said it wrong Church ages and at the rapture and that's where they'll say we'll see the raptures already happen to me the shouts already going I've already got rapturing grace in me oh come on but don't forget the rapture has three parts to it shout voice Trump right the shout is just to get you ready right the voice raised the dead and then the trumpet changes your body see they got all mixed up but Arab says any old hypocrite can do that say I'm Jesus but the life the Lord Jesus body is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty when he comes time is no more when that body returns to the earth amen glory see they misunderstand revelation 10 6 because they're not born again they jump to conclusions in the seals because they don't read on after the seals because they want to try to make themselves look I got some revelation you got nothing amen but you need to get this humility and getting the presence of God and get some real revelation and if you get some real revelation you'll become a servant in your local church that's what you'll become because we saw it last week or cup weeks ago God always met garrisons upon his people brother man said I'm garrison by your prayers so you have a ministry here's the second one I'm almost done here they say brother branham is not the seven church age messenger and here's the quote it's a miss supplied quotes from right after the church ages and now if you'll notice little Willie out there put my name under that star out there and that's the reason I passed it over you see because I now I'm going to be honest as I can be I don't think I have anything to do with that messenger now Church I believe brother Graham just didn't have the revelation yet that's what I believe this is 1961 right the beginning of 1961 he didn't he didn't even know the purpose for his life yet he didn't even know what the third Pole really was yet so see people take this and say look he's honest he's honest as can be he's not the seven churches message well then who is and that's what I don't know what I think is they're trying to make Joseph brand in the third or the seventh ear change messenger that's what I think but I don't know but doesn't matter now once again they don't read above I don't know I'm sorry this is below see he even says below that he might be wrong he said I'm gonna break down here just a minute and tell you something let's jerk that thing off of Willie's done up there and then say it let's say it's right so let's say that Branham named under that seven star is right let's just say it's right I can't say that brethren that's a stuffed shirt so he knew there was pride if brother Aaron put his old name under that seventh star he knew it puff him up and pride he said that's a stuffed shirt even if I believed it I wouldn't say it see somebody else says it that's them now if you read I can't wear can't find where Bodrum ever emphatically declares himself as a seven church age messenger but the clues in the church age book only point to him the next closest person might be his son Joseph but again Joseph never says thus saith the Lord on his on his own because I asked his to closer to his closest friends I said has he ever said thou said Lord they said they've never heard it he's 64 years old if you're a prophet I would think maybe you would say at some point before 64 years maybe God's waiting like Moses maybe that's true I don't know but see we have to watch the fruits of the tree no matter what and the fruits break the Word of God now here's here's the church age book Road Ram said the messenger was already here now in 1965 so the measure of this legacy in age has to be here now so can't be anybody that was not born yet that throws me out throws all these other preachers out right which we never claimed to be but all these guys overseas or that claim to be a messenger nonsense buh-bam says the messenger a prophet will always be accurate and like I said two lifetime friends I've never heard I've never heard Joseph say thou said the Lord cuz my man said this prophet will have accuracy with his thus saith the Lord so Joseph doesn't meet the requirements of the seven church age messenger cannot be a heavenly being he said it's a man he says not a heavenly being it's a man he's not here on the earth now he said it's not Jesus Christ the people in John's day mistook him for the Messiah now I'm gonna skip that the scriptures you know he said they're gonna try to say he's Jesus but don't you believe it he's not Jesus Christ he's not the Son of God so see the seven church a messenger just like the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th they're all men they're all men they're not an angel heavenly being they're not Jesus Christ and they got to say they'll say that the Lord a lot it's got to be accurate that only leaves one person left William Aaron Branham and he's Ardi in the land in 1965 but now according to the time where we stand the latest in age the prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 must already be in the land amen and once more with thus saith the Lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the harvest now here's another quote that was share with me and they say oh this is the ministry of them this is the quote that says there's another messenger to rise they look at it it may be my going home time this is right before he had the vision of the seven angels in 63 it looks very much that way if it is if it's what is going home time there will rise somebody after me that'll take the message on he'll be an odd person and I've seen the Jeffersonville people use this to say it's Joseph Branham I've seen it they got it right online I'll show you to you on the YouTube if you want but he'll rise after this and take the message on and you listen to it as long as it's scripture stay with it oh but they didn't read beforehand the paragraph before tells us what brother man's talking about look at the words before you'll understand he's talking about his vision of the seven angels he said the exception the other day when I come westward you played the tape services then time many of you I guess and you understand I don't know what I'm waiting I'm here now I don't know why I'm just waiting because the visions that go west so the vision that seven angels did not mean is going home time and met a further work the third pole it didn't mean is going home time it meant a further miss work so we do not look for anyone to rise because the seven angels vision wasn't his going home time because he says if it is my going home time somebody else will rise but 1963 wasn't he had two more years to preach the word and he says it plainly in the seventh seal if they just keep listening Amen just keep reading the message they say they believe and he says it he said here's the quote from the seventh seal about the vision meeting of further work the third all jumping the mountain really early before day this little food trail I turned and went to some great jagged rocks oh my I knelt down between the rocks I laid this Bible down it's the Lord God what is this vision means he said what is these 7 angels mean nor does it mean by dying you remember I told you I thought it might mean me to my death I'm skipping down I thought it could mean my death and then in the room what was the Lord what does it mean does it mean I'm going to die if it is all right I won't tell my family just go on if if my works finished and I said now what was it but he sent me a witness back you remember telling me that it wasn't that it was a further of my work hey man that quote is not saying someone else is going to rise because the seventh angel vision wasn't about his death it was about more work for Christ it's exactly right and the sword of the king represented the third Pole something hit my hands and don't fear it's that third Pole it didn't mean his death the seven angels nted it further work so we're not expecting anyone to rise because that's not what I meant now here's another quote they say means that brother Rams not the seven church age messenger anointing ones the endtime I wasn't the one that appeared down the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things it foretells these things that happens as perfectly as they are now this is all true this is all true my man's not making any mistakes here I'm the only one that's near when he does it yeah I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel there it looks like he says he is the seventh angel I don't know about you Church but it looks like God arey says it wasn't me the seventh angel he said oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man in other words the seventh angel was a prophet that's what it means because he had to finish the mystery of God amen it wasn't the angel it was his message it wasn't the ministry that got him folded I'm sorry it was the mystery God unfolded it's not the man it's God the angel was not the son of man si si program was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on hallelujah praise God but see they make they feed on brother Ram see because they take quotes that he says that aren't they're not prophecy and they live on them instead of living on the Word of God see he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man so again they fail to read before the quote look earlier in the quote brother Branham says revelation 10 7 read it when you get home the seventh angels message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now let's say into our feet thank God you can get it separated now a lot of people can't they make brother branham either Jesus or something else they make every word he said thus saith the Lord they can't separate a man from Christ that's where it seems so hard for you you see and he's in jeffersonville he's preaching in jeffersonville it's so hard for them see because they're in the country of the prophets now the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man in other words brother Adam was showing a prophetic ministry it was a gift from Jesus Christ it was Jesus Christ prophetic ministry in a man because it's left the shuk is left the denominations he can't organize it as the grain itself I'm sorry okay cut the livestream god bless live streamers loving the Lord and may God richly bless you let me close here with a few more things
