[1:31] world the love of the father is not in
[1:34] him verse 16 for all that is in the
[1:37] world the lust of the flesh and the lust
[1:40] of the eyes and the pride of life is not

[2:00] hallelujah we can't fight him alone we
[2:02] don't have enough
[2:03] we don't have any power of our own lord
[2:05] god we just have your authority that
[2:07] you've given to us and we're so grateful
[2:09] for that lord god we we just have the
[2:11] keys to the kingdom like you gave to
[2:13] peter and the saints lord god hallelujah

[2:25] us oh god from your word from heaven
[2:27] lord just move me out of the way lord
[2:29] move any of us out of the way and may
[2:30] the holy spirit be the one we focus on
[2:32] god the one we feed on worship
[2:34] hallelujah when we give glory and honor
[2:36] to you lord jesus we come to worship you
[2:38] and love you lord god we need you in
[2:40] this hour lord god hallelujah we need
[2:42] you lord as we see the world getting
[2:43] darker and more wicked and more violent
[2:45] and more hate hateful all the time how
[2:47] do you make us more holy how to do it
[2:49] make us more loving oh god make us more
[2:51] in your image and god help us to
[2:52] overcome
[2:53] every one of our battles for lord it
[2:54] doesn't matter what we have to overcome
[2:56] it only matters that we overcome by the
[2:58] word hallelujah so teach us to overcome
[3:00] every obstacle every trial by the word
[3:03] of god in jesus christ's name the saints
[3:05] say amen amen
[3:06] god bless you as you're being seen
[3:07] praise god
[3:15] i have some quotes here by god's grace
[3:17] some scriptures you'd like to point to
[3:24] so we looked at our texts here we'd like
[3:26] to continue on this
[3:28] thought now i changed the title i've
[3:29] been calling it overcoming pride and
[3:32] that just didn't sound right to me as i
[3:33] thought about it
[3:35] i just want to kind of retire
[3:38] overcoming the sin of pride
[3:40] because we think of overcoming grace and
[3:41] overcome overcoming strength overcoming
[3:43] revelation i said well that doesn't
[3:45] sound right
[3:46] let me change it to overcoming the sin
[3:48] of pride so just a little slight change
[3:50] but same idea
[3:52] um
[3:53] you know we as i was you know preparing
[3:55] i just kind of was led to some of these
[3:56] scriptures i never really thought about
[3:58] it before
[4:00] you know we are we're going to be
[4:02] battled in one of three channels praise
[4:04] god the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[4:06] flesh and the pride of life how many
[4:08] could say amen to that amen we're going
[4:09] to battle every single day of our lives
[4:11] brother we'll get to these quotes later
[4:13] brother brandon says can you avoid
[4:14] temptation he says never
[4:17] never you'll never get to a spot where
[4:20] you can overcome being
[4:21] overcome just being tempted we're going
[4:24] to be constantly tempted every single
[4:25] day praise god sure
[4:28] we're never just going to be able to
[4:30] avoid that yes we can walk in such an
[4:31] anointing you know uh for a little verse
[4:34] where uh like moses where pharaoh
[4:36] doesn't know what to do with moses
[4:38] but now look first look at that now
[4:40] first as soon as he gets out there and
[4:41] gets the red seat what happens he says
[4:43] lord
[4:44] you left us here you called us here to
[4:46] the red sea and the lord says why are
[4:47] you crying to me
[4:50] so see he was he was only just
[4:52] untouchable for so long
[4:54] because eventually that anointing leaves
[4:56] praise god eventually god wants us to
[4:57] remember that we're nothing
[5:00] and he wants us to teach us he wants to
[5:02] teach us rather to rely upon him in
[5:04] every area of our life praise god so yes
[5:07] you can live so close to satan i'm sorry
[5:09] so close to the lord that satan doesn't
[5:11] know what to do with you you can live so
[5:13] close under the anointing of the holy
[5:14] spirit the devil doesn't know what to do
[5:16] for a little portion but then you're
[5:17] going to sit back into that human mind
[5:19] amen
[5:20] slip back in the flesh and the cares of
[5:22] the world or the human thinking and then
[5:24] we got the crowd to god again amen just
[5:26] like moses he cried out and then when he
[5:28] cries out god gives the instruction and
[5:30] the rebuke
[5:31] he rebukes him and says why are you
[5:33] crying speak and go forward praise god
[5:36] see church the holy spirit is not going
[5:37] to be a slack to rebuke us
[5:40] if we know better if we if we know the
[5:43] word of god and we've been trained and
[5:44] taught and we've been experienced
[5:46] servant of god our servants of god as we
[5:48] as we believe even as the bride you know
[5:51] god is gonna
[5:52] sometimes bring a word to bring rebuke
[5:54] to us
[5:56] and that that is only to say lord
[5:57] forgive me and thank you for the word
[5:59] now i'm going forward i know the
[6:01] direction you want me to go praise god
[6:02] amen now church as we look at i'm just
[6:05] going to emphasize this scripture a
[6:06] little more here
[6:08] you and i have to break down our own
[6:10] pride which means humility we have to
[6:13] humble ourselves or god has no other
[6:16] choice but to break us
[6:19] so we're either going to break ourselves
[6:21] or god will break us
[6:24] in church many times you see it when our
[6:25] life is so busy and we don't have time
[6:27] to pray like we ought to
[6:30] and we don't have time to just read the
[6:32] bible like we ought to and talk to the
[6:34] lord like we all do we don't have time
[6:36] to fellowship with the saints like we
[6:37] ought to right now we do it to ourselves
[6:40] sometimes right and so god will have to
[6:43] just make us even more busy and have
[6:45] this breakdown and that and that fail
[6:47] all these things in order so what is it
[6:48] god breaking us
[6:50] to bring us back to humility amen praise
[6:53] god that's in the believer's life now
[6:55] that's the kind of mercy i want praise
[6:57] god amen i want that kind of mercy where
[6:59] it brings me back to humility praise god
[7:02] and back to a more humble walk with the
[7:04] lord but we've got that choice
[7:07] the bible says humble yourselves and as
[7:09] we showed last sunday you've got to
[7:11] choose the garment of humility how many
[7:12] war today's church amen
[7:14] you choose that garment of humility to
[7:16] put that on i come i come to serve
[7:18] people sure i don't come to be served
[7:19] i'm coming to be the servant that's the
[7:21] lord amen that's what we should have put
[7:23] on how can i be a blessing to a brother
[7:25] or sister how can i be a strength to
[7:27] somebody else today
[7:29] i use my voice i use my hands uh i use
[7:32] my my hugs or my fellowship you know i
[7:34] use my words of encouragement lord just
[7:36] use me as i put up this garment usually
[7:38] that i can be a servant to you to bless
[7:40] your people amen oh yes oh my god so see
[7:44] that's what it must be done daily break
[7:45] down your pride
[7:47] now more winning this week i'll get out
[7:48] my next youtube video it's on this
[7:50] question people have asked me if you're
[7:52] if your spouse isn't serving the lord
[7:54] how do you how do you approach your life
[7:56] the first thing about ram says is to
[7:58] seek first the kingdom of god and his
[7:59] righteousness true brother tells a woman
[8:01] who's married to a sinner man
[8:04] if he tells you don't read your bible
[8:06] don't go to church but i said you don't
[8:07] have to submit to that that's right
[8:09] because jesus says you're not worthy of
[8:11] me if you won't love me more than father
[8:13] mother husband brother or sister amen
[8:15] that's right see we don't have to submit
[8:18] to anything someone tells us we're
[8:20] married or not
[8:21] and that tells us to deny the word of
[8:22] god
[8:24] jesus is our true husband amen jesus
[8:27] jesus is our true head praise god
[8:30] so yeah we want to be humble you know
[8:32] and we want to be uh submissive about
[8:33] submitting yourselves unto one another
[8:35] the fear of the lord but we always just
[8:37] remember true humanity is submitting to
[8:40] god above everybody else amen
[8:43] and let me say that includes your boss
[8:44] too
[8:46] and the church said
[8:47] boss tells you to work sunday sorry
[8:50] can't do that
[8:51] are you losing your job well thanks for
[8:52] the time i'll get another job
[8:55] holidays now god gives us grace
[8:58] but see god wants to see submissive
[9:00] heart in every area of our lives praise
[9:03] god amen hallelujah
[9:05] and if not god will slowly break us down
[9:07] or maybe quickly break us down
[9:10] god has different seasons of our lives
[9:12] now the scripture where where god says
[9:14] this is through jeremiah of course
[9:17] uh he gives them a an
[9:19] analogy rather he said for thus saith
[9:22] the lord to the men of judah and
[9:23] jerusalem break up the follow ground
[9:26] and sow not among thorns
[9:29] okay so he's telling them a couple of
[9:30] different things here first your ground
[9:33] has become really hard
[9:35] in other words even if seeds were
[9:36] planted there they wouldn't even bring
[9:38] forth because it's so hard
[9:40] it's got to be broken up it's got to
[9:42] have a place to land it's got to have a
[9:44] place to be buried amen
[9:46] hallelujah
[9:48] and so
[9:49] god tells them to do that
[9:52] god gives them that option first he
[9:54] gives them that option first you need to
[9:56] humble yourself you need to break up the
[9:58] follow ground plowing is hard work
[10:01] i don't plow with tractors i plow with a
[10:03] shovel that's what i play with in my car
[10:05] not about you
[10:06] but i get off the shovel and i plow and
[10:08] try to turn over the ground not a lot
[10:10] lately but
[10:11] in years past i would do that
[10:14] break it up to follow ground amen
[10:16] who else is going to do it i've got to
[10:18] do it
[10:18] who else is going to humble yourself
[10:20] you've got to do it praise god
[10:22] you've got to do the hard work of
[10:24] recognizing lord i've become i've become
[10:26] hard i've been cold here my watch got a
[10:29] little cold here or my uh i've got a
[10:31] little cold here towards that brother or
[10:33] that sister i got a little cold toward
[10:35] church i got a little cold towards so
[10:37] and so you know if we get cold or get
[10:39] hard it's our responsibility to make it
[10:42] soft again amen amen it's our
[10:45] responsibility to go over there and
[10:46] start working on the ground amen
[10:49] hallelujah
[10:50] just like they say just a little talk
[10:52] with jesus breaks up the final ground
[10:54] amen you gotta say like that praise god
[10:57] amen
[10:59] it's a little talk you know it just
[11:00] takes a little bit of a
[11:02] a fellowship a little bit of repentance
[11:04] and it breaks up the hardness of your
[11:06] heart
[11:08] and then he also says don't sow your
[11:10] word seeds among cares of the world amen
[11:13] oh what a lesson about coming to church
[11:15] amen let's not come to church we're not
[11:17] going to receive any word seed unless we
[11:19] forget about all the cares of the world
[11:22] and be encouraged you made the big step
[11:24] to get here praise god because they hate
[11:26] to save me here on the live stream thank
[11:27] god for the live stream but it's not the
[11:29] same as being here amen
[11:31] because when you're in here you're
[11:32] totally shut up praise god now you can
[11:34] do that but i we just know it's harder
[11:36] to do what you're live streaming it's
[11:38] much harder because you've got the
[11:39] fridge
[11:41] you got uh the iced tea whatever you got
[11:43] you know ice water hopefully whatever
[11:46] you got you know
[11:47] you got all these distractions but here
[11:49] there's nothing here
[11:51] god's people god's word god's worship
[11:54] everything's on god you're in a holy
[11:56] place you're in a separated place you're
[11:58] in a place where there's a difference
[11:59] between holy and unholy sacred and not
[12:02] sacred we're in a sacred place and
[12:04] that's where god wants you to plant the
[12:05] word of god in your heart when there's
[12:07] no charism in the world and all you care
[12:09] about is pleasing jesus
[12:13] then he says break up your follow
[12:15] grounds to give them two analogies here
[12:17] one to a gardener
[12:19] or farmer and one to a surgeon or a
[12:22] priest right
[12:23] circumcise yourselves to the lord right
[12:26] take away the foreskins of your heart
[12:29] right you men of judah inhabitants of
[12:31] jerusalem let my fury come forth like or
[12:34] i'm sorry lest my fury rather come forth
[12:36] like fire and burn that nun can quench
[12:39] it because of your evil doing so these
[12:41] are people that are doing evil
[12:44] over and over and over again these are
[12:46] people we'd say backslidden or never
[12:48] safe to begin with right but we can all
[12:50] relate we can all relate to having a
[12:51] hard heart can't we
[12:53] we can all relate to doing evil
[12:54] sometimes amen amen because we all sin
[12:57] every single day
[13:00] and so what god is telling them you need
[13:02] to have a
[13:03] surgery he says a permanent surgery you
[13:04] need to have a permanent such uh
[13:07] separation you've got to make yourself
[13:09] where it's hard you've got to make if
[13:11] you don't feel softness toward god you
[13:13] got to pray until you get the softness
[13:15] back amen
[13:17] my brother man told the married people
[13:18] uh again i'm working on this video so
[13:21] the quotes are kind of fresh on my mind
[13:23] a husband who was married
[13:25] uh to a woman and had a son the husband
[13:28] said brother branham i'm having it i'm
[13:30] finding it hard to claim my family
[13:34] because of all their worldly habits he
[13:35] says
[13:38] and he says he said i love your message
[13:40] it thrills my soul but then when we look
[13:42] at his wife and son it depressed his
[13:44] soul
[13:45] right and the church said never felt
[13:47] that way
[13:48] you love the message you love the word
[13:50] but then you see people's response to it
[13:52] and it really really frustrates you
[13:54] sure
[13:56] sure
[13:57] and he asked me he said how can i do
[13:59] this
[14:01] and brother answer response goes
[14:02] something like this he said you've got
[14:04] to have the sweetness of the holy spirit
[14:06] [Music]
[14:08] he says and if you don't have it pray
[14:11] until you get it
[14:13] amen
[14:14] praying do you get it praise god so how
[14:16] do i get how do i claim a family member
[14:19] you've got to pray until you feel good
[14:21] about it praise god
[14:22] [Music]
[14:24] that's hard work though brother just
[14:25] yeah i know plowing is hard work yes it
[14:28] is surgeries are really serious right
[14:30] circumcisions are very serious right
[14:32] it's very
[14:33] you got to be sincere
[14:35] you got to know that i've if i'm going
[14:37] to change my heart i'm going to change
[14:38] my thinking i'm going to change my mind
[14:41] it's going to be a lot of hard work
[14:43] because in other words it's going to be
[14:44] a lot of soul searching amen
[14:46] we've got to search our hearts search
[14:48] our motives search our objectives praise
[14:50] god that's why i found church sometimes
[14:52] it's helpful to go back and listen to a
[14:53] sermon from a year ago or two years ago
[14:55] or
[14:56] and you might see yourself shouting or
[14:58] clapping and then looking well look what
[15:00] i used to be
[15:01] help me jesus yeah it happens to me all
[15:03] the time i'm i'm guilty as anybody right
[15:06] because we're all human
[15:07] that's what every believer is going to
[15:09] battle they're going to battle pride as
[15:10] life goes on if the devil don't get you
[15:12] in less than the eyes that's the flesh
[15:14] then he's going to try to battle you in
[15:15] pride praise god we saw that last sunday
[15:18] it's not if you're going to be tested
[15:19] with pride it's when you're going to be
[15:21] tested with pride and the older you get
[15:23] the more you got to battle pride amen
[15:26] hallelujah
[15:28] that's exactly right happened to every
[15:30] single man of god down down the line you
[15:32] can look at every single one of their
[15:33] lives every single one of them by the
[15:35] end of their life the main thing that
[15:36] the battle is pride
[15:39] thinking they had figured it out they
[15:41] knew all about it in terms of help god
[15:43] help us never to think we've arrived and
[15:44] we don't have to pray anymore we have to
[15:46] seek god anymore we just know everything
[15:47] about everything oh my that's where a
[15:49] lot of people get church is sad and you
[15:51] can see it many times in their lives as
[15:53] we've been looking at
[15:55] but it's hard work
[15:58] now church here's where i got to just
[16:00] lay this in you know there's a lot of
[16:01] people that say you've got to get
[16:02] baptism of the holy ghost after baptism
[16:04] holy ghost and baptism after baptism i
[16:06] know there's a quote on that but that
[16:08] doesn't line up with the bible
[16:10] the bible said jesus says in acts
[16:12] chapter 1 verse 5 jesus said terry there
[16:15] up in jerusalem until you're baptized
[16:17] with the holy ghost and fire
[16:19] he didn't say until you get your first
[16:21] out of many baptisms he said make sure
[16:24] you go there until you're baptized with
[16:26] the holy ghost and fire amen
[16:29] one baptism remember uh james and john's
[16:32] mother asked jesus uh can my two boys
[16:34] sit on your right left he said can you
[16:36] be baptized with the baptism that i'm
[16:38] baptized with
[16:39] he didn't say can you get one out of a
[16:41] hundred baptisms it was one baptism amen
[16:44] the soul gets baptized one time the soul
[16:47] gets of nature and change one time amen
[16:49] it's one time
[16:51] now
[16:52] because we believe that in line with the
[16:54] bible
[16:55] sometimes church i feel like in churches
[16:56] like ours that believe the truth like
[16:58] that
[16:59] we don't do a good enough job of getting
[17:01] the baptism in the spirit more often
[17:04] it's true in other words we let we get
[17:06] lazy in our minds true
[17:09] see you know so like i said like this at
[17:11] least the churches that say baptism
[17:12] after batsmen at least they know i need
[17:14] a fresh feeling right
[17:16] that's where i've got a poor morse
[17:18] preaching into that yeah
[17:19] in other words you need to transform
[17:21] mind absolutely
[17:23] we need a mind that thinks the same as
[17:25] when we first got saved amen that's
[17:27] right
[17:28] because i think even in our brothers and
[17:30] sisters heirs that believe in baptism
[17:32] after baptism even in their heir i think
[17:34] they're getting blessings because they
[17:35] know i need my mind in other words i
[17:37] need to fill it up praise the lord i'm
[17:40] not filled up on god's word and i want
[17:42] to be filled up i was the same uh joy
[17:44] that i had at the beginning i want the
[17:46] same excitement i had here in other
[17:49] words fill my mind back up transform my
[17:51] mind let my mind be baptized with the
[17:53] holy ghost amen
[17:56] so i just thought that thought came to
[17:57] me yesterday i thought no i better
[17:58] preach that another word church here
[18:01] we got to break up the
[18:03] the fallow thoughts
[18:06] the hard thoughts sure
[18:09] the hard feelings we got to break those
[18:11] up and let god's word be planted there
[18:14] and god's word will produce love and
[18:16] forgiveness uh and hope amen
[18:19] hope for a future praise god amen
[18:22] let me just make sure i'm clearly
[18:24] preached by god's grace
[18:26] you need a baptism after baptism in your
[18:28] mind praise god if you're not born again
[18:31] yeah your soul first needs a baptism
[18:33] praise god yeah don't stop
[18:35] like a pentecostal way well i spoke in
[18:37] tongue once or i jumped once and i
[18:39] shouted once
[18:41] i don't need it again no no no no get it
[18:43] in your soul and then in your mind say
[18:45] god restore my mind i'm getting i'm
[18:48] getting weak but never satan his whole
[18:50] desire is to weaken the nations that's
[18:53] right his whole desires to slowly weaken
[18:55] you
[18:56] so when we see ourselves not serving god
[18:58] with the same amount of zeal with the
[19:00] same amount of fervency we've got to
[19:02] repent we've got to break up our follow
[19:04] thoughts amen we've got to cut away any
[19:06] evil thoughts or any roots of bitterness
[19:13] [Applause]
[19:17] i hope that five-minute segment there
[19:19] was a blessing praise god
[19:21] i could preach your own sermon on that
[19:22] and maybe i will one day by god's grace
[19:24] i just want to say that's the that's the
[19:26] kind of thing we have to be cautious for
[19:28] since we don't believe in soul baptism
[19:30] after soul baptism after soul like some
[19:32] people do
[19:35] we've got to say i need a mind baptism
[19:37] mind baptize my mind peanut my mind
[19:39] restore my mind fill my mind with hope
[19:41] amen
[19:42] fill my mind with faith hallelujah amen
[19:46] so that's what you and i need and if
[19:48] you're not born again you need in the
[19:48] soul praise god
[19:50] so keep pressing on hallelujah
[19:54] now here is where
[19:56] god now leviticus 26 has both blessing
[19:58] and curse it's very similar to
[20:00] deuteronomy 28. he says he tells israel
[20:03] if you will not yet for all this
[20:04] hearkening to me then i will punish you
[20:06] seven times more for your sins
[20:09] to see church but they knew better
[20:11] because they knew better sometimes the
[20:13] chastisement was harder
[20:17] right so people denominations they may
[20:19] not get chasing as hard as you and i
[20:21] would
[20:22] because we know better
[20:24] yeah
[20:24] right that's that's what israel
[20:26] because you know better and you're
[20:28] procured people and i brought you out of
[20:30] egypt and i brought you right here i
[20:31] brought you
[20:32] if you disobey you might get jason seven
[20:35] times harder
[20:37] praise god
[20:38] that's real quiet on that one because
[20:40] you're waiting what's coming next i'm
[20:41] not sure what's going next
[20:42] i'm waiting on the lord too
[20:44] remember paul what paul he needed
[20:46] humility what did god do he sent that
[20:48] buffeting satanic messenger
[20:50] in his flesh yeah did he not that's
[20:52] right
[20:54] to keep him from pride amen it didn't
[20:56] say he fell to pride it just said he had
[20:58] to be kept from pride amen
[21:00] so be humble he'd be humble and he
[21:03] wouldn't exalt himself because of all
[21:04] his revelations
[21:07] see
[21:09] so see church seven times more
[21:12] so in other words there's a the
[21:14] there's accountability that's the word
[21:15] i'm looking for
[21:16] there's responsibility brother says if
[21:19] you if you put a log in the water it'll
[21:21] rot out twice as fast right
[21:24] and he compares that if you put a
[21:25] christian uh in the word of god if you
[21:27] put a christian word with god and
[21:28] they're not growing and they're not
[21:30] feeding on it they'll ride out twice as
[21:31] fast
[21:33] sure right because they're not letting
[21:35] the word of god take effect they should
[21:37] be and they're responsible to do it amen
[21:39] they're supposed to do it praise god
[21:41] sure if they don't do it they're going
[21:43] to get spanked
[21:45] that's right
[21:47] now i just want to maybe i'll do this
[21:52] if i could have
[21:56] just a little bit of liberty here which
[21:58] i always know i got my home church by
[21:59] god's grace appreciate everybody love
[22:01] everybody
[22:03] i just want to bring this up again
[22:05] the bible does say uh we get spiritual
[22:07] spankings uh
[22:09] i just want to bring that up the bible
[22:11] said i know it's hard to receive but
[22:12] whosoever the lord loveth he chastens
[22:15] and scourges now scourges
[22:18] scourge what a scourge means to whip
[22:20] right jesus got scourged on the night of
[22:22] his arrest
[22:23] the church when people say they're
[22:24] getting a spiritual spanking there's a
[22:26] reality to that
[22:27] brother and accuser that left the
[22:29] message say oh oh brother god was the
[22:32] was the was not a loving god and he
[22:34] would take your child if you disobeyed
[22:36] but what does the bible say
[22:38] the bible says god means business
[22:42] he would rebuke israel seven times more
[22:45] because they knew better
[22:47] and the bible said he scourges
[22:50] every son that comes to him
[22:53] so in other words he spanks all of his
[22:55] children right
[22:57] how many have been received by god i
[22:59] mean how many feel like god's received
[23:00] you as a child of god
[23:02] then you're open to be corrected praise
[23:03] god
[23:04] then he's going to make sure he quickly
[23:05] corrects you praise god
[23:08] especially if you're getting into some
[23:09] serious sin
[23:11] whether it's lust of the eyes less of
[23:12] the fresh flesh the pride of life
[23:15] and church it's a good thing he does do
[23:16] it right amen
[23:18] praise god
[23:20] sometimes we get weak and we don't break
[23:22] up the ground of our mind if we don't do
[23:24] that who knows what we could do
[23:26] right who knows what we could do
[23:29] program always almost convinced to leave
[23:31] the field and go live up in the
[23:32] mountains almost convinced
[23:34] almost it but thank god the angel lord
[23:35] was there
[23:37] who's there to protect you amen who
[23:39] camps around you amen because you fear
[23:42] the lord the angel of the lord and thank
[23:44] god he sends his angels as a ministering
[23:46] spirit to help us in the time of need
[23:48] amen amen hallelujah thank god
[23:51] thank you lord
[23:53] so
[23:54] yes you're a special people yes you're
[23:56] the bride yes god loves you yes you're
[23:58] more than a conqueror but
[23:59] if you disobey the heavenly father
[24:02] he may scourge you
[24:05] so god help us
[24:09] verse 19 why
[24:10] well here in this case now because they
[24:12] disobey plainly
[24:14] he says i will break the pride of your
[24:16] power
[24:18] oh see so see because because they
[24:20] wouldn't break their up their own fallow
[24:22] grounds god said fine then i'm going to
[24:24] break you
[24:26] i'd rather break myself praise god right
[24:28] now i'd rather break myself humble
[24:30] myself then have god break me yeah
[24:32] because who knows what could happen yeah
[24:35] you don't even want to think what would
[24:36] happen right
[24:38] if god has got to the spot where i've
[24:40] got to break them down in humility it
[24:42] could be like nebuchadnezzar you could
[24:43] lose your mind that's true some of these
[24:46] bested people that lose their mind what
[24:47] happened
[24:48] this might be it right they know better
[24:50] they've been taught better right they've
[24:51] been preached at all these years and
[24:53] they might have received it for a while
[24:54] but as soon as they turn into night
[24:56] god's got to do something if they're not
[24:57] going to humble themselves god's got to
[24:59] spank his child god's got to bring him
[25:00] back thank god he does he's a loving
[25:02] father amen amen now we'll shout when he
[25:05] blesses us but why don't we shout when
[25:06] we know he's going to discourage us amen
[25:09] and the church said
[25:11] it's the same god it's not a different
[25:13] god it's not a different person it's not
[25:15] the second person or the third person
[25:16] it's the same verse the same person that
[25:18] showers that blessing is the same when
[25:20] they're singing come on over here son
[25:21] and fake us
[25:23] do we still love him yes
[25:26] yes
[25:27] don't fight against him now we're all
[25:29] going to try to get out of the way of
[25:30] that spanking we're all going to try to
[25:31] get out of the way
[25:33] but he's going to spend it all right you
[25:34] won't if you don't humble yourself he's
[25:36] going to humble you
[25:38] amen
[25:39] break the pride of your power have mercy
[25:43] and i'll make your heaven as iron and
[25:45] your earth is brass he said it's going
[25:46] to start affecting
[25:49] uh what you reap and so your strength
[25:51] will be spent in vain it seems like
[25:53] every everything i try to do ends up in
[25:55] vanity
[25:56] i can't get ahead the church said
[25:59] amen for your land shall not yield or
[26:01] increase neither shall the trees of the
[26:03] land yield their fruits i'm not going to
[26:04] read the whole context but you
[26:06] understand that here all you gotta do is
[26:07] go back to deuteronomy 28 we can preach
[26:09] that again i preached this little series
[26:10] on lessons and cursings last year two
[26:11] years ago
[26:12] that's all we got to do
[26:14] it affects everything
[26:16] it affects your food your family your
[26:18] money your income your church affects
[26:20] everything
[26:21] if we won't humble ourselves when the
[26:23] word of god comes then god's got to
[26:25] break us
[26:27] mercy and he's got a scourges
[26:31] that's exactly right
[26:33] remember the amoeba's case i think that
[26:34] brother just said for months for months
[26:36] he laid in bed and the doctor said this
[26:38] is the worst amoebas case we have ever
[26:40] seen
[26:43] and he thought uh
[26:44] he thought uh
[26:46] that he might never go back on the field
[26:48] again and brother bowser tell you just
[26:50] started he said you're just a boy the
[26:52] man was talking like it's the end of his
[26:53] ministry at the end of his life and
[26:55] brother you said you're just the boy
[26:57] you're just getting started
[26:59] see sometimes we think that it's the end
[27:01] we think it's all over and we got to
[27:02] remember not just we got to remember
[27:04] that that god is trying to get us to
[27:06] repent praise god god's trying to get
[27:08] back on the right road he's trying to
[27:09] get our heart in the right kind of
[27:11] condition to receive the word of god
[27:14] amen amen all because he told these
[27:16] preachers i'm going to go preach in a
[27:17] church of 300 rather than 15 000
[27:20] out in the fields remember in south
[27:22] africa right
[27:24] they wanted to preach to 300 people in
[27:26] the room rather than 15 000 at the
[27:28] racetrack that's true my brother went to
[27:30] the 300 yeah rather than the 15 000 yeah
[27:34] we might think that's crazy but you
[27:35] haven't been overseas then if you think
[27:36] that
[27:37] because that person is taking care of
[27:39] you they're driving you around all right
[27:41] they're buying all your food
[27:42] right you just want to treat them good
[27:44] because they're training you good
[27:46] true tell us it was a denominational
[27:47] spirit yeah
[27:49] he catered in that game he catered to
[27:51] the domination spirit because of that
[27:53] for months he laid with one of the worst
[27:55] the worst case of amoebas uh the
[27:57] jeffersonville doctors had ever seen
[28:00] that's a spanking right that's just
[28:01] thinking
[28:04] see church and we're saying that because
[28:06] brother brown was a real man of god
[28:08] so are you a real man and woman of god
[28:11] but a real man and woman of god can get
[28:13] mixed up on pride
[28:16] and god's got to scourge every sign that
[28:18] he receives and if you want if you
[28:19] receive then you've got to accept the
[28:21] discouragement as well praise god you
[28:22] got to accept the good and bad praise
[28:24] god
[28:25] it really is bad because it's our fault
[28:26] ahead that's why yeah hallelujah
[28:33] now you ever wondered about this
[28:34] scripture
[28:34] the context of the scripture jesus was
[28:36] talking about was about the jews
[28:38] rejected the kingdom of god he said but
[28:40] the gentiles will receive it
[28:45] jesus told the parable you know about
[28:46] lending out the kingdom and uh and the
[28:48] jews would reject the kingdom
[28:50] and he said therefore i say to you the
[28:52] kingdom of god shall be taken from you
[28:54] israel and given to a nation bringing
[28:56] forth the fruits thereof
[28:59] now look
[29:00] you ever wonder about this whosoever
[29:02] shall fall on this stone
[29:04] shall be broken
[29:06] true but on whomsoever it shall fall it
[29:09] will grind him to powder
[29:13] so there's something in other words
[29:14] everybody's got to come to this stone
[29:17] and this stone is either going to fall
[29:20] on you
[29:21] or you're going to fall on the stone
[29:25] but if this stone falls on you it just
[29:27] doesn't it just doesn't fall on that up
[29:29] it's going to keep pushing down the
[29:30] pressure is going to get harder and
[29:32] harder and harder and grind you down to
[29:34] where you are only powder there's you
[29:36] can't there's so many pieces the pieces
[29:38] are all broken and he's just totally
[29:40] crushed church people get crushed
[29:42] because they won't obey the word of god
[29:44] their whole life falls apart they call
[29:46] their life a waste of life but it
[29:47] doesn't have to be that way let's be the
[29:50] other side let's not let it fall on us
[29:52] let's go down and lord crush me amen
[29:54] lord break me follow the lord in other
[29:56] words follow jesus feet and ask for his
[29:59] mercy amen amen
[30:00] that's the thing to do praise god follow
[30:02] in prayer follow
[30:04] follow the friends of jesus christ and
[30:06] follow him praise god he'll you'll be
[30:09] broken and you'll have a fresh start and
[30:11] you'll be able to to know that i've
[30:13] forgiven and that and that you've come
[30:15] to him and he's received you praise god
[30:17] bless the lord amen bless his holy name
[30:19] he's either going to grind you down with
[30:21] pressures in life and difficult trials
[30:23] where you you're just you're totally
[30:26] right
[30:27] but god still is dealing with the
[30:28] gentiles and it still could happen
[30:33] we saw it even in uh remember we all saw
[30:35] even the corinthian church remember the
[30:36] man sleeping with his stepmom
[30:39] but paul is basically saying give him up
[30:41] to the devil so that his soul might be
[30:43] saved in other words let the devil grind
[30:45] him and push him down and ruin his life
[30:47] just so that his soul might be saved
[30:50] because he wouldn't fall down and humble
[30:51] himself in the presence of the church
[30:54] is that right
[30:58] aren't you glad you're overcoming the
[30:59] sin of pride
[31:01] hallelujah
[31:03] a perfect example of god breaking a man
[31:07] the prodigal says give me my money i
[31:09] want my inheritance now i wonder how
[31:10] much it was 50 000 for our day 100 000
[31:14] a million you can spend a million
[31:16] dollars really fast especially with
[31:17] inflation these days
[31:19] real fast
[31:20] but the bible said he went on with uh
[31:22] licentious living and all spent all his
[31:24] money
[31:25] and he finds himself in the worst place
[31:28] a jew could find themselves with swine
[31:30] yeah
[31:31] unclean animals the word the most
[31:34] wicked thing that you could ever see was
[31:35] a pig
[31:36] yeah
[31:39] so he finds himself in the
[31:41] he knew i'm a covenant i'm a covenant
[31:43] jew
[31:44] right but i find myself at the lowest
[31:47] spot there's no lower i could be
[31:50] and it was his own doing now we get a
[31:52] beautiful picture here that he had lost
[31:54] his mind and the church said right he
[31:57] had lost his mind he he let demons come
[32:00] in demons of lust and no doubt blessed
[32:01] the flesh in this one lust of the eyes
[32:03] pride life he let all these demons come
[32:05] in and he wasn't even himself it's like
[32:08] when he left his mom and dad was like
[32:09] this is not even the same person that we
[32:11] knew that's not the boy we raised he was
[32:12] a good boy yes he became because of the
[32:15] influence of demons he become a
[32:17] completely different person yeah
[32:20] and so those demons drove him to the
[32:21] harvest the demons drove me up we'd say
[32:23] to the uh the modern day uh car
[32:26] dealership to get the fanciest cars you
[32:28] know it drove him to all these places
[32:30] where normally he wouldn't go but that's
[32:32] because he wasn't himself
[32:34] he was possessed with demons in the mind
[32:39] and god had to let famine come now at
[32:42] first they'd say oh it's not going to
[32:44] rain for a week oh that's no problem i
[32:45] got some extra money
[32:46] well they said it's not going to rain
[32:47] for a month oh
[32:49] no better start counting my pit my
[32:51] pennies here sir
[32:53] it's like it rained for six months
[32:55] oh my goodness
[32:57] i'm going down to my very last few bucks
[32:59] here let's go it's gonna rain they said
[33:01] it's gonna get some rain next week let's
[33:02] go let's go get drunk again let's go get
[33:05] some more harvest
[33:07] and it kept going let's say eight months
[33:08] nine months we don't know how long the
[33:10] famine went
[33:11] but it was slowly god was trying to get
[33:13] him to repent all these times and when
[33:15] he wouldn't do it he finally got to the
[33:16] spot where he's feeding filthy pigs
[33:20] and then their food looks good to
[33:22] him ah
[33:24] think about that the slop think of a
[33:25] slide everyone's seen slots lately
[33:28] i see it all the time in the school the
[33:29] school trash can because they throw all
[33:30] the they threw all the food in there
[33:32] slots yeah the slops look good in other
[33:36] words death looks good or being a beast
[33:38] looks good yo that kind of light looks
[33:40] good and the bible said he finally came
[33:42] to himself praise god when he's in the
[33:44] lowest deepest spot when god is writing
[33:46] him down god's breaking him god's
[33:48] bringing him to realize you're nothing
[33:51] you've made the wrong place and thank
[33:53] god he has the right attitude he said
[33:55] lord i sin i'm going to go to my father
[33:58] i sinned against you and i sinned
[33:59] against my father in other words have
[34:01] mercy on me hallelujah amen
[34:04] have mercy on me i've been prideful
[34:07] i've done it to myself
[34:09] he could blame nobody else and church
[34:11] really this is a gospel story this is
[34:12] all of our story
[34:14] when we first got saved and if you don't
[34:16] feel that way maybe you better check
[34:17] your salvation
[34:19] praise god
[34:22] he says i will go to my father
[34:26] i will go humble myself so these
[34:27] teachers that's what we got to do we got
[34:29] to humble ourselves
[34:31] we have to humble ourselves
[34:33] either you'll do it or god will do it
[34:37] hallelujah
[34:40] there's places church people go
[34:42] there's places spiritually people go
[34:44] they thought they'd never go to
[34:46] that's where that's where we're going to
[34:48] get to with uziah do you think uzziah
[34:49] would ever think he would be covered
[34:51] with leprosy because of his own sin
[34:55] there's places in church sometimes
[34:56] people go if they get if they won't take
[34:58] the correction of the holy spirit they
[35:00] would never ever i'd never do that
[35:03] like that one time my wife warned the
[35:05] sister my wife had a dream that a sister
[35:07] of the message had cut her hair wearing
[35:08] pants
[35:10] my wife went to her humbly and said i
[35:11] had this dream she laughed it off
[35:14] within a couple years she cut her hair
[35:16] in worn pants
[35:18] laughed it off laughed off a warning of
[35:20] the holy spirit
[35:22] see they they never would imagine they'd
[35:23] be and that now this woman has basically
[35:25] lost her mind she's on medication
[35:27] divorced again and all kinds of things
[35:30] all because
[35:32] the person won't humble themselves they
[35:34] won't repent they won't take god's word
[35:37] seriously they won't obey things that
[35:38] they used to love they that sister used
[35:40] to stand right by us and raise the hands
[35:43] and shout and clap when brother brooks
[35:44] would preach your brother greg brother
[35:46] i'm sure she's standing next to you at
[35:47] some point
[35:49] but stand right there what happened
[35:51] disobeying the father cried i know more
[35:54] about it i want to live my life church
[35:56] we don't have a life we don't want to
[35:58] live any life except the life of christ
[36:00] amen
[36:01] the life that he would have us to live
[36:03] that's the life we want to choose amen
[36:05] and submit to that praise god amen
[36:08] hallelujah
[36:12] warning after warning after warning
[36:16] if you don't if you don't fall on this
[36:18] stone this stone is going to crush you
[36:19] down
[36:22] grind you down where it looks like
[36:23] there's nothing left is there anything
[36:25] left is there any hope for this person's
[36:27] life
[36:29] the only hope is for that soul to be
[36:30] saved the bible says in those cases
[36:33] i want to read this again church i
[36:34] shared this with our brother yesterday
[36:36] i think i started in part one
[36:38] now he's talking about uziah we're going
[36:39] to get to uzi again in just a moment but
[36:43] i want to skip down to the blue here
[36:47] uzziah learned a great lesson god orders
[36:49] his man to the place
[36:51] see man cannot order himself god orders
[36:54] his man
[36:55] god makes you what you are
[36:57] yeah
[36:58] so god made me a teacher god made me a
[37:00] preacher
[37:02] now i've got a choice i can understand
[37:03] that or i can try to get out of it and
[37:04] try to run from it my brother man says
[37:06] most times people want to run from their
[37:08] commission
[37:10] right
[37:12] see god orders his man and he mustn't
[37:15] take another man's place
[37:17] and it was a lesson to isaiah that he
[37:19] mustn't put his eyes on human beings for
[37:21] an example
[37:23] but he must put his eyes on god
[37:26] you see god has a certain place for you
[37:28] god has a certain position to you but
[37:30] you've got to be humble with that and
[37:31] you've got to be content with that
[37:34] and satan is going to try to use the sin
[37:36] of pride to try to tempt you to leave
[37:38] your calling in life leave your position
[37:41] in life he's going to try to tempt you
[37:42] to leave that but you've got to turn him
[37:44] down
[37:45] how you know brother jess pray
[37:48] go back to the word does this does this
[37:50] look at the effects if i make this
[37:52] decision it's going to draw me closer to
[37:53] god or it's going to take me any even
[37:55] one step further from god if it takes me
[37:57] one step further from god i'm against
[37:59] that i'm stepping toward the gospel i'm
[38:01] obeying god's will i don't do what god
[38:03] wants me to do
[38:07] i was telling i mean i told this before
[38:08] but for four or five years in a row i
[38:10] was praying god made me a principal i
[38:11] was only looking at a dollar bill signs
[38:13] brother man
[38:15] i don't look at dollar bills
[38:16] and i go into interview i'd pray before
[38:18] the interviews i just thought well god's
[38:19] going to naturally make me a principal
[38:20] all these things
[38:22] and each time i would miserably fail and
[38:24] all the interviews
[38:26] the one time i was looking my fingers
[38:27] too much i was going like this
[38:29] licking papers and guys like you're
[38:30] looking for papers too you're looking
[38:31] your fingers too much
[38:33] i'm just trying to look at my papers
[38:35] it says like little things little things
[38:37] that were just ruined by interviews
[38:41] and then covet hit now this is years
[38:43] later and then i saw the pressure on
[38:46] principles oh yes
[38:48] and they were meeting all summer for
[38:50] hours
[38:51] it was supposed to be their vacation
[38:53] time they're meaning planning for
[38:54] copenhagen church it hasn't really let
[38:56] up too much no
[38:57] no
[38:59] i've received different things from
[39:01] different principles i know i've just
[39:02] heard them talking and they're like i
[39:04] didn't even know if i could ever make it
[39:05] through this school year i didn't know
[39:06] if i could make it through that school
[39:07] year now by god's grace i've never
[39:08] really felt like that
[39:10] but god was showing me
[39:12] i was trying to get out of position
[39:14] and if i would have went in there it
[39:16] probably would have made me crazy
[39:18] i probably would have been so uh
[39:20] overwhelmed with all the even though i
[39:21] had more money in my pocket i would have
[39:23] had less joy in my heart yeah and the
[39:25] church said amen it's not always about
[39:28] more money church god had to teach me
[39:30] that through failure failure
[39:31] disappointment like disappointment
[39:33] praise god
[39:36] but i can see now it's the wisdom of the
[39:38] holy spirit yes thank you jesus
[39:41] it's the wisdom of god yes
[39:43] because what is the most valuable thing
[39:45] god said teach us to number our checks
[39:48] in our checkbook
[39:50] no he didn't say that
[39:51] teach me teach me to number all my debit
[39:54] account transactions
[39:57] teach me to count all my bonus checks is
[39:59] that what god said no god said teach me
[40:01] the number of my day that i might apply
[40:03] my heart to wisdom
[40:05] [Music]
[40:07] wisdom
[40:08] because we only have a certain number of
[40:10] days
[40:11] yeah and we want to fill those days
[40:13] with efforts for the kingdom of god
[40:16] and his righteousness yes
[40:18] but see god
[40:20] is going to make you what you are
[40:22] oh lord jesus have mercy god want you to
[40:25] be a factory worker you'll be the best
[40:26] factory worker you can right
[40:29] stay at home mother
[40:31] whatever you are accountant whatever you
[40:32] are right be the best one that you can
[40:35] be
[40:36] a church god will make if god wants you
[40:38] to go somewhere he'll take you there
[40:40] praise god
[40:41] just like you did joseph now you might
[40:42] have to go to the dungeon first
[40:44] right don't forget that
[40:46] well i want to be somebody great i
[40:47] wanted to do something great well you
[40:48] might have to go the dungeon first do
[40:49] you remember
[40:50] that i'm after beyond the wilderness 40
[40:53] years like moses oh lord
[40:57] merciful jesus
[40:59] see god
[41:01] orders your steps god makes you what you
[41:03] are
[41:04] yeah
[41:06] so we don't put our eyes on any human
[41:08] being we put our eyes on christ jesus
[41:11] lord jesus what do you want from my life
[41:14] open up doors close doors just love your
[41:16] prayers like that lord uh the word is
[41:18] neutral everything about that word all
[41:19] week what was that word i kept thinking
[41:20] what was that word when you don't want
[41:22] to be on either side what is that word
[41:23] it's neutral i need to put it i just
[41:25] need to put on a post-it note right up
[41:26] here don't forget be no
[41:28] not unless you've got god's word or
[41:30] something like that unless you've got
[41:31] like a certain leading of the lord in
[41:32] other words be neutral a christian is
[41:34] humble a christian knows god's ways are
[41:36] way higher than my ways
[41:39] so christian can be neutral i'll just
[41:40] let god do it
[41:43] that's that's what i've learned learn to
[41:44] do i'll just let god do it praise god
[41:47] right we must all learn that we'll just
[41:48] let god do it
[41:50] amen
[41:52] blessed be the name of the lord now
[41:54] that's us brother said that's us who's
[41:55] us we must keep our eyes on god
[41:58] any man is subject to mistakes he's
[42:00] subject to error because he's human he's
[42:02] subject to the violations of god laws
[42:04] and he is subject to many things because
[42:06] satan tempts him and he's just a human
[42:07] being
[42:08] i'm let's all say i'm just a human being
[42:10] ready
[42:12] and if god ever lifted his hands off
[42:15] your life church you would fall

[44:38] i live a humble life amen have mercy on
[44:41] me he said i need god's mercy we all
[44:43] need that amen
[44:45] that's one of the most beautiful quotes
[44:47] i've read in a long time
[44:48] there's a lot of beautiful quotes but
[44:49] that's a real beautiful one to me praise
[44:51] god yeah
[44:53] look at the humility of this man
[44:55] he stood before which doctors
[44:57] he'd seen the blind received their eyes
[44:59] the literal eye sockets
[45:00] right the eyes in the eye sockets
[45:03] he's seen a congressman a paralyzed man
[45:04] rise up you would think he would be like
[45:06] on cloud nine and i'm just a faith
[45:08] machine i'm gonna just heal you and heal
[45:11] you and heal you
[45:13] and he he was just to be a faith machine
[45:15] but he wasn't he was a man he was humble
[45:17] he was the prophet of god who knew the
[45:19] word of god he knew there was a real
[45:21] devil but he also knew there was a real
[45:22] god
[45:24] praise the lord
[45:26] he said god would ever lift this hand of
[45:28] protection off me i'd certainly fall
[45:30] oh yes that's why god sent the angel
[45:33] before he left the scene and standing in
[45:34] the gap amen praise that's why god sent
[45:36] the angel he would have failed
[45:38] the angel said your wife would have left
[45:40] you now how would that have looked today
[45:41] yeah
[45:43] if we've been preaching and well brother
[45:44] i was really really on fire well it's
[45:46] about 1963 you know
[45:49] right after the seals his wife left him
[45:51] and you know
[45:53] so brothers if you want to leave your
[45:54] wives that's okay i mean can you imagine
[45:56] sisters you can leave your husbands if
[45:58] you want to
[45:59] because it happened to the prophet of
[46:00] god but who kept him from evil god kept
[46:02] it for me glory to god from evil
[46:05] god amen god's hand upon you keep saying
[46:08] the word satan get back say move back
[46:11] let the presence of god cover my life
[46:25] all week not all week just one time oh
[46:27] no
[46:28] just one time that god's anointing your
[46:30] mind
[46:31] what would you do oh lord you don't want
[46:34] to know what you do no
[46:36] you don't want to know what i do no or
[46:38] brother or anybody else
[46:40] no
[46:40] just one time let that anointing lead oh
[46:43] lord what would you do okay
[46:46] if you want a clue just look at the
[46:48] centers around you that happens
[46:50] haven't come to the message
[46:52] right your sister's probably put on
[46:54] bikinis
[46:55] brothers would probably follow them
[46:56] right out there on the beach
[46:58] all right run run into a theater movie
[47:00] theater and watch the avengers or
[47:02] whatever they got now batman or whatever
[47:04] hell man what are they all hell man
[47:05] whatever they are right
[47:07] bat dog man big man whatever they are
[47:08] they're all they're all demons
[47:11] they all want to be uh
[47:12] they don't want to be exalted like
[47:13] there's some pride like they got some
[47:14] superpowers only god satan's power is
[47:16] what they got
[47:18] see
[47:19] it's god's mercy
[47:21] that each time his hand is upon us oh
[47:24] yes
[47:25] hallelujah
[47:27] i don't want to forget that quote so i
[47:28] might be rehearsing that brother amen
[47:30] brother bank just you know i might be
[47:31] bringing that every every couple months
[47:32] i might be bringing that quote out okay
[47:34] to remind you i need to humble myself
[47:37] be thankful for god's constant
[47:39] protection on my life
[47:42] brother jesse brother bang
[47:43] a sister naomi brother jose how can you
[47:46] live this life god's hand is upon him
[47:50] his hand because if it wasn't you don't
[47:52] know what you do
[47:54] now i just want to go i just want to get
[47:56] a little i listen to a yesterday i was
[47:58] uh
[47:58] i just i was driving home from you know
[48:00] with the kids you know what i was
[48:02] listening to a sermon on i want to look
[48:04] for a sermon called pride throughout the
[48:05] whole bible i just i saw this i just
[48:07] clicked on a baptist preacher you know i
[48:08] listened to brother this week i listened
[48:10] to influence god talked about uzziah but
[48:12] i want to listen to a another like this
[48:15] in the sermons
[48:16] and this baptist preacher brought out
[48:18] uzziah's
[48:19] now brother branham labored on usaid if
[48:22] you look up influence he preached it
[48:23] numerous times probably five to ten
[48:24] times
[48:26] and he's talking about the influence
[48:27] that uzziah lived under
[48:28] and then isaiah had to find the right
[48:31] influence right
[48:33] because isaiah looked at uzziah at the
[48:34] end of his life and then isaiah saw him
[48:36] fall away and he's like how could this
[48:38] happen and then god brought isaiah into
[48:40] the temple and then he saw the lord high
[48:42] exalted and highly lifted up
[48:45] now get your influence from that it's
[48:47] your influence from those holy seraphims
[48:51] that are reverent and they fear god and
[48:53] they're in action
[48:55] from the angels of god amen
[48:57] god almighty
[48:59] but this baptist preacher thought i'd
[49:01] never really seen before so you've got
[49:03] your bible go to second corinthians or
[49:04] second chronicles 25
[49:06] second chronicles 25 rather
[49:09] i'm just going to pull a few thoughts
[49:10] and then i had some thoughts of my own
[49:16] a church
[49:18] i just thought it was so interesting
[49:21] fathers and sons and let me say like
[49:23] this mothers and daughters probably
[49:25] battle a lot of the same things right
[49:27] sure you might feel bad about that but
[49:28] that's actually an encouragement
[49:30] like i know what i battle with so i go
[49:32] to my son and i can say malcolm you know
[49:33] we're on the drive home you got a battle
[49:35] with this and that and he might say oh
[49:36] that's the same thing i bet well now
[49:38] he's got a he's got a mentor
[49:40] you're right now me i can't talk to my
[49:41] dad my dad he's depressed you know don't
[49:44] talk to me about those things
[49:45] but mount guy he's got it good
[49:48] your children got it good they got you
[49:50] in their house they have to take you
[49:52] hallelujah
[49:53] amen
[49:55] so amaziah and uzziah battled pride
[49:58] abraham and isaac battle lying
[50:00] yeah
[50:03] brother hey that lying spirit will come
[50:05] around every now and then when the
[50:06] pressure comes on
[50:07] right if they didn't pray about it pass

[50:25] god said eliezer you know what what
[50:27] about all that testimony what are you
[50:28] doing
[50:29] can you imagine church
[50:31] this is what they battled amen father
[50:34] and son
[50:38] does the bible say uh that the iniquity
[50:40] is the father visit the children
[50:42] all right don't the bible say that
[50:45] but don't but don't the bible also say
[50:48] that when we become sons god gives us
[50:50] the power to become the sons of god amen
[50:53] how do you do the bible say that we got
[50:55] into a spiritual seed now i got
[50:57] spiritual in his power i got power
[50:59] through my heavenly father i got power
[51:01] and authority in the name of jesus
[51:03] christ amen
[51:05] yeah we're gonna have natural battles
[51:07] think about that by the amen the battle
[51:08] is your dad
[51:09] thought you're going to fight many of
[51:10] those yes that's true
[51:13] each one of us yeah
[51:16] my dad about still battles depression
[51:17] well guess what sometimes i battle
[51:21] my dad's uh that addictions of the flesh
[51:23] god's give me grace over that but like i
[51:25] told you i can still smell cigarette and
[51:26] my flesh wants to go get one
[51:28] that's just honest i've never done it
[51:30] since i became a christian i got victory
[51:33] but i'm tempted every time
[51:36] god didn't take that away from me god
[51:38] didn't take that out of me because he
[51:39] wants me to overcome praise god
[51:42] you must be the word god and be more
[51:43] than a conqueror hallelujah
[51:48] so maybe some of the things you've
[51:50] battled ah somebody battled that before
[51:53] and you can learn from that right
[51:56] that's true and then you apply that
[51:58] understanding you apply wisdom to your
[52:00] heart
[52:02] is that right church
[52:06] amaziah and uzziah both battled pride
[52:09] it was a family thing
[52:12] oh
[52:13] the church we're all going to have
[52:15] family things we've got to overcome
[52:17] that's true that's true
[52:22] now george let me say this we got to be
[52:24] real careful not to look down on people
[52:26] in the church because of things they
[52:28] battle
[52:29] true
[52:33] abraham the prophet and the son would
[52:34] you
[52:35] well they they're just a bunch of liars
[52:37] i mean think about the gospel that could
[52:38] have started that church
[52:41] abraham had 300 servants amen with
[52:43] families and they all look at well
[52:46] he's the father of faith but they lie
[52:48] all the time
[52:51] well guess what when you point that
[52:52] finger how many got point back at you
[52:54] true
[52:55] three fingers pointing back at you
[52:58] oh look at daddy abraham will look at
[53:00] you
[53:01] what have you struggled with this week
[53:03] all right
[53:06] see how we need a lot of gracious
[53:07] merciful savior
[53:10] lamb of god hallelujah
[53:12] prince i've been saying this the last
[53:13] few weeks with gideon and all these guys
[53:15] men of god that had victories with fail
[53:17] i've been saying that i've been praying
[53:18] this over and over god keep my sins
[53:21] private between you and me
[53:24] at the very least at the very least it's
[53:26] going to be with my family please don't
[53:28] let me sit amongst the church so it
[53:29] don't impact the church praise the lord
[53:32] is that your prayer too
[53:33] yes
[53:34] i hope it's your prayer yes
[53:37] you see church in the old testament they
[53:38] didn't have access back to the holy
[53:40] ghost so abraham well they're kind of
[53:42] struggle with lying
[53:45] now look some some families struggle
[53:47] with lust of the flesh
[53:49] yes
[53:52] so sexual battles some families will
[53:54] really struggle with that true
[53:57] lust of the eyes
[53:58] riches
[54:00] a bigger house some families are really
[54:02] going to struggle with that
[54:04] yeah
[54:05] but the bible says when you accept the
[54:07] word of god it will bring those
[54:09] temptations into subjection to the word
[54:11] of god amen
[54:13] hallelujah merciful savior
[54:15] your body has to obey your profession
[54:18] hallelujah
[54:19] so whether it's lying whether it's
[54:21] sexual lust whether it's pride or money
[54:23] or something like that you've got to say
[54:26] body and mind you're going to obey the
[54:27] word of god i command my life to praise
[54:30] the lord amen
[54:31] hallelujah oh blessed be the name i cast
[54:34] all these thoughts i cast on this
[54:35] generational curse i cast down these
[54:37] things that are passed out in jesus name
[54:40] and i will overcome i'll break the cycle
[54:42] i'll be the overcomer i'll be the
[54:44] conqueror amen
[54:45] if you help me if you help me and you
[54:48] keep your hands on my heart i'm overcome
[54:50] by the grace
[54:58] that's right you're going to fall on him
[55:01] and say jesus help me this week i'm
[55:02] really bad online this week or god help
[55:05] me i'm really bad and proud if he got
[55:06] better than other people or jesus really
[55:08] bad those sexual lustful thoughts or the
[55:10] riches of money you either fall on him
[55:12] or he'll fall on you
[55:14] hallelujah
[55:16] merciful savior
[55:19] prince of peace so it was brother adams
[55:21] pride
[55:23] that's when he battled the most
[55:24] sure remember that remember there's that
[55:26] joke i just saw this remember that joke
[55:28] my man would tell his children he said
[55:29] there's three great men in kentucky
[55:31] there's abraham lincoln who's the other
[55:32] one
[55:35] daniel moon or some some westerner like
[55:37] that he said and your father
[55:39] brother used to joke around and tell his
[55:41] kids that joke
[55:44] he said that he had a repentant
[55:48] spiritually is he greater i think so
[55:52] by the blood
[55:53] yeah
[55:54] that's right that's prophet as a church
[55:56] age messenger that's it no doubt about
[55:58] it
[55:59] right but is it right for us to say that
[56:02] no
[56:03] and tell our children that lydia no
[56:05] one's greater well there's three great
[56:07] people out of ohio
[56:10] john glenn is john glenn from ohio yeah
[56:12] astronaut yes
[56:14] john glenn
[56:15] lebron james and your dad that's a god
[56:18] what a lie
[56:20] oh what a lie
[56:21] it's a lie yeah but it says there's no
[56:24] great ones among us let god do the label
[56:27] rewards
[56:29] at the judgment scene of christ let
[56:31] christ put the names and the rewards on
[56:33] people then not not
[56:39] see he had to learn how to humble
[56:40] himself
[56:46] of course my dad you know my family was
[56:48] lust to the i mean i had so many uncles
[56:50] that were addicted to either alcohol at
[56:51] drunkers i'm just playing i remember my
[56:52] uncle tone
[56:54] tony anthony he would come over he had
[56:56] this huge belly he was skinny like me
[56:58] but huge pot belly he had suspenders on
[57:00] he would just sit down there with my dad
[57:01] smoke cigarettes and just drink alcohol
[57:03] for hours yeah and he eventually
[57:05] convinced my dad to divorce my mom and
[57:07] then my dad said as soon as he did that
[57:09] as soon as he agreed to divorce his mom
[57:12] tony never came back
[57:13] he was anointed of the devil to break up
[57:15] the marriage sure
[57:17] is that right sure yeah
[57:20] yeah i mean my uncles are all i only got
[57:22] one that's kind of like actually a
[57:24] health guy
[57:25] actually takes care of his body
[57:27] so what is that lust of the flesh
[57:30] addicted to alcohol addicted to
[57:31] cigarettes addicted to all these things
[57:34] so see we we all got a little lineage we
[57:35] got to overcome by god's grace
[57:37] we all got uh generational uh battles
[57:41] that we've got to overcome but how many
[57:43] are here to win the battle amen
[57:45] amen
[57:47] hallelujah
[57:48] you're gonna battle something so you
[57:50] might as well look at well god what am i
[57:52] gonna battle and god made me such a
[57:53] warrior saint make me so dedicated
[57:56] protect me let my mind be so focused on
[57:58] when this battle that i can glorify your
[58:00] name and you'll say well done good and
[58:02] faithful servant hallelujah amen amen
[58:06] your grace is sufficient thank you jesus
[58:11] i feel i praise the lord
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:17] [Music]
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:23] might as well realize it and get graced
[58:25] overcome it
[58:27] remember at that last time
[58:28] the longer you live it's going to come
[58:30] back pride is going to be the one that
[58:31] battles you sure yeah pride is going to
[58:34] be the one that battles you i'm better
[58:36] yeah i can do this you have mercy i
[58:38] don't know jesus i got this you know
[58:40] they say uh-oh you got nothing
[58:43] except a bad spirit
[58:45] that's what they got a bad thing yeah
[58:48] now second chronicles 25
[58:50] verse 2.
[58:51] the overall ranking of this member
[58:53] there's three kinds of kings they did
[58:54] that which was right
[58:56] right but did this and then there was
[58:57] that did evil
[58:59] and messiah use eyes ads in the middle
[59:02] verse two he did that which was right in
[59:05] the sight of the lord but not with a
[59:06] perfect heart so he did right for a
[59:08] while but then
[59:09] within his life
[59:11] did the wrong thing
[59:13] now this is quite a story in verse 7
[59:16] amaziah
[59:18] hearkens to a prophet he was going to go
[59:20] hire some men
[59:22] from northern israel to fight
[59:24] with him against the but then a
[59:26] prophet came with thus saith the lord in
[59:28] verse 7. but there came a man of god to
[59:30] him saying o king let not the army of
[59:32] israel go with thee for the lord is not
[59:34] with israel to win with all the children
[59:36] of ephraim but if thou will go do it and
[59:39] be strong for the battle god shall make
[59:41] thee fall before the enemy
[59:43] for god has power to help and to cast
[59:45] down that beautiful god has power to
[59:47] help you and also cast down your enemy
[59:50] praise god
[59:51] and we know he hearkens and the
[59:53] are defeated but look at verse 14. now
[59:55] this is quite striking i i can only
[59:57] think of a few examples before coming to
[59:59] church i was thinking about this
[1:00:01] look at verse 14. now came to pass after
[1:00:03] the amazon has come from the slaughter
[1:00:04] of the that he brought the gods
[1:00:07] of the children of seer
[1:00:08] and set them up to be his gods and bowed
[1:00:10] himself
[1:00:11] before them and burned incense unto them
[1:00:14] that wherefore the anger of the lord was
[1:00:16] killed against a messiah and he said
[1:00:18] unto him a prophet said to him why hast
[1:00:20] thou sought after the gods of the people
[1:00:22] which could not deliver their own people
[1:00:24] out of their own hand out of their hand
[1:00:26] what a cr what a just unbelievable story
[1:00:30] first of all he obeys the prophet of the
[1:00:32] hour and got a great testimony
[1:00:34] the church said amen there's a lot of
[1:00:36] people that follow brothers ministry
[1:00:37] that had testimonies
[1:00:38] that don't mean you're saved no
[1:00:41] that don't mean you're an authority now
[1:00:42] you can tell everybody else what to do
[1:00:43] and your personal stories are better
[1:00:45] than the tapes and the bible life
[1:00:48] amen not better
[1:00:50] right because you got to watch what
[1:00:51] they're going to do after they got these
[1:00:52] testimonies
[1:00:55] it's just it's astonishing
[1:00:57] the very gods they defeated
[1:01:00] amaziah said well let's let's worship
[1:01:02] them
[1:01:03] yeah can you imagine
[1:01:05] god just gave you the greatest victory
[1:01:07] you could possibly ask for and then you
[1:01:09] want to go and worship other gods
[1:01:12] and the only one i could think of is
[1:01:13] that i know a person in a church
[1:01:15] god healed them they were walking in a
[1:01:17] cane
[1:01:19] and then after that there was some can i
[1:01:21] just say like this there was some
[1:01:23] gossiping in the church
[1:01:24] some brothers didn't make it right with
[1:01:26] he and his wife they ended up leaving
[1:01:28] the church and he
[1:01:29] he could hardly walk he had a cane he
[1:01:31] was in his 30s god i was at the service
[1:01:33] he was supernaturally healed and he just
[1:01:36] threw the pain away that later that week
[1:01:38] and the the military doctors were just
[1:01:41] baffled how could this happen
[1:01:43] it was a great testimony
[1:01:46] but after some gossiping happened and
[1:01:48] some
[1:01:49] backbiting or something i don't know all
[1:01:50] the details
[1:01:52] they refuse to go back to church people
[1:01:54] refuse to repent and the last time i
[1:01:56] talked to myself i talked to him on the
[1:01:57] thing on the text on facebook he said
[1:01:59] brother why aren't you in the house of
[1:02:00] god
[1:02:01] he said well i've lost my jobs and
[1:02:03] and i got to go work at a carnival and
[1:02:06] so i can't go to church on sundays you
[1:02:08] know those carnivals they used to have
[1:02:09] before copenhagen remember all those
[1:02:11] things before copenhagen
[1:02:14] and i thought how sad i thought this is
[1:02:16] the perfect example god heals the man so
[1:02:18] he can walk
[1:02:20] but he won't take any other job if i was
[1:02:22] in that place i would just go down to
[1:02:24] mcdonald's if i'd have a job i'd go down
[1:02:26] to mcdonald's and say hire me i just
[1:02:28] want to work i don't want to waste any
[1:02:29] days that's what i did
[1:02:32] now i said god gave me a job at the
[1:02:33] grocery store
[1:02:34] bagging groceries
[1:02:36] right after college
[1:02:39] i went back for a job and i got one
[1:02:42] and then the next day god gave me a
[1:02:44] better one
[1:02:45] then next week god gave me a better one
[1:02:47] amen today amen praise the lord but it's
[1:02:50] the only one i can think of god heals
[1:02:52] you so you can walk
[1:02:55] and you refuse let me say this you
[1:02:57] refuse to humble yourself and go to that
[1:02:59] brother and make it right
[1:03:01] and so because of that bitterness spirit
[1:03:03] it keeps you out of church and now let
[1:03:05] me say like this he's bowing down and
[1:03:07] worshipping the god of money saying oh i
[1:03:09] can't go to god's house because god's
[1:03:11] people now spiritually he's bowing down
[1:03:13] and say i got to make money
[1:03:15] he could go to any other church
[1:03:17] he could went to the baptist he could
[1:03:18] have made it to the lutheran he went to
[1:03:20] the medical school any other church but
[1:03:21] instead they're bowing down worshipping
[1:03:24] the gods of the enemy that
[1:03:27] they were delivered from
[1:03:29] he was delivered from
[1:03:31] the ability where you couldn't even walk
[1:03:32] without a cane
[1:03:36] but because of sin
[1:03:37] you go right back to that isn't that
[1:03:39] something true
[1:03:41] that's why divine healing is not the
[1:03:43] major no healing is the major yeah
[1:03:47] if his soul would have gotten healed he
[1:03:48] never released the word of god amen amen
[1:03:53] surely god healed my man you can't wait
[1:03:55] till they open those doors for church
[1:03:56] service to get in here and worship your
[1:03:59] god with god's children hallelujah
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:05] god raised him up defeated his enemies
[1:04:06] and he went right back and worshiped the
[1:04:08] gods of this world
[1:04:10] let's be careful let's not shake our
[1:04:12] heads like well i could never do that
[1:04:13] that's the same thing use i said
[1:04:15] it's the same thing he thought
[1:04:17] i'll never do that
[1:04:20] if god takes his hand away you never
[1:04:21] know what you oh lord jesus
[1:04:25] merciful
[1:04:27] well i obey the prophet i i god did a
[1:04:29] miracle in my life i don't doubt that
[1:04:31] one day right
[1:04:33] but what are you doing right now to show
[1:04:34] god your appreciation
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:37] what are you worshiping right now where
[1:04:40] are you getting your advice from right
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:44] the word of god
[1:04:46] or somebody else
[1:04:48] see
[1:04:49] see after we have to make sure every
[1:04:51] time we get something is from the lord
[1:04:53] yeah we have to make sure we're being
[1:04:54] led by the holy spirit true
[1:04:57] praise god true that's why when i was on
[1:04:59] facebook i used to joke and say be
[1:05:00] careful who you follow
[1:05:02] right well i'm following this person i'm
[1:05:04] following you you better be careful
[1:05:06] you're following yeah they might lead
[1:05:08] you to hell
[1:05:09] that's true
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:14] then in chapter 26 now he lived a
[1:05:16] mediocre life he died in sin remember
[1:05:19] you died for each other numerous times i
[1:05:21] believe he was the old testament church
[1:05:22] and messenger brother right and i've got
[1:05:24] the receipts to prove i've got the
[1:05:25] questions they received i got the
[1:05:26] scriptures to prove it i think
[1:05:28] lebron said the old testament had uh
[1:05:30] messengers from solomon to john the
[1:05:32] baptist
[1:05:33] okay there's just a couple quotes that i
[1:05:34] preached on that
[1:05:35] last year
[1:05:37] anyways this man built and restored
[1:05:39] israel he built inventions he had all
[1:05:41] these engines he invented to yeah
[1:05:42] protect israel you know i beated all
[1:05:44] these foes for 50 plus years he defeated
[1:05:47] that right
[1:05:48] it's true i haven't been preaching 20
[1:05:50] years
[1:05:52] i'm getting close though i'm at 18.
[1:05:55] this guy preached hard uh reigned over
[1:05:58] sin for 50 plus years yeah
[1:06:02] but then at the end of his life he says
[1:06:04] i'm going to be something that i'm not
[1:06:07] i just want to experience what is it
[1:06:09] like to pray in the presence of god in
[1:06:11] the holy place i've got to experience
[1:06:13] that i've never got to go to the holy
[1:06:14] place i've just got to go in there oh
[1:06:17] now can you imagine this church eighty
[1:06:19] men one two three four five six three
[1:06:21] three two two
[1:06:22] okay we got twenty here okay so take
[1:06:23] this church multiply times four
[1:06:25] that's all the people that tried to stop
[1:06:27] using from going there stop stop can you
[1:06:29] imagine
[1:06:30] 80 people don't do it you you're lifted
[1:06:32] up in pride don't do it and not the
[1:06:34] bible we didn't read it but the bible
[1:06:36] said each one of these cases it was
[1:06:37] pride that lifted them up
[1:06:40] because i knew the prophet because i
[1:06:41] obeyed the prophet because i've done so
[1:06:42] many great things i can do whatever i
[1:06:44] want that's a lie you can't do that you
[1:06:46] should all do what god calls you to do
[1:06:49] jesus
[1:06:50] that's right
[1:06:51] and 80 believers couldn't keep this man
[1:06:54] from satisfying his pride
[1:06:57] church here's how you know
[1:06:59] that you got pride when someone tries to
[1:07:01] correct you or god tries to correct you
[1:07:02] you get mad
[1:07:04] yeah that's it they both got mad
[1:07:07] that's why watch when people blow up
[1:07:09] church oh yeah watch when they lose
[1:07:12] their cool oh yeah just got event oh
[1:07:15] yeah
[1:07:16] now we all got to talk to people right
[1:07:17] we all need counseling but i'm talking
[1:07:18] about blowing up and angry and saying
[1:07:21] things harsh things you ought not to say
[1:07:24] that's going a little too far
[1:07:26] yeah that's a spirit doing that yeah
[1:07:29] there is
[1:07:32] that's right and he got mad
[1:07:35] and the bible said when he was in there
[1:07:37] he finally looked he finally got to do
[1:07:38] what he wanted church also was shaking
[1:07:40] like an incense thing you know and
[1:07:42] offering prayers at the author of
[1:07:44] incense
[1:07:45] i mean it was i mean it was glorious
[1:07:46] don't get wrong but it was
[1:07:48] it wasn't his calling right burning the
[1:07:50] fire saying the prayers while he's in
[1:07:52] there he sees he gets leprosy
[1:07:56] and i can't do oh
[1:07:57] and he runs out
[1:08:00] all because of pride
[1:08:02] his life ends in disgrace
[1:08:05] all because of pride
[1:08:07] so this is a good example of god taking
[1:08:09] his hand off somebody
[1:08:11] because he took his eyes off god
[1:08:15] because the bible says as long as he saw
[1:08:17] the lord god made him prosper yeah so he
[1:08:20] got to the spot after 50 years i don't
[1:08:22] need to go down to the altar anymore i
[1:08:23] don't need to go up for prayer for
[1:08:24] brother jesse tomorrow i have to read my
[1:08:26] bible i don't do this anymore i got it
[1:08:28] all figured out
[1:08:29] i know what i can do i know i know the
[1:08:31] message
[1:08:32] oh no
[1:08:33] i've obeyed the prophet i've got
[1:08:34] testimonies a mile long lydia i can tell
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:43] because all those were god's victories
[1:08:44] have mercy yes he thought they were his
[1:08:46] righteousness
[1:08:50] lamb of god people
[1:08:52] could not convince you that he was
[1:08:53] private
[1:08:56] they couldn't convince him to stop
[1:08:57] before you wreck
[1:08:59] your testimony
[1:09:03] this is what pride does church
[1:09:09] pride
[1:09:10] exalts our ways above god's ways
[1:09:14] i was looking at actually that scripture
[1:09:16] yeah and if you go to the previous
[1:09:18] chapter 25 about amazing verse 19. thou
[1:09:21] sayest low thou hast smit in the
[1:09:22] and thine heart lifted the up
[1:09:24] to boast
[1:09:27] okay now look he's
[1:09:28] msi took credit i beat the and
[1:09:31] it wasn't even him
[1:09:32] i mean the very least he said it was the
[1:09:34] problem of god
[1:09:36] at the very least
[1:09:37] but now he's taking credit it was me
[1:09:39] that beat him
[1:09:40] oh it was god giving you the word
[1:09:42] through the prophet and you just obeyed
[1:09:44] right i just humbled myself one time but
[1:09:48] it got to the spot where i did this oh
[1:09:51] i caused myself this great victory
[1:09:57] that's right because of that you'll lose
[1:09:59] everything
[1:10:01] and he did he lost his life
[1:10:05] my goodness
[1:10:09] now brother take usia church and this is
[1:10:11] what i've been listening to the last few
[1:10:12] weeks but listen to
[1:10:14] uh
[1:10:15] this is the one from november 14 63.
[1:10:17] okay the same one i read earlier
[1:10:19] but abram takes using he says the the
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] equivalent today is a minister building
[1:10:24] their own kingdom with the false
[1:10:26] security
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:28] that's right just because we're small
[1:10:29] doesn't mean i i i can uh i don't pay
[1:10:32] attention to this
[1:10:33] because you know a preacher can build a
[1:10:35] kingdom with a small church or the big
[1:10:37] church it don't matter right
[1:10:39] true i'm not just saying just oh if you
[1:10:41] have a big church you can build a
[1:10:42] kingdom no you can build a kingdom here
[1:10:44] true it's a small one though oh yeah
[1:10:46] right so i've got to be careful too
[1:10:48] i've got to examine myself too just like
[1:10:50] you have to examine yourself yeah
[1:10:54] now he says first because i was raised
[1:10:55] in a godly home as parents now which dad
[1:10:57] was serving the lord
[1:11:00] now uzziah's kingdom was so great it was
[1:11:02] next to solomon's i believe it's
[1:11:03] anointed next to solomon's how god
[1:11:05] blessed him
[1:11:06] this was a great influence upon upon the
[1:11:07] young prophet isaiah who was at the
[1:11:09] temple of the time or in the land and
[1:11:11] how he was seen and how god would bless
[1:11:12] a man that taken the right stand and
[1:11:14] done the right thing and right motive
[1:11:15] and right objective and he done right
[1:11:18] and uzziah held his standard he was a
[1:11:20] great influence as i've said to isaiah
[1:11:22] the prophet then uzziah made the fatal
[1:11:24] mistake just like many other people does
[1:11:26] when he got felt secured felt that he
[1:11:28] had just the whole thing in his hand he
[1:11:30] got lifted up in his spirit
[1:11:33] he got lifted up to pride now there is a
[1:11:35] real example for us all amen everybody
[1:11:38] say all ready oh that means me
[1:11:41] you
[1:11:42] a good example for us all is when god
[1:11:44] blesses you how many of god blessed out
[1:11:46] there you have to raise your hands
[1:11:49] god's blessed me
[1:11:50] how many ever feel secure i've got to be
[1:11:51] careful with that
[1:11:53] i'm securing god's love
[1:11:55] praise god i'm securing the blood of
[1:11:57] jesus christ praise god glory
[1:12:00] but he got the wrong kind of security
[1:12:03] yes
[1:12:05] and he got lifted up
[1:12:07] and this is an example when you feel
[1:12:09] secure
[1:12:10] you feel like god's blessed you so much
[1:12:12] so you are you know but no nothing can
[1:12:14] bring you down
[1:12:17] church many times i pray that this is my
[1:12:18] prayer clause i'm sure you do do i just
[1:12:20] pray god keep me from falling god give
[1:12:22] me strength today keep me obeying your
[1:12:24] word help me to be humble help me to be
[1:12:26] faithful just keep keeping me awake
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:30] help me lord jesus
[1:12:32] you know that's been the trouble what's
[1:12:34] been the trouble pride's been the
[1:12:35] trouble
[1:12:38] i'm speaking to christians and ministers
[1:12:40] i want to be honest about these things
[1:12:41] and just
[1:12:42] that's where many ministers even make a
[1:12:44] mistake we've heard so many times about
[1:12:45] the ministers the acts they do with the
[1:12:46] things some of them may be doing things
[1:12:48] that they should not do i think
[1:12:50] sometimes they're them our good man a
[1:12:51] wonderful christian that's been used to
[1:12:53] the lord so see a preacher that's been
[1:12:55] used of god he's got testimonies just
[1:12:56] like a messiah
[1:12:58] just like usia
[1:13:00] but then finally they get a little
[1:13:01] kingdom built around them or a lot of
[1:13:04] influence many people attend their
[1:13:06] meetings okay so okay now i can see
[1:13:09] until they get careless what they say
[1:13:11] behind the pulpit
[1:13:14] and they get kind of lifted up
[1:13:17] the people applaud them
[1:13:19] let's see church that's right i never
[1:13:20] want you to clap for me if you enjoy
[1:13:22] something don't you clap for jesus
[1:13:25] but see a prideful preacher will start
[1:13:26] thinking oh clapping
[1:13:29] me that's i i must have something to do
[1:13:30] with this
[1:13:32] it's because of me
[1:13:34] they're clapping for me
[1:13:35] now we like we like to clap for your
[1:13:37] birthdays but we're not worshiping you
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:43] he says we really shouldn't do that
[1:13:47] clap for preachers applaud preachers
[1:13:52] remember we're just all
[1:13:54] there's no big people among us
[1:13:57] we're all just god's children you see
[1:14:00] if god made some of us one thing and
[1:14:02] some another why he made me the finger
[1:14:04] and i and so forth well we got to
[1:14:06] appreciate each other and then not
[1:14:09] sorry
[1:14:10] not try to feel good
[1:14:13] hey i've got to find a way to tell
[1:14:15] malcolm i appreciate all your piano
[1:14:18] playing i appreciate your organ
[1:14:20] i appreciate your song little brother
[1:14:21] it's such a blessing but yet at the same
[1:14:23] time but don't get lifted up
[1:14:26] true you with me
[1:14:29] well jose i appreciate your testimonies
[1:14:30] and send those prayer claws
[1:14:32] i appreciate that pray so long but i'm
[1:14:34] not going to exalt you
[1:14:36] stay humble
[1:14:37] amen
[1:14:40] praise long
[1:14:42] but to make sure we know who we're
[1:14:43] clapping for
[1:14:44] it's true
[1:14:46] hallelujah amen
[1:14:48] we have to make sure we know who we're
[1:14:49] thinking
[1:14:50] blessed be the lord so i gotta quote my
[1:14:52] man said don't you ever thank any man
[1:14:54] because all this grace goes on jesus
[1:14:56] christ
[1:14:58] now we can say well thank you brother
[1:14:59] thank you sister but we got to say it
[1:15:00] with humility we got to say well all the
[1:15:03] real the real things the real glory that
[1:15:04] goes to jesus
[1:15:07] because we're all connected to one god
[1:15:10] the lamb of god and we all come off one
[1:15:12] tree
[1:15:14] yeah now we find that many times
[1:15:16] ministers gets to feel a little secure
[1:15:19] and they keep leading out and the first
[1:15:21] thing you know they'll do things they
[1:15:23] should not see they just start with
[1:15:24] something small oh god didn't strike me
[1:15:26] dead like i said i want it oh i didn't
[1:15:27] feel lightened
[1:15:28] maybe i know a little further god
[1:15:30] doesn't oh god i didn't
[1:15:32] god didn't kill me there
[1:15:33] maybe i could try this and pretty soon
[1:15:35] you zaya tried all these things now look
[1:15:37] it's in progress
[1:15:39] now he thinks well i can just go and i
[1:15:40] can be a priest
[1:15:42] i've defeated every i've defeated every
[1:15:44] enemy there ever was
[1:15:46] i'm undefeated
[1:15:49] and see church it's just not one time
[1:15:51] it's just it's a sin that's a sin
[1:15:52] progression you sin one time goes a
[1:15:55] little further it goes a little further
[1:15:56] see that's why we gotta repent after the
[1:15:57] first time
[1:15:59] preparing for the first time
[1:16:03] again i'm reading this quote again bill
[1:16:04] graham says
[1:16:06] sometimes great guys get together and
[1:16:08] you hear them say great so and so great
[1:16:10] so-and-so don't never do that
[1:16:12] there's no great ones among us
[1:16:15] no
[1:16:17] i like this though i'm just gonna read
[1:16:18] this for my sake just encourage me okay
[1:16:20] i don't care if you're a pastor of
[1:16:21] church that's got five people there
[1:16:22] glory
[1:16:23] thank you lord that don't make you
[1:16:25] little that makes you a glory i'm a
[1:16:27] brother
[1:16:29] hallelujah
[1:16:30] thank god okay now i'm encouraged all
[1:16:31] right now let's go
[1:16:33] notice god himself come down from ivory
[1:16:35] palaces to glory to become one of us
[1:16:38] now who's the big one
[1:16:40] see we all got to get the perspective
[1:16:41] who's the bigger one oh i got a bigger
[1:16:42] church i got a bigger youtube following
[1:16:44] i've got bigger than all this
[1:16:46] no there's one way higher above that
[1:16:49] man
[1:16:50] the one who came down from the ivory
[1:16:51] tower
[1:16:54] not to be in the form of a priest but a
[1:16:56] servant
[1:16:57] washed the very clay created the feet of
[1:16:59] the apostles
[1:17:00] now
[1:17:04] can these preachers wash the feet they
[1:17:06] created
[1:17:09] can i wash feet i haven't created enough
[1:17:12] i could take sand off the beach man okay
[1:17:14] we did that a couple times we literally
[1:17:16] we can take a bucket of sand and try to
[1:17:17] make it look like some feet you know
[1:17:19] try to wash it but those aren't real
[1:17:21] feet
[1:17:22] i'd be deceiving myself
[1:17:24] who's the great one the one who can make
[1:17:26] the feet make the feet walk give life to
[1:17:28] the feet and then wash them amen amen
[1:17:31] that's a great man hallelujah yes it is
[1:17:34] so be very careful don't don't say i got
[1:17:36] a great pastor no you just say god is
[1:17:39] saying god has kept his hand on my
[1:17:40] pastor yeah and i'll say the same thing
[1:17:42] about you praise god god has kept his
[1:17:45] hands on the brothers in the church
[1:17:46] praise the lord
[1:17:48] god has protected our sisters in the
[1:17:49] church they've been able to stand all
[1:17:51] these battles
[1:17:52] praise the lord but i shouldn't say i've
[1:17:54] got a great song leader although i
[1:17:56] appreciate our song peter i've got great
[1:17:58] musicians i shouldn't say that
[1:18:01] i should say thank you lord i appreciate
[1:18:03] our song musicians they've got gifts and
[1:18:05] talents now if i said that you have to
[1:18:07] help me and repent you have to help
[1:18:08] remind me i have to go back and dance
[1:18:11] honestly i've said that
[1:18:13] i gotta learn i gotta learn i have to
[1:18:14] learn the very things i'm preaching i
[1:18:16] gotta learn myself
[1:18:17] sure right you don't practice what you
[1:18:19] preach if you don't practice what you
[1:18:20] profess what is it it's vanity
[1:18:22] very bad
[1:18:24] now who's the great one jesus is the
[1:18:26] great one yes he is
[1:18:29] i'm trying to get somewhere but
[1:18:31] it's going good praise god going good
[1:18:32] look at brother humility and then it's
[1:18:34] also his plea for us to be humble
[1:18:39] now this one this is what i told you
[1:18:40] about we want to be gems in the crown of
[1:18:42] jesus christ don't
[1:18:44] you we won't i'm sorry we don't want
[1:18:47] never put a man in it
[1:18:49] you forget anything about me
[1:18:52] or you're saying well brother justin he
[1:18:53] just said that to be humble let's keep
[1:18:55] reading the quote
[1:18:57] i'm your brother sinner saved by grace
[1:18:59] not fit to live that's exactly the truth
[1:19:01] and i ain't saying that to be humble
[1:19:06] [Laughter]
[1:19:08] hallelujah
[1:19:10] hallelujah amen now remember this is
[1:19:13] after he told all the stories about the
[1:19:15] visions about the church age i'm sorry
[1:19:17] the seven seals i remember there were
[1:19:19] seven visions about the church ages i
[1:19:20] was at seven seasons i keep fixing up
[1:19:22] there's some visions about the church
[1:19:23] there's the seven seals that he makes it
[1:19:24] up
[1:19:26] he says there are nothing nothing in me
[1:19:28] not one something at all but by the
[1:19:29] grace of god god has let my poor dimming
[1:19:32] eyes look beyond the curtain of time
[1:19:36] so look how brother man placed it
[1:19:39] a man that battled a critical spirit but
[1:19:41] he could still humble himself after
[1:19:42] preaching the seven seals and the
[1:19:44] revelations contained which he did not
[1:19:45] plagiarize i proved that on the on the
[1:19:48] youtube and you can watch it on the
[1:19:49] podcast
[1:19:53] he said we never want to put a man in it
[1:19:55] and give them the credit he says it's
[1:19:57] all
[1:19:58] jesus christ amen
[1:20:02] hallelujah he said i ain't saying that
[1:20:05] to be humble
[1:20:06] that's true he says that's facts
[1:20:09] hey man
[1:20:11] hey man
[1:20:12] that's sex hey man
[1:20:15] church where's this kind of humility it
[1:20:16] should be in the bride yeah but i showed
[1:20:18] you i know all bright people are bright
[1:20:21] no not all bright people are humbling
[1:20:23] themselves some of them are exalting
[1:20:24] themselves
[1:20:28] i don't think so
[1:20:29] what about this
[1:20:30] amen brother brandon said he's sitting
[1:20:33] every day and so did paul
[1:20:36] but i said we are tempted all of us are
[1:20:38] tempted all of a sin there's none
[1:20:39] without sin every day we sin paul said
[1:20:41] he had to die daily so brother used that
[1:20:43] scripture to see it so to show paul
[1:20:45] sinned every day she had to die to die
[1:20:47] out to sin every day sure
[1:20:49] and if we say we sin and have no sin
[1:20:51] rather then we make god a lie and we
[1:20:54] could not do that so we sin daily and
[1:20:56] it's grace god's grace this satan yeah
[1:21:00] and as we confess our wrongs god is just
[1:21:03] to forgive them
[1:21:04] and your confession i love this as long
[1:21:06] as it holds good your salvation is
[1:21:08] perfect
[1:21:10] same as it is in divine healing it's
[1:21:12] your personal faith in a resurrected
[1:21:14] lord jesus
[1:21:16] [Applause]
[1:21:20] hallelujah
[1:21:23] you're never going to get to a spot
[1:21:24] where you're not tempted you're never
[1:21:26] going to get to a spot where you don't
[1:21:27] sin but you've got to keep confessing
[1:21:29] the sins and giving god all the praise
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] next year what was that next week yeah
[1:21:36] next year
[1:21:39] he said we're perfected absolutely
[1:21:41] spotless and blameless not one sin on us
[1:21:43] are you above temptation never
[1:21:46] do you sin every day
[1:21:48] yes sir
[1:21:50] but yet you are perfected because we are
[1:21:52] in him
[1:21:54] hallelujah that's what the bible says
[1:21:56] and god can no more judge us than
[1:21:58] nothing could it be righteous
[1:22:00] he's already judged us in him when he
[1:22:03] judge christ he judged me judge you and
[1:22:05] he can't judge me again because he took
[1:22:06] my judgment if i've been redeemed amen

[1:24:27] but he's just talking to god like he's
[1:24:29] just like he's god's friend amen like
[1:24:31] abraham was a friend of god
[1:24:35] but by grace he called me and invited me
[1:24:37] to come and i looked to him and he took
[1:24:40] the desire
[1:24:41] from me
[1:24:43] i make thousands of mistakes in a month
[1:24:45] i've read this one before read again in

[1:25:17] you're getting help from heaven you are
[1:25:19] you're uh you're tapping into the
[1:25:20] benefit of the blood sacrifice amen amen
[1:25:24] there's there's the where's the part of
[1:25:26] the gospel and you saying forgive me
[1:25:28] yeah where's the part of the gospel and
[1:25:30] you saying please forgive me i sinned
[1:25:32] against you
[1:25:33] there's the power of the gospel
[1:25:35] we all want miracles we all want to see
[1:25:36] the people healed and saved don't we
[1:25:38] yeah but quarterback says where's the
[1:25:40] miracle somebody that can humble himself
[1:25:42] and say i'm sorry amen
[1:25:45] that the holy church moves on and
[1:25:47] doesn't get stopped in one spot of sin
[1:25:49] or root of bitterness
[1:25:50] like aiken right
[1:25:52] they can move on to ai they can move on
[1:25:54] to more victories
[1:25:56] not because something you've done or me
[1:25:57] done
[1:25:58] it's something
[1:25:59] you had nothing to do with
[1:26:02] there is the atonement
[1:26:06] the church said amen
[1:26:08] remember the atonement makes you one at
[1:26:10] one it makes you one with god
[1:26:12] it appeases god's anger against us yes
[1:26:15] it is the blood of jesus christ takes
[1:26:17] away the propituation it's the wrath
[1:26:19] taker it takes away all the
[1:26:21] the guilt and thank you
[1:26:23] it takes it away because jesus took it
[1:26:25] for us thank you
[1:26:26] that's the atonement
[1:26:28] and that church is the power of the
[1:26:30] gospel well i want to hear some power of
[1:26:32] the gospel at church you totally did
[1:26:35] you heard two hours of it amen yeah
[1:26:37] sorry so long but
[1:26:38] i just can't stop i don't know why
[1:26:40] i just haven't actually been paying
[1:26:41] attention to god amen
[1:26:45] that's the power of the gospel amen
[1:26:47] someone who can humble himself yes it's
[1:26:50] true and follow
[1:26:52] god's will and seek after god and not
[1:26:54] get prideful lift it up and say i don't
[1:26:56] need to seek god for this i know how to
[1:26:57] handle this
[1:26:59] trying to close
[1:27:01] so again whether i'm starting a pastor
[1:27:02] in 1933 i think if i'm not mistaken he
[1:27:04] started passing at 24. i started passing
[1:27:06] 25.
[1:27:08] i love the similarities
[1:27:09] we all want to be like god's servants
[1:27:11] in humility if he died in 1965 that's 32
[1:27:14] years if he just did one sin a day just
[1:27:18] once in a day
[1:27:20] if he just said you should have thought
[1:27:21] that god forgive me oh shouldn't have
[1:27:23] stole that
[1:27:24] i should have lied to the irs like you
[1:27:26] did that one day
[1:27:28] that would be 11
[1:27:31] times
[1:27:32] now if like he said if he said i send
[1:27:35] thousands of mistakes a year
[1:27:37] and we'll take the low thousands which
[1:27:39] is 2 000.
[1:27:41] that is 64 000 pounds
[1:27:44] that he had look look i said like this
[1:27:46] 64 times had to fall on the on the stone
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] amen
[1:27:53] 64 000 times wow you and i can't even
[1:27:56] understand that no you can't understand
[1:28:00] 11 000. what does that number really
[1:28:02] look like
[1:28:04] maybe the hairs are in our heads i think
[1:28:05] maybe 12 000. someone's got more hair
[1:28:08] than others
[1:28:10] some of our brothers lose our hair
[1:28:12] good picture i can picture that many
[1:28:14] pairs
[1:28:15] but sixty four thousand
[1:28:19] sixty four thousand times and church i
[1:28:21] love this god is so faithful
[1:28:24] each time brother man when viola said
[1:28:25] say forgive me
[1:28:26] jesus would no doubt in heaven speak
[1:28:28] back you're forgiven
[1:28:30] praise the lord
[1:28:32] now peter got upset when jesus said
[1:28:34] you've got to forgive him seven times he
[1:28:36] was like how about seven seven times
[1:28:39] and jesus like no
[1:28:40] 70 times seven yeah
[1:28:43] four hundred ninety well i was like well
[1:28:44] who then can be saved are you this is
[1:28:47] impossible
[1:28:48] true
[1:28:49] jesus like just watch me peter just
[1:28:51] watch me i'm the virgin born son of god
[1:28:54] watch me take every punishment on that
[1:28:55] causation and i can forgive not just a
[1:28:58] 490 but 64 000 multiply that times all
[1:29:02] these believers down to the age think of
[1:29:04] how many times these these believers
[1:29:06] confess i'm sorry forgive me and each
[1:29:08] time jesus says you're forgiven i
[1:29:10] forgive you and it ain't just something
[1:29:11] he's saying he actually means it he
[1:29:14] actually gets rid of your guilt he sent
[1:29:16] your shame away he actually doesn't
[1:29:17] write down your sin because there's no
[1:29:19] condemnation and heaven doesn't record
[1:29:21] your sins amen
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:36] and yet
[1:29:37] just that just that year god forgave you
[1:29:39] 11 000.
[1:29:40] 679 more times
[1:29:43] but we'll hold one thing against the
[1:29:44] preacher right
[1:29:46] that's true you forgot to buy tissues
[1:29:48] for the church
[1:29:50] you're right ah i forgot to get water
[1:29:52] for the church and ran out
[1:29:57] are you gonna hold one thing against
[1:29:58] that sister
[1:30:01] or that brother
[1:30:02] but look how look how quick and merciful
[1:30:04] christ is amen forgive me
[1:30:08] you confess it
[1:30:09] i forgive you
[1:30:12] that's a lot of sins
[1:30:20] that's how these things happen you talk
[1:30:21] about how you'll raise the holy spirit
[1:30:23] that's why i can stand in the whole
[1:30:24] world and say has the word ever failed
[1:30:25] they'll say the lord god promised me
[1:30:27] back there as a kid that's the reason
[1:30:28] say aren't you afraid of failing he says
[1:30:30] i'm never i'm always a failure so now
[1:30:32] you see my brother said yeah
[1:30:35] this is why i promise to say i'm always
[1:30:36] affair if i don't say what the lord says
[1:30:38] i'm going to fail yeah
[1:30:40] the only reason they'll say the lord
[1:30:41] fails is because i obey him i'm sorry
[1:30:43] the only reason i said the lord never
[1:30:45] fails is because i obey it
[1:30:47] but if i did it on my own i'd always be
[1:30:49] a failure yeah amen
[1:30:52] remember the other quote i'm nothing but
[1:30:53] he said that remember i'm nothing
[1:30:56] you forget anything about me i ain't
[1:30:58] saying that i'm not fit to live
[1:31:01] no
[1:31:02] church if we saw how many times we
[1:31:03] sinned in a year
[1:31:05] we would also say i'm not fit to live
[1:31:08] because i've said now church let's be
[1:31:10] honest that's just one sin a day yeah
[1:31:13] how many ever had a bad day
[1:31:17] how many you ever had a bad week
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:21] you didn't read your bible like you got
[1:31:22] to
[1:31:24] work kind like you ought to right you
[1:31:26] got a really mean spirit all week why
[1:31:28] not how many would you have thirteen
[1:31:31] thousand fifteen thousand twenty
[1:31:33] thousand
[1:31:34] yeah that's why brother brown says i am
[1:31:36] not fit to live
[1:31:38] i'm always a failure because i know the
[1:31:40] human side but also these are people
[1:31:41] that are born again but we've talked
[1:31:43] about that we're scoring again man sure
[1:31:46] the soul never sins
[1:31:48] but the mind and body do every day
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:53] no wonder the bible says god is abundant
[1:31:56] in mercies yeah thank you father jesus
[1:32:01] no no wonder the bible says he's long
[1:32:03] suffering yeah thank you lord
[1:32:07] thank you god that would be my best year
[1:32:09] if it was just that
[1:32:16] as you get older you have to battle
[1:32:17] pride and more and more as you get older
[1:32:19] right brother
[1:32:20] uh jose and brother ray you have to
[1:32:21] battle pride just get over it
[1:32:25] that's why a man that's good that's at
[1:32:27] that point was
[1:32:28] 54. he could say i'm not even fit to
[1:32:30] live
[1:32:31] i'm a fan i'm always a failure
[1:32:34] but god never fails amen that's true
[1:32:38] overcoming the sin of pride
[1:32:40] remember brother i was so humble they
[1:32:42] said brother man can you prove you're
[1:32:43] over there in heaven he said no i cannot
[1:32:45] prove it god could use me for a tool of
[1:32:47] something else and use you the same way
[1:32:49] see there it is god can take his hand
[1:32:51] off you
[1:32:52] oh lord
[1:33:05] but he said i believe by faith i'm saved
[1:33:07] not by knowledge i'm saved by faith
[1:33:09] that's the way you're saved that's the
[1:33:11] way we're all saved yeah amen let me see
[1:33:14] what i got here
[1:33:15] i'm close with this let's stand our feet
[1:33:18] church when we increase our humility you
[1:33:20] know i'm preaching so hard on pride so i
[1:33:22] can really get everyone to be humble and
[1:33:24] me too
[1:33:25] need to because we all need it
[1:33:29] the whole point of this is to say
[1:33:31] when we're humble we will serve others
[1:33:35] when more prideful we only serve
[1:33:37] ourselves that's true
[1:33:40] i'll say it again
[1:33:42] when we're prideful we only live for me
[1:33:46] right
[1:33:48] but when we're humble we live for other
[1:33:51] people that's right
[1:33:53] it's true
[1:33:55] true
[1:33:56] and did you know i'm sorry and let me
[1:33:58] remind you because i know i've preached
[1:33:59] this before
[1:34:01] the whole secret to christianity is
[1:34:04] increasing your service to god
[1:34:07] tells us that's the whole secret
[1:34:09] the church
[1:34:11] the whole secret is when the devil says
[1:34:13] slow down you're too tired
[1:34:18] earlier last night but i feel better
[1:34:19] sure
[1:34:20] i didn't quit coming to church just
[1:34:21] because i was tired yesterday
[1:34:23] i just made sure i got to bed early
[1:34:28] the whole secret is humbling yourself
[1:34:30] brother graham says and then as you get
[1:34:32] older
[1:34:34] not decreasing your service to god but
[1:34:36] humbling yourself and increasing your
[1:34:38] service towards god amen
[1:34:41] this is speaking spoken of authoritarian
[1:34:43] church age the darkest age
[1:34:46] bill abraham said in this age the
[1:34:47] darkest of all ages yet they say they
[1:34:49] would see the darkness of all ages well
[1:34:51] we'll talk about that last week
[1:34:53] the believers serve jesus even more
[1:34:56] right what a lesson that is there's no
[1:34:58] ceasing of this gracious service of love
[1:35:00] unto the lord but rather an increasing
[1:35:03] of it amen
[1:35:05] that is the secret
[1:35:07] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[1:35:09] servants for them that's all the devil
[1:35:11] wants is for you to stop serving other
[1:35:13] people and just live for you
[1:35:15] yeah that's all he wants that's right i
[1:35:17] can just get him living or get her just
[1:35:20] live for yourself that's all he wants
[1:35:21] i've got him now
[1:35:23] now the rest of the body's gonna suffer
[1:35:25] because i got him yeah
[1:35:28] he just wants one part of the body
[1:35:30] selfish broken down not connected to the
[1:35:32] rest of the part of the body
[1:35:34] that's just what satan wants i could get
[1:35:35] them focused on themselves but no
[1:35:38] brother man says the holy spirit will
[1:35:39] come in you know say devil you're going
[1:35:41] to try to cut down my service i'm going
[1:35:43] to increase it for the glory of god amen
[1:35:46] i'm going to find more ways
[1:35:48] we're going to say like this i'm going
[1:35:50] to find different ways to serve god and
[1:35:52] his people amen
[1:35:55] what is our reply to satan satan i'm
[1:35:57] going to increase my service to god and
[1:36:00] his people
[1:36:02] when the faints are crying in fear that
[1:36:04] is the time to shout the victory can we
[1:36:06] shout out a victory here by god
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:20] satan wants to weaken the church
[1:36:22] he wants to weaken the nations but
[1:36:24] you've got to increase your strength
[1:36:27] through humility
[1:36:28] through service to god
[1:36:30] i will serve god's
[1:36:32] i won't back up all my service to god
[1:36:34] i'll increase my services to god how
[1:36:36] many want to do that like amen amen
[1:36:41] we've got our family trials we got to
[1:36:42] battle our family lord jesus
[1:36:45] i don't like mine so much i'm sure you
[1:36:46] don't like yours either
[1:36:49] but we're more than conquerors through
[1:36:50] the blood of jesus christ
[1:36:52] where's the gospel it's saying
[1:36:55] brother sister forgive me i sin against
[1:36:57] you
[1:36:58] forgive me
[1:36:59] that's the power of the gospel
[1:37:01] the power of the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:03] to redeem us from
[1:37:05] let's pray together heavenly father i
[1:37:07] preached a long time
