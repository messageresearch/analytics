[31:17] [Music]
[31:26] [Music]
[31:48] [Music]
[31:52] I'm gonna do just a couple testimonies
[31:55] first the first ones wanna kind of
[31:58] almost feel silly sharing I thought well
[32:00] we should never feel silly about sharing
[32:02] a testimony we had had trouble with
[32:05] these mice in our house and had traps
[32:10] set and normally we catch them we
[32:12] thought we had plugged up the spots in
[32:13] the house where they were getting in
[32:15] well these were like I'd hear him in the
[32:16] kitchen behind the laws and then they
[32:19] were up in the drop ceiling above our
[32:22] bed and I was hearing a running around
[32:25] like doing laps in the ceiling one night
[32:28] it woke me up and I was getting nervous
[32:31] about it because I thought well it's
[32:32] winter and I can tell there's more than
[32:34] one and I was afraid that there would be
[32:36] mice babies and then it would be really
[32:38] hard to get rid of them and it just came
[32:40] to me like I hadn't prayed about it so I
[32:42] prayed about it just a couple days ago
[32:44] and in the middle of the night when I
[32:46] was thinking about it and I just lord
[32:49] please help us get rid of these mice
[32:50] because I don't want him in the house
[32:53] and multiplying when winter's coming and
[32:56] they don't want to go back outside and
[32:57] so I thought I would have to reset these
[33:00] traps and maybe put him up in the
[33:01] ceiling or do something like that and
[33:03] this morning I went down in the one room
[33:06] where we always catch them because it's
[33:07] all kind of open and they were both
[33:10] caught and I'm so happy because they
[33:14] weren't they had it been freshly set or
[33:16] anything and they've been sitting there
[33:18] for weeks like the whole time we kept
[33:19] hearing these up in the house and so I
[33:22] it hit me then like I prayed about that
[33:25] and so I wanted to give God thanks for
[33:27] it because I appreciate him in the
[33:29] little things you know even like that so
[33:32] I was so thankful and then I also wanted
[33:36] to share just how in October I really
[33:39] battled a lot of sickness and I had
[33:41] gotten sick to my stomach and then ended
[33:44] up all month any time I would eat I
[33:46] would have really severe stomach pains
[33:47] for like two or three hours afterwards
[33:50] and it wasn't really connected to
[33:52] anything I was eating but it would be so
[33:55] bad I'd be in bed like almost in tears
[33:56] and I really struggled with that for it
[33:59] to go on so long because I felt like you
[34:02] know Lord I have to
[34:03] care of my family you know Jesse's very
[34:06] busy with work and then all his things
[34:08] afterwards and I don't like relying on
[34:10] my children to run the home and so I'd
[34:13] struggle feeling like God why I believe
[34:16] he was a healer and I've seen you kill
[34:17] other people why am I going through this
[34:20] and I try to take care of myself and do
[34:23] the right things why am i struggling and
[34:25] in it just got to where I was starting
[34:28] to understand where I feel like God
[34:29] sometimes needs to bring us and I know
[34:32] myself like through these through those
[34:34] times where we don't hear him answer we
[34:37] don't see him answer right away because
[34:40] it's it's in those times where I need to
[34:42] learn to wait on the Lord and to be
[34:44] patient and just to let him do it in his
[34:47] time in season and and through that
[34:49] child to like I really felt the prayers
[34:52] of the saints and and just seeing how
[34:54] like the love that some of you showed me
[34:57] checking in on me and stuff like it
[34:58] meant so much to me and so I could see
[35:01] also how through my child God was using
[35:04] it for my good and and right now where
[35:07] I'm reading in the scriptures like I'm
[35:09] in Psalms right now
[35:10] and I'm reading through Psalms where
[35:12] where the psalm writer is struggling and
[35:16] there it's not tied up neatly at the end
[35:18] you know in some of those Psalms you're
[35:20] seeing the human emotion and I'm I'm now
[35:22] reading these and I feel like I relate
[35:24] to that like I just felt that last month
[35:27] and so I'm even thankful for that
[35:29] because it's made the Bible you know I
[35:31] can I can relate to that more now
[35:33] through that struggle so in all things
[35:36] God really does work it's for our
[35:38] benefit and so I just thank you again
[35:40] offer your prayers to as our family's
[35:44] been sick because it it is a trial
[35:50] you
[35:50] [Music]
[35:53] I love you Lord for your mercy never
[36:01] fails me all my days I've been held in
[36:09] your hand
