[26:48] God, we thank you for today, Lord God.
[26:49] This is another act of worship. Just
[26:52] like raising our hands, Lord, giving
[26:53] unto you is an act of worship. We're
[26:55] grateful for the food that we had on
[26:57] Christmas. Lord, we're thankful for the
[26:58] food we had every day. Lord God, you're
[27:00] so kind, gracious,
[27:03] compassionate. Lord, full of mercy. Lord
[27:05] God, full of grace. Father, we just want
[27:07] to express this worship with our tithes
[27:09] and offerings, Lord God. Thank you, God,
[27:11] that we can have a church here. Thank
[27:13] you for the faithful saints, Lord, who
[27:14] continue to give, that we can have this
[27:16] [music] place of worship, Lord God. We
[27:17] can invite people here, Lord God. We can
[27:19] have visitors. Our children can grow up
[27:21] hearing the word of God. All because,
[27:23] Lord, of your mercy and [music] love.
[27:24] Thank you, God, for all you provided.
[27:26] This is our expression of thanksgiving
[27:28] back to you, Lord God. We're thankful
[27:30] for all you've given us, Lord God. Thank
[27:32] you for another year of provision, Lord
[27:34] God. So I pray [music] Lord God receive
[27:36] our tithes and offerings. We just want
[27:38] to come and adore you. We just want to

[27:42] God and give you all the glory. Oh come

[30:11] Christ
[30:13] the Lord. Let's thank God today. Thank
[30:16] you Jesus. Thank you God. We want to
[30:18] adore you today with our clapping, with
[30:20] our singing, with our prayers. We
[30:22] worship you today, Lord God. We come to
[30:24] adore you for he alone
[30:30] is worth
[30:33] for he alone. [singing and music]
[30:36] You're the only one worthy of our
[30:38] worship.
[30:41] For he alone
[30:44] is worth
[30:47] the [singing] Christ
[30:52] the Lord. We'll give you all the glory.
[30:55] We'll give you all the glory.
[31:02] We'll give [music and singing] you all
[31:05] the glory.
[31:08] Jesus will [singing] give you. We love
[31:12] you Jesus.
[31:16] Christ
[31:20] the Lord.
[31:24] Father God, we'll give you all the
[31:25] [music] glory today. Lord God, we give
[31:27] it to you through your son. The Bible
[31:29] says we have access to [music] the
[31:30] father through the son. Great son of
[31:33] God, we come to you and worship you
[31:35] today. We pray you'd make intercession,
[31:37] son of God, to the father for our
[31:39] request that we prayed before the
[31:40] service. God, meet those needs. I pray
[31:42] in a special way, especially heal all
[31:44] those that are sick and afflicted.
[31:45] Brother Chris is sick today with the
[31:46] flu. Sister TR is sick. Tulsi's had a
[31:49] fever. Lord, touch their bodies. We ask
[31:51] by the power of the Holy Ghost in Jesus
[31:54] Christ's [music] name. We have
[31:55] confidence in your blood, confidence in
[31:57] the Holy Spirit today to touch their
[31:59] bodies, God. We'll give you thanks and
[32:02] praise. [music] Hallelujah. Bless our
[32:03] visitors again, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[32:06] Lord, anoint this word, Lord. God, I've
[32:07] done my part. So, I just pray, God, I
[32:09] know you'll do your part, Lord, and help
[32:11] each and every person to pull upon the
[32:13] word of God. Surely, God, you'll give us
[32:15] what we expect today. We expect to hear
[32:17] from heaven, Lord God. [music] So, let
[32:18] us hear from heaven today, God. And may
[32:20] you get all the glory, Lord Jesus. For
[32:22] you alone are worthy. And we come to
[32:25] adore you, Lord God, today. [music] We
[32:27] worship you, Jesus. Bless our service,
[32:29] our preaching, our singing in Jesus
[32:31] Christ's name. And the saints said,
[32:34] "Amen." Praise God. Let's take our
[32:35] Bibles here. Let's go to St. John. St.
[32:38] John, chapter 19. By God's grace, St.
[32:41] John 19.
[32:46] If I had a title this morning, I like to
[32:48] call it There Came forth Blood and
[32:50] Water. I like to look at the blood and
[32:51] water today. There came forth blood and
[32:54] water. John 19:31. If you have your
[32:56] Bibles, this is kind of like a part two
[32:59] to the sermon I preached in the cliff of
[33:01] the rock. If you remember that by God's
[33:03] grace, what a great uh lesson that was
[33:06] from the Bible, not from me, but from
[33:07] the Bible. Aren't you glad, church, that
[33:10] you are hidden in Christ. Just as Moses
[33:14] Moses was hid in that rock, so are you
[33:17] hidden in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Then
[33:19] as I was preaching, I got these numerous
[33:21] thoughts and I thought, well, there's
[33:23] going to be another sermon by the grace
[33:24] of the Lord. John chapter 19:31
[33:39] John 19:31.
[33:41] There came forth blood and water. 31.
[33:44] I'll read 31 and uh
[33:48] let's all read 34 and then I'll read uh
[33:52] what we'll just stop at 34. Yeah. So
[33:54] I'll read 31-33 and then we can all read
[33:56] 34 together.
[33:58] The Jews therefore because it was the
[34:00] preparation that the body should not
[34:02] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath
[34:04] day. For that Sabbath day was a and high
[34:07] day besought Pilate that their legs
[34:10] might be broken and that they might be
[34:12] taken away.
[34:14] Then came the soldiers and break the
[34:16] legs of the first and of the other which
[34:18] was crucified with him.
[34:22] But when they came to Jesus, they saw
[34:24] that he was dead already. They break not
[34:28] his legs. Let's read 34 on three. One,
[34:31] two, three. But one of the soldiers with
[34:34] a spear, pierced his side, and forth
[34:37] with came there out blood and water. May
[34:41] God add the blessing to the reading of
[34:42] his word. You can be seated. by the
[34:44] grace of God.
[34:50] I'll finish that section there. Verse
[34:52] 35. And he saw I'm sorry. And he that
[34:56] saw it bear record, and his record is
[34:58] true. And he knoweth that he saith true
[35:01] that ye might believe. Now, who's he
[35:03] talking about? John's talking about
[35:05] himself. John saw this. So, remember,
[35:08] all the other disciples had run like
[35:10] sheep. The Bible said, "If you smite the
[35:12] shepherd, the sheep will be scattered."
[35:14] So all the other uh apostles ran away
[35:16] except John. John was there. Hallelujah.
[35:20] And he witnessed this and he bare record
[35:23] that when the soldier put the spear in
[35:25] Jesus's side, there came forth blood and
[35:28] then water. This was important as we'll
[35:31] see through this sermon here by God's
[35:33] grace. Of course, if you're a Bible
[35:34] reader, you can probably already put it
[35:36] together here.
[35:38] He said in verse 35, "And he saw that it
[35:40] bear record." I'm sorry. And he that saw
[35:42] it bear record, and his record is true,
[35:44] and he knoweth that he saith true, that
[35:47] ye might believe. So God had witnesses
[35:50] there so you and I would believe. How
[35:52] many believe Jesus died for us? Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; How many believe Jesus Christ rose from
[35:56] the dead?
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are witnesses,
[35:58] eyewitnesses, that have their accounts
[36:01] recorded that you and I might believe.
[36:04] You say, "Well, I I I've never seen it."
[36:07] Well, Jesus said, "You're more blessed
[36:08] if you haven't seen it and you still
[36:10] believe." So, we want to be more blessed
[36:13] today. Hallelujah. Verse 36. For these
[36:17] things were done that the scripture
[36:18] might be fulfilled. A bone of him shall
[36:22] not be broken. So God allowed all this
[36:25] to fulfill the scripture that they
[36:26] wouldn't break his bones. So think of
[36:28] that. The two thieves on the side, the
[36:30] soldier came around with his spear
[36:31] perhaps and broke their legs. So then
[36:33] they couldn't even raise themselves up
[36:35] to get a breath. They just had to stay
[36:36] down and just we'd say drowned in their
[36:39] own water and blood, we'd say, because
[36:41] they couldn't get up to get any oxygen.
[36:44] But the Lord Jesus had already passed
[36:46] away. He'd already dismissed his spirit.
[36:50] Verse 37. And again, another scripture
[36:52] saith, they shall look on him whom they
[36:55] pierced. Amen. You can switch over. I
[36:57] have a few slides here. So this morning,
[36:58] we want to look at there came forth
[37:00] blood and water. And uh you know it was
[37:04] through this sermon that I've I fully
[37:06] unders now I can understand what brother
[37:08] Brandham said. I've always struggled
[37:10] with something brother Ram said about
[37:11] Adam uh and Eve and also uh the cross.
[37:15] And so through this message God helped
[37:17] me to understand it. So I hope the Holy
[37:20] Spirit can help me to relay it to you.
[37:22] How many want to understand the Bible
[37:23] better? Hallelujah. I do too. I I trust
[37:27] you do by God's grace. Amen.
[37:30] So I want to uh take these thoughts
[37:31] here. There came forth blood and water.
[37:34] We read our text here uh by God's grace.
[37:37] Now just remember a few Wednesdays ago I
[37:39] preached on in the cliffs of the rock.
[37:41] It's a beautiful uh type of what God
[37:45] does to us. We are like Moses, right?
[37:48] Moses was a murderer, right? Moses got
[37:50] angry. He named the people bunch of
[37:52] rebels, right? In other words, we know
[37:54] he was a sinful man.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; But yet he was a forgiven man. So Moses
[38:00] represents all of us and he said, "Show
[38:02] me your glory." And God did not show him
[38:04] the Red Sea parted again. God did not
[38:06] show him the pillar of fire again. God
[38:09] proclaimed his character to Moses. And
[38:12] he said, "I'm long-suffering."
[38:13] Hallelujah. I'm merciful. I'm a God of
[38:16] truth. Hallelujah. I bless each
[38:19] generation that will serve me.
[38:20] Hallelujah. And he he he also puts the
[38:24] iniquity from one generation to another
[38:26] if they won't repent. That was God's
[38:28] glory. That God is a gracious, gracious
[38:30] and merciful God. And that's the God we
[38:32] serve today. Hallelujah. We're thankful
[38:34] for God's glory. And Moses said, "Lord,
[38:37] I've seen all these miracles, but I want
[38:38] to see your glory." And so God showed
[38:40] him his character that God is a God of
[38:43] love. And so Moses is represented uh or
[38:46] he represents us. We were put in the
[38:48] rock and the Bible said that rock was
[38:51] Christ in 1 Corinthians chapter 10. So
[38:53] God hid Moses so he wouldn't die when
[38:56] God passed by. So there again, we get
[38:59] another look at the Passover lamb,
[39:01] right? Because death was going to pass
[39:03] over. But there's one thing that
[39:04] protected the the believers. That was
[39:06] the blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. Amen.
[39:09] So we see that picture again. When God
[39:12] passes by to destroy and to punish
[39:14] death, as long as we're in Christ, then
[39:17] we shall not die. We shall live. It's so
[39:20] important to be in Christ today. Not to
[39:23] be in high school or not to be in a
[39:25] school, right? Not to be in a club, not
[39:28] to just be a part of a a company. That's
[39:30] not necessarily what we want to be in.
[39:32] We want to be in Jesus Christ today by
[39:34] faith.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so the Bible said
[39:38] the rock was cleft. In other words, the
[39:41] rock was broken. The the rock was
[39:44] pierced. Hallelujah.
[39:46] And the rock was opened up. And so Moses
[39:49] was put in the cleft of the rock or the
[39:52] broken part of the rock. And that's you
[39:55] and I. Jesus's body was broken so that
[39:57] we could find healing inside Jesus's
[40:00] body. Hallelujah. Through Jesus, we are
[40:03] uh we are healed. So we're put into
[40:05] Christ. And so as Moses was hidden in
[40:07] Christ, we are hidden in Christ. So when
[40:10] God's spirit passes by, God's hand
[40:12] covers us. How many know God's hand
[40:14] covers your life today?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God covers you. You're covered by
[40:19] the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And then Moses at the very end, he got a
[40:23] glimpse of the backside of God. But the
[40:26] Bible says we don't get a glimpse. The
[40:27] Bible said we look in the very face of
[40:30] Jesus Christ today.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so beautiful. Amen. Through
[40:36] that wonderful message the Bible gives
[40:39] us, church, we see two other mentions of
[40:42] Jesus's side. Hallelujah. Because we
[40:45] know the rock the the cleft rock was a
[40:47] type of Jesus broken for us. Jesus was
[40:50] cleft rock of ages cleft for me.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Let me hide myself in thee.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; That great song. So remember Jesus was
[40:59] his his side was pierced or his side had
[41:01] a cleft in it as a testimony. So this is
[41:05] a testimony. Jesus was wounded for our
[41:08] transgressions. Hallelujah. And with his
[41:10] stripes we are healed.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:13] So we see the side of Jesus mentioned
[41:15] twice on the the cross. He was he was uh
[41:19] pierced the Bible said that's one
[41:21] mention and the other mention is
[41:23] beautiful after his resurrection and it
[41:26] was uh a week after his resurrection
[41:28] right because Thomas wasn't there on the
[41:30] night of his resurrection. So Jesus came
[41:33] back the next week. Aren't you glad
[41:34] Jesus keeps coming back to our services
[41:37] week after week after week? And the
[41:39] church said
[41:40] &gt;&gt; I'm glad about it. Amen. that God
[41:42] doesn't that you know God doesn't
[41:44] withhold his spirit, but his spirit
[41:46] keeps drawing us closer to him.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; He comes again. He comes the next year.
[41:50] I'm glad he didn't stop coming in 2019.
[41:52] Hallelujah. I'm glad he keeps coming.
[41:54] And he'll come again in 2026.
[41:56] Hallelujah.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; He'll come until every elect believer
[42:00] believes the word of God.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And I love this. He comes to Thomas to
[42:05] make sure Thomas believes. And church,
[42:08] he'll come to you. If you need to see a
[42:09] miracle, God will show you one.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If that's what you need,
[42:14] whatever you need, God will give the
[42:16] elect what they have need of.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Delight yourself in the Lord and God
[42:20] will give you the desire of your heart.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And I love what Jesus says. If you don't
[42:25] believe, he said, "Reach your hand in."
[42:28] He said, "Thrust it into my side." So,
[42:30] think about a man's hand. And that that
[42:32] wound was so big. He said, "Thrust your
[42:34] hand in." He didn't say, "Your finger,
[42:37] your hand. So, think about how big that
[42:39] Roman spear was, church. That Roman
[42:42] spear was so big. No, uh, if you've seen
[42:44] The Passion, that's one of the few
[42:46] movies I'd actually go see in the
[42:47] theater from Mel Gibson. Uh, you get the
[42:50] picture of it. You know, he just jams
[42:52] that that large spear and outpours of
[42:55] blood in the water. And Jesus said it
[42:57] was so big. Put your hand inside me so
[43:00] you'll believe. Hallelujah.
[43:04] And I'll close with that at the end. by
[43:06] God's grace. I didn't check the timer
[43:08] how long I'll preach, but I'm not really
[43:10] going to pay attention to time today.
[43:12] Now, church, you probably heard of this,
[43:13] but there's at least four conditions
[43:15] that this that that that that would have
[43:18] caused the blood and water to separate.
[43:20] There's at least four. I'm just going to
[43:21] look at one. I'll explain it by what I
[43:23] got from the internet. All right?
[43:24] Because I can't really explain it. I'm
[43:26] not a doctor. I just take what they tell
[43:28] me, right? All right. But there's at
[43:30] least four conditions that uh could have
[43:33] happened that cause blood and water to
[43:35] separate. One of them is called plural
[43:37] eusion. The other one's paricardial
[43:40] eusion and heop paricardium and
[43:43] post-mortem serum separation. So it's
[43:46] one of those. I just chose one of them.
[43:47] Okay? Because I don't I don't need to
[43:49] you don't need to know the science. You
[43:50] need to know the faith behind it.
[43:52] Hallelujah. You don't need the you don't
[43:54] need to know the natural causes. You
[43:56] need to know the spiritual effects of
[43:58] the blood and water. Hallelujah. You
[44:01] need to know what this produce. What did
[44:03] this give for you? What did it help you
[44:05] and I with? Oh, it helped a lot.
[44:06] Hallelujah.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, plural eusion is the
[44:12] accumulation of cirrus or cleary watery
[44:15] fluid in the plural cavity. Now, I might
[44:17] be pronouncing these wrong. Just forgive
[44:18] me. Again, I'm not a doctor. I'm not a
[44:20] nurse. And this is the cavity that's
[44:22] around the lungs.
[44:25] And this is caused from severe trauma,
[44:28] congestive heart failure, uh hip failure
[44:31] rather, hypo volmic shock, asphyxiation
[44:36] and crucifixion stress. All these can
[44:38] cause a flu up buildup in the chest. So
[44:41] the fluid gets built up. It's not
[44:42] supposed to be there, but because of all
[44:44] these conditions, it builds up. And if
[44:47] the spear pierced Jesus's chest wall or
[44:50] the plural cavity or the lung or the
[44:52] heart, then this uh this clear plural
[44:56] fluid or water could flow out first
[44:59] followed by the blood. Now I don't know
[45:02] if if the blood came first or the water,
[45:05] right? Because this is medical. The
[45:06] Bible said blood in verse uh verse 34.
[45:11] There came out blood and water. I don't
[45:13] know that the Bible's trying to put it
[45:14] in that order. I don't think it really
[45:16] matters. What matters is that water and
[45:18] blood came out for you and I.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; How many grateful that Jesus took your
[45:24] cross for you?
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; This is what you deserve. You and I
[45:27] deserved asphyxiation, not being able to
[45:30] breathe,
[45:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; You and I deserve severe trauma and
[45:34] congestive heart failure. That's what we
[45:35] deserve. But Jesus took it for us.
[45:37] Hallelujah.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And he's worthy of our praise today.
[45:40] Hallelujah.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all. All to him I owe.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Sin had left a crimson stain, but Jesus
[45:47] washed that stain white as snow.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Now remember the Bible said and and
[45:54] we'll read this later, but the Bible
[45:56] said in 1 John 5:6 that Jesus came by
[45:59] water and blood.
[46:01] Now this water and blood can refer to
[46:03] two things. It could refer to his birth
[46:06] because whenever a baby's born, the uh
[46:09] the water breaks first. I've seen nine
[46:11] of them. Hallelujah. And then then comes
[46:14] the blood. Hallelujah. Water and blood
[46:17] and then life. Water, blood, life.
[46:19] Hallelujah. Water, blood, spirit.
[46:23] Or uh it also could now no doubt this
[46:26] also refers to the cross of Jesus Christ
[46:29] because he gave up the ghost. So the
[46:31] spirit, you have the spirit and you have
[46:33] water and blood as well. So all three
[46:35] are present on the cross. Water, blood,
[46:38] spirit.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just so you're a student of
[46:43] the word of God, uh is this Jesus on the
[46:46] cross? Is this an allegory or is this
[46:48] typology? Because I want I always forget
[46:50] these and I need to rehearse them
[46:51] myself. Now, an allegory is told to
[46:54] reveal a hidden meaning. Uh so, it's an
[46:57] allegory. An allegory is not especially
[47:00] pointing to a future event, but a type
[47:03] is pointing to a future event. Everybody
[47:05] understand the difference? An allegory
[47:07] just reveals a meaning. There's meaning
[47:09] behind this story, but a type foretell a
[47:12] future event. All right. Now, if you got
[47:15] your Bible, go to Galatians 4:24. You'll
[47:17] see what I'm talking about.
[47:22] So, church, this is what this is what
[47:23] brother calls reading between the lines.
[47:26] Paul understood this. That's why he
[47:28] wrote Galatians 4:24. And we understand
[47:30] it as well. In other words, there's
[47:33] hidden meaning in stories, the Old
[47:35] Testament, church. They're not boring
[47:36] stories if you can see the allegory in
[47:38] them.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; They're not boring stories if we can see
[47:41] the types of the future in them.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Galatians 4:24. Sorry, I'm a little slow
[47:49] getting there.
[47:55] [clears throat]
[47:58] Now, let's actually go up a little bit
[47:59] to verse 22. For it is written that
[48:01] Abraham had two sons, by one a bond made
[48:04] and the other a free woman. But he who
[48:07] was of the bond woman, Ishmael, was born
[48:09] after the flesh. Abraham's carnal desire
[48:12] for Hagar.
[48:14] But he of the free woman was by promise.
[48:17] So Isaac came by a promise to Abraham
[48:20] and Sarah.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; But Ishmael came by Abraham's physical
[48:25] desire.
[48:26] All right. Verse 24. Which things are in
[48:29] what, church? and allegory.
[48:32] For these are the two covenants, the one
[48:35] from Mount Si, which generalth to
[48:37] bondage, which is Aar.
[48:40] For this Aar is Mount Si and Arabia, and
[48:42] answerth to Jerusalem, which now is and
[48:44] in bondage with her children. But
[48:46] Jerusalem, which is above, is free,
[48:48] which is the mother of us all. And the
[48:50] church said,
[48:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[48:52] &gt;&gt; So these two women and their children
[48:54] represent the Old Testament and the New
[48:57] Testament,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; right? The law kept you in bondage to
[49:01] sin. Right? Because if you break one,
[49:04] you're guilty of all.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Right? But in the New Testament, you
[49:08] break one, you're forgiven of all.
[49:10] Hallelujah. [laughter] Amen. Because
[49:12] Jesus paid it all. Hallelujah.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; See that?
[49:16] See, in the Old Testament came by the
[49:18] flesh,
[49:20] &gt;&gt; right? It was written on stony tables.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; But the New Testament comes by the
[49:25] promise of God to send Jesus. And now he
[49:28] writes the word on the fleshly tables of
[49:30] your heart.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; So that's an allegory. An allegory is a
[49:36] story that gives future meaning or
[49:39] there's a hidden meaning in there. Wow.
[49:41] Ishmael and Isaac represent Old
[49:44] Testament, New Testament.
[49:48] Hallelujah.
[49:50] Is that helped by God's grace, church?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Now, keep in mind, we're look at the
[49:54] blood and water has meaning as well.
[49:56] That's what I'm just showing this so you
[49:58] understand what the blood and water can
[49:59] mean to you today.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Church, I think it means more to us than
[50:03] what we imagine.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Now, a type foreshadows a specific
[50:10] historical event like Jonah was in the
[50:12] whale's belly like three days and three
[50:15] nights, right? That foreshadowed Jesus
[50:17] in the heart of the earth three days and
[50:20] three nights.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Jonah was a type
[50:26] Joseph being sold for 20 pieces of
[50:28] silver. That was a type of Jesus being
[50:31] sold for 30 pieces of silver.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now, can we see the difference?
[50:37] Hallelujah. We have allegorories. They
[50:39] just have a hidden meaning under them.
[50:42] But a type foretell a future event.
[50:47] Therefore, Jesus's water and blood
[50:50] pouring out is an allegory. And here's
[50:53] what I didn't understand. It's an
[50:54] allegory of the spiritual birth of the
[50:56] New Testament church.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; But there's also it's also Jesus pouring
[51:02] out the water and blood is also an
[51:04] anti-ype which is a fulfillment of the
[51:07] type. That's all that means. Anti-ype is
[51:10] a fulfilled
[51:11] type. In other words, the foreshadowed
[51:13] event has now happened.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the Bible says the spirit
[51:19] searches the deep things. Yay. The deep
[51:21] things of God. God wants us to go deeper
[51:23] in the word of God.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; So Jesus with water and blood pouring
[51:29] out of both or both pouring out of his
[51:31] body, that was both an allegory, but it
[51:34] was also an anti-ype
[51:37] of Eve being taken from Adam's side.
[51:40] Now, this is the one I really struggle
[51:42] with. I've struggled with this. I've
[51:43] been in the message what, 24 years, and
[51:45] I've always struggled. How does Adam How
[51:47] does Eve take it out of Adam's side? How
[51:50] is that uh a type of the cross? I never
[51:53] understood it till yesterday.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; So, I hope you can understand it, too.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Jose, how many times did
[52:00] brother Ram say that? You know, he you
[52:02] always talked about, we'll read a quote.
[52:04] He always talked about how uh God taking
[52:06] Eve out of Adam is like God taking the
[52:09] church out of Christ. And brother Jose
[52:12] for 24 years, I just scratched my head.
[52:14] I don't know. But today, I got the
[52:17] answer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it's
[52:19] so simple. The Bible interprets itself.
[52:22] The answer was already in the Bible. I
[52:23] just didn't see that scripture.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And so, church, this this proves if you
[52:27] don't understand something, set it on
[52:29] the spiritual shelf. God will bring it
[52:31] down at the time you need to understand
[52:33] it.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Don't try to interpret it. Don't try to
[52:36] make it don't try to make it make sense.
[52:38] Just leave it there and God will bring
[52:39] it down at the right time.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Just like God did with us with
[52:42] interracial marriage, ministers marriage
[52:45] requirements, right? All these things.
[52:47] uh uh the ministry of brother Brandham
[52:49] and the the uh the prophecies of brother
[52:52] Brandham because all these attacks have
[52:54] come on the message and all these
[52:55] questions just left them up on the shelf
[52:57] but then the right time god reveals them
[52:59] to us. Why? Because God is faithful. God
[53:01] is testing us. God wants us wants us to
[53:04] overcome the test. Believe in him and
[53:06] then God will reveal the answer in due
[53:08] season.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Church, you got to have a test to
[53:11] overcome.
[53:12] God does not call us to a flowery bed of
[53:15] ease while others fought to win the
[53:17] prize to to sail through bloody seas.
[53:20] But the Ram says we're not on a picnic.
[53:22] He says we're soldiers in an army. So
[53:24] we've got to we've got to wait on God.
[53:26] We've got to trust God. We've got to let
[53:28] God fight our battles.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; How many will do that today?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I'm battling this today." Or,
[53:34] "I'm going through a season of battling
[53:36] this, but God, I'm going to trust you. I
[53:38] trust in God, my savior. He's going to
[53:40] fight my battles." Amen. That's right.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He will put all enemies under your feet.
[53:45] Amen. He'll crush the head of the
[53:47] serpent. The Bible says that.
[53:48] Hallelujah.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; In the book of Romans, we looked at that
[53:50] on Wednesday night for the Christmas
[53:51] service. Yes,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; sir.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible said God will shortly, the God
[53:56] of peace will shortly bruise Satan under
[53:59] your feet.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; That's [crying] right.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; But God is teaching us how to fight
[54:03] Satan off. And the church said,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Church, say it out loud, what's the
[54:06] weapon God gave you to fight off Satan?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. Good Bible- based church
[54:11] here. Hallelujah. The sword. You got to
[54:14] SPEAK THE WORD. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THE
[54:15] WORD and and use the sword against Satan
[54:18] and he'll flee for a season.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Like Austin said, he was telling me
[54:22] yesterday, I'm speaking the I'm speaking
[54:24] life. I'm speaking life. I'm like,
[54:25] that's right, brother. You keep speaking
[54:26] life. Amen. Speak life. Speak the word.
[54:29] Satan can't stand the word of God.
[54:31] That's one thing he doesn't like is the
[54:32] word of God.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; So now we'll see this in Jesus. His
[54:38] water and blood was both an allegory and
[54:41] it was a type.
[54:44] Now, these are the best pictures I could
[54:45] find. These were the most uh holy
[54:47] pictures I could find. And so, we got
[54:49] Adam. Here's Adam sleeping, right? Eve's
[54:52] God's and God taking the rib and he
[54:54] pulls out Eve.
[54:56] All right. And then you got Jesus. Now,
[54:58] I don't know if the water and blood went
[55:00] like that. It depends how supernatural
[55:02] event. It could have it could have been
[55:03] like that or it could have been more
[55:04] natural where he just had, you know,
[55:06] blood come forth and then water
[55:07] afterwards.
[55:10] But now, can everybody see what I'm
[55:11] talking about? Brother Ram says this,
[55:13] this right here was a type for this.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Now, for years, 24 years, I'm like, I
[55:19] don't understand it. I don't get it. But
[55:23] now I understand it. So, I hope you'll
[55:24] catch it here as well by God's grace. I
[55:27] think that's St. John, right? when
[55:28] there's Mary the mother because he said,
[55:30] "Behold your mother." Hallelujah.
[55:34] Now, Adam's rib type Jesus's water and
[55:37] blood. So, Adam's rib and being poured
[55:40] out. In other words, type Jesus water
[55:42] and blood being poured out. So, God
[55:46] pulled out the rib, but Jesus water and
[55:48] blood was poured out.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; So, one's pulled, one's poured. But in
[55:53] both cases, something is coming out of
[55:55] the Adam and the last Adam. Hallelujah.
[55:58] Amen. But Jose, I'm about ready to
[56:00] shout. Okay. Brother Ram said he was he
[56:02] was preaching. I heard brother Ram say
[56:03] it this week. Brother Ram was waiting to
[56:04] get to his his big point, right? His
[56:06] climax. And he said, "I feel like David.
[56:08] I'm winding up that sling." [laughter]
[56:10] That's what I feel like today, brother
[56:12] Jose. I'm winding up that sling and
[56:13] we're going to let that stone loose and
[56:15] IT'S GOING TO STRIKE THE HEAD OF THE
[56:16] ENEMY. HALLELUJAH.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm hoping the church
[56:19] will receive it. It's so simple. I hope
[56:20] you will receive it. So, I feel like I'm
[56:22] winding up. Everybody ready for this
[56:23] stone to strike the enemy? [laughter]
[56:25] Hallelujah.
[56:28] Adam and the last Adam. Speaking of Adam
[56:30] and Jesus,
[56:33] Adam was a type of Jesus Christ because
[56:36] Adam was put to sleep. Now, let's read
[56:38] that. Genesis 2:21. Got your Bibles?
[56:40] Let's read that. Genesis 2:21.
[56:50] Now, we'll get to the verse that
[56:51] actually opened up the Revelation. It
[56:53] was John chapter 3. But don't turn there
[56:55] right now. John chapter 3. Actually, I
[56:58] felt church. I felt like this. I felt
[57:00] the veil came off my eyes when I read
[57:02] John chapter 3.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; So, we'll get to that in just a little
[57:04] bit. Ever feel like that? You got veil
[57:06] over your eyes. I just can't understand
[57:07] it. I just can't understand it. And then
[57:09] God takes the veil away.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; John 2, I'm sorry, Genesis 2:21. And the
[57:16] Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[57:18] Adam, and he slept. And he took one of
[57:21] his ribs, and closed up the flesh
[57:23] instead thereof. And the rib which the
[57:25] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[57:27] bride, I mean woman, and brought her
[57:29] unto the man. And the church said,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Hallelujah. That's right. Now,
[57:35] look, church, look at these three. We're
[57:36] going to see these three. Sleep was
[57:38] first, then the side was open, and then
[57:42] the bride was last.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Sleep, side, bride. That's a good rhyme
[57:46] there. Sleepside bride. Hallelujah.
[57:50] Now, we're not going to read these
[57:51] because we already read it. But Christ
[57:53] in John 19 was put to death or the Bible
[57:56] says death is only what? It's sleep,
[58:00] right? Paul told them in the
[58:02] Thessalonians, your loved ones are
[58:04] sleeping,
[58:05] right? It's called sleep. Now, their
[58:06] soul's not asleep. That's just another
[58:08] way to to show they're in a different
[58:10] place right now.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Right? When you sleep, you're in a
[58:13] different place. Brother Ram says,
[58:14] "You're in your conscience."
[58:16] And boy, I don't like some of those
[58:17] dreams I get in my conscience. Brother
[58:18] Vang.
[58:20] I don't like to go there sometimes, but
[58:22] I got to go there. Hallelujah. It's like
[58:24] you're in a different place. Hallelujah.
[58:27] So, when people pass away, the Bible
[58:29] calls it, it's like they're sleeping.
[58:31] They're still somewhere, just not there.
[58:34] So, with Jesus, he went to sleep in
[58:37] death and then his side was pierced. And
[58:41] then comes the bride. But the bride part
[58:43] always stumbled me. I couldn't
[58:45] understand that. How is water and blood
[58:48] a bride?
[58:50] All right.
[58:52] So now I put I put the labels on there.
[58:54] Sleepside bride. Sleep or death side.
[58:59] And this water and blood represents the
[59:02] bride being purchased.
[59:05] Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember, brother Brandham
[59:09] said, "God has to God has to redeem this
[59:12] earth the same way he redeems you."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:18] How did God How is God going to redeem
[59:20] the earth? He had to have the water of
[59:22] Noah's flood. That's the water, the
[59:25] blood of Jesus. So, here's the blood.
[59:28] And then the fire has to burn over the
[59:30] whole earth. And then God has redeemed
[59:32] us.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, the earth. And brother Ram
[59:35] said that's the same thing for you.
[59:36] Justification, you're baptized in water.
[59:39] Sanctified through the blood or the Holy
[59:41] Spirit. Sanctification and then the fire
[59:43] of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. See that?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Water, blood, spirit. Hallelujah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism
[59:53] of the Holy Ghost. Oh, I'm still I'm
[59:56] still getting that sling around here.
[59:57] [laughter]
[59:58] Hopefully, it'll strike by God's grace.
[1:00:00] Maybe this will be a silent striking. I
[1:00:02] thought it might make you shout. Amen.
[1:00:03] [laughter]
[1:00:04] Maybe to go to John chapter 3. I'll just
[1:00:06] read it now. Then you got it.
[1:00:10] John 3.
[1:00:19] I trust it'll bless you like it blessed
[1:00:20] me. Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Remember
[1:00:23] uh in verse John 3:3, Jesus answered
[1:00:25] unto him and saith, verily, verily I say
[1:00:27] unto thee, except a man be born again,
[1:00:29] he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[1:00:31] Nicodemus saith to him, "How can a man
[1:00:33] be born when he's old? Can he enter the
[1:00:36] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:00:38] be born?" Right? That's that's as
[1:00:41] spiritual as we could be without the
[1:00:42] Holy Ghost.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; What do you mean born again? I got to go
[1:00:45] inside my mom again. She's 75 years old
[1:00:47] to be born again. How is that going to
[1:00:49] work? But Jesus was always talking on a
[1:00:51] higher level than everybody else. Why?
[1:00:53] Because he came from God. He come down
[1:00:55] to earth. He went back to God.
[1:00:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; And then verse five, here's the one that
[1:01:00] church and open up with this verse. So
[1:01:01] here it's slinging now. Let me let me
[1:01:03] hit the hit the mark. Jesus answered,
[1:01:05] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except
[1:01:07] a man be born of water and of the
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; he cannot enter into the kingdom of
[1:01:12] God." Hallelujah. There it is. That
[1:01:15] which is born of the flesh is flesh,
[1:01:16] that which is born of the spirit is
[1:01:18] spirit. Marvel not that I say unto you,
[1:01:21] ye must be born again. Hallelujah. The
[1:01:24] wind bloweth where it list, and thou
[1:01:25] hearest the sound thereof, but can not
[1:01:27] tell when it cometh, and whence it go
[1:01:29] whether it goeth. So is everyone that is
[1:01:32] born of the spirit of God. And the
[1:01:34] church said,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; See, so Jesus says, "You've got to be
[1:01:38] born of the water and the spirit."
[1:01:41] Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so beautiful. So now we can see
[1:01:47] that this water and blood represents a
[1:01:50] baby being born
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; because a baby is born by water, blood,
[1:01:56] spirit. Ah, so see now I know a bride
[1:02:00] came out of Adam. So a bride must come
[1:02:03] out of the last. In other words, God
[1:02:04] symbolizing a birth is going to happen
[1:02:07] here.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got water, blood, spirit.
[1:02:10] There's got to be a birth somewhere.
[1:02:12] Hallelujah. Amen. And so it was in the
[1:02:15] spiritual realm. A birth was going to
[1:02:19] take place because there's water, blood,
[1:02:21] and Jesus dismissed his spirit.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] Here's where brother says it, church.
[1:02:32] Hallelujah.
[1:02:35] And to think just as sure as God raised
[1:02:38] Jesus out of the grave, sitting at his
[1:02:40] right hand tonight, making intercession
[1:02:41] upon our confessions, that same God has
[1:02:44] promised, he swore by this covenant. How
[1:02:46] many under the covenant of the blood of
[1:02:48] Christ?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That we that are in Christ Jesus, born
[1:02:52] into that body, shall come forth in that
[1:02:55] body to be his bride.
[1:02:58] So Jesus promised, "You will be my
[1:03:01] bride."
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Eve was the bride of
[1:03:04] Adam, we'll be the bride of the last
[1:03:07] Adam.
[1:03:08] Hallelujah. And as God taken from Adam a
[1:03:12] rib and made Eve out of it, he taken
[1:03:15] from the sight of Christ and made the
[1:03:17] church out of it. Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; So the water and blood was poured out
[1:03:22] upon the earth. Hallelujah. And how many
[1:03:24] know our bodies came from the earth?
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The Bible said from
[1:03:28] dust you came and dust you'll return.
[1:03:31] Uh-huh.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So, the water and blood spilled on the
[1:03:34] dust where the bride would come from.
[1:03:36] Your bodies would be made from that
[1:03:37] dust. And so, the water Amen. The
[1:03:40] water's been poured on your body. The
[1:03:42] blood's been poured on your body. Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God's going to redeem
[1:03:47] this body. And God's GOING TO GIVE YOU A
[1:03:49] GLORIFIED BODY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:03:53] And we together will walk in the
[1:03:55] paradise of God someday. How many want
[1:03:57] to do that?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] Brother Brandham says, "We'll walk with
[1:04:01] the lions and the lambs as well." The
[1:04:05] the he called it uh he called the the
[1:04:07] female lionist Sheba. He said, "We'll
[1:04:09] walk with the l the lions again and just
[1:04:12] kind of pat their back and rub them.
[1:04:14] We'll walk in the paradise of God."
[1:04:16] Church, it is not entered into man's
[1:04:19] eyes or or thoughts what God has
[1:04:21] prepared for them that love him.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, there's so many
[1:04:27] wonderful things coming. The thing to
[1:04:29] do, just stay in Christ.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Just make sure your life is hidden in
[1:04:35] Jesus Christ, brother Michelle.
[1:04:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Just make sure, SISTER
[1:04:40] ANNA, YOUR LIFE IS HIDDEN IN JESUS.
[1:04:42] HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, DON'T TRUST IN YOURSELF.
[1:04:45] DON'T TRUST IN WORKS. DON'T TRUST IN
[1:04:47] WHAT you can do. Trust in the blood and
[1:04:49] the water of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm doing today. Yeah. Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Won't that be wonderful, church? And you
[1:04:59] won't have stomach trouble there. He's
[1:05:00] actually in a prayer line. And you and
[1:05:02] you haven't got it anymore. Now go eat
[1:05:05] what you want. You had ulcers in the
[1:05:07] stomach and they're gone. Eat anything
[1:05:08] you want, mother. Your faith has made
[1:05:10] you well. Let's say praise the Lord.
[1:05:11] Let's say praise the Lord. Let's praise
[1:05:13] the Lord. Amen. So, brother Ram is
[1:05:15] discerning this woman, the prayer line.
[1:05:17] He uses Adam and Eve for Christ and the
[1:05:20] church. And then God heals the woman's
[1:05:22] sto stomach trouble. Praise God.
[1:05:28] Now let's look at the allegorories.
[1:05:31] Here's the allegory. And this was the
[1:05:33] verse that hit the giant's head where I
[1:05:35] couldn't understand this for so long.
[1:05:37] And that stone of revelation struck the
[1:05:40] uh it struck the giant that was in my
[1:05:42] life withholding this revelation we'd
[1:05:43] say, from me. Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Now, allegory, remember, allegory has a
[1:05:48] hidden meaning. So this is why brother
[1:05:51] Ram said what he said because water and
[1:05:54] blood represent a natural birth but
[1:05:56] Jesus shed the water and blood for a
[1:05:59] spiritual birth.
[1:06:02] This was the allegory. Hallelujah. The
[1:06:05] hidden meaning of water and blood is to
[1:06:07] show something's being born. A bride. A
[1:06:10] bride is being born out of the last
[1:06:12] Adam.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you
[1:06:16] Jesus. Except a man be born of water in
[1:06:18] the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom
[1:06:20] of God.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; What do you mean? What water are you
[1:06:23] talking about? He's talking about the
[1:06:24] water that came out of his body.
[1:06:27] Hallelujah. Now, you can also use water
[1:06:29] baptism. That's fine. It still fits,
[1:06:31] church.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; But the allegory here is that there was
[1:06:35] a greater meaning on the cross. water,
[1:06:38] blood, spirit, hallelujah,
[1:06:41] justification, sanctification, BAPTISM
[1:06:43] OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT PUTS YOU BACK IN
[1:06:46] THE BODY OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; OH, thank God. Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Now, go to Ephesians 5:25.
[1:07:02] Maybe I'll make a YouTube video about
[1:07:03] this just to share it. said. Now, maybe
[1:07:05] everybody else understood this before
[1:07:07] me. That's fine. But I'm glad God
[1:07:08] revealed it to me. Hallelujah.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; God speaking an allegory. There's a
[1:07:12] hidden meaning. The blood and water
[1:07:14] represented uh the spiritual birth. A
[1:07:18] birth is happening.
[1:07:20] Life is happening. Hallelujah.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And it spoke of the church being born
[1:07:26] again, the church being created. The
[1:07:29] church was birthed right there. Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't at church 50 days later. than
[1:07:33] the church actually received that new
[1:07:35] birth on the day of Pentecost.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; So church, this is why people would say
[1:07:43] we were born at the cross.
[1:07:47] That's why preachers will say uh you
[1:07:49] were born at the cross. The cross was
[1:07:51] your birthday. Amen.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Because that a birth took place.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; As Eve came out of Adam, the bride CAME
[1:08:01] OUT OF CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; A birth took place. Water, blood,
[1:08:05] spirit.
[1:08:07] The spiritual bride was born that day.
[1:08:11] Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I hope you can see it today.
[1:08:15] If not, go listen to this again tonight
[1:08:17] by God's grace. I think you'll catch it.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:08:24] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:08:26] for. The proof God loves you is that
[1:08:29] Jesus died for you. Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Well, show me some proof, brother Jeff.
[1:08:33] Show me some proof. Now, don't get angry
[1:08:35] with God. Look at the cross.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; The cross proves God loves each and
[1:08:39] every one of you.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus, his death. Look to his
[1:08:44] resurrection, his death, and the
[1:08:46] shedding of his blood. That a
[1:08:50] sorry, aphixiation. Hallelujah. The
[1:08:52] severe HEART TROUBLE THAT PROVED HE
[1:08:54] LOVED YOU. HE SUFFERED so you wouldn't
[1:08:56] have to suffer.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] Hallelujah.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; And see, you're either going to believe
[1:09:04] the devil or God. Let's believe God's
[1:09:06] word.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Either one of them's lying. Well, we
[1:09:09] know it ain't God. So, tell the devil,
[1:09:11] "Get behind me, Satan. I'm going to
[1:09:13] believe the word of God.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I was purchased at the cross. My new
[1:09:17] birth actually happened at the cross. I
[1:09:19] just learned about it 2,000 years
[1:09:21] later." Amen. Hallelujah. That's where
[1:09:23] God laid the foundation for the church
[1:09:25] to be born.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 26. that he might sanctify it and
[1:09:30] cleansing it with the washing of the
[1:09:32] what?
[1:09:34] Water. Water.
[1:09:37] Jesus sanctified and cleansed you with
[1:09:40] the water of the word.
[1:09:44] Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; The word, the water was like word. So
[1:09:48] when you hear the word today, and it
[1:09:50] told me, remember I had hair down here,
[1:09:52] brother Arley. I had hair down here when
[1:09:54] I heard the message. The word said a man
[1:09:56] shouldn't have long hair. So I cut it
[1:09:58] right there. I was washed by the word.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you sisters had paint all
[1:10:04] over your face. But then you heard, "Oh,
[1:10:06] painting is a heathen trait. It's of the
[1:10:07] devil. It's a Jezebel." And then you
[1:10:09] went and wiped the the paint off your
[1:10:11] face. You just got washed by the waters
[1:10:13] of the word. I hope a sister could say
[1:10:15] amen to that. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:10:18] That's the washing of the water. God's
[1:10:20] cleansing you. He's washing you to be
[1:10:23] what he WANTS YOU TO BE. HE WANTS YOU TO
[1:10:24] BE CLEAN.
[1:10:28] HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:35] Now, why does he wash you, church?
[1:10:36] Because there's going to come a
[1:10:38] presentation of the bride of Jesus
[1:10:40] Christ. Look at verse 27. That he might
[1:10:44] present it to himself a glorious church,
[1:10:46] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:10:49] thing, but that it should be holy and
[1:10:51] without blemish. Church, when the word
[1:10:54] washes you, you don't have any faults in
[1:10:58] God's sight.
[1:11:00] You don't have any sins. When Jesus
[1:11:02] takes his water and washes you, boy, I
[1:11:05] wish I would have brought a towel or
[1:11:07] something like that. A wet towel. Maybe
[1:11:08] next time I'll do that. I'll get a wet
[1:11:10] towel. I'll soak it right in front of
[1:11:11] you. And then maybe I'll bring up
[1:11:13] Malachi. Let's say he's got dirt on his
[1:11:14] hands. And I'll just wash it. Make sure
[1:11:17] it's all clean. I know he gets dirty
[1:11:20] hands at work. Those are pretty clean by
[1:11:21] God's grace. And then I could present.
[1:11:24] Now I can present it. Look, now it's
[1:11:25] clean. Well, that's what Jesus did to
[1:11:28] you.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You hear his word, you repent, you obey
[1:11:31] it, NOW YOU'RE CLEAN. YOU'RE NOT DIRTY,
[1:11:33] YOU'RE CLEAN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus washes something, Brother
[1:11:38] Patrick, it's going to be clean because
[1:11:39] Jesus doesn't do a halfway job.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't do a partial cleaning. He
[1:11:45] cleans you all the WAY TILL YOU'RE
[1:11:47] SPOTLESS, HOLY, AND THERE'S NO BLEMISH
[1:11:50] IN YOU.
[1:11:52] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[1:12:00] Now, these water and blood have certain
[1:12:04] jobs that they do, we'll say, or there's
[1:12:06] a purpose for blood. Blood is for
[1:12:08] atonement, which means to restore
[1:12:10] harmony or bring us back to one. Now,
[1:12:13] all you children, all you children know
[1:12:14] this, and you adults, too. If your child
[1:12:17] disobys you and they don't repent, what
[1:12:20] what is it? There's anger between you
[1:12:21] two, right? There's something. I can't
[1:12:23] believe my my daughter or my son did
[1:12:25] that. They need to repent of that. But
[1:12:27] as soon as they say they're sorry, what
[1:12:29] happens? Now I can forgive you. Now I
[1:12:31] can't trust you all the time, but you
[1:12:33] are forgiven. You said sorry.
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. Well, see, before when you
[1:12:38] when the when the child sinned, now
[1:12:41] there's there's not oneness. The harmony
[1:12:43] is broken. But as soon as they repent,
[1:12:45] now the harmony is restored.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Now we're one again. And the Bible said
[1:12:50] the blood was for your atonement. The
[1:12:54] blood restored harmony. So church, you
[1:12:57] should have harmony with God TODAY
[1:12:59] BECAUSE JESUS POURED OUT HIS BLOOD.
[1:13:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That brings you back into harmony. You
[1:13:05] don't have to worry. Well, God, do you
[1:13:07] care about me? Do you love me? Are you
[1:13:09] my friend? Of course, the blood brought
[1:13:12] atonement.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Look at the look at the Hebrew word here
[1:13:16] for atonement. You can look. This is as
[1:13:18] Exodus 3:10.
[1:13:21] Church, what did the blood of Jesus do
[1:13:23] for you? It covered your sins. It purged
[1:13:25] your sins. It brought harmony. It made
[1:13:29] reconciliation. Now you and your father
[1:13:31] are made up. Everything's right between
[1:13:33] you and your father.
[1:13:35] To cover over with pitch, to coat, to
[1:13:37] cover, to pacify. God's no longer angry
[1:13:40] with you.
[1:13:43] Propituate means to take wrath. Jesus
[1:13:46] took the wrath of God against you. God's
[1:13:48] not angry with you.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the blood did. The blood
[1:13:53] brought atonement. The blood brought
[1:13:56] reconciliation. The blood gave you
[1:13:58] harmony with God. You are a friend of
[1:14:00] God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus blood atoned for your sins.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what the word water uh no,
[1:14:11] I'm sorry, it's the word cleansing.
[1:14:13] Numbers 8:7 says the water cleanses you.
[1:14:16] So the word cleanse means to make you
[1:14:18] pure. You're pure in God's sight.
[1:14:22] It means you're clean morally. In other
[1:14:25] words, God knows you want to do what's
[1:14:27] right.
[1:14:29] Your desire is to do what's right. Now
[1:14:31] you got to fight against the flesh 247
[1:14:34] or maybe
[1:14:36] 16 out of 16 out of seven. 16 hours out
[1:14:40] of seven days a week when you're awake.
[1:14:43] But look what Jesus did. He made you
[1:14:45] clean morally. GOD LOOKS AT YOUR HEART.
[1:14:47] God sees your desires to serve him.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; God has purified you physically,
[1:14:54] ceremonial, ceremonially and morally.
[1:14:57] And the church said,
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; "Thank you for your amens."
[1:15:02] So church, the blood has atoned you. The
[1:15:05] water has washed you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; I was hoping people would leave here
[1:15:09] happy today by God's grace. Amen.
[1:15:11] Hallelujah. This is WHAT JESUS DID. JUST
[1:15:14] LIKE EVE. JUST like Eve was pulled out.
[1:15:17] When she pulled out, was she dirty when
[1:15:18] she was pulled out? No. She was perfect.
[1:15:21] SHE WAS CLEAN. SO ARE YOU WHEN YOU WERE
[1:15:23] PULLED OUT OF CHRIST? YOU'RE PERFECT AND
[1:15:25] CLEAN. You have the atonement. The blood
[1:15:27] and water has washed you and made you
[1:15:29] clean.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus said, "It is finished."
[1:15:37] Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] What does the word finish mean? It means
[1:15:42] to accomplish, fulfill, pay for. It is
[1:15:44] paid for. It is performed. Sin is
[1:15:47] expired. Amen.
[1:15:50] Hallelujah. To bring to a close, to
[1:15:53] finish, to end, pass, finish. Jesus says
[1:15:56] it is ended. The sin question is ended.
[1:15:59] The church is no longer guilty for our
[1:16:01] sins. Jesus paid it all. Jesus took our
[1:16:05] sins. Our sin question is settled.
[1:16:09] Look what it means when he said it's
[1:16:11] finished. It's performed. It's executed.
[1:16:13] It's complete. Your salvation is
[1:16:16] complete.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Your promise TO WALK IN PARADISE WITH
[1:16:21] GOD IS COMPLETE.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:16:29] Jesus carried out the commands of God.
[1:16:32] Hallelujah. He did just as he was
[1:16:34] commanded.
[1:16:36] He performed the last act which
[1:16:38] completed a process to accomplish and
[1:16:40] fulfill. Jesus was the lamb of God. And
[1:16:43] what did he do with your sins? What? The
[1:16:45] lamb of God who takes away what?
[1:16:48] All the sins. Let's say all the sins.
[1:16:49] Ready? All the sins of the world. Jesus
[1:16:52] finished it. THEY'RE ALL TAKEN AWAY. YOU
[1:16:54] ARE FORGIVEN. YOU'RE CLEAN. YOU'RE HOLY.
[1:16:57] YOU'RE WITHOUT BLEMISH.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is good to me. Praise God.
[1:17:02] Amen.
[1:17:04] It also means to pay for. It is
[1:17:06] finished. It is paid.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Christ has satisfied or pacified God's
[1:17:12] justice by dying for all the sins of the
[1:17:14] saints. These sins can never let's say
[1:17:16] never
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; be punished again since that would
[1:17:20] violate God's justice.
[1:17:23] God's law says punishment is paid then
[1:17:26] forgiveness occurs.
[1:17:28] God doesn't have to punish us for our
[1:17:30] sins because Jesus already paid for the
[1:17:33] punishment. Jesus was punished so we
[1:17:36] didn't have to be.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And I love this church. This opened up
[1:17:41] to me while I was studying, too.
[1:17:43] Hallelujah. NOT ONLY JESUS'S SIDE WASN'T
[1:17:46] the only thing that was opened up at the
[1:17:48] cross.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Now, let's let's stop a moment. Why was
[1:17:52] it opened up? So Jesus could pull so God
[1:17:55] could pull out a bride.
[1:17:58] So Jesus would open up. Jesus side was
[1:18:01] opened up so God could access the bride.
[1:18:05] ADAM'S SIDE WAS OPENED UP SO GOD could
[1:18:07] create a bride.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Get ready for this.
[1:18:12] Maybe this is the slingshot. Amen. Not
[1:18:14] only did God open up the Jesus side for
[1:18:16] that. Hallelujah. When Jesus SIDE WAS
[1:18:19] OPENED UP, God gave us access TO ETERNAL
[1:18:22] LIFE.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; BLOOD and water paid for our sins. NOW
[1:18:26] YOU CAN LIVE ETERNALLY.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Not only was Jesus opened up, Brother
[1:18:32] Andy, BUT THE VEIL WAS OPENED UP AND NOW
[1:18:35] YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO GOD'S PRESENCE.
[1:18:37] HALLELUJAH. AH, NOT ONLY WAS THE VEIL
[1:18:40] OPEN, ABRAHAM'S BOSOM WAS OPEN, WHICH
[1:18:43] GIVES US ACCESS TO HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:46] AND NOT ONLY WAS THAT OPEN, THE EARTH
[1:18:49] WAS OPEN. THAT GAVE THE SAINTS ACCESS TO
[1:18:52] JERUSALEM. HALLELUJAH. AND THE LAST
[1:18:54] THING WAS THE GRAVES WERE OPEN. THAT
[1:18:56] GAVE US ACCESS TO GLORIFIED BODIES CUZ
[1:18:59] THE GLORIFIED BODIES WALKED OUT OF THOSE
[1:19:02] GRAVES. That's right.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; "OH, AMEN." BROTHER JOSE, DID THAT HIT
[1:19:07] THE MARK? HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; OH MY CHURCH, EVERYTHING IS OPEN.
[1:19:11] HEAVEN'S OPEN. THE HOLY GHOST IS OPEN.
[1:19:14] YOUR FUTURE IS OPEN. ETERNAL LIFE IS
[1:19:16] OPEN. THE [screaming] DOOR'S NOT CLOSED.
[1:19:18] CHRIST IS THE OPEN DOOR.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL BECAUSE JESUS WAS OPEN ON THE
[1:19:26] CROSS AND THAT PURCHASED YOUR SPIRITUAL
[1:19:28] BIRTH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE PREACHING NOW, BROTHER
[1:19:31] CLAUDE. AMEN.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:19:37] The church was born at the cross.
[1:19:38] [screaming]
[1:19:40] Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] She was sanctified and cleansed with the
[1:19:44] washing of the water by brother Ram says
[1:19:46] by the creed.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; No, by the word.
[1:19:52] HALLELUJAH. NOT NOT THE AMISH CREED, NOT
[1:19:54] THE PENTECOSTAL CREED, not the creed of
[1:19:57] Jeffersonville or some other creed, BUT
[1:19:59] WE ARE WASHED by the water OF THE HOLY
[1:20:02] PROMISES OF GOD.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And church, this is so beautiful. In the
[1:20:09] millennium, this flowing out of God, of
[1:20:13] Jesus, the water and blood, it'll be
[1:20:15] symbolized.
[1:20:17] I'll say like this, it'll be an
[1:20:18] allegory.
[1:20:20] Hallelujah. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID
[1:20:23] EZEKIEL 47:1, let's read it.
[1:20:26] Remember, Brother says, "Any Bible
[1:20:28] student knows from Ezekiel 40 through 48
[1:20:32] is to the Jewish people during the
[1:20:34] millennium." I thought, "Well, I didn't
[1:20:36] know that till you told me, Brother
[1:20:37] Brandham. I much am not much of a Bible
[1:20:40] student, but I'm glad I got a Bible
[1:20:42] prophet."
[1:20:44] That's right. Amen.
[1:20:48] Ezekiel 47.
[1:20:51] Oh my. Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:58] So, also the water and blood flowing out
[1:21:00] was a symbol. Oh, there's another one in
[1:21:02] Genesis or Revelation 22. That's right.
[1:21:05] I missed that one. Afterward, he brought
[1:21:07] me again unto the door of the house. And
[1:21:09] behold, what issued out of the house?
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Water. And the church said,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; "So God's house during the millennium in
[1:21:17] Jerusalem, the Bible said a a mountain
[1:21:19] will raise up and then the millennial
[1:21:21] temple will be built on top of that. And
[1:21:23] Jesus will be the holy one sitting in
[1:21:26] that temple." Hallelujah. With the rod
[1:21:28] of iron, ruling nations for a thousand
[1:21:31] years. AND WHAT FLOWS OUT OF THAT
[1:21:32] TEMPLE? WATER.
[1:21:35] HALLELUJAH. Because cleansing flows out
[1:21:38] of the Savior. Because a birth came out
[1:21:40] of the Savior. A bride came OUT OF THE
[1:21:43] SAVIOR. IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE DID YOU
[1:21:44] COME FROM? YOU CAME FROM THE MIND OF
[1:21:46] CHRIST. AND THE WATER OF AND blood
[1:21:48] proves that the bride came out of Adam.
[1:21:51] You came out of the mind of Christ.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You were chosen in Christ before the
[1:21:56] foundation of the world. Just like the
[1:21:57] water and blood came out. Your promised
[1:22:00] birth was poured out as well.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my my. This is just mind-blowing.
[1:22:05] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] Behold, waters issued out from under the
[1:22:09] threshold of the house eastward. For the
[1:22:11] forefront of the house stood toward the
[1:22:13] east, and waters came down from the
[1:22:15] under
[1:22:17] from the right side of the house at the
[1:22:19] south side of the altar.
[1:22:22] So, brother Patrick, during the
[1:22:24] millennium, you and I will walk up
[1:22:26] around there. We got our glorified
[1:22:27] bodies. We'll walk around all day. We we
[1:22:30] give our orders. You know, we'll be
[1:22:32] ruling over cities. We'll give our
[1:22:33] orders. We'll take a break, brother
[1:22:35] Patrick. We'll walk by. Oh my. And then
[1:22:37] we'll walk by the the temple and we'll
[1:22:39] see the waters and say, "Oh, look,
[1:22:41] brother." You'll say, "Look, Brother
[1:22:43] Jesse, remember when you preached that?"
[1:22:44] The water and blood. Remember when you
[1:22:45] preached that, Brother Jesse? Here it
[1:22:47] is. This water represents when Jesus
[1:22:49] shed his blood and water on the cross.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; This represents a birth took place at
[1:22:55] the cross. This represents life only
[1:22:58] flows OUT OF THE SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And I'll say, "That's right, brother. I
[1:23:02] did preach that."
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:23:06] Oh, thank God. You remind me of that,
[1:23:07] Brother Patrick. Okay. When we get to
[1:23:08] the millennial,
[1:23:10] Hallelujah. Because I'll forget. No
[1:23:11] doubt about it. Now, go to Revelation
[1:23:13] 22. I just thought of this one. Glory.
[1:23:23] Yes. 22:1. And he showed me a pure river
[1:23:26] of water of life, clear as crystal,
[1:23:31] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[1:23:33] a lamb. And the church said, [laughter]
[1:23:36] "Thank you, Jesus." Amen. So on the
[1:23:39] cross, water and blood came out to show
[1:23:41] us and is going to show US THROUGH ALL
[1:23:43] ETERNITY THAT LIFE ONLY FLOWS OUT OF
[1:23:46] CHRIST, THE LAST ADAM. BUT YOU CAME OUT
[1:23:48] OF THE LAST ADAM AS WELL. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; The last Adam had to shed his water and
[1:23:54] blood so you could be born.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Life only comes out of the son of God.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It don't come out of a denomination. It
[1:24:03] don't come out of a preacher.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It don't come out of me. It comes out of
[1:24:07] God Almighty.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And who is God Almighty? Who's his
[1:24:11] image? Jesus Christ, his son. For he's
[1:24:14] the image of the invisible God.
[1:24:18] So if you got Jesus, you got it all.
[1:24:21] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. THANK GOD FOR JESUS
[1:24:24] CHRIST. HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; WELL, I just caught that one. I just Let
[1:24:29] me add that one real quick because I
[1:24:30] might preach that down in Junction City.
[1:24:32] Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] Let me add that in there.
[1:24:37] I feel like this is a sermon I could
[1:24:39] preach at other churches and they would
[1:24:40] enjoy it, too. Just like you're enjoying
[1:24:42] it,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. I'm almost done.
[1:24:44] Really? I'm almost done. It's hard to
[1:24:45] believe. How long have I have I been
[1:24:47] preaching? Just make everybody feel
[1:24:49] good. Has it been even an hour? Okay. I
[1:24:52] didn't think so. It didn't It just
[1:24:53] seemed like a long sermon to me by God's
[1:24:54] grace. I want to hear these testimonies.
[1:24:56] These brothers have some such beautiful
[1:24:58] testimonies of the grace of God.
[1:25:01] Now, now church, now that we see the
[1:25:03] cross, the water and blood, it brings
[1:25:06] atonement and cleansing. And the church
[1:25:08] said,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Blood makes you one with God again. It
[1:25:12] restores your relationship with God. The
[1:25:15] water washes away and makes you holy.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody see that?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now, through those, now we can better
[1:25:22] understand why we do the three
[1:25:24] ordinances.
[1:25:26] What are the three ordinance? Brother
[1:25:27] Ram said God left for the church. Water
[1:25:30] baptism, feet washing, and communion.
[1:25:34] Now in these three, we both see the
[1:25:37] water, blood, and spirit. Hallelujah. We
[1:25:41] see the water of course with water,
[1:25:42] baptism, feet washing,
[1:25:45] cleansing. Let's say cleansing. Ready?
[1:25:47] Cleansing. See, when you wash your
[1:25:49] brother's feet, it shows that God
[1:25:51] cleansed him. And when he washes your
[1:25:54] feet, God cleansed you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I'll say like this. He cleansed your
[1:25:58] very steps. When brother Vang walks in
[1:26:01] that factory every day, God has cleansed
[1:26:03] his steps so he can walk in there and be
[1:26:04] a witness and a testimony. All those job
[1:26:07] sites are on your farm, Brother Arley.
[1:26:08] When your feet get washed, it's a
[1:26:10] reminder God has cleansed. The footsteps
[1:26:12] of the righteous are order of the Lord.
[1:26:14] [laughter]
[1:26:15] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD KNEW YOUR STEPS.
[1:26:17] GOD KNOWS WHO YOU'RE GOING TO COME COME
[1:26:19] IN CONTACT WITH AND TRY TO GIVE eternal
[1:26:22] life.
[1:26:23] Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't know I was going to
[1:26:26] preach like this. Amen. And then the
[1:26:29] communion, the wine represents the blood
[1:26:31] because he said, "Drink my blood." But
[1:26:32] he didn't mean natural blood. He meant
[1:26:34] drink the Holy Spirit in.
[1:26:37] And of course, the bread. That's the
[1:26:39] broken body of our Lord. So even the
[1:26:42] broken body, there's the cleft of the
[1:26:43] rock. There it is. And the church said,
[1:26:45] "I just see it now. I didn't see that
[1:26:47] till it's the broken body." Yes. Let me
[1:26:49] add that too.
[1:26:56] Now, if more things break open, guess
[1:26:57] what? On Wednesday, you're going to hear
[1:26:58] a part two. Praise God. The water, the
[1:27:01] blood, there came forth water and blood.
[1:27:03] So, see, church, now we can see. We can
[1:27:06] see water, blood, and cleft in all these
[1:27:10] things that we do.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; So, church, I hope it means more to us
[1:27:14] now. May God help us. We're going to
[1:27:15] have communion. Remember, was it January
[1:27:16] 11th? In two Sundays, we're have
[1:27:18] communion. Maybe I'll if Lord help me,
[1:27:20] I'm going to bring this up. Maybe I'll
[1:27:21] preach preach that again by God's grace.
[1:27:24] Just to remind you all of all these
[1:27:26] things we do is to show that the water
[1:27:29] has made you clean and you don't have to
[1:27:31] worry about your sins. Just confess
[1:27:32] them.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And the blood has made you the friend of
[1:27:35] God where you can talk to God anytime.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Pray without what? Pray without ceasing.
[1:27:41] You talk to God anytime.
[1:27:45] Simon brought out a good verse.
[1:27:49] Um,
[1:27:50] let's let's hit that since I got it
[1:27:52] here.
[1:27:55] Uh, let's go to Proverbs where the
[1:27:56] righteous man fallth.
[1:28:01] I thought it was very inspired.
[1:28:13] Paul is seven times
[1:28:17] now. Can't find it.
[1:28:27] Can you help me find that righteous
[1:28:29] fall? Why is it not coming?
[1:28:37] Simon read you last week. I didn't write
[1:28:39] down the verse. Thank you for your
[1:28:40] patience here. There it is. Just It's
[1:28:42] not a righteous man. It's a just man.
[1:28:44] Sorry. Proverbs 24:16. Thank you for
[1:28:46] your patience, church.
[1:28:48] Proverbs 24:16, for a just man fallth
[1:28:51] how many times? What does seven
[1:28:53] represent? Completion.
[1:28:56] So you can have a complete failure. And
[1:28:58] the church said,
[1:29:00] you can completely fail and still be
[1:29:03] just. HOW CAN YOU BE JUST? BECAUSE JESUS
[1:29:05] PAID MY DEBT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not saved BY MY WORKS. I'M SAVED BY
[1:29:10] THE WATER and the blood and the spirit.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; AH, I HOPE somebody can say amen today.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A just man falls seven times
[1:29:20] and does he lay down and whine and cry
[1:29:23] about it? DOES HE GET DEPRESSED ABOUT
[1:29:25] IT?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You might for a season,
[1:29:29] but then you better get up.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Church, look at your neighbor and say,
[1:29:33] "I'm getting up. I'm getting up. I'm not
[1:29:37] going to lay down. I'm going to rise
[1:29:39] UP." YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE JESUS, MY
[1:29:41] SAVIOR, ROSE UP.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I WON'T STAY DOWN. I WON'T STAY
[1:29:45] DISCOURAGED. I WON'T SAY DEFEATED. THE
[1:29:48] WOMAN'S SEED HAS ALREADY DEFEATED.
[1:29:50] DEATH, HELL, AND THE SERPENT SEED.
[1:29:51] HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:29:57] The serpent seed's already been put
[1:29:59] under your feet by the water and the
[1:30:03] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; I love what Simon said. Uh it doesn't
[1:30:09] say how often he's fell. Do you fall
[1:30:11] seven times in a day,
[1:30:14] seven times in a year?
[1:30:16] Oh, mercy at least every day.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; We better trust in the mercy of God.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] But now let's go to I think it's the
[1:30:26] book of Luke.
[1:30:29] Yeah. Luke 17:4. I thought of that
[1:30:32] because remember
[1:30:35] Jesus asked Peter, "How many times
[1:30:36] should I forgive brother Mercy?" Seven
[1:30:38] times. Is that good, Lord? Seven enough?
[1:30:42] Jesus expanded it. Jesus brought out the
[1:30:44] spiritual multiplication. No, seven
[1:30:47] times 70.
[1:30:49] In other words, give your brothers a lot
[1:30:52] more grace than what you think they
[1:30:53] need.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you sin against
[1:30:56] God a lot.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. And church, uh, brother
[1:31:00] Claude, could you read that? It's
[1:31:01] Proverbs. No, I'm sorry. It's Luke 17
[1:31:08] 17 3 and 4. Did you have it, brother?
[1:31:10] It's okay if you don't. Luke 17 3 and 4.
[1:31:14] I thought you had it. My fault. Luke 17.
[1:31:18] He's a fast one. Good job. Can you read
[1:31:20] three and four?
[1:31:24] 17 3 and 4.
[1:31:37] Yep. 42. Thank you, brother.
[1:31:40] All
[1:31:52] right, give our blood two claps there.
[1:31:53] Great job. So, Simon, as I brought that
[1:31:56] out, uh, does that mean seven times in
[1:31:58] an hour? We don't know. But here we got
[1:32:01] scripture in Luke 17. If it's seven
[1:32:03] times in one day, forgive.
[1:32:06] So if you sin against God seven times in
[1:32:08] a day, say, "I know there's grace for me
[1:32:11] because Jesus asked me to forgive my
[1:32:13] brother seven times a day." And Jesus
[1:32:15] has way more forgiveness than what I
[1:32:16] have for my brother.
[1:32:19] And then Jesus, then you get the other
[1:32:20] verse, the other parallel passage WHERE
[1:32:22] HE SAYS 70 TIMES SEVEN.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; that's the blood of Jesus Christ that we
[1:32:30] we trust in. That's the grace of God
[1:32:33] that we trust in. Don't let the devil
[1:32:35] beat you up and say, "You've done too
[1:32:36] much. Bring out the 70 times seven."
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; There's no way, brother Arley, I sinned
[1:32:42] 490 times today against God. There's no
[1:32:44] way. Right? And Jesus said he'd forgive
[1:32:47] me if I did it. [laughter]
[1:32:49] AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE THE WATER AND BLOOD
[1:32:52] WAS PERFECT CLEANSING, PERFECT WASHING,
[1:32:55] PERFECT ATONEMENT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; SO, I thought I'd give a little extra
[1:33:00] revelation on that. You got at least
[1:33:02] seven times a sin against your brother.
[1:33:04] And now look at that. You can take and
[1:33:05] rebuke your brother, too. So I can say,
[1:33:07] "Shame on you, brother so and so. YOU
[1:33:08] SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT ABOUT ME, but
[1:33:10] I forgive you anyway."
[1:33:13] And the church said,
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; "You can rebuke them." I've only had one
[1:33:17] person ever ask for rebuking because
[1:33:18] they sinned against me. They uh gossiped
[1:33:20] about me and then called me that very
[1:33:21] day to tell me about it. And I said,
[1:33:23] "No, I'm not going to rebuke you. Just
[1:33:24] go tell the man you're that you uh
[1:33:26] should not have gossiped about me and
[1:33:27] said that about me." I don't know if he
[1:33:28] did, but there was only one time a
[1:33:30] brother asked me, "Go ahead and rebuke
[1:33:32] me." And I didn't do it because he was
[1:33:35] already rebuked by the Holy Ghost. The
[1:33:37] church said, "I don't want to make
[1:33:39] myself and say, well, let me get my
[1:33:40] righteous indignation. Yes, I'm going to
[1:33:42] rebuke you, you heathen, you devil
[1:33:43] worshiper, you Satan serpent sees, I
[1:33:45] wasn't EVEN GOING TO GET CLOSE TO THAT."
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has already rebuked you.
[1:33:50] Just go make it right. And don't lie.
[1:33:52] Don't Don't tattletail. Don't backbite
[1:33:55] people. Don't talk about them behind
[1:33:57] their backs, but I forgive you. And
[1:33:59] church, I did forgive.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now look through the
[1:34:03] scripture. You got seven chances to
[1:34:05] fall. At least seven in a day. And then
[1:34:08] Jesus multiplies that, you at least got
[1:34:10] 490.
[1:34:12] [laughter]
[1:34:13] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That makes me Well, let's just read the
[1:34:21] other one just so you got it. 70 times
[1:34:23] 7.
[1:34:28] All right. Matthew 18:22. Brother uh
[1:34:31] Patrick, would you get that for me?
[1:34:33] Matthew 18:22.
[1:34:36] I told these young brothers, I said, "I
[1:34:37] appreciate our young brothers. God might
[1:34:38] make you song leader someday. Uh
[1:34:41] trustees, deacons, God might call them
[1:34:44] to preach." So, I want them to know the
[1:34:46] word of God. Hallelujah. Right,
[1:34:48] Michelle? God might have a call on your
[1:34:51] life, brother. You just, the Bible says,
[1:34:53] wait upon the Lord.
[1:34:56] Then God will lead you. Wait on your
[1:34:58] ministering. Wait on your preaching.
[1:35:00] Wait on it. Wait till God opens it up to
[1:35:02] you. The Bible said a man's gift will
[1:35:03] make room to himself. I could sure use
[1:35:05] some help preaching. Hallelujah. I could
[1:35:07] sure use some help song leading.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah. But God will do it in God's
[1:35:12] time. Now, what I say, Matthew 18, uh,
[1:35:15] read 21 and 22. Uh, Brother Patrick.
[1:35:39] Amen.
[1:35:41] Let's give him two class. Great reading,
[1:35:43] brother. In one day, what? God will
[1:35:47] forgive me more than seven times. The
[1:35:48] complete number. Yes. 70 times seven.
[1:35:53] But church, the main thing is don't give
[1:35:55] up. Don't quit on God. Don't let the
[1:35:58] devil convince you that God's against
[1:35:59] you. God is for you. You came out of the
[1:36:02] mind of Christ. Hallelujah. You were
[1:36:05] pulled out of the bridegroom because
[1:36:07] you're the bride. Oh, thank God. Amen.
[1:36:11] Now,
[1:36:14] go to Hebrews 10.
[1:36:18] Brother Arley, can you read this for me?
[1:36:20] Hebrews 10, brother. Uh
[1:36:24] now, brother Arley, if you would, let's
[1:36:25] read uh
[1:36:30] read verse 10 for me, brother. Hebrews
[1:36:32] 10:10. Now, listen carefully to what
[1:36:34] brother Artley's going to read here. Go,
[1:36:35] brother, whenever you're ready.
[1:36:48] Let's say once for all. Ready? once for
[1:36:50] all.
[1:36:52] Wait, wait. Now, does Jesus have to go
[1:36:54] back and die again?
[1:36:56] To sanctify us. Remember what sanctify
[1:36:59] means? It means set apart. So, through
[1:37:01] one sacrifice on the cross, let me go
[1:37:04] back there. I don't see I don't know. I
[1:37:05] don't know if Naomi saw that picture. By
[1:37:07] one sacrifice on the cross, it
[1:37:10] sanctified you once for all. Not to the
[1:37:14] next revival,
[1:37:16] not to the next uh shouting and and and
[1:37:19] rejoicing and weeping and crying
[1:37:21] experience. Once and for all, you're set
[1:37:23] apart because Jesus shed the water and
[1:37:26] the blood.
[1:37:28] Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] Is that right?
[1:37:32] See, church, that's what we need to
[1:37:33] remember. Tell the devil, I'm I'm I'm
[1:37:36] sanctified once and for all.
[1:37:40] Even communion doesn't save you.
[1:37:43] Brother Ram said, "You're not saved by
[1:37:45] communion. You're saved by faith in the
[1:37:47] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; But communion does keep you clean." And
[1:37:51] the church said, "That's right. It keeps
[1:37:53] you clean
[1:37:55] in your daily walk." But in heaven, all
[1:37:58] your sins are paid for. Amen. And you
[1:38:01] just realize now, just think of this. I
[1:38:02] just realized this week that this was
[1:38:04] speaking of my birth because water and
[1:38:07] blood came out. Now I can be born of God
[1:38:09] as well. Hallelujah. Just as a bride
[1:38:11] came out of the first Adam, a bride, a
[1:38:14] birth had to happen out of the last
[1:38:16] Adam.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Now say in Hebrews 10, I'm gonna read
[1:38:20] there from brother Arly.
[1:38:25] Let's all read verse 14. Everybody got
[1:38:27] your Bible? Hebrews 10:14. If you got
[1:38:29] it, let's read it. If not, no problem.
[1:38:30] One, two, three. For by one offering he
[1:38:34] hath perfected forever them that are
[1:38:37] sanctified. How long are you set apart
[1:38:39] for? Forever. Let's say forever. Ready?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Not to the next revival.
[1:38:46] No. No. Forever. Brother Andy. Forever.
[1:38:48] Brother. That's quite a word. When God
[1:38:50] says forever, that actually means
[1:38:52] eternal.
[1:38:53] Jo Jonah said, "I was forever in the
[1:38:55] whale." Whenever. But that's speak
[1:38:57] That's not speaking of God. That's
[1:38:58] speaking of an experience. So that
[1:39:00] forever doesn't mean forever like
[1:39:02] eternally. But when you talk about God
[1:39:04] forever, that's eternal.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I am set apart for God
[1:39:09] eternally. Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; BY ONE SACRIFICE BY ONE ACT ON THE
[1:39:14] CROSS. IT IS FINISHED. GOD GOD HAS
[1:39:16] FINISHED THE CASE for Jesse Smith and
[1:39:18] Bride OF CHRIST FELLOWSHIP. THE BLOOD
[1:39:20] HAS been been shed. The water's BEEN
[1:39:23] SHED. THE ATONEMENT IS FINISHED.
[1:39:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO MAN CAN TAKE ME AWAY.
[1:39:28] NOBODY PUT ME IN THE CHURCH. NOBODY CAN
[1:39:30] TAKE ME OUT OF THE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; JESUS PUT ME IN HIM. [screaming] IT IS
[1:39:34] MINE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:39:36] SO WHO CAN TAKE ME OUT? NOBODY CAN TAKE
[1:39:39] ME OUT.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; You can't me put You can't put me out of
[1:39:42] the message. You can't put me out of
[1:39:44] Christianity. You can't put me out of
[1:39:45] the rapture. If Jesus PUT ME IN, NOBODY
[1:39:48] CAN TAKE ME OUT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Because that's where I CAME FROM. I CAME
[1:39:52] from the raptured one, Jesus Christ.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Ah, verse 17. And their sins and
[1:40:01] iniquities will I remember every Sunday.
[1:40:03] Is that what he said? No. I put the
[1:40:05] wrong thing in there so you would get
[1:40:08] the point. I'm trying to make a point.
[1:40:10] Brother Random said, "I'm being a little
[1:40:12] rational, but I'm trying to make a
[1:40:13] point.
[1:40:15] I'm being a little rational." Sometimes
[1:40:17] we think say or God's mad at us every
[1:40:19] Sunday. The Bible says their sins and
[1:40:22] iniquities I won't remember no more. No
[1:40:28] more will he remember our sins.
[1:40:29] Hallelujah.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. or your iniquities.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Just confess them TO GOD. KEEP WALKING
[1:40:36] WITH GOD. HE'S your father.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You're his son. You're his daughter.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He purchased you. He birthed you. Praise
[1:40:43] God. YOU'RE A PART OF CHRIST. YOU'RE
[1:40:45] FOREVER IN THE ROCK OF AGES.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Not going to have much voice left for
[1:40:49] the evening. Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Ah. Oh. So now verse 19. Now we can have
[1:40:56] boldness to enter into the holiest
[1:41:01] by the
[1:41:03] blood. Oh, by the blood. So this
[1:41:07] represented your birth and also this
[1:41:09] represents the blood that you go with
[1:41:12] before God in prayer. That means God
[1:41:15] hears my prayer. Let's say God hears my
[1:41:16] prayer. Ready? God hears. Patrick, I
[1:41:19] love how you're smiling, buddy. This is
[1:41:21] make this is encouraging me, buddy. If
[1:41:23] he could catch it, you're 17, brother.
[1:41:26] If this can put a smile on a 17 year
[1:41:27] old's face, WHAT CAN IT DO TO A 45 YEAR
[1:41:30] OLD MAN LIKE MYSELF? HALLELUJAH. OH, TO
[1:41:33] MAKE ME SHOUT, MAKE ME REJOICE THAT I
[1:41:35] WAS IN CHRIST. I CAME OUT OF CHRIST, AND
[1:41:37] I'LL GO BACK TO CHRIST.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; And the BLOOD THAT HE SHED SHOWED I'D BE
[1:41:42] BORN, I'd have atonement with Jesus
[1:41:44] Christ, and that THAT MY PRAYERS CAN GO
[1:41:47] TO HIM IN HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The sins I used to do, I do them
[1:41:56] no more.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; The blood has cleansed me. The waters
[1:42:02] washed me. Hallelujah. And I am the
[1:42:05] friend of God.
[1:42:08] [laughter]
[1:42:09] Thank you, Jesus. Oh my. I was preached
[1:42:12] longer than I thought.
[1:42:16] Now, we only have three physical divine
[1:42:18] orders left. One of them is communion,
[1:42:20] feet, washing, water, baptism. That's
[1:42:22] the only three things. That's the
[1:42:25] perfection of the three. See?
[1:42:29] So this is perfection.
[1:42:32] Water baptism, feet, wash, and
[1:42:33] communion. That's perfection because
[1:42:34] you've got the water, the blood, the
[1:42:37] spirit.
[1:42:39] Hallelujah. And you've got the cleft
[1:42:42] side of Jesus Christ. The bread was
[1:42:43] broken. The broke. Next time I I I break
[1:42:47] that, I'll think of that. He was cle for
[1:42:49] me. He was broken like the rock was
[1:42:52] broken so that the believer can get in
[1:42:54] and hide in Jesus Christ.
[1:42:58] That was the perfection of the church.
[1:43:01] We realize that. Yes, we do. Brother,
[1:43:02] now I realize that after 24 years. Now I
[1:43:05] realize
[1:43:07] why brother said God had to get a bride
[1:43:10] at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I
[1:43:12] never understood it till yesterday.
[1:43:15] That's the only three orders we have
[1:43:16] left. We realize that was the issue
[1:43:19] given by St. Paul in the New Testament.
[1:43:22] So friends, check this out. Now I could
[1:43:24] do this through the entire Bible. Almost
[1:43:26] every Old Testament victory story has
[1:43:28] water and blood in it.
[1:43:31] Think of even Noah. What came? Water,
[1:43:34] right? And then the blood they as soon
[1:43:36] as he got out killed all those animals.
[1:43:38] Almost every story speaks of water,
[1:43:41] blood, spirit, justification,
[1:43:44] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:46] Ghost.
[1:43:49] But what happened in the Exodus? First,
[1:43:50] the blood was shed, right? The hissup
[1:43:52] was dipped in the blood, put over the
[1:43:54] the three parts of the door there, the
[1:43:58] door and the lentil. So, you have blood
[1:44:01] and God brought them through the Red Sea
[1:44:04] symbolized water. And then, church, they
[1:44:07] were free.
[1:44:09] And then God, what does God do? God
[1:44:11] said, "Build me a sanctuary so that I
[1:44:13] can dwell them. Give me a temple because
[1:44:16] I want to dwell amongst them."
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit dwelling with the
[1:44:21] people.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; "Church, you're free this morning if
[1:44:26] you'll accept it." Hallelujah.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus blood was our Passover lamb.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Jesus commands every one
[1:44:33] of you to be baptized in the water of
[1:44:36] the water baptism and you shall receive
[1:44:39] the promise of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; But look, they were already free after
[1:44:43] the water baptism. So you might say,
[1:44:45] "Well, I don't have the baptism of THE
[1:44:46] HOLY GHOST." YOU'RE ALREADY FREE.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; You're not a slave IN EGYPT ANYMORE.
[1:44:52] YOU'RE SET FREE.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Ghost, Paul said, God
[1:44:57] has made your body as a temple for the
[1:45:00] Holy Ghost. Know you not that your body
[1:45:02] is a temple of the Holy Ghost?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Then Paul said, "It's Christ in you.
[1:45:06] You're the temple. You're the
[1:45:08] tabernacle.
[1:45:10] You're God's house he wants TO LIVE IN.
[1:45:11] NOW IT'S CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of
[1:45:13] glory."
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You are free in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Keep saying that.
[1:45:31] You want to hear a long sermon? Go
[1:45:32] listen to spoken word original seed
[1:45:34] there. I haven't preached half that.
[1:45:37] Now, now church, we can understand this.
[1:45:39] This is he that came by water and blood.
[1:45:42] Even Jesus Christ. Now look at this. Not
[1:45:45] water only. He just didn't cleanse you,
[1:45:48] church. But the blood brought you
[1:45:50] atonement.
[1:45:53] You're just not You're more than just
[1:45:55] clean. So you can be clean but not have
[1:45:59] the relationship with God.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But John says you've got the water and
[1:46:04] the blood.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And he says it's the spirit that bears
[1:46:08] witness because the spirit is truth.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; For there there are three that bear
[1:46:14] record in heaven. The father, the word,
[1:46:17] and the holy ghost. These three are one.
[1:46:19] These uh trinitarians I've talked to the
[1:46:21] last year, they're like, "Doesn't that
[1:46:23] verse struggle you?" I'm like, "Not a
[1:46:24] bit." It doesn't say these three persons
[1:46:27] are one.
[1:46:29] It just says these three are one. And if
[1:46:31] you look closely, they're all spiritual.
[1:46:35] Right? Father is a spirit. Holy Ghost is
[1:46:38] a spirit. It don't say son. It says
[1:46:40] word.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; So those three spiritual attributes of
[1:46:47] God, those three manifestations of God,
[1:46:49] they're actually one.
[1:46:52] Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] It doesn't say the old man father and
[1:46:56] the young man's son and the third person
[1:46:58] dove are three
[1:47:00] are three persons. It don't say that.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; don't let those liars add to the Bible.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Now some of them are purposely lying
[1:47:08] because they're anointed by devils and
[1:47:10] the antichrist spirit. Some of them just
[1:47:11] some of them are just ignorantly lying
[1:47:13] and they'll repent of it eventually.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Any true child of God will repent for
[1:47:17] lying about God's word and adding to the
[1:47:19] word of God.
[1:47:23] I know that's rough, but that's the
[1:47:24] truth. That's true. Because Satan wants
[1:47:27] to get in there, remember? And he wants
[1:47:28] to create three different gods.
[1:47:31] And now the Christians become
[1:47:33] polytheists,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; worshiping three gods. Which one do I
[1:47:37] pray to? I don't know. I've had friends
[1:47:38] tell me that over the years, I don't
[1:47:39] know which one to pray to. Oh, there's
[1:47:41] only one to pray to. Hallelujah.
[1:47:44] God's only one person. Hallelujah. You
[1:47:46] don't got to divide your time in thirds.
[1:47:48] Well, I'll do 10 minutes for the father,
[1:47:49] 10 minutes for the son, 10 minutes for
[1:47:51] the holy ghost, then I'm good. Oh, then
[1:47:54] 10 minutes to marry, too.
[1:47:56] You blind hypocrite. Adding to the word
[1:47:58] of God. This actually makes our case for
[1:48:01] God as one person.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't hurt our case. It helps us.
[1:48:05] That's why I love it. Now, there are
[1:48:08] three that bear witness in the earth.
[1:48:10] The spirit, the water, and the blood.
[1:48:12] And these three agree. Notice it doesn't
[1:48:15] say they are one. Brother says they
[1:48:17] agree in one
[1:48:19] because all three have a different work,
[1:48:22] don't they?
[1:48:24] What does the water do? It cleans you
[1:48:25] out. What does the blood blood do? The
[1:48:28] blood gives you reconciliation or gives
[1:48:29] you harmony with God, friendship with
[1:48:31] God. And what does the spirit do? The
[1:48:33] spirit fills you. Fills your soul.
[1:48:38] Is this helping today?
[1:48:40] For if we receive the w and remember
[1:48:42] who's the one that wrote this? John was
[1:48:44] the one. He saw the water and blood come
[1:48:46] down. And that's why he says verse nine,
[1:48:48] if we receive the witness of men, the
[1:48:50] witness of God is greater.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you believe me about
[1:48:54] the water, blood, spirit, then surely
[1:48:56] you believe God about the father, the
[1:48:58] word, and the holy ghost.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; For this is the witness of God which he
[1:49:04] hath testified of his son. This is God's
[1:49:07] witness.
[1:49:09] Water, blood, spirit, father, word, holy
[1:49:13] ghost.
[1:49:15] And brother Rand placed all three of
[1:49:16] these at Jesus crucifixion.
[1:49:20] Jesus's death was God's witness of his
[1:49:23] son's redemption for you and I.
[1:49:28] Let's skip down here. He talks about
[1:49:30] John
[1:49:32] John 1 John 5:7. There's three that bear
[1:49:34] record in the earth, which is water,
[1:49:36] blood, spirit. That's the three elements
[1:49:37] that came from the body of Christ. They
[1:49:39] pierced his side. Water came out, blood
[1:49:41] came out, and then into my hands I
[1:49:43] commend my
[1:49:45] There you are. That's the three
[1:49:47] elements. These three are not one, but
[1:49:51] they agree in one. And the church said,
[1:49:54] "God is one spirit, but the water,
[1:49:56] blood, spirit are not the same. There
[1:49:58] are three different elements that are
[1:49:59] required to save the bride of Jesus
[1:50:01] Christ."
[1:50:03] [laughter]
[1:50:03] Oh my. Hallelujah. We're saved once and
[1:50:07] for all. Praise God. You are forever
[1:50:09] perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I better close here. I'm
[1:50:18] uh this is my last this is my last
[1:50:19] slide. Let's stand. Musicians can come.
[1:50:21] Well, she's not okay. Victoria was sick,
[1:50:23] church. I forgot to say her. That's why
[1:50:24] uh she's not here. She was sick. Uh
[1:50:26] she's feeling better today, but we
[1:50:27] didn't want to take any chances.
[1:50:30] Now, with your Bible, my last verse,
[1:50:31] Colossians 3, verse one. If you have
[1:50:33] your Bibles, Colossians 3, verse one.
[1:50:36] You've been a very patient audience here
[1:50:38] by God's grace. I should say patient
[1:50:40] bride.
[1:50:45] Now, was this was this sermon a help by
[1:50:47] God's grace? It really helped me,
[1:50:49] brother Jose, for 24 years. I haven't
[1:50:51] understood. Brother B said, "God pulled
[1:50:53] out a bride out of Christ just like God
[1:50:55] pulled a bride out of Adam." And I'm
[1:50:57] like, "What, brother Vang? What? What
[1:51:00] does he mean, brother? Mercy, I don't
[1:51:01] get that." And then John 3 opened up.
[1:51:04] You got to be born of the water and the
[1:51:07] spirit.
[1:51:09] Jesus was shedding his blood and water
[1:51:11] in order to redeem this earth. That way
[1:51:14] the bride can have a spiritual birth.
[1:51:18] Oh my, it's beautiful. The word of God,
[1:51:21] the word of God is forever settled in
[1:51:23] heaven.
[1:51:26] Colossians
[1:51:28] 3 verse one.
[1:51:30] So here's my recommen recommendation to
[1:51:32] you for this Christmas and New Year
[1:51:34] season.
[1:51:38] I need it. You need it. I'd say we all
[1:51:40] need it.
[1:51:41] If then you be risen with Christ. How
[1:51:43] many are risen spiritually? I'm a new
[1:51:46] creation. My old man is dead. The old
[1:51:47] Jesse Smith is dead. I'm a new creature
[1:51:49] in Christ. I know it. I know I'm dead.
[1:51:53] Hallelujah. I'm raised with Christ. If
[1:51:56] you are raised up, then do this. Seek
[1:52:00] those things which are above,
[1:52:04] where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[1:52:06] God. Other words, seek God's mind. Lord,
[1:52:08] what do you want me to do?
[1:52:13] Set your affection. That's your love.
[1:52:15] Make heaven the thing you love the most.
[1:52:17] The throne of God, the angels of God,
[1:52:20] the cherubam saying, "Holy, holy, holy.
[1:52:23] Set your love or affection on things
[1:52:25] above, not on things of the earth.
[1:52:29] Saints, we can't love our smartphones.
[1:52:31] In other words, and I'll say this, we
[1:52:32] can't even love our children more than
[1:52:34] we love God much as I love my children.
[1:52:36] Can't love our husbands, our wives, our
[1:52:39] cars, our jobs. We can't love anything
[1:52:41] more than we love God Almighty.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Set your affection on things above,
[1:52:48] not on things of the earth.
[1:52:50] Verse three, for you are dead and your
[1:52:55] life is hid with Christ in God.
[1:53:00] Hallelujah.
[1:53:02] Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] Where's my life? My life is in God. My
[1:53:06] future is in God. It's in Christ. And
[1:53:09] like Moses in the rock, but that rock is
[1:53:11] part of God, too. Christ is God's image.
[1:53:17] When Christ who is our life shall
[1:53:19] appear. Then ye also appear with him in
[1:53:22] glory.
[1:53:24] When Jesus comes back, I'll come back
[1:53:27] because I was in Jesus before the
[1:53:29] foundation of the world. And I'll say
[1:53:31] like this. I spent my life, Sister Anna,
[1:53:33] I spent my life believing that I was in
[1:53:35] Christ.
[1:53:37] I tried to serve Christ, get all my
[1:53:39] sins, Sister Beatric, I I tried to get
[1:53:41] all my sins under the blood of Jesus
[1:53:42] Christ every day. And I tried to live in
[1:53:44] Christ. Therefore, when he appears, I'll
[1:53:46] appear with him because I tried to hide
[1:53:49] myself in Christ. Hallelujah. And so
[1:53:52] then doubting Thomas, right? I told you
[1:53:54] I'd end with this. They they they
[1:53:56] badmouth him. They make him look bad.
[1:53:58] But church, we would all would doubt if
[1:54:00] it wasn't for God's mercy.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; He took the gospel further physically
[1:54:04] than any apostle. And his labor was
[1:54:06] second to Paul because Paul said, "I
[1:54:08] labored more than all of them."
[1:54:11] So he was probably the second greatest
[1:54:13] laborer
[1:54:15] and he was invited to thrust his hand.
[1:54:17] Jesus said, "Go ahead, thrust it in
[1:54:19] there." And what does Paul say? Paul
[1:54:22] says, "Put your life in Christ." Go
[1:54:25] ahead and put your life in my side. Put
[1:54:28] your life in the word of God. And then
[1:54:30] Jesus says, "Now you'll believe."
[1:54:33] Hallelujah. How many want to believe?
[1:54:36] Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Put your hand in Christ today. Thomas.
[1:54:41] Hallelujah. Bride, put your life, hide
[1:54:46] it in Christ today and you'll believe.
[1:54:48] Jesus said, "My Lord." I'm sorry. Thomas
[1:54:50] said, "My Lord and my God." After he put
[1:54:53] his hand in the side, my Lord and God.
[1:54:55] Amen. After he put our lives in Jesus
[1:54:57] Christ, Jesus is my Lord. Jesus is my
[1:55:00] God. Let's bow our heads. Oh my. Thank
[1:55:05] you, Lord Jesus. Oh my. We ought to be
[1:55:07] happy today, church. We ought to be
[1:55:09] thankful.
[1:55:11] Hallelujah. Now I know what the water
[1:55:15] and blood was all about.
[1:55:18] Now I know that was God purchasing
[1:55:21] the bodies, redeeming the bodies of the
[1:55:23] bride and also saying the bride can now
[1:55:26] be birthed because water, blood, and
[1:55:28] spirit are all present.
[1:55:31] and I'm going to form a bride 50 days
[1:55:32] later on the day of Pentecost.
[1:55:36] Oh Lord, we love you today. God, thank
[1:55:38] you for this word that we've heard
[1:55:39] today. God, for 24 years, I've not
[1:55:41] preach this. Lord, you're my witness.
[1:55:44] I've not understood
[1:55:47] as God pulled a bride out of Adam. God's
[1:55:52] going to pull a bride out of Christ
[1:55:53] [music] until yesterday. Thank you for
[1:55:56] John chapter 3. Thank you for all these
[1:55:58] verses that connected together.
[1:56:01] Lord, it's a beautiful picture from your
[1:56:03] Bible. Thank you that you have forever
[1:56:06] perfected the bride of Christ fellowship
[1:56:07] [music] if they'll believe the promises
[1:56:09] of God. Also, Brother Andy, Brother
[1:56:12] Arley, all of our friends in Christ, the
[1:56:15] Junction [music] City Saints, I love
[1:56:17] them so much.
[1:56:19] Lord God,
[1:56:21] our friends around the message. Lord,
[1:56:24] you have [music] forever perfected them
[1:56:26] by the blood. And now by that blood, we
[1:56:28] have access to heaven. Our prayers mean
[1:56:31] so [music] much.
[1:56:33] Hallelujah. We're kings and priests unto
[1:56:35] God.
[1:56:38] Lord, let us remember this message,
[1:56:40] [music] Lord, when we partake of the
[1:56:41] Lord's supper in two Sundays. God, help
[1:56:43] me to make reminders or bring it to my
[1:56:44] remembrance by the power of the spirit.
[1:56:49] You said, [music] "Do these things in
[1:56:51] remembrance of me." We'll remember that
[1:56:53] the water is cleansing, the blood is
[1:56:56] atonement, harmony with God, and the
[1:56:59] spirit is your life in us, Lord [music]
[1:57:00] God. We'll remember that, Jesus.
[1:57:03] We remember when we wash our brother's
[1:57:05] feet,
[1:57:07] his paths [music] are cleansed. The
[1:57:09] footsteps of the righteous are cleansed
[1:57:12] or ordered by the Lord.
[1:57:15] God, use our steps, Lord. use our
[1:57:17] travels, use our job assignments that
[1:57:20] [music] we can win souls to Jesus
[1:57:22] Christ. He that winth souls is wise.
[1:57:29] Grant it Lord God.
[1:57:33] So Lord we love you today God.
[1:57:36] I pray there was a good recording I
[1:57:37] could share this some of my [music]
[1:57:39] friends Lord God who might need that
[1:57:41] today. Hallelujah.
[1:57:43] that assurance that for once and for all
[1:57:45] the blood of Jesus Christ has forever
[1:57:47] [music] sanctified us. Hallelujah.
[1:57:51] We are your bride.
[1:57:53] Hallelujah. Jesus, help us remember
[1:57:56] we're holy without blame before you in
[1:57:58] [music] love. Forgive our sins today,
[1:58:01] Jesus. May we confess them and enjoy the
[1:58:05] forgiveness of the blood of Jesus
[1:58:07] [music] Christ. There's any sick and
[1:58:09] afflicted God. I pray that they would
[1:58:10] come forward so we could pray for them
[1:58:12] that your people could be well as we
[1:58:15] start 2026 [music]
[1:58:17] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints
[1:58:19] said,
[1:58:21] let's sing a song here. If you need
[1:58:22] [music] prayer, you're more than welcome
[1:58:23] to
