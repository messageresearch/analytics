[26:06] copy and I I'll certainly get you copy
[26:07] if you're going to read it by God's
[26:09] grace sometimes I just never know uh
[26:11] even myself I you know I bought myself
[26:13] so many books and I haven't read all of
[26:15] them you know I I got good
[26:17] intentions but I got to trust there's a
[26:20] a time and season with God I've got to
[26:21] trust that because like I said I'm
[26:22] almost through this now after all these
[26:24] years you Jose didn't know what he was
[26:25] doing but he was blessing me a whole lot
[26:27] when in this book here no surprise there
[26:29] right he's always blessing the Saints um
[26:32] and so I just want to just tie this in I
[26:33] think I call it a supernatural
[26:34] generation last week I preached on a
[26:36] supernatural book of Acts church I
[26:38] appreciate the good feedback on that by
[26:39] God's grace and we are part of that by
[26:41] God's grace um you know uh brother cam
[26:45] was sending he and I were sending some
[26:46] messages this week and he said I'm just
[26:47] so amazed to see all the supernatural in
[26:50] my life and I thought that was such an
[26:51] encouragement I just want to encourage
[26:53] you too you know just keep looking for
[26:55] the supernatural in your life you know
[26:57] whenever you you see God's hand whenever
[26:58] you see favor whenever you see Mercy
[27:00] it's actually God's Supernatural hand
[27:03] and so we just want to be mindful of
[27:04] that you know uh as I've said before you
[27:06] know we can't we can't pick which
[27:08] talents we got from Jesus right some got
[27:11] five some got two one I'm sure there's
[27:14] four and three in there as well but in
[27:16] the parable it was five two and one and
[27:18] so we can't choose the Bible said the
[27:20] the holy spirit gives the gifts severly
[27:22] as he would give them unto us and so we
[27:25] once we recognize that we have a gift we
[27:28] want to find it as our brother preached
[27:29] The Mystery of Life that was a wonderful
[27:31] title and uh that's the mystery brother
[27:33] BR said that's the mystery of God's will
[27:35] find what God placed you here to do and
[27:36] then do it by God's grace right just be
[27:39] as dedicated just be as diligent as you
[27:41] can brother Braham said do all you can
[27:43] do for Jesus he said and Jesus will make
[27:44] up for the rest I've always loved that
[27:47] that quote has always come to my heart
[27:49] and mind I'll do everything I can on my
[27:51] own power and of course yielding to the
[27:52] Holy Spirit my own human human effort
[27:55] you know diligence and then the holy
[27:57] spirit will make make up for the rest
[27:58] that I can't do or anything that I you
[28:00] know would need God's uh you know extra
[28:02] leadership on or extra Grace now of
[28:04] course I can do nothing on myself but
[28:05] what I mean is my yielding to God
[28:08] anything that I won't yield to God
[28:09] anything that I struggle with I know God
[28:11] will make up for it all right so I think
[28:13] you understand what I'm saying I'm not
[28:14] I'm not preaching Works religion I I
[28:16] have no power of my own but if there's
[28:18] anything I struggle to do God will help
[28:20] me God will work God will work beside my
[28:23] failures amen right just like Abraham
[28:25] and Sarah just think of remember all
[28:26] those SPS remember all those red dots I
[28:28] put on the timeline God worked despite
[28:31] all those red dots God works despite all
[28:33] of our failures right God works because
[28:36] God is in control God is the author he's
[28:39] the author and finisher of our faith
[28:41] Hallelujah he's faithful to finish the
[28:43] good work that he started in your life
[28:46] as I prayed for my wife last night you
[28:47] know remember God has good plans for us
[28:50] he has a hope for us he has a future for
[28:52] us praise God hallelujah he has an
[28:54] expected end in other words we can
[28:56] expect the ending
[28:58] it's going to be a good ending this
[28:59] movie is going to end good Hallelujah
[29:02] the story of life this book is going to
[29:03] end good by God's grace it's so true so
[29:06] I want to preach on that I want to
[29:07] preach on a supernatural generation and
[29:09] I kind of got that from here you know uh
[29:11] this this granddaughter brother randam
[29:13] looked at you know a generation had P
[29:15] passed since brother Bram died and she
[29:17] wanted to share and preserve some of
[29:19] these testimonies I'm glad she did some
[29:20] of them are really wonderful and you
[29:22] know I just I didn't know which way to
[29:23] start I thought well maybe I'll start
[29:24] with his family members or maybe I'll
[29:26] start with the oldest ones and I thought
[29:28] well I'm going to go with the
[29:29] testimonies that touch my heart the most
[29:30] so may it may be a strange testimony I'm
[29:33] going to end with tonight but I think
[29:34] you'll see why by God's grace just a
[29:36] couple things tie in that I really like
[29:38] here so we read our text you know the
[29:40] this whole chapter is powerful I was
[29:42] reading through the chapter today I'm
[29:43] like my I could preach this whole
[29:44] chapter just because it's such an
[29:46] encouragement to the people but you know
[29:49] the 17 says oh God thou has taught me
[29:51] from my youth how many you know God's
[29:52] been after you since you were a child
[29:55] he's taught you lesson since you were
[29:56] young and hitherto have I declared thy
[29:59] wonderful works so since I was a child
[30:01] I've declared God's works I've told my
[30:03] mom's healing of cancer since I was a
[30:05] child right just more so in these last
[30:07] years whenever God's done for you you
[30:10] know you've tried to I'm sure over the
[30:12] years you've tried to pass on and share
[30:14] with others what God has done for you
[30:17] this is what the psalm writer says Lord
[30:19] you've taught me and I've tried to pass
[30:20] it on now also when I'm old and
[30:23] gray-headed now don't go count my gray
[30:25] hairs okay don't try to focus just over
[30:27] here not not over here I know the
[30:29] scripture says
[30:31] that when I'm old and gray-headed oh God
[30:33] I love this forsake me not words I see
[30:36] you when I'm young I see you in my
[30:37] midlife please as I'm getting older
[30:39] Please Don't Leave Me Now church and if
[30:42] as you get older that's when you see how
[30:44] really how much you need God right
[30:46] you're weaker you're more susceptible to
[30:48] failures or weakness or tripping or
[30:50] breaking bones or you know the bones get
[30:52] brittle as you get older but you just
[30:54] see you see your weakness right brother
[30:57] Bram said you're fading out like the sun
[30:59] going
[31:00] down right so I guess you know what's a
[31:03] I think brother Bram said uh 21 was when
[31:05] the the noon time when the sun was
[31:07] highest in the sky so some of you
[31:09] getting pretty close right some of us
[31:11] getting pretty close to the height of
[31:12] the sun right I done past that a while
[31:16] ago my son's getting a little
[31:19] lower but we're I'm thankful that Christ
[31:21] is shining on my life praise God I'm
[31:24] thankful I've been able to live this day
[31:25] for
[31:26] Christ
[31:27] he said ' forsake me not until in other
[31:29] words don't let me die until I've showed
[31:32] your strength now this show is a
[31:34] different show than maybe what I thought
[31:36] until I've showed your strength unto
[31:38] this generation and thy power to
[31:40] everyone that is to come Hallelujah and
[31:44] you know look how God answered this
[31:45] prayer now every generation has got to
[31:47] read this this prayer think about that
[31:50] think about what a Prayer church I I
[31:52] feel like if you really pray you want
[31:53] God to move through your life so that
[31:55] other people will be blessed I believe
[31:56] God will do that that amen praise God
[31:59] like like this week we finally finished
[32:00] reading through my book my big thick
[32:02] book we finally finished that last night
[32:04] I think it was yeah last night we finish
[32:05] it and I just told the children I said
[32:07] if I go beyond the the veil I go beyond
[32:10] the curtain of time I said this is here
[32:12] this is the left for
[32:13] you and my wife's like I hope you don't
[32:15] go on Beyond the Veil very soon right
[32:18] I'm like I hope not either I hope we go
[32:20] in the Rapture by God's grace but but
[32:22] that's what I love about the book that
[32:24] it something I can leave behind if the
[32:26] Lord terries Lord CH and I turn 10020
[32:29] right now I can't I don't make it
[32:33] 121 but I I want my generation I want
[32:36] the people that lived around me to know
[32:37] God's word and to know that I love God
[32:41] and I lived a life that was worthy of
[32:43] the Gospel praise God like right now I'm
[32:46] trying to Mentor this young teacher I'm
[32:48] trying to get him to do what I do teach
[32:50] Bible Club so I'm trying to start that
[32:52] because I can see you know I've done it
[32:53] for you know maybe 10 years and I want
[32:55] to you know want I want some help I like
[32:59] some help and so I'm trying to Mentor
[33:01] him and trying to meet up with him I
[33:02] just sent him some messages today let's
[33:03] meet up and talk about that you're young
[33:05] man my you're 23 you're right in the
[33:06] prime you know the sun's still really
[33:08] pretty much straight up in the air you
[33:10] know and I want to show show him you
[33:12] know my I've been trying to be faithful
[33:14] in my generation and you need to be
[33:15] faithful in your
[33:17] generation really I got 15 more years
[33:19] Till I Retire so I'm doing pretty good
[33:20] by God's grace but I'm I'm I'm on the
[33:22] other end of it you know uh done past
[33:25] that Midway mark and he says uh and thy
[33:28] power to everyone that is to come thy
[33:30] righteousness also oh God is very high
[33:33] who has done who has done great things
[33:36] oh God who's like unto thee who do we
[33:38] know like Jesus who can we sing to like
[33:41] Jesus amen nobody praise God because
[33:43] there's nobody like Jesus amen we looked
[33:45] all around never found anybody like
[33:47] Jesus turned all around children I never
[33:49] found anybody like Jesus right
[33:52] Hallelujah now this word show show means
[33:55] that look I thought it was you know like
[33:56] maybe just show Miracles or something
[33:58] but in this case now we know the power
[33:59] speaks of Miracles but in this case he
[34:01] says Lord let me show let me declare or
[34:04] announce or tell or expound on your
[34:08] glory to my generation let me just
[34:11] publish it praise God let me just share
[34:13] it with somebody what you've done in my
[34:15] life praise God for my generation let me
[34:18] tell somebody let me announce it let me
[34:20] report to people that God is the same
[34:22] yesterday today and forever and then
[34:25] Lord show your power in my life
[34:28] hallelujah oh it's a great prayer how
[34:29] many like that
[34:31] prayer Lord when I'm old and gray-headed
[34:33] you know don't forget me then and I want
[34:35] to show everybody in my generation I
[34:37] want to tell everybody your glory I want
[34:40] to tell everybody about the power of
[34:42] Jesus Christ hallelujah it's a beautiful
[34:45] beautiful uh uh scripture
[34:49] there now brother Ram tells us here you
[34:51] know as I said you know uh my uh
[34:55] leadership on how I preach and pastored
[34:57] for 17 years and preached for 19 years
[35:00] has been always to put the Bible at the
[35:02] Forefront and show how brother Ram
[35:04] taught the Bible but I've never been
[35:06] guilty of putting brother random in
[35:07] front know above the Bible never been
[35:09] guilty of that by God's grace like I've
[35:11] never said every word brother randam
[35:12] said was thus say the Lord I've never
[35:13] said that I've never given uh given more
[35:17] credit to brother Ram than Jesus I won't
[35:18] be guilty of
[35:20] that and brother because this is what
[35:23] brother Ram told us to do now the the
[35:25] other side you know thece side they can
[35:27] take a few quotes and twist it but
[35:29] that's not really what brother ramam
[35:30] said when brother Bram said you know he
[35:32] said you kind of look to me as an
[35:34] absolute he wasn't saying I'm equal to
[35:36] the Bible he was saying you got to have
[35:38] he said follow me as I follow Christ
[35:40] he's saying I'm a human preacher and
[35:42] every human has to follow some type of
[35:45] Pastor right some Pastor or Prophet or
[35:47] whoever whatever person the five-fold
[35:49] ministry you're under hopefully a pastor
[35:51] I believe everybody should have a pastor
[35:53] uh I believe God would provide that to
[35:55] every man that's just my humble opinion
[35:58] I believe that but that's what brother B
[35:59] told us he said watch the message in
[36:02] order to avoid idolatry so that means we
[36:04] got to watch the Bible read brother
[36:07] bram's uh sermons listen brother Bram
[36:09] read the church age book you know but
[36:11] then take everything back to the Bible
[36:12] and that will keep you out of idolatry
[36:15] he says it in absolute January 20 uh
[36:18] January
[36:19] 27th right before Victoria's birthday
[36:22] people talk about Devils don't even know
[36:24] what they are sometime but you run
[36:25] headlong into them every day maybe but
[36:27] you will how many how many notice every
[36:29] day you run into
[36:30] them right brother BR said you know once
[36:33] you get a victory over them then they
[36:34] come real Sly they come with real
[36:36] something real Sly like you would you
[36:38] would you would notice right away oh
[36:39] that's a that's a you know that's a
[36:41] bottle of Jack Daniels I'm I'm trying to
[36:43] think of you know or a prostitute you
[36:45] know right away that's a devil but
[36:47] Satan's got to come in little small ways
[36:50] Little White
[36:52] Lies right so every day we're going to
[36:55] run into and think about that behind
[36:57] that white liar that little small thing
[36:59] is a nasty Wicked devil wanting to
[37:02] destroy your life destroy your walk with
[37:04] God that's why you know uh if there's
[37:07] even a question it's wise many times
[37:09] don't do it if there's a question to it
[37:12] right it's better to air on the side of
[37:14] obedience and a peace of mind it's
[37:17] better to air on a peace of mind than
[37:19] question mind right or a confused mind
[37:22] the Bible said anything that's not done
[37:23] in faith is what it's sin
[37:28] after a while Satan was accusing me
[37:30] think about that he says you have now
[37:31] look Satan says you have no power with
[37:35] God you're a you're just a bluff you
[37:38] have no
[37:39] power I said Satan you're an offense to
[37:42] me get out of my way in the name of
[37:45] Jesus Christ now that's a quote we can
[37:47] use tomorrow amen get out of my way
[37:49] Satan Hallelujah he's accusing me now
[37:53] Church isn't some of that true do we
[37:54] have any power no we don't have any
[37:55] power but what do we got Authority
[37:57] praise God hallelujah just like that
[37:59] police officer brother you put a a
[38:01] dwindle little 100 pound man out there
[38:04] you know if he's just standing on the
[38:06] road and all the cars drive by he won't
[38:08] be able to stop him but he said put an
[38:10] officer police officer suit on him give
[38:13] him a whistle give him a badge he'll
[38:14] blow the whistle and cars going 80 miles
[38:17] per hour will slam on their brakes not
[38:19] because of power but because of
[38:21] authority amen and that's what we are
[38:23] we're weak people but when we got the
[38:25] authority when we got the B
[38:27] of the blood of Jesus Christ all hell
[38:29] has to stop Hallelujah can say like that
[38:31] all demons have to slam on their brakes
[38:33] Hallelujah in other words Satan you can
[38:35] only go this
[38:37] far is that right
[38:41] Hallelujah you can barrel down the road
[38:43] of my life or try to scare me something
[38:45] like that but you've got to stop right
[38:47] here in the name of Jesus right that's
[38:50] what brother BR
[38:52] says and Satan says you're a bluff
[38:55] brother Brandon right we all make
[38:57] mistakes right but see when he comes
[38:59] down to it he said Satan get behind me
[39:01] that's what Jesus said Satan you're an
[39:02] offense unto me get thee behind me
[39:06] Satan now brother man's talking about
[39:08] this Mamba Vision I'm not going to get
[39:09] into that it's a it's a powerful story
[39:12] you haven't heard of that Vision he said
[39:14] I laid there a little bit in the bed
[39:15] started up to rise up I felt a sweet
[39:18] real sweet feeling come over me I
[39:19] thought wonder if the Holy Spirit I was
[39:21] close how many like that feeling amen
[39:23] you just feel something change or you
[39:25] get those Goosebumps or or use for me
[39:27] many times just I start crying oh now I
[39:30] feel the presence of God not always but
[39:33] many
[39:33] times he said now over the corner he
[39:36] said so help me here's my Bible over my
[39:38] heart the sweetest voice I ever heard in
[39:40] my life said Don't Fear to go anywhere
[39:42] and don't fear to do anything for the
[39:44] never-failing presence of Jesus Christ
[39:46] is with you wherever you
[39:48] go think of all the prayer lines think
[39:51] of all the missionary trips and even
[39:53] this think about when he got in the car
[39:55] accident at the end amen God never
[39:58] forsakes us he never leaves us nor
[40:00] forsakes
[40:02] us hallelujah don't fear another the M
[40:05] the main point is don't fear trust
[40:09] God that settled it with me May it
[40:11] settle with us too he said let them rage
[40:14] I got an absolute my anchor holds out
[40:17] yonder because it's the word of the
[40:19] Living God what's Brothers absolute the
[40:21] word of the Living God he said let's bow
[40:24] our heads a moment if you haven't got
[40:26] that absolute now get it if you like to
[40:27] have that absolute that Assurance in
[40:29] Your Heart by the holy spirit so where's
[40:30] the absolute in this case but said the
[40:32] absolute's in your heart the Holy
[40:35] Ghost raise your hand and say I want
[40:37] something that'll punctuate the word of
[40:39] God and I can see the word of God made
[40:41] manifest amen God bless you it's all
[40:42] over the building thank you I'm only
[40:44] telling you the truth friend don't let
[40:45] it pass you by I'm nothing now look at
[40:48] this I'm nothing I'm your brother don't
[40:50] pay any attention to a messenger you
[40:52] watch the messenger now look what about
[40:54] that
[40:55] quote be people that all they do is
[40:57] worship brother BR all they do is preach
[40:58] brother brandom what about that what are
[41:00] you going to do about that see in other
[41:02] words he's saying don't worship me don't
[41:05] pay attention to my human attributes pay
[41:07] attention to the word of God that I'm
[41:09] preaching
[41:10] Hallelujah you watch the message don't
[41:12] watch the messenger God will take it
[41:14] away from you and that's my question
[41:16] that's why it's possible God took
[41:18] brother random at the age of 56 such a
[41:20] young age that's personally why I think
[41:23] God took brother Braham I don't know but
[41:25] we have a quote that says it brother man
[41:27] says if you put too much attention on
[41:29] the messenger God will take him away now
[41:32] just one thought I'm not saying but it's
[41:34] only one that makes sense to me
[41:35] especially seeing all the idolatry
[41:36] that's happening now in the family and
[41:39] in the brandom
[41:40] Tabernacle he will share his glory with
[41:43] nobody that's right don't watch the
[41:46] messenger watch the message if a man
[41:48] running here he might be black yellow
[41:50] brown ragged if he's got a check for you
[41:52] for a bank draft for a million dollars
[41:54] you wouldn't care what color he was or
[41:56] how he was dressed it's the message he
[41:58] has for you so brother Braham is making
[42:00] himself the Ragged man but he's got a
[42:02] million-dollar message right here how
[42:04] many want a million dollar message amen
[42:06] one time brother dig said you going to
[42:07] be a millionaire I thought well now now
[42:08] I know what it means right
[42:10] here I have the unsearchable riches of
[42:13] Christ it ain't money it's the word
[42:16] hallelujah amen there it is I got a
[42:18] quote for it too I'll sh have to share
[42:19] that with brother digs I said brother
[42:21] digs you were right I am a millionaire
[42:22] by the spirit of
[42:24] God now don't look at my grammar and the
[42:27] things just remember I'm telling you
[42:29] about Jesus Christ who's here now you
[42:31] believe him with all your heart don't
[42:33] you fail to believe him so keep that in
[42:35] mind as we go on now we have to be a
[42:38] witness to our
[42:40] generation uh the Bible said uh with St
[42:43] Paul he he said he came unto me he's
[42:45] telling his testimony and stood and said
[42:47] to me brother Saul receive thy sight
[42:49] speaking of ananas and the same hour I
[42:51] looked up upon him and he said the god
[42:53] of our fathers has chosen thee that thou
[42:55] shouldest know know his will now think
[42:56] about that church of all the churches
[42:58] out there you know Christ and you know
[43:00] the will of Christ you know the will
[43:03] about your hair about your clothes about
[43:05] your makeup and there's no makeup about
[43:07] jewelry right the water baptism the
[43:10] godhead Hallelujah the five b Ministry
[43:13] you know all this why because God called
[43:16] you to know it amen God wanted to show
[43:18] it to you praise God he didn't have to
[43:20] show it to you but he showed it to you
[43:22] praise
[43:24] God why cuz he chose you he chose you
[43:29] that's what God told Paul through ananas
[43:31] and uh Paul was the first church age
[43:34] messenger God chose you that you should
[43:36] know his will and see the just one and
[43:38] should hear the voice of his mouth we're
[43:40] a blessed people to hear the voice of
[43:41] Christ in this hour we can listen to his
[43:44] servant brother brandham we can listen
[43:45] to the fivefold ministry if anybody
[43:48] prophesies here tonight and it's thus
[43:49] say the Lord that'll be the voice of
[43:51] Christ in the bride of
[43:54] Christ for th Thou shalt be his witness
[43:58] unto all men of what thou Hast seen and
[44:01] heard so that's what Christ wants from
[44:03] all of us he wants us to be a witness of
[44:05] all the things we've seen and all the
[44:07] things we've heard I was telling brother
[44:09] Diggs about sister Naomi's testimony
[44:10] when she spoke in tongues and how that
[44:11] was a answer to prayer years back and he
[44:14] said wow he liked that testimony that
[44:17] meant a lot to him and he shared because
[44:19] he was sharing some other
[44:21] testimonies and I just thought that and
[44:23] I loved how brother Brooks sorry brother
[44:24] Brooks brother Diggs was sharing all
[44:26] those testimonies at the end to show you
[44:28] how Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[44:30] today and forever all we can do is tell
[44:33] what we've seen and heard remember we
[44:36] were at the Baptist Church a few weeks
[44:37] ago what did they all clap on they all
[44:38] clapped on how I got saved and I got the
[44:40] Holy Ghost it was the testimony in other
[44:42] words we we we love the word but we love
[44:45] to hear how the word Moves In Our Lives
[44:48] amen I love to hear in somebody else's
[44:50] life I love how God proves himself to
[44:52] every generation hallelujah amen and
[44:56] that's all we can do all we can do is
[44:58] witness to what we've seen or heard
[45:00] God's not asking you to witness to what
[45:01] you haven't seen or heard God just wants
[45:03] you to be a witness for what you've seen
[45:04] brother says it plainly he said when you
[45:06] become a Christian he said if you don't
[45:08] know what to say just tell them how your
[45:09] fire got lit anybody got a fire in
[45:12] here hallelujah well sometime it got lit
[45:15] Hallelujah so tell people how it got lit
[45:18] amen you got nothing else to tell them
[45:21] tell them how the fire started on the
[45:24] inside oh thank God thank God there's a
[45:27] fire burning in our souls
[45:29] amen and it's not cold right it's not
[45:31] cold and stiff and starchy and empty in
[45:34] our souls but our soul is filled with
[45:36] the warm fire of God's love oh my the
[45:40] fire of his Spirit praise God he said
[45:43] why do you tear now why do you wait now
[45:44] rise Paul be baptized and wash away thy
[45:46] sins calling on the name of the
[45:50] Lord remember this picture I kind of
[45:52] updated this is how the message came to
[45:54] us brother random when when he passed
[45:56] away brother Neville became the pastor
[45:58] brother Neville before he died he went
[45:59] to the the Saints house Tom and Linda
[46:02] Brown in in
[46:04] Lima and preached the message there they
[46:06] started a church uh brother Brooks
[46:08] became the pastor there right and then
[46:11] brother Brooks ordained me and here we
[46:13] are with Zion and bank that has no
[46:14] meaning to it or anything you know just
[46:17] the latest picture I had with brother
[46:19] Brooks and I um so that's how the
[46:21] message came to us but you know
[46:24] generally generationally speaking it's
[46:26] only been three
[46:27] generations right because brother random
[46:29] had Joseph in 1955 that was just 5 years
[46:31] after my dad was
[46:33] born so when I when I when I plac myself
[46:36] I'd be like the age of one of Joseph
[46:38] bram's Children right because he's just
[46:40] five years uh younger than my dad so
[46:44] that kind of gives me a good okay and
[46:45] then now I have an adult I added Lydia
[46:47] because now she's an adult so now we
[46:49] have an adult
[46:50] generation right so brother random uh
[46:55] Joseph
[46:56] you know and then children and then next
[46:58] so I guess it'll be the fourth right
[46:59] that be would that be the fourth did I
[47:01] get that wrong oh I'm I'm sorry it's the
[47:03] third from Brother Brown yes so so I'm
[47:04] not counting brother Bram uh it' be
[47:06] Joseph or my dad and then me and then
[47:08] Lydia that's kind of how it would be so
[47:10] it's been three generations since
[47:11] brother Brandon Hallelujah and we can
[47:14] see and church we can all see that the
[47:16] message is pure after all these
[47:17] Generations the word of God is moving on
[47:21] they cannot stop this word
[47:23] hallelujah they used to have it just
[47:25] where they they only had a couple
[47:27] sermons and books and then they got it
[47:28] all on the computer and now we got it
[47:30] all on our phones you're not going to
[47:32] stop this message praise God hallelujah
[47:35] it's got to go around the world Jesus
[47:36] said this gospel must be preached to
[47:38] every nation and then the end shall come
[47:41] so what we need some more preachers to
[47:42] do missionary work Hallelujah God called
[47:45] me to be a pastor we'll see how long
[47:46] that lasts Hallelujah I'm just I just
[47:48] want to be open to whatever God would
[47:50] have I may be a pastor my whole life
[47:51] we'll see I don't know but I want to be
[47:53] open to the leadership of the Holy
[47:55] Spirit praise praise
[47:57] God and I like this quote in every age
[48:00] we have exactly the same pattern that is
[48:02] why the light comes through some
[48:03] god-given messenger brother brandom in a
[48:05] certain area Jeffersonville Indiana and
[48:07] then from that messenger there spreads
[48:08] the light through the ministry of others
[48:10] brother Neville who have been Faithfully
[48:12] taught right brother Brooks and then
[48:14] down to us but of course all those who
[48:16] go out don't always learn how necessary
[48:18] it is to speak only what the messenger
[48:20] has spoken Allelujah now of course we
[48:22] have to balance this quote right brother
[48:23] Ram says I don't have all the answers
[48:25] right and there's scriptures that
[48:26] brother BR never preached from so we
[48:28] have to balance this out brother Bram
[48:29] never said uh you must be a PA of me
[48:32] we're not Paris we're
[48:34] Eagles we're not chickens we're Eagles
[48:38] Hallelujah now he he uses the scripture
[48:40] remember Paul warned the people to only
[48:42] say what he said now that's the
[48:44] scripture right 1 Corinthians 14:37 If
[48:47] any man think himself to be a prophet or
[48:48] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[48:50] things that I write unto you are the
[48:52] Commandments of the Lord what came the
[48:54] word of God out from you only or came it
[48:56] unto you only so in our case we use all
[48:59] the quotes of brother brand when he
[49:01] points back to the word right with the
[49:03] thus sayth the Lords because that's the
[49:04] Commandment of God that's what he's
[49:07] saying he said only say what the word of
[49:09] God has said and if I don't if I had my
[49:12] own thought I'll tell you this is just
[49:13] my thought this is just my opinion and I
[49:15] try to place it by some
[49:17] scripture all right and he says now
[49:20] churches they add here they take away
[49:22] there from the Bible and soon the
[49:24] message is no longer pure
[49:26] and the Revival dies down how careful we
[49:28] must be to hear one voice for the spirit
[49:31] has but one voice which is the voice of
[49:33] God and brother R says any child of God
[49:36] can be the voice of God when they're
[49:37] yielded to the Holy Spirit sorry any
[49:41] child of God I got the quotes I don't
[49:43] have it up here but I could play it for
[49:44] you it's on one of my absolute videos
[49:46] any person who yields to the Holy Spirit
[49:48] can be the voice of God to us because
[49:51] the Bible said the spirit and the who
[49:53] say come the bride let say together the
[49:55] spirit and the bride say come the bride
[49:58] has a voice amen you have a voice when
[50:01] you speak God's word it's God's Voice
[50:03] Hallelujah the spirit and the bride say
[50:06] come you represent God's
[50:09] Voice
[50:13] Hallelujah Paul warned them to say what
[50:15] he said even as Peter did likewise so
[50:17] again we see it's the word of God it's
[50:19] the Commandments of God from the Bible
[50:21] he warned them that even he Paul could
[50:23] not change one word of what he had been
[50:24] given by re reation but remember there's
[50:26] another quote in the book where brother
[50:27] says God can give you more information
[50:29] on the same
[50:30] Revelation he said we have to be open to
[50:32] that that means just more scriptures
[50:35] about the same Revelation oh how
[50:37] important it is to hear the voice of God
[50:39] by the way of his Messengers and then
[50:41] say what has been given them to say to
[50:44] the
[50:45] churches he that hath an ear let him
[50:47] hear what the spirit of God says to the
[50:49] church so what do we hear on Sunday what
[50:52] do we hear from the spirit of God on
[50:53] Sunday watch for your desires young
[50:55] people and parents compliment your
[50:57] children I went home on Sunday night and
[50:58] I told all my girls you're beautiful and
[51:00] your hair is
[51:02] beautiful I told him that last night too
[51:04] I told him Mali you're handsome you're
[51:07] very talented I told Z well I don't know
[51:09] if I told Zion he might have been
[51:10] sleeping like he is now but I went home
[51:13] and I just try to apply that I want them
[51:15] to know Daddy thinks they're
[51:16] beautiful Hallelujah and no Slicker is
[51:19] going to come around here and try to
[51:21] trick my daughters by God's grace
[51:23] protect us great Holy Spirit that's our
[51:27] prayer but the holy spirit said watch
[51:29] your desires crucify your sinful desires
[51:32] and enjoy the desires God has given
[51:36] you we also heard the mystery of life
[51:39] that uh you are the mystery of Christ
[51:41] and that's scriptural right we're the
[51:43] bride of Christ the Bible said you are
[51:46] in the stead or the representation or
[51:48] the place of Jesus Christ how many know
[51:50] that so when people say that you know uh
[51:52] the the bride is the mystery of Christ
[51:54] revealed that's true
[51:55] because it's the mystery is Christ in
[51:58] you the hope it's a mystery how could
[52:00] Christ be in me it's the hope of glory
[52:02] amen that God would share his divinity
[52:05] that God would put his own life in US
[52:07] praise God so there's a truth to that
[52:10] now we can't go too far on it where
[52:12] everything we say is thus say the Lord
[52:13] and all that nonsense we can't go that
[52:15] far but we do have scripture that when
[52:17] we speak the word of God it's God Spirit
[52:19] speaking through US praise
[52:21] God see it's such a balance but people
[52:24] get so easily unbalanced because they
[52:26] don't have teaching but we got to have
[52:28] more than teaching we got to have power
[52:29] too amen hallelujah that's what we
[52:31] desire Hallelujah that's why I'm
[52:33] preaching this to to raise our faith may
[52:35] not seem like it but uh I just felt like
[52:37] I had to teach this to get to the the
[52:39] testimony Parts here thou therefore my
[52:42] son be strong in the grace that is in
[52:44] Christ Jesus and the things that thou
[52:46] has heard of me among many witnesses so
[52:48] remember the testimonies the same commit
[52:50] thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able
[52:52] to teach others also now I hope by God's
[52:55] Grace I've been able to teach you
[52:57] something whether it was predestination
[53:00] or the godhead or the Seven
[53:04] Seals what something I've taught
[53:06] hopefully I was able to teach you
[53:07] something by God's grace the two
[53:09] resurrections you know the seven Church
[53:10] ages hopefully I was able by God's grace
[53:12] I believe I have but uh that's just my
[53:15] desire just want to be
[53:17] humble he says Thou therefore endure
[53:20] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[53:23] Christ that's that's strange you Paul
[53:25] says uh be strong but then he says you
[53:28] got to endure
[53:29] hardness so you better be strong because
[53:32] you know trials are coming we're not in
[53:34] a
[53:35] picnic we can't expect Our Lives to be a
[53:38] picnic now we can expect seasons of of
[53:40] rest like I preached we can expect
[53:43] seasons of rest because of obedience but
[53:45] during those seasons of rest strengthen
[53:47] yourself
[53:48] Hallelujah strengthen yourself do your
[53:50] spiritual exercises Hallelujah learn the
[53:53] word of God enjoy the word of God Feast
[53:55] on the word of God that's a time to
[53:57] Feast on God's word the season of
[54:00] rest so preacher has to endure hardness
[54:03] as a soldier of Christ that means I've
[54:06] got to use the sword sometimes right
[54:08] that means I got to use the shield a lot
[54:10] because of all the attacks coming at you
[54:12] right each one of you have to do the
[54:14] same there are seasons where you're
[54:16] attacked in your family might be
[54:17] attacked at the church you might be
[54:19] attacked
[54:20] online might be attacked by Family
[54:22] there's times we're all attacked and all
[54:24] we have to do is raise up our faith amen
[54:27] hallelujah just raise it up praise God
[54:29] and faith will extinguish every fiery
[54:31] Dart praise every single word
[54:34] hallelujah every lie or every attack can
[54:37] be taken away it can be defeated by
[54:39] faith in the word of God
[54:41] hallelujah faith is Assurance by the
[54:44] Assurance of the word of
[54:47] God now i' I've read this before but I'm
[54:49] just going to briefly go over again you
[54:50] know the the accusers
[54:53] clearly uh don't have the the fruits of
[54:56] the Holy Spirit right they they say
[54:58] brother R plagiarize the seals yet i'
[55:01] I've showed 37 differences and they
[55:02] won't even they won't even honestly look
[55:05] at one of them they say God three
[55:07] persons adding to the Bible with no
[55:10] scripture they describe their podcast as
[55:13] juicy because they like gossip and they
[55:15] tell lies about God's servant see what
[55:17] are they do in church they're looking at
[55:18] the messenger instead of the message
[55:20] there it is right
[55:21] there is that right they're focusing on
[55:24] the mess messenger rather than the
[55:26] message that's what I always want to do
[55:28] next time if ever a debate or something
[55:29] I say let's get off that let's go back
[55:31] to the Bible what's the Bible say about
[55:33] women's hair what's the Bible say about
[55:35] water baptism Hallelujah what's the
[55:38] Bible say about women preachers take it
[55:40] back to the Bible that's what they don't
[55:41] want to talk
[55:43] about they say Halloween is fun and and
[55:46] now we're in Halloween season so it's a
[55:47] good reminder for us they watch they say
[55:50] they watch Dracula movies they dress up
[55:52] like Dracula a blood sucking fornicator
[55:54] and murderer they they enjoy that that's
[55:56] what they say they watch filthy
[55:58] Hollywood movies they've named some of
[55:59] the movies I can't remember some of them
[56:00] now I can't remember I listen to their
[56:02] podcast they use cuss words um have
[56:05] filthy scenes murders more and they call
[56:08] and they and they say they're free in
[56:09] Christ they're in bondage to the enemy
[56:13] they frequently misinterpret quotes and
[56:15] uh they tell lies by their presumption
[56:17] about God's servant they say women can
[56:20] cut their hair yet Paul forbids it they
[56:22] say there's one work of Grace and
[56:24] basically say a child a four-year-old
[56:25] child who who says they believe in Jesus
[56:27] already filled with the Holy Ghost
[56:28] without any fruit to it see that that's
[56:31] just a few of them now what the Bible
[56:32] say the Bible said I found this a few
[56:34] weeks ago and I emailed to myself I
[56:35] thought oh I got to preach this he did
[56:37] that which was evil in the sight of the
[56:38] Lord is God and humbl not himself before
[56:41] Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the
[56:43] mouth of the Lord what did Brother Ram
[56:45] do he spoke from the mouth of God he
[56:49] told us thus sayith the Lord he told us
[56:51] thus sayi the Holy Spirit thus say the
[56:53] Bible he heard from from God's mouth and
[56:55] he told us and we have to Humble
[56:57] ourselves to accept the word of God but
[57:00] the accusers don't humble themselves
[57:02] aren't you glad you can humble yourself
[57:04] remember brother Ben preached on that
[57:05] that was a two- hour sermon that was a
[57:06] really good sermon
[57:08] Hallelujah then it says and the Lord God
[57:11] of their father sent to them by his
[57:14] Messengers so who's God going to send us
[57:16] a
[57:18] messenger how about a seven Church age
[57:20] messenger would that be okay because the
[57:23] Bible said there's ages
[57:26] and rising up be times and sending
[57:29] because why did God send brother brandom
[57:31] he had compassion on his people
[57:32] hallelujah and on his Dwelling Place
[57:35] Hallelujah
[57:36] Heaven no one has taught me more about
[57:39] Jesus God in heaven than William
[57:42] brandom I'm gonna say that again no one
[57:45] in this world has taught me more about
[57:47] Jesus God or heaven or the Angels
[57:49] anything other than William brandom why
[57:51] did God do that because he had
[57:53] compassion on me praise God
[57:55] he cared for
[57:56] me since the first time I ever heard his
[57:59] voice I was weeping and crying the first
[58:00] time I ever heard brother ad's voice
[58:02] just I never heard a man like that that
[58:04] knew Jesus so well Hallelujah
[58:09] Glory the Bible said God sends prophets
[58:12] because he has compassion on
[58:14] us think about that God sent brother Ram
[58:17] right uh in the middle of the the
[58:19] 60s right the sexual Revolution God sent
[58:23] his servant because God had compassion
[58:25] and God warned him don't you look at
[58:26] Marilyn and R don't you get mixed up in
[58:28] these uh Hollywoods and look look what
[58:30] it's caused
[58:31] today God's compassion sent brother
[58:34] Brandon to warn
[58:36] us now look at 16 here's what the
[58:39] accusers do today they mock The
[58:40] Messengers of God and they despise his
[58:43] words and misuse His prophets that's
[58:45] what they're doing today misusing the
[58:47] prophet right making presumptions lies
[58:50] fairy tales they're basically making up
[58:51] fairy tales until the Wrath of the Lord
[58:54] arose against against his people till
[58:56] there was no remedy so see the Bible
[58:58] says there's going to come a time when
[58:59] there's no more people going to be saved
[59:01] and that's when God comes
[59:03] back right fewer and fewer like the
[59:05] pyramid fewer and fewer people are going
[59:06] to get saved all the time that's okay
[59:08] I'm one of them praise God and I want to
[59:11] find somebody else that wants to be
[59:12] saved
[59:13] Hallelujah I want to try to influence
[59:15] somebody to get saved praise God but
[59:18] what would they do they won't take God's
[59:20] compassion they'll mock brother Bram

[59:23] scriptures and they'll misuse brother
[59:25] Ram that's what the Bible said but not
[59:28] us we're not that
[59:30] type speaking of John the Baptist the
[59:33] Bible said all the people that heard him
[59:34] and the publicans Justified God being
[59:37] baptized with the baptism of of
[59:39] John another words you declare God
[59:42] righteous when you're baptized in the
[59:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that ought
[59:45] to make somebody feel good in here
[59:46] praise God if you've been baptize in the
[59:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've
[59:50] said God you're right I'm taking your
[59:52] way cuz that's what they did when they
[59:55] heard John and believed John the Bible
[59:57] said they Justified God they declared
[59:59] God's way was righteous but the
[1:00:01] Pharisees and lawyers check that look at
[1:00:04] that the Pharisees and lawyers would not
[1:00:06] be baptized under John's
[1:00:08] baptism and all these accusers they're
[1:00:10] getting re-baptized in titles father son
[1:00:12] Holy Ghost they're rejecting the Bible
[1:00:14] baptism oh my but you and I have
[1:00:17] accepted God's counsel that's just like
[1:00:19] Revelation chapter 3 Jesus said I
[1:00:21] counsel of you to for you to buy gold
[1:00:24] tried in the fires hallelujah oh how
[1:00:26] many have taken jesus' advice tonight

[1:00:30] eyes now you can see now you can
[1:00:32] understand God's word hallelujah you've
[1:00:35] taken his
[1:00:36] counsel you've taken God's advice
[1:00:39] instead of Satan's lies amen that's what
[1:00:43] the Bible say in the days of John the
[1:00:44] Baptist all those that went out to see
[1:00:46] that uh that preacher with the camel's
[1:00:48] hair on eating
[1:00:49] Locust who's this preacher all those
[1:00:52] that obeyed the Bible said they
[1:00:54] Justified God they declared God God
[1:00:56] righteous and the Bible says they took
[1:00:59] God's counsel they took God's advice so
[1:01:01] God is obligated to save them praise God
[1:01:04] oh Church we're so saved hallelujah
[1:01:06] we're saved to the day of our Redemption
[1:01:08] praise
[1:01:09] God see the correct the correct baptism
[1:01:12] is God's counsel just like Acts 19 1-6
[1:01:16] magnifies the importance of correct
[1:01:17] water baptism
[1:01:19] hallelujah it's so important but the
[1:01:21] accusers won't be baptized or they'll be
[1:01:23] re-baptized in the the father son Holy
[1:01:25] Ghost without knowing there's one name
[1:01:26] to the father son Holy
[1:01:28] Ghost I remember this one uh I'm just
[1:01:31] going to skip down believe in the Lord
[1:01:33] your God so shall you be
[1:01:35] established believe His prophets so
[1:01:38] shall you
[1:01:40] prosper Hallelujah a church what is
[1:01:42] prosperity Prosperity is a life free
[1:01:44] from
[1:01:46] demons no matter you're rich or poor
[1:01:48] sickness or health as we said last week
[1:01:51] you're prospering as long as you're free
[1:01:53] from demonic addiction
[1:01:56] hallelujah
[1:01:58] hallelujah the Bible said I would that
[1:02:00] you prosper and healthy even as your
[1:02:01] soul Prosper so see the soul of a
[1:02:03] Believer is prospering it's fruitful
[1:02:06] it's bearing the nine fruits of the holy
[1:02:09] spirit so see spiritual Prosperity is
[1:02:11] accomplished by receiving God's prophets
[1:02:14] now my wife and I can see this plainly
[1:02:16] I'm sure Naomi those who've been around
[1:02:18] long enough when you see the separation
[1:02:19] with your old friends that don't follow
[1:02:21] the message and your message you can
[1:02:23] clearly see the Prosperity that the
[1:02:25] gospel brings we've seen it recently
[1:02:27] with friends that uh having adulteries
[1:02:29] and almost divorces and all kinds of
[1:02:31] finance things just it's it's so sad but
[1:02:35] see they cannot Prosper really until
[1:02:38] they obey the word of God until they
[1:02:40] accept God's
[1:02:41] counsel Hallelujah believe the Lord but
[1:02:44] believe his Messengers amen he sent that
[1:02:46] out of his compassion
[1:02:49] hallelujah it's God's compassion to give
[1:02:51] us a servant like brother bradam
[1:02:53] Hallelujah
[1:02:56] remember and I I preached this before
[1:02:57] I'm just going to go through this
[1:02:58] quickly there's 14 doctrines that Paul
[1:03:01] preached that most of these accusers
[1:03:03] reject that means they're not being
[1:03:06] washed that means they're
[1:03:08] dirty their garments are dirty the Bible
[1:03:10] said they're stained with sin we're
[1:03:13] supposed to hate our
[1:03:14] stains the Bible says hate even the
[1:03:17] staining of your garments is not natural
[1:03:19] I got a stain right here that's not what
[1:03:20] it's talking about it's spiritual
[1:03:22] stains it's addictions that people have
[1:03:24] in their lives evil
[1:03:28] desires and they say they're closer to
[1:03:31] God how can you be closer to God denying
[1:03:33] the gospel that God gave to to Paul
[1:03:36] right or Jesus Christ gave to Paul how
[1:03:37] can you be closer you
[1:03:40] can't right imagine some of you uh
[1:03:43] sisters you know I'll use sister Lena
[1:03:45] you know she's just freshly married
[1:03:46] imagine if she denied 14 requests from
[1:03:48] Brother Austin how do you think he'd
[1:03:49] feel I'll use her because she's freshly
[1:03:51] married she's got this all love and you
[1:03:52] know I love that that's a great feeling
[1:03:54] that Honeymoon Feeling right but how' I
[1:03:57] feel you know if if my wife or whatever
[1:04:00] know now now think about that with the
[1:04:01] church these churches that reject
[1:04:03] brother R's message 14 times are saying
[1:04:05] no Jesus no no we know better we can
[1:04:09] wash ourselves no you can't there's only
[1:04:11] one way to be washed that's by Christ
[1:04:13] the husband Hallelujah he is the Fuller
[1:04:16] soap as brother Brian preached amen
[1:04:19] Christ is the soap Hallelujah and he's
[1:04:21] the water
[1:04:23] Hallelujah that means four think about
[1:04:25] that 14 stains can I just just drop 1 2
[1:04:28] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 their garments
[1:04:31] are covered in
[1:04:33] stains but yours are washed
[1:04:36] white by the blood of Jesus
[1:04:40] Amen see some of them allow
[1:04:42] homosexuality adultery fornication
[1:04:43] murder through birth control pills women
[1:04:45] preachers substance abuse viewing sinful
[1:04:48] content shameful hair lengths false
[1:04:50] conversions immodest clothing which is
[1:04:52] most of them water baptism is wrong the
[1:04:54] three works of Grace they deny the
[1:04:56] godhead is one person the gifts of the
[1:04:58] Holy Ghost uh not
[1:05:00] crossdressing right now that's not
[1:05:01] Pauline but that's Moses Mosaic
[1:05:04] Hallelujah they're also under a Jezebel
[1:05:07] spirit because they don't uh they don't
[1:05:09] I'm sorry they support the Roman
[1:05:11] Catholic Church they're under a spirit
[1:05:12] of lust in other words they have a
[1:05:14] spirit of Pride they're deceivers they
[1:05:18] lie they have unclean spirits and these
[1:05:20] are all spirits of bondage how can that
[1:05:23] be prosperity I got news for them that's
[1:05:25] not Prosperity that's
[1:05:27] destruction that's ungodly and the Bible
[1:05:30] said if they say ungodly words against
[1:05:32] Jesus then God will condemn them for all
[1:05:34] their ungodly words ungodly Deeds with
[1:05:36] all their ungodly acts but you and I are
[1:05:40] Godly but we got the anointing of
[1:05:42] godliness
[1:05:43] Hallelujah now I'm trying to get to this
[1:05:45] I'm trying to close here yeah I'm trying
[1:05:47] to look and close by eight now by God's
[1:05:51] grace and I'm already at 42 minutes here
[1:05:54] here by God's grace now this is strange
[1:05:56] this may seem strange as to you um but
[1:05:59] this was the one that of of reading all
[1:06:01] these you know I think there's a time
[1:06:03] and season for all these I'm going to
[1:06:04] just read a few things out of here and I
[1:06:06] got I'm going to play a few things for
[1:06:07] you here I hope this will raise your
[1:06:09] faith here by God's grace just to see
[1:06:11] this testimony of a sister I believe
[1:06:13] she's still alive I'm not mistaken I
[1:06:15] went and looked for a testimony and I
[1:06:16] listened to it today there's about an
[1:06:17] hourong testimony listen on double speed
[1:06:19] there
[1:06:22] uh but it seemed like she's still live I
[1:06:24] don't know um anyways uh sister Betty
[1:06:27] Collins Phillips now she's the daughter
[1:06:29] of the former Pastor Willard Collins so
[1:06:32] this is the order brother random went
[1:06:34] off the scene brother Neville was Pastor
[1:06:36] after brother Neville I think brother
[1:06:37] Collins took over now brother cols was a
[1:06:40] tape guy unashamed about it okay so of
[1:06:44] course we would differ with him but when
[1:06:46] I listened to her testimony she she kept
[1:06:48] saying read your Bible listen to the
[1:06:49] tapes and pray I thought well that's
[1:06:51] good but of course she believes in you
[1:06:53] know tape churches anything like that
[1:06:54] but that's okay we can agree to disagree
[1:06:57] by God's grace but at least she said
[1:06:58] read the Bible that's the first time
[1:06:59] I've heard that that was the first time
[1:07:01] I've heard that testimony um and with
[1:07:04] all due respect now in the book these
[1:07:06] are the pictures in the book I just kind
[1:07:07] of took them with my phone and put them
[1:07:08] on there so you can see them a little
[1:07:09] closer now there's a quite a testimony
[1:07:12] behind this picture that's her senior
[1:07:13] year picture and this is her
[1:07:16] now and I'll just try to rehearse this
[1:07:18] the best I can maybe this will speak to
[1:07:19] Lydia so Lydia wink wink here so uh in
[1:07:22] her senior year
[1:07:24] every girl in the high school had to
[1:07:27] wear uh the the the I think the shaw off
[1:07:31] the shoulder so everybody all the girls
[1:07:33] had to expose their shoulders and show
[1:07:36] all this area up here which we would
[1:07:37] call
[1:07:39] immodesty and she got up there and the
[1:07:41] the photographer said no you've got to
[1:07:43] take that off and she said no and her
[1:07:45] mom said no we're paying for this and he
[1:07:48] in other words he said so I'm like
[1:07:49] you're you're going to pay for it you're
[1:07:50] going to pay for it with with rebukes
[1:07:52] and making fun so she was the only girl
[1:07:54] in her entire senior class who wore a
[1:07:57] modest clothes like
[1:07:59] that okay she said in her testimony she
[1:08:02] got made fun of up and down the
[1:08:05] hallways and everything like that uh her
[1:08:08] senior year but during her senior year
[1:08:10] she took a she had a contest of sewing
[1:08:12] that's how it connects in here and uh
[1:08:16] she got third place at I think at the
[1:08:18] state
[1:08:19] level um and they said the only reason
[1:08:22] she didn't get first was because she
[1:08:23] didn't wear we uh that Shaw she didn't
[1:08:25] wear the shaw down where you could see
[1:08:27] her shoulders but she said then she had
[1:08:30] some other there was another event she
[1:08:31] joined and she won first prize and she
[1:08:34] said since and then brother Braham came
[1:08:36] to her and told her see Betty God God
[1:08:39] let you in there because you stood for
[1:08:41] him in your modest picture brother Raam
[1:08:44] said that was that's what God did and
[1:08:46] she said that true she said ever since
[1:08:47] she got out of school and and did some
[1:08:49] different jobs she said since she
[1:08:50] started her sewing business she said
[1:08:52] only through Word of Mouth she is she
[1:08:54] said I have so much business she's in
[1:08:55] her got in her 80s or 90s here she's
[1:08:58] never been able to catch up she has so
[1:09:00] much business and she used the testimony
[1:09:02] if you honor God in the small things God
[1:09:04] will honor you in the big
[1:09:06] things she said she can never catch up
[1:09:08] on all the work it's just by Word of
[1:09:10] Mouth people want to support her because
[1:09:12] she's tooken a stand for the word of God
[1:09:15] and she said her hair goes uh down
[1:09:18] touches the floor and is two inches on
[1:09:19] the
[1:09:21] floor and she worked at the bank for
[1:09:23] years and the the said you got to cut it
[1:09:24] and she said you're not touching me I
[1:09:26] don't she said I don't tell you what to
[1:09:28] wear she said you try to touch me I'm
[1:09:30] walking out the door and she she said
[1:09:33] they honored it and when she left she
[1:09:34] said the president of the bank she said
[1:09:35] she broke all these records on sales or
[1:09:37] whatever at Banks I don't know I'm not a
[1:09:38] bank I'm not a tell her but she said
[1:09:41] because of God's mercy and blessing she
[1:09:43] broke all those records and the
[1:09:44] president even wrote and said you are
[1:09:45] such an asset to our company we you we
[1:09:48] were so blessed because you were here
[1:09:50] and so there just she attributes all
[1:09:52] this to obeying the message that brother
[1:09:55] random preached refusing to compromise
[1:09:59] on IM I'm sorry immodesty or hair length
[1:10:01] or anything like that she that's her
[1:10:03] testimony all right so um that's a
[1:10:08] little testimony there now she saw some
[1:10:10] other Miracles let me read this one here
[1:10:11] that's right out of the book here
[1:10:16] um I have attended brandham Tabernacle
[1:10:19] since I was 10 years old except for five
[1:10:20] years we lived in Tucson from 1964 to
[1:10:22] 1969 and I've seen many healings I
[1:10:25] vividly remember that there was a girl
[1:10:26] that couldn't walk that came to church
[1:10:28] and it looked like the joints of her
[1:10:30] fingers were being drawn back into her
[1:10:33] body brother ranom prayed for her and
[1:10:35] immediately she got up and
[1:10:37] walked so she you know all the joints
[1:10:39] you know curled up in the body but she
[1:10:42] said she instantly saw the girl come
[1:10:44] come back to
[1:10:46] Ho so that's why if you hear a testimony
[1:10:48] brother man would tell her don't do this
[1:10:49] don't do that she's like I'll never do
[1:10:50] it brother man I'll never do it I'll
[1:10:51] never she had such respect for that man
[1:10:55] because of the gift of God right and
[1:10:58] here's another one um she saw or she
[1:11:03] um she was there when uh brother Edmund
[1:11:06] way died in the service and God rais him
[1:11:10] back up and I'm gonna play it right here
[1:11:12] uh I think it should be loud enough for
[1:11:21] this it's going come here
[1:11:27] that'll be
[1:11:34] louder that's brother Edmund Way's
[1:11:36] Edmund Way's wife she cries

[1:11:51] put this up here uh case would you just
[1:11:55] put this up here let's see if this will
[1:11:58] work kind of going out on a limb here I
[1:12:00] thought maybe you like to see
[1:12:03] it there we go that's probably at least
[1:12:05] you can see the words so he goes down
[1:12:08] prays for him give him back Lord give
[1:12:10] him back strength and
[1:12:13] health so help
[1:12:15] me to start heart started beating again

[1:12:31] this altar where funerals has been
[1:12:33] preached where I stand

[1:12:40] like he died his pulse was gone and no
[1:12:42] more called in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:44] and his pulse started coming
[1:12:46] back as a minister of the cross I say
[1:12:49] that in the name of Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ Hallelujah

[1:13:05] so she was there and the testimony was
[1:13:07] the woman that cried out was Edmund
[1:13:08] Way's wife because she's a nurse and she
[1:13:12] her husband fell over and she checked
[1:13:14] his pulse no pulse brother R said he
[1:13:15] went down to her down to him his eyes
[1:13:17] were set back no Pauls R said I call
[1:13:20] upon in the name of Jesus Christ let me
[1:13:21] find that words exact words he said

[1:13:34] brother way in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:35] may he come back give him back Lord give
[1:13:37] him strength and health that was the
[1:13:39] prayer and God brought the man back to
[1:13:42] life

[1:13:45] hear Brother Bram shouting or Screaming

[1:15:25] was sitting about five rows from the
[1:15:26] back and on the same side where it
[1:15:28] appeared wow two girls that I knew were
[1:15:31] sitting nearby and they had been telling
[1:15:33] some jokes that were not very good then
[1:15:35] or they told me later that when that
[1:15:37] light appeared over their heads they
[1:15:38] thought they were going to fall over
[1:15:40] dead as the light changed shapes marking
[1:15:43] the different stages of the church ages
[1:15:44] you could feel the presence of the Lord
[1:15:46] in the
[1:15:47] building
[1:15:49] Hallelujah brother BR prophesied and
[1:15:51] told her sister Betty you will meet the
[1:15:52] right boy out west and I'm going to be
[1:15:54] sitting in your living room one day
[1:15:56] while him I'm sorry with him while you
[1:15:59] cook steaks for us in the kitchen so she
[1:16:02] said after that she always kept staks in
[1:16:03] her freezer at all times and it came to
[1:16:05] pass she married a man James Phillips it
[1:16:08] came to pass exactly as brother BR said
[1:16:10] think about that
[1:16:13] hallelujah oh it's
[1:16:15] beautiful now the sad part is you know
[1:16:17] it's near tape worship they you know
[1:16:18] they close the testimony saying I know
[1:16:20] that every answer we need is on the
[1:16:21] tapes yeah
[1:16:23] we could be but really every an is in
[1:16:26] the Bible that we need right I mean I
[1:16:28] understand I understand what they're
[1:16:29] saying he said for the tape she said for
[1:16:32] the tapes are the spiritual food that
[1:16:33] has been soared up for us now I believe
[1:16:35] that but I don't believe every single
[1:16:37] word on there is from God she said we
[1:16:40] just need to stay with the tapes well
[1:16:42] brother Braham said we just need to stay
[1:16:43] with the Bible right so I understand
[1:16:46] what they're saying and I agree we got
[1:16:48] to stay with all the scriptures on the
[1:16:50] tapes right but that'll always point us
[1:16:52] back to the the word of God so I try to
[1:16:54] say it with love and grace in my heart
