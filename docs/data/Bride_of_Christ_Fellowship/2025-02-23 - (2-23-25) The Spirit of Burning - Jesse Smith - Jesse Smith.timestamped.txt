[10:19] prayer requests okay so we want to uh
[10:21] lift up uh everybody my wife thanks you

[35:05] Saints said amen God bless you you can
[35:08] take your Bibles let's stand here let's
[35:10] go to Isaiah chapter 4 as I told you on
[35:12] Wednesday this is a my sermon I just
[35:14] want to preach a just a regular
[35:16] preaching sermon by God's grace now you
[35:19] know I'm going to mix some teaching in
[35:20] here but it's mainly going to be
[35:21] preaching today uh by God's grace trying
[35:23] to learn how to catch the thoughts of
[35:26] God Isaiah 4 and we'll just read verse 4
[35:29] Isaiah 4:4 if I had a title this morning
[35:31] I'd like to preach on the spirit of
[35:33] burning I'd like to preach on that this
[35:34] morning the spirit of burning Isaiah 4
[35:44] verse4 so as I was studying this week
[35:46] and reading through the book of Isaiah
[35:48] last few weeks here I saw this phrase
[35:50] and I thought oh my it's a
[35:52] spirit it's an attribute of the Holy
[35:55] Spirit I said I'd like to preach this to
[35:57] the church as soon as I read that
[35:58] thought about all these scriptures here
[36:00] so we'll try to preach this here by the
[36:02] grace of God hallelujah I know the
[36:04] spirit of burning is here hallelujah
[36:06] because I feel it burning in my heart
[36:07] Hallelujah so the spirit of God is here
[36:09] hallelujah he promised me wherever two
[36:10] or three are gathered there I am right
[36:12] there in the midst
[36:14] Hallelujah Isaiah
[36:17] 4:4 if you're there say amen amen we'll
[36:20] just read that one verse and then have
[36:22] you be seated by God's grace let me set
[36:23] my
[36:26] timer Isaiah
[36:31] 4:4 let's read that if we can on three 1
[36:34] 2 3 when the Lord shall have washed away
[36:38] the filth of the daughters of Zion and
[36:41] shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
[36:44] from the midst thereof by the spirit of
[36:47] judgment and by the spirit of burning
[36:50] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[36:52] of his word you can be seated
[36:55] Hallelujah so even just as I'm reading
[36:57] that you know I'm recognizing here you
[36:58] see the spirit of judgment which would
[37:00] be likely discernment and then the
[37:02] spirit of Burning uh by the grace of God
[37:05] so today Lord willing we'll just look at
[37:07] here the spirit of burning this is the
[37:10] phrase that kind of struck out to me uh
[37:12] and I read it a few weeks ago and I've
[37:14] been studying on it off and on and
[37:15] writing down all my thoughts uh as the
[37:17] spirit of God would Quicken it to us
[37:19] here so I'll start there in Isaiah
[37:21] chapter 4 so if you could just stay
[37:23] there in Isaiah 4 we'll read through
[37:24] this chapter uh by God's grace we'll
[37:27] start at vers verse one to kind of
[37:28] understand the context and I found out
[37:30] brother brandom said one time brother BR
[37:32] said the spirit of burning one time in
[37:34] the message the future home brother the
[37:37] future home so brother man reads this
[37:39] scripture and he it takes him to the
[37:42] Future home so let's read this again
[37:44] Ephesians I'm sorry sorry Isaiah 4
[37:48] vers1 Isaiah 4 vers1 and in that day
[37:51] seven women shall take hold of one man
[37:54] saying we will eat our own bread and and
[37:57] wear our own apparel only let us be
[38:00] called by thy name and to take away our
[38:04] reproach verse two in that day shall the
[38:07] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[38:09] glorious I think about that Israel right
[38:12] think of Israel in that day and the
[38:15] fruit of the Earth shall be excellent
[38:17] and calmly for them that are escaped of
[38:21] Israel verse three and it shall come to
[38:23] pass that he that is left in Zion and he
[38:26] that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[38:27] Called holy even everyone that is
[38:30] written among the living in
[38:32] Jerusalem so here's how they become holy
[38:35] right here's how Israel shall be become
[38:37] holy here we'd say in the tribulation
[38:40] period when God is done cuts off the
[38:42] Gentiles and goes back to the Jews verse
[38:44] four when the Lord shall have washed
[38:46] away the filth of the daughters of Zion
[38:48] and shall Purge the blood of Jerusalem
[38:50] from the midst thereof by the spirit of
[38:52] judgment and by the spirit of burning
[38:55] verse five and the Lord will create upon
[38:57] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion now
[38:59] look at that every dwelling
[39:01] place right so we have uh we know we
[39:05] have Mount Zion right but then we also
[39:06] have Mount Mariah we have those two
[39:08] mountains right where the Lord was
[39:10] crucified right so God specifically says
[39:13] Mount Zion the Lord will create upon
[39:15] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion
[39:17] remember Mount Zion was a little bit
[39:18] larger Hill or Mountain there right next
[39:21] to uh the mount Mariah where the Lord
[39:24] off of that mount was the Lord crucified
[39:27] right there there in Jerusalem and upon
[39:29] her assembly is a cloud and smoke by day
[39:32] and The Shining of the flaming fire by
[39:34] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[39:37] defense amen so we see the pillar of
[39:40] fire is there with Israel during the
[39:42] Millennium and the church said the
[39:44] pillar of fire was with them when they
[39:46] came out of Egypt right fou them all the
[39:47] way Hallelujah LED them all the way to
[39:49] the promised land and here we see the
[39:51] pillar of fire is back with Israel in
[39:54] the Millennium here after of course
[39:56] after the fire of God has washed their
[39:58] lives clean Hallelujah verse six and
[40:01] there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow
[40:03] in the
[40:03] daytime from the Heat and for a place of
[40:07] refuge and for a covert from storm and
[40:11] from rain so the pillar of fire will be
[40:13] a fire at times and then there'll be a
[40:15] cloud at times so it shows God is going
[40:18] to bring Israel back to the condition
[40:20] that they were in as far as the visible
[40:22] power of God the visible spirit of God
[40:25] is going to be there to be with Israel
[40:27] just as he was with Moses hallelujah
[40:29] what a blessing Hallelujah now let's go
[40:31] back to verse one let me lay this in
[40:34] here verse one did you know this brother
[40:37] Ram said verse one is about the Gentiles
[40:39] in the church age does anybody everybody
[40:41] remember that brother Ram talked about
[40:42] that verse one and in that day seven
[40:45] women brother mam said that's seven
[40:46] Church
[40:48] ages he said shall take hold of one man
[40:50] who's that man
[40:52] Christ saying we will eat our own bread
[40:55] in other words we don't want the bread
[40:56] of God we don't want Jesus bread we want
[40:58] a a Creed bread right we don't want we
[41:01] don't want your bread and we'll wear our
[41:03] own clothes or lack of
[41:05] clothes right they don't want to wear
[41:07] holy clothes and they don't now that's
[41:08] natural but what about spiritual they
[41:10] don't want the righteousness of Christ
[41:12] so they got their own food they got
[41:14] their own wardrobe brother man said we
[41:16] should have a clothline religion
[41:17] Hallelujah right you you should wear you
[41:20] should wear minus clothes that cover
[41:22] right don't sisters don't expose your
[41:24] shoulders Brothers don't do that either
[41:26] right cover from your shoulders down to
[41:28] your sins
[41:29] Hallelujah we got the we got the
[41:31] understanding of that that we don't want
[41:32] to show nakedness to the
[41:34] world only let us be called by thy name
[41:37] to take away our reproach so all these
[41:39] churches they know they're living in sin
[41:41] they don't want to eat God's word they
[41:43] don't want God's righteousness right
[41:44] these seven women these seven Church
[41:46] agents they don't want the word of God
[41:47] they want to wear sexy clothes or lack
[41:49] of clothes they want to strip down but
[41:51] they still want to be called by
[41:52] Christian
[41:53] name
[41:55] right to take away their
[41:58] reproach now brother man of course tells
[42:01] us are they is this the true church no
[42:03] brother M tells us this is the false
[42:06] church so the false Gentile churches
[42:09] Chris you've been to some right lately
[42:10] we've been to some they they want the
[42:12] name of Jesus but they won't take on the
[42:15] bread of Jesus they won't put on the
[42:16] clothes that Jesus wants them to wear
[42:18] Hallelujah see that by God's grace they
[42:21] want the name of Jesus but they don't
[42:23] want uh the Life of Christ how many want
[42:25] the Life of Christ today now what's
[42:27] interesting is of course as you know if
[42:29] You' read the church age book brother
[42:30] Braham said as Jesus talked down to the
[42:32] church ages he was always talking to
[42:34] both groups the True Vine and the false
[42:36] Vine I'm talking about Revelation
[42:38] Chapter 2 and three when he would
[42:39] address the seven
[42:41] churches so I hope I hope this will help
[42:44] people by God's grace brother R said he
[42:46] said keep in mind that religion is
[42:50] composed of two parts that intertwine
[42:52] but are as opposite as black and white
[42:56] religion and the spiritual world are
[42:58] made up of these two trees which had
[43:00] their roots in Eden both the tree of
[43:02] life and the tree of knowledge good and
[43:03] evil still in the midst of the garden
[43:04] and no doubt their very branches
[43:06] intertwin each other what a thought that
[43:08] is see the it's so close the deception
[43:12] is so close it might even deceive the
[43:14] very elected but it won't deceive the
[43:16] elect Hallelujah but see how close the
[43:18] true is from the false their branches in
[43:21] Twingle I'm sorry in in in intertwin
[43:25] sorry inter Twingle that's a new word
[43:27] did I make a new word maybe it'll be the
[43:28] word of
[43:29] 2025 no let's not
[43:32] intertwine now intertwine he says thus
[43:35] in the Ephesian church is that same
[43:37] Paradox the church is made up of good
[43:39] and bad two Vines make the church
[43:42] they're like the wheat and the tears
[43:43] growing up side by side but one is the
[43:45] true the other is the false now God will
[43:48] speak to each one and will'll talk about
[43:50] each one he will but he will call them
[43:52] the church so that's why he said to the
[43:55] Church of Ephesus and notice he rebuked
[43:58] the Church of Ephesus for one thing they
[44:00] left their first love but Church let's
[44:01] be spiritual that wasn't the True Vine
[44:03] that left their first love it was the
[44:05] false Vine Hallelujah this is going to
[44:08] help somebody out if you really catch
[44:09] the revelation of this Hallelujah but
[44:12] they're so close he's got to speak to
[44:14] both because both want his name both
[44:16] claim his name that's why brother R said
[44:19] judas's name was on the book of life
[44:21] because he claimed to believe in Jesus
[44:22] but then it was blotted out because he
[44:24] betrayed the Lord he blasphemed the holy
[44:27] Spirit but see anyone who calls upon the
[44:29] name of the Lord right if they call on
[44:31] it if they claim to be a Christian their
[44:33] name's written in the book of life but
[44:34] if they don't obey the words of Christ
[44:36] their names can be blotted
[44:38] out right until you're born again but if
[44:41] you get born again then it proves your
[44:43] name was never on The Book of Life your
[44:45] name was on the Lamb's Book of Life two
[44:48] different sections brother Chris in the
[44:49] same book it's like two chapters in the
[44:52] same book you got the book of life and
[44:53] then you've got the Lamb's Book of Life
[44:56] because there's two kinds of Christians
[44:57] Hallelujah there's foolish Christians
[44:59] and there's also wise virgin Christians
[45:02] hallelujah hallelujah that's right it's
[45:04] so
[45:05] true and so uh brother R quotes Matthew
[45:09] 24:24 there shall AR arise false Christ
[45:12] and false prophets and show great signs
[45:14] and wonders in in in so much that if it
[45:16] were possible they shall deceive the
[45:18] very
[45:19] elect Hallelujah now I want to keep he
[45:22] he says it again here uh I want to read
[45:24] through this uh by God's grace you can
[45:26] see it he mentions it twice at least
[45:27] twice in the church age
[45:30] book sorry I lost my spot
[45:35] there this thing kind of jumps around if
[45:37] I tap the wrong thing so pardon me here
[45:39] let me get down to this
[45:41] quote there it
[45:44] is brother B said I've been saying right
[45:46] all along that there are actually two
[45:49] churches though the spirit speaks to
[45:51] both of them in each age as though they
[45:53] were but one Hallelujah he says what
[45:57] what churches will be those that do not
[45:58] know the truth of course it is the false
[46:01] Vine group because the True Believers
[46:02] certainly know that judgment begins
[46:05] where at the house of the Lord amen and
[46:07] they being God-fearing judge themselves
[46:10] that they be not judged so that's why we
[46:13] come to church we come to church to hear
[46:15] the word of God of course worship praise
[46:16] God but we hear that we come also that
[46:18] God would help us to judge our lives so
[46:21] we can get the the wrong sinful things
[46:23] out and get the right things in the
[46:25] anointings of of Christ Hallelujah
[46:27] we want the anointing of God that's why
[46:29] we come for the spirit of judgment and
[46:31] the spirit of burning we're look at that
[46:34] here today now why does God call these
[46:36] churches his churches even though
[46:37] they're false Vine the truth of the
[46:40] matter is that they are Christians they
[46:42] are not Christians of the spirit they're
[46:43] Christians of the
[46:45] flesh Hallelujah like all these churches
[46:48] we've seen that fall fall away they're
[46:49] just Christians in the flesh they don't
[46:51] have the real holy spirit because if you
[46:54] had the real Holy Spirit it would
[46:55] produce the life of Jesus
[46:57] Christ right you you'd eat the bread of
[46:59] God you'd wear the right clothes You'
[47:03] judge your life clean you let the fire
[47:05] of God burn out the sin in your life yes
[47:09] they're bearing the name in vain as Mark
[47:11] 7:7 brother reads this verse how be it
[47:14] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[47:16] doctrines the Commandments of men but
[47:20] indeed they are Christians for what else
[47:21] could they be a muhammadan or a Muslim
[47:23] is a Muslim that's his religion no
[47:25] matter how he lives it because he
[47:26] subscri rbes in theory to what the Quran
[47:29] teaches but brother says all these false
[47:32] findes he's a nominal Christian and
[47:34] belongs to the church but he's not a
[47:36] true or spiritual believer that kind of
[47:39] believer is one who's been baptized into
[47:41] the body of Christ and is a member of
[47:43] him but nonetheless it is God's order
[47:45] that the tears grow up with the wheat
[47:46] and they're not to be uprooted that is
[47:48] the command of God their day for binding
[47:50] and burning is coming but not
[47:53] yet Hallelujah wow what a blessing by
[47:56] God's grace
[47:58] now just apply this now to our church
[48:01] age we're not going to go there but
[48:02] Revelation 3:14 through 22 when Jesus
[48:06] says you're lukewarm and I know your
[48:08] Works he's not speaking to the True Vine
[48:11] and the church
[48:12] said if you can catch that you'll leave
[48:14] here a happy person if you can catch
[48:17] that you'll leave here and you'll be
[48:18] happy to keep doing the works of Christ
[48:22] Hallelujah he because he's speaking to
[48:24] both both groups the truth seven women
[48:27] and then the false seven women he's
[48:29] speaking to both at the same time Glory
[48:31] Church you can't be a lukewarm Holy
[48:33] Ghost filled Christian you're either
[48:35] lukewarm and not born again or you're
[48:37] baptized with the Holy Ghost and you're
[48:38] hot and on fire
[48:40] Hallelujah God help us amen God help us
[48:43] to catch the Revelation here
[48:45] hallelujah he's talking to the false
[48:48] vine when he says you're lukewarm and
[48:50] your Works you're spewed out of my mouth
[48:53] Jesus says and you say you have no more
[48:56] need of God how many say today I need
[48:58] more of God that proves you're not the
[49:00] false Vine the false Vine says I don't
[49:03] need it I'm going to come to church I'll
[49:05] come to church anyway but I'm not going
[49:06] to get nothing out of it I'm just going
[49:08] to criticize or I'm just going to pull
[49:10] the service down but the true seed of
[49:12] God want more of God they create a
[49:14] spiritual atmosphere where the spirit of
[49:16] God can move
[49:17] Hallelujah that's right Glory they say
[49:21] oh I don't need more of God I'm rich and
[49:22] increased with goods and yet Jesus says
[49:24] you're blind miserable wretched and
[49:27] naked so Church you're not blind
[49:29] miserable wretched or naked if you're in
[49:32] love with Christ and you're truly born
[49:34] again he wasn't speaking to you when he
[49:36] said that he was speaking to you when he
[49:38] said you're hot and you have taken my
[49:41] counsel Hallelujah there's some people
[49:43] today that have taken the counsel of
[49:45] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you've got
[49:48] isav on your eyes so now you can see the
[49:50] truth of the church ages glory to God
[49:52] you put on a white robe of righteousness
[49:54] you're living in the righteousness of
[49:57] Jesus Christ
[49:59] Hallelujah yes hallelujah it's so true
[50:02] and you've got the gold you've got the
[50:05] the the Christlike character the -
[50:07] tested uh battle proven character of
[50:10] Jesus Christ it's gold uh Faith that's
[50:13] been tried in the fires of Affliction
[50:16] and suffering
[50:17] hallelujah amen but the thing most today
[50:21] people mainly today they suffer because
[50:23] of their own
[50:24] sins but if see if you live close to God
[50:27] you won't suffer as much for your own
[50:29] sin you'll suffer for persecution or
[50:31] trials that people come against you
[50:34] right so if you're suffering for your
[50:36] own sins that's not what we're talking
[50:37] about we're talking about the Christlike
[50:39] character that goes through uh that
[50:41] becomes gold through the fiery trials
[50:43] that you go through because you are
[50:45] obedient to God's
[50:48] word and church if you're the bride of
[50:50] Christ then you have opened the door to
[50:52] Jesus you heard Jesus knocking and say
[50:54] can I come in and S with you how many
[50:56] you heard that knock today I hope that's
[50:58] why you're here today not by just a
[51:00] religious uh observance but you're here
[51:02] because you want Jesus to come in and Su
[51:04] with you Hallelujah and then your
[51:07] promise if you have all this then you
[51:09] will overcome and you'll sit down with
[51:12] Jesus in his throne hallelujah what a
[51:16] promise by the grace of God Amen now
[51:19] Isaiah back to Isaiah 4 verse two so
[51:21] hopefully now in verse one you can see
[51:22] the seven Church
[51:24] ages that's why if you're a Christian
[51:25] you better dress with right you better
[51:27] Feast on the word of God hallelujah
[51:31] watch your diet make sure you're eating
[51:32] the things of God enjoying the things of
[51:34] God nothing could taste better than the
[51:36] the words of God hallelujah the bread of
[51:38] God that's right verse two in that day
[51:42] shall the branch of the Lord be
[51:44] beautiful and glorious speaking of
[51:46] Israel and the fruit of the Earth shall
[51:47] be exellent calmly for them that are
[51:49] escaped of
[51:51] Israel okay so what what's that day
[51:54] speaking of when Israel gets B gathered
[51:56] back and church you know their na their
[51:58] land natural is very fruitful Israel is
[52:01] a major exporter of goods uh they have
[52:03] some of the greatest technology in the
[52:05] whole world they've got the Iron Dome
[52:06] right they've got the Iron Dome that it
[52:09] it caught and destroyed almost all of
[52:10] those I forget how many thousands of
[52:12] missiles that Iran shot at them or the
[52:14] Hamas shot at them but it intercepted
[52:16] almost every single one of them and they
[52:18] even recognized it's a miracle right God
[52:21] still doing miracles for Israel but see
[52:24] God is going to build up Israel and it's
[52:27] those that escape out of Israel right
[52:30] it's for those that escape it's those
[52:32] who who don't become a part of the One
[52:34] World system so I believe this verse is
[52:36] speaking of those that escape during the
[52:39] Great Tribulation period they'll escape
[52:41] the mark of the beast they'll Escape uh
[52:44] all the Gathering Together of the armies
[52:46] against the true Israel praise God verse
[52:49] four I'm sorry verse three it should
[52:50] come to pass that he that's left in Zion
[52:52] and remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[52:54] Called holy even everyone that's written
[52:55] among the living and
[52:57] so I believe this is for the 144,000
[52:59] Jews who
[53:01] survive uh and they will stand with
[53:03] Jesus on Mount Zion as the Book of
[53:06] Revelation says hallelujah they're
[53:09] literally going to stand on Mount Zion
[53:11] right that's right that's to the let's
[53:13] say it'd be to the west of Mount Mariah
[53:16] that that wonderful Mountain Mount Zion
[53:19] Hallelujah they're going to stand there
[53:21] with Jesus and they'll escape the things
[53:23] of this world praise God now verse four
[53:26] is where we been looking at here the
[53:27] Lord shall have washed away so see when
[53:30] when the Lord has washed away the filth
[53:32] of the daughters of Zion and have purged
[53:34] the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
[53:36] thereof by the spirit of judgment and
[53:38] the spirit of burning remember friends
[53:40] Jesus said the blood will be upon Jews
[53:43] hands for his
[53:45] crucifixion right because they they
[53:47] actually said L they they said oh let
[53:49] his blood be upon us and our
[53:51] children so there's got to come a time
[53:54] where God washes that guilty blood off
[53:56] of off of Israel and it's going to
[53:58] happen here during the tribulation
[54:00] period Hallelujah God promised it how
[54:03] many know he promised it save your spot
[54:06] there go to Daniel chapter
[54:08] n don't forget church there's a six-fold
[54:11] purpose of Gabriel's visit to
[54:15] Daniel and that the one of the purposes
[54:17] is to wash away all their
[54:24] sins Gabriel comes to give Daniel
[54:27] understanding in Daniel chapter
[54:28] 9 and in verse 24 he says 70 weeks are
[54:32] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[54:34] Holy City to finish the transgression so
[54:35] here's what it is here's what God's
[54:37] going to do during the tribulation he's
[54:38] going to finish Israel's transgressions
[54:41] against
[54:42] God think of all the times they've
[54:44] rejected Christ think of all the time
[54:46] all these years they've rejected
[54:48] Christ he's going to make an end of
[54:50] their sins God's going to bring it to an
[54:52] end you're no longer going to be in sin
[54:54] now you can serve me
[54:56] and to make
[54:58] reconciliation for
[55:00] iniquity right for 2,000 years they've
[55:02] had iniquity uh they they've gone
[55:04] against the the fact that Jesus is the
[55:06] Messiah but Jesus is going to come and
[55:09] he's going to do these six things so
[55:11] that Israel can be a place like Isaiah
[55:13] said it's a place where all the sin has
[55:16] been washed away Hallelujah that's right
[55:20] it's thus sayth the scripture and then
[55:22] uh finishing verse 24 to bring in
[55:24] Everlasting righteousness that's the
[55:26] Millennium
[55:27] righteousness Jesus is going to make an
[55:29] end to their sin they're no longer blind
[55:32] they no longer are guilty of anything
[55:34] but now they can serve God hallelujah
[55:37] and now he says they have everlasting
[55:39] righteousness God accepts Israel and to
[55:42] seal up the vision and prophecy and
[55:44] anoint the most holy
[55:48] Hallelujah so that's what Jesus is going
[55:50] to do for uh Israel during the Great
[55:53] Tribulation period now how many know
[55:54] there's been Whispers amongst our new
[55:55] leaders ship in Washington about
[55:57] rebuilding the Third Temple Church we
[55:59] got to keep watching that I told my wife
[56:02] last night I heard one of the officials
[56:03] one of the new officials uh for
[56:05] president Trump say that their aim is to
[56:08] rebuild that Third Temple Church if that
[56:10] happens I told my wife we're going to
[56:11] have nightly prayer meetings on Zoom
[56:13] Hallelujah because if that if that
[56:16] Temple starts getting rebuilt then we
[56:17] know the coming of the Lord is at hand
[56:19] hallelujah it's thus sayith the Lord
[56:21] Brother Raam says and the because the
[56:23] Bible says that they're going to rebuild
[56:26] that Temple Hallelujah so let's keep our
[56:28] eyes watching let's keep watching and
[56:29] praying
[56:30] Hallelujah that's
[56:32] right and that that's what Jesus that's
[56:35] what the spirit of God will do in the
[56:36] Great Tribulation period it'll make an
[56:38] end it'll bring in Everlasting
[56:40] righteousness and seal up the vision in
[56:42] the prophecy and anoint the most holy
[56:44] brother Raam says what that means is
[56:46] Jesus doesn't need anointed he said but
[56:48] the millennial Temple needs Anointed
[56:50] with Jesus being there Hallelujah and so
[56:53] once once Jesus of course uh reveals
[56:56] himself to the 144,000 they get the
[56:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh then during
[57:00] the Millennium we have the Battle of arm
[57:02] again then after that during uh the
[57:04] Millennium they build a new Temple and
[57:06] then Jesus will step inside that Temple
[57:08] and now these 70 weeks are finished
[57:11] Hallelujah and now there's Everlasting
[57:13] righteousness in Jerusalem Hallelujah
[57:17] just like it's
[57:18] prophesied now what's going to do it
[57:21] it's the spirit of judgment and the
[57:23] spirit of burning that's a long way to
[57:25] get around to the
[57:26] topic here but I just thought I'd lay
[57:28] that in there it's the spirit of
[57:30] judgment and the spirit of burning all
[57:33] these people are like oh don't judge me
[57:34] don't judge me uh the Bible's the Bible
[57:37] says grow in judgment even nature wrote
[57:38] me that verse remember a few weeks ago
[57:40] nature I kept that little letter she she
[57:42] quoted Philippians where Philippians
[57:43] says Paul says I pray for you that
[57:45] you'll grow in judgment and knowledge of
[57:47] the Lord Jesus Christ they say don't
[57:50] judge me I say you already judge
[57:51] yourself right oh I can't judge you but
[57:54] you can judge me
[57:57] the very people saying don't judge me
[57:58] are the ones judging and like I told uh
[58:01] a brother recently I said it's I'm not
[58:04] judging your Eternal destination I'm
[58:06] judging your fruits and we're supposed
[58:08] to judge fruits Hallelujah by their
[58:10] fruits they are
[58:12] known Hallelujah and so the Holy Spirit
[58:15] brings judgment it brings a discernment
[58:18] this is right or this is wrong that's
[58:20] what the spirit does it will show Israel
[58:22] they they're wrong in these things and
[58:24] then it'll bring the spirit of burning
[58:25] on on them now in the future home
[58:28] brother R reads
[58:33] this and then he reads Isaiah
[58:37] 4:4 he says and this is paragraph 387
[58:40] for those if you might read the future
[58:42] home that's always God's judgment when
[58:44] he makes his final judgment he calls you
[58:46] now look what brother applies this to he
[58:48] calls you he justifies you he brings you
[58:52] to Redemption then his judgment breaks
[58:55] forth upon on you and the Holy Ghost and
[58:58] Fire cleanses away the sin then you're
[59:03] his that's what brother said about verse
[59:05] four let's go back there now because you
[59:07] were in Daniel now go back to Isaiah 4
[59:10] verse4 so brother reads Isaiah 4:4 he
[59:12] says this is what God does to
[59:17] you God brings his Spirit of judgment on
[59:19] you to show you you're wrong so then he
[59:22] justifies in other words he sanctifies
[59:24] you and then he fills you with the Holy
[59:25] Ghost
[59:27] that's what brother Ram gets out of this
[59:28] verse so what does this mean the 144,000
[59:32] got to go through the same three works
[59:34] that you're going through right
[59:36] now they've got to have the spirit of
[59:38] God come upon them judge their their
[59:40] their ways these are good ways these are
[59:41] sinful ways and then the spirit of
[59:43] burning has to burn out all the sin out
[59:46] of their lives through justification
[59:48] sanctification and then the spirit of
[59:50] burning has to take Abode it has to come
[59:52] and live inside the soul of the 144,000
[59:56] Believers
[59:58] Hallelujah that's
[1:00:02] right then brother Ram reads oh yeah oh
[1:00:05] yeah now his next statement is so he
[1:00:07] says this is the three works of Grace
[1:00:09] and then he brings it down to some you
[1:00:11] know he said it's the same thing God
[1:00:13] does to the earth when he purges it with
[1:00:15] fire by the spirit of burning now listen
[1:00:19] he says are you ready so brother R now
[1:00:23] uses it see the individual have to have
[1:00:25] the spirit ual fire on them just like
[1:00:27] the Earth has to have the fire on it now
[1:00:30] go to Second Peter chapter 3 might as
[1:00:32] well hit that then you can see
[1:00:36] it now I was so blessed on Wednesday you
[1:00:39] know brother Rod came up to after words
[1:00:40] he said I learned so much today brother
[1:00:41] Jesse i' never seen some of those things
[1:00:43] before so I just want you to know God is
[1:00:45] revealing his truth to people hallelujah
[1:00:47] I hope you're getting some Revelation
[1:00:49] too but if you're not uh check your life
[1:00:51] uh let the spirit of judgment check your
[1:00:53] life Hallelujah because we're having
[1:00:55] people receiving Revelation here right
[1:00:57] amongst us
[1:01:02] hallelujah now verse four brother Ram
[1:01:04] uses this verse in the future home too
[1:01:07] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:01:08] coming these are the scoffers for since
[1:01:10] the fathers fell asleep all things
[1:01:12] continue as they were from the beginning
[1:01:13] of the creation for this they are
[1:01:15] willingly are ignorant of that by the
[1:01:17] word of God the heavens were of old and
[1:01:19] the Earth standing out of the water was
[1:01:20] in the wat everyone say water ready
[1:01:23] what's the first step water right what's
[1:01:26] the second set brother man says blood so
[1:01:28] there's the flood of Noah and then the
[1:01:30] blood of Jesus Christ was shed and the
[1:01:33] blood fell upon the Earth brother said
[1:01:34] it Sanctified the Earth Hallelujah now
[1:01:38] it doesn't mention uh Jesus's uh his his
[1:01:43] sacrifice of blood in this chapter but
[1:01:44] we know it happened verse six whereby
[1:01:47] the world then that was being overflow
[1:01:49] with water perish but the heavens and
[1:01:51] the Earth which are now by the same word
[1:01:54] are kept in store reserved unto what
[1:01:56] fire against the day of judgment and the
[1:01:59] predition of ungodly
[1:02:02] men
[1:02:04] Hallelujah so see Paul Peter lays in
[1:02:07] here water fire now in between that was
[1:02:10] the blood of Jesus Christ water Blood
[1:02:12] Fire that's represents justification
[1:02:15] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:17] Ghost and brother Ram uses uh Isaiah 4:4
[1:02:21] to show that's what is going to happen
[1:02:22] to the 144,000 justification
[1:02:25] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost all
[1:02:31] right now since we're here well let's go
[1:02:34] down to verse 10 but the day of the Lord
[1:02:36] will come as a thief in the night that
[1:02:37] sounds familiar right just like 1
[1:02:39] Thessalonians 5 in which the heavens
[1:02:41] shall pass away with a great
[1:02:43] noise and the element shall melt with
[1:02:45] fervent heat does that sound like fire
[1:02:47] to anybody Hallelujah the Earth also and
[1:02:50] the works that are in them shall be
[1:02:52] burned up there's the spirit of burning
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:02:56] glory to God in other words God redeems
[1:02:58] the Earth just like he redeems your life
[1:03:01] you get baptized in water the blood of
[1:03:03] Jesus the spirit of God comes out and
[1:03:05] sanctifies cleans out your life and then
[1:03:06] he sends the fire of the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:08] sets you on fire
[1:03:10] hallelujah amen I've been touched by a
[1:03:13] fire let the world come and watch me
[1:03:15] burn
[1:03:16] Hallelujah
[1:03:17] Glory thank you
[1:03:20] Jesus now look at verse 11 seeing then
[1:03:22] that all these things shall be dissolved
[1:03:25] what manner of persons ought you to be
[1:03:27] in all holy conversation and godliness
[1:03:30] looking for and hastening unto the
[1:03:31] coming of the day of God whereby the
[1:03:33] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:03:35] and the element shall melt with fervent
[1:03:38] heat so notice what does Peter say what
[1:03:41] manner of person should you be because
[1:03:44] the coming of the Lord is at hand he
[1:03:47] said that 2,000 years ago but how many
[1:03:49] remember Wednesday what do we talk about
[1:03:51] Wednesday uh the Bible said Elijah is
[1:03:53] going to turn the heart to the of the
[1:03:55] the the fathers to the children that was
[1:03:57] John the Baptist and brother random his
[1:03:59] children back to the fathers now in this
[1:04:02] verse we can see the fathers Peter Peter
[1:04:05] saying get be ready for the coming of
[1:04:06] the Lord he's telling the children be
[1:04:08] ready live a Godly life because you
[1:04:10] don't know when it's going to happen you
[1:04:12] got to be ready for him to come
[1:04:14] Hallelujah so what am I saying here's
[1:04:16] the father saying what manner of persons
[1:04:19] be holy for Jesus was holy hallelujah
[1:04:22] it's the fathers with their hearts
[1:04:24] turned to the children and the church
[1:04:25] said and then what did Brother R do
[1:04:27] during the future home brother Jose
[1:04:29] brother Ram here is at the end time he's
[1:04:30] a child and he's pointing back to Peter
[1:04:33] the fathers of the faith hallelujah oh
[1:04:36] my thank God for the grace of God
[1:04:38] hallelujah the fathers Peter pointing to
[1:04:40] brother Brandon brother BR pointing us
[1:04:42] back to Peter and Paul he said we'll be
[1:04:44] judged by that Hallelujah he said I
[1:04:46] preach what Paul preached I pre preach
[1:04:48] what pre Peter preached that way will go
[1:04:50] in just like brother Brandon will go in
[1:04:53] hallelujah hallelujah we'll go in
[1:04:55] because brother man preach what Paul and
[1:04:57] Peter
[1:04:58] preached
[1:05:00] yes all right now you got that you got
[1:05:02] that so the only time brother Ram read
[1:05:05] Isaiah 4:4 that I can find the message
[1:05:07] was the future home and he applied it to
[1:05:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:05:11] Jews and then he also applied of course
[1:05:14] uh to the Future home all right
[1:05:17] now since we're here I think I'll just
[1:05:19] stay here let's now go back to uh now go
[1:05:22] to Isaiah chapter 6 friends Isaiah
[1:05:24] chapter 6
[1:05:33] verse
[1:05:34] one see when I first read
[1:05:38] that when I first read Isaiah 4
[1:05:41] instantly I thought of Isaiah 6 because
[1:05:43] I was in that
[1:05:45] book Isaiah 6 verse
[1:05:50] one the verse one says in the year that
[1:05:52] King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord
[1:05:55] sitting upon upon a throne high and
[1:05:57] lifted up and his train filled the
[1:05:59] temple notice when did this happen the
[1:06:03] year the king
[1:06:05] died
[1:06:07] Hallelujah brother Ram explains why this
[1:06:10] was so important brother Ram said Isaiah
[1:06:12] and we know about history too he worked
[1:06:14] right in the court with the King he he
[1:06:16] was of Royal Blood that's why he was so
[1:06:18] his writing was so precise he was
[1:06:19] trained he was
[1:06:21] educated he he lived right there he
[1:06:23] worked right there amongst the Kings but
[1:06:25] he wasn't a prophet yet God had not
[1:06:27] commissioned him yet and church remember
[1:06:29] Uzziah he was one of the most Godly
[1:06:31] Kings right until the end the Bible said
[1:06:34] there was no King like him until the end
[1:06:35] when he tried to make himself uh he
[1:06:37] tried to make himself a priest remember
[1:06:39] he took the sensor he went in there they
[1:06:41] warned him don't go in there King don't
[1:06:42] go in there he's like I can do whatever
[1:06:43] I want and he goes in there and he comes
[1:06:46] out he's got leprosy he dies not long
[1:06:47] after
[1:06:49] that but but brother R says Isaiah
[1:06:51] brother am dramatized it he said all of
[1:06:53] Isaiah's life he looked up to the king
[1:06:54] Victory after victory Victory after
[1:06:56] Victory he honored God remember he as
[1:06:58] long as he sought God remember the Bible
[1:07:00] said he
[1:07:01] prospered so that's the real that's the
[1:07:03] real Prosperity Gospel I hope somebody
[1:07:04] catches that it's not this lying false
[1:07:07] prophecy uh Prosperity that preachers
[1:07:10] Preach Today you'll Prosper spiritually
[1:07:12] if you follow Jesus not always naturally
[1:07:16] you're not promised to be rich in
[1:07:18] natural things you're promised to be
[1:07:19] rich in spiritual things because Paul
[1:07:21] said you get the unsearchable riches of
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:07:29] remember church he did many inventions
[1:07:30] like he did catapults up on the he had
[1:07:32] all these machines that would help him
[1:07:34] to defeat all the victors he conquered
[1:07:36] so many enemies he built up fortresses
[1:07:38] and uh and fortifications he you know
[1:07:41] throughout all the land of Israel he was
[1:07:43] one of the most successful Kings until
[1:07:45] the very end brother R said Isaiah
[1:07:47] looked up to him like a mentor like oh
[1:07:49] this man is a servant of God but brother
[1:07:51] said when when Uzziah died Isaiah was
[1:07:54] sad he lost his mentor kind of like
[1:07:57] Lena's mom right kind of reminds me of
[1:08:00] Lena's mom right
[1:08:01] now we ought to be thankful for the the
[1:08:03] examples we have in the faith how be
[1:08:05] thankful for Sister beatric by God's
[1:08:07] grace and William examples like I said
[1:08:10] they've been around the message for four
[1:08:12] decades they've seen a lot brother Jose
[1:08:15] seen a lot Hallelujah thankful for
[1:08:16] Jose's testimony he's seen a lot a lot
[1:08:19] of things come and go right a lot of
[1:08:21] things raise up and fall down and a lot
[1:08:23] of times a lot of times these things
[1:08:24] come to ask the True Believers to see
[1:08:27] who really is the True
[1:08:30] Believer right we're not surprised when
[1:08:32] God lets evil spirits come Among Us
[1:08:34] that's what happened with Saul and David
[1:08:35] God let it come in to see who's the real
[1:08:38] believer that's right Hallelujah that's
[1:08:41] right happens in micaiah's age and each
[1:08:43] one of them they got to come in remember
[1:08:45] Paul Paul said Paul warned them for
[1:08:47] three years wolves are going to come in
[1:08:49] and try to scatter the
[1:08:50] flock no why wouldn't God just why
[1:08:53] wouldn't God just protect his lambs and
[1:08:55] keep out all the Wolves because God
[1:08:56] wants to see who's on his
[1:08:58] side there's always a thinning down time
[1:09:01] amen look at look at look at the church
[1:09:03] it's thinning down all the time it's
[1:09:05] always thinning down who's the real
[1:09:07] believer who's the true one the
[1:09:09] Believers that really love the word
[1:09:11] really love the Holy Ghost really love
[1:09:12] the scripture God's it's a Proving
[1:09:14] Grounds it's a testing grounds
[1:09:15] Hallelujah Jesus wants to see you
[1:09:17] overcome with the word of God
[1:09:20] hallelujah that's
[1:09:23] right now also notice this
[1:09:26] the death of someone is also the
[1:09:28] beginning of someone else's
[1:09:31] Ministry God told Joshua Moses my
[1:09:33] servant is dead now I'm with you as I
[1:09:36] was with Moses so I'll be with
[1:09:39] you right now the simple examples like
[1:09:41] in our church you know uh once our other
[1:09:43] song leader left God raised up Malachi
[1:09:46] has he been faithful on the piano
[1:09:48] Hallelujah right and when people leave
[1:09:51] out what does God do raise up somebody
[1:09:53] else that's God's way hallah
[1:09:56] that's right if you really love God
[1:09:58] there'll be somebody there that'll raise
[1:10:01] up and God will raise them up and use
[1:10:03] them for his purpose for the rest of the
[1:10:05] time that's right just like in the
[1:10:07] natural God raised up Kings he raised up
[1:10:09] Joe Biden he pulled him
[1:10:12] down right God can do whatever he wants
[1:10:14] he's raised up Trump but we'll see what
[1:10:16] happens it's all it's all in God's
[1:10:18] timing but you want to be raised up for
[1:10:21] Jesus's sake
[1:10:22] Hallelujah to be an example of
[1:10:25] Christianity an example of righteousness
[1:10:28] not to be used of the Lord uh uh as one
[1:10:30] of his vessels of Dishonor you want to
[1:10:32] be raised up as a vessel of Honor unto
[1:10:35] Christ that's
[1:10:38] right what a
[1:10:41] blessing so uh Uzziah was Isaiah's
[1:10:45] Mentor Isaiah was leaning on Uzziah
[1:10:47] brother Ram said he was a Godly Man for
[1:10:49] the most of his life but when Uzziah
[1:10:53] died God comes to Isaiah and gives him
[1:10:56] his own
[1:10:57] experience right God provided it Uzziah
[1:11:01] reigned for 52 years 2 Chronicles 26:3
[1:11:05] says and did you know Isaiah married a
[1:11:07] prophet as well a propheus did you know
[1:11:08] that that have been some real good uh
[1:11:11] conversations at the dinner table
[1:11:13] wouldn't have it honey what' you see of
[1:11:15] the lord well let me tell you hubby I
[1:11:16] wrote it
[1:11:18] down that that's in Isaiah 8:3 Isaiah
[1:11:21] was married to a
[1:11:23] propheus and Isa was a prophet himself
[1:11:27] talk about some spiritual algebra there
[1:11:29] sister nature talk about that oh my oh
[1:11:32] honey I had this Vision right it was a a
[1:11:35] virgin shall conceive oh that's
[1:11:36] wonderful honey what did you see today
[1:11:38] here's what I
[1:11:39] saw
[1:11:44] amazing and Isaiah then once he became a
[1:11:47] prophet as we'll see in this chapter he
[1:11:49] served under Uzziah not as a prophet but
[1:11:51] afterwards and then the king Jo jotham
[1:11:54] ahaz and Hezekiah and he prophesied for
[1:11:57] about 40 or 50 years his messages were
[1:12:00] warnings against idolater social
[1:12:02] injustice political alliances with
[1:12:04] foreign Nations he also prophesied about
[1:12:07] the Babylonian exile the coming of the
[1:12:09] Messiah and the restoration of Israel
[1:12:11] Amen brother R said Isaiah wrote a whole
[1:12:13] Mini Bible because he wrote 66 chapters
[1:12:17] and there's 66 books in the book of
[1:12:19] Isaiah hallelujah oh my what a servant
[1:12:22] of God hallelujah
[1:12:25] he has some of the most famous Messiah
[1:12:28] prophecies about a virgin shall conceive
[1:12:30] and his name will be wonderful counselor
[1:12:33] Mighty God the Prince of Peace the
[1:12:35] Everlasting father hallelujah oh my
[1:12:38] glory to God verse two and Isaiah 6
[1:12:43] ver2 but actually you know what let me
[1:12:44] read one
[1:12:45] again in that year he saw so he saw a
[1:12:50] vision we don't know if this is his
[1:12:52] first Vision but this is one of the most
[1:12:54] important Visions he ever had
[1:12:56] he saw the Throne of Christ and of
[1:12:57] course this is before Christ came but he
[1:12:59] would have saw the theophany high and
[1:13:01] lifted up and his train filled the
[1:13:03] temple now you in the old days the train
[1:13:06] uh it was this long robe and it it meant
[1:13:09] how many battles the king had
[1:13:11] won so Isaiah looks up and sees God has
[1:13:14] won every
[1:13:15] battle he's undefeated hallelujah praise
[1:13:18] God he wins every time don't fight
[1:13:21] against him fight for him
[1:13:23] Hallelujah Point your family to Jesus
[1:13:26] right don't don't let your family and
[1:13:28] friends keep serving the the devil try
[1:13:30] to reach out to them try to get them to
[1:13:31] see Jesus wins every battle Jesus never
[1:13:34] fails he's king of kings and Lord of
[1:13:36] lords
[1:13:38] Hallelujah his train filled the entire
[1:13:41] Temple this Mighty God imagine it just
[1:13:43] flowing uh like like the like the
[1:13:46] ocean's Tides you know just just flowing
[1:13:49] with the glory and the victory Of God
[1:13:52] Almighty and above it stood the seraphim
[1:13:55] now seraphim are different kinds of
[1:13:56] angels remember there's at least three
[1:13:58] kind of angels there's cherubim seraphim
[1:14:01] and
[1:14:02] Archangels right and then even Lucifer
[1:14:04] was a covering Angel which I believe was
[1:14:05] a cherub yeah the Bible calls him a
[1:14:07] cherub but the seraphim were specific
[1:14:10] angels that dealt with the Heavenly
[1:14:12] altar of God right remember the cherabin
[1:14:15] they just surround it saying holy holy
[1:14:18] holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy
[1:14:20] that's the cherubims but the seraphim
[1:14:23] they would go and Minister uh in the
[1:14:25] Heavenly
[1:14:26] Tabernacle
[1:14:28] Hallelujah and so Isaiah sees seraphim
[1:14:31] he doesn't see the cherubims he sees the
[1:14:34] seraphim dealing with the altar of
[1:14:37] God each one had six wings which Twain
[1:14:41] he did cover his face now getting back
[1:14:43] to six six is not a bad number Church
[1:14:45] six can be a good
[1:14:47] number the only six that's bad is
[1:14:51] 666 that's the only bad six
[1:14:55] six is a good number it had six wings
[1:14:57] and the church said you there's six
[1:15:00] pieces of armor on the armor of God
[1:15:02] hallelujah I got a whole preach a whole
[1:15:05] sermon on that and whole series I think
[1:15:07] my brother Jose was there my that was a
[1:15:08] wonderful series back in 2015 I got
[1:15:11] about 30 sermons on that Bible
[1:15:13] numerology boy it's been a long time had
[1:15:16] brother might have to revisit that but
[1:15:18] six is a good number six
[1:15:21] wings with Twain he covered his face so
[1:15:24] the sah had wings over their
[1:15:26] faces with Twain he covered his feet and
[1:15:29] with Twain he did fly now brother R
[1:15:32] brings out a simple teaching
[1:15:34] here brother said let's think he says
[1:15:37] with two Wings he had over his face in
[1:15:39] the presence of God which represents
[1:15:41] humility and the church
[1:15:44] said what what happened when they come
[1:15:46] around Jesus or Angels what they do they
[1:15:47] fall in their
[1:15:49] face right humbling themselves now the
[1:15:52] word humility in the New Testament it
[1:15:55] means a deep sense of your
[1:15:58] littleness you're so little your mind is
[1:16:01] so little most time it's like oh you're
[1:16:03] so great you so know you know so much
[1:16:05] you're so smart humility is like you
[1:16:07] really don't know that much you memorize
[1:16:09] a few multiplication division facts good
[1:16:11] for you now do something with it go work
[1:16:14] a job go go do something that's not very
[1:16:17] impressive but you know I I I cheer on
[1:16:20] my first graders yeah great job but I'm
[1:16:21] like I know that's just the beginning
[1:16:23] I'm glad they can understand that that
[1:16:25] in first grade but remember humility is
[1:16:27] littleness remember how little you are
[1:16:30] you can do nothing apart from Jesus we
[1:16:32] can do
[1:16:33] nothing let's all say that let's say I
[1:16:35] can do nothing ready I can do nothing
[1:16:37] smart as we think we might be as smart
[1:16:39] and intelligent we can do nothing
[1:16:42] without Jesus Christ and brother said
[1:16:44] that's what those two wings
[1:16:47] represent of these Sims that they're so
[1:16:50] humble In God's Presence they have to
[1:16:51] hide their face in the presence of God
[1:16:56] he said and second they had two Wings
[1:16:57] over their feet what was it he said
[1:17:00] reverence well I'm sorry I got these
[1:17:02] mixed up sorry yeah sorry he either he
[1:17:05] changed them or I got him mixed up so
[1:17:07] forgive me he said the two that covered
[1:17:10] I'm sorry yeah the two that cover his
[1:17:11] face yeah it changes here was reverence
[1:17:13] so this represents reverence so let me
[1:17:15] read reverence reverence in the Old
[1:17:17] Testament means Godly fear so the fear
[1:17:20] of the Lord so I'm sorry I got that
[1:17:22] mixed up Wings on the face is reverence
[1:17:25] right we're so reverent which is I fear
[1:17:27] the lord remember what's fear of God
[1:17:29] it's honor and adoration for
[1:17:33] God okay so the two over the face is
[1:17:36] reverence I reverence God he's so great
[1:17:39] I fear the lord I can hardly look at him
[1:17:41] he's so great and I honor him I respect
[1:17:44] him I give him the all the reverence
[1:17:47] okay and then the fee is humility
[1:17:50] because remember what did God say to
[1:17:51] Moses take your shoes off you're
[1:17:53] standing on Holy Ground Hal Hallelujah
[1:17:56] right humility there now we're getting
[1:17:58] to humility so sorry I got that mixed up
[1:18:00] there see preachers make mistakes all
[1:18:02] the time they just got to Humble
[1:18:03] themselves and say they made a mistake
[1:18:05] forgive me Lord so you need you need the
[1:18:08] fear of the Lord now brother applies
[1:18:11] this to us we can learn something from
[1:18:12] these seraphim the fear of the Lord and
[1:18:15] then he says
[1:18:17] humility how many knows what he said the
[1:18:19] wings in act I'm sorry the wings were
[1:18:21] being in action in other words not being
[1:18:24] being lazy for God doing something for
[1:18:27] God and church you came to church today
[1:18:30] you're in action if you raise your hands
[1:18:32] today if you clapped today if you said
[1:18:34] amen today if you prayed today you're in
[1:18:37] action that's right brother ra said
[1:18:40] that's right he said the two Wings he
[1:18:42] said what was he doing he was in
[1:18:45] action the two w wings represent
[1:18:49] action what was he doing he was showing
[1:18:51] the prophet that by this how the Prophet
[1:18:55] his prepared servant must
[1:18:58] be hallelujah oh that's beautiful God's
[1:19:02] prepared servant must be reverent humble
[1:19:06] and in action Hallelujah well now I'm
[1:19:08] thinking about me as a preacher and you
[1:19:09] can think about you as your your calling
[1:19:11] for God God didn't show him the
[1:19:14] cherubims brother Claude he didn't show
[1:19:17] him those beautiful cherubims that are
[1:19:18] up I'll say the covering chair was that
[1:19:20] guard the throne he didn't show them the
[1:19:22] throne guards because Isaiah wasn't
[1:19:24] going to be the throne guard God showed
[1:19:26] him the seraphim that were flying that
[1:19:29] covered their faces and covered their
[1:19:31] feet that the servant of God must be
[1:19:33] reverent humble he must stay in
[1:19:37] action that's what God will show you if
[1:19:39] you're going to be a servant you got to
[1:19:41] be humble reverent and you got to stay
[1:19:43] active for Jesus
[1:19:46] hallelujah hallelujah that's why I told
[1:19:48] you if You' got a a song gift like
[1:19:50] Malachi you better use it if you sing
[1:19:53] specials you better I mean there there's
[1:19:56] no specific time when you need to sing
[1:19:57] them but just be be available so God can
[1:20:00] sing through
[1:20:02] you if you're a preacher preach when the
[1:20:04] doors open because the gift will make
[1:20:06] room for

[1:23:27] not preachers there's so much to be done
[1:23:30] we just got to do something for
[1:23:32] God we just got to be in service
[1:23:36] Hallelujah in action find an action to
[1:23:40] do brother Jesse on top of my regular
[1:23:43] job yes I work a job too Hallelujah if I
[1:23:46] can do it you can do it praise God
[1:23:48] that's
[1:23:49] right all right enough enough on that
[1:23:52] how many enjoyed that by God's grace
[1:23:53] those seraphim
[1:23:55] reverent humble and in
[1:23:58] action that's why the Bible said give
[1:24:00] them double honor because they're
[1:24:02] reverent humble they stay in action
[1:24:04] brother
[1:24:20] Chris right Mary and Joseph were visited
[1:24:22] by Gabriel now with with Abra it was God
[1:24:25] himself right the one time and then
[1:24:27] there was two angels with him we don't
[1:24:28] we're not told the names of them right
[1:24:32] but so those would be a different kind
[1:24:33] of angels right because we got those
[1:24:34] three kinds there could be more kinds
[1:24:37] too because the Bible says then in
[1:24:38] Hebrews 1 angels are sent forth as
[1:24:41] ministering spirits to them that would
[1:24:43] believe so there could be like uh angels
[1:24:46] that are just Messengers to the
[1:24:48] elect let's read that that's Hebrews
[1:24:50] chapter 1 right Hebrews chapter 1 Neon
[1:24:54] if I'm wrong I'm sure AAA will correct
[1:24:55] me back there right
[1:24:58] AA they're ministering Spirits sent
[1:25:01] forth to those that would be Heirs of
[1:25:03] Salvation now it's coming yeah they're
[1:25:04] just Glory it's Hebrews 1:14 brother
[1:25:06] Chris great question so it looks like
[1:25:08] there we have three types of angels just
[1:25:10] by name but it looks like there's
[1:25:11] another set of angels that are
[1:25:13] ministering Spirits sent out to the
[1:25:15] humans okay here it is that's how I'll
[1:25:18] read this on three ready 1 2 three are
[1:25:20] they not all ministering Spirits sent
[1:25:23] forth to minister for them who shall be
[1:25:25] Heirs of Salvation brother Bram says
[1:25:28] each person has a guardian angel so
[1:25:30] maybe that's I don't know if that word
[1:25:32] Guardian is in the King James but we all
[1:25:35] have a ministering Spirit an angel to be
[1:25:37] with us brother said it watches you over
[1:25:40] you all your
[1:25:42] life right so we all have ministering or
[1:25:45] guarding angels we would say by God's
[1:25:48] grace yes yes let's say praise the Lord
[1:25:51] can we praise the Lord me too brother
[1:25:53] been many times I've been close to death
[1:25:55] God has been gracious to
[1:25:58] me very good question brother verse uh
[1:26:01] now let's go back to Isaiah 63 well I
[1:26:03] sure thought I was going to get through
[1:26:04] a lot today I can tell I'm not going to
[1:26:06] hardly get anything done today but all
[1:26:08] glory to God Isaiah 63 and one Cried
[1:26:11] unto another now look these three
[1:26:12] seraphim are flying around I'm sorry the
[1:26:15] seraphim are flying around and they
[1:26:16] cried to another saying holy holy holy
[1:26:19] is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is
[1:26:21] full of his glory so now we're talking
[1:26:24] the seraphim also shout holy holy they
[1:26:26] join the cherubims shouting holy holy
[1:26:29] holy and they CED to another that's what
[1:26:31] we should cry right brother Claud we
[1:26:33] should say holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:26:35] God Almighty right brother Mercy holy
[1:26:37] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty Mali
[1:26:39] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[1:26:41] we should say that to one another praise
[1:26:43] God I'll say it like this Our Lives
[1:26:44] should declare it
[1:26:46] Hallelujah we shouldn't have to say holy
[1:26:48] but we should have the Holiness of God
[1:26:50] on
[1:26:52] us that's what I heard brother McBride
[1:26:54] was was preaching at cams last week and
[1:26:55] I listened to his
[1:26:56] sermon and he said brother McBride said
[1:26:58] even at
[1:26:59] work brother McBride said a man will be
[1:27:01] around him and and they just be around
[1:27:03] each other he said he said are you a
[1:27:05] Christian right and brother McBride
[1:27:09] McBride's like what do you mean because
[1:27:10] he don't want to tell him right away he
[1:27:12] said I can tell you're a Christian just
[1:27:13] by the way you
[1:27:14] dress brother Bri's like I didn't wear a
[1:27:17] tie to
[1:27:18] work right but see they and he said
[1:27:21] every time I come around you there's a
[1:27:23] presence around you
[1:27:25] Church said I remember when I got hired
[1:27:26] at copi the very first meeting I went to
[1:27:29] uh her name was Kathy Clark Kathy CL
[1:27:31] Clark told me after the service she said
[1:27:32] it was like you were glowing she said
[1:27:35] she said we all knew you were a
[1:27:36] Christian as soon as you walked in the
[1:27:37] door I said thank God for the glow of
[1:27:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:42] Hallelujah see it just it uh they cried
[1:27:46] out so we should have we should carry
[1:27:47] the Holiness of Jesus with us that's
[1:27:51] right remember I had two women tell me
[1:27:53] that they knew I was going to be a pre
[1:27:54] someday an old high school girl and then
[1:27:57] uh the pastor's wife up there in
[1:27:58] Sheffield said as soon as the first time
[1:28:00] I saw you she said I knew you'd be a
[1:28:01] preacher I was like I wish somebody
[1:28:03] would told me too I wish somebody would
[1:28:05] have told me beforehand but I I you know
[1:28:07] I had my experiences so I I know I know
[1:28:09] God called me verse
[1:28:12] four so the angels are crying holy holy
[1:28:15] the whole earth is full of his glory
[1:28:16] verse four and the post of the door
[1:28:18] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[1:28:21] the house was filled with smoke look how
[1:28:24] great God is God is so great when he
[1:28:27] speaks Even Heaven
[1:28:29] shakes because Solomon said not even the
[1:28:32] heaven of Heavens can contain the glory
[1:28:35] of the Lord imagine that brother Chris
[1:28:37] you're in your house and you just say
[1:28:39] somebody help me get me some water and
[1:28:40] the whole walls
[1:28:42] Shake that's what it was like being in
[1:28:44] heaven every time God speaks everything
[1:28:46] shakes well no wonder they're saying
[1:28:47] holy no wonder they're covering their
[1:28:49] faces because God is Holy Hallelujah
[1:28:52] he's separate he's perfect he's all
[1:28:54] powerful he's Eternal and his whole
[1:28:56] house shakes when he
[1:28:58] talks yet the Bible tells us to be meek
[1:29:00] and
[1:29:02] humble I don't yell too much in my home
[1:29:04] I can't remember if I ever yelled in my
[1:29:07] house but I hope I hope the humility of
[1:29:10] Christ shakes my children by the grace
[1:29:13] of God but when God speaks in heaven the
[1:29:17] door of the post the gates everything
[1:29:19] shakes in heaven because God is so great
[1:29:22] remember Hebrews 12 says not only will
[1:29:24] God Shake Heaven he'll also shake all of
[1:29:27] Earth he's going to shake it again his
[1:29:29] voice is going to speak again of course
[1:29:30] shake it during the Great Tribulation
[1:29:33] period verse
[1:29:35] five then said I now we're finally
[1:29:37] getting down to the close here I got six
[1:29:40] minutes on my hour verse five then said
[1:29:43] I woe is me for I am undone so let's
[1:29:47] just take a moment back first he sees
[1:29:50] the throne then he sees this train this
[1:29:52] Victorious God then he sees the the
[1:29:54] Angels crying and then he hears God
[1:29:56] speak everything shakes and how does
[1:29:59] this make him
[1:30:01] feel woe is me I am a dirty wretched
[1:30:06] person huh God you know people say
[1:30:09] people they say oh God loves you so much
[1:30:11] God's got a great plan for your life
[1:30:13] that's the first thing they learn about
[1:30:14] God here's the first thing the Bible
[1:30:16] teaches about when you know about God
[1:30:18] you're a wretched
[1:30:20] sinner hallelujah
[1:30:22] amen like I've heard preachers say oh
[1:30:24] you know they witness the now of course
[1:30:26] they're internet preachers they witness
[1:30:28] to people and say oh God loves you so
[1:30:29] much you are God's Masterpiece and God
[1:30:32] loves you and you're so beautiful God
[1:30:33] has a great plan for your life you're a
[1:30:35] beautiful person that was different than
[1:30:37] how Isaiah met God and look what they
[1:30:40] turn out to be they get to be a lot of
[1:30:42] them turn out to be deceived church
[1:30:43] members the false
[1:30:45] Vine
[1:30:47] hallelujah how does God introduce Isaiah
[1:30:50] God introduces all these things to
[1:30:52] Isaiah the seraphim theol of God the
[1:30:55] place shaken and Isaiah says Woe Is Me
[1:30:58] In other words I'm under judgment ah the
[1:31:00] spirit of judgment's here hallelujah
[1:31:03] Glory the Holy Ghost will the Holy Ghost
[1:31:06] will make you feel judged I'm guilty and
[1:31:09] church we're all
[1:31:11] guilty Hallelujah we all deserve hell we
[1:31:14] all deserve woes we all deserve uh
[1:31:17] punishments chastisements we all deserve
[1:31:20] hell and we should all say this that we
[1:31:23] deserve it
[1:31:24] we should know we deserve the judgments
[1:31:26] of God and he says I'm undone in other
[1:31:29] words my life isn't complete there's
[1:31:32] nothing good about me my life is in
[1:31:34] pieces before Christ Our Life was in
[1:31:37] shambles I hoping somebody would say
[1:31:39] Amen on that Hallelujah if your life was
[1:31:41] good before well then you must have been
[1:31:43] in a certain type of a Temptation like
[1:31:45] the Rich Young Ruler or something like
[1:31:46] that then you need a lot of help praise
[1:31:48] God need a lot of help because you think
[1:31:50] you got everything figured out got all
[1:31:51] the money got all the answers you don't
[1:31:53] have any answers without the blood of
[1:31:55] Jesus Christ
[1:31:57] Hallelujah he said wo I'm under judgment
[1:32:00] wo is me I'm undone my life is all out
[1:32:03] of order I don't even know what to do my
[1:32:06] life is confusion my life is chaos
[1:32:09] Hallelujah because why because I'm a
[1:32:12] dirty mouth person and the church
[1:32:15] said I say evil things a prophet of
[1:32:19] God wasn't he born a prophet didn't God
[1:32:21] for know him as a prophet like Jeremiah
[1:32:25] yes so even prophets before their
[1:32:27] commission even prophets have to say I'm
[1:32:30] under the Judgment of God the Holy
[1:32:32] Spirit Will judge them and say I'm not
[1:32:34] worthy for this
[1:32:36] calling I speak evil things I have evil
[1:32:39] in my heart I deserve the punishment of
[1:32:42] God hallelujah so any spiritual
[1:32:46] experience if it makes you proud it
[1:32:48] probably wasn't from God but if you have
[1:32:51] a spiritual experience where you can put
[1:32:53] the state down like we talked about then
[1:32:55] it'll make you humble Hallelujah like
[1:32:58] those angels in the presence of God
[1:33:01] hallelujah you won't think oh I'm
[1:33:03] somebody great oh God's going to use me
[1:33:05] in the message or God's going to use me
[1:33:06] in akine you won't think that you'll
[1:33:08] think oh I'm nothing how could God ever
[1:33:10] used me I'm so filthy I'm so dirty but
[1:33:13] thank God there's Amazing Grace
[1:33:16] Hallelujah remember this is the man who
[1:33:18] wrote 66
[1:33:19] chapters wrote his own Mini Bible and
[1:33:23] what did he think about himself I'm so
[1:33:24] smart no I'm a man of unclean
[1:33:28] lips and I dwell amongst unclean
[1:33:32] people that was his assessment well what
[1:33:35] is my life really what is my life really
[1:33:37] like compared to heaven I'm dirty I'm
[1:33:39] filthy and so is everyone around
[1:33:42] me
[1:33:44] Hallelujah you know sometimes we want to
[1:33:46] meet Angels sometimes we want to have a
[1:33:47] dream of Jesus sometimes you want a
[1:33:49] supernatural thing but if you do look
[1:33:51] what's going to happen you're going to
[1:33:53] see how little you are and how great and
[1:33:56] holy Jesus is hallelujah praise God so
[1:34:01] I'm I'm dirty mouth and I live amongst
[1:34:03] dirty mouth
[1:34:06] people for mine eyes have seen the king
[1:34:09] the lord of the Heavenly
[1:34:11] Host amen so he saw all the hosts of
[1:34:14] Heaven all the innumerable Angels but he
[1:34:17] also saw the Lord he was Lord of hosts
[1:34:22] Hallelujah and this exper experence
[1:34:24] didn't make him think he's great it made
[1:34:26] him think he's
[1:34:28] dirty so can everybody see the spirit of
[1:34:30] judgment
[1:34:31] here so what's next after judgment
[1:34:34] what's next
[1:34:37] burning Hallelujah first you got to be
[1:34:41] judged that's why when I don't see
[1:34:43] people come up for prayer I don't see
[1:34:45] people pray for a while I wonder about
[1:34:46] them they're probably getting too full
[1:34:48] of themselves like they're such a great
[1:34:49] person in other words self-righteousness
[1:34:51] Pride
[1:34:54] the Holy Ghost doesn't make you prideful
[1:34:56] the Holy Ghost makes you
[1:34:58] humble it will judge you oh you
[1:35:00] shouldn't have done that this week you
[1:35:02] shouldn't have said that that was
[1:35:04] wrong Hallelujah that'll make you repent
[1:35:08] repent about it is that
[1:35:11] right so the spirit of judgment would
[1:35:15] come now and thinking about it now
[1:35:17] Church we've seen so many people fall
[1:35:18] out of the message and I'm not even
[1:35:20] talking about people in our church I'm
[1:35:21] not talking about people in our church
[1:35:22] but I've seen so many people were around
[1:35:24] this message and uh I think I shared a
[1:35:25] couple with you in
[1:35:27] private but the one brother
[1:35:30] remember he preached the message he got
[1:35:32] down at the altar next to Simon he
[1:35:34] prayed for five minutes got up and said
[1:35:36] I got the Holy Ghost he did not have a
[1:35:37] tear in his
[1:35:38] eye he did not say anything about I'm a
[1:35:41] man of unclean lips or any experience
[1:35:42] with God he just said I got the Holy
[1:35:44] Ghost and he's already fallen away from
[1:35:45] the message now he goes to the Baptist
[1:35:48] Church no no experience with
[1:35:51] God he wasn't thinking about how dirty
[1:35:53] he was he think about how great he's
[1:35:54] going to be
[1:35:55] used
[1:35:57] yes right and there's another brother
[1:36:00] that left the message and now he's being
[1:36:02] divorced or he's he divorced his his
[1:36:04] wife so sad a preacher that used to
[1:36:06] preach here
[1:36:08] sometimes and we always wondered you
[1:36:10] know does he have an experience with God
[1:36:12] and we and I've never seen him praising
[1:36:14] God weeping or repenting or anything
[1:36:16] like that I've never seen that none of
[1:36:17] his sermons produce that in anyone's
[1:36:20] life and one of the brothers that used
[1:36:22] to come here said I've always noticed
[1:36:23] about that brother I don't believe that

[1:37:43] the seraphim now notice when does The
[1:37:44] Burning come it comes after you admit
[1:37:47] you're a dirty
[1:37:49] sinner so the spirit of judgment comes
[1:37:52] to show you to judge that you're Unholy
[1:37:55] and you got to confess with the Bible
[1:37:56] said confess with your mouth that you're
[1:37:58] a
[1:37:59] sinner and call upon the name of the
[1:38:01] Lord Jesus and then you'll be
[1:38:04] saved that's why on Wednesday when we
[1:38:05] had that nice prayer with with with
[1:38:07] Genevie and she got saved on Wednesday
[1:38:09] let's give a round of applause right she
[1:38:10] got got saved on Wednesday remember what

[1:38:28] saved I said this is a beautiful picture
[1:38:30] this is what this is like heaven to me
[1:38:34] Hallelujah then so after the spirit of
[1:38:36] judgment comes you judge yourself dirty
[1:38:39] mouthed and after that then the angel
[1:38:42] comes and has a live coal in his hand
[1:38:47] which he taken off the tongs from off
[1:38:49] the altar of God hallelujah so there is
[1:38:54] a Brazen altar in heaven just like there
[1:38:56] was in the in the Tabernacle of Moses
[1:38:59] there's a Brazen altar there with a
[1:39:01] spiritual
[1:39:02] fire Hallelujah Church th that fire is
[1:39:05] more real than the fire down here if you
[1:39:07] understand what I'm saying that's that
[1:39:08] can be Eternal fire this is all this all

[1:39:19] are angels can't even touch
[1:39:21] them yes the spirit of burning
[1:39:24] and the angel comes down takes the
[1:39:25] tongue and flies right down to the
[1:39:28] prophet of
[1:39:29] God he says open
[1:39:32] up open up that mouth that you've been

[1:41:34] God can use your mouth for his
[1:41:37] glory look what these all these uh if

[1:41:43] Bible a live coal represents you're
[1:41:46] purified from

[1:41:55] did them the fire of God can forgive
[1:41:58] even the things you knew you shouldn't

[1:42:05] represents atonement and forgiveness
[1:42:09] right the iniquity is removed uh the the
[1:42:11] sin is removed and now you're at one
[1:42:14] with

[1:42:23] touched by a fire from heaven you know
[1:42:26] that's what this you know what our
[1:42:27] church needs more than anything else it
[1:42:28] needs people to have a coal of fire
[1:42:31] touch their
[1:42:32] lips I just mean their whole life but
[1:42:34] you understand what I'm saying people in
[1:42:36] our church they need experience from
[1:42:39] Heaven I can't send it but God can
[1:42:42] Hallelujah if I my choice I'd say
[1:42:44] everybody open up your mouths you're
[1:42:45] getting a live cold today now we're all
[1:42:46] going to speak the right thing that's my
[1:42:49] choice but God's got look just like with
[1:42:52] Isaiah God's got a time and season for
[1:42:54] everything God's got a time when he's
[1:42:56] going to put you into service hallelujah
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:01] hallelujah I'm sure hoping some of these
[1:43:03] brothers will be a preacher someday so I
[1:43:04] can get some extra help around here by
[1:43:05] God's grace but even if not I'll still
[1:43:08] keep preaching
[1:43:09] Hallelujah all these
[1:43:11] Services maybe God will raise one of
[1:43:13] them up just look for the coal to come
[1:43:15] hallelujah look for a coal to touch your
[1:43:18] mouth then you'll be
[1:43:21] reverent then you'll be humble and then
[1:43:23] you'll stay in action I won't have to
[1:43:25] ask you did you study this
[1:43:27] week did you pray this week did you
[1:43:30] listen to brother Bram this
[1:43:32] week if you got the coal I don't have to
[1:43:35] ask you to do those things because
[1:43:36] you're going to stay in action yeah
[1:43:38] we're going to make we're going to make
[1:43:39] mistakes we're going to fall short but
[1:43:41] God's going to get us right back on the
[1:43:42] right track Hallelujah he's going to
[1:43:46] make all things new like we like to sing
[1:43:48] about he's going to renew our minds day
[1:43:50] by day the Bible says
[1:43:54] he's going to keep you in
[1:43:57] action you know there was always this
[1:44:00] this wonderful brother but uh there in
[1:44:02] Lima there's always this wonderful
[1:44:03] brother I love him
[1:44:05] dearly but he just he you know he just
[1:44:07] couldn't keep the victory very long he
[1:44:10] said he was called to preach and said he
[1:44:11] was call called to song Lead and all
[1:44:13] these wonderful things but even to this
[1:44:15] day still struggles in and out of
[1:44:18] service sometimes able to preach some
[1:44:20] not saying I'm taking a break and all
[1:44:22] these things like that
[1:44:24] take uh years and months off from
[1:44:26] preaching friends what what I believe
[1:44:29] each person needs is a live coal
[1:44:32] experience that puts them into service
[1:44:35] and then if they get a coal from Heaven
[1:44:37] they'll have no more questions if
[1:44:39] they're called to speak for God
[1:44:41] hallelujah there'll be no more questions
[1:44:44] because I've been touched by a fire I've
[1:44:47] been touched from Heaven
[1:44:49] Hallelujah nobody's got to tell me about
[1:44:51] it I was there when it happened it
[1:44:53] happened to me
[1:44:59] Hallelujah that's what our church needs
[1:45:02] that's what every church
[1:45:04] needs some people would be touched by
[1:45:06] heaven so they can say the right thing
[1:45:08] and they can be put into Ministry but
[1:45:10] before that they first got to realize
[1:45:13] I'm
[1:45:14] unclean I'm dirty I say filthy things I
[1:45:17] just need Jesus to touch
[1:45:20] me so see a call of Fire represents it's
[1:45:23] preparing you for
[1:45:26] Ministry it's a symbol of God's
[1:45:30] power it's fire from the
[1:45:33] altar see Isaiah couldn't be a prophet
[1:45:36] without this live coal touching his
[1:45:38] mouth and I couldn't be a preacher
[1:45:40] either without the live coal touching my
[1:45:42] mouth as well I'm not going to tell you
[1:45:45] but I had a filthy mouth I said a lot of
[1:45:46] filthy things but the coal of fire
[1:45:48] touched my mouth I don't say filthy
[1:45:49] things anymore you're a witness I
[1:45:51] preached here 18 years by God's grace
[1:45:54] Hallelujah I've had that experience
[1:45:59] Hallelujah so see church we need an
[1:46:01] experience where God has touched our
[1:46:03] mouth and now we don't say unclean
[1:46:05] things we say clean
[1:46:07] things that's
[1:46:09] right so the spirit of judgment comes to
[1:46:12] convict you of your sins you confess
[1:46:14] that you're unclean and then the spirit
[1:46:16] of burning comes and it burns away all
[1:46:18] your iniquity Burns away all your sin
[1:46:20] you're forgiven and then it cleans your
[1:46:22] mouth so you can can talk for
[1:46:25] God
[1:46:27] yes verse seven says your iniquity is
[1:46:30] taken away your sin is purged now love
[1:46:33] verse eight also I heard the voice of
[1:46:35] the Lord saying whom shall I
[1:46:38] send who will go for us all the Heavenly
[1:46:42] hosts I love
[1:46:43] that God talks and the whole the whole
[1:46:46] Kingdom shakes in
[1:46:48] heaven and then his next his next
[1:46:50] thought is who's going to go for heaven
[1:46:52] who wants to who wants to represent
[1:46:55] Heaven Hallelujah who on Earth wants to
[1:46:58] talk for heaven
[1:47:00] hallelujah what does Isaiah
[1:47:04] say he said I here am I send
[1:47:09] me but first he had to admit I'm a dirty
[1:47:12] filthy mouth
[1:47:14] preacher I need the cleansing power of
[1:47:17] God and then when God's fire touches you
[1:47:20] now now you feel ready now you know now
[1:47:23] I can go preach for Jesus because he's
[1:47:26] touched my
[1:47:28] mouth then you're willing that's why the
[1:47:30] Bible said a pastors got to be willing
[1:47:31] remember we read that 1 Timothy 3 you
[1:47:33] got to be willing you you desire a good
[1:47:35] thing Isaiah desired a good
[1:47:38] Ministry to be a prophet of God and once
[1:47:42] his mouth was burned with fire then he
[1:47:44] said now I'll go for Jesus that's when I
[1:47:47] said brother Chris now I can be the
[1:47:48] pastor and a because God has touching my
[1:47:51] mouth
[1:47:53] the the fire of God has anointed me see
[1:47:55] you can accept and desire God's call for
[1:47:58] your life after repenting under the
[1:48:00] spirit of judgment and then experiencing
[1:48:02] the spirit of burning that burns away
[1:48:04] your iniquity your dirty mouth then you
[1:48:07] can be used by God to speak for God the
[1:48:10] cleansing fire of God on your mouth your
[1:48:13] heart and your
[1:48:15] life it's unbelievable that's over an
[1:48:18] hour my
[1:48:21] goodness Isaiah 69 let's see what kind
[1:48:24] of a Ministry let's see if Isaiah's
[1:48:26] going to have a lot of yes men in the
[1:48:29] church and he said go and tell this
[1:48:31] people hear ye indeed but understand not
[1:48:32] and see you indeed and perceive not so
[1:48:35] this is going to be Isaiah's uh
[1:48:37] congregation he's going to say you see
[1:48:40] but you're blind you hear but you're not
[1:48:42] really hearing this is the kind of
[1:48:44] people he was GNA have to preach
[1:48:46] to I'm glad I got a church that says
[1:48:48] amen sometimes Hallelujah right I'm glad
[1:48:51] people say amen every service
[1:48:53] verse 10 make the heart of this people
[1:48:55] fat and make their ears heavy and shut
[1:48:57] their eyes see about people sleeping in
[1:49:00] church you know it it's different if you
[1:49:01] work all night but if it's it's
[1:49:04] different too uh you shouldn't be
[1:49:05] staying up late at night doing things of
[1:49:07] the world
[1:49:09] either look at
[1:49:11] this lest they see with their eyes and
[1:49:14] hear with their ears and understand with
[1:49:15] their heart and convert and be healed so
[1:49:18] he said you're he said basically you got
[1:49:19] a church that's dis disobedient The More
[1:49:22] You Preach the more they're going to get
[1:49:23] tired on you cold on
[1:49:26] you wow what a
[1:49:28] Ministry what a Ministry for a prophet
[1:49:30] of God verse
[1:49:32] 11 wait was his ministry going to get
[1:49:34] greater and
[1:49:35] greater like all these preachers oh well
[1:49:38] brother Jess your church is so small how
[1:49:40] could you be a real preacher well did
[1:49:42] did all these guys get big churches and
[1:49:44] were they treated really good all the
[1:49:45] time no they didn't grow all the
[1:49:49] time that's right verse 11 I just the
[1:49:52] Conant criticism you get then I said how
[1:49:55] long Lord and he answered until the
[1:49:56] cities be wasted without inhabitants so
[1:49:58] in other words he was going to prophesy
[1:50:00] to these people until they were
[1:50:01] scattered and none of them were left
[1:50:03] except the poor right the poor to take
[1:50:05] over The Vineyards and so
[1:50:07] forth and the houses without man the
[1:50:10] land be utterly desolate and the Lord
[1:50:12] have removed men far away and there be
[1:50:14] great forsaking in the midst of the land
[1:50:15] verse 13 but yet in it shall be a tenth
[1:50:18] and it shall return a Remnant and shall
[1:50:20] be eaten as a as a teal of tree and as
[1:50:23] an oak whose substance is in them when
[1:50:25] they cast their leaves so shall the holy
[1:50:28] seed shall be the substance
[1:50:32] thereof
[1:50:36] Hallelujah now let me close with this
[1:50:38] here by God's grace I'm just going to
[1:50:39] close I'm L Lord willing I'll probably
[1:50:41] preach a part two
[1:50:46] then remember what the Bible says what
[1:50:48] does the Bible say Deuteronomy 4:24 for
[1:50:51] the Lord your God God is a consuming
[1:50:53] fire a jealous God see God didn't want
[1:50:57] Isaiah talking all these these dirty
[1:50:59] things with all these dirty people he's
[1:51:01] jealous God want to use Isaiah's mouth
[1:51:04] for his
[1:51:05] sake right and all the rest of the
[1:51:07] people they're just going to get more
[1:51:08] cold on God more hard-hearted say more
[1:51:11] evil things but God needed somebody to
[1:51:12] talk for him God was jealous over their
[1:51:15] words Deuteronomy
[1:51:18] 9:3 understand therefore this day that
[1:51:20] the Lord thy God is he which goeth over
[1:51:22] before the as a consuming fire he shall
[1:51:25] destroy them and he shall bring them
[1:51:27] down before thy face so shall thou drive
[1:51:29] them out and Destroy them quickly as the
[1:51:32] Lord has said unto thee what is God like
[1:51:35] he's like a consuming
[1:51:37] fire Hebrews 12:29 for our God is a
[1:51:42] consuming
[1:51:43] fire what's the word consuming mean in
[1:51:46] the Hebrew it means to eat to
[1:51:50] devour to burn up or to
[1:51:53] feed so what does God say God said I'm a
[1:51:56] eating fire I'm a devouring fire in
[1:51:59] other words I'm not going to stay in one
[1:52:00] spot I'm going to keep devouring I'm GNA
[1:52:02] eat up your entire life amen I'm G to
[1:52:05] burn up I'm going to consume all your
[1:52:07] thoughts and the church said I'm gonna
[1:52:09] consume all your words Hallelujah glory
[1:52:11] to God I'm gonna consume all your
[1:52:14] actions all I just want more and more I
[1:52:17] want more of your life I want more of
[1:52:18] your dedication I want more of your
[1:52:20] worship our God is a consuming fire
[1:52:22] Hallelujah let's stand to our feet
[1:52:25] musicians can
[1:52:32] come now I've shared some of these
[1:52:34] testimonies before but I was an awful
[1:52:37] awful
[1:52:39] sinner but I know this as soon as I was
[1:52:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:43] Christ I started memorizing acts 238 and
[1:52:47] from that moment I've never said another
[1:52:49] cuss word I used to say all kinds of
[1:52:51] wicked things
[1:52:55] before I preached my first sermon at
[1:52:56] brother Brooks's I've told this before
[1:52:57] but I'm going tell it
[1:52:59] again I was wondering I kind of felt led
[1:53:02] to preach right before I went and
[1:53:03] preached there I fasted two days before
[1:53:05] leading up there and say God and my only
[1:53:07] prayer of those two days was God just
[1:53:09] show me if I'm called to preach or not
[1:53:10] let there be some sign now God's my
[1:53:13] witness before I went out to preach
[1:53:15] there if you I don't know if you've seen
[1:53:17] brother Brooks's office most of you
[1:53:19] haven't there's the office and then
[1:53:21] there's the there's a bathroom and then
[1:53:23] there's the spot behind the baptismal
[1:53:25] area so it's like the for us to be like
[1:53:28] yeah there's the pastor's room there's a
[1:53:30] bathroom for the pastor and then behind
[1:53:32] them is the water
[1:53:33] baptism you know if you sit in the
[1:53:35] pastor's office people are going to come
[1:53:36] in and knock and and want to talk all
[1:53:38] day which is okay but I was going to
[1:53:41] preach my first sermon in front of all
[1:53:42] these well not it's actually my second
[1:53:43] sermon in front of these hundred people
[1:53:46] and I fasted that week and said God am I
[1:53:48] supposed to preach or not so you know
[1:53:50] what I did I got I didn't go in there I
[1:53:52] didn't go in the office I went further
[1:53:54] in and I hid Myself Away behind the
[1:53:57] altar I'm sorry behind the water baptism
[1:54:00] I just prayed there and church God's my
[1:54:02] witness during the whole song service I
[1:54:03] laid there on my face almost the whole
[1:54:05] time and I said God show me I was
[1:54:07] shaking I was so nervous I was so
[1:54:10] shaking I said God don't let me say one
[1:54:13] thing don't let me say one thing that's
[1:54:16] wrong and I felt such an anointing come
[1:54:18] on me I was shaking and also when I
[1:54:21] stepped out there
[1:54:23] be after I finished uh that song uh I
[1:54:26] shall forever LIF lift my eyes to
[1:54:28] Calvary play that one that's the song as
[1:54:30] soon as we said praise God sister Karen
[1:54:32] Sanders right from her seat gave out a a
[1:54:35] a word of the Lord she gave a word of
[1:54:37] knowledge about exactly what I was going
[1:54:39] to preach
[1:54:40] on and so after that All the nervousness
[1:54:43] left me I preached and the whole almost
[1:54:46] the whole altar was filled with people
[1:54:48] repenting and that was my sign that God
[1:54:51] had cleansed my my lips and called me to
[1:54:53] preach I never doubt it again if I was
[1:54:55] called to preach or not
[1:54:57] Hallelujah because the fire of God had
[1:54:59] come down to cleans me when I started
[1:55:01] memorizing the Bible I've been baptized
[1:55:03] and then God's spirit met me back there
[1:55:05] and God's spirit gave me so many
[1:55:06] witnesses God had cleansed my lips
[1:55:08] cleansed my mouth and now nobody can
[1:55:10] take it away from me because God let me
[1:55:12] experience it hallelujah amen an angel
[1:55:15] brought aive call cleaned out my lips
[1:55:18] and let me speak for Jesus Christ
[1:55:20] Hallelujah and now I get to speak for
[1:55:23] heaven like Isaiah did of course I'm
[1:55:24] very small in comparison but God still
[1:55:27] needs preachers today that will preach
[1:55:30] for heaven that their mouth has been
[1:55:32] cleaned out by the Holy Ghost
[1:55:36] Hallelujah that's my testimony praise
[1:55:38] God and I was there when it happened I
[1:55:41] ought to know praise God I do
[1:55:46] know but the spirit of burning is
[1:55:49] here that's what people need they need
[1:55:51] such a experience with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:53] well they know they're
[1:55:55] forgiven and they know they're going to
[1:55:58] say the right thing instead of unclean
[1:56:02] things praise
[1:56:05] God and it won't be I go down there and
[1:56:07] youel up okay I got the Holy Ghost no
[1:56:09] you will feel ashamed of yourself you'll
[1:56:11] weep but say you'll boohoo you'll cry
[1:56:13] you'll have a real
[1:56:15] experience a Heavenly coal is going to
[1:56:17] touch your mouth that's not something
[1:56:20] light that's something heavy Hallelujah
[1:56:22] that's something you won't forget
[1:56:24] hallelujah how to remember all those
[1:56:26] things that happened in 2004 how do to
[1:56:27] remember that 21 years later because it
[1:56:29] was
[1:56:31] Supernatural because I haven't been the
[1:56:33] same since it happened to
[1:56:37] me Hallelujah let's bow our heads for a
[1:56:40] moment here Church you know if you're a
[1:56:42] man or woman of unclean lips saying the
[1:56:45] wrong thing you know because the spirit
[1:56:48] of judgment is here hallelujah amen
[1:56:55] the spirit of judgment will convict us
[1:56:57] and say I've said evil
[1:56:59] things and I'm amongst evil
[1:57:03] people so what's your response to that
[1:57:05] Lord you're right I am unclean woe is me
[1:57:08] I do speak evil things that's the right
[1:57:13] answer
[1:57:15] Hallelujah the spirit of
[1:57:19] judgment that's what Jesus said the Holy
[1:57:21] Ghost will convict us of sin Jesus
[1:57:23] Christ said
[1:57:25] that
[1:57:28] Hallelujah and if God can get somebody
[1:57:31] to say that I'm an unclean person I say
[1:57:34] unclean dirty things if God can get a
[1:57:37] person to say that God will send next
[1:57:39] the spirit of burning Hallelujah to burn
[1:57:43] up all that sin out of someone's heart
[1:57:46] and forgive
[1:57:49] them but the person really has to meet
[1:57:53] it how many know Jesus Christ is the
[1:57:55] same yesterday today and
[1:58:00] forever it's
[1:58:02] true see I don't know where everybody's
[1:58:04] at in their walk with God I don't know I
[1:58:06] don't live with you only you live with
[1:58:10] you and God I said last week put this on
[1:58:13] my heart I've been studying waiting on
[1:58:14] it for a couple weeks to
[1:58:16] preach but I'm sure if it's in the word
[1:58:18] of God I'm sure our church wants to
[1:58:20] believe it I'm sure our church
[1:58:22] appreciates the word of God
[1:58:25] hallelujah let's bow our heads for a
[1:58:27] moment
