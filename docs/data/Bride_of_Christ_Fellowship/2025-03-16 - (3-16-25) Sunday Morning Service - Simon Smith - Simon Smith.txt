========================================

morning we are uh here uh this week has been extremely I'm sure all you uh Saints who have lives which we all do um things have just it's non-stop uh was it three visited three things yesterday we helped the guy start lifting his roof and then went to a Mr Bub's little thing there then had to go fix my mom's well then Uncle cousin Matt called once his toilet was like so we ran ran ran all day and um but that's like it seems like it's every day now I'm just like Lord how do I slow how do I slow this down how do we we don't want to be that third ground in the parable the sewer where the cares of the world will choke out the fruit amen so we want to be those who are LED of the Lord and um uh as far as we want to help people want to be a blessing to people uh we want to do all those things uh that the Lord uh requires of us I know a time where the prophet of God said he said um he said yeah one time I was in prayer or however and he said he said the Lord had me go and just split wood for a widow sister so and that was his duty for the day was to go split W wood not study not pray not just but go there and help this poor widow woman and you know the Bible says that uh helping the fatherless and helping the widows is True Religion undefiled so saints of God if you can't find nothing to do for the kingdom look for those who don't have a father look for those who their husbands have passed on and focus on those individuals amen there's always people are in need saints of God there are um it's uh I think we Shar had brother um uh Malachi there was stating how the persecution is ramping up it's ramping up uh the last one of the last times I was down in uh nvar Church there brother Levi and brother Ben they asked me to minister on the Jezebel spirit which was the last one I've never taught on it but if you look at what the prophet of God says about that if you look how he speaks on it I was remember was nickan it started with man first he says and then it switched from man to a woman so if and I was as I was thinking on those things and uh trying to teach the best we could by God's grace and yield um first the the thing the the group that hates the word the most is that man that uh nickan system right moves into bism and then but at the end when it comes down to the pure word that Spirit doesn't stay on the the the clergy it jumps on the people now and who's the people it's the church it's the woman see so and and as I was speaking on um Friday night at uh the the house meeting there um I was speaking and and I was looking I was talking to a sister there and I was looking at my wife because she asked brother Simon she asked me a couple questions sister you made it praise the Lord she's feeling great um uh by the grace of God um just showing how when Jesus came to be crucified the people the people gathered and they had they grab the palm trees and worshiping hosana uh him who comes in the name they worshiping him but within four three four week whatever they were say yelling crucified that thing switched that fast true worshippers and it switched that fast it went from what all these nicians what it went to Jezebel just like that so anyhow uh it just shows uh the most the not only the sincerity but we've got to stay with that word uh and and this as we coming into this and as you search the quotes as you look at the scripture this Rapture and the Great Tribulation are just a day away one day separates the bride from the Great Tribulation just one day and we've got to prepare ourselves for that day amen so I mean it we're going to see things get out of control we're going to see as our brothers and sisters and brother Malachi sharing the people the persecution they're not they're not even message Believers they're just standing for Jesus what what they know of Christ a trinity a false baptism but they're still standing for Jesus and they're taking the persecution they're taking that thing and uh may God give us strength we but we know there's a bride that's called that's not called to martyrdom that's not called to death in this hour and SS of God that's why this word has come to prepare a bride to not see death to give us all the spiritual vitamins to give us all the spiritual understanding that we would not see death that we would have we would be able to discern the framework of the church the spirit the two Spirits right and get out of those things amen so uh in saying that that's been on my heart and um yeah that that brother just sent me a picture of that Pastor just got left for dead I'll just say it like that left for dead on the side of the road and being unconscious and um if you don't have anything to pray for pray pray for overseas man we are so blessed here but our time's coming Saints we're going to we're going to have to stand for the word I if I if I could I could read you that quote uh I think it's from the peramine pergan church age sermon if you look at those sermons very inspired very Holy Ghost LED and a lot of speaking in tongues and prophecy came or interpret ation tongues came and he and the Holy Ghost literally said he said they're they're they're planning this night to destroy America he said but when you get into that spot of persecution he says alls I want you to do is testify in my name and stand on the word of God I have to read the quote but he said he he just glorify God in that time just like uh um Paul and Silas were in that prison they just started singing to the Lord Jesus Christ and God came down and freed the captives we must never let those things go don't let those things slip out of our minds May these things become written Epistles on our hearts amen so praise the Lord Saints um know it's kind of like a sobering thought there sobering start uh but this has been on my heart I have not taught this angle at home uh I don't have a whole lot but saints of God we're going to go and see if the Lord would I I want to say what he wants me to say or I'm trying to yield every every service the Lord allows me to minister I want to yield more I want to be able to say not hold back but just say what we need to say um knowing we're all given going to give an account on that day of our actions our words our thoughts especially our thoughts amen anyhow let's stand here for the reading word let's go to Ecclesiastes 911 Ecclesiastes 911 and we trust this morning will be a blessing to you um let's read here Ecclesiastes 911 and then we'll say a word of prayer he says I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill he says but time and chance happeneth to them all amen let's say a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and Lord God we ask you be in the midst Lord God we welcome you here Lord they've sung the songs of Zion Lord they've lifted you up Lord from their hearts from their minds Lord for you are worthy God lord and Lord Jesus Lord we need more of you God lord we need more anointing God lord more uh favor Lord more strength God lord Jesus Lord and Lord we've got to clean ourselves up God and get right to where we need to be Lord at the coming of the Lord and Lord Jesus Lord it seems like every service Lord is a lamp trimming service God and yet Lord uh that Midnight Cry God we've got to be ready Lord when that that uh it almost it almost seems Lord God that at that midnight where that lamp uh where that cry went forth Lord even the wise and foolish were out of line their focus it just wasn't clear they just couldn't see the time the season they were in yet it come all of a sudden out of nowhere The Voice rang out and Lord Jesus Lord be with us Lord God as we know that uh that cry could strike any moment Lord be with us Lord help us to watch Lord examine ourselves God lord be our brother and sister keeper God and Lord we certainly love and appreciate you lord lord just bless the service God lord just anoint give me thoughts God lord anoint me Lord for this service God Lord for this word Lord that I would stay right with it God lord and bring it in Simplicity God which I it's the only way I know how to do it Lord or how I can you Lord if I if I can just teach it simply Lord God we love you Lord bless the people God strengthen God keep them Lord be with Pastor Jesse Lord give him full health God lord and Lord we certainly Love You Lord uh in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats there so saints of God if you ever have a little root of a root of berness maybe a little rude of jealousy and like why does this brother always do good at this or why do or you look at your coworker uh someone that uh you're boss and you say man how does he get all these things and this and that and uh how come my brother my sister always uh gets a good thing here or a good thing there or SS of God it's all time and chance it's I like this I've met a quite a few rich man that have no wisdom Millionaires and yet don't want a Bible study driving BMWs and use the name of Jesus Christ as a swear word has a curse word constantly has a big bank account and yet the things of God they won't even they don't even want to talk about him I said sir I said he said what about this or that he goes he goes me and my wife he says we don't talk about that even at home and yet he's got such a mind he can make money just like he's at the Federal Reserve print it [Music] off he's got such a mind he knows how to do business deals he knows how to do this how money just falls on the lap but he wants nothing to do with God and I as I've seen these men I I'm just like Lord how come I can't do this how come Lord why don't have you give me a mind like that a business mind for this and than God it always comes back to this scripture it's time and chance why is this sister always uh this sister right here got healed right here why maybe maybe the sister that got healed and you didn't get your healing that time she might have been in condition she might have been praying and fasting setting what getting her heart ready getting her right mind ready for what to receive a healing touch amen because God honors one thing and that's Faith have you fed yourself the word so your faith is Big so your faith is strong that all things are possible have you limited Jesus Christ well how come this brother always has a this Revelation or he man he he always catches this Revelation and I don't catch these Revelations why do some us this why do some catch Revelations and some don't I wish I could be revelated I wish I could read the word and these saints of God in the in Matthew 16 Jesus was preaching a sermon and actually he didn't preach a sermon he just he just said a oneline parable he said Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the scribes Beware of the leaven of Herod he said Beware of the leaven he said of those things and the disciples could not understand what he was saying they thought he was talking about natural bread because what they had forgotten to take bread with him as they crossed over and and Jesus saw he noticed they forgot bread and he wanted to bring something along that lines and he said he talked about leav he talked about leav and they they thought in their own own wisdom he was talking about bread but it came to a spot where God actually said he said he why have you not understood these things and then the Bible says at the very end of that portion they said he say then they understood that he was talking about the doctrine and you know what in MA in the Book of Matthew 16 the Bible does not reveal why the disciples could not catch the mind of Christ there but if you turn to the Book of Mark it's revealed why they could not catch the revelation of that parable you know what the r the problem was the B Jesus said he says he say have your hearts become hardened search your hearts I'm telling you as I've as the last three years God has dealt with me so much on the heart everything everything revolves around the condition of your heart because notice if you come to this church and brother Jesse's preaching the true seed when that true seed hits It's hits all of you you are here at every service you're pulling on the word but depending on the condition your heart when that seed hits your heart hits your mind that's what it's going to produce if you have a Stony heart and you you're oh brother Malachi I wish I you're jealous of brother Malakai whatever is being preached and you have jealousy in your heart is not going to produce like someone who who's just like I'm not jealous of brother Malachi I'm just like thankful thank God we have a piano player thank God he's got his fingers like this and like that and he can make the joyful sound I don't have to do it that's his gift right now we can just enjoy and sing and praise God absolutely SS of God yeah that's right see but if you if you're you coming in here and your heart's not in the right condition you will not receive the revelation of the word amen just a little something like that you know what else he said about the hard heart remember the Bible said Jesus he said he came walking on the sea and the disciples are going who is this it looks like Christ they thought it was a ghost and they see this man walking and when it came up it was Jesus and they're like he walks on water but he they just watched him do a miracle where he took these Five Loaves or these these fishes and he multiplied the F and he fed fed the the the 5,000 right you know why they had such a hard time with him walking in water but sorry Jesus himself said what he said he says your heart is hard in other words you limited God oh I did this but maybe he can't walk on water SS of God Jesus Christ can do anything amen if there's anything in your life right now that you're battling do not limit God he is more than able think great things I say like this I was just thinking the other day my my my boss text my old boss text me it was 311 that's why my Apprentice died 10 years ago newbie and when he text me I said Lord I believe even right now that you could raise him from the dead and still save him because I believe all things are possible if Jesus at at his at in that Garden he was praying and what he he was he was all Faith there was no doubt in him he was perfect he was the son of God he said Lord if it be possible that this cup pass let it pass he believed that what that he that God could even somehow find a loophole maybe maybe Jesus misinterpreted the word and I didn't have to take this death he did not have to give his life for sacrifice he said Lord if it's possible that I can bypass this why he believed all things were possible but he said he said not my will but thy will be done do not ever limit Jesus Christ because he can amen so as we see this here he says but time and chance happeneth to them all sometimes I Marvel as I'm getting older I'm having realizations I'm seeing pains I've never seen before I'm I'm experiencing things I'm really I'm realizing how fast time goes especially when around my nephews and nieces and I'm just like like this now what happened to me where did I miss this time moves on continually it does not stop it does not wait there there every every second every minute you have an opportunity to do something you have an opportunity to what live choose life or choose death to choose positivity or to choose negativity to to choose Faith or unbelief but we who are the seed of God we're going we're going to choose Faith every time everything written in the scripture for you we believe it SS of God there we're going to have to walk through the valley of the shadow of death but remember it's only a shadow it's going to be a scarecrow because what light is right behind that in other words you the only way you see a shadow is the sun's still out amen and the s o n is still on the scene but an enemy comes up and gets in the way and it looks like he's not there but I'm telling you what Saints he's right there amen he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen saints of God take that to the bank amen no matter where you find yourself in fact we were doing that that that house service for C sister Julie witness to a family they're starting to come in they're starting to see the word this and we do song we actually we eat we Fellowship a little bit then we do songs that we're doing these songs I'm looking around all these young children and I think Lord what is their end because I know we I believe we're very close what is their end 10 years old 5 years old four years old I said Lord God what are where are we going to be a year from now and I'm just like Lord please God keep us give us strength God Lord Lord lead us and guide us you said you would lead us and guide us Lord and I believe we have the Holy Ghost and I'm counting on that that he will keep his word amen why we're going to we're going to try the word amen Lord you said and I'm going to count to it and I believe you're going to do it and I know you're going to do it amen that just settles it for me right because we look at the word we might not feel the anointing we might not give a sign or a Wonder however you want to say but if we can just take that word and hold to it saints of God and believe it it's going to happen nothing can stop it amen so uh getting into this here by God's grace I'd like to speak on artificial intelligence I know been watching a lot of Elon Musk lately and Elon Elon what is artificial intelligence they say they're building computers that are going to be so smart they'll be wor do gods they'll know all things like that all the it's already that in Google you just type any question you have an answer now they'll lied to you because I called a couple [Laughter] lies last week I was doing a study and I was studying I was like when did the Catholic church start Google oh as soon as the apostles started on I was like you liar you liar and then I said what was the significance of 325 ad oh nothing it actually started in 500 you love SS of God there's only one truth and that's what the word of God and God what he said his Messenger to tell us the truth amen why because what history is going to be skewed what information's going to be skewed everything's going to be excuse things of God there let every man be a liar and God's word be true amen you have caught the Revelation and nothing can take you once I like this once you see it you can't unsee it right if you're truly revelated you cannot unsee it so what is artificial in intelligence refers to the development of computer systems capable performing tasks that typically require human intelligence such as reasoning learning decisionmaking percep sounds like the spirit realm huh memory what is art artificial intelligence is like this you're like nothing right and all of a sudden a computer guy just starts writing a code starts writing a program and whatever is in the mind of this guy he starts putting in here and then he gets all done with his super code or whatever he does system or whatever software and he pumps it into this thing robot or computer and now that robot that's what they know but they're programmed to reach out and to gather information and then add that information to the knowledge and then they reach out again they gather more information or more intelligence more history more facts or whatever they want to say and then they start growing it becomes self-growing it becomes a cell it becomes a life but it's artificial it's not real it's not real life what are they trying to do they're trying to produce life but we know God is the only one that can create Satan cannot create life he can only pervert life he can only take something that's alive he can only take the materials that God made right here and then produce something that's not in the original tasks that require human intelligence such as reasoning learning decision making and perception deep learning machine learning and natural language processing Technologies all those sort of things right but what's the original I'll say like this what's the original artificial intelligence we're the same way when you're a baby how much did you know when you're a baby sister uh Haven how much did you know when you were baby nothing but you were a sponge born a little baby sponge right and as the baby Spong is Sister Haven's like drinking the milks and looking around at Malai and Lydia walking around she's like she's taking things in and she begins to learn she learns how to adapt to her surroundings but then once maybe say maybe say she's a super genius and she gets as smart as Malachi and now she's like Malachi I already know all the things you know who must I go to now to learn greater things she tapped out she knows everything Malachai knows now she must go to Daddy Daddy what are your uh ways in PJ and Educational Learning and all those sort of things with your PhD or however you and then uh sister Haven learns all that she's like Dad tell me more and he's like I'm tapped out and yet in all her learning she's limited still why because we have artificial intelligence if we're to draw a circle here on the wall just like Kent hovin said we draw a big circle on the wall and all of this circle is all knowledge that's God's brain that's God's intellect all of that and still still be limiting right but let's say we God could put all his intelligence in a circle how much would you really know let me say like this how much do you know about science a little piece of the pie here how much I'm say this how much do you know about Plumbing come on [Laughter] grasshoppers see how limited we are how much do I know about electrical engineering zero can I change the socket absolutely can I wire up a house absolutely but do I understand it no how much do we really know maai how many keys are on the piano I don't even know that how much do you really know so God sends us here and allows us to grow in wisdom as Jesus Christ came he grew what in wisdom and in stature even Christ had to grow in knowledge and understanding but what he had a shift he had the shift one time there's a spot in his life and I was I believe it was early on we had to L learn to lose his mind and take on the the mind of the father because even at 12 years old we find him what at the temple what disputing and talking with the priest and what' he say he says woman he says I'm about my father's business at a young age Christ had already forgot and did not really lean on his own understanding he wanted to be totally led by the holy spirit amen now he says this wisdom which I've have seen also the son it seemed great unto me he said there's a little city and few men within it and there be there came a great king against it and besieged it and great built great Bullocks against it now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city amen what if this was a city right here what if we were a small group but SS of God one of us has the wisdom to what overcome the enemy amen SS of God he's a and yet no man remember he says and by his wisdom he delivered the city a poor wise man he had no money no no no wi riches no wealth no vast Empire but he God gave him a little wisdom what so the what he could save and God set it up what it say he says he says a poor wise man he was born poor I'm sure or however but one day he found himself poor but his whole life from there he was acquiring wisdom maybe he had time to watch things maybe he didn't have a job he was a beggar however he just watched things he watched people and you can learn a lot by just watching you can learn a lot just by listening I remember one time my I came home one time my dad was living with me and he said s he was he was sitting in the back porch like he always does like this actually sit like this he just sit there on the back pores like this on his on his feet he said fall had not started yet and he's just looking out into the yard and he said he saw one one leaf fall off a tree just like this one leaf and it hit the ground wow he goes it started and he looked back at that tree and another fell he said Simon I watched I sat there all day every leaf fell off that tree that day and I thought how fast can a tree fade and yet we see in the fall some some trees take forever to lose all their leaves some never even lose all the leaves all foring the winter and my dad right there he was gaining wisdom he's like wow a man can die in one day A tree can die in one day others last on death hits him a little bit slower just by what watching not the Bible say he says watch nature and it'll teach thee look at the ants they labor they labor they labor why because winterers comeing we got to go stored up amen he said he said watch watch this watch that he said these things will teach you they'll give you wisdom you will learn from these sort of things amen you can learn a lot from nature sure he says then said I he says wisdom is better than strength so one poor wise man God gave him enough wisdom to dece to defeat or or cast off or whatever what a conquering King so what would you rather have wisdom or do we have power and force and money amen now let's continue here in Proverbs or sorry Psalms 39:5 behold thou Hast made my days as a hand breath and my age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is alog together vanity when I was 21 22 5 foot three and a half 125 could run like the wind but not real fast but enough man I thought I had it going on and I'm looking back complete vanity I had no idea what I was even thinking at that age sometimes we think we got to figure it out you give it a couple years as brother R said he a couple passings of the Sun and you'll find out how wise you were back then think about yourself right now and wait another year and say man I was lacking here I wasn't exactly where I needed to be but you at your best state these young men right here they're young they're strong they're they're they they probably should have probably tons of energy at your best state spity at your I like this you get done with the college and you start getting your you get Magnum L and you think you've got all the knowledge you think you're a absolute pure genius uh uh Savant or whatever you say thanks of God at that State you're completely vanity one time I went to hospital we got to a call in the do in the doctor's office doctors nurses they're all right there they said the sink's bad the sink's plugged I go in there and I'm like had to get you know go through my little uh safety orientation however I get in there I'm looking at that sink that kitchen sink where they wash their dishes the doctors nurses is like right up to the brim I'm like man there might be some diseases in here there might be who knows what in here what do they throw down here you know this must be real I mean we're dealing with Doctor these guys are smart and they know must be a real problem so I did I grabbed a big five gallon bucket I put underneath the sink under the Trap I started loosening these things real softly the the nuts there I let the Trap drop very little water what's going on here look on the sink is still completely full I'm like you got roll up my sleeve sure enough the strainer they can they can pull they can literally take our minds and switch them brother but they can't understand understand that when you put that stopper in the sink it's not going to drain WIS man at his best state is alog together vanity I marveled and I said I'm the smartest man in this [Laughter] room see it doesn't matter this means nothing what you think about yourself what you think you could accomplish what you think you have accomplished what things you think you've done for God SS of God we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost who is our example Jesus Christ was our example and you know what Jesus Christ's example was what his mission his life was to what fulfill the father's will am that is pure wisdom that is what we have SS of God we have to get the mind of Christ let me give you some good examples here this I mean let me let let me say like this even right here even right here right right at the fall right at the beginning Adam and Eve knew God before the fall they were in total commun they felt the presence of God God they were Eternal at this time they were not going to die they had perfect health perfect mind there was everything was happy everything was joyful but after the fall look at their first move look at their wisdom how their how their spiritual intuition their discernment kicked in what did they have after right after the fall and the eyes of them both were open and they knew they were naked and they sued sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons what's the Fig Tree why they use fig leaves because that's Jewish that represents Israel remember the Fig Tree he said when you see that fig Jesus said Matthew 24 if you see that fig tree blooming who's that fig tree Israel is showing what the Israel that Israeli religion Jewish religion is not going to cut it but now also look at look at what they used they used leaves and not fruit remember the brid tree sermon all those we got the kker the pal room each one of those Spirits each one of those bugs ate something off the bride tree what did they eat first they ate the fruit first he says why he said he said he took away the fruit see the spirit see they had left they had sinned and what the spirit of God had left they could not get the fruits but since they could not get the fruits they could not cover themselves with the spirit anymore they had to go for the leaves and what do the leaves represent Fellowship without the spirit without the fruit well maybe we just got to Fellowship brother and God bless brother maybe just hang out sometime you know fellowship and you know this and this and maybe that's that's what's going to make that's what's going to make God happy so happy he just fellowshipping you can Fellowship you can talk about hunting and fishing you can talk about work you can talk SS of God if it's not about the Holy Ghost if it's not about the word of God that's not the worship God's looking for that's not the fellowship God's looking for and yet that's in their wisdom in their fallen state in their wisdom they thought Fellowship was going to do it oh we'll just cover ourselves with Fellowship we'll just go and do this and have this and have that and just get together and join and eat and have a good time play volleyball and also the fellowship that's not what God's looking for but God had to what he had to take a lamb and wrap them around with lamb skins which represented who Jesus Christ and who is Jesus Christ the word if God wrapped himself in the word in the beginning the logos then what else is he going to wrap his wife in would not he dress his wife in the exact same thing that he's dressed in see that's why he's going to be a word bride in this day amen yes a word bride praise the Lord now let's look here in the process of time that Cain brought the fruits to the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought the firstlings of the flock and the fat thereof and the Lord had respect un Abel and to his offering now notice he says now look at Cain and Abel both of them were sincere Cain took by his wisdom after his mother Church Eve so who ate of that tree Eve was first the mother ate that and that inter that like intellectual Fallen wisdom passed on to her son how many knows that Eve was the mother of Cain yeah sure all right his mother he took reasoning see wisdom his own wisdom a beautiful sacrifice he had flowers he had fruit of the field he said surely he was just like he said it was just like Satan said to Eve surely surely God will receive my sacrifice what is God looking for he's looking for a broken and contrite spirit where's that located right in the heart remember the Bible said the meek shall inherit the earth you read them Beatitudes that SS of God that's the bride he's looking for someone so humble so willing to serve his spirit so willing to what lay before the s o n yeah notice a beautiful sacrifice he had flowers fruit of the field he said uh he said just like this Easter will be they'll spend millions of dollars Across the Nation to put Easter flowers on some altars he says altars wasn't made for flowers it was for sacrifice see shows the same old Cain Spirit of Cain right there's one thing there's one thing God wants he wants you he wants to harness your will he wants not to be just God he wants to be your lord now let me let me jump right and what was I like that's why this this section of scripture is so important because brother Bram he said he reveals what they're missing he what Cain was missing was the Revelation that sin came through that blood he missed the revelation of the original sin he thought it was something else he never caught the thought of serpent seed he never understood the fall the mixture of the serpent see why that Revelation so important the original sin Revelation is very very important it shows now let's continue on here by God's grace let me jump there look at this here there's a time where the Philistines were ready to take over Kila or however you want to say that City that Kila City then they told David saying behold the Philistines fight against Kila and they rob the threshing floors notice a situation comes up and attack comes up something unexpected happens in David's life and in the life of a people in the city think about now think about yourselves here too man this came out of nowhere brother Simon I didn't even see this coming what we got a problem therefore David what the first thing he do inquired of the Lord saying shall I go and smite the Philistines Lord do you want me to deliver these people this enem is coming the enemy is not coming after me it's coming after this people is that we're seeing right now persecution saints of God we need to intercede he says and the Lord said to David go and smite the Philistines and save Kila so now he's commissioned he asked Lord what do you want me to do here the Lord said you go do it you go pray through for him you go break through the spiritual boundaries and what take on these Supernatural Devils what and cast them out amen and David's Med said to him behold we have been afraid here in Judah how much more than if we come to Keli against the armies of the philis no now so David tolds the boys his voice God's given us to us but the boys said man I don't know he's I don't know you sure you heard heard that right we're doing with Philistines again I mean we still got a small little band here he said what are we going to do and David's man said unto much more and David what inquired the Lord again and the Lord answered him said arise go down to kila and I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand notice so God so God gives him a thus say the Lord Again David said boys we're going to win trust the word of God they what they trusted their King they trusted their leader amen while he was a man of God he was anointed by the Holy Ghost he had he could G he could receive the word of God and bring it to the people amen what a Shepherd amen sure he was feeding them good food True Food now notice they went and they fought and they conquered and what God then they stayed in that City now what they had thus say the Lord they went and conquered and now David's like man we got to get here boys we're like Heroes this city is like they're going to we might be king maybe this is where our kingdom will start right here maybe this is where God's going to set set it up right here maybe we'll have a throne right here this will be our city right here the city of David why because what God used us to deliver them how happy were those Saints how how happy were those people in Kila extremely grateful death was right on him and God S A Deliverance hand right there he says now notice and it came to pass and it was told David it was told Saul that David came to kila and Saul said God has delivered him into mine hand for he shut in by entering into a town that that hath Gates and bars and Saul called all the people together to war to go down to kilan and besiege David and his men and David knew that Saul secretly practiced Mischief against him and he said to abathar the priest bring hither the ephod something's coming guys I just have I got this feeling the Lord something in the spirit saying there's there's danger ahead and he was right Saul was fixing to come and get him then to David oh Lord God of Israel thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Kad to destroy the city for my sake will the men deliver me up these are the very men that God sent he sent him to save he got thus say the Lord God said go save them David set up he's like living large now he's like he's got it going on and then now another enemy is actually coming for him but hey we're in this people these people will brought protect me I just saved them God used me right here to bring a Deliverance for these people I put my life in jeopardy my blood was on the line my men's blood was on the line if we were to perish our wives our children had no one but we put it on the line because what we had thus sayith the Lord and now the thought enters David will these men if D if if Saul comes will these men betray me will the men of say uh Kila deliver me up into his hand will Saul come down as thy servant ha heard or the or oh Lord God of Israel I beseeched thee tell thy servant the Lord said he will come down and David's like yeah but you didn't answer that first part of the question okay he's coming but uh he said then said David with the men of kilad deliver me he says and my men into the hand of Saul and they said they will deliver thee up in David's own wisdom he could have sat there in that City and be like hey I just saved these guys they owe me one now they're going to join me we'll take Saul on or however what is but he had he could not rely on his own wisdom do you see only the wisdom of God now well brother Simon why would God why would God allow tell David to Def fight to go and save the very city that was going to betray him why would he do that David knows nothing he just sees a he just sees people coming to take down the city he's like Lord what do I do he say go deliver him defeats him now he's safe and sound they're locked in here nothing can get to them and now he hears his enemy now coming why would God do that the wisdom of God far exceeds our wisdom you know the difference between God's wisdom and our wisdom he knows the past he knows the present and he knows the future of every single thing that's going to take place we are so limited realize how limited you are we have plans for tomorrow but what's really going to take place you know why God preserved Kila because Down the Road God was going to use a man from Kila to help rebuild the Temple but God knows the end from the beginning if he would not have Saed them there there had been no this man to fulfill his part God knows he knows things he knows his plan and all David did why do I have to go fight for these people he didn't ask Lord I don't want to do it he just said Lord said go do it and he did it he didn't ask any questions he just went and did it then this thing comes he said Lord they going to betray me he said absolutely going to betray you get out of there he gets out and David's like I don't even know what just took place right here but God did think about lot what was the whole point of lot God told Abraham Abraham leave this country leave your father leave your mother come follow me I'm going to make you a great man I'm I'm going to bless you and anyone that will bless you will be blessed anyone that curs you be cursed yet we find lot join up with them was that the hand of God absolutely we see they separate lot goes down to Sodom God comes down says he boys I'm I'm going to just drop Sodom gomor I'm going to destroy him with uh Brimstone fire right and God brings two angels down delivers pulls lot out his wife turns to Stone Salt I'm sorry salt lot flees with the two daughters we know till it takes place there but did you know there was a seed within a lot called Ruth the moabitas God knows the end from the beginning every single thing is time and chance God knows your every move he he's going to use your failures for something good he's going to use your mistakes to preserve life he's going to use your your every Everything You Think You're lacking all your weaknesses all your human ability that you seem to put in place of the wisdom of God if we try to use our wisdom AB our own ability sints of God we're going to fail but he's going to take those failures and make something out of it see David had artificial ficial intelligence he did not know the mind of God until he sought the Lord but once now now once he got his upgrades from The Mastermind from the mind of Christ he knew what to do he didn't understand it he just knew what to do he didn't know the outcome he just knew what to do amen and SS of God in your lives we got to what find the mind of Christ because it's going to impact things down the road you know you could be such a light then what people will mistake you for christ Prophet God said he said there's coming a time he said where he said the where the bride will be so anointed they'll be walking he is walking Idols the shadows will heal again the bride will come to the stature of of perfection amen now look at this and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about all his enemies that the king said to Nathan the prophet now here's the king the anointed David the king the one that killed the the Philistines the one that killed the Giants he had he he killed he slew it all he says now see now I dwell in the house of Cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains something remember he was a man after God's Own Heart in his heart was bubbling up he says I have such a nice place to live but what about my God what about the one that spared my life time and time again as I saw swords cross right through could have got my throat and God had me duck or that that one brother of Goliath was attacking me and abashi came in and slew him God delivered me from all my enemies amen he said should not God the god of Heaven have a place to live a house here on Earth amen something's bubbling up on him what that anointing to build the temp was getting close was drawing nigh and was striking the king why because he was still communion with the spirit he still what had the type of the Holy Ghost right there and what that Spirit was pressing this pressing this pressing this and now no it's the prophet of God now he speaks out of turn he says go and do all that is nine heart he says for the Lord is with thee the prophet did not seek the Lord all the prophet was looking at was a man that loved God so much and God has brought you from a sheep herder brought you from this gave you uh wives children gave you the kingdom protected you for 20 years running from Saul all these things protected you he gave and he he surely God is with this one I see the anointing on him I see what the movement of the spirit on him I see him all those sort of things God is with you brother amen do it what is what is on your heart God go do it amen cuz you're a man after God's Own Heart The Prophet said it but he failed to seek the word of the Lord because we're limited here in wisdom you and I probably made the same call Pastor Jesse you feel alled to do this go for it absolutely brother the Malai you want to make you God gave you a song and you want to play it for this this and praise the Lord Go sing it absolutely but what does God want you feel led to do this or you feel led to do that you feel burning your heart for lost souls you be burning for this we've got to seek the Lord and find out what to do about it and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan saying go and tell thy servant David thus say Lord Thou shalt build shalt thou build me a house to dwell in now we know the answer right God said it's not for you to build he says you're a bloody man he says but your son that comes out of your body he says he will build me a house amen we have to know the mind of God he says he shall build a house for my name and I establish the Throne of his kingdom forever yeah now saints of God we want to become now we're given the re we're given Malachi 4 SS of God there's not been an age there's not been a people on the face of the Earth who who understand the word like you know it right now believe it or not no one has understood the word like you were given this thing was given I I heard brother brother Brook say one time he went and met him and brother Craig met went and met a sister a sister woman preacher and they brought the message in a church age book to him and they called it the wedding ring this is the engagement ring you want to make the Rapture you want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ read this do what it says to do in here she turned it down but just like brother B talking to the priest the priest said he says God is in his church and the prophet said he says he says what he says God is in his word if you have a desire in your heart but you don't know which way to go just start reading start seeking the Holy Ghost Lord open this door Lord I want I need this in my life or I desire this because he'll give you the desires of your heart as well if my word abide in you and you abide in my word he say ask what you will but I believe the bride's going to go out with this he says as I was with you and weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech he says and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and Power saints of God this is what we're going out like it should be like that right now let me show you something demonstration of the spirit and power right remember that story brother Braham he was talking that man he was a uh car mechanic or however he worked he brother said his hands were all busted up because he working on cars all day trying to get them back in shape they're in accents all those sort of things he said but he was so moved by the holy ghost he would take his family and drive 1500 miles every weekend to get to the messages in Jeffersonville he said one day he one day he was at a certain place and he left his car and left the keys in the car he said some boy young boy was in there looking he went there and stole the car he said he came back he's like just hanging real low like what do I do Lord and brother B said he says he says let's seek the Lord Brother B he didn't know what to do he did not know what to do he said but he knew who one who does know what to do what he do he says he says what I do he says I place the word that promis before God he says Lord God you see my brother's sacrifice you see how he needs his car you see how he's provides for his family cost he said it cost him $70 every weekend to go to church back in 1960s in the 1960s $70 brother Jose what was what was $70 back in 1960 a lot of money without without hesitation he says a lot of money that's a lot of cash that's a portion of his check so the prophet gets down he says boys he says let's pray because he doesn't know what to do that car is gone long gone that guy's High talented Bowling Green Kentucky and passed he says I took I played that word that promise before God sealed it in the name of Jesus Christ and sent forth the word right down the road and went way out there found the place where it started like a hound on a rabbit Trail see here he come right down the road howling got down there halfway to Bing Kentucky what broke forth the vision the word found him when this SE when these situations happen because they're going to happen did Jesus ever promise promise us a a bed of ease with flowers and rose petals and just walking and skipping down the yellow brick road life is so easy I'm in America I'm in the message no right right but it's War the devil knew that man drove that car, 15500 miles $70 of gas every weekend the devil says I don't like his sacrifice anoints a man to go steal it but then all we all they had to do was ask get down to the throne and say Lord please deliver my brother this this was not for brother bam this was not he was this was for somebody else he prayed and said he said Lord you said by Your Word you could ask what you need and Lord he needs his car back he needs it for his family he needs it for his work he needs to go to church Lord he serves you Faithful and he said he sealed it in the name of Jesus Christ you've got to have faith in that he said said a simple prayer in the name of Jesus he ended it with the name of Jesus Christ he sealed it with that because that's our mediator that's our Salvation right there he was the one that shed his blood he was the one that Sent His holy ghost down amen and by the by trusting in the son what he did what it activates the holy spirit because he put Faith in that blood it's all we got to do now almost done here God's grace he says this is this saints of God this is one of my favorite one of my favorite portions of scripture one of them I love this because the holy spirit will never keep you at a milk level as far as Revelation in the Bible Bible Revelation bible understanding he'll never keep you at a milk he'll not let you be a babe for I'll say this when I when I lost everything and uh when I was a heathen in college and I came back to my mom's church it was within one year year and a half that was God sent this message I had already grown that fast under denominational milk to where I'm like it's the same same stuff same milk do you ever notice like if you go get a gallon of milk every gulp's going to taste like milk The Taste never changes you can actually get sick of it well if you drink it like constantly but if one once you go from milk to meat you can cook that meat all kinds of ways then you get to other solid foods and that's what gives you more vitamins more nutrients more strength and you taste things that you would never tasted if you would just stayed on if you would have stayed on milk he said but God hath revealed to him Us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God this is this is beautiful if you have the Holy Ghost he's going to show you the deeper things saints of God I just taught a study down Junction City and they loved it because what it was a deeper thing they said for Simon I needed to hear that and I showed him Simplicity but it was deep it was simple as far as it was hidden he was hidden in the word of God he says for what man knoweth the the things of man he's to save the spirit of man which is in them absolutely we and we know what we're thinking you know we can we can uh uh converse with one another and and I can tell you what brother Austin's thinking I can tell you what brother sister so and so is thinking because we what those things of man he says save the spirit of man he says even so the things God know things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God but don't you want to know what God's thinking don't you want to know his plan for you tomorrow for this next year he says now he says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God which things we also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual so at that that house Bible study I taught on last Friday we're talking about uh staying with the word I had I had to something something simple the absolute what's absolute the Bible the Bible and I started just working with do not add or take away because when someone adds to it they're using their own wisdom their own reasoning but if they take away from it they're also using their own wisdom their own thinking see so when they get into that they you can suffer greatly for those things they said brother Simon where's that okay adding and taking away where's that in the word of God and as she said that the the Lord brought Joe joab to my mind joab was a king I was was the head captain of the army of under David but if you look in the scripture how many times did joab disobey the king's word the king said do not K kill Absalon do not slay him don't put your hands on him I want him back here as my son as Su that word went out of the king's mouth that was the word of the king who was a type of Christ that word went out and what joab do first chance Jo saw him hanging the tree with his hair he put him through with a spear he disobeyed the word of God joab always trying to manipulate David always trying to do this or trying to do this or to direct him here this that and what it do it cost him at the end joab was cursed at the end because he did not obey David which was a type of Christ who had the word of God amen see he says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen now let's stand here in closing saints of God artificial intelligence we are limited we wouldn't it be nice to have the mind of Christ all the time to know to hear the word of God to to hear to hear the voice of God constantly in our lives but we've got to set ourselves aside let me just say it like this we're promised the Rapture there is a body change coming there is going to be a people who escape death they will not see death they will not be Mars how many want that how many want that promise amen yeah we want that we're looking forward to because why it came to us did not the Bible say what Jesus say in John 10 he says the word of God always did not the word word of God come to Gods little G and if that was a promise a prophecy for us in this day that's the prophecy St St Paul said he said he said when he says uh he say uh corruption will put on incorruption and Mortal put on immortality that when that P that saying will become brought to pass that's we're waiting on on that prophecy is there anyone here that can change your body right now who has faith for right now because if you did I'm changed guess what I got a new body I can sing now whoop right hey I got a new body I'm s foot tall he I'm hoping I have hope now but if there's a revelation coming and it has to do with this Rapture what do we what are we going to do what do we have to do because we are artificial here we only know this realm now we have a greater understanding we need a greater Revelation but this last Revelation here this because remember that scripture has to be fulfilled and with the scripture comes a revelation of it you're going to know how to there's going to be something strike you that's going to change you but you've got to believe it now let me let me end here right here you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it we are leaning on the spirit of God not on a man's teaching not a man's preaching but it's going to take a revelation of the father of the Holy Ghost to bring this to us when you're out tomorrow when you're out tonight home wherever Lord just keep keep it in your mind Lord send me this Revelation keep keep thinking and meditating on this Rapture Lord I don't know how you're going to do it but I believe on that one I'm waiting show me the word give me this thing if it's Unwritten give it to me Unwritten so I can find it in the word if it's written I know it'll be right here and then raise Lord God raise my faith for this then I've mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost by the time this Rapture takes place this is going to be the this book in your eyes is going to be magnified it's going to you're going to you're going to cover this Bible like you've never covered it before the old Saints 5 six 7 800 even now that died for this word they they went to death with their Bible you're not taking this and they took they took their martyrdom with their word that word is precious that means this book cannot can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people everyone in the world that's Christians read this this morning and they're all striving for the same thing but Jesus said few there be that find it everyone's prophet sints of God from from the Lutheran to whoever believe in the Rapture in a form of it but the revelations only come into one one group that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people are you that special class absolutely he sent us a word he sent us a revelation but there's there's more coming it will take one with prophetic insight as we were sent a prophet you're going to have to get prophetic yourself you're going to have to be able to see in the spiritual you're going to have get it into the spiritual it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction who wants the ability to hear God like that who wants Supernatural in instruction I do amen not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery didn't that Paul or Peter say he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all die but we shall be changed he says but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know amen now you've got your marching orders what are you going to do tonight we're going to go down and seek the Lord when you get home pray read the Bible read the Bible pray and ask God to open this up brother side what if it remember it's going to but that Revelation is going to become at the right time as well but just keep what preparing yourself for it be welcome remember keep this heart clean because remember Revelation the reason you going miss a revelation because your heart is hard your heart's not right so keep your heart right and this revelation will strike at the right time all Hearts Minds clear if you need prayer saints of God this morning we will pray for you by God's grace I believe God is still a God that heals I believe he's still one that delivers and SS of God I believe these prayers are adding up and they filled up what into the vessel of God they're going to be poured out one day and they're all going to be answered there's there's there's something that being answered right now there were some the answer P the past but these ones we need right here at the end these last Souls the our loved ones we need we desire they're going to come in so let's continue to pray amen let's sing a song Here by God's grace don't you love the Lord Jesus Christ his word is right man he sent us so much you know what I was listening to on the way here was I was already planning on ministering on on artificial intelligence or you know human wisdom or however you want to say it I started listening to uh wisdom versus Faith 1962 and during that I don't know if that was one of the first or last or however but he in that beginning of the sermon he talks about how God gave him the vision about storing up vegetables and fruits that Storehouse he said he say he said there's coming a time where you're going to need this and it was right in that sermon Faith or wisdom versus Faith you're going to need Faith these Revelations here have to become so real to us that when we come up these circumstances when these tough times come we're going to have faith for it it's not going to look impossible when those children of Israel got there when Moses was leading them they come up to that the the Red Sea it looked impossible but saints of God it's not going to look and pour out possible to us all we're going to say is Lord I don't know how you're going to do it but I know you're going to do it why because he said he would do you believe you know who you are do you know who you are yeah you're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen let's let's sing a song let's say let's say a word of prayer real quick that's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we love you Lord God give us strength Lord Lord we've heard many many sermons Lord we've had many many teachings heard vast preaching God heard many vast subjects Lord deep and shallow diverse Ministries Lord God we've listened to and yet Lord God we want to come to the source this this morning lord lord for you are the source of all wisdom we don't want to lean on our natural wisdom Lord there might be some here Lord say well Lord I'm good at this and I'm gifted here but what does the Lord want you to do for your life well I could do this I could do that but Lord what do you want me to do Lord tomorrow I want to do this but Lord what do you want me to do tomorrow lord well Lord Jesus I got work maybe he wants me to stay home and study and pray Lord we love you and Lord God help us Lord to be yielded to your spirit God to hear and to know Lord may we seek you lord your word says Lord that if we uh uh draw near to you that you would draw near to us Lord and Lord we know we saw how you did those two boys Lord those two gentlemen Lord walking on the way to Aus you showed up Lord but Lord the you you made it look like twice Lord like you were going to go on but Lord you are just playing a part you wanted to be there amongst us the entire time and Lord Jesus Lord we believe you're here even this morning God and Lord God we ask you make yourself manifest Lord God lord if anyone needs a touch God we ask God that you would touch them God lord refill them with thy Spirit God Lord give us Lord Faith raise us our faith God so we can believe all things Lord be with our brothers and sisters overseas God who never even receiv received this word
