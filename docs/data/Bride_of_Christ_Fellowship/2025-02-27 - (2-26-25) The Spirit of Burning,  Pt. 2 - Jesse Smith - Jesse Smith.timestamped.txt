[33:19] Saints
[33:20] said amen thank you musicians by God's
[33:23] grace appreciate that let's go to
[33:24] Jeremiah chapter 20 I'd like to preach a
[33:27] part two here on the spirit of
[33:29] burning so we look at that here tonight
[33:31] the spirit of
[33:40] burning a little later I'll have just a
[33:42] few pictures of Casa but not right now I
[33:44] just got regular notes Here Today by
[33:47] God's
[33:48] grace the spirit of burning part two
[33:50] we'll look at the life of Jeremiah a
[33:52] little bit here tonight by God's grace
[33:55] so Sunday we looked at the life of
[33:56] Isaiah another uh we'd say you know some
[33:59] people call them minor but they to me
[34:01] they they're like Major Prophets we know
[34:03] all their messages are major messages
[34:05] right uh but let's look at the life of
[34:07] Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 20:9 we'll
[34:09] just read that together and we'll have
[34:11] you be seated by God's
[34:14] grace you know I could not find where
[34:16] brother R quoted this one time so maybe
[34:19] I wasn't looking at the right words but
[34:20] I can't find not one time when brother
[34:22] Ram quoted this verse yet I've heard
[34:24] this verse quoted many times by many
[34:26] people
[34:32] um so I think this scripture is often
[34:35] misunderstood I've I've said it numerous
[34:37] times over the years but we want to take
[34:38] another look at it here tonight because
[34:40] it ties in with this uh series here like
[34:42] I said this might be a three-part series
[34:44] maybe four-part series but um we'll see
[34:47] what the Lord has here by God's
[34:50] grace Jeremiah chapter
[34:54] 20:9 all right let's read that if we can
[34:56] on three ready one two three then I said
[35:00] I will not make mention of him nor speak
[35:04] anymore in his name but his word was in
[35:08] my heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[35:13] bones and I was weary with forbearing
[35:17] and I could not stay may God add his
[35:19] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[35:21] can be seated here
[35:25] tonight so I'm going try to set a timer
[35:28] here by God's grace we'll try to do an
[35:30] hour I preached way too hard on Sunday I
[35:33] was really I don't know why I was just
[35:34] so fired up but I preach way too hard so
[35:36] I'm going to try not to preach so hard
[35:37] here tonight by God's grace I don't have
[35:39] a lot of voice
[35:41] left so we'll try to be under control so
[35:44] part one here we looked at um uh the
[35:47] spirit of burning in the life of Isaiah
[35:49] and uh we learned one thing we saw that
[35:51] the spirit of burning comes after the
[35:54] spirit of judgment so the Judgment of
[35:57] God God comes upon a Believer first so
[36:00] we can expect that God is going to give
[36:02] us the the real state of our life and
[36:04] aren't you glad for that we know all
[36:06] kinds of people they create a different
[36:08] well I'm doing okay you know you shake
[36:09] their hand how you doing oh I'm doing
[36:11] good are you really doing good God knows
[36:14] how you're doing Hallelujah we can
[36:16] present something good you know like we
[36:17] joked about it before how you doing well
[36:19] I'm pressing the battles well what does
[36:20] that mean that really doesn't tell us
[36:22] how you're doing by God's grace one time
[36:25] uh a man walked up to me he's a
[36:27] denominated man good man uh but he
[36:31] looked at me and he just shook my hand a
[36:32] little it was Jean he shook my hand real
[36:34] interesting he looked he kind of pulled
[36:36] me close to himself he said he said how
[36:38] are you living Jesse and I was just like
[36:40] I'm doing great my God's grace you know
[36:42] I'm doing good but he had heard that
[36:44] somewhere from somebody and and I
[36:46] thought wow that was a really nice uh
[36:48] from him you if you knew him you'd know
[36:50] why he's a real in-depth kind of person
[36:53] and he didn't want to know how I was
[36:54] doing he would know how I was living and
[36:56] that's what the Holy Spirit will make
[36:58] known to you how we're living our daily
[37:00] lives in other words is God continually
[37:03] consuming our lives or are we getting
[37:05] our life consumed by something else
[37:07] right as we saw on Sunday we close with
[37:08] it God is a consuming fire that mean God
[37:11] wants to eat up all your life he wants
[37:13] to eat up all your thoughts Hallelujah
[37:15] he wants all your praise how many want
[37:17] to praise him tonight Hallelujah you
[37:18] sounded really good on the songs
[37:19] praising him right Eden's got her hand
[37:21] up amen hallelujah God will help you
[37:24] Hallelujah God wants to eat up all your
[37:26] thoughts your praise and your worship
[37:27] your conversations so important because
[37:31] as soon as you say you're a Christian
[37:33] the devil's going to start attacking you
[37:35] as soon as you say you got the Holy
[37:36] Ghost you get all the guns pointed at
[37:39] you right so you're going to have to go
[37:41] through many battles you have to go
[37:43] through many trials but that's how God
[37:46] likes it God likes Faith that's real
[37:48] that's been tested by real trials
[37:50] Hallelujah that's why sometimes you know
[37:52] we think well God why would you allow
[37:54] this to happen of course he'd allow he
[37:55] loves to test his Believers right he
[37:58] loved to test job because God knew Job
[38:00] would never curse him right job wasn't
[38:04] just serving God for all the blessing
[38:05] That's what Satan was trying to say well
[38:07] he's just serving you because of the
[38:08] good times and although it was hard for
[38:10] job job still overcame and he never
[38:13] charg God foolishly throughout his
[38:15] difficult trials Hallelujah and God was
[38:17] able to tell devil look he serves me
[38:19] because he loves me not just because of
[38:22] all the blessings that I give him so
[38:24] that's what we want to be today we want
[38:25] to be we want to have a a real love for
[38:27] Christ we want to serve Christ for all
[38:29] the right reasons Hallelujah whether He
[38:32] blesses us anymore or not we want to
[38:34] serve him because we love him and you
[38:37] know I you know I just want to say this
[38:38] plainly I'm not sure if these two steps
[38:40] are justification and sanctification but
[38:42] it seemed to me like it was uh because
[38:45] uh you know before Isaiah could be sent
[38:48] out he had to get all his iniquity
[38:50] burned away and he had to be a vessel
[38:52] that was cleaned out right that's what
[38:54] sanctification is cleaning out the
[38:55] vessel for service and since there was
[38:58] no third work of Grace in the Old
[38:59] Testament because Jesus had not uh died
[39:02] and uh been resurrected and glorified it
[39:04] seems like that could all you could have
[39:06] that could you you could just have two
[39:07] works of Grace so while I was preaching
[39:09] that that came across I actually didn't
[39:10] even plan to preach it on Sunday it was
[39:12] just kind of Revelation and church
[39:14] that's what you'll find you know I I've
[39:16] I've had this idea for many years I like
[39:17] to make just a video series on learning
[39:19] the message now every critic of mine
[39:21] will criticize me and say oh look he's
[39:23] learning he's intellectual but they just
[39:26] shows their ignorance they don't know
[39:27] the Bible Jesus said learn of me in
[39:29] Matthew chap
[39:30] 11 that just shows their ignorance and
[39:33] brother answer they just want something
[39:34] to pick on but what I mean by all this
[39:36] is have have lessons where you you learn
[39:39] the message by the thus sayith the Lord
[39:41] truths of the Bible like if you know the
[39:43] if you know uh water baptism and the
[39:45] godhead and then the three works of
[39:47] Grace and and you if you have the
[39:49] baptism of Holy Ghost really down good
[39:50] on the three works of Grace then
[39:52] everything's going to fall right into
[39:54] place you're never going to come up with
[39:56] some fantastic different doctr or
[39:58] something like that everything will fall
[39:59] right into
[40:00] place uh brother ram calls it uh the
[40:03] Keystone of the Bible he said what's the
[40:04] Keystone Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the
[40:07] same yesterday today and
[40:09] forever so if you can get those
[40:11] foundational things and that's what I've
[40:13] seen in my life you know when I came in
[40:14] the message it wasn't brother BR brother
[40:16] BR brother BR it was the Bible the Bible
[40:17] the Bible and don't get me wrong brother
[40:19] br's good brother br's good that's good
[40:20] that's good but he he's not the absolute
[40:22] Jesus is the absolute and if you can get
[40:25] a good Bible Foundation of Revelation
[40:28] then the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[40:30] against you Hallelujah they can't and
[40:33] everything will fit together by the
[40:34] Bible well you have yes we have some
[40:37] questions but the majority of things
[40:39] will lay just right perfectly right in
[40:41] line with every other verse that's what
[40:42] I've seen in my life you know somebody
[40:45] uh message denier today a message
[40:47] accuser accused me online he's well you
[40:49] act like you know it all uh like you got
[40:51] all the answers I said I don't I never
[40:53] said I did but the God I seres got all
[40:55] the answers
[40:57] and oh yeah he said well you just say
[40:59] act like you got the final say on
[41:01] everything it's not me that's got the
[41:03] final say it's God's word that got a
[41:05] final say hallelujah and they can never
[41:07] defeat the revelations that Jesus Christ
[41:09] has revealed to us hallelujah so I'm not
[41:11] going to give into those evil spirits
[41:13] whether they're online or trying to
[41:14] sneak into our church you never give in
[41:16] the devil you overcome the devil
[41:18] Hallelujah you don't baby the devil you
[41:21] rebuke the devil Hallelujah that's
[41:24] right now we saw now for tonight just
[41:26] catch this I'm and I saw and as I as
[41:28] after I preached I saw the the uh the
[41:31] progress of the holy spirit it's
[41:32] beautiful I just I was so blessed Isaiah
[41:35] had the burning to put him into
[41:38] service tonight you're seeing the
[41:41] burning to keep you in service to keep
[41:44] you from quitting that's what we're
[41:46] looking at tonight don't raise your
[41:48] hands but whoever was tempted to quit
[41:49] serving God don't raise your hands
[41:52] unless you want to nobody's going to see
[41:53] it anyway well I mean they might see the
[41:55] front people
[41:57] but see we see we have the burning of
[41:59] the Holy Ghost to put you in service to
[42:02] get started and that's what everybody
[42:03] needs here as I said on Sunday I went
[42:04] through all those examples of you know
[42:06] in action right just do something for
[42:08] God just do something what you need is
[42:09] the burning of the fire of God in your
[42:11] soul that'll get you doing something for
[42:13] God but then you're going to be tested
[42:15] and you're going to need another
[42:16] anointing another experience with the
[42:18] Holy Ghost to keep you serving
[42:21] God so you don't quit you don't give up
[42:23] you don't bring reproach upon the name
[42:25] of Jesus Christ and then we're going to
[42:27] another good one next week well maybe
[42:29] won't be Sunday maybe Sunday night we'll
[42:30] see who knows how it's all going to go
[42:33] we'll just trust the Lord but I got some
[42:34] more burning verses
[42:36] here now let's look at Jeremiah Isaiah
[42:40] had the burning to put him into service
[42:42] Jeremiah needs the burning as we saw to
[42:45] keep him in
[42:47] service think about that God let him go
[42:49] through such trials that he's like I
[42:51] won't witness anymore I won't talk about
[42:53] God anymore because I've been through
[42:55] such difficult trials he almost
[42:57] convincing brother Chris to not talk
[42:59] about God
[43:00] anymore now what would it take in your
[43:02] life what would have to happen in your
[43:04] life where you'd be like I'm done
[43:06] talking about Jesus I'm done talking
[43:08] about brother brandom in the message the
[43:09] Bible Revelation what would it take for
[43:11] you Hallelujah so we want to be S we
[43:14] want to be sincere we want to be sober
[43:17] right and really consider wow what did
[43:19] God the god of love is he the god of
[43:22] love or not
[43:23] Church the God of all love and mercy and
[43:25] Grace yes the God of all love and mercy
[43:28] and Grace allowed his son Jeremiah to go
[43:31] through such trials he's like I'm I'm
[43:32] done talking about the message I'm
[43:36] done but did God allow it yes did he
[43:39] overcome it yes amen
[43:41] hallelujah is is God ever going to give
[43:43] you a trial that's too hard for you no
[43:45] he'll never do that but will it test you
[43:47] to the very core of your being
[43:49] absolutely praise God Amen and you might
[43:53] even be considering giving up quitting
[43:56] brother R went through it too we've been
[43:57] through it numerous times especially
[43:58] with the loss of his uh first wife and
[44:00] and uh Sharon Sharon Rose brother almost
[44:03] gave up he almost gave up but he said
[44:06] something held me amen he said the
[44:08] anchor held me he said what if it wasn't
[44:11] there in other words Church you ought to
[44:13] be happy if you've got an anchor to hold
[44:15] you in your hardest Trials of life thank
[44:18] God it's there
[44:19] Hallelujah no glory to God Amen thank
[44:22] God you have something holding you when
[44:25] you feel like you can't hold on
[44:27] that's how it is church let's be honest
[44:29] there's times how many honest where you
[44:31] feel like I'm holding on my I'm able to
[44:34] hold on to God's word that's true
[44:35] sometimes I feel like that too other
[44:37] times I get tested I feel like God you
[44:39] better hold on to me because I feel like
[44:40] I'm falling and the church said good
[44:43] we're all human here tonight like
[44:44] brother Donnie says nobody hung up their
[44:46] angel wings when they walked in back
[44:47] there in the in the other room because
[44:50] we all we all fall short of God's glory
[44:52] and we all get tested and tried but God
[44:54] is gracious God is with us God will hold
[44:56] us when we can't hold ourselves when it
[44:58] feels like that I'm talking about human
[45:00] emotion right and our human
[45:04] Spirits now in Jeremiah's Life Church
[45:06] you see so much persecution if you
[45:08] haven't read through it uh you need
[45:10] to I've read through it uh this year
[45:13] well I'm sorry it was the end of last
[45:14] year now I'm in Isaiah I'm in I just
[45:16] went through Isaiah 29 this morning by
[45:18] God's grace that's where he was
[45:19] mentioning about uh uh the heart they
[45:22] removed their heart far from me but now
[45:24] as we look at Jeremiah's life here just
[45:26] for a few moments
[45:28] this makes it plain to me after I read
[45:30] about Jeremiah's life and I've read the
[45:32] book this makes it plain that we are
[45:33] living in Le oysa because we have to
[45:37] battle
[45:39] riches we have to battle uh uh an Easy
[45:42] Living that's what we have to battle not
[45:45] physical persecution at least not yet
[45:48] now I don't know if you saw it but did
[45:49] you see uh it was in Congo 70 Christians
[45:52] were beheaded recently in Congo
[45:57] 70 and they didn't put on the news or
[45:59] nothing it just went across the
[46:00] Christian uh these uh militants or
[46:03] whatever they were I think I forget
[46:04] which religion they were but they come
[46:06] and right during the church service now
[46:08] Church which one of us now if that ever
[46:09] happened which one of us would stand on
[46:11] God's word God forbid but think about
[46:13] the faith they had to have to stand
[46:16] 70 70 and they stood on God's word none
[46:19] of them said you know I'd rather live
[46:20] I'd rather live I don't believe this and
[46:22] they all stood on God's word talk about
[46:25] I'm not giving up and I'm not turning
[46:27] around for what you know for what what
[46:31] would be worth it to to blashe the Holy
[46:34] Name of Jesus it wasn't worth it h thank
[46:36] God Amen and no doubt Church they're
[46:38] wearing a martyr's crown today
[46:40] Hallelujah no doubt they have a martyr's
[46:42] crown on right now
[46:46] Hallelujah so if you as you look at the
[46:49] life of Jeremiah church it's plain we're
[46:51] in Lea where we're rich and increased
[46:53] with Goods but we like I said remember
[46:55] he's talking to both Vines here we have
[46:57] need more of God we have that need
[46:59] hallelujah how many know you have that
[47:01] need today
[47:02] Hallelujah once you start feeling like
[47:04] you don't need God anymore you're on the
[47:06] way down you got to get back on the
[47:07] right path Hallelujah like I need more
[47:10] of
[47:11] God what did Brother R say those three
[47:13] things were uh soft living riches and
[47:15] the cares of life or something those
[47:16] three I can never remember that third
[47:18] one soft riches I'm sorry soft living
[47:20] riches and I think it was the cares of
[47:23] life that's what we battle we don't go
[47:25] through what Jeremiah went through
[47:26] through that we hardly need delivered
[47:29] from any
[47:30] persecution and and I'll just be honest
[47:33] is for for all of us most of us our
[47:35] persecution either comes from the family
[47:37] or in the church I've been persecuted
[47:39] more in the church than ever really in
[47:41] my family but that's normal that's what
[47:43] Paul went through and all the saints you
[47:45] know they uh because that's who I spend
[47:47] my time most time most of my time with
[47:49] is the Saints hallelujah or the
[47:51] church but see like we hardly need
[47:53] delivered from any physical persecution
[47:57] and so we got to look at spiritually uh
[47:59] what's trying to discourage our our our
[48:02] our state spiritually and help us to
[48:04] realize it's a real
[48:06] fight it's a real battle although it's
[48:09] not physical we got to we got to be more
[48:11] serious with the spiritual battles that
[48:12] we go through
[48:15] Hallelujah now I'm just going to do a
[48:17] brief summary of of the sufferings of
[48:19] Jeremiah you know he's called the
[48:21] weeping
[48:23] prophet because of all the immense
[48:25] suffering and persecution throughout his
[48:27] ministry and church his whole Ministry
[48:29] was basically to warn the people he did
[48:31] have a few chapters of Hope for the
[48:32] future but most of them didn't come to
[48:34] pass in his
[48:35] lifetime he had to basically preach and
[48:38] prophesy to a bunch of rebellious
[48:41] people okay so first the first two uh uh
[48:45] trials he went through was rejection he
[48:46] was rejected and then loneliness God
[48:49] told him not to marry in Jeremiah 16 God
[48:51] said you're not taking a wife you're not
[48:53] having children so God forbid him to
[48:55] have children and a wife life because it
[48:58] wouldn't fit his lifestyle and his
[48:59] ministry what God called him for now how
[49:00] many people would would accept that men
[49:03] I'm talking men how many men would
[49:05] accept that and be like Oh Praise the
[49:07] Lord but God commanded him you're not to
[49:09] do that so uh and it was also to
[49:12] symbolize the coming disaster on
[49:15] Judah he was in uh deep loneliness and
[49:18] isolation according to Jeremiah 15:17
[49:20] you want to pull that up there H
[49:21] Jeremiah
[49:23] 15:17 he was constantly mocked and
[49:25] ridiculed for for his
[49:27] prophecies I sat not in the Assembly of
[49:29] the mockers nor rejoiced I sat alone
[49:32] because of thy hand for thou H has
[49:33] filled me with
[49:35] indignation so he sat alone yeah I
[49:38] preached on this years ago you ever want
[49:39] to talk about somebody lonely you ever
[49:41] been lonely in your life go read
[49:43] Jeremiah it wasn't just one time it was
[49:45] all throughout his life battle
[49:48] loneliness his whole life now which one
[49:50] of us have God said okay who'd like to
[49:51] go through trials in life who wants the
[49:53] loneliness trial how many of us would
[49:54] said yes I'll take that
[49:58] or uh here's the card who wants to be
[50:00] poor oh yeah yeah I I want to I want to
[50:02] be poor and be malnourished and have all
[50:04] kinds of diseases because I don't eat
[50:05] enough food which one of us well the
[50:07] nice thing is God doesn't ask us what we
[50:08] want to do God assigns us a certain
[50:11] trial and look what Jeremiah
[50:14] got he went through some of the hardest
[50:16] things a person a prophet could
[50:18] absolutely go through but what is he now
[50:20] he's immortalized in Eternity for his
[50:23] faithful service to Jesus Christ now
[50:25] church I'll tell you now if you ever
[50:26] cried again it won't be tears of sadness
[50:28] amen it'll be tears of joy
[50:31] Hallelujah for the victory over Satan
[50:34] and the Antichrist Spirit right there in
[50:36] right there in Israel he have to go very
[50:39] far to find evil spirits they're all
[50:41] around
[50:42] him constant opposition constantly
[50:45] mocked and ridiculed for his prophecies
[50:48] he was also accused of being a false
[50:50] prophet like they say they say they tell
[50:51] me oh you're a false Pastor or you're a
[50:53] false whatever false teacher all these
[50:55] things like that you always look at
[50:57] always look at who's accusing you and
[50:58] look at their
[51:00] life because you and I know the lives we
[51:03] live Hallelujah because God gives us the
[51:06] spirit of
[51:08] judgment he was beaten and
[51:11] imprisoned he was thrown in a sistern to
[51:14] die a pit a muddy pit to die he just
[51:18] sank down and was starving to death in
[51:22] Jeremiah 38 just left there and and God
[51:25] put it on someone's heart uh what was
[51:28] his name here it's it's Eed melik an
[51:30] Ethiopian official he says he goes to
[51:33] the king and begs him and so they tile
[51:35] these uh these uh pieces of cloth
[51:38] together like uh just a wrap around him
[51:40] and they pull him up and he's almost
[51:42] dead laying in in a a pit of mud for
[51:44] days and weeks on end almost
[51:47] died that's that that's the glamour of
[51:50] being a prophet there's no glamour in
[51:52] being a prophet of
[51:54] God this is what he went through
[51:58] he was thrown into the sister then he
[52:00] was accused of treason he was falsely
[52:02] accused of defecting to the Babylonians
[52:04] when he tried to leave Jerusalem so he's
[52:06] just trying to get out and they falsely
[52:08] accuse him of joining the bad
[52:10] guys the officials demanded his
[52:12] execution people were calling for his
[52:14] life in Jeremiah 38 but King zedekiah
[52:18] hesitated and spared
[52:21] him then he was forced to go to Egypt
[52:23] Church uh taken against his will in in
[52:26] Jeremiah 43 to Egypt he continued
[52:29] prophesying there and the Bible doesn't
[52:31] say it but history says because he was
[52:33] preaching against their Idols in Egypt
[52:35] which is the land of idolatry right
[52:37] represents our sinful life
[52:41] Egypt history says he was stoned to
[52:44] death by his own people not the
[52:46] Egyptians his own church family we'd say
[52:50] church church message family because
[52:52] they were false Believers right they're
[52:54] make Believers so this is the story of
[52:57] this we'd say mighty man of
[53:00] God church we don't go through nothing
[53:02] compared to
[53:06] Jeremiah we always want to remember that
[53:08] and even you know hose and I when he was
[53:10] talking me on Sunday he was telling me
[53:11] the different things he suffered through
[53:13] he said but brother Jesse he said the
[53:14] Holy Spirit reminded me I haven't been
[53:15] through nothing as hard as these other
[53:17] brothers in the
[53:18] Bible what they've been through it's
[53:21] been nothing compared to what they went
[53:23] through how many appreciate the Holy
[53:25] Ghost in someone's life life let's go to
[53:27] Jeremiah 20 we'll look at now we'll look
[53:29] at this one this
[53:32] individual so boy he needed fire church
[53:34] he needed a burning but he needed a
[53:36] burning to keep from quitting because it
[53:39] got so
[53:40] hard now as I said on Sunday church I'll
[53:42] say like this you and I need a burning
[53:44] whenever we sin we need a burning in our
[53:46] life the Holy Ghost to burn out that
[53:47] desire out of our
[53:49] Lives that's all we need we need uh the
[53:52] spirit of judgment to come on I'm wrong
[53:54] I'm a dirty person or my flesh is dirty
[53:56] my my mind gets dirty my words get dirty
[53:58] and I confess it I'm the guilty one and
[54:01] then God will send the burning to burn
[54:03] that out of our lives and we don't want
[54:04] to do that again
[54:07] Hallelujah so what what I'm saying is
[54:09] yes you need one at the beginning of
[54:10] your ministry yes you got to have that
[54:11] but there's going to come times too like
[54:13] Peter right Peter segregated you know
[54:14] Peter had mistakes even after the Holy
[54:16] Ghost where we need the spirit of
[54:17] burning to clean out our lives aresh
[54:20] Hallelujah everybody
[54:24] understand like the Bible says you got
[54:26] to get your first love back so how do
[54:29] you get your first love back do the
[54:30] first works that you did at the
[54:31] beginning Hallelujah now Jeremiah
[54:34] chapter 20 let's start there verse
[54:43] one all right yep I I turned and then I
[54:46] lost my spot okay seemed like at least
[54:49] once a service I lose my spot so I'm
[54:51] sorry Jeremiah 20 now pure the son of
[54:54] emmer the priest who was the chief
[54:56] governor of the house of the Lord heard
[54:58] that Jeremiah prophesied these
[55:00] things verse two then pure smoked
[55:03] Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the
[55:05] stocks that were in the High Gate of
[55:06] Benjamin which was by the house of the
[55:09] Lord now okaya I'm going to put a
[55:11] picture up here here's a artist
[55:12] rendition
[55:14] here uh whoops wrong
[55:17] side let's see if it'll come up here's
[55:19] an artist rendition of being in the
[55:25] stocks it come up hope it come up yeah
[55:27] there this just an artist rendition now
[55:30] there's different ones some had them
[55:31] standing up but I would look at I I took
[55:33] the one that looked like it was most
[55:34] painful because that's probably what
[55:35] they did right they didn't put him
[55:37] through something
[55:39] easy so they're going to put this bar on
[55:41] top so this artist according to what
[55:44] they think is history this is how they
[55:46] put him in the stocks so this is what
[55:48] Jeremiah gets for telling people to stop
[55:51] sinning to put their Idols away to trust
[55:54] in God to believe thus say the Lord to
[55:57] live a holy life this is what he gets
[55:58] this is the payment he
[56:01] gets it's not a very glamorous
[56:04] life they put him in
[56:07] stocks and this was by the what of the
[56:10] Lord the house of the Lord Jeremiah is
[56:13] trying to defend the honor of the house
[56:15] and yet they they ridicule him publicly
[56:18] they persecute him publicly right by the
[56:20] house he's trying to help Hallelujah
[56:23] church sometimes you try to help people
[56:24] and it's among those people you're
[56:26] trying help that's when you get treated
[56:27] the worst amongst the people you're
[56:29] trying to help
[56:31] Hallelujah but don't fret that's not
[56:33] just you that's every
[56:35] believer that was Jesus he was sent to
[56:38] his own and his own received him no did
[56:40] I quote that right no his own received
[56:42] him
[56:51] not now in verse uh let's go down to
[56:54] verse seven Jeremiah 20:7 now this is
[56:57] why I read this a few weeks ago and i'
[56:58] forgot in the context oh Lord thou Hast
[57:00] deceived me and I was deceived so again
[57:03] was that true did God deceive Jeremiah
[57:05] no now God doesn't tell us all the
[57:07] future so that's why Jeremiah probably
[57:09] thought that but God don't God only
[57:11] tells you what he wants you to
[57:14] know he and because he knows he's got to
[57:16] test you he knows the best way to test
[57:18] faith is with
[57:19] trials Hallelujah the best way to
[57:22] improve patience is to go through hard
[57:24] times
[57:28] oh Lord thou has deceived me and I was
[57:30] deceived Thou Art stronger than I and
[57:31] Hast prevailed I am in derision daily
[57:34] everyone mocks me so not not just the
[57:36] physical pain but everybody coming by
[57:38] maybe hitting him spitting on him
[57:40] mocking him oh look there's the prophet
[57:41] of God supposed Prophet there's a false
[57:44] prophet of God that's what his life was
[57:46] subject
[57:48] unto Jeremiah wasn't living a picnic he
[57:51] was on the
[57:52] battlefield now it's under this
[57:54] everyone's everyone's mocking him
[57:56] so it sounds like he still don't have
[57:57] any friends he's still all
[58:01] alone now when we go through loneliness
[58:03] we we're probably lonely but how many
[58:04] people are actually mocking us to our
[58:06] faces right probably zero so Not only
[58:10] was he alone no wife no children Nobody
[58:14] But even his church members they're all
[58:15] mocking
[58:16] him on top of everything else and sure
[58:20] sometimes we feel like we job or we
[58:21] we're
[58:23] Jeremiah I'm sorry if you think that
[58:24] you're deceived
[58:26] you have been deceived to somehow exalt
[58:28] yourself or make yourself think like
[58:30] you're greater than what you
[58:32] are yes we go through spiritual battles
[58:35] but nothing like this this is a
[58:37] spiritual battle as well as a physical
[58:41] battle and church think I just thought
[58:43] this this man's not even in the Hall of
[58:45] Fame of Faith right they didn't did they
[58:47] name Jeremiah in the hall I not that I
[58:49] can remember now would he be undoubtedly
[58:52] but did they name him no he wasn't named
[58:57] but surely his name's on the Lamb's Book
[58:58] of Life
[59:01] surely verse eight for since I spake I
[59:04] cried out and I cried violence and spoil
[59:07] because the word of the Lord was made a
[59:09] a reproach unto me and a derision daily
[59:12] so he's crying out to God and he became
[59:14] a reproach from all the word that he
[59:17] spoke now we get to the context here's
[59:19] our here's our verse now you understand
[59:21] the context now I'm going to skip ahead
[59:22] to the next slide they kind of shrank
[59:24] that down looks like they see they cut
[59:26] that out they cropped that out this is
[59:28] right outside the house of the Lord he
[59:31] got oh yeah so when they got beaten they
[59:32] said it was whips and stocks so he got
[59:35] whipped on the back right like the Lord
[59:38] Jesus maybe not the same thing of course
[59:40] that hadn't been invented yet as far as
[59:41] I
[59:43] understand but uh pasur struck Jeremiah
[59:46] the prophet so struck is another word
[59:48] for whipping him so it says Jeremiah was
[59:51] called to prophesy at the atrium of the
[59:52] temple it was a harsh message God would
[59:54] bring a catastrophe on on this place
[59:56] according to Jeremiah 19:3 he would let
[59:58] his people fall By The Sword and their
[1:00:00] corpses would be eaten by birds and
[1:00:01] beasts not a very flowery sermon to
[1:00:06] preach he would turn the Jews into
[1:00:08] cannibals God told them that most
[1:00:11] messages the prophets pass in the Bible
[1:00:13] were not happily received in this case
[1:00:14] the prophet I'm sorry the priest pure
[1:00:16] attacked the messenger he flogged him
[1:00:18] and locked him up in stocks the next day
[1:00:20] pure received a personal message he and
[1:00:21] his friends would be ex exiled and would
[1:00:24] die in Babylon since they rejected God
[1:00:26] message that's the message he's got to
[1:00:27] oh that's right yeah he gave that
[1:00:29] prophecy in verse six we didn't read
[1:00:30] verse six but after he was beaten
[1:00:32] Jeremiah then had to say well also this
[1:00:35] is going to happen God's rejected
[1:00:38] you still no good news right but a
[1:00:41] prophet will give you good news if you
[1:00:43] live
[1:00:45] good verse n then said I I will make not
[1:00:49] I will not make mention of him nor speak
[1:00:51] anymore in his name but his word was in
[1:00:54] my heart as a what a burning fire shut
[1:00:58] up in my
[1:01:00] bones and I was weary with forbearing
[1:01:03] and I could not stay Church he's in the
[1:01:06] deepest pain physically he could ever be
[1:01:08] in probably the most emotional pain he's
[1:01:11] ever been through and he's on the verge
[1:01:13] of saying it's I'm done I'm done with
[1:01:15] this I I got to get healed up when am I
[1:01:17] ever going to get healed when am I GNA
[1:01:19] ever get any peace in my life and so
[1:01:21] what does God do does god rescue him out
[1:01:23] of there no God sends a fire inside of
[1:01:26] him a burning inside of him to let him
[1:01:28] know that God could touch his body at
[1:01:30] any moment God could heal his body at
[1:01:32] any moment but there a supernatural sign
[1:01:34] a supernatural touch I'm with you and
[1:01:37] you need to keep speaking the word of
[1:01:38] God hallelujah amen I'm not going to let
[1:01:42] you quit
[1:01:44] hallelujah
[1:01:48] hallelujah now I hear people I hear
[1:01:51] Christians and people sing about oh it's
[1:01:53] so happy that's like fire in my bones
[1:01:55] and they're living such a happy life you
[1:01:56] don't even know the verse of what it's
[1:01:58] talking about it's a man in stocks
[1:02:01] whipped who wants to quit and stop
[1:02:03] talking about God forever and then God
[1:02:06] sends fire then God sends the burning to
[1:02:09] make sure he doesn't quit hallelujah
[1:02:12] praise God that's the context of a fire
[1:02:16] shut up in my bones most people have no
[1:02:18] idea what they're talking
[1:02:20] about now just as a side note brother
[1:02:23] Mike McClosky the one in the wheelchair
[1:02:25] uh you know many times he's prayed to
[1:02:27] God for healing and one reason he
[1:02:28] believes he's still going to be healed
[1:02:29] which would be a tremendous one of the
[1:02:30] greatest Miracles ever if God does that
[1:02:33] if God does it on this side but the
[1:02:35] reason he has hope is because one time
[1:02:36] he was telling me he was driving home
[1:02:38] and the pain was so bad he just kept
[1:02:39] crying out to Jesus Jesus and he said as
[1:02:41] he was driving home he actually started
[1:02:42] getting the feeling back in his uh his
[1:02:45] his legs which they're they're paralyzed
[1:02:46] they have no feeling but all it and he
[1:02:49] he has never had a day without pain
[1:02:51] since that awful attack on him I'll call
[1:02:53] it an attack
[1:02:56] he's but in that moment in that short
[1:02:58] moment of driving in the van while he's
[1:02:59] crying to Jesus God let him be painfree
[1:03:01] and let him feel uh parts of his legs
[1:03:04] and if I'm not mistaken even down to his
[1:03:06] feet again and this is what this is the
[1:03:08] closest thing it can remind me of a man
[1:03:09] who suffers all day 247 with nerve pain
[1:03:13] and all the suffering and yet God to
[1:03:15] encourage him so he don't quit and give
[1:03:16] up gives him one experience and said I'm
[1:03:19] with you I'm here I can heal you but I'm
[1:03:22] allowing this for a certain purpose and
[1:03:24] don't stop don't give up
[1:03:26] stay with God's word there's a purpose
[1:03:28] for all things
[1:03:29] hallelujah
[1:03:32] amen it's the closest thing I could know
[1:03:35] to someone going through something like
[1:03:36] that and yet he still to this day he
[1:03:38] still praises the Lord and testifies in
[1:03:41] constant pain if you ever been around
[1:03:44] him you see he can't he can't quite sit
[1:03:46] still in his wheelchair he's got to
[1:03:48] adjust and move because there's so much
[1:03:49] pain like many times he'll just go like
[1:03:51] this go we'll just be talking about God
[1:03:54] He he'll just go
[1:03:56] just to deal with the pain I'm like Lord
[1:03:58] have mercy and I've my wife seen it I've
[1:04:00] said I've sat on my knees and cried
[1:04:02] begging God to heal the man and he's
[1:04:03] still not healed I've cried I prayed but
[1:04:07] what did Jesus do he sent a fire in his
[1:04:09] body to show him that I am the god of
[1:04:12] Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm the god that
[1:04:14] formed your body all things are possible
[1:04:16] to them that
[1:04:18] believe but for whatever reason God's
[1:04:20] withholding
[1:04:22] it God church has a a a as a special
[1:04:26] testimony for each one of
[1:04:29] us and in the moment we feel like
[1:04:32] quitting in the moment sometimes where
[1:04:34] it's the hardest that's when God will
[1:04:36] give us some special sign some special
[1:04:38] Supernatural thing to keep us from
[1:04:40] quitting to remind us that this is just
[1:04:43] a test this is just a trial troubles
[1:04:45] don't last always
[1:04:48] Hallelujah and this will all work
[1:04:50] together for good because you and I love
[1:04:52] the Lord
[1:04:57] now we went through this a few weeks ago
[1:04:59] but remember verse 11 but the Lord is
[1:05:00] with me as a mighty terrible one
[1:05:03] therefore my persecutor shall stumble so
[1:05:06] here he's all positive right before he's
[1:05:07] like I'm going to quit I'm going to quit
[1:05:09] God's to see me but now he's back on the
[1:05:11] positive side sound sound like anybody
[1:05:12] familiar you know that one day they
[1:05:15] testify good and the next day they're
[1:05:16] down the dumpster does it sound like
[1:05:17] anybody you know let me get a mirror
[1:05:20] I'll show you who it is I'll do me
[1:05:23] first and then I'll put the mirror in
[1:05:25] your face
[1:05:26] here's somebody that does that you me we
[1:05:29] all do
[1:05:30] that brother said you're up one day down
[1:05:33] the next and the church
[1:05:39] said now look at verse 14 now he's back
[1:05:41] to the downside cursed be the day
[1:05:43] wherein I was born let not the day
[1:05:45] wherein my mother bear me be
[1:05:48] blessed I've never felt that
[1:05:51] Saints I say that maybe to my shame or
[1:05:53] just whatever God has allowed me to go
[1:05:55] through I've never curse the day I was
[1:05:56] born and I'm thankful for all the
[1:05:57] children that have been born to me
[1:05:58] Hallelujah I rejoice in every day
[1:06:00] they're born and the future one to come
[1:06:02] by God's grace but this is the suffering
[1:06:04] God let his faithful Prophet go through
[1:06:07] to wish he'd never been
[1:06:10] born cursed be the man who brought the
[1:06:13] tidings to my father saying a
[1:06:15] Manchild is born unto thee making him
[1:06:18] very
[1:06:21] glad look at verse 17 because he slew me
[1:06:24] not from the womb or that my mother
[1:06:26] might have been my grave and her womb to
[1:06:28] be always great with me wherefore came I
[1:06:31] forth out of the womb to see labor and
[1:06:33] sorrow that my
[1:06:35] days should be consumed with
[1:06:42] shame now as incredibly difficult is for
[1:06:46] that to
[1:06:48] understand church God is the god of
[1:06:50] contrast we would never know The Joy of
[1:06:52] Spring unless went through these awful
[1:06:54] Winters
[1:06:57] which thank God almost out of almost out
[1:06:58] of this one here we would know never
[1:07:01] know the joy of sunlight without the the
[1:07:03] darkness the absence of light so it is
[1:07:06] with
[1:07:07] Jeremiah so it is with Jeremiah because
[1:07:10] Jeremiah Was whipped because he was put
[1:07:12] in stocks because he was almost drowned
[1:07:14] in mud because he cursed the day he was
[1:07:17] born because of that because of the deep
[1:07:20] dark trials God goes through then we're
[1:07:22] also allowed to see the joys of
[1:07:26] Victory and Jeremiah wrote about them in
[1:07:28] his next book Lamentations 3 verse
[1:07:33] 21 you pull that up there I'll pull that
[1:07:37] off a little later I'll pull back up
[1:07:39] there so because he suffered because he
[1:07:42] cursed the day he was born because he
[1:07:44] thought he felt maybe uh deceived by the
[1:07:46] Lord which would have been wrong but
[1:07:48] because he had gone through so
[1:07:51] much God allowed him to go through that
[1:07:53] so he could climb out of that
[1:07:56] and God could show him that God can
[1:07:58] change any situation that we're
[1:08:01] in I'm trying to preach to you tonight
[1:08:03] God can change your situation Hallelujah
[1:08:06] Glory I ain't telling you how I ain't
[1:08:08] instructing you how I'm just preaching
[1:08:10] declaring you God can change your
[1:08:12] situation
[1:08:13] Hallelujah nothing is too hard for the
[1:08:16] Lord
[1:08:17] amen many times God prove that nothing
[1:08:20] shall be too hard for
[1:08:22] God Lamentations 3:21 if we never had
[1:08:26] the cursed days where you want to quit
[1:08:27] and give up we never know the joy of the
[1:08:30] next few words listen to these
[1:08:32] words there this I recall to my mind
[1:08:35] therefore I have hope what do you recall
[1:08:37] to mind verse 22 it is of the Lord's
[1:08:40] mercies that we are not alive in other
[1:08:42] words I'm still here because God's
[1:08:45] merciful I should be dead you should be
[1:08:49] dead because his compassions fail me not
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:55] we would never know these words and the
[1:08:57] meaning of them because if they're
[1:08:59] written by the same man except a man
[1:09:01] went through the darkest of depths of
[1:09:04] Trials verse
[1:09:05] 23 they are new every morning great is
[1:09:10] thy
[1:09:11] faithfulness not a little bit not just a
[1:09:13] little bit Mercy faithfulness but great
[1:09:16] massive wonderful amazing Eternal
[1:09:18] faithfulness
[1:09:21] Hallelujah but he wasn't saying that
[1:09:23] while he was in the stocks he had to get
[1:09:24] out of there and then God showed him a
[1:09:27] New Hope a new day a new season
[1:09:36] Hallelujah before he cursed the day he
[1:09:38] was born but now he says the Lord is my
[1:09:40] portion look he's got no wife he's got
[1:09:42] no child he's got no faithful church
[1:09:43] members but it didn't matter he didn't
[1:09:45] have any of that but one thing he had
[1:09:47] was the Lord hallelujah and church
[1:09:50] really that's all you
[1:09:51] need that's all we need if it comes down
[1:09:55] to it where you don't got anything left
[1:09:57] at least you got
[1:10:00] Christ
[1:10:02] Glory that's your portion that's what
[1:10:04] those 70 people died for was the portion
[1:10:06] of
[1:10:10] Christ saith my soul therefore will I
[1:10:13] hope in
[1:10:14] him like Jesus said don't be afraid of
[1:10:17] man that can just kill your body he said
[1:10:19] be a fearful of God who can kill your
[1:10:21] body and then cast your soul into
[1:10:24] hell hope in God's Grace Hope in God's
[1:10:28] mercy verse 25 I love this the Lord is
[1:10:31] good unto them that wait for him Oh you
[1:10:33] mean you got to wait more brother Jesse
[1:10:35] yes but God is going to be good as you
[1:10:37] wait Hallelujah keep waiting
[1:10:42] Hallelujah to the soul that seeks keep
[1:10:45] seeking God
[1:10:47] hallelujah keep waiting on
[1:10:50] God hope is on the
[1:10:52] way Hallelujah Mercy is on the
[1:10:56] way Grace is on the way
[1:10:59] Hallelujah from a man who went through a
[1:11:02] million times harder things that you and
[1:11:04] I have been through he believed there
[1:11:07] was still Mercy there was still Grace
[1:11:09] there was going to be good mornings
[1:11:12] eventually
[1:11:17] Hallelujah brother Jesse you just don't
[1:11:19] know how hard it is but I don't have to
[1:11:20] because I know what Jeremiah had it was
[1:11:23] hard for him to be with and put in
[1:11:26] stocks and to be thrown alive into a pit
[1:11:29] and drowning in mud it's never happened
[1:11:32] to you and
[1:11:33] I this is a
[1:11:35] man who experienced the worst of the
[1:11:38] worst but is able to go through that
[1:11:41] season just get through it just hold on
[1:11:43] to me Lord just keep me from quitting so
[1:11:45] I don't I don't bring any reproach upon
[1:11:46] your name just keep me from quitting so
[1:11:49] that one day I can see a new light I can
[1:11:51] see a new dawn I can have hope for the
[1:11:54] future and a man that would eventually
[1:11:56] be stoned to
[1:11:59] death verse 26 it is good that a man
[1:12:02] should both hope and quietly wait see
[1:12:06] all that loud complaining see see church
[1:12:08] that's the reason that's the reason
[1:12:10] sometimes we embarrass ourselves or We
[1:12:11] complain God is teaching us don't do
[1:12:14] that next time just quietly wait like
[1:12:18] you've heard me say before this is what
[1:12:19] they told me in football we would have
[1:12:21] to do whatever whatever the position was
[1:12:23] it was maybe a push-up position or
[1:12:24] something and they would just hold us
[1:12:26] there for like it felt like three hours
[1:12:28] but it's probably like five
[1:12:30] minutes and they would uh people would
[1:12:32] start mowing I can still hear those big
[1:12:34] guys
[1:12:35] going and the coach is like suffer in
[1:12:40] silence we're going to do this until you
[1:12:42] stop whining like a bunch of babies and
[1:12:45] we would do it until we stopped
[1:12:49] whining but isn't it amazing we're we're
[1:12:52] trying to be like like it's like a
[1:12:53] football's like a military similar not
[1:12:55] even close to the real thing but you
[1:12:56] don't understand like they're trying to
[1:12:58] train your get you to be mentally tough
[1:13:00] what about
[1:13:02] God God's training trying to train you
[1:13:04] and I to be mentally tough and not just
[1:13:07] go around complaining oh this went bad
[1:13:08] today oh it's been an awful day have you
[1:13:10] had a really bad day though I mean maybe
[1:13:12] a couple I mean really bad day pain
[1:13:16] losing someone you know tragedy maybe
[1:13:19] you've had some no doubt but what did
[1:13:22] Jeremiah go through compared to the pain
[1:13:25] we go
[1:13:27] through so suffer in silence so he
[1:13:30] learned to quietly wait Lord teach me to
[1:13:33] quietly wait for the Salvation of the
[1:13:35] Lord one day salvation means Deliverance
[1:13:38] one day Deliverance is coming whether I
[1:13:41] see it on this side or that side one day
[1:13:43] Deliverance is coming teach me Lord to
[1:13:46] wait quietly guard my mouth so
[1:13:48] complaints and and foolish words don't
[1:13:51] come out of my mouth
[1:13:55] help me to Hope and quietly wait for the
[1:13:57] coming of God's salvation until I get a
[1:13:59] new season of
[1:14:04] life but church is it hard to do yes we
[1:14:06] all go through trials but that's why we
[1:14:07] come to the house of God to learn the
[1:14:10] ways of God who thought they're going to
[1:14:12] hear about Jeremiah tonight and the
[1:14:14] stocks and the beatings and the the
[1:14:16] cursing he was day he was even
[1:14:19] born he said he said cursive be that man
[1:14:22] who brought the tidings of my my birth
[1:14:24] to my father curs like
[1:14:26] what that's how hard life
[1:14:32] was he was beaten as we said put in
[1:14:34] stocks the rest of this chapter chapter
[1:14:37] 20 is emotional roller coaster I don't
[1:14:39] know which preacher I heard that but I
[1:14:40] love that term it's an emotional roller
[1:14:43] coaster up and down the highest of the
[1:14:45] high feelings and the lowest of the lows
[1:14:49] because I like roller coasters some
[1:14:51] people
[1:14:53] don't I've always liked them
[1:14:56] so see Isaiah got burnt by the Holy
[1:14:58] Ghost to put into service Jeremiah gets
[1:15:01] the burning of the Holy Ghost to keep
[1:15:03] him quitting and stay in service so
[1:15:07] Church you're going to need all kinds of
[1:15:08] experiences throughout your life but
[1:15:10] just wait on him God's going to send
[1:15:13] him it looks like that one came while he
[1:15:15] was in the stocks because he says I'm
[1:15:17] quitting you know he wasn't in an easy
[1:15:19] life it wasn't a nice uh season of rest
[1:15:22] for him it seems like wow he's in the
[1:15:23] stocks
[1:15:25] maybe the spirit of God comes on him and
[1:15:27] he keeps speaking for God it's hard to
[1:15:28] tell I don't really
[1:15:30] know and just so you know I'm down to
[1:15:32] about 20 minutes or so I looked it up
[1:15:34] and it seems like Jeremiah has about a
[1:15:35] 100 or 150 prophecies in his writing
[1:15:39] that's a real prophet of God I put 30 of
[1:15:43] brother bram's prophecies in my 2021
[1:15:46] book uh we I can say at least six or 16
[1:15:49] of them I haven't really studied out the
[1:15:51] Divine Healing ones yet but have already
[1:15:53] come to pass there's at least 11 future
[1:15:55] prophecies that I found that are still
[1:15:58] out there and Jeremiah still has verses
[1:15:59] or prophecies that haven't been
[1:16:00] fulfilled yet just like Isaiah the
[1:16:03] Millennium the future home and all these
[1:16:05] great prophecies the Rapture the
[1:16:07] raptures in Isaiah 25: 8-9 so these
[1:16:10] prophets lived and suffered and died
[1:16:12] they were real
[1:16:13] prophets and brother calls them weeping
[1:16:17] prophets I'm sorry Jeremiah's called the
[1:16:19] weeping prophet brother said in the
[1:16:21] broken
[1:16:22] sisters he said now Jeremiah was called
[1:16:25] also the weeping prophet and because I
[1:16:27] believe that this that that this made
[1:16:30] the prophet weep was because him being a
[1:16:33] prophet and the wordl Lord comes to such
[1:16:35] and seeing the people walk after their
[1:16:37] traditions and thought they were all
[1:16:39] right and no way at all to turn
[1:16:43] them so brother said one reason Jeremiah
[1:16:46] wept was because he kept prophesying and
[1:16:49] nobody got a soft heart God help our
[1:16:52] church to have a soft heart on Sunday
[1:16:54] when brother irin preaches to us I saw
[1:16:57] on Sunday a couple soft hearts come up
[1:16:59] here thank God for that and I I'm sure
[1:17:01] if you didn't come up wonderful you know
[1:17:02] I hope you had a soft heart I want
[1:17:04] everybody to have a soft heart that's
[1:17:05] what I'm saying we don't want to harden
[1:17:07] our hearts we want to have a soft heart
[1:17:09] to
[1:17:10] Christ but Jeremiah just saw the
[1:17:12] hardening and the mocking and it saw all
[1:17:14] the persecution and uh the devil anoint
[1:17:17] people his own church members to try to
[1:17:19] upset him and discourage him and that
[1:17:21] made him weep many times because of the
[1:17:24] trial he was going
[1:17:27] through you remember when I preached on
[1:17:29] this uh remember when I preached on
[1:17:30] emotions a couple years ago I got I
[1:17:33] wrote down I three people come up and
[1:17:34] tell me how much they enjoyed that after
[1:17:35] the service brother Ram said of all the
[1:17:38] human emotions Jesus manifested the most
[1:17:41] when he appeared as the son of man was
[1:17:43] this one he wept often he cried a
[1:17:48] lot I would say you know weeping is not
[1:17:51] my most one but I do love when I get to
[1:17:53] weep for the Lord I do love that
[1:17:56] because I feel like I'm feeling his
[1:17:58] heart like I feel like that's when I'm
[1:17:59] really at my most sincere moments when I
[1:18:03] weep for what God weeps
[1:18:06] for but brother man says what is Jesus
[1:18:09] which emotion did he have was it
[1:18:11] happiness gladness shou and joy
[1:18:14] dancing weeping he cried most
[1:18:19] often that was what he was known for by
[1:18:22] his disciples was crying the burden on
[1:18:24] his
[1:18:26] heart he said he wept often yet behind
[1:18:29] that weeping and sorrow there was still
[1:18:31] God behind there so it's showing the
[1:18:34] heart of God how much he loves even the
[1:18:36] lost the Bible said God would that no
[1:18:39] men be lost God would that all men be
[1:18:41] saved but yet God even God even knowing
[1:18:44] the beginning from the end still has a
[1:18:47] heart that cares for them the vessels of
[1:18:49] Dishonor I'm talking about now how much
[1:18:51] more does he love you Church how much
[1:18:53] more does he love do he he knows you're
[1:18:55] not going to blaspheme him you're not
[1:18:56] going to walk away you're going to I'm
[1:18:58] not giving up I'm not turning around
[1:18:59] right by the grace of God someday we'll
[1:19:02] wear The Shining
[1:19:05] Crow butam said those same eyes of Jesus
[1:19:08] saw Visions they looked deep within the
[1:19:10] hearts of men and read their very
[1:19:13] thoughts and knew all their various ways
[1:19:16] blazing out of mortal eyes was God who
[1:19:18] cried to those who knew him not for what
[1:19:20] he was he said if ye believe not that
[1:19:22] I'm he ye shall die in your sin sins
[1:19:25] what a message to
[1:19:27] preach he said if I do not the works of
[1:19:29] my father believe me not but if I do the
[1:19:32] works of my father though you believe me
[1:19:34] believe the works in John 8 and John
[1:19:36] chapter 10 he said like Jeremiah of old
[1:19:40] he was the weeping prophet for men
[1:19:42] receive not the word of God and thrust
[1:19:45] aside the
[1:19:47] Revelation so that's what made Jesus
[1:19:49] weep the most he knew the father gave
[1:19:52] him the word but then to be rejected by
[1:19:54] the very people people he was sent to
[1:19:56] made him Weep the
[1:19:58] most church that's why it's a good
[1:20:00] indicator too of your heart condition
[1:20:03] when you can experience something like
[1:20:05] Jeremiah 9 that's right is Jeremiah no
[1:20:08] Ezekiel 9 where they sigh and cry for
[1:20:11] the Abominations done in the
[1:20:13] city that's why it's important every now
[1:20:15] and then you need to have an experience
[1:20:16] with God Where You Weep over the sins of
[1:20:19] the people what gets me most is abortion
[1:20:22] that's where I'll weep over the sins of
[1:20:24] the people the most just thinking about
[1:20:27] it because I've seen different videos it
[1:20:29] just instantly brings tears to my eyes
[1:20:30] almost and it makes me weep and say God
[1:20:33] how can these people do such awful
[1:20:36] things but God built me that way because
[1:20:39] he knew I wanted to be a real
[1:20:41] believer and so God has built you and I
[1:20:43] different ones you got to get in prayer
[1:20:45] sometimes and just think about sins and
[1:20:47] you got to cry and intercede for these
[1:20:50] people because that's what the Bible
[1:20:51] says God's going to Mark think about
[1:20:53] that he's going to mark everybody touch
[1:20:55] your forehead God's going to spiritually
[1:20:56] put a mark right here if you sigh and
[1:20:58] cry for the Abominations done in this
[1:21:01] city so Church let's get down to let's
[1:21:03] get down to business when we
[1:21:06] pray say Lord what breaks your heart
[1:21:08] because I want that to break my
[1:21:11] heart for you it might be a broken
[1:21:13] family that breaks my heart all the time
[1:21:14] too with my parents divorcing that'll
[1:21:16] make me cry real quick
[1:21:18] too but there's you got to have such a
[1:21:21] heart like God you got to you got to
[1:21:23] care about the things God cares about
[1:21:24] you got to be grieved by the things God
[1:21:26] is grieved for cuz Jesus mostly of all
[1:21:28] emotions he
[1:21:30] wept he wept when his friends
[1:21:33] died he wept and said oh Jerusalem
[1:21:35] Jerusalem how often I would have hovered
[1:21:37] over you like a Hu or brood but you
[1:21:40] would
[1:21:44] not I imagine these brothers in the high
[1:21:46] school they see a lot of things that
[1:21:47] they could weep over every
[1:21:52] day think of the things people see and
[1:21:55] that go through let's remember what does
[1:21:58] God's heart say about a matter that's
[1:22:00] what we have to remember praise God we
[1:22:02] have to remember Lord use my emotions to
[1:22:04] make me more like
[1:22:07] you when people think about me Lord help
[1:22:10] it not to be silly help it to be
[1:22:11] something good like something Stern or
[1:22:14] loving or kind or gracious or sensitive
[1:22:17] to the holy spirit let it be something
[1:22:18] like that praise God when people think
[1:22:21] about you that they really love the Lord
[1:22:23] they have a heart like Jesus's heart
[1:22:29] Hallelujah now I just thought see if I
[1:22:31] can find that quote
[1:22:37] here I want to see if I could find that
[1:22:40] quote real quick where brother was
[1:22:41] tempted to give I don't know if it'll
[1:22:43] work out
[1:22:50] not see if I can pull that up there I
[1:22:52] don't know if I'll be able to but it was
[1:22:54] after his wife died I love the story and
[1:22:57] I just thought of it before I came out I
[1:22:58] didn't have a time to go find
[1:23:06] it I don't promise I'll find it but I'm
[1:23:09] G to try
[1:23:11] here yeah okay yes here it
[1:23:17] is well this is right after brother Ram
[1:23:20] saw those flies around Sharon Rose and
[1:23:23] then she died of uh was it
[1:23:26] menitis he said there the baby laid
[1:23:28] there before the hospital and the
[1:23:29] isolated Ward flies all in her eyes like
[1:23:32] that I took the old mosquito bar I shed
[1:23:35] them away and I put it over her I got
[1:23:37] down and I said
[1:23:38] God there lays my daddy and brother
[1:23:41] Yonder and flowers on their grave there
[1:23:44] lays hope laying Yonder and here is my
[1:23:46] baby dying don't take her
[1:23:50] Lord he just pulled down the curtain as
[1:23:53] if to say shut up I don't want to hear
[1:23:56] you at all he wouldn't even talk to me
[1:24:00] now remember brother Rams running from
[1:24:01] God God told him to go out to the
[1:24:02] Pentecostals and he refused to go and he
[1:24:05] let his mother-in-law call them trash
[1:24:07] and brother didn't correct them or
[1:24:10] correct his mother-in-law brother says
[1:24:12] in some places this was the worst sin of
[1:24:14] his
[1:24:16] life and he suffered the most out of any
[1:24:18] sin because he was going to go out to
[1:24:20] preach and his mother said you can't
[1:24:22] mother-in-law said you'll never take my
[1:24:23] daughter
[1:24:25] a buch a bunch of trash like that
[1:24:27] brother said okay yeah we won't do it he
[1:24:29] gave into his mother-in-law he think
[1:24:31] about that he honored his mother-in-law
[1:24:32] above
[1:24:33] God how many of us would honor our
[1:24:35] husband or wife or father-in-law or
[1:24:37] mother-in-law over
[1:24:40] God always follow
[1:24:45] God so now he's getting the teaching now
[1:24:49] he's getting the
[1:24:51] test and then if God wouldn't talk to me
[1:24:53] it was Satan's time so see Satan's got a
[1:24:55] time he's allowed to come talk to you
[1:24:57] too he said and I thought you said he
[1:25:00] was a good God what's all this you're
[1:25:02] hollering about you're just a boy look
[1:25:05] around over this city every girl and
[1:25:07] every boy you ever associated with think
[1:25:08] you've lost your mind Satan says you
[1:25:13] have Satan never ever has Satan ever
[1:25:15] told you that you've lost your
[1:25:18] mind and you you said God's a good God
[1:25:21] how many times have Satan told me you've
[1:25:22] preached this Jesse
[1:25:25] that liar what a liar you preached this
[1:25:29] you you you you've taught this you why
[1:25:31] isn't God doing more how many times have
[1:25:34] Satan lied to
[1:25:39] me he said you have lost your mind now
[1:25:42] brother back to his thoughts he says now
[1:25:44] Satan couldn't tell me there's no God
[1:25:46] because I'd already seen it but he told
[1:25:49] me he didn't care for
[1:25:51] me right most of us know there's a God
[1:25:55] what does Satan do he's not going to say
[1:25:56] oh there's no such thing as a God you
[1:25:57] know God's real you know the word of God
[1:25:59] you've seen the Holy Spirit do things
[1:26:01] but he'll say oh he doesn't love
[1:26:03] you he doesn't love you that's why
[1:26:05] you're suffering the way you do that's
[1:26:06] the same thing you tried to tell
[1:26:09] Jeremiah just give up just stop stop
[1:26:12] stop serving God just go out enjoy some
[1:26:14] Pleasures in the world with what life
[1:26:16] you got
[1:26:18] left he said I sat all night long all
[1:26:21] day long I said to god what have I done
[1:26:23] show me Lord don't let the innocent have
[1:26:25] to suffer for me if I've done wrong so
[1:26:27] even seeking SE seeking God searching
[1:26:29] his
[1:26:31] life I didn't know he was trying me God
[1:26:36] was testing me in the fiery furnace of
[1:26:40] Affliction but every son that comes to
[1:26:43] God has got to be tried hallelujah amen
[1:26:46] goes back to Hebrews Hallelujah chapter
[1:26:48] 12 every Son of God must be tried
[1:26:51] whether you really believe or not
[1:26:54] so what are you going to say in your
[1:26:55] darkest hour some of us have had some
[1:26:57] pretty dark
[1:26:58] hours
[1:27:02] right so church we want to pass the
[1:27:06] test every son has to be
[1:27:09] tried and I said Lord tell me what I've
[1:27:11] done I'll make it right what have I done
[1:27:13] but preach all day long all night and
[1:27:15] just give my life constantly what have I
[1:27:17] done and then Satan comes back and Satan
[1:27:20] said that's right you see now when it
[1:27:23] comes to you and you've told all them
[1:27:25] that you believe that he's a great
[1:27:27] healer and there lays your baby lying
[1:27:29] there
[1:27:30] dying he refuses to even hear your wife
[1:27:34] died with tubercular
[1:27:36] pneumonia you said he could heal Cancers
[1:27:39] and there there he is talking about God
[1:27:41] there he is doing nothing now you talk
[1:27:43] about him being good and how good is he
[1:27:46] to people how about
[1:27:50] you so now Satan's talked to him twice
[1:27:52] remember
[1:27:54] brother says then I begin to listen to
[1:27:57] him now Church let's not get down on
[1:27:59] brother brandom all of us have done that
[1:28:01] sometimes we start actually considering
[1:28:03] well what if it's so hard what what
[1:28:07] if he said then I begin to listen to him
[1:28:10] that's reasoning and I thought that's
[1:28:12] right he just said that's right to Satan
[1:28:14] he agreed with what Satan
[1:28:17] said Satan said again now the third time
[1:28:20] he could tell you don't even have to
[1:28:22] speak the word just look at at your baby
[1:28:25] if God would just look at your baby it
[1:28:26] would live and brother Ram said again
[1:28:28] that's right God could do
[1:28:32] that and Satan talks again and as much
[1:28:34] of you've done for him and yet that's
[1:28:37] what he does for you and brother R again
[1:28:40] says the third time says that's right
[1:28:44] Satan and I begin to think well what see
[1:28:48] brother said but then everything began
[1:28:50] to break away when it comes to the
[1:28:52] reasoning so he had all these Seasons
[1:28:54] build up oh there it is break away
[1:28:56] that's the stronghold that's the complex
[1:28:58] Hallelujah Satan had built up a complex
[1:29:01] so look how fast a complex can be build
[1:29:04] up oh yeah right Satan that's right
[1:29:06] that's right and look within just a
[1:29:07] matter of moments you have this complex
[1:29:09] breaking up but just when he's about to
[1:29:12] give up he said all the all the complex
[1:29:15] started break the reasoning starts
[1:29:16] breaking away he said but when it come
[1:29:19] to that well about leaving he said that
[1:29:23] anchor that hung it stayed there I was
[1:29:26] just about ready to say then I'll quit
[1:29:29] how many times have we almost said the
[1:29:31] wrong thing what kept you from saying it
[1:29:34] that was God's spirit that kept you from
[1:29:35] saying
[1:29:37] it God's grace God has a predestinated
[1:29:42] boundaries naturally and spiritually
[1:29:44] that you cannot cross and we ought to
[1:29:46] say Amen to that
[1:29:49] Hallelujah God will only let a real
[1:29:51] believer go so far CU he knows the real
[1:29:54] believer doesn't want to he really
[1:29:57] doesn't want she really doesn't want to
[1:29:59] do
[1:30:01] that he said I'm just about to ready to
[1:30:04] say I'll quit like sound like somebody
[1:30:07] familiar a prophet of God
[1:30:11] Jeremiah but when it got down to all the
[1:30:13] reasoning Powers had broke away then it
[1:30:16] came to that eternal life that new birth
[1:30:19] so see the devil's battling up here but
[1:30:21] God God wouldn't let this win thank God
[1:30:24] Hallelujah brother har said and then see
[1:30:26] the test the test of Satan got got here
[1:30:29] it got here and then the test started
[1:30:31] coming down here trying to convince his
[1:30:33] soul to quit but brother BR said when it
[1:30:36] got down here he said that anchor held
[1:30:38] he said because down in the soul was
[1:30:40] eternal life hallelujah amen
[1:30:45] glory he says that eternal life that new
[1:30:48] birth what if it hadn't happened been
[1:30:51] what I'm sorry what if it hadn't been
[1:30:53] there what if it hadn't have we wouldn't
[1:30:56] have known one another the way we do now
[1:30:58] thank God we wouldn't be here except God
[1:31:01] held brother brandom in his greatest
[1:31:02] trial of his life Hallelujah where would
[1:31:04] I be I'd be in the Assemblies of God or
[1:31:06] some Chapel or something like that I'd
[1:31:07] be out there in some denomination but
[1:31:09] because brother Ram's anchor held our
[1:31:11] anchor will hold in our trials
[1:31:13] Hallelujah I say like this because
[1:31:15] Jeremiah's anchor held brother bram's
[1:31:17] anchor held now your anchor will hold
[1:31:19] hallelujah thank God
[1:31:24] this church would not have been like
[1:31:26] this the thousands of millions around
[1:31:28] the world but thank God it was
[1:31:31] there church each day we ought to thank
[1:31:33] God that we have the Holy Ghost because
[1:31:36] if it wasn't there we would have
[1:31:39] quit we would have brought a disgrace
[1:31:41] upon the Lord Jesus
[1:31:43] Christ and then oh here comes the spirit
[1:31:45] of judgment right now oh I see it he
[1:31:48] said then I thought what who am I anyway
[1:31:51] who am I to question his majesty
[1:31:55] Oh see now he's judging himself oh wo is
[1:31:57] me I'm a man of unclean lips look at me
[1:31:59] I'm nothing who am I I can't create a
[1:32:01] blade of grass and yeah this whole God
[1:32:02] created all these uh all these creations
[1:32:05] and life and breath and and dogs and
[1:32:07] pigs and puppies and babies and all
[1:32:08] these things God created just by
[1:32:10] speaking the word
[1:32:12] hallelujah who am I to question the
[1:32:15] Creator that gave me the very life here
[1:32:17] on Earth where did I get that baby who
[1:32:19] gave it to me it's not mine anyhow he
[1:32:22] just loaned her to me for a while and I
[1:32:24] said Satan get away from me church
[1:32:27] that's what you need when you go through
[1:32:28] trials I think I told that to brother ni
[1:32:30] I said you got to talk to Satan in your
[1:32:31] room and say Satan get behind
[1:32:34] me he said I went over I laid my hands

[1:32:55] believe you if you send me to hell I'll
[1:32:57] love you anyhow I can't get away from
[1:32:59] that there you
[1:33:01] are he said if it was just intellectual

[1:33:35] a man like brother
[1:33:37] brandom who in their greatest darkest
[1:33:40] trials were able to stand the test and
[1:33:44] overcome and as brother Adam says in his
[1:33:47] darkest trial here it wasn't he that was
[1:33:49] holding on it was Christ holding on to
[1:33:52] him because he accepted eternal life

[1:37:49] told maybe I told this before there was
[1:37:52] one day I doubted the message when I
[1:37:54] first came in the message there was one
[1:37:56] night all these denominational guys
[1:37:58] gathered into my room there on bookto
[1:38:01] street and they just started talking all
[1:38:03] these things about brother brandom and
[1:38:04] this they saw on the internet and they
[1:38:06] just worked on me so long it got me
[1:38:08] discouraged and we just agreed to pray
[1:38:11] that I was going to leave the message
[1:38:12] and I went to bed that night saying I'm
[1:38:15] done with the message there was one day
[1:38:16] I've got of this
[1:38:17] message I woke up the next morning I
[1:38:19] remember I was going into the bathroom I
[1:38:21] got a phone call from Brother Craig Bo
[1:38:23] he said Hey brother Jesse it's the only
[1:38:25] time he's called me in all all my
[1:38:27] life preachers don't have a lot of time
[1:38:29] to call people
[1:38:31] okay but his first words were brother
