to come few weeks ago I forgot about it that's alright let you know about that so forgive me but yesterday I had a reunion get our 20-year reunion from high school when he won the state championship and I set up the whole event and did all this work my whole point was to share about Christ and I got to last about 50 or 60 people of God gave me those athletic abilities to bring me to Akron just to be a pastor I don't think God really cares about football the track knows nothing in the scripture that says you get a reward nothing if the Bible says that crowd fades away there was a heavenly crowd that's winning souls for Jesus Christ so I got to share about the church here and I gave the example sister Naomi she's not here but she moved from Ghana to Akron 5560 one mile she flew and she was worried I'm gonna lose my faith and I there's no churches there that believe what we believe you know like holding this Holy Ghost and she just um I don't even know where accurate is there's not even a church here and then she found out about a year later that there was a church here as I said I knew that's one more proof that God set me the acronym to be a pastor to feed his sheep by the grace of the Lord so I got to share that was about you know 50 people last night I just said if anybody wants to know Jesus Christ please contact me no one has yet I'm going to keep contacting them sometimes you got to chase them down sometimes you got to go after the Sheep I'm gonna keep doing that by the grace of God so so happy because Simon could come and minister here we're looking forward to it grace of God I'm gonna the Lord today what's your stand here as most time that comes with Justine one more something I've seen just over in the glory land over there where the Saints abide just over their holy land and I long to be a my Savior sign that would you today along to be back Jesus amen just walk in eternity [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] studied every every Thursday at brother Mike McCluskey's house and I taught on the cleft of the rock and that's a that's a powerful to me is it really gave me hope that if you're done dying a dead condition a dried-out condition you just have to get to the cleft of the rock and right there is the only place you can get back the joy or life anyhow if we could turn to Deuteronomy 30 verse 15 for the malachi in the back running the show by the grace of god man I've seen him out here playing piano last time and he's really helping his daddy out praise the Lord thank God also for brother Loras and his family for laboring on the where the doc use of the piano their organ and uh thank God for those gifts which I know nothing about absolutely I'm just happy to be able to carry a tune by the grace of God amen and I my brother Jesse really can't conceive pretty decent really good and I just I just kind of I just harmony Deuteronomy 30 verse 15 see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil so God is saying he's I right here I'm placing both life and death now it rests on you in this commandment thee in in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God he says to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that that thou may a slim and multiply yes and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess but if thy heart be turned away so that I will not hear but shall be drawn away look a great falling away and worship other gods and serve them i denounce unto you this day that thou shalt surely perish and that thou shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passes over Jordan go to possess it he says these things but notice where he goes the very next verse I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that thou that that that both thou and thy seed may live let's bow our heads and a word of prayer your only father go Jesus we love you Lord we've humble ourselves there in the side room Lord and confessed any wrong as Lord told you my faults confessing faults once in another Lord and Lord we we do not hide anything from you Lord God and we do our best to serve you Lord with the capabilities the gifts the humility Lord the ability to yield to you Lord the very best we can Lord and then we went to yield to you fully God our desire Lord our flesh has absolutely no desire but Lord deep within Lord and our so Lord our sealed soul God of the Holy Ghost God Lord that royal seed God Lord that incorruptible seed that was planted and concealed our soul Lord and joined with you know God we want that every everything there God wants to obey your word 100% thor's we want to give you everything the spirit is a wind Lord but the flesh is weak and how often we find ourselves failing Lord we love you so much nor just bless this little service may be a blessing here is encouragement or strength however Lord and we love your best to hear the name Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats the last six months was a real trial for me my dog has had come down with cancer slowly dying we've had two surgeries prayed and prayed spoke the Word of God with faith and prayed and spoke the word and prayed and God was silent and I didn't have any more money for another surgery that cancer is a very aggressive cancer right back I have no children so this was my child had mercy on me that was my baby the Lord took her Wednesday night he watched her fade for the last two weeks to where she wouldn't eat she would hardly drink she waited until I got home from work Wednesday knowing Church is coming up I don't want to leave her I laid beside her for a good hour and 15 then I said me I told my wife I said it man maybe we should take her outside two days before that she took all the rest of her energy that strength she had and she she spent the entire day outside just looking around laying there labored breathing for almost three weeks just barely breathe and God took her I took her outside looked at the chickens and you know I held her and then we went back in set her down she was standing barely standing not sure I'm sharing this just want to let you know the that we have one another we don't know when if this will be our last time together as the man of God the prophetess day he'd always say at the end of service during service he says he says we may never meet here again but we will he said on the other side be encouraged God is faithful I watched her go I watched her take her last breaths and it was very very painful to watch death amen the last time my dog died another dog here her sister died my dad said I hate life I said no dad you hate death dying is not part of life life is life life is eternal if you find the right source my dad hates death and I hate death as well so be enough keep us in prayers we're just trying to move on you know believing God it's still very very tender spot but I kind of want to teach this because I want to see my dog again the man of God the Prophet went over took behind the curtain of time and he saw Fritz right there his dog that the policeman had killed poisoned right I'm leaving on these things so today I'd like to teach on your testimony versus the Earth's testimony the Bible says God said you can live or you can die and he said I call heaven and earth against you this day to record a diss against you in proverbs 6 verse 6 the Bible says go to the ant he says thou sluggard so God now he says he says examine this little portion of creation these little insignificant things you can walk through the day you can walk over concrete you can walk through dirt and chances are you won't see the ant why cause it's so tiny it's so miniscule absolutely but that ant is displaying a character that many people in this age know nothing about the ant is a worker the ant prepares for the winner constantly digging out new holes planting new colonies absolutely they work and work and work and I from a science I hear they can barely even see and yet they work and they work and they go by a sense and God says go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise a man he says which have no guide he says overseer or ruler he says provide us her meat in the summer and gathered food in what in the harvest prepping absolutely making sure they take care little baby the little ones popping out of the eggs oh yeah absolutely what they prepare for their own they they're working machines absolutely how long without sleep o sluggard when that arise out of thy sleep you won't know how to work he says look at the ant he says that nature will teach you right there your testimony versus the earth and Isaiah 1 verse 2 he says hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the Lord has spoken he says I have nourished and brought up thy children and they have rebelled against me God dealt with Israel or the nation call him out he says he he says your mind the Bible said that Israel was God's firstborn right a firstborn son the firstborn son is the is the special one oh my um I hope number 4 got all the heights and looks speed and a billion fly 24 feet praise the Lord amen he says but Lukey says the Ox knows his owner he says and they ask his master's crib he says but Israel does not know my people nor consider oh my god saying I dealt with Israel he but they don't even understand it they are mine but he says look at these animals he says the Ox in the ass he says they know who their master is oh my yes sir my pups when I come home of my cats they greet me right outside of my little work van because I they know I'm their master and I'm gonna give him a treat am i laying down the pen a little bit but they know who the master is of the house he said but Israel had lost that ability to discern who the master is amazing God examining he says just go look at nature on the earth in the book of Job 12 God speaks to me a lot of times in nature right before the last time I went to Thailand I was walking on a jobsite and a certain scene in nature was going on and it caught my attention and I go over what is to this workers walking past me this way that way I'm standing in my hard hat and I'm just sitting here watching us little these insects do a certain thing next up there for ten minutes and I said what is gonna happen next one week into Thailand I get a call and it had taken place God teaches in nature be watchful keep your eyes about you as the Prophet the Prophet is that he says he said I catch little things and God shows me to cut what's to come the past or whatever is that just the nature let me give you example and one of the sermons I listened to recently he said he said you examine he says you look at the hawk that bird of prey he says an air Hawk was a strong Hawk at one time it's like high up just like the eagle he says but now I Drive my car he says and I'm looking at a telephone poles and your Hawk rests right on the telephone pole it does not soar looking he just sits there on getting lazy he says lazy on the little telephone poles now on the Turnpike really didn't hit the little fences and you'll see them Hawk sitting him five foot above the ground he said they become lazy right just within this year that's the nature within this year I've seen three Eagles eating roadkill Eagles bald eagles the nation's bird eagle the type of a prophet the eagle one agency yes and now the eagle has got solo or maybe there's so little food out there I don't know but now always going down two of them I I've had to stop in the middle road the Eagle eating the worm these things now but it's still an eagle the Bible says God will restore hey man absolutely joke 12 or 7 brother he says but now asked the beasts he says and they shall teach thee he says the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee Omaha they'll tell the condition of church they'll can tell the condition of the Eagles in this land in America they'll teach you keep your eyes open and watch nature this one time look at how they're acting in this day are they our nation you'll see he says or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee how is the earth gonna teach us anything you cannot even speak and the fishes of the sea and they shall declare it to me to declare unto thee who knoweth not in all these things that the hand is Lord has rosters and whose hand is the soul of every living thing in the breath of all mankind does not the ears try the words and the mouth taste his meat he says listen he says look he says nature will teach you something time for sober you know the Word of God is powerful I heard this joke a while back about Chuck Norris you know then Chuck Norris jokes they have he said Chuck Norris his mom never gave many toys why because Chuck Norris don't play right and God did not send us any toys he sent us a sword why not to play around with the world an area just I really did last night my tiny I'm saying this my eldest nice I got to me her boyfriend last night she specifically went out and brought the man to me but this tall pretty tank like my cousin Adam fine I didn't back down I played though I played the tiny old crazy uncle for hats right I'm 40 I looked at him I said turn around turn around I'm looking a lot you know I'm just kinda messing with I said okay alright how you doing okay which name saver nice to meet you god bless you this does this mess a little bit I said Paige you got baptized yet she says no I said good that's not about you he said he says I'm a Catholic he's not baptized on his baby I said alright we are you guys ready for Bible study and they go they look each other said yeah will do Bob say I said alright when he's a to say racism let's do this saints of God I'm looking at a battle I'm looking every opportunity we're at the end times my family must go in and we must protect the children of God in this hour that's a nice brother but I'm gonna I'm gonna try by the word we must try by the word yeah absolutely Romans 1 verse 18 now look at this your testimony vs. the earth Romans 1 verse 18 he says for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness these are preachers going behind here and uh next service I'm gonna teach specifically on this podium right here on this place yeah a little study God opened up to me and everyone has heard it has been blessed so alright now look at verse 19 because that which may be known of God is manifested them so God the things that God wants them to see he says are manifest their seed what in nature they're seen in creation the very thing God wants them to see to what to teach them he's placed before them they don't have to do anything but go outside for God has showed it unto them where did he show it unto them verse 24 the invisible things of him from the creation in the world are create clearly seen everything that we need to learn we can look at the things that are already made well from what the invisible invisible the spoken word the vibrational power that come out of God through spoken word now has created everything this wood was a spoken word of God but now it's visible and we can look at it and we can understand what God had in his mind by looking and examining it mrs. wood it's hard as durable we can now make things out of it absolutely but God have we wants to teach you to nature yes he say in for the municipal things of him from creation are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even now what now what does he want to teach he says he wants to teach what his eternal power how strong he is how mighty is he speaks the word and just go take a vacation for two weeks and just drive and you'll see everything some of the stuff you mean he says he wants to show his power and Godhead amen God what is God is God three persons or one person the Bible says that nature will teach us the earth he says ask the earth ask the beasts he says they'll teach us if there's one God or three me and my old pastor brother Brooks went down to Florida for vacation time four days we went to the Holy Land the Holy Land the experience and we're walking through this holy name experience in Orlando Florida and we walk around everybody's every dressed in the old Bible outfits in this net there's a giant Philistine man that's probably six foot five a Philistine outfit on or boy your outfit and he's just walking around and he starts talking to a little boy we're listening to and he starts talking about Trinity this little boy and I'm watching this guy gun this man all down to this little child he said it's guess he said little boy he said God is like but we should like he says there's the Father Son and Holy Ghost the shell the white and the yolk he said God is like an egg and he's teaching him through nature right but show me one of Scripture right that Tice God is a name I thought that before wouldn't that that's a chicken mentality you take an egg that has not been with the male little rocks and I can that be a soccer ball right but give life in nature yeah scripture after scripture after scripture the Bible declares that God is like the s UN is the Sun of righteousness what brings the light is the SU n how many su ways are in the sky one and there sometimes you wish you could just go back and just take the sword and slay and don't eat so God says these things are evident God teaches in nature yes the gospel has went from the east to the west thank the Lord because we're the last recipients of the gospel here in America oh my it started in Jerusalem and made its way all the way study history look at all the revivals and Europe and all these things and then a 1906 what we had the Sousa Street revival yes the power God came now the restoration of the gifts everything goes from east to west the UN goes from east to west but not alone the moon follows and she follows everywhere he goes a man and she reflects his light wherever he where as she can I meant the very best she can she reflected when he's out of sight if she could can see she can but if he's out of obedience is quiet and and does not reach the light at her she just has to remain dormant but she's still the moon amen Deuteronomy 4 verse 26 he says I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day right now your testimony vs. the earth on judgement day how will you stand against the earth how will you be compared against the earth let's say you're part of the bride how will you speak to the earth will the earth be able to utter anything against you what if someone comes up in the general resurrection as a foolish virgin and now the earth is taken as a witness against it forget that forget the the big screen of his life let's just God just raises the earth up against that man or woman how will God be able to compare from the earth this person in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters God created the earth of all the planets he picked one yes what is the mystery predestination how come we didn't pick Mars how come he picked Jupiter or Pluto that explanatory the new percent who knows what it is now he's but he specifically picked the earth a chosen vessel and a true seed of God was picked at the foundation of the world amen the true seed of God a child of God they was they always were a child all the way back then even before they were naturally born they were spiritually because God painted what the spirit man first back in Genesis 2 yes the 2nd Thessalonians 2:13 he says we were bound to give thanks always to Jesus Christ for you brother and beloved in the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation God chose the earth he chose you he's because they had to perform our work in you yeah the performer work in the earth hey man something there was a desire there's a plan there was a story they had to take place there there has to be more to testimony I mean God can use the earth just like I can me you better believe it but notice the earth was a dark condition without shape his void darkness there was no light there until Genesis 1:5 so the earth wasn't dark and the saints of God we were born in iniquity shaped and all these things come out of the womb speaking lies absolutely isaiah 40:8 40 aces and was called a transgressor from the womb a man when I was born I was already a thief I was already a liar a liar a cheater on this earth and I was just bad I was bad boy my momma thought I was cute doesn't [Laughter] every child is cute for their mama praise the Lord a man a man praise be to God now in 1st Corinthians 6:9 knowing that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived he says neither fornicators nor adulterers nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind he said this time will not be in the kingdom oh my and that kingdom what is the kingdom of the Holy Ghost God set up kingdom that has naught power signs wonders and miracles that are obedient to the Word of God he says but they used to be like this correct he says nor thieves verse 10 the coaches no joggers or miles executioner's shall inherit the kingdom eases and such were some of you right here shoe hands both my legs are shaking he said that wasn't me and such were the changes come but you're washed he says but you're sanctified he's the buddy you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the spirit of our God by your good works by your by the way you haters have no reason by the Spirit of God and only by the Spirit of God by my spirit saith the Lord thanks back with the Spirit of God were nothing we cannot earn salvation we can't Ernie we can't merit it it takes the Spirit of God that said we were fully dependent on him it alone man so we find ourselves in a dark condition but then the light comes and says this is definitely one of my child a child will be followed by that light has that light within them already that seed that work the earth worked her over started bringing forth life on the earth but as a human is made every the Bible says every seed will bring forth of its kind the earth at this time though as a vessel had no seed in it and as we know the Word of God as we do there's two areas the Bible says that Jesus when he died he went to the heart of the earth there's also a first see that went to the heart of the earth was it was a seed of God we entered in that little place that don't come partnered in the earth the paradise and now [Music] [Applause] that's right Christian earth brother Brooks gave me his dog before he moved to Iowa he said both sigh take care of her she's a Christian dog she was she was humbled she'd submit to others she'd bow or so never called me any problems why cuz he was a Christian amen she's a preacher's dog hey man so we see the earth now as a seed within earth the first seed planted in the earth and that seed had a voice and it reached God and came down and condemned King a man the heart of the earth the Earth's heart amen now let's continue and in Genesis 3 verse 14 though there's a seat of God within the earth though there's a seat of God in our vessels we find ourselves come out Genesis 3 verse 17 and unto Adam he said because I was hearken unto the voice of my wife and his agent of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat him cursed is the ground for thy sakes the earth now takes on the curse not the not the seed within the earth the earth itself the body see we have this curse now with this called sin it's a disease the Bible says the love of some loathsome disease and the Bible says there's no discharge to that war what's the war you'll die because of sin in this vessel cancer we've always had cancer it's called sin it takes about 80 70 years for that thing to kick in and take lives God curses the earth and we know our flesh is cursed but don't judge the earth by the curse and don't judge yourself by it's false at the soul when I'd like a brother who's a I don't look at any faults where I said that man is a seat of God amen Christ the purchase power died for that so must be equal value correct absolutely when we ever saying against Jesus Christ in his in his dying body no we say that was the Lamb of God that was my Savior a man but when he died he gave himself for it because he was worth the same thing or more than he had the ability to buy it and he he placed he put us like this he paid with the most valuable thing he had his own his very own body god you're not gonna see Jesus Christ up in heaven in a different form a different body it'll be that exact same body hey man that's his body that's God's own flesh right there glorified body Jesus Christ amen lorry try it so we see the earth is a Christian earth but she's lost he got the curse on her so no God must now start working salvation working so based on the earth the earth has she's lost but Jesus he's got a seat of God in her absolute but she's still lost she's got a curse and with me yes yes what is the process of salvation God above the earth now sees the earth and a cursed state he says I must bring her to Redemption I've got to save the earth much like Oz correct but what does God do for salvation the very first thing God must have it's his word and and what does he do with the word God has the word of God in his mind he's thinking he dwells in the word and gasps he's dwelling there and he must send the word of God to the word of God must come to a profit first yes according to Scripture who is the first prophet on the earth there's many that prophesied but as far as specifically labeled a prophet in Jude The Book of Judas said that Enoch prophesied he said I see 10,000 Saints coming up with the Lord a lot he says foes of glory oh ma so the Word of God must come to a prophet and then I remember all 66 books in the Bible or written by what they're called their names the Book of Isaiah Moses for suppose about the five first right we believe that yes Isaiah Ezekiel Joe John James these are prophets of God and the Word of God comes to the prophet and the Prophet blasts the word out then does that bring salvation yes but what takes place next how does this work the Word of God comes from heaven hits the man of God he catches the relation for his day and then he blasts it out in Romans 10 verse 13 it says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved he says then how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed he says in how shall they believe in him who they not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher he says and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of the priests of God so I'm presuming drink bring good bring glad tidings of good things so the Prophet brings the word blast it out and then what the fivefold ministry now picks up the word the rest and start blasting it as well who is the first preacher recorded in Scripture what from prophet to preacher the Bible says what that Noah was a preacher of righteousness a man boy he's a son that is fixing to happen you better get right he said in the witness of the earth become great in that day oh my absolutely Noah's day Jesus said it was a wicked time oh my but there was a preacher who caught the revelation from Enoch the Prophet the Word of God he said he started preaching the word a man and what the earth was preached for a hundred and twenty years hey the people didn't hear so well but the earth did at the end of the hundred twenty years sermon no I'm saying boys destructions coming you better make sure you're in the ark and the BIOS at the end of the hundred twenty years sermon Noah picked up his Bible for the last time said boys something fixing to comment or get in get in and yeah and getting the Christ oh my and then when he closed his book for the last time the entire humanity was not ready but the Bible said the earth brought forth gushing waters and the skies began to cry and the gushers the gushed out and she started to cry and the Bible said that the water ascended all the way above the highest mountain their repentance went all the way to the earth absolutely for sure look at now they was baptized before we ever heard about it alive the earth was light-years above us there were no higher standard walking a tighter walk with Christ absolutely she repented alright Fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows I haven't opened we do not believe in dry our confessions the last time I come to church he was he was born he was there we were all there any man praise God oh the earth got baptized but notice directly after that baptism God says this in Genesis 9 Genesis 9 notice what he says Genesis 9 verse 13 he says I do set my bow in the cloud he says it shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth with the earth with the earth was this one the more that's why we pushed that baptism so hard because the Bible says in acts 2 or 36 he says that same Jesus whom that Cruise riders but Lauren cries either and if ye shall repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what a prize what baptism is the Covenant but it must be the true baptism Amen that's right praise God what is it one work of grace the earth had to wait another two thousand years until the true Lamb of God you've already justified but now seeing that blood of the Lamb of God that's why you get that Christ had to be beaten outside the camp and all these things so that blood could and when I'm glad that sanctified precious brother Lord ie Savior Jesus Christ oh my I understand what watching someone die is now but I can really relate oh my that brother is so precious right if we lightly esteemed it told me God will reject us I says that it's in that that they lightly esteemed has this message waxed fat ah he's preaching on the blood again he's preaching on this and that saints of God of lightness that blood of Jesus Christ hit the earth and completely second God ain't done with her yet and he's not done with us yet oh my it's a process sanctified by the precious blood of God not a mortal man the eternal invisible God created up his personal own body filled with his own blood and within that blood was his own life Damon God Himself not a son a separate son he's on body the son yeah why they called the son because it came in the likeness of a son amen yes after the salvation what starts following the Bible these signs shall follow them that believe in Luke 21 verse 10 it says and he said in the nation shall rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be given and diverse places and famines and pestilence fearful sights and great signs shall be from heaven the earth has signs as well given when she quakes when it's tornado these are signs of the earth come on these signs are following her testimony praise the Lord and what Satan knows as surely that the original Church Pentecost with the true power of God March 16 in action is the true church - Jesus claims to be his own or else false he says all else is false it has to be and a true born-again believer will what have signs and wonders following he says that is that is it right there there is no other that's the original it must match the end in Romans 5 verse 3 he says not only so but we shall glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience to mine so after someone say they'll have tribulations and trials and fiery darts shot at him Satan the hound - he'll be right on in the earth after he/she sanctified has signs wonders and miracles following her and also she goes into a Great Tribulation the earth does as well absolutely but after the fire except relations and trials the earth goes - in revelations 19 the Bible says that Christ the Messiah comes down now with his bride and he burns the earth and gives her the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's an absolute perfect type if someone was without the Holy Ghost how can they stand against the earth will say I Oh bad sign if I owe her something God hey that's the same see bird has absolutely no power in William Lane after the birth receiver baptism by fire baptism and here I find myself giving veto prophesy Jesus is coming on people he says that Satan will not know what [Music] [Applause] he's the Lord all right amen the Millennium the God ain't done with her yet the baptism of the fire going on earth feeling pretty good God has now taken over her kingdom and the ap2 the angels the saints of God now are ruling and reigning over over her vessel come I remember she still is cursed your still has that curse but she's still got the coven as well and that covenant guarantees another thing yeah yes Lord in Revelations 21 what's next for the Holy Ghost filled Christian what's next in line well our next promise we've been saying with a bear tie we've got the Holy Ghost revelation 21:1 and I saw the new heaven and the new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea the earth gets a body change yeah absolutely the earth gets a body change all the generations all of them hello all the cities are taken out of the earth and burning fire and now she gets a body changed just to the true believers the glorified body in the millennia what will get our new bodies will build go plant whatever you're tired we want to sweep things we'll never get sick again little thing in here to makes us weep and cry feelings will never get hurt again everything's gonna be all right [Applause] the earth gets a body change just as the saints of God the Lord doesn't add much from the scripture after that the rest is a mystery what is eternity like what do we do what's gonna happen when we fulfill the quote we'll speak other worlds into existence to go live on what will happen next I don't know that's all a mystery I guess the unwritten word yet to be revealed with saying to God the main thing is we have to get there we must make it if you want to stand saints of God don't let the earth will whoop you the one thing I like about this study is that it's all predestination yeah God's and look what is love it's election re around the earth I'm looking at the earth they see some different something about this scene there's a like one yes real life your only father whatever it takes Jesus in every soul here going ready for what's like Abraham not looking at the deadness of his flesh ready to receive the promised son ruler Lord Jesus we're believing off the innocent word God although I see the deadness of this that's the curse still remaining order you see the earth it makes her process and she makes it good we know the end we know the beginning and indeed begin in the end Lord she went yeah and there we know the good in the end
