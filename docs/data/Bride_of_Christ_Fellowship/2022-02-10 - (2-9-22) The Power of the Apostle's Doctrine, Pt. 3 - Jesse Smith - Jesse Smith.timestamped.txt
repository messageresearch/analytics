[0:00] three
[0:04] i guess you can start the live stream
[0:05] perhaps you already have
[0:10] i'll have some slides to show
[0:18] ii timothy 3 1
[0:20] 2 timothy 3 1
[0:25] 2 timothy 3 1.
[0:33] i'm going to pick up right where i left
[0:35] off lord willing on sunday
[0:39] as far as with
[0:41] the writings of saint paul ii timothy 3
[0:45] 1.
[0:52] look at part 3 here of the power of the
[0:54] apostles doctrine
[1:04] let's read verse one together
[1:09] if we can on three one two three
[1:12] this know also that in the last days
[1:16] perilous times shall come
[1:19] go down to verse 10 because we'll be
[1:20] looking at these uh descriptions of the
[1:23] dangerous times we live in right now
[1:25] let's read verse 10 together on three
[1:27] one two three but thou hast fully known
[1:31] my doctrine manner of life purpose
[1:34] faith longsuffering charity
[1:38] patience amen may god has a blessing to
[1:40] read his word you may be seated
[1:42] tonight by god's grace
[1:49] so it's quite a list here uh if you go
[1:51] to verse 2
[1:53] here's the list again i'm going to put
[1:55] it up here so you can see it
[1:56] it's quite a list
[2:00] paul describes our day
[2:02] the last days now this there can be an
[2:05] argument made that this means the last
[2:06] 2000 years and i would i would say amen
[2:09] to that
[2:10] but no doubt
[2:11] it does mean the last days as well our
[2:14] days
[2:15] and have we ever seen a scripture that
[2:18] is more true than this
[2:20] that the time we're living in is a time
[2:22] of self-love
[2:24] right covetous people they only want
[2:27] what they want
[2:28] boasters bragging on themselves
[2:31] proud
[2:32] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[2:35] unthankful unholy without natural
[2:37] affection
[2:39] you know it's so rare you find even
[2:40] children that uh obey their parents it's
[2:42] so rare we were at the dentist today and
[2:44] the dentist told me he said a lot of
[2:45] children come through here he said i i
[2:47] want you to know your children are
[2:49] different than them
[2:51] i said that's cause they hear me scream
[2:52] at them preaching three times a week
[2:55] i said i said i appreciate them three
[2:56] times a week but i said then mom their
[2:58] mom's at home i said i give mom all the
[2:59] credit
[3:00] uh but it you know it's the word of god
[3:02] as well but you know they can recognize
[3:05] there's a there's a strip there's a
[3:07] major difference between worldly
[3:08] children and christian children
[3:11] because they're obedient to parents and
[3:13] that's what we should strive for labor
[3:15] for obedience
[3:18] they're unthankful in this day they're
[3:19] unholy
[3:20] without natural affection truce breakers
[3:22] false accusers incontinent means lack of
[3:25] self-control as we looked at on sunday
[3:26] with temperance you know as we looked at
[3:29] the the evening service about taking
[3:30] care of your body
[3:32] uh
[3:33] showing self-control that's an anointing
[3:35] of the holy spirit to control what goes
[3:38] in your body what comes out of your
[3:39] mouth
[3:40] what you look at with your eyes that's
[3:42] an anointing of the holy spirit
[3:45] fierce
[3:47] despisers of those that are good
[3:48] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[3:51] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[3:53] a form of godliness but denying the
[3:56] power thereof so
[3:57] let it be known of course that many
[3:59] churches have a form of godliness it
[4:02] looks like reverence that's what the
[4:03] word godliness means piety and reverence
[4:07] but there's they're lacking the power to
[4:09] be reverent they're lacking the power
[4:12] to be
[4:13] really pious or aware of the holy spirit
[4:17] so the bible says turn away from them
[4:20] we have a right like we were talking
[4:21] earlier in the car we have a right to
[4:23] turn away from people that don't follow
[4:24] the word
[4:26] we have a right the bible said to avoid
[4:27] them
[4:28] we have a right to not let them into our
[4:30] homes
[4:31] so let's read that one while we got a
[4:33] second john since we're talking we had
[4:35] mentioned that in the car i was talking
[4:36] with austin elena you have a scriptural
[4:38] right if anyone does not bring the
[4:40] doctrine of jesus christ you do not let
[4:42] them in your home
[4:48] verse nine is just a it's been a
[4:49] tremendous revelation for me
[4:51] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[4:54] in the doctrine of christ
[4:56] hath not god
[4:57] see if someone can't learn the doctrine
[4:59] of christ they're not born again
[5:02] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[5:04] christ hath both the father and the son
[5:07] hallelujah
[5:09] verse 10
[5:10] if there come any
[5:13] unto you and bring not this doctrine
[5:16] receive him
[5:18] not into your house neither bid him
[5:20] god's speed
[5:22] okay so if anyone comes and they don't
[5:24] preach our doctrine or bible doctrine do
[5:26] not let them in your house and then
[5:28] don't even say god speed you on your way
[5:30] god bless you on your way you don't even
[5:31] do that
[5:33] right
[5:34] because that's what the bible said
[5:36] neither have been in god's speech
[5:37] because verse 11 he that abideth him
[5:40] godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds
[5:44] so someone who preaches false doctrine
[5:45] or teaches false doctrine don't say god
[5:47] bless you or hope your ways are blessed
[5:49] because they're doing evil
[5:51] that's different if you don't know and
[5:53] it's different if they're a foolish
[5:54] virgin that's different too because
[5:55] remember jesus said anyone that's not
[5:57] against us is for us that's how you know
[5:59] if they're for you
[6:01] praise god then they're not against us
[6:03] praise god if they're for jesus right
[6:07] but if we know their doctrine is sly we
[6:09] know they're they're liars and we know
[6:11] they're deceivers and we know they're
[6:12] demon-possessed
[6:14] which anyone any man that would prophesy
[6:16] in the name of the lord and be wrong
[6:17] they'd be demon-possessed for sure
[6:18] because it's a lying spirit
[6:21] anyone that would do that you don't be
[6:23] you don't bid them godspeed and you
[6:24] don't let them in your house is that
[6:25] understood you guys see that
[6:27] ii john that's second john 1
[6:30] 9 10 and 11.
[6:33] so you have a right to protect your home
[6:35] you have a right to protect the
[6:36] atmosphere of the holy spirit praise god
[6:40] so paul clearly says in chapter 3 of ii
[6:43] timothy now getting back here
[6:45] but you've fully known my doctrine
[6:48] so clearly what what differentiates the
[6:50] lost world
[6:52] the the dangerous sinners from paul
[6:55] paul's doctrine the way he lived his
[6:57] manner of life his purpose in life
[7:00] his faith his longsuffering his charity
[7:02] and his patience so i just want to take
[7:04] this a little bit further
[7:06] so paul's doctrine from jesus produces
[7:09] the opposite conditions
[7:11] of the perilous times
[7:13] okay
[7:14] so if these are sinful perilous uh uh
[7:18] behaviors paul's doctrine will give us
[7:21] opposite
[7:22] okay so the blue is the opposite
[7:26] so instead of loving yourself what do
[7:27] you do you crucify the lust of your
[7:29] flesh
[7:30] paul's doctrine will produce the
[7:32] opposite of this
[7:33] right instead of you being covetousness
[7:35] always wanting more you'll be generous
[7:39] instead of bragging on yourself you'll
[7:41] brag on jesus
[7:44] instead of being proud the bible says
[7:45] you'll be poor in spirit well i'm weak
[7:48] without jesus i got to have jesus i'm
[7:49] nothing without jesus that's foreign
[7:51] spirit
[7:53] instead of blaspheming which is calling
[7:55] good works of the devil
[7:56] you'll worship jesus in truth praise god
[8:00] instead of being disobedient you'll obey
[8:02] your parents and all the children said
[8:06] amen
[8:08] instead of being unthankful you'll be
[8:10] thankful
[8:11] instead of being unholy you'll be holy
[8:13] which means separated
[8:15] you're separated from the things of the
[8:16] world unto god
[8:19] instead of having
[8:20] no natural affection you'll have natural
[8:22] affection you'll love the things of
[8:24] nature right you'll love nature
[8:27] you'll love
[8:28] babies right you'll love
[8:31] sunrises sunsets you'll love nursing
[8:33] mothers right you'll love pregnant white
[8:35] women you know
[8:37] you'll love fathers that love their
[8:39] children
[8:40] you'll love fatherhood motherhood you'll
[8:42] love grandparents that love kids you
[8:44] know you'll love everything beautiful
[8:46] that god described about life praise god
[8:50] but you know did you see those protests
[8:52] a few weeks ago in washington dc they
[8:54] were protesting the supreme court's
[8:55] decision about abortion and they had
[8:57] women on live tv take abortion pills
[9:00] and uh they're shouting cheering
[9:02] clapping for those abortions that are
[9:03] done right there right in the presence
[9:05] see they're cheering on death because
[9:07] they're under the spirit of the
[9:08] antichrist death
[9:10] right and then there was a woman
[9:12] preacher who came out this week said her
[9:14] abortion was the most
[9:15] beautiful thing that she's ever
[9:17] experienced with god such a lie such a
[9:19] lie
[9:21] because that's a murderous spirit right
[9:23] they don't have natural feelings for
[9:25] love for for real love
[9:27] right they lost that a long time ago
[9:30] see they're truce breakers they don't
[9:32] but we're promise keepers right we keep
[9:34] our promise
[9:36] we're not false accusers we're truthful
[9:38] witnesses
[9:40] we're not incontinent we're
[9:41] self-controlled we're not fierce we're
[9:43] tame and gentle
[9:45] hallelujah
[9:47] we don't despise those that are good we
[9:49] rejoice with the body of christ if we
[9:51] hear a good testimony we say praise the
[9:53] lord we don't get jealous of other
[9:55] churches if they have great testimonies
[9:57] we rejoice in their testimonies
[10:00] we're not traitors we're loyal
[10:02] we're not heady which means reckless
[10:05] we're stable
[10:06] watch people who are reckless and
[10:08] unstable right that's that's that's the
[10:11] perilous times that's the effect of the
[10:12] antichrist spirit
[10:14] we are not
[10:16] lovers of pleasures more lovers of god
[10:18] we crucify the pleasures of the world
[10:20] and we make god our pleasure
[10:22] worshiping god praying reading our
[10:24] bibles witnessing reading the bible
[10:25] listening to sermons these are all our
[10:28] greatest pleasures
[10:30] amen we don't rejoice in having a form
[10:33] of godliness we have true reverence for
[10:36] god
[10:37] and we don't quench the holy spirit we
[10:40] let the holy spirit flow praise god
[10:43] and yes we turn away
[10:45] from all those that manifest
[10:48] the perilous spirits of the antichrist
[10:51] we turn away from them praise god we
[10:53] would rather be a small but holy group
[10:56] praise god amen then a large
[10:58] uh richard increased with good uh brood
[11:01] of satan bruno vipers right we thought
[11:04] we'd rather be a small little group of
[11:06] of doves right than a bunch of snakes in
[11:08] the grass amen hallelujah praise god
[11:11] amen thank god that's what we're living
[11:13] for church we're living a separated life
[11:16] we're living
[11:17] uh to manifest the love of jesus christ
[11:20] to a world that's lost and dying amen
[11:23] they should be able to look at our lives
[11:25] and see the real love of god in our
[11:26] lives hallelujah
[11:29] now i mean i started making a video
[11:31] about this today i was going to preach
[11:32] this on sunday but i didn't get to it
[11:34] i was going to bring it in because the
[11:36] apostle talks about the last times right
[11:39] he's in the last last times perilous
[11:41] times will come fierce dangerous times
[11:43] to come well that's just one of at least
[11:46] 14
[11:47] signs of the end times
[11:49] okay so bear with me i'd like to preach
[11:51] these a little bit
[11:53] and i wrote about this in chapter 12 of
[11:55] my book
[11:56] from last year
[11:58] so the first two
[12:00] conditions are that sinners are unaware
[12:02] of the rapture
[12:04] right they're living like they have they
[12:05] only have one life but we don't live
[12:08] that way
[12:09] if we don't experience good things in
[12:10] this life that's okay because we've
[12:11] definitely got a better life coming amen
[12:14] hallelujah
[12:17] i'm not worried about a mansion here i
[12:18] want to make sure i live in the mansion
[12:20] with jesus over there praise god
[12:22] i'm not going to labor for a mansion
[12:24] here because i know jesus is preparing
[12:25] one for me praise god
[12:28] but they're unaware of his coming but we
[12:30] are very aware
[12:31] we live every day aware that this could
[12:33] be the day jesus could come this could
[12:36] be the year where it all finishes up so
[12:38] i want to make sure this year is a year
[12:40] that i dedicate to christ hallelujah
[12:42] amen
[12:44] second they will have a mantra or
[12:46] they're saying will be peace and safety
[12:50] right whereas god is saying the opposite
[12:52] god is saying tribulation
[12:54] and death and wrath that's what god is
[12:56] thinking
[12:58] right
[13:00] so they're saying oh jesus ain't going
[13:01] to come and there's no such thing as
[13:03] jesus oh it's just a fairy tale there's
[13:05] no tribulation they say we need peace
[13:07] and we need safety now we're supposed to
[13:09] pray for peace the bible says that paul
[13:11] says that that we can spread the gospel
[13:15] but their peace and safety is a peace
[13:17] and safety without jesus christ that's
[13:20] the peace and safety they want or in
[13:22] other words a peace and safety where
[13:23] well jesus is the same as buddha right
[13:25] or jesus is the same as uh he's just a
[13:28] prophet just like muhammad right
[13:30] so they want a unity of religions but
[13:32] jesus never had that unity he said i am
[13:34] the way the truth and the life praise
[13:36] god
[13:37] now you remember this from a few weeks
[13:39] ago
[13:40] what was the name of this beast now i've
[13:42] heard they've taken it down since i
[13:44] don't know but i've just heard youtube
[13:46] videos but i don't know i don't live in
[13:47] new york
[13:48] but this was a statue they put up in
[13:50] december in new york at the headquarters
[13:53] of the united nations what's the name of
[13:54] this the guardian for what peace and
[13:57] security
[13:58] peace and safety
[14:01] right
[14:02] they have a beast
[14:04] for peace and safety now some people
[14:06] have said it's taken down i don't know
[14:08] it's a combination remember of two
[14:10] scriptures uh daniel chapter 7 and
[14:13] revelation 13.
[14:16] and it reminds us of the beast
[14:18] which is the antichrist spirit praise
[14:21] god it was in babylon the means of
[14:23] persians and the grecians and then rome
[14:26] so in other words this is a symbol of
[14:28] the evil roman antichrist spirit which
[14:31] is basically the antichrist spirit
[14:32] that's going to try to rule the world
[14:34] with a one world religion and one world
[14:35] government right
[14:36] so we see this is and the very name of
[14:39] it
[14:40] points to the mantra that the whole
[14:42] world is going to have peace and safety
[14:45] peace and safety is that right
[14:47] praise god now that's that's one that's
[14:50] the second one
[14:52] okay so let's get down to these 14 okay
[14:55] the third one is their scoffers mocking
[14:58] jesus's second coming now you see that
[15:00] especially with atheists right atheists
[15:02] love to mock christians they mock them
[15:04] about the bible they mock them about oh
[15:06] you believe a whale swallow jonah and
[15:08] you see that last year a whale smiled a
[15:10] man and spit him up did you see that
[15:12] that was awesome it was right off of
[15:13] maine the coast of maine a whale
[15:15] swallowed a man he lived but then he got
[15:17] vomited up
[15:18] see god is not gonna let there be any
[15:20] doubt praise god that the bible's true
[15:22] hallelujah he's gonna prove it to all
[15:24] the scoffers hallelujah
[15:26] they have to recognize it
[15:28] third
[15:30] the conditions of noah's time will be
[15:31] repeated that's in luke 17 jesus christ
[15:34] himself said as it was the days of noah
[15:37] so will it be in this day there'll be
[15:39] violence uh just uncontrolled violence
[15:42] lust-based marriages people get married
[15:44] not because they love the person's
[15:46] character but they just they love their
[15:48] physical appearance right
[15:49] but christians get married of course by
[15:51] character amen of course they want to be
[15:53] attracted to their spouse you know
[15:55] but the main thing is christian
[15:57] character because the only marriage the
[15:59] bible forbids is a christian with a
[16:00] non-christian
[16:02] amen
[16:03] as we said on sunday
[16:06] and then
[16:07] jesus also said they'll have continually
[16:09] evil thoughts all they can think about
[16:11] all they can tweet about all they can
[16:14] talk about is evil
[16:16] right only evil all the time
[16:20] uh sorry uh third fourth fifth
[16:23] also sodomite conditions will be
[16:25] repeated jesus said what was sodom sodom
[16:28] was feeling with males who were
[16:30] homosexual they were in gangs and they
[16:32] would uh use gang attacks to hurt men
[16:36] and i'm just kind of saying it very
[16:37] broadly
[16:38] that's how bad it was and nobody stopped
[16:40] them the government didn't stop them
[16:43] they just ruled they ruled the city with
[16:45] their
[16:46] sodomite acts
[16:48] and jesus said as it was the days of
[16:50] sodom so will be in this day
[16:52] oh you know what's interesting on that
[16:53] church today i was at uh target and i
[16:56] ran into a former student of mine
[16:59] and he said hey mr smith i'm like who is
[17:01] this
[17:03] he said i'm so-and-so i was in your
[17:05] third grade class
[17:06] and it was a boy
[17:08] but he's transitioning in a transgender
[17:10] to a woman
[17:12] and his badge said
[17:13] a girl's name instead of his name
[17:17] and and then he had like makeup on and
[17:19] girl's hair and i'm like oh how you
[17:21] doing he's like oh you were always one
[17:23] of my favorite teachers he said i was
[17:24] battling a lot of anger that year but
[17:26] you were really patient and kind with me
[17:28] and you listen to me and talk with me
[17:29] and he was he got suspended that year
[17:31] for giving a death threat in third grade
[17:33] to another kid
[17:36] but uh he said are you a principal now i
[17:39] said no i said i said i have a degree
[17:41] but i realize i don't want that to be if
[17:43] you're a principal that's your whole
[17:44] life i don't want all the stress
[17:46] and i said i want a life and i want to
[17:48] preach also as well
[17:50] and i just so happened i had one more
[17:52] card in my uh in my wall and i gave my
[17:54] card i said please
[17:56] text me email me
[17:57] and i can pray for you if you have any
[17:59] prayer requests please let me know and
[18:00] it has both my books on there front and
[18:02] back
[18:03] and then he had to get back to work but
[18:04] he was talking like a girl but he was a
[18:06] he's a man he's a man
[18:08] but i just thought what a divine
[18:10] uh what a divine meaning
[18:13] and uh i'm gonna pray for him let's pray
[18:15] i'm gonna pray for him at the closest
[18:16] service i actually forgot to write his
[18:18] his name down there
[18:23] now church if you told me when he was in
[18:24] third grade that he returned to a woman
[18:26] i said you're crazy there had been no
[18:28] such thing without just well that was a
[18:30] 2009 because that's when obama became
[18:32] president i remember that year
[18:33] distinctly
[18:35] if you would have told me that all those
[18:36] uh you know when i was 12 11 12 13 years
[18:40] ago i said no way there's no way that
[18:42] would ever happen in america but see
[18:44] we're seeing these we're seeing these
[18:45] conditions here it is we're seeing these
[18:47] conditions manifest
[18:50] right
[18:51] but our power of prayer is is greater
[18:55] than the sins of the world it all
[18:56] depends on god's predestination praise
[18:58] god but see how you see that church see
[19:01] how no matter the littlest kindness you
[19:02] do people remember it
[19:04] that was 13 years ago he still remembers
[19:07] what i teach and i could i couldn't
[19:08] recognize him
[19:09] right i didn't go see him he come saw me
[19:12] so see god
[19:14] god is using you because i said like
[19:15] this god is using you more than you know
[19:17] praise god
[19:19] and people are going to come up and say
[19:21] you know that's what brother man says in
[19:22] heaven people are going to come up and
[19:23] say
[19:25] oh thank you for living such a godly
[19:26] life you are a witness here there and
[19:28] church in other words your influence is
[19:30] going to impact more than what you think
[19:32] praise god so just keep living for jesus
[19:34] praise god amen hallelujah i was just
[19:36] encouraged by that so be encouraged
[19:38] church that god will have give you
[19:39] divine meetings praise god we never know
[19:41] what's going to happen like someday
[19:43] somebody might walk into a burger king
[19:44] and they're going to come get saved
[19:47] because that's how austin got saved
[19:48] coming to a burger king and benjamin and
[19:50] come to church and baptize him in the
[19:52] name of the lord jesus praise god you
[19:54] never know so you always be ready praise
[19:56] god now two three four five the sixth
[19:59] one evil men and seducers will grow even
[20:02] more evil with greater deceptions
[20:03] haven't we seen that
[20:05] preachers get more sly
[20:07] they're closer to the truth but yet
[20:08] they're so far away
[20:11] so deceptions get greater so we got to
[20:14] have greater discernment praise god
[20:17] we have to be able to rightly divide the
[20:18] word of truth even more by the grace of
[20:20] god we've got to say god help me in a
[20:22] growing judgment help me to care about
[20:24] false doctrine
[20:26] praise god help me to care so i can
[20:28] discern good from evil amen that's real
[20:31] mature christianity
[20:33] when you can tell is this good or is
[20:35] this evil now you become a mature
[20:37] believer church we don't want to be
[20:38] babies praise god we don't want to we
[20:40] don't want to be baby christians sitting
[20:42] in a pew just oh nurse me mama or father
[20:45] nurse me heavenly father give me a
[20:46] bottle no we want we want real strong
[20:49] meat praise god we want steak and
[20:51] chicken for a meal praise god
[20:52] spiritually speaking praise god
[20:55] we don't want to milk diet our whole
[20:56] lives we want to grow up we don't want
[20:58] to be babies we want to be mature we
[21:00] want god to be able to trust us with
[21:01] real authority praise god
[21:03] amen i had a man email me this week and
[21:05] said pray for me that god will
[21:09] give me more demonstration in my life i
[21:10] said it's going to take more sacrifice
[21:12] you better be praying ready to be
[21:14] sacrifice your time sacrifice your
[21:16] energy
[21:17] if god's gonna use anybody it's somebody
[21:19] who's fully surrendered praise god
[21:21] someone who's sincere about the gospel
[21:23] someone who wants to grow up and be a
[21:24] real mature believer praise god
[21:26] amen
[21:28] so it's two three four five six i always
[21:30] lose count here
[21:32] seven
[21:35] many churches will commit a great
[21:36] falling waste of seven eight nine ten
[21:38] okay
[21:39] that's
[21:40] uh many churches will fall away sinners
[21:42] can't fall away from god
[21:44] only chur people that know the word and
[21:47] heard the word only they can fall away
[21:49] remember jesus said there's that second
[21:51] kind of ground on the stony ground he
[21:53] said they believe for a while but then
[21:54] they fall away in times of persecution
[21:58] that's what we have today many message
[21:59] churches falling away from the message
[22:01] when the time of persecution or the time
[22:04] of accusation comes praise god
[22:08] eight few people have genuine faith
[22:11] expressed through regular prayer now
[22:12] this is where we really need to pick up
[22:13] our lives right
[22:15] right that's where we all we all need to
[22:16] pick up our life here
[22:17] jesus said we're coming to a time when
[22:19] he said will i find faith on the earth
[22:22] when i return
[22:23] and the context is a woman who's praying
[22:26] and knocking saying god open the door of
[22:28] revelation to me god answer my prayer we
[22:30] can't give up when god doesn't answer
[22:33] we can't give up after a week you can't
[22:34] give up after a year you girls you can't
[22:37] you know now you can't give up after
[22:38] five years amen i didn't hear you praise
[22:41] god you don't give up praise god you
[22:43] keep praying you keep asking you stay
[22:45] faithful because you know god is
[22:46] faithful
[22:47] amen
[22:49] now we've seen in 2020
[22:51] jesus said pestilence is in earthquakes
[22:54] and wars will increase
[22:56] as sorrows of the tribulation
[22:59] okay or sorrows before the tribulation
[23:01] rather so now we know chrono coronavirus
[23:04] swine flu and now do you see some of
[23:06] these states they're starting to
[23:07] lose uh their their mandates well i
[23:10] imagine a few years or maybe next year
[23:12] they're going to send another man-made
[23:13] flu around right
[23:15] they'll probably do that again maybe a
[23:16] little more serious but don't but don't
[23:18] fret the bible never tells us to worry
[23:20] the bible says be anxious for nothing
[23:23] praise god
[23:24] for nothing don't be anxious for
[23:26] anything just the bible says watch and
[23:28] pray cast all your burns on the lord
[23:31] because he cares for you
[23:33] amen
[23:34] hallelujah so now we're we should be
[23:37] strong soldiers now we should know okay
[23:40] pestilences are going to come there's
[23:41] going to be more flus that are going to
[23:42] come
[23:43] there's going to be more earthquakes
[23:45] there's going to be more rumors of wars
[23:46] that's why we're not shaking i told
[23:48] somebody i'm not shaking about russia
[23:49] and ukraine and u.s we're not shaking
[23:51] about that are we concerned yes should
[23:52] we pray yes but that doesn't shake us
[23:55] because that's exactly what jesus said
[23:57] wars and rumors of wars we should expect
[24:00] that and we should pray for peace we
[24:02] shouldn't be shaken by every little
[24:03] thing we should be solid same believers
[24:06] where we can't get shaken but we're
[24:08] standing on the rock of ages where we
[24:10] have a firm foundation satan can't move
[24:12] us we know where we stand
[24:15] amen
[24:18] ten here's where now here's where we're
[24:20] getting into our text right
[24:22] the tenth sign is what we read for our
[24:24] text they'll love themselves
[24:27] more than god right
[24:28] they won't have natural affection all
[24:30] these things we read this okay that's
[24:32] 10th so 11th
[24:35] the new testament gospel will have been
[24:36] preached to all the world now satan
[24:38] thought he used coronavirus to stop the
[24:40] preachers
[24:41] but god's going to find a way to do it
[24:43] anyway
[24:44] we went to voice of god years ago and
[24:46] they said there's many more languages
[24:48] that need the message in their language
[24:51] if that's the case and there's many
[24:52] nations and languages that haven't heard
[24:54] the real preaching
[24:55] but the bible says the gospel has to be
[24:57] preached to all the world and i'm sorry
[25:00] oh i'm not sorry i'm not sorry to say it
[25:02] but a tape preaching is not real
[25:04] preaching
[25:05] real preachers have feet the bible said
[25:08] to go preach the gospel praise god
[25:10] hallelujah so we need to pray that god
[25:13] as we and we've been praying this austin
[25:14] we've been lena we've been praying this
[25:16] that god will open up the traveling
[25:18] restrictions so
[25:19] uh evangelists and missionaries can go
[25:21] back out and and win souls for the
[25:22] kingdom of god
[25:23] like simon i think he's made five trips
[25:25] to thailand
[25:26] trying to start churches he almost had
[25:28] one started but then the enemy come in
[25:30] and and uh kind of caused the pastor to
[25:32] leave the message but he almost had one
[25:34] by god's grace we were rejoicing but
[25:36] then the man fell away because he must
[25:38] have loved the world more than he loved
[25:39] the things of god
[25:41] but see church every nation
[25:44] uh will have the gospel preached to them
[25:47] that's another sign we're looking for
[25:50] so we hear things from missionaries like
[25:52] oh did you hear that brother austin the
[25:54] missionary said oh yeah ty ev everybody
[25:55] in thailand's heard the word
[25:57] right oh everybody's in china has heard
[25:59] the word
[26:00] it seems like the gospel it seems like
[26:02] the whole world's heard the gospel well
[26:04] then we'll know we're getting closer
[26:07] or maybe it's through the internet you
[26:08] know maybe it's internet though he'll pr
[26:09] they'll hear preaching through the
[26:11] internet okay
[26:15] here's the last ones here here's uh 14
[26:18] 13 12.
[26:19] i'm going to look at this one here a
[26:20] little bit here
[26:23] another way we'll know the rapture is
[26:24] coming is when we see the false churches
[26:26] uniting with united states politicians
[26:30] to create new laws to stop our church
[26:33] and churches like us that's how we'll
[26:35] know we're getting really close
[26:37] because that's what revelation
[26:39] uh
[26:40] 13 16 says
[26:43] he's going to cause all
[26:45] to take a mark in other words he's going
[26:46] to force he's going to lock down
[26:47] everybody
[26:49] right they're going to lock down their
[26:50] money they're going to lock down
[26:51] everything he's gonna cause all
[26:53] to try to worship the beast
[26:57] okay
[26:58] that's call and then they're gonna have
[26:59] to unite in order for those churches to
[27:01] stay open they're gonna have to unite in
[27:03] an ecumenical move church this is
[27:05] apostolic doctrine
[27:07] this is doctrine from the apostle paul
[27:09] this is important praise god amen
[27:12] these are the signs that he's coming
[27:14] praise god aren't you glad you can see
[27:15] the signs hallelujah amen
[27:18] psalm 27 5 says in the time of trouble
[27:21] he shall hide me in his pavilion praise
[27:23] god
[27:25] god's going to hide us in the times of
[27:26] trouble
[27:27] from the wrath of god
[27:29] and revelation 3 10 says i'm going to
[27:31] keep them from the our temptation
[27:33] that'll come upon the whole world
[27:35] okay the 13th sign is israelis will be
[27:38] physically returning to live in the holy
[27:40] land i've seen numerous articles about
[27:42] this over the last 10 or 15 years
[27:45] and they're going to seek to rebuild a
[27:46] temple revelation 11 says it they have
[27:49] to rebuild a temple we don't know if the
[27:51] temple is going to be before the rapture
[27:53] or after we don't know but it is a sign
[27:55] of israel returning and them wanting to
[27:57] rebuild the temple
[27:59] and 14th now there could be more church
[28:01] there could be 15 there could be 20
[28:03] there could be 30 signs that that were
[28:06] at the end time but i just made a short
[28:08] quick list to put in the book
[28:10] regular churches will be in a laodicean
[28:12] lukewarm condition there will be more
[28:14] concern with riches and goods having no
[28:17] more need of truth
[28:19] and unwilling to repent church you you
[28:22] and i got to get in the habit of saying
[28:23] lord i'm coming here for more word
[28:25] tonight
[28:26] i'm coming here to become a better
[28:28] christian praise god ah lord feed me
[28:30] with something that will inspire me
[28:32] praise god
[28:33] give me something that's fresh from the
[28:35] throne of god amen how many want
[28:36] something fresh from the throne of god
[28:38] amen
[28:39] that should be our desire
[28:41] now
[28:42] i believe we're still waiting here's the
[28:44] checks at the bottom i believe we're
[28:46] still waiting for the fourth vision to
[28:47] come to pass now some people think we're
[28:49] already here waiting for the seventh
[28:53] i personally believe we're still waiting
[28:54] for the fourth because i was looking up
[28:56] driverless cars today
[28:58] uh
[28:59] and the in the vision brother branham
[29:01] said
[29:02] uh they had no steering wheel
[29:06] and they were pla and a family was
[29:08] playing some sort of game to amuse
[29:10] themselves
[29:12] okay it was a plastic car a bubble
[29:15] topped car that was running down
[29:16] beautiful highways under remote control
[29:20] so i uh so i'm sorry i should have
[29:21] showed the quote i didn't show the quote
[29:23] so this is this is the fourth vision
[29:24] brother branham had
[29:27] okay so it's a vision of plastic bubble
[29:29] top car remote control
[29:31] a family was seated in the car and
[29:33] they're playing some sort of a game to
[29:35] amuse themselves
[29:36] i was driving down the road today and it
[29:38] was pretty bumpy it's going to be pretty
[29:39] hard to play a game in a bumpy car as
[29:42] ours yes so i i personally think this
[29:44] vision is not yet fulfilled i personally
[29:46] think we need better highways
[29:48] and the highways got to be connected to
[29:50] the cars but of course many people
[29:52] disagree with me but that's fine
[29:55] i still believe
[29:56] uh
[29:57] that one's not fulfilled because the
[29:59] vision showed this and we haven't seen
[30:01] it remember church
[30:03] these three were so plain nobody could
[30:05] deny them brother brown had these
[30:06] visions they were so plain nobody could
[30:08] deny
[30:09] fascism right nobody could deny
[30:11] mussolini uh hitler and stalin nobody
[30:14] could deny that
[30:16] but see we have some questions here
[30:17] where it's not the reality is not lining
[30:20] up to the vision right
[30:23] just like here brother branham said
[30:24] let's look at the fifth vision the fifth
[30:27] vision
[30:28] uh showed women they cut their hair we
[30:30] see that now
[30:31] he says but they went into a state of
[30:33] undress
[30:35] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[30:36] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[30:39] apron on so brother adam said it's got
[30:41] to get to a spot where the whole world
[30:42] becomes a state of undress
[30:45] and the last one is a woman who only has
[30:48] a little fig leaf apron on austin
[30:52] i don't know i feel like we could be on
[30:54] on woman rising power because this this
[30:57] this came true like last year like the
[30:59] year before there's a thing called only
[31:00] fans now like
[31:01] every single woman i've ever met has the
[31:04] only fans is basically where you just
[31:06] post pornography of themselves and men
[31:08] buy it like like every
[31:11] i say like 70 of women that you meet out
[31:14] in the world has you probably
[31:31] why don't you have an only parent to get
[31:32] that money like that's what they say
[31:35] everything is crazy and then
[31:37] then he says something about
[31:39] women rising to power right yeah that's
[31:41] the next one
[31:42] yeah
[31:43] now that part though didn't get it in
[31:45] the division here but yeah he says in
[31:47] other quotes
[31:51] the day kamala harris became the vice
[31:54] president she was wearing her
[31:56] butt
[31:56] so that there's talks about joe biden
[31:58] stepping down and commodity coming to
[32:00] president
[32:01] right right that happens
[32:04] because you know he's mentally incapable
[32:06] right now oh sure sure so like if he
[32:08] steps down and she becomes president and
[32:10] she was wearing purple
[32:25] yeah that's and brother a lot of
[32:26] preachers think that right but
[32:28] when i look at the visions like i said
[32:30] when i look at those
[32:32] i mean it's totally undeniable
[32:34] the words of the vision every literal
[32:37] word detail came to pass
[32:39] so
[32:40] yeah some people believe that some
[32:41] preachers believe yeah they believe like
[32:44] it's past it's overdue no i don't
[32:45] believe that because i believe
[32:47] i believe the rap should be right on
[32:48] time i don't believe it's going to be
[32:49] past due i believe it's going to be
[32:50] right on time because god's still saving
[32:52] souls and there are nations that haven't
[32:54] heard the word
[32:55] so yeah at the when i made this video
[32:57] today i said i could be wrong on it i
[32:59] could be wrong so i always want to be
[33:00] humble like that
[33:01] i could be wrong but here's why i you
[33:03] know with the fifth one
[33:06] um i just really feel like you know this
[33:08] last part here we haven't seen that now
[33:11] i haven't seen it
[33:13] uh it's got to be a state of undress the
[33:15] whole world will be in a state of
[33:16] undress okay so that's why that one i'm
[33:19] a little hesitant on now the sixth one i
[33:20] made a video about this one brother uh
[33:22] this vision look
[33:26] i know first of all i don't think kamala
[33:27] harris is beautiful
[33:28] a lot of men don't like it's split like
[33:30] 50 50.
[33:31] she held the people in a complete power
[33:33] biden and harris do not have complete
[33:35] power
[33:37] the supreme court have shot down almost
[33:39] every illegal thing that they've done
[33:42] so the vision showed complete power to a
[33:44] woman
[33:46] brother bram said i believe it was the
[33:47] catholic church though i knew it could
[33:48] possibly be a vision of some woman
[33:49] rising great power due to a popular vote
[33:51] so the nation hasn't bowed to kamala i
[33:53] haven't
[33:55] so you don't have complete power
[33:57] i don't think she's beautiful
[33:58] um
[34:00] i believe it's the roman catholic church
[34:01] but i could be wrong so i'm leaving that
[34:03] open all the time believe that but
[34:05] remember those first three were
[34:06] absolutely
[34:08] precisely fulfilled to the letter
[34:11] so that's why you know i'm just waiting
[34:13] on that okay and then consider what all
[34:16] with
[34:16] with those 14 other signs like all these
[34:18] nations still need to hear the word of
[34:20] god that's why i believe
[34:22] kind of where we're at right now so yeah
[34:24] but keep your convictions about you
[34:25] that's what you want to do brother ram
[34:27] said i don't want people that don't have
[34:29] their own convictions he said we'd just
[34:30] be a bunch of pushovers
[34:33] he said so don't be a pushover he said i
[34:34] respect somebody that differs with me
[34:38] yeah and like i said i could be wrong
[34:40] but yeah that's okay
[34:41] the seventh one
[34:43] i saw the most terrible explosion
[34:45] i turned and saw nothing in america but
[34:47] debris craters and smoke all over
[34:50] so see i believe the first three were so
[34:52] precise that the last four must be
[34:54] equally precise
[34:57] and here's another reason the preachers
[34:59] that i know that say you know we're
[35:01] waiting only for the last one they are
[35:03] really children in their doctrine like
[35:06] they believe god wants to heal all the
[35:07] time and if you don't get healed it's
[35:08] your fault
[35:11] and to me that's that's just wrong
[35:13] and they don't some of them don't
[35:14] believe in fasting
[35:16] some of them don't believe in healthy
[35:18] living
[35:19] i mean it's so sad the way people
[35:22] uh stand or the way preachers act so
[35:24] that's why if i look at all these
[35:26] details you know i put them on a scale
[35:28] spiritually and i pray i think
[35:31] all these things and i say well i don't
[35:32] think they're fulfilled
[35:34] and
[35:35] and now but let's say time goes on
[35:38] let's say time goes on and we do get
[35:40] beautiful highways that are remote
[35:42] control with magnets and everything
[35:44] and then who's right
[35:46] and who's wrong they're wrong and i'm
[35:48] right but i don't mind if i'm wrong i
[35:50] mean if the lord comes i'm ready because
[35:51] i got the holy ghost
[35:53] i got the holy ghost god i'm ready to go
[35:55] praise god
[35:57] but for my few years or my 20-some years
[36:00] of being in the message i've seen
[36:01] most people guess and they're trying to
[36:03] be prophets guessing the coming lord but
[36:05] then they look foolish when it doesn't
[36:06] come to pass
[36:08] i don't know bro i couldn't i could
[36:09] probably tell i could probably tell you
[36:10] five preachers maybe 10 that have said
[36:13] this they thought this was year of the
[36:14] coming and every year it comes and goes
[36:17] and they just they get people's hopes up
[36:20] right it's a false hope
[36:22] okay and they get them focused on other
[36:24] things rather than the gospel rather
[36:26] than living holy and understanding more
[36:28] about the word of god
[36:30] all right just trying to get them to be
[36:31] fearful about the coming lord rather
[36:33] than loving the coming of the lord
[36:35] so i'm going to be so in love with jesus
[36:36] that no matter what happens i'm ready to
[36:38] go because i'm i'm i'm i'm in love with
[36:41] him i'm not predicting or anything like
[36:42] that i'm just so in love with him he's
[36:44] all my focus and i'm ready to go when he
[36:46] calls praise god
[36:48] i don't want to get people guessing and
[36:49] things like that so it's just to me
[36:50] that's that's i guess i'm saying brother
[36:52] that's hurt that's hurt me over the
[36:53] years when i've seen people i've
[36:54] respected make guesses
[36:57] and
[36:58] i know they're not living right
[37:00] i know they're not really growing and
[37:02] understanding
[37:03] you know of the of the message okay so i
[37:05] hope that's a
[37:07] so here's where brother man says i
[37:08] believe according to revelation 13 16
[37:10] that the bride will have to stop
[37:12] preaching for the beast is demanding the
[37:14] mark in the hand or the forehead if
[37:16] permission to preach be granted
[37:19] domination or sorry denominations will
[37:21] take the mark or be forced to quit
[37:22] preaching then the lamb will come for
[37:23] his bride and judge the great harlot so
[37:26] that's why i believe we're going to have
[37:27] to have a time of squeeze where they're
[37:28] going to for they're going to close our
[37:29] doors
[37:30] any church we're already registered with
[37:33] green ohio see that thing i got hanging
[37:34] out in there in the fellowship we're
[37:35] already registered they know we're a
[37:37] church i don't know if they know what we
[37:38] believe but we're registered okay
[37:42] brother madam said that only the very
[37:44] elect will not be fooled the temptation
[37:46] will come as follows the ecumenical move
[37:49] that was started on what seems like such
[37:50] a beautiful and blessed principle
[37:52] fulfilling christ's prayer that we all
[37:54] might be one becomes so strong
[37:56] politically that she bears pressure upon
[37:57] the government to cause all to join with
[38:00] her either directly or through adherence
[38:01] to principles enacted the law so that no
[38:04] people will be recognized
[38:06] as actual churches unless under direct
[38:08] or indirect domination of this council
[38:11] little groups will lose charters
[38:12] privileges etc until they lose all
[38:14] property and spiritual rights with the
[38:16] people
[38:18] okay so that's a little review is that
[38:20] review okay i just want to review that
[38:21] real quick i want to show you that
[38:23] there's at least 14 signs
[38:25] that were that were closer to the coming
[38:27] of the lord but i'll say like this
[38:29] brother just like brother brahm said he
[38:31] said it may be a hundred years he said
[38:32] it may be tomorrow
[38:34] right all these things could happen like
[38:36] that just like jesus's crucifixion they
[38:38] all happen within a matter of a few days
[38:40] right
[38:41] as soon as he was arrested he was put on
[38:43] trial that fulfills
[38:44] the passover he was a passover lamb and
[38:47] friday saturday sunday my goodness uh 50
[38:50] or 60 prophecies all fulfilled in the
[38:52] matter of three days that's why we got
[38:53] to be ready all the time whether it's
[38:55] church day or not we've got to be
[38:56] seeking god's faith we face we've got to
[38:58] be ready for us coming we must watch and
[39:00] pray amen
[39:02] amen now go to back to second timothy 3
[39:04] praise god second timothy 3.
[39:20] now
[39:20] paul
[39:21] said in verse 10 we read verse 10 right
[39:24] what was the difference between the the
[39:26] the perilous people and paul his
[39:28] doctrine his manner of life
[39:32] now go down to verse 14. now verse 13 is
[39:34] where he prophesied evil men would get
[39:37] worse and worse look at verse 14. but
[39:39] continue in the things that which thou
[39:42] hast learned and has been assured of
[39:44] knowing of whom thou hast learn them
[39:47] see continue in the doctrine right
[39:49] and that from a child thou hast known
[39:51] the holy scriptures which are able to
[39:52] make the wise and the salvation through
[39:54] faith which is in christ jesus so church
[39:57] don't ever stop reading your bible read
[39:59] your bible every day and the church said
[40:02] what makes you wise to be saved what's
[40:04] going to make you wise to escape the
[40:06] tribulation the word of god the holy
[40:08] scriptures amen and like i said you can
[40:10] read in the old testament about ruth you
[40:12] can read about esther and that can give
[40:14] you encouragement and that will help you
[40:16] to be ready for the rapture praise god
[40:19] all these are beautiful types speaking
[40:21] of our day praise god
[40:23] it's a beautiful
[40:24] beautiful type verse 16. all scripture
[40:27] is given by inspiration of god and is
[40:29] profitable for what for doctrine
[40:32] all scripture can be used for teaching
[40:34] for reproof for correction for
[40:36] instruction and righteousness that the
[40:38] man of god may be perfect thoroughly
[40:40] furnished unto all good works
[40:45] praise god how many want to go tomorrow
[40:46] and do good works for god
[40:48] you know what's going to help you the
[40:50] word of god is
[40:51] amen the holy scriptures are going to
[40:53] help you
[40:54] and it doesn't matter which scripture it
[40:56] is amen i could preach out of nahum
[40:58] tonight praise god i could preach out a
[41:00] song of solomon and that should prepare
[41:02] you to do good works tomorrow amen
[41:05] because all scripture
[41:07] is profitable for good works and also
[41:10] for salvation amen
[41:14] now go to chapter
[41:16] four second timothy chapter four verse
[41:17] one i charge you therefore
[41:19] this is his last letter before he was
[41:21] killed and his head cut off
[41:23] i charge you i give you a command before
[41:26] god and the lord jesus christ he shall
[41:27] judge the quick and the dead and his
[41:29] appearing in his kingdom preach the word
[41:32] why did he say read my epistles right
[41:35] because god loves real preachers
[41:37] preach the word be instant in season out
[41:39] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[41:42] longsuffering and what
[41:44] doctrine
[41:46] so correct the people rebuke the people
[41:48] right help the people strengthen the
[41:50] people be long-suffering
[41:52] suffer with the people and give them
[41:54] sound doctrine
[41:56] for the time will come in verse 3 when
[41:58] they will not endure they won't bear
[42:00] sound doctrine
[42:03] church is everybody catching all the
[42:04] doctrine these last two chapters
[42:06] doctrine doctrine doctrine doctrine
[42:08] doctrine it's all through it what is
[42:10] going to separate the true from the
[42:11] false it's their sound apostles doctrine
[42:14] praise god doctrine is going to make
[42:16] your home holy praise god amen
[42:19] doctrine is going to make you do good
[42:20] works tomorrow praise god doctrine's
[42:22] going to make you save amen doctrine is
[42:24] going to help you go in the rapture
[42:26] praise god
[42:27] doctrine is what separates you doctrine
[42:29] is going to lead you to the right church
[42:31] hallelujah amen
[42:33] because the false churches have false
[42:35] teachers that don't preach sound
[42:36] doctrine
[42:39] but after their own lust shall they heap
[42:40] to themselves teachers having itching
[42:43] ears
[42:44] and they shall turn away their ears from
[42:46] the truth and shall and be turned unto
[42:49] fables so tell them stories lies
[42:52] verse 5 but watch thou in all things in
[42:55] endure afflictions
[42:57] do the work of the evangelists make full
[42:59] proof of thy ministry
[43:01] okay so the scripture endure they will
[43:03] not sustain sound doctrine so that's how
[43:06] you know you're in a false church right
[43:08] or a church that's uh led by the devil
[43:11] they will not keep up sound teaching so
[43:14] in other words they'll compromise on
[43:15] homosexuality right like we've seen last
[43:17] few years or they'll compromise on the
[43:19] importance of divine healing right or
[43:21] their compromise on what it means to
[43:23] have the holy ghost like churches they
[43:25] say if you believe brother bran was a
[43:26] prophet you have the holy ghost that's a
[43:28] lie
[43:29] that's a church that won't endure sound
[43:31] doctrine
[43:32] because the bible doesn't say that you
[43:33] could believe in peter all you want but
[43:35] just believing in peter don't give you
[43:36] the holy ghost right jesus christ is the
[43:39] same yesterday today and forever praise
[43:41] god
[43:41] on the day of pentecost you couldn't be
[43:43] filled with the holy ghost bible even
[43:45] peter was a prophet you had to meet
[43:47] jesus christ you had to repent and be
[43:49] baptized and you shall be filled with
[43:50] the holy ghost praise god
[43:52] so never accept a false doctrine never
[43:55] ex never accept a false gospel our
[43:58] gospel should be pure bible pure truth
[44:01] pure holy ghost and pure revelation of
[44:04] the word of god amen
[44:06] hallelujah
[44:07] our church must sustain we must hold up
[44:10] sound doctrine
[44:12] because many churches won't
[44:14] and we've got to be the example we have
[44:16] to be an example church although small
[44:18] we have to be an example church
[44:20] and what the brothers say the brother
[44:21] said in that email we're a city on a
[44:23] hill that can't be hidden or even our
[44:25] little tiny church
[44:27] so much so that a man in england can get
[44:28] online and say i noticed something
[44:30] different about your church compared to
[44:31] other churches
[44:33] so it's not in the number it's in the
[44:35] quality of the holy spirit
[44:37] amen hallelujah like i told that man the
[44:40] other day
[44:42] we had a sister visit
[44:44] her church has 300 people in it and she
[44:46] never she doesn't feel the love of god
[44:48] she comes to our church where there's 30
[44:49] or 20 and she feels the love of god
[44:52] so where is the holy spirit the holy
[44:54] spirit is where people are sincere and
[44:56] they're growing as christians and they
[44:58] want more love of god and they want
[45:00] sound doctrine and their preachers and
[45:02] their pastor bears and upholds and
[45:05] endures sound doctrine praise god amen
[45:09] and church i know the church that that
[45:10] woman's from and they don't have a lot
[45:12] of strong doctrine
[45:15] like they're the church i was telling
[45:16] you they believe a baby can get the
[45:17] baptism of the holy ghost in its womb
[45:19] like john the baptist
[45:21] but they're so they're so unsound in
[45:23] doctrine
[45:24] see
[45:25] they're just unsound there's many other
[45:27] examples i forget now i used to know
[45:29] more of them but i'm not in touch with
[45:30] that church anymore but that's just one
[45:32] of them
[45:33] they don't have the understanding to get
[45:34] the holy ghost you got to repent first
[45:37] just like peter said
[45:41] and let me remind my teenagers let me
[45:43] talk to you before after the service
[45:45] okay because there's something about
[45:46] that we need to talk about okay
[45:50] yeah this week we need to talk about
[45:52] this week okay
[45:53] all right so
[45:55] everybody see that by god's grace
[45:59] so what does he tell what's his last
[46:01] words to a preacher preach the word
[46:04] preach sound doctrine don't compromise
[46:06] because the time is going to come where
[46:08] people will not be able to be taught
[46:10] how to live a godly life
[46:15] now church think about that what could
[46:17] the holy spirit teach you tonight that
[46:18] you need to learn how to do now don't
[46:20] raise your hands but how many say have a
[46:21] better prayer life don't raise your
[46:23] hands
[46:24] i'm going to say love your enemies you
[46:26] have to raise your hand
[46:27] see if we can start naming some things
[46:29] that we can learn from the holy spirit
[46:31] tonight how about fasting you have to
[46:32] raise your hand
[46:34] right
[46:37] how about overcoming evil with good how
[46:39] about how about answering a harsh word
[46:42] with a soft tone
[46:45] how about having a good thought life
[46:47] and not not uh fearing and not worrying
[46:49] and not being anxious and living
[46:52] stress-free praise god
[46:54] we have to raise our hands right but see
[46:56] we can all learn how to be more like
[46:58] christ how about learn how to use our
[47:00] gifts better
[47:03] whether it's word of wisdom or knowledge
[47:04] or miracles or signs or wonders or
[47:06] tongues of interpretation or
[47:08] faith who couldn't learn
[47:11] a better
[47:13] operation of the holy spirit in their
[47:15] lives i think we should all say amen to
[47:17] that don't you
[47:18] we can all learn something but we got to
[47:21] come to church seeking something to
[47:23] learn we got to come with a learner's
[47:24] attitude right as we looked at a few uh
[47:27] i think last week by god's grace
[47:29] so see our church must endure we must
[47:32] bear with me we must sustain we must
[47:34] encourage sound doctrine
[47:36] and we must we must live what we hear
[47:39] preached
[47:40] praise god
[47:41] like i give that example of austin you
[47:42] know i preached on suffering he went
[47:44] home with a headache he said thank you
[47:45] lord i can suffer
[47:47] he learned that from the sermon and then
[47:49] god healed him of that praise god
[47:51] see that that's what all of us have to
[47:52] do we have to take what we hear and go
[47:55] apply it to our lives oh yeah like uh i
[47:57] got an email this week a sister is
[47:58] reading my book somewhere she's on
[48:00] chapter 10 already can you imagine that
[48:01] that's the furthest i've heard somebody
[48:03] go with the chapter that's a lot of
[48:04] pages that's like 600 pages
[48:06] and she said i read your chapter 10 on
[48:08] the mr iniquity and she said all those
[48:10] scriptures were on my mind i went
[48:12] somewhere in public and a man just
[48:13] started talking to me about how i dress
[48:15] i was dressed holy and she said i got to
[48:17] witness to him about the mystery of
[48:18] iniquity because it was fresh on my mind
[48:20] today
[48:21] and she said i invited him to church
[48:23] hopefully he'll want to talk more about
[48:25] the word he didn't know the message she
[48:27] said hopefully he'll want to know more
[48:28] about the message
[48:29] isn't that awesome so church whenever
[48:31] you're seeking god trying to grow god
[48:33] will use that out in your life somewhere
[48:36] but but we got to be willing to grow
[48:38] praise god
[48:39] we've got to be willing and and desiring
[48:41] more of god
[48:43] reading and praying and staying in tune
[48:45] with the holy spirit praise god i have
[48:46] another testimony another brother um
[48:49] he's an older brother he's got cancer
[48:52] but he he read part of my book as well
[48:54] and he went out and uh he said where can
[48:56] i get re-baptized he lives in
[48:57] connecticut and guess what i got a good
[48:59] friend in connecticut brother craig
[49:01] booer he said can i is there a church
[49:03] nearby and craig's church is an hour and
[49:05] a half from him and he went to craig's
[49:07] church last sunday and got baptized in
[49:08] the name of lord jesus christ from
[49:10] reading my book
[49:12] so see god knows how to do it church any
[49:14] effort we have any any
[49:16] anything we do for god any work is not
[49:19] in vain in the lord
[49:21] god is long-suffering he's still trying
[49:23] to find people that want to be saved
[49:25] praise god he's still trying to find
[49:27] people that want to be baptized the
[49:29] bible said the holy spirit is circling
[49:30] the earth his eyes are going to and fro
[49:33] trying to make himself powerful on the
[49:35] behalf of those that love god
[49:38] amen praise god
[49:40] so see
[49:41] we must have long suffering how many can
[49:43] suffer a little longer
[49:45] can you suffer another year if the lord
[49:47] doesn't come
[49:48] can you do another five years another 10
[49:50] years where we all got gray hair can we
[49:52] can we handle that
[49:53] can we suffer that long can we suffer
[49:55] with one another
[49:58] that long
[49:59] i i know we can and the beautiful part
[50:01] is we'll see many testimonies along the
[50:03] way
[50:04] praise god like we've seen
[50:09] brother ram said he saw a vision and the
[50:11] holy spirit said when the vision leaves
[50:13] you read 2nd timothy 4. don't forget 2nd
[50:14] timothy 4. when the vision left me
[50:16] standing right there on 7th street a 19
[50:18] year old boy the voice of god in the
[50:20] room said ii timothy 4 that's exactly
[50:22] what it turned out to be the time will
[50:24] come when they will not endure sound
[50:26] doctrine brother branham was sent to
[50:28] help us have sound doctrine
[50:31] look what he says
[50:33] people want something the pentecostals
[50:34] want something that can pat them on the
[50:36] back see they just want to come to
[50:37] church and everybody like them
[50:40] and let them live there it is they want
[50:42] to live the way they want to
[50:45] church if you're not living right i'm
[50:46] here to rebuke you tonight by the holy
[50:48] spirit
[50:49] right just like i want to be rebuked
[50:51] when i'm not living right
[50:52] that's what the bible said rebuke
[50:54] correct exhort with all longsuffering
[50:57] and doctrine amen hallelujah because we
[50:59] all need correction at times church we
[51:01] all need it
[51:02] right
[51:04] you can't read paul's letters and not
[51:06] see that doctrine was essential for the
[51:08] believer to do a work for god how many
[51:11] are doing work for god
[51:13] it's essential to have the doctrine the
[51:15] teaching of the word of god if you're
[51:17] going to do any works for god
[51:19] amen
[51:20] he said here's what they want to do they
[51:21] want to play the piano 40 beats per
[51:24] second that's funny
[51:25] what's the maximum you can get malachi
[51:30] like eight
[51:33] is there no limit
[51:38] i guess with god all things are possible
[51:39] right
[51:40] and he says all the pentecostals want to
[51:42] do is real fast beat
[51:46] and jump up and down and dance about
[51:47] women do that way and the men the same
[51:49] way but live in sin
[51:53] see the presbyterian methodist lutheran
[51:54] baptist there's many sincere person all
[51:56] those organizations that's exactly right
[51:58] but that system has gotten them so bound
[52:00] up to they think as long as they belong
[52:02] to the church their names upon the books
[52:04] and their heaven bound your name on a
[52:06] book here on earth don't mean nothing to
[52:08] god amen
[52:11] it doesn't mean anything that you and i
[52:12] come to church here that doesn't mean
[52:14] anything because we've all known people
[52:16] that came here and fell away
[52:19] right
[52:20] what means what makes the more
[52:22] difference is that jesus christ lives
[52:24] inside your soul praise god
[52:26] that makes a difference and then you
[52:28] come here and then you're a channel
[52:29] you're a vessel that god can use
[52:32] like last week when god used naomi and
[52:34] beatrice so well for your
[52:36] your mom wasn't that powerful
[52:39] that was glorious you never know right
[52:40] that's how it is you never know when
[52:42] you're going to be called upon by god
[52:45] to do something for god
[52:47] that's a great example being ready to
[52:48] serve the lord
[52:50] did you know i was going to call upon
[52:51] you to pray i didn't either but when the
[52:53] service closed your text came to my mind
[52:55] and said your text said we all need to
[52:57] gather jose and the brothers and pray
[52:59] that text came into my mind like a
[53:00] picture i said well let me call up who's
[53:02] here
[53:03] if anybody can pray i said it's those
[53:04] women back there
[53:06] isn't that true yeah
[53:08] that's true the holy spirit brought that
[53:09] back to me i didn't have it in my nose
[53:10] you can look at the paper i didn't have
[53:11] it on there the holy spirit did that
[53:15] see because the holy spirit is
[53:16] interested in using us if we're willing
[53:19] to be used amen
[53:23] he said your name has got to be written
[53:25] in the lives book of life
[53:27] by the blood of jesus christ and know
[53:29] that your sins are forgiven
[53:33] but they want the pentecostals want that
[53:35] kind that's the kind of pastors they
[53:37] want they don't want nothing else and
[53:38] when god in the last days has shook
[53:40] every divine gift that's recommended the
[53:41] bible every gift that jesus christ
[53:43] promised every gift every sign every end
[53:46] time sign everything that was promised
[53:48] in the bible as far as i can see myself
[53:50] has already been shook before the nation
[53:51] and she plunges on toward hell as hard
[53:54] as she can go tell them they'll run on
[53:57] anyhow
[53:58] in other words brother ram saying ii
[53:59] timothy 4 is fulfilled
[54:02] they don't want sound doctrine they want
[54:05] to uh they want to dance in the church
[54:07] and then live any way they want the rest
[54:09] of the week
[54:10] but paul but paul told timothy don't you
[54:13] settle for that you preach the word amen
[54:16] and be ready because they are going to
[54:17] leave you amen the world is going to
[54:19] leave you and pretty soon you're just
[54:20] going to be left with saints hallelujah
[54:23] amen pretty soon you're just going to be
[54:25] left with sheep hallelujah or doves the
[54:27] people that really love god i feel like
[54:29] that's what we've got here praise god
[54:32] amen i really believe that
[54:34] i wouldn't say that if i didn't believe
[54:35] that
[54:36] because there was time a few years ago i
[54:38] knew we didn't have all saints here
[54:40] and i couldn't say it
[54:41] but i didn't want to say it i guess i
[54:43] could have said it
[54:47] but i really believe that everybody that
[54:49] is a faithful tithe pair here and coming
[54:51] to church i believe they're real
[54:52] children of god
[54:54] amen
[54:57] now i got about five or ten minutes so
[54:59] here let me try to find a place to close
[55:00] let's go to titus yeah let's try to
[55:02] finish in titus here
[55:04] it's right after ii timothy
[55:11] titus chapter 1 verses 8 and 9. this is
[55:14] paul writing a letter to a pastor
[55:17] named titus
[55:29] now verse 8 says
[55:31] he said now this is a bishop a bishop
[55:33] means an overseer this also means a
[55:35] pastor
[55:37] so a bishop verse 8 must be a lover of
[55:40] hospitality
[55:43] a lover of good men sober just holy
[55:47] temperant
[55:49] verse 9 a pastor must hold fast the
[55:51] faithful word as he hath been taught
[55:54] that he may be able by signs wonders and
[55:57] miracles
[55:58] did i read that right
[56:00] no
[56:02] what do you say
[56:03] a pastor does what
[56:06] by able by what sound doctrine both to
[56:08] exhort and to convince the gangsters
[56:11] hallelujah praise god
[56:15] huh how you gonna are gonna overcome all
[56:17] the gainsayers and the critics of the
[56:19] message how you can do it by sound bible
[56:22] doctrine
[56:23] that's what i found church
[56:26] the teaching brother ram gave us
[56:28] it actually rebukes all the people that
[56:31] have left the message and if they're
[56:32] watching they're spying on me come talk
[56:33] to me don't run on somebody else come
[56:35] talk to me please if you have any
[56:36] courage in your heart at all come talk
[56:38] to me if i offend you
[56:39] i don't i just don't think i said
[56:40] anything wrong
[56:43] see it's the doctrine that's what i
[56:44] found see how they're attacking they're
[56:46] attacking brother ram's character most
[56:47] of the time or his his tendency to
[56:50] forget his tendency to exaggerate
[56:52] they're attacking uh uh sometimes you
[56:54] know uh
[56:56] he he's he
[56:57] maybe wouldn't live all the way that he
[56:59] preached because he was human he made
[57:01] mistakes
[57:03] but church the majority of their
[57:05] criticisms are not about the doctrine
[57:07] the majority are just about his human
[57:09] mistakes and of course the main ones are
[57:11] prophecy they don't understand prophecy
[57:13] but the more i read the bible the more i
[57:15] see uh how brother branham was a true
[57:18] prophet and i'm going to preach more on
[57:19] that soon my god's grace because i've
[57:20] been studying on that as well
[57:22] so but how are you going to uh how is a
[57:24] preacher filled with the holy ghost
[57:26] going to keep us standing he's going to
[57:28] use sound doctrine to convince the
[57:30] church that the bible's right and the
[57:32] gangsters are wrong they're liars turn
[57:35] away from them don't believe them but
[57:37] you believe sound bible truth because
[57:39] jesus says thy word is truth amen
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:44] in other words church having the truth
[57:46] is enough
[57:48] even if we never see another miracle the
[57:50] miracle of sound doctrine would be
[57:52] enough praise god
[57:54] and that's what abraham told the rich
[57:56] man in hell the rich man said send my or
[57:59] send lazarus back to my brothers and
[58:01] that they'll see them rise from the dead
[58:03] and they'll be saved and abras abraham
[58:05] said nonsense they've got moses and the
[58:08] law they've got the teaching they've got
[58:10] the sound doctrine amen if they won't
[58:12] believe the doctrine they won't believe
[58:13] the miracles amen
[58:15] hallelujah
[58:17] because the antichrist church will have
[58:19] false signs and lying wonders as well
[58:22] they may have more supernatural than us
[58:23] as far as those kind of signs i don't
[58:26] know but i know one thing i know the
[58:28] holy spirit living in our lives will
[58:30] guide us into all truth and thy word is
[58:33] truth and i know one thing the bible
[58:35] says these signs shall follow them that
[58:37] believe amen
[58:39] hallelujah
[58:42] it's exactly right
[58:49] so when you have gangsters and you have
[58:51] uh
[58:54] accusers of brother random accusers of
[58:55] brother jesse what does the bible say we
[58:57] have to use sound doctrine to show how
[58:59] they're wrong
[59:01] praise god
[59:03] chapter two verse one i'm trying to
[59:05] close here i'll just do these churches
[59:07] then titus okay and then i'll stop i'll
[59:08] save these for next time lord willing
[59:10] we'll see which way the holy spirit
[59:11] directs me as i study
[59:13] titus 2 1 2 and 3.
[59:16] now i read this one last sunday
[59:18] but speak i'm sorry last wednesday but
[59:20] speak thou the things which become what
[59:23] sound
[59:24] doctrine
[59:26] so when you talk about things make sure
[59:28] it's found in the bible
[59:30] and that's why we got to be careful like
[59:31] because a lot of brothers and sisters
[59:32] have experiences right
[59:36] and so we have to make sure well is that
[59:37] exactly scriptural
[59:39] the things we talk about should be sound
[59:42] doctrine
[59:43] okay
[59:44] like brother austin here's a good
[59:46] example remember brother man told that
[59:47] story he was beyond the curtain of time
[59:49] and the angel said
[59:51] all that ever loved you and all you
[59:53] loved are here in heaven
[59:55] right but that that statement has to be
[59:57] have sound doctrine to it right in other
[1:00:01] words we have to find bible examples is
[1:00:03] there a bible example
[1:00:05] where
[1:00:06] every person a believer
[1:00:09] loved was saved
[1:00:13] now i don't know can we think of one
[1:00:15] i thought about it for years sister
[1:00:16] naomi i can't think of one
[1:00:18] i mean there could be
[1:00:20] but see how see how easy it is to just
[1:00:22] listen to the story and then just
[1:00:23] believe it but the bible says we should
[1:00:26] speak things that become what sound
[1:00:27] doctrine in other words where can i
[1:00:29] teach that in the bible
[1:00:31] now the other thought on that is well
[1:00:33] the love maybe that was just divine love
[1:00:36] so all those people i had i shared the
[1:00:38] divine love with god well of course
[1:00:40] they'll be there because they have the
[1:00:41] same holy ghost brother branham did amen
[1:00:44] now that's what i think it is now
[1:00:45] brother now before i did it brother so
[1:00:47] i'm letting you know i grew in this area
[1:00:49] i used to think well everybody i love
[1:00:50] sinners saints going to go to heaven i
[1:00:52] don't believe that anymore because i
[1:00:53] don't have scripture for that
[1:00:55] so now i feel like
[1:00:57] that story has to be understood by the
[1:00:59] bible
[1:01:01] because the bible said jesus comes to
[1:01:02] all those that love his appearing there
[1:01:04] it is right
[1:01:05] hallelujah amen that's in the book of
[1:01:07] titus as well praise god
[1:01:10] so see every story every testimony every
[1:01:13] miracle whatever it is has to be brought
[1:01:15] back to the bible to make sure that's a
[1:01:17] sound bible doctrine
[1:01:21] does that make sense everybody
[1:01:25] well brother jesse that takes a lot of
[1:01:26] work well that's exactly what preachers
[1:01:28] are supposed to be doing they're
[1:01:28] supposed to be working in the bible
[1:01:30] did you know the bible said doctrine is
[1:01:32] labor
[1:01:33] when you teach something it's actual
[1:01:34] work i've got to make sure this
[1:01:35] scripture works with that one i've got
[1:01:37] to make sure this one works together
[1:01:38] that's actual work
[1:01:40] and a workman is worthy of his hire
[1:01:43] that's why they pay the preachers
[1:01:44] because they're supposed to labor in
[1:01:46] here to give you spiritual blessings
[1:01:47] anybody blessed yet tonight by god's
[1:01:48] grace okay good i got a few amen praise
[1:01:50] the lord amen i trust you are i am too
[1:01:52] by god's grace i'm blessed by this word
[1:01:54] of god here tonight
[1:01:56] so speak now the things which becomes
[1:01:58] sound doctrine
[1:02:00] verse two that the age men be sober
[1:02:02] grave temperate sound in faith in
[1:02:05] charity and patience verse three the age
[1:02:07] women likewise that they be in behaviors
[1:02:08] becometh holiness not false accusers now
[1:02:11] look look what he tells the women make
[1:02:12] sure the women aren't lying on each
[1:02:14] other
[1:02:17] there's been a woman
[1:02:19] one of our family members of somebody in
[1:02:21] our church who's lied on me
[1:02:23] and lied on other people born in our
[1:02:25] church and got caught in the lies
[1:02:28] and this woman of course doesn't go to
[1:02:30] our church but she's related to people
[1:02:31] in our church she's a false accuser
[1:02:35] accuse me of saying things i never said
[1:02:37] and things i never did but what can i do
[1:02:39] all i can do is love them
[1:02:40] pray for them
[1:02:43] not given to much wine teachers of what
[1:02:45] good things
[1:02:48] so see a woman is to teach but look who
[1:02:50] she's supposed to teach verse 4 tells us
[1:02:52] that they may teach the young women
[1:02:56] so women don't teach from the pulpit
[1:02:58] women teach from their lives with
[1:03:01] younger women
[1:03:06] to be sober to love their husbands and
[1:03:07] to love their children okay
[1:03:14] now go down to verse uh verse six young
[1:03:16] men likewise exhort to be so reminded so
[1:03:18] austin's a young man right maokai's
[1:03:20] young man
[1:03:22] i hope i'm still young too
[1:03:24] but
[1:03:25] be sober
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:27] don't be so foolish right as young men
[1:03:29] we we can't be foolish
[1:03:31] we have to be sin we have to be serious
[1:03:33] at times right we have to be sincere
[1:03:36] right because young people have this uh
[1:03:38] inclination just to be laughed laughing
[1:03:40] all the time happy go lucky but the holy
[1:03:43] spirit says be sober minded
[1:03:46] make sure your mind is serious on the
[1:03:48] things of god
[1:03:50] verse eight
[1:03:51] i'm sorry verse verse seven why why
[1:03:53] would sober men be
[1:03:54] young men be sober mind in verse seven
[1:03:56] in all things showing thyself a pattern
[1:03:58] of good works
[1:04:01] oh something just struck me there
[1:04:03] uh
[1:04:04] in doctrine showing uncorruptedness
[1:04:07] gravity
[1:04:09] sincerity
[1:04:10] so let me show two things there you
[1:04:12] should have a pattern of good works now
[1:04:13] let me give you a pattern you already do
[1:04:15] you give ties that's the pattern of good
[1:04:16] works you give offerings that's a
[1:04:18] pattern of good works some people don't
[1:04:19] have that pattern yet they're trying to
[1:04:20] learn that pattern right we all had to
[1:04:22] learn it
[1:04:23] but you should have a pattern in other
[1:04:24] words you should see something repeat oh
[1:04:26] i do this all the time that's why you
[1:04:27] should have a fast day
[1:04:30] you should have a pattern of good works
[1:04:32] right
[1:04:34] i have a reminder to come up make sure
[1:04:35] you're given to the poor every month now
[1:04:37] some months i gotta say oh i gotta do
[1:04:38] that because i haven't given to the poor
[1:04:40] this month
[1:04:42] right but most months i've been helping
[1:04:43] people out so i just click okay done i
[1:04:45] already did it
[1:04:46] but you need a pattern you have to show
[1:04:48] yourself a pattern of good works and
[1:04:50] that comes by obeying the doctrine of
[1:04:52] the bible
[1:04:53] being able to be taught by the holy
[1:04:55] spirit how to live a godly life and a
[1:04:58] pattern of good works
[1:05:01] and we got a lot of young people coming
[1:05:02] up here don't we got a lot of little
[1:05:03] girls
[1:07:26] you
