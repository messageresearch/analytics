[34:06] righteous read one verse Luke chapter 2
[34:12] verse 14 oh thank you really enjoyed
[34:17] those specials thank you and all the
[34:20] songs like all those Christmas songs
[34:23] that make me remember my childhood you
[34:25] know we had always our little church on
[34:27] Wednesday night before Christmas our
[34:29] little church our Pentecostal church
[34:31] would go do caroling to all the houses
[34:33] for like an hour too and so we would
[34:36] sing all those songs and I got good
[34:38] memories about singing about Jesus
[34:41] so I thank the Lord for that I like to
[34:46] look at Luke 2:14 and I'd like to
[34:49] continue this little series on purpose
[34:52] we started at last New Year's Eve
[34:55] December 31st 2018 so I got quite a ways
[35:00] to go I think still on this series by
[35:02] God's grace but this is part 32 is that
[35:06] right 30 32 okay thank you
[35:09] 32 so we're looking at glory to God in
[35:14] the highest that's kind of like my
[35:16] subtopic glory to God in the highest
[35:18] Luke 2:14
[35:21] [Music]
[35:27] this morning as we open gifts and we
[35:30] read all of Newton or Matthew chapter
[35:32] two and then a lot of Luke chapter two a
[35:34] very familiar story beautiful story
[35:38] humbling story and as I was preparing
[35:42] over the last few days I've just thought
[35:44] about verse 14 so I like to look at
[35:48] glory to God in the highest let's read
[35:51] that verse together Luke 2:14 ready one
[35:54] two three
[35:55] glory to God in the highest and on earth
[35:59] peace goodwill toward men let's have one
[36:02] more word of Prayer if we can hear by
[36:05] God's grace let's just invite the
[36:06] presence of Lord again and go closer
[36:08] into our hearts and minds heavenly
[36:10] father Lord we love you we invite you
[36:12] Lord into our thoughts and minds Lord
[36:14] and we thank you how the the words of
[36:16] the Lord and the music Lord and the
[36:18] songs that we've heard Lord has cleared
[36:20] our hearts and minds Lord and just come
[36:22] a little closer now Lord and let the
[36:24] word as its preached may give us life as
[36:26] we looked at a few weeks ago Lord God
[36:28] how the word brought life Lord and
[36:31] father to strengthen our hearts and
[36:33] lives thank you for blessing us on
[36:35] Sunday with the word that I know it
[36:37] helped my prayer life Lord God and to
[36:39] have more confidence when I pray Lord
[36:41] God and thank you there was a timely
[36:42] word and so father I pray the same
[36:45] tonight Lord be a timely word bless your
[36:47] people those physically who press their
[36:49] way out to the house of God Lord
[36:51] ministered to us here those that are
[36:53] watch it later or livestream minister to
[36:55] them as well and or we're reminded the
[36:58] scripture Lord God that says gather the
[37:00] more as you see that day approaching
[37:02] Lord God and that we all might come into
[37:03] the faith Lord God and so father bring
[37:06] us all into that one faith Lord God let
[37:08] us mature and overcome Lord God and
[37:11] let's be Lord brought to the fullness of
[37:14] the stature of Christ for each measure
[37:16] Lord for our lives Lord let us manifest
[37:19] your glory as we look at this thought
[37:21] tonight in Jesus Christ's name the
[37:23] church said amen god bless you being
[37:25] seated praise God so when
[37:33] look at glory to God in the highest and
[37:35] I want to look at this little thought of
[37:38] bringing God glory as the Lord will help
[37:41] us here I hope you were blessed by
[37:45] Sunday's meetings I know my prayer life
[37:47] was much better I went you know before I
[37:49] prayed on Monday morning I went to my
[37:50] computer and typed out all those verses
[37:52] that he mentioned and then I was praying
[37:54] off of that sheet for the last few days
[37:56] I really enjoyed that that's why I love
[37:58] I love when I get a message and I can
[37:59] apply right to my life because that that
[38:03] scripture you know and in first John
[38:05] about we know he hears us if we ask
[38:08] according to his will that that to me is
[38:11] the foundational scripture for prayer
[38:14] right because Jesus you know says ask
[38:17] anything and I'll do it well that's not
[38:19] true for that's true but it won't it's
[38:21] only true if we ask a chord in his will
[38:24] so to me that was a scripture had to re
[38:27] re-emphasize there my prayer life is we
[38:30] have confidence when we ask according to
[38:31] God's will and so that really helped me
[38:33] you know what I'll just say it like this
[38:36] you know there there's a there's things
[38:39] there's times and seasons we all go
[38:41] through you know where it seems like
[38:42] God's really close and a lot of prayers
[38:44] to be an answer but then there's times
[38:45] where it seemed like you know the Lord
[38:47] is far away but he promised to never
[38:49] leave us or forsake us and so I guess I
[38:52] just been going through like a little
[38:53] quiet season where I feel like doesn't
[38:56] feel like my prayers are going behind
[38:57] the ceiling so that serve those services
[39:00] really strengthened me and and and then
[39:03] I was as I was reading this week in the
[39:05] scripture I finished the book of Genesis
[39:06] and there's some really important
[39:08] thoughts I I read about I'll share
[39:10] tonight that really helped me and
[39:12] encouraged me in my walk with the Lord
[39:16] so I thank the Lord for that and I want
[39:18] to look at the glory of God how many
[39:20] thankful for God's glory praise God you
[39:22] know there's many aspects to God's glory
[39:24] which we'll look at I like to start with
[39:28] this quote here I like to I was
[39:30] listening to this sermon we have seen
[39:32] his star and have come to worship Him
[39:34] this is from December 16 1963 its
[39:38] programs Christmas message
[39:40] and I he takes this thought here and I
[39:43] just want to start with this idea for
[39:45] Christmas
[39:46] Boban was saying how remember this is
[39:50] all prearranged by God himself this
[39:52] birth of his son when it was to take
[39:55] place how it was when it was was all
[39:57] pre-arranged by God himself did you
[40:00] notice it had to be just at this time
[40:02] when the murderous King Herod nothing
[40:06] but a murderer killed all those little
[40:08] children that it might be fulfilled
[40:09] which was spoken the Lord by the Prophet
[40:12] saying in Ramah Rachel weeping for her
[40:16] children and they were not so see there
[40:19] had to be a murderous King to fulfill
[40:21] that prophecy that was smoked many
[40:23] hundred years beforehand but when God
[40:26] speaks a word by his prophet it has to
[40:29] come to pass if it's God's word no
[40:33] matter how long it lingers it'll still
[40:35] come to pass because it's a seed jesus
[40:38] said the Word of God is a seed that a
[40:40] sower sowed so it must bear its fruit in
[40:43] its seasons and now this murders King
[40:45] had come to be at that time to do those
[40:50] evil things he says that another thing
[40:53] we want to notice is that just at the
[40:55] very time he had to raise taxes on the
[40:58] people so want you to see look at the
[41:01] time that God sends his son he sends it
[41:04] at a time when there's gonna be a really
[41:05] evil man reigning right and then it's at
[41:10] a time where financially wasn't a very
[41:13] good time more taxes right we got a tax
[41:17] break thank God at least we didn't I
[41:20] hope you did
[41:20] we had our biggest tax increase last
[41:22] year for tax return rather he says but
[41:26] Jesus he said in doing that the taxes
[41:29] cause Joseph and his wife his espoused
[41:32] wife Mary to be forced back into
[41:34] Bethlehem but ham says God knows how to
[41:39] do things so even make the works of the
[41:43] enemy praise Him so God's you know so
[41:47] the world they get Herod up there this
[41:49] evil guy and then they all raise taxes
[41:52] I'll take more of their money and what
[41:54] what he meant for evil God ends up using
[41:58] for good praise God because it allowed
[42:01] Jesus and Mary and Joseph to have to
[42:05] come back to Bethlehem praise God after
[42:08] they had left he said when we think
[42:12] sometimes it's all we got into this we
[42:14] got to that to make the clock tick just
[42:17] right
[42:17] but God's timepiece is ticking perfectly
[42:20] and Jesus will be here right on time he
[42:24] won't be one second behind everything
[42:26] will happen just exactly the way God
[42:28] said it would so whether we do it or
[42:30] whether we do not do it it will be here
[42:32] just the same because God has spoken it
[42:35] will be so so that's occurring for the
[42:38] second coming did you catch that the
[42:40] first coming no matter what was
[42:41] happening financially or politically all
[42:43] the trials and and so forth Jesus came
[42:47] right on time so will it be at the
[42:49] second coming right
[42:50] we know the churches are going to unite
[42:52] together with the government they're
[42:54] gonna unite together it's gonna be so
[42:56] close in to see their very elected if it
[42:58] were possible but it'll happen at just
[43:00] the right time and Jesus will come to
[43:02] rescues than a life praise God before
[43:04] the the enemy can end up a carry out his
[43:10] plot that's the word that they use
[43:11] before the enemy can carry out his plot
[43:13] against the bride Jesus will come and
[43:15] snatch his bride away hallelujah to be
[43:18] right on time now he find out the taxes
[43:21] that Herod said all the people were
[43:23] straight from their birthplace must
[43:25] return back that he thought he was doing
[43:27] something great there when he done this
[43:28] and not knowing he was working exactly
[43:31] in harmony with Jehovah hey Laurey
[43:35] a murderous evil king God can still have
[43:38] that person working a harmony with God
[43:41] you know like I was I I sent a man a
[43:45] letter this week and he had sent me a
[43:47] copy of his book and in the book he
[43:49] hasn't he had said that God was evil
[43:51] because the Bible says that God creates
[43:53] light and he creates peace and he
[43:55] creates evil in Isaiah 45 and I said sir
[43:58] you got the wrong interpretation when
[44:00] the Bible says I create peace and I
[44:02] create evil it's not saying God is evil
[44:04] it's saying that God
[44:06] we'll use servants on the earth to bring
[44:09] judgment upon people right because
[44:12] judgment is evil for those who are being
[44:14] judged right but God will not punish the
[44:18] righteous with the wicked Amen that's
[44:20] right and so when God says I create evil
[44:23] what he means he uses someone like
[44:25] Nebuchadnezzar remember that God said
[44:28] Nebuchadnezzar is my servant and I'm
[44:30] gonna use my servant Nebuchadnezzar to
[44:32] destroy Israel
[44:33] and carry her out of the her land amen
[44:36] so that's what that means it doesn't
[44:38] mean God is evil the Bible says God is
[44:41] just and the Bible said in God is no
[44:45] darkness at all amen you'll find nothing
[44:47] dark inside of God is all light it is
[44:50] all holiness it is all love so if God's
[44:53] in you that'll be inside of you to me as
[44:56] much as you can crucify the flesh and
[44:58] your sin nature and the nature of the
[45:00] word can live out through you praise God
[45:02] amen
[45:04] thank the Lord how many of the priests
[45:08] probably curse Harun at that time in the
[45:10] name of the Lord for raising taxes
[45:13] brother Hansen how many sit-ups early
[45:15] and said all this roman if we could just
[45:17] get a hold him and do so-and-so
[45:18] not knowing it was working exactly
[45:21] according to God's plan he says
[45:24] sometimes today we curse communism and
[45:26] all these things like Russia right
[45:28] people who curse Russia he said well
[45:30] maybe it deserves it but if you only
[45:32] knew the truth it's working exactly in
[45:35] God's hand to do just exactly what he
[45:37] said it would do he's got the raise up
[45:40] something to take Babylon off the earth
[45:42] and he's got the instrument in his hands
[45:44] you read the scripture it's written not
[45:46] right here what he said he would do and
[45:48] if those ministers of that day had just
[45:52] read and studied the word they knowed
[45:54] that was to happen and we noticed then
[45:58] that this great taxation the king gave
[46:00] forth his rule or his order and then all
[46:02] people would turn to their birthplace
[46:04] regardless now it looks like a horrible
[46:07] thing I listened you sisters that poor
[46:09] little woman in that place that she was
[46:12] heavy with child and would have to take
[46:15] that long journey
[46:19] think about how hard that was on Mary
[46:21] any sisters ever feel sorry for her
[46:24] she's the Bible said she was great with
[46:26] child so I'm not sure how much that
[46:28] means if the baby was J baby Jesus was
[46:31] big or not or just just means she was at
[46:33] the end of her her pregnancy she was
[46:36] great with child but look it didn't
[46:39] really seem where they meant like
[46:40] everything was working out for God's
[46:42] glory a woman riding the back of a
[46:44] donkey you know and that's not very
[46:47] comfortable doesn't seem like it's very
[46:50] nice and very peaceful this is the plan
[46:53] of God for my life yes it was yeah and
[46:58] some sometimes church we think hard
[46:59] times really isn't the plan of God but
[47:02] many times hard times are the plan of
[47:05] God amen none of us have ever had to
[47:09] ride a donkey for hundreds of miles
[47:11] being pregnant or weighing a lot of
[47:13] weight extra weight on us or anything
[47:15] like that
[47:15] we've never had to suffer like that be
[47:18] like God let Mary suffer like that and
[47:23] we ever remember you know she rejoiced
[47:25] because the Bible said that they would
[47:27] say Oh hail thou are highly favored well
[47:32] listen she deserves some highly high
[47:34] favor because the suffering she did
[47:36] right she deserves some of that favor
[47:40] because she suffered in a way that many
[47:42] never suffer praise God glory and charge
[47:46] you and I we're gonna sweet suffer in
[47:48] different ways that other Christians
[47:50] don't suffer in and so god I have a
[47:52] special reward and that's what the Bible
[47:55] means when the Bible said God is going
[47:57] to share his glory with us it doesn't
[47:59] mean that we get worship but what it
[48:00] means is that God gives us respect
[48:02] praise God God says you are worthy amen
[48:05] hallelujah so it's not that we get
[48:08] worship but it means we get respect and
[48:11] we get other because we've done what God
[48:13] has asked us to do praise God because
[48:17] remember every promise comes with
[48:18] conditions Amen hallelujah that eunuch
[48:23] said can I be baptized and Philip said
[48:25] Philip said there's conditions
[48:26] he said if you believe with all your
[48:28] heart you can be baptized amen
[48:32] hallelujah you shall get the Holy Ghost
[48:34] if you repent all the way if you get
[48:39] sanctified then you shall receive it but
[48:42] every promise is based upon conditions
[48:44] hallelujah that's been made real to me
[48:48] this week as I've been studying on the
[48:49] book of life did you know after the
[48:51] golden calf church did you know after
[48:53] the golden calf
[48:54] that Moses said block me out and God
[48:56] said no he said he said I'll spare you
[48:59] but I'll blot out all those who sinned
[49:01] against me do you know that and then the
[49:05] Bible the Bible God said I'm gonna blot
[49:07] them out praise God and then Jesus said
[49:11] to all those who overcome and fire tear
[49:13] he said if you overcame I will not blot
[49:16] you out of my book and then Moses said
[49:20] blot me out of the book that you've
[49:22] written who wrote that book Jesus Christ
[49:24] wrote that book amen
[49:26] and if we're believers and we stay
[49:28] faithful if we keep God's conditions by
[49:30] His grace and we surrender repent and
[49:33] Angel closer to him he will not remove
[49:36] our name off the Lamb's Book of Life a
[49:38] man but he said he would that's where
[49:42] people get mistaken do we have eternal
[49:44] security yes if you're in the Lamb's
[49:46] Book of Life
[49:47] you've got eternal security amen your
[49:49] name can never be removed praise God but
[49:54] there is no secure eternal security for
[49:56] people like Judas right who claim to be
[49:59] saved and and was justified and
[50:01] sanctified but then they sold it out
[50:03] they fell away and Jesus had to obliged
[50:06] name off the book of life he had to off
[50:09] because he said he went to his own place
[50:12] praise God oh my that's what I love
[50:16] about this it gets harder Church as time
[50:18] goes on but the revelation becomes
[50:20] clearer all the time it's darker there's
[50:24] less people serving God more people
[50:26] falling away but the revelation gets
[50:28] greater all the time amen
[50:29] praise God thank you
[50:33] like the Lord says show me things on the
[50:35] soul I never knew before now the book of
[50:37] life and as we study all these things it
[50:39] just gets more clear and we get more
[50:41] scripture all the time
[50:43] gives us more time to find the truth
[50:45] Alleluia
[50:47] because that's what the Holy Ghost is
[50:49] the Spirit of Truth he said all that
[50:53] poor little woman she was heavy with
[50:55] child would have to take that long
[50:57] journey today we would hardly think of
[51:00] taking her to ambulance right if you
[51:05] were pregnant if you were eight months
[51:06] pregnant or whatever more as sisters
[51:08] here you don't want to travel very far
[51:11] you wouldn't want to get in our
[51:12] ambulance and travel all that distance
[51:13] that's what he's sayin it was a hard
[51:16] travel but she had to if you had worse
[51:20] in Palestine scene where she come
[51:21] through that rugged granite boulders up
[51:23] through there on the back of a little
[51:25] mule no matter how bad it was and how
[51:28] cruel it seemed that was the King's
[51:30] orders and everybody must do it young or
[51:33] old prepared or not prepared they had to
[51:35] do it anyhow so she didn't have a choice
[51:39] it looks like oh god I was so pregnant
[51:42] how can I do this but she didn't have a
[51:43] choice but see God knew that and God's
[51:46] grace was going to be with her she might
[51:48] not have known it but the angels of God
[51:50] were protecting God saying all the way
[51:52] crazy God just like the age of God
[51:54] protect us like William as he travels
[51:56] and flies across the Atlantic Ocean
[51:58] they're just like the age of God go with
[52:01] us here they were with her protecting
[52:03] her all the way it got uncomfortable no
[52:05] doubt it was painful but she had to
[52:07] overcome amen hallelujah and each one of
[52:11] us got to overcome by the grace of God
[52:14] if we want our names to remain on the
[52:17] book of life right we're not the ones
[52:20] who know it right we don't know whose
[52:22] names gonna be there but we know all
[52:23] those who are born again their names can
[52:26] never be removed and they've got eternal
[52:28] security amen
[52:29] but the Bible said we don't know
[52:31] everything necessarily we can't prove
[52:33] our lesson I can't prove my name's there
[52:35] he said God could use me as a tool for
[52:38] something else
[52:38] but the Bible says if you're you believe
[52:40] your name is there that make your
[52:42] calling and election sure praise God
[52:44] that's right he says sometimes we think
[52:48] our burdens are so heavy there's nothing
[52:52] like it in the world right sometimes we
[52:54] get discouraged right me
[52:57] - Oh nobody's got it as hard as I do he
[53:03] said do you know all those things are
[53:04] for your good they are to mold you and
[53:09] to make you he said these things that we
[53:13] have today
[53:14] there's nothing happened to us that
[53:16] hasn't happened to other Christians
[53:18] before other Christians has had to stand
[53:22] in the hours of darkness like this and
[53:25] even be fed to lions for their testimony
[53:29] how hard do we really got a church you
[53:32] ever had to face a hungry line never had
[53:35] to face anything that's gonna tear you
[53:37] to pieces or anything like this ever had
[53:40] to ride on the back of a donkey for a
[53:41] hundred miles or 200 you know 200 miles
[53:43] ever long that was pregnant he says but
[53:48] all of our trials are molding us so we
[53:52] have a specific testimony you know some
[53:55] brother bender on when he was here he
[53:57] was crying I was telling him a little
[53:58] bit after I told him this you know he's
[54:01] getting a doctor to Greene he's gonna be
[54:02] like a professor you know he's in
[54:04] education and then he can write books -
[54:09] and he says it'll give more credibility
[54:10] if he's got the PhD on there he was
[54:12] going through such a hard trial and I
[54:13] said I said listen brother Ben I said I
[54:15] don't know any other message believer
[54:17] who's trying to get a doctoral degree
[54:18] and he's telling me all these trials you
[54:21] might have overheard him all these
[54:22] trials that have happened I said brother
[54:23] you just remain faithful in that I said
[54:26] because on the day of judgment God's
[54:27] gonna raise you up as an overcomer you
[54:30] were called to get a doctor's degree and
[54:32] you were calling the field of education
[54:34] God needs a teacher that's got the Holy
[54:36] Ghost amen
[54:37] God needs a witness amongst those
[54:39] doctors who think they're so smart they
[54:42] don't need God and here God is gonna
[54:43] raise brother Ben up as one who got a
[54:45] PhD but only trust in the knowledge of
[54:48] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[54:50] I said God's gonna raise you up on the
[54:52] day of judgment that you could overcome
[54:54] with every trial that seems to fall
[54:57] apart and this is gonna happen that's
[54:58] gonna happen financial struggles all
[55:00] these things and he started crying he
[55:02] said brother Jesse I really appreciate
[55:03] you sharing that I say God's got to have
[55:05] a little pastor to raise up and say well
[55:07] I can do it when others fell away others
[55:09] got discouraged
[55:10] others quit I didn't quit praise God
[55:12] because I thought the vision and I knew
[55:15] that other people had been through this
[55:17] before there's been others who had
[55:19] smaller churches in mind and yet remain
[55:21] faithful praise God so I can remain
[55:23] faithful with the little God's given me
[55:25] because it's not me it's greater is He
[55:28] that's in me than he that's in the world
[55:30] praise God hey man so he started crying
[55:34] he said I really appreciate Dennison yes
[55:35] sir I've been telling that's a lot of
[55:37] people lately I forget someone else I
[55:38] was talking about that and they said
[55:39] they really appreciated that God needs a
[55:42] mother God needs a young mother in Akron
[55:44] Ohio to overcome God needs young men and
[55:47] women praise God God needs the youth to
[55:50] be able to overcome and whatever your
[55:52] situation is God wants you to overcome
[55:54] no matter how hard this other Christians
[55:57] have it way harder than we had but we
[56:00] know that mind battles are difficult we
[56:02] know that deception is the greatest
[56:03] deception but I'm saying like this we've
[56:05] never had to face hungry lions we've
[56:08] never had to ride on a donkey like nine
[56:10] months pregnant right so we got to
[56:13] remember that God's loading us and our
[56:15] hard trials are the motifs that we can
[56:17] be a testimony for God hallelujah
[56:21] he said don't be afraid of your
[56:24] testimony for Jesus Christ shed forth
[56:26] your light stand for your convictions
[56:28] that he is the son of God and this is
[56:30] not a night for Kris Kringle what's the
[56:33] birth of Jesus Christ that we're
[56:34] celebrating amen he said did you ever
[56:39] see that when they're fixing the mold of
[56:40] bail some famous bail for a church chime
[56:44] or something that had to give a certain
[56:46] ding you see if you're ringing a chime
[56:48] it takes a certain range for each Bell
[56:51] and it makes certain materials go in
[56:53] there so much brass so much steel so
[56:55] much other ones ores that go into this
[56:57] Bell and if it just if it's just
[57:00] straight brass it won't ring right it's
[57:02] got to have all kinds of materials
[57:04] thrown into it to make it ring the right
[57:06] kind of a tone and the man who has put
[57:08] up the mold up and set the mold he knows
[57:11] exactly what it takes to go into the
[57:12] cupola what it takes to go into that
[57:15] that metal to make that bell ring that
[57:17] tone he said God is our great cupola
[57:22] he's the great refiners furnace that
[57:24] where he has to put these things upon us
[57:27] trials persecutions and things to mold
[57:30] it together to make our testimony ring
[57:34] for a certain time and a certain note
[57:37] that he once rang out in a certain day
[57:39] Amen God is trying to play music today
[57:43] hey that guy's trying to play a song
[57:45] today a song that will echo in heaven
[57:48] and he needs our lives to play certain
[57:50] notes praise God and our lives have to
[57:53] be mixed did they take it for me it
[57:56] takes some a great britain and you got
[57:58] takes some of the from Spain and some
[58:00] from Portugal
[58:01] hey guys think 2% I'm two percent
[58:04] Israeli they gotta take 18 percent of
[58:08] Native American and God had to put it
[58:10] all together melt it all together to
[58:12] give me a certain type of testimony a
[58:14] certain type of character praise God a
[58:17] certain type of attitude a certain type
[58:19] of outlook a certain type of a physical
[58:22] build up so that God could have a
[58:24] certain kind of testimony praise God
[58:26] I'll never forget when Craig Brewer said
[58:31] he's a pastor now in Connecticut he said
[58:33] you always remember when I came to the
[58:35] first Bible study out of the out of the
[58:37] denominations he said I look like
[58:38] Superman because I 190 pounds I weighed
[58:41] a lot more than I do right now
[58:42] he said long hair down to here and I
[58:44] just looked like I was all buffing her
[58:46] but God needed like a athlete God need
[58:51] like a athlete to surrender all their
[58:55] all of his rights all of his options all
[58:57] of his worldly options God needed that a
[58:59] certain kind of testimony he had to get
[59:02] a little Native American there for speed
[59:03] and jumping ability he had to get a
[59:06] little Brit Great Britain in there for a
[59:07] big old nose and a big old or something
[59:09] ears you know huh he had to put it all
[59:11] together and to bring out a testimony
[59:13] selling day of judgment my testimony
[59:16] rings praise God that it rings that that
[59:19] Christ was able to redeem an athlete
[59:21] amen
[59:22] Christ was able to redeem this this
[59:24] person in this in this life and the
[59:26] testimony will ring and I believe it
[59:28] will play onward Christian soldiers amen
[59:32] your testimony my testimony Church will
[59:35] all play the great anthems of God and
[59:37] give God glory but we got to let the
[59:40] Holy Spirit strike us a little bit
[59:42] praise God we got a little our lives the
[59:45] music of our lives be played out we got
[59:48] to be faithful to the music that the
[59:50] conductor's playing amen
[59:52] okay say I this we got to be faithful to
[59:54] the sheet music praise God if the music
[59:58] says this and I will not complain
[1:00:00] I will not despise I will not give up I
[1:00:03] will not quit if that's what the music
[1:00:04] says we better live it out praise God
[1:00:06] amen our life has to have a certain kind
[1:00:10] of testimony and that's this this point
[1:00:13] brother Ram brings out at the me of this
[1:00:16] message he said we're all made different
[1:00:19] we see different but we all see one
[1:00:22] thing that's Jesus Christ let's look at
[1:00:24] him the only way you can see him he said
[1:00:27] if he lets contrary to this word you're
[1:00:29] not looking at him right for the word is
[1:00:31] him glory
[1:00:34] if it he said if it doesn't look at that
[1:00:36] word then look away from it look to the
[1:00:39] word and that's what we're looking for
[1:00:41] Christ the manifestation of God's Word
[1:00:43] he is the vindication of God's Word hey
[1:00:47] hallelujah praise God now let's go to
[1:00:51] Genesis I want to just show you this
[1:00:52] this really encouraged me this week you
[1:00:55] know I think about you know times we go
[1:00:56] through quiet seasons and so forth I
[1:00:59] believe it's a 48 but I could be wrong
[1:01:03] I'm just guessing because I know it's at
[1:01:07] the end of the book
[1:01:17] now who remembers how it was Joseph when
[1:01:21] he was sold in the Egypt name remember
[1:01:23] 17 17 years old who knows how old was he
[1:01:29] when he finally got exalted to the right
[1:01:30] hand of Pharaoh 30 so for 13 years they
[1:01:35] men Jacob his father thought he was dead
[1:01:39] 13 years now a challenging Church read
[1:01:42] your Bible this week or soon and see how
[1:01:45] many times God spoke to Jacob when he
[1:01:48] first left and he's running from Esau he
[1:01:50] stopped the rest he made a pillow a
[1:01:52] stone and God spoke to him and said
[1:01:54] follow me and and here's a stairs of
[1:01:57] stairway to heaven and he poured the oil
[1:01:58] and said this is the house of God God
[1:02:02] told him exactly what to do and then he
[1:02:03] gets married he's got two wives all
[1:02:05] these sugar and then God said leave and
[1:02:07] go back home
[1:02:08] and so he left he went back then God
[1:02:11] said go build an altar at Bethel and all
[1:02:13] these things so the words man he meant
[1:02:15] God was talking constantly to Jacob but
[1:02:18] then when Joseph was sold it's like God
[1:02:22] didn't talk to him anymore
[1:02:23] at least in the scripture in church for
[1:02:27] at least 13 actually 13 plus 7 for 20
[1:02:31] years right because they had seven good
[1:02:32] years of plenty and then seven years of
[1:02:34] famine right so for at least 20 years
[1:02:38] Jacob is a prophet but a man he's heard
[1:02:41] the voice of God before he's seen angels
[1:02:44] amen he's seen that stairway to heaven
[1:02:46] my goodness and yet when it comes God
[1:02:50] why'd you up my son died the whole time
[1:02:53] Joseph is alive amen
[1:02:57] y'all thinking about that he heard from
[1:03:01] time and time again no look he's
[1:03:02] faithful in all the major decisions of
[1:03:06] his life he goes here he marries Rachel
[1:03:09] and Leah and then he goes here God sends
[1:03:11] him back he's faithful and everything
[1:03:12] that Jacob every time he hears the voice
[1:03:14] of God he's faithful may may that be our
[1:03:16] testimony every every major decision of
[1:03:20] your life and every crossroads of your
[1:03:22] life sit and wait and don't move until
[1:03:25] you've got the Duff saith the Lord and
[1:03:27] then God will take care of all the
[1:03:28] little decisions we just make sure that
[1:03:31] you answer God and obey God on the major
[1:03:33] decisions praise God
[1:03:35] like who you marry o where you live in
[1:03:38] children and where you go and all these
[1:03:40] major major decisions life-changing
[1:03:42] decisions make sure we wait upon the
[1:03:44] Lord and do what the Lord tells us to do
[1:03:47] aha that's what Jacob did but brother
[1:03:50] brother Malachi for 20 years he's like
[1:03:55] God why did you let me why did you let
[1:03:57] my son Joseph die in the whole time he
[1:03:59] never died he gets news of it at the end
[1:04:03] of chapter 45 and look at verse 27 45 27
[1:04:11] and they told him all the words of
[1:04:12] Joseph which he is said of them and when
[1:04:14] he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent
[1:04:15] to carrying the spirit of job Jacob
[1:04:17] their father revived so this man was in
[1:04:20] the can I say like this a major
[1:04:22] depression for 20 years now they're not
[1:04:25] supposed to have we're not supposed to
[1:04:26] have favorites as children right but he
[1:04:27] had favorites he loved Joseph more than
[1:04:30] all the other months that's not right as
[1:04:32] far as I'm concerned maybe it was right
[1:04:34] back then I don't know who might be I
[1:04:36] don't think it's right today for 20
[1:04:40] years he bound depression he cried to
[1:04:43] God God why did you take my Joseph God
[1:04:45] never took him like that little Bram
[1:04:48] said God only tells prophets what he
[1:04:51] wants them to know gory he only tells us
[1:04:59] what he wants us to know Jacobs own old
[1:05:03] man he sees the wagons of Egypt Poland
[1:05:06] he's like he's revived thank God I
[1:05:09] finally come out of this depression
[1:05:10] Church one of these days if you're in a
[1:05:12] depression God's gonna revive you hey
[1:05:14] hi-yah praise God just keep holding on
[1:05:18] to God amen
[1:05:19] just keep believing yes there's times
[1:05:22] where God seems like he's silent and
[1:05:23] he's far away but God only lets you know
[1:05:26] what he wants you to know praise God he
[1:05:29] wants to test you he wants to test your
[1:05:31] faith he wants to make sure there's a
[1:05:33] certain kind of a ring praise God
[1:05:35] hey men now tell us a lot it's a lot
[1:05:40] like job job actually lost the children
[1:05:44] though and he never cursed god that's a
[1:05:47] great test for us can we lose things
[1:05:50] that we think so dear so loving and
[1:05:52] still love God can God give and take
[1:05:56] away and yet we'll still pass the test
[1:05:58] and still say I love the Lord hallelujah
[1:06:02] amen although a minute's room into two
[1:06:05] decades of depression hallelujah he was
[1:06:09] able to hang on and he never cursed God
[1:06:13] he just battled depression for all those
[1:06:15] years
[1:06:16] but then God finally said I'm gonna I'm
[1:06:18] gonna bring the end of this I'm gonna
[1:06:20] show you what I've been hiding from you
[1:06:22] all these years
[1:06:22] hey but had to be a right time and the
[1:06:25] right things and praise God look at
[1:06:29] verse 28 and Israel said it is enough
[1:06:31] Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and
[1:06:35] see him before I die amen
[1:06:38] as hard as it was to see the the coat of
[1:06:43] many colors colored a covered in blood
[1:06:45] and years of depression and all these
[1:06:48] things and hard as it was he hang on to
[1:06:51] God he never cursed God he went through
[1:06:54] harder things than what we went through
[1:06:55] praise God but he had he never cursed
[1:06:58] God he passed the test and now there's a
[1:07:00] certain testimony that he never cursed
[1:07:02] God even though he lost his son
[1:07:04] and God can bring me on a depression
[1:07:06] amen Oh hallelujah what a testimony
[1:07:11] church that's beautiful
[1:07:17] so for 20 years this man who saw the he
[1:07:19] saw the stairway he saw angels he talked
[1:07:22] to God he heard God's voice okay moved
[1:07:23] back to Canaan
[1:07:24] okay now go go to Laban you know he was
[1:07:27] back and forth and he always heard from
[1:07:28] God for 20 years God never tells him the
[1:07:30] answer Joseph is dead joseph is dead god
[1:07:34] never tells him any different he's not
[1:07:36] dead
[1:07:37] now look Church right after he finds out
[1:07:39] look what he does now let me find the
[1:07:47] chapter think it's 46 yes coma 46 verse
[1:07:52] 1 and Azrael took his journey with all
[1:07:54] that he had and came to Beersheba and
[1:07:56] offered sacrifices under the god of his
[1:07:58] father Isaac so now that Joseph's alive
[1:08:01] he's I'm gonna go sacrifice to the Lord
[1:08:03] thank you lord my son's not dead and
[1:08:06] look at verse 2 and who spoke to him God
[1:08:12] 20-years god I haven't heard anything
[1:08:14] about Joseph I didn't even know he was
[1:08:16] alive and now God starts talking to him
[1:08:19] again
[1:08:20] this is what encouraged me church
[1:08:21] there's times God will seem like God's
[1:08:24] telling you things all the time right
[1:08:25] tell you this tell you this tell you
[1:08:27] this and then all of a sudden it's like
[1:08:29] going in depression I don't hear God's
[1:08:33] voice
[1:08:33] what happened and actually God lets you
[1:08:35] think the wrong thing right God let him
[1:08:39] think the wrong thing that Joseph was
[1:08:41] dead for 20 years at least 20 years and
[1:08:47] God spake unto Israel in the visions of
[1:08:49] the night oh thank you Lord and said
[1:08:54] Jacob Jacob and he said here am i he
[1:09:00] said I am God the God of thy father fear
[1:09:02] not to go down to Egypt for well I will
[1:09:05] there make a V a great nation I will go
[1:09:08] down with thee to Egypt so that these
[1:09:10] major decisions of his life he leaves
[1:09:13] Canaan you know to get a wife God tells
[1:09:16] him to do that then God tells him to go
[1:09:17] back and now God saying go down into
[1:09:19] Egypt look Church we just got to be
[1:09:21] faithful with thus saith the Lord amen
[1:09:23] we're gonna make little mistakes in our
[1:09:25] little Christian life but I'm talking
[1:09:27] about in the major things when we know
[1:09:29] we've got that saith the Lord we've got
[1:09:31] to obey that praise God seen his major
[1:09:35] decisions even though God hid things
[1:09:37] from God would return thank God amen
[1:09:40] God would return and speak to him again
[1:09:43] in a night vision praise God now night
[1:09:46] vision is different than a dream a
[1:09:48] dreams when you go to sleep a night
[1:09:49] vision is why you're awake at night and
[1:09:51] you see a vision at night Alleluia
[1:09:57] notice Jacob didn't complain God why
[1:10:00] didn't you tell me for 20-some years if
[1:10:01] my son died or my son was alive God he
[1:10:04] didn't complain because this and he
[1:10:06] realized that God works all things
[1:10:08] together for good to them that love him
[1:10:11] he wasn't one to get upset with God like
[1:10:13] we've seen you know we seen people get
[1:10:15] upset with God right we're not gonna get
[1:10:18] upset with God yes we'll cry we'll be
[1:10:19] heartbroken who might depression with
[1:10:21] him when things go wrong we thought we
[1:10:23] should go another way but he never
[1:10:24] cursed God he remained faithful and then
[1:10:27] God returned and said Jacob Jacob here
[1:10:30] am i amen he said I'm going down with
[1:10:34] you I'll surely bring you up again and
[1:10:36] Joseph shall put his hand upon his eyes
[1:10:41] you know how you know how he got back
[1:10:44] Joseph had to carry his bones back
[1:10:46] that's how he got back God said I'm
[1:10:47] gonna bring you back but it's gonna be
[1:10:48] after you're dead right so look at that
[1:10:53] church for like 20 years or more he
[1:10:56] never heard anything about his son being
[1:10:58] alive in Egypt because there's times God
[1:11:01] is silent on things and it's a teach us
[1:11:04] the weight upon his plan right
[1:11:06] teach us to go through fiery afflictions
[1:11:09] and and things that seem so difficult
[1:11:11] right like marry such a difficult thing
[1:11:14] back and forth and I'm pregnant all
[1:11:16] these things so difficult taxes and then
[1:11:19] this murderous King these things seem so
[1:11:22] difficult but it all works together
[1:11:24] according to God's perfect plan
[1:11:28] glory is that okay church is that okay
[1:11:34] you see what that's why that really
[1:11:36] encouraged me 20 years he's like my
[1:11:38] son's dead and he never was dead because
[1:11:41] God doesn't tell you everything okay say
[1:11:44] like this God wants you to sweat it out
[1:11:45] sometimes you got to stuff how many if
[1:11:49] you want to reign within you got to have
[1:11:50] godly character how do you I gonna have
[1:11:53] godly character if you give up after 20
[1:11:55] years I can have godly character well
[1:11:57] I've waited five years I waited ten
[1:11:59] years I waited twenty years I can have
[1:12:00] godly character if you can't wait thirty
[1:12:02] or forty years
[1:12:04] see godly character patience is built
[1:12:08] not by just giving you everything you
[1:12:09] want it's built by testing and
[1:12:12] stretching it praise God you make taking
[1:12:15] it further than you think you could go
[1:12:17] praise God that's how God molds genuine
[1:12:21] patience in our heart not by answering
[1:12:23] right away but by teaching us to wait
[1:12:25] upon him
[1:12:28] hmm what a Christmas message praise God
[1:12:33] Ivan got the glory to God in the highest
[1:12:35] that's where I wanted to get to thank
[1:12:37] the Lord and then here's an
[1:12:42] thought now that's forward to the New
[1:12:43] Testament Joseph I just want to just
[1:12:44] briefly hit this we don't know much
[1:12:46] about him he's a carpenter the carpet
[1:12:49] Jesus the carpenter's son he worked with
[1:12:51] wood all the time Church worked with
[1:12:57] wood that was his testimony all we know
[1:12:59] about him is that he was a faithful
[1:13:01] father a faithful husband the Bible said
[1:13:05] he was a good honest a righteous man and
[1:13:08] all we know is that was righteous he did
[1:13:10] everything right he tried to obey God
[1:13:12] the best he could but when the Lord
[1:13:14] spoke to him in a dream with thus saith
[1:13:16] the LORD now not all of our dreams are
[1:13:18] from God but when he knew that dream is
[1:13:20] from God he acted on it amen move you
[1:13:26] must leave they said name the child
[1:13:28] Jesus for her save his people from their
[1:13:31] sins aim ahead Larry so he named him
[1:13:34] Jesus that's all we know about him
[1:13:37] we know he he moved his family to Egypt
[1:13:40] and moved him back to Bethlehem to be
[1:13:42] taxed and then and then moved into
[1:13:44] Nazareth the worst place in the world
[1:13:47] why am I at this time my life
[1:13:50] I got young family why am I going to the
[1:13:52] worst low down neighborhood there is an
[1:13:54] accurate or Doylestown see sometimes why
[1:13:59] would I be in the worst low down
[1:14:00] neighborhood there ever could be well
[1:14:02] maybe it's to fulfill God's plan for
[1:14:04] your life
[1:14:05] maybe there's a poor neighbor out there
[1:14:07] that needs to know the love of Jesus
[1:14:08] Christ praise God and how they gonna
[1:14:15] hear unless God some send somebody in
[1:14:17] flesh how they gonna hear they're not
[1:14:19] gonna hear except we tell them praise
[1:14:21] God
[1:14:22] so there he goes to Nazareth can any
[1:14:25] good thing come out of Nazareth and yet
[1:14:29] God told him to do it through dreams so
[1:14:34] that's the testimony like about Joseph
[1:14:35] we use Joseph of the old and Jacob also
[1:14:39] his father and Joseph of the new all's
[1:14:41] we know is he was righteous he obeyed
[1:14:45] every time he got a major decision he
[1:14:47] obeyed
[1:14:47] he kept God's purpose for his life he
[1:14:51] didn't reject it he obeyed it when he
[1:14:53] knew it was thus saith the Lord now the
[1:14:54] hard thing for us is and no one is
[1:14:55] thus saith the Lord well what it lines
[1:14:58] up with the word right because God will
[1:15:02] always give two or three witnesses in
[1:15:04] the mouth of every witness that I'm
[1:15:05] sending the mouth of two or three
[1:15:06] witnesses let every word be established
[1:15:11] praise God so see Joseph it was so
[1:15:17] simple he just had to obey the Lord at
[1:15:19] every major decision in his life and he
[1:15:23] did and then remember that when I
[1:15:25] preached a few weeks ago
[1:15:26] from the time Jesus was 12 - time is 30
[1:15:30] we don't hear nothing about him but
[1:15:31] Joseph's job after that was to give
[1:15:34] orders to Jesus to keep Jesus in
[1:15:37] subjection and of course Jesus always
[1:15:38] obeyed so probably wasn't that hard but
[1:15:41] Joseph had to tell him Jesus go to this
[1:15:43] Jesus take out the wood shavings Jesus
[1:15:45] make this for that customer go deliver
[1:15:47] this to the customer one of this this
[1:15:49] table he had to order Jesus and tell
[1:15:52] Jesus he had to keep Jesus in the
[1:15:54] subjection right and Jesus learned
[1:15:57] obedience through Joseph and that's all
[1:16:02] we know we don't know any other miracles
[1:16:04] Church from his life did Joseph ever
[1:16:06] pray for the sick I don't know but God
[1:16:09] wanted us church to hear the ring can I
[1:16:11] get a ring here now it would ring God
[1:16:15] with us the ring of josephus Joseph's
[1:16:17] life was to be able to hear thus saith
[1:16:19] the Lord and move my family there to
[1:16:22] here they'll say the Lord named the baby
[1:16:24] this to hear thus saith the Lord and
[1:16:27] stay married to Mary she is a virgin to
[1:16:30] hear thus saith the Lord and just teach
[1:16:32] Jesus and be a faithful father o God
[1:16:35] could just help us be faithful mothers
[1:16:36] and fathers amen that's the room where
[1:16:39] they Memphis that's the ring God want us
[1:16:41] to hear when we read about Joseph in the
[1:16:42] Bible just be faithful be righteous be a
[1:16:45] godly man and God will let your life
[1:16:48] ring not only here on earth but in
[1:16:50] heaven as well praise God hey man that's
[1:16:53] where a cow's Amen is heaven jesus said
[1:16:57] if you
[1:16:58] fess the if you confess the father
[1:17:00] before me he said or before men I'll
[1:17:02] confess your name before the holy angels
[1:17:04] in heaven praise God amen that was a
[1:17:10] great encouragement to me Church I'm
[1:17:13] gonna use this quote from how can I
[1:17:14] overcome I read it a few weeks ago he
[1:17:16] said they overcome the mud that was
[1:17:18] around them and packed into them stuck
[1:17:23] their head above the thing and shine for
[1:17:25] the glory of God hallelujah now I want
[1:17:30] to move into that glory of God I'll try
[1:17:33] to just preach a few more minutes here
[1:17:37] so I wanted to preach a little bit out
[1:17:39] of the Christmas story but this main
[1:17:41] thought I want to now end with I won't
[1:17:43] be able to finish it is with the glory
[1:17:45] of God what is the glory of God there's
[1:17:47] lots of different ways to say it
[1:17:49] it means splendor or brightness it means
[1:17:54] magnificence excellence preeminence
[1:17:56] dignity or grace it said the kingly
[1:18:00] Majesty which belongs to Christ as
[1:18:02] supreme ruler absolute perfection of the
[1:18:06] deity that's the glory of God
[1:18:09] thank the Lord a most glorious condition
[1:18:13] an exalted state what is God's glory
[1:18:16] it's an exalted state hallelujah the
[1:18:23] angels let's go back to Luke chapter 2
[1:18:24] here
[1:18:25] gotcha Bible Luke 2:8 and there was in
[1:18:32] the same country shepherds abiding in
[1:18:33] the field keeping watch over their flock
[1:18:35] by night so that tells us it wasn't
[1:18:37] exactly wintertime because you wouldn't
[1:18:40] have farmers in a field at nighttime if
[1:18:43] it's wintertime because it's too cold
[1:18:45] and low the
[1:18:48] the Lord came upon them and the glory of
[1:18:50] the Lord that majesty aim that splendor
[1:18:54] that brightness amen
[1:18:57] shown around about them and they were
[1:19:00] sore afraid the brightness of God's
[1:19:02] glory
[1:19:04] that's why brother BAM said the
[1:19:06] anointing is two separate things he said
[1:19:08] you can have the anointing to bubble
[1:19:09] dance he said but then you can have the
[1:19:11] anointing it's about scares you to death
[1:19:13] there's an anointing for joy
[1:19:16] he said there's an anointing of God's
[1:19:17] presence and that makes you feel like
[1:19:21] you're gonna die verse 10 and the angel
[1:19:24] said of them fear not for behold I bring
[1:19:26] you good tidings of great joy which
[1:19:28] shall be to all people for unto you Is
[1:19:32] Born This Day in the City of David a
[1:19:34] savior which is Christ the Lord
[1:19:36] and this should be a sign unto you you
[1:19:40] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:19:41] clothes lying in a manger
[1:19:44] and that's so gracious of God that God
[1:19:46] sends his glory and then God said I'm
[1:19:48] not gonna just send my glory I'm gonna
[1:19:50] give you a sign I'm gonna give you my
[1:19:53] word I'm gonna that's what I like about
[1:19:54] God he gives you word he gives you
[1:19:56] experience and it'll give you a sign to
[1:19:59] vindicate it all praise God see if it's
[1:20:02] really God's will he's gonna have his
[1:20:04] word you're gonna have an experience and
[1:20:06] you're gonna have a sign that will prove
[1:20:08] that you're in the perfect will of God
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:15] you'll find a bay
[1:20:17] wrapped in swaddling clothes not a young
[1:20:19] child like the three wise men found they
[1:20:21] found a young child this is a babe look
[1:20:25] at this and suddenly there was with the
[1:20:26] angel a multitude of the heavenly host
[1:20:30] praising God
[1:20:32] they weren't praising the Shepherd's
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:36] they were praised to themselves they
[1:20:38] were praising God saying glory to God in
[1:20:43] the highest and on earth peace goodwill
[1:20:46] toward men you ever understand this
[1:20:49] church he's saying peace on earth but
[1:20:52] within two years Herod is going to slay
[1:20:54] all those hundreds of thousands of
[1:20:56] children so this wasn't just for this
[1:21:00] just wasn't just for a short term this
[1:21:02] was a long term thing right it was
[1:21:04] through Jesus's cross amen it was
[1:21:08] through the Holy Spirit that God was
[1:21:10] going to bring peace amen he was going
[1:21:12] to being free he was going to bring
[1:21:13] peace in the hearts of believers amen
[1:21:16] that wrestle with God that Ward against
[1:21:19] God God was going to bring it hearts the
[1:21:21] hearts the peace of God that they needed
[1:21:24] real peace on earth won't happen to the
[1:21:26] Millenium praise God look believers can
[1:21:29] have peace with God now oh my I thank
[1:21:32] the Lord thank you Jesus
[1:21:36] goodwill toward men glory to God so
[1:21:40] Jesus is close that star is very close
[1:21:43] right but he says the angel sing glory
[1:21:47] to God in the highest God's gonna get
[1:21:50] all the glory he said as a sign of this
[1:21:53] you'll find the babe wrapped in
[1:21:56] swaddling clothes praise God you know in
[1:22:01] other words you find the word wrapped in
[1:22:02] a lot of humility praise God I found the
[1:22:06] word this hour wrapped in a little man
[1:22:10] named Simon Smith for his God is wrapped
[1:22:15] in a humble man that's how I found the
[1:22:17] message shining up all my life praise
[1:22:19] God I found it a little humble brother
[1:22:22] praise God you find that little humble
[1:22:25] church who you heard a little humble
[1:22:27] service somewhere the word was wrapped
[1:22:29] in a humble
[1:22:30] ring praise God but it was a sign
[1:22:33] it was the assign from the Angels this
[1:22:36] is where I am praise God
[1:22:38] thank the Lord what do the Angels do
[1:22:42] they like to praise God what do his
[1:22:45] servants on earth like to do his
[1:22:46] heavenly servants like to praise what do
[1:22:48] we like to do we like to praise God
[1:22:50] hallelujah
[1:22:53] so those angels do a lot of praising God
[1:22:56] remember there's the seraphim's up there
[1:22:58] saying holy holy holy all the time holy
[1:23:00] ho they just fly around saying holy holy
[1:23:02] holy is the Lord God Almighty all around
[1:23:04] the throne and now more angels come down
[1:23:07] and they say glory to God how do they uh
[1:23:10] praise God angels servants of God made
[1:23:14] me praise God what a reminder that
[1:23:18] angels carry the presence of God
[1:23:21] hallelujah they're saying magnificence
[1:23:27] to God in the highest hallelujah in
[1:23:33] other words they're saying praise God
[1:23:35] for he's going to redeem man the plan of
[1:23:39] redemption will bring glory to God and
[1:23:41] designed to express his glory Jesus is
[1:23:46] going to be the evidence of God's love
[1:23:48] to his people his mercy his
[1:23:51] condescension and his high regard to the
[1:23:53] honor of his law and the stability of
[1:23:56] his own government amen glory to God in
[1:24:00] the highest has at least four meanings
[1:24:02] it means the highest strains or the
[1:24:05] highest possible manner amen glory so
[1:24:09] the highest possible praise God could
[1:24:11] have is angels right and the heavenly
[1:24:14] hosts saying and glory to God a second
[1:24:18] meaning is it's among the highest among
[1:24:21] the angels of God indicating that the
[1:24:24] Angels felt a deep interest in this work
[1:24:26] and were called upon to praise God for
[1:24:29] the redemption of man in other words go
[1:24:32] to God amongst the highest most holiest
[1:24:35] of his creatures and then it also means
[1:24:39] glory in the highest in the highest
[1:24:41] heavens indicating that the praise of
[1:24:43] redemption
[1:24:44] be confined to earth but it should be
[1:24:47] spread throughout the universe
[1:24:49] hey a minute glory
[1:24:52] it also means glory to God in the
[1:24:55] highest is equivalent to the Most High
[1:24:57] God
[1:24:58] in other words glory to the Most High
[1:25:01] God and the same is saying let the Most
[1:25:05] High God be praised for his love and His
[1:25:08] mercy to his people praise the Lord
[1:25:11] thank the Lord let me say a few more
[1:25:17] things here by God's grace you know the
[1:25:21] glory and the heavens are connected all
[1:25:23] through the Book of Psalms there's two
[1:25:24] four six there's seven scriptures about
[1:25:28] the glory of God and the heavens in the
[1:25:30] Book of Psalms Psalms 8:1 Oh Lord o our
[1:25:33] Lord how excellent is thy name above all
[1:25:36] the earth who has set thy glory above
[1:25:39] the heavens Psalms 19:1 the heavens
[1:25:43] declare the glory of God and the
[1:25:46] firmament showeth his handiwork Psalms
[1:25:50] 5075 be thou exalted O God above the
[1:25:53] heavens let thy glory be above the earth
[1:25:58] so in 57:11 be thou exalted O God above
[1:26:02] the heavens let thy glory be above the
[1:26:05] earth he repeats it Jewish poetry does a
[1:26:07] lot of repetition Psalms ninety seven
[1:26:09] six the heavens declare is righteousness
[1:26:12] and all the people see his glory thank
[1:26:16] the Lord
[1:26:16] Psalms 108 five be thou exalted O God
[1:26:20] above the heavens and thy glory above
[1:26:23] all the earth so Lord your majesty is
[1:26:26] greater than the earth it's greater than
[1:26:28] all the heavens how can anything get
[1:26:30] greater than all those stars and all the
[1:26:32] planets out there but yet David saying
[1:26:34] your glory is greater than that praise
[1:26:36] God
[1:26:37] amen hallelujah and these angels come
[1:26:41] down and say glory to God in the highest
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] these angels that live way far above the
[1:26:47] heavens they know how insignificant this
[1:26:50] little place is because they live in the
[1:26:52] presence of God amen
[1:26:54] ah and there they're praising God saying
[1:26:58] glory
[1:26:58] to God who's high above all this for
[1:27:02] sending his son Jesus Christ praise God
[1:27:05] last one Psalms 1:13 for the Lord is
[1:27:09] high above all nations and his glory
[1:27:12] above the heavens
[1:27:15] that's beautiful church isn't it how
[1:27:18] many think that's beautiful tonight
[1:27:19] oh thank the Lord see all things are for
[1:27:25] God's glory Romans 11:36 for of him so
[1:27:31] of God so from God through him so
[1:27:36] something comes from God but other
[1:27:38] things must come through God through his
[1:27:40] power and to him sometimes these are
[1:27:44] given back to God so God it's from God
[1:27:48] through God to God are all things so
[1:27:54] everything's either from God to God or
[1:27:56] through God there's three of them n to
[1:28:00] whom be glory forever amen see
[1:28:05] everything comes from God everything
[1:28:07] goes back to God everything happens
[1:28:09] through God for those who are believers
[1:28:13] so to him be glory for ever and ever
[1:28:16] amen praise the Lord I want to do a few
[1:28:21] more here just a few more scriptures
[1:28:22] here could you pull up lydia isaiah 43:7
[1:28:31] you know this church I know this but
[1:28:34] let's just revisit it here tonight on
[1:28:35] this Christmas night Jesus when he was
[1:28:38] born the angel saying glory to God in
[1:28:41] the highest so God was supposed to be
[1:28:44] praised right when Jesus came all the
[1:28:48] praise went to God all the glory went to
[1:28:51] God and near the Bible said even
[1:28:54] everyone that is called by my name for I
[1:28:56] have created him for my glory my
[1:28:59] splendor my preeminence my praise I
[1:29:02] informed him yay I have made him that's
[1:29:07] why I wanted this to be a part of the
[1:29:08] purpose series because your purpose in
[1:29:10] life my purpose in life
[1:29:12] is to bring God glory let me go back to
[1:29:18] that definition so through your life God
[1:29:23] should get magnified God should get
[1:29:27] preeminence God should get dignity
[1:29:30] dignity and respect God should be
[1:29:33] exalted or more through our lives that's
[1:29:36] what that means glory I've created him
[1:29:39] for my glory my exaltation so see Church
[1:29:45] that's why Mary had to go through hard
[1:29:46] thing hard times Joseph in the Old
[1:29:48] Testament Joseph in the New Testament
[1:29:49] Mary on the back of a mule for all those
[1:29:52] miles why they have to go through hard
[1:29:55] things so they can turn around and give
[1:29:57] God glory give God the praise hallelujah
[1:30:08] thank the Lord
[1:30:11] hallelujah let me just do a couple more
[1:30:13] here Jesus Christ says it so plainly
[1:30:18] I'll just close with Christ things here
[1:30:19] out orbán I'll have to preach rest this
[1:30:21] on Sunday I didn't think I'd get through
[1:30:23] all of it I didn't let's close with
[1:30:26] Christ John 4:34 John 4:30
[1:30:38] saith unto them my meat is to do the
[1:30:41] will of him that sent me and to finish
[1:30:44] his work what was Jesus feeding on every
[1:30:47] church service were they meant what do
[1:30:52] you think Saints what was what was Jesus
[1:30:54] hungry to do what was he feeding on we'd
[1:30:57] say oh I feed on the preaching here
[1:30:59] that's what he was feeding on he was
[1:31:01] feeding on doing the will of God my meat
[1:31:05] when I'm feeding on is to do God's will
[1:31:08] right then john 17:4
[1:31:13] he said I have glorified thee on the
[1:31:16] earth I have finished the work there's
[1:31:19] the meat I finished the work which thou
[1:31:24] gavest me to do can you pull out their
[1:31:26] acacia john 17:4 somebody can see it
[1:31:32] jesus's meat was to do the will do the
[1:31:35] work of God and then how do we know
[1:31:37] Jesus glorified God because he because
[1:31:40] he finished the work that God gave him
[1:31:42] to do
[1:31:53] stay there in John 17 the case you go to
[1:31:56] verse 5 they lujah and now O Father
[1:32:01] glorify thou me with our own self with
[1:32:06] the glory which I had with thee before
[1:32:09] the world was
[1:32:11] praise got less than to our feet here
[1:32:20] thank the Lord Jesus is one request he's
[1:32:24] about to die he's about to suffer the
[1:32:27] absolute worst death any human ever
[1:32:30] could suffer and he's praying and saying
[1:32:33] God I've glorified you I brought you
[1:32:37] glory I finished the work that you've
[1:32:40] called me to do now glorify me with the
[1:32:44] glory that we shared before the
[1:32:47] foundation of the world oh my when it
[1:32:51] was just God and his son can we think
[1:32:53] about that just for a moment before
[1:32:55] there was any earth before the world was
[1:32:57] ever founded it was just God in his son
[1:33:00] the events are the first thing he made
[1:33:01] was angels right just God his son and
[1:33:06] somehow Jesus that theophany body must
[1:33:10] have remembered that he had glory with
[1:33:12] the father before the foundation of the
[1:33:14] world Jesus had to bend that light that
[1:33:17] theophany that lo gasps goodness
[1:33:19] gracious it had to remember what it was
[1:33:25] like before the foundation of the world
[1:33:29] and so because he had those memories
[1:33:31] before the foundation of world he says
[1:33:33] glorify me with the glory that I had
[1:33:35] what was he asking for church
[1:33:37] he was asking help me to get through
[1:33:38] this so I can get my glorified body okay
[1:33:41] I didn't raise god amen that's what he
[1:33:45] was asking because the glorified bodies
[1:33:47] a perfected body it's a perfect he said
[1:33:50] let me go back to being in that
[1:33:52] condition because remember Jesus
[1:33:53] suffered temptation he suffered pain and
[1:33:56] heartache and headaches and bleeding but
[1:34:00] he can remember back through the
[1:34:01] spiritual part of him he can remember
[1:34:03] back and say glorify me with the glory
[1:34:05] that we
