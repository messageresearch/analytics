we ask that the Holy Spirit would speak to us here tonight Lord God just bless us as we read Thy Word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God let's go to Romans chapter nine I'd like to pick up there and try to finish Romans n9ine here tonight by God's grace by God's grace we'll focus on verse uh 32 but let's read just Romans 9:32 here tonight and just reminder you know we have brother Simon coming I believe it's March 10th or 11th let me just check real quick we're quickly getting into March Yeah March 10th and then brother uh Diggs I was texting him today he should be coming on March 24th by God's grace we have communion on March 31st the Lord's Supper there so those are kind of three important dates here coming up for March brother cam asked me to preach uh and so I told him either March 10th I'd probably go over to Napoleon or March 24th depending on how that works out I know they have a youth meeting on the 23rd so um I'm going to try to go to brother cams maybe on March 10th we'll kind of see how that goes um sure we look forward to seeing the Saints there in Theo by God's grace so uh Romans 9:32 we'll just read that one verse and we'll have you be seated here by the grace of the Lord last night I put out a video um I kind of been preaching on it numerous times but I was working on that video um the dangers of leaving the message is showing how if people reject the truth the only thing that's left for them is the evil spirits right because the Bible says you uh if you give heed to a seducing Spirit it means to take on that spirit so to turn down the truth is to take heed or accept or Harbor an evil spirit so what a what a privilege we have church to be clean in the sight of Christ tonight amen we don't want to take that for granted uh we're so thankful for the truth that sets us free Hallelujah so let's read Romans 9:32 let's read that on three one two three wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah we'll preach the word of God here tonight look at more on Romans got a couple nice feedback from this weekend and last few services so I'm thankful the Lord has been helping people uh through these sermons here by the grace of God we'll try to finish here Romans 9ine and U um then Lord willing we'll look at I just want to add a few different thoughts you know Sunday was kind of Sunday was so unique right we had no musicians other than 10 finger musicians that can clap um and I actually I had a thought I was just a similar thought I was going to share I never got to it I kind of skipped over it forgot it so I'll preach a little bit on that tonight by God's grace but is it nice to have Malachi back there by God's grace and good to see brother the amen I know his gift is such a tremendous blessing to us all and um we're so thankful to to have musicians praise God we're so blessed it kind of took me back to when we first first started the church I was like my one day one day we'll have a musician one day and we're thankful for all these days that we're blessed to have faithful musicians by God's grace so I want to back up though to Romans 9:28 and I'll kind of preach through this last few verses here share a few thoughts that the Lord put on my heart and some of them I didn't get to on Sunday because I just forgot about them okay so Romans 9:28 the Bible says for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth and so I want to take a few thoughts out of here you know on Sunday I showed how the timeline uh is divided up you know for in 6,000 years we have 6,000 years of human history each of the 2,000 year chunks those three chunks God did something major and we know in this last chunk God sent a prophet with the spirit of Elijah a son of man Ministry and then uh to forun the coming of Christ the physical coming of Christ The Rapture Hallelujah and so you know I'm just watching I'm sure you are watching the government and I'm watching especially United States government to see when will they legalize Christian persecution that's what I'm watching you know with each passing year and week and month I'm just watching that and I feel like when I see the United States government uh sanctioning uh Christian persecution then we know the raptures on by God's grace it'll be very short time uh by the grace of God and you know one way they are persecuting people you know I don't know if you've seen but they they specifically targeted you know anyone that would be a pro conservative right um they made they've made thousands of arrests of people that just visited the capital on January 6 2021 and I showed you the video the one time you know they uh they made all the pro-conservative people out to be pro-christian um and uh they were so they were making Christians the bad guys on January 6th and so forth and then you know of course they're they're using uh different cities that are are are liberal run they're they're weaponizing the the judge the courts and the judges against anyone who's conservative trying to strip all their property thank God we live in a pretty conservative state by God's grace but there's people that live in you know liberal areas like California and you know DC and and New York they're getting literally persecuted right so we see it it's starting to slowly creep out we're starting to see that persecution and don't forget brother brand said thus sayith the Lord the same persecution that was in the Roman government is coming to the United States so I just want to we we as we look at this verse remember that it's to us it seems like a very slow thing right to us it might seem like it's long far off but uh the Bible calls it a short work 6,000 years is a short work to a timeless God an eternal God 6,000 years is a very small amount of time right and so the Bible says here God is going to finish this work he's going to cut it short in righteousness in other words there's going to be a very uh small group of people that will live righteously hallelujah it's a short amount of time there's a small amount of people that are actually living righteously on the earth Hallelujah God's going to make it a short work you know we've just had 2,000 years of the gospel uh preached right but that's a very short time that's like two days right because a day with the Lord is as a thousand years with man think about that just been two days what were you doing two days ago on Monday can you think of that well we're enjoying some sunshine right right I was outside I was outside playing with my my little boys Z were playing football outside and tackling each other rolling around the grass that was just two days ago look look at the change today within two days but that's what God is like that the day of Pentecost was just two days days ago in the mind of God just two days ago that's how short it was right and so you know in some ways we we we feel like time is going so slow my it's been almost 60 years since brother BR went off the scene he had all these warnings about judgment you know judgment to the West Coast All These Warnings about the coming of the Lord and to us it feels like a long time but the Bible says it's a short work so we got to take our minds and remember everything's working out just as God said it Hallelujah in other words the end will be here before before we realize it made me think of all the heroes of the faith this week I thought of all the heroes that have been down through the church ages even you know Martin Luther John Wesley all these Heroes down through the church ages Martin and Columba all these Heroes their lives have come and gone and we just read about them right in our minds in our imaginations we think my what it would have been like to live like that what were their lives like and church it it ought to make us you know to redeem the time because the days are evil right if God carries pretty soon you know our lives will just be a story it'll be a story in somebody's in somebody's mind probably just our family members right because we're not we're not a brother brandom we're not a Billy Graham or we're not anything like that you know we're gonna we're going to have our lives as a testimony in some family members mind and so we must remember God's going to make it a short work on the earth you know time moves quickly right as we get older time moves faster I was talking with a parent today it's almost the end of the school year already we're coming up on the end of the air feels like it just started right so sometimes it feels like it moves slow you know but sometimes it moves feels like it moves quickly but here in God's eyes we get this idea God is going to cut it short God is looking for someone righteous and I love that that's what Abraham prayed for God if there's 50 if there's 40 if there's 30 if there's 20 and finally God if there's 10 have mercy if there's 10 and God said I'll have mercy if there's 10 my but but yet God couldn't find 10 righteous people in Sodom he only found uh four right but then one of them wasn't righteous as it turned out there was only three righteous people in that entire city well I look around here I see I see well aran's got a pretty good amount by God's grace right we got more than three Hallelujah let's continue to be the righteous Hallelujah let's continue to sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city Hallelujah now Jesus also said in Matthew 24:21 we get the same idea for then shall be Great Tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be that's speaking of the tribulation period the seven-year tribulation and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect sake those days will be shortened so we know there must be some elect there'll be some uh Jewish right there'll be some Jewish uh Believers that will receive the Holy Ghost they're no doubt the elect I believe there will be even foolish virgins of the Jews I believe there'll be some foolish virgin Christians brother Ram says they'll be saved but they'll have to give their lives of course right because they will not take the mark of the beast so notice we have two verses there then uh from Romans here and from Jesus in Matthew 24 that the the days are going to be cut short right the people are going to act and feel like the the time is going to keep moving on but God said I'm going to cut it short in righteousness so that somebody could be saved Hallelujah by so time is moving we'd say swiftly by go swiftly by God's grace pardon me now going back to Romans 9:29 and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabbath that means the Lord of hosts had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and B uh and been made like unto gamorra so here we see God's longsuffering is magnified right and we could all say Amen to that if it hadn't been for God who who left us the word of God if it hadn't been God who who' had mercy on us right we would have all been just all Filthy Sinners right and so I love this God uh you know God gets all the credit Hallelujah you know I heard a couple uh um heard a couple more people say they were the greatest of all time I went over some uh you know I heard a preacher you know I went back and listen to that the preacher who said we have the greatest young people of all time and you know uh you know people people want to uh try to compliment people they want to make them feel good but that's not the way to make people feel good is by flattering them you know that's not the way the Bible said flattering words worketh ruin the Bible says that's that will actually ruin a person by telling them how great they are all the time right now we know people sometimes want to have some roses right brother said I'd rather give them a rose now rather than later when they're dead you know uh we understand that that's a that's a that's a principle as well too we want to tell people how much we appreciate them but see when it comes down to it you know the Bible says here with with with Israel it's God who left them a seed it's God who gave them another chance right it's God who gave us a seed and we know the real seed is the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen except God had given us the Holy Ghost we had all been lost praise God we've been made like unto Sodom and Gomorrah if it wasn't for the seed of God hallelujah if it wasn't for the word of God we'd all be lost Hallelujah so we see God's grace again magnified Hallelujah we all been Wicked or in other words abominable Sinners praise God if it wasn't for God's mercy would akan even have a message church right like brother Steve prayed brother Steve said I prayed for 15 years God would raise up a message church amen if it wasn't for God right there'd be no seed in acon Hallelujah but God was merciful praise God and of course you know I love you know the Ephesians chapter 2 that great phrase but God we were dead in sins and TR transgressions but God moved on this scene Hallelujah but God changed my life Hallelujah God changed your life amen we were all dead and sins and transgressions Hallelujah it wasn't for God we'd all been like Sodom and Gomorrah but God left us a seed God sent you the message God sent you the Bible Hallelujah God sent you the word of God God Gave You Grace God Gave You mercy God gave you chance after chance after chance it was God who did it hallelujah amen except God had moved on the scene I'd have been like Sodom and gomorah amen and God of course you know Paul is applying this of course to Israel but we know the same is for uh the Gentile because we'd already read it there how God said you were not my people but now you're my people hallelujah you are not my children but now you're my children amen hallelujah like we had nothing to do with it it was God's mercy and God Grace Hallelujah and we're going to see in two chapters God there's a re one of the reasons God does it is to make Israel jealous right that's one reason God did that was to make Israel jealous in other words Israel like a blind Jewish Israeli illegalist would look at the the the Christians and see the liberty of the Christianity and the power of Christianity and they would be jealous right because we have freedom Joy power love we have all these great blessings so church we should live in such a life where people should be jealous of our Lives amen I know they are I I know like I've told you before I know people have told me well I wish my family was like yours or I wish we had a church like yours I've had people tell me that right so I know there's some spiritual jealousy well that might be a good thing right it might stir them up or something like that right you know we've had people like we remember Sister Connie she moved all the way up here because she wanted to be a part of the church to believe this now of course then you know things change but think about about that I mean people would would travel and go great distances I drove three hours one way because I wanted a spiritual walk like brother Brooks had every Sunday that's six hours Hallelujah right it's that it's that desire to be like Christ hallelujah amen and so God is gracious God is longsuffering God has given us the greatest thing that ever was a relationship with Christ Hallelujah a spiritual position as a Christian is the greatest thing we could ask for praise God God and church remember whatever we do now is what will be later praise God just like Samuel he was a prophet uh before death he was a prophet after death amen let's be a real saint of God now and God will have many blessings for us later as well praise God let's make our calling election sure praise God Amen verse 30 Romans 9:30 what shall we say then that the Gentiles which follow not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith so we in other words we weren't following after it we were we were Sinners the Gentiles were but God left us a seed and God let us achieve something that we weren't even looking for Hallelujah right that just that just that just screams God's mercy that's just to me that just shouts God is gracious God gives you something a reward you weren't even really looking for praise God Hallelujah by and we looked we of course we finished with that on Sunday morning Hal you've attained God's righteousness in other words in heaven God sees your righteousness because it's Jesus's righteousness he shared with us right you have attained it's something you can say I've I've attained that I've attained it by faith Hallelujah God's given me his righteousness he shared his righteousness with me but like Paul said I'm pressing for the attainment of the first resurrection that's what I'm pressing towards Hallelujah and so see we didn't follow after the righteousness uh of the law like the like the Jews did or Israel did uh we didn't have the law of Moses and it's a it's a shame we didn't because Paul said the law was a good thing right but but trying to uh trying to fulfill the law with our flesh was impossible right but see now we attain righteousness because it's God's Gift I'm looking forward to preaching chapter 10 chapter 10's really beautiful but I'll just let me just uh share a little early by God's grace the Bible said uh you know the gospel is so simple he said the word of God is nigh to you even in your lips Hallelujah you don't have to ascend up to heaven to get it you don't got to descend down to the The Depths to get it the Bible said the word is in your mouth and church that's that's how simple faith is I believe it praise God well if God promised it I believe it praise God I'm speaking of the righteousness of God I'm speaking of faith I'm speaking of the fact I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost all these blessings God has given to us just speak the word hallelujah amen all these Needful Things that that are so important to the Christian walk having faith being justified Sanctified being filled with the holy spirit all these things are just freely given to us and it's by faith Hallelujah just believing it knowing what God Said is true Hallelujah God will back up his word amen now I'm just that's a beautiful part of chapter 10 by God's grace now Romans 9:31 but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to that law of righteousness why wherefore why why not because they sought they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone Hallelujah now you and I when we come to Christ Christ was not a stumbling Stone Christ was a stepping stone right cuz Paul he said I'm the foundation he said let every man take heat how he builds upon the foundation so when we come to the gospel the gospel became a stepping stone for us in other words we found our position in the body of Christ as leot and Saints right of the seven Church ages we find our position and we can go a step higher in God hallelujah but the Jews stumbled over the gospel they stumbled over Christ and the Bible tells us why because they didn't seek it by Faith by which is trust or Assurance it's a spiritual transaction praise God faith is a substance hallelujah how many have the substance of Faith tonight it's something like it's inside of me Hallelujah yeah do I battle you know my flesh and my mind yes but if I can just get past that if I can just talk it over with Jesus a little bit then I can feel that I have faith inside of my soul hallelujah amen see they sought it by works so they were trying to work their way into feeling God's righteousness and that will never work you'll because you'll never have enough works to feel righteous now I'm talking about the righteousness of Salvation Hallelujah I'm not talking about you know our daily righteousness that we should strive for in other words doing what's right right I'm talking about righteousness by faith Israel stumbled at that it was it was too simple for them but now of course there's a reason Hallelujah there's a reason they stumbled at it let's go to Matthew chapter 15 why was Jesus a stumbling Stone let's review this just briefly here by God's grace verse three of course they're talking about washing hands why don't they follow uh the the traditions of the elders verse three but he answered and said unto them why do you transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and and mother and he that curses father mother let him die the death okay going down to verse 7 ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draws nine to me with their mouth and honor honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men now this is why as message Believers we should be so thankful that everything we believe is in the Bible praise God right and that's why I have questions answers on Sunday night I want to know what's on the people's heart and I want to know if I'm wrong I want somebody to correct me by God's grace right because here's the point I want to get to tonight I don't want to become a Pharisee right it's it's very easy for for for people to fall into Pharisee religion especially in the message right it's very easy and I put this on my podcast this morning when I put up the podcast you know I used to say this you know uh We call we call our our following the message right well some people somebody came up with this and they called it this is the mess age have you ever heard that before mess age and I used to say that years ago but now I don't because I've kind of matured past that because I've realized every age is a mess age because there's very few people actually saved and preachers would use it to bash other message churches and church I don't need to bash them they already they're they're already bashed right I mean they're already disobedient to God uh I feel like people have used that um this is a mess age to kind of just blast the overall age I don't want you to be discouraged I want to be I want you to be encouraged by God's grace Hallelujah I want you to be The Shining Light I want you to be the city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise God we don't judge ourselves by other churches you know the Bible says you can follow other churches in other words get some inspiration but let's let's strive to be like the early church Hallelujah that's what we've always tried to do amen we've always tried to strive to be like that early church to be the example Temple praise God to be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden and not to go into Pharisee religion and I'm talk and even cam you know shared a testimony with me that uh at their Church you know cam recently preached and he said the Holy Ghost fell when he was just trying to he's just trying to labor on it's not by works it's not by works it's not by works and they got a nice breakthrough so I kind of want to bring a little bit of that inspiration here tonight hallelujah it's just that it's that reality that it's by Grace amen it's by grace through faith Hallelujah and sometimes we we we there's two remember there's two kinds of righteousness I preached on it last month there's a righteousness that we're given by grace in other words in the standing of God we're the we get we already are the children of God hallelujah and see that ought to raise our faith for whatever trial we're going through in life Hallelujah to know that I already have the righteousness of Christ now in my daily walk yes I want to live a righteous life but remember church as soon as you confess and say sorry and you're trying to draw n to God and resist Satan then you're back you're back at a perfect condition Hallelujah you're you're free from sin Hallelujah but but you know this people you know this is why they stumbled at Christ because he was against their Traditions right and I'm just going to name a few you know I named them before but I I've come across some new CH new uh uh Pharisee mess is Traditions I didn't hear about anymore now I've already said these to you before um short sleeves on men used to be like in some Churches that's sin you cannot wear short sleeves now show me that in the Bible right right but it becomes such a legalistic thing it becomes a Pharisee religion here's one you know some people said to I don't know maybe I share this with you or not I don't know but it was a sin for women to to wear shoes that show their toes some Churches have that legalism women cannot show their toes in the church uh it just it's it's crazy it's crazy I mean that's all they wore in the in the Bible is Sandals right but it it's a you know it's a man-made thing well we're more holy right uh one of them that qu it's I don't know if I shared this one before but a lot of M churches say women cannot wear skirts that have zippers in the front because it's too much like jeans it's like a man's clothing and they will they will preach it like it's you're wearing men's clothes if your skirt has a zipper in the front I'm like where is that in the Bible can somebody show me that in the Bible and and just because well it kind of looks like jeans and I can't tell if it's a man or woman well look harder look at the hair then I mean where does the bible say a zipper is is a Abomination the sight of God you see it's to build their own righteousness one church I even listen I heard the preacher say this he said if a man uh if if a man gets a cup of coffee served to him from any other woman other than his wife it's like potentially adultery it just what where is this where what about Jesus remember all those women fed him and they just fed him you know they where where where do people get these things right here's a new one I never knew this before uh men wearing pink clothes to church is a sin that's what people have said lately now I knew brother BR makes he says pink a couple times he was talking about how men they they wear pink suede shoes and he says what kind of man would wear something like that right and so I can see you know I knew that and so that's why you know that's that's always been in the back of my mind right so I've never you've never seen me wear pink when I'm preaching and I challenge you go check just because of it was a question in my mind but where where is that in the Bible the church say you see now for me if there's any question well I'm just going to leave it alone right but I you can't preach it as a Bible Doctrine we're talking about the righteousness of Christ here tonight right keep your mind on the Bible right because we here's all these ideas now what's the Bible say and see see how phariseeism can so easily get into a real good church it can just slip well there's one quote well yeah there's lots of quotes I just found a quote this week where brother man said Sinners will burn in hell eternally brother BR said they'll burn in hell eternally but then you know he he he gets the Revelation later right he's he's growing he let's let him be a man let's let's let him grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord hallelujah remember Church don't forget Martin Luther wrote some things that cause some people to burn down Jewish synagogues right some of his mistakes that he made right and yet he's one of the most famous Christians and had some of the greatest impact ever on the the church the New Testament Church people say it's so hard to measure his impact because being justified by grace through faith was such an amazing Revelation where' he get it the book of Romans amen hallelujah and then of course there's there's two I put out this or the last few weeks uh the brothers from Ghana emailed me this they said Flatt top haircuts that's a sin and that that that's become legalism in some Churches and so I went and looked it up brother Ram condemned it eight times I think I preach it here a couple weeks ago but then the last two they asked him directly is it sin he said no brother he said you just wait till you're my age he said then you'll have a flat top because you'll lose all your hair but he says no brother that's not sin I just say things like that okay so that's what he said I just say things like that now here's Here's my thought brother ROM saw all these rich people what was the trends what were the trends of the day you know haircuts and or you know flat tops like you know some of the famous guys I don't know Elvis haircuts and so whatever is kind of trending he just blasts right but when it comes down to it he says I don't have any scripture for that as long as he cuts his hair he's all right and the church said but that has become legalism in some some American churches too not not just those brothers from Africa that email me right the other one is floor dancing did you see that video I put out brother R says I don't believe in floor dancing and some Churches have have read made that quote Into You Can't Dance by The Altar and the word altar is not even in the quote but somebody's mind just made okay floor dancing must mean you can't dance by the altar it's not even in the quote if you read the quote brother's talking about a man a man can't hug up on a woman and if if if she hugs up on him and and her body parts such his body parts he'll have Sensations right which is sexual I mean Temptation right that's true that's true but that's what brother ramom is calling floor dances now when does that ever happen at any message Church you know where a man is hugging a woman Let's Dance right can you picture it if I'm married to my wife and I'm you were not going to dance like that in the church but how can how can that happen people are trying to what establish their own righteousness pink shoes shoes that you show your toes short sleeves is a sin they're trying to establish their own righteousness and I'll say another one this I know this one made me really unpopular but ministers have to marry virgins that made me really unpopular but that is those men those churches they're establishing their own righteousness and there's no Bible for it right because if you apply that you got to apply all all the requirements and then St Paul wasn't a prophet then because he had had eye trouble and a a a priest can't have a eye blemish well then you kick Paul out of it well now you lost almost all the New Testament you don't have much left you don't have modesty left because that's the only Bible verse on modesty is 1 Timothy 2:9 see what see what this is and that's what Jesus that that's what he he was preaching get back to the word back but they had they buil up their own traditions of men he said then in vain you worship me and then Jesus became a stumbling Stone because Jesus was saying get back to the word back to the word it's only the word you must keep God's commands not man's commands Hallelujah now I've always told you this if I if you want my opinion I'll give you my opinion on something right so that's my opinion I won't wear pink when I preach but I've worn pink to school on Valentine's Day I have one pink shirt and I wear that pink shirt on Valentine's Day because that's the color for Valentine's Day you know it just doesn't it doesn't condemn me right right but I can't find any Bible for that so this is what you know this is some of the thoughts I had that can relate to us because it does relate to churches like ours if we're not careful we establish our own righteousness okay but we must understand that God's righteousness comes by Grace it's a gift of God like that song I didn't earn it I don't deserve it right still you give yourself away oh the precious love of God Amen see that that's that's where righteousness comes from it's the gift of God and we must seek God's righteousness by faith in other words if God said it then I believe it praise God hallelujah but see people stumble because they create their own doctrines of men right and what they've done is they've added their own ideas and they and they take out the word of God and God said I'm going to to call you a liar on the day of judgment if you do that if you add any word Proverbs 35 and6 if you add anything or take anything away I'm calling you a liar that's why I put on that video anybody who adds three persons or anyone who takes out modesty God's Gonna you have a lying Spirit on you they're Anointed with a lying Spirit may God help us to have the spirit of truth hallelujah right or the spe of erir er means an evil spirit that'll take you in the wrong direction may we stay on the straight and narrow path Hallelujah because Jesus is the way the straight way Hallelujah the way the truth and the life so see Israel stumbled at this because they had their own traditions of men and we must not become uh message Pharisees Hallelujah like I told you you know last week uh I emailed a brother who's an internet Prophet you know and um and he he called me he calls me a Pharisee he says thee Pharisees from akan Ohio that's what he calls me and I email back I said brother you're the faracy because you've created your own traditions of men he doesn't go to church he don't have a pastor he preaches you can't wear pink men can't wear pink he said thus sayith the Lord you have to take down brother Ram's picture in your church because it's uh it's now uh it's now wrong in the sight of God now where is that in the Bible see it's and then you know he'll make all these ballpark prophecies where there so General anything can be the interpretation of it well that's easy to see right but I caught him in some in some some prophecies that failed I called him and that's why I waited I waited until I got it and then I emailed it and now he just calls me a Pharisee but really he's the Pharisee because he's creating his own traditions of men right and he says I have a double portion of brother Adam's anointing well brother Adam's anointing made him go to church every time the doors were open and if your anointing makes you miss church then you don't got the double anointing and I said if you look at the Bible the double anointing is it's double Miracles Elijah did eight Elisha did 16 I said you better get started pretty soon on raising cripples from the other wheelchairs because brother R had a lot of those and uh children that had crooked eyes a lot of them went straight you better get started on that because that's the Bible interpretation of the double anointed Hallelujah and you know people can call me whatever they want but by their fruits Jesus said you're known Hallelujah and so we see this is what Israel stumbled they stumbled because Jesus showed them in the word where they were wrong and they didn't want to change their ways that's right now go to Matthew 23 this is just uh my last scripture here uh in this section here then we'll finish up the chapter I want to just close with a few things here by God's grace and church that's how I want to be I want to constantly examine my heart to make sure I'm not becoming prideful you I just read in I read was reading this week in Isaiah 28 and three times God told Israel you have a crown of Pride on right and that's where he said I've come in your sanctuary and it's full of vomit he said but how is how does the word of God come line upon line precept upon precept amen here a little there a little hallelujah amen and the Bible said we should not have the crown of Pride I think the Bible said to be the crown of the anointing or Crown of Glory that must be upon us because remember the Bible says the anointing breaks every yoke if you feel yolked up or you feel like you're addicted to something or struggling you know what you need you need the presence of God Amen because that will break every anointing Amen in other words just get in the joy of Jesus and all the anointing of Satan will be Broken Hallelujah how many know that's true by God's grace oh my happens in my life happens in so many people's lives just get in the prince of God uh and all your troubles vanish hearts are mended in the presence of the king hallelujah amen now uh Matthew 23 of course this is the rebuke Jesus gives eight woses to the Pharisees and woe uh is a grief eight griefs right eight judgments against them but notice in verse 1 231 then Jesus I'm sorry then spake Jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat right so the Pharisees will sit in the seat of brother brandham right for our day we got to bring this to our day they say they're brother braham's converts now so do I so again by your fruits you are known now these brothers some of these uh like I told you the goat preachers and everything like that now I respect them I just call them that because because they call themselves the greatest of all time but they they've been preaching that you know uh young preachers should come to them uh if they have questionable doctrines and run it through the elders and that is biblical remember the Bible said they took all the questions of the book of Acts to the elders but my question is what happens when the elders get a little prideful who's going to correct them right what happens when the elders start saying no such thing as uh uh there's no interracial marriage like they say what happens when the Elders break the word of God then who's going to correct them or the elders start saying I'm the greatest of all time we're the greatest what who's going to correct them are they open to correction is there going to be an Elders group to correct the elders see I mean they got some good ideas you know we should go to the uh more advanced ministers but what happens when they get some leaven in their midst see I I like the scripture I want the scripture by God's I'll follow the scriptural pattern if someone's been preaching longer than I've been alive well praise God I mean I wouldn't respect that what happens when they get off the word of God who's going to correct them verse two I'm sorry verse three all therefore whato they bid You observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not here's a clear sign of a Pharisee they say they tell you what to do but they don't do it themselves Hallelujah they tell you you do this but you don't see them he's going to say it later they don't even lift a finger to help you out mean you can't even lift a finger and text me right you can't lift the finger and call me see they won't do anything this is the sign of a Pharisee remember these are the same guys that got upset if Jesus healed on a Sunday same guys uh that that that just they they they they purposely tried to find wrong with Jesus they got mad about miracles oh yeah the one the other one too I was thinking on the way here Jesus said uh destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in three days and they got all mad because Jesus said and Jesus said there's going to come a time not one stone will be left upon that Temple and they got mad and they brought that accusation at his trial because they love their building so much see again Pharisees don't come against my property don't come against my building right don't come don't come against us we're the elders we know all about it we sit in the prophet's seat Paul says they went at it the wrong way they tried to seek their own righteousness they tried to create their own righteousness rather than the righteousness of Christ you know why you're righteous because you believe in the cross in the church said Hallelujah you know why you're right righteous because you believe Jesus died for you that's why you're righteous well brother just I did that no stop right there stop right there the cross is enough Hallelujah cross is enough for me well let me tell you brother Austin I've done this no brother just no no the cross made me righteous Hallelujah the cross may be righteous remember the Bible said Abraham was righteous before he got the circumcision well that means us we're righteous when we're Justified hallelujah we're righteous before we're Sanctified in the sight of God we're righteous before we get the Holy Ghost we are righteous God declares us righteous before we get the circumcision Hallelujah That's The Power of justification amen verse three for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers they put all these burdens on everybody else you pray but I'm not going to pray you do all that I'm not going to do nothing I'm just going to sit back now in their case they they just sat back and had the nice long robes on and greet everybody in the marketplace and yes they've had their meetings and they would be there on the Sabbath but they put all the burdens on everybody else and wouldn't even lift a finger to do anything to help anybody right but all their Works they do to be seen of men they make broad their feries and enlarge the borders of their garments so they just you know outwardly they just tried to look as holy as possible and they only do things to be seen a men okay so where's the secret Works they didn't have secret prayer they didn't have secret fasting they didn't have secret giving everything was done out in the open so everybody could see it that's why church it's a good idea don't tell everybody if you're fasting right don't tell everybody if you're giving to the poor don't tell everybody all those things right try to keep some of that secret don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing and the church said and they love the uppermost rooms at Fe at feast and the Chiefs seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets to be called a men Rabbi Rabbi uh the owner of the barber calls me Reverend I said brother you just call me brother he says Hey Reverend I said just call me brother I'm just I'm I'm not I'm not Reverend I'm not I mean I'm I'm a Christian right but I'm not like God I'm just a brother right we don't need all these titles I've had to say that many times to him I'm just a brother I'm just I'm a just call me brother but these people love to be seen at all the big events right that's why sometimes Church look at the big events look at the big meetings who are the people being seen now the bi Jesus said try to sit lower and wait for people to let you come up to the front but don't put yourself up front right make people look for you at the at the big occasion right Hallelujah just hide away and don't don't try to be noticed we could use some more of that in the message right Hallelujah be not called a rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth right Catholic priest for one is your father which is in heaven neither be you called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant Hallelujah that's why church we just always in your heart always say God help me to find ways I can serve other people help me to be a servant to others by God's grace how can I help you how can I I told you this one time my when my superintendent first came in he would come to every classroom brother Austin he I don't know how he did this he knew everybody's name I'm like I could never be a superintendent because I'll forget everybody's name for sure is the world I will I'll forget their name two or two minutes after I meet him but he would come by he said hey Jesse said and he would end every every handshake with let me know if you need anything I was like wow that's pretty awesome and then when I needed something he helped me that's a pretty good m right there right so be the servant see if there's any way I can be a help to somebody who can I be a blessing to by God's grace but see the Pharisees are not that way they're not going to they're not going to try to lift a finger to help you out they're going to put all the burns on you and make life as easy as possible for themselves Hallelujah verse 12 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a base and he that that shall humble himself shall be exalted how what a promise amen that's why you know I'm just you wait with these greatest of all time people I'm just waiting God's going to Humble them God God will do it I just want to be a voice and say please humble yourself right and God keep me humble Hallelujah now he gives starting in verse 13 church he goes through some of the harshest words in the entire Bible he says you make your converts twofold the sons of Hell than you are these are some of the harshest words in scripture you're making them as double demon possessed than you are isn't that what we see like a lot of modern young people today I mean look at that you know they're n it's just it's hard to imagine you know the language and the things they watch and the things they see it's twice as wicked as their parents right maybe maybe more than that and they're fil they're filled with demons from such a younger age than their than their parents were Hallelujah but this is the religious realm he calls them Hypocrites yeah that's in verse 15 he said you make them twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves he calls him in verse 19 you fools and blind and then he gives eight woses let's read 23 and then I'm going to move on here he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tith the m and Anis and c kumin and have omitted the wayer matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought you have done and not left the other undone so they overdid it on their tithes and offerings right they overdid it on that they focused so much on tith and offerings money people right money hungry people now church I don't preach on ties and offerings too much if I do too much somebody let me know I try not to we got we have a wonderful faithful Church regarding those things but they spent look they spent all this time on money money money money they left out judgment Mercy and what's the other one I always forget one of those faith I always forget one see Works they were all works right tithes offerings works works works works works they were trying to seek God's favor through works now we we should do those things out of the love of God but we got to keep our balance in the word of God let's not leave out judgment mercy and Faith let's judge things the right way let's have mercy Hallelujah let's have faith in the word of God God hallelujah amen and Jesus also says they strained at a gat and swallowed a camel right so they got so focused on the little things that they basically swallowed up they had a big loss because they focus on such small minute details they made big huge errors because they went too far on things right and we got to be careful not to go too far on certain teachings right want to try to find a balance in the word of God all right now that was Romans 932 Romans 9:33 as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of off fence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed and the church said I believe on Jesus I'm not ashamed of what I believe Hallelujah there's no shame for me there's no condemnation for me there's no shame for me Hallelujah there's no no separation from the love of God for me this is what the word of God says hallelujah oh it's beautiful thank you Jesus now I'm closing with this here I I said all that to get down to this I meant to preach this on Sunday but Sunday I was just you know just uh you know overwhelmed with with no musicians and I always feel insufficient that's why and I am but I was just so you know I was just so overwhelmed with that wow when was the last time this happened and and you know I just felt like I wore myself out but by God's grace I got some good sleep but it made me think you know it made me think of wow with no musicians and no music it's like the beginning of the Gospel the day of Pentecost right or the early church remember church when Jesus the night he was arrested remember what he did after communion the Bible said they sang some hymns and then they went out to pray they didn't have any electric guitars right they didn't have any electric keyboards they didn't have any drum sets they could sit down Peter's like hey let me sit down on the drums and let me play Let me let me play a little tune here you know they just sang they just did Acappella and they sang some of the Psalms that David wrote right in preparation for the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane a lot of it was AC cappella do you think one of the guys were doing the beat box in the background he's like hey James can you handle the beat box here no no like let's lift our voice in unity to god let's sing a song Just Right From The Heart Hallelujah that's what it reminded me of and then it was so you know fitting too I was just preaching right through the Bible verse by verse from Romans chapter n did you know that's how the early churches were Colossians 4:15 says salute the Brethren which are in leoda and Nas and the church which is in his house they were sitting in someone's house just read reading the Bible reading the letters of Paul and when this epistle is read among you cuse that it be read also in church of leans and that you likewise read the epistle from Leo DEA imagine they didn't have a Pulpit like this they'd step out kind of like at my house remember we had house or church church in my house last year when the we had the big that that big freeze you know the brother would just walk up and say you know they'd have their prayer whatever sing you say okay we're going to read the word of go we're going to preach our sermon today I'm just going to read Paul letter they unroll the scroll uh to the Saints in Ephesus in Christ Jesus blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ and that was that was a service reading the word of God no fog machines no lights no turning up the volume or turning it down no live stream right it was just the Simplicity of the Gospel the word of God the Saints in one place Hallelujah one place and one Accord Hallelujah that's all that's all that was required gather together more you see that day approaching gather lift up the prayers lift up read the word of God so preaching through a book of the Bible that actually most resembles the early church right because that's the only word they had remember they didn't have the full New Testament they just had a few Scrolls that they could glean on every week of course there was preachers that would take that and then preach off of that no doubt about that but Church our hearts it just reminded me that our hearts are being turned back to the apostolic fathers amen so I was thinking all this on Sunday morning no instruments no worship I'm sorry no no no uh no instruments no electricity that's the word I'm looking for and I'm preaching verse by verse and think about that church that was enough to keep them even in the face of death penalties being arrested that would keep them that' be be enough you remember this I told you remember brother Keith Randol remember him him and his Pastor brother CLM who passed away they went and preach in Pakistan one time and the Muslim population is so violent there that in their services they could only whisper when they sang and no instruments and when they preached they had to whisper because there's Muslims on both sides above and under and if they find out their worshiping they get arrested and taken off to jail so imagine if your church service was this I Choose You couldn't even say Amen or else you're going to jail and they that's why I respect those Brothers they have they put their lives on the line that's no joke that's why no matter what we believe you know I might differ I might have some different doctrines I respect those brothers because I don't know how I could preach that quiet brother right how could I don't know how I could do it to be something but that's that's a kind of that that and that's more like the early church imagine all you could do is whisper and pray you couldn't scream or shout like we love to hear people scream and shout and I like I love to dance around this church I love the tambourine when we break it out too but those places you can't even have a tambourine and look the enemy could say well see you're not a real believer see you're not a real believer you're afraid to worship well am I who are you going to believe the devil or the word of God going to be the word of God see because we know the scripture sometimes the church is under great persecution sometimes they had rest so you have to see where do I find myself in the plan of God do they have any less Faith than we have I would say they they might have some more faith than I have because I really have to pray to go preach over there they live in it and they can't escape it yet they keep their faith strong we just reading the word of God whispering they don't get to dance they don't get to shout they don't get the praise of the Lord but but can God still move in a situation like that absolutely absolutely church we all know this is Leia if we're not careful we become spoiled and I'm talking about myself you know I'm talking about Sunday you I I don't have electricity I don't have any musicians and this was a thought I was encouraging myself with 1 Thessalonians 5:26 greet all the Brethren with a holy kiss no wonder they'd kiss each other on the neck brother Austin they could die no wonder they're happy to see each other they're surrounded by demon anointed Violent Men that'll kill them no wonder they'd hug on the neck and kiss them on the neck I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto unto all the holy Brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be be with you amen so think about that we have wonderful sermons but there was no third pole sermons in those days there was no seven seal servant yet the book hadn't even been written yet yet God could Supply them abundantly just by reading the word and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit coming off the epistle Hallelujah just coming off the plain word of God that ought encourage us we can just remember Church open our Bibles and God can speak to us right there in the security of our home the warmth of our home the privacy of our home God can speak to us right there in the midst of that God is able to do that in fact that's how the early church was built God meeting with the individuals in these home Gatherings these little gather these Upper Room Gatherings Hallelujah no instruments no shouting no dancing no running no clapping sometimes right if there's persecution on remember brother Bram called This Book of Romans he said Paul couldn't go into those great deep messages that he did to the Ephesians they did to those Romans to teach them the Deep things because they wasn't able to take it and church if you can receive these sermons on Romans that proves you can receive the Deep things of God that God has loved you so much God's opened your eyes to receive the deeper things of God hallelujah like predestination right we saw that in chapter eight there Hallelujah oh my about Abraham walking we walk as Father Abraham walked these great deep things of God hallelujah justification how about Romans 7 deep uh when I sin brother Austin it's not me it's sin that dwells within me how about that that's pretty deep isn't it don't let yourself get beat up don't get the don't let the devil accuse you well look what you did look what you did you can say it wasn't me wrong person sorry what do it me Hallelujah it wasn't me it was the sin that dwell Within Me praise God you can you can quote that scripture Hallelujah these great deep things of God and see then you can move on and you can remember I'm an adopted daughter of God I'm an adopted son of God I've got Authority I've got power Hallelujah I've got favor with God God favors my prayers amen God hears my prayers I love this quote this will be my last quote here brother R uses this one well maybe I'll do two here last two quotes brother BR said I was reading the other day in broadbent's Pilgrim Church I have that book I used it to write uh chapter 7 in my uh 2021 book he says in the early church they never had any ornaments never even had an altar so brother was reading in the early church they wouldn't even have an altar in the church church he said because the pagans that got converted they used to fall prostrate at the altar right they used to set up altars they would sacrifice animals at the altars right and so when they came to Christ just even think of laying down at any altar that was such a mind battle they they couldn't even have an altar in the church now now me that doesn't bother me right it probably doesn't bother you whether you kneel at your chair or kneel here because as Sinners we didn't bow I didn't bow down to the TV and be like I'm going to worship you TV but I was right you didn't bow down at the theater and say I worship you theater I wor so this doesn't bother us but brother Ram says in those days that was Pagan worship you had an altar you bowed down to so the early church didn't have any altars in it that's why it's not a sin to have it if it doesn't hurt your conscience there's no sin in having an altar he said they used to fall and prostrate at the altar he said they just had a plain little old building where they sat on a slab of rocks and you got a nice cushion seat there now they're getting kind of old right we've been here we've been here since 2015 these chairs are about about eight years old now right eight years nine years old maybe they're not as soft as they used to be but he said they used to sit on old slabber rocks they raised up their hands after some godly man gave a message and they raised up their hands and praise God they love the after effect of the Holy Spirit bathing through them Hallelujah a man preach and then they would stand up and sing with no instruments and they love to feel the Holy Spirit bathe them in his presence Hallelujah this this encouraged me on Sunday Hallelujah I didn't get to preach it but encouraged me God can visit us in any condition right it all depends if all depends is my heart in a condition where God can visit me am I trusting in my righteousness or am I trusting in the righteousness of Christ that's how the early church was set up meeting our homes they didn't have Al they did not have altars they just had preaching prayer and then the afterwards worship he says that was that early church in the times of irus and Martin so forth right after the death of the Lord Jesus when the church going on before in Catholicism oh that's what we love and the church said brother Ram closes the service uh in Jeffersonville in Humble thyself he said let's close our eyes and just sing that in the spirit now till we meet till we meet till we meet at jesus' feet till we meet till we meet God be with you till we meet again he said we're just children God's children let's hum it then they hum the song that's what we're going to do tonight I'm going to tell mus musicians don't come up tonight because I want to get back some of that reverence that I was uh Desiring you know I would like to get back some of this reverence of the early church and just try to feel just try to feel the presence of God without without anything with just a humble Heart of Worship because that's what the early church did Hallelujah the early church didn't need anything else they didn't need anything extra now we we love it we appreciate it they didn't have to have this didn't have to have any anything like this they just would hear the word of God and worship and they could feel the after effects of the Holy Ghost who wants to feel the after effects of the Holy Ghost I do I want to feel God I want to come to church and I want to know God heard our worship here tonight we heard the word of God the word of God is changing my life amen like the Potter amen and The Potter's whe praise God he's changing my life I'm understanding God more I'm growing in wisdom I'm growing in in my love for God and I feel the effects of his holy spirit brother raham said oh how that brings the spirit of God to us could you imagine the early days when they sat on slabs of rocks God be with you till we meet again let's stand to our feet and Malachi you just stay right there amen how many believe that that just humming brings the spirit of God to worship anybody believe that or does anybody think that was just for brother bram's day does anybody or that was just for the early Apostles day God doesn't send his anointing on humming anymore think about that we've only electricity for how many years brother what how many years has it been since uh Edison anybody know Edison lifetime Mal Lydia that's all they had was just God's presence they couldn't rely on anything else that's all the early church had they just had the word and they had the Saints and they wanted the they wanted to feel the after effects of the holy spirit so let's bow our heads here for a word of prayer now before we pray let's hum I love him I love him because he first love me how many just love the Gospel of Jesus Christ I just love preaching it I just love reading it Hallelujah I always always get something out of the word of God something I felt like I never saw before I've forgotten I'm so thankful God has reminded me of it Hallelujah like this idea tonight I don't want to be a Pharisee I don't want to add to the word of God I don't want to try to establish my own righteousness like well now God will love me because no God already he already proved his love to me because he died on the cross in his son Jesus he already proved it I I can't earn his love there's nothing I can do brother Austin to get more of God's love he already loves me eternally Hallelujah and because of that I want to express my love back to him and tell him I love you Lord
