TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here let's go to joshua chapter 16. i'd like to continue ministering on the book of joshua series we're almost towards the end here and uh tonight we're willing we'll do a children's bible study uh the plans will not be coming this week or next week but i know how much the children like it and we don't have sunday school so this is kind of like our sunday school so god bless you acts chapter i'm sorry acts sorry joshua chapter 16. sorry joshua chapter 16. so read our text our memory verse from brother stephen and then i'll have brother william pray for the the word how about that bro is that okay forgive me yes sir i'd like you to buddy i like you too i just don't want to forget this time so praise god let's have a uh return to the scripture joshua 16. now i'll read verses 1 through 4 myself and then we'll read 10 together and then we'll read our memory verse out of philippians chapter 2 verses 2 and 3. joshua chapter 16. hopefully these are the uh these are really uh wonderful thoughts to you if you didn't hear wednesday's sermon i encourage you to listen to that one we kind of started this thought about now showing how all the distinct boundaries were in type of the distinct new testament ministries that we all have and i ended with the apostle paul i'm going to pick up with the apostle paul and then hopefully we'll get to the sister's role as well because that's not cut and dry like some people think praise god so let's uh let's read our scripture here let me just check real quick if there's any uh anything i need to do so yeah joshua 16 here verses one to four let me read one to four please and then uh we'll read verse 10 together and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel and goeth out from bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archai to aderoth and go down westward to the coast of jeff la tai unto the coast of beth horon the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are at the sea so the children of joseph manassen ephraim took their inheritance look at that what is that beautiful they waited all those years but then they finally possessed it amen praise god they could say this day moses scripture is fulfilled praise god there was a day they took it praise god and that's what we rejoice in days special days where we inherit the promises of god amen whether it's you know i'm talking about after the baptism the holy ghost you get the baptism holy ghost and then you start pressing in and gaining victories that you never would have got in sanctification amen these are only victories you could get after you're in the promised land amen let's read verse 10. now here we looked at this on wednesday but notice they didn't drive out everyone and that was a type of us we can't drive out the sin nature in our in our bodies we can't drive it out but we can keep it under subjection hallelujah verse 10 let's read verse 10 ready one two three and they drave not out the canaanites that dwell in gezer but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute praise god let's go to uh philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. this was the scripture stephen chose he actually chose uh philippians 4 and that was the one sister naomi had chosen two years ago and he said if you've already done that one he said use this one instead so i said okay we'll do the new one instead by god's grace philippians 2 verses 2 and 3 just a beautiful again portion great reminder of how we ought to live a nice little summary of christianity how many enjoy uh the how many enjoy the joy amongst believers praise god that's what we should have as believers joy peace with one another if we have ought against anyone the bible said go to them personally right and then usually that takes care of it right if they're a real sensitive holy spirit christian if not they might fight against it and then that proves they're probably not part of us right because then jesus said after the third time kick him out of the church but usually he doesn't get to that usually the people leave by then right usually doesn't get to that we have to put him out from under the blood but we're thankful that god has a way to keep peace in the body of christ and i'm grateful for this peaceful season we've had here praise god thank the lord amen hallelujah so i'm very thankful church we've you know fought for many years you know with different things uh my wife and i could tell you you know if you want to sit down and hear some of the stories we try not to use names but we fought for many years just against different ones and uh we're so thankful for the peace of god in the in the church praise god and we ought to rejoice in that philippians 2 verses 2 and 3 such beautiful scripture let's read this together one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye may be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves i'm gonna have a need this morning they like remembered let's ask our brother william brother william could you just right there from your seat could you just pray for the word brother thank you jesus hallelujah we've got a lot of petitions yes you know the petition peace amen raise god let's get god ron applause amen praise the lord you may be seated by god's grace saints i'm a real quick um i've been kind of behind on this i'm going to click on my phone the link to the sermon so then i can share it with brenda because i still haven't reached out to her i just keep forgetting so forgive me you might hear a little bit of noise here just for a moment and i'm going to share the link i've been meaning to contact her it just slips in my mind every time i i think to do it um so you can pull up the slides here i have some some quotes and some scriptures and a few maps to show uh i think that will help our understanding i saw brother cam's on wednesday preached ephesians parallels joshua or something like that i don't know if he's inspired from us but uh it was neat to see that also i heard a brother from south carolina brother bill burley williams do you know you uh such birds you know burley williams sister okay okay so a few weeks ago he preached on uh joshua's borders lots and measures i was preaching a lot of the same things i was and we don't even know each other you know so it was neat i saw that on the online okay so here is the link okay i'm trying to click and share so just bear with me here as we get started here i'm just going to try to share this link usually the phone works great but in the time you want it to work fast it does not work in here so uh there we go okay now okay why don't you do me a favor yeah something's going wrong with my phone here so um can you do me a favor okay thank you sir come here uh go out in the parking lot maybe it's because all the wi-fi in here tap on that and then you know how to copy the link and text it to brenda thank you everybody appreciate that let's give maokai round pause thanks all my helpers in the gospel praise god amen you got it got priscilla you got aquila you got all my helpers in the gospel praise god you're you're all important praise god everybody everybody plays a part praise god we need each other the body edifies itself in love amen so let's look to the lord here i'll try to preach about an hour we'll see how that goes and trust the lord will minister to us by the grace of the lord so wednesday we looked at the beginning of chapter 15 and 16 and we saw how this types a holy ghost-filled saint okay so we read our text and the outline for chapter 16 i showed this on wednesday verses one to four is the boundaries for ephraim and manasseh okay and they were the sons of joseph all right and then verses five to nine is the specific borders of the ephraimites um and then verse 10 you have the canaanites dwelling among them under tribute very short chapters just 10 verses now i think it's just beautiful it's it's interesting church did you i don't know if you caught this but we saw chapter 14 the first tribe that gets the land is judah caleb was of the tribe of judah the second tribe that got land was ephraim and joshua was out of ephraim so the two men the only two men that made it over from the original generation their tribes were the first ones to get the hallelujah land like that because god rewards the first amen hallelujah god rewards those who stay faithful all those years we're going to read it right down here through the the scripture so think about that you know god's going to reward those old saints that have stayed faithful decade after decade although the deck uh the generations die and fall away these older ones keep pressing on they keep believing they're faithful they stay just as strong as they were when they were younger amen and they keep pressing on and god lets them see uh their faith becomes sight amen hallelujah praise god all these things they heard about for 38 40 years right all these things they've heard about long for they're the first ones that got the taste of the good of the land amen actually living in the land not just tasting and coming back as a spy joshua and caleb had done that but these get the taste and live in it permanently praise god that's gonna be my question at the end where are you living that's my question at the end amen because you're either living in egypt right thank you buddy you're still living in sin never really made a surrender thank you man okay never really uh come through true genuine repentance in water baptism people might have been baptized but if you didn't really come well thoroughly and all your taskmasters didn't die in the waters then you didn't come and you didn't fully repent praise god amen but the task masters have to drown and then you have the miriam spell dancing and praising the lord and uh and you know you started a new life amen your former task masters are dead and now you're following the pillar of fire you're following the prophet's message out into sanctification out into the trials and tests of your faith amen but remember church every day they had manna from heaven every day was everything was easy right it was an easy word it's easy it's easy it's an easy life their baby brother adam said your baby during sanctification because he's testing you he's training you he said but the fight really comes when you possess the promise of god you cast out all the fear and you go into the baptism of the holy ghost you cross over jordan and you say give me my mountain amen give me my possessions i'm not afraid what other christians are afraid of i can possess it because i'm a soldier i'm part of the army of god amen like we went to two churches maybe one insane vacation maybe one still at the red sea brother right but the one insane vacation was saying they're they're having trouble they focusing on church or the browns game come on church that that sanctification stuff if your mind is looking at the ohio state game or the alabama game or or florida game or if your mind's on the browns and things like that i have a great suspicion you're probably not the promised land amen because you're still dealing with the things of egypt but when you forsake those you left all those behind i don't know about you but that was one of my task masters amen hallelujah my football taskmaster that was buried in the waters or the blood of jesus christ amen not in bondage to that praise god we don't worship that think about that brother i think about this i just offered him that book instead of watching the game he could go read the book if he would have took it that'd be a better use of three hours wouldn't it church to read the bible and pray and listen to the word of god it'd be a lot better thing but see they're still out there and in sanctification and they say nice things they got some little victories in their life thank god for that they're looking for the coming of the lord but we have more than that praise god we have the possessions of the lord we have the portion the inheritance of the lord amen now church there are some promises we're still longing for but many promises we possess amen you possess real holiness amen you possess real joy real peace real long suffering these are things we're not hoping for we have amen god for that church the first one went to they were actually praying for the pope of rome they were praying to mary they're reciting creeds it was really something and i was just praying god give me the words come out of her my people right that's how we were just intercessory praying for them they spent 55 i timed it they spent 58 uh with the incense and singing their songs and getting the uh the bread and wine ready to be changed in the body of jesus and the blood of jesus and they spent one minute going up there and people are so tired and they're like they go up there get there and come back and then they get a few announcements and they leave and then and then we're out in an hour and four minutes i timed it we got there nine and left at 1004. that's when the sermon ended and there's no joy there's no freedom of the laity praise god there's no move with the holy spirit praise god but see we get to enjoy the blessings of god see that proves we're out of egypt praise god we're out of idolatry and statue worship amen and mother worship amen we're out of that we're through the the wilderness and we're possessing real christianity amen we're fighting real battles amen overcoming every day with the power of god amen hallelujah it's so true you can clearly see that there's a difference between people who possess the promises and those who just talk about them remember that series i preached on the false prophets that's all they do they just promise you things but you never achieve them thank god we can promise and you can possess we can promise a word and you can walk into the blessing of it amen hallelujah praise god that's a great difference between our church and other churches and it's not because we're better it's because of god's grace now i preached on that recently how david was better than saul but it was by god's grace we're better by god's grace but not because of our own human efforts we just surrender to god and we just love god because he said he that loveth me is he that keepeth my commands amen hallelujah that's how you know the love of god when people long to believe god's commands and keep them that's a real lover of god amen so getting back here the ones who labored longest were rewarded first praise god they're rewarded first now this gives you an idea about the different uh divisions i'm going to zoom in i'm going to zoom in i know it's impossible to see that but just for an idea right now so we're at so judah we preached on judah chapter 14. later simeon's going to get a portion of judah because judah is too big for them they were actually given too much land the bible does say that okay but right now church we're on uh ephraim and west manasseh remember we already talked about the two and a half tribes on the east of the river jordan they chose not to possess the promised land they chose to live outside the land that's foolish virgin they purposely choose not to live in the promised land right they want a portion outside of the land which is okay that's fine they have their portion but they're going to miss out on the millennium all right they're going to miss out on that but here in chapter 16 now we have uh ephraim and manasseh possessing their land and so uh you'll see as we get to this here uh that that uh it'll make a lot more sense now here i'm zoomed in here you can see the southern this is the southern territory so here now is ephraim and then manas is up here okay so see judah has this this major portion there's moab so that's esau and that's a lot and lots of daughters is that interesting hanging right around the message right they're just hanging right around right there they're they're your family i'd say like that your relatives that you got to battle amen so uh we we we we you can see where we are here we're getting into ephraim here now that's this is the southern territory now here's the northern territory here's ephraim and then west manasseh you have issachar zebulun asher naphtali okay so that would be all 12. you have gad manasseh on this side and so there's your 12 tribes uh did they all look the same did everybody get the same amount of space no no uh does that mean god's not fair no no god god's fair god's just right the bible said god gives talents or gifts based upon each man's several ability praise god so god gives you a gift now think about this god gave judas to scare it great gifts the greatest gifts apostle brother brahm said he was a five-talent preacher because apostle is the highest calling in the bible and yet he had five talents but yet he couldn't be faithful with it he must have buried it in the sand right he must have buried it in the world well i'm not going to preach anymore i'd rather have 30 pieces of silver he buried that so see church not all those who have the great blessings and talents and gifts are going to be faithful with it so we shouldn't envy anybody because god knew what you could handle praise god god had to give judah a bigger one because they were bigger people right god had to have a smaller groups because there was smaller amounts of people praise god but then but still we must each be responsible with what god has given to us remember jesus said if you're faithful jesus will take what others have left and he'll add it to you amen hallelujah so don't be discouraged if we're small or if you feel small or a small church don't be discouraged by size be encouraged that you're in the land amen and drive out every inhabitant you can and god will add to your borders amen you're going to see that at the end of this book and it also goes in the prayer of jabez where he says expand my borders well how in the world could that happen some other brother would have to go into uh would have to go into debt and then you'd have to buy his land for him that's the only way it could be done right or some brother died and you take his wife through marriage right and then you take his land to the the land of the man deceased that's the only way but god has ways no matter how small or insignificant we see god has ways to reward us god has ways to encourage us the main thing is to be strong and a very courageous that no man will stand before you all the days of their life meditate do turn not to the left turn not to the right but meditate on the word of god and god will fight for you amen amen this is what i'm learning not to uh not to be envious of bigger churches never because i don't know what god has done in their lives i don't know if they're being faithful or not so the bible says some men sins go before them others come after. so that means some people we're going to see their sins on this side some people we are not going to see their sins to the white throne judgment so i'm not going to be envious of anybody i just want to be faithful praise god i want to be happy for them but i want to be happy what god's done for us amen praise god amen she must be grateful i don't care which church i don't care if i was the smallest one i wouldn't care if i'm zebulun issachar benjamin benjamin was actually the smallest i don't care if i'm benjamin there's little benjamins in there i don't care if i'm benjamin i don't care if i'm judah i'm just one of them praise god i used to live in egypt but now i live in the promised land amen i used to be a slave but now i'm a king amen hallelujah praise god amen i don't care i i'm born again christ lives in me the holy ghost lives in me praise god that's enough to make me happy amen i'm not going to worry about well this guy's got a bigger church or they got more let them have whatever they got i've got exactly what god wants me to have and i'm thankful for that praise god sorry guys i need to set up one of those spit shields right here forgive me i really try to watch that so forgive me we'll be breaking out the uh hand sanitizer forgive me forgive me sometimes i get so excited you know i just kind of all right let's skip ahead here now i'm going here isn't it's into wednesday nights i'm just gonna i'm just gonna be reviewing real quick here on paul paul had all five preaching gifts now what happens as we study the message is brother random grew in his revelation but some people will hang on to one quote and they'll hang on to it like it's life and death but if there's no thus saith the lord behind it or there's no bible backing on it well then they ought to just leave it on the shelf because of their own doctrines and their previous thinking they want to hang on to things so with this with paul when the quotes people hang on her brother and say you can't mix the offices there's quotes if you're a pastor you can't be a prophet which can be true it can be true with someone if you only have a pastoring gift or if you only have a prophet gift but the bible plainly shows paul had numerous gifts of the holy ghost praise god amen so we we understand what brother man is trying to say but people will hang on to these things and well i'm always a prophet or i'm always a pastor i can never evangelize that's not that's not the right thinking you should say i'm always going to be a pastor but the lord wants to use me in evangelism or want to use me on the missionary field he'll send me praise god right just like you would say i can see i have the gift of divine healing in my life or i have the gift of prophecy or i have to get through tongues or interpretation but god could use me for the gift of wisdom i do have the gift of discernment i can sometimes discern spirits on people and be right and recognize satan and cast down save but i could also be used for a miracle amen i better say out here i better stay back here today ah but he but see people get so caught up on their understanding that the the the books all the words in the books become their absolute instead of the word but brother brahm said i'm pointing you to the absolute jesus christ the word amen i just heard a quote yesterday what was i listening to where brother brad says i'm always learning oh it's adoption part 4 1960. he said i'm always learning he said he said i've kept the same revelations all my life like water baptism in the name of lord jesus christ uh like women with long hair and all these things he said he said god as he's he's constantly showing me new things he says and they always line up with the previous revelation he said i'm learning new revelations and the church said we ought to get the same new revelations but they're all the same they all line up with everything we've already heard amen so the bible plainly shows paul had all five gifts i guess i'm gonna try to go through faster here in one verse he says he has two gifts so how can anybody say he he can't be a teacher and a prophet he can't be an apostle and a teacher what the bible says he is so who's right your little uh your little people can you say p brain mind or is the bible right the bible's right church the bible's right you just have to realize there's a time and season for every ministry praise god see and then he says let's go visit the brothers we already have that's evangelism right now a lot of people confuse evangelism and say someone will go like if i'll go over to guyana or south africa or trinidad and i go to churches i'm not a missionary i'm an evangelist a missionary goes to where there's no christians and makes converts and sets up churches there's a great confusion a lot of evangelist thinks they think they're missionaries but they're not they're not going to get a missionary reward they're going to get evangelist reward but see they we got to go to the scripture to make sure we believe the truth here it says again he went through confirming that means making them stronger that means they were already strong but he just made him stronger hallelujah praise god and now here he does the pastor work because brother branham says now here we get back to judas brother brahm said judas sold out the opportunity to be an apostle the highest calling in the bible so on earth the highest calling is an apostle but now brother william help me on wednesday there's also though a higher level of the messengers right so brother abraham said paul pastored for 22 years the ephesian church that's what he said when he preached it but when he wrote the church age book he said he only pastored three years what does the bible say the bible says three years so which one are we going to believe the bible and you have to do that with people because every people say every word is thus saith the lord paul pastored 22 years well he said over here three years oh that's easy 2 3 25. now come on come on that that's what they'll do they will they will they will go to any lengths to try to prove every word is thus saith the lord like uh the one gentleman uh who goes to jeffersonville church on youtube he told me he said well he said the white horse rider was the holy spirit at the beginning but then he morphed into the antichrist later i'm like brother you you must not listen to the seven seals as much as you say you press play you must not press play play or you must been working while you're trying to listen to the seals or something like that you just missed the whole thing buddy and they'll try to say 1977 did end america and there was something happened in america before 1977 and there was only tree stumps left i'm like brother this never even happened but lamb said i see i saw all the all of america just tree stumps in a vision and i'm predicting it's before 77 well that didn't happen that was just his thoughts right he said that's just his prediction but they still try to say well yeah it happened somehow there were some wars and battles overseas no they they're they're blind leaders of the blind and they're straining out a net and swallowing a camel they have a religious and that's the hardest ones i was driving down the road brother william this weekend i thought that's right we're battling the hardest demons religious demons amen right if somebody was in here frothing or had satanic marks all over we could we feel real sorry for them and everybody would know they have a demon but the sad part is people can walk in here say they believe brother branham look nice as you and i and they won't receive anything unless you say brother brandon brother brandon brother brandon brother branham that happened to me last time i went to iowa a guy afterwards told the pastor brother brooks he said well brother jesse don't believe the message because he didn't say brother branham enough during the sermon oh come on when did brother say that when does the bible say that when did paul say say my name every time you preach that paul didn't say that paul said preach the word amen the word preach the word of god be instant in season odysseus and amen but you see you got criticizers because they got a critical spirit on them and you're never going to convince them i don't care what they say i just care what jesus says i want jesus to vindicate my life amen i want jesus to preach through me amen to preach his word and direct people back to the word of god amen and yes but we're under the ministry of brother brown the whole time we're doing it praise god so three years now here's what i added but like brother william was saying i agree that's good thought the highest church age influence and revelation is the messenger okay that's that's above the whole age so from 1906 to 2021 and longer if it's longer the main influence of revelation is william branham's message from jesus just like john wesley was before that martin luther the main influencer that's what brother graham says in the church but now the highest calling on the earth and the the highest thing you can be called the greatest um uh ministry you can be called to as an apostle and brother man said judas he turned down the apostle which is greater than a prophet ministry the apostle down here on earth is greater it's a higher calling because i leave your family you gotta leave your family leave your your houses behind your children behind you've got to leave everything behind and jesus said that's the highest calling in the bible hallelujah praise god judas turned it down but the other 11 received it and then matthias said i'll take his place i'll take that crown amen if somebody forsakes that i'll take it praise god i'm interested in working for christ amen hallelujah now brother random also says though the highest authority in the local church is the pastor and that's kind of what we did today brother william i'm sure he's noticed it i was telling him this we don't go to individual church members and try to proselytize them we don't do that now i kind of do that on youtube because you never know who's out there right you kind of do it on youtube but that's what brother brandon did brother brother uh neville had a radio ministry and it went to everybody didn't matter what church you were on you have to log in well this is my church's uh am radio station you know no it was everybody everybody in the hearing of it it was outreach and brother you know radio will reach those who needs at reach right god bless brother amen with the radio sermon recently really blessed him i agree there's been times i've heard things on youtube or a radio it's just been a great blessing to me i needed to hear that i was right in the path of god amen now thank god for those ministries praise god how many times does it help me just a sermon online no it's always a help because you're hungering for god sometimes brother i don't even know why i click something i'm like that's why i clicked it yeah roman catholic church or something like that i didn't even know why i clicked on that and there it is god's feeding me this word amen he's showing me signs he's helping me out praise god but let's just go through these briefly brother said the messenger to every age regardless of when he appears or goes is the one who influences that age for god by means of a word manifested ministry paul was that man so the the messenger influences everybody with the manifested word oh my who manifested like brother branham where i tell your address your doctor's name everything wrong with you what you did as a child when you got scared by a dog nobody could top that because that was that was the word manifested amen that was the word made flesh hallelujah anybody can't see that it's blind i don't mean they're not saved just means they're blind to the bride like jesus said they're lukewarm right blind right naked wretched miserable right they need a rebuke yes also in the church age book brother said they preached the second coming of christ but deny the advent of the prophet messenger though empowering signs and true revelation he eclipses them all right so see the the messenger's revelation is way up here everybody else is way down here oh it's okay brothers to smoke it's okay we saw a guy went to church he was smoking before he went in the church he was a deacon brother he was a deacon he took up the offering deacon smoking that's just that's fine that's fine that's what they say not for us that's why that's they think that's fine that's not fine but see revelation uh the revelation brother was so much higher because it was from the word amen it was the word of god just made plain the simple truce of god laying before us the prophet points it out and it's as if we never read it before praise god and it becomes brand new the bible becomes a new bible how come people never preach it because they're under the strong delusion the bible says brother brahman said it tells us any man that says a woman can cut her hair is possessed by the devil think about the message pastor that left and said that jeff jenkins i'm just going to say it because he they make fun of me on their youtube i'm not making fun of him i'm just saying it's okay to cut your hair but i said a man like that is possessed of the devil he said because that god says that's your glory and if god says it's your glory and man says it's wrong god is right man is wrong man's got an evil spirit he's speaking contrary to the holy spirit amen but it's revelation problems revelation from god eclipses everyone that's true now but we have the same pattern every age the light comes through a god-given man and then from there it spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught to just press play well that's not in there that's not in there my wife found a good quote the other day i was telling brother william i preached it years ago when i preached a church age series there was a man from georgia i believe it was brother evans and he would drive church from georgia to jeffersonville indiana every sunday can you imagine that and he'd have to leave right after the first service to drive all the way back to get home from work and my wife shared the quote with me was such a blessing and brother man he's praying at the beginning of service he said lord please raise up a messenger for brother evans down there that preaches the same thing i do now look at that brother man had enough confidence that god can raise up a man hundreds of miles away to preach the same thing that he was preaching in jeffersonville why because jesus is the same in georgia as he is in indiana amen because it they get both preachers get taught from the same teacher jesus christ amen they both got the same headquarters amen heaven hallelujah he didn't say well i just pray they'll start a tape church down there everybody would just hear me only and nope no other preachers so sad so you got to be a minister who's faithfully taught the word and then but all those who don't go out don't always learn how necessary to speak only what the messenger spoken but we've got to understand that it's spoken from the bible because if you say everything he said then billy paul is the promised joseph then 1977 ended america and we're just living in some type of a a a partial reality we're not really here right we're not really here you see it's it's just insane that people would say things like that but it's not every word it's the it's what the word the prophet taught in the word of god amen it was the revelation and the revelation come with thus saith the lord amen that's how you know he says this is thus saith the holy spirit not thus saith william branham is thus saith christ amen that's how you know but sadly not always not everybody who claims to believe the message knows that what the message really is right now look he talked about john wesley's day john wesley was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for all for their generation church what are we we are the living epistles we are the walking letters of recommendation that's what the epistle was and that in that in that verse paul's saying i don't need a letter of recommendation to accept the preacher he said the word that you received you are the written epistle in other words you're the proof you're the recommendation that i'm a real preacher ah your lives are the real proof that i'm preaching the right thing amen hallelujah you are my my epistle right we're brother graham's epistles because you have a local you have a messenger you know we are we are all the same our lives prove we're the true church amen that's why it's important to listen to what people do when i listen to those those sermons and those preachers what they're talking about listen what kind of life do they live because that really tells uh which ministry they're really under and most of the time it's the domination or the mother rome as we saw this morning they're literally under that domination of mother rome and the other one's preaching about the beast and don't you know just right down the street when the methodist failed god raised up others that's you and i church god has raised you up out of the ashes we rise yes glory praise god i raised up on the assemblies of god denomination ashes god raised me up out of there amen he said and it's going on through the years to this last day there's again another people in the land who under their messenger who's pointing to the word will be the final voice to the final age amen see we're under the revelation of the messenger so there's no greater revelation than what brother branham had we just sometimes will get new scriptures brother i'm never preached on all that is is more of the same revelation hallelujah now here's where jesus said the apostles reward is the greatest you know the rich man came and left and jesus said hey we've left all we followed you what do we get he said truly i say unto you there's no man that have left his house brother and sisters father mother wife children lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brothers and sisters mothers and children lands with persecutions and the world to come eternal life the highest reward ever listed is apostle who leaves everything behind in order to gain souls for christ so there's no higher calling in the bible than to be an apostle but as brother branham tells us an apostle can't come around and undercut the pastor even if they don't want the truth he said but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the bible see if it's not the bible order it's it's hebrews 13. i preached that numerous times right because the bible said your your shepherds will give an account for you on the day of judgment you have to give your account and then the pastor has to give an account for the church that's right right he said see if that's not bible order that's exactly right there's no one above the elder i have nothing to do with that what brother devil does here look he says nothing i have nothing i'm a prophet and here's a pastor i can't tell the i can't tell the pastor what to do now unless the pastor would say prophet can you pray for me and can you help me out but he can't take his authority away just i'm removing him that's like a denominational thing they do that all the time some guy gets caught in the uh with porn on his computer well i'm going to remove you i'm going to put you in a probation i'm going to move another guy here and that's a man that's that's that's not a man that's not led to the holy ghost see if brother neville wants to preach jehovah witness doctrine that's up to you and him if you want to preach anything you want to that's between you and him that's all if the congregation votes from there to preach that's all right that's up to him so we have different levels we're talking about we have a church age level we have a bible level we also have a local level of authority that's what people don't understand now brother look at brother my doctrine i don't preach doctrine out there nothing but just great evangelical fundamentals because i'm with the brethren they might differ with me and i just i don't give that out before the people here i just try to stay on that real fundamentalist of the scripture such as we believe but at my tabernacle they tape it if you want it you can have it if your pastor don't want you to have it take it don't take it see that's up to you look how respectful he was of pastors that's why we don't try to hey sn over at the at the catholic parking lot hey come over here i got something to share with you we we just go in try to be kind and say well i had a message for your past that's what i told the guy today i said i had a message for your pastor uh the father they call they don't call it pastor they call it father at the catholic parish i said i have a message for your father revelation 10 7 the mystery of god's finished i said that's my message for your pastor he said oh i never heard of william branham i said most people don't but i'm here to tell you amen but see that's why we don't i don't undercut other pastors i don't try to steal their sheep because if i if i convince them to come in somebody else is going to convince him to go out but if jesus calls somebody in here if jesus sends somebody in here then they're here to stay amen because jesus sent him here to get fed jesus came to give him the two pence right jesus uh healed up their wounds and poured oil and wine in there and said pastor you just you just feed them till i come back and if i owe you anything i'll give you the reward when i when i come back amen here in 1954 says many of you at your post at new to your church is tomorrow greet your pastors for me i'm perfectly interdenominational that's right i believe all christians are brothers sisters we should worship together it's too bad the bearers break us down and so forth and i have never at one time in my life ever knowingly to be guilty of proselytizing or telling a person what church they're supposed to belong to i believe that's a man's got a liberty to make up that mind on what church that he desires to go to see it's such a fine line right you want to witness the people but you don't want to be denominational because message people become denominational too right well my church is the only one that's got it you got to come to my church or you're not born again or something like that that's nonsense jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life amen if any man's thirst of any woman but thirst hunger he said i'll give no living waters of life amen it's not a building it's a person amen hallelujah that's what that whole sermon is about god's chosen place of worship brother branham ends that by saying he said if i'm going to point you somewhere where am i going to point you he said i won't point you to branham tabernacle we're just as bad as everybody else he says listen to it church he said i'm not going to point you to brad tabernacle they have as much trouble as anybody but i'm going to point you to the place where god placed his name that's in christ amen hallelujah jesus said i come in my father's name amen god place his name in christ in other words the holy ghost and if you obey the holy ghost he'll send you to a real church i would never be guilty of proselytizing telling a man what church to go to now there are quotes that say the messenger and the message are one but a prophet's human thoughts are not the message when when moses smote the rock and you bunch of rebels was that god's message no because it kept him out of the promised land god had offered in the promised land but because of his disobedience that proves not every word a prophet says is part of the message he wanted to go over but he couldn't because of pride but god said you exalted yourself more than me look what i can do look what my gifts can do see not everything a prophet says is the message of the prophet we find out when a man comes sent from god ordained of god with the truth thus saith the lord the message and the messenger one of the same because he's sent to represent thus saith the lord now look represent word by word now look word by word not opinion by opinion so he and his message is the same a domination man under the denominational octopus as we saw this morning he in the church is the one a theologian under theology made by some denomination he and his message are one church of theology a theologian it's correct see so denominational preacher is one with his denomination so is a real preacher one with christ hallelujah amen glory then when a man comes with us saith the lord he and the message is one and when elijah come with they'll say the lord he and his message became one just as jesus when he come he was the word saint john 1. so the word of god and the message messenger of the age was the self-same thing all the time that's right but not every word that he said just the message the bible message that he taught does everybody understand see this is why it's so confusing to these people that are spiritually blind they see word by word and they think every word on the tape is thus saith the lord or they think uh the message with itself same thing okay the word of god well brother man taught the word of god so brother brahm's word is equal to god every word does not say the lord well you've just misunderstood everything he said praise god you just misunderstood the whole meaning of it he's one with the word in other words every time you think of god's word you think of moses parting the red sea every time you think of joshua you think of the wall is falling down joshua didn't do that the message did that amen the word did that hallelujah not joshua's failure ai or his fear with the gibbonites that wasn't part of his message his part of the message was backed by thus saith the lord and it manifested the word amen glory the words of the prophet that are not manifested word are not the message because when simon preached it elijah tells god god i'm the only one left was that part of his message if it was his message was wrong if it was his message had lies in it or misconceptions at the very least because god said yet i have seven thousand not seven hundred seven thousand right because that's a joke because people asked brother around that about ten times in the questions and answers because he said the wrong he said the wrong number he said as a minister of the gospel i preached that many times and he said it's just a slip of the tongue he said you forgive me he said i knew that was seven thousand but see who's right is i thought the message and the messenger were one well shouldn't god say he's sorry because the messenger said he's the only one left no god don't apologize to anybody god's right he's the year amen he's the word he's the absolute let every other word of man be alive and let god be true can you imagine god apologizing i'm sorry prophet messenger yeah there's only one i'm sorry those other seven thousand i'll just i'll just put them out from under the blood come on foolish foolish for people to say these things what does it church see they don't spend enough time right here it's all press play i'm a mess and believer i'm the royal seat of abraham and they don't spend enough time right here i mean you understand the whole point of the message was to point us back to here and they know more brother of sermon titles than they do bible books that's wrong you should listen to the tapes but your bible should be your main feeding source and you should listen to brother branham but don't but don't exalt brother branham above christ right don't exalt the forerunner above the one who the runner who is coming after her damn right don't fall in love with the friend of the bridegroom fall in love with the bridegroom amen don't marry the best man marry the groom right oh mercy lord that's what we battle on this day that's what we battle that's what we battle so look at this jeffersonville says the prophet carries the word that's true but abraham said the prophet is the word but he also says the prophet is not the full word so see they take one quote and rally around that to try to get oh we're the only ones right everybody else outside of us is wrong we're the only ones right we've got the prophet we got the living prophet and we brother still our pastor but we got a son we have two pastors come on nonsense so we got down our knees see now jesus would have had to do that for he was the word now we're not the word the word of the uh look at that we're not the word we are brother we are not the word the word of the lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them that's the difference but jesus was the word everything jesus said was the word amen it was right it was true there's no lie in it praise god no falsehood in it we just receive the word we're carriers of the word we represent the word but we're not the full word itself only christ is the fullness of the word made flesh bodily amen glory amen but see they'll they don't they must ignore that quote and they just they rally around this quote see hosea he's got a mission he sent from the lord he is the word of god because he's carrying the word of the lord that is a true prophet of god so they exalt this quote but they threw out the other one see brother and was the word he was he was the word every word word by word the messenger of the word message and word same thing see how they lie like that see how they can't even have no discernment there it is again they can't even recognize the antichrist spirit making them exalt brother branham instead of worshiping jesus christ only they must forgot to read this one too this is the last day prophet will have such power before the lord that there be those who mistake him for the lord jesus which is what jeffersonville does there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this but don't believe it he's not jesus christ he's the son he's not the son of god he's one of the brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of god he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which john received when he was the voice that cried i am not he but he is coming after me any time they say every word on the tape is thus saith the lord they've just exalted john the baptist over christ do you understand what i'm saying what did everybody do that followed john the baptist well eventually john the baptist died so what'd they do they had to if they wanted to know the truth they had to move on to christ right after they had a choice do i sit here in my dead denomination i sit here in death or do i move on to the one the prophet pointed to amen we've got to move on to the war that's what we've done we've moved on to the one the prophet pointed to the word of god the holy ghost speaking through the word he deserves honor brother deserves honor just like john the baptist but no greater honor right than each other and then nothing close to worshiping jesus christ all worship goes to christ see it has to be but we can't make every word infallible all right let's get to joshua now everyone take a deep breath ready say brother jesse's gonna step off the soapbox now he's gonna that but church i'm defending you though so if anybody comes in here trying to spread that all that false lies i'm defending you i'm fighting for you praise god i'm here to protect your life and you protect mine with your prayers amen i need your prayers amen we benefit one another praise god joshua 17. now here's the outline church you've got your bibles well i think we'll hit a few okay i've got about 15 minutes left for my hour we'll see you know let's kind of see how that goes joshua 17. i just finished judges and it's really striking to see how far the people fall just you know years after joshua dies it's really really striking to see how fast they fall just like brother brown brother left the scene look how fast people fall they can't decide well who is there an eighth messenger uh is brother branham still my pastor is brother braham coming back they can't even decide these things because they're not praying enough they're not reading their bible enough see they fall fast because they're they're depending on someone else's revelation but you're the one who god has to get a revelation from the father himself jesus told peter no man no man glory no man has received revelation from me he said but peter you received it from my father above and he said flesh and blood has not revealed it and the gates of hell will not prevent prevail against the revelation that god the father gave you amen hallelujah the thing is they're getting revelation what they think revelation from a tape a revelation from a so-called pastor or so-called living prophet and they're really not getting it from the father because if they had the father's revelation no seducing spirit would deceive them it's impossible for the elect to be deceived amen impossible because you've got christ on the inside amen you can't deceive christ glory hallelujah one of these days i want to go back and listen how many times do i amen my own sermons here i just can't help but i'm at that baptist church and i'm saying amen amen brother i'm saying hallelujah i just got to say it when i hear something good amen that's cicum devil right see get that devil out of here get that dead water let christ dwell amongst us let heaven come down as we say let the prince of god fill this place amen that's what you do when you say amen drives away the demons and all things are possible amen to them that believe hallelujah thank god so verses one and two so we had ephraim in chapter 16. now we have manasseh the other son of joseph in chapter 17. now verse 3 3-6 should be familiar brother can preach on this last time he was here that last november december and he's coming next month by god's grace the daughters of zelophehad receive they finally receive it when cam preached it he showed us the scripture where they uh where they were they were pleading for and moses gave it to them but here in this chapter they actually possess it so i thought it was very fitting i wanted to i want to share some of the sister quotes that would encourage our sisters it's very fitting because that's what we come to in the joshua where sisters inherit land under normal circumstances they wouldn't inherit land but with this new ministry they inherit land amen with this new holy ghost ministry the sisters have rightful inheritance amen just like the brothers everybody has rightful inheritance if they just call out for it amen if they're willing to fight for it praise god if they're willing to battle and say give me my inheritance joshua will give it to them amen oh glory verses 7-13 the borders of manasseh are described including the inhabitants they couldn't look at three chapters in a row church judah ephraim manasseh none of the tribes could drive out all the inhabitants shows how every holy ghost saint is not going to be able to drive out every single sin nature inside of you you'll drive out a lot of them you'll drive enough out to live a really good life glory you'll drive so many out you're in a new land you have all these blessings you've got the corn you've got the ox you get you got you got your weapons you got all these all these blessings around your life but there's still a few every now and then there's some hindrances that you got to deal with everybody had to deal with that right and it's a type that you and i must battle against the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life all right verse 14 18. this is a beautiful thought i'm gonna get to this maybe wednesday i kind of feel like just to stay on joshua the complaint this is one of these beautiful thoughts i kind of mentioned on wednesday the complaint of the children of joseph and joshua's encouragement we'll get to that let's look at sisters here they have a unique uh they have unique borders our sisters do yeah look at verse uh look at verse three but zelo for haddad the son of he for the son of gilead the son of mature and the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of the daughters mala noah look noah's a unisex name see so a girl could be called noah in the jewish faith i just like jesse my name's jesse there's a lot of girls named jessie right give me a unisex name hogla or hogla milka and turza and they came here before ellie is the priest before josh the son of nun and before the prince is saying the lord commanded moses to give us inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them inheritance among the brethren of the father and therefore ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and bashan which were on the other side of jordan look at that church the si the five virgins glory the five wise virgins amen in the promised land that's what cam preaches beautiful thought came there and they say we were promised this by the prophet before we came into the baptism of the holy ghost we were promised possessions so give them to us so joshua stands there the prophet and eliezer the priest he's got the uremon and they say give us our inheritance and no doubt joshua and the priest said hey pray about this let's go before the lord and they go pray and they're praying all of a sudden they see the light start flashing on the on the stones and now he says yes yes yes joshua here it is and they go yes sisters here's your inheritance it says with this place in manasseh uh the prophet and the european the prophet and the word of god agree to give our sisters their inheritance amen as long as it flashes on the yerman thunder sisters that's your inheritance amen brothers too brothers too as long as it flashes with the prophet and the priest the european thunder which is the word as long as you get some supernatural light then that's your right as a christian so the devil can't say well no you don't get that you're a woman no well see you're a woman and you're a lower type of person than a man no you you sister your daughter's a hell of a dad you don't deserve that your husband's died or i'm sure you've never been married see it's your fault you're not married you're not really stepping in you don't deserve any possession and the holy ghost stands there and says no they deserve it and i give it to you with thus saith the lord so dave you're lying take your lives back to hell the word of god gives these sisters the right to possess their father's inheritance amen don't let anybody tell you you can't have what the word of god gives you amen hallelujah malcolm go get my my blue book and bring it up here could you buddy please i should say please i sound like i'm ordering people around please buddy please i guess i'm under this like strong anointing or something like that like a boldness i'm too bold forgive me lord anyways now sisters cannot preach from the pulpit but can speak basically anywhere else thanks buddy yep i appreciate that buddy thank you remind me i need to give you some chatter pucks remember that he does all in he's gonna remind me he's gonna remind me i know he's gonna remind me he'll share sisters can read scripture out loud for the preacher which many of you have done for me that can read the word there but it all changes when it comes here a sister can say thus saith the lord out there but all changes when she comes behind here a sister can say thus at the lord right here but she can't do it when she comes right here because this represents the authority of god this represents in the stead of jesus christ and we are all men all women all men and women we are we're awful representatives of our own or our own selves right we're not we're not magnifying men men are just as failure as women but because of the order right man woman woman's for the glory of man god has the order so god has that order so the women can speak anywhere else just not right here and she can operate all nine gifts of the holy ghost not church some of them are words some of them are words that means the woman's got to speak up and say something to him sometimes to a man that's right sometimes but you got to do it with the right anointing that's right that's right you gotta do with the right attitude just like a man a man should give o sister a word with the right attitude like brother william was saying so many preachers would say oh the people come up for a closer walk well you're just lukewarm he would that preacher would be derating or degrading the people you're just a lukewarm layer to say look they've been serving god for 20 30 years how could they be lukewarm they're faithful they're just they're weak up here they're just going through a season see so brothers should never degrade sister sisters should never degrade brothers we should show that common unity of love it's called holy ghost love look it up it's in the bible praise god that should have been shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost amen so if you got born again you will do that if you make a mistake you'll say sorry very simple very simple but most message people are not born again true it's just look at their lives and look look look what they fall into look at the false doctrines they fall into paul said damnable heresies prove they were not they're there to prove that those were not the elect i'm paraphrasing that's romans 16. when someone teaches a heresy that proves they're not elect and they can be all clean on the outside and rich and all kinds of money 100 million dollars they can all kinds of things that don't mean nothing to god sometimes satan gives those blessings now we know that dude all right now in the sermon five identification of the true church i preached this over there and that's when sister marie got healed from her bleeding preached the sermon brother over there a few years ago probably five years ago now a sister came in i didn't know she had bleeding problem i preached this i said anyone need prayer i said one of our identifications is power of the holy ghost and she said while i prayed for her she felt the blood the bleeding dry up in her body but in this sermon brother man says okay let's read galatians 3 26. if anybody gets it before i do read it go ahead and a sister starts reading it he said i said you can listen to it on the tape for all we're all children of god in christ jesus oh he said maybe i got it crossed up now let's see he says now here here i got it that's right read on sister he lets the sister read the verse right during the sermon now listen close then she reads it again and he just goes on now you won't find many of these but brother ram never shut it down he never came back and apologized and said it was wrong right i've been to a message church where they let sisters pray for the prayer request now they got to pray for from their seat but that was one thing i've never seen before i still don't know what i think about that but but that was just interesting it was numerous years ago by now and the pastor must be taking these kind of quotes like like this one but iran says this is again church ages someone wanted to know if it was wrong for women to testify or sing or give message and tongue interpret tongues or prophecy in the church no it isn't wrong as long as it comes in the place and order the church is in order the real true way to do it is uh speak with tons of things the message you're given before the message from the pulpit never during that time in other words while the holy ghost is ministering through me everybody else should hold back whatever they got but once i'm done then they can let their message go because it's meant to be a vindication of what was already preached or a discerning of something that we need help with in the midst right but see now look but women are gifted everybody say women are gifted ready women are how many times have i preached that i'm going to keep preaching that you sisters have gifts that we don't have as brothers right and you've got to invest in the gifts just like i've got to vest in my gift right you have gifts from god there's my hour so give me 15 minutes i usually say that and give me 15 more minutes you sisters have gifts with prophecy and tongues and everything but being a preacher i've seen a woman cast out a devil out of a man when i first come in the message now the sad part is 10 years later she's at cedar point and simon saw her wearing shorts and that really shook me i'm like how can this woman cast out a demon she can i've seen her sing in the spirit shout cry in the spirit song specials in the holy ghost people crying weeping praise the lord and yet 10 years later wear pants at cedar point and cast out devils it just proves the rain falls on the just and the unjust because i don't go walk around cedar point with a long skirt on and a woman's undergarments on do i well how can she can do it but we can't we would never want to but don't you understand what how is that okay and she still plays church she just still plays piano or organ for a church to this day to this day that proved to me too when god wants to cast the devil out he'll have me ready for it praise god because anybody can do it they just got to be under the anointing and it's got to be god's time in season but women are gifted with everything but being preachers that's right they're not preachers they're forbidden to preach in the church that's right take the place or be a teacher anything in the church but as far as gifts the women has all everybody say oh all those can occupy one or any of those nine spiritual gifts according to first corinthians 12 and it's under no bondage that her message should not come forth in its place you see each message waits for its time we are not trying to chain up the sisters and say you can't prophesy you can't give a word of knowledge we're not trying to chain them we're trying to set them free hopefully you already are free but i'm just saying if you're chained up we're here to set you free tonight to hear today by the grace of god you can do everything but it's got to be in its place it's got to be at its time and the right spirit now he just he talks about the the gifts that he says it's always an order but a woman does have the right just like those daughters of zelophehad they had the right to say give me my inheritance my dad had no sons so we daughters we get to inherit our father's uh heir we're heirs of our father give us the land from our father and the holy ghost said there it is you got it there you got tongues you got interpretation you got miracles you got casting out devils you got discernment you got all that land enjoy sisters and everybody shouted amen there you go praise god the sisters might have a land or gift that we don't know nothing about brothers don't worry sisters you have the right in this church you have the right it just comes the right order so in my book page 687 if anyone's looking you know i really like writing these you know i like writing these days like this i can i already know where i got it i can just go right to it i don't gotta dig through my computer where is that what what's the name of that file i know right where it is a word of wisdom is the chief gift because it operates all the others brother i'm taught that wisdom is also sound advice in the greek and it manifests skill and discretion and timely decision making wisdom is validated by the results it bears because jesus says wisdom is justified of her children so you look at what happens after you make a decision and if the results are golly then you had the gift you had the word of wisdom for that decision like a good example with amen and huh they want the wisdom of god when to move out see they're waiting on that word of wisdom see that's that's good you don't want to try to do it on your own you don't want to try to press your way into something right that's a big decision when you move the bible said wisdom has built in her house so a sister okay i got a little word wisdom for you brother this is how you should build this and that and this is the time you should do it which one of your brothers would like that you see that's what it is it's a word of wisdom that wouldn't be behind the pulpit it would be out somewhere in the audience or out yeah a pastor was telling me that another pastor was rebuking him for the the sports he let his children do and i gave him a word i said just don't let it interrupt sundays and wednesday nights and you can do it he said brother that was a word of wisdom i said well thank you i didn't go look at i didn't go looking for a word of wisdom i just told them what the holy ghost showed me and then i gave another brother word of wisdom because he said he had just decided to give up his ministry and i come in there and i preach i remember the message i preached on diligence and i preached i said don't give up keep investing you gotta do small little investments to get the major uh return at the end and he said he said that was a word of wisdom it turned him around back into the ministry because it's small little investments a little bit every day yields a huge return later that's what this book is this is this is how many this is two and a half years of a little bit every day just an hour a day two hours a day praying writing studying the scripture okay word of knowledge knowledge is your raw building materials to build the house right and wisdom and knowledge are always associated together jesus also calls knowledge a key that allows you to enter in the door of salvation or god's will for your life in other words knowledge is an understanding to possess god's promises and escape satan's devices to enter into the promise of god and it'll always be a bible-based knowledge now here's people confuse knowledge with discernment discernment is the one that judges the secrets and thoughts and tense of the heart the sermon is the one that tells you the secrets knowledge is just simple bible knowledge that you should know but you maybe don't know it forgot knowledge is the word it's the key that opens the door oh now i understand it because knowledge is the key to understanding that's what the greek says wisdom is okay here's the word now here's when you use that amen that's right so brothers how much how many would like a sister come up and say well brother you're struggling with this but here's a scripture here's a scripture that would help you out really you brothers are like that praise the lord your real brothers you're a real brother to your sisters amen and the example was well for me i saw a piece of paper that said first corinthians 6 12. and that opened the door to my deliverance from tobacco it says all things are lawful but not all things are expedient but i will not be brought under the power of any when i saw that scripture it unlocked a door in my mind wow my body could chew tobacco but i don't i shouldn't be a slave to it and that as soon as i saw that it unlocked and now i can know now i can enter into deliverance that's the god honest truth i never realized i could be free from that until i saw that scripture that unlocked the the door to me the other example was uh a brother was struggling there was a in fact remember that brother wrote that a legit paper that died i told you remember that he called himself alive and they died cancer remember that a few months ago that same man was in a church and he was criticizing a deacon because he being both deaconess deacon and evangelist he's saying you can't do that brother said you can't fix the offices this man is he's always had that evil spirit on him as far as we've known him of course he's but he called me up crying he's like brother jesse can i be both a evangelist and a deacon and i hung up the phone i said honey yeah he was just sharing about evangelist and my wife told me the exact scripture she just read it or something you have to ask her i get the detail mixed up but she said philip was both a deacon and an evangelist i called the brother right up and he started weeping and crying said thank you i'm now free from that demon-possessed man who's he's he's basically cursing the whole church and he died that way it was so sad but that was a pure that was a pure word of knowledge i can say came through my wife through me to help the preacher and he's grateful for it and to open the door no more torment from satan amen satan i'm leaving the torment behind i'm entering into the blessings of the lord that's what knowledge does knowledge is a key it opens a door of victory amen opens the door of deliverance praise god and wisdom is justified by the results that it bears amen through the key of knowledge go to acts 18. i'm trying to close but i wish i could close bar pulling see you got to stop pulling if you want me to stop start falling asleep on me then i'll stop after that no i'm just kidding acts 18 26. now i like when you pull you that's good that's great that's what we need praise god acts 18 26 i never thought about this until i was meditating in this on wednesday it's quite possible priscilla gave apollos a word of knowledge or word of wisdom or maybe even a discernment of spirit look what the bible says and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly day day how could they man and woman tell a preacher a baptist preacher mind you like you saw today how could they expound the word of god more perfectly if women aren't allowed to talk well women are allowed to talk as long as they got it right in their place brother braham dramatized it like this he said uh aquila priscilla came in they sat they listened to brother apollo's message he said i really like that baptist preaching that was pretty good message he said but come let's have a meal but man so they went and had a meal and they said carlos we liked your message but there's one that's going to come after us paul's on his way here and he's going to take you deeper in the word of god there's more than john's baptism there's more than repentance there's one coming after john who's mightier than him it's christ jesus the holy ghost and paul is going to come and preach to you the baptism of the holy ghost and brother said that's what aquila and priscilla told apollos so our sister said there's there's a more excellent way brother what was she doing the word of knowledge amen what's that the holy ghost is for the revelation of the word right word of knowledge paul's coming maybe it's a prophecy too paul's coming he's coming here to give you thus saith the lord he's coming here to baptize you with the holy ghost and god used a man and a woman amen not behind the pulpit but in fellowship and communion to expound unto apollos the way of god more perfectly just like the woman at the well she run down there and said come see a man like brother dixon he runs across him come see a man who told me all the things that i did isn't this the messiah amen [Applause] the bible said she could tell her testimony well he did this he told me that he did that then he said that and it was the messiah praise god so we see the same thing here they can speak and as much as they want as long as it's the word of god just not behind the pulpit and titus 2 verse 4 says elder women can teach the younger now some people take this little further than others like the denominations will have women actually preaching to the other women now that i don't think they should do that they actually get women behind the pulpit to preach to the other one i don't think that's the right thing to do if you go to go to titus 2 it makes it seem pretty simple what i've had this has been years ago when we were at not the previous we're not waterloo but the mo drive when we were at mo drive i had elder sisters come in and just have give a testimony service for all of our mothers and sisters that was i just thought well if they could if they can catch something if the if they're really hungry they can pull something out of that testimony so it's been years since we've had that but i think the last one we had here was sister kim browning i think was here years ago she did that titus all right i'm going to get there right before hebrews titus 2 verse let's read three they age women likewise that they behaviors becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children now look at this look they have a lot to teach look at this church verse 5 to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed so the holy ghost teaching of an older woman can teach or can keep younger women from blaspheming the holy ghost and that's something so i'll just say like this our younger sisters if you have any questions i'd recommend contacting the elder sisters talk to them after service now pray beforehand right pray beforehand and then go with a meek and humble attitude say could i sit down with you can we do lunch or something or can we talk for a little bit i just can pray about it you know i like questions beforehand um so this doesn't look like it's in the the church setting right how do i love my husband how do i love my children how do i keep the home those are things that wouldn't seem like i could be behind the pulpit it wouldn't be a woman preaching at women right i can't see that there's my 15 minutes so can anybody understand that says look are the boundaries are the boundaries all the same no no no some women can speak more than others because they have prophecy discernment right i've seen discernment on our sister karen sanders from lima that was beautiful prophecy i've seen prophecy out of her you know we have all these sisters can speak just not at the pulpit and you have a right to do it amen you have a right to invest in your gifts amen praise god christ is not chaining you up christ is setting you free praise god last one brother random are women allowed to work in public affairs when they already have a healthy husband children well i don't know about that i can't say but i have this feeling let me say i believe if i was a woman and know my husband was healthy at a good job i believe it would be a great pleasure for me to stay at home take care of my children and take care of the children raise them up love the lord and if i had any time away from my washington things i was going to do i think i would teach my children how to serve the lord now if you've got a debt or something that you're trying to help your husband pay or something something that you have to do well i think that's fine if you'll try to help him and you live a you live a lady i think it's hard now no no man that's got a good understanding wants his wife to get a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things like that but the woman has to get into that i think she ought to her husband ought to know that she's a genuine christian woman that she can be trusted a trustworthy woman now to say that she shouldn't work i don't know see there's no scripture to back that up i'm just passing that opinion but i think that if a woman wants to work and she wants to now i'm certainly against these women working these offices where all these businessmen they carry on tell the dirty jokes look at all these governors falling they're all they're all raping these women basically see when you get women in there they're not married to the man it always causes trouble women and men alone in offices and it's it's always causing trouble a nice clean woman sitting there and all these smutty dirty things told like i'm against that i think you ought to come out from amongst such stuff as that but if a woman can hold herself as a real lady trying to help her husband do something to meet some clothes for the kids or go to school or pay a bill if she wants to do work till that's over now this is not the lord because i don't have no scripture for this i'm just saying that be my opinion but otherwise i wouldn't think just because she wants to work just to run around and have more money to spend or or no run to bar rooms and drink and smoke and carry on i don't think she should do it i think she should stay at home try to be a lady and take care of the house god knows we need more women like that today when womanhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broke when women get to a place that our american women are today it's a disgrace the way our american women act i got a clipping out of the paper 60 percent of the boys that went overseas last war divorce from their wives before they come back their wives run off with someone else in those defense plants working look at that she's got no business in the defense plan see because there's too many men there dirty dirty smutty men right you gotta be very careful where the holy ghost leads you to work a woman's place is at home with her children and now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different when a woman's place is at home in the kitchen when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right let's stand to our feet here and you can stop the live stream i'm gonna say a few things musicians can come
