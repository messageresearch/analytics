[0:00] Sunday I like to look at how brother
[0:01] random approached the new year so I'd
[0:02] like to preach on that tonight this will
[0:05] be a more uh quote heavy sermon you know
[0:09] most of my sermons are scripture heavy
[0:11] you know but this one a little be little
[0:13] bit more quote heavy sermon by God's
[0:21] grace so Philippians chapter 3: 13 we'll
[0:23] start there read 13 and 14 by God's
[0:27] grace so you know the reason this is so
[0:29] important to me a lot of these quotes
[0:30] are brand new or you know I guess
[0:32] they're made new by the Holy
[0:34] Spirit um I've forgotten if I've heard
[0:37] these I've forgotten about them and then
[0:39] when I read over them I think it was
[0:40] last Saturday I read over like oh wow it
[0:42] was just like uh it's like reading the
[0:44] new book again you know it's like wow oh
[0:46] felt fresh it felt brand new I'm like
[0:48] praise God and I was just encouraged
[0:51] because here's a prophet of God here's a
[0:52] man who's filled with the Holy Ghost
[0:54] worldwide Ministry hundreds and hundreds
[0:57] of imitations in just one year you
[1:00] couldn't do all of them how would you
[1:02] approach it and I think it's very simple
[1:04] at the end you'll see how how simple
[1:06] this is but it just gave me encourage
[1:08] you know as we approach the new year you
[1:11] know each year I always write out you
[1:12] know I don't actually I don't think I
[1:13] did last year but each year I always
[1:14] write out all my goals for the year it's
[1:16] neat to see what God inspires us to
[1:19] inspires me to do uh like last couple
[1:22] years you know writing books or or do
[1:24] these series on the videos and preach
[1:26] these different sermon series or maybe
[1:28] pay off some bills and you know to see
[1:30] how God
[1:32] provides but you know as we approach
[1:34] 2024 I want to do that again I want to I
[1:36] want to write down the goals the things
[1:39] I like to see the Lord do in my life and
[1:42] then ask God to give me Grace right to
[1:44] be able to accomplish some of these by
[1:46] the grace of
[1:48] God so Philippians 3:13 and
[1:51] 14 um on numerous uh New Year's Eve
[1:55] services brother random would quote this
[1:57] scripture of course this is a wonderful
[1:59] scripture for helping us to forget
[2:01] what's in the past right and focus on
[2:04] what's forward Hallelujah what's going
[2:06] to happen in the next year or or what
[2:08] are we looking forward to for the future
[2:11] all right so I'll read verse 13 then we
[2:14] can all read 14 Brethren I count count
[2:16] not myself to have apprehended but this
[2:19] one thing I do forgetting those things
[2:20] which are behind and reaching forth unto
[2:23] those which are before let's read this
[2:26] PM three 1 2 three I press toward the
[2:29] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[2:32] of God in Christ Jesus amen let's have
[2:35] one more word of prayer you have a need
[2:36] on your heart let's make it not to god
[2:38] father God we're small number here
[2:40] tonight Lord I'm still bad with a little
[2:42] sore throat but Lord we come to you in
[2:44] the name of Jesus Christ we're grateful
[2:46] to Worship You Lord thank you for these
[2:48] songs we can sing we're grateful we're
[2:49] not in the hospital or at home sick Lord
[2:51] God we're grateful we can be here
[2:53] tonight so father let your holy spirit
[2:55] guide us anoint us Lord you know how
[2:57] these uh quotes and scriptures Bless My
[2:59] Heart Lord
[3:00] on Saturday as I Was preparing or even
[3:02] throughout last week dear God so father
[3:04] I just pray that inspiration that
[3:06] motivation uh that hope for the future
[3:08] could be Lord uh shared with your people
[3:11] here tonight God use me I'm Your Vessel
[3:13] I'm just your humble servant I just pray
[3:15] God I could get rid of my thoughts and
[3:17] Lord preach your thoughts so Guide Me by
[3:19] the Holy Spirit May each person be
[3:20] benefited by being here as we look to
[3:22] the New Year here in Jesus Christ's name
[3:25] the Saints said am amen God bless you as
[3:27] you being
[3:28] seated I do have some slides here
[3:32] so over there apologize I have a little
[3:34] bit rning nose
[3:39] here I don't like to be sick like that
[3:41] but forgive me by the grace of the Lord
[3:44] today also I don't know if you've seen
[3:45] this uh this morning but I put out a a
[3:47] YouTube video about music I'm working on
[3:50] the series Now Music where I can kind of
[3:51] like lay it down and uh be able to uh
[3:56] clearly Define rock and roll so I put
[3:58] out part today and uh I just use this
[4:02] illustration like with our brothers or
[4:03] sisters you know you'll never see me in
[4:05] a pair of shorts right you know because
[4:07] the Bible says thigh so thigh is
[4:09] nakedness so in the book I put you know
[4:11] even for men or women you know you want
[4:13] to think you want to cover from the
[4:15] shoulder to the shin right but you have
[4:18] this area you know from the thigh
[4:20] down uh you want to stay away from shown
[4:23] the thigh but you know you could
[4:25] technically cover the knee right and
[4:27] still be modest but it's getting kind of
[4:30] close right you're kind of close if you
[4:33] know if a sister would kneel down or
[4:35] something you might might start showing
[4:36] some of your uh your your thighs there
[4:41] so what do we naturally want to do we
[4:42] want to wear you know longer uh longer
[4:45] skirts longer dresses Brothers want to
[4:47] wear longer pair of pants and so I use
[4:49] that illustration with music you know
[4:51] and that's what I want to do on that
[4:52] series I want to show like here's
[4:53] clearly rock and roll right with the th
[4:56] I want to show clear examples of rock
[4:57] and roll like some Brandon Lake songs
[4:59] you know
[5:00] uh some Hill song songs I just want to
[5:02] show clearly this is rock and roll right
[5:05] but then there's this area uh right
[5:07] there's this area where it's not rock
[5:09] and roll you know but if you if you say
[5:12] with the illustration you know the
[5:13] higher you get up I mean the closer you
[5:15] get to sin right and that's how it is
[5:18] you know the louder the drums or we'd
[5:20] say uh the more the more heavy the beat
[5:23] the closer you are getting to rock and
[5:25] roll okay um so that's what I felt like
[5:28] the Holy Spirit dropped in my heart I've
[5:30] been studying on this for months trying
[5:32] to get this out and I finally felt like
[5:33] this week I just kind of felt like a
[5:34] peace of God come over me I was like now
[5:37] I can teach it by God's grace now I can
[5:38] preach it so uh just you know I'm
[5:41] working on that by the grace of the Lord
[5:43] and I got part one out part two I'll be
[5:45] working on uh next few days here uh by
[5:48] God's grace but it it sure is a help to
[5:50] me and I got help there's this one
[5:52] brother and this is how the Lord does it
[5:54] Church you know as I'm as I'm studying
[5:56] on it a brother out of nowhere from
[5:59] South Africa if I'm not mistaken he
[6:02] sends me all these messages they're like
[6:03] 20 minutes long 15 minutes long and he's
[6:07] telling me all these quotes from brother
[6:08] Brandon and it's so helpful and so he
[6:11] helped me with numerous things about
[6:13] music and it was just awesome to see
[6:14] he's like he's like wow I helped out you
[6:17] at the time you needed it and then you
[6:18] helped out me with the time I needed
[6:20] it that's how the body of Christ does it
[6:23] praise God amen amen so that's how I
[6:25] know one way I'm in the will of God you
[6:26] know I pray about things I just wait on
[6:28] it I just wait on it and I look for
[6:30] inspiration from God to finish something
[6:33] or to go forward with something and
[6:35] that's what I think you'll see here
[6:36] tonight as we look at some of these
[6:38] statements from brother
[6:41] Brandon so there's 7 o'clock all right
[6:44] by God's grace so now I could go about
[6:45] an hour and hopefully everybody will be
[6:47] okay Hallelujah hopefully U it's an
[6:50] interesting message to you too um raise
[6:53] your hand does anybody set goals for
[6:54] each year does anybody do that if you
[6:56] raise your hand okay okay nobody maybe a
[7:00] couple well I do except last year I
[7:02] didn't because I just forgot I got so
[7:04] busy um but each of the last few years
[7:06] you know starting I think around 2017 I
[7:08] set a goals I want to here are some
[7:10] things I want to accomplish and uh God
[7:12] is you know God sometimes makes me wait
[7:15] on them God sometimes helped me to get
[7:17] them done um so this year I'm thinking
[7:21] about different things I I like I like
[7:22] to write a book on family and courtship
[7:25] and marriage and husbands and wives uh
[7:28] how they treat one another
[7:30] and everything related to family I like
[7:31] to write a book on that I'm not sure how
[7:33] it's going to go I'm kind of waiting for
[7:35] the leadership of the Holy Spirit on
[7:36] that um that's one goal I'd really like
[7:40] to get done I'd really like to get out
[7:41] of debt you i' got one more debt I'd
[7:43] like to get out of I really would like
[7:45] to get out the debt so that's one thing
[7:46] I want to make for a goal and pray about
[7:48] that uh and maybe a couple more things
[7:52] you know U I got talk to my wife maybe
[7:54] some other things like to maybe fix up
[7:57] or something like that I like to give
[7:59] out uh more books I like to give out
[8:02] more uh cards I like to be a more
[8:04] witness you know a couple years ago
[8:06] brother Brooks and I we went out in a
[8:07] park and we just played and gave we we
[8:10] just played tambourine and we sang you
[8:11] know and we passed out books and cards I
[8:13] like to do more Outreach you know i'
[8:15] like to uh you know do some more
[8:17] witnessing for the glory of God you know
[8:20] brother Ram you know he I got a quote
[8:21] you know I used on that video well Ram
[8:24] said the Pentecostal Church you're
[8:25] getting so big he said he said but
[8:27] you're getting further away from God he
[8:28] said you'd be better off if you were out
[8:30] on a on the street with tin cans and
[8:33] guitars and drums playing on the side of
[8:35] the
[8:36] street the see Church in other words you
[8:38] know it's okay for us to have a building
[8:40] it's okay but if if we lose the
[8:42] sincerity of a Christian it'd be better
[8:43] off if we were out on the street right
[8:46] and we didn't have a nice building a
[8:47] nice warm building like this so we we
[8:49] don't want to get caught up in sin and
[8:51] you know I guess the point of that is I
[8:53] I just want a heart that's hungry for
[8:55] the word of God I want a heart that's
[8:57] hungry to win somebody to Christ
[8:59] to see somebody saved who wants to get
[9:01] somebody saved praise God anybody want
[9:02] to get somebody that can be a goal for
[9:04] the year Lord I just want to I want to
[9:06] bring one person to church this year how
[9:08] about five I want to invite uh 10 people
[9:11] to church this year you
[9:13] know but you just got to make sure it's
[9:15] l of the Holy Spirit praise God right so
[9:18] I think in most cases it's God leading
[9:19] us to want to reach out to other people
[9:22] don't you think that I think
[9:25] that sorry so brother use this verse
[9:28] numerous times as he would U preach
[9:32] right before the new year I know we're a
[9:33] couple weeks in front of that but like I
[9:35] said I was inspired and I want to get
[9:37] everybody thinking towards that uh
[9:39] Direction I may take even some Sunday
[9:41] night services and uh go a little
[9:43] further on this you more more scriptures
[9:46] so the Bible said we should press which
[9:48] means to to run to flee to put to flight
[9:52] to run swiftly in order to catch a thing
[9:53] to run after it also means to pursue so
[9:57] we should press or see seek
[10:00] eagerly press towards the mark okay Mark
[10:02] means the goal so we should run towards
[10:04] a goal that's what Paul says forget
[10:06] things that are behind run towards the
[10:08] goal praise God Amen now I'm sure each
[10:10] of us could say I really wish I didn't
[10:12] do that this year I wish well I really
[10:14] wish I would have done that mistake this
[10:15] year there's a numerous Financial
[10:17] mistakes I've made this year like I
[10:18] broke my lawnmower I broke my van
[10:21] there's a lot of things I wish I could
[10:22] change about this year but I can't all I
[10:25] can do is forget about them and press on
[10:27] toward the mark of the High Calling of
[10:28] God in Christ Jesus am
[10:31] right and I think M if I would have had
[10:33] that money look what I could have done I
[10:34] could have helped out more people or
[10:36] something but I can't forget I can't
[10:38] dwell on that I got to press on toward
[10:40] the mark of the High Calling of
[10:42] God now the High Calling means a
[10:44] Heavenly invitation this means a a feast
[10:47] how many know there's going to be a
[10:48] marriage supper of the Lamb amen so we
[10:50] should press on we should run towards
[10:53] the
[10:53] goal of making the Rapture right run run
[10:57] towards the goal of of being at the
[10:59] meeting in the air and then also the
[11:01] marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah
[11:03] amen as we looked at a few weeks ago we
[11:04] should we should desire to be in the
[11:06] Millennium there's going to be so many
[11:08] Christians foolish vergins that are not
[11:10] in the Millennium we should live our
[11:12] lives like we're running to be a part of
[11:13] the Millennium amen that's right it's a
[11:16] Heavenly invitation that we're running
[11:18] to that's right out of the Greek Lexicon
[11:20] so this is kind of like the root words
[11:22] of these uh these Greek
[11:25] words remember Church you know the Bible
[11:27] tells us before you anything present
[11:29] yourself as a sacrifice for God amen
[11:32] amen that's why that's what we do when
[11:34] we come a church right you could we
[11:35] could be doing other things you could be
[11:36] working a second job or a third job you
[11:39] know you could be doing other things but
[11:41] here we come here and we We Lay
[11:43] ourselves before God as a sacrifice and
[11:46] you say God teach me uh God burn out any
[11:48] sin Desires in my heart God make me more
[11:51] pure I'm giving myself to you as a
[11:53] sacrifice amen and then we say God
[11:57] change my transform my mind mind that I
[12:00] could know the perfect will of God
[12:02] wouldn't that be a great thing if we go
[12:03] into 2024 and you and you and I do
[12:06] exactly what God wants us to do amen I
[12:09] tell you that'd be a successful year
[12:11] whether you got richer or not right
[12:13] whether you got uh uh more possessions
[12:16] or not it would really really wouldn't
[12:17] matter as long as you did God's perfect
[12:19] will you could be happy praise Goden
[12:24] amen and Jer you know this whole chapter
[12:26] is powerful I forgot remember that
[12:28] Kentucky Revival from earlier this year
[12:31] I forget how long it lasted but this was
[12:32] the chapter that it came out of just so
[12:34] if you want some inspiration maybe go
[12:36] home and read Romans 12 it's just a
[12:38] simple chapter on you know hate evil and
[12:41] love good and poor uh you know be kind
[12:43] to your enemies it's like pouring coales
[12:45] on their heads just all these uh don't
[12:47] be slothful in your work work hard
[12:48] Hallelujah all these great uh lessons
[12:51] just simple application of the Gospel
[12:54] amen I heard a I heard a true story
[12:57] today from this this preacher who's
[12:58] online I was listening to just one of
[13:00] his shorts and he says he knew this lady
[13:03] who was a Christian but she was a a
[13:05] custodian at a big office
[13:07] building okay she's a
[13:10] custodian all she did was change the
[13:12] trash cans right right clean the clean
[13:16] the
[13:17] bathrooms and the boss was walking
[13:19] through there one day CEO and he said
[13:21] you know what he said what's your name
[13:22] she said so and so let's say you know he
[13:25] said you know what he said I hate you
[13:27] that's quite a statement to say
[13:29] and she said why do you hate me what did
[13:31] I do she said he said because every time
[13:33] I look at you either humming or singing
[13:36] or sounds like you're worshiping God or
[13:38] something and she said he said I just
[13:41] hate you because you have so much joy
[13:44] and I have all this turmoil in my life
[13:47] and she said oh you must be
[13:48] misunderstanding this isn't me this is
[13:50] Jesus in
[13:52] me he said why what what do you mean and
[13:55] she said think about it she said she
[13:57] said I I was called by the King of Kings
[14:00] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[14:02] gave me a job in this building so I
[14:04] could wash your toilet I could scrub
[14:07] your
[14:08] toilet I could I could clean your
[14:11] bathroom I could sweep and sweep the
[14:14] carpet of your building the King of
[14:16] Kings gave me this job amen and then I
[14:19] don't know if we're repented or not but
[14:21] it was just such a beautiful story it's
[14:23] all about our perspective right right as
[14:26] we head into the new year you know we
[14:27] should work like that we should realize
[14:29] wow the King of Kings set me right here
[14:31] in this position amen amen God opened
[14:34] this door for me right I hope the guy
[14:37] got rid of his hatred I hope he got some
[14:38] love in his heart or some some
[14:40] forgiveness in his heart but he would he
[14:42] just hated this person who was so happy
[14:44] doing this meaningless job and she I try
[14:47] to say it's not meaningless if God
[14:49] placed me here there's nothing better
[14:51] than I can do here praise God
[14:54] Amen but see church we got to be we got
[14:57] to First be convinced that we're doing
[14:59] what God called us to do if we can get a
[15:02] real revelation of what God calls us to
[15:04] do then we can sing and and worship God
[15:07] on the job and some people want to come
[15:09] to church because we're singing on the
[15:10] job who I keep using that testimony from
[15:12] a few years ago I think that's a
[15:13] beautiful testimony that people want to
[15:16] be like you you know people want to know
[15:18] what what what is that person got in
[15:20] their life hallelujah what do they got
[15:21] that I don't got hallelujah amen
[15:25] amen so I just thought i' share that I
[15:27] thought that was a beautiful testimony
[15:29] that Sinners will just hate Christians
[15:32] because Christians have should have such
[15:34] love joy and and victory and worship in
[15:37] their
[15:38] lives all right now I I shared these
[15:41] verses with that gentleman I IAL told
[15:43] you about I met with on Saturday just
[15:45] some simple verses remember this church
[15:47] God's going to instruct you and teach
[15:49] you which way you'll go this year this
[15:50] coming year amen forget the past year if
[15:53] you made any mistakes God if you ask God
[15:57] God will show you which way to go go
[15:58] this year amen and he'll guide you with
[16:01] his allseeing
[16:04] eye your steps are ordered of God you
[16:07] also have that confidence even though
[16:09] you know last no matter what happened
[16:10] this year You Got Confidence God allowed
[16:12] you to Walk This Way amen right because
[16:15] God orders your steps you you should
[16:18] have learned something from
[16:20] 2023 praise God I should have learned
[16:23] something from 2023 about my
[16:25] steps right and if we walked in God's
[16:28] step then we made God delighted in his
[16:31] heart hallelujah praise God let's not
[16:34] forget that church when you obey God it
[16:35] makes God delighted amen it makes God
[16:38] happy praise God Amen that's
[16:41] right so teach us to number our days so
[16:44] we also got to remember though I'm 43
[16:47] you know if I got 40 years left praise
[16:49] God hopefully I got more than
[16:51] that brother only lived to
[16:54] 56 right right 56 I'm 43 right so 13
[16:59] more years if I was if I lived as much
[17:00] as brother brand I got I would have 13
[17:02] years left that's not a lot of
[17:04] time right you know I I also remember
[17:07] there's a student at our school she has
[17:10] uh cystic fibrosis I think it
[17:13] is and she she only lives to they only
[17:16] live to 30 years old I thought this
[17:18] sweet little seveny old girl she's only
[17:20] got 23 years
[17:22] left it's
[17:24] heartbreaking but you know in those
[17:26] years God wants to redeem those years
[17:28] either heal her or make her a light or a
[17:30] witness with those 23 years left that

[18:33] Seekers so sometimes you know we're
[18:36] sometimes not every time but sometimes
[18:37] we're not getting the reward of God
[18:39] because we're not seeking God enough
[18:41] amen right right there are certain
[18:43] things where we have to seek God and
[18:45] then God rewards us the Bible say it's
[18:48] like digging for gold
[18:50] right or digging for diamonds anybody
[18:53] that studies the uh those occupations
[18:55] you don't get gold or silver or diamonds
[18:57] every time you go

[19:17] impossible to please him free that
[19:18] cometh to God must believe that he is

[20:11] decision Amen brother said there's going
[20:14] to be a bride there's going to be a
[20:16] wedding supper that's just as sure to be

[21:17] see you got something to do too they
[21:19] that overcome shall inherit all things
[21:21] they they that overcome you have power
[21:22] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[21:24] it down she's made herself ready I like
[21:27] that word G church that's why we come
[21:29] here let's be reminded some things we
[21:31] can just lay down we don't have to hold
[21:33] on to right amen we don't have to hold
[21:35] on to
[21:36] them right just got to lay them down you
[21:39] see God cannot push us through a little
[21:41] pipe and pull us out on the other end
[21:43] and say wow blessed is he that
[21:45] overcomes he had nothing to
[21:47] overcome he just pushed you through but

[22:18] take what I've heard help me to take
[22:20] what I've heard brother random say or
[22:22] other preachers help me to apply that to
[22:24] my life so I'll diligently seek you and
[22:26] then I'll see your reward my life amen
[22:29] amen glory I like that remember David
[22:32] was better at obeying God than Saul was
[22:35] that's why God got rid of Saul he wasn't
[22:37] as good as obeying as David was so David
[22:40] was more diligent about keeping God's
[22:43] word remember uh Samuel told Saul he
[22:46] says the Lord had taken the Kingdom of
[22:48] Israel from you Saul this day and give
[22:51] it to a neighbor of thine that's better
[22:52] than
[22:54] that that's why there's a wise and
[22:56] foolish virgin the wise are are better
[22:58] at obeying the wise are more diligent
[23:02] amen right the wise are more
[23:06] diligent I'm still waiting you know I
[23:08] was I was talking to brother uh irin
[23:10] down there last time in Junction City
[23:12] and I said brother you're a farmer and I
[23:14] was real nice about it that I said can
[23:17] you explain to me what Jesus said what
[23:19] is a H hundredfold versus a 60-fold
[23:21] versus a 40-fold or 30-fold remember
[23:24] Jesus said that right you you know in
[23:26] other words our lives are going to
[23:28] produce a certain amount of fruit how do
[23:30] you get that hundredfold and he said he
[23:33] didn't know but his guess was you got
[23:36] the right conditions you got the right
[23:38] seed right and everything just
[23:41] everything works up he say sometimes
[23:44] I'll get a bushel and I'm sorry he said
[23:46] sometimes I'll get like 20 bushels an
[23:48] acre I don't understand that but 20
[23:50] bushels of wheat in acre he said some
[23:53] years I'll get 60 per acre in other
[23:56] words that that wheat will produce prod
[23:58] a lot more wheat in the same amount of
[24:00] space praise God Amen what was it was
[24:02] the right condition the right seed the
[24:05] right timing and it was good seed amen
[24:08] Well church let's apply that to our
[24:09] lives this coming year let's make sure
[24:12] the ground is tilled hallelujah let's
[24:14] make sure the the ground is weeded out
[24:16] hallelujah amen amen and let's feed the
[24:19] let's feed that seed with the word of
[24:21] God and let's lay in the presence of the
[24:24] Sun and let's let God give us a nice
[24:26] increase of a year Hallelujah
[24:28] amen I know for sure in this one area of
[24:31] my life with video making I put out way
[24:32] more videos this year than the last year
[24:35] so I'm I might have had a 30-fold
[24:37] increase sister who brother M I might
[24:40] had a 30-fold increase I don't hopefully
[24:41] it was
[24:43] 100-fold you know but whatever God's
[24:45] called you to do invest in
[24:47] that right invest in it and see if God
[24:50] won't won't uh expand it by God's grace
[24:53] amen fact I think I got a an email about
[24:56] that that just kind of reminded me I
[24:58] forgot about
[25:00] that oh yeah so just this is just this a
[25:03] cardinal example but it is a spiritual
[25:05] thing so there was 447 new
[25:08] subscribers uh there was almost 86,000
[25:12] views on my channel this year there was
[25:16] uh over there's
[25:18] 3,333 shares I think that's neat
[25:23] 3333 just a few statistics there the top
[25:27] video of the year was thus sayith the
[25:28] Lord future Prophecies of William
[25:30] brandom it was watched for over
[25:33] 596 hours can you imagine that people
[25:36] around the world almost spent 600 hours
[25:38] watching that
[25:39] video Hallelujah that's encouraging to
[25:42] me right because they could have been
[25:44] watching anything right I could have
[25:46] been watching uh Mr
[25:49] Beast whoever you know
[25:53] right but I'm just sharing that as an
[25:55] example let's make sure our heart heart
[25:57] is cleaned out let's get the right seed
[26:00] I know one seed that will never fail us
[26:02] right here praise God I know one seed
[26:04] that will never be uh disformed or
[26:07] deformed it's the word of God hallelujah
[26:09] amen I know one seed that's got perfect
[26:12] genetics that's God's word hallelujah
[26:16] amen now I like this statement brother B
[26:18] I'm not going to read this because it's
[26:19] when Jesus was tempted but Jesus
[26:22] overcame by the
[26:23] word he said the only way you can be an
[26:26] overcomer
[26:28] and the only way you can know you're
[26:30] overcoming is I'm sorry know your
[26:32] Overcomer is because the word Can't Fail
[26:34] amen amen so as we approach this year
[26:37] let's think about what can I overcome
[26:39] this year and then like brother says it
[26:42] doesn't really matter what you have to
[26:44] overcome what matters is how you
[26:46] overcome right and you overcome by
[26:49] believing God's word amen oh amen
[26:52] hallelujah so let's remember let's give
[26:53] all diligence the Bible says with keep
[26:56] your heart with all diligence I think
[26:57] children we read that one on Sunday
[26:59] night right amen so do everything in
[27:02] your power not to give your heart away
[27:04] to someone right too
[27:07] early or do everything in your power not
[27:10] to be tempted by any Idol right just
[27:14] give it every every ounce of your
[27:15] strength to keep your heart pure before
[27:18] God because out of it are the issues of
[27:22] Life Peter says give all diligence and
[27:25] add all this all all these char traits
[27:27] of Christ add them to yourself give
[27:31] diligence to make your calling and
[27:32] election sure for if you do these things
[27:35] you shall never fall hallelujah amen so
[27:38] see the word of God is given to us uh
[27:40] the the Holy Spirit comes to anoint us
[27:42] so we will do the word of God and so we
[27:45] will not fall amen that's how that's why
[27:48] the Holy Spirit sent to us so we'll
[27:49] overcome and will not fall praise Goden
[27:53] diligent so remember having the
[27:55] craving the earnestness
[27:58] the
[27:59] carefulness the speed the haste so an
[28:03] urgency so you must give all urgency and
[28:07] add the word of God to your nature to
[28:08] your character like I'll just say you
[28:10] know in the last few years I've really
[28:12] seen Malachi mature not that you I mean
[28:15] you were just naturally more immature
[28:17] when you're younger right same thing
[28:19] with AA I was telling you in Cas you're
[28:20] reading the church age book like that's
[28:21] just a natural thing I've really seen
[28:24] them really mature like I'll just using
[28:26] Mal one example you know I used to ask
[28:28] him to do things and maybe he didn't
[28:30] want to do it right away but now I can
[28:32] ask him to do something he just does it
[28:34] amen I'm really proud of them same thing
[28:37] with all my girls back there but I you
[28:39] know just the last few years I've just
[28:40] been wow I can see that they have an
[28:45] urgency to want to obey me right that's
[28:48] wonderful now how about all of us with
[28:51] the Lord Jesus
[28:52] Hallelujah that's that's where I want to
[28:54] I want to get better praise God I want
[28:57] to have a better year where I'm more
[28:58] obedient to the holy spirit amen amen I
[29:01] want to be able to hear his voice and be
[29:04] inspired as brother Samuel preach that
[29:05] prophets move by inspiration I want to
[29:08] be able to move by inspiration to the
[29:09] holy spirit amen
[29:13] hallelujah but that's this idea give all
[29:16] your diligence be urgent to obey the
[29:18] word of
[29:20] God and then you know the greatest
[29:22] commandment is love God with all your
[29:24] heart soul mind but also your strength
[29:28] like I told you I'm glad brother Samuel
[29:29] can say wow brother Jesse has lots of
[29:30] energy I hope that continues praise God
[29:33] I don't want to I don't want to run out
[29:35] of energy right but I but I think that's
[29:38] a good testimony I for myself I want to
[29:40] give all my strength to God Amen right
[29:43] there's so many other things I can give
[29:44] it to but I want to give all my strength
[29:46] to God and and the family of God and my
[29:48] personal family praise God amen amen and
[29:51] that's the that's the first commandment
[29:52] so the first thing God wants us to do is
[29:54] love him with everything we got
[29:56] hallelujah amen
[29:58] how can I show my love to God more what
[30:00] can I do to love God more right that's
[30:02] what I want to
[30:04] do remember brother R says first find
[30:07] the will of God for your life so we're
[30:09] thinking about you know going into 2024
[30:11] I'm going to preach a little bit about
[30:12] some goals brother Ram talks about but
[30:15] before you set any goal first make sure
[30:17] it's God's will for you to do it amen
[30:20] okay so I'm going to skip through some
[30:21] of these this is a very famous uh
[30:24] review um so you I should this this is
[30:27] not the one I was actually going to do
[30:29] this was the one I was going to do
[30:30] brother R said uh there's five musts
[30:32] that you have you know before you do
[30:34] something for God it must be the time
[30:36] and season for you to do it right it
[30:39] must be his word for you to do it amen
[30:41] so like a sister wouldn't preach right
[30:43] because it's not his
[30:44] word right like a brother wouldn't stay
[30:47] at home and watch the kids so his wife
[30:49] can go work because that's not the word
[30:50] of
[30:52] God it must be God's person you must be
[30:55] the person do it and of course these are
[30:57] know more spiritual for Israel or you
[30:59] know for us we can look to brother
[31:00] brandom you know does brother bram's
[31:02] Bible teaching does that give me the
[31:04] right to do it right okay now remember
[31:07] David I'm not I'm not going to go
[31:08] through these quotes because I want to
[31:09] watch the time remember David messed up
[31:11] on three of
[31:13] these remember this when he brought the
[31:15] ark the first time it was the right time
[31:17] and season because just three months
[31:19] later he did everything the same except
[31:21] he just put the cart on the should I'm
[31:23] sorry just put the Ark on the shoulders
[31:25] now it was the right time and season
[31:28] now what he did he missed the word of
[31:30] God because he built a cart like the
[31:32] Philistines but it should have been on
[31:34] the shoulders he had the right person
[31:36] David was the right person to bring the
[31:38] ark back to Israel but see he didn't
[31:40] consult a prophet nor did he uh seek out
[31:44] the Vindicated
[31:46] Prophet all right so before you make a
[31:50] goal you know for
[31:53] 2024 let's remember we must do it
[31:56] according to the will of God first and
[31:58] then as I I shared that this was when I
[32:00] wrote my
[32:01] book you know really church we only got
[32:03] five areas we got to look after so in
[32:06] your life you've only got really five uh
[32:09] countries you got to possess or can I
[32:10] State can I say it like that states in
[32:12] your in your country you only got to
[32:14] possess five areas of your
[32:16] life right and how do you do it brother
[32:19] said footsteps are possession amen amen
[32:22] in other words one step at a time
[32:23] brother amen my sister one step at a
[32:26] time so maybe this God's going to help
[32:27] you with the relationships now God did
[32:29] that for aelina they really solidified
[32:31] that relationship with marriage that's a
[32:33] really good thing but now they got to
[32:35] possess all that land they got to learn
[32:37] to love and learn to forgive and learn
[32:39] to be patient and all those great things
[32:43] right but they made a great step they
[32:45] possessed a lot of good land in that in
[32:47] that in this year
[32:49] Hallelujah now

[33:42] if if you're work is not the best
[33:43] situation then it's time maybe God's
[33:46] pray asking you to pray and seek his
[33:48] face and maybe that'll be this be a new
[33:50] year on a new job like remember Sister

[35:27] brother R says may we shape Our Lives by
[35:31] self-control doesn't the bible say that
[35:33] be temperate in all things have
[35:35] self-control in every area right like an
[35:39] easy one to see is with relationships
[35:42] okay uh a man or woman will want to rush
[35:44] into relationship like we had a brother
[35:45] who used to come to church he don't come
[35:47] anymore but he tried to rush into some
[35:48] relationships I said you you're not you
[35:50] shouldn't do
[35:51] that he tried to get on a dating app and
[35:53] date people I
[35:55] said don't do that
[35:57] not you're ready to get married you're
[36:00] just going to get tempted to lust and
[36:01] all these things don't do that right see
[36:05] each area you got to possess that that
[36:07] area by self-control by not letting the
[36:10] flesh make the decision but let God make
[36:13] the decision am amen may may we know by
[36:17] the help of the Holy Spirit to have full
[36:20] confidence that Jesus will say Well done
[36:22] my good and faithful servant at that day
[36:24] amen so this we get this idea shape your
[36:27] lives by Temperance shape your lives by
[36:29] dying daily shape your life by taking up
[36:32] your cross and following Christ
[36:35] amen said I don't know whether I'll live
[36:37] to see that day or not don't don't know
[36:39] whether God will permit it the Rapture
[36:40] but there's one thing I do have I have
[36:42] this hope that someday I'll hear him say
[36:44] it was well done good and faithful
[36:45] servant that's what I live for to see
[36:48] that day to hear that voice it was well
[36:51] done you've done the best you could how
[36:53] many Want Jesus say that amen amen Lydia
[36:57] you did the best you could I'm trying to
[36:58] use other people you know Caris you did
[37:01] the best you
[37:03] could that's what I work for that's what
[37:06] I worked and labor in love for my Lord
[37:09] Jesus hallah that's what I'm working for
[37:12] that's what I'm laboring for my Lord
[37:14] Jesus amen that my life is for you
[37:20] Lord Brother R said if a man fears that
[37:23] he might not please God then let him
[37:25] fulfill the word of God so if there's
[37:27] any question am I going to please God go
[37:29] back to the word of God and do exactly
[37:31] what the word of God says amen amen if a
[37:34] man wonders if he'll hear those words
[37:36] will Jesus tell me Well Done good and
[37:38] faithful servant let him fulfill the
[37:40] word of God in his life and ass surely
[37:42] he will hear those words of Praise Is
[37:46] that awesome Jesus is going to praise
[37:47] His Wife well don't you if you're
[37:49] married don't you praise your husband

[38:45] that's why I've been preaching on the
[38:46] book of Acts I want our church to match
[38:48] the book of Acts in other words if
[38:50] there's poor people don't have food I'm
[38:51] going to give them
[38:53] food right if there's people that need
[38:55] to be deacons I going to make them Deon
[38:56] deons right if there's whatever whatever

[39:01] book of Acts if somebody's sick I want
[39:04] them to be healed praise God Amen

[42:38] talent brother said you want to come
[42:40] into heaven and just by the skin of your
[42:44] teeth like like lot where the Bible said
[42:47] he'll have no reward just eternal life
[42:49] that's his only you don't have no
[42:53] reward don't raise your hand but none of
[42:55] us want to get to Heaven by let's get
[42:56] them our teeth right right would you
[42:58] just want to come before the father and
[43:01] the talent that he's given to every one
[43:02] of you as being negligent you just
[43:04] didn't want to use it or let something
[43:06] else stand in your
[43:07] way see we don't want to be negligent we
[43:10] don't want to neglect our gifts we don't
[43:12] want to neglect our
[43:14] talents he said you we shouldn't let
[43:16] little petty things that meant nothing
[43:18] to all little fusses and stews and
[43:20] arguments Church differences take the
[43:22] meekness and gentleness from your life
[43:27] would you want to stand before the
[43:28] father like that I don't believe you
[43:29] would I don't believe that you would do
[43:31] it neither would
[43:33] I how I want him to say it was well done
[43:36] not by the skin of my teeth but it was
[43:38] well done my good and faithful servant
[43:40] maybe you're a housewife if you are God
[43:42] made you a teacher of your children do a
[43:44] good job at it regardless of what you
[43:47] have to do do it
[43:50] welll how many want to do your job well
[43:52] this next coming year praise God I do
[43:57] like at my job I just got teacher of the
[43:59] year right so people are coming up
[44:00] saying great job gab you're the teacher
[44:02] of the
[44:04] year last year I got my principal came
[44:06] in and he grades me and I got the
[44:08] highest grade as a teacher so I feel
[44:10] good about that it just encourage me I'm
[44:12] doing the best I can I'm doing I'm
[44:13] trying to do a good job at it
[44:16] right now if I was getting bad grades I
[44:19] start to wonder well Lord am I am I
[44:20] being faithful or am I what's wrong
[44:23] right I should be doing the best I can
[44:25] do when your boss watches you when you
[44:28] whatever you're doing you want to do the
[44:29] best job at it that you can because it
[44:31] brings glory to God like that story of
[44:34] the of the of the
[44:36] custodian she didn't see her job as oh I
[44:38] got to clean toilets or I got to take
[44:40] out the trash she saw as God has me here
[44:42] to minister to other people amen the
[44:45] King of Kings chose this spot for me and
[44:49] I'll be happy with it amen hallelujah
[44:52] the king of
[44:54] kings
[44:57] hallelujah oh yeah I like this brother
[44:59] says oh your son his whole thoughts is
[45:02] upon you brother says like a
[45:04] tutor the holy spirit will report to the
[45:07] heavenly father of course it's the same
[45:08] Spirit but brother is's giving a he's
[45:10] giving a a analogy in
[45:14] 1956 he says all he's trying to do is
[45:16] please you he's so interested in your
[45:18] Affair till it's hard to hold him
[45:23] down how many a year like that praise
[45:25] God you're so in tunee with wanting to
[45:27] serve God it's hard to hold him down cuz
[45:29] you just want to do something for the
[45:31] Lord amen that's beautiful that's
[45:35] beautiful I'd rather just be a little
[45:37] overzealous about the father's Kingdom
[45:39] than to have no Zeal at all for it I'd
[45:41] rather overwork now see we don't have to
[45:44] overwork though we can find the sweet
[45:45] balance
[45:47] right like Jesus Jesus would do all the
[45:49] prayer meetings but then the Bible said
[45:50] he would go out and rest himself right
[45:53] he' go out alone and have some alone
[45:55] time
[45:56] so don't forget that no matter how hard
[45:58] you work make sure you take a little
[45:59] vacation right amen said he want to get
[46:01] away it's only the second time he's
[46:02] gotten away this year I said good
[46:05] brother you need to get
[46:06] away you got to refresh your batteries
[46:09] amen you're going to wear yourself out
[46:11] Jesus did it right uh Solomon did it
[46:14] with his wife there's times a couple
[46:16] needs to to leave the busyness of their
[46:18] life and just go get away and forget
[46:20] about all the cares of life and just
[46:21] enjoy being married
[46:24] amen
[46:30] sorry he said a Church of Christ
[46:32] preacher said Mr brandom I'd rather wear
[46:34] out than rust out and that's a lot of
[46:36] Truth i' rather wear out and die in the
[46:38] harness as brother Neville says than
[46:39] refuse to have any harness
[46:41] on right now I'm not telling you to
[46:43] overwork but I'm just saying this is the
[46:46] attitude brother Brandon took it's
[46:47] better to be a little more zealous than
[46:49] to be neglectful
[46:54] right now here's a quote I remember so
[46:56] this one was brand new to me I I don't
[46:58] know if I read this
[47:00] before brother said I was thinking of a
[47:02] story sometime up in the Northwoods I
[47:04] think I said Alabama on Sunday wasn't
[47:06] Alabama's Northwoods there's a boy he's
[47:08] about 25 years old he's just kind of a
[47:10] floater we called them he's a gentleman
[47:13] not a fugitive or Renegade he's a
[47:15] gentleman but just a guy that likes to
[47:17] float around no place to go nothing to
[47:19] do that's a horrible way to take a
[47:21] life I gave this his man his dinner
[47:24] sometime he was a bum I said when did
[47:27] you start this he said about 20 years
[47:28] ago I said where are you going he said
[47:30] nowhere I said then where did you come
[47:31] from he said nowhere I said how long do
[47:33] you expect to keep this up he said I
[47:35] don't know I don't know nowhere no idea
[47:38] about nothing no Ambitions why the
[47:40] Christian ought to be the most ambitious
[47:42] person in the world Amen in other words
[47:45] where where you going I know exactly my
[47:47] goal for this
[47:48] year where where did you come from I
[47:50] come from the mind of Christ I was
[47:52] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[47:54] of the world amen amen
[47:57] I know where I come from I know where
[47:59] I'm going praise God Amen see this is
[48:02] these quotes speak to me and they make
[48:05] me want to pray more so I can have a
[48:07] goal for this coming year what does the
[48:10] Lord want me to accomplish for this
[48:14] year I don't want to just float around
[48:16] from there float around and let just you
[48:20] know go with the cares of life and just
[48:21] I'm just trying to make I'll just see
[48:23] where it goes we should know where God's
[48:26] going to take us right to some degree we
[48:27] should have some idea what God wants us
[48:29] to do amen I church I've been preaching
[48:32] here 17 years I had the same old desk
[48:35] all these scuffs are probably my punches
[48:37] right there you know they're
[48:38] just made with my ring you know scuff it
[48:40] up I should have an idea about where God
[48:43] wants to Lead Me amen amen right and so
[48:46] this year where we Le where God lead us
[48:48] a lot of on Dancing this year right and
[48:50] God even Vindicated with brother Jim
[48:52] coming to preach on Dancing he let a 68y
[48:55] old man preach about dancing amen
[48:58] hallelujah see we should have an idea
[49:01] where we're going now I'm now I'm in the
[49:02] book of Acts praise
[49:04] God right and Book of
[49:06] Romans we should have an idea where
[49:09] we're
[49:10] going we're Where's God calling us to go
[49:13] we should be ambitious he said we should
[49:15] be up and add up and I'm up and I'm
[49:18] ready I'm eager I'm diligent I want to
[49:21] do what God's called me to do I know
[49:22] what God's called me to do amen amen
[49:25] listen Church you don't find a lot of
[49:27] people that know what God's called them
[49:28] to do you don't find many people right
[49:30] right and if you want other ideas let me
[49:33] know I'm in contact with this other
[49:35] man he's not a message believer but he
[49:38] has lots of friends in akan that their
[49:41] Ministry is to help uh people get off
[49:45] drug
[49:46] addiction and make them food and
[49:49] reestablish them you know some of them
[49:51] were like
[49:52] uh I don't know how to say it uh kind of
[49:56] like prostitutes you know just awful
[49:58] lives and my friend has numerous friends
[50:02] they they they purposely bought homes in
[50:04] akan they fix them up and then they
[50:06] invite these people that were on drugs
[50:08] and they invite them in and Rehab them
[50:10] and get them reestablished in life if
[50:12] you feel that's your ministry that's a
[50:14] Ministry that that's a real ministry
[50:15] that's helping people the Bible calls it
[50:18] helps right let me know I mean there's
[50:21] what is God calling you to do I don't
[50:23] know but each one of us should know what
[50:25] God's called us to do amen
[50:31] Amen brother R said they asked brother
[50:34] how do I know what gift I have brother
[50:35] Ram said because you can do
[50:38] it you can be up and at it
[50:42] right that's what you can
[50:45] do so if you can be a servant if you can
[50:48] have compassion on people that other
[50:49] people couldn't have compassion on then
[50:52] that might be your
[50:54] calling right
[50:56] you want to find God's will for your
[50:57] life but you want to be ambitious the
[50:59] only way you can be ambitious is to know
[51:01] what God's called you to do if not
[51:03] there's going to be questions right if I
[51:05] was wondering if God called me to do
[51:06] something I can't be ambitious because
[51:08] I'm I'm not sure if I should do it so
[51:10] that's why I said first find God's will
[51:12] then you can be very ambitious with it
[51:13] praise God Amen like Malachi can be very
[51:16] ambitious he needs to play more
[51:19] songs Casey you can be very ambitious
[51:21] God wants you to sing more
[51:23] songs because we can all see the gift
[51:26] right Haven God wants you to write more
[51:29] songs Hallelujah Caris God want you to
[51:31] sing more you Hallelujah L God wants you
[51:34] to write some more stories you know you
[51:36] can clearly see
[51:39] that what can you do what has God given
[51:42] you talent to do and then you do it with
[51:45] all your heart
[51:52] amen now brother says why do Christians
[51:55] want to frustrate themselves he says
[51:58] many times they come to me in
[51:59] confessions on private interview they
[52:01] confess all their you know adulteries uh
[52:04] they can't deny it the holy spirit's
[52:05] right there they try to cover it up it
[52:06] brings it out right then they must they
[52:08] might as well just tell it try to get it
[52:10] out the Holy Spirit stops and says just
[52:12] a minute here's a certain certain thing
[52:13] so when they come they begin to tell me
[52:15] about the little things of the world and
[52:17] I notice that among Believers you're
[52:18] going somewhere what you drifting for
[52:21] get some ambition about you set your
[52:23] goal on Christ and quit Italian with the
[52:27] world see these people are drifting from
[52:30] relationship to relationship now that
[52:31] doesn't impact us but what what does
[52:34] impact us is that we don't want to drift
[52:35] not knowing what to do this year right
[52:38] what does God want me to do I don't know
[52:40] what did God want me to do last year I
[52:41] don't know what does God want me to do
[52:43] in 10 years I don't know at some point
[52:46] we want to know praise God right like I
[52:49] told you that brother Randy SC he was a
[52:52] pastor for over 40 years but then he
[52:54] knew God had called
[52:55] him to go do missionary work and he say
[52:59] he preached at cams a few months ago he
[53:01] he got back it was in Europe and he said
[53:03] he preached this he he said God put it
[53:05] on his heart to preach this he said to
[53:06] answer the question of 40 preachers
[53:09] think about that preaching one service
[53:11] and and feeling led to leave the
[53:12] pastorship behind leave the church
[53:14] behind I'm no longer a pastor I'm going
[53:16] to go be a a teacher and a evangelist
[53:19] and then he answers all these questions
[53:21] of 40 preachers to me that's just a
[53:24] great that's a a great testimony of he
[53:26] knew what to do because he waited on God
[53:29] until God showed him what to do in other
[53:31] words he left being a pastor at just the
[53:33] right time and it was just the right
[53:35] season oh my
[53:39] Hallelujah set your goal on Christ amen
[53:42] and let's get our eyes completely off
[53:44] the world let's look to Christ
[53:47] amen he said but once you know the goal
[53:50] you got to
[53:51] persevere now persevere means to
[53:54] continue in a course despite or course
[53:56] of action despite
[53:59] difficulty
[54:01] Hallelujah so see then you know you get
[54:03] to the spot you can know what God wants
[54:05] you to do but then it becomes difficult
[54:07] well God's just giving you a test he
[54:09] wants you to persevere right he just
[54:12] wants you to press through and be an
[54:15] overcomer brother I preaching this Ser
[54:18] sermon many times
[54:19] perseverance he said every person on
[54:21] Earth that's ever been on Earth that has
[54:24] ever achieved anything that amount to
[54:26] anything had to be
[54:28] perseverant right you got to be sure
[54:31] first what you got your faith anchored
[54:33] on now go back to my book uh that the
[54:36] last book I put out two and a half years
[54:38] I put in that book I had to be
[54:41] pers think about that have you ever
[54:43] worked on a letter for two and a half
[54:45] years how about a report for your
[54:48] college class anybody ever wrote a a
[54:50] paper that took you two and a half years
[54:51] to write it was not
[54:54] easy I had to persevere as many times I
[54:56] felt like I don't want to have to I
[54:58] don't know how I can do this I don't
[54:59] want to finish this I'd rather do
[55:02] something else right I had to persevere
[55:06] it got
[55:08] difficult but if you're ever going to
[55:10] achieve anything you have to persevere
[55:13] until you accomplish it praise God and
[55:17] guess what that was my that was my goal
[55:18] for three years in a row write the book
[55:20] finish the book finally finish the
[55:23] book finally I you know I talked about
[55:26] it so much I got tired of talking about
[55:28] it I would tell you at Saints well well
[55:30] someday it's going to come out you know
[55:32] I talked about it for two and a half
[55:33] years almost three
[55:35] years now so here's I think this is
[55:39] where I want to
[55:41] go yeah and good I got about 10 minutes
[55:44] so here let me look at a few
[55:48] quotes I kind of want to get down that
[55:49] one yeah but let's see can
[55:52] go okay you've been a great audience
[55:54] here thank you for your patience church
[55:56] I know you love me you're so patient
[55:57] with me I love you too God's
[56:01] grace now look this is December 27th
[56:04] right before the new year this is the
[56:05] year before he preached the church
[56:09] ages he says this is going to be a great
[56:11] week for me now notice a great
[56:13] week I've got to make decisions for the
[56:16] coming year of all the invitations isn't
[56:19] that something all the places he was
[56:21] going to go he had to decided in one
[56:23] week
[56:25] I want go to the office and pick up all
[56:27] my invitations bring them home and
[56:28] therefore for the next few days I go to
[56:30] prayer to God and pray for him to guide
[56:32] me and show me which way to go and what
[56:34] to do we don't live in a time like it
[56:36] was back then where God LED them from
[56:37] place to place it's a different system
[56:39] he says and the way I do it now listen
[56:42] please here's the way you do
[56:45] it I put them in separate piles so he'll
[56:48] have a California pile how about an
[56:51] Arizona
[56:52] pile or a l pile
[56:57] or a Liberty Center
[56:59] pile or an acon
[57:01] pile he said I put them in separate
[57:03] piles I let them lay so here's all my
[57:06] here's all my uh needs about this here's
[57:08] all my needs about this here's all these
[57:10] things and I take to walking and praying
[57:12] is that something I'm going to go for a
[57:14] walk brother what are we going to do
[57:16] we're going to go walking it don't
[57:17] matter I'm just going to pray while I'm
[57:19] walking sound like a good plan right
[57:22] what brother brand do well pray but I'd
[57:25] also go walking and pray while I'm
[57:27] walking Lord I have these 20 invitations
[57:29] from California which one do I take Lord
[57:33] God isn't that isn't that beautiful he's
[57:35] just going for a walk to talk to Jesus I
[57:38] must tell Jesus all my troubles now
[57:40] these aren't troubles but these are
[57:41] invitations I don't know which way to go
[57:43] so I just want to go talk over with
[57:45] Jesus and I only got one week to decide
[57:48] for the next 52 weeks think about that I
[57:51] got one week to decide on 52 weeks
[57:54] that's not a lot of time I better be
[57:57] walking with the Lord right we better be
[57:58] walking with Jesus
[58:01] right
[58:04] right he says I do that he said oh and I
[58:07] maybe I get in my car and I'm gone a day
[58:09] or two I come back praying so he just
[58:11] drives maybe he'll go pray in his his
[58:13] cave right he had a cave where he pray
[58:15] there's a nice video on
[58:17] that I just try to get away and pray
[58:20] something comes on my heart to go to a
[58:21] certain place that I see if it's just an
[58:23] impression and afterwards if it's
[58:24] impressing me so hard I go to the pile
[58:27] and I pick up that letter and read it to
[58:28] see where it's at then from there so see
[58:31] he just spends time in prayer Waiting
[58:33] for God to inspire
[58:36] something here's the reason I do
[58:38] that he says you think of writing about
[58:41] 72 hours on a plane the storms up and
[58:43] down around if you ever rode overseas
[58:45] don't know sometimes whether you're up
[58:48] sometimes down swinging rocking pitching
[58:50] through the
[58:50] clouds he says the first thing Satan
[58:53] meets you and says well the minister
[58:54] will group said this some that div
[58:56] divide on the boat and so forth then you
[58:58] might be able to say well maybe the Lord
[59:00] didn't want me to come but when you're
[59:02] set from God you're ready to meet the
[59:05] enemy amen how many want to be ready to
[59:07] meet the enemy this coming year praise
[59:09] God amen amen in other words I know I
[59:12] prayed about this before I did this that
[59:15] way I can meet the enemy I don't have to
[59:17] worry am I in the will of God or not I
[59:19] know I'm in the will of God amen amen
[59:21] because I waited on God I prayed about
[59:23] it I I gave God a week think about that
[59:26] I gave God a week to show me if I was
[59:28] right or
[59:29] wrong church you can do that
[59:31] too I remember before I proposed a
[59:34] Christen I remember this before I
[59:35] proposed a Christan we had a spring
[59:37] break over at the at aranu and I asked
[59:40] my pastor there at the chapel I said do
[59:43] you think it'd be a good idea for me to
[59:45] just take this week and pray and see if
[59:47] I should propose a Christan he said
[59:48] that's a great idea aren't you glad I
[59:52] did but I took that week and I just read
[59:54] my I lifted weights we had to lift
[59:55] weights I lift all these
[59:58] weights but during that week I just
[1:00:00] spent my time in prayer Bible reading
[1:00:02] listening to sermons I didn't know the
[1:00:04] message
[1:00:05] yet and by the end of that week I was
[1:00:07] sure I wanted to marry her I don't know
[1:00:09] if she remembers that or not the
[1:00:10] pastor's name was Brian kler if she if
[1:00:12] she's listening now honey I'll look for
[1:00:13] a text after
[1:00:15] service but I just took a week I said I
[1:00:17] really want to
[1:00:19] know and God led me in the right right
[1:00:22] direction praise
[1:00:23] God but ra said I want to step here in
[1:00:26] the name of Jesus Christ in the name of
[1:00:28] the Lord Jesus and I'm going to stay
[1:00:30] here until God's work is
[1:00:32] accomplished
[1:00:34] amen he said and then now look what he
[1:00:37] said then he asked for prayer you pray
[1:00:38] for me because I have all these piles
[1:00:41] and I got to know which ones I'm going
[1:00:42] to do this year I need your prayers so
[1:00:45] not only did he pray he asked for the
[1:00:47] prayers of the
[1:00:48] Saints aren't you glad when people pray
[1:00:51] for you then they know you're praying
[1:00:52] for
[1:00:53] you what a

[1:02:49] forgetting those things in the past all
[1:02:51] the mistakes and all the things that
[1:02:53] I've done I pressed toward the mark of
[1:02:55] the high calling in Christ that's the
[1:02:57] only regrets I have is my heirs for the
[1:03:00] past year and I humbly ask him for Grace
[1:03:03] to press on toward the mark of the High
[1:03:05] Calling he says I'm sure we'd all feel
[1:03:08] that way how many feel that way praise
[1:03:10] God Amen the only regret is I made some
[1:03:13] mistakes this year but I'm going to
[1:03:15] rejoice in the blessings of last year
[1:03:17] but this year I'm going to press toward
[1:03:19] the mark of the High Calling of God in
[1:03:21] Christ
[1:03:22] Jesus I'll preach more on habits Lord
[1:03:25] Lord win brother man said bad habits are
[1:03:27] evil spirits right we're we're fighting

[1:03:31] overcome evil spirits so you want to
[1:03:33] have the right habits you want to have
[1:03:35] Godly habits
[1:03:37] right all right and I want to uh let me
[1:03:39] close with this last one here I I'll get
[1:03:41] to these later

[1:03:46] Sunday he said Billy right now is
[1:03:49] working on overseas for a complete World
[1:03:51] Tour beginning right immediately after
[1:03:53] Christmas
[1:03:55] he said then in January I want to do a
[1:03:56] complete World Tour he said we're
[1:03:59] working on that now finding just where
[1:04:01] the Lord will lead I'm so grateful ever
[1:04:03] to the people the ministers and he says
[1:04:06] much as I say against their
[1:04:06] denominations and things like that you
[1:04:08] know on the books laying right there
[1:04:10] back now brother Roy borders takes care
[1:04:11] of the invitations since Christmas the
[1:04:13] first year there's been over a thousand
[1:04:15] invitations Around the World Imagine
[1:04:16] That so again like I
[1:04:18] said who's got a thousand uh emails they
[1:04:21] need to answer on their phone I'm going
[1:04:23] to look at that red bubble after church
[1:04:24] on your phones I'm going to try to peek
[1:04:26] and look at your

[1:04:30] 1,000 to-dos on your to-do
[1:04:33] list right a thousand
[1:04:37] invitations so the Lord just has to
[1:04:39] direct me on which one of those to go to
[1:04:41] and what to do we just depend on him you
[1:04:44] couldn't take them all so Church don't
[1:04:47] feel discouraged if you got a big to-do
[1:04:48] list or there's lots of things on your
[1:04:50] heart you can't do everything God's not
[1:04:52] asking you to do everything but God
[1:04:54] wants you to do
[1:04:57] something there's something God wants
[1:04:59] each one of us to do in this coming year
[1:05:02] and so we need to do like brother
[1:05:04] brandham we need to pray about
[1:05:06] it we need to wait on the Lord about
[1:05:11] it he says so we're just laying them out

[1:05:15] us heavenly father and you help me pray
[1:05:18] with this
[1:05:20] manner you help me pray that we can get

[1:05:28] be shocked on this quote okay so get
[1:05:31] your inhalers ready if you got asthma
[1:05:33] get your inhalers ready praise
[1:05:34] God he says brother argb never runs out
[1:05:37] of things to do for the Lord Jesus don't
[1:05:39] you like that he doesn't do them
[1:05:41] grudgingly he just freely goes out and
[1:05:43] does them I couldn't have ever taken
[1:05:45] trips overseas if it hadn't been for his
[1:05:47] help and he's got a burden on his heart

[1:06:18] state of Maine like he was real looking
[1:06:20] at me like and I'm like uh let me pray
[1:06:24] about it so I prayed about it and I felt
[1:06:26] led to go and it was hard cuz I had to
[1:06:27] leave little little Mali little Lydia
[1:06:29] they were really
[1:06:31] little and we flew to to Boston he lost
[1:06:36] his
[1:06:37] luggage but then we prayed an hour later
[1:06:39] he found it literally he did a dance
[1:06:42] like this he said praise God praise God
[1:06:44] I found my luggage in front of everybody
[1:06:46] I was like praise God that's what I knew
[1:06:50] this man had the Holy
[1:06:51] Ghost he's like glory to God hallah
[1:06:54] brother
[1:06:56] Jess I love that guy he's a real
[1:06:58] Christian there's my hour anyways we
[1:07:02] weren't done yet that little town that
[1:07:03] little state of Maine was it was another
[1:07:06] plane ride we got this little tiny plane
[1:07:08] and I thought we were going to die the
[1:07:09] lightning was going the plane was
[1:07:12] shaking I thought I was going to
[1:07:14] die
[1:07:17] there's I'm not really a good
[1:07:19] flyer anyways we landed we went to this
[1:07:21] real small Church in this tiny little
[1:07:23] town
[1:07:24] I prayed and fasted I preached a couple
[1:07:27] services on the last one you know just a
[1:07:29] couple people come up for prayer but on
[1:07:31] the last service I was in the office
[1:07:33] finish up in walks the pastor sister
[1:07:36] she's got to be 55 or 60 and she starts
[1:07:39] crying she said brother Jesse thank you
[1:07:41] for coming this weekend she said I will
[1:07:43] never be the
[1:07:45] same
[1:07:48] Hallelujah and it wasn't my
[1:07:51] leading it wasn't my idea to go there it
[1:07:53] was brother Mike Mike basically come to
[1:07:56] my church and said I got a burden on my
[1:07:57] heart will you
[1:07:59] go I didn't really feel like
[1:08:02] going oh and then uh and then uh he
[1:08:06] spent all his money he had no money left
[1:08:09] and then somebody at the meeting come up
[1:08:10] and give me the certain amount of money
[1:08:13] and it's just for me right they didn't
[1:08:14] say give it but I was like you know what
[1:08:16] I want to give some of that to brother
[1:08:17] Mike and the I gave him above and beyond
[1:08:20] the cost for his ticket and he's like
[1:08:23] brother Jesse this is so amazing I was
[1:08:25] out of money I could not afford this and
[1:08:27] God paid me back I said God will always
[1:08:29] pay you back hallelujah amen amen that's
[1:08:34] just one example where this guy was led
[1:08:36] of the Lord to do that so I just
[1:08:38] followed his leading because I could
[1:08:40] tell he was led of the Lord this is a
[1:08:41] little out of
[1:08:43] ordinary I could tell this is Led of the
[1:08:45] Lord and it leads to what change lives
[1:08:48] that's what we want we never want to be
[1:08:49] we always want to be different right God
[1:08:51] make us more like you praise God
[1:08:54] now look brother said he's such a goodly
[1:08:57] or Godly little person even I have no
[1:09:00] leading yet yet I'll go with him because
[1:09:03] I know God leads
[1:09:06] him brother Jesse don't you can't say
[1:09:09] brother brandom never had the leading or
[1:09:11] brother R didn't always know the leading
[1:09:12] of the Lord that's exactly what brother
[1:09:13] brandom said I'm just saying what the
[1:09:16] tapes
[1:09:17] say brother Bram didn't always have the
[1:09:20] leading of the Lord so sometimes he had
[1:09:22] to go with somebody else El is leading
[1:09:24] of the Lord but you got to have you got
[1:09:27] to follow somebody who you have
[1:09:28] confidence
[1:09:30] in that they follow the leading of the
[1:09:32] Lord see that's why I got confidence in
[1:09:33] brother Mike when I see brother Mike
[1:09:34] here I'm like he's probably led here by
[1:09:36] the holy spirit because I've seen it
[1:09:38] work
[1:09:39] before he was led of the Holy Spirit to
[1:09:41] do
[1:09:43] that ain't easy to leave family ain't
[1:09:46] easy to fly we had to push through all
[1:09:48] the lost luggage but we got a good Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost Dance out of that Hallelujah
[1:09:56] and then right before this is the last
[1:09:57] one I'll read musician can come here
[1:09:59] musician let's stand last
[1:10:02] one and church even there's
[1:10:06] times you don't have a leading but you
[1:10:09] still want to do something for
[1:10:11] God I'll try to explain brother R's out
[1:10:15] in Arizona remember he said this was the
[1:10:16] hardest time of his life because nobody
[1:10:17] invited him to preach in Arizona he
[1:10:20] moves out there and none of the
[1:10:21] preachers will let him come preach
[1:10:24] the prophet of God and they're all
[1:10:26] afraid he's going to start a church and
[1:10:27] pull all their church members away he
[1:10:29] didn't do that he didn't go out there
[1:10:30] for
[1:10:33] that he said I'll leave it ler Pastor
[1:10:35] will read it to you where we we're to
[1:10:37] meet at if the Lord willing that is the
[1:10:39] Lord willing I have no leading for them
[1:10:42] all these
[1:10:44] invitations just simply going out to try
[1:10:46] to do whatever I
[1:10:49] can okay so he's out in Arizona he says
[1:10:52] I have no lead eating but I'm just going
[1:10:55] out doing whatever I
[1:10:59] can so this coming year if we got to the
[1:11:02] spot where we feel like I don't know
[1:11:04] what God's leading me to do well let's
[1:11:07] at least do something until God shows us
[1:11:09] what to
[1:11:10] do remember Church what was the what was
[1:11:13] the worst thing with the parable of
[1:11:14] talents what was the worst thing it was
[1:11:16] bearing talent in the ground right
[1:11:20] that's the worst thing we can do is do
[1:11:22] nothing
[1:11:24] and what did Jesus say he said you
[1:11:26] Wicked and slothful
[1:11:29] servant he said you should at least put
[1:11:32] my money in with the bankers you I could
[1:11:34] have got some interest on
[1:11:36] that the worst thing we can do is do
[1:11:39] nothing now don't don't get me wrong if
[1:11:41] you're in a if you have family and
[1:11:42] friends serving them is definitely
[1:11:44] that's definitely God's will for your
[1:11:45] life that's definitely part of
[1:11:49] it I want you to see that
[1:11:52] here
[1:11:54] sometimes brother Ram knew exactly what
[1:11:55] God called him to do other times he
[1:11:57] followed the leading of somebody else
[1:11:58] that he knew was led of the Lord and
[1:12:00] other times he had no leading and he was
[1:12:02] just doing
[1:12:04] something Hallelujah is anybody
[1:12:07] encouraged tonight by God's grace all
[1:12:09] right couple all right let's bow our
[1:12:10] heads amen glad to hear that this really
