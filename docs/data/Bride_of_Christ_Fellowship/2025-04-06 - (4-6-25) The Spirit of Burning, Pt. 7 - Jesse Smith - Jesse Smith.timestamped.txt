[0:00] I want to look at part seven here of the
[0:02] spirit of burning by God's grace. And as
[0:05] I was studying on this, I was like,
[0:06] well, I just I can't stop preaching this
[0:08] series until I preach on the burning on
[0:10] the day of Pentecost. That's what our
[0:11] whole faith is founded upon. Praise God
[0:14] is the day of Pentecost. Everyone needs
[0:15] a Pentecostal experience. And uh even
[0:18] Wednesday night, that's where that's the
[0:19] direction I felt the Holy Ghost leading
[0:21] me. I I never quite know which way it's
[0:23] going to go. Um and as I got preaching
[0:25] with brother Rod here, you know, it kind
[0:26] of went that direction. Um, it's thus
[0:29] sayith the Lord. Classical religion is
[0:31] of the devil. In other words, just
[0:33] routine. Everything's the same every
[0:34] single service. That's of the devil. We
[0:37] don't want a routine religion. We want a
[0:38] spontaneous Holy Ghost religion.
[0:40] Hallelujah. And we realize we've got to
[0:43] we've got to be on the battlefield.
[0:45] We've got to labor to enter into that.
[0:47] Praise God. Even after you're born
[0:48] again, you got to renew your strength
[0:50] like the eagle. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[0:52] You got to pray for revivals and get
[0:54] your first love back. Each one of us
[0:56] experience that. So, we know it's it's
[0:59] worth fighting for. How many believe
[1:00] that? Paul said, "I fought the good
[1:02] fight of faith." It's a fight.
[1:03] Hallelujah. And the best part is Jesus
[1:05] is with us the entire fight. Hallelujah.
[1:08] He's helping us fight. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10] Glory to God. Thank the Lord. Acts
[1:13] chapter 2, we'll read uh three and four.
[1:16] Uh by the grace of the Lord. Let me get
[1:18] there in my Bible.
[1:34] the spirit of burning. Now, let's see
[1:35] what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[1:37] Praise God. When they got in one place,
[1:39] in one
[1:42] accord. I'll read one and two, and then
[1:44] we can all read three and four together
[1:46] by God's grace just to set the the scene
[1:48] of this. And when the day of Pentecost
[1:51] was fully come, this was 50 days after
[1:54] Passover. Hallelujah. They were all with
[1:58] one accord and in one place. And brother
[1:59] Ram says, "If we can do that, the same
[2:01] thing can happen today." Think about
[2:02] that. If we could just all just want the
[2:04] same thing, all just desire the same
[2:07] thing, then God would visit us just like
[2:09] God visited them. What a blessing
[2:11] because we are in one place. We got that
[2:12] much. 50% of the battle's been won. Now
[2:16] we just got to fight for that last 50%.
[2:18] Praise God.
[2:20] Verse two, "And suddenly there came a
[2:23] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[2:25] wind, and it filled all the house where
[2:28] they were sitting." Now, as I said on
[2:31] Wednesday, I know three people that have
[2:32] felt the wind of the Holy Ghost flow
[2:34] through this room. Sister Hua when she
[2:36] got healed, uh, Sister Emma when she got
[2:39] the Holy Ghost in 2020, and then brother
[2:41] Amen, when I preached, it was part six.
[2:43] I went looked it up. It was part six of
[2:45] the praise the name of Jesus in the
[2:48] dance. Hallelujah. Because he was he was
[2:50] just playing uh guitar over here and
[2:52] then I was I was over here praying and
[2:54] he just threw up his hands. I remember
[2:55] that. By God's grace he was weeping and
[2:58] crying and praising the Lord. So at
[2:59] least three times. So see church, God
[3:01] can fall at any time. Hallelujah. And we
[3:04] just want to be ready when he comes.
[3:05] Hallelujah. It's a visitation. That's
[3:08] what it it's called in the Bible or it's
[3:10] called a day of refreshing. It's when
[3:12] God visits us and then we remember God's
[3:15] visitation. Hallelujah. We go through
[3:17] and that's that's what we call a
[3:18] mountaintop experience. When someone
[3:19] gets born again, you're up there on the
[3:21] mountain. You feel like you could
[3:22] conquer everything, but then God God
[3:25] leads you down into the valley
[3:26] sometimes, too. Praise God.
[3:29] Hallelujah. Now, let's read verses three
[3:31] and four. Let's see uh the spirit of
[3:33] burning here by God's grace. And now we
[3:35] see it's a third step. It's the baptism
[3:37] of the Holy Ghost. Verse three, let's
[3:39] read it. 1 2 3. And there appeared unto
[3:42] them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
[3:46] it sat upon each of them. Verse four,
[3:48] let's read it. And they were all filled
[3:51] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[3:54] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[3:57] them utterance. May God add his blessing
[3:59] to the ring of his word. You may be
[4:00] seated. Praise God.
[4:07] So this is a a wonderful portion here of
[4:10] uh scripture by God's grace. This is the
[4:12] birthday of the church. Hallelujah. The
[4:14] day of Pentecost when the church was
[4:16] established. Hallelujah. And really it's
[4:18] your spiritual birthday as well.
[4:20] Hallelujah. For Jesus said you must be
[4:22] born again. Hallelujah. And that means
[4:25] born from above. If you look up the word
[4:27] uh again, it means born from above.
[4:30] Hallelujah. Because Jesus got he
[4:32] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[4:34] right? And he was born from above. He
[4:36] was born from Mary's womb, of course.
[4:38] And then uh he was born from above, a
[4:41] new birth where the spirit of God came
[4:43] down to fill the body that God had
[4:46] prepared. Hallelujah. It was God
[4:48] manifest in flesh. Hallelujah. So God's
[4:51] spirit comes to fill God's body.
[4:53] Hallelujah. God's physical fleshly body.
[4:56] Praise God. Amen. Now John foretold,
[4:59] John the Baptist foretold this fire
[5:01] baptism in Luke 3:13 16, sorry, Luke
[5:05] 3:16. John answered, saying unto them
[5:08] all, I indeed baptize you with water.
[5:10] And that's what I could say, too. That's
[5:11] what brother Ram could say. Anybody can
[5:13] say that. Any preacher can say that. But
[5:15] one mightier than I cometh. See, there's
[5:17] one who's mightier than any prophet.
[5:20] That's Jesus. Hallelujah. That the
[5:23] latchet of whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[5:26] unloose. So think about that. He wasn't
[5:27] even worthy to go un we'd say untie his
[5:30] shoes or un uh unstrap his shoes. He
[5:32] wasn't even worthy to take his shoes
[5:35] off. That's how unworthy we are. But
[5:38] that's how gracious God is to fill our
[5:41] souls even when we're unworthy. Praise
[5:43] God. We're not even unworthy to touch
[5:46] his feet. Uh let alone to touch his
[5:48] heart or be after the heart of God. But
[5:50] yet he still comes and dwells inside of
[5:52] our souls. Hallelujah. Talk about
[5:54] amazing grace. Amen. Could you sing a
[5:57] million songs about it? That's what that
[6:00] song says. I probably have over the
[6:01] course of my 25 years of being a
[6:03] Christian by God's grace. I always got
[6:05] to check the
[6:07] number. He shall baptize you with the
[6:10] Holy Ghost and with
[6:12] burning. Hallelujah. And the church
[6:14] said, hallelujah. Now remember Isaiah,
[6:17] he only had two works of grace. He had
[6:20] justification, the spirit of judgment,
[6:21] and then he had the spirit of burning
[6:23] sanctification. Brother said
[6:24] sanctification burns out of out of all
[6:26] your worldly desires out of your heart.
[6:28] So if you still got worldly desires, I'm
[6:30] not talking about battling them. I'm I'm
[6:32] talking about you still give into them
[6:34] on a consistent basis. Praise God. And
[6:37] you're not yet into the promised land,
[6:38] you haven't experienced uh the joy of
[6:40] the promised land, then you need a
[6:42] spirit of burning for the sanctification
[6:44] and then you need a spirit of burning
[6:45] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[6:48] brother brother Cam shared a good point
[6:49] with me yesterday. He was saying, you
[6:51] know, as every church goes through
[6:52] trials, he said, I I was going back and
[6:54] brother brother Cam said, I was
[6:55] preaching through the uh the time of
[6:58] Israel. And brother, brother Cam said,
[7:00] and brother Ram preached the same thing
[7:02] when the people started complaining
[7:04] about the mana.
[7:06] They were complaining about food from
[7:08] heaven.
[7:10] Brother Cam said, "Then they started
[7:12] complaining about the preachers,
[7:14] Moses and Aaron." And he said, and
[7:17] brother Cam was saying, "Now look," and
[7:18] and he was saying that I was like, "Wow,
[7:20] that's right." And then remember the
[7:21] Bible warns us of that in 1 Corinthians
[7:23] chapter 10, tempting the Lord, tempting
[7:26] Christ, tempting God by speaking against
[7:28] what God sends and who God sends.
[7:32] And I was like, "That's right, brother
[7:33] Cam. That shows when people do that,
[7:35] often times they never made it yet to
[7:37] the promised land. They haven't made it
[7:39] all the way to the moment of victory in
[7:42] the promised land." Hallelujah. when
[7:44] they complain about the sermons and it's
[7:46] not I can't understand it or uh I want
[7:49] something different when you're
[7:50] constantly complaining about what God
[7:52] has sent then you you you shows you're
[7:54] not where where you need to be on the
[7:56] journey. Praise God. And I got a good
[7:58] verse for you. Ecclesiastes chapter 5. I
[7:59] just read it this morning in my uh my
[8:02] daily reading. I was like, "Oh, glory.
[8:04] Right on time." Ecclesiastes chapter
[8:08] 5. Good verse for me. Good verse for all
[8:11] of us. Praise God.
[8:15] Verse one, Ecclesiastes 5:1, keep thy
[8:19] foot when thou goest to the house of
[8:20] God, and be more ready to hear. So, it
[8:23] just means go with carefulness. It
[8:25] doesn't mean uh make sure you don't step
[8:26] in the the mud puddles out there. The
[8:28] first thing I stepped out of of was in a
[8:30] big mud puddle today or big water puddle
[8:32] and my foot almost was covered in water.
[8:34] That's not what it's talking about. It's
[8:36] talking about make sure you approach the
[8:38] house of God with careful steps. In
[8:40] other words, you're walking in this.
[8:41] You're meditating on the things of God.
[8:44] Hallelujah. And be more ready to
[8:48] hear, right? Be more ready to hear the
[8:52] preaching than to give the sacrifice of
[8:54] fools. And James 1 tells us the
[8:56] sacrifice of fools. It's going to church
[8:58] and hearing everything, but not a doer
[9:00] of what you hear.
[9:03] So, from last week, let's back up last
[9:05] week. If you haven't meditated on God
[9:06] this week, you've been acting like a
[9:08] fool because the word of God is telling
[9:10] us to meditate on the things of God. I
[9:13] spent most of all day yesterday
[9:14] meditating on the things of
[9:15] God. Do you do that? I mean, you should
[9:18] have. If not, then we've just been
[9:20] foolish. We haven't been applying what
[9:22] God's been telling us to do. Praise God.
[9:25] I'm not talking about we got to pay
[9:26] bills and we got to do the insurance and
[9:28] call that person and run the errands.
[9:29] But in the in the midst of all that, you
[9:31] got to slow down and remember what is
[9:33] God's word saying and what what is
[9:35] something uh great that God has shown me
[9:37] or done for me lately. Praise God. See,
[9:40] for they consider not that they do evil.
[9:45] And for us, evil might not be murdering
[9:47] or or adultery or stealing or something
[9:49] like that, but it might just be uh
[9:51] getting complexes as we see amongst
[9:53] amongst churches. People just get
[9:55] complexes and it ruins their entire
[9:57] spiritual life.
[9:59] bitterness. It's a Paul calls it a root
[10:02] of bitterness and it defiles a person's
[10:05] whole life. Hallelujah. But my if we got
[10:08] rid of that then we have the joy of the
[10:09] Lord. Praise God. Instead of bitterness,
[10:11] we got gratitude for each other.
[10:14] Oh my. I didn't plan to preach that.
[10:16] That just kind of came to my heart
[10:17] there. Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse two.
[10:21] Be not rash with thy mouth and let not
[10:22] thine heart be hasty to utter anything
[10:24] before God. For God is in heaven, and
[10:27] thou upon the earth. Therefore, let thy
[10:29] words be few. Be careful what you say to
[10:31] God. That's why it's so important. Make
[10:34] your requests known unto God.
[10:36] Hallelujah. And then accept whatever God
[10:39] gives. Whatever God's will, Lord, let
[10:41] your will be done on earth as it is in
[10:43] heaven. Hallelujah. I'm going to make my
[10:45] words few.
[10:47] Hallelujah. Now, glory. Now, let's go to
[10:49] another verse here. Now Jesus foretold
[10:52] this
[10:53] baptism in John I'm sorry in Acts
[10:55] chapter 1 verse 5. This baptism of fire,
[10:59] the Holy Ghost and fire. The Holy Ghost
[11:02] and the burning that comes with it.
[11:04] Praise God. Acts 15. For John truly
[11:07] baptized with water, but ye shall be
[11:09] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[11:12] days hence. Notice he doesn't mention
[11:13] fire because Jesus knew it's the same
[11:15] thing. The Holy Ghost is fire.
[11:18] The fire John mentioned was just for
[11:20] those apostles that they remember, oh,
[11:22] John said it was fire. Jesus just calls
[11:24] it the Holy Ghost because he knows our
[11:26] God is a consuming fire.
[11:29] Hallelujah. I There's this one man who
[11:31] just trolls me on the internet. Oh, you
[11:34] don't preach on the fire, the baptism of
[11:35] fire. I'm like, well, Jesus didn't
[11:36] mention the fire because he knew the
[11:38] Holy Ghost was fire. Hallelujah. They
[11:41] just trolls me all the time. So, I can
[11:43] say, you're you're deleted from my
[11:45] channel. Hallelujah. Acts 2:3. And then
[11:49] we see it was prophesied to come with
[11:51] fire and then it comes with fire. Verse
[11:54] three. And there appeared unto them
[11:56] cloven tongues of fire as it sat on each
[11:58] one of them. I pray someday God's God
[12:01] will let us see the Holy Ghost in one
[12:04] another. Praise God. In other words, I
[12:06] like to know who's born again.
[12:07] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Amen.
[12:09] Sometimes I'm very wondering who is born
[12:11] again and who's not. But on that day,
[12:14] they could know for sure John is born
[12:16] again. They could know Peter is born
[12:19] again. Hallelujah. Because they actually
[12:21] saw the fire. Now, we we might I might
[12:23] not get that prayer answered. I might
[12:25] not get that privilege. But Jesus said,
[12:27] "A tree is known by its fruit."
[12:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Grant it, Lord,
[12:32] someday. Hallelujah. That we could see
[12:34] those who have the fire and those who
[12:36] don't. And pray if you don't got it, you
[12:38] can get it today. Hallelujah. Amen. The
[12:41] Bible said, "Today, harden not your
[12:43] hearts as in the day of provocation."
[12:45] Hallelujah. In other words, open up your
[12:46] heart. Today is just as good a day as
[12:48] any day to be born again. God still
[12:51] sends the fire when the people are ready
[12:53] for the spirit of burning. Hallelujah.
[12:56] That's
[12:57] right. Acts
[13:01] 11:15. And as they began to speak,
[13:04] somebody read this on Wednesday. The
[13:05] Holy Ghost fell on them as on us as at
[13:08] the beginning. So the fire, the Holy
[13:10] Ghost and fire will fall the same every
[13:12] time. We just don't see it. Praise God.
[13:15] Right? But we know brother Cam seen the
[13:17] pillar of fire at his church and
[13:18] different ones have seen the pillar of
[13:20] fire. And we're privileged if we get to
[13:22] see that. But remember Jesus said, even
[13:24] if you don't get to see it, you're more
[13:26] blessed if you believe without a without
[13:28] a sign. Amen. Because we don't want to
[13:30] become sign seekers. Hallelujah. We want
[13:32] to become holiness seekers. Hallelujah.
[13:35] We want to seek living the life that
[13:37] Jesus Christ presented to us. We want to
[13:40] manifest Christ in flesh, Christ in you,
[13:43] Christ in me, Christ in us, the hope of
[13:45] glory. Praise God. Amen. But I'm allowed
[13:48] to have my request. I know brother
[13:50] Brandham said the Holy Spirit said,
[13:51] "Would you like to look beyond the
[13:52] curtain of time?" Brother Brham said,
[13:53] "It would help me so much. It would help
[13:56] me so much sometime to see who's born
[13:58] again and who's not because I want to
[14:00] know that I'm born again. I want to see
[14:01] it in you. You want to see it in me. We
[14:03] want to see that we all have the Holy
[14:05] Ghost. Hallelujah.
[14:07] Oh my glory to God. Then I remember the
[14:10] word of the Lord in Acts
[14:12] 11:16. How that he said, "John indeed
[14:14] baptized with water, but ye shall be
[14:16] baptized with the Holy Ghost." Again, no
[14:19] mention of fire because the Holy Ghost
[14:21] is fire.
[14:22] Our God is a consuming fire. Oh, now now
[14:26] that opens that thought opens up where
[14:29] brother A ra says if you're born again
[14:31] you'll be in the word all the way. In
[14:34] other words, Judas stopped. He stopped
[14:35] at that point on uh the night of the
[14:38] arrest, a night of communion. He stopped
[14:40] right there wanting more of the word. He
[14:42] decided to betray the word, but
[14:43] everybody else went on to know the
[14:46] Lord. And that's what uh the Old
[14:48] Testament is a prophecy of that as well.
[14:50] Brother Cam preached it years ago. He
[14:52] said, the Bible said, I think it's
[14:53] Hosea, if you follow on to know the
[14:55] Lord, then you'll find me. Praise God.
[14:58] You got to follow hard. We looked at
[15:00] that verse last Sunday, follow hard
[15:02] after God. You got to get into the
[15:03] church age book or you got to get into
[15:05] prayer or you got to get into the the
[15:06] the sermons of Brother Brandon. You got
[15:08] to get into the Bible. You got to follow
[15:10] God. Hallelujah. He's going to lead you
[15:12] after the word of God. Hallelujah.
[15:15] You'll be in the word all the way.
[15:19] Hallelujah. Glory. So it was prophesied
[15:22] by the prophet John the Baptist, the
[15:24] spirit of Elijah. He said fire is going
[15:26] to come. Then the fire came and it was
[15:29] seen and
[15:30] heard. Now everybody has their own
[15:33] unique experience. Uh for example, I was
[15:37] crying and shouting with my hands up. My
[15:38] wife was just probably bowing and crying
[15:40] there and praising God there. Uh New
[15:42] Jersey, was it New Jersey? Okay. Yeah.
[15:44] Sometimes I always forget that places.
[15:46] Uh but if if somebody would have walked
[15:48] by, they would have seen her crying or
[15:49] maybe sobbing or, you know, seeing and
[15:51] hearing. You got to have some type of a
[15:54] seeing and hearing experience where
[15:56] everybody can see something's happened.
[15:58] This person, God's moving on their
[16:00] heart, they're born again. Hallelujah.
[16:02] And church, then we'll see it in your
[16:04] life. A new life will emerge. Just like
[16:06] when a baby's born. Yeah. I can feel
[16:09] baby Tulsi kick. I felt her kick. I've
[16:11] seen her kick on my wife's stomach
[16:12] there. You I can see the kicks. But then
[16:14] I see the life's there. And that's how
[16:16] sanctification is, right? You can see
[16:17] something's happening there. Praise God.
[16:20] But then when it emerges, it's totally
[16:21] different. Praise God. Now they can
[16:24] really stretch out. Hallelujah. Now they
[16:26] they really begin to grow.
[16:29] And then they start
[16:30] talking. Then they start leaping and
[16:32] dancing and all over the place. It's a
[16:34] total new life. And everybody has to
[16:36] have that experience where you get a new
[16:38] life. Hallelujah.
[16:41] I like that. I like the jerking. I like
[16:43] that in there. for the the jerking and
[16:44] the moving and the I like that. That's
[16:46] good. That's good. But let's get the
[16:48] full life of Christ. Hallelujah.
[16:51] Because that's what we're allowed to
[16:52] have by the grace of
[16:54] God. What did the fire produce, church?
[16:57] What did the what the burning produce?
[16:59] Jesus tells us what it was going to
[17:00] produce. Acts 1 vers8. But ye shall
[17:03] receive
[17:05] power. That's what it
[17:07] produces. After that, the Holy Ghost has
[17:09] come upon you. So they were going to get
[17:11] more power. Sound familiar? Like the
[17:13] parable of the wise virgins, more oil.
[17:17] The foolish had a little bit, but the
[17:19] wise had more power, more oil. Praise
[17:22] God. To last them until the bridegroom
[17:25] came. Hallelujah. And ye shall be
[17:28] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[17:31] all Judea and Samaria, and unto the
[17:33] uttermost part of the
[17:35] earth. Now, the main difference in their
[17:38] witness wasn't amongst the believers. It
[17:40] was amongst the sinners.
[17:43] Because on the night of Jesus' arrest,
[17:45] where did they show their weakness? When
[17:46] they when when life and death was on the
[17:48] line,
[17:50] right? When they're going to get
[17:51] arrested and they can you imagine 11
[17:53] grown men. Can you imagine 11 grown men
[17:55] running away from a band of Roman
[17:56] soldiers? Men that some of them walked
[17:58] on water. Some of them prayed for the
[18:01] the sick and they were healed. I mean,
[18:03] they saw all these miracles, but they
[18:05] run away from a band of Roman soldiers.
[18:07] So, the main power was going to be in
[18:10] how they witness to unbelievers.
[18:13] Hallelujah. And that's how it is in your
[18:14] life, too. Are you going to stand up uh
[18:17] for Jesus Christ when you're around your
[18:19] family and they're all saying, "It's
[18:20] okay. Just give in." No. If you got the
[18:22] Holy Ghost, you'll stand up and you'll
[18:24] stand on God's word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:27] That's right. That's what it's given you
[18:29] for. It's given you for power. The fire
[18:32] is supposed to be a greater fire than
[18:34] the than than the devil's burning. There
[18:36] it is. The the the devil's burning
[18:38] arrows of temptation. You got a fire
[18:40] that's greater than that fire.
[18:42] Hallelujah. You just put up your shield
[18:44] of faith and it extinguishes every fiery
[18:46] dart cuz you got a greater fire in you
[18:49] than the devil has. Hallelujah.
[18:53] That's right. This is what Jesus says.
[18:56] It produces it produces
[18:59] power. Hallelujah. When it comes on you
[19:02] and you should be witnesses unto me both
[19:04] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[19:06] Samaria and to the uttermost parts of
[19:08] the earth. Praise
[19:10] God. So we see though. Now notice Acts
[19:12] chapter 2:3. Let's go back there. Acts
[19:15] 2:3. I want to get into this thought
[19:17] here. I want you to see what happened,
[19:21] church. The fire appeared. Cloven
[19:24] tongues of fire. Think of that. And it
[19:26] the Bible said it sat on each one of
[19:28] them. Now we don't know exactly where.
[19:30] Most people draw it right above the
[19:31] forehead because uh God likens the Holy
[19:33] Ghost as a seal on your forehead in the
[19:36] book of Revelation, right? All right?
[19:38] Because this is where the frontal lobe
[19:39] of the brain. If you look at the frontal
[19:41] lobe, that's where decisions are made.
[19:42] So when you're born again, the Holy
[19:44] Ghost, you make your decisions based
[19:45] upon God's word. Hallelujah.
[19:48] Glory.
[19:50] So it sat. And notice it sat. The Holy
[19:53] Ghost rested on
[19:56] them. It took a seat right in their
[19:58] life. I'm glad Jesus came and take a se
[20:01] seat in my life. That's who I needed to
[20:02] come take a seat because I wasn't I I
[20:06] was in no position to lead myself.
[20:09] I need a shepherd. Amen. So does the
[20:13] church. So So does every believer needs
[20:16] a shepherd to lead us and guide us. We
[20:19] need a divine fire. We need the spirit
[20:22] of burning to stay with us. Amen.
[20:27] See now notice now church if you know
[20:30] the and you also know that the Holy
[20:31] Ghost is a seal that means a brand or
[20:34] like a a permanent mark a burn there it
[20:36] is a burning again the burning of a
[20:38] brand praise God it's the burning of a
[20:40] brand on cattle or whatever type of
[20:42] animal they have to brand it's
[20:44] permanently ingrained it's permanently
[20:47] burned into you praise God
[20:50] and so the eyes of the disciples were
[20:52] open for a few moments even women right
[20:55] Jesus' mother Mary was there. So, they
[20:56] were open just for a few moments. The
[20:58] fire of God is here. The fire is resting
[21:00] on me. It's not leaving me. The fire of
[21:02] God staying on me. Praise God.
[21:05] Now, we would picture it, you know, we
[21:07] would picture it here in our soul
[21:08] because we have the three realms, right?
[21:09] You have the body, the spirit, and then
[21:11] you got the soul, right? You see our
[21:13] pictures of the three circles. Brother
[21:14] said, "That's what it's like. It's like
[21:15] a circle, and then there's a circle
[21:17] inside of a circle and another circle
[21:18] inside of another circle." Just to make
[21:20] it simple. And and brother said, "You're
[21:22] a trinity just like God's a
[21:24] trinity." Not a trinity of persons, a
[21:27] trinity of manifestations or parts.
[21:30] Hallelujah. That's what my video was
[21:32] about yesterday. All the positive uh
[21:34] ways brother used the word trinity. He
[21:37] used it very positively at times. And
[21:40] some people uh might think, "Oh, brother
[21:42] never believed in the trinity." I have
[21:43] quotes. Brother says, "How we love the
[21:45] third person of the
[21:50] trinity." And then uh eight years later,
[21:52] he'd say, "Thus say the Lord,
[21:54] trinitarianism is of the
[21:56] devil." I found a quote, someone someone
[21:59] said, they're very kind, but they said,
[22:00] "Brother, I've never believed in the
[22:01] trinity." I found a quote from 1952.
[22:02] Brother said, "I believe in the third
[22:04] person of the Trinity is here today. I
[22:06] believe." I thought, "Well, there that
[22:08] that that's proof right there." People
[22:10] can say whatever they want, but God's
[22:12] spirit always reveals the truth. Amen.
[22:14] What am I saying? I'm saying that we can
[22:16] have an understanding. God even winks at
[22:18] our ignorance when we don't understand
[22:20] something. But then there comes a time
[22:22] he's not going to wink anymore because
[22:23] now he's like, "Okay, here's the truth.
[22:24] You must accept the truth." Amen. That's
[22:27] what happened to brother Brandham. He
[22:28] grew in revelation, right? But and he
[22:30] was even born again just like just like
[22:32] John Wesley, just like Martin Luther.
[22:34] They believed in the trinity,
[22:36] right? But it was off the word a little
[22:39] bit. and church and you know uh and you
[22:41] know the churches that teach it some of
[22:43] their teachings are close to the truth
[22:45] but then there's some that are totally
[22:47] far far away like tritheists like they
[22:49] believe three persons are three gods but
[22:51] still one god they actually say that
[22:52] three gods but Ram says if you believe
[22:54] in three gods that's from hell but those
[22:57] that don't some of them are really close
[22:58] to the truth and they haven't let it
[23:01] overtak in their lives that's called
[23:03] they're being sanctified
[23:05] but what we need is a revelation amen
[23:09] What prevails against the gates of hell?
[23:11] A revelation. Praise God. And brother
[23:13] Ram calls it Godhead. He calls the
[23:15] capstone revelation of the Godhead is
[23:17] that Jesus is God. Amen. Who is Jesus?
[23:22] He's
[23:23] God. God manifest in the flesh. He was
[23:26] Emanuel. Not a second person with us,
[23:28] but God with us. Hallelujah.
[23:34] The fire
[23:36] produces Hallelujah. a power in your
[23:39] life that you didn't have
[23:41] before. That's what it'll produce.
[23:43] Another portion of power. And notice, it
[23:46] doesn't leave you. It rests on
[23:50] you. That's because that's what you and
[23:52] I need. We need a power to stay with us,
[23:54] not a power that leaves us. Now, where
[23:57] does it leave? In the human spirit,
[23:58] church. That's where it leaves. But if
[24:00] you're born again, it never leaves your
[24:03] soul. It just leaves your mind when you
[24:05] choose not to meditate on the things of
[24:07] God.
[24:09] Everybody with me? And brother likens it
[24:11] unto a dove, right? Brother says the
[24:14] anointing in your spirit, in your mind
[24:15] is like a dove. You think the right
[24:17] thoughts or you think evil thoughts or
[24:18] you say things, the dove flies away. But
[24:20] brother, brother said he goes to roost
[24:22] not far away. Let's say he's right up
[24:23] here. Brother said he's not that far
[24:25] away from you. All you got to do is
[24:27] repent and then he swoops back down. Oh,
[24:29] what a blessing. He swoops back down. As
[24:31] soon as you repent and he comes back in
[24:34] your mind, then he anoints your mind,
[24:35] too. Oh, he's not far away. He'll never
[24:37] leave you nor forsake you. He's right
[24:39] with you. Praise God.
[24:41] Even Genevie come up to the altar on
[24:43] Wednesday and repented of a certain sin.
[24:46] And after she repents, she's weeping and
[24:48] crying, happy again. And that's why I
[24:50] said, look how close God's not far away
[24:53] from us. It's actually the spirit of God
[24:55] that's letting us know we're wrong so he
[24:57] can come back to us. That's right.
[25:00] And that was just how about how she
[25:02] treats her siblings. Now, what about us
[25:04] adults?
[25:06] How we treat each
[25:08] other. Thank you, Lord, for sending us
[25:11] the humble
[25:12] children and humble adults because
[25:15] that's what we want to be. We want to be
[25:16] humble. I want to be humble. Praise God.
[25:18] Just a fresh reminder how that's how
[25:20] close God is. God's not off some far
[25:21] away. Remember Acts 17 said he's so
[25:24] close. In him we live and move and have
[25:26] our being. He's not far from us. The
[25:28] Bible said he just want God just wants
[25:30] us to reach out and fellowship with him.
[25:33] That's right. So notice I want to just
[25:36] labor on this point. Maybe this will be
[25:38] the main point of my sermon
[25:40] here. The fire produces a a burning that
[25:44] stays with
[25:46] you. It rests upon you. It rested upon
[25:50] them and then it rests upon you as a
[25:54] believer in your soul. Jesus said this
[25:57] in Matthew 11:29. So I'm going to have
[25:59] you moving uh real fast
[26:02] here. Remember it sat on them in Acts
[26:04] 2:3. But Matthew 1129, Jesus foretold
[26:08] us. He said, "Take my yoke upon you,
[26:10] learn of me, for I'm meek and lowly in
[26:12] heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
[26:16] souls." But what was this prophesying
[26:18] of? It wasn't of Saturday. Well, do I
[26:20] worship on Saturday or Sunday? They
[26:22] already had Saturday worship.
[26:24] It didn't matter really which day you
[26:25] worship on. We honor Sunday because it's
[26:28] the day of the resurrection. The
[26:29] greatest day with the greatest message
[26:31] in human history. Brother said the
[26:32] greatest news, the greatest message that
[26:35] ever struck the earth is that Jesus is
[26:36] not dead. Jesus is alive.
[26:40] The greatest message, brother, there
[26:41] could be no greater message than that.
[26:44] Hallelujah. Thank the Lord.
[26:46] Glory. So, see, it gives you rest. So,
[26:49] it maybe they saw it above their
[26:50] foreheads. Maybe they saw it right above
[26:52] their their souls. The Bible said
[26:54] there's a little hole in your heart
[26:55] perhaps. I'm not a doctor, but there's a
[26:57] little place in your heart there that
[26:58] the Holy Spirit might rest. He said it
[27:00] looks like a little small button. Looks
[27:02] like a little white button when you get
[27:03] born again. Then the power just grows,
[27:06] right? Right. Because you give more
[27:07] preeminence for God in your life.
[27:10] Hallelujah.
[27:12] Now, this was also prophesied in Isaiah
[27:14] 28:12. So, if got your Bibles, you can
[27:16] read it yourself if you'd like to.
[27:19] Isaiah 28:12.
[27:21] to whom he said, "This is the rest,
[27:24] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[27:26] rest, and this is the refreshing, yet
[27:29] they would not hear." Now, I'm going to
[27:32] go there because it speaks of the
[27:33] stammering lips, and that one I didn't
[27:35] write down, but I want you to see
[27:37] it.
[27:39] 28 now. Yes. Yes. Okay. Now, we read
[27:43] verse 12, but go back up to eight. For
[27:45] all the tables are full of vomit and
[27:47] filthiness, and there's no place
[27:48] unclean. That was the Pharisees and
[27:52] Sadducees. God was sick with their
[27:54] religion that had no Holy Ghost. And the
[27:56] church said, "Doesn't that remind you,
[27:59] church, of Revelation 3?" Jesus spews
[28:01] them. He vomits them out of his mouth
[28:03] because they don't want the real Holy
[28:05] Ghost.
[28:06] It's thus sayith the Lord. It's of the
[28:08] devil. If they don't have the real Holy
[28:10] Ghost,
[28:12] hallelujah. And God just vi God gets
[28:14] sick with their worship. Just vomits it
[28:16] out of his mouth. They won't speak for
[28:18] God. Oh, we're I tell you, we're a
[28:20] privileged people if God is speaking
[28:21] through our church. I'm a privileged
[28:24] pastor. Every evangelist, every prophet,
[28:27] every apostle is privileged if Jesus
[28:30] Christ is preaching through them.
[28:31] Hallelujah.
[28:33] Amen. Because it's a rare thing to have
[28:36] the real Holy Ghost preaching.
[28:38] Hallelujah.
[28:42] Verse nine, whom shall he teach
[28:43] knowledge? Oh, we don't need all this
[28:45] doctrine. We don't need all this
[28:46] teaching. shame on these
[28:49] people. Look at verse nine. And whom
[28:51] shall I make to
[28:52] understand? Doctrine. That's commands.
[28:55] The the simple commands of
[28:57] God. Them that are weaned from the milk,
[28:59] babies that are born. Hallelujah. That's
[29:03] right. And drawn from the breasts. And
[29:06] brother says it's like El Shadi, El
[29:08] Shadai, Old Testament and New
[29:10] Testament. Right. Verse 10. for precept.
[29:13] Command must be upon precept, precept
[29:15] upon precept, line upon line. Here a
[29:17] little, there a little, and there a
[29:19] little. So as you read the Bible, you
[29:20] find a little bit over here, little bit
[29:22] over here. You find a command there, a
[29:24] command there, and you're growing in the
[29:26] knowledge of God. Hallelujah.
[29:28] Glory. You can take preaching from from
[29:31] Isaiah. You can take preaching from
[29:33] John. You can take preaching from the
[29:34] book of Acts. You can take Revelation
[29:36] chapter 10. Hallelujah. You can take
[29:39] preaching on this because you're a child
[29:40] of God. And God is feeding you through
[29:43] this means of here a little, there a
[29:45] little. Here's a nursing, there's a
[29:47] nursing, I nurse in the morning, I nurse
[29:48] at the table, right, women? I nurse in
[29:51] the bedroom, I nurse all these places.
[29:53] Here a little, there a little. And
[29:54] pretty soon, the child of God grows up
[29:56] into a real solid believer. Hallelujah.
[29:59] That's somebody who's already born
[30:01] again. Praise God.
[30:04] And people say, "I don't have time to
[30:05] read the church book. I don't have
[30:06] time." Listen, Brother Bam. Well, you
[30:08] might it might not yet be time for your
[30:10] birth then.
[30:14] Hallelujah. If you're a baby, you make
[30:16] time to nurse. You cry until you get
[30:18] your
[30:21] nursing.
[30:23] Hallelujah. You you you say, "God, I
[30:25] need more of you. God, pour out a
[30:27] blessing." And you cry until you get it.
[30:29] Praise
[30:35] God. Look at verse 11. For with
[30:37] stammering lips and another tongue will
[30:38] I speak to this people. Now go to first
[30:41] uh Corinthians 14:21. This is speaking
[30:44] of the day of
[30:49] Pentecost. And then we got to verse 12.
[30:52] To whom said this is the rest. So the
[30:54] rest involves all of this. I got God's
[30:57] spirit resting in my soul and then I
[30:59] just feed on the word of God. I'm like a
[31:01] child. I I just need more of God. Like
[31:03] like the child has this uh just this
[31:05] this this brother Brandon calls it a
[31:07] thirst and thirst 1965. He just has this
[31:10] desire. I need the food. I need the
[31:12] food. I need to feed on the word. I need
[31:13] to feed. I need to nurse. All these
[31:15] things. But R said, that's how you are
[31:17] when you're born again.
[31:21] In the law, it is written, "With men of
[31:22] other I'm sorry, with men of other
[31:24] tongues and other lips will I speak on
[31:26] this people." And yet for all that they
[31:28] will not hear me, sayeth the Lord,
[31:30] speaking of
[31:31] Israel. 120 people are speaking in
[31:33] languages they don't even know. And
[31:35] everybody's understanding it in
[31:37] languages they know.
[31:39] And that wasn't enough to convince them.
[31:42] It's prophecy being fulfilled right in
[31:45] front of them. And that wasn't enough
[31:46] because they love their denomination,
[31:48] their old life, rather than a new Holy
[31:50] Ghost life. I trust everybody here
[31:52] doesn't want a denominational
[31:54] experience. They want a Holy Ghost life.
[31:56] Hallelujah. Amen. I don't want to live
[31:58] like I did in the old church. I don't
[32:00] want to live like I did those old days.
[32:01] I want to live the new life. I want the
[32:03] Holy Ghost to rest on me. Praise God. I
[32:06] want to experience the rest of God.
[32:08] Hallelujah.
[32:09] Rest on me, Holy Spirit. Anoint me.
[32:11] Praise God. Don't leave me. I can't do
[32:14] this life without you. Amen. Unless you
[32:17] rest on my life.
[32:21] That's right. So, see church, this is
[32:22] speaking of the baptism of the Holy
[32:24] Ghost. And then these preachers that
[32:25] say, "We don't need doctrines." What are
[32:26] they doing? They're just taken away from
[32:28] the word of God. They either got an
[32:30] awful complex and they're born again or
[32:31] they're just not born again.
[32:34] And God, I'm talking God help us to be
[32:36] born again.
[32:37] I'm just showing you people can get
[32:38] famous and be way off the word of God.
[32:40] Fame doesn't make somebody a preacher of
[32:42] God.
[32:45] It don't. What makes somebody a preacher
[32:47] of God is somebody who points you to the
[32:48] word of God by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[32:51] Hallelujah. And tells you what the word
[32:53] of God says.
[32:55] Hallelujah. Feeds them the word of God.
[32:57] Brothers, it gives you sheep food, not
[32:58] goat food. Now, I know a goat can eat
[33:00] anything, right? But that's a
[33:02] difference. A sheep won't eat
[33:03] everything. Hallelujah. Neither will a
[33:05] shepherd give uh the sheep bad food.
[33:07] Praise
[33:08] God. Glory.
[33:13] Now with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[33:16] not only do you have rest in the soul,
[33:17] but listen, that rest will move out into
[33:19] your flesh to anoint your body as well.
[33:21] So your body can rest. That's a little
[33:24] bit deeper thought, but Acts 2:26, this
[33:26] is what David said. David said, "Even my
[33:28] flesh." Now, of course, he was speaking
[33:30] of the
[33:32] resurrection. But church, we see this
[33:34] truth when the martyrs like Stephen are
[33:36] going to be martyed. We don't see their
[33:38] bodies shaken like, "Oh, I'm going to
[33:39] die. They're going to hit me with the
[33:40] stones." You don't see Paul like saying,
[33:42] "Oh, I uh maybe I should recant so I
[33:44] don't get my head cut off." See, the
[33:46] Holy Ghost rests on it. It comes so much
[33:49] anoints their mind and then it anoints
[33:50] their bodies as well. So, church, in our
[33:53] trials, we can expect the Holy Ghost to
[33:55] eventually anoint us so we can rest.
[33:58] talking about your body because your
[34:00] soul shall already have the rest of God
[34:02] when you're born again. Therefore, did
[34:04] my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad.
[34:06] Moreover, also my flesh shall rest in
[34:10] hope. Hallelujah. So, you've got hope
[34:12] when you're born again. You got hope in
[34:14] your soul. You want to put the hope in
[34:15] your mind. Like last night, I went to
[34:17] bed quoting u uh 1 Thessalonians
[34:21] 5. You know, I can't fall asleep anymore
[34:23] just laying on my my my back like this.
[34:25] I got to lay on my side. So, while I'm
[34:26] laying on my back, I'm like, I used to
[34:28] enjoy falling asleep like this. Uh, and
[34:31] I can't do it anymore. So, it's kind of
[34:34] sad. But 1 Thessalonians 5, I went to
[34:36] bed quoting 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 9.
[34:39] For God has not I said, "God has you've
[34:41] not appointed me to wrath, but to obtain
[34:43] salvation through our Lord Jesus
[34:45] Christ." I was quoting that scripture
[34:47] because I found in my mind I wasn't able
[34:49] to rest. So, I got to find a place of
[34:51] rest. Amen. And the best place of rest I
[34:53] know is in the word of God. Hallelujah.
[34:56] gave my mind a place of place of rest.
[34:58] And then nature, I slept pretty good.
[34:59] Slept about nine hours last night. Then
[35:01] my body had some
[35:03] rest. Hallelujah. That's what David
[35:06] said. My flesh is going to rest and
[35:07] hope. I know someday this body will be
[35:10] resurrected. Praise God. But I want you
[35:12] to see, church, even your flesh can have
[35:14] the Holy Ghost give it
[35:17] rest. Yes, it's going to be in your
[35:18] soul, but also it will move to your
[35:20] human spirit, your thinking. You'll be
[35:22] able to stop thinking and worrying about
[35:24] things. You have rest in your mind. Your
[35:26] mind will stop racing. And the church
[35:27] said, "And then your body can get
[35:30] physical rest as well. I'm a witness."
[35:32] Like I told you, nervous situations I've
[35:34] had. And then I just felt the spirit of
[35:36] God just come on my body. I knew my soul
[35:38] what what was right, but my body was
[35:40] nervous. And then the spirit of God
[35:42] comes on and I'm just all peace that
[35:44] passes understanding.
[35:46] See that? That's part that's part of the
[35:48] blessing of the baptism of the Holy
[35:49] Ghost. Gives you rest in all three
[35:52] realms.
[35:54] Uh, Acts 7:49. Acts
[35:59] 7:49. You need some kind of a reward
[36:05] acill. What house will you build me?
[36:08] Sayith the Lord. Or what is the place of
[36:10] my rest? See, Solomon thought it was
[36:12] going to be in a house and everybody
[36:13] wanted to build something for God. But
[36:16] the real place of rest is in your soul.
[36:18] Jesus said, "I'm giving you rest in your
[36:20] soul."
[36:22] That's the place God wants to rest.
[36:24] Hallelujah. It's in your soul. And then
[36:28] also, you'll get seasons of
[36:30] rest. There'll be times, brother Chris,
[36:32] feels like your life is falling apart,
[36:34] right? But then you'll get seasons of
[36:36] rest where it feels like, oh,
[36:37] everything's good. This is how life is
[36:40] supposed to be. This is a foretaste of
[36:41] the
[36:42] millennium. And the church said, got all
[36:45] your bills paid, food's on the table,
[36:48] got a little bit of savings.
[36:51] This feels like the millennium. Glory.
[36:54] Everything's good. Nobody's sick. That's
[36:56] nice when you got eight kids. Somebody's
[36:59] always sick or something. Acts 9:31.
[37:02] Acts
[37:04] 9:31. God will even give you years of
[37:07] rest. And we saw like remember I preach
[37:08] it uh Asa got 10 years of rest because
[37:11] he was obedient to the word of God. We
[37:13] got about six years of rest before
[37:14] trials hit our church. I'll take six
[37:16] years. I'll take five. I'll take three.
[37:18] Whatever God wants to give me. But then
[37:20] the churches had rest throughout all of
[37:21] Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were
[37:24] edified and they're walking in the fear
[37:26] of the Lord. In other words, I don't
[37:27] want any sin to come into our church. I
[37:29] don't want any sin to come into my life.
[37:30] I'm very careful what I look at, what I
[37:32] say. That's the fear of the Lord. I'm
[37:35] not going to give the devil an
[37:37] inch. And in the comfort of the Holy
[37:40] Ghost, they were
[37:42] multiplied. Hallelujah. So, see, see,
[37:45] see how this rests? It rests on your
[37:47] soul. But then also God gives you rest
[37:50] in your mind. Peace that passes all
[37:52] understanding. And then he gives you
[37:53] actually rest in your daily life. Enjoy
[37:56] the seasons of rest. I'll tell you, you
[37:57] better enjoy it. Praise God. Because
[37:59] when the trials come, it's hard to go to
[38:01] bed. Sometimes it's hard to wake up.
[38:03] Sometimes it's hard to get motivated.
[38:06] Sometimes because you go through such
[38:09] trials. I want to read this quote now.
[38:11] So I don't have a slide for this.
[38:14] You might know this quote if you've
[38:16] heard, you've been around the message a
[38:18] while. This is a a very popular quote.
[38:20] I've heard it since I've been in the
[38:21] message. Brother Vang probably would
[38:22] remember. Sister Beatatrice and Naomi
[38:25] and my wife probably would remember.
[38:28] It's a for years, you know, you see with
[38:30] the guest preachers, they they use
[38:32] certain quotes and then the preachers
[38:33] keep using that. It's like for time and
[38:35] season. It's a good thing. God will give
[38:37] you like a time and season, a quote, you
[38:39] know, like for a while, brother, it was
[38:41] a uh the mind is the greatest
[38:42] battlefield, right? We had sermons on
[38:44] that in in Lima. It seemed like every
[38:45] preacher coming the battlefield of the
[38:46] mind, battlefield of the mind, you know,
[38:48] and then we'll get sermons on, you know,
[38:49] maybe the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[38:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and then
[38:52] sermons on the Godhead and the
[38:53] importance of that one. And so, there
[38:56] was a time where this particular quote
[38:58] was uh being preached a lot, and now I
[39:00] understand why because we need
[39:04] rest. Brother Ram said, I was saying
[39:06] somewhere maybe here a few nights ago, I
[39:08] wanted to preach so bad. I preached to
[39:10] my wife in bed till 12:00 midnight just
[39:14] telling her of how glorious Jesus
[39:17] was. Preached till midnight in his bed
[39:20] to his
[39:22] wife. A text come in my heart. Now
[39:25] listen, it kept burning me. And the
[39:28] church said, "The spirit of burning came
[39:32] on." Brother Brandham, this is
[39:34] meditation. He's meditating on the
[39:36] things of God. said, "Oh, honey, can I
[39:38] just I know you're tired. I know we got
[39:41] three kids here at home. Can I just
[39:42] preach you a
[39:45] sermon?" He probably didn't say a little
[39:47] bit either. He said, "Can I just preach
[39:48] you a sermon?" Because then he would
[39:50] have been lying or not not telling the
[39:51] truth. He said, "It just kept burning me
[39:53] so great till I just couldn't rest with
[39:55] it." So, it's interesting. It's about
[39:57] rest, but then he couldn't rest till he
[39:59] had to tell
[40:00] somebody. I just said, "Honey, I want to
[40:02] preach a little while." and she roused
[40:05] up. By grace she
[40:07] listened. And church, may God help us as
[40:10] even husbands to listen sometimes to our
[40:11] wives when our wives want to tell us
[40:13] things. By grace, we can do it. Brother
[40:16] V, right, sisters? By grace, you can
[40:19] listen to your
[40:20] husband. See, it's always by
[40:23] grace. I love this quote. I said, "The
[40:26] Christian faith is based soundly upon
[40:31] rest." Now, does the quote sound
[40:32] familiar? That's right. A Christian is
[40:35] not tossed
[40:37] about. A Christian doesn't run from
[40:39] place to place. I'm going to run for my
[40:41] problems. I'm going to run to this
[40:42] church and now I'm going to run over
[40:43] that church and I'm going to run over
[40:44] here to that church. A lot of people do
[40:46] that on the other side of the state
[40:48] because they have lots of messed
[40:49] churches over there. And the churches
[40:52] are local and so they can just go from
[40:54] pick up one leave one church go right to
[40:56] the other. Sometimes they tell the
[40:57] pastor before they leave, sometimes they
[40:59] don't. And I'm not doubting them because
[41:01] when I first left, I didn't tell the
[41:03] pastor when I left. Now, I went back and
[41:04] apologized, though. You should always
[41:06] tell the pastor before you leave,
[41:10] right? A Christian doesn't run from
[41:12] place to place. A Christian doesn't fuss
[41:14] and fume and worry about things. A
[41:17] Christian rests. It's all over. It's all
[41:19] finished for the believer at Calvary.
[41:23] So, a Holy Ghost believer, even though
[41:26] they've got God in their soul, their
[41:28] rest or their foundation goes back to
[41:33] Calvary. That's right. Oh, sickness may
[41:37] come and disappointments. How many ever
[41:39] had
[41:40] disappointments? But the Christians at
[41:42] rest knowing this, that God's able to
[41:45] keep that which he has performed.
[41:49] Knowing that no matter what the thing is
[41:51] or how it looks, there's neither
[41:53] sickness, sorrow, death. There's neither
[41:56] star starvation or anything that can
[41:58] separate us from the love of God that's
[42:00] in Christ Jesus. That's Romans 8. We're
[42:03] at rest. Just let the old ship toss any
[42:06] way she wants to. The anchor holds you.
[42:12] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let life take
[42:15] whatever turn it may take. That's okay.
[42:18] I've got an anchor.
[42:21] That's what your whole life is based on.
[42:24] I'm not moving from my devotion to Jesus
[42:27] Christ.
[42:29] I got to anchor. The Bible said you got
[42:31] to anchor in your soul. And the Bible
[42:32] says anchor there beyond the curtain in
[42:34] heaven in the holiest of holiest in
[42:37] heaven. So our anch We're actually
[42:39] anchored to Jesus. He's our rock.
[42:41] Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:45] I don't think I've ever kept my wife to
[42:47] preach at night. Have I? In bed. There's
[42:50] been a couple times I was like I was
[42:51] just I know I remember I was by the uh
[42:54] the sink there in the in in the
[42:55] downstairs bathroom. I was like, can I
[42:56] just share this thought with you real
[42:57] quick? It's just I just got to
[43:00] share and you know then I was a little
[43:02] sad I did because you know maybe I
[43:03] didn't explain it right and so it didn't
[43:04] go over like I thought. I in my mind I'm
[43:06] thinking like oh my wife's gonna be
[43:08] really excited and maybe I probably
[43:09] didn't explain it very good. I'm like I
[43:11] should have kept it to myself.
[43:14] Right? Because I I can't I can't give
[43:16] somebody I can't make them see it the
[43:19] way I see it. And maybe my words were
[43:20] all cut up anyway. That would be the
[43:22] norm. I'm just trying to learn how to
[43:24] pronounce words
[43:30] still. He said, "I come by a harbor one
[43:33] time and I seen that we was flying in a
[43:35] plane coming down low. There's a big old
[43:37] ship there. the sails had been let down,
[43:39] you know, and that old ship was rocking
[43:42] back and forth. Some waves would go in
[43:44] and some waves would go under and
[43:45] everything. I said, "Why? Wonder why is
[43:47] that?" And a fellow sitting there said,
[43:49] "It's got a sea anchor in it. Therefore,
[43:52] the ship can't sink." He said, "It can
[43:54] go through the waves, but it can't sink
[43:56] because it's anchored." So he sees the
[43:59] storms and waves come up all over and it
[44:01] just seems like everything everything
[44:03] every trial is of life is being tossed
[44:06] on this ship but it stays afloat.
[44:08] Church, God wants you to stay afloat and
[44:11] God made a way for you to stay afloat.
[44:13] You've got to anchor. It's the word of
[44:15] God.
[44:17] Preaching to you this morning, too.
[44:20] Hallelujah. Some waves we can go over
[44:23] and some waves go under us. Ever felt
[44:25] like that? Your life got picked up from
[44:26] underneath you? Woo! That p kind of
[44:28] picked me up a little bit. I didn't see
[44:30] that one coming. Other times it comes
[44:32] over. You're like, "Oh my goodness, I
[44:33] was ambushed by this one." Sometimes it
[44:36] knocks you up because it comes under
[44:37] you. Whoop. And then other times it's
[44:38] like, "Oh, I'm covered." Life's trials
[44:41] are covered all over me, but I'm still
[44:43] here. God kept me from sinking.
[44:46] Hallelujah. I'm still floating. I'm
[44:48] still sailing on life. Salem main.
[44:50] Hallelujah. Because I've got an anchor.
[44:52] Hallelujah.
[44:54] Glory. Amen.
[44:57] Brother Ram says, Brother Ram says that
[44:58] anchor then is your rest.
[45:03] I've got an anchor that will keep
[45:05] me. I'm going to be tossed. I'm going to
[45:07] get uh things under me. I'm going to
[45:08] have the things come over me, but I'm
[45:11] not going to sink.
[45:15] He said, "Oh, praise God. We got to
[45:17] anchor." He says, "Regardless, it isn't
[45:21] the ship doing the holding." Listen,
[45:23] church, it's the anchor doing the
[45:25] holding.
[45:27] It isn't what I am or what I will be or
[45:30] what I was. Look at that. What I was,
[45:32] what I am, what it's not about me.
[45:35] It's what he is now. And what he did for
[45:39] me and you. It ain't what I can do. It's
[45:42] what he has done.
[45:46] My faith doesn't anchor in what the
[45:48] coming meetings will be.
[45:51] But I wasn't judging. Well, I'll be a
[45:52] Christian if the next services are
[45:54] pretty good. If not, well, maybe I'm not
[45:56] going to maybe I'm not called to
[45:59] preach. That's not what your faith rests
[46:01] in. That's why we got to go through the
[46:04] seasons. Every church has to go through
[46:05] seasons of ups and downs, different
[46:07] trials. And and we got to learn, we're
[46:09] not anchored in what we expect to happen
[46:11] or what our ideas. We're anchored in
[46:14] Jesus Christ.
[46:18] That's right.
[46:22] My faith doesn't rest in any ability
[46:25] that I have. Let's let's say that. Say
[46:27] any ability. Ready? Any ability. Your
[46:29] faith isn't in your ability
[46:32] or what the church I should
[46:35] join. You're not anchored even by this
[46:39] church or what people I should associate
[46:41] with. I'm not anchored in my friends and
[46:43] my close friends. I'm not anchored in
[46:45] them. Like I I tell people, people can
[46:47] come and go. I'm anchored in Christ.
[46:49] Hallelujah. Amen. And I will be by God's
[46:52] grace because I've learned you don't
[46:54] trust in man. You trust in God.
[46:58] My faith anchors and rests entirely upon
[47:01] the finished work of the Lord Jesus
[47:04] Christ that's already been received in
[47:07] heaven.
[47:09] Praise God. And this is what he had to
[47:12] preach to his wife. Let me tell you
[47:14] about this boat I saw when I was flying
[47:16] in the other a couple weeks ago in the
[47:18] harbor. This this was awesome. Honey,
[47:19] listen to
[47:21] me. Stay up. Wake up. Sit
[47:24] up. I want to tell you, I saw waves go
[47:26] under. I said waves come over. I saw all
[47:29] these things, but yet the anchor held.
[47:31] And that's what the Christian does. I
[47:32] rest in the work of Christ.
[47:36] Thanks,
[47:41] darling. That's probably what she did
[47:43] because mama's got one of the hardest
[47:44] jobs out there.
[47:49] God justified him by raising him from
[47:52] the dead. This is my beloved son whom
[47:54] I'm well pleased. And God raised him up
[47:56] from the dead for our
[47:58] justification. No wonder the poet said,
[48:00] "Living he loved me." Remember he saying
[48:02] that song? Dying he say be buried. He
[48:04] carried my sins far away. Rising
[48:06] justified freely forever. Someday he's
[48:08] coming. Oh glorious day. The Christian
[48:12] rests in that hope upon the stormy seas.
[48:16] Sure, storms rise, all kinds of
[48:19] troubles, but we're anchored. That's
[48:21] all. It'll never sink. Now, listen. It
[48:24] can't sink.
[48:27] Your life can't sink into the mires and
[48:30] and and despicable sins and addictions
[48:34] of life. You can't sink in that.
[48:37] [Music]
[48:39] Because you're anchored. Hallelujah.
[48:42] That's what brother's talking about
[48:43] about the invincible army. It's not that
[48:46] we'll we'll we'll get a spot where we'll
[48:47] stop sitting. It's that no matter what
[48:49] comes, no matter what trials we go
[48:51] through, we've got an anchor.
[48:52] Hallelujah. And we will stand because
[48:54] our anchor strong. Praise God. That's
[48:58] why we stand.
[49:00] That ship didn't stand because of its
[49:02] own ability. The ship stood because of
[49:04] the anchor. Hallelujah.
[49:06] It's rest. It rested in the anchor.
[49:09] Amen.
[49:13] That's why when people use that
[49:14] invincible army, you got to look at it
[49:15] like that. It's an invincible ship
[49:17] because of the anchor.
[49:20] The builder. Glory. The builder of the
[49:22] ship is the one who gets all the credit
[49:23] because the builder ship remembered to
[49:24] put an anchor on there. And God
[49:27] remembered to put an anchor in you. It's
[49:29] called the fire of God.
[49:31] Hallelujah. The life of God. The
[49:33] consuming fire of God that wants to
[49:35] consume all your life. Hallelujah.
[49:39] Now, I've noticed many Christians in
[49:40] life to be up and down. I've wondered
[49:43] about that. Why are people so tossed
[49:46] about? This is from the sermon, Why are
[49:48] people so tossed about?
[49:51] 1956. You find them. They seem to be
[49:54] very religious, seem to have such a deep
[49:56] desire. They daily they search and hunt
[49:58] and seek for God, but never come to any
[50:00] settlement of any kind to where they
[50:02] could ever be settled or anchored in
[50:04] Christ.
[50:06] And this I've learned to be an
[50:07] experience that it's people of
[50:09] intellectuals. So other words, when we
[50:11] think too much about it and we don't and
[50:13] we try to when we try to understand
[50:15] everything, we get tossed back and
[50:17] forth. And brother, I'm saying we just
[50:20] can't we can't get to the spot where we
[50:21] try to figure everything out. We got to
[50:23] go back to the fact that I'm anchored in
[50:25] Jesus. What did Jesus do for me? What
[50:27] did he accomplish for me? I need Jesus.
[50:30] Jesus is my only hope. He's my only
[50:32] stay. I'm not saved because of myself.
[50:34] I'm saved because of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[50:39] Amen. And church, we've all been tossed
[50:41] about to some degree.
[50:44] But brother, I've noticed, you know,
[50:45] there's people that just seem more
[50:46] solid. He goes on to say, he said, they
[50:49] just seem so happy all the time.
[50:54] Now, church, nobody's perfect, so
[50:56] they're not happy all the time, but they
[50:58] appear to be happy most of the time. He
[51:00] said, because they're resting in what
[51:01] Jesus Christ did for them. And he goes
[51:04] on to later to say there was three
[51:06] courts. There's the outer court, the
[51:08] holy place, and the holist of holies.
[51:09] And brother said, "Some people live out
[51:11] here in the outer court, and they
[51:13] experience the sun and the rain and the
[51:14] winds and the floods that we're seeing
[51:16] out there. They experience all this." So
[51:18] they're up and down. He said, "We got to
[51:20] live in the holiest of holies because
[51:22] the weather doesn't impact the presence
[51:24] of God.
[51:26] Your trials of life don't impact what's
[51:28] going on in the Holiest of Holies."
[51:31] Right? Amen.
[51:33] That's the point of this sermon. And
[51:35] brother uses those three steps of
[51:37] Ezekiel. New heart, new spirit, my
[51:39] spirit. Praise God. Brother uses that
[51:42] illustration. You got to live in the
[51:44] presence of God. In other words, if
[51:45] you're in that ship, you just got to
[51:46] trust. I've got an anchor. Church,
[51:48] sometimes some of us just need to go
[51:49] over to the side of our boat and say,
[51:50] "Where is that anchor?" Some I feel like
[51:52] it's a straw. I got to make sure it's
[51:54] there. Just go look over the side. Just
[51:57] go grab a hold of that chain. Glory. Put
[52:00] your hands on that chain. Just make sure
[52:02] the anchor is going to hold. It'll be a
[52:03] great reminder that God's with you.
[52:05] Hallelujah. That God's for you, that God
[52:08] has anchored his word into your life.
[52:11] Praise God. And you try to pull it up.
[52:13] You can't pull it up.
[52:15] Hallelujah. And God made it that way.
[52:17] Hallelujah. It's not about your power.
[52:19] It's about the power of God. Hallelujah.
[52:26] Hallelujah.
[52:28] Thank God the anchor holds.
[52:31] I just thought I'd just review this real
[52:32] quick. I know we're coming up on Good
[52:34] Friday and Easter. I And just I don't
[52:36] think we'll have a Good Friday service
[52:37] this year because of Brother Rod and I
[52:39] were talking about something. We might
[52:40] have to go do an errand special like a
[52:42] special errand. So just FYI. Uh and this
[52:45] will be the first year I'm home for
[52:46] Easter in a couple years here by God's
[52:47] grace. I've been down at brother Cams
[52:49] for Easter the last few years and before
[52:50] that I was down in Columbus for Easter.
[52:52] Seemed like people wanted me to preach
[52:53] Easter meetings for a while.
[52:55] But remember, brother said in uh uh that
[52:58] day on Calvary, it was uh September
[53:00] 25th, 1960. Brother said, "Calvary did
[53:03] three things to you." So, let me say
[53:04] like this. The anchor did three things
[53:05] for you. First, it settled the sin
[53:10] question. Are you going to have to
[53:11] suffer for your sins? It settled that
[53:14] Jesus already suffered for all your
[53:16] sins.
[53:18] Am I going to get uh eternally punished?
[53:21] Not I'm sorry. Am I going to eternally
[53:23] annihilated? Am I going to be done away
[53:24] because of my sins? That question is
[53:26] settled.
[53:28] Jesus dropped the charges against me
[53:31] because he paid my fine. The Bible said
[53:33] he nailed it to the cross. So all the
[53:35] all the sins against you was already
[53:37] nailed to the cross. It's already been
[53:39] paid for. Your sin's already been
[53:40] judged. Hallelujah.
[53:43] The sin question is settled.
[53:47] This is what you can rest on. He said,
[53:48] "I rest on the finished work of Jesus
[53:51] Christ.
[53:55] Second, what did Calvary do? It broke
[53:58] the powers of Satan on your life.
[54:02] And it, he says, and it opened the
[54:04] prison doors.
[54:07] So, not only did the spirit of God
[54:08] forgive you, the spirit of God then
[54:10] broke your chains. And you don't have to
[54:13] be a slave to this where I can't get
[54:15] over this. I feel like I'm I'm just
[54:17] chained to this. The Holy Ghost broke
[54:19] those chains. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:22] And now you're free. That's what Isaiah
[54:25] said. He come to set the prisoners free.
[54:28] Everybody said there sometimes you just
[54:30] got to realize you forget you're free.
[54:32] Let's read it. Isaiah 61. Let's read it.
[54:35] I'm already in Isaiah 29. So that worked
[54:37] out pretty
[54:46] good. Verse 1 1611. The spirit of the
[54:50] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[54:51] me to preach good tidings and to the
[54:53] meek. He hath sent me to bind up the
[54:56] broken heart, to heal the broken
[54:58] hearts, to proclaim liberty to the
[55:01] captives and the opening of the prison
[55:03] to them that are bound, to proclaim the
[55:05] acceptable year of the Lord. Now, any
[55:06] Bible reader knows at that point Jesus
[55:09] ended his reading in Luke chapter 4 when
[55:11] he was in the synagogue. He didn't say
[55:13] about this being the day of judgment. Go
[55:15] to verse two. Uh verse two, Jesus, stop
[55:19] right there because brother Ram says the
[55:21] day of judgment wasn't here
[55:24] yet. So what does that mean? This is the
[55:27] year of Jubilee.
[55:29] It's a spiritual year. And we've only
[55:31] had two days in this year because we had
[55:33] 2,000 years. We got a whole year. I
[55:36] said, I just we got a whole eternity,
[55:37] church. Hallelujah. So let me tell you,
[55:40] if your heart's broken, then Jesus is
[55:42] here to fix your heart. Amen. My heart's
[55:46] been fixed because of Jesus Christ.
[55:50] If you're bound up, Jesus is there to
[55:52] set you free. Praise God. But you got to
[55:55] hate the chains. Like brother says, all
[55:57] you got to do is walk away from your
[55:59] chains. That's all. Just walk away. Just
[56:03] walk into a holy just start walking on
[56:05] the highway of holiness. Praise God. I
[56:07] hope I never punch you one of these
[56:09] days. I'm like, holiness.
[56:11] Glory. Amen. You it just you don't have
[56:14] to be chained up. He set you free. You'd
[56:17] block it
[56:19] anyway. Look at
[56:22] that. He says, "Oh, the the prison has
[56:24] been open. All you got to do is walk
[56:27] out. Free man, free woman, you're free."
[56:30] That's the second thing that Calvary did
[56:32] for you. Praise God. It settled the
[56:35] question. The court doesn't have any
[56:37] more records of your wrongs.
[56:39] There's nothing against you. Jesus paid
[56:42] your fine. Hallelujah.
[56:45] And then he broke your chains and then
[56:47] he opened up the prison. All he's got to
[56:49] do is walk out and enjoy your new life.
[56:50] Praise God.
[56:52] Amen. That's all you got to do. Amen.
[56:56] And then Barb said, "What's the third
[56:57] thing it did?" He said, "The third thing
[56:59] it did was it showed what we should do
[57:03] in return." And that is to have power to
[57:06] be a witness unto Jesus. Whether we're
[57:09] at Amazon or CPPley Ferlone City
[57:12] Schools, what's the name of your uh
[57:14] factory, Brother
[57:16] Vang Kasera, or whether you're an
[57:19] entrepreneur with your own business or
[57:21] wherever you are, whether you're working
[57:23] for the government or whe whether you're
[57:25] working on the police force or wherever
[57:27] you're working, he said, "Be a witness
[57:29] unto Jerusalem, Samaria, to Akran, to
[57:32] Doylestown, to Ka Falls, wherever you
[57:35] are, be a witness. You have power to do
[57:37] it." Praise God.
[57:39] I'm giving you power. This is what
[57:41] Calvary did. No more sin. No more
[57:44] chains. Open prison doors. And now you
[57:46] got a job to do for Jesus.
[57:50] Hallelujah. Is that enough for us or
[57:53] not? That should be enough for us.
[57:56] And that should be the anchor that we
[57:59] need in our lives to overcome the storms
[58:02] of life.
[58:05] There could be no greater words. It's a
[58:08] spirit of God. He's going to heal your
[58:10] heart. He's going to give you liberty.
[58:13] You're no longer a slave. He's going to
[58:16] open the prison doors and proclaim this
[58:18] is the year of
[58:20] Jubilee. This is the hour of your
[58:22] freedom. Go back to where your
[58:24] inheritance. Go back to what you should
[58:26] be doing. Amen. That's what the man
[58:29] would do. He was a slave for six years.
[58:30] on the seventh year, on the fifth year,
[58:32] whichever one it was, whatever he he uh
[58:34] was ent indentured and servant into, all
[58:36] he had to do is go back, where's my
[58:37] daddy? Where was my mama? All he had to
[58:40] do is go back to where his family was.
[58:42] And that's what you've done. You just
[58:43] come to your family. Just come back to
[58:45] your family and start doing what God's
[58:47] called you to do. Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:49] Praise God. Amen. This is the year of
[58:51] Jubilee. Praise God. Freedom to the
[58:54] captives.
[58:56] You don't have to be free. Just walk
[58:58] away from it. Amen. Brother Ram also
[59:01] told a person too uh she uh this woman
[59:05] had an addiction to just a temper. And
[59:08] brother Ram says she said it's like a
[59:10] snake that bothers me. Brother said you
[59:12] don't have to fight the snake. He said
[59:14] just walk away from the
[59:15] snake. Now most of you don't like snakes
[59:18] around
[59:19] here. I don't either so much. I'm not a
[59:22] big fan of them. They are quite amazing.
[59:23] Like the Bible said they're quite
[59:24] amazing on a rock how they move. They
[59:27] got a lot of that beauty left too, you
[59:29] know, with the scales and everything.
[59:31] But brother said, "Why stand there and
[59:32] try to fight it? I rebuke the
[59:33] bitterness. I rebuke the hatred. I
[59:35] rebuke I just stop thinking about it."
[59:38] He said, "Just walk away. Stop focusing
[59:40] on your faults." In other words, stop
[59:42] focusing on the prison. Oh, oh, I hate
[59:44] this prison. Stop pounding the bars. All
[59:46] you got to do is just walk out of the
[59:47] bars.
[59:49] Just leave it. Amen. Just leave it
[59:51] behind and walk in the freedom. Walk in
[59:54] the liberty. Start loving the ways of
[59:56] God. Hallelujah. Just start sailing.
[59:58] Hallelujah. Just start sailing in the
[1:00:00] ways of God. Hallelujah.
[1:00:06] So, what is that? That's like a complex,
[1:00:07] right? Just, oh, I can't can't get my
[1:00:09] mind off this sin. Just overcome your
[1:00:12] complex. I'm free from the complex. I
[1:00:14] don't have to be a slave of this
[1:00:17] complex. Come
[1:00:20] on. How many want to have the rest of
[1:00:22] God?
[1:00:25] But the man said, "It's your
[1:00:26] foundation." In other words, when you
[1:00:28] feel like life's falling apart, you
[1:00:29] better go check the
[1:00:31] foundation. Hallelujah. And that
[1:00:33] foundation is the finished work of Jesus
[1:00:36] Christ. What did Jesus do for me? He did
[1:00:39] everything
[1:00:41] and then
[1:00:42] some. He did. What I mean by that is he
[1:00:45] did everything now in your earthly
[1:00:46] journey. And he gave you a future home,
[1:00:48] an eternal home. He did everything for
[1:00:50] us.
[1:00:53] Hallelujah. And remember, you can't
[1:00:56] sink.
[1:00:59] I can't sink, brother Patrick.
[1:01:03] I can't. Now, I'm not going to boast on
[1:01:06] that because pride goes before a fall.
[1:01:09] I'm going to rejoice in that. Amen. I'm
[1:01:12] going to rejoice that I can't sink, not
[1:01:14] boast in it. The only thing we can boast
[1:01:16] in is the power of the cross.
[1:01:17] Hallelujah. As Paul said, because of the
[1:01:20] cross, we won't sink. Amen. Because of
[1:01:23] the cross, we'll be standing here
[1:01:25] watching and waiting. Because of the
[1:01:27] cross, I'll be watching, waiting. I'll
[1:01:29] be standing. I'll be somewhere. Listen
[1:01:31] for my name.
[1:01:33] When the Savior calls, I'll answer. I'll
[1:01:37] be somewhere. Listen for my name because
[1:01:40] I'm not going to sink. I'm going to
[1:01:41] stand on the rock of ages.
[1:01:49] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:01:54] Now, I'm going to close with this. I got
[1:01:56] two minutes on my hour. I'm going to
[1:01:57] preach a little over an hour. Okay? Not
[1:01:59] going to do an hour and a
[1:02:01] half unless I surprise
[1:02:03] myself. But I just want to close with
[1:02:05] this to encourage you here. Oh, I have
[1:02:07] to say that for Wednesday,
[1:02:11] okay, church, I'm amazed too sometimes
[1:02:13] just how the Bible keeps opening more
[1:02:15] and more. It's an eternal book. Praise
[1:02:17] God.
[1:02:19] But we see how brother Abraham is
[1:02:20] meditating on the word of God. It's a
[1:02:22] burning and he's got to preach till
[1:02:23] midnight in his own bed. Now, doesn't
[1:02:27] that fit how the David said, "I'm going
[1:02:28] to meditate on my bed." Doesn't that fit
[1:02:31] that? Remember, like I said last week
[1:02:33] with the He was laying there and said,
[1:02:34] "Boy, if you're 50 years old, if you
[1:02:38] want to do something for God, you better
[1:02:39] start doing something now." He's
[1:02:40] meditating. And then that's when his
[1:02:42] theophony or that's when his uh Yeah. Uh
[1:02:44] no, that that's when his soul that's
[1:02:46] when his soul was caught up out of his
[1:02:47] body.
[1:02:49] Hallelujah. And his uh his his soul and
[1:02:52] spirit leave the bed. And that's when he
[1:02:54] goes beyond the curtain of time. So God
[1:02:56] would help him so much while he's
[1:02:59] meditating on the things of
[1:03:02] God.
[1:03:04] Now these waves of life, let's remember
[1:03:06] some of these waves of
[1:03:08] life. 2 Corinthians 7:5 and
[1:03:13] six. Now we could go through Paul's
[1:03:15] resume. I got a list of them there. I
[1:03:17] think it's I got my Bible checklist in
[1:03:21] here of my favorite topics
[1:03:23] here. Resume. Yeah, I have a whole list
[1:03:26] of resume of sufferings in 2 Corinthians
[1:03:28] 4, 2 Corinthians 6, and 2 Corinthians
[1:03:30] 11. 2 Corinthians is filled with Paul's
[1:03:32] sufferings. Remember, because he's
[1:03:33] trying to show these fanatical
[1:03:34] Christians, right? These emotional
[1:03:36] Christians with all these gifts and all
[1:03:37] these sins, these I'll say like this,
[1:03:39] these justified Christians. He's trying
[1:03:40] to show all these justified Christians
[1:03:41] that he's a true man of God and that the
[1:03:44] gospel brings suffering as well.
[1:03:47] Not just gifts, although we thank God
[1:03:48] for gifts, but you got to overcome
[1:03:51] suffering as a Christian.
[1:03:53] Now, just let's just remind ourselves.
[1:03:55] Let's look at some of these waves that
[1:03:57] we go through in our lives. And none of
[1:03:59] these will sink you, church.
[1:04:01] They can't sink
[1:04:03] you. Because you're ordained, you're
[1:04:05] ordained to sail. There's my
[1:04:08] hour. For when we were coming to
[1:04:10] Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. See,
[1:04:12] he didn't have rest. This is one of
[1:04:13] those moments where this is a season of
[1:04:15] persecution. This ain't going to be a
[1:04:17] easy season. But we were troubled on
[1:04:20] what side? Every that means trouble at
[1:04:23] the job, trouble in your health, trouble
[1:04:26] in your family, maybe trouble in
[1:04:29] finances, troubles
[1:04:32] everywhere. And yet he was a he was
[1:04:35] anchored in his soul. Hallelujah. He had
[1:04:37] to been. He was filled with the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost right after he got saved.
[1:04:41] He there's trouble everywhere. Brother
[1:04:42] Chris. Yeah, brother
[1:04:44] Chris. St. Paul. St. Paul. Yep. St.
[1:04:48] Paul. Without we're fighting. So he's
[1:04:51] saying now outside of me. He looked like
[1:04:53] everybody's fighting. They're fighting
[1:04:54] the churches. There's fighting amongst
[1:04:56] Roman soldiers. Just fights everywhere.
[1:04:58] So like all the violence in the world
[1:04:59] today, these people protesting, those
[1:05:02] people destroying Tesla cars, these
[1:05:03] people doing this and doing all kinds of
[1:05:06] everywhere. There there's fightings
[1:05:08] everywhere. And then within everyone's
[1:05:11] petrified with fear. Are we going to
[1:05:13] sink? Is my ship going to sink? Am I
[1:05:16] going to be
[1:05:17] lost? Right? So see, we're not
[1:05:19] guaranteed that every season of our life
[1:05:21] is going to be so easy. We have to
[1:05:23] endure all the waves.
[1:05:26] God wants us to experience going. God
[1:05:28] wants us to experience that the anchor
[1:05:30] will hold. And then one of these
[1:05:32] Sundays, you'll come to church and
[1:05:33] you'll sing that and you'll start
[1:05:34] weeping and crying and thanking God your
[1:05:36] anchor held. Thank God I've got an
[1:05:39] anchor. I would have I would have sunk
[1:05:42] on my own. But because the anchor Jesus
[1:05:44] put in my life, I'm still sailing today.
[1:05:46] Hallelujah.
[1:05:48] Glory. The anchor
[1:05:50] holds. See trouble everywhere you look.
[1:05:53] Fighting everywhere you look. And inside
[1:05:55] of me, I'm battling
[1:05:57] fear. Is this storm ever going to pass?
[1:05:59] Oh no, another
[1:06:01] storm. Yeah, another storm.
[1:06:06] Nevertheless, who steps in? God.
[1:06:09] Nevertheless, the
[1:06:11] anchor that comforted those that are
[1:06:14] cast down comfort us by the coming of
[1:06:17] Titus. So, look at this. God sends
[1:06:18] another brother at just the right time
[1:06:21] to bring some comfort to these people
[1:06:23] going through storms of life. And
[1:06:25] doesn't the Bible say in Proverbs, a
[1:06:27] word in due season, how pleasant it is.
[1:06:30] There's some people God will send to you
[1:06:31] at just the right time just when you
[1:06:33] need God in flesh, right? God with flesh
[1:06:36] on and they'll have they'll say exactly
[1:06:38] the thing you need to hear when it it
[1:06:42] seems like all trouble's breaking loose.
[1:06:44] Everything's falling apart outside of
[1:06:47] you and inside of you.
[1:06:50] And God will send somebody with a
[1:06:53] word to bring you back to the comfort
[1:06:56] that you need to have. And the church
[1:06:57] said,
[1:07:02] I'm just going to briefly go over this
[1:07:04] list of some of Brother Ram's failures.
[1:07:07] Brother Ram was uh saved and baptized
[1:07:09] either the end of 1931 or the beginning
[1:07:12] of
[1:07:13] 1932. By the end of 1932, he was
[1:07:16] ordained to preach in the Missionary
[1:07:18] Baptist
[1:07:20] Church. Now, that was about 1932.
[1:07:23] Somewhere right in there, he got the
[1:07:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm not quite
[1:07:26] sure. some there's quotes where he says
[1:07:28] he got it in a shed and then he got it
[1:07:30] another place maybe in a field I can't
[1:07:31] remember exact one but not I can't place
[1:07:34] exactly where he was born again but I
[1:07:37] want you to know
[1:07:38] though fast forward to 1937 and the Ohio
[1:07:42] River flood he's been born again for
[1:07:44] maybe five years what happens he's born
[1:07:47] again church he's got the
[1:07:49] anchor but this storm comes on his life
[1:07:52] and his mother-in-law says you are not
[1:07:54] taking my daughter to these Pentecostal
[1:07:56] with a bunch of trash. And this storm
[1:08:00] came in. Notice the storm comes in
[1:08:01] through a
[1:08:02] mother-in-law. Now, for you, it might be
[1:08:04] a father-in-law or for you it might be
[1:08:06] your
[1:08:07] boss, right? Or your mom or your dad.
[1:08:11] And a storm comes in. And brother's born
[1:08:13] again. He's got the rest in his soul.
[1:08:16] But he gets so worried about offending
[1:08:18] his mother-in-law that he disobys God.
[1:08:21] He disobeyed the angel, the Lord.
[1:08:24] And we know what happened after that.
[1:08:26] The Ohio River, they still got I I was
[1:08:27] in Jeffersonville last year. They still
[1:08:29] got a mark where it was 22 feet high of
[1:08:31] Ohio River flood. It's still marked on
[1:08:32] that building right by uh Ships's candy
[1:08:35] store. It's still marked up
[1:08:38] there. He's five years got to
[1:08:41] anchor and this storm comes in where
[1:08:44] because he disobeyed his mother-in-law,
[1:08:45] the the natural flood comes in. Talk
[1:08:47] about a natural and spiritual. The enemy
[1:08:49] comes in like a flood. His wife dies of
[1:08:53] tuberculosis. Then Sharon Rose
[1:08:55] dies. Hallelujah. And then brother said
[1:08:58] it's like God just said, "Shut up. I
[1:09:00] don't want to hear from you
[1:09:01] anymore." And remember the devil talked
[1:09:03] to him. I went through this a few weeks
[1:09:04] ago. The devil said everything. He's
[1:09:06] like, "Amen. That's right. That's right.
[1:09:07] That's right. That's right." But he said
[1:09:08] all of a sudden everything broke away.
[1:09:09] All these trials in my mind broke away
[1:09:11] and the anchor held for him. Praise God.
[1:09:14] The devil's trying to say quit. God
[1:09:16] don't care for
[1:09:17] you. He's like, "Well, you couldn't tell
[1:09:19] me there wasn't a God. I knew there was
[1:09:21] a God, but I thought maybe he didn't
[1:09:23] care for me. But when he went to check
[1:09:26] over the side of the ship, all as the
[1:09:27] water's falling all over and
[1:09:29] everything's falling apart in his life,
[1:09:31] the anchor was there and the anchor, he
[1:09:33] tried to tug on the anchor was there and
[1:09:35] it says, "The Lord gives and the Lord
[1:09:37] takes away. Blessed be the name of the
[1:09:38] Lord." The anchor said that. Praise God.
[1:09:45] And then church even after
[1:09:46] that the waves came so hard he tried to
[1:09:49] commit
[1:09:51] suicide right on two occasions he tried
[1:09:54] to commit suicide. Look it up twice he
[1:09:56] tried he tried to grab the electrical
[1:09:57] lines and then he had the gun loaded
[1:09:59] too. A Holy Ghost fililled person. And
[1:10:02] the church
[1:10:03] said he's filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:05] But sometime these waves are more than
[1:10:07] we can handle. They feel like they're
[1:10:10] more than we can handle. Why does God do
[1:10:13] that? Because he's testing your anchor.
[1:10:16] He's letting you see, sorry, he's
[1:10:18] letting you see the power of an
[1:10:21] anchor. And that's to try your faith to
[1:10:24] make your faith more genuine, to make
[1:10:26] your faith more
[1:10:28] strong. In each case, those two cases,
[1:10:31] he tried to commit suicide, God
[1:10:33] protected him. God put him to sleep. Or
[1:10:34] God wouldn't let the gun go off, right?
[1:10:37] The one time and then he woke up. He was
[1:10:38] up on the ladder. Think about that. up
[1:10:39] on the ladder and you wake up and you're
[1:10:41] on the ground. How did I get down from
[1:10:42] the ladder? It happened to me when I
[1:10:44] passed out. I was walking to the
[1:10:45] bathroom a couple years ago after after
[1:10:47] I tore my hamstring there. I was walking
[1:10:49] in the bathroom. I don't even remember.
[1:10:50] I just woke up like this on the floor. I
[1:10:53] That's a pretty good fall by God's
[1:10:54] grace. I think the angels I think the
[1:10:56] angels caught me and just laid me down.
[1:10:58] I felt like I was my head didn't hurt. I
[1:11:01] don't know what happened. I tell you,
[1:11:03] God is rich in mercy. Now, my grandpa's
[1:11:06] testimony, great grandpa Garza, they
[1:11:08] were driving down 77 in on the mountains
[1:11:10] there. And my grandpa's testimony before
[1:11:12] he died, I got it on tape, too. He said
[1:11:15] they were driving and
[1:11:17] a 18-wheeler tractor trailer went over
[1:11:20] the line and was flying right into them.
[1:11:23] And my grandpa said he threw his hands
[1:11:24] up. He said,
[1:11:26] "Jesus, on on those, you you ever drove
[1:11:29] a 77, all the mountains there, the curvy
[1:11:31] mountains?" He said, "Jesus." And then
[1:11:33] he said everything went black. He woke
[1:11:35] up and he and his he and my mother, my
[1:11:37] my grandma Julia, Romero and Julia are
[1:11:39] on the side of the road. He said he's
[1:11:40] got his hands on the uh on the driver's
[1:11:43] wheel. He wakes up and they're perfectly
[1:11:45] parked on the side of the road. Nothing,
[1:11:47] no damage done, not even know how they
[1:11:49] got
[1:11:51] there. That's that that's the anchor
[1:11:53] holding. Hallelujah. Now, God could have
[1:11:55] let him get an accident like Brother
[1:11:56] Brandham, right? But it's just to show
[1:11:58] you if you can't take care of yourself,
[1:12:00] the anchor will take care of you.
[1:12:02] Hallelujah. Amen. The anchor will hold.
[1:12:04] Praise
[1:12:06] God. I just want you to see, church,
[1:12:08] people that are baptized with the Holy
[1:12:10] Ghost, they go through some very
[1:12:11] difficult
[1:12:15] times. Remember, Brother lied to the
[1:12:18] IRS. He lied. He li he tell his wife, he
[1:12:21] said, "Uh, tell him I'm not here." But
[1:12:24] what did the anchor do? The anchor said,
[1:12:25] "You better go make that right. Don't
[1:12:27] lay your lying hands on these babies."
[1:12:29] She had to go back and tell them. And
[1:12:31] now then the IRS guy said, "You actually
[1:12:33] me look more like a Christian to us than
[1:12:36] before because we've seen you repent of
[1:12:38] your
[1:12:39] mistakes." Praise God. Holy Ghost people
[1:12:42] can be tempted to commit suicide and lie
[1:12:45] to the hol and lie to people. Yeah. Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost
[1:12:49] people. Holy Ghost people can can cater
[1:12:52] to their mother-in-law rather than
[1:12:54] Christ. Yeah. Sometimes they do that.
[1:12:58] And remember the other other quote uh
[1:13:00] from
[1:13:01] 1960, brother Ram said he had a sinus
[1:13:03] infection for nine days straight with a
[1:13:05] temperature of like
[1:13:07] 103. And that's when his wife rebuked
[1:13:09] him a little bit. She said, "Stay
[1:13:10] silent, Bill. God knows what he's
[1:13:12] doing." He's like, "Maybe God never
[1:13:14] called me to
[1:13:16] preach." And the Lord Jesus came to him
[1:13:18] at the end of it and said, "You've
[1:13:20] catered too much to
[1:13:22] denomination." So brother man was
[1:13:24] catering to his mother-in-law,
[1:13:25] disobeying God. He was catering to
[1:13:27] denominations and brother told us what
[1:13:30] that
[1:13:31] was. He was doing the discernment too
[1:13:33] much and it was wearing him out and he
[1:13:35] left all he said I left thousands of
[1:13:37] people laying sick and I never got to
[1:13:38] pray for him. He said I put too much
[1:13:40] emphasis on the gift instead of the
[1:13:44] commission.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah. Can a Holy Ghost fil person
[1:13:48] get their ministry kind of off a little
[1:13:50] bit? I know everybody's looking at me,
[1:13:51] but that's true because you got the
[1:13:53] public ministry. Well, you got a
[1:13:54] ministry, too.
[1:13:57] The thing is, we just want God to
[1:13:59] correct us when we're wrong and start
[1:14:01] all over again. Let's make it right. Let
[1:14:03] me walk in the right path. But a Holy
[1:14:06] Ghost fil person can do that. Yes. But
[1:14:08] what's there to hold you when you go
[1:14:09] through trials? The anchor is there to
[1:14:11] hold you. Praise
[1:14:13] God. Hallelujah. And the last one is
[1:14:17] 1963. Standing in the gap. Brother Ram's
[1:14:20] just tired. He's like, I preached the
[1:14:22] seven seals and I I keep going back and
[1:14:24] forth all these churches. I keep
[1:14:26] preaching against hair and makeup and
[1:14:27] and and men and they keep committing
[1:14:29] adultery. They keep getting drunk and
[1:14:31] the women keep cutting their hair. He
[1:14:32] said, "If that's the case, then they
[1:14:34] don't have to hear me preach." He said,
[1:14:36] "I'll go move up into the mountains of
[1:14:37] Colorado." So far from civilization, he
[1:14:40] said, "I'll be the real mountain man I
[1:14:42] always wanted to be, a real mountain
[1:14:44] man, a real
[1:14:47] hunter." And he made all these plans to
[1:14:50] do it. And the Holy Ghost said, "If you
[1:14:52] do that, your wife's going to leave
[1:14:53] you." He said, "I lost the feeling for
[1:14:56] the
[1:14:58] people." Brother Jess, a Holy Ghost fil
[1:15:01] person can lose feelings for the church
[1:15:02] members. Yeah, they can. He said it was
[1:15:05] a
[1:15:06] complex. They don't have to hear me.
[1:15:09] Hey, I I don't have to fellowship with
[1:15:10] them. I don't have to talk to them. I
[1:15:12] don't have to be around them. I don't
[1:15:13] have to text them back, right? I don't
[1:15:15] have to email them back, right? Just
[1:15:18] just, you know, think I don't have to do
[1:15:20] this. Cam and I were talking about that
[1:15:22] yesterday. Yeah.
[1:15:23] I don't have to go to church. I don't
[1:15:25] have to do any. I don't have to do I
[1:15:26] don't have to praise God. I don't have
[1:15:27] to do any of this. And we just sometimes
[1:15:29] we get bad attitudes
[1:15:32] because of the storms of life. Thank God
[1:15:35] there's an anchor there.
[1:15:37] Glory.
[1:15:39] Hallelujah. I'm going to quit. They
[1:15:41] don't have to hear me. I'm going to give
[1:15:43] up. I I have to deal with all this all
[1:15:45] this discouragement. Why do I always got
[1:15:47] to be discouraged? Why can't I just go
[1:15:49] and enjoy life? Because you're being
[1:15:51] tested and tried.
[1:15:56] And then brother man repent and say Lord
[1:15:57] forgive me I lost the feeling of the
[1:15:59] people and he says you pray for me I'll
[1:16:01] get my feeling back for the people and
[1:16:04] instead of being upset with them I'll
[1:16:06] love
[1:16:06] them just like Moses lost a feeling. He
[1:16:09] said he he said you bunch of rebels and
[1:16:11] he smoked the rock you bunch of that I
[1:16:14] got to be careful sometimes I say that
[1:16:15] bunch of heathens and bunch of I got to
[1:16:17] be careful with that too. Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] Now there are a bunch of serpent seed
[1:16:22] out there and the church said like it's
[1:16:24] almost 99% serpent seat out there maybe
[1:16:29] 99.9 but it's it's it's about not uh
[1:16:33] it's about not getting discouraged about
[1:16:34] all the waves of life and it's about
[1:16:38] resting in what what did Jesus Christ do
[1:16:40] for me? I'll say like this. What did
[1:16:41] Jesus Christ do for the people I'm
[1:16:43] struggling with?
[1:16:46] What did Christ do for
[1:16:49] them? And then the anchor will remind
[1:16:51] you, oh, I'm going to hold you in your
[1:16:52] storm. My anchor is going to hold them
[1:16:54] in their storms, too. Hallelujah. Holy
[1:16:58] Ghost fililled people go through
[1:16:59] difficult trials of life. Fights
[1:17:02] without, fears within, fears without.
[1:17:05] And the church said,
[1:17:08] hallelujah. But the spirit of burning
[1:17:11] brought the victory to brother Brandham
[1:17:13] in every trial. How many know that's the
[1:17:15] truth? Praise God. Let me close with
[1:17:17] this. By God's grace,
[1:17:23] Hallelujah. This is what we see,
[1:17:26] church. Jesus said the Holy Ghost would
[1:17:29] give you rest to your soul. It would
[1:17:31] give you an anchor to your soul. The
[1:17:33] soul is the nature of your human
[1:17:37] spirit. So other words, the the the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost, the fire of God, the anchor in
[1:17:41] your soul will always try to get your
[1:17:42] mind to correct itself and think the
[1:17:44] right thoughts. Hallelujah. That means
[1:17:47] this fire is always going to try to burn
[1:17:49] out all the bad stuff in here and keep
[1:17:51] the fire up here. And like I said, then
[1:17:54] when you need it, that fire will go out
[1:17:56] into your flesh and give you
[1:17:59] rest. That's what we need.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost gives rest to
[1:18:05] your soul. I love this. The Holy Ghost
[1:18:09] rests on you and then gives you the
[1:18:12] rest. Praise
[1:18:15] God. This is the spiritual blessing that
[1:18:18] the Lord gives us. Let me close with
[1:18:21] this. Isaiah 64. Last verse. We're in
[1:18:24] Isaiah 61. Now we're going to Isaiah
[1:18:29] 64. Now this is future I believe
[1:18:33] speaking of the 144,000. Look at verse
[1:18:36] one. Oh that thou wouldest ren the
[1:18:38] heavens and thou wouldest come down and
[1:18:40] the mountains might flow at thy
[1:18:42] presence. So what is Isaiah saying? Oh,
[1:18:44] that God would come down and the prince
[1:18:46] of God would melt the mountains. What's
[1:18:49] he looking for? He's looking for the
[1:18:50] battle of
[1:18:51] Armageddon, right? When the mountains
[1:18:53] are brought low and the islands are
[1:18:55] covered with
[1:18:58] water. Verse two, when the melting fire
[1:19:02] burneth, ever say burning. Ready? Burn.
[1:19:05] Spirit of burning. Wherever God's
[1:19:06] present presence is in your life, it's
[1:19:08] going to be burning something in your
[1:19:10] life.
[1:19:13] The fire caused the waters to boil to
[1:19:16] make thy name known to thine adversary.
[1:19:18] See, when the fire of God's burning on
[1:19:19] you, you'll testify about Jesus to
[1:19:21] people, even your
[1:19:24] enemies.
[1:19:27] Glory that the nations may tremble at
[1:19:30] thy presence. See, his presence is
[1:19:31] always a burning
[1:19:33] presence. Verse three, when thou did
[1:19:36] terrible things which we looked not for,
[1:19:38] thou camest down. The mountains flowed
[1:19:40] down at thy presence. For since the
[1:19:43] beginning of the world, men have not
[1:19:44] heard, nor perceived by the ear. Doesn't
[1:19:46] that remind you of Romans? Neither hath
[1:19:48] I seen, oh God, beside thee, what he
[1:19:51] hath prepared for them that waiteth for
[1:19:55] him. Thou meetest him that rejoices and
[1:19:58] workketh righteousness. Those that
[1:20:00] remember thee in thy ways, behold, thou
[1:20:02] art wroth, for we have sinned. In those
[1:20:04] in continuence, and we shall be saved.
[1:20:08] So, what do we get out of this? Wait on
[1:20:10] God. And church, really, if you're
[1:20:13] honest, you're a ship out in the sea.
[1:20:15] That's all you can do is
[1:20:16] wait. What else can you do, church? When
[1:20:20] you got the storms, and you can't
[1:20:21] control the storms. And the church said,
[1:20:24] "You can't control when you got a
[1:20:25] problem here, problem there, problem
[1:20:26] with that person, problem here, problem,
[1:20:28] you can't control the storms. So, what
[1:20:30] can you do other than turn your hope and
[1:20:32] wait on the Lord Jesus
[1:20:34] Christ? Wait for his coming. wait for
[1:20:37] him to come vindicate. You were
[1:20:39] righteous. You did what was
[1:20:41] right. You honored God. And then God's
[1:20:44] presence is going to come and honor
[1:20:48] you. Thank you,
[1:20:50] saints. Verse six, but we are all as
[1:20:52] unclean thing. We just got little ships,
[1:20:55] right? We got any nice yachts out there?
[1:20:58] Probably not. I don't see any yachts out
[1:21:01] there. We're just all humble little
[1:21:04] ships. and all our righteousness are as
[1:21:07] filthy rags. We're just dirty ships,
[1:21:09] right? We're just dirty
[1:21:11] boats. And we all do fade as a leaf, and
[1:21:14] our iniquities like the wind, and have
[1:21:16] taken us
[1:21:18] away. And there's none that calleth upon
[1:21:20] thy name, that stirth up himself to take
[1:21:22] hold of thee. For thou hast hid thy face
[1:21:24] from us, and has consumed us because of
[1:21:26] our iniquities. But now, oh Lord, thou
[1:21:28] art our father, we are the clay, thou
[1:21:30] art the potter, and we are all the work
[1:21:33] of thy hand. and let's stand to our feet
[1:21:34] by God's grace. Musicians can come as we
[1:21:37] prepare for communion. We also want to
[1:21:38] have a time if there's anyone that needs
[1:21:40] prayer today. We like to offer prayer
[1:21:42] for you. How many enjoy the word today?
[1:21:43] Praise God. I so enjoy it. I got a
[1:21:45] couple more sermons then on the day of
[1:21:46] Pentecost because I didn't get to all my
[1:21:48] notes here. So I thank the Lord for his
[1:21:50] grace and his mercy. Hallelujah. Aren't
[1:21:53] you glad that you can't sink because
[1:21:55] Christ has anchored your ship. Praise
[1:21:57] God. Think of that. The Holy Ghost fil
[1:21:59] believers could go through such trials
[1:22:02] and yet the anchor held each and every
[1:22:04] time. Why don't you play that? The
[1:22:06] anchor
[1:22:08] holds.
[1:22:11] Hallelujah. Been very patient. That was
[1:22:13] an hour. That was an hour and 20
[1:22:14] minutes. So forgive me. I try not to do
[1:22:16] an hour and a half. Forgive I lost lost
[1:22:18] track track of time there. Let's pray.
[1:22:20] Father God, we thank you for today, Lord
[1:22:22] God. We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you,
[1:22:23] God, that the anchor holds in our lives
[1:22:25] today, Lord God. Father, help us to all
[1:22:28] enter into that rest, Lord God. It
[1:22:31] burned in your prophet's heart, Lord
[1:22:33] God. And he preached it to his wife till
[1:22:35] midnight, Lord God. And by grace, he
[1:22:38] listened. Oh God, help us today to
[1:22:40] listen by grace. Help us to apply what
[1:22:42] we've heard today,
[1:22:44] Lord. That this week we'll think about,
[1:22:47] oh, this is just a storm. This is just a
[1:22:50] wave. I can rest in the
[1:22:56] anchor. Lord, thank you for giving us an
[1:22:59] anchor. Lord, let's what we should be
[1:23:00] most thankful for is the finished work
[1:23:02] of Jesus Christ on
[1:23:07] Calvary. Lord, every church could ask,
[1:23:09] why are the Akran saints so tossed
[1:23:11] about? Why are the Napoleon saints or
[1:23:13] the Lima saints or the Alvian saints or
[1:23:16] the De Moine saints? Why are sometimes
[1:23:18] we so tossed about? Because we got to go
[1:23:20] back to the
[1:23:21] anchor. Hallelujah. We got to live in
[1:23:24] the holiest of holies, Lord
[1:23:27] God. Hallelujah. Jesus, grant it, Lord
[1:23:33] God. Oh God, help us to be in one accord
[1:23:35] just now, Lord God. I know I preached
[1:23:37] longer than I wanted to,
[1:23:39] Lord. But Father, thou art in all the
[1:23:41] details, Lord God.
[1:23:46] Lord Jesus, I pray you meet the needs of
[1:23:47] your people here today for the glory of
[1:23:49] God. Father, may each person reach out
[1:23:52] to you. Lord
[1:23:54] God, I trust each person was ready to
[1:23:57] listen today and then apply this to
[1:23:59] their lives. Lord, I pray you'd bless
[1:24:01] them, Father
[1:24:02] God. Have your way, Lord Jesus, to meet
[1:24:05] the needs of thy people, Lord. For some,
[1:24:08] they might need prayer. others. Help
[1:24:10] them just to praise you because they got
[1:24:11] an
[1:24:13] anchor that will hold them in the storms
[1:24:15] of
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:19] life. Maybe we've catered too much
[1:24:24] to Lord temptations in our lives, Lord
[1:24:30] God. Maybe we've catered to what people
[1:24:32] think about us or what people are going
[1:24:34] to see on the internet. Lord, may we
[1:24:37] only give our focus and our dedication
[1:24:40] to you, Lord
[1:24:43] God. Help us not to care what other
[1:24:46] people think. Help us to only cater to
[1:24:48] you, to serve you, Lord
[1:24:51] Jesus, to do what you want to do in our
[1:24:53] lives. I pray you'd grant it, Lord God,
[1:24:56] in Jesus Christ's name.
