when I wouldn't want to enter into that Phil filthy lucre yeah people sell off for every day to marry finer goodness I shook his hand I was so proud I'm so thankful of God I met a man like that yeah hey guy said churches of pills guys going to be in the hill there's three load layers in hell three levels what's the lowest one in Clichy astok oh yeah that's not for them that's not for the Hitler's okay all right that's not for just a run aground around prostitute or the drunker Oh ever but the ecclesiastical the worst of the lowest hell is for preachers be Jews hey this is the best night right right I goodness Big John Abruzzi yes according to united states such as bureau the number of Americans with no religion more than doubled between 1990 and 2008 a study conducted by the barna group discovered that nearly sixty percent of all christians from 30 years from 15 years of age to 29 are no longer active actively involved in a church Christians are not even involved in church system to 16 to 29 Wow still claim I bet my view is my house over this or that well understand where'd you go church right all I know yeah same man yeah right not mercy one survey conducted Oh a while back found fifty-two percent of all american christians believe that at least some non-christian face can each reach her life when Jesus Christ says he said I am the way the truth and the life there is no but a lot of Christians what will say well just maybe this Buddhist that is not or whatever or whatever they can all enter a tak'n but we're all around a mountain royal climbing up trying to get that same point and it's not how it works wow it's a narrow path email everyone hat that plenty pass one pass the great is what a highway that suit then if you get on that but the bottles of the street and narrow path absolutely short will go stomach number one here number 100 according to lifeway research which I believe the Christian thing or something forty-six percent of all Americans never even think about whether they go to heaven or not after people could care less and that's the absolute truth yeah anyone has ever talked to just just talk to people when you're out about just strike a conversation with someone and you just hit a little bit about Jesus Christ Islamic and you see what they say no one cares about this don't even cares about Jesus Christ are many more it's embarrassing second 7312 he says yay and all that live godly in Jesus Christ shall suffer persecution he says he says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse he says and where she's a deceiving and being a seat yeah absolutely this is the type this is the age the greatest deception is not absolute trust her second the saloons to Greece's let no man deceive you by any means that for that day shall not come except there be a lot of falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so before the Antichrist steps up the son of man is that a man ups and the son of perdition one that we are falling away then he'll appear chalk that's right I know simple short now in the ad Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 15 God makes a little covenant with Abraham okay and let me read this year he's in verse 8 Genesis 15 verse 8 he says and the Lord God where I shall I know that I shuffle inherited he said to him take me a hacker of three years old and a she-goat of three years old and around three years old that rolled up in a young pigeon and he took all the all these under him and divided them in the midst of ladies piece one against another but the birds dividing to eat not okay he says he says the bowels came down upon the carcasses and Abraham had to drive 80 keys and drove away after dollars cheaper keeping your sacrifice clean absolutely keeping your mind and clean all these things like this since out of the air who he's dead carcass will carry on right yeah maybe also this a rotting flesh what everybody vultures but evil unclean birds sure he says and when the Sun was going down look he says and a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a hold of great darkness fell upon God what allowed him to what never this is all shadows and type short estimates by Sheldon type this is what Abraham getting a change of death the rim said he said these are these and he says and this in this portion scripts recent piece of Abraham ending calories that he's covered death encountered hell foreshadowing exactly what we have to go through would he be saying short because what God may encompass but what he had to taste both need to go to a boat right he says nah boo Genesis 15 17 and it came to pass when the Sun went down and it was dark he hold off smoking and furniture makes a decent that was hell he says in a burning lamp passed between those pieces what the pillar fire shown to what he that God Himself was going to make this come at work and he Abraham was going to pass through it only God himself right the pillar of I sure man he said but look he said he had to taste death and he had to go to help but God would keep his covenant with him sure now we all know we know these things being in the message for so long but in hell there was two places in hell correct we know what Samuel would summon saw and Paxton so bad to God the Bible's of the ureter won't even speech from right there God he wasn't talked to Saul or nothing like and one time they're the battles of upright the end of Saul's life force but saw he's inviting a which totally banned from Israel kilvo whatever but since it's all said he's not kidding fighting then they bother him one what in the witch of endor sure and they went towards she was doing a little spells whatever and she said who do you want me to call off she said he said caught up Sam right the Prophet she called him up and then she called that spirit up everything in her she was opened her eyes were open realize that was saw real that was Samuel all these things right so we know that what at that time there was what hell and there was what we call paradise and we learn more through Christ's ministry that whatever the rich man and Lazarus right the Richmond of a blessed and everything he did an average here like to eating it toned off potato right and the Bible says that Lazarus went to Paradise which would Abraham right and then what the rich man found his hot looked up from hell look his eyes up from hell sure and then now they're converging Abraham and is this rich man and the Bible says that weather was the the Abraham said there was a gulf fixed between both of them they could never go right one was a holding place the other one was Hell itself a place of torture torment not necessarily flames was just format right okay so we know these we know these things there was two places okay that's why Jesus on the cross was the thief on the rise said he said remember me when you're in paradise he's in the Jesus that you'll be with me in paradise today but they talking about heaven no that was talking about paradise down there the place that what because remember in the Old Testament we had what blood of bulls and goats Frank she those things right and the Bible says that that blood we know from the blood would cover their scent they take that blood on the altar and symbolically that covered their sin so what judgment could not they cannot go to help but standing at the end of their life say if you could take his hands like this and the altar strut it out and look there's still Sydney he's mine he fell by x minus you I own him that's my that's why when Moses died Satan was there to dispute about the body of Moses because when he can take that blood that great pop-up said look he's still sin he's still mine I still old I still own that sure and then what Satan changing would take east of all but because there was a blood on that you could not take it to hell he had to put it in put it right there why did he lapped it up sure now let's go to this year in Ephesians 4 9 he says and now that he ascended what is it but that he has descended also our first into the lower parts of the earth what member Christ died he went to the lower parts here and then look he said that he descended the same as he also that us and Farah bro actually was hurt I'm sorry fusions 48 I'm sorry wherefore he's Satan nepali he says when he has set it up on high he led captivity captive all right we know these things through this review hey he's like captivity captive God without jeans price went down he was saying right he goes to the prison house door he takes but what he had to do first he had to go and need st. in right and prove that he was the son of God manifesting his blaze that my blood is still fresh on the cloth cross fell down onto the onto the earth the earth drank it up right and now the earth is was sanctified sure but then he had to go to Satan and take the keys of death Ellen a great chori doctor to Isaiah 14 will show you that he had the keys because here is God speaking through a prophet here as am 14 verse 12 he says how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how is our cuts down to the ground would weaken the nation's for now I said and I ha reason I will ascend to heaven I was off my throne above the stars of God I was sit upon the mount the congregation in the sides of the door he said I was sent above the heights of the clouds he's now be like the Most High God here God is destroying what Satan heart he says yea thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit he says he says they needn't look upon me nearly shall look upon D consider these say is this the banda ain't your trouble that has shaken the date the kingdom he says they have made the world of wilderness and destroyed the sinir cities thereof that over did not the house of the prisoners look Satan could have released him and they could've went to heaven sure but he took claims on him because they were four cents to their sin was still there he had the king sure and God judges them for you could have released a linkage has been with me for sure is a reason but you won't ever release them you had the key that that's why Jesus cries and to come down and get the keys released right surely it is that simple yeah absolutely now it's Psalms in solves 9 verse 17 he says the wicked shall be burned into hell and all nations that forget god therefore how has a larger self Isaiah 514 hell has enlarged yourself and open her mouth without measure and their glory and their must earn their party he joins two shall descend into it so here is what everything is brought revolving around hell here it's like it's like I'll say like this but let me blow your back up here now the Prophet had two visions the crop and two visions one when he was a young boy 14 years old especially since 14 and the other one was filled in 54 he said exactly 40 years apart 40 years is what temptation a year of temptation so he had got shot by one of the strengths of hunting and go to his leg off and now he was or having parts of his legs off there and he was laying there he said he would be he go hand out of consciousness that day he said he woke up one night and just felt like there's water all over he looked out he said there had to be a half gallon of blood laying right honor you today like a rubber rubber sheet and he's laying in that and discovered in his own blood and he rang the thing the nurse came over and stopped it up and whatever and he said he said the next morning there into a surgery and they put him under ether and he was under there for like a hour they didn't know he was gonna come out of I gained so much as he was coming out or some around there he says he said he said he went into a vision he said he was falling he said continually falling he said he went from the clouds he said falling from cut through cloud and then he went into darkness and then he's like he said he said it was like I was never going to hit bottom he's just continually fail he said he says and the feeling though Audie said was unbelievable if you ever get on YouTube watch 23 minutes in hell the guy said God took him down to the hell he allowed her to die or whatever they say he took him down to hell he said I was insane with the money after 23 minutes of hell and he gives it a count of everything down there he is total and sandy tortured wicked stuff he said when he came to his wife was shaking him and he said he just screamed for hours because he was still insane it took it he said it took him two years to recover from that Korean actually function normal 23 minutes down here the problem is finding himself now falling he says he funny of the place he says the regions of the law he says the regions of the Damned and now he's and now he's he's like he said he said he said as he was falling he said he said he cried out for daddy daddy where a says this is the new room daddy there he said his crying out for mommy says by the way and he said he said there's no mama de that even he cried out for God's that there's no God there he finds himself lost and then he said these women come up he says green all under their eyes oh ok Creed he said just could hardly move just he said it was horrible he said he said he said if you do anything he says make sure you never know that yeah he said there's just even one in Sedona he said you want to wish it for anything wishing for anybody nothing he says keep it trying with every song again so now 40 years later 19 or he was 54 years old right now he says and now he's walking with his wife in 1963 he says so I went upstairs and sat down he says and there was a little escalator he says there was a JC penn's store he said he says the Alaska later was bringing people he says office is down well I surely he says this is why I was right because he was looking at these women walking around he said the shorts young and all just the plain he said there feels you building flashing all these things he said he was starting to mess him up miss really start to affect him right because he's seen all the wickedness he says it I trying to look at while I was coming up the steps oh he's in Spanish speaking to another woman she was a white woman speaking to the Spanish woman and when I looked she said all at once I changed remember you'd visit there before and now he's visiting there yet but it was what he says he was in the mall he was in JC Penney's he says there I seen that before he said he changes any seen this before now it's coming back from what he was seeing he says her eyes you know how the woman are doing now painted her eyes just free so he says like a cat he said you know putting up like this and wearing a cat glasses everything he said you know he says with her eyes up like this she said that green stuff under their eyes he says there was that thing that I seen when I was a child he said there was a woman just exactly he says and I just got he said I got no more wars began to look around he said there was just people he says moaning you don't going about their price to think of it that's what it sounded like some good just a weariness around the people he says he says he's in see about 40 years ago his pennies I'm 54 I was 14 so about 40 years ago that's the number of judgment he says now so then I noticed he says I noticed them kanger looking eyes on the women he says there was a Spanish the French and the Indians the widened all together he says but that great hands he said put that with that great big has called potterhead here cuz he's a goof live like that that's from hempstead he says he says you know bust up and with that call me the way they come back his weight babies and then comes now he says you know how they and they do he said fixed up like that he says and then k you're looking eyes and the eyes with the paint they run back like cats eyes and then talking there it was again standing in JC Penney's store he says back in hell so if you see what you see was taking place here the Spirit of God we have the earth right the Spirit of God is not lifting the Spirit of God is in the light oh and as the light goes it gives wait for darkness just as fast is it go all right where does darkness in Hell Satan right the power and now we see how rising it's a mainly it's a visit as it's literally happy you want to go to some crazy pictures in the nineteen fifties and forties it's a guy with bangs like here where instead with the regals devil possessed just beat those guys no collars on the truth so those are Devils that's what is this this age everywhere you go they got their tattoo they got these big holes there here's now they got holes in their cheeks we can see their teeth and then talking and their tongue and they're eating they do that now what we go to the guest book world records now people have in class with horns literally was disfiguring there's they're stalled and they're in their skin their tattooing there I very eyeballs one guy i'm doing the side cut for he study we wanted to date this lady and he said he'd be matter he's like oh she's real tractive and she said that she had this lipstick on and get it later but his friend it was his friend said he's again when she wakes up she had that on me he was best guy to tattoo looks that listed so she lands ever applied again i miss modular things of God hell is now raising what we're seeing on the effects of this supernatural spirit Satan now raising and mingling and is it's transferring to the people at an alarming rate remember what the the sixth of the sixth trumpet or whatever man said he said he said the leg of your of your phrase what 200,000 of the worst demon that were invited for 2,000 years you said release where are they going they're going to the people they said they said they set up shop in Hollywood this thing is corrupted absolutely so there the Prophet find himself in hell again right in a jcpenney school seeing exactly the same thing Matt down there up here let me show you two here he want to read this for you as he have 14 first night he says he'll from beneath is moved for the to mediate that coming he said is stirred up the dead one sir though the definitely even all the chief ones of the earth it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nation's but the Bible says at the coming of Satan Satan is coming to what the incarnate what the fall and he's incarnation hell will be upon here absolutely this Richard Wright and his coming hell would have so much influence was given a loud giving so much power that it mingled the sub and that's why you're seeing what you're saying absolutely but a powerful thing like this let's go to not to bring you down or anything not much right to review them let's go to x2 x2 just sobering Saints we're getting from Forgetting so so close you have to be ready I x222 and here's Peter racing the first holy ghost filled sermon right by mortal man here born in sin he says yay madam is no hear these words Jesus Christ of Nazareth a man approved a God among you by miracles and wonders and signs he was guided by them in the midst of you as he yourself also know him being delivered by determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God he have taken my wicked hands up crucified and slain he says whom God has raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holdem he held him absolutely for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my face and he is always on my right hand and I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue with flan Walker also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou shalt not be my soul in hell he said neither without suffering Holy One to see corruption sings now why why couldn't Jesus Christ stay in hell because the word before then what God said through the Prophet David he said I'll not leave my only one but what in hell I'll not suffer him to have crushed sure right osage of God if we have been truly oneness with Christ if you've been received the Holy Ghost been sealed Holy Ghost you are one with crop is it a revelation that says he that his filthy is Finley still he that his unjust unjust oh he that is just the just overheated is holy is unholy still absolutely what is another reason for the rapture is because of this scripture him hell is rising up if we see the wickedness of the world and if there's someone has got the Holy Oh chica God without either saw him hey and what I see is saw what the to be corruption after the byway other what first first Corinthians 15 diseases he said that corrosion must put on incorruption ask him free man that's practice and so that's why the rapture has to take place because what was it in John 17 Christ said he said he prayed to the Father so that we would be one like they are walk I took there was to be one with us right now complete oneness a few my what holy one without suffer half a man he will not leave his holy one in the head surely not anything that we're tasting and we're singing we're getting awfully close right there hell is fully not here yet because what is that the coming up seat and about what the prophecies is when syncing fall will be going up thing later my back sure absolutely what we going up absolutely that would he gets here now all hell will break loose but now we're seeing everything we're seeing this the demons bringing up and setting trenches up there getting there they're getting the earth set for them soon and this world is soon to receive a fiery baptism after that sure what is a perfect time absolutely will they go to hell first on earth and then their God what whites call the fire absolutely just like going to hell the lake of fire next the second death right sure everything's appropriate time absolutely but one thing i like about christ he is so merciful show yeah i remember that fire he burns the earth with fire everyone he burnt sonic more with fire he said those were examples right and it shows watch it's not an eternal hell absolutely just burner for a season and I'm of I God's grace I got mercy this is what they were here just extinguished I just I just love bugs there because I even went to denominations how could God allow someone to burn for all eternity continuing how could he do it he can he's too gracious he's too wonderful to Margaret essentially is so much mercy absolutely even on the lost that's good sure hey man ah i want to i want to show you something here only what time all right now let's go to you up let's see i want to show you this is something Lord show me I believe you showed this to me on a show you to how how powerful I was like how long we are yeah okay go to Matthew 27 will read all these scriptures i will show you something Lord showed through guy to open talk to me a while back aunty 27 first 45 this is the crucifixion of Christ this is the this is Christ on the cross correct right verse 45 he is now now from the sixth hour there there was darkness all over the land into the night doc so here we see Christ now on a cross right is and darkness had filled the skies absolute darkness clouds everything that could cover the sunlight was there and it's a darkness for three all right i want to show you a quote here too but i'ma show you scripture off so the show would show you what's going on he says here is a hearing he says and then uh vs 45 you is it now the six hour there was darkness over old man 29 town about the ninth hour Jesus cried I looks a little bit the dark is said in and then we see what Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why has thou forsaken correct now what was that entitle that was type of what that was a type of of Abel's lamb able but bringing the lamb up and hanging his throat lever and the Bible said we know through the prophecies that have read it lamb language is spoken an unknown language and hear what does the real Lamb of God was speaking in unknown language absolutely what the mayor got we know these things sure but now look look at this so he read this Jesus Christ cries speaks and comms some of them are stood there when they heard that they said this man calls for lives right now verse 51 if you hold the Veil the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake in the rocks rent so we see clouds we see Christ cry let me see her right right now in the scripture there's a lot of time where Jesus Christ repeating himself barely imperative in Galatians Paul said he said if you speak any of these think um the speaks in a contrary lesson it'll be a curse he said I stayed again now in computer like computer geniuses like maybe some of yours are there's a yen at Mount straight and that little mouth is a little the two buttons there and it's got that little pointer thing on the screen you move it and it followed right and you and you you want to do on it they call copy and paste right move that they can click it drag it boom then hit your left thing you're right thing and boom and then pop it right now then you find a place for you impatient right when we're in face right there right that's what Christ is doing here a lot of times fairly rarely he comes it oh hey Scott where's where's a pretty good copy and paste Isaiah 41 me before I had low God has anointed me to preach to the cap is the set thing right you put it here in the Old Testament Isaiah 41 and then he copy and paste it and looking for mmm interesting priority where is the biggest copy and paste Bobby the biggest happiness because I remembered Isaiah for is pretty important in Isaiah for and I'm sorry I'm sorry Isaiah 41 and look for that hides the Gentile dispensation right there with the common right brother absolutely like I'm a highest Gentile dispensation or where is the biggest copy paste sort of First Samuel I'm sorry second 21 I want to show you something here I believe the Lord opened up a little bit and they give me much pleasure justice they God would show this to meriden leave it you judge yourself it may be even second Savior 21 here and right at the end of this chapter verse 13 moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel notice David having war of the Philistines once more springing out he says and David went down in his servants with him and fought against the Philistines and what David waxed faint for the first time in his military career game is finally getting tired he's had enough he's fighting his killing he's got mercy suitable I've been fighting since day one running from the king of Israel he says in east by bed which was one of the sons of the giant Goliath he says the weight of whose fear weighed 300 shekels of grass and wait it was girded with the new sword thought to have slain David he was weak he's getting tired where he's gonna wore out and Now Big Brother little brother whatever remember what he did his big brother it does bella peace and now your mind David us here getting tire on there I'm coming for it i'd imagine a giant fried forgot everything else push that it I don't to fight you i don't buy you as I want that guy yeah alright alright David probably finding in other battles and the quarter lies she's big big boy call me oh here we go tired Lord you gotta do something out oh sure but verse 17 but I wish I the son of his araya secured him as small to those he killed him and when the meta David sweared him saying thou shalt go no more out with us the battle that that was quenched not the light of his room his roughest battle right here first time he could have faced I mean really he was could've faced death and now the battle is over they defeated the Philistine what's never and fine thus all had just died that enemy was gone all of his enemies is now so they're all settled peace first time in David's life since Alya he sings a song I give them the song chapter 22 verse 1 and they would speak in the Lord to solve the words of this song in the day the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies now the hand of Saul 100 songs start and he said the Lord is my rock is it the Lord of my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock let him in here will I trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation by high tolerances my refuge my Savior he said thou save us me from violence he says I will call on the Lord look who is worthy to be praised so shall we be saved from my enemies when the waiters of death notice comforts me the blood of ungodly man made me afraid the sorrows but death hell the sorrows of hell come with me about and the snares of death for enemy in my distress I called upon the Lord and he cried unto my and cry out to my god and he did he hear my voice out of in his temple he says in my cried and entrance was here this is david what at the time of this is the Lord saving one at this time he was such a man of god of profit that God was hurt him out of his temple because what did his body was God's best left without God's king that's it that was God's prophet sure and then we'll all those 4,000 years later we see Christ on the cross Christ is screaming out on what goes temple once again absolute sure it's the exact same thing Paul Peter said that David was a prophet episode so here we see this is the exact same this is Christ on the cross section sure now he says and the earth shook and trouble they're here quick these are the photos of the earth of heaven move the shoot because he was wrong who God what's wrong he says that they one of us smoke out of his nostrils in a fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet notice the exact same saying is Christ on the cross we have the earthquake we have a man in distress cries out from his temple and what God hears it and then what we see that God comes down and then he brings darkness look he says and he bounded heavens also and came down and doctors was under his feet and he wrote upon a chair of and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind and he made darkest pavilions run about him dark waters in the dark dark clouds and sky the exact same setting things of god this is the biggest copy and paste for hear anybody where does this end up songs 18 Psalms eighty men absolutely this is the biggest three the entire song was so powerful about deliverance no matter where was Jesus at where was what encompassed by death and surrounded by hell and soon absolute why is that so important well why would we couldn't be putting in twice he had me reason I believe it's because Christ in the bride Christ now all the live godly shall suffer persecution how much persecution honey you know when the guys came two nights ago and held you by gunpoint put you through them through the back of the truck there and handcuffed good and you cried out and God look what does that happen to us right just being a Christian I when he first came into this message there's a couple of brother the brother the head in the back of the twin children chuckling now and came on because it came into the word yeah oh yeah we're pretty big bad mostly Berber I was right but now here there the promise in this is the greatest copy and paste as a promise let's turn to Psalms 18 starts out the exact same way he said the Lord is my rock there's to my fortress and this and that verse 9 ah what started vs. up 10 actually let me read let me read to you what the Prophet said it was kind of slow turd well the Prophet said about them clouds when we see the clouds and God coming down trees angry he heard a voice out of his Tabernacle mark of the beast in the seal of God 61 e sez e 40 he says he says a god a great guy who's full of love he is full of love in order that he loved he must have to have judgment to be just so he is a merciful God tonight he's my friend when you stand before my judgment on that dark cloudy day he says he will be a god in full of anger the Bible says so in his rack he says I was down on the front I was cutting cutting their a stone from Colorado and goes into some story here he says and I said he gets in conversation with a woman about the dark cloud hanging down on Christ he says I said that's the clouds of God's wrath that was was God come down in the cloud was he mad at the people were crucifying him no that's not where the anger of God was was directed act way they took his son and they will haunt a cross riding bina they put thornden they're crucifying him and God was not angry with it not with them where was the anger of God he says the clouds of God's wrath God poured his wrath upon Christ who took my place at Calvary man this is where the anger of God was directed at not upon the Romans or the Jew that that instant but it was all on Jesus Christ deep amin he says he died into the judgments and wrath of God God poured out his fierce judgment upon him and he took my place yes sir and said he says I was a sinner he took my place cheers running up with a woman's I said he's in worse simple we have no hope but God knows that we had has to stand these judgments and Jesus took them force and then the clouds hanging over the cross was God's wrath for another one he said he bore the wrath of God in his own body that we might be free oh what a story when it's true God tract sure absolutely so here back in solids 18 we see what we see the cry from the distress verse 11 verse 11 18 Jesus and he made his darknesses and he made artists his see her place at the pavillion right about him for dark quaters and thick clouds of the sky and the brightness that was before him thick clouds pass hailstone and pulled the fire and the Lord also learned in heaven and the highest aim invoice hailstones the colon the fire he sent out his errand and scattered em say that God I believe this the coming deliverance from the bright and Jesus Christ the Bible says adult who she needed mixable army God has a projected she will protect your absolute he says verse 15 to the channels are wider were seen in the Foundation's will discover death I rebuke he's Oh Lord and the blast the breath of the nostrils he sent from above he took me look at the scene here is the same as Christ in danger of death and danger going to hell right at us come up and what the Bible says that he caught a ganito he said he took me and he drew me out of many Watchers what does why does represent peoples nations welcome to Tom's but this right here is the rapture right there what is a but it shows what we're gonna have to go through the exact same thing as Christ absolutely that's why we're seeing the world falling apart he'll rising up the people going totally insane bro rage is out of control absolutely there's just is the stage has been set absolutely crazy look I'm closing here but it shows were absolutely one with Christ yeah if you are sealed the Holy Ghost Christ sees you as an equal that's why he says Jane doing here is crazy you will not go into this tribulation you don't mind going to discriminations thanks God checkup every out or the reason I want to go to that church service was friday because i had a rough month buying battle just
