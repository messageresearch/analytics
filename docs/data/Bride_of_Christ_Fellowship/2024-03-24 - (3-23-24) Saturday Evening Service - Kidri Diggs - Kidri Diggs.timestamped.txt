[38:04] we've done but it's all your choosing
[38:06] Lord Lord you you chose us when it
[38:09] looked like there was nothing good in US
[38:11] Lord but you knew before the foundation
[38:13] of the world what we would be Lord
[38:15] through all our mistakes through all our
[38:17] ups and downs none of that could stop
[38:19] that seed from being drawn closer to the
[38:22] light so Lord we just appreciate Lord
[38:25] that you're in control of our lives Lord
[38:28] and Lord we heard all the many requests
[38:31] Lord physical and natural Lord we just
[38:32] pray that you just touch that need
[38:34] tonight Lord and just continue to bless
[38:36] this church Lord and let the words of
[38:38] inspiration touch every need tonight
[38:40] Lord help us to move out of the way and
[38:42] let the gift of God be led by the Holy
[38:45] Spirit tonight in The Wonderful Name of
[38:47] Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen
[38:49] amen amen hallelujah if you have your
[38:52] Bibles let's turn to um Galatians the
[38:56] 4th chapter
[38:58] Galatians chapter
[39:01] 4
[39:03] uh and then we're going to we're going
[39:05] to kind of backtrack we going to go back
[39:06] to Romans 8 Galatians
[39:11] 4 and verse
[39:14] one Galatians 4 and verse
[39:17] one the Bible
[39:22] says Galatians 4 And1 The Bible says now
[39:25] I say that the there as long as he is a
[39:29] child differ nothing from a servant
[39:33] though he be Lord of all but is under
[39:36] tutors and governors until the time
[39:39] appointed of the father even so we when
[39:43] we were
[39:44] children were in bondage under the
[39:47] elements of the world but when the
[39:49] fullness of the time was come God sent
[39:52] forth a son made of a woman made under
[39:56] the law to redeem them that were under
[39:58] the law that we might receive the
[40:02] adoption of sons amen amen let's go to
[40:06] um Romans chapter
[40:16] 8 familiar verse of scriptures Romans 8
[40:20] let's start reading at
[40:23] um verse
[40:25] 14 Romans 8 8 and 14 the Bible says for
[40:29] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[40:33] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[40:37] received the spirit of bondage again to
[40:39] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[40:42] adoption whereby we cry ABA father the
[40:46] spirit itself bear witness with our
[40:48] spirit that we are the children of God
[40:51] and if children then hes HS of
[40:54] God and Joint hes
[40:58] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[41:01] him that we may be also glorified
[41:05] together for I reckon that the
[41:06] sufferings of this present time are not
[41:08] worthy to be compared with the glory
[41:11] which shall be revealed in us for the
[41:15] earnest expectation of the creature
[41:17] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[41:20] sons of God Amen may the lord to bless
[41:22] the reading of his word you can have
[41:25] your seats amen praise the Lord God is
[41:29] so good amen amen and we thank him for
[41:34] all that he's done and all that he's
[41:37] doing for in everything that God does
[41:41] there's a purpose behind it amen and we
[41:44] know that the Lord is always willing
[41:47] Hallelujah to show himself Mighty and
[41:49] strong in our lives so you know um
[41:54] tonight by the by the grace of God I
[41:56] want to use for subject spiritual
[41:59] placement spiritual placement amen and
[42:03] and you know I just I just want to quote
[42:05] this verse right here something that we
[42:08] all uh uh pretty much is is like a
[42:11] staple in what we call the message as
[42:13] far as scripture is concerned uh
[42:15] Revelations 18 and4 the Bible says and I
[42:19] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[42:22] come out of her my people that ye be not
[42:25] partakers of her sins and that ye
[42:28] receive not of her plagues now that's
[42:31] that's that's that's one scripture that
[42:33] you know we as Believers We Know by
[42:35] heart but you know uh if you look at
[42:37] that scripture what God was saying is
[42:40] you're out of
[42:41] place you know as the believer they were
[42:43] in the wrong spot you know they were
[42:45] worshiping under the wrong Doctrine
[42:47] under the wrong leadership under the
[42:50] under the wrong guidance and God says
[42:52] come out of her my people and as the
[42:54] word be to be preached that word word
[42:57] begin to place that believer in the
[42:59] right place but you know placement is
[43:02] everything and you know as we as we look
[43:04] right here uh in the word of God you
[43:08] know it it talks about a a child and you
[43:11] know in Galatians 4 and and it says that
[43:14] you know that child differs no no
[43:16] nothing than a servant you know until it
[43:19] is it grows up until it gets to the
[43:22] place to where it can take over all the
[43:25] responsibilities that the father has
[43:27] amen but you know in order for that
[43:29] child to get there it has to be taught
[43:32] it has to be HHH trained it has to be
[43:35] weaned off certain things so all the
[43:38] whole time that child is there with with
[43:41] Governors and the teachers the whole
[43:43] thing is working on is his placement
[43:46] amen and you know I believe that what
[43:48] God has been doing this whole time with
[43:50] us the message I even have the quote for
[43:53] it said that this what this message of
[43:55] the hour has been doing is been placing
[43:58] us hallelujah according to God's
[44:01] position Hallelujah but you know
[44:03] placement is everything Hallelujah if I
[44:06] could make it you know I like to use
[44:07] natural types if if if if I could make
[44:09] it real plain and simple you know just
[44:12] think about this placement and we know
[44:14] when something is off just say for
[44:16] instance we came to church tonight and
[44:18] we had all the churches we had all the
[44:20] chairs right here and but we Tu the pull
[44:23] pit and we put it back there in the back
[44:25] and we kept the seats looking forward
[44:27] we' all walk in here and we'll say
[44:29] something's out of place we walk in here
[44:32] and we say why is the pull pit back
[44:34] there and or or we say why don't we turn
[44:37] the seats around because something is
[44:40] out of place and and a lot of times we
[44:43] as Believers we get out of place
[44:45] Hallelujah that doesn't mean we're not
[44:48] in the right place but our position may
[44:51] be out of order Hallelujah and you know
[44:53] you just think about it Hallelujah we
[44:55] want to fix that and put it in the right
[44:57] place amen we' want to either turn the
[44:59] seats around so we could see the
[45:02] preacher preaching or we'd want to put
[45:04] the pull pit back up here in the right
[45:06] place amen so placement is everything to
[45:10] God hallelujah that's why he didn't put
[45:13] Hallelujah brother brandham in Noah's
[45:17] day because God had already put a a
[45:20] preacher there Hallelujah with the right
[45:23] placement of word hallelujah and his
[45:26] word was going to place the people
[45:28] exactly where they needed to be
[45:30] Hallelujah so church for us to be here
[45:33] in this generation and in this time we
[45:35] ought to be thankful Hallelujah because
[45:38] God has spiritually placed Us in this
[45:40] day why cuz we can fulfill Hallelujah
[45:44] the thoughts of God for the end time
[45:47] amen but you know placement placement is
[45:50] everything Hallelujah if you look at a
[45:53] natural body just think about it
[45:55] Hallelujah why are my eyes in the front
[45:57] of my forehead why not on the
[46:01] side because the way I walk I walk
[46:04] straight and forward Hallelujah if my
[46:07] eyes were here I would walk like this
[46:10] and the body's not meant to walk
[46:12] sideways it's meant to walk like this
[46:14] Hallelujah so my eyes are put here for a
[46:17] reason Hallelujah they're there because
[46:19] that's the proper placement for me to
[46:22] get where I need to be Hallelujah and I
[46:24] want you to understand if God call you
[46:26] to to this church it's the proper
[46:28] placement for you to get where you need
[46:30] to
[46:32] be hallelujah
[46:37] amen that's why even when you're going
[46:39] through trials and things are happening
[46:42] you have to say as a Believer nothing's
[46:44] out of
[46:45] place Hallelujah because God knows
[46:49] exactly what he need to do to get the
[46:51] person or the body to the next place
[46:53] Hallelujah and you know if if if if we
[46:56] continue with placement and placement of
[46:58] the body hallelujah what if my mouth was
[47:01] on the side of my
[47:04] neck that'll be out of place cuz I'd be
[47:07] eating like
[47:08] this that that looks crazy doesn't it
[47:11] Hallelujah see sir so when we think
[47:13] about hallelujah how I love this word
[47:16] how strategic God is God is very
[47:19] strategic Hallelujah H the simplest
[47:23] things God puts his hand on he says
[47:25] that's exactly where I want it
[47:27] Hallelujah that's exactly what I want to
[47:29] happen Hallelujah Church even when we
[47:31] look like we're struggling or we're
[47:33] going through things we're praying about
[47:35] we like Lord help me God is
[47:39] strategic he knows exactly what that
[47:43] child is going to do for you in your
[47:46] life
[47:48] hallelujah
[47:49] hallelujah amen God Is So Hallelujah
[47:53] strategic when it comes to placement
[47:56] Hallelujah God let uh he let 10 Brothers
[48:00] get angry with
[48:02] one why because that anger was going to
[48:06] place him oh go Hallelujah that anger
[48:11] was going to place him in a pit
[48:13] Hallelujah because that pit was going to
[48:16] place him
[48:17] oh oh my that pit was going to put him
[48:22] right in the place to where Hallelujah
[48:24] the Caravan could come down and snatch
[48:27] him up and then they were going to take
[48:28] him Hallelujah right up to Egypt
[48:31] Hallelujah right up to where they needed
[48:33] to be Hallelujah and then he was going
[48:35] to get it placed into jaus house placed
[48:38] in the jail house then placed in the
[48:40] throne
[48:44] Hallelujah but it but it looked like all
[48:47] of it was a trial no it was God
[48:50] spiritually placing him in the right
[48:55] place
[48:58] [Applause]
[49:00] Hallelujah sometimes the things that
[49:02] look completely out of order is God
[49:05] working on your
[49:09] position placing and position work
[49:12] together Joseph would have never got to
[49:14] his position if he didn't get to his
[49:19] placement amen but it took hallelujah
[49:23] amen something going against the grain
[49:26] to get him in that place Hallelujah but
[49:30] what was it it was the father making
[49:34] sure that that child could become heir
[49:37] of
[49:38] all Hallelujah listen let's read it
[49:41] again the Bible says now I say that the
[49:44] heir as long as he is a child differ
[49:47] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[49:50] of all but is under tutors what kind of
[49:53] tutor the
[49:55] pit what kind of tutor hatred from his
[49:59] brothers what kind of tutor lying from
[50:02] Piper's
[50:04] wife my all these things Hallelujah was
[50:08] positionally placing
[50:10] him to the throne of
[50:13] God oh my he says tutors and governors
[50:18] until the time appointed of the father
[50:21] and you look church I love the I love
[50:23] the life I love the life of of of of of
[50:26] of Joseph hallelujah it's two guys when
[50:28] I get to heaven we going to chop it up
[50:32] Hallelujah that's old South Carolina
[50:34] slang chop it up mean to talk about you
[50:37] know you chopping something up you
[50:38] working with something so we just going
[50:40] to chop it up we're going to sit down we
[50:42] going to chop it up for a million years
[50:44] H but you know I'm going go to Joseph
[50:46] and I'm begin to talk to Joseph Joseph
[50:49] what was it like Hallelujah being in
[50:51] that pit and you knew that it was your
[50:54] brothers who put you there
[50:57] see church sometimes we have to overcome
[51:01] ourselves because it'll be God doing
[51:04] something in your life that you don't
[51:06] understand but God is positionally
[51:09] placing you Hallelujah to a place where
[51:12] you can not only just be a servant but
[51:14] now you can be heir of
[51:16] all Hallelujah by the time God was
[51:20] through with Joseph Hallelujah Joseph
[51:23] was running the whole
[51:24] Kingdom amen but he had to overcome his
[51:28] own thoughts he had to overcome his own
[51:31] bitterness he had to overcome Hallelujah
[51:34] his own complexes Hallelujah to get to
[51:36] his placement Hallelujah and sometimes
[51:39] we have to overcome our own selves Hall
[51:42] the problem is not Hallelujah the person
[51:45] that lied on you the problem is how
[51:47] you're taking that
[51:50] lie right
[51:52] amen because you can react Hallelujah
[51:55] and react wrong
[51:58] and then it's no longer their problem
[51:59] it's your problem Hallelujah so Church a
[52:02] lot of times things happen because God
[52:04] is trying to mature us amen but if you
[52:08] look you look you look at placement
[52:10] placement is everything you think about
[52:13] our lives everything we do deals with
[52:15] placement Hallelujah you don't jump on
[52:17] the passenger side if you going to
[52:21] drive there's no steering wheel there
[52:24] unless you in Europe
[52:28] Hallelujah unless you're in Paris
[52:29] somewhere or or or or in Africa
[52:32] Hallelujah there's no steering wheel on
[52:33] this side of the car all you you're here
[52:36] to be driven Hallelujah not to drive
[52:39] because of the way things are placed but
[52:41] the worst thing you can be is a person
[52:44] over here want to control everything
[52:46] right that's
[52:50] right my God may not have put you in a
[52:53] situation to drive he put you in his in
[52:56] a situation to be driven right
[52:59] Hallelujah so a lot of times we may go
[53:01] through something because it's that
[53:03] thing that's going to drive you
[53:05] hallelujah it's that thing that's going
[53:07] to wake you up it's that thing that's
[53:09] going to give you strength to say God I
[53:12] will come back another
[53:15] day Hallelujah but as long as you are
[53:19] driving you don't feel like you need any
[53:23] help so sometimes God want you to be on
[53:26] the passenger side so you can feel what
[53:28] it's like to be driven amen that's good
[53:36] hallelujah oh
[53:39] Church being driven Hallelujah is a good
[53:43] thing Hallelujah but the worst kind of
[53:46] person you can be is a person who always
[53:49] want to be in
[53:51] control good and when you're not in
[53:53] control you're trying to tell the person
[53:55] that's driving how to drive
[53:58] right yes sir yes sir normally that's a
[54:02] person who's in
[54:04] insecure with the person who's
[54:08] driving yes sir and we all supposed to
[54:10] be children of God Amen we're all
[54:13] supposed to be led by God we're all
[54:16] supposed to be saying God is in control
[54:18] of my life Hallelujah so why are we in
[54:21] so insecure about what you're going
[54:23] through right good brother good if God
[54:26] is in control just strap your seat belt
[54:28] in even if it look like an accident that
[54:30] seat belt is there to keep you tight
[54:33] hallelujah hallelujah you have to trust
[54:36] that you are in the right
[54:38] vehicle you have to trust that the
[54:41] vehicle has been battle
[54:43] tested Hallelujah this gospel has been
[54:46] battle tested this Revelation has been
[54:50] battle tested your pastor has been
[54:53] battle tested and you have to believe
[54:56] it's all right to sit over here with no
[54:59] control and just be
[55:04] driven hallelujah
[55:08] hallelujah there's too many people that
[55:11] want to drive when you need to be
[55:14] driven sit back and relax and just
[55:18] depend on the
[55:21] vehicle Hallelujah because nowadays
[55:25] Hallelujah these vehicles are so
[55:27] equipped they got buzzers and beats for
[55:31] everything it's kind of
[55:34] sickening see I'm kind of old
[55:37] school you know I I'm going to take
[55:40] y'all way back y'all young people ain't
[55:43] never seen a
[55:45] car where you pull the gas plate down
[55:48] and you put gas in from the
[55:52] back yeah we old enough h
[55:57] but some of you young ones ain't never
[55:58] seen that you only seen the placement
[56:00] from the side when you get there
[56:04] you or you get on this
[56:06] side but there was a day Hallelujah
[56:09] where you had to stand at the very back
[56:11] to get what you need Hallelujah and you
[56:14] know sometimes you may feel like you're
[56:16] alone you may feel like Hallelujah
[56:19] nobody's understanding you you may feel
[56:21] like you're in the very back but it was
[56:23] made that way hallelujah hallelujah it
[56:26] was made that way for the benefit of the
[56:29] car because the tank was so heavy it had
[56:31] to be in the back of the car Hallelujah
[56:34] but nowadays they have things so
[56:35] lightweight and so constructed they can
[56:37] put the gas tank anywhere
[56:40] hallelujah hallelujah but as we see
[56:43] times change Hallelujah placement look
[56:45] different but God doesn't change
[56:47] hallelujah amen God deals with
[56:49] situations different but what he's
[56:51] trying to do he's trying to get all of
[56:53] us to a place to where we can take over
[56:55] his spot
[56:59] Hallelujah that's what placement is all
[57:03] about I know it's a hook yeah you know
[57:07] you you you if I can use a natural
[57:08] example for a second everybody all right
[57:11] if you take a team hallelujah what good
[57:14] is a quarterback if he's trying to be
[57:16] Hallelujah a linebacker right he's out
[57:20] of place right he have all the dreams he
[57:22] want about being able to run somebody
[57:24] down and Tackle them he not built for
[57:26] that right he don't have the stamina for
[57:28] that right Hallelujah he never studied
[57:31] to be that so you know what he do he'd
[57:33] fail in that position Hallelujah but if
[57:37] he get in the right position he can take
[57:39] the team to to to to to to to a winning
[57:42] spot Hallelujah he he can take the team
[57:45] to another level in his position but
[57:47] once he get out of position the whole
[57:49] team is subject to
[57:52] failure and it's just the same way in
[57:54] the body of Christ all of us oh let me
[57:57] read you something right quick
[57:58] hallelujah oh my Hallelujah listen what
[58:01] the prophet of God says hallelujah now
[58:03] what I'm talking about is us as
[58:05] Believers in our position hallelujah our
[58:09] spiritual positions according to the
[58:11] direct leadership of God hallelujah not
[58:14] somebody telling you what they think you
[58:16] ought to be right or where they think
[58:19] you are to be place but I'm talking
[58:21] about under the direct leadership of God
[58:24] hallelujah hallelujah you know I've had
[58:26] people ask me you know that that was at
[58:29] my church and maybe saw me years later
[58:31] and they be like uh uh I say years later
[58:34] maybe like five six years later and they

[58:49] I'm like
[58:51] yeah it's like wow and I you know I I I
[58:55] filter that
[58:56] sometimes because people think because
[58:59] they left you have to
[59:00] leave or they think because they went
[59:03] through something that caused them to to
[59:06] to to to move on that you ought to move
[59:08] on and my and my statement to that is

[1:03:42] that
[1:03:46] Hallelujah church I'm going say
[1:03:48] something that uh uh Matt Watkins said
[1:03:52] at our church and I about did a backflip
[1:03:54] when he said it
[1:03:57] do you ever hear something the preacher
[1:03:58] saying and it's it it hits you in such a
[1:04:02] place of
[1:04:04] Revelation but the Revelation doesn't
[1:04:06] give you the big head it causes you to
[1:04:09] Rejoice H and this brother was preaching
[1:04:12] and he was talking he preached a message
[1:04:13] called broken but not bitter Hallelujah
[1:04:16] if you can find it go listen to that one
[1:04:18] Hallelujah it'll really help you amen
[1:04:20] hallelujah it's all this the fivefold
[1:04:23] ministry amen broken but not bitter he
[1:04:25] preached it out Church Hallelujah listen
[1:04:27] church when he was preaching that
[1:04:29] message he made a reference he said you
[1:04:31] can look at people's lives and you see
[1:04:33] their struggling you see all these
[1:04:34] things and and and because of who we are
[1:04:37] as Believers we're word people so what
[1:04:39] we do is we measure things up by the
[1:04:41] word amen we measure this up by the word
[1:04:44] we measure that up by the word we
[1:04:46] measure one another up by the word and
[1:04:48] he say doing that you can look at
[1:04:49] somebody and see what they going through
[1:04:51] and you say that disqualify them for
[1:04:53] this that disqualify them for this but
[1:04:55] he said the very thing that disqualifies
[1:04:58] you qualifies you in the kingdom of
[1:05:05] God
[1:05:07] hallelujah oh my peter Hallelujah being
[1:05:11] the man he was was what qualified him to
[1:05:14] be the man he was Paul being the man he
[1:05:17] was was what qualified him to be the man
[1:05:20] he
[1:05:22] was hallelujah oh my
[1:05:28] Church positioning and placing is
[1:05:31] everything look if we could just get all
[1:05:33] in our proper place and position tonight
[1:05:35] H don't worry about nobody else what
[1:05:36] nobody else doing see what I'm preaching
[1:05:39] tonight is a fragment of
[1:05:42] adoption
[1:05:45] yes because your spiritual placement
[1:05:48] really deals with your
[1:05:50] adoption an adoption is you being able
[1:05:53] to sign the check h
[1:05:57] write the check sign it and don't have
[1:05:59] to ask God for
[1:06:00] anything because you know who you
[1:06:06] are you said brother is that true yes
[1:06:08] it's true look Hallelujah you can look
[1:06:11] in the Bible Hallelujah and you can see
[1:06:14] men who were adopted in Hallelujah their
[1:06:16] position where they didn't have to
[1:06:19] pray yes sir they just spoke it and it
[1:06:23] happened Hallelujah listen Paul knew who
[1:06:27] he was in such a place where he would
[1:06:30] say hallelujah After I'm Gone gous wol
[1:06:34] was going to come that's right because
[1:06:36] he knew who he was he knew that nobody
[1:06:39] would come and challenge him under the
[1:06:41] inspiration of his position Hallelujah
[1:06:44] in his position he was unchallengeable
[1:06:46] God
[1:06:50] tomighty who who does that sound like
[1:06:52] that sounds like
[1:06:54] Christ
[1:06:57] am Christ was unchallengeable in his
[1:07:01] position whatever demons and Devils came
[1:07:04] around Hallelujah they told Jesus we
[1:07:06] know who thou are Jesus say shut
[1:07:10] up don't tell nobody
[1:07:15] nothing see let me tell you something
[1:07:18] the Devils know who you are in your
[1:07:21] position nobody else might not know but
[1:07:23] the devil knows how every every demon
[1:07:26] power knew who Christ
[1:07:28] was amen amen the Sadducees and
[1:07:31] Pharisees they call him be El above but
[1:07:34] the Devils call him the Holy One of
[1:07:38] Israel why because they saw him in his
[1:07:42] position what was his position Lord of
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:48] all and because the Sadducees and
[1:07:50] Pharisees were out of their position
[1:07:53] Hallelujah as unbelievers they couldn't
[1:07:55] recognize
[1:07:58] God hallelujah and that's why people
[1:08:00] can't recognize God said the prophet
[1:08:02] because they out of position yes sir yes
[1:08:05] sir hallelujah oh my listen to
[1:08:09] this Oh
[1:08:11] my he says now try hard Christians to
[1:08:15] understand that this day that the
[1:08:18] message has been placing the believer in
[1:08:20] positionally place listen if every
[1:08:23] believer any believers in here tonight
[1:08:26] if every believer in here was in their
[1:08:31] place if every believer in here tonight
[1:08:35] yes was in their
[1:08:37] place now we just say Believers in here
[1:08:41] hallelujah yes sir oh my if every
[1:08:44] believer in here was in their place well
[1:08:47] I'm so thankful that we're whole rows of
[1:08:49] wheelchairs are set and there's only
[1:08:51] about two or three in here left if every
[1:08:54] believer knew their place a lady on a
[1:08:58] cart the man with the crutches along
[1:09:02] along there there would not be listen if
[1:09:07] every person was in their position in
[1:09:09] this
[1:09:10] church there would not be a feeble
[1:09:14] person in this
[1:09:18] building listen in the next 20
[1:09:23] minutes yes sir
[1:09:25] if everybody was in that position we
[1:09:28] wouldn't have to come up here with
[1:09:29] prayer
[1:09:31] requests
[1:09:32] right our lives will be the solution to
[1:09:35] what they need Hallelujah all we have to
[1:09:39] do Hallelujah is make contact and speak
[1:09:42] to that Hallelujah situation if everyone
[1:09:45] was in their position Hallelujah when we
[1:09:47] come to pray Hallelujah things will
[1:09:49] happen
[1:09:50] hallelujah amen because everything in
[1:09:54] his proper place only speaks of Victory
[1:09:57] hallelujah hallelujah what happens
[1:10:00] church when you go to sleep amen your
[1:10:02] body takes a rest but if everything is

[1:10:31] let me say this if this church continues
[1:10:33] to have everything working right people
[1:10:36] in acon will begin to wake up hallelujah
[1:10:40] hallelujah yes they begin to wake up and
[1:10:43] realize they're out of position

[1:10:47] working right in this
[1:10:49] church husbands Hallelujah will wake up

[1:11:01] amen hallelujah because everything is
[1:11:04] working right Hallelujah yes listen you
[1:11:08] know when you think about being
[1:11:10] positionally placed I ain't going to be
[1:11:11] too much longer I'm about to
[1:11:13] close but Church what I want to for the
[1:11:16] next couple
[1:11:19] minutes I want to take a key word and
[1:11:22] just kind of deal with it for a little
[1:11:24] bit
[1:11:26] and the key word where the Bible
[1:11:29] says you know in in in in in
[1:11:32] Romans it says the spirit itself bear
[1:11:35] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:11:37] children of God yes hallelujah
[1:11:41] hallelujah and you know there's a quote
[1:11:43] where the Prophet is is is I believe is
[1:11:46] wisdom versus
[1:11:47] Faith where the Prophet says Jesus
[1:11:52] defeated the devil simply
[1:11:55] by knowing who he
[1:12:02] was he didn't have to say Satan leave me
[1:12:04] alone in the name of the Father the Son
[1:12:07] the no you didn't have to do none of
[1:12:08] that that's right he have to I called
[1:12:11] down power from Heaven because I'm God
[1:12:13] he didn't have to do none of that
[1:12:15] Hallelujah he just knew who he was
[1:12:19] Hallelujah and what did that do that
[1:12:23] stopped Satan right in his tracks
[1:12:28] he knew he was the heir of all things
[1:12:31] Hallelujah he knew amen Satan came and
[1:12:34] tried to Temp him with bread he's the

[1:41:52] our position position is everything
[1:41:54] spiritual position adoption and listen
[1:41:57] what does it mean to be an
[1:41:59] heir the word Heir there's a lot of
[1:42:03] different things where you could say
[1:42:04] like
[1:42:05] um in England Queen Elizabeth died I
[1:42:08] think last
[1:42:10] year and her
[1:42:12] death made somebody else take over the
[1:42:16] throne right her husband died and she
[1:42:19] became the queen and she was the queen
[1:42:21] for years right she got two boys I
[1:42:25] think yeah she got
[1:42:29] Charles and I think Charles got boys
[1:42:31] something like that whatever y'all know
[1:42:33] what I'm talking about
[1:42:34] whatever and when she passed Hallelujah
[1:42:38] Charles became what
[1:42:41] king but as long as she was there she
[1:42:44] was Queen and Charles was just supposed
[1:42:46] to be
[1:42:49] king it don't work like that in the
[1:42:52] kingdom of God
[1:42:57] because of who he is I
[1:43:01] am
[1:43:03] hallelujah hallelujah look Hallelujah
[1:43:06] when the Sadducees and Pharisees start
[1:43:08] talking they talk Jesus said Abraham
[1:43:11] Rejoice to see my
[1:43:13] day Hallelujah see so Jesus was
[1:43:16] basically telling him Abraham knew who I
[1:43:18] was even though y'all
[1:43:22] don't
[1:43:23] y'all rejoicing about Abraham Abraham
[1:43:26] rejoiced about
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:31] me
[1:43:33] Hallelujah so we don't glory in what we
[1:43:35] can be on this side we glory on what we
[1:43:38] are in it in the neighborhood of
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:44] christall and you look back to it now
[1:43:47] Charles has taken over so he's become
[1:43:49] king why because the queen has died
[1:43:51] Hallelujah but Church look what I'm
[1:43:54] about to say hallelujah amen do you
[1:43:57] realize we were royalty before anybody
[1:44:01] ever
[1:44:07] died the Bible says before the
[1:44:10] foundation of the
[1:44:17] world Hallelujah I was a child of
[1:44:21] God I'm to the
[1:44:24] throne well
