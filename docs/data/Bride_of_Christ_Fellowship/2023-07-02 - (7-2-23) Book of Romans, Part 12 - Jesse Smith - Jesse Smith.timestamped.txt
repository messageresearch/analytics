[0:01] Grace
[0:06] Romans 5 verse 3 I'd like to continue on
[0:08] this
[0:10] series
[0:11] also I'm just going to tie it
[0:13] a different thought in at the end to try
[0:15] to bring a little something maybe a
[0:17] fresh scripture
[0:19] by God's grace and that I was inspired
[0:20] on yesterday
[0:23] Romans 5 verse 3. we'll read three down
[0:26] through nine
[0:35] Romans 5 verse 3.
[0:38] I'll read three down to eight and then
[0:40] we can all read nine together Romans 5
[0:43] verse 3. we've been dealing on this a
[0:46] couple services in a robe I'll probably
[0:47] move on from this today verse 3 says and
[0:50] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[0:53] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[0:57] patience and patience experience or
[1:01] christ-like character
[1:02] approved character
[1:05] and character produces hope
[1:09] and hope maketh not ashamed or does not
[1:11] disappoint
[1:13] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:15] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:18] given unto us
[1:20] verse 6. for when we were yet without
[1:23] strength
[1:24] in due time Christ died for the ungodly
[1:29] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:31] one die yet per adventure for a good man
[1:35] someone even Dare To Die
[1:37] but God commandeth his love toward us in
[1:40] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[1:42] died for us
[1:44] verse 9 let's read that together on
[1:46] three one two three much more than being
[1:49] now justified by his blood we shall be
[1:53] saved from wrath through him amen let's
[1:56] have one more word of prayer if you have
[1:57] a need on your heart let's make
[1:58] anointing to God today
[1:59] no doubt I have needs on my heart I'd
[2:01] like to see the Lord Minister too and I
[2:03] know you do too so let's pray father God
[2:06] again we come into your presence Lord
[2:07] It's All About You Jesus Lord God we've
[2:10] sang these songs and we've loved them
[2:11] Lord God we worshiped you we thank you
[2:13] for this wonderful atmosphere of faith
[2:15] and worship that we feel today Lord God
[2:17] we have needs but at the same time Lord
[2:19] we're joyful because we know the one who
[2:21] can meet needs is here as well Lord God
[2:23] you never failed you're never late
[2:25] you're right on time Lord God hallelujah
[2:28] all great things all good things come
[2:30] from thee Lord God and may you pour out
[2:32] great blessings and and words of
[2:35] strength and Grace to us today Lord God
[2:37] may your spirit move right here among us
[2:38] today Lord God we know you promised
[2:40] wherever two or three are there you are
[2:42] in the midst so Lord we know you're in
[2:43] our midst today God may we be mindful of
[2:46] your presence today your power your love
[2:48] your strength oh God hallelujah may you
[2:50] speak to us today by Your Word Lord and
[2:53] just continue to guide us Lord into the
[2:55] word of God into your truth and may we
[2:57] be strengthened and edified today made
[2:59] stronger today and we ask all these
[3:01] blessings in Jesus Christ's name and the
[3:03] Saints said amen God bless you as you're
[3:06] being seated there praise God
[3:14] so uh
[3:15] Lydia had said that uh Simon spoke on
[3:19] how God is jealous God so
[3:22] wish I could have heard that message but
[3:25] actually I think he preached it at
[3:27] Living Waters so I guess I could go
[3:28] online and get a different version of it
[3:30] right because each time someone preaches
[3:32] a same message you know you get a
[3:33] different version of it
[3:35] I trust it was a blessing to everybody
[3:36] and thank you for everybody who helped
[3:38] out you know while we were out by God's
[3:40] grace
[3:43] so we want to look at this continue on
[3:45] Romans here I have a few slides here
[3:47] we'll show here by the grace of the Lord
[3:50] I'll just kind of tell you a little bit
[3:52] more about our trip you know we went to
[3:53] Pennsylvania had a great time in the
[3:54] Lord and you know that Pastor Paul he's
[3:58] actually into movies he does movies uh
[4:01] he works with like
[4:03] Productions and documentaries and so he
[4:06] knows the the people the leaders of
[4:08] Sight and Sound
[4:09] and he said years ago he told me he said
[4:11] you keep this family friendly he said
[4:13] you keep this
[4:15] um you know don't let any smut in it
[4:16] don't let any sin come in it and he said
[4:18] God will bless you
[4:20] and God's really blessed them
[4:23] so it was really interesting and he said
[4:25] they're putting on a movie uh January
[4:27] 1st 2025 and I told him you know let me
[4:30] know and they're going to do the history
[4:32] of the anabaptist
[4:34] so that's the that's the the original
[4:37] Saints during the Reformation who now
[4:39] turned into the Amish so in other words
[4:41] basically the Amish and Mennonites there
[4:43] uh their founding fathers you know were
[4:46] the anabaptists and they gave their
[4:48] lives
[4:49] many of them were martyrs
[4:51] for Jesus Christ uh you know during the
[4:53] time of the Reformation period right
[4:55] around the time of you know Martin
[4:56] Luther and everything and so they're
[4:58] making a documentary on it and uh
[5:00] they're going to have they said they're
[5:01] going to spend I think the budget is a
[5:03] couple million dollars they're going to
[5:04] spend on this new movie
[5:06] and so just really interesting and now
[5:08] they also came out of Joseph Coleman's
[5:11] movement which brother Branham ordained
[5:12] Joseph Coleman but you know Joseph
[5:14] Coleman his later years really got off
[5:16] the word of God and then they brought a
[5:18] lot of disgrace upon the message
[5:19] I mentioned that movement but anyways 12
[5:22] years ago they realized wow this
[5:24] movement is worshiping Joseph Coleman we
[5:26] got to get out of this movement
[5:28] and so they've had that church there for
[5:30] 12 years
[5:31] like I said it's like a twin Church to
[5:33] us I didn't know we had a twin but we
[5:35] got a twin over there in Pennsylvania
[5:37] they're just I mean it's just like
[5:39] archers
[5:40] he and I went and uh I said okay this is
[5:44] just like hole when he said that's right
[5:46] they were a couple people were standing
[5:47] up amening and I preached on the message
[5:50] the red heifer that I preached here and
[5:52] I preach it at many places God's really
[5:53] blessed that message and
[5:55] um
[5:56] just as kind of like an update you know
[5:58] I just thought I'd share with you the
[6:00] pastor got up afterwards and he said
[6:01] myself and the other minister have been
[6:03] preaching on this for two months he said
[6:07] and he said this is exactly what we
[6:10] needed to hear he said we've been
[6:12] working on fellowship and how there's
[6:13] Fellowship in the holiest of holies and
[6:16] that's what God has called us to called
[6:19] us to is fellowship and he said you just
[6:21] preached and the pastor kept turning
[6:23] around while I was preaching looking at
[6:24] the other people like
[6:26] I thought well it must be must be
[6:28] preaching the right thing you know
[6:31] but we had two people come up for prayer
[6:33] one was for healing and we'll just trust
[6:34] that God will heal that individual the
[6:36] other one was a young young lady
[6:38] rededicating her life to the Lord it was
[6:41] just a beautiful
[6:42] prayer you know she said she got cold on
[6:44] God and uh
[6:46] she confessed her sins and it was just
[6:48] really sweet she was weeping and crying
[6:49] and you know
[6:50] for me I like that visual so she had not
[6:53] you know pulled out of her nose it was
[6:55] all just falling all the way are you I
[6:57] might not seem something like to you but
[6:59] that really blessed me because many
[7:02] times I prayed that same thing happened
[7:03] to me it's gross but it happens you know
[7:06] just when you're under the presence of
[7:07] God like that I thought that was really
[7:08] sincere she was all smiles afterwards
[7:12] was so thankful and everybody was so
[7:13] happy and uh you know we're going back
[7:16] there you know in April for uh the
[7:19] Daniel show
[7:21] on my Spring Break
[7:23] so I said well I'll be back in April if
[7:24] you want me to preach there so they said
[7:26] they would like me to preach there again
[7:27] in April
[7:28] so we're going back there but let's
[7:31] remember keep remembering them in prayer
[7:32] their sweet little church there
[7:35] and then you know Saturday night or so
[7:37] sorry Friday night I went down there to
[7:39] The Junction City Saints they're all
[7:40] doing really well
[7:42] and we had two visitors from uh brother
[7:45] Jeff Snodgrass Church in Logan
[7:48] and I preached I just felt led to preach
[7:50] on the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[7:52] soul and I just printed off you know a
[7:54] bunch of quotes from other brand I'm in
[7:55] a bunch of scriptures
[7:57] and numerous people were crying at the
[8:00] end nobody came up for prayer but
[8:01] afterwards four people told me that was
[8:03] exactly what they needed to hear
[8:05] and they said so many things answered so
[8:07] many questions that they had and it was
[8:09] a great I was just preaching the
[8:10] brothers basement there you know it was
[8:12] really really wonderful time in the Lord
[8:14] so it's been just a great time to go
[8:17] minister to other Saints and strengthen
[8:20] the body of Christ praise God
[8:22] I don't think I've ever been this busy
[8:24] before in my life you know I'm on
[8:26] vacation might have been super busy and
[8:27] then brother Brooks wants me to come out
[8:29] to Iowa
[8:31] next or this month so I may go when
[8:35] brother Ben norad's here because I
[8:36] already have a preacher here
[8:38] so when benarod comes I think I might go
[8:40] to Iowa to talk to my wife and the
[8:42] family about that
[8:44] but just so you know Ben Naruto be here
[8:45] on the 16th we have some birthdays
[8:47] coming up cases on the 18th for the Jose
[8:50] are you right after Acacia your birthday
[8:52] 19.
[8:54] amen and then we got Nature's on the
[8:57] 21st amen okay
[9:00] okay what do you say bro what'd you say
[9:03] bro
[9:05] [Laughter]
[9:08] so many times around right
[9:12] so three birthdays in July so praise God
[9:14] in a wedding in August so we got a lot
[9:16] of a lot to look forward to these next
[9:17] few months
[9:19] half the Year is already gone you know
[9:21] so we know it's been invested in the
[9:23] great the best things the word of God
[9:25] so Hallelujah so let's look at the Lord
[9:27] here you know we we're still on this
[9:29] second section today we'll start moving
[9:31] over into the third section here
[9:34] crucifixion with Christ and the
[9:36] Believers walk in the Holy Spirit
[9:39] so we've seen how the whole world is
[9:40] guilty before God but we're justified by
[9:43] faith as the solution for Guilt just
[9:45] like Abraham was justified by faith he
[9:47] was called out out of a life of idolatry
[9:50] he was he was carving Idols making idols
[9:53] and and his dad was somehow connected to
[9:55] the Tower of Babel it was all idolatry
[9:57] and yet God in his voice one voice the
[10:00] voice of God called him out and
[10:02] separated him praise God that's what
[10:04] God's done for us he separated us from
[10:05] our life of idolatry praise God and he
[10:08] saved us by his grace as well
[10:10] not of any merits of our own but just
[10:13] because we believed his word we believed
[10:15] in the cross of Jesus Christ he's
[10:17] imputed his righteousness to us and now
[10:19] he's going to finish what he started
[10:21] praise God just as God finished it with
[10:23] Abraham he's going to finish it with our
[10:25] lives so these are you know newer
[10:27] scriptures I guess we'd say so verse 6
[10:29] for when we were yet without Strength In
[10:32] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly I
[10:37] just like uh to say this you know Christ
[10:39] died when we were completely weakened
[10:42] you know in every believer uh you know
[10:45] would say the same you know before we
[10:46] knew Christ we were totally weak you
[10:48] know we had no strength to live a good
[10:50] life we had no strength to uh to do any
[10:53] Miracles we had no strength to to
[10:54] overcome anything right we were slaves
[10:57] to sin
[10:58] or if and if not then we were slaves to
[11:00] religion like the Jews they were slaves
[11:02] so legalism and and trying to work their
[11:04] way to Salvation
[11:06] but the Bible says that Christ died for
[11:09] us in the due time and I think it was
[11:12] beautiful you know God waited four
[11:13] thousand years uh in order to let the
[11:16] let all mankind know that that no man
[11:19] could earn salvation no man no woman
[11:22] could earn salvation God gave them four
[11:24] thousand years to try to to to realize
[11:28] that that salvation would never come by
[11:30] their efforts alone and think of all the
[11:32] animals that have been sacrificed my
[11:34] millions and billions maybe of animals
[11:36] that had died to try to show these
[11:38] people uh the The Plan of Salvation that
[11:42] blood always had to be shed it was going
[11:45] to take blood another in order for man
[11:46] to be right with God blood had to be
[11:48] shed
[11:49] and God showed them through four
[11:50] thousand years so much blood had to be
[11:52] shed you know there was so much of a
[11:54] sacrifice and it was showing that Jesus
[11:56] that so many sins would be put upon
[11:58] Christ
[12:00] not just the sins of the past but the
[12:01] sins of the whole world not just the
[12:03] sins of the Believers but the sins of
[12:05] the Sinners as well
[12:06] he was speaking that the cross proves
[12:09] his love Hallelujah
[12:11] and I just think it's so beautiful that
[12:13] you know at the right time right at the
[12:14] right moment you know God sent Jesus to
[12:17] die for sins
[12:19] and then we can look back we can look
[12:21] back two thousand years and say wow uh
[12:23] you know history knowledge had 2 000
[12:25] years to enjoy the blessings of Christ
[12:27] amen hallelujah we know most people
[12:29] won't find it but we can see the history
[12:32] of the church and we can see how God's
[12:33] grace was on the history of the church
[12:35] for two thousand years Hallelujah in
[12:37] each trial the Believers were able to
[12:40] overcome because of what Christ did
[12:42] Hallelujah
[12:43] because they were assured think about
[12:45] that they were many of them were Martyrs
[12:47] many of them died because they were
[12:48] assured that God loved them and that
[12:50] that God expressed his love through the
[12:52] cross praise God even Peter one of the
[12:54] you know one of the original Martyrs
[12:56] there in the beginning even he was so
[12:58] assured of the love of the Cross he said
[12:59] crucify me upside down because I'm not
[13:02] worthy to be crucified like Jesus was
[13:04] crucified my just the uh the power of
[13:07] the cross at such an effect on the
[13:09] Believers it turned 11 men that ran from
[13:12] Jesus it turned them from uh from
[13:16] deserters to men that would all give
[13:18] their lives for Christ except for John
[13:20] who died uh the only one who died a
[13:22] normal life but all the other ten were
[13:24] were able just to give their lives as a
[13:26] sacrifice because of the power of the
[13:29] love of Jesus Amen I love what the Bible
[13:31] says that when he washed their feet I
[13:33] love what the Bible says about Jesus
[13:34] Jesus the Bible said when it came to his
[13:36] end of Earthly life the Bible said he
[13:39] loved them to the end praise God and he
[13:41] made himself a servant and he wash their
[13:44] feet praise God and he loved them to the
[13:46] end he broke bread he had communion with
[13:48] them he ate with them and he promised
[13:50] them I'll eat again with you I'll drink
[13:52] again with you but it'll be in the
[13:54] future Kingdom praise God hallelujah but
[13:56] first i'm going to prove my love to you
[13:58] by Dying For You on the cross amen what
[14:01] uh what a expression of love we have in
[14:03] Christ Jesus
[14:05] verse 7 says for scarcely for a
[14:08] righteous man will one die
[14:10] so in other words you rarely find
[14:12] someone that will die for another it's
[14:15] very rare
[14:17] yet per adventure for a good man some
[14:19] would even Dare To Die
[14:22] so it's so rare to find someone that
[14:24] would give their life for another
[14:26] so this is why we should honor our
[14:28] veterans this is why you know we have
[14:30] July 4th that's why you know we'll we'll
[14:32] you you and I will probably go somewhere
[14:34] we'll watch some fireworks be shot off
[14:36] and we'll say wow that's beautiful wow
[14:38] that's amazing the whole point of that
[14:40] is to remember men that gave their lives
[14:43] men and women right men and women who
[14:45] gave their lives mostly men though at
[14:46] that time you know
[14:48] men and women that gave their lives it's
[14:50] to remember that
[14:51] you know they'll spend thousands and
[14:53] hundreds of thousands of dollars on
[14:55] fireworks to help us remember that that
[14:58] men would leave their families young men
[15:00] many times would leave their families
[15:02] and know they're going off to die
[15:05] right scarcely
[15:08] scarcely the the right anyone would die
[15:12] for a righteous person but think of the
[15:14] lives you know there were many lives
[15:17] that they would they would sacrifice
[15:19] knowing they're going to die and yet
[15:21] they would walk right into death why so
[15:24] it would we would have hope for the
[15:25] future
[15:26] praise God and look look where we live
[15:28] today look at the blessings we have
[15:29] today praise God because there were some
[15:32] that chose to die that we could have
[15:34] freedoms praise God so let's enjoy the
[15:36] freedom of the Lord amen
[15:38] amen hallelujah and I put that question
[15:40] on there who would you die for
[15:42] if you had a chance who would you die
[15:44] for because the Bible said it's very
[15:46] scarce very rare to find someone that
[15:49] would die for another
[15:52] and yet Jesus died for many who would
[15:54] never love him
[15:56] and I love the of course the scripture
[15:58] from Hebrews 12 where the Bible said for
[16:00] the joy that was set before him he
[16:02] endured the cross
[16:04] and search that's a great lesson we can
[16:06] learn as we go through trials you know
[16:08] as Jesus went through his his death he
[16:10] had to keep his mind on something
[16:11] positive
[16:13] right that's what you've got to do when
[16:14] you go through difficult times you got
[16:16] to keep your mind on something positive
[16:19] and so the Bible tells us plainly Jesus
[16:21] died for the joy that was set before him
[16:23] amen the joy of knowing that because I'm
[16:26] going to die I'm going to bring millions
[16:29] of souls out of the heart of the earth
[16:30] up to heaven praise God
[16:32] and then I'm going to bring millions and
[16:34] many more I'm going to bring them up to
[16:36] heaven praise God I'm going to bring
[16:37] them uh uh I'm gonna I'm Gonna Save
[16:40] their souls and give them a future I'm
[16:42] going to give them Robes of light praise
[16:44] God I'm going to give them forgiveness
[16:45] of sins Hallelujah
[16:47] the church says we go through our
[16:48] difficult trials let's remember there's
[16:50] there's positive things that we must
[16:52] look forward to we might we must
[16:54] remember all these trials are working
[16:56] together for our good praise God
[16:58] Hallelujah remember for the joy that was
[17:01] set before Christ let's remember the joy
[17:02] that set before us praise God
[17:07] so the Bible says it's very rare for a
[17:09] righteous man to die but Jesus died
[17:11] while we were yet without without
[17:13] strength and let me say it like this as
[17:15] well I think I mentioned this last week
[17:18] you know in Hebrews 11 the Bible says
[17:20] many died that did not receive the
[17:22] promise I'm going to just read that so I
[17:24] don't mess it up
[17:26] in other words you know and I think it
[17:28] most applies to us where we would
[17:29] believe for our loved ones to be saved
[17:31] and uh you know
[17:34] and they might not get saved maybe
[17:36] during our lifetime if the Lord tarries
[17:37] if we don't live to see the Rapture
[17:39] maybe we wouldn't see our loved ones
[17:41] maybe be saved while we're alive
[17:44] but yet we should have hope even we
[17:47] should we should go to the Grave if God
[17:49] chooses us to go to the Grave we should
[17:51] go with hope knowing that God can save
[17:54] praise God
[17:55] Hallelujah
[17:57] verse 39 of Hebrews 11 39 and these all
[18:00] having obtained a good report through
[18:01] faith received not the promise of course
[18:04] the promise uh was the future home right
[18:06] was the what was a because the Bible
[18:08] said Abraham was seeking a city whose
[18:10] Builder and maker was God Amen Abraham
[18:13] knew there's a New Jerusalem there's a
[18:15] perfect City God's God city is coming
[18:17] somewhere praise God brother bear said
[18:20] it was right above him amen hallelujah
[18:21] and Jesus went to prepare that City
[18:24] Hallelujah
[18:26] but see these all died and they didn't
[18:27] have this Promise This Promise of a new
[18:30] city a New Jerusalem a new body
[18:32] verse 40 God having provided some better
[18:35] thing for us
[18:37] that they without us should not be made
[18:39] perfect so we have a better Covenant
[18:41] with better promises amen we have better
[18:44] benefits we live a better spiritual life
[18:46] because of the Cross praise God
[18:49] but also there will become a perfect
[18:51] City there come a new city a new home a
[18:54] future home praise God a beautiful land
[18:57] amen hallelujah there's coming a married
[18:59] land amen and that's where Abraham was
[19:02] seeking that's where Abraham's seed is
[19:04] seeking we're all seeking that Heavenly
[19:06] City praise God
[19:07] Hallelujah
[19:09] so this you know we take this
[19:12] uh we we
[19:13] take this encouragement here that that
[19:16] all these Old Testament Saints died not
[19:18] receiving the promise so if the Lord
[19:20] should allow us to die we should die
[19:22] still believing the promise of God
[19:25] still believing that all things are
[19:27] possible for God hallelujah
[19:30] in other words this caused us to never
[19:32] lose our hope
[19:33] as we read earlier in the chapter praise
[19:35] God
[19:37] can do all things praise God now verse 8
[19:40] but God commended that means to prove he
[19:44] proves his love toward us in that while
[19:47] we were yet sinners Christ died for us
[19:50] hallelujah so he proved his Love To Us
[19:53] by sending Jesus to the Cross to die for
[19:56] us while we were yet sinners and and
[19:58] church one way we can do that we can
[20:00] pray for people before they're
[20:02] Christians
[20:04] we can we can treat them good before
[20:06] they get saved
[20:08] we can love them before they're lovable
[20:11] right like a lot of our loved ones maybe
[20:14] aren't very loving they're not easy to
[20:17] be around and I guess we get to
[20:18] experience that pretty soon right
[20:19] Glory stop sorry I keep licking my
[20:22] fingers
[20:22] uh
[20:24] but that don't encourage us that Jesus
[20:27] died for us before we we loved him
[20:29] before we knew him but before we could
[20:31] appreciate him before we'd worship he
[20:33] died for us before we would return the
[20:36] love for him so that encourages us to
[20:38] love the unlovable it encourages us to
[20:41] be like Jesus Christ praise God
[20:43] hallelujah
[20:46] this is the love of God and I read this
[20:48] uh on Wednesday I'm sorry on Friday to
[20:51] The Junction City Saints Old Testament
[20:53] sacrifices could never take away sins
[20:56] and remember that's how it was you know
[20:58] for Abraham and Moses and Joseph all the
[21:01] Old Testament Saints their sins were
[21:03] never truly forgiven I'm going to read
[21:04] that just because I'm already there in
[21:05] Hebrews 11. so let me go to Hebrews 10
[21:08] 10.
[21:09] by the which will we are Sanctified that
[21:12] means purified Glory through the
[21:14] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[21:16] once and for all let me know you're pure
[21:18] today
[21:19] see in our minds we don't feel like
[21:21] we're pure but in God's eyes you are
[21:23] pure
[21:24] because the sacrifice died for you
[21:28] God in God's mind he's always looking at
[21:30] the sacrifice he's only your state is
[21:33] already forgiven because your sacrifice
[21:35] has already been sacrificed amen
[21:37] you're already pure that's what the
[21:40] Bible says
[21:41] through the offering of the body of
[21:42] Jesus Christ once for all praise God
[21:45] once for all amen once for all time
[21:48] Hallelujah verse 11 and every priest and
[21:50] a daily ministering and offering
[21:52] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[21:55] never take away sins
[21:57] now you know later some somewhere in
[21:59] this chapter I didn't have a chance to
[22:00] look it up
[22:02] but the Bible says they would they would
[22:04] leave off their animal sacrifices and
[22:06] they'd still feel like a sinner
[22:08] but the Bible says we can be different
[22:10] how many know what that feeling is like
[22:12] you walk into church you come to church
[22:14] discouraged but you walk out feeling
[22:16] Victorious amen
[22:17] or you're a sinner but then you get
[22:19] baptized and you repent and now you feel
[22:22] like a saint praise God
[22:23] the things of God have become alive to
[22:25] you the things of God are real amen
[22:27] hallelujah the word of God is yes and
[22:30] amen hallelujah
[22:32] and you know your sins are taken away
[22:34] praise God
[22:36] I felt that way on Wednesday night when
[22:37] Malachi was there after preaching that I
[22:40] was just weeping and crying seeing the
[22:41] people rejoice and I just thought I feel
[22:43] like I feel like a new Christian
[22:45] Hallelujah I know I'm forgiven amen
[22:48] hallelujah I know Christ has forgiven me
[22:50] praise God I know Jesus loves me I know
[22:53] he's purified me I know he's for me I
[22:55] know he died for me he already proved
[22:57] his love for me praise God
[22:59] and I want to I want to prove my love to
[23:01] him now Hallelujah
[23:04] so see it can never take away sins
[23:08] but Jesus died before we could
[23:11] appreciate his love and now church we
[23:13] spend the rest of our lives showing him
[23:15] how much we appreciate his love
[23:17] that's what we do Hallelujah
[23:20] now verse 9. I want to get into some of
[23:22] these uh important phrases in here
[23:25] much more than
[23:27] being now justified by his blood see so
[23:30] much more now
[23:31] because we're in the New Testament
[23:33] much more now being now justified by his
[23:38] blood we shall be saved from the Wrath
[23:41] through him
[23:43] so much more we have much more
[23:45] justification now in the New Testament
[23:48] right not not it's not saved by animal
[23:50] blood not covered by animal blood but
[23:52] the sin our sins are totally washed away
[23:56] sins are totally abolished through the
[23:57] blood of Jesus Christ much more
[24:00] and church now we're Justified fine this
[24:03] reminded me of now we're the sons of God
[24:05] in First John 3 verse 2. now we're God's
[24:09] children think about that right now
[24:10] you're a son or daughter of God
[24:13] you're a child of God
[24:16] God is your father amen
[24:19] that means he's going to bless you that
[24:20] means he's going to help you out praise
[24:22] God
[24:23] he's watching over you when did he not
[24:25] watch over you he's watching over you
[24:26] your whole life praise God
[24:28] he hovered over your over your body
[24:30] while he was forming you in your
[24:31] mother's womb praise God
[24:33] he was there at the beginning he's he's
[24:35] there now he'll forever be with you
[24:37] praise God
[24:39] you've oh like the Bible says you always
[24:42] were a Son of God you always were a
[24:45] daughter of God that's your identity
[24:46] praise God
[24:49] I'm not a I'm not an ohioan I'm I'm from
[24:52] Heaven praise God
[24:54] I hope I don't live in Ohio in the
[24:55] Millennium praise God I hope I live
[24:57] somewhere else praise God Amen I'm not
[24:59] in Ohio and I'm not just an American I'm
[25:01] a Child of God hallelujah I'm a
[25:04] Christian I'm a child of the king and
[25:06] right now I already am praise God
[25:08] so are you
[25:10] right now how through the blood
[25:13] amen through the sacrifice through the
[25:15] cross I'm Justified I'm declared
[25:18] righteous as I wish to be through his
[25:21] blood and I will not come into God's
[25:23] Wrath amen
[25:24] I won't live through the the trumpets I
[25:27] won't live through the woes praise God I
[25:29] won't live through the vows praise God
[25:31] I'm spared that God does not have wrath
[25:34] for me I have peace with God Amen
[25:37] through our Lord Jesus Christ because
[25:39] now I'm much more Justified now the
[25:42] Bible says and I'm now the child of God
[25:44] through the blood and now I'm totally
[25:46] passed from Death unto life amen oh
[25:50] Satan says you're oh you're you're going
[25:52] to be separated from God and God doesn't
[25:54] love you and and your your future is
[25:56] death and you can take John 5 24 and say
[25:59] Satan you're a liar I've already passed
[26:02] from Death unto life amen it's in the
[26:05] past amen it's not my future it's in the
[26:08] past I'm not going towards death I have
[26:11] eternal life praise God
[26:13] like brother said you take that
[26:15] scripture on Abraham stagger night he
[26:17] said you can stick down the devil's face
[26:18] 365 days out of the year
[26:21] so we should do that today right right
[26:24] devil I can I can tell the devil that
[26:26] I'm going to John 5 24. I'm going to
[26:27] tell the devil that right now
[26:31] you can join me if you want to turn
[26:32] there if not you can just say Amen
[26:34] John 5 24.
[26:40] Satan verily verily Jesus told us he
[26:43] that heareth my word and believeth on
[26:45] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[26:48] so Satan I believe in Jesus Christ
[26:51] Satan I've already got everlasting life
[26:55] Satan I shall not cut him into
[26:57] condemnation I've already passed from
[27:00] Death unto life
[27:02] there's that right in your face devil or
[27:04] maybe he's down there right in your face
[27:06] devil
[27:07] that's what the Bible says I believe it
[27:09] God said it that settles it praise God
[27:13] 's word cannot lie
[27:15] sometimes church I realize this just in
[27:18] my own life and I'm sure in your life
[27:19] too we just life gets so busy and so
[27:21] distracted like that's what the Junction
[27:23] City saints were telling me they're like
[27:24] wow it's been a busy week this Summer's
[27:26] been the busiest summer of my life I
[27:27] said you just said exactly what I'm
[27:29] going through it's been the busiest
[27:31] summer of my life it feels like
[27:33] and and they said uh we're glad we made
[27:35] the opportunity to be in the house of
[27:37] God you know we were tempted to kind of
[27:39] uh cancel the service but we rescheduled
[27:42] it to Friday night and there said they
[27:44] said we're really glad we did that I
[27:45] said it's the best thing you've done
[27:46] Amen to gather with God's people to
[27:49] worship God to feel his presence to feel
[27:52] his love to sit in Heavenly places what
[27:54] more could you what praise God
[27:56] it restores our faith restores our
[27:58] vision restores our joy Hallelujah
[28:02] in other words if if Farmers now think
[28:04] about that they're Farmers if Farmers
[28:06] feel more busy than ever before and yet
[28:07] we're not farmers
[28:09] right you would think oh farmers are
[28:10] real that's a real easy life not that
[28:12] it's not actually an easy life
[28:14] it's super busy life all right so we're
[28:16] super hard labor life a lot of hard work
[28:18] a lot of sweat a lot of long hours
[28:21] talk about 12-hour shifts
[28:23] they do that all the time
[28:25] but see if they're feeling busy we're
[28:28] we're feeling busy we're all feeling
[28:29] busy so we got to cut out more time to
[28:31] be in God's presence Hallelujah we've
[28:34] got to make time to be refreshed how
[28:36] many believe that
[28:37] let's make time to be refreshed make
[28:40] time to Worship the Lord like we're
[28:41] doing now praise the Lord amen because
[28:44] now we're Justified and much more much
[28:47] more praise God in the New Testament are
[28:49] we Justified much more are we Justified
[28:51] now praise God
[28:53] and much more will be saved from the
[28:55] Wrath through Christ
[28:58] now church we don't have to worry about
[28:59] am I good enough to escape the
[29:01] tribulation it's not based upon your
[29:03] works
[29:04] you're not saved through your Works
[29:06] you're saved through him
[29:10] am I good enough to to to overcome the
[29:14] mark of the beast it's not abased upon
[29:16] you it's based upon Christ amen
[29:19] you escape the wrath through him praise
[29:21] God Amen
[29:23] amen that's how I'm escaping it you just
[29:25] got a picture you know if the
[29:27] tribulation is all before us if the
[29:29] tribulation is before us you know we got
[29:30] to look at the reason I'm getting out is
[29:32] because I can I have an exit I can exit
[29:34] I use this door all the time but I can
[29:36] actually I have a I can exit the
[29:37] tribulation through Christ Christ is the
[29:40] door
[29:42] and all you got to do is walk through
[29:43] the door it's through Christ I'll be
[29:46] saved it's through Christ I'll have
[29:47] mercy it's through Christ I'll be
[29:50] purified amen
[29:51] amen it's all through Christ and this is
[29:53] remember this is how Paul is trying to
[29:55] get Gentiles and Jews to all be United
[29:59] trust in Christ
[30:02] trust in Christ much more
[30:05] we're now justified by the blood we're
[30:07] now Sons and Daughters of God
[30:10] Hallelujah
[30:12] I wanna I love I read this this morning
[30:14] I thought it was so beautiful from
[30:15] Albert Barnes the late preacher much
[30:18] more than being now justified by his
[30:19] blood we should be saved from wrath
[30:21] through him he says it is much more
[30:23] reasonable to expect it in other words
[30:24] we should
[30:25] we should expect God's mercy even more
[30:28] in the New Testament
[30:29] think about the mercy God had in the Old
[30:31] Testament
[30:32] a Moses a murderer
[30:34] you know he didn't circumcise his
[30:35] children you know look he smote the rock
[30:38] all these things Moses did and yet he
[30:40] had Grace think of Samson that's think
[30:43] of Samson my goodness mistake after
[30:46] mistake after mistake
[30:47] after mistake
[30:49] you know blatant Disobedience to God's
[30:51] word yet God had God still spoke to him
[30:54] God had mercy on him and God helped him
[30:56] overcome and God helped them accomplish
[30:58] his purpose in the very last Act of his
[31:00] life amen
[31:02] Church God's Gonna help you accomplish
[31:05] your purpose amen you can't miss it
[31:07] because God's fighting for you praise
[31:09] God
[31:10] you can't miss it
[31:12] yet God had mercy on Samson amen
[31:15] amen God will have mercy on you but much
[31:17] more praise God that's what the Bible
[31:19] says much more in the New Testament
[31:21] praise God
[31:23] it's more reasonable to expect it
[31:26] if when we were enemies now think when
[31:28] you were an enemy Jesus overcame all
[31:30] that was in the way of your salvation
[31:32] think about that
[31:33] your denomination for me the
[31:35] denominations were in my way to be saved
[31:38] right all my Temptations all my
[31:41] selfishness All My Pride think of all
[31:43] the obstacles think of it like all the
[31:46] all the mountains that were in the way
[31:48] of salvation
[31:49] but Jesus overcame all that praise God
[31:52] to save me
[31:54] he said how much more have we reasoned
[31:56] to expect that he will afford us
[31:59] protection now that we're his friends
[32:02] amen if he loved us while we were
[32:04] enemies and we were fighting against him
[32:06] and he still showed his love to us how
[32:08] much more will he give us favor now that
[32:10] we're fighting for him praise God
[32:12] now that we're the friends of God we're
[32:14] the sons of God how much more can we
[32:16] expect his grace and his favor and His
[32:18] blessings now that we're the family of
[32:20] God Amen
[32:22] amen
[32:23] this is amazing much more we should
[32:25] expect it
[32:27] Hallelujah
[32:29] hallelujah praise God
[32:32] I see that church don't you see that you
[32:34] know thinking about Samson don't you see
[32:36] that in your life
[32:37] Samson made all these mistakes but don't
[32:39] you see God keeping you from mistakes
[32:41] don't you see that
[32:43] You know despite our Temptations and our
[32:45] trials it seems like God steps in before
[32:47] we make an awful mistake
[32:50] before we do something really bad it's
[32:52] like God steps in and said no child I'm
[32:54] protecting you from this
[32:57] don't go there
[33:00] God watches over us so well
[33:03] so well I'll just tell this testimony
[33:05] you know we're at that house there you
[33:07] know about Genevieve
[33:09] uh we just got done seeing Moses the
[33:11] night before and the girls want to jump
[33:13] in the hot tub you know I got their
[33:14] modest swim wear on you know and
[33:15] everything
[33:16] and I just felt compelled to stand right
[33:18] there by the
[33:20] by the hot tub I don't know why you know
[33:22] normally I might have just jumped on my
[33:23] computer and said okay I'm watching you
[33:25] I'm a study
[33:27] I just felt compelled I was holding you
[33:29] know I was holding uh Zion
[33:32] and then Genevieve you know was on the
[33:34] corner
[33:34] and Genevieve you know kind of she
[33:37] either slipped off or stepped off into
[33:38] the deep and she started sinking and all
[33:41] the other girls were looking away they
[33:42] were playing which is okay but I was
[33:43] right there
[33:44] I had Zion so I it was a far reach so
[33:48] all I could grab was Genevieve's
[33:49] ponytail and I pulled her up and I said
[33:51] Haven grab her and Haven turns around
[33:54] like lightning shoes she lifted Jenny
[33:56] right up by the water
[33:59] amen a church
[34:01] God guided that that was God's kindness
[34:04] to us
[34:06] that's God's kindness and it reminded me
[34:07] of when God saved me from drowning I was
[34:10] a young boy
[34:11] I talked to my cousin about it he said
[34:12] he said I just looked down he said I
[34:14] feel like I got to help out Jesse and he
[34:15] pulled me up out of the water I was
[34:16] drowning I know I was drowning I was
[34:18] dead I was gone but God reached his hand
[34:21] down for me
[34:22] just one more expression of how much
[34:24] more God's love will favor us
[34:28] how much more God will he's watching us
[34:30] praise God
[34:32] he's just he's so he's so near to us
[34:35] Hallelujah
[34:36] so I just like this because he says we
[34:39] should expect more protection we should
[34:43] expect great things we should expect
[34:45] God's favor for our future praise God
[34:48] because we follow Christ and we're his
[34:50] friends we're no longer his enemies
[34:52] we're his friends
[34:53] hallelujah praise God Amen I want to go
[34:56] now I want to just I just wanted to show
[34:58] in these two verses twice Paul says it
[35:02] so Christ is so much more than what we
[35:05] think he is praise God
[35:07] we have so much more blessings than what
[35:09] we actually realize
[35:11] Glory praise God we I mean we appreciate
[35:13] the Old Testament Saints and my
[35:15] testimony will never scratch this
[35:16] surface to their testimonies but we have
[35:19] access to Greater Mercy we have access
[35:21] to Greater favor and protection because
[35:23] it's a better Covenant praise God
[35:26] we can walk away forgiven of sins we can
[35:28] walk away feeling redeemed praise God we
[35:31] can walk away with the joy of the Lord
[35:33] amen praise God
[35:35] we can walk away knowing God protecting
[35:37] us from our worst failures praise God
[35:40] the scar he kept us from scars in our
[35:42] lives that might have stained our lives
[35:44] but because of the blood of Christ
[35:46] because we're under a better Covenant we
[35:48] can walk in the victory of Christ
[35:49] Hallelujah
[35:52] so much more we're Justified much more
[35:54] we're saved much more
[35:57] for if when we were enemies we were
[35:59] reconciled to God by the death of his
[36:01] son much more being reconciled or
[36:04] returned to favor we shall be saved by
[36:07] his life
[36:08] Much More Much More shall we be saved
[36:12] Hallelujah
[36:14] if the cross reconciled us how much more
[36:16] will we be saved by his life in our
[36:19] lives amen Glory
[36:22] Hallelujah
[36:24] verse 11.
[36:25] and not only so but we also joy in God
[36:29] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[36:31] by whom we've now received the atonement
[36:34] again I want to emphasize that now much
[36:36] more and now we have more blessings than
[36:39] we realize and we got it right now
[36:42] I got it today praise God Amen I got it
[36:46] right now I'm not hoping for it I
[36:48] already got it praise God
[36:50] what Satan does is distract us from
[36:52] realizing what we got praise God
[36:54] amen hallelujah we got the whole armor
[36:56] of God we got the sword of the spirit we
[36:58] have the word of God we have the
[36:59] revelation of the word of God we have
[37:01] the the message of the hour we have all
[37:03] these blessings Satan's trying to
[37:04] distract us let's get our eyes focused
[37:06] on what we have right now praise God
[37:09] I've got it now Hallelujah
[37:13] so we have much more reason to believe
[37:15] this makes us joyful if we don't have
[37:18] joy let's pray for it like David did
[37:20] restore the joy of my salvation
[37:22] and I found that too Church the only
[37:24] time we don't I'm lacking Joys when I'm
[37:26] battling sin
[37:28] right or I haven't really confessed my
[37:30] sin or really overcome the sin that's
[37:32] the only time I'm lacking Joy most of
[37:34] the time I got a lot of Joy though right
[37:36] a lot of time I have joy God wants us
[37:39] all to have joy so the way to have Joys
[37:41] confess our sins praise God say God
[37:45] restore my walk Lord restore my
[37:47] confidence restore the sweetness of
[37:49] Fellowship uh restore my time with you
[37:51] uh bring it back I want to have joy
[37:54] praise God
[37:55] we now have the atonement as well
[37:58] we have now received the atonement I
[38:01] think I got the definition of the
[38:02] atonement what have we received now
[38:03] we've received the atonement we've
[38:05] received an exchange
[38:09] in other words we've traded all of our
[38:11] sins
[38:12] for Jesus's righteousness
[38:14] we've now received it
[38:16] so don't let the devil try to tell you
[38:18] all these sins you got to pay for these
[38:20] sins you don't have to you've already
[38:21] made the exchange
[38:23] the devil said remember what you did
[38:25] last time remember what you did last
[38:26] week remember what you did last year
[38:28] devil I've already exchanged him
[38:31] I got the atonement now amen I've got
[38:34] God's favor now the devil says God don't
[38:37] favor you God don't care you can say the
[38:40] Bible says I've got God's favor now
[38:42] praise God
[38:43] it's not coming it's already here amen
[38:46] praise God Amen it's already here I see
[38:50] it I know it I feel it it's the word of
[38:52] God it cannot lie it's true praise God
[38:55] I've already got the atonement praise
[38:57] God
[38:58] what do you have Rogers what do you have
[39:00] saints I have the restoration of God's
[39:02] favor
[39:03] because I've repented and put my trust
[39:05] in this in the sacrificial death of
[39:08] Jesus Christ
[39:10] I've already done the exchange right the
[39:13] Bible says we already have received the
[39:15] exchange I've already got his
[39:17] righteousness God already sees me as a
[39:20] forgiven child of God
[39:22] God already sees me in my glorified
[39:24] State amen that that's in the same book
[39:27] in Romans 8 the Bible said he that God's
[39:29] called he's already Justified and he
[39:32] that God's Justified he's already
[39:33] glorified
[39:35] he's already got a glorified body for us
[39:37] Saints amen we already got a perfect
[39:39] body we're already pure in his sight we
[39:42] are now the Sons and Daughters of God
[39:44] now praise God
[39:46] Hallelujah because I've made the
[39:48] exchange I'm Trading My Sorrows for the
[39:51] joy of the Lord amen well I got some I
[39:53] don't sing that really good but I really
[39:54] like that song Amen Hallelujah I'm
[39:57] trading my songs for the joy of the Lord
[39:59] I'm trading my depression I'm trading my
[40:01] sickness I'm trading my fears I want
[40:04] Christ's love I want Christ
[40:05] righteousness and I got it right now
[40:07] praise God
[40:08] I can train it praise God
[40:10] I can exchange for the love of Jesus
[40:12] Christ
[40:13] oh what a blessing
[40:16] we know we don't have to let me say like
[40:18] this we don't have to live our lives
[40:19] without this Exchange
[40:22] Hallelujah we can live our lives with
[40:25] Christ's love and Christ's righteousness
[40:27] and all the fruits of the spirit and all
[40:30] the attributes of a Christian we can
[40:31] live our lives with that but we daily
[40:33] understand that we have the exchange
[40:36] oh thank you God
[40:38] so now we cross over that was verse 11.
[40:40] now we crossed over into the next
[40:42] section here
[40:43] we'll look at a crucifixion with Christ
[40:45] and the Believers walk in the Holy
[40:48] Spirit
[40:49] oh it's a beautiful section man this is
[40:51] just glorious
[40:53] now verse 12 wherefore as by one man sin
[40:57] entered into the world and death by sin
[41:00] that's Adam
[41:01] and so death passed upon all men for
[41:05] that all have sinned
[41:06] so one man's sin produced all this all
[41:09] sinners
[41:10] for until the law sin was in the world
[41:13] so until Moses
[41:15] but sin is not imputed where there is no
[41:18] law
[41:19] so before Moses wrote down all those
[41:21] laws
[41:22] the Believers might have been committing
[41:24] some of the sins but it wasn't imputed
[41:25] because it wasn't written down
[41:28] right
[41:30] nevertheless death Reign from Adam to
[41:33] Moses
[41:34] even when there was no law death still
[41:36] Reign because of Adam's sin
[41:38] even over them that had not sinned after
[41:40] the similitude of Adam's transgression
[41:42] who's the figure of him
[41:45] that was to come Hallelujah no
[41:49] I love this verse verse 15. but not as
[41:52] the offense so also is the free gift
[41:56] for through the offense of one many be
[41:59] dead so what Adam's one sin produced
[42:02] many deaths
[42:03] I love this Hallelujah much more there
[42:06] it is again much more so three times
[42:08] Paul is saying much more Christ has done
[42:11] so much more for us praise God
[42:13] we have more blessings more access more
[42:16] grace more purification more salvation
[42:18] more deliverance we have more of God's
[42:21] love Hallelujah
[42:23] much more the grace of God and the gift
[42:25] of Grace which is by one man Jesus
[42:28] Christ hath abounded unto many oh
[42:32] Hallelujah and then I preached on this I
[42:34] think last year or two years ago it's a
[42:36] free gift
[42:38] you didn't earn salvation you didn't
[42:40] earn eternal life you didn't earn the
[42:42] crown of Rewards or you didn't earn that
[42:44] it's a free gift praise God
[42:47] it's a free gift just by repenting and
[42:51] believing in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[42:54] I love how God works this out God says
[42:55] he lets one man's sin equal many deaths
[42:58] but then he does the opposite one man's
[43:01] obedience gives many the gift of eternal
[43:04] life the gift of Grace Hallelujah
[43:07] in other words God undo undoes what
[43:10] every man messes up
[43:13] God's the one who can turn things around
[43:15] amen Adam messing up so Jesus come
[43:18] around and I'll turn that around praise
[43:20] God isn't that just like Jesus will make
[43:22] a mistake but then Jesus will fix our
[43:24] mistake praise God hallelujah we'll do
[43:27] something wrong and Jesus will come
[43:29] around he'll make it right praise God
[43:32] we'll put ourselves in a bad situation
[43:34] Jesus will turn around he'll put us in a
[43:36] good situation praise God
[43:38] oh my that's what Jesus did with Adam's
[43:41] sin with Adam's failure he turned it
[43:44] around
[43:45] and of course God's God's Victory will
[43:47] be greater than man's sin
[43:49] man sin was awful produce all these
[43:51] deaths all these sins but how much more
[43:54] amen how much more will Jesus obedience
[43:57] produce eternal life amen oh my much
[44:01] more
[44:02] so I found this online I thought it was
[44:03] a pretty easy picture to understand some
[44:05] of these things
[44:07] it's just a contrast Christ is so much
[44:09] different from Adam Adam brought sin the
[44:12] world but Jesus gives the people victory
[44:14] over sin
[44:15] and I'm saying church we need to live
[44:17] our lives with victory over sin
[44:21] we don't have to say well someday you
[44:23] know someday when I get a new body then
[44:25] I won't have to battle this well
[44:27] that might be true in some little areas
[44:29] but we can still overcome lots of sins
[44:31] today praise God
[44:33] we can overcome and what Paul calls is
[44:35] Dominion we can overcome the Dominion of
[44:38] sin
[44:39] the slavery to sin
[44:42] that's what we're supposed to overcome
[44:43] we don't have to be slaves right we
[44:46] don't have to be slaves we want to be a
[44:48] slave to Jesus amen we want to be a
[44:50] prisoner of Christ the Bible says
[44:52] hallelujah
[44:53] we should have victory over sin in our
[44:56] lives now Hallelujah
[44:59] that's right
[45:00] now because of Adam many men die because
[45:03] of his sin but many live because of
[45:05] Jesus Grace
[45:07] Adam's sin results in many being
[45:09] condemned Jesus death results in many
[45:12] being justified
[45:14] Hallelujah
[45:16] Adam's Disobedience bring sin to many
[45:18] but Jesus obedience bring righteousness
[45:21] to many
[45:22] and Adam's sin Reigns in death but Jesus
[45:26] Grace Reigns to give us eternal life
[45:29] Hallelujah I love Paul's writings amen
[45:32] he's trying to show the contrast Adam
[45:35] did this but Christ did this
[45:37] think about that all the all the sins
[45:39] Adam all of our sins is really what Adam
[45:41] you know is this fault but because of
[45:43] Jesus because of what Jesus did all our
[45:46] Victory is Jesus righteousness praise
[45:48] God it's our benefit because what Jesus
[45:51] did praise God Jesus undoes he's the
[45:53] last Adam he undoes what the first Adam
[45:56] did
[45:57] oh it's beautiful
[45:59] a beautiful contrast there
[46:01] Hallelujah verse 16.
[46:05] and not as it was by one that sinned so
[46:08] is the gift for the Judgment was by one
[46:11] to condemnation Adam
[46:13] but the free gift is of many offenses
[46:17] unto justification
[46:20] so again this idea of free gift the
[46:21] second time free gift is in here
[46:24] Jesus is the free gift to us all
[46:26] salvation is a free gift
[46:29] you know as I was dealing with those
[46:31] other churches you know the Pennsylvania
[46:32] and the uh
[46:34] The Junction City there was a couple
[46:36] people that were struggling like this
[46:37] they're seeking the Holy Ghost and then
[46:39] they told me they're even struggling
[46:40] like am I even saved does God even love
[46:42] me again they're seeking the Holy Ghost
[46:45] well see that that that's a natural
[46:47] condemnation Satan's gonna put on you
[46:49] right because Satan knows we don't like
[46:51] to be patient
[46:53] we don't like to wait for our gifts
[46:56] right that's why when you're little you
[46:58] might have snuck under the Christmas
[46:59] tree and ripped open the gifts to see
[47:01] what was under there
[47:03] I know I did I'll just confess it right
[47:06] now
[47:08] but it's hard to be patient for free
[47:11] gifts
[47:12] but as the word of God went forth it
[47:15] became very clear God loves us
[47:18] and and it becomes clear like and I just
[47:21] use the example of a natural birth like
[47:23] as much as a woman you know a pregnant
[47:24] woman wants to have that baby at a
[47:26] certain time it's going to come when the
[47:27] baby's ready to come
[47:29] unless you got a C-section right unless
[47:32] there's an emergency or something like
[47:33] that
[47:33] but you can wait and sometimes they come
[47:35] early before you're ready for them
[47:38] right sometimes you got to wait a little
[47:40] long afterwards
[47:42] but it's coming
[47:43] and that's what God wants to teach us
[47:45] the new birth is coming praise God
[47:48] amen hallelujah the new Earth is coming
[47:50] amen the Rapture is coming praise God
[47:53] the body changes come and praise God
[47:55] it's going to happen God wants us to be
[47:58] patient praise God and it's a free gift
[48:01] Hallelujah
[48:03] salvation is a free gift and the Bible
[48:05] even calls the baptism the Holy Ghost is
[48:07] a gift
[48:08] because what do you have to do you just
[48:09] have to keep walking to the promised
[48:11] land
[48:12] that's all Moses and the children of
[48:14] Israel all they had to do was keep
[48:16] walking
[48:17] in this in the right direction right
[48:18] amen
[48:20] right all they do is just keep walking
[48:22] church just keep walking towards the
[48:24] Holy Ghost just keep walking toward any
[48:26] promise of God
[48:28] all right see that just don't go in a
[48:30] circle like Israel did Israel just went
[48:32] around the Wilderness over and over
[48:34] again I'm just no notice Church they
[48:37] were circling their problems right they
[48:38] just circled it they just went around I
[48:40] just they never moved on from this issue
[48:42] or this problem in their life we got to
[48:44] move on from issues in our lives
[48:47] we got to move and and stop circling
[48:50] that stop spending your time going
[48:51] around this and spend your time moving
[48:53] forward in Christ Jesus amen
[48:56] spend your time thanking God and and
[48:59] blessing His holy name because it's
[49:01] through Christ you'll inherit every
[49:03] promise of God
[49:06] thank God Amen
[49:08] how many love the Lord today praise God
[49:10] that's my little reset there now
[49:13] let me finish this up by God's grace
[49:16] Hallelujah we got maybe a little a
[49:19] little bit more ways to go here I'm
[49:20] going to inject this just a fresh
[49:22] scripture in here I haven't preached on
[49:23] maybe in a while
[49:26] so through Christ one obedience all are
[49:30] Justified from their many offenses who
[49:33] accept the gift
[49:35] so just like Adam's one sin brought many
[49:38] offenses Jesus is one obedience brought
[49:41] many justifications
[49:44] so sin is a perversion right Adam is a
[49:46] perversion so the real thing has to be
[49:49] even greater than atoms
[49:51] glory amen the real thing think about
[49:54] all the sins in this world think about
[49:57] all the deaths that Adam caused
[49:59] you could put even there too right they
[50:01] both had to part in it
[50:03] think about all the deaths and sins well
[50:05] how much greater is Jesus obedience
[50:08] praise God
[50:09] right hallelujah how much greater Jesus
[50:11] obedience going to produce years and
[50:13] years and ages that will live it and
[50:16] church uh you know these sins will have
[50:18] an end death has an end but eternal life
[50:20] has no end praise God that's how great
[50:23] The Obedience of one was Hallelujah
[50:25] there's no end of blessings there's no
[50:27] end to eternal life it keeps rolling on
[50:30] over and over again and unending it's an
[50:33] infinite expression of God's love
[50:35] through Jesus Christ praise God
[50:38] all these sins will have an end they'll
[50:40] finally be swallowed up in life
[50:42] Hallelujah
[50:44] but our Joys will never end
[50:47] oh thank God that's why we join now in
[50:51] Christ Jesus
[50:53] Hallelujah
[50:55] thank God thank God amen hallelujah
[50:58] thank you Jesus
[51:00] it's a free gift and you just have to
[51:02] accept the gift
[51:04] just have to accept it
[51:06] Hallelujah verse 17.
[51:09] for by one man's offense
[51:12] Adam death reigned by one
[51:16] much more they which receive abundance
[51:18] of Grace and of the gift of
[51:20] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[51:22] Jesus Christ
[51:24] so here's what we see one offense death
[51:27] Reigns and look it's still raining today
[51:30] because of Adam and Eve sin
[51:32] but Jesus won obedience life has now
[51:35] reigned for two thousand years
[51:37] and then it's going to rain for a
[51:39] thousand years without sin praise God
[51:42] praise God and then it's going to rain
[51:44] for unending ages and cycles of Eternity
[51:47] where there is no end of life eternal
[51:50] life reigning for all eternity praise
[51:52] God I don't have any other words for it
[51:54] praise God
[51:55] it's infinite it's Eternal unending
[51:57] praise God
[51:59] so see church we Reign through Jesus
[52:03] Philippians 4 13 says I can do all
[52:06] things through Christ
[52:08] who strengthens me
[52:10] and then Nehemiah 8 10 the joy of the
[52:13] Lord is my strength
[52:17] now whatever you're facing day think
[52:19] about that and say I can do all things
[52:21] through Christ
[52:24] I can face this trial through Christ
[52:28] I don't have to quit I don't have to
[52:30] compromise enough to give up I don't
[52:31] have to walk away I can do all things
[52:33] through Christ
[52:35] because he strengthens me
[52:37] can you do it
[52:39] yes can I do it yes
[52:41] I can do all things
[52:43] like I always use that one people say
[52:45] why I can't have any children because
[52:46] they're going to grow up in such a
[52:47] filthy world no you can you can do all
[52:49] things through Christ
[52:52] I can't have children you can
[52:54] you can do all things through Christ who
[52:56] strengthens us
[52:57] right all right like I've heard people
[53:00] say I can never go and make it right
[53:01] with that person they hurt me too much
[53:02] well yes you can you can do all things
[53:04] through Christ
[53:06] right I mean that's the word of God
[53:08] praise God
[53:11] like where's the word of God when you
[53:13] need it right there right there's the
[53:14] word of God that you need
[53:16] you can do all things through Christ who
[53:18] strengthens you
[53:20] and then the joy of the Lord is your
[53:22] strength
[53:23] so true in the moment if you get your
[53:26] Bibles handy and the moment we're gonna
[53:27] look at Nehemiah here in just a moment
[53:29] I want to move into this thought here I
[53:31] want to finish with this thought maybe
[53:32] I'll set a timer here 15 minutes we'll
[53:34] see kind of how it goes it may go longer
[53:36] it's we only have one service today
[53:38] so I want to read this quote from
[53:40] brother Brandon I'm a very familiar
[53:41] quote uh maybe for me I'm not sure how
[53:42] much you've read the church age book but
[53:44] brother man reads Revelation 1 verse six
[53:46] now remember in in Romans 5 we just said
[53:49] we reign in life through Christ
[53:51] and now he says uh John says and he hath
[53:55] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[53:57] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[53:59] forever and ever amen brother man says
[54:01] he hath made us oh there are certain
[54:03] truths we need to emphasize
[54:06] that's why I'm preaching it again I need
[54:08] to emphasize this
[54:10] I need to make this stronger amen I need
[54:13] to make this more clear God made you a
[54:15] king God made you a priest I want to
[54:18] emphasize that today praise God
[54:21] he didn't make you a slave to sin he
[54:23] made you a king over sin praise God
[54:25] hallelujah
[54:28] he didn't make you someone with no power
[54:30] to intercede he made you a priest he
[54:32] didn't cut you off from the Throne of
[54:33] God he brought you invited you to the
[54:36] throne of God
[54:38] remember the priests in the Old
[54:39] Testament they had access to God you are
[54:42] someone that has access to God God's not
[54:46] avoiding your prayers God's inviting you
[54:48] to pray to him praise God
[54:50] we must emphasize this praise God
[54:55] because many times churches there's just
[54:56] no simple humble prayers that's where we
[54:58] find God answer them
[55:00] just in simple just taking a few moments
[55:02] out to pray to God
[55:04] and ask him to be gracious that's where
[55:06] we find him many times in the simple
[55:09] the simple uh the simple calling the
[55:12] simple priesthood of Prayer
[55:14] we find him in those moments where we
[55:16] just humble ourselves and stop and pray
[55:19] oh there's certain truths we need to
[55:21] emphasize this is one of them he
[55:24] he hath made us Jesus Jesus made us
[55:28] salvation is his doing salvation is of
[55:31] the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for
[55:33] a purpose
[55:34] that's why I love Esther Mordecai said
[55:37] don't you know you've been brought to
[55:39] the throne for such a time as this
[55:41] and church don't you know this is your
[55:43] time to be a king and priest
[55:46] it's your time right now
[55:48] now's the time for us to rule over sin
[55:51] now's the time for us to intercede for
[55:53] other people praise God it's for such a
[55:55] time as this God wants to use us now
[55:58] praise God now the work now how much
[56:02] more does God want to use us now praise
[56:04] God
[56:06] hmm
[56:08] that's what I'm finding you know as I
[56:09] preach those different places I'm
[56:10] getting these more open doors and
[56:12] imitations I'm seeing God wants to use
[56:14] me now
[56:15] but I got to be willing to lose some
[56:17] sleep
[56:19] that's what I've lost a lot of sleep
[56:21] driving extra miles and everything
[56:24] and being up late nights I don't like
[56:26] staying up late nights but God's asking
[56:27] me to serve him now
[56:32] it's for a purpose
[56:35] and the brother oh yeah I only want to
[56:36] share this to brother brother Irvin down
[56:37] there in Junction City he got up after
[56:39] that Holy Ghost sermon he just started
[56:40] crying he said God loves us so much to
[56:43] give us the truth like this
[56:45] he said we could be in denomination he
[56:47] said we were in denomination he said we
[56:48] could be deceived he said but look we
[56:51] have God's word and we have the
[56:52] revelation of this hour
[56:55] it makes grown men cry

[1:04:28] see it's your
[1:04:30] let's spend our lives as an offering to
[1:04:33] god let's spend your whole life is just
[1:04:35] worshiping God
[1:04:37] your whole life is worshiping in spirit
[1:04:39] and Truth your whole life is praying and
[1:04:42] making your petitions known unto God
[1:04:46] and church we should be able to say to
[1:04:47] God honestly that's enough for me
[1:04:50] if I'm not the most popular preacher if
[1:04:52] I'm if I'm not the most popular song
[1:04:54] leader if I have nothing of that my life
[1:04:57] would be worth it just to sing your
[1:04:59] praises and pray
[1:05:01] it'd be worth it praise God
[1:05:04] it's worth it
[1:05:06] it's a blessing remember David said he
[1:05:08] ran for he lived in tents and caves for
[1:05:10] 13 years and then he said betters one
[1:05:13] day in your courts than a thousand
[1:05:15] elsewhere praise God Amen
[1:05:17] I'd rather dwell in the house of God
[1:05:19] than dwell the tents of the wicked
[1:05:22] he realized this life is the best life
[1:05:26] we're living our best life now
[1:05:29] that's jealousy's book now it's a it's a
[1:05:32] Prosperity book so we don't read the
[1:05:33] book
[1:05:34] but we're living our best spiritual life
[1:05:36] now by God's grace that we're going to
[1:05:38] live until we get a new body Hallelujah
[1:05:43] we're Kings and Priests unto God no
[1:05:45] wonder the world does not appeal to us
[1:05:47] and we're peculiar people zealous unto
[1:05:50] good works
[1:05:51] my goodness
[1:05:53] it doesn't appeal to us their lives that
[1:05:56] doesn't is that there's nothing about
[1:05:58] that that makes me oh I want to be like
[1:05:59] that sinner there's nothing in my heart
[1:06:01] that wants to be like them
[1:06:03] I just want to be what Jesus made me to
[1:06:05] be
[1:06:06] and I'm going to be happy with that
[1:06:08] praise God I'm happy with that
[1:06:11] their life their lifestyle doesn't
[1:06:13] appeal to me I don't care if they get a
[1:06:15] vacation every uh every month they get a
[1:06:17] vacation that life doesn't appeal to me
[1:06:19] because what do they do they go waste
[1:06:20] their time and they got to end their day
[1:06:22] every day with some with some alcohol or
[1:06:25] champagne I was going to say they got to
[1:06:26] drown out their sorrows and regrets like
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:29] I don't want to live like that I don't
[1:06:31] live a life with no regrets praise God
[1:06:34] that's why this this is why we got to
[1:06:35] emphasize this because it reminds us our
[1:06:38] lives are worth it just by worshiping
[1:06:40] praying serving God hearing the word
[1:06:42] it's all worth it because that's what
[1:06:44] God called us to do amen that's what he
[1:06:47] wants us to be Kings and Priests
[1:06:49] Hallelujah
[1:06:52] we have been recreated
[1:06:55] in him to be children like unto our
[1:06:58] father
[1:06:59] that's what I want you to have church I
[1:07:01] want everyone to have that today every
[1:07:02] day realize I'm a New Creation in Christ
[1:07:05] let's remember what Christ has called us
[1:07:08] to be
[1:07:09] new creatures
[1:07:11] different person than what we used to be
[1:07:13] praise God
[1:07:18] now I just put this up here remember
[1:07:19] this is the Millennium scripture
[1:07:22] now look church if you can judge your
[1:07:24] life now the Bible said you're going to
[1:07:26] be on the throne and judgment's going to
[1:07:27] be given to you
[1:07:29] just like the queen of the South Jesus
[1:07:31] is going to say okay queen of South
[1:07:32] Lydia just stand up Jesus will say Lydia
[1:07:34] queen of South rise up
[1:07:37] and condemn this generation of Pharisees
[1:07:40] and now can you say that can you say I
[1:07:42] condemn you I condemn you Pharisees
[1:07:44] even with Grace
[1:07:46] thank you and you can take a seat
[1:07:48] that's what Jesus going to do he's going
[1:07:49] to say rise up you're going to condemn
[1:07:51] and it's going to be in your lips it's
[1:07:53] going to be in your your lips are going
[1:07:55] to speak the Judgment upon these things
[1:07:57] so you better know how to judge it right
[1:07:59] now
[1:07:59] right that's why we're here
[1:08:01] judgment begins at the house of God
[1:08:03] hallelujah
[1:08:05] if we can judge situations correctly now
[1:08:08] by God's grace we'll judge him perfectly
[1:08:09] there because we'll have a new body
[1:08:13] but notice the Bible says they lived and
[1:08:15] reigned with Christ for a thousand years
[1:08:16] if you can Reign now you'll Reign later
[1:08:18] what really Reigns over our lives it's
[1:08:20] the word of God
[1:08:22] it's the word of God and I'm trying to
[1:08:24] get somewhere here's the verse I want to
[1:08:25] bring out okay
[1:08:27] so I haven't preached on this for a
[1:08:28] while I don't maybe in the Mighty Man
[1:08:29] series
[1:08:31] but just remember this now this is a
[1:08:33] beautiful chapter this is right after
[1:08:34] Isaiah 53 and that's the chapter
[1:08:36] uh I won't play it at my funeral there's
[1:08:38] uh there's an hour
[1:08:40] if the Lord tears and I don't go in the
[1:08:41] Rapture Everybody Makes You Remember
[1:08:45] read Isaiah 53 at my funeral praise God
[1:08:48] I want everybody to know
[1:08:51] that Jesus Christ healed me praise God
[1:08:54] he was wounded for Jesse Smith's
[1:08:56] transgressions but with Jesus's Stripes
[1:08:58] Jesse Smith was healed amen praise God
[1:09:02] Hallelujah
[1:09:04] in the next chapter Isaiah talks about
[1:09:06] view the land married land how he's
[1:09:08] going to restore Israel back to the
[1:09:10] rightful position this is speaking of
[1:09:11] Israel but we can see how it applies to
[1:09:13] Christians too
[1:09:15] no weapon that's formed against thee
[1:09:17] shall prosper
[1:09:19] now that is quite a thus saith the Lord
[1:09:23] think about all the weapons in this
[1:09:25] world you got knives you got guns you
[1:09:27] got tanks you got planes he got all
[1:09:30] kinds of weapons people drug people to
[1:09:32] death you know they put
[1:09:33] drinks they put poison their drinks
[1:09:36] there's all kinds of weapons that are
[1:09:38] against us
[1:09:40] but God said no weapon
[1:09:44] that's formed against thee shall prosper
[1:09:48] that's a hundred percent Victory Church
[1:09:51] no well the most of the weapons won't
[1:09:56] Prosper that's not what he said
[1:09:58] he said there's no weapon that's formed
[1:10:02] against you that will prosper praise God
[1:10:05] oh my God
[1:10:07] that your guaranteed Victory praise God
[1:10:11] you're guaranteed there's no weapon
[1:10:13] there's no trick there's no snare
[1:10:15] there's no attack that will ever Prosper
[1:10:18] against you in other words every weapon
[1:10:20] against you will fail amen every trap
[1:10:22] Satan says for you you'll overcome it
[1:10:25] praise God
[1:10:27] this was the Israel what much more amen
[1:10:30] much more do we have better promises and
[1:10:33] greater blessings in the New Testament
[1:10:35] of the blood of Christ amen
[1:10:38] no weapon that's formed against you
[1:10:40] Austin will prosper
[1:10:42] I can put all your names there sisters
[1:10:45] there no weapon that's formed against
[1:10:47] you will ever prosper
[1:10:49] oh Satan roams the Earth trying to find
[1:10:53] somebody he can devour
[1:10:55] he's like how can I form a weapon
[1:10:57] against
[1:10:58] brother so and so sister so-and-so the
[1:11:00] Bible says that in job he roams the
[1:11:02] Earth thinking of ways and snares I can
[1:11:04] set this trap and each time he's going
[1:11:07] to fail
[1:11:08] amen no matter how much he brainstorms
[1:11:11] no matter how smart he thinks he gets he
[1:11:13] is he can't outsmart Christ Hallelujah
[1:11:17] because we have a promise there's no
[1:11:20] weapon will prosper against his children
[1:11:25] Glory that makes me feel happy today
[1:11:27] that was worth it coming to church right
[1:11:29] there wouldn't it
[1:11:30] no weapon Satan forms could ever Prosper
[1:11:34] against you
[1:11:35] in other words he's eventually going to
[1:11:37] run out of power
[1:11:38] he's eventually going to he's eventually
[1:11:40] going to quit and give up
[1:11:42] didn't the Bible say he left Jesus for a
[1:11:44] season
[1:11:46] trials May last for the night but joy

[1:12:13] Malachi
[1:12:15] in judgment
[1:12:17] Thou shalt condemn
[1:12:20] think about that
[1:12:22] there's going to be Devils trying to
[1:12:23] condemn us and the Bible said everyone
[1:12:26] will be silenced
[1:12:28] and will condemn them
[1:12:32] why because they're lying
[1:12:34] church just always believe the truth

[1:12:37] always speak the truth
[1:12:41] not most tongues against you sister who
[1:12:44] every tongue
[1:12:46] amen every tongue Karis
[1:12:51] anyone that tries to say anything
[1:12:53] and any weapon Satan tries to form
[1:12:56] against you it will fail
[1:12:59] God is totally protecting his children
[1:13:01] the great Shepherd protects his sheep
[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:05] they're defenses without him but with
[1:13:08] him they're more than conquerors
[1:13:09] Hallelujah
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:14] remember you've already passed from
[1:13:16] Death unto life
[1:13:17] there's no way I can die and go to hell
[1:13:19] I've already got eternal life
[1:13:21] I've already got everlasting life and it
[1:13:24] was freely given I didn't earn it it was
[1:13:26] through Christ
[1:13:28] this is the Heritage or this is the
[1:13:30] possession or inheritance that's what
[1:13:31] the word means this is the inheritance
[1:13:33] of the Servants of the Lord
[1:13:36] oh I get that just for being a child of
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:39] that's my inheritance
[1:13:41] Glory
[1:13:42] because I'm God's child no weapon will
[1:13:45] ever ever overcome me
[1:13:48] right and anyone who tries to condemn me
[1:13:50] I'll overcome them
[1:13:51] I'll silence them
[1:13:54] you're set up to succeed
[1:13:56] there's no way we can fail
[1:13:59] it's impossible to lose amen praise God
[1:14:04] remember if he's got weapons
[1:14:07] then don't forget he's not the only one
[1:14:10] with weapons
[1:14:11] you've got weapons praise God the Bible
[1:14:14] said we don't war after the flesh for
[1:14:17] the weapons of all Warfare are not
[1:14:19] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:14:22] pulling down of strongholds amen yes
[1:14:25] he's got weapons but I've got stronger
[1:14:28] weapons amen
[1:14:30] he's pretty big but I'm greater I'm
[1:14:33] greater by Christ than me because
[1:14:34] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:14:36] that's in the world praise God
[1:14:39] Hallelujah
[1:14:40] oh he looks pretty great the obstacle is
[1:14:42] pretty great but greater is Christ in me
[1:14:47] so no weapon will
[1:14:49] no weapon will prosper against me it
[1:14:51] won't work
[1:14:52] now God mail out like job God may allow
[1:14:54] you to suffer for months
[1:14:57] but it's ultimately going to end
[1:15:01] it's ultimately going to fail
[1:15:04] you're going to keep the faith
[1:15:07] you're going to keep God's word
[1:15:10] because what do you do with your weapons
[1:15:12] you cast down every stronghold you break
[1:15:14] down every complex
[1:15:17] you cast out any imagination like I
[1:15:20] think this is going to happen or I'm
[1:15:21] worried about that you cast that down
[1:15:23] with your weapons
[1:15:25] you break down anything any obstacle in
[1:15:29] your way you break it down so you can
[1:15:31] run the race
[1:15:33] Hallelujah
[1:15:35] anything that exalts itself against God
[1:15:37] you cast it down
[1:15:40] and then you have a Readiness to obey
[1:15:43] the Bible says when your obedience is
[1:15:45] fulfilled
[1:15:47] so see that's when you know you're using
[1:15:48] your weapons when you're obeying the
[1:15:50] word of God
[1:15:52] Hallelujah I love praying that sometimes
[1:15:54] I pray like that Lord I've had two weeks
[1:15:56] or I've had three weeks I've had a month
[1:15:57] of all these victories I've been obeying
[1:15:59] your word
[1:16:00] right because we all struggle with
[1:16:01] things I say and that just don't
[1:16:03] encourage me Lord you know Satan's
[1:16:05] trying to condemn me and make me feel
[1:16:06] bad but I'll say Lord look at this I got
[1:16:08] the victory praise God I know you're
[1:16:09] with me praise God I feel good no this
[1:16:12] weapon that's formed against me is not
[1:16:13] prospering but I'm prospering praise God
[1:16:16] such an encouragement I'm obeying
[1:16:19] Hallelujah and now God can fulfill his
[1:16:21] word in me because I'm obeying the word
[1:16:23] of God hallelujah
[1:16:26] oh thank you Jesus
[1:16:28] so let's just look at this simple
[1:16:29] examples now I've got your Bible go to
[1:16:31] Nehemiah chapter four I'm gonna just
[1:16:33] briefly go through these
[1:16:35] so in job's life could any weapon that
[1:16:38] was formed against job prosper
[1:16:41] no
[1:16:42] no
[1:16:43] these are some pretty powerful weapons
[1:16:44] though Church
[1:16:46] now don't forget your weapons are
[1:16:47] greater
[1:16:49] but one of the weapons was death of his
[1:16:51] children
[1:16:52] that was a weapon against job
[1:16:54] but it couldn't prosper
[1:16:57] and in this case prospering meant job
[1:16:59] would Curse God
[1:17:01] That's what Satan was trying to get him
[1:17:02] to do just Curse God
[1:17:04] but that weapon didn't work imagine just
[1:17:07] like job would imagine job just being
[1:17:09] his bombs are being thrown at him boom
[1:17:11] he just stands there
[1:17:12] boom Another bombing he's just stand
[1:17:14] there and all these weapons Satan's
[1:17:18] fighting shooting all these weapons out
[1:17:19] then he loses his finances then he loses
[1:17:22] his health all these weapons are coming
[1:17:24] against him but he still stands there
[1:17:25] and says I won't quit
[1:17:28] amen you won't Prosper against me I'll
[1:17:31] overcome you devil
[1:17:33] that's what he was doing no none of the
[1:17:35] weapons all these these are serious
[1:17:37] weapons but he realized I have a greater
[1:17:39] weapon his weapon was My Redeemer Lives
[1:17:41] I know my redeemer lives and I'll stand
[1:17:44] with him on that Earth praise God at the
[1:17:46] last day praise God in my flesh I shall
[1:17:49] see God that's his weapon I'm a Child of
[1:17:52] God God is my Lord I serve God and I'll
[1:17:55] see Christ amen
[1:17:57] oh
[1:17:59] some serious weapons
[1:18:03] some of us have to go through that
[1:18:04] losses family members
[1:18:06] loss of finances but you you have
[1:18:08] weapons to overcome them
[1:18:11] because you're going to reign in this
[1:18:13] life
[1:18:15] and that and then that will make you
[1:18:16] reign in the next life
[1:18:20] right Noah Satan used the weapons of
[1:18:23] mockery they mocked him for 120 years
[1:18:26] science mocked him
[1:18:28] right that was the weapons oh look
[1:18:30] scientifically this has never happened
[1:18:31] before it's never the rain doesn't come
[1:18:33] down rain comes up
[1:18:34] it's never happened before
[1:18:36] you're wasting your life
[1:18:40] you think you're uh some type of a boat
[1:18:42] man you never even sailed in a boat you
[1:18:44] know just mocking over and over again
[1:18:46] his goal was to destroy Noah
[1:18:49] but Noah overcame all those weapons
[1:18:52] couldn't overcome Noah
[1:18:54] because greater was he that was in Noah
[1:18:56] than he that was in the world
[1:18:59] praise God
[1:19:00] Joseph my there was a lot of weapons
[1:19:02] used against him he was rejected by his
[1:19:04] family now how many how many been
[1:19:06] rejected by their family that's a
[1:19:07] serious serious weapon
[1:19:09] serious
[1:19:12] bye he was enslaved he became a slave
[1:19:16] right he couldn't leave his work now we
[1:19:18] are happy we get to leave our workplace
[1:19:19] don't we
[1:19:21] at the end of the day I got to leave I
[1:19:22] got the clock out
[1:19:23] thank you guys
[1:19:25] see you tomorrow I'll see you after the
[1:19:27] weekend not not Joseph he was a slave
[1:19:31] the weapon look at that weapon constant
[1:19:33] slavery constant work no Escape I'm
[1:19:35] never going to be out of slavery
[1:19:37] but that weapon couldn't conquer God
[1:19:40] God was fighting for him praise God
[1:19:44] at the end of his life he forgives the
[1:19:46] brothers and said you know you didn't do
[1:19:47] this God allowed this so I could save
[1:19:49] lives amen hallelujah
[1:19:52] those weapons couldn't Prosper against
[1:19:54] even false accusations and even prison
[1:19:57] time two years of prison time couldn't
[1:19:59] conquer Joseph because a greater one was
[1:20:01] in Joseph Joseph knew the word of God
[1:20:03] has come to try me I'm just being tested
[1:20:05] but I will overcome praise God
[1:20:09] all those bombs of rejection and and
[1:20:11] accusations in prison he just stood
[1:20:13] there and he stood there he's able to
[1:20:15] stand against those and so I'm still
[1:20:17] fighting for God hallelujah
[1:20:19] I'm not giving up the fight I'm not
[1:20:21] laying down the sword I'm not going to
[1:20:22] quit now
[1:20:25] I'm more than a conqueror in Christ
[1:20:27] Jesus
[1:20:28] we got some of those today we got some
[1:20:30] more than conquers in here hallelujah
[1:20:34] see I didn't get to finish my thought
[1:20:35] because it kind of came to me freshly
[1:20:36] right before service
[1:20:39] but Moses Satan used the weapons of past
[1:20:41] failures he ran from his people for 40
[1:20:44] years he ran
[1:20:46] murder Satan whisper You're a murderer
[1:20:49] Satan actually moved him to murder
[1:20:52] think how awful that would be
[1:20:54] you've took someone's life
[1:20:56] church I would say like that you know
[1:20:58] when God lets us go to those types of
[1:21:00] deep sins like murder he has to give us
[1:21:02] a burning bush experience
[1:21:03] because of all of the awful things we've
[1:21:06] done
[1:21:07] like Paul Paul perfect example
[1:21:10] Paul sat there watched Stephen get
[1:21:11] murdered yes I'll hold your coat kill
[1:21:13] him he's bleeding he's dead yeah here's
[1:21:15] your goats guys
[1:21:16] he'd have to hear the voice of God to
[1:21:18] know he's forgiven
[1:21:21] he'd have to
[1:21:22] Now isn't that Grace
[1:21:24] and Paul said my life is a pattern for
[1:21:27] them that will believe thereafter amen
[1:21:29] amen so no matter what you've done
[1:21:31] you've got to trust God that the free
[1:21:33] gift cleanses you from all
[1:21:35] unrighteousness amen it's a free gift
[1:21:37] Hallelujah it helps you to reign in this
[1:21:39] life Hallelujah it translates you out of
[1:21:41] your own life into a new life praise God
[1:21:45] he overcame the complaining of the
[1:21:46] people that was a trap from Satan
[1:21:49] he overcame the rejection right
[1:21:53] the People speaking against him he
[1:21:54] overcame fear why God what do I do now
[1:21:57] he says why cry unto me speak and go
[1:21:59] forward
[1:22:00] there's no weapon
[1:22:03] that was formed against Moses that he
[1:22:05] couldn't overcome
[1:22:07] Hallelujah
[1:22:09] Mordecai you know that one right Haman
[1:22:10] he went about a Heyman went over this a
[1:22:12] few weeks ago he wouldn't bow he just
[1:22:14] everybody I think about that everybody
[1:22:15] else in the church would bow down to
[1:22:17] Haman everybody else
[1:22:19] now hopefully we got a church of
[1:22:20] Mordecai is here
[1:22:21] let's not bow to the world
[1:22:24] right let's not bow to peer pressure
[1:22:26] let's not bow to sin let's stand praise
[1:22:28] God
[1:22:29] and so Satan builds this weapon of a
[1:22:31] gather I'm going to hang you more to God
[1:22:33] I'm hanging you on this
[1:22:35] and yet he withstood it he just kept
[1:22:37] doing what's right all the time he no
[1:22:39] what'd he do also he got on his uh he
[1:22:41] got in prayer
[1:22:42] he got a sackcloth and Ashes he got that
[1:22:45] I started praying to God asking Esther
[1:22:47] to intercede he didn't sit there and do
[1:22:49] nothing he went into his office of a
[1:22:51] priest Hallelujah
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] and that weapon that was formed against
[1:22:56] him was ultimately used against the one
[1:22:58] who built it
[1:22:59] Haman Haman got what he deserved he reap
[1:23:02] what he sowed but so did Mordecai
[1:23:04] Mordecai saved the king so the king
[1:23:06] exalted him praise God
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:12] that's what we learned from these Old
[1:23:13] Testament Saints stand upon the word of
[1:23:15] God and God will fight for you
[1:23:18] any weapon Satan has uh thought against
[1:23:20] you it will not prosper
[1:23:23] think of Daniel they said the weapon of
[1:23:25] the the Lions
[1:23:27] but the Lions didn't conquer him praise
[1:23:29] God hallelujah those weapons couldn't
[1:23:32] overcome Daniel because Daniel had a
[1:23:35] relationship with God
[1:23:36] he prayed to God
[1:23:38] just like you got
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:43] well there's an hour and 15 here so
[1:23:46] let me go a little bit later
[1:23:48] now Nehemiah yeah Nehemiah chapter 4. I
[1:23:50] want you to see what Nehemiah overcame
[1:23:52] chapter 4 verse 1. Nehemiah 4 verse 1.
[1:23:55] you know the reason I'm reading this is
[1:23:57] because I just uh
[1:23:58] I'm almost finished with Nehemiah and
[1:24:00] I've just been freshly reminded of this
[1:24:05] remember Nehemiah
[1:24:07] cried before where he was sad before the
[1:24:09] I think it was Nebuchadnezzar not
[1:24:11] mistaken
[1:24:13] whichever Babylonian King it was and he
[1:24:15] said why are you so sad you've never
[1:24:16] been sat in my presence he said my
[1:24:18] people
[1:24:19] or without a temple and there's I'm
[1:24:20] sorry they have a temple but they have
[1:24:21] no wall and so the king pays for him
[1:24:24] gives him all this money all this all
[1:24:27] this protection to go back
[1:24:28] and he he rebuilds the wall in 52 days
[1:24:33] a church just just let that be an
[1:24:34] encouragement if you want victory over a
[1:24:36] certain sin let's give God how about we
[1:24:38] give God 30 days
[1:24:40] it don't have to be 52 days say Lord
[1:24:42] give me a victory this in this month
[1:24:44] July here we are July 2nd right you can
[1:24:45] say Lord yeah 30 30 more days left help
[1:24:48] me to consecrate on you and help me to
[1:24:50] build a life that's
[1:24:53] help me to build up a defense against
[1:24:55] this trial or this lust or this
[1:24:58] this temptation right
[1:25:00] right that's that's basically what he
[1:25:01] was doing he said I need 52 days and I'm
[1:25:04] going to build this wall up and now
[1:25:05] we're going to have protection
[1:25:08] that's why people like you know a 40-day
[1:25:10] fast or you know whatever seven day fast
[1:25:13] now
[1:25:14] not hurting yourself but people like to
[1:25:16] have a certain number of days because
[1:25:17] they know there's Victory and good
[1:25:18] habits
[1:25:21] but Nehemiah 4. but it came to pass that
[1:25:24] when sambal heard that we build the wall
[1:25:25] he was Roth and took great indignation
[1:25:27] to mock the Jews and he spake before his
[1:25:29] brother in the army of Samaria and said
[1:25:31] what do these feeble Jews
[1:25:33] will they fortify themselves will they
[1:25:35] sacrifice will they make an end in the
[1:25:38] day will they revive the stones out of
[1:25:39] the heaps of the rubbish which are
[1:25:41] burned and but now tobiah the ammonite
[1:25:44] was by him and he said even that which
[1:25:45] they built a fox go up he shall break
[1:25:47] down their stone wall look at this
[1:25:50] mocking
[1:25:51] he's mocking a child of God that's going
[1:25:54] to build a wall
[1:25:56] he says he calls him feeble that's not
[1:25:58] what the devil's calls you you're such a
[1:26:00] weak Christian
[1:26:01] you have no strength
[1:26:03] well you're lying again devil there you
[1:26:06] go lion again
[1:26:09] and look he had to overcome these
[1:26:11] weapons what were the weapons the war of
[1:26:12] words that's that's why I think we this
[1:26:14] applies to us we don't battle physical
[1:26:16] demons right we don't battle uh people
[1:26:19] that want to arrest us and shoot us and
[1:26:20] put us in prison or cut off our heads or
[1:26:22] something
[1:26:23] but it's war of words that we battle
[1:26:27] just like Nehemiah
[1:26:29] but Nehemiah he responded the right way
[1:26:31] praise God
[1:26:33] so what does he do in verse 4 hear o Our
[1:26:36] God for we are despised and turn their
[1:26:38] reproach upon their own head and give
[1:26:40] them for a prey in the land of captivity
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:43] so when he when he's called weak when
[1:26:45] he's when he's mocked and said oh even a
[1:26:48] fox will knock over your wall when he's
[1:26:49] mocked and made fun of what does he do
[1:26:51] he goes to prayer amen he goes to his
[1:26:54] duty as a priest Hallelujah he doesn't
[1:26:57] get weak he strengthens himself in the
[1:26:59] Lord praise God
[1:27:02] twins people speak against you what do
[1:27:04] you got to do pray for them
[1:27:10] now later on here
[1:27:13] I'm just for time's sake I'm just I'm
[1:27:15] just gonna read this enemies then
[1:27:17] threaten to attack so the People Prayed
[1:27:18] and then set up guards in verses 8
[1:27:20] through 15. then they send threats now
[1:27:22] you ever get a threat before
[1:27:24] I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do this
[1:27:26] to your name or I'm gonna make people
[1:27:28] say this about you I'm gonna do all
[1:27:29] these things threats threat threats and
[1:27:31] what does he do pray
[1:27:33] pray and then he sets up protection
[1:27:36] and brothers said prayer is our
[1:27:37] Garrison's so Garrison's our Lookouts
[1:27:40] right for enemies so when Nehemiah got
[1:27:43] threatened he set out Lookouts so when
[1:27:44] we get threatened we should look out
[1:27:46] through prayer Hallelujah
[1:27:48] more prayer
[1:27:49] more prayer
[1:27:53] he reminded the people to trust in God
[1:27:55] and he paired the soldiers so while one
[1:27:58] worked the other stood by
[1:28:00] and then he also set up a signal for a
[1:28:02] trumpet call they could rally together
[1:28:04] and trust God to fight for them
[1:28:06] Hallelujah so the more Satan attacked
[1:28:09] him with these weapons the more he set
[1:28:11] up we're going to work together as a

[1:28:50] draw him out of the city in chapters 6.
[1:28:54] yeah later on chapter six they say come
[1:28:56] come for a meeting over here and let's
[1:28:58] talk about this he said I'm not leaving
[1:29:00] this work
[1:29:01] I'm not leaving my post to duty and the
[1:29:03] church said
[1:29:05] I'm not leaving where God called me to
[1:29:07] be a priest and the King I'm standing
[1:29:09] right here
[1:29:10] you know what he says he says you
[1:29:11] weren't called to build this wall I was
[1:29:13] called to build this wall
[1:29:15] Hallelujah
[1:29:16] right let's not leave our post annuity
[1:29:18] let's say right where God called us to
[1:29:20] be let's remember where God called us
[1:29:22] lest not forsake God the Bible said when
[1:29:24] you leave the church you forsake you
[1:29:26] abandon the church

[1:29:30] say write the poster Duty let's not be

[1:29:34] praise God
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:42] all right
[1:29:46] Hallelujah
[1:29:48] and then they tried to then they just
[1:29:49] gave him threats but he overcame all
[1:29:51] their threats by just praying
[1:29:54] having a battle plan how many got a how
[1:29:56] many got a battle plan next time a
[1:29:57] Temptation comes
[1:30:00] I know for sure Haven has done that in
[1:30:02] her life
[1:30:03] like she she testified about you know
[1:30:04] having night fears she set up so many
[1:30:07] battle plans
[1:30:08] I just want to encourage her
[1:30:11] encourage my little soldier back there
[1:30:14] she'd first draw a picture with
[1:30:15] something that was a scripture she could
[1:30:17] look on and then she started memorizing
[1:30:19] the scriptures
[1:30:20] then she'd pray with me some nights or
[1:30:22] pray with Christian Some Nights
[1:30:24] amen set up battle plans if you want to
[1:30:27] overcome you got to have a plan praise
[1:30:29] God
[1:30:31] Hallelujah pretty soon you get the
[1:30:33] victory don't you Haven
[1:30:35] Hallelujah
[1:30:37] that's what Nehemiah did no weapon that
[1:30:39] was formed against him could Prosper
[1:30:41] Nehemiah overcame
[1:30:43] and you overcome in less than two months
[1:30:45] the church if we really get our we
[1:30:47] really get focused on something we can
[1:30:49] overcome
[1:30:50] but we got to get focused on it
[1:30:53] we've got to build up our strength got
[1:30:55] to build up our walls build up our
[1:30:57] protection build up our prayers
[1:31:00] Hallelujah
[1:31:03] I think uh
[1:31:05] yeah I was just going to close with
[1:31:06] those
[1:31:08] well let me just close with these last
[1:31:09] few
[1:31:10] Jesus
[1:31:12] the weapon that was formed against him
[1:31:14] was crucifixion I kind of already
[1:31:15] preached on this but what did he do he
[1:31:18] went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray
[1:31:20] he said father let your will be done not
[1:31:23] mine will be done
[1:31:25] that's how you overcome a weapon did you
[1:31:27] say God let your will be done amen don't
[1:31:31] let my will be done let your will be
[1:31:33] done
[1:31:34] in other words Lord give me the grace to
[1:31:36] go through this if you want me to go
[1:31:37] through this if you want me to suffer
[1:31:39] the uh the Pains of this weapon the
[1:31:41] enemy has against me then give me the
[1:31:43] grace to go through it praise God
[1:31:45] and I will
[1:31:47] I'll go through it
[1:31:49] let your will be done not my will but
[1:31:51] how do you do it by the joy one day
[1:31:53] we're gonna have a glorious Church
[1:31:54] Without spot or wrinkle
[1:31:57] or maybe you could say in 50 days we're
[1:31:59] gonna have a born-again church
[1:32:00] Hallelujah I see it praise God I've seen
[1:32:03] it in my vision praise God the Father
[1:32:05] showed it to me and he shall see his
[1:32:07] seed after him praise God and they'll
[1:32:10] possess the gates of their enemies
[1:32:11] praise God
[1:32:12] he suffered through the present in order
[1:32:14] because he knew there's a better future
[1:32:16] coming
[1:32:17] let's do that today by God's grace
[1:32:20] let's suffer through the present with
[1:32:22] our eyes on the future
[1:32:25] remembering you know it's got to be a
[1:32:26] good future it's got to be one God
[1:32:27] promised
[1:32:29] it's got to be the will of God
[1:32:30] hallelujah
[1:32:32] then you get the victory
[1:32:34] so church what do we got to overcome
[1:32:35] remember I'm closing
[1:32:37] you gotta in laodicea you gotta
[1:32:39] oftentimes overcome the pressure of
[1:32:41] riches
[1:32:43] soft living
[1:32:46] and nervous tensions
[1:32:48] you got to overcome those those are the
[1:32:50] three that we're gonna have to overcome
[1:32:51] the most but you can
[1:32:52] because there's no weapon
[1:32:55] right of a pressure to be wit uh
[1:32:57] pressure be rich there's no weapon
[1:32:59] that's a that's a rich or a million
[1:33:02] dollar Temptation or something that's
[1:33:03] never going to be able to conquer you
[1:33:06] and let me say this probably maybe more
[1:33:09] applicable for all of us nervousness
[1:33:11] there's no stress that's going to be
[1:33:13] able to ever Prosper against you
[1:33:17] Rachel have you ever felt stressed this
[1:33:19] week
[1:33:19] okay most people are honest
[1:33:22] that's a weapon that Satan has tried to
[1:33:24] form
[1:33:26] but you have thus saved the Lord no
[1:33:28] weapon will prosper against you
[1:33:32] that nervousness will not overcome you
[1:33:34] thank God amen amen
[1:33:38] amen because you have access
[1:33:40] the Bible says to a transformed mind
[1:33:43] you have access to power love and a
[1:33:47] sound mind
[1:33:49] how do you get that the Bible says
[1:33:50] Romans 12 present your body as a Living
[1:33:52] Sacrifice before God
[1:33:54] you have to talk to God just like
[1:33:56] Nehemiah you got to pray just like Jesus
[1:33:58] you got to pray just like Joseph you got
[1:34:00] to pray Hallelujah
[1:34:02] that will cause all those weapons to be
[1:34:05] defeated
[1:34:06] the simple prayers of the Saints
[1:34:09] or if you need prayer I'd be happy to
[1:34:10] pray with you today
[1:34:14] now maybe soft living
[1:34:16] see sometimes we make our lives so easy
[1:34:19] that we don't have to pray for certain
[1:34:21] things right like that's what the
[1:34:23] brothers always say when they come from
[1:34:24] overseas
[1:34:26] they say Americans hardly have to pray
[1:34:27] for food they already got to pray for
[1:34:28] anything
[1:34:31] and so then they pray less so they get
[1:34:33] less spiritual blessings
[1:34:35] but the Saints where they got to pray
[1:34:36] for food they also pray for miracles
[1:34:38] they also pray for healing because they
[1:34:39] don't have doctors so they get more
[1:34:40] miracles
[1:34:42] you see a correlation the more prayer
[1:34:43] more blessings
[1:34:47] but we still have the promise
[1:34:49] no weapon will prosper against us
[1:34:53] these are the these are the weapons that
[1:34:55] are formed against us Satan wants us to
[1:34:57] feel tempted and nervous to be rich
[1:34:59] nervous to have more Goods
[1:35:04] and he wants us to feel like you don't
[1:35:05] need more of God
[1:35:07] because you say oh I have need of
[1:35:08] nothing I don't have to go to church I
[1:35:09] have to read my Bible I have to pray
[1:35:10] that's a weapon that's formed against
[1:35:12] you
[1:35:14] but by God's grace church we will
[1:35:16] prosper
[1:35:18] because the Bible says above all things
[1:35:19] I wish you prosper in health even as
[1:35:22] your soul prospers
[1:35:24] that's the end of our feet musicians can
[1:35:26] come
[1:35:30] how many are thankful that you have a
[1:35:32] hundred percent chance to overcome the
[1:35:34] weapons
[1:35:35] of Satan
[1:35:36] you have a hundred percent promise there
[1:35:39] is no temptation
[1:35:41] there is no test
[1:35:43] that's formed against you that can
[1:35:45] defeat you
[1:35:46] that's why I say church I'm not ashamed
[1:35:48] to say it we already are an invincible
[1:35:50] Army
[1:35:52] I know the bride's going to be Heather
[1:35:53] ladder rain I know that I know she's
[1:35:55] going to be Invincible there but I'm
[1:35:56] already invincible
[1:35:58] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:36:00] he that's in the world praise God
[1:36:02] and I got the same promise Israel has
[1:36:05] that was to Israel but God had to put
[1:36:08] Israel away and get a new bride amen
[1:36:11] Hallelujah so this has to apply to us
[1:36:13] this is beauty of the land this is
[1:36:15] married life this is our married life
[1:36:17] Jesus is going to protect his bride
[1:36:19] Hallelujah
[1:36:23] be defeated
[1:36:25] any trial any test anytime Satan comes
[1:36:28] around like a roaring lion we've got the
[1:36:30] fire of the Holy
[1:36:32] turn that line back
[1:36:34] how do you believe that
[1:36:37] let's bow our heads now Church think
[1:36:38] about if there's weapons that are formed
[1:36:40] against you let's pray today
[1:36:41] that's all Nehemiah had to do
[1:36:43] that's all Jesus had to do any weapon
[1:36:45] that was formed against him he just had
[1:36:46] to pray and remember that God was
[1:36:48] fighting for him
[1:36:52] now we are the sons of God now we are
[1:36:56] the dogs
[1:36:58] and we have access into disgrace right
