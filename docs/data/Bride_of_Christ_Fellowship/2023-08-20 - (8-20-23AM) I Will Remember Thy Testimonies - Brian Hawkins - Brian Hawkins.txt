========================================
foreign [Music] others Thou Art calling Lord come and reach me too amen amen while we're in his presence amen good to see you sis how you doing doing good praise the Lord you keep having that positive confession amen so amen thank the Lord for being here and thank you musicians uh if you would um turn with me to Psalms 119. thank you and uh verse 129 . I told brother Jesse in the back there and I said well I was kind of looking at something yesterday and on the way here and I walked in the door and the Lord changed my mind so amen just want to be in that in the right Channel with the Lord amen so noticing that song that we're you know do not pass me by it's the humility when we can when we can come with that humility in our hearts amen that's that's where we can call upon the Lord starting in the 129th verse of Psalm 119 it says thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doth my soul keep them the entrance of thy words or Revelation the the revelation of thy words the entrance of thy words giveth light Hallelujah it giveth understanding unto the simple amen let's look to the Lord in prayer amen what I'd like to speak on this morning is I will not forget your testimonies most gracious Heavenly Father we just thank you so much for what you've done for us we thank you for giving us safe travels this morning just pray that you would bless the effort that's been made to be here this morning just as we come and administer your word we just pray that you would help us uh help us that you would give us strength that you would also give us understanding uh through the entrance of of your words into our ears for Faith cometh by hearing and by the hearing of your word father we just ask that you would help us spiritually natural natural in our natural bodies this morning as well father Yes and uh just ask that you would give us strength help us to see more of you and uh Lord we just pray that you would increase the desire more for you oh God we read into your scripture that the Deep calleth unto the Deep so Lord if we're if our soul is calling out for something that there is something more to be had oh God we know that you are inexhaustible the Lord we just call upon you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you would be with us here this morning bless each one that's made the effort to come and Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen amen amen we've been kind of struggling uh with sickness the past couple weeks no that the Lord will help us through if my voice gives out which I don't think it will well we'll keep going amen amen hopefully you can hear a whisper but we're not going to give up amen hallelujah so as we read there in uh at 1 30 the entrance of thy words talking about Revelation amen when we read the scripture uh some people just read the scripture and it's just words on the page uh so it might not mean something to to others where others that might be able to have that the others that have that light or the revelation how wonderful it is and the more that we could see God amen so the more we read in the words the more that we receive the word the more Revelation that we'll have and it even it says give it under understanding unto the simple and to the simple it means to the inexperienced or to the naive it can instruct them in their ways amen amen that they wouldn't be in that in in that condition anymore so thy testimonies are wonderful I love how uh it starts out there uh it's saying that that their thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doth my soul keep them see we love the Lord's word right see testimonies we we often think of testimonies of of something that's happened and I could testify because I saw something happen so therefore I could testify to the situation that I saw happen the testimonies here is talking about statutes and precepts so he's saying that thy statutes and nice thy precepts all these things that I'm reading here your law even so we know that the letter killeth right right and we live in Grace but Grace is developed through the law right yes because we couldn't fulfill the law so now we've therefore we've receive Grace because he knew that we couldn't uphold all the law because we're human beings we we fall short we fail all the time right so not one of us can live absolute the the law not one of us can live it right so we need that Grace so therefore he's saying thy testimonies are wonderful I love these things because it keeps me pure it's going to keep me unspotted from the things of the world it's going to keep me from sin because if I say that I fall short of thy testimony or if I fall short of thy law or thy statute or thy precept if I fall short of that I feel vexed of my soul because I know I did something wrong right so therefore I love it because it corrects me it shows me the right path Amen to my path right amen so thy testimonies are wonderful I love thy precepts because it gives me that instruction it tells me how to be righteous even though I fall short and I can't be that righteousness because our filthy or our righteousness is filthy rags right so therefore we love these precepts because it gives us that instruction remember I I spoke about phylacteries here uh several years ago about they were the Jews would wear the the leather box on their on their forehead and on their arm they would have it wrapped around with with scripture that would remind them because uh uh I think it was an exodus where it said write these down for your children to remind them to instruct them and forget not these precepts put them as frontlets put them always before your face amen as a reminder as a reminder to keep your feet steady as a reminder to keep steadfast for when we say that we we when we see that we have that fault and that failure we've reached out we call out to the Lord right Hallelujah and we ask them Lord forgive me yes amen amen so if you want to turn with me to First Peter chapter 4 and verse 12. it says beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice but rejoice in as much as your partakers of Christ's sufferings whoa wait a second how is it that I'm gonna partake and be a partaker of Christ's sufferings through persecution through living through through living this word people are going to look at you as an odd type of person you're gonna you're gonna look uh a little bit weird to the rest of the world right so as you continue on you are a partaker with Christ in his sufferings right so but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceeding Joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified amen amen see that's the separation of the serpent seat in the god seed see the serpent seed it can't he can't worship God Amen it just won't do it right for we know that that the Lord spoke to Cain and said hey if you come as able because Abel did a good work if you come as able then you should do well right right but if you don't send life at the door right so he couldn't come as a as the righteous seed see there's a separation there see on the wicked end it's it's evil spoken of that's on their part but on our part he is glorified because there's something within us that can't help but praise the Lord but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busybody in other men's matters see if it's minding your own business that's a whole another subject yes sir but yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf for the time has come that judgment that judgment must begin at the house of God yes amen and if it first begin in us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God right right see judgment must begin at the house of God the correction through the word through the reading of testimonies right through Reading of precepts through hearing of other people's testimonies testifying of what God has done in their lives right amen see we have testimonies as precepts we have testimonies as an eyewitness an account yes amen but I will not forget your testimonies I will not forget testimonies I will not forget what he has done in my life amen we've all had a wondrous work in our life right I could say that can we all say that we've all had a wondrous work God has proof in our life one way or another have you forgotten that or is that something magnificent in your eyes is that something that you will glorify God in so we will not forget his testimonies amen but I will always glorify God I will always give God thanks because there was Deliverance that was happening amen there was something that I had obtained I used to live a life like this I might I might have lived a life in drags I might have lived a life than alcohol I might have lived a life being lost right but now I am found and that is a testimony of God amen amen [Applause] the word is corrected so when that precept comes and it lands in our ears the entrance of the words that come in and it says that word is truth amen therefore I will submit unto that word I will surrender unto the holy spirit amen because Thy word is truth my my life up until now until I heard the Revelation my life has been a lie but now I see the truth amen amen and it's through humility God can't do that through Pride right amen for Pride goeth Before Destruction The Pride goeth before and fall so if it first begin in us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall their ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him and well doing as unto a faithful Creator amen yeah I say we we we we all go through our trials we all have our tests we all have our Temptations we all have uh the these our fiery trials or whatever it might be we all have our shortcomings in our lives right so uh uh a lot of people will say well I'm just I'm just so tired of living and you might think well how could how can somebody be tired of living I mean living is just living how could you be tired of living because somebody uh until you walk into a a mile in another man's moccasins as the old inner proverb is uh How would how would you know how a man feels unless you walked in the same steps or felt the same sorrow do we not have a high priest that that could feel the our infirmities amen that's right so he knows how we feel he knows the struggles that we go through he knows our sorrows he knows our jealousies he he knows our struggles he knows our Temptations He knows our fallings our shortcomings he know all these things he knows how we can feel right yes he could feel the desperation that a human being could feel right right amen so when we there there are people that just get so tired of living they just want to end it because they feel that it's that it's better for them to be off this Earth and nobody will notice that they're missing that's nonsense because somebody out there loves you somebody out there will take notice of you you are more valuable than what you put your the what you think you are right when somebody uh takes their own life it it you know because they think that their life is so worthless they don't realize the effect that it has on friends and family right right have friends and family those are people that care well then you might be able to refute that and say well if they cared so much how come they didn't talk to me as as much as and it you know that's that's a valid question how come we don't because we get complacent yes Things become become so common in our lives that we just get so busy in the hustle and bustle of life that we tend to forget other things because we're concerned about ourselves right right yeah but when that compassion comes oh my God how we can how we can feel somebody else's infirmities and we can we can have that compassion amen amen that we can reach down and talk to somebody hey you have more worth that's right you're worth something to me you really mean something to me Rhythm Malachi I really appreciate how you how you play the instruments sister Lydia I really appreciate it really blesses my soul amen amen you know you might see somebody on the street hey I really enjoy seeing you here every day you're like a staple in the community because I see you here you know I didn't notice it before but I actually looked forward to seeing you here at the at the convenience store or whatever it might be I actually look forward to coming seeing you today see how different a type one type of a word or what type of an action heck can have an impact on somebody's life right yes but say we get so tired of and I get so tired of falling I get so tired of failing I get so tired of saying the wrong things I get so tired of doing the wrong things I get so tired of of feeling jealousy I get so tired of of feeling anger and all this sorrow I get so tired of it I'm I'm just so tired of life I'm tired of being a failure I'm tired of being a burden I'm tired of not being good looking enough I'm tired of not being uh cool enough right you know it's these different things and and and and I know I'm talking I'm kind of talking into the into the youth a little bit because that's you know we've kind of outgrown that a little bit I think you know we're not thinking of how of how cool we are anymore but we've got to pass that phase yes but now we're looking how can I support my family I mean that's that's what I think about is how am I going to provide for my family what am I going to do for my family amen you know do we fall short sometimes you you bet I fall short of my family not of the provision's sake but in in other areas yeah I I fall short you know I get tired of working I get tired of bills I get tired of this I I get tired of overpaid taxes you know who doesn't get tired of that one yeah who can't relate to that right everybody can relate to that one I'm sick of taxes but hey that's something that we have to do yes sir yo you might just you might say well I'm tired of criticism I'm tired of this I'm tired of that I just get so sick and tired of of just feeling blah I'm tired of being sick I'm tired of being this I'm I'm tired of people coming to me you see what I mean right it's just there's just so much stress in this day there's so much that's put upon us right yes amen yes sir but it doesn't matter what's going on right our Trials come and go our trials change our situations change right but there's one thing that's unchangeable and that's our God so we should be tired we should be tired of these things right because it shows that our desires for him yo and we fall short when we when we fall into sin we fall into temptation and we just oh Lord I am so sorry how could I do something like that and we get tired of it yeah how many times how many is tired of falling I'm tired of doing the wrong things right but we all can't live the precepts we can't live the perfect life all the time yeah that's right so we have to accept that we are going to have failures yes but there's one that could pick us up but it just goes to show that our desires for him for you want to do right you don't want to do wrong you don't you don't go out of your way to do wrong that's what the wicked do right that's that's what they're that's what their portion is is they go out and they willingly do wrong right but that's not what the righteous seed wants to do right yeah there are times when we fall into that and you you might think to yourself you well you know what just this one time and then you feel so bad because what was I doing that was so stupid yes right why did I do that I know better yeah right yes right because a lot of people look at that scriptures those that willfully sin there is no more sacrifice for them and then people think well there's well there's no more for me I send my day away but if you willfully if you're casting his precepts behind you that's the difference right but when you could say Lord I am sorry if you could humble yourself and say Lord I'm sorry please correct me please guide my steps that I don't make that wrong move anymore I don't want to do those things amen amen but see we should yeah we get down because we do those things but don't stay down but rejoice not in not in the sin that you fell into but Rejoice that he's made a way for you to come out of it amen but Rejoice that you are a partaker of his sufferings amen right you know I've noticed I'm not an expert by any means I am no expert so this is just my uh this is just something that I've noticed you know depression is one of the hardest demons out there to defeat to battle yeah right depression is a hard it's a hard Spirit to battle it really is but but you know it's not unbeatable right amen it's very well beatable and you don't have to stay in that condition amen what usually gets us into that depression somebody's criticism of how they view US Our Faults Are failures because we fall into the into something or we we look at others every well I can't match up to somebody else I can't preach like some other brothers can preach but that's just the way it is yeah I can't I can't play guitar like you brother I could grab a guitar I could play a few chords and there's no way I could play a piano that's just way out there I can't do it but that's where each one has a different gift so we shouldn't be looking unto somebody else's gift we should be should be praying about our gift yes amen Lord what is my gift that I could give unto the world what is my gift that I could get busy and and just sharing what my gift is right right we shouldn't be looking under somebody else's gift something that we have and not into somebody some other men's batters but we should be looking into our own matters minding our own business right taking care of our own household taking care of our own lives right seeking our own salvation with fear and trembling men for how we live our lives or how other people live their lives has no bearing on what where our Salvation lies that's right amen amen so it's our relationship with him amen do you love his testimonies do you love the work that he's doing in your life love to read the word amen but you know yeah we get into those conditions yo he's not going to throw you away just because you just because you you sidestepped a a precept you know because you fell into temptation he's not going to throw you away because of something like that right because if he did that then all the heroes in the Bible wouldn't be heroes of the Bible right amen but if you read through from Genesis to Revelation those that we consider Heroes of the Bible you look back and you look at their struggles right they're men just like us and women there are men and women children just like us right right but see we put so much on ourselves that I need to do this I need to do that where's our trust in the Lord did not job say though he slay me I will trust in him amen amen right but he said I will plead my cause we're not going to try to justify ourselves we're going to say hey Lord I was wrong amen that's how you plead your cause amen you know John 14 and 1 says Jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me Hallelujah and we know that Jesus was the was the word and that he was made flesh to dwelt Among Us right amen and we also know that he took captivity captive he took your enemies as prisoners right so when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men right but you know before he ascended he had to descend before the Ascension there had to be a dissection right into the lower parts of the Earth right right so before he before he was raised up he had to be brought down low and you know when he was brought down low when he had that when he went through that dissension he went through the depths of the Earth that's where he took captivity captive because he took the keys away from Satan right the case that's right it just took it it just took the authority away from Death hell on the grave amen amen so he took captivity captive he took that for us amen amen amen but when he descended he took death hell on the grave captive he bound Satan to where you were made free and he took Satan's Keys amen he gave men gifts which is what the fivefold ministry that certain people want to do away with you know they say we don't need Ephesians 4 anymore they don't specify a certain portion of the Ephesians 4 they just specify Ephesians 4 yeah well we don't need Ephesians 4 anymore well that's that's taking away from scripture right right that's taking away a precept that's taking away part of the word of of the Lord amen for a specific instruction for the fivefold ministry and what what was it given for it was given for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry [Music] for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity glory of the faith not a Unity of Doctrine not a Unity of denomination right right but the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son so there's more to it than just a five-fold Ministry because when you take trying to take that out you're taking Christ out because it's giving the knowledge of the Son of God amen amen amen run to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I see it was there to to make us unified and to stand strong against the storms of adversity and false teaching right rightly dividing the word of truth right that's what the fivefold ministry is for hallelujah it's not to say well I'm an apostle and another one saying well I'm a pastor I'm a preacher I'm an evangelist it's not just for somebody to celebrate in so we can look that they have a distinguished gift because if you say that I love the Lord's word that I will obey the Commandments isn't that a commandment to go ye out into the world and to preach the gospel and how beautiful are the feet that those that that go and preach the gospel how can anybody hear the word unless somebody be sent sorry brother keep preaching amen good that's where it lies Hallelujah Ephesians 4 14. and this is an important aspect of that that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive all right so we received this instruction that we won't be deceived that we could recognize false Doctrine all right but speaking the truth and what in love not come and condemning somebody with the scripture because we we talked about how the letter killeth right but we also must have some Grace amen but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making the increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now what did John say when when uh John the Baptist what did he say when Jesus came and it was time for for John to kind of take a back seat he said I must decrease so what so he can increase yeah right so let's read that 16th verse there again from whom the whole body fiddly joined together and compacted by that which uh every joint supplies coming together if we have swelled up if we have an inflammation in the body it's not going to be fitly joined together if one person has increased so much the next one isn't going to fitly join together so we all must decrease so all of us coming together we can increase because we are fitly joined by Christ amen amen amen so according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body not individual but increase of the body unto the edifying of itself amen this is a body Ministry I can't I can't be here without you and you can't be here without me amen renate each other that's what the word is for that we could come together that we can unify that we can come what would it have been if they would if they would have gone and they would have waited 10 days and each one was in their own mind would they have celebrated a Pentecost they print they'd probably be still fighting about the color runs they're going again you know but what color they're gonna paint the wall but they they put everything aside amen amen they put differences aside and their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ right for that's where the Holy Spirit came down and that's where the change happened hallelujah amen amen where we depend on him right yes I won't be too much longer if you would turn to Psalm 50. but this is a body Ministry for one one planet one watereth but God gives the increase so we all have our own gift and when we bring those gifts together what a melodious sound it makes amen amen the Clapping of the hands the playing of the organ the playing of the piano the playing of the guitar and even The Stomping of the feet it all comes together and a little bit of dance right it makes me want to dance psalm 50. starting the first verse now this is a song of ASAP this isn't this isn't David writing this this is one of the one of the he was a he was a worship leader he was one who was appointed by King David uh to be a worship leader amen so that I think he might have wrote the about 12 12 of those songs or something like that I can't remember I didn't really do a thorough study on it uh I'm not much of a history buff but what I learned I'll try to share with you um so in some of ASAP the Mighty God even the Lord has spoken and called the Earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God has shunned Our God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him that means a raging fire amen he shall call to the heavens from above and to the Earth that he may judge his people gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice see if you notice in the fourth verse he says he shall call to the heavens from above and to the Earth that he may judge his people he's going to gather all of his Saints those that are up in glory and those that are here and alive and remain amen amen sounds like the Rapture right yeah it sounds like it sounds like coming together with the Lord amen so gather my Saints together unto me Glory those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice well you might say well this is Old Testament I can identify through this through the sacrifice of the blood of bulls and ghosts but there was one sacrifice that did away with the bulls and goats amen so you you have right up to this passage because you do have a sacrifice amen amen you have the perfect lamb and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God has judged himself here o my people and I will speak o Israel and I will testify against thee I am God even thy God I will not reprove thee from for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me I will take no Bullock out of thy house nor he goes out of thy folds for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle Upon A Thousand Hills say we often recite that our Lord owns a cattle on a thousand hills but he's even richer than that he's got more than a cattle on a thousand hills amen yeah for he said for every beast of the forest in my area I know all the fouls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine if I were hungry I would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fullness thereof will I will I eat the Flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high see as we just read there he's not really interested in the sacrifices because he already owns it yeah but what is what is his desire from you that you offer unto him Thanksgiving that you give him praise [Music] and pay thy vows unto the most high if you vow a vow unto the Lord be sure that you pay it keep your word among men yo that's very important is keeping your word that's how you gain people's trust right yes that's right if you say well I've got I'll do this with you on Saturday and then Saturday comes well I don't feel like doing that I'm not going to go you just broke your word right right so how's that how's that person going to view you now verse 15. it says and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me amen all thy testimonies are wonderful that's what we read in the beginning right my testimonies are wonderful amen amen and thou shalt glorify me but unto the wicked God saith what has thousand to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction oh my seeing thou hatest instruction and casters my words behind thee that's what that's what the wicked do is they cast the word behind them because they have no part with it amen just thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit thou citizen speak us against thy brother thou Slanders thine own Mother's Son these things has thou done and I kept silence thou taught us that I was altogether such and one as thyself but I will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes see he's saying see you thought I was a human like you but we also know the scripture says my ways are far above thy way yes sir yes sir see thou thought I said I was all together such and one as thyself you thought I was human like you you thought I was a a truce breaker you thought I was a false accuser you thought I was all these things that a human being is but his ways is he is faultless amen now consider this ye that forget God remember what we're talking on this morning I will not forget your testimonies now consider this ye that forget God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver whoso offereth praise glorifies me and to him that ordereth his conversation all right will I show the salvation of God you know we often say that that the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people you can't really find that in scripture there is one one place uh where it talks about something like that I can't remember exactly where it is there's a whole debate on that where where the Lord doesn't inhabit the praise of his people you know I believe he does amen if if we Are Holy as he is Holy if we are in him and we glorify him and we praise him he will be in our praise he will be in our song he will be in our dance he will be in our rejoicing because he is the one that we've rejoice in amen so of course he's going to inhabit the Praises of his people because he's housed in his people glory amen I'm going to go ahead and close if the musicians would come just like to close with a couple songs here but I really like how he said that whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation a right will I show the salvation of God Psalm 119 89th verse it says forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven amen thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast established the Earth and it abideth see that's how powerful our Lord is he spoke and it exists and it still exists they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants unless thy law had been my Delights I should have I should then have perished in mind affliction oh I see we Delight in his law because if we don't we would perish in our Affliction right verse 93 says I will never forget thy precepts or thy Commandments the statutes for with them thou has quickened me or made me alive thou has put life in me through these precepts he says I am thine save me for I have sought thy precepts the wicked have waited for me to destroy me and that's what they kind of do in this hour they're they're lying in wait for us they're waiting for our missteps to say hi I told you you couldn't live it to say huh I told you there was no truth in you see that's what they're waiting for right the wicked have waited for me to to destroy me but I will consider I will understand thy testimonies that's psalm 150. starting in the first verse it says praise ye the Lord everybody should know this one amen praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary praise God praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness not just his goodness but his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psaltery in the heart praise him with the temporal and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols nothing that has breath praise the Lord praise ye the Lord amen amen and one more Psalms 37 and 39th verse it says but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble [Music] if anybody has it if you're in any trouble you know who to call on man you're not going to call brother Jesse you're not going to call on brother Brian you're not going to call on your neighbor you're not going to call on your mommy your daddy or anybody else but you're going to call upon the Lord amen amen and then you can call upon the other ones you've got to call upon the Lord first for if you're in trouble that should be the first thing that comes from our Wireless Lord help thou me amen amen the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord hears their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him now see whether you're on the Mountaintop or whether you're in the valley praise ye the Lord amen right amen you stand to your feet with me this morning our walk doesn't go by what others do right it's in how we live and how we react and how we present Christ man I can't remember if I learned that song here or not but can we sing that song every praise that's that's like my I love that song yeah that's my thing that's been my go-to for uh sometime I just love it it's a awesome worship song if anybody has trouble call out to the Lord if anybody has trouble glorify him
