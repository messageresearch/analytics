you for this opportunity meeting your house lesbo lorises late for so long appraisers bless this Bible study but we always want to read your word before we get into your word Lord we're just gonna pray tonight just pray for the bread of life right here so let's our scriptures would be trying to teach the other juror I'm sure this is not a study on prayer will be a great provider time for us those of us who serve the Lord longer you're already walking on a narrow road dear Lord bless my time here at Jesus Christ there is it maybe maybe let's do the school about sitting here with the children I'm sending on prayer today God's grace you'll be gone over justification that we baptism and looked at sanctification and I just thought prayer would be good because prayer is what's going to lead you closer to God hearing the word is important but prayer is going to help you live that word as you pray it's going to open up the word to you and the universe's of you have been baptized and if you want to grow closer to the Lord the way to do that instead that individual prayers with if any of you've been thinking about that since we did our last Bible study something you've been thinking maybe getting away of praying alone with the Lord well this you know I went back this is notes and I want to look at first of all how God's house is the house of prayer let's go to Matthew 21 this is a great place to pray Matthew 21 verse hey now you 5 cover this story this way Jesus cleaned out the temple he did it twice he did at the beginning of his ministry that you'll read I needed at the end of this ministry first in the last shadow floors there but let's look at this here and we'll look at a few more scriptures but you know our families come in church so often we love each other so much this is a good time you don't to come and pray by ourselves I know you're young you want to play with each other and your your best playmates that's wonderful that's wonderful as you want to grow closer to the Lord you know perhaps the Lord will start putting a little burden on your heart to come in and pray for services a bit or maybe stay a little bit afterwards and pray but that's what God wants in this this this building right here and he wants you to pray seek him to this this place right now he said my house is the house so Matthew 21 you read uh I did 11 okay thank you Sarah do you want to do 12 and 13 sorry there might be mothers in the nursery don't want to hear this and thank you I never noticed that recently what should they never but verse 14 in the blind the lame came to him in the temple and He healed them so right after cleaning out the house God did super natural wonders and miracles so we want our church to be cleaned out absolutely sit in here you want to clean not that God could group and blessing people there loot seeking different blessings whether it's healing a revelation or the will of God or gifts of the Spirit or anything like that house needs to be cleaned out so I just wrote on here Jesus said the focus of this house should be one what should be the focus crater yeah career we do a lot of preaching and singing but we need to add more prayer don't you think I think I would agree that too it is a house of prayer prayer should be the main thing and Jesus if you know the context of this Jesus was actually cleaning out the quorum of the Gentiles this was the outer cornice wasn't even we'd say the holiest of the places because remember remember the middle wall partition and preach on that recently I think it was left two weeks ago agree to the minimum petition and that's where you know that wall separated the Gentiles from the Jews and so this was even considered an unholy place we'd say not as holy as the other places and Jesus clean that out so Jesus wants all of the church cleaned out and he said my house should be called a house of prayer so the focus was on money right the focus was on making money and Jesus said my house the focus needs to be on prayer so that's why you know you heard me ask the adults and everybody to come and pray before service great to stay afterwards I'm pray too but it isn't so important to have the pray in the house of God Jesus said my house will be a house of prayer let's look at the first time when Jesus appeared the temple it was John 2:16 and 17 shouting to 617 yep 2:16 and 17 take these things hence make not my father's house an House of merchandise disciples remember Jesus cleared out the temple in his first year ministry and his last year ministry at least people weren't born again so they couldn't keep their own house clean if we have the Holy Spirit though what do you think should we be able to keep our house clean yeah we should have to wait two years to get it cleaned out all right we should God should be able to minister to us on a Wednesday night or a Sunday morning it may be the next week hopefully by next week clean out our lives you should be able to get victory over and he sin or anything that exalts itself in our lives you should go get victory and he said the zeal you know what Co means jealousy never been jealous I know Mike should have been jealous cuz it's hard I've been jealous too when I was a little boy when when your brother sister gets birthday present you ever been jealous I know I've seen my children get jealous they wish so hard I was just the gisbert for me II wish it was yours right and that's how God feels about his house God's jealous like I want your worship occasion cares I want your worship and if we give it to anything else and we don't come here to pray and God's Word and glorify God God his jealousy the disciples said the seal of the jealousy of God's house has eaten up Jesus that means absorb or he was filled with God's jealousy this is not a place of money this is the place of Prayer this is a place of worship you probably children you've probably seen over the last few months you've seen a few people here early prank I've you seen nothing I did anything that makes me feel when I see people praying in the early reports rich happy off the other but also humbles me really well lord help me to help myself with people are here praying early right they want to hear from God and then I guess I have to check myself say lord please appear and make sure I've already prayed before but it just gives another reminder I want to pure heart I just want to preach God's Word when you see people praying and hungry for more of God's Word you want to be a vessel for God so prayer is a powerful powerful thing Jesus threw over their tables and whip them you can you imagine can you imagine Jesus taking this table right here throwing it over it's hard to imagine I love it because he's we know he's so full of love God so loved I know it's hard for me to imagine - or flipping over some of your tears brother branham said if God came to some of our churches today in Jesus he might flip over some of our chairs if the focus wasn't on prayer it wasn't on the word God worship he said perhaps there might be some more pew jumping people might have to jump over views to get out because God wants his house focused on prayer so think about that as we come Wednesday and maybe next week - maybe I can come to pray to do many times when I've been there you know suspended up study but sometimes I'm just on my knees pray and I know I'm just my face is off the carpet say God moved by the Holy Spirit who speak to the people and I got a text right after service today my wife for them to me which is really nice saying the Lord spoke to me today that was speaking today that's why we come to the house it works with value people will pray for God to speaker than God will speak that's why the comfort of the house of God so eating me up means God has captured my entire attention or my affection so the disciples look at Jesus and said Wow Jesus's full attention is on God Jesus does not paying any attention to money or he's not paying any attention to getting rich all his attention is on God I want people to pray when they come to church I don't want them to worry about making money that's a that's a beautiful story they saw in Jesus the zeal of God the jealousy of God now I'm going to show you where Jesus was quoting from Jesus just wasn't making this up he was actually quoting isaiah 50:6 let's go down as a 36 verse 1 they have 56 verse 1 the seal of my house eaten me up say it 56 are you okay thank you now I want to try six and seven by also the stranger the largest served to begin service everyone that he can even then when I reach my holy mountain my house of prayer they're burnt off into the sacrifice it should be accepted to provide altar all right okay so now we know where was Jesus quoting from Isaiah 56 and God is basically just rebuking those who are the word some people were not keeping the Covenant they were working on the Sabbath days God told them the rest they weren't keeping the Sabbath they were breaking the commands of God but those who kept the commands of God what he got promised what do you say what do you say about his holy mountain to bring you where it's my holy mountain and make you feel what joyful my house of prayer enjoyin house is prayer so you know if you keep God's Word how you gonna feel when you come to church you're gonna be a joy Cody you're gonna love coming to church right like the adults do they love to come to church because they're keeping God's covenant and I'm sure we've all seen people that don't like to come to church right because you're not keeping God's covenant but God said I'll make you joyful when you keep my covenant at home keep all the Word of God when you come to my house of prayer I'm gonna make you joyful so we see there's a great connection between keeping the word and then how much you love God's house I just thought you like to see where Jesus was quoting Jesus saying my house must be a house of prayer don't pollute it don't make it about money don't make it about anything else than what it's supposed to be about prayer talking with God and keeping God's commands and hearing God's commands so does that help you now you see where Jesus was quoting from Isaiah 56 here's another one about the house of God solves 93 593 5 and this just talks about the holiness of God God wants his house holy well Jesus was trying to get it holy right and that was by getting all their thoughts off of money and focusing it on prayer so let's all read that one out loud is everybody there 93 fives over there okay let's begin on three one two three my testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thy house o Lord forever so God wants his house holy he wants a sacred set apart so the focus has to be on prayer this House of Prayer must be holy this is a new one that's where he blessed me today Psalm 78 I just came across this one and remember it I forgot about this so I'm 78 58 58 58 to 60 such as these scriptures ya 78589 safety don't change it sorry if I get on 78589 you read 58 59 and Sarah could you do verse 16 thank you okay everybody see what happened here when did God leave the house of God when did he leave the house included with what I know so we preach on idols lately idolatry is the reason people had their names removed off the book of life items right so God said I'm gonna leave the house when people start worshiping other idols even if they came in church if they have idols outside the church God said my spirit is gonna leave that house so we have to make sure we don't have any idols in our lives right nothing is more important I know it's hard for children but think about what do you love most what do you love to do when you have free time what's the funded what's the most wonderful thing you can do now eventually as you grow older you want to have to be the Lord you want God to be your heart's desire no idols or anything like that nothing more important than the Lord okay that's what you want to grow so she do have been baptized and you want to be sanctified you want to get cleaned out for God God has to become number one he has to be your heart's desire we of course will be patient pray for you just like my mom prayed for me how you get my heart Lord Thomas 19 but we just want to point you and teach you in the right direction like train them up in the way they should go when they're old on that apart from it so we can see God we leave the house when the people set up idols that's because he's jealous over his house he wants his house focused on him prayer all right now let's look at a little bit scriptures on Jesus in prayer let's go to Luke 6:12 now if I could read this one Luke 6:12 before Jesus called his disciples let's see how long he prayed 6:12 so before he made a big move in the ministry let's see what all night before he started this ministry with these twelve here's another one this with a mark 644 Jesus was of course a man of Prayer no he was God's image as well in God's sight but that body still needed to pray that he still had to obey the Spirit that was inside of it so mark 644 644 6:44 k Thank You Lydia do you wanna read 45 and 46 it's great way he constrains his disciples to get into the ship and [Music] we need the valet key departing to the mountain to pray alright let me read a little bit more of the context of what happened here so Jesus had just spent the 5000 right right 75,000 and immediately after that what did he do pray he went right to prayer after a miracle so see what miracles you see what miracles oughta make us do should have make us exalted and prideful or should it humble us yeah I should humbles look how look how America humbled Jesus he fed 5,000 people how many baskets that have remaining remember think was 12 or 7 I guess either covers up when deer 75 members that was it fella okay well but it kept them humble and I hope that's what happens you have a good service and what you really do is I hope that makes you want to go home and just praise the lord or maybe on the drive home just worship the word I've had to have been many times like on Sunday nights when I get home children sometimes you know you're doing your playing I might just go up at the Ruby just pray for the long time just thanking the Lord you know for his word and how he's blessed us throughout that day and then if you know what happened after that then you know he said the disciples in the boat he goes out to meet them he walks on water they think he's their seen a spirit but it was actually God in flesh as God in Christ and then look at verse 52 but they consider not the miracle the loaves for their heart was hardened so part of me I'm just this is just my thoughts hildren but it seems like Jesus went to pray because he just did a miracle and that they didn't even understand what this America was about they didn't even understand that it's not about the natural loaves it's about spiritual bread it's about receiving the Word of God but I think in a parallel passage he also warned them about the leaven of the Pharisees of the Sadducees so Jesus didn't Americo and he's just seeing all my disciple and all they saw was the natural they didn't actually see that what's important here is the spiritual bread of God so he prays he goes to their praise then goes out and meets them on the water so Jesus had a personal prayer life even after the best services he would go out and pray instead more time with them we got a little bit more time in there I got plenty scripture of us go to Matthew 6 first one let's look at Jesus's personal teaching on a personal prayer that we could pray Matthew 6 now the first 4 verses about alms but worried that anyway because children even you can do nice things for others right even though you don't have a job what arms could children give think about that what what could you give to help somebody out who doesn't have something damn toys maybe got a nice channel used toy what else could you give to something you might have some money to get right like grandpa said you got money you might have some money to give I think you've done yeah I remember they yeah some of you had done that before some that pepper you some of you done that before which is wonderful you see somebody who doesn't had a lot of money and you say daddy you give this money to that person let's read about alms here already a little bit if you guys don't read a lot take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is it's heaven there without newest items you're not sounding trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets but they may have glory of men verily I say to you they have their reward that's why we don't go down some face look if we're gonna do something nice or we don't announce it you don't put a sign outside the church and say hey we're gonna give to the poor today that's ok people do that but they're actually have their reward but I'm glad they're giving of course we're glad they want to give verse 3 when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand do that man almost may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly now let's read about triggers so they were back to back on ok I can read verses just for his spy so where do they like to pray at where the hypocrites like you like to be like this not you said and I'll just pray for everybody right up here everybody see me praying look at me everybody sir be Sidney Frank Lydia you see my prayer I'm just gonna bring carrots look at me on brains they love it and back now boys and girls that's funny but that that's just backed by the only time they really pray hypocrites they just want to pray in front of other people they don't have the next kind of prayer that Jesus is talking about because their favorite prayers our longest prayers up in front of everybody and especially as me as a pastor as much as I'm in front of everybody I've got to make sure my prayers are longer by myself at the front of the church I got to constantly make sure my most sincere prayers are not to be seen of men but they're actually in private prayer we've got so let's look at Lydia verse 6 and then Sarah Cooper seventies how much I pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward you thank you thank you so it's God interested in how many words you say no not interested how many words you say what's he interested in serially you say what you have to say yeah and where should you go okay so what we want to pray and seek the Lord or somewhere private right like if I'm here is there a closet I can pray here if I'm all about this now no so just a private place that in your home yeah go to a small private place we're doing that and then what does God promise to do that he'll go to what will you do if you pray in secret what will he do reward you open because the father is only one who sees in secret right he's only one the song so make sure you blesses you let's go a little bit further here I want to read the Lord's Prayer and I know every the prayer of Jabez again to show you how preached a whole series on that in 2013 I want to just show again the similarities between the Lord's Prayer and shape the prayer of K best okay so verse 8 be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before you ask you so again it's not about how many words you stay but it's just about coming before the Lord and express to yourself he knows what you have Nina but of course he still wants us to pray it doesn't matter how many times am I gonna repeat this over and over I gotta say it over and over again God save my mom God take my dad that's what I might pray over and over yeah but it's not about just repeating the number of words it's about your heart condition now verse 9 after this manner therefore pray to our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name so how should we address God everybody what should we call God where you say dad although it means sacred or set apart that your name you said apart member last Sunday night what about the books preach on that study night the name of Jesus yeah the power of the name so he's got to start by reverencing his name worshiping his name but you need to be holy help me not use the name of Jesus your ever away I'll be to respect within to the Jesus we start off by calling father and you worship his name verse 10 let thy kingdom come let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so should we tell god what to do o we should say I let your will be W before I even pray may your name be glorified that your will be done through this prayer dear God now whether sometimes God lets us know his will yeah if he let that's called a revelation if he makes known to you what's gonna happen then you just pray for that you pray for that if you don't know like many times here we don't know if all these people's sick all these prayer requests we see lord if it be your will when you you know we asked for healing please heal please send deliverance send something they need but we always want to ask for God's will and then verse 11 give us this day our daily bread so is it okay to ask Jesus for what you have need of today yes Lord bless our service or Lord please provide this please provide that we have so much in America there's not too many things we worry about each day right but we can still ask the Lord ask God bless our day but our prayer should be more like who can we help today right because we have to worry about food not much for your we should thank God for the food and pray for the food but we're not like praying God I don't have anything in the fridge help me now some people might right but we should pray lord help me to touch somebody's life today I mean that help somebody out who doesn't have food or does it have money or help me to find some limit pray Lord put somebody on my heart you're pretty cool verse 12 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors so it's forgiveness important yeah should be part of your daily prayer forgive me Lord when I hurt Lydia forgive me when I hurt so and so and God help me to forgive those who hurt me help me to forgive forgiveness should be part of your prayers every day verse 13 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil so is it okay to ask God to help me get up Lord deliver me from this situation is that okay yes Lord this is so hard God this temptation is so difficult deliver me Lord that's something you could pray every time you pray and then he says for thine is the kingdom the power the glory forever amen so you closed with saying God all the glory yours all the praise is yours be glorified be magnified let your kingdom come okay like that prick and what a great prayer it is Jesus gives us the bottle of how to pray so let's go to the prayer of Jabez I think you'll see a lot of similarities it's verse chronicles 4:8 1st chronicles 4:8 that's one thing that struck me right away first chronicles 4:8 Kings Kings chronicles and crackers first chronicles 4:8 yep first chronicles for 8 now 8 is the lineage there I think we just started verses honey let's not go here at milk and I thank you read verse today first rivals for night verse 10 thank you who can see something that's similar to the Lord's Prayer did he see anything similar in there what do you see that's similar to the Lord's Prayer he for me evil very good now kind of key people to do what you see okay very good yep and it got on to this prayer yeah I think got out of this prayer sincere where did he want God in his life yeah number one what words that his exact words were looking at verse 10 or do you want God in his life with you would be with me isn't that a beautiful prayer he say God large my co-star give me more responsibility but only give me more responsibility if you're with me what have you and I believe that's why God honor this other words Lord I want to do something for you children you want do something for the Lord absolutely I do too I'm gonna do something for God but I only want to do it if he's with like that prayer I just think that so me something good to remember and you keep me for me we'll see he hated evil you want to stay as far away from evil as possible but yet do something for the Lord what if God to increase his influence God to increase his ministry so he could do something for God and stay away from evil sometimes I'll pray that God will you please send more families or God will you send me more you know preaching invitations so I can do something for you I just want to do something for it but keep evil keep me away from evil help me not to desire anything evil keep me from that God heard his prayer he granted him his request alright now go to Luke 11 this is probably one of the best things you can pray for right now Luke 11:13 well in case you read this Luke 11:13 this is a parallel passage to what we read in Matthew Jesus was teaching on prayer and he talks about how you ask God for something he's going to give you what you ask for something good not something evil Luke 11:13 okay look up here me don't have to tell me this but think in your heart have you asked God for the baptism of the holy ghost you have to tell me have you asked him for that if not what do you think you should do yeah you have to want that you have to one the Spirit of God in your life after one God to be number one you have to want the power of God in your life so that's something you've been asked for so think about that as you leave here today as we've even little bit about let me set up my prayer go back to moment so jesus said you have to ask you need to ask the Holy Ghost spend some time praying in the Holy Ghost that's really really important some of you been baptized that's what you need to do next to God don't leave the Holy Ghost sanctify my life okay you have to seek God he's only one of my final points prayer is then how you come to know God it's how you really come to know God and hear the word pray that you can receive or so let's prove that a few scriptures been about four or five more scriptures every kind of short is acts 1:14 go to excellent 14 x-14 to Lydia you read acts 1:14 is course about the cycles before Pentecost so they continue doing what gray Jesus said I wanted to fill you with the Holy Ghost when the thing with all that goes being breathed on them and said receive the Holy Ghost receive receive it but what they have to do they that's for that the way they'd asked for that to pray continually than to keep praying for that so what do you I want you to see that this is how you come to know God and member Jesus was with them but he said it's better that what instead of being with them he would be in that very good he said I'm gonna send the comforter in a comfortable movie with you even in you me so they didn't really come to know God and have got on the inside until they had prayed all that time right then the Holy Ghost told them that's when they really knew God because now God is living inside of that okay we just read this one in their house I think Jeremiah 29 so with you know my theory that jeremiah 29:10 and Lydia new to this is one of them people's favorite verses in the whole Bible which it's beautiful verse you have 29 to Jeremiah 29 - I love it too yeah have you read 1011 and then Sarah could maybe read 1213 let me make sure I could yeah I'll read 14 so ten eleven twelve thirteen I reported personal prayers how you get to know God brother branham read that the desperation message me said isn't that sweet you got something sweet I think that's very sweet I know the plans I have for you and you're going to come to an expected and you're going to know what's going to happen to you your know the end of your life thank you when are they gonna find God probably gonna find us by searching in prayer right is that a hard thing to do or is that pretty simple they got make it a hard to find him/her pretty simple any man any woman can find God and can know God through prayer it's that Chile that simple going in the closet or going someplace private jesus said the same thing he's Jesus say you have to go pray in front of a thousand people to know God really say feel pretty that's how close God can be to you that wants to meet you in a closet is that wonderful God doesn't he's that very far unless the member Paul said that next seventeen he's not far from us he's very close to us but that's how we get to know through prayer so sweetie said I would plan for keishon I would play Pure Life oh yeah I have a plan for your life but you've got to see inside you search for me with all your heart that's what you'll find lady when you start praying with all your heart that's a goodbye right we got a flat to our lives to see God in prayer not read 14 and I will be found of you saith the Lord now turn away your captive and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places with our German you say Lord I'll bring you again into the place whence I had caused you to be carried away captain so how do we get to know God what do we have to do we have to trim pray call upon his name search for a prey that's what you'll find God is really enough time with prayer can the adult saying that there's four he meant - I'll get a fifth day amen that's how you get to know God stirred prayer so if you've been baptized praise God now you're your next calling is to be a prayer warrior to get in the closet to pray and seek God say God give me the Holy Ghost God set me on fire help me to win souls for the kingdom of God I'm gonna back up a little bit Luke 11:13 jesus said if you ask the Father for the Holy Ghost will give it to you right I told mommy this on the way over here you guys know Jake evolved all right he's learning to teach his Bible come with me he just told me on Friday he said but if you said brother Jesse said when I first came to Bible club four years ago he said you taught on prayer and he said you taught on Luke 11:13 he just coded the scripture to me last Thursday and he said you said that Jesus taught us to pray for the Holy Ghost he said I've been praying for the Holy Ghost ever since and he said since then God has given me power to do I teaches a lot like he and I wrote eight weeks he's been oh it's really good teaching God's Word and he said I've been praying for the Holy Ghost he said the Spirit Holy Spirit guide Holy Spirit go with me today that's what we that's what we can keep doing that right and you children that's what you can do every day say God I want the Holy Ghost is money I want the Holy Ghost of guide me you gotta answer your prayer it just so simple though the Christian faith is so this one this next Richard Jeremiah 9 so we were in 29 we go go now earlier in the book - Jeremiah 9 this just kind of goes along with it I think now I read this one night in Bible times Lydia I just heard that was such a beautiful scripture I he know myself because I thought wow that beautiful jeremiah 9:23 and 24 if there's one thing we could get excited about or really feel happy about in our lives the scripture tells us what it is right here this is one thing I could say now guy I just want to tell you something I really want to tell you something I'm very happy about Jeremiah told us what it is let's do jeremiah 9:23 okay did you read 23 than the case you can try 24 so I'm not going to glory or get excited about oh look how strong I am look how handsome I am look how smart I am right we're not going to do that but case you read 24 this is what we should get excited to tell the people about so we're going to be happy that we have something what should we be happy about understanding and knowing God I understand the Bible this is the first time in my life I understand the Bible I know God I know Christ the Spirit of God is within me let a man glory in that now I'm so rich I'm so smarter I know all this I know this is not the world I know God I know his word I understand what he wants done today we should glory that that should be what we're most excited about is knowing God how we get to know God through what you seek me you'll find me you seek me with all your heart I just got two more scriptures zekiel 94 I remember this one about sighing and crying when you get to know God you get to know how he feels about obedience but you also get to know God about how he feels about what what's the opposite of obedience if so means our sin I've seen it I know what my truth I've seen you be burden for your friends that sin I've seen that that's a good attribute I've seen you guys rehearse and I know tell me the heady how do I talk to my friend about this they're doing this they're doing that and it's so good you know you're getting close to the heart of God when your burden for other people sit that's what he's he combined forces God was gonna spare people from judgment because they were sighing and crying for all the evils of their friends and neighbors and their generation was doing that was equal 94 are we different and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof so as you grow closer to Christ children if when you really love with Christ and really get to know him it is gonna hurt you when you see people walking and sitting so much so that you're gonna cry about you're gonna cry about it as Ukraine okay you'll so fall in love with God that you'll begin to love what he loves and hate what he hates and then when you're praying it'll just hurt you oh my friend did this God have mercy forget them or help their heart to be changed I know some of you have come up and told me right we've talked about that well my friend wore this and it was not the right clothes my parents told this or my friend did that doesn't and it burdens your heart doesn't it it's really it should burden you that's when you know you're getting close to knowing the Lord when you're burdened about sin because God hates sin as well all right and that is you become off spherical Christian later on your life you find that prayer is the way to build yourself up to become stronger in the Lord so we'll just close with that Jude chapter 1 verse 20 close to that because they have about that hour choose 120 we might as well be 29 to 24 so why don't we start with Lydia Lydia read 20 and 21 and maybe Sarah knew 22 23 thank you so building up yourselves your most holy faith by praying in the spirit there you can do 22 and 22 thank you so there's another scripture about how it's it's okay to hate sin you see that it's okay to hate the sin you love the sinner right but we hate the sin we hate that garment that's spotted with sin so it's okay they hate sin it should burn us we should sign cry for the abominations but if you want to build up our strength what we got to do we have to pray enough in the spirit pray in the Holy Spirit see Holy Spirit help me as I pray help me to pray your heart love me to pray for others forgive me help me to forgive others start praying in the Holy Spirit and then that will make you want to have compassion upon others can we save everybody or just some people just some some not everybody not everybody want to be saved I'm trying to have a lot of people I know you have to probably children I know the doll trap I try to get people at church eight books you try to do everything you want everybody to be safe but the Spirit will guide us to some people that we can have compassion on and make a difference in their lives and then some people we just have to learn with fear didn't make them fear God pulling them out of the fire now guys we'll finish this off with verse 24 thank you so did you see that and he's able to keep you from falling now remember what it say in verse 20 how do you build yourself up praying grinding the spirit yeah there's plenty and praying the spear that builds you up and then he's able to keep you from falling so we'll see how prayer is connected there with building yourself up here so that's what we want to do we want to build ourselves up through prayer okay any questions before we finish here children any questions alright let's just close with prayer and in your heart while I'm praying maybe this might be the time to say more I want to receive the Holy Spirit this might be a good time to pray that I'd be good time to say lord help me to pray I mean to pray in the closet Lord it might help me to be sanctified of me to seek you how many want to find
