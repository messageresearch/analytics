[46:48] have to rush in between Services we can
[46:51] just relax and enjoy the fellowship how
[46:53] enjoy fellowshipping with your brothers
[46:55] and sisters in Christ Christ
[46:58] amen such a blessing praise
[47:00] God 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[47:04] 1 I'd like to um preach on gifts of the
[47:07] Spirit this morning Sister Amy had asked
[47:09] me a while back probably probably a year
[47:11] ago to preach on if I felt led to preach
[47:13] on the gifts and I had uh but then I
[47:16] kind of got dealing with you know the
[47:17] church ages and the Holy Ghost and and
[47:20] then I thought and then when she told me
[47:21] that was her last Sunday coming I was
[47:23] already working with gifts of the Spirit
[47:25] so I thought well well this would be the
[47:26] best time to preach it by God's grace so
[47:28] hope it's a blessing to everybody just
[47:29] kind of want to review these in a little
[47:31] bit uh in 2012 I preached 36 sermons on
[47:34] the gifts of the Spirit so I'm just
[47:35] trying to pull the highlights out of
[47:37] there uh it's just a huge topic uh
[47:40] because uh they're God's gifts to his
[47:43] people and everywhere you see God's
[47:44] people God gives gifts to his people you
[47:47] know he wants his children to be blessed
[47:49] and so forth so it's just a tremendous
[47:51] subject but we try to uh just narrow it
[47:53] down to look at each and every gift a
[47:55] little a little bit today and uh trust
[47:58] us to be blessed how many interested in
[48:00] the gifts of the Spirit in your life
[48:01] praise God certainly am and I I think
[48:04] you know as I was looking at this again
[48:05] I'm just reminded I think they operate
[48:07] more than what we think and uh I think
[48:10] we just need to refresh it and remember
[48:13] uh what they are and then I think you
[48:14] see how much they operate by God's grace
[48:17] they actually operate quite a bit
[48:18] amongst us here when the Lord moves so 1
[48:21] Corinthians chapter
[48:23] 12 verse one
[48:26] and uh let me get there sorry I didn't
[48:28] get there by God's
[48:30] grace verse one now concerning spiritual
[48:34] gifts Brethren I would not have you
[48:37] ignorant so Paul doesn't want us to not
[48:39] know about them we need to know about
[48:41] them you know that ye were Gentiles
[48:44] carried away unto these dumb Idols even
[48:46] as ye were LED see the spirit of Satan
[48:48] will lead you to dumb
[48:50] Idols make you dumb right right make you
[48:53] make you uh have no praise for God
[48:56] verse three wherefore I give you to
[48:58] understand that no man speaking by the
[48:59] spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse and
[49:02] that no man can say that Jesus is Lord
[49:05] but by the Holy Ghost and now there are
[49:08] diversities of gifts but the same spirit
[49:11] and there are diversities of
[49:13] administrations but the same lord and
[49:15] there are diversities of operations but
[49:17] is the same God which worketh all in all
[49:21] but the manifestation or the appearing
[49:23] that's what the word means there the
[49:24] appearing but the manifestation of the
[49:26] spirit is given to every man to profit
[49:30] with all to benefit Every Man's given
[49:33] this
[49:35] manifestation for to one is given by the
[49:38] spirit the word of
[49:40] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[49:42] by The Same Spirit to another Faith by
[49:45] The Same Spirit to another the gifts of
[49:46] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[49:50] the working of Miracles to another
[49:51] prophecy to another Discerning of
[49:53] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[49:56] tongues to another the interpretation of
[49:58] tongues but all these worketh the one
[50:00] and the selfsame spirit dividing to
[50:02] every man severly as he will so God
[50:06] knows which gift you need God knows
[50:08] which gift is in your life and he wants
[50:10] you to operate just the gifts that he
[50:12] placed in your life praise God let's
[50:14] just bow our heads for word of prayer if
[50:15] you have a need on your heart you like
[50:16] to go to Higher Ground or anything this
[50:18] morning or like to understand your gift
[50:20] just raise your hand I'm sure God will
[50:22] hear it or you know bow your heart and I
[50:24] know God will hear your prayer because
[50:25] loves you Heavenly Father the Bible said
[50:28] we love you because you first loved us
[50:32] thank you for loving me while I was yet
[50:33] a sinner you died the righteous for the
[50:37] unrighteous and Lord to keep the church
[50:39] clean and to lead the church you sent
[50:41] down gifts so it would not be man's
[50:44] ability or women's ability to lead and
[50:47] guide the church and church keep the
[50:49] church clean but it would be the ability
[50:52] of your spirit Lord God and alls we
[50:55] would have to do is just learn to yield
[50:57] walk in obedience Lord God and then
[51:00] these gifts these special gifts Lord uh
[51:03] these uh these Graces that you've given
[51:06] to us Lord hallelujah will be able to
[51:09] operate through our lives Lord we're
[51:11] grateful for
[51:12] everyone Lord we never want to put gifts
[51:15] above the giver so Lord that's why we
[51:16] preach more on the baptism of the Holy
[51:18] Ghost but Lord once we've got that then
[51:21] Lord we want to turn our attention to
[51:22] serving you and this is where this
[51:25] Channel comes in Lord how we can let the
[51:28] Waters of life flow through us how we
[51:30] can let Christ flow out through our lips
[51:32] Lord or through through our prayers Lord
[51:35] God and and so father just speak to us
[51:37] you saw the hands Lord God I don't know
[51:39] what's in their hearts I don't know
[51:40] their questions but father I just pray
[51:42] you'd speak to them this morning they're
[51:43] your people lord they're your children
[51:46] Lord and I pray just anoint me anoint
[51:47] them in Jesus Christ's name and the
[51:49] church said amen God bless you being
[51:51] seated there praise the
[51:54] Lord
[51:57] so let's look at this I I'll set my
[51:58] timer for about an hour but I may go
[52:00] over just a little bit you know the Lord
[52:02] willing if we uh since we got time today
[52:05] by God's
[52:08] grace so Mala you can switch it over
[52:10] here buddy thank you sir I just have a
[52:14] lot of quotes to show you like I said I
[52:15] really had to condense it you know and
[52:17] uh I think that's a good thing you know
[52:19] praise the Lord and I think you'll be
[52:21] blessed by the gifts you know some of
[52:22] these I'd forgotten about so when I went
[52:24] back over I thought oh my that's really
[52:25] helpful praise God I wish I would not
[52:27] have forgot that but uh all things you
[52:30] know God and so see sister I was going
[52:32] to preach it back in November I forgot
[52:34] to change the date on there so you can
[52:36] see I've a meaning to do that so
[52:38] actually worked out good by God's grace
[52:40] I I need to go back and see what I
[52:41] preached on that day it we need to see
[52:43] what the Lord you know in in uh inserted
[52:46] there instead of uh that because that
[52:48] was the day I I was going to preach it I
[52:50] think you were out of town or something
[52:51] I think you were traveling that day I
[52:52] think that's why I changed the the topic
[52:55] there
[52:56] but uh as you said I I really believe
[52:57] you know you're interested in serving
[52:59] the lord better and uh and we know we
[53:02] have to answer for our gifts you know if
[53:04] preachers have to answer for their gifts
[53:05] then everybody's got to answer for their
[53:07] gifts we kind of went over that last
[53:08] Sunday night whatever talents you've
[53:10] been given now that was just a money but
[53:12] uh it's an illustration whatever you've
[53:14] been blessed by whatever God has graced
[53:16] you with you must be faithful with it
[53:19] and so God help us to be faithful and I
[53:21] think now I realized too this ties in of
[53:23] course with last Sunday night's
[53:24] communion message so I think that's a
[53:26] real blessing and uh I hope you'll be
[53:28] blessed here today by the grace of the
[53:31] Lord now in uh 1 Corinthians 14 I'm
[53:34] going to skip ahead uh a few quotes here
[53:37] uh by God's
[53:39] grace yeah here we go um the Bible says
[53:42] where to follow charity then desire the
[53:44] gifts this has always been my desire
[53:46] this has always been my understanding
[53:47] I'm sure yours too uh we never want to
[53:50] put too much emphasis on the gifts but
[53:52] if you have charity already if you have
[53:54] the gift giv already then you desire to
[53:57] see his
[53:58] gifts uh we never of course we never put
[54:01] gifts above the giver but the Bible
[54:03] literally says this uh you should and
[54:07] and that's what remember the three-fold
[54:09] uh the three-fold determination that
[54:10] you're on fire one of them is the Cry of
[54:12] the reaching out in the spirit so that's
[54:15] that's the the cry Lord manifest your
[54:17] gifts let your hand be seen amongst us
[54:19] amen like I said it don't matter if it's
[54:21] in the church or outside the church we
[54:23] just want to see his hand and then we
[54:25] want you to come tell us about it when
[54:26] it happens give us a testimony because
[54:29] we it just strengthens the people's
[54:30] Faith Amen to see God moving in our
[54:33] midst praise the Lord and I just had a I
[54:36] felt like a gift of wisdom flow out
[54:37] through me the other night and I'll
[54:38] share that in a little bit when we get
[54:39] to wisdom because the brother was this
[54:42] brother never texts me about his
[54:43] personal battles and questions he sends
[54:45] me this personal battle another brother
[54:47] had questioned him and kind of rebuked
[54:48] him on something and he said what do you
[54:50] thinking so I just started I just had
[54:52] this bird I just could had to stop
[54:54] washing dishes you know and send these
[54:56] texts and after all it he said my what a
[54:59] gift of wisdom that was I never even had
[55:01] these thoughts and I wasn't even trying
[55:03] to say hey look at my gift I was just
[55:05] trying to help somebody who needed help
[55:08] and uh so I just thought my I didn't ask
[55:10] for
[55:11] that it just it flows out and that's
[55:13] what the holy spirit is brother Bram
[55:14] said even when you speak in tongues you
[55:15] don't even know you're going to do it
[55:16] sometimes it just flows out so we just
[55:19] want to be vessels that the Holy Spirit
[55:20] can flow out of I want God to grab my
[55:23] vessel brother Adam and then fill me
[55:24] he's f me now pour me out and use me
[55:26] praise the Lord let me be a help to
[55:28] somebody praise the Lord because the
[55:30] Bible says this follow after charity and
[55:34] so you have to do both I'm always
[55:35] following Divine love I want to love my
[55:37] sisters I want to love my brothers I
[55:39] want to hate sin I wanna I want to love
[55:41] the church I want to love my family but
[55:43] at the same time I desire to see God's
[55:46] Graces his
[55:49] gifts and then he says of all things you
[55:51] should desire prophecy because prophecy
[55:54] has like a five-fold blessing you know
[55:56] it's Comfort we'll get to that a little
[55:57] bit it's Comfort it's edification it's
[55:59] judgment it's correction so see file the
[56:02] Holy Ghost then desire him to move
[56:03] through the gifts how many how many how
[56:05] many feel that way you're following the
[56:07] Holy Spirit and you like to see gifts
[56:09] manifested in the midst prayer expresses
[56:11] our desires to God and so we should pray
[56:13] more so pray more that's why we should
[56:15] pray for the gifts pray for God's hand
[56:17] to move uh pray for the Holy Spirit to
[56:19] move amongst us then this is the order
[56:22] first you get born again and then you
[56:25] desire spiritual gifts now different
[56:28] churches you know ask brother brandom I
[56:29] don't have the quotes here but they
[56:30] asked brother BR should we're filled
[56:31] with the Holy Ghost now should we seek
[56:32] gifts he said don't you do it he said
[56:34] let God add those gifts to the church
[56:36] but I have other quotes where brother BR
[56:38] told the people to pray for
[56:40] gifts so it kind of depends on the time
[56:42] and season it depends the group you're
[56:44] talking to but here you can you see
[56:47] there should be a desire for it and in a
[56:49] couple weeks ago we looked at remember
[56:50] Acts chapter 4 and after they got
[56:52] persecuted they went back to the room
[56:54] and they prayed for for God to send more
[56:55] signs Miracles and wonders so see
[56:58] there's a time and season to pray for
[56:59] that and desire that uh and so we must
[57:03] understand that we must balance all
[57:05] these quotes out and and all the
[57:06] scriptures out and we must let the Holy
[57:09] Spirit lead us amen now here's where
[57:10] brother Braham literally says we should
[57:12] covet the gifts literally brother Braham
[57:13] says this we should covet the gifts
[57:15] amongst us now covet is usually a word
[57:17] for uh for a sin right Thou shalt not
[57:20] cover covet thy neighbor's wife right
[57:22] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's oxen
[57:24] or sheep or something like that covet is
[57:26] once something that somebody else has
[57:28] for
[57:29] yourself but the Bible says we should
[57:32] covet the spiritual moving through the
[57:35] gifts wherefore Brethren covet to
[57:39] prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[57:41] tongues how many can say Amen to
[57:43] that so we should come to church and say
[57:46] Lord tell me the future tell me tell me
[57:48] your will tell me what's going to happen
[57:50] show me things to come praise God
[57:52] because that is the spirit of Jesus
[57:53] Christ the spirit of prophecy now thank
[57:56] God for brother brandham God through
[57:58] brother brandham has shed us many things
[57:59] to come so we should still desire more
[58:02] but literally we know all about the
[58:04] Catholic Church The Rapture you know the
[58:06] persecution The Squeeze we have all
[58:08] these things that God has told us with
[58:10] in the name of the Lord the holy spirit
[58:12] said this we know so much to come we
[58:14] should be grateful for that amen and we
[58:16] are but here's where brother ad says at
[58:19] 1958 now another thing that we believe
[58:22] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[58:24] to every and a prophit with all see it's
[58:26] given to all of us now we believe that
[58:28] when these gifts and so forth are
[58:31] operating in the church which we covet
[58:34] and desire that the people who are
[58:37] gifted by the Spirit come and worship
[58:41] with
[58:41] us hallelujah don't you like that Lord I
[58:44] desire that people that have the gift of
[58:47] wisdom or the gift of Prophecy come to
[58:49] our church praise the Lord I desire that
[58:52] because brother Bram desired that amen
[58:55] he desired God's gifts to be in the
[58:57] church how many like that quote hope
[58:59] that's a blessing to you brother even
[59:02] tells us this in the same the same
[59:04] sermon this is a yeah I think I told you
[59:06] about this this is a one hour Church
[59:07] order sermon if you just have one hour
[59:09] it's quite a great uh sermon to listen
[59:11] to gifts are the order of the day that's
[59:15] what brother BR tells us now we believe
[59:17] that the spiritual gifts among Believers
[59:20] is the order of the
[59:23] day we cannot believe that a man can
[59:27] preach under inspiration and then be an
[59:29] inspired teacher and then deny the gift
[59:31] of healing what about message preachers
[59:33] that deny the gifts oh we don't need
[59:35] tongues anymore we don't need healing
[59:37] look at that they are not
[59:39] inspired Hallelujah but if you say we
[59:42] need it and you welcome it and you covet
[59:43] it desire it you must be inspired amen
[59:46] of the holy spirit because that's the
[59:48] order of today
[59:53] Glory cannot believe a man's inspired of
[59:55] the Holy Spirit to say something like
[59:57] that because that's the very day we're
[59:58] living
[59:59] in because brother baham tells us the
[1:00:01] gifts were to remain in the church until
[1:00:03] he came praise God and we're told this
[1:00:07] in the church age book chapter
[1:00:09] 7 Paul the first messenger and he said
[1:00:12] in Galatians 1 18 that if any Angel any
[1:00:14] messenger any vicer no matter who he was
[1:00:16] if he preached any other gospel than
[1:00:17] what Paul preached let him be a cursed
[1:00:20] Paul knew that after he was gone
[1:00:21] Grievous wolves would come in he knew
[1:00:23] that Satan himself
[1:00:25] could appear as an angel of Light so how
[1:00:28] much more his
[1:00:30] ministers so he warns that this gospel
[1:00:33] would always be the same now Paul had
[1:00:37] baptized in jesus' name and re-baptized
[1:00:39] where people had not been so
[1:00:43] immersed he set the church in order and
[1:00:45] taught the proper use of the gifts of
[1:00:47] the Spirit and confirmed that they were
[1:00:50] to remain in the church till Jesus came
[1:00:55] thus the next Messengers all the
[1:00:57] remaining six which would include
[1:00:58] brother Brandon right would by the same
[1:01:01] Holy Ghost burn with the same fire and
[1:01:04] give the same light of the Gospel of
[1:01:05] Jesus Christ and the signs would follow
[1:01:09] them but here's where we're getting down
[1:01:11] to you now and me
[1:01:16] Hallelujah this is
[1:01:18] 1954 now wouldn't you all like to have a
[1:01:21] real Bible Church how many could say
[1:01:23] Amen to that am amen I like have a real
[1:01:24] Bible Church I believe we have one a
[1:01:26] real Bible Church where all the
[1:01:28] spiritual gifts were set in
[1:01:31] order everything making manifest just
[1:01:34] exactly the way it should be oh that's
[1:01:36] what my heart burns for amen wouldn't
[1:01:40] that be wonderful now you're gonna have
[1:01:42] to
[1:01:43] sacrifice not money you're gonna have to
[1:01:47] sacrifice what some of your own ideas
[1:01:50] you're going to have to sacrifice some
[1:01:52] time in prayer
[1:01:56] you're going to have to sacrifice maybe
[1:01:58] a stubborn will to break down in
[1:02:02] humility to maybe to like I said to to
[1:02:05] speak in front of a group and say thus
[1:02:07] sayi the Lord here's a word of knowledge
[1:02:08] for so and so or thus sayi the Lord
[1:02:10] here's the future or speak in a tongue
[1:02:12] or or pray you know and prophesy or
[1:02:15] something along these lines it takes
[1:02:16] humility to do those things our pride
[1:02:19] does not like to be the have all the
[1:02:21] attention on us right right and that I
[1:02:24] guess that can be good humility and but
[1:02:26] I'm saying like uh I guess our fears
[1:02:29] maybe that'd be a better word our fears
[1:02:31] sometimes we don't like to have the
[1:02:32] attention on us and I never like that
[1:02:35] never get used to that I never thought
[1:02:36] i' telling people I never thought I'd
[1:02:38] ever be a preacher but God called me to
[1:02:40] do such
[1:02:41] things but it t it takes a a deliverance
[1:02:44] from stubbornness to be able to manifest
[1:02:47] the gift of God in your life you can't
[1:02:49] be so stubborn and say no no no no
[1:02:52] you've got to humble yourself and say
[1:02:54] yes Lord Lord if you want me to do it
[1:02:56] yes Lord forgive me of my stubborn
[1:02:59] spirit I keep saying no I won't
[1:03:01] sacrifice my time I won't sacrifice my
[1:03:03] prayer remember it's not a sacrifice of
[1:03:06] money it's a sacrifice of time and
[1:03:08] prayer and that's where I think we all
[1:03:10] could use God's help don't you
[1:03:12] think the whole Christian move is
[1:03:16] sacrificial oh Hallelujah he that will
[1:03:19] follow me let him deny himself take up
[1:03:22] his cross and follow me daily that's why
[1:03:26] a few services with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] series I was working with coming to
[1:03:28] church early again if you really have a
[1:03:30] burden for people you got to sacrifice
[1:03:32] your time amen now you can pray during
[1:03:34] the week too that's wonderful too but
[1:03:35] I'm just saying like if you have no
[1:03:36] other time before service you're already
[1:03:38] on your way here it'd be a good thing to
[1:03:40] do pray sacrifice some time sacrifice
[1:03:43] some
[1:03:45] prayer is that right how often do you
[1:03:47] have to
[1:03:48] sacrifice every
[1:03:50] day he died daily every day he died so
[1:03:54] if you know there's a gift of God in
[1:03:55] your life how often should you die and
[1:03:57] ask God to help you every day I try to
[1:03:59] do that Lord help me to bring the right
[1:04:00] message help me to preach the truth help
[1:04:02] me to preach just the Bible praise the
[1:04:04] Lord but this is in the same quotation
[1:04:07] that he said now I'll go back a little
[1:04:09] bit yeah this the same quotation about
[1:04:11] everybody
[1:04:12] here he's not just talking to preachers
[1:04:15] he's talking to everybody and this is of
[1:04:16] course in Jeffersonville sacrifice some
[1:04:18] time in
[1:04:19] prayer so help me Lord not to be
[1:04:21] stubborn praise God help me to be humble
[1:04:24] help me to be a Christian who lives a
[1:04:26] life of sacrifice that's what it
[1:04:28] takes oh I misspelled a word here how to
[1:04:32] know you're or you're you how to know
[1:04:34] you're you
[1:04:36] gift you can do the gift in your life
[1:04:38] pardon me I didn't mean to misspell that
[1:04:39] I don't know what happened
[1:04:42] there okay so let's look at this this is
[1:04:44] what brother man tells us how do you
[1:04:46] know your gift and he said the way you
[1:04:48] know it is that you can do
[1:04:49] it in 1961 how does one know their
[1:04:52] rightful position in the body of Christ
[1:04:54] that's a good one very good that'd be
[1:04:56] the kind of question amongst many of us
[1:04:58] here tonight can I see a raising of
[1:05:00] hands how many have that question how
[1:05:01] would I know my rightful position in the
[1:05:02] body of Christ well God bless those
[1:05:04] hands praise the Lord and little
[1:05:06] Esther's hand went up God bless you
[1:05:08] Esther bless your
[1:05:11] heart how do you rightfully know now I'm
[1:05:14] presuming that this brother wants to
[1:05:15] know what position what in Christ what
[1:05:19] part of Christ do I play what a question
[1:05:23] what part am I of Christ what do I play
[1:05:26] how am I going to manifest Jesus Christ
[1:05:29] to the church or to my
[1:05:32] family now for instance I'd say like
[1:05:34] this brother to give you the best answer
[1:05:36] I know your position is in Christ is
[1:05:38] revealed to you by the Holy
[1:05:40] Spirit and then if you want to know
[1:05:42] whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find
[1:05:43] out whether He blesses what you're doing
[1:05:46] or
[1:05:47] not and if he blesses it then that's
[1:05:50] from
[1:05:51] him also don't forget to there's another
[1:05:54] quote too I didn't have here but he said
[1:05:55] go back and make sure it's the word of
[1:05:57] God uh for you to do it so make sure
[1:06:00] it's God's will you meet the
[1:06:01] qualifications of God's
[1:06:04] will like someone said to me lot long
[1:06:07] ago brother BR the Lord called me to
[1:06:09] preach I said well then
[1:06:11] preach right don't you like that
[1:06:13] straightforward well you got to give
[1:06:14] okay then operate
[1:06:16] it and so I really think so it's Satan
[1:06:19] if he can just get somebody as to act
[1:06:21] like that and then deceive them
[1:06:24] that's just what he wants to do then the
[1:06:27] whole world points their finger right
[1:06:28] there look at this preacher he tried to
[1:06:30] preach and he's all mixed up and he
[1:06:32] can't be used of God nobody's blessed
[1:06:34] God's not blessing it he brought shame
[1:06:37] upon the church or something like that
[1:06:38] that's just what Satan wants to do but
[1:06:40] if somebody's LED of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:42] they wait on God's timing praise God and
[1:06:44] when they're used of God then the world
[1:06:46] just says a nonsense but the church
[1:06:48] rejoices because they recognize God gave
[1:06:50] us a gift amen and we're at all benefit
[1:06:53] from that gift gift
[1:06:55] Hallelujah somebody thinks they have a
[1:06:57] gift of speaking in tongues
[1:06:58] interpretation someone has a gift of
[1:07:00] Divine Healing some of these things like
[1:07:02] sometimes they're mistaken in those
[1:07:05] things see and sometimes they think they
[1:07:07] haven't got it when they have so it's
[1:07:10] very tricky it's very tricky remember
[1:07:13] Sister Bruce had the Holy Ghost and she
[1:07:15] was all confused she didn't have it
[1:07:16] because she never spoke in tongues so
[1:07:19] brother brandom saw in the vision she
[1:07:20] had the Holy Ghost so he tell he prays
[1:07:22] that God let her speak in tongues so she
[1:07:24] can have peace in her
[1:07:26] heart but brother B said I wouldn't tell
[1:07:28] that to everybody because they'd start
[1:07:30] seeking the gift rather than the giver
[1:07:33] they they would have a gift but not have
[1:07:35] the same type of life that she lived
[1:07:38] exactly right so it's very tricky so how
[1:07:41] do you know you wait upon God and you
[1:07:43] let him his word be be taught to you
[1:07:45] praise God Amen and like I was telling
[1:07:48] brother Austin the other day we were
[1:07:49] talking about Gideon was a man who had
[1:07:51] to have signs that's how I've usually
[1:07:53] operated when because God don't speak to
[1:07:54] me by dreams or voices I don't really
[1:07:56] often get those so what I do is I I I
[1:07:59] get real sincere maybe I fast and pray I
[1:08:01] ask God for a sign and then if God gives
[1:08:02] me that sign I know it's the will of the
[1:08:04] Lord and so that that's that's one way
[1:08:07] you might have to do that you might have
[1:08:08] to say God Give Me A Sign give me for
[1:08:10] example you might say give me three
[1:08:11] signs today or give me three signs by
[1:08:13] the end of the week but be careful with
[1:08:15] that because Satan get in can get into
[1:08:16] that as well praise God make sure your
[1:08:19] make sure your motive and objective is
[1:08:20] right to begin with praise God you have
[1:08:23] to get there uh first make sure your
[1:08:24] heart is right so it can be very tricky
[1:08:27] because see Satan's trying to really uh
[1:08:30] uh mess the church up if he can mess
[1:08:32] somebody's life up for years and years
[1:08:34] and years uh he he would get pleasure in
[1:08:36] that and maybe people might might not be
[1:08:39] blessed well like they could be and like
[1:08:41] we went over last Sunday night people
[1:08:43] will lose their reward because they
[1:08:44] didn't fulfill the ministry God called
[1:08:46] them to have the Bible said they
[1:08:48] themselves would be saved but their
[1:08:50] reward would be all consumed with fire
[1:08:53] amen that's exactly
[1:08:56] right so always do this Brethren
[1:08:59] whenever you feel that you're supposed
[1:09:01] to do a thing first find out okay that's
[1:09:03] what I was saying find out if it's
[1:09:04] scriptural for you to do
[1:09:06] it if it's in the scriptures not just
[1:09:09] wrote in one place but I mean completely
[1:09:13] scriptural Through the Bible for you to
[1:09:14] do it your
[1:09:17] position say if you'd be evangelist
[1:09:19] Pastor teacher Prophet whatever that God
[1:09:22] might have called you to be you see or
[1:09:24] if you have the gift of tongues gift of
[1:09:25] interpretation gift of any kind of the
[1:09:27] nine spiritual gifts in the church and
[1:09:29] the four spiritual offices in the church
[1:09:31] any position first see if it's God
[1:09:34] calling find out if it's man calling
[1:09:37] your flesh calling a denomination
[1:09:38] calling find out who's calling amen is
[1:09:41] it your Mom calling your dad your
[1:09:42] grandma your grandpa who's calling your
[1:09:44] aunt or Uncle make sure it's God calling
[1:09:46] amen hallelujah if it's God calling
[1:09:49] you'll meet the conditions of the word
[1:09:50] your life will meet the conditions and
[1:09:52] it'll line up with God's holy word amen
[1:09:55] then usually the way I watch it for
[1:09:57] myself this is me I watch the nature of
[1:09:59] a person and see what the kind of a gift
[1:10:02] that they're professing see God will
[1:10:04] work with his creature the way he's made
[1:10:06] see he'll make a
[1:10:08] creature if you see him real flighty now
[1:10:11] flighty means you go from one thing to
[1:10:12] the next well go to this and then go to
[1:10:14] that go to that if you see him real
[1:10:16] flighty and going on and he says oh the
[1:10:18] Lord called me to be such and such to be
[1:10:19] a pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty
[1:10:22] person a pastor solid
[1:10:26] sound so flighty means you're not
[1:10:30] solid right God called me to be a
[1:10:33] teacher well then watch how he
[1:10:35] interprets that
[1:10:36] word see he gets it all mixed up and
[1:10:39] everything then you can tell see but
[1:10:40] then the thing to do your position is
[1:10:42] usually known whether you can do it or
[1:10:47] not and when God called me to be an
[1:10:49] evangelist I want to be a pastor my
[1:10:50] calling was an evangelist laying right
[1:10:52] here at this Cornerstone if you could
[1:10:54] burst in there tonight you'll see a fly
[1:10:55] leaf off my Bible where he told me to be
[1:10:57] an evangelist see and I wasn't a
[1:10:59] successful Pastor although the people
[1:11:01] cried when he left he said the whole
[1:11:02] church was crying in 1947 when he left
[1:11:05] for the field they loved him now this I
[1:11:09] don't know this might be his opinion I'm
[1:11:10] not sure I have to look at more quotes I
[1:11:12] I would personally believe think he'd be
[1:11:13] a successful pastor but I don't know I
[1:11:16] wasn't a successful Pastor never would
[1:11:18] be it says never because I haven't got
[1:11:21] the patience and what it takes to be a
[1:11:23] Pastor recently like I told you one of
[1:11:25] my friends left being a pastor went to
[1:11:27] evangelist because he said he didn't
[1:11:29] have the patience for it and he lasted
[1:11:30] eight years as a
[1:11:32] pastor and so that's part of it if you
[1:11:35] if you can do something then you know
[1:11:37] God's called you to do it if you can't
[1:11:39] do it then God probably hasn't called
[1:11:41] you to do that there's also a thing
[1:11:44] though also there's also how God can
[1:11:46] change a
[1:11:47] Ministry because St Paul for a while of
[1:11:50] course he was always a prophet but then
[1:11:51] the Bible said he pastored the church in
[1:11:53] EES Ephesus and then he Timothy was the
[1:11:56] pastor and then Paul he was Pastor for a
[1:11:58] while then Paul wrote second Timothy and
[1:12:00] said now do the work an
[1:12:02] evangelist so Ministries can change so
[1:12:05] that might be the case with my friend
[1:12:06] I'm not sure for certain but his own
[1:12:08] testimony said I couldn't handle it was
[1:12:10] too much pressure and things like that
[1:12:12] and uh when he told me I could
[1:12:13] understand why it was a lot of pressure
[1:12:14] it was some some real challenges he had
[1:12:16] to deal with in the church there things
[1:12:18] that I hope I never have to deal with by
[1:12:20] God's grace but but God knows what we
[1:12:23] have need
[1:12:24] amen so therefore if I tried to Pastor I
[1:12:27] would just be as far out as a pastor is
[1:12:30] trying to be an
[1:12:33] evangelist see what I mean you can see
[1:12:36] the way the Lord calls you by what
[1:12:37] position is in the body is there a
[1:12:41] question he says all right so I hope
[1:12:43] there's no questions amen now but if you
[1:12:46] have some you can always see me
[1:12:46] afterwards by God's grace uh now let's
[1:12:50] um I'm gonna look at my notes Here I
[1:12:52] think I may just skip ahead to the
[1:12:54] actual um nine gifts I want to kind of
[1:12:57] maybe spend more time on
[1:12:59] that yeah let me skip a few I'm going to
[1:13:01] skip this one because I went over this
[1:13:02] one your pre-service ministry makes it
[1:13:04] easier on the pastor to get into his
[1:13:06] gifts so this is the importance of why
[1:13:08] you need to come to church early and
[1:13:09] pray or pray up on Saturday night or
[1:13:11] pray up on Sunday morning before you
[1:13:12] come to
[1:13:13] church uh because the pastor's gift is
[1:13:15] dependent upon everybody else's if
[1:13:18] they're faithful to God if they're
[1:13:19] pulling brother mam said it's so
[1:13:22] important well I'll just read it I think
[1:13:23] it's just one yeah just one quote the
[1:13:24] Saints and their gifts shall have their
[1:13:26] place first to worship and come together
[1:13:28] which brings as I've said before the
[1:13:30] Spear of the Lord in the building for
[1:13:31] the pastor see if you're not praying it
[1:13:33] kind of hurts
[1:13:35] me does anybody here want to hurt me I
[1:13:39] hope not because I don't want to hurt
[1:13:40] you he says and it makes it much easier
[1:13:43] for the Holy Spirit to work through him
[1:13:45] then when a great spiritual meeting has
[1:13:49] just preceded now precede means to come
[1:13:52] before the church should have a
[1:13:54] spiritual meeting before the pastor
[1:13:55] comes to preach of course that's song
[1:13:57] service but also prayer
[1:13:59] beforehand and then the Holy Spirit gets
[1:14:01] into the word and teaches the word has
[1:14:05] just been manifested by the
[1:14:08] gifts all right now of course he's
[1:14:10] talking about praying before service the
[1:14:11] gifts man if the gifts manifest before
[1:14:13] service now I've never seen that myself
[1:14:15] I've seen gifts manifest at the end of
[1:14:17] service or after service but I've never
[1:14:19] seen gifts manifest before service at
[1:14:21] least that I can remember I could have
[1:14:23] forg
[1:14:24] um so this is what I'm saying this is
[1:14:26] something that the church needs to have
[1:14:28] a a burden to know their gift the church
[1:14:31] needs to have a a burden to help us all
[1:14:34] operate in the Holy Spirit we got to
[1:14:36] have a burden and it's not going to take
[1:14:38] more money it's going to take more
[1:14:40] sacrifice of your time in prayer let's
[1:14:42] say time in prayer ready time in prayer
[1:14:44] that's what that's how you get closer to
[1:14:46] God that's how your gift manifest time
[1:14:48] and prayer I don't have time but I could
[1:14:50] take you to Daniel where they came to
[1:14:52] Daniel and they said uh was it Daniel
[1:14:54] yeah it was Daniel all all of
[1:14:56] Nebuchadnezzar's uh wise men couldn't
[1:14:58] tell his dream and the King said I'm
[1:15:00] gonna kill everybody and Daniel said
[1:15:02] just a minute he said give me some time
[1:15:05] and I'll tell you thus sayi the
[1:15:08] Lord see he didn't have th sayith the
[1:15:10] Lord he knew if I'm going to get an
[1:15:11] interpretation of a dream I've got to
[1:15:13] have time I've got to consecrate I've
[1:15:15] got to get in the channel of the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost amen give me time I don't have it
[1:15:21] right now like that I just can't spew it
[1:15:23] out but if you give me time and I can go
[1:15:25] lay before the Lord and make my request
[1:15:26] made known to God God will move through
[1:15:28] the gift God will move through the
[1:15:29] channel and you'll get the thus say the
[1:15:31] Lord that you need now that's real Bible
[1:15:34] teaching praise the Lord time and prayer
[1:15:38] help the gifts operate now that's just
[1:15:39] in the local church right here when
[1:15:41] we're here but we're grateful we want to
[1:15:43] operate all the time at your home in
[1:15:45] your business don't you want to see
[1:15:46] Sinners get saved at your home or your
[1:15:48] business or your friend's house on the
[1:15:50] job at the school don't you want to see
[1:15:52] Sinners weep their way to to Calvary
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:56] glory but it takes time takes
[1:16:00] sacrifice got to be willing to do that
[1:16:04] and but as preachers we must teach on
[1:16:05] gifts in order to uh lose our ignorance
[1:16:08] toward
[1:16:10] gifts and this is what brother B said
[1:16:12] we're getting to the church ages now
[1:16:13] we're in the second Church age I'll
[1:16:15] start that on Wednesday Lord willing uh
[1:16:17] with irus and brother bam uh just uh
[1:16:19] Raves about the ministry of irus the
[1:16:21] Holy Spirit he Tau all the gifts of the
[1:16:24] Spirit and he said they were never
[1:16:25] without some powerful manifestation of
[1:16:27] the spirit because he taught on the
[1:16:29] gifts so that people knew what the gifts
[1:16:31] were he said now concerning spiritual
[1:16:33] gifts breth I would not have you
[1:16:36] ignorant so he don't want us to be
[1:16:38] ignorant he doesn't God doesn't want us
[1:16:40] to not know or understand the gifts and
[1:16:43] there's a quote I have from 1965 I wish
[1:16:44] I could pull it up I may in just a
[1:16:46] moment here maybe I'll try to pull that
[1:16:48] up where brother B he's out preaching
[1:16:50] out west I think or something like that
[1:16:52] and uh let me see if I can pull it up
[1:16:56] and a report comes in right before he
[1:16:58] preaches and said oh all the elders at
[1:17:00] my church uh were at a uh at a funeral
[1:17:04] home where somebody had died or maybe at
[1:17:06] the mortuary I'm not sure where they
[1:17:07] were at somebody just died I don't know
[1:17:08] if it at the hospital or somewhere like
[1:17:10] that some funeral home and they were
[1:17:13] going to embal a body and brother ramam
[1:17:15] said the Elders of the church said wait
[1:17:17] before you do that can we just pray one
[1:17:18] more time and he said they prayed and
[1:17:20] within a matter of minutes the dead
[1:17:22] person came back life and everybody
[1:17:24] claps and brother brother said that they
[1:17:26] believe that because they're taught that
[1:17:28] that all things are possible in their
[1:17:30] home church I'm just paraphrasing that's
[1:17:32] what he said because they're taught to
[1:17:34] believe those Miracles then they act
[1:17:36] upon it amen and then God vindicates
[1:17:39] their faith approves their faith and
[1:17:41] then does miracles in their midst
[1:17:43] hallelujah amen now just give me a
[1:17:45] moment here here you can start on this
[1:17:48] quote while I'm looking for the other
[1:17:49] one all right you can start reading that
[1:17:50] is that okay uh that'll be a bless
[1:17:53] blessing
[1:18:03] there I thought I might be able to pull
[1:18:05] it up real
[1:18:09] quick all right maybe I can't find
[1:18:12] it thought it was about deacons and so
[1:18:15] forth
[1:18:18] but all right that's why I think irius
[1:18:21] because you see had the the same faith
[1:18:23] that Paul and the disciples handed down
[1:18:25] that's why I believe that he was the
[1:18:26] angel of the Church of samna because he
[1:18:30] had the same scriptural teachings and
[1:18:32] the same scriptural teachings oh I love
[1:18:34] it upon the basis of God's word will
[1:18:37] produce the same thing every time if you
[1:18:40] just simply take God's formula and carry
[1:18:42] it out to the letter no matter what the
[1:18:43] churches say just follow it just the way
[1:18:45] it said it'll produce the same thing
[1:18:48] that's what irius did
[1:18:51] hallelujah amen
[1:18:54] so hope that was a blessing
[1:18:56] there let me just check one more time
[1:18:58] maybe I can get the key wordss here if
[1:19:00] it be God's grace to us today to be
[1:19:02] encouraged by that quote there it is
[1:19:04] choosing of a
[1:19:10] bride okay here it is paragraph 57 phone
[1:19:13] call just came in a while ago this
[1:19:15] morning a member of my church which is
[1:19:16] really a Baptist woman out Louisville
[1:19:18] she died early this morning in my church
[1:19:20] at home a real group of consecrated men
[1:19:22] look
[1:19:24] consecrated they must have been making
[1:19:26] sacrifices if they're consecrated unto
[1:19:28] God their time in prayer must have been
[1:19:30] assembled themselves together and went
[1:19:32] down together before the Undertaker and
[1:19:35] balmed her so there's a licensed State
[1:19:39] Undertaker there and they say hold on
[1:19:41] can we pray before for before you do
[1:19:43] your
[1:19:44] work stood over her and prayed until
[1:19:47] life come back in her and she is living
[1:19:50] tonight the Elders of my church why they
[1:19:53] had been taught to believe that all
[1:19:55] things are possible come to God
[1:19:58] sincerely amen glory we must believe
[1:20:02] that all things are
[1:20:04] possible we must pray and ask God to
[1:20:07] give us the grace to give us the faith
[1:20:09] show us what we're called to do and
[1:20:11] continually do it but when you're taught
[1:20:14] these things then you're more likely to
[1:20:16] act upon them how many you believe that
[1:20:18] just like if it teach a child to do
[1:20:19] wrong they're going to do wrong if you
[1:20:21] let them watch any filth they'll act all
[1:20:22] filthy but if you teach them to do right
[1:20:24] train them to do right they'll Act Right
[1:20:26] amen it's exactly right okay let's get
[1:20:30] to the nine gifts of the Spirit here I
[1:20:32] want to spend the bulk of my time on
[1:20:33] this and I got about 30 minutes left
[1:20:35] half my time okay praise the
[1:20:38] Lord everybody enjoying this by God's
[1:20:40] grace okay am I hurting anybody's
[1:20:41] feelings I hope not I hope I'm uh well
[1:20:45] if I'm doing that I hope it's to Humble
[1:20:47] everybody and to get the stubbornness
[1:20:49] out glory and help me to humble myself
[1:20:52] amen all of us need humbleness amen all
[1:20:54] of us need more of a sacrifice unto God
[1:20:57] so here's the nine gifts and they are in
[1:20:59] order from importance from the most
[1:21:02] important all the way down to the least
[1:21:04] or the most powerful down to the least
[1:21:06] powerful how many you understand that
[1:21:07] brother B said that brother calls it the
[1:21:09] routine of the Bible he said wisdom he
[1:21:12] said notice the routine of the Bible
[1:21:13] wisdom is the greatest gift because you
[1:21:15] need wisdom to manage all the others so
[1:21:18] wisdom is a
[1:21:20] manager all right let me take off my
[1:21:22] jacket I'm trying to get warm
[1:21:26] here now one of my desires church and I
[1:21:29] hope I hope everybody can understand
[1:21:30] this I'm trying to
[1:21:32] take I'm trying to do this I'm trying to
[1:21:34] take the Greek definition plus the Bible
[1:21:37] scriptures plus brother ad's quotes and
[1:21:39] apply this to the common man that's you
[1:21:42] and I that's
[1:21:45] myself because we can all easily
[1:21:47] recognize tongues interpretation
[1:21:48] prophecy we can just recognize that
[1:21:50] automatically I think don't you think we
[1:21:52] can just recognize that right away right
[1:21:54] away right away but some of these other
[1:21:56] ones uh Miracles we can recognize right
[1:21:58] away too uh Divine Healing too but I
[1:22:01] guess three of those or four of those
[1:22:02] might be a little unfamiliar to us and
[1:22:04] we don't want to be ignorant how many
[1:22:05] how many don't want to be ignorant of
[1:22:06] those gifts and I think if we can just
[1:22:08] shine a little more light on
[1:22:10] these and uh by God's grace be able to
[1:22:13] show you what they look like in the
[1:22:15] scripture I think it'll help you by the
[1:22:17] grace of the
[1:22:18] Lord and I want you to be helped because
[1:22:20] the last thing I want is people to leave
[1:22:22] out here and condemned or I don't have a
[1:22:23] gift I I don't know my
[1:22:25] gift I don't want you to be condemned I
[1:22:27] don't want you to be discouraged I want
[1:22:28] you to be
[1:22:29] encouraged if you have a question just
[1:22:30] go like this say well Lord praise the
[1:22:32] Lord I don't know my gift but if I pray
[1:22:35] and I sacrifice you'll show me my gift
[1:22:37] in life amen
[1:22:40] hallelujah don't you love Jesus amen my
[1:22:42] he's just oh he's everything to me
[1:22:44] praise God so number one the word of
[1:22:47] wisdom now see I'm going to go over this
[1:22:48] format to help you understand it and
[1:22:50] because it helped me I look at at the
[1:22:52] Greek definition now I want to say this
[1:22:55] too Greek definitions are not thus
[1:22:57] sayith the Lord Greek Lexicon is not
[1:23:00] thus sayith the Lord because I can click
[1:23:02] on a scripture and they'll say oh this
[1:23:04] word you know is related to the Trinity
[1:23:06] and God's three persons I'm like oh come
[1:23:08] on but what happened was that God
[1:23:11] allowed some man at some point to find
[1:23:13] the actual definitions of these English
[1:23:15] words uh and actually go back and find
[1:23:17] the Greek or Aramaic or Hebrew word and
[1:23:19] actually find the definitions of those
[1:23:21] words and they put their understanding
[1:23:24] uh to those words and in most case I
[1:23:26] would say this most cases they're right
[1:23:29] uh because it was led of God and you can
[1:23:31] say how can you say that brother Jesse
[1:23:32] because when brother brandham preached
[1:23:34] the Masterpiece and when brother Bram
[1:23:36] preached others uh quotes about uh Jesus
[1:23:39] and how he was in the image of God the
[1:23:41] amorph what scripture what sermon was
[1:23:43] that in the morphe was it the
[1:23:44] Masterpiece the amorph remember the
[1:23:45] amorph how many raise raise your hand if
[1:23:47] you remember that Mor I need to look
[1:23:48] that up sister Donna thank you brother
[1:23:50] Brandon preaches that and he uses a
[1:23:52] Greek definition and then he goes and
[1:23:54] and he preaches it elsewhere and later
[1:23:56] on tape I have to look it up but later
[1:23:58] on tape I could find you the quotes
[1:24:00] later he goes somewhere else and he
[1:24:01] preaches in Morp again how the word form
[1:24:04] meant a Morp it meant God changing his
[1:24:06] mask and he said a Greek Theologian or
[1:24:09] Theologian comes up and says brother
[1:24:11] Brandon you were LED of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:12] you don't even know Greek and Hebrew but
[1:24:14] that's exactly the definition that it is
[1:24:17] so even brother Braham God came to
[1:24:18] vindicate brother Braham you use the
[1:24:20] right definition of that Greek word amen
[1:24:23] so see there's a there's a an
[1:24:24] inspiration behind the Greek but again
[1:24:27] because it's written by man you got to
[1:24:29] sift through it by the Holy Spirit like
[1:24:32] I had somebody last well a few weeks ago
[1:24:35] say brother brandom or say brother Jesse
[1:24:37] if brother brandom if you if you've got
[1:24:39] to sift through brother bram's quotes
[1:24:40] how could he be a prophet how can you
[1:24:43] even know if it was thus sayth the Lord
[1:24:44] because she was telling me every word
[1:24:45] brother Bram said was thus sayith the
[1:24:47] Lord she said if every word he said
[1:24:50] wasn't thus sayith the Lord how do you
[1:24:51] know what's right I said that's simple
[1:24:53] brother B said told us to take it back
[1:24:54] to the
[1:24:55] word take it back to the word it's got
[1:24:57] to have two or three Witnesses if it
[1:24:59] don't if it's got to thus say the Lord
[1:25:01] behind it you know it's right and the
[1:25:03] church said so see that's the deception
[1:25:06] of the Antichrist Spirit Well I don't
[1:25:07] know how to rightly you're not you might
[1:25:10] not be called to rightly divide the word
[1:25:11] but there is somebody who's called to do
[1:25:13] that Amen brother Ram interpreted the
[1:25:15] word just like Paul did then told
[1:25:16] Timothy you rightly divide it amen the
[1:25:19] prophet interprets it and then the
[1:25:21] preachers rightly divide
[1:25:23] amen why because it's the same Spirit on
[1:25:25] brother brandom now is on the fivefold
[1:25:27] ministry today to get a bride ready for
[1:25:29] Christ amen hallelujah amen it's not a
[1:25:32] second or different spirit it's the same
[1:25:34] holy spirit amen it's exactly right and
[1:25:37] they say how can you know it's th say
[1:25:39] the Lord you take it back to the
[1:25:41] word you're led by The Same Spirit now I
[1:25:45] didn't mean to get all emotional on that
[1:25:46] I just guess I felt kind of burdened
[1:25:48] about that but see it's an antichrist
[1:25:51] spirit that makes every word he says
[1:25:52] thus say the Lord Brother brandom said
[1:25:54] that brother brandom said he said the he
[1:25:56] said you want to know one of the
[1:25:57] awfulest things I think brother Kevin
[1:25:59] and Marie were here when I read that on
[1:26:00] that Wednesday night service they came
[1:26:01] he said you want to know one of the most
[1:26:03] a awfulest things there is is to say
[1:26:05] that I'm infallible brother R said he
[1:26:06] said that's a bunch of Tommy
[1:26:08] rat praise God so what Spirit would that
[1:26:11] come from what's the Tommy rot Spirit
[1:26:13] that's not the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:26:14] Unholy Spirit that's the Antichrist so I
[1:26:17] guess that Spirit just Rises up at me
[1:26:19] and just uh hates that Antichrist Spirit
[1:26:21] but that's what Jesus said you hate the
[1:26:23] same Deeds of nicadan that I hate Jesus
[1:26:26] and I both love the same things and we
[1:26:28] hate the same things amen that's the
[1:26:30] real Church of God now let me get to
[1:26:33] this if I can
[1:26:35] Mercy the word of wisdom the Greek CS
[1:26:38] wisdom skill in the management of your
[1:26:42] Affairs so how you manage your life your
[1:26:44] decisions see if you see somebody who's
[1:26:46] unskillful they keep falling into sin
[1:26:48] they keep hurting people they keep doing
[1:26:50] evil they don't have wisdom but when you
[1:26:52] see someone who walks in the wisdom of
[1:26:54] the Holy Spirit and takes God's ways
[1:26:56] rather than man's ways that's wisdom of
[1:26:58] the holy
[1:26:59] spirit it's discretion in imparting
[1:27:03] truth well this is the actual truth here
[1:27:06] I know there's there's all these things
[1:27:07] out here but actually this is
[1:27:10] truth now the Bible said wisdom is
[1:27:13] declared through works or
[1:27:16] actions Jesus said uh wisdom is
[1:27:18] Justified over children that's what it
[1:27:19] means Justified means declare wisdom is
[1:27:22] Justified or declared through its
[1:27:24] actions so that will always show you if
[1:27:26] you're walking in wisdom if you do a
[1:27:28] sinful action that wasn't the W wisdom
[1:27:29] of God if you get ahead of God like
[1:27:31] David did with the cart that's not the
[1:27:34] wisdom of God but when you wait on God
[1:27:36] and the timing of God and the channel of
[1:27:37] God that's
[1:27:40] wisdom wisdom tells you what to do with
[1:27:42] Bible knowledge because the Bible said
[1:27:44] in Proverbs 9:1 wisdom hath builded her
[1:27:48] house wisdom builds the house the
[1:27:51] materials are not know we get to that
[1:27:52] the materials that you have to build
[1:27:54] with are knowledge but it's wisdom that
[1:27:56] builds it wisdom puts this here that
[1:27:58] material there and forms a beautiful uh
[1:28:02] perfectly leveled perfectly prepared
[1:28:04] house amen wisdom builds the house and
[1:28:06] let me say like this wisdom builds this
[1:28:08] church Hallelujah wisdom should build
[1:28:10] bride of Christ Fellowship or the Lord
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ Tabernacle or Living Waters
[1:28:14] Tabernacle wisdom must build the house
[1:28:17] we must direct uh instruct and teach
[1:28:20] truth and teach the the the people of
[1:28:22] God to manage theirs Affairs by the Holy
[1:28:25] Spirit
[1:28:27] Hallelujah and a wise man or wise virgin
[1:28:31] builds their house upon a rock the word
[1:28:34] Christ
[1:28:36] Jesus brother manam said wisdom is the
[1:28:38] best gift of the group so let's read
[1:28:41] that I restore 1957 now if you notice
[1:28:44] the routine of the gifts the first gift
[1:28:46] is a gift of wisdom thank you brother B
[1:28:49] says the first is I'm sorry the first is
[1:28:51] the GI GI to wisdom that is the best
[1:28:53] gift of the group and if we don't have
[1:28:56] wisdom we won't know how to use
[1:28:58] knowledge is the second
[1:29:00] gift and if we can't use the second gift
[1:29:02] without wisdom how are we going to use
[1:29:04] the last gift interpretation or next to
[1:29:06] last speaking in tongues our Zeals eat
[1:29:08] up our wisdom or our Zeal for
[1:29:10] denominations and our enthusiasm has eat
[1:29:12] up the wisdom off the vine brotherly
[1:29:18] love praise God now let me get to this
[1:29:21] text message that was sent to me on
[1:29:23] Friday night I was really tired I got
[1:29:24] home from work well I had a quite a week
[1:29:26] here by God's grace but we're making it
[1:29:28] by the grace of the Lord but I just I
[1:29:30] want to show you I want to encourage you
[1:29:31] with this because this is for the Common
[1:29:32] Man the common the common
[1:29:35] Christian how many feel like you're just
[1:29:36] a common average Christian right you're
[1:29:38] not maybe you're not like a prophet
[1:29:40] you're not like a a pastor of a mega
[1:29:42] church or you know like evangelist who's
[1:29:44] a worldwide evangelist how many feel
[1:29:45] just like a common Christian that's how
[1:29:47] I feel I'm just a common everyday
[1:29:49] Christian maybe a one Talent preacher
[1:29:51] right
[1:29:53] now the question was uh for this brother
[1:29:56] another brother kind of uh approached
[1:29:58] him and said uh he shouldn't do certain
[1:30:00] certain sports with his
[1:30:03] children and uh and the brother was
[1:30:06] really hurt and came to me and said you
[1:30:07] know what do you think about this what
[1:30:08] do you think about this I just kind of
[1:30:11] waited on the Lord I kept washing dishes
[1:30:12] for a while and just thinking about it
[1:30:14] like man because if if if I'm wrong then
[1:30:16] I I don't want to be wrong because I do
[1:30:17] I do Taekwondo with my son Malachi and I
[1:30:20] know a lot of people that their sons do
[1:30:21] baseball or basketball or football
[1:30:25] right and you got to also put in there
[1:30:27] message volleyball
[1:30:28] games because that's Sports too right so
[1:30:33] this is a a pretty in-depth question and
[1:30:36] so I just waited and waited and I just
[1:30:37] kind of felt like
[1:30:39] a uh kind like a confidence I don't know
[1:30:42] I just kind of felt like I like a
[1:30:44] courage I just had to answer this you
[1:30:46] know I believe it was the Holy Spirit
[1:30:48] and so this the quote started coming to
[1:30:50] me brother Bram said God gave me a a
[1:30:52] sport of hunting and
[1:30:54] fishing and then brother brandham said
[1:30:57] Charlie Cox said brother brandham we
[1:30:58] love hunting so much will we squirrel
[1:31:00] hunt in the Millennium and brother R
[1:31:03] said no because nothing will die in the
[1:31:05] Millennium and he said but we love
[1:31:07] squirrel hunting so much and brother man
[1:31:10] said can you imagine a pig being changed
[1:31:12] into a man and then wanting to go back
[1:31:13] and doing the things that a pig did he
[1:31:16] said that's how we'll feel we'll have
[1:31:18] brand new bodies we won't want to go
[1:31:19] back to hunting squirrels
[1:31:22] because that's what pigs do you
[1:31:24] understand the illustration you
[1:31:26] understand
[1:31:27] that and then I have a a shared of quote
[1:31:29] where uh brother Ram said oh he said how
[1:31:31] I love to hunt and fish but one minute
[1:31:34] in this presence he said it's better
[1:31:36] than all that hunting and fishing one
[1:31:39] minute and this is at the end of a
[1:31:40] service where they're worshiping and
[1:31:41] praising God so brother baham said God
[1:31:44] gave him a sport now I don't know about
[1:31:46] you but when you shoot an animal you
[1:31:48] kill it right you actually take its life
[1:31:52] away from
[1:31:55] it and it's called a sport and you kill
[1:31:59] something but this is the wisdom of God
[1:32:02] that came to me you can do a sport and
[1:32:05] not have the spirit of the
[1:32:08] sport what do I mean by that we've all
[1:32:10] seen it you've seen volleyball games
[1:32:11] you've seen people trying to play
[1:32:12] volleyball and they're not in the spirit
[1:32:13] of
[1:32:15] it they won't jump they won't dive all
[1:32:17] over the floor to try to get the next
[1:32:19] bump over the over the net they won't
[1:32:21] even jump to spike it you've all seen
[1:32:23] baseball players that don't want to
[1:32:24] swing to batter or you've seen
[1:32:25] basketball players that don't really
[1:32:26] want to be
[1:32:28] there why because they're not in the
[1:32:30] spirit of it and yet now I can show you
[1:32:33] quotes brother man said there's so many
[1:32:34] white you know in this case he was using
[1:32:35] white men white men that go out there
[1:32:37] and hunt elephant and he said they've
[1:32:39] got the spirit of murder on them because
[1:32:42] they just kill for fun how many remember
[1:32:44] some of those quotes I can show them to
[1:32:46] them if you want nobody remembers those
[1:32:47] okay well a couple all right well I can
[1:32:50] show them to you if you want them so
[1:32:51] what am I saying brother Brandon can go
[1:32:53] hunting and not get in the spirit of
[1:32:55] murder while other men can go out there
[1:32:57] go hunting and get in the spirit of
[1:33:00] murder praise
[1:33:03] God it's a sport hunting is a sport he
[1:33:06] can now listen he can literally kill an
[1:33:08] animal take its life and he's not in the
[1:33:11] spirit of
[1:33:13] murder and the church said
[1:33:17] amen that's why I can go out with my son
[1:33:20] I can take a football that I used to
[1:33:21] worship used to not anymore I can throw
[1:33:24] him a ball or he and I can go shoot
[1:33:25] hoops and I don't get in the spirit like
[1:33:27] oh I'm going to really let me run him
[1:33:30] over I'll stiff arm him and I'll show
[1:33:31] him really how to do it that'd be
[1:33:35] foolish why because I'm not in the
[1:33:37] spirit of
[1:33:39] it yes I agree the spirit of basketball
[1:33:42] that the spirit of football that wants
[1:33:43] to idolize people is from hell I can say
[1:33:46] Amen to that but if you're just playing
[1:33:48] the sport and you're not in the spirit
[1:33:50] of it and you're just doing it for
[1:33:51] exercise or passing time is that a sin
[1:33:54] because if so then brother Ram was
[1:33:55] sinning when he was
[1:33:57] hunting because he's doing a
[1:34:00] sport now we know he did that what to
[1:34:03] get time with God he said but also to
[1:34:05] rest his
[1:34:07] mind so I shared these things and there
[1:34:09] was other other quotes too I Shar with
[1:34:11] him
[1:34:15] um and brother BR would say he' go to a
[1:34:17] baseball game he said somebody hit a
[1:34:19] grand slam he said somebody gets so
[1:34:20] excited they would pull up their hat and
[1:34:22] pull it down on their head and their
[1:34:24] their their their hat would rip and
[1:34:25] their hat would go around their neck and
[1:34:27] he looked at another person and he said
[1:34:28] brother BR aren't you excited he said no
[1:34:30] he said because I'm not in the spirit of
[1:34:34] baseball he said because you're not in
[1:34:36] the spirit of it so see everything
[1:34:38] carries a spirit and I just sent these
[1:34:40] you know right away as quick as I could
[1:34:41] find them I was on my phone there going
[1:34:42] fast as I could sending these quotes toh
[1:34:44] this brother this the this brother in
[1:34:46] the Lord who we
[1:34:48] love and I said it's the same thing for
[1:34:51] me I go to uh go work out Taekwondo it's
[1:34:54] just three hours a week I go there for
[1:34:56] one purpose to
[1:34:57] exercise and I said I can punch
[1:35:01] people understand this now I can punch
[1:35:04] them not in their face I can punch them
[1:35:07] on their pad and I don't get in the
[1:35:10] spirit of
[1:35:11] it and God is my honest witness he's my
[1:35:17] witness and I don't even I just do it to
[1:35:19] do it I can kick people I can do a
[1:35:23] roundhouse or front kick I can break
[1:35:25] boards like we do sometimes Malai we
[1:35:27] break boards I'm not trying to be a
[1:35:30] murderer I'm not trying to kill people
[1:35:32] and yet I'm not even killing people but
[1:35:34] if you hunt you do kill
[1:35:36] animals
[1:35:38] amen and I can do just like I can shoot
[1:35:40] a basketball and not have to be Michael
[1:35:42] Jordan I used to want to do that I used
[1:35:45] to want to be all these guys and it just
[1:35:47] to kill me if I couldn't and then I
[1:35:49] finally got to dunk and I oh I'm close
[1:35:50] now then I got
[1:35:52] hurt you know how that
[1:35:55] goes see you can do something and not
[1:35:57] get in the spirit of
[1:36:00] it because if you condemn Taekwondo or
[1:36:03] if you condemn football you got to
[1:36:04] condemn all of them because they're all
[1:36:06] sports it's all
[1:36:09] competition and the brother wrote me
[1:36:11] back and this is what he said he
[1:36:13] said great brother looks like the Lord
[1:36:15] has really given you some great wisdom
[1:36:18] so I just thought I'd stop on that one
[1:36:20] see because wisdom manages your Affairs
[1:36:23] and if people come to me condemn me
[1:36:24] that's fine I know what brother Bram
[1:36:25] said I know what the word
[1:36:27] said now his concern was am I causing
[1:36:30] somebody somebody to fall so I said go
[1:36:32] ask him uh
[1:36:34] say we if my family is doing these
[1:36:37] Sports is it causing you to stumble
[1:36:38] because stumble means to get weak and to
[1:36:40] perish to leave Christ is this is what
[1:36:44] I'm doing really causing you to get weak
[1:36:47] and sin and go back in the world and the
[1:36:49] brother was honest and S back and text
[1:36:51] and said no I really wasn't talking
[1:36:53] about sports I was just concerned
[1:36:55] because you're not spending enough time
[1:36:56] with your
[1:36:57] children which didn't make any sense to
[1:37:00] anybody and so see when you bring the
[1:37:03] truth and you bring the word and then
[1:37:04] you start uh asking questions to the
[1:37:07] person that's accusing your
[1:37:10] consern you have the spirit of
[1:37:13] Truth so that's one that's just one
[1:37:16] testimony I want to give because this
[1:37:17] just happened the other night this just
[1:37:18] happened on Friday
[1:37:20] night
[1:37:21] wisdom is declared through its
[1:37:23] actions praise the
[1:37:26] Lord and Malachi is my witness before
[1:37:28] every uh what do we do before every
[1:37:30] practice and every test what do we
[1:37:32] do we join hands and pray in the name of
[1:37:35] Jesus Christ and say if anybody says and
[1:37:37] this is happen we pray if if anybody
[1:37:39] sees we're good at anything may we give
[1:37:40] God the glory one time one time we
[1:37:42] prayed that and somebody comes up to
[1:37:44] Malachi says afterwards they said
[1:37:45] Malachi my you kicking so good and
[1:37:47] Malachi said God just gave me that
[1:37:50] gift so he doesn't get the glory he
[1:37:53] doesn't get glorified God gets the
[1:37:55] glory see there's a balance for
[1:37:58] everything remember I prayed two or
[1:37:59] three years saying what do I put my son
[1:38:00] in and now Malachi doesn't almost every
[1:38:02] time he talks about God almost every
[1:38:03] practice doesn't he our Master almost
[1:38:06] every time he's talking about faith or
[1:38:07] God or something like that so see it's
[1:38:10] wisdom that that's what I'm that's what
[1:38:12] that's what I believe that's just my
[1:38:13] testimony so I just want to share that
[1:38:14] by God's grace now number two word of
[1:38:17] knowledge now this might be one of the
[1:38:19] most um gifts that we're most ignorant
[1:38:22] of and I would say for me
[1:38:24] too when brother bandam uses words of
[1:38:26] knowledge he often relates it to a
[1:38:30] prophet because knowledge is
[1:38:32] understanding so a gift of knowledge
[1:38:34] would help you understand
[1:38:35] something but it's by the
[1:38:38] word it's by the word God's going to
[1:38:41] give you an understanding of something
[1:38:43] but you got to have word behind
[1:38:45] it okay so that's what it means
[1:38:47] understanding or knowledge means a
[1:38:49] general intelligence or understanding
[1:38:51] the deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:38:53] knowledge of this religion such as
[1:38:54] belong to the more advanced especially
[1:38:56] of things un lawful and unlawful for
[1:39:00] Christians word of knowledge and I think
[1:39:02] more people have gifts of wisdom and
[1:39:03] knowledge than what they realize I
[1:39:05] really do the Bible calls knowledge is a
[1:39:08] key the Bible said knowledge is a key I
[1:39:10] keep twisting this up brother Loris was
[1:39:12] trying to help me which way do I twist
[1:39:13] that brother I'm trying to get untangled
[1:39:15] here a key or understanding that allows
[1:39:18] one to enter into the will of God you
[1:39:20] can look up all those scriptures I can
[1:39:21] email this if you want that's what a
[1:39:23] gift of uh under uh gift of knowledge
[1:39:25] does it gives you an understanding to do
[1:39:27] the will of God it gives you the
[1:39:29] understanding to enter into a promise of
[1:39:31] God you couldn't enter into before
[1:39:33] that's the gift of knowledge in other
[1:39:35] words you know the scripture now you
[1:39:36] know the exact scripture you need to
[1:39:38] enter into this relationship or enter
[1:39:40] into this thing this this desire and it
[1:39:43] Al also the Bible said gives you
[1:39:44] knowledge to escape sin in second Peter
[1:39:47] 2:20 so the gift of knowledge will
[1:39:49] operate also to keep you out of sin
[1:39:52] it'll give you a Biblical
[1:39:55] understanding for example in my life it
[1:39:57] was with quitting tobacco when I first
[1:39:58] came in the message I always wondered
[1:40:00] how can I quit this I told you know
[1:40:02] Chris and I just got engaged in 200000
[1:40:04] must have been 2002 and I said honey I
[1:40:07] said I love you so happy to marry you
[1:40:09] but I said I don't know if I'll ever be
[1:40:10] able to quit chewing tobacco before I
[1:40:12] started preaching before anything and
[1:40:14] then I came across 1 Corinthians 6 6:12
[1:40:19] which is this
[1:40:22] all things are lawful unto me but all
[1:40:24] things are not expedient all things are
[1:40:25] lawful to me but I will not be brought
[1:40:27] under the power of any when I heard that
[1:40:30] scripture and read that it was like
[1:40:31] bright lights went off in my
[1:40:34] heart you know it's lawful to have
[1:40:37] chewin
[1:40:38] tobacco now it's GNA kill you with
[1:40:39] cancer like it killed Tony Gwyn the Hall
[1:40:41] of Fame baseball player it killed him
[1:40:44] who cares now if he has 3,000 hits he's
[1:40:46] dead because tobacco killed him cancer
[1:40:53] but when I read I these things are
[1:40:55] lawful these things uh uh right here but
[1:40:58] I will not be brought under the power of
[1:41:00] chewing tobacco so I started looking at
[1:41:01] a can of chewing tobacco as a demon I
[1:41:05] thought how can this little 4 inch uh
[1:41:08] cylinder or whatever it was how can this
[1:41:09] 4 inch cylinder this yeah cylinder how
[1:41:12] can this have power for me and then I
[1:41:13] started having a lot of faith rise up in
[1:41:15] me amen because the scripture says I I
[1:41:18] don't have to be brought under that
[1:41:19] power the power of Satan was working
[1:41:22] through that and working in me but then
[1:41:24] as I saw this scripture I realized I
[1:41:25] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:41:27] that's in the world and I can cast down
[1:41:29] that power I've got a power greater than
[1:41:30] that demon
[1:41:32] amen and that's what's what did it the
[1:41:34] word of
[1:41:35] knowledge I don't know if I heard that
[1:41:37] preach or if it's just in my own study
[1:41:39] but this gave me understanding to enter
[1:41:41] into full Deliverance praise
[1:41:43] God now brother Bram said this a gift of
[1:41:47] knowledge now here's where he's been
[1:41:48] applying it to a prophet he said a gift
[1:41:50] of know is like an attorney who studies
[1:41:53] the
[1:41:54] books which is the Bible to present your
[1:41:57] case before the judge soam lyans the
[1:41:59] gift of knowledge someone who has a lot
[1:42:01] of knowledge we got any book smart
[1:42:03] people in here I imagine Brother Scott
[1:42:04] would be real good on this one he
[1:42:06] studies all those books and uh sister Bo
[1:42:08] did biology and I'm sure some of the
[1:42:10] brothers did a lot of
[1:42:11] studying but if your book smart that
[1:42:13] that's kind of like it may be an
[1:42:15] indication that they might have a gift
[1:42:16] of knowledge because the gift of
[1:42:18] knowledge goes back to the book
[1:42:21] Hallelujah the gift of knowledge goes
[1:42:24] back like an attorney to God's book
[1:42:26] studies the book and then presents
[1:42:28] knowledge or understanding of the word
[1:42:31] and presents the case
[1:42:33] Hallelujah here's where bam says it
[1:42:36] 1957 a prophet is also a gift of
[1:42:39] knowledge a knowledge is like an
[1:42:40] attorney so now he just describes
[1:42:42] knowledge knowledge is like an attorney
[1:42:43] who studies the books how many like to
[1:42:45] study books anybody in here like to okay
[1:42:47] it might be a channel but you got to be
[1:42:49] consecrated to it
[1:42:51] right you got to have prayer like you
[1:42:53] said you got to sacrifice time got to
[1:42:55] sacrifice
[1:42:56] prayer I wna I want to be led more of
[1:42:58] God I've got to sacrifice time in prayer
[1:43:01] and give myself to these things that the
[1:43:03] people may benefit don't you want to be
[1:43:05] a benefit to everybody here at the
[1:43:06] church your gifts were given to you to
[1:43:09] profit every man and woman in this
[1:43:11] church and the church said you your
[1:43:13] gifts all your gifts were given to
[1:43:15] profit this entire church with all so
[1:43:19] brother bam said all n spiritual gifts
[1:43:21] should be operating and moving praise
[1:43:23] God we're not discouraged if we don't
[1:43:25] see them all yet because we still got
[1:43:26] time to serve the Lord amen and perhaps
[1:43:28] there might be a reason he might not
[1:43:30] want this gift at our church might not I
[1:43:31] don't know but we must be willing to be
[1:43:34] led of God and we must sacrifice in
[1:43:36] order to see God what gifts do you have
[1:43:38] in the church what can we do for your
[1:43:40] glory
[1:43:41] amen because remember you're supposed to
[1:43:43] covet the follow charity and desire the
[1:43:45] best gifts
[1:43:48] Hallelujah so this is the gift of
[1:43:50] knowledge somebody who can study this
[1:43:51] Bible right here and when you go to hire
[1:43:53] an attorney to plead your case he's only
[1:43:55] taking what he knows there's the knows
[1:43:58] knowledge I know it I know it I've read
[1:44:00] it to present your case before the
[1:44:05] judge and now gift of knowledge in the
[1:44:07] Bible is prophecy which goes up and
[1:44:09] finds out things that are to come and
[1:44:11] brings them that back down now the
[1:44:12] reason I'm we I have to say this the
[1:44:15] gift of knowledge has to be separate
[1:44:17] from prophecy they have to be separate
[1:44:18] gifts because the Bible list them as
[1:44:20] separate
[1:44:21] but I'm seeing I'm showing how brother
[1:44:22] brandom a lot of times puts them
[1:44:24] together they can be used together
[1:44:25] aren't many gifts used together
[1:44:27] knowledge and wisdom are almost always
[1:44:28] used together in the Bible you can look
[1:44:30] up there's like 50 scriptures where
[1:44:31] knowledge and wisdom are together
[1:44:33] there's like 50 scriptures where oil and
[1:44:34] wine are together there's just gifts
[1:44:37] that operate together like Divine
[1:44:38] Healing and miracles amen Divine Healing
[1:44:41] and miracles go together all the time
[1:44:42] Hallelujah watch which I'll show you
[1:44:44] brother Ram said brother Ram said this I
[1:44:46] do not have the gift of Miracles how
[1:44:47] many know he said that he said I do not
[1:44:50] have the gift of Miracles but because I
[1:44:52] have the gift of Divine Healing he said
[1:44:53] the angel Lord will do many miracles in
[1:44:55] our
[1:44:57] meetings see some gifts go together so
[1:45:00] this one obviously gift of knowledge
[1:45:02] goes often with
[1:45:03] prophecy because it's giving you an
[1:45:05] understanding it's helping you
[1:45:07] understand your case and it may foretell
[1:45:09] the
[1:45:10] future but you got to study the book
[1:45:13] praise God you got to study the book
[1:45:15] present your
[1:45:16] case he said but they must compare with
[1:45:19] the Bible with the book if they're out
[1:45:21] of the book then they're not received
[1:45:22] because the judge is the judge judges by
[1:45:24] the book you see it so it must be on the
[1:45:29] word praise God is that a help by God's
[1:45:32] grace gift of knowledge somebody who can
[1:45:35] study the book someone who can bring out
[1:45:37] the scriptures the keys that you need to
[1:45:39] enter into something enter into Ministry
[1:45:41] to enter into Divine Healing enter into
[1:45:43] the relationship or enter into these
[1:45:45] things these are all gifts of the Spirit
[1:45:47] and we need them all the time don't we
[1:45:49] especially if we're going to enter into
[1:45:50] a marriage or especially going to enter
[1:45:51] into having children or or when to stop
[1:45:53] having children you really need the Holy
[1:45:55] Spirit to do
[1:45:56] that Hallelujah you must be led of the
[1:45:58] Holy Spirit and this is where the gift
[1:46:00] of knowledge can be crucial because it
[1:46:02] gives you the understanding to enter
[1:46:03] into something to do something for the
[1:46:05] kingdom of
[1:46:07] God number three
[1:46:10] faith faith is a now the Greek is a
[1:46:13] conviction of the truth of anything it's
[1:46:14] a belief now the Bible definition is
[1:46:17] it's an inner substance so it's already
[1:46:19] inside of you praise
[1:46:22] God and it's an Evidence or
[1:46:25] proof like my like our Taekwondo guy was
[1:46:28] saying he he said oh faith faith is
[1:46:30] something you don't have evidence for
[1:46:31] and he's like you know I never lik that
[1:46:32] definition and I want to raise my hand
[1:46:33] but I didn't but I said faith is
[1:46:35] actually a substance it's actually
[1:46:36] something you have you actually have
[1:46:38] evidence when you have faith Hallelujah
[1:46:40] because the evidence is inside of you
[1:46:42] it's written in your soul hallelujah
[1:46:46] heyen it's the proof or evidence of
[1:46:49] God's will that moves mountains can be
[1:46:52] mountains of sin mountains of unbelief
[1:46:54] mountains of disease and makes all
[1:46:56] things
[1:46:57] possible brother ramam said that's a
[1:46:59] gift of faith they believe what they're
[1:47:02] going to receive when they ask for
[1:47:06] it Faith here's a good quote 1947 oh
[1:47:10] it's the first sermon he ever recorded
[1:47:12] faith is a gift of itself you may have a
[1:47:14] portion of it but there's a gift of
[1:47:16] faith that is why I've said in the past
[1:47:19] a gift of faith is just more faith than
[1:47:21] what normal normal Christians have it's
[1:47:24] more of the same Hallelujah just like a
[1:47:27] gift of wisdom is just more of the same
[1:47:29] because I can take you to Romans 12 and
[1:47:31] the Bible said God has given everyone a
[1:47:33] what a Measure of Faith everybody
[1:47:35] because that's the first step on the
[1:47:37] stature of perfect man faith faith
[1:47:40] virtue knowledge faith is the very first
[1:47:43] thing you receive oh he is Christ I know
[1:47:45] he's the Messiah I'm convicted it's in
[1:47:47] my heart I know I'm saved that's Faith
[1:47:49] everybody's got a portion of Faith but
[1:47:51] if you got the gift of faith you have a
[1:47:53] greater portion of
[1:47:54] Faith just like some of you people
[1:47:56] anoint the sick and pray for them and
[1:47:58] you have a
[1:47:59] result that isn't a gift of healing that
[1:48:02] is a portion of Faith but that isn't a
[1:48:04] direct gift of healing for there's only
[1:48:06] one direct gift of healing there's only
[1:48:08] one direct gift of
[1:48:10] faith there's only one direct gift of
[1:48:13] Miracles and so forth so that that's
[1:48:15] where we this is a little bit uh uh
[1:48:17] important too as you understand
[1:48:19] sometimes the gift of faith heals
[1:48:20] somebody instead of the gift of
[1:48:22] healing okay sometimes the gift of
[1:48:25] Miracles does a healing and not Faith or
[1:48:27] healing so that's a little deeper but I
[1:48:29] hope you understand that the gifts can
[1:48:32] overlap they can they can they can they
[1:48:34] can be used different gifts can be used
[1:48:35] to accomplish the same
[1:48:37] thing Glory so that's what I want to say
[1:48:40] gift of faith is just more of the
[1:48:43] same most of the ministers who preach
[1:48:45] Divine Healing are usually all that I've
[1:48:47] ever met are great teachers of the word
[1:48:50] some of them just have a great powerful
[1:48:51] Faith just lay hands on the people and
[1:48:53] scream out and make the enemy leave them
[1:48:55] now that's Faith that's a gift of
[1:48:58] faith they believe that they're going to
[1:49:00] receive what they ask for that's the
[1:49:02] reason they take a hold of it in that
[1:49:05] manner I admire men like that men like
[1:49:08] or Roberts and AA Allen and all the men
[1:49:10] of the field who has great ministry
[1:49:11] ministerial gifts of the Spirit to move
[1:49:13] in
[1:49:15] faith so when our little children like I
[1:49:18] was thinking about our little children
[1:49:19] when they pray for pray for each other
[1:49:20] and they they believe they're going to
[1:49:21] get
[1:49:22] healed what is that a gift of faith they
[1:49:26] just know God's going to answer don't
[1:49:28] you like that don't you want to feel
[1:49:29] like that I just know God's gonna hear
[1:49:32] me like that one time I prayed for
[1:49:34] Sister Lisa at the other church I just
[1:49:35] felt like I told the church I said I
[1:49:36] just feel like I was crying said I just
[1:49:38] feel like God heard her prayer and then
[1:49:40] God did hear the prayer it was about uh
[1:49:43] children and so forth like
[1:49:45] that you see it's a faith it just God
[1:49:49] reveals it he makes it known to us that
[1:49:51] he's going to that he heard our prayer
[1:49:53] Glory and number four this is a a a
[1:49:56] great one the gifts of healing we're
[1:49:58] familiar with it it's a means of healing
[1:50:01] Remedy or medicine the gift of
[1:50:04] healing and of course it can be prayer
[1:50:06] of prayer of faith speaking the word
[1:50:09] laying on of hands faith is required for
[1:50:11] healing so you must have a revelation
[1:50:13] it's God's will to heal you no matter
[1:50:15] how long it takes to manifest healing is
[1:50:17] the deliverance from the oppression of
[1:50:18] the devil because the Bible said Jesus
[1:50:19] was sent out to heal all those who are
[1:50:21] oppressed of the
[1:50:22] devil so sickness is often Devil's
[1:50:25] oppression Devil's torment healing comes
[1:50:28] through many means such as laying on of
[1:50:30] hands speaking the word and natural
[1:50:31] remedies just to name a few but there
[1:50:34] are so many channels of healing that's
[1:50:35] why there's a s gifts brother Ram says
[1:50:38] there's so many ways to be healed like
[1:50:40] he said a box of chocolates could cast a
[1:50:42] demon off of wife you know that brings
[1:50:45] healing right is that
[1:50:48] right it's true she just needed to see
[1:50:52] that he loved
[1:50:55] me that's really
[1:50:57] something uh it could be anything like I
[1:51:00] said it was figs in one case in the
[1:51:02] Bible with Hezekiah it was figs Isaiah
[1:51:03] said go get some figs and rub it on you
[1:51:05] and three days later he was healed
[1:51:07] figs so that's why sometimes if somebody
[1:51:09] uses a herb or oil or something like
[1:51:12] that it could be God God's
[1:51:16] Channel now we don't put any virtue in
[1:51:18] the Fig right we don't put any virtue in
[1:51:21] the the prayer cloth right but it's what
[1:51:23] it represents praise God it represents
[1:51:26] that God heals through many different
[1:51:28] means and I'm going to trust him he's
[1:51:29] ging me something I can grab on to amen
[1:51:32] something I can
[1:51:33] believe now brother B said this there's
[1:51:36] no such thing as the gift of healing
[1:51:37] talk about one gift because it's in the
[1:51:40] plural it's gifts God works in many
[1:51:42] different ways to heal the sick how many
[1:51:44] believe that and this is the one we see
[1:51:46] most often I think in our churches thank
[1:51:48] God for that thank God
[1:51:51] I mean you might say there might be
[1:51:52] wisdom preach and I believe that I could
[1:51:53] go with that but as far as the gifts of
[1:51:55] the Spirit I think this is the one it's
[1:51:56] most easiest to see somebody comes up
[1:51:58] for prayer they're healed or they say
[1:52:00] pray for me I'm sick at home and they
[1:52:01] raise up in the next few minutes or
[1:52:03] something like that then we know God
[1:52:04] healed them praise God and we're
[1:52:06] thankful for that we're very thankful I
[1:52:09] just pass my hour so just give me uh I'm
[1:52:11] not going to set the timer okay just let
[1:52:12] me finish I'm almost at I'm almost at
[1:52:14] the end because I got just four five
[1:52:16] more gifts and then a few quotes now
[1:52:19] some of those who have the great gift in
[1:52:21] healing that's called Gifts of healing
[1:52:24] or gift of healing there's no such thing
[1:52:26] as the gift of healing because it's in
[1:52:27] the plural it's gifts God works in many
[1:52:29] different ways to heal the sick
[1:52:31] sometimes preaching the word heals the
[1:52:33] sick I'm very thankful to see that in my
[1:52:36] Ministry sometimes a neighbor sitting by
[1:52:39] so neighbors listen if you got a
[1:52:40] neighbor and just lay his hand over on
[1:52:43] you feel like he should do
[1:52:45] so always do that now brothers be
[1:52:49] careful F if it's not your wife right
[1:52:51] use
[1:52:52] wisdom ask your H ask the wife's husband
[1:52:55] to lay his hand on it praise
[1:52:59] God whatever a born again child of God
[1:53:02] feels to pray for the sick that's the
[1:53:04] Holy Spirit moving in you to do so no
[1:53:06] matter who's gonna pray for the person
[1:53:08] you go ahead and pray for them anyhow
[1:53:10] look what he said no Minister can heal
[1:53:12] you so see again it's not the person
[1:53:13] it's the gift there's no people who
[1:53:16] claim to people who claim to have the
[1:53:17] gifts of healing Gifts of healing don't
[1:53:18] mean you heal the people it only means
[1:53:20] you have faith in the word of God for
[1:53:22] healing amen so the gift of faith is for
[1:53:26] anything it could be healing but the
[1:53:28] gift of healing is Faith for healing
[1:53:31] amen and the gift of Miracles is Faith
[1:53:34] for spontaneous Miracle Allelujah that's
[1:53:37] what they are now remember these Remain
[1:53:39] the church until when the
[1:53:41] Rapture then God takes them out of the
[1:53:43] church right amen they're here they're
[1:53:46] amongst us we must sacrifice we must be
[1:53:49] in the channel for the Holy Spirit
[1:53:52] Hallelujah so they now doctors wouldn't
[1:53:54] do not talking about Saul and David Saul
[1:53:57] and he good they had a lot of doctors
[1:53:58] down there but they couldn't help him
[1:53:59] because of that spiritual condition so
[1:54:01] one of them man passed around him and
[1:54:02] seen a few places and said well we know
[1:54:04] where there's a Divine healer at why who
[1:54:07] would that be said Jesse's got a son
[1:54:10] back there he said yeah he's a Divine
[1:54:13] healer sure it was he healed by
[1:54:18] music you can be a Divine healer and
[1:54:20] heal heal through giving
[1:54:22] gifts praise God natural physical
[1:54:25] gifts you can heal through
[1:54:28] that amen that's what he did he had a
[1:54:31] gift of casting out evil
[1:54:34] spirits the Holy Ghost hadn't come in
[1:54:36] those days so he cast them out by music
[1:54:38] playing the words of the Lord the Lord
[1:54:39] is my shepherd I shall not want okay now
[1:54:41] we know that and it Disturbed the evil
[1:54:44] spirits so much that they left
[1:54:48] Saul they David was a Divine
[1:54:51] healer oh I love the message amen don't
[1:54:54] you love the word of God that was a
[1:54:56] channel to be a Divine Healing how many
[1:54:59] times have Brother loris's songs brought
[1:55:00] me to tears and worship and praise and
[1:55:04] sacrifice how many times how many times
[1:55:07] have a special bless you like this
[1:55:08] morning if it not it ought to help you
[1:55:11] something's wrong with you these songs
[1:55:13] are supposed to bless our hearts
[1:55:15] amen how can they not bless you you're
[1:55:17] going to go to heaven and spend the
[1:55:18] eternity listening to songs like that
[1:55:20] they need to bless us in other words we
[1:55:21] need to appreciate from them for what
[1:55:23] they are they're to bring healing to us
[1:55:24] they're to bring strength to us they're
[1:55:26] to bring courage to us they're encourage
[1:55:28] us to love the Lord
[1:55:31] more now I don't have the quote right
[1:55:33] here or I'm sorry I don't have the but
[1:55:34] here um I was showing brother Austin on
[1:55:36] the way here on Wednesday night I
[1:55:37] mentioned Lady Gaga I know I know she's
[1:55:39] an awful well at least right now she's
[1:55:41] in an awful awful condition I'm not
[1:55:42] going to say she but she's obviously
[1:55:44] moved by demons and I seen on Facebook
[1:55:47] where uh Franklin Graham Billy Graham's
[1:55:48] dad said that she sang God Bless America
[1:55:51] at the Super Bowl and I didn't watch the
[1:55:52] Super Bowl I don't think you should
[1:55:54] either but
[1:55:56] uh and I thought what a what a deceiver
[1:55:59] that
[1:56:00] is and I went and found the lyrics on
[1:56:02] Google search of her song called Judas
[1:56:05] she has a song called
[1:56:07] Judas and it says uh one of one of the
[1:56:10] songs says or one of the verses in the
[1:56:12] most biblical sense I am beyond
[1:56:14] repentance it
[1:56:18] says she calls herself a prostitute
[1:56:22] wretch Judas kiss me if I if
[1:56:26] offended and she says I Want to Love You
[1:56:29] demon of Judas that's the actual words
[1:56:31] are je Judas is the demon I cling to I
[1:56:33] cling
[1:56:35] to and there's so many more lyrics I'm
[1:56:37] not going to read the rest of it it's so
[1:56:38] awful but here look how it's so
[1:56:40] deceptive look how Satan's using music
[1:56:42] to capture the hearts of millions of
[1:56:44] Young Americans well even around the
[1:56:45] world she sings God Bless America
[1:56:47] everything's all right oh she must be
[1:56:49] okay and right through it's a demon
[1:56:51] singing God Bless America tell me it's
[1:56:53] not a demon singing
[1:56:55] that and here she is before singing
[1:56:58] about how she loves Judas and
[1:57:01] uh actually the end the song Ends by
[1:57:03] saying whoa whoa I'm in love with Judas
[1:57:05] whoa whoa I'm in love with Judas but I'm
[1:57:08] still in love with Judas baby it says
[1:57:10] and seeing God Bless America it's the
[1:57:12] same thing Elvis Presley was a modern
[1:57:13] day Judas exactly modern day Judas so
[1:57:16] that's the power of satanic music what
[1:57:18] about the power of holy ghost music to
[1:57:20] heal the saints of God Amen to lift our
[1:57:22] spirits to get us out of depression Amen
[1:57:25] to get us encouraged stirred up put on
[1:57:27] some Godly holy ghost music and get into
[1:57:29] it believe it sing along with it worship
[1:57:31] with it and God will bless you
[1:57:33] amen we so Overlook that one gift or the
[1:57:37] gift of the guitar the piano we Overlook
[1:57:39] that gift of Divine Healing laying right
[1:57:41] there just push play on your new Ben Ben
[1:57:44] n Rod
[1:57:45] CD right my
[1:57:49] I love things don't you love this word
[1:57:51] my I
[1:57:52] just oh we'll just be singing about it
[1:57:54] forever praise God in
[1:57:56] eternity number five is the working of
[1:57:58] Miracles which the Greek calls it faith
[1:58:00] in the power for performing miracles in
[1:58:02] the Bible Miracles are instant
[1:58:04] spontaneous manifestations of
[1:58:06] healing uh or provision I should have
[1:58:08] put that or provision because Jesus did
[1:58:10] Miracles frequently the Bible said when
[1:58:12] you multip multiply loaves of bread that
[1:58:14] was a miracle the Bible said cast out
[1:58:16] demons was a miracle the Bible said
[1:58:18] turning water into wine was a miracle
[1:58:20] the Bible said curing a boy with a
[1:58:21] life-threatening fever a fever was a
[1:58:24] miracle and the Bible said of course
[1:58:26] raising Lazarus back from the dead was a
[1:58:29] miracle brother B said maybe you might
[1:58:32] not have the spontaneous Faith to bring
[1:58:35] something just a miracle right to you
[1:58:38] you may not have that kind of
[1:58:43] Faith here's the
[1:58:45] quote well I'm sorry this a different
[1:58:47] quote here's where he says he does how
[1:58:49] to get the Miracles and I've told you
[1:58:51] God before has performed it and you be
[1:58:53] real reverent and keep your head bowed
[1:58:55] and when you hear my voice on this
[1:58:56] microphone say raise your head then I if
[1:58:58] anything should happen a miracle I have
[1:59:00] no controls of Miracles them them's what
[1:59:03] my gift is not
[1:59:06] Miracles my gift is healing all you
[1:59:08] understand that don't you there's nine
[1:59:10] spiritual gifts but many times the angel
[1:59:12] of God will perform
[1:59:16] Miracles think about how many gifts
[1:59:18] we're operating you know on brother
[1:59:19] brandom all those Faith gifts and Divine
[1:59:21] Healing
[1:59:22] gifts and and so just because Divine
[1:59:25] Healing was Opera people had Faith well
[1:59:26] I can operate my faith gift I can
[1:59:28] operate the miracle gift and they might
[1:59:29] even know they not even know they have
[1:59:31] those gifts but they begin operating
[1:59:32] when one gift starts manifesting the
[1:59:34] rest start operating Hallelujah if the
[1:59:37] people are in the same channel of the
[1:59:38] holy spirit all the gifts will begin
[1:59:40] operating
[1:59:41] Hallelujah exactly right maybe you might
[1:59:45] not have the spontaneous Faith to bring
[1:59:47] something just a miracle right to you
[1:59:49] you might may not have that kind of
[1:59:51] Faith but Jesus said if you have the
[1:59:53] faith like a mustard seed you can say
[1:59:55] the mountain be moved and by and by it
[1:59:56] will come to pass it wouldn't vanish
[1:59:58] away but by and by it would come to pass
[2:00:01] how many love that so if you if if you
[2:00:03] say well I don't have faith for a
[2:00:04] miracle just have faith just believe the
[2:00:07] word just keep confessing it he said
[2:00:10] because faith and unbelief won't mix and
[2:00:12] if you've got just the least little
[2:00:13] grain of Faith that's genuine Mustard
[2:00:15] Seed Faith and that won't move stay with
[2:00:17] it it'll bring you out
[2:00:21] Hallelujah here's another one right here
[2:00:24] 1950 now some people have faith like
[2:00:27] this some has got that much I guess he
[2:00:29] must be moving his arms or his fingers
[2:00:31] some has that much and some can go Plum
[2:00:34] over their heads in the Miracles see how
[2:00:37] much Faith you got you got this much
[2:00:39] this much this much or Plum over your
[2:00:42] head in the
[2:00:43] Miracles how much Faith do you got amen
[2:00:46] if you got faith for miracles then God
[2:00:48] gave that to you to glorify
[2:00:49] his word glorify
[2:00:55] himself that's beautiful praise the Lord
[2:00:58] now does that help by God's grace I've
[2:01:00] just seen a few Miracles but like I said
[2:01:02] I don't know if it's through me now
[2:01:03] remember I I told you I had a brother
[2:01:04] from Columbus said three times while I
[2:01:06] was preaching in 2012 or 13 He said I am
[2:01:10] going to use Jesse for miracles and he
[2:01:11] shook it off and said I'm gonna use
[2:01:12] Jesse for many miracles I'm me it's the
[2:01:14] third time and so he had to come tell me
[2:01:15] he was all trembling after service at
[2:01:17] the park and he'd come up and tell me he
[2:01:19] said God told me three times he's going
[2:01:21] to use you for miracles so I'm just
[2:01:22] waiting on it I haven't seen it lately
[2:01:24] but I'm just waiting on it by God's
[2:01:25] grace if it's of God it will have to
[2:01:27] come to pass if it's not it won't come
[2:01:29] to pass but that doesn't hurt me at all
[2:01:31] I'm pressing on the upward way I'm
[2:01:34] gaining new heights every day praise God
[2:01:36] and it'll be God's will so I still feel
[2:01:39] pulled to the mission field sometimes
[2:01:40] I've seen Miracles over there like the
[2:01:41] man with arthritis he was just instantly
[2:01:43] healed there he started walking and
[2:01:45] praising and jumping God around there in
[2:01:46] South America and the woman healed of
[2:01:48] the the kidney stone that was such a
[2:01:50] wonderful Miracle right happened right
[2:01:52] away thankful for God's grace okay
[2:01:55] 678910 or 6789 sorry prophecy now some
[2:01:58] of these we know so I'm going to go kind
[2:02:00] of faster through these prophecy is
[2:02:02] foretelling future events knowledge of
[2:02:04] future events that strengthens convinces
[2:02:06] Comforts and judges in the scripture
[2:02:09] prophecy does all that it can do all
[2:02:12] that now how many ever had a dream that
[2:02:14] come to pass it might have been God
[2:02:16] anointing you to prophesy
[2:02:21] now you might not have told anybody
[2:02:22] because you didn't maybe understand it
[2:02:24] but now if you know it's a channel now
[2:02:25] if you know it's a channel that God can
[2:02:27] get
[2:02:27] into then you want to say God help me to
[2:02:30] use it to glorify you to it can be a
[2:02:32] blessing to somebody it can Comfort
[2:02:34] somebody sometimes prophecies Comfort
[2:02:36] sometimes prophecies judge they forell a
[2:02:38] judgment upon somebody sometimes they
[2:02:40] strengthen or convince people that God's
[2:02:42] real because they foretell
[2:02:45] events brother bam said okay now A Dream
[2:02:48] Is interpreted then becomes a vision is
[2:02:49] prophecy there's a difference in a
[2:02:51] prophet and a get the prophecy and
[2:02:53] there's a get the prophecy which is in
[2:02:54] the church it's to be judged by two or
[2:02:56] three judges when it's given there's a
[2:02:58] difference in a prophet and a get the
[2:02:59] prophecy if you notice in the Bible
[2:03:01] healing is in plural it's gifts g f TS
[2:03:04] Gifts of healings but a p r o p h t is a
[2:03:08] prophet and there is a gift to prophecy
[2:03:09] which is in the church it's to be judged
[2:03:11] by two or three judges when it's been
[2:03:13] given out is that true now this is let
[2:03:16] me just be honest this is where I've
[2:03:17] kind of missed it this is where I'm feel
[2:03:19] like I need to grow I've told you and
[2:03:21] it's happened before I've heard tongues
[2:03:23] interpretations and prophecies after
[2:03:27] services and this is what I failed to do
[2:03:29] because I wasn't there yet spiritually I
[2:03:31] wasn't mature enough spiritually now if
[2:03:33] you are praise the Lord you can help
[2:03:34] Teach Me by God's grace but if it's
[2:03:37] foretelling anything in the
[2:03:40] future then the real Church orders have
[2:03:43] two or three judges with the gift of uh
[2:03:45] with the gift of discernment to come
[2:03:47] around and say is this right right or
[2:03:49] not is this right or not is this right
[2:03:50] or not and then they go forth and say
[2:03:52] this is
[2:03:53] right praise God that's how the gifts
[2:03:57] actually work and this is where I've
[2:03:58] been guilty and this is where I need to
[2:03:59] grow now not guilty like I'm sinful but
[2:04:01] guilty like I wasn't there yet I'm not
[2:04:03] spiritually I wasn't even aware of this
[2:04:04] you know I've just learned this in the
[2:04:06] last few
[2:04:08] years a prophecy before anybody gives it
[2:04:11] out or I'm sorry before people should
[2:04:12] Rejoice over it should be judged
[2:04:16] first but ra said now if excuse it
[2:04:19] please don't think I'm wrong here that's
[2:04:21] where in the little breakup that come
[2:04:22] amongst the Pentecostal people recently
[2:04:24] called latter rain that's where they got
[2:04:26] off the line right there for a when a
[2:04:29] gift of Prophecy come to a man they
[2:04:31] declared him to be a prophet now that's
[2:04:33] wrong so see they took somebody who just
[2:04:35] had a gift to prophesy and made him a
[2:04:38] Bible interpreting Prophet that's wrong
[2:04:41] the prophet stands there he interprets
[2:04:43] the word like St Paul like Moses like
[2:04:45] brother brandom but if somebody just
[2:04:47] foretells the future they automat think
[2:04:48] oh he should be leading us and that's
[2:04:50] not how it's supposed to be you have to
[2:04:52] you have to find out am I just called to
[2:04:54] prophesy or am I called to be a prophet
[2:04:57] in this day we're not looking for any
[2:04:58] Major Prophets well we appreciate Minor
[2:05:00] Prophets amen but we haven't seen many
[2:05:03] of those either
[2:05:05] amen so that's that's that's the big
[2:05:07] mistake people make when someone
[2:05:08] foretells the future they want to
[2:05:10] instantly magnify them and give them a
[2:05:11] Pulpit and give them but be careful they
[2:05:14] might not be called to do that takes the
[2:05:16] Holy Spirit to judge that and that's the
[2:05:19] gift of discernment number seven gift of
[2:05:21] discernments this is knowledge that
[2:05:23] distinguishes or discerns or judges so
[2:05:27] if anybody ever prophesies here or
[2:05:28] speaks in tongues gives unknown unknown
[2:05:30] tongue into interpretation we need to
[2:05:32] have some judges here that say I got the
[2:05:34] gift of
[2:05:35] discern I can know God can tell me he
[2:05:38] can tell me is this the Antichrist
[2:05:39] Spirit or is this the spirit of
[2:05:45] Christ so the Bible defines that
[2:05:47] discernment judges the spirit behind the
[2:05:49] actions prophecies and words it judges
[2:05:52] it and knows that's of God that's of the
[2:05:55] devil brother bar said a message of
[2:05:57] tongues has to be before the church
[2:05:59] receives it Paul said let let's leave
[2:06:02] two or three judges with the sermon of
[2:06:03] spirit before it can be accepted in the
[2:06:06] church and this is like I said where we
[2:06:08] haven't had much experience but I hope
[2:06:10] church I honestly I say this I know I've
[2:06:11] said it before I hope God leads us into
[2:06:13] these things hope God just leads us into
[2:06:16] a a full book of Acts church now I
[2:06:18] believe we're a part of the book of Acts
[2:06:20] church already what I'm saying is to see
[2:06:21] everybody moved by the Holy Spirit where
[2:06:24] I see and I come to church I come to the
[2:06:26] pulpit and there's already been the
[2:06:27] spirit moving already in the
[2:06:28] morning praise God that's what brother B
[2:06:30] said that's what I want to see I want to
[2:06:32] see the Holy Spirit already moving
[2:06:33] before I even come to preach God's word
[2:06:36] and then I know what I studied yesterday
[2:06:37] as I prayed and fast or as I sought God
[2:06:39] I know it was the right thing because
[2:06:40] it'll be just what that Spirit was
[2:06:42] ministering here to the
[2:06:45] people but said a message of tongues has
[2:06:48] has to be before the church receives it
[2:06:50] this this is where I I feel like I've
[2:06:52] missed this Paul said let's leave two or
[2:06:54] three judge with the sermon of spirit
[2:06:56] before it can be accepted to the
[2:07:00] church in the church age book brother's
[2:07:02] talking about tongues how do you know
[2:07:04] the how do you know the origin of a
[2:07:06] tongue he said now tongues is the
[2:07:09] evidence we know it's not of receiving
[2:07:10] the Holy Ghost then every tongue would
[2:07:12] have to be of God but if it has been
[2:07:14] admitted by tongues evidence people that
[2:07:15] there are false tongues and true tongues
[2:07:18] for God has the genuine and Satan has
[2:07:19] the false so my question is who knows
[2:07:22] what is real who understood the language
[2:07:24] to know what was spoken who has the gift
[2:07:26] of discernment to
[2:07:28] know
[2:07:30] hallelujah
[2:07:33] amen now let me say
[2:07:36] this every Christian who's born again
[2:07:38] the Holy Ghost has a portion of
[2:07:40] discernment as well because the word
[2:07:42] inside of you the word is a discerner
[2:07:44] and brother B said in the message thirst
[2:07:45] it's like a buzzer and it goes off to
[2:07:47] protect your life when there's something
[2:07:49] false Doctrine
[2:07:50] preached so that's an automatic
[2:07:52] discernment you have and and uh you have
[2:07:54] the holy spirit inside of you as the the
[2:07:56] spirit of God and automatically can
[2:07:58] discern to a certain degree about the
[2:08:00] preaching oh that's right that's wrong
[2:08:02] that's right that's right that's right
[2:08:03] that's wrong hopefully when I'm
[2:08:04] preaching it's right it's right it's
[2:08:05] right that's what I desire by God's
[2:08:06] grace if it's wrong come talk to me
[2:08:08] after service so see that's what we have
[2:08:11] a portion of that but someone who's got
[2:08:13] a gift of discernment has a better
[2:08:14] bigger portion of that because they can
[2:08:16] stand there and say sister so and so was
[2:08:18] led of the holy spirit that was true
[2:08:20] prophecy or this was a true word of
[2:08:23] knowledge it helps you to understand and
[2:08:25] uh gives you the scripture to unlock
[2:08:27] something for your life that was thus
[2:08:28] say the Lord or how about this coming up
[2:08:30] and saying that's false that was of the
[2:08:32] devil this person needs to
[2:08:35] repent and it might be our favorite
[2:08:37] person in the church might be me could
[2:08:40] be who knows because the Holy Spirit can
[2:08:42] fall in anybody to do any gift but if
[2:08:43] it's wrong it wasn't the holy spirit
[2:08:45] that did that that was Satan that did
[2:08:47] that but see how you got to have see how
[2:08:49] you got to be prayed up church people
[2:08:51] want the gifts but who's willing to
[2:08:52] sacrifice you see that's what I'm saying
[2:08:55] who want who's got the courage to stand
[2:08:57] up and say no brother so and so was
[2:08:58] wrong when he said that that was of
[2:09:00] Satan who's got the courage to do that
[2:09:02] see it takes the leadership of the Lord
[2:09:05] it takes a real walk of
[2:09:10] consecration but see we got to be
[2:09:11] willing you got to be willing to invest
[2:09:13] in that you got to be willing to
[2:09:14] sacrifice in that I've been an hour and
[2:09:16] a half so I'm almost there I'm 9 and 10
[2:09:19] diverse kinds of tongues only one
[2:09:20] service today praise
[2:09:22] God diverse kinds of tongues are
[2:09:24] languages languages many kinds of
[2:09:26] languages speaking languages or tongues
[2:09:29] of men or
[2:09:31] Angels brother Braham said tongues of
[2:09:33] angels there's no interpretation for he
[2:09:34] said it's just unknown he said you're
[2:09:36] talking the language of
[2:09:38] angels so Angels must not speak English
[2:09:41] that must not be their fluent language
[2:09:43] they must know other languages some
[2:09:45] tongues are for private prayer if they
[2:09:47] are being no interpreter
[2:09:49] tongues that are interpreted edify the
[2:09:51] entire church and our most desired the
[2:09:53] gift of interpretation and prophecy is
[2:09:55] greater than the gift of tongues because
[2:09:57] they edify more people that's why tongu
[2:09:59] is the least of the gifts because you
[2:10:00] can have it and it just helps you it's
[2:10:02] me me me me me but if you got other
[2:10:04] gifts they help more
[2:10:05] people and that's those are that's why
[2:10:07] they're greater wisdom is greater
[2:10:08] because it manages all the other ones
[2:10:10] but if you have knowledge that can be a
[2:10:11] great benefit to people oh I know right
[2:10:14] what the scripture said God was dealing
[2:10:15] with me and wanted me to call you about
[2:10:17] this scripture it gave me an
[2:10:19] understanding that you need to believe
[2:10:20] this scripture you need to act upon this
[2:10:23] scripture brother Ram said I've spoken
[2:10:25] tongues several times and I believe it's
[2:10:28] the power of God yes I don't believe in
[2:10:29] initial EV now and speaking in tongues
[2:10:31] but I believe there's a power of God
[2:10:32] that makes you speak in tongues signs
[2:10:34] and wonders to
[2:10:36] follow here brother man look at the bold
[2:10:39] letters here brother's talking about I
[2:10:40] was walking along there I was singing I
[2:10:42] always sang when he was working I had
[2:10:44] different places where I went to pray I
[2:10:46] was going along there singing and all at
[2:10:47] once I come to find out I was speaking
[2:10:49] in tongues not knowing what I was
[2:10:52] doing he tells a few stories about that
[2:10:54] praying on his chair before a meeting
[2:10:56] and somebody come knock on the door and
[2:10:58] say brother brandom someone's in there
[2:11:00] with you he said no it's just me go go
[2:11:01] away I'm still prepared come back
[2:11:03] brother BR somebody's in there talking
[2:11:04] to you he said no and but M said oh I
[2:11:06] was speaking in tongues he
[2:11:08] said wow that's powerful I felt like two
[2:11:11] or three times I was going to speak in
[2:11:12] tongues but I just I don't know why I
[2:11:14] didn't didn't go beyond that but I know
[2:11:16] not all speak in tongues
[2:11:19] it's a Temptation for me to want to do
[2:11:20] that because I was raised around tongues
[2:11:21] all the time my whole life I was raised
[2:11:22] around tongues interpretation it's a
[2:11:24] Temptation for me to want to try to
[2:11:25] impersonate that but I gotta wait till
[2:11:28] God sends it if God don't send it it
[2:11:30] ain't for
[2:11:32] me see speaking in tongues comes in such
[2:11:34] a combustion that the person hardly
[2:11:36] knows what they're doing or they don't
[2:11:39] know what they're saying and
[2:11:40] interpretation is the same way they know
[2:11:42] not what they're going to say they have
[2:11:43] no more idea than what they're going to
[2:11:44] say because it's
[2:11:46] supernatural see as as long as you get
[2:11:48] the natural in it then you got natural
[2:11:50] see but if something just grabs you
[2:11:52] takes a hold of you and you're doing it
[2:11:53] see now remember that can be a genuine
[2:11:55] gift you could be the holy ghost that
[2:11:58] could be the Holy Ghost speaking in you
[2:12:00] with unknown tongues and you be lost and
[2:12:02] go to hell the Bible said so you believe
[2:12:04] that would you like to have a scripture
[2:12:05] on that you want scripture raise your
[2:12:07] hand though I speak with tongues as men
[2:12:08] and angels 1 Corinthians
[2:12:10] 13 both the one that can be interpreted
[2:12:14] and that cannot be interpreted genuine
[2:12:16] Holy Ghost tongues so tongues of men can
[2:12:19] be interpreted tongues of angels cannot
[2:12:20] be
[2:12:20] interpreted I am nothing see unless that
[2:12:23] other goes with it you can have this so
[2:12:25] don't reach after that without this get
[2:12:27] this first and then actually that'll
[2:12:31] follow interpretation of
[2:12:34] tongues oh and I think I forgot to put
[2:12:36] some quotes behind this one let me just
[2:12:38] skip ahead here real
[2:12:40] quick yep I'm
[2:12:42] sorry yep I forgive
[2:12:45] me I forgot to put the one the quote
[2:12:48] behind us interpretation in tongues I
[2:12:49] went over it a lot I I think I read
[2:12:51] through it
[2:12:52] anyway interpretation is telling what
[2:12:54] others has
[2:12:56] spoken it should be prayed for like last
[2:12:59] last time we had a tongue was about a
[2:13:00] year and a half ago over there in that
[2:13:01] sanctuary and we prayed for like 15
[2:13:03] minutes I got on tape too I recorded it
[2:13:05] on my phone and uh the interpretation
[2:13:07] never came uh so we just said praise the
[2:13:10] Lord you know maybe it'll be again but
[2:13:12] then the person felt led to leave the
[2:13:14] church so praise God that's how that
[2:13:16] works but in interpretation must be
[2:13:19] judged by the gift of discernment too so
[2:13:22] the tongue interpretation must all be
[2:13:23] judged by the gift of discernment now
[2:13:25] let me close with these quotes has this
[2:13:27] been helpful by God's grace
[2:13:30] okay brother bam said this he called
[2:13:32] himself a jellyfish sometimes this why I
[2:13:35] want to encourage you don't beat
[2:13:36] yourself up if you've missed God don't
[2:13:38] beat yourself just repent say you're
[2:13:40] sorry don't beat yourself up if you
[2:13:42] haven't done anything for God yet
[2:13:43] because brother brandom made mistakes
[2:13:45] with gifts God he said God will
[2:13:48] literally show him visions and he
[2:13:49] wouldn't act upon them just like God
[2:13:52] will speak something to us and we don't
[2:13:54] act upon
[2:13:55] it but man said this is secondhand of
[2:13:58] robe 1956 sometimes I look at myself I
[2:14:01] think I've been such a jellyfish in my
[2:14:03] life I have waited to missst many
[2:14:06] thousands of souls can you imagine that
[2:14:09] into the kingdom of God because I've
[2:14:10] waited and said well God depending too
[2:14:12] much on a spiritual gift and said Lord
[2:14:14] if you'll just show me if you'll give me
[2:14:16] a vision to what to do and God give me
[2:14:18] the vision then I'll turn around let
[2:14:19] somebody talk me into something
[2:14:23] else look at that God will give him a
[2:14:26] vision and tell them you need to do this
[2:14:28] and brother bam said many thousands can
[2:14:30] you imagine that this man lived in
[2:14:32] Visions all
[2:14:34] day and oh I've never come to the spot
[2:14:37] yet until I like I have it this time
[2:14:39] that I feel it's a faith that I must
[2:14:42] step out there because it's a promise so
[2:14:44] now instead of waiting upon the vision
[2:14:47] go in faith knowing that God's called me
[2:14:49] to do certain things I don't have to
[2:14:51] wait on a gift all the time don't have
[2:14:52] to wait wait wait I can just know it's
[2:14:54] God's promise and go out there and do
[2:14:56] what God's called me to
[2:14:57] do and the things he has done and the
[2:14:59] healings he has performed and the
[2:15:00] Miracles even so much as come down and
[2:15:02] have his picture taken by the side of us
[2:15:04] and so forth which has never been known
[2:15:06] since the world began and then stand
[2:15:07] around like a what
[2:15:10] jellyfish this is why I love brother
[2:15:11] Brandon because he was a humble
[2:15:13] Christian he could say you know what I'm
[2:15:15] not perfect with my gift I've missed
[2:15:17] many thousand Souls so can you imagine
[2:15:20] there was probably meetings the Holy
[2:15:21] Spirit told him to go to and maybe maybe
[2:15:22] turn it
[2:15:23] down he said I was a jellyfish to that I
[2:15:26] didn't have a real backbone I really
[2:15:28] couldn't stand with the word of God
[2:15:30] that's why I'm trying to tell you don't
[2:15:31] be discouraged be encouraged just repent
[2:15:34] and make it
[2:15:37] right and it even makes me discouraged
[2:15:40] with who myself I never battle
[2:15:44] discouragement I battle
[2:15:45] often that's the thing I battle most is
[2:15:47] being discouraged about
[2:15:49] myself Mercy it's time to keep your eye
[2:15:53] on the promise and that's what by God's
[2:15:56] grace I am to do I realize that every
[2:15:58] devil of Hell will shoot at it will
[2:16:00] shoot at me but by God's grace I aim to
[2:16:05] keep my eye on the
[2:16:07] promise let's stand to our feet I'll
[2:16:10] read one more quote as we're standing
[2:16:11] I've been hour and 10 minutes so let me
[2:16:13] read one more quotation
[2:16:16] here I just have to skip ahead
[2:16:18] you know brother bam said Jesus had all
[2:16:19] the gifts of the
[2:16:27] Spirit yeah let's end with these quick
[2:16:29] quotes here but said the bride has run
[2:16:32] through gifts how many you believe that
[2:16:34] b said this in sman church age God never
[2:16:36] tended the church to be run by men God
[2:16:37] runs his church and runs it through
[2:16:39] gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the
[2:16:42] Spirit is in the church to correct the
[2:16:45] spirit every believer has an individual
[2:16:48] Ministry
[2:16:51] amen
[2:16:53] amen so see and that means what I'm
[2:16:56] saying is that I want everybody to feel
[2:16:57] the same burden I have for every service
[2:16:59] that would be my greatest desire if
[2:17:00] everybody would come to church and have
[2:17:01] the same burden I
[2:17:02] do I have a burden because I brother
[2:17:04] Adam I don't want to fall in my face and
[2:17:06] people know well he didn't pray enough
[2:17:07] or he didn't study enough or or he
[2:17:09] missed the spirit he got in the flesh I
[2:17:10] have a burden and so I pray and and
[2:17:12] repent to do that to make sure I'm in
[2:17:14] the channel now if only everybody had
[2:17:16] that desire and brother B said you
[2:17:20] should after this we'll see who really
[2:17:22] takes it to heart see who really
[2:17:25] believes the prophet and actually can
[2:17:26] put it into you might believe it but who
[2:17:28] can put it into action amen that's what
[2:17:30] we want just like those serpins we want
[2:17:32] to be in action right cover the eyes
[2:17:35] cover the legs be in
[2:17:39] action then in each local church there's
[2:17:41] nine spiritual gifts that come among the
[2:17:43] people that's knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[2:17:44] healing Miracles tongues and all these
[2:17:47] things go in each local body and every
[2:17:49] person let's say every person ready
[2:17:51] every
[2:17:52] person in the church has an let's say
[2:17:55] individual Ministry ready individual
[2:17:58] Ministry your ministry is not the same
[2:18:00] as mine but you have
[2:18:04] one and that individual Ministry goes
[2:18:06] together with the rest of the
[2:18:09] ministry to edify the body of
[2:18:12] Christ remember you can give gifts you
[2:18:15] can sing songs it brings healing there's
[2:18:17] many many gifts of healing you just have
[2:18:20] to be sensitive to the Holy
[2:18:23] Spirit and we read that every the
[2:18:27] manifestation of spirit is given to
[2:18:28] every man and the Holy Spirit divides to
[2:18:30] every man and this is one of my
[2:18:32] favorites I I think maybe if I haven't
[2:18:33] read this before I'll probably keep
[2:18:34] reading it again God carries in 10 years
[2:18:36] you come back I might be reading this
[2:18:38] again by God's grace because brother B
[2:18:40] said at church order 1963 now like this
[2:18:42] if brother Neville say now let me par me
[2:18:44] if brother KH speaks with tongues and
[2:18:46] brother hion gives interpretation then
[2:18:48] they have a Ministry together for the
[2:18:50] church now that isn't the ministry of
[2:18:53] brother Neville that's your ministry to
[2:18:54] the
[2:18:55] church I'm giving this as an example
[2:18:58] then you Brethren should be just as
[2:18:59] interested in getting your ministry in
[2:19:03] the place in the house of God as the
[2:19:06] pastor is interested in getting
[2:19:08] his because it's just as
[2:19:12] essential that you do it does everybody
[2:19:15] act like that in every church that you
[2:19:16] know
[2:19:18] where well I better prepare for Sunday
[2:19:21] too or I'll just let the pastor
[2:19:23] prepare this is what brother Ram taught
[2:19:27] everybody should be just as interested
[2:19:28] everybody's got an individual Ministry
[2:19:29] and everybody should be just as
[2:19:31] interested in the pastor as in his
[2:19:32] ministry to help the body of
[2:19:40] Christ for Lord just come to the piano
[2:19:42] here let's end on that one by God's
[2:19:44] grace because I know if you're a real
[2:19:45] Christian you're interested in your
[2:19:46] ministry how many are interested in what
[2:19:48] God has for you to do for
[2:19:50] him we are let's bow our heads here by
[2:19:52] God's
[2:19:57] grace Heavenly Father Lord I just bow my
[2:20:00] head Lord and thank you for this hour
[2:20:02] and 13 minute sermon Lord God I have
[2:20:05] just tried to hit the highlights and
[2:20:08] summarize some of these
[2:20:10] things I felt kind of pulled to preach
[2:20:12] on this and then when Sister Amy told me
[2:20:14] it was her last service I thought this
[2:20:15] would be a good thing to do
[2:20:18] holding a few months off on this four
[2:20:22] months and Lord I know some of these
[2:20:24] things we've heard before but Lord maybe
[2:20:26] today was the day where it really really
[2:20:28] struck our
[2:20:30] hearts where we now realize well I Haven
[2:20:33] an inid individual
[2:20:35] Ministry it might be in the wisdom God
[2:20:38] has placed in my life I have none of my
[2:20:39] own but I see God's wisdom flow out
[2:20:41] through me and it helps people manage
[2:20:43] the Affairs of their life or I've had a
[2:20:45] word of knowledge that would give
[2:20:47] someone the key or the understanding
[2:20:49] they need to get delivered or get
[2:20:51] victory over this or help them get out
[2:20:53] of their
[2:20:55] sin I've got a gift of faith there's
[2:20:58] times you show me Lord I just know you
[2:20:59] heard my
[2:21:01] prayer or I've got a gift of healing I
[2:21:03] played a song before and it's healed
[2:21:04] someone or I've laid my hands on
[2:21:07] somebody or I prayed and fasted and some
[2:21:09] God healed
[2:21:12] somebody or God's given me discernment
[2:21:15] to judge or that pracher was the right
[2:21:18] Spirit or not or that song special was
[2:21:21] in the right Spirit or not and the Holy
[2:21:22] Spirit let me know that was of me or
[2:21:24] that was not of
[2:21:27] me Lord my prayer is that everybody
[2:21:29] would be just as interested in this
[2:21:31] service and next week service As I Am
[2:21:34] Lord God and Lord I've got to battle
[2:21:36] with my interest too I'm I'm a man I I
[2:21:39] get tired I get weary I make mistakes
[2:21:42] I'm not pointing out the people I'm
[2:21:43] pointing out all of us if we say we
[2:21:45] believe the message if we say we believe
[2:21:46] the Bible help us to follow holy ghost's
[2:21:49] Love and Desire spiritual gifts Lord God
[2:21:53] and if we desire that then we'll
[2:21:55] consecrate Our Lives we may have to
[2:21:58] sacrifice some time some meals as we
[2:22:01] heard last Sunday which was such a
[2:22:02] powerful message to me
[2:22:04] Lord Jesus they won't even miss a few
[2:22:07] meals to get the Holy Ghost as your
[2:22:09] Prophet said they'd rather go eat at
[2:22:11] McDonald's or rather go eat at home than
[2:22:13] get than fast and get the Holy
[2:22:15] Ghost Lord Jesus
[2:22:17] Jesus help us to find Lord our
[2:22:20] sacrificial life as Christians
[2:22:22] Lord where everybody can be just as
[2:22:25] interested Lord in every Service as each
[2:22:28] person as the preacher as the song
[2:22:30] leader as the piano
[2:22:32] player so Lord I ask for a spirit of
[2:22:35] humility if there's a spirit of
[2:22:36] stubbornness I come against in the name
[2:22:38] of Jesus Christ Lord may you break that
[2:22:41] any Spirit of stubbornness or any Spirit
[2:22:43] of Pride that wouldn't humble itself and
[2:22:46] be a ser to the body of Christ in this
[2:22:48] church I ask that in Jesus Christ's name
[2:22:50] not by my authority but by these words
[2:22:52] I've said this word I preach I've read
[2:22:55] your prophets quotes I believe they're
[2:22:57] true in Jesus Christ's name I come
[2:22:59] against that may there be humility May
[2:23:02] there be such a interest in the things
[2:23:05] of
[2:23:07] God that we could sense your presence
[2:23:12] Lord that we could be a part of a
[2:23:15] body where Sinners are walking and know
[2:23:18] God is with us God is amongst you there
[2:23:21] is a God he discerned the thoughts in
[2:23:23] tents of my heart he foretold my future
[2:23:26] he
[2:23:27] prophesied he gave me the wisdom I
[2:23:29] needed with my life
[2:23:31] situation I had no idea of any of that
[2:23:33] knowledge of the word but you brought
[2:23:35] you brought that word with the thus
[2:23:37] sayith the Lord you brought it in such a
[2:23:38] humble manner God spoke to me today Lord
[2:23:41] let our church be like that dear God
[2:23:44] that was my prayer a few months ago when
[2:23:45] we preached on the key of faith I'm
[2:23:47] still holding on to that scriptural key

[2:23:54] will be in the bride Grant it Lord Jesus

[2:39:18] night brother what was the bible study
[2:39:19] on Church order we talked about the
[2:39:22] gifts of the Spirit about half the time
[2:39:24] didn't we we did the first half about
[2:39:26] correcting people and then we spent the
[2:39:28] last half on gifts in the church I felt
[2:39:31] inspired to preach it yesterday preach
[2:39:34] it today and Lord's trying to send us a
[2:39:36] message Lord willing let me say this
[2:39:39] we'll pray here for a few more minutes
[2:39:41] and we'll be dismissed but
[2:39:42] listen I want everyone to know this
[2:39:46] if we don't get interpretation I still
[2:39:48] want sister Nomi sister Nomi if you look
[2:39:50] up here if you get a chance I still want
[2:39:51] you to speak whenever God puts on your
[2:39:55] heart you just F You Just Let It Go by
[2:39:57] the holy spirit because there might be
[2:39:59] somebody she did the right
[2:40:03] thing but there might be somebody here
[2:40:04] that's not following leadership of the
[2:40:06] Holy Spirit or God might be preparing to
[2:40:08] send somebody in who has the
[2:40:09] interpretation because I don't know
[2:40:11] about you but I'm like brother Bram I
[2:40:12] covet that God sends us gifted people
[2:40:14] here how many come how many cover that
[2:40:16] by God's grace I cover that I pray for
[2:40:20] that it also might be that sister naom
[2:40:23] me God might give her the gift of
[2:40:24] interpretation at a future time so we
[2:40:26] always want her to stay in that channel
[2:40:28] just like I want to stay in the channel
[2:40:29] to preach and teach you and give you
[2:40:32] wisdom or lay my hands on the sick and
[2:40:34] they get healed praise
[2:40:37] God so don't ever get confused I know
[2:40:40] there's quotes that says oh if there's
[2:40:41] no interpretation stop it but brother
[2:40:43] Braham didn't do that till 1963
[2:40:47] 19 so all those 17 years he was gone he
[2:40:50] let it the tongues go like that and
[2:40:51] waiting for interpretation so that's how
[2:40:53] we do it brother said when it gets
[2:40:55] mature then you put it in the room does
[2:40:57] everybody understand I'm not going to
[2:40:59] put in the room yet because I want to
[2:41:00] see I want I want to give her a chance
[2:41:01] to grow into this I want to give other
[2:41:04] people they got gifts to grow in their
[2:41:07] gifts praise
[2:41:10] God I'm just so thankful brother B said
