[31:51] like the readout of pizzas chapter 4
[31:54] tonight I just kind of had on my heart
[31:57] to go back to the Ephesian series
[31:59] I haven't preached on since January but
[32:01] this is part 14 of the series fees in
[32:05] Chapter four like to preach on the
[32:08] fivefold ministry a little bit more
[32:10] tonight by God but having some good
[32:16] conversations with the Saints brother
[32:19] Aaron and I've been talking about the
[32:20] fivefold ministry and went on in
[32:22] Jeffersonville we talked quite a little
[32:23] about it
[32:24] I'm sorry quite a bit about it because
[32:25] we fellowship with some of the Saints
[32:28] there at the voice of God recordings and
[32:30] then sister Wendy gave me encouraging
[32:34] thought so I like to preach that as well
[32:36] - nice by God's grace
[32:38] look at this tonight by God's grace B's
[32:41] in Chapter four like to start reading at
[32:49] verse 10
[32:59] Bible says in Ephesians 4:10 he that
[33:02] descended is the same also that ascended
[33:03] up far above all heavens that he might
[33:07] fill all things and he gave some
[33:10] apostles and some prophets and some
[33:12] evangelists and some pastors and
[33:14] teachers for the perfecting of the
[33:17] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[33:19] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[33:23] we all come in the unity of the faith
[33:25] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[33:27] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[33:30] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[33:33] now this is what the fivefold ministry
[33:35] will keep us from being if we're feeding
[33:38] on the true Word of God that we
[33:41] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[33:44] and fro and carried about with every
[33:47] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[33:50] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[33:54] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[33:57] truth in love may grow up into him in
[34:00] all things which is the head even Christ
[34:02] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[34:05] together and compacted by that which
[34:07] every joint supplieth according to the
[34:10] effectual working in the measure of
[34:11] every part maketh increase of the body
[34:14] unto the edifying of itself in love amen
[34:18] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[34:19] Prayer if you have a need on your heart
[34:21] just maybe lift your hand there at home
[34:23] Heavenly Father we just come reverently
[34:25] we thank you for this Eternal Word we
[34:28] give you glory tonight we ask o God that
[34:30] this this portion of Scripture will
[34:32] become more dear to us more real to us
[34:35] through the preaching of your word speak
[34:37] to us now anoint me the speaker annoying
[34:39] these the ears anoint them and their
[34:41] homes were live-streaming those on the
[34:43] archived may they feast on your word
[34:45] Lord may become such a reality to each
[34:47] one of us in Jesus Christ's name
[34:50] everybody said amen
[34:52] god bless you bein seated so I'd like to
[34:59] look at that scripture tonight and this
[35:04] is part fourteen as we said and we just
[35:07] want to briefly remember in our series
[35:10] brother Brandon would mention
[35:12] Scofield and the prophet of God said
[35:14] there was three themes and I'm sorry
[35:16] Scofield says there was three themes in
[35:18] the book of Ephesians the first thing
[35:21] was the believers exalted position in
[35:23] Christ remember how we were supposed to
[35:25] be seated in heavenly places we're
[35:26] supposed to live in heavenly atmospheres
[35:29] and I were chosen in Christ before the
[35:32] foundation of the world all those
[35:34] beautiful truths about our exalted
[35:38] position that was chapter 1 verse 1 all
[35:41] the way to chapter 2 verse 10 the second
[35:44] theme is there's one body of Christ
[35:47] composable Jew and Gentile
[35:49] that's reverse or chapter 2 verse 11 all
[35:52] the way to chapter 3 verse 21 the third
[35:55] and final theme is the one we're on now
[35:57] is the walk and warfare of the believer
[36:01] so our portion tonight in Ephesians
[36:03] chapter 4 is about the walk of the
[36:06] believer will see the warfare later on
[36:09] in chapter 4 and then chapter 5 and then
[36:12] even chapter 6 shows the warfare as well
[36:15] by the grace of God I just want to
[36:19] review briefly on part 13 I just want to
[36:24] go to Psalm 68 so if you have your
[36:26] Bibles go to Psalm 68 first one there's
[36:30] only 11 verses in this chapter Psalm 68
[36:37] because remember when when Paul writes
[36:40] about Jesus ascending and and and giving
[36:45] gifts unto men and captivity being
[36:48] captive
[36:48] he's Paul's actually quoting Psalm 68
[36:51] and one of the authors or one of the
[36:54] commentators says that this Psalm was
[36:57] probably sang or played when David
[37:00] brought up the Ark of the Covenant into
[37:03] Jerusalem the right way not the wrong
[37:05] way when he was trying to do God a
[37:07] service outside of the will of God but
[37:09] the right way when he did
[37:15] the time and season and worth and thus
[37:18] done according to do God a service as
[37:21] well Ram taught in that service trying
[37:23] to do God a service without it being I'm
[37:25] sorry with it being as well how we'd say
[37:28] so let's look at verse Psalm 68 verse 1
[37:31] let God arise let his enemies be
[37:33] scattered let them also that hate him
[37:36] flee before him as smoke is driven away
[37:39] so drive them away as wax melteth before
[37:42] the fire so let the wicked perish at the
[37:44] presence of God so how does God's
[37:46] presence sound right now pretty powerful
[37:49] amen
[37:50] all enemies flee all demons flee at the
[37:53] power Jesus Christ verse 3 but let the
[37:57] righteous be glad let them rejoice
[37:58] before God yay
[38:00] let them exceedingly rejoice o Allah we
[38:04] should be glad in God's presence tonight
[38:05] verse 4 sing unto God singing praises to
[38:09] his name extol his name Chuck father of
[38:17] the fatherless and a judge of the
[38:19] widow's is God in His holy habitation so
[38:24] those who don't have a father for those
[38:26] who feel like they have no provider like
[38:29] a widow or widower or those who feel
[38:33] like they have no dwelling place Jesus
[38:35] Christ is your father Jesus Christ is
[38:37] your provider and he is your shelter
[38:40] where you stay amen
[38:41] verse 6 God said it the solitary and
[38:44] Families he bringeth out those which are
[38:48] bound with chains so if you need a
[38:49] family God will put you in a family
[38:51] where is that that's your home church
[38:52] and you bring it out those who are bound
[38:55] change so if you're if you're chaining
[38:57] up the addictions Jesus Christ will set
[38:58] you free I'm a witness of that he met
[39:01] with the rebellious try and a trial
[39:03] starts out a trial and so when people
[39:06] are trying to serve God but their their
[39:07] experience is dry it's because they're
[39:10] not living the way they ought to they're
[39:12] not abiding in the presence of God in
[39:15] their local church we would say Oh God
[39:19] when thou wentest forth before thy
[39:21] people when that is marched through the
[39:23] wilderness a lap the earth shook the
[39:25] heavens also dropped at the Friends of
[39:27] God even
[39:28] sinai itself was moved at the presence
[39:30] of God the God of Israel
[39:32] now Oh God did send a plentiful rain
[39:36] where by thou disconfirmed not
[39:39] inheritance when it was weary amen so
[39:43] see rain or anointing of the Holy Spirit
[39:45] is confirmation that God is with us
[39:47] amen when God sends a fresh anointing
[39:49] when you feel revived and inspired by
[39:52] the Holy Spirit and you feel as
[39:53] blessings poured on upon you that's
[39:55] confirmation that you're in the Covenant
[39:57] amen
[39:58] verse 10 my congregation have brought
[40:02] therein now oh god has prepared of thy
[40:05] goodness for the poor the Lord gave the
[40:09] word great was the company of those that
[40:12] published it kings of armies did flee
[40:14] apace and she that tarried at home
[40:17] divided the spoil now I'm going to skip
[40:22] down to verse 17 the chariots of God are
[40:25] 20,000 even thousands of angels the Lord
[40:28] is among them as in Sinai in the holy
[40:32] place
[40:33] now here's what Paul quotes when Paul
[40:36] talks about Jesus resurrecting ascending
[40:39] and then sending down gifts here's where
[40:41] he's quoting now as ascended on high
[40:43] that was led captivity captive now has
[40:46] received gifts for men yay for the
[40:50] rebellious also that the Lord might
[40:52] dwell among them amen so the fivefold
[40:56] ministry was given to the church that
[40:57] God might dwell among us how many want
[41:00] God as well among them if you do then
[41:02] you should take our church services
[41:04] extremely seriously because you will
[41:06] feel God's presence
[41:08] if God's true gifts are here and if
[41:10] we're truly trusting in God will feel
[41:12] the Friends of the Lord amen that's
[41:15] God's Way he says it right there look at
[41:18] verse 19 blessed be the Lord who daily
[41:20] loaded us with benefits even the god of
[41:24] our salvation say la I don't know about
[41:26] you but Sunday after brother Keith
[41:28] Brandon preached I felt like I was going
[41:30] home loaded with all blessings on my
[41:32] back now I always carry a backpack but
[41:34] really spiritually you know we should be
[41:36] carrying all the blessings of God out of
[41:38] church you got healing it's in your
[41:41] backpack
[41:42] deliverance if it's in your backpack if
[41:44] you need joy or gladness or you need
[41:46] some hope it's in your backpack you
[41:48] should daily be loaded with all God's
[41:50] benefits amen that's the scripture and
[41:53] this is where Paul pulls that idea of
[41:57] the fivefold ministry God giving gifts
[42:00] God wanting to dwell among us through
[42:03] the preaching of the word I hope that's
[42:05] how you feel when when when people are
[42:07] really hungry for God's Word
[42:09] you can feel God's presence you can feel
[42:11] that God is here you can feel that God
[42:13] is speaking to your heart in fact I hope
[42:15] that's how you feel right now that God
[42:17] is speaking to each and every one of
[42:19] your hearts that way we know we're in
[42:21] his presence amen
[42:23] so this is the context where it's taken
[42:26] from now let's go back to Ephesians
[42:28] chapter 4 and let's look at verse 12 now
[42:35] I never really put this together like I
[42:36] did tonight but there are seven benefits
[42:40] to the fivefold ministry listed and we
[42:42] know seven is a number of perfection
[42:45] right or complete I'm sorry completion
[42:48] three is perfection seven is completion
[42:51] so God gives us a perfect complete
[42:54] spiritual walk through the five gifts of
[42:57] the fivefold ministry now at the end of
[43:00] the sermon I'm going to get to kind of
[43:01] the attacks on the fivefold ministry
[43:03] which is what we were fellowshiping and
[43:06] talking about and when we went to
[43:07] Jeffersonville at the beginning of the
[43:09] month there's so many attacks on the
[43:11] phone hacking and saying all the
[43:17] fivefold ministry has failed the job
[43:19] done and we'll show how that's wrong
[43:21] will show how no Christian can ever fail
[43:24] you know we went to Jeffersonville and
[43:26] somebody said Oh on the fivefold
[43:27] ministry is failing that's impossible
[43:29] it's impossible for a Holy Ghost
[43:32] Christian to fail because there's no
[43:35] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[43:36] Jesus
[43:37] it's impossible now men and women or men
[43:41] that are pretending to be in the
[43:43] fivefold ministry they can fail but a
[43:45] true God called preacher can never fail
[43:48] because of blood of Jesus Christ has
[43:50] already forgiven him and he's more than
[43:52] a conqueror through Christ Jesus and
[43:54] amen so it's wrong to say that the
[43:58] fivefold ministry has failed it hasn't
[44:00] it's accomplishing all that God purpose
[44:03] for it to accomplish amen let's go to
[44:06] verse well in verse 12 we'll see the
[44:09] first few like I said that they're set
[44:13] and then it keeps us from four walls as
[44:17] we'll see later in verse believe it's
[44:19] verse 14 but let's go to verse 12 so why
[44:23] did why did Christ send the fivefold
[44:25] ministry that he might fill every Church
[44:27] the Bible said that he might fill all
[44:29] things God wants to feel fill everyone
[44:31] in the church so he sends the five gifts
[44:34] did you enjoy the evangelists gift from
[44:35] brother Keith on Sunday oh I just I just
[44:38] get so excited and happy I got a shout
[44:40] and scream you know I got a rejoice and
[44:42] raise my hands because that is feeding
[44:44] my soul it's loading me with benefits
[44:46] and I need all five today they're trying
[44:49] to make it just one brother branham just
[44:50] one all you need is brother Graham you
[44:53] don't need anything else I'm sorry that
[44:54] breaks the word of God we cannot break
[44:56] the word of God we need all five yes we
[44:58] need brother Adams ministry it's part
[45:00] but there's four more and we can't we
[45:02] must live by every word that proceeds
[45:04] out of God's mouth amen
[45:06] not just just some but every word we
[45:09] need every piece in God's puzzle to make
[45:12] the picture clear so verse well he sends
[45:16] it for the perfecting of the Saints now
[45:19] that word perfect means to equip or
[45:22] completely furnish so we've all we've
[45:25] all probably moved into apartment before
[45:27] right or you murdered moved into your
[45:29] own house before how many ever had to
[45:30] furnish your house with your own
[45:32] furniture we have many times there are
[45:35] numerous times we moved when I first
[45:38] went in the couch I had to furnish
[45:39] everything the only thing that was there
[45:40] was the air conditioner I didn't have to
[45:42] furnish that but I had to furnish
[45:44] everything else I'm sorry the bed was
[45:45] there too and the mattress and
[45:47] everything else I had to furnish the the
[45:50] toiletries and the sheets of the pillow
[45:52] you name it clothes everything else
[45:54] everything had to be furnished so that's
[45:57] spiritually what the fivefold ministry
[45:59] does it furnishes you or it equips you
[46:02] with everything you need to live a
[46:04] Christian life Amen hallelujah
[46:07] more than perfect
[46:08] or the equipping of the Saints oh I
[46:10] don't feel like I have enough equipment
[46:12] brother just to do the job well you just
[46:14] hang around the fivefold ministry it
[46:15] will equip you to do the job
[46:17] amen that's what the Word of God says
[46:19] either the Bible's line or the Bible is
[46:21] true and we know the Bible is right amen
[46:24] so we must remember that and if we don't
[46:28] feel equipped it's either the preachers
[46:29] fault it's either my fault or whoever's
[46:31] preaching and we need to go talk to them
[46:33] and tell them they're wrong and show
[46:34] them they're wrong or it's our fault
[46:36] we're not receiving the word by faith
[46:38] we're not mixing the word with faith
[46:40] we've got to mix the word with faith
[46:42] brother Branham says you've got when you
[46:44] feed on the word you've got to go
[46:45] exercise it he said I get spiritually
[46:47] obese he says just like if you eat too
[46:50] much naturally and you know exercise
[46:52] you're going to get obese and that's how
[46:54] it is we have to hear the word and then
[46:55] what the preacher preached we've got to
[46:57] go talk to others about it
[46:58] we've got to go we've got to go pray
[47:00] about it in the prayer closet we've got
[47:02] to do something with the food that God
[47:04] gave us amen so perfecting of the Saints
[47:08] equipping you giving you the tools you
[47:10] need next
[47:12] it works the ministry which is undertake
[47:15] undertaking of the ministry so the
[47:18] fivefold ministry it gives you your
[47:20] equipment and then it gives you the
[47:21] undertake in other words it tells you
[47:23] the undertaking it tells you the work
[47:25] you're supposed to do in the ministry
[47:27] and the word of the fivefold ministry
[47:29] will never point you outside of God's
[47:30] Bible it will always keep you in the
[47:32] Bible I'll never call woman to preach
[47:35] right I'll never call Manta to submit to
[47:37] his wife and let the wife rule and I
[47:39] never call that number called man to be
[47:41] a or a man to be violent or
[47:43] aggressive it will call us to do what
[47:46] the Word of God tells us to do next this
[47:49] is powerful it edifies the body of
[47:53] Christ so all five preaching gifts will
[47:56] edify it which means building up it also
[47:59] means promotes another's growth in
[48:02] Christian wisdom piety happiness and
[48:07] holiness how many want to be wise how
[48:11] many wanted a pot pious life how many
[48:13] want to be happy and holy the way you do
[48:16] that is you listen to the Bible ministry
[48:18] receive what they're preaching and it
[48:21] will
[48:22] exactly that it will edify you it will
[48:24] build your happiness up it will build up
[48:27] your holiness amen
[48:29] it'll lift up your wisdom it will give
[48:30] you so much wisdom if you receive it as
[48:32] God giving you daily benefits amen
[48:35] but you've got to receive it by faith
[48:38] and not by intellect just my face
[48:42] alright verse 13 so we've already seen
[48:46] three things out of the seven let's go
[48:48] to verse 13 here's the fourth till we
[48:52] all come in the unity which is agreement
[48:54] of the faith so that means the four
[48:57] thing is everyone and the bride of Jesus
[48:59] Christ will have faith that agrees on
[49:02] the Word of God everyone will agree
[49:04] about the rapture whether it's you know
[49:06] it just run around enough to come back
[49:08] or or is a return ministry or not or
[49:15] this is the rapture before the
[49:17] tribulation or after it's here through
[49:20] five gifts to bring us to a unity of the
[49:23] faith all the bride will agree about
[49:26] rapturing faith amen all the bride will
[49:29] agree about perfect faith because the
[49:31] Holy Spirit will unite us to agree on
[49:33] God's Word amen and it's supernaturals
[49:37] not by it's not by one man ruling and
[49:40] telling others what to preach it's by
[49:41] the Holy Ghost telling all the preachers
[49:44] went to preach amen and he brings that
[49:47] unity verse 13 and next is the knowledge
[49:51] of the Son of God so knowledge is
[49:54] precise truth that's what it means
[49:57] precise truth the knowledge of the Son
[50:01] of man unto now this is if we do those
[50:04] five things equip the Saints work the
[50:07] Mintos find your ministry build up the
[50:09] body grown up and
[50:14] and it's the precise truth to the
[50:18] measure of the stature of the fullness
[50:20] of Christ
[50:21] glory now this this means you will come
[50:26] unto a perfect man unto the portion of
[50:29] the maturity of the fullness of Christ
[50:32] how many want to be mature like Jesus
[50:34] remember what is the true anointing its
[50:36] its ultimate power with control that's
[50:39] the true anointing of the Holy Ghost you
[50:40] know you have all the power of God in
[50:42] your heart all the pain but you have
[50:44] your under control you're not doing what
[50:46] you want to do you're under the control
[50:47] of God and you'll only do what the
[50:49] father says do just like Jesus he had
[50:51] all power all faith everything like that
[50:53] when he was under the control he said I
[50:56] only do what the father shows me amen
[50:59] that's why the bride the bride when
[51:01] she's under control the Holy Spirit she
[51:02] doesn't try she doesn't try to do things
[51:05] she waits to the Holy Spirit
[51:06] leezar and then she marches ahead amen
[51:09] she cut because she's mature she has a
[51:12] measure of the portion or I'm sorry a
[51:15] portion of the maturity of Christ it
[51:17] builds us up to a portion of the
[51:20] maturity of Jesus Christ amen now verse
[51:23] 14 here's the four things we will no
[51:27] longer be if we have the true preaching
[51:30] if we receive the true preaching of the
[51:32] fivefold ministry we will not be
[51:35] children that's the first one you'll not
[51:38] be a baby Christian right you'll not
[51:41] like like like Paul said when I was a
[51:44] child I spoke as a child when you're a
[51:47] mature Christian you won't talk like a
[51:49] baby immature Christian you'll talk like
[51:52] a mature Christian you won't be a child
[51:54] the second thing he says sorry verse 14
[52:00] we be no more children we won't be
[52:01] immature we'll put away childish things
[52:03] we won't be tossed to and fro carried
[52:06] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[52:07] sleight of man and by cunning craftiness
[52:10] whereby they lie in wait to the sea so
[52:12] toss means agitated like waves now if
[52:16] you've never been to the ocean well you
[52:17] should go on youtube and watch it
[52:19] because you can see all the waves as
[52:21] they they're agitated right they're
[52:22] tossed back and forth you can see them
[52:24] smashed against the rocks because
[52:26] there's so much agitation
[52:28] smashed up against ships if you want
[52:31] there's so much agitation with the waves
[52:33] but cor we should not be tossed from one
[52:36] doctor to the next from one problem to
[52:38] the next from one idea or opinion to the
[52:41] next we should be sound and stable not
[52:43] tossed around not constantly agitated am
[52:46] I saved or not am I filled with the Holy
[52:48] Ghost or not am I gonna go on the
[52:49] rapture or not we should know we should
[52:52] be solid Christians amen
[52:54] the third thing we are not carried by
[52:58] the winds which is which means pushed
[53:00] into doubts and hesitation and opinions
[53:04] so this these two kind of go together
[53:06] toss and carry we're not carrying around
[53:08] by this guy's opinion or that guy's
[53:10] opinion the only opinion we care about
[53:12] is the Holy Spirit's opinion amen and
[53:15] brother Branham would have given us or
[53:17] has given us the Holy Spirit's opinion
[53:19] and it's the Holy Bible by God's grace
[53:21] and if we really believe the five-o
[53:25] ministry we will not be to see which
[53:27] means to roam out of the true way we
[53:30] won't be led astray and let out into
[53:32] diverse lusts and and led away from the
[53:34] Word of God if we're truly feeding on
[53:37] the Word of God that's preached through
[53:39] the fivefold ministry Jesus said let no
[53:42] man deceive you so the true fivefold
[53:44] ministry will not deceive you they will
[53:46] teach you precise truth right from God's
[53:48] word that will equip you strengthen you
[53:50] edify you give you everything you need
[53:53] to become enough pure we say full
[53:55] measure of maturity of Jesus Christ amen
[53:58] glory amen yeah you know this but the
[54:04] Bible teaches a love and devotion for
[54:06] the house of God because that's where
[54:08] the fivefold ministry is David said one
[54:11] thing I desired that I will seek after
[54:14] that I may dwell the house the Lord all
[54:16] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[54:18] of the Lord and to acquire in a simple
[54:20] the beauty today is not the preachers
[54:22] themselves it's the Word of God that
[54:25] they're preaching to us the beautiful
[54:27] thing amongst us today is not each other
[54:29] it's the promise of God that is
[54:31] unfailing amen and that's what David
[54:34] said that's why when he said I want to
[54:36] live in God's house so I can see the
[54:38] beauty of God I can see the character of
[54:40] Jesus
[54:42] now let me get to some quotes from
[54:44] brother Brandon you know now we know
[54:46] David said I set my affection to the
[54:48] house of God in other words David said
[54:50] I'm gonna set my heart on the church I'm
[54:53] gonna love church more than everything
[54:54] else cuz program tells us that same
[54:56] thing
[54:58] Colossians has set your affections on
[55:00] things above no brother Brandon tells us
[55:04] this brother branham says this he says
[55:09] this is God keeps his word fifty-seven
[55:15] to go to church you don't have to tell
[55:19] them people that through rain they'll go
[55:21] through death to go to church sure they
[55:23] love it they just got to get there
[55:25] that's all there is to it it's their
[55:27] life if they don't they feel like
[55:29] they're perishing amen
[55:31] if you don't go to church you feel like
[55:34] you're dying and the church said if you
[55:36] don't be like that and you're already
[55:38] dead right you're already dead if you
[55:42] don't you should feel done it when you
[55:43] don't go to church if you don't you're
[55:45] already dead you're not born again you
[55:47] need to get born again
[55:50] levan said you go there to worship and
[55:52] to go home refreshed we are gonna leave
[55:55] this church service refreshed now I'm
[55:57] not leaving physically but we're gonna
[55:59] end this church and I'm going to stay in
[56:00] my house and I'm gonna be refreshing
[56:02] God's presence that means afterwards we
[56:05] should be able to treat each other with
[56:06] love and kindness before we go to bed
[56:07] right if I'm in my family I can't it's
[56:10] my hug my son something's wrong fresh
[56:17] when I leave the church amen the man
[56:21] said if you complain about going to
[56:23] church he says you never touched the
[56:24] resurrection brother when you when the
[56:27] resurrections come into your heart you
[56:29] long to do it there's something that you
[56:32] just can't keep away from it
[56:33] something inside Alleluia well the RAM
[56:38] said if you love God he says you
[56:41] couldn't why are you away from church
[56:44] you couldn't chain you away from it you
[56:46] can't hide a believer from his God Amen
[56:51] you'd find a way if someone tied you up
[56:54] in Chains
[56:54] their wires you find a way to break
[56:56] those chains and wires chips is just to
[56:58] go to church that's the brother Ram says
[57:05] wow it's so true he said there's
[57:10] something wrong with you if you love the
[57:12] world better than you love prayer
[57:13] meetings or you rather watch a
[57:15] television program to pray there's
[57:17] something wrong with you if we rather
[57:18] spend time on our phones and pray
[57:20] something's wrong with us god help us
[57:22] all and everybody should have say amen
[57:24] to that
[57:24] amen I'll say to everybody we feel like
[57:27] we need more time on our phone or
[57:29] something wrong with us
[57:30] we need to pray more all right from
[57:36] Graham said if I live in a city and they
[57:40] just believe one thing that Jesus was
[57:42] divine yet all the rest was wrong so if
[57:45] they only believed that Jesus was God
[57:46] and yet all the other doctor was wrong
[57:48] brother Brown said I go to that church
[57:52] if I only agree with one thing they
[57:55] preached for the RAM side still go to
[57:57] that church how many people feel that
[57:58] way most people just sit at home and if
[58:01] they just disagree on one thing it's the
[58:03] opposite for most people they can agree
[58:05] on 99% but if one thing's wrong they
[58:07] won't go to church
[58:08] my brother Graham says the opposite if I
[58:09] disagree on 99 and I've got one I'll go
[58:12] to church there oh my they got through a
[58:16] prophet he said if I can't get a whole
[58:19] loaf of bread I'll take a slice
[58:20] I'll go listen worship the Lord show him
[58:23] I'm doing my part I wanted to know I'm
[58:25] alive
[58:26] I want everybody know which side I'm on
[58:31] other lujah
[58:36] x1 he says we must he says seeing the
[58:41] day is approaching we must assemble
[58:42] ourselves more off together we must love
[58:45] in our hearts to come to church
[58:47] if we don't love coming to God he said
[58:50] love God coming together he said I think
[58:53] we should constantly long to be in
[58:55] worship anywhere to worship the Lord
[58:58] that should be our constant longing you
[59:00] know I can't wait to get to church
[59:01] I can't wait to be in God's presence and
[59:03] if you love God that's how you feel
[59:05] that's right
[59:08] well the banner says this Christ the
[59:10] mystery don't stay home if God is in
[59:13] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[59:16] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[59:19] here to fellowship with your brothers to
[59:23] see God must not be in people's hearts
[59:25] if they're not constantly waiting to get
[59:28] the church they can shake people's hands
[59:30] and be in God's house God must up either
[59:32] because of God's there you can't wait to
[59:34] get there hallelujah and again this is
[59:40] what brother Branham says so I ask again
[59:41] do all the people that say they believe
[59:43] everything brother Branham says do they
[59:44] believe this
[59:45] are they longing to get to church are
[59:47] they constantly they could could someone
[59:49] not wire them away from church is that
[59:51] how much they love God hold on Loran
[59:55] says the Holy Spirit makes you so hungry
[59:59] to go to church you can't stay away from
[1:00:01] church that's in part in 1963 you're so
[1:00:05] hungry you can't stay away from church
[1:00:10] in convinced then concerned brother have
[1:00:13] said the Spirit of God will run you
[1:00:15] right straight to the church every time
[1:00:17] the door opens for fellowship who will
[1:00:22] run you there not Satan Saint will keep
[1:00:24] you away the Holy Ghost will run you
[1:00:26] church every time the doors are open I
[1:00:28] mean Sunday morning Sunday night if it's
[1:00:30] there we have a Sunday night service
[1:00:31] Wednesday night Saturday night service
[1:00:34] if the Holy Spirit's in you it will
[1:00:36] drive you there hallelujah all right
[1:00:41] Oprah who said the American people want
[1:00:44] to be entertained they say all on
[1:00:46] Wednesday night to see who loves sushi
[1:00:47] or whatever program it is
[1:00:49] that shows what's in your heart if you
[1:00:51] love God you'd be at church brother
[1:00:54] Branham says you've got to get back to
[1:00:57] the church back to the Bible back to
[1:01:00] Christ amen Loran says is if you don't
[1:01:05] have a home church you'll die
[1:01:07] spiritually you'll just win no way
[1:01:09] that's what I was telling some of the
[1:01:11] brother was on our way I have a place
[1:01:16] where you call that place your home just
[1:01:19] wondering which is led astray what the
[1:01:21] Bible said you're deceived you're led
[1:01:23] astray you're just wandering you really
[1:01:25] don't have a home you have to have a
[1:01:27] home church or you're led astray by the
[1:01:29] enemy that's right program said this he
[1:01:33] prays for new converts in 1960 and in
[1:01:36] his I be not afraid he says may they
[1:01:39] find a good hold a good church home and
[1:01:41] there remain faithful at the post of
[1:01:45] duty until death shall set them free
[1:01:49] from this earthly course amen we should
[1:01:57] we equally go there until death God has
[1:02:01] not as a place where he wants us to stay
[1:02:03] there until he returns amen perhaps that
[1:02:07] every man ought to have a home church
[1:02:09] not just from pillar to post church
[1:02:14] somewhere where you pay your time and
[1:02:17] somewhere that you help support the
[1:02:18] cause take your choice but don't never
[1:02:21] disfellowship the other man because he
[1:02:23] don't belong with your group Amen
[1:02:27] hallelujah I think we know most of these
[1:02:31] huh I don't think I need to keep going
[1:02:33] on those because most of us know this
[1:02:37] now look what brother Branham said I
[1:02:39] told you this a few weeks ago and
[1:02:40] knoweth it not 1965 brother Branham said
[1:02:43] now we got in towards daylight this
[1:02:46] morning so Sunday morning he got into
[1:02:49] Jefferson on a Sunday morning and I had
[1:02:51] about three hours of sleep and I'm
[1:02:54] pretty tired but when the church when it
[1:02:57] come time to come to church why I come
[1:03:00] down so
[1:03:03] came to church on three hours of sleep
[1:03:05] after driving all night
[1:03:09] brother Nevelson why don't you just go
[1:03:11] up and greet the people and talk to them
[1:03:12] and he said brother no I haven't even
[1:03:14] opened my Bible hardly
[1:03:15] he said well go out and say something
[1:03:18] and sister now I don't know how you do
[1:03:20] it he's a very persuasive fella he said
[1:03:24] brother man ends up preaching a message
[1:03:26] and knoweth it not about revelation
[1:03:28] three in the layers interchange and
[1:03:30] speaks about thus saith the Lord I
[1:03:32] believe he gave up he gave a few thus
[1:03:34] say the Lord's in this message on three
[1:03:37] hours of sleep I'm not saying that
[1:03:39] people work all night you know they have
[1:03:40] to come to church but I'm just saying
[1:03:42] look at the example brother Branham said
[1:03:45] he preached an hour and 45 minutes on
[1:03:48] three hours of sleep he could have
[1:03:50] stayed at home and slept when he came to
[1:03:52] the house of God to be with the people
[1:03:54] of God he didn't want them to be a
[1:03:56] church and him laying at home that's how
[1:04:00] a prophet modeled his preaching that's
[1:04:03] why I love about brother Branham he just
[1:04:04] didn't preach things he lived what he
[1:04:06] preached and that's what we must do we
[1:04:08] must live what we preach well Graham
[1:04:13] says this how can you stay at home and
[1:04:17] be as good of a Christian as you would
[1:04:19] be a church you can't do it you cannot
[1:04:24] be a good Christian if you don't go to
[1:04:26] church he says read the word the Holy
[1:04:28] Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is
[1:04:31] God's spiritual diet first church the
[1:04:34] Holy Spirit's the one who brings it to
[1:04:35] you places it in your heart with
[1:04:38] Thanksgiving you honor it amen so the
[1:04:41] very least we should do is come to God's
[1:04:43] house and thank him for the Word of God
[1:04:44] that's the very least we should say God
[1:04:48] make it so real to me and I can take
[1:04:50] this sermon that daddy's preaching and
[1:04:53] uncle Simon's preach it make it so real
[1:04:55] to me and lord I thank you for this and
[1:04:57] let me live what you've preached to me
[1:04:59] amen you can't be as good of a Christian
[1:05:03] if we don't hear the word of God no my
[1:05:05] turn don't have a choice
[1:05:06] what's your welven choice in a few short
[1:05:08] years and you have to choose up to the
[1:05:10] side am I gonna be a good of a Christian
[1:05:12] to stay at home or my gonna be the best
[1:05:14] Christian I can be ignored of the house
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:16] I hope you'll choose to go to the house
[1:05:19] of God well the man who said the fellow
[1:05:22] told me I can be a Christian and stay at
[1:05:24] home just as well brother Branham said
[1:05:25] no you can't you've got to be together
[1:05:28] with the rest of the body
[1:05:29] he's bless us together and how many
[1:05:31] places in Christ Jesus amen program said
[1:05:37] above all things under God and honor his
[1:05:40] house above everything under God honor
[1:05:44] his house okay now let me ask you a few
[1:05:48] questions
[1:05:50] actually let me read its thirsting for
[1:05:52] life 1960 the pleasure of a Christian is
[1:05:55] serving the Lord at the house of God it
[1:05:58] should be our joy not a burden it should
[1:06:01] be a joy and pleasure to go to God's
[1:06:03] house hear the word of God and serve God
[1:06:05] don't you like to come to church and
[1:06:07] pray for people don't you like to come
[1:06:09] to church and sing not a special or sing
[1:06:11] for him or just lift up your hands to
[1:06:13] God doesn't that make you feel good
[1:06:15] that's to bring you pleasure because
[1:06:16] God's Spirit is anointing you right it's
[1:06:18] freshly raining down upon you and it's
[1:06:20] giving you all the spiritual vitamins
[1:06:22] and all the all the benefits he's
[1:06:24] loading you with daily as we saw earlier
[1:06:25] and you get to be closer to God you get
[1:06:29] to feel God's presence and know that
[1:06:31] he's with you there could hardly be any
[1:06:33] better benefit than that did it for God
[1:06:35] presence to dwell with us continually
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:40] hallelujah brother Graham said when we
[1:06:44] sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:06:46] the Holy Ghost comes upon us empowering
[1:06:49] us with gifts signs wonders and miracles
[1:06:51] it's the closest thing to heaven there
[1:06:54] is on earth
[1:06:54] hey management praise God think about
[1:06:57] how the miracles the different miracles
[1:06:59] we've had in our church in our sister
[1:07:02] Murray being healed of the bleeding my
[1:07:05] wife being healed of migraines I was
[1:07:07] healed twice in service think of all
[1:07:09] those blessings that's the closest
[1:07:11] tweaking
[1:07:14] is the church his first debate with
[1:07:18] other believers bless word and become
[1:07:20] empowered Christians amen that's that's
[1:07:23] what God wants us to do we can feel like
[1:07:25] heaven comes down to earth
[1:07:27] hallelujah now let me share a few things
[1:07:35] here I want to share this from my heart
[1:07:37] so I said this before when I said the
[1:07:41] home church is the most powerful weapon
[1:07:44] against Satan the home churches revival
[1:07:50] services are great but the home church
[1:07:53] services are the most powerful weapons
[1:07:56] that God has for the church and this is
[1:08:00] based on something sister Wendy shared
[1:08:02] with me that I preached and I I didn't
[1:08:03] even realize it I preached on the waters
[1:08:05] of separation have you ever studied that
[1:08:07] brother okay if some if somebody or
[1:08:15] something died in there that the waters
[1:08:17] in separation after three days and they
[1:08:20] had to clean out their house and three
[1:08:21] days they'd go get sprinkled they still
[1:08:22] could I come to the outer court yet then
[1:08:25] they had to come back on the seventh day
[1:08:27] so four days later they had to be
[1:08:29] sprinkled once they got sprinkled on the
[1:08:31] seventh day now they could come into the
[1:08:33] outer court they could sacrifice an
[1:08:35] animal and then they could see the
[1:08:37] priest go to the holy place and if it
[1:08:38] was if it was the name of torment they
[1:08:40] could see the high priests you know they
[1:08:41] know he brought in the holy supporters
[1:08:43] right but if he thought something dead
[1:08:45] he couldn't even get into the outer
[1:08:47] court and that's how we are because the
[1:08:49] Bible says we can grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:08:51] if we watch one evil thing or if we say
[1:08:54] one lie then we are cut off from God's
[1:08:57] presence that's the time when we don't
[1:09:00] even join coming to church because the
[1:09:04] Bible said that if they didn't get
[1:09:05] sprinkled they were cut off from the
[1:09:08] congregation so God showed a beautiful
[1:09:10] time and program said that type caused a
[1:09:12] Jewish rabbi to get the baptism of the
[1:09:14] Holy Ghost and speak in tongues that's
[1:09:16] how powerful that type is and sister
[1:09:19] Wendy was sharing this quote this type
[1:09:21] with me she said and the Bible says we
[1:09:24] get sprinkled on the third day and the
[1:09:25] seventh thing well that works out to
[1:09:27] Wednesday
[1:09:27] Sunday because Sunday that Monday
[1:09:30] Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday is the third
[1:09:31] day and then four days later is Sunday
[1:09:36] so it works out beautifully we need to
[1:09:39] get the anointing on Wednesday get the
[1:09:41] noisy on Sunday and we'll be back in
[1:09:43] God's presence you see it works out it's
[1:09:47] a beautiful time that's why the home
[1:09:49] church is the most powerful weapon
[1:09:51] against Satan it's getting sprinkle it's
[1:09:55] gonna know anything on Wednesday
[1:09:56] anointing on Sunday and then we're back
[1:09:58] and perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] now let me ask you what is more powerful
[1:10:04] which testimony is more powerful you get
[1:10:07] excited and refreshed by God once every
[1:10:10] six months when we have a special
[1:10:11] meetings or you get anointed every
[1:10:16] Wednesday and Sunday and get excited
[1:10:18] every Wednesday and Sunday what's more
[1:10:19] powerful which one do you think is more
[1:10:20] powerful Pais a week that's more
[1:10:25] powerful you know what brother Graham
[1:10:27] said you loved about brother Neville was
[1:10:29] that he was the same man every day he
[1:10:33] wasn't he never said he wasn't up and
[1:10:35] down one day the next he was steady on
[1:10:38] fire loving God he said he was steady
[1:10:40] every single day he said he's always
[1:10:43] been Ormond Neville always the same man
[1:10:45] see so that shows Hermann Neville lived
[1:10:49] in the Holy of Holies and we've got to
[1:10:52] live in the Holies of Holies
[1:10:53] always refreshed always the same always
[1:10:55] in his presence always worshipped me
[1:10:57] always saying our lives are saying holy
[1:10:59] holy holy Lord God Almighty which and
[1:11:05] along the same lines which is a true
[1:11:08] test of spiritual maturity someone who
[1:11:10] can be early to church once every six
[1:11:13] months and get excited to pray for the
[1:11:16] guest preacher coming in one every six
[1:11:18] months or every service you come early
[1:11:21] to pray and seek God every service which
[1:11:25] one shows more maturity the one who can
[1:11:28] faithfully serve God every single
[1:11:31] service
[1:11:37] the Bible says how often should we be
[1:11:39] renewed the Bible said the Bible said be
[1:11:41] renewed day by day
[1:11:43] the Bible says die daily so your and I
[1:11:48] our behavior in our local church is the
[1:11:51] true test and the true the the true
[1:11:55] witness of our spiritual condition
[1:11:57] whether good or bad and the church said
[1:12:00] how you act in your home church how
[1:12:03] faithful you are to your home Church
[1:12:05] your post of duty is the true litmus
[1:12:07] test for your spiritual walk with God it
[1:12:10] shows which side or it shows how close
[1:12:13] you're living to God that's exactly
[1:12:16] right so which is more powerful because
[1:12:20] it's someone who's more on fire every
[1:12:22] time every time the doors are open or
[1:12:23] someone who just gets excited or
[1:12:25] dedicated when they know a guest
[1:12:27] preachers coming in it's the faithful
[1:12:29] Christian its faithful you want to be
[1:12:33] faithful by God's grace all right
[1:12:37] now let's look here briefly at the
[1:12:41] attack on the fivefold ministry okay
[1:12:44] just give me about 15 more minutes by
[1:12:46] God's grace I throw it really hurts I'm
[1:12:48] going back to work and sing-song leading
[1:12:51] and preaching my throat really hurts so
[1:12:53] I need to rest after the service I don't
[1:12:57] want to lose my voice again I told the
[1:12:59] Lord I take better care of my voice I'll
[1:13:01] try not to shout as much well let's see
[1:13:05] what brother Ram said brother Graham
[1:13:08] said in the church age book
[1:13:16] Quora the chorus of against Moses and
[1:13:19] Aaron the prophet in the fight and the
[1:13:21] ministry the priesthood the prophet
[1:13:23] priesthood and that's tight today -
[1:13:25] brother Branham in the five hole
[1:13:26] ministry prophet priesthood chorus spoke
[1:13:30] against them is that we're all holy we
[1:13:31] all can minister we can all burn incense
[1:13:33] before God brother Graham said the
[1:13:36] chorus today chorus a day have say
[1:13:41] they've styled themselves the fishers of
[1:13:43] men
[1:13:44] and the founders of a move of God and
[1:13:46] they say the gifted Ministry of
[1:13:48] Ephesians 4 10 through 13 that God gave
[1:13:52] the church has failed how did you get
[1:13:55] sent Cora says Moses and Aaron have
[1:13:58] failed we can all do this we went to
[1:14:01] voice of God and one of the brothers I
[1:14:03] love him
[1:14:04] but he said the fivefold ministry has
[1:14:06] failed oh my church Oh Cora is the one
[1:14:15] who says Moses brother man tells us the
[1:14:18] cores of today say the fivefold ministry
[1:14:20] has failed
[1:14:21] we just gotta lean on brother branham
[1:14:25] are you gonna believe brother branham or
[1:14:27] somebody a voice of God or somebody in
[1:14:29] Arizona or somebody in in Ohio who are
[1:14:31] you gonna believe we're gonna believe
[1:14:33] the Word of God amen
[1:14:35] well Adam said here we are right in the
[1:14:38] midst of the fulfillment of prophecy
[1:14:39] called the gang sayings of Korah and
[1:14:42] they don't even know they fulfilled it
[1:14:44] so anyone who criticizes the fivefold
[1:14:47] ministry says it's failed these
[1:14:48] preachers are no good all these things
[1:14:50] like that they are the cores of today
[1:14:53] when they're Preet when they're speaking
[1:14:54] about the true preachers like I said I'm
[1:14:57] not talking about the preachers who who
[1:14:58] commit adultery and are hungry for money
[1:15:01] and lust after things of the world they
[1:15:03] are chorus you know there there there
[1:15:04] Balaam i'ts there Balaam eyes when I'm
[1:15:06] talking about the true fivefold ministry
[1:15:08] when people speak against that and say
[1:15:10] it's failed they are the cores of today
[1:15:12] and we've got to be the Aaron up today
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:15] we got to be the true ministry we got we
[1:15:17] got a rally around the Moses of the day
[1:15:18] brother brands ministry amen
[1:15:21] it's exactly right brother Graham said
[1:15:25] this he said this seven
[1:15:28] church age mention messenger will be in
[1:15:30] that word exactly as God gave it to Paul
[1:15:33] he won't deviate from that word for one
[1:15:36] moment not by one iota brother branham
[1:15:42] would be in the word exactly as God gave
[1:15:44] it to Paul so show me where did Paul
[1:15:47] ever say I'm the only one that preaches
[1:15:49] I have the trkage messenger I'm the only
[1:15:51] one who preaches everybody else sit down
[1:15:53] and shut up
[1:15:53] when did Paul ever say that he never
[1:15:55] said that he told Timothy to preach the
[1:15:58] word be instant in season out of season
[1:16:01] rightly divide the word of truth
[1:16:03] amen so anyone that says only brother
[1:16:07] branham should preach they broken the
[1:16:10] pattern of the Holy Spirit and now there
[1:16:13] they've taken an antichrist spirit now
[1:16:14] they can be forgiven if they repent but
[1:16:17] they've got an antichrist spirit
[1:16:19] Alleluia well Graham says the true
[1:16:24] church is the continuation of the book
[1:16:26] of Acts so any church that doesn't
[1:16:28] continue live preachers live five fold
[1:16:31] ministry creatures is breaking the Word
[1:16:33] of God it's exactly right now some
[1:16:37] people say well brother Ram told people
[1:16:39] they can play tapes that was only
[1:16:40] there's only three there's only three
[1:16:43] quotes on tape churches and two of them
[1:16:46] say you know you should go to church and
[1:16:48] not have tape service the one time
[1:16:50] brother Graham said you could have tape
[1:16:51] service was when there was no churches
[1:16:53] around you because I just read you the
[1:16:55] quote where brother Graham said if I
[1:16:57] disagreed on 99% and just agreed on one
[1:17:00] thing I would go to that church amen
[1:17:03] brother Brandon did not tell people to
[1:17:06] stay home and stay away from Christians
[1:17:08] he modeled it and live by gather with
[1:17:11] other Christians come to the house of
[1:17:12] God see the beauty of God hear the
[1:17:14] beautiful Word of God receive it
[1:17:16] leave loaded with all the blessings and
[1:17:19] spiritual promises of God that you might
[1:17:21] be able to serve God and live the right
[1:17:23] kind of Christian life amen
[1:17:26] well the band said the true church will
[1:17:28] I strive to be like the book of Acts
[1:17:32] hallelujah all right
[1:17:35] now let me know
[1:17:36] do a few more years this one came by
[1:17:38] God's grace hope everybody understands
[1:17:40] and I'm not attacking this precious
[1:17:42] brother I'm not attacking these precious
[1:17:43] brothers in Jeffersonville but on the
[1:17:45] show I'm telling you is that they say
[1:17:47] brother branham they say they're fine
[1:17:50] brother branham but their brother Brown
[1:17:51] shows that they're not because they're
[1:17:53] attacking and saying the fivefold
[1:17:54] ministry fails they're going against the
[1:17:57] very word that they say they believe so
[1:18:01] here's the attack here's here's someone
[1:18:03] they attack they want less live
[1:18:05] preaching but member God's pattern from
[1:18:07] Acts cannot change God always used a man
[1:18:11] to keep the garden a living man I never
[1:18:14] had a dead man - till the till the
[1:18:17] gardener - the soil and that's how God
[1:18:19] that's a church a woman represents a
[1:18:21] garden right and so a church represents
[1:18:23] a garden and God always had a living man
[1:18:26] tilling the soil working those hearts
[1:18:28] right breaking up the stony with the
[1:18:30] stony grounds of the heart right
[1:18:31] breaking up the fallow ground that he
[1:18:33] might plant the seed of God's Word in
[1:18:35] the hearts of the people and if you
[1:18:37] order it if I water with price it'll
[1:18:39] grow off into a great heavily plant a
[1:18:42] pen it will produce the fruit of the
[1:18:44] Spirit if we let God's Word break up our
[1:18:47] follow grounds and we take all the rocks
[1:18:49] out and we have good honest hearts
[1:18:51] before God people say brother Branham is
[1:18:57] their pastor but brother Branham said in
[1:18:59] the future home I will always be your
[1:19:01] pastor so brother Rama even himself says
[1:19:05] I'm not always going to be a bastard
[1:19:06] well brother Ram cannot be your pastor
[1:19:08] then because he said he wouldn't always
[1:19:10] be their pastor but but no
[1:19:16] accountability my pastor what they're
[1:19:18] really saying is that I'm not
[1:19:19] accountable to any living man I'm
[1:19:21] accountable to a dead man well either
[1:19:23] that's not in the scripture we never
[1:19:25] find that Christians are always
[1:19:28] accountable to the leaders the living
[1:19:30] leaders that God places them for example
[1:19:33] Paul told Timothy warned that warn them
[1:19:36] that are unruly if a person who has
[1:19:38] brother Rama as their pastor is breaking
[1:19:40] the Word of God they're not going to
[1:19:42] play the tape where brother branham
[1:19:43] rebukes their sin and their brother
[1:19:46] random can't leave the tape and warn
[1:19:48] them of their
[1:19:50] hey brother branham cannot administer
[1:19:56] church discipline right you need a
[1:20:00] living pastor to go out if there if
[1:20:02] there's a if there's a discrepancy
[1:20:03] between two families
[1:20:05] you can't take a tape and set it to our
[1:20:07] tape of itself won't go and try to bring
[1:20:10] reconciliation just sit there you need a
[1:20:16] living loan him to go and unite two
[1:20:18] families are two individuals because if
[1:20:20] one person has odd against another Jesus
[1:20:22] I'd go to that person if that doesn't
[1:20:24] work get somebody else and then bring it
[1:20:26] before the church if you tell the tape
[1:20:29] we'll take you know you you've got the
[1:20:31] announces before the church they won't
[1:20:32] repent the tape will just sit there it
[1:20:35] won't do it you need a living vessel to
[1:20:38] carry out Church order so people are
[1:20:40] saying I don't have to answer to anybody
[1:20:41] I don't want to be accountable I can
[1:20:44] live however I want and nobody can tell
[1:20:45] me I'm wrong that's what they're saying
[1:20:47] when they're saying oh brother branham's
[1:20:49] my pastor they're saying they don't want
[1:20:51] accountability remember Hebrews 13 said
[1:20:55] that God's ministers will give an
[1:20:57] account of the souls of the people that
[1:20:59] means you know that everyone is
[1:21:01] accountable to a pastor everyone is
[1:21:04] accountable to a pastor or a preacher
[1:21:06] because that's what God's pattern always
[1:21:08] is all right one of the biggest concerns
[1:21:13] about the attacks on the fivefold
[1:21:15] ministry is that people are saying every
[1:21:18] word brother random sentence that saith
[1:21:19] the Lord now we went to Jeffersonville
[1:21:22] and I asked them point blank the
[1:21:24] grandson of one of the program's closest
[1:21:27] friends in Jeffersonville
[1:21:28] I asked him point-blank do people in
[1:21:31] brother and his family and do you
[1:21:32] believe every word brother Bram said
[1:21:34] there's a snake Lord and they basically
[1:21:36] said yes because we don't know what's
[1:21:38] the state Florida what what's not and I
[1:21:42] thought how sad is that they're so
[1:21:44] afraid that they're gonna make a mistake
[1:21:46] with us saith the Lord that they just
[1:21:48] say everything is though saith the Lord
[1:21:49] well brother branham said that's
[1:21:51] tommyrot if you if you say every word I
[1:21:54] said as I say the Lord brother incest
[1:21:55] tommyrot he said that's one of the most
[1:21:58] awfulest thing you can do is make me
[1:21:59] infallible he said that
[1:22:02] see that proves those people who are
[1:22:04] scared that proves they're not born
[1:22:06] again because the holy spirit does not
[1:22:08] give the spirit of fear amen
[1:22:11] but a power love and a sound mind and I
[1:22:13] told the brother to his face I said well
[1:22:15] this is how I do that I know I know
[1:22:17] every word brother Ram said it's not
[1:22:19] enough say the Lord but this is how you
[1:22:21] know the Holy Spirit will guide you into
[1:22:23] all truth amen
[1:22:24] the Holy Ghost will guide you than that
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost will show you he'll point
[1:22:29] to the Word of God if you're not sure
[1:22:30] the Holy Ghost will always point you to
[1:22:32] God's Bible and then you need two or
[1:22:34] three witnesses and then that will tell
[1:22:37] you that it's thus saith the Lord
[1:22:39] just like with water baptism there's not
[1:22:42] two or three witnesses of people being
[1:22:43] baptized father son Holy Ghost so you
[1:22:46] know that's not thus saith the Lord but
[1:22:48] there's five examples of Jesus Christ
[1:22:50] Lord Jesus Jesus Lord all these things
[1:22:52] and so the Bible tells us what the st.
[1:22:55] the Lord is amen
[1:22:59] so even romance family members say every
[1:23:02] word he said was up the son say the Lord
[1:23:04] and yet brother Graham said that's time
[1:23:06] you run that's awful to see they're
[1:23:09] scared and that's because they're not
[1:23:10] they're not they don't have to gift him
[1:23:12] down their life and that's what I told
[1:23:14] him I said a preacher with the gift of
[1:23:16] God can rightly divide the word of God
[1:23:18] because it's not his ability it's the
[1:23:20] gift from Christ the gift from Christ to
[1:23:23] edify the body to position the body to
[1:23:25] do all those things that Bible ministry
[1:23:27] supposed to do
[1:23:28] he's got power from the Holy Ghost into
[1:23:30] it it's not him it's the Holy Ghost
[1:23:31] through him amen remember brother Ram
[1:23:37] sharam says the spirit of the nickel and
[1:23:40] ISM is to conquer the lady it's to put
[1:23:43] all the holiness in one man and the
[1:23:45] church has no longer any Holy Ghost
[1:23:47] that's what they're trying to his
[1:23:48] brother branham they're just trying to
[1:23:49] give all the holiness to brother Branham
[1:23:51] when he sees the only one that can do
[1:23:53] he's all of it can do miracles we better
[1:23:55] listen to a tape have the Spirit of God
[1:23:56] here that's okay it's okay listen to
[1:23:58] tape in your home but it should be the
[1:24:00] same spirit that is willing to brother
[1:24:02] Ram should now be on preachers a day to
[1:24:04] preach the same word to raise our faith
[1:24:06] to get the same results amen and we've
[1:24:10] got to be careful today like you with
[1:24:12] 5-pole ministry not to let them be
[1:24:14] annoying to once we've got to happen
[1:24:16] that's why we've got to come too early
[1:24:18] to church and pray and get the Holy
[1:24:20] Spirit on us
[1:24:20] so at so Paul said everyone has a song
[1:24:23] everyone has a hint everyone has a
[1:24:25] revelation everyone has a tongue
[1:24:26] everybody should have some leadership
[1:24:28] with the Holy Spirit when they come to
[1:24:30] church that's exactly right
[1:24:33] amen brother Branham said the highest
[1:24:38] office in the world is a minister now
[1:24:40] that's not to make the preachers
[1:24:42] prideful but that's to show you that the
[1:24:45] minister is higher than a tape boy and
[1:24:48] there's a quote from 1965 brother
[1:24:50] Branham talking about Leo and Jean he
[1:24:52] said they used to make tapes he said but
[1:24:54] now they're feeding and shepherding
[1:24:55] people he said how much greater is it to
[1:24:58] shepherd and feed and preach to God's
[1:24:59] people than it is to make a tape so the
[1:25:04] highest office is is having a gift of
[1:25:07] God and preaching the Word of God that
[1:25:09] brings the people to life how many want
[1:25:11] to be in the fullness how many want to
[1:25:16] begin a full inscription this is the way
[1:25:18] today and say God make me more like that
[1:25:21] I receive that to give thanks and to
[1:25:23] leave a refreshed Christian amen that's
[1:25:26] that's the real gospel aim head to be
[1:25:29] formed to the maturity of Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] through the preaching of the word that's
[1:25:35] exactly right
[1:25:38] Orry glory let me make sure I got
[1:25:41] everything covered I want to say here
[1:25:42] tonight and the other attacks
[1:25:47] Sarge's you know with the increase of
[1:25:50] internet people can hear so many voices
[1:25:53] they have preached on this when I preach
[1:25:55] the the Shepard series there are so many
[1:25:57] voices are so many preachers I can now
[1:25:59] listen to every preacher but when we do
[1:26:02] that is sometimes causes confusion well
[1:26:04] which one's right is my pastor right or
[1:26:06] is the other pastor right and if we feed
[1:26:09] on too many voices
[1:26:13] we and then we become those who are
[1:26:16] tossed out that they into the next and
[1:26:19] we don't even hear what God is trying to
[1:26:21] tell us through our local ministry a
[1:26:24] local fivefold ministry met to limit the
[1:26:28] number of voices that we hear remember
[1:26:32] that God wants us to feed on the Word of
[1:26:34] God coming through our local ministry
[1:26:38] praise God
[1:26:41] okay I think I'll finish with that
[1:26:44] there's a whole lot more we can preach
[1:26:47] on Lord willing next week we may look at
[1:26:50] this
[1:26:50] I just want to revisit this because
[1:26:52] we've had so many conversations and so
[1:26:57] many things said about the importance of
[1:26:59] a local church and what is the Bible
[1:27:01] ministry has it failed or not and I hope
[1:27:03] that was a blessing for you to see all
[1:27:06] those promises and all those quotes
[1:27:08] where brother Branham was constantly
[1:27:11] supporting the home church I'll just do
[1:27:15] a few more let me just do these last few
[1:27:17] I know a little longer my brother
[1:27:20] Branham always supported the local
[1:27:21] church brother Graham said do not give
[1:27:23] me your ties when he was going to a
[1:27:26] healing campaign he said give those to
[1:27:28] your home church don't give your tithing
[1:27:30] to visiting ministers that goes to the
[1:27:32] home Church to support the home church
[1:27:34] well the Brad said when people would
[1:27:36] write him letters and ask him questions
[1:27:38] that were personal he said I always tell
[1:27:40] them go ask your pastor but see people
[1:27:43] today they would need it they need an
[1:27:45] answer they'll ask any pastor thus any
[1:27:47] preacher and they don't have the amount
[1:27:51] of respect that brother branham's that
[1:27:52] we should have for the local pastor and
[1:27:57] that's the kind of respect that we need
[1:27:59] or the random said if you're gonna miss
[1:28:01] a church service he said get permission
[1:28:03] from your pastor to do it because you
[1:28:07] need to be at your post of duty not
[1:28:08] expect you to be at your post of duty
[1:28:10] need to be in there alright I hope
[1:28:17] that's a
[1:28:18] by the grace of God let's stay in here
[1:28:19] Malachi you can come right here I don't
[1:28:22] know where myself out don't know were
[1:28:23] you out but as I said all these
[1:28:27] conversations I've had and the
[1:28:28] revelation about the third day and the
[1:28:30] seventh day that being such a powerful
[1:28:32] revelation I thought it was important to
[1:28:35] revisit that and even though even at a
[1:28:37] time today where you know even in our
[1:28:39] church where we can see Satan's fart our
[1:28:41] Wednesday night and Sunday gatherings
[1:28:43] you know because of the the pipe the
[1:28:46] water pipe that burst now we're not
[1:28:48] gathering on Wednesday nights as a whole
[1:28:50] body like we used to
[1:28:51] you may feel further from each other
[1:28:53] that's just the work of Satan we've got
[1:28:55] to work to be together and now we can
[1:28:57] only have one service on Sunday so we're
[1:29:00] not having to services so it shows how
[1:29:02] to say it is battling the church but
[1:29:05] we've got to come against that we've got
[1:29:06] to mean believing God we've got to be
[1:29:09] fully trusting in God's word that he'll
[1:29:11] feed us through these weekly gatherings
[1:29:14] these these gatherings Wednesday he's
[1:29:16] gathering Sunday over than ever before
[1:29:18] we got to trust God to lead us gonna be
[1:29:21] faithful to the house and not we want to
[1:29:26] live in his presence
[1:29:27] how many would say thank you Lord for
[1:29:29] all the benefits from the preaching of
[1:29:30] the word tonight would you thank the
[1:29:31] Lord for that through preaching the word
[1:29:44] every Wednesday and Sunday in that size
[1:29:46] they all Bible and not just preaching it
[1:29:49] but living it if I preach it don't live
[1:29:52] it I'm the war I'm sorry M :
[1:29:55] but there's every time I preach it and
[1:29:58] try and pass time to forgive me my name
[1:30:01] strength the master spring I leave
[1:30:03] invited living when I'm preaching
[1:30:06] staying God's presence being edified
[1:30:09] being unified why immaturity all these
[1:30:14] blessings I just want to share something
[1:30:22] you know yesterday on base we got mostly
[1:30:24] the twentieth anniversary of my wife's
[1:30:27] my wife and I our first date when we
[1:30:29] were sinners

[1:30:33] and I came to know the message but I
[1:30:39] thought about look at the transformation

[1:30:44] we were going with with scales over eyes
[1:30:47] going to worldly movies you know not
[1:30:50] even aware that God sent a prophet I
[1:30:53] think of all the addictions I had in all
[1:30:55] the struggles I had and how high no
[1:30:57] faith that was even certain Jesus and
[1:31:01] now 20 years later I could look at my
[1:31:02] life and see the life that I live it's
[1:31:05] not I that lives its Christ that lives
[1:31:08] in me that was twenty years he could
