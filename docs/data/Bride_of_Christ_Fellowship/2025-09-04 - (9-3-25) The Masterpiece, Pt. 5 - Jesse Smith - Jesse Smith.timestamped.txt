[0:00] piece, I thought, well, I'll try to
[0:01] preach something similar to her, you
[0:02] know, that she'd be a little familiar
[0:04] with, you know, by God's grace. Uh, so I
[0:06] hope this would be a blessing here
[0:07] tonight. Uh, Matthew, I'm sorry, Mark
[0:10] chapter 4, pardon me, Mark chapter 4,
[0:16] we'll start at verse 26. Actually, here
[0:18] by God's grace,
[0:27] Mark 4:26. Uh so look at the masterpiece
[0:30] part five. Um God's prophet brother
[0:32] Brandham said that this concept of the
[0:35] wheat plant growing in three stages was
[0:38] his masterpiece and he was looking at
[0:40] the church history uh for the last 500
[0:43] years beginning with Martin Luther and
[0:45] he saw Martin Luther as a mighty
[0:47] messenger of God John Wesley and then he
[0:50] didn't name himself but he he described
[0:52] his ministry and we believe his ministry
[0:54] would be this third stage by the grace
[0:56] of God. All true prophets of God are
[0:59] humble, right? So, we wouldn't expect
[1:00] brother just to come out and say it, but
[1:02] we can see the scriptures he pointed to
[1:04] by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[1:07] Uh Mark 4:26. So, I'll read 26 27 28. We
[1:12] can read uh verse 29. By God's grace,
[1:16] and he said, "So is the kingdom of God.
[1:18] As if a man should cast seed into the
[1:20] ground, and should sleep and rise night
[1:23] and day, and the seed should spring up
[1:25] and grow, he knoweth not how. So the
[1:28] Lord Jesus is saying the kingdom of God,
[1:29] the New Testament, the kingdom of God is
[1:31] going to be like a man sewing a seed. He
[1:33] doesn't know how it grows necessarily.
[1:36] He knows all that it needs in order to
[1:37] get it to grow, but he doesn't know how
[1:39] it grows. Verse 28, for the earth
[1:42] bringeth forth fruit of herself. And
[1:44] here's the three steps Jesus taught us.
[1:46] First the blade, then the ear. After
[1:50] that the full corn in the ear. But when
[1:53] the fruit is brought I'm sorry. Let's
[1:55] read for 29 together. Ready? 1 2 3. But
[1:58] when the fruit is brought forth,
[2:00] immediately he putth in the sickle
[2:03] because the harvest is come. May God add
[2:06] his blessing to reading of his word. You
[2:07] can be seated by God's grace.
[2:11] Okay. So, you can just put this uh I'm
[2:13] just going to do a reminder up here. uh
[2:15] when we looked at the masterpiece.
[2:19] Hopefully, it'll work, you know, and
[2:20] they're never guaranteed with uh
[2:22] technology. Okay. Glory.
[2:25] It's nice to get a little bit of
[2:27] cooperation. All right. Praise God. So,
[2:30] again, I just want to say I missed
[2:31] everybody this past weekend. Hopefully,
[2:33] you missed me. I missed you. And uh we
[2:35] had some good services there uh in
[2:37] Napoleon. A couple people come up for
[2:38] prayer and said how the the messages
[2:41] were really uh timely. I preached on uh
[2:44] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[2:45] on Saturday night. Same thing I preached
[2:46] to hear by God's grace to our saints.
[2:48] And then Sunday morning I preached on uh
[2:50] the perfection of Job's spirit. Again,
[2:52] preached on Job. My wife said they're
[2:54] kind of like summaries of all the
[2:55] series, just the highlights. Uh I didn't
[2:58] didn't think I got too much new
[3:00] revelation. One fresh thought I had was
[3:02] that uh the queen of the south in order
[3:05] for her to cross the desert to see
[3:07] Solomon, she had to put on uh the feet
[3:10] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[3:12] of peace. So I just it's really
[3:14] beautiful to see how she had to put on
[3:15] the armor of God as well. I'll say like
[3:17] this all the armor that was available
[3:18] for her day. Hallelujah. Because she had
[3:21] to travel that distance and she had to
[3:22] be ready to travel and leave everything
[3:24] behind. And if she was a queen, she had
[3:26] to leave either the king behind or her
[3:27] father behind or whoever all the royalty
[3:30] had to leave behind all of her idols in
[3:31] order to find the gift of God for her
[3:34] day, which was Solomon's gift.
[3:35] Hallelujah. And then God would use that
[3:37] woman, that little old woman, we'd say,
[3:39] or little young, sorry, little young
[3:40] woman, I better say. I don't like using
[3:43] old woman in the same sentence.
[3:46] Uh God would use that sweet little young
[3:48] woman and judge all those Pharisees of
[3:51] Jesus day, condemn them to hell based
[3:52] upon her faith.
[3:55] Quite a testimony, right? Quite a
[3:57] beautiful testimony there from the Queen
[3:58] of the South. So, that was something
[4:00] that was a little fresh to me uh by the
[4:01] grace of the Lord. Now, here we can see
[4:04] that God is uh restoring the church uh
[4:08] uh from the time of Martin Luther to
[4:11] today. We we know he's restoring. Every
[4:13] historian will admit there's a
[4:15] reformation, right? There's a
[4:17] reformation that took place in uh the
[4:19] 1500s with Martin Luther. It's it's not
[4:21] even debatable, right? Everybody knows
[4:24] the church got into s such corruption
[4:27] and I'll just give you you know four uh
[4:29] I'm sorry five simple examples of the
[4:30] corruption that was in the Roman
[4:31] Catholic church the Anglican church uh
[4:34] the reason why Martin Lu Luther felt he
[4:36] had to reform the church. Okay. Uh the
[4:39] first one was the corruption and abuse
[4:41] of power. Uh the church and politics had
[4:43] been combined. Right? So the politics uh
[4:46] was run by the church. Okay. And then uh
[4:50] of course the the church was corrupted
[4:52] by wealth and its secular power. The
[4:55] bishops and popes often lived in luxury
[4:58] with many uh parishioners who were poor.
[5:01] So the preachers preachers maybe the
[5:03] priests they got richer and richer while
[5:05] the people got poor and poor. That's not
[5:08] how the that's not how the church should
[5:09] operate. Praise God. Right? Uh the Bible
[5:12] says Jesus said remember the poor that
[5:14] are among you and help them out. Praise
[5:15] God. Hallelujah. And so we know that's
[5:18] one the the the the clergy was totally
[5:20] corrupted.
[5:22] Martin Luther saw that. And one of the
[5:24] ways they became corrupted was they used
[5:25] indulgences. And you can look this up.
[5:27] It's historically accurate. Uh they sold
[5:29] indulgences where which were
[5:31] certificates promising a reduced time in
[5:34] purgatory. Now purgatory is a false
[5:36] doctrine as well, but they'd built so
[5:38] many false doctrines that they could
[5:39] build upon their false doctrines.
[5:42] Um, and so they'd have less time in
[5:44] purgatory if they would pay and buy
[5:47] these indulgences. And Martin Luther, of
[5:49] course, uh, uh, chided them for that,
[5:51] rebuked them for that.
[5:54] And so they would sell, you know, uh,
[5:56] they'd sell the ability to be forgiven
[5:57] for murder perhaps or adultery or
[6:01] fornication. They could pay money. You
[6:04] could pay money to slap a priest in the
[6:06] face. I heard that in one of the
[6:07] historical writings. Uh they were trying
[6:10] to sell people's way to heaven. And the
[6:13] gospel doesn't operate that way. You
[6:15] can't buy your way to heaven.
[6:16] Hallelujah.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; You don't buy it. You surrender to it.
[6:19] Praise God. You confess your sins. The
[6:21] Bible said Jesus went preaching forth
[6:23] and he said, "Repent for the kingdom is
[6:25] at hand." Hallelujah.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; So the real gospel, yes, if you slapped
[6:29] a priest or you murdered or adultery or
[6:32] fornication, the real gospel is repent
[6:34] of that and get a new heart so you'll
[6:37] never do it again. Amen.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the real gospel. It
[6:41] changes the heart. It changes you from a
[6:43] heart of stone to a heart of flesh.
[6:45] Hallelujah. Thank God we have hearts of
[6:47] flesh. Hallelujah. Amen. The gospel has
[6:49] changed our hearts to not want to do
[6:51] those evils again. Another one was the a
[6:54] distorted gospel. It became a worksbased
[6:57] gospel. Uh you know in those days in the
[6:59] Anglican church and the Catholic church,
[7:01] it wasn't just saved by grace through
[7:03] faith. It was saved by grace and your
[7:06] works and your ability to do uh um the
[7:10] works. I can't remember the words not
[7:12] coming to me right now, but you had to
[7:14] do the works. Oh, the uh oh, it just
[7:17] struck my mind there and I forgot it.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[7:26] &gt;&gt; you know it. I don't.
[7:29] [Laughter]
[7:31] &gt;&gt; We We used to know it.
[7:34] I've forgotten that. Um I can't yeah I
[7:36] can't think of that word. But they'd
[7:38] always built upon it wasn't enough to
[7:39] believe. You had to do certain actions
[7:41] on top of it. Now church, we know if
[7:44] somebody really gets saved, they'll want
[7:45] to do the works of God
[7:47] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says faith without
[7:49] works is dead.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; So if you do ever get the love of God in
[7:53] your heart and you get a new heart,
[7:54] you'll want to do something for the
[7:56] Lord, but your works never saved you.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ saved you.
[8:01] Hallelujah. And then the Bible said God
[8:03] even gave you that faith to be saved as
[8:05] a gift from God. Hallelujah. So
[8:08] salvation is a gift altogether. Praise
[8:10] God. But that was distorted by the
[8:13] sacraments. There it is. Sacraments.
[8:14] That's the word I was looking for. They
[8:16] have to do so many sacraments in order
[8:17] to be saved or prove that they're saved.
[8:20] Okay. One of them is their baptism, the
[8:21] sprinkling and so forth. Uh some of them
[8:23] might go full immersion. Most do
[8:25] sprinkling today as far as I understand
[8:27] at least in America.
[8:29] Uh and now the the the fourth one was uh
[8:31] the authority of scripture versus
[8:33] tradition. Uh the church in Luther's day
[8:35] got to the spot where tradition was
[8:37] almost more powerful than just the
[8:39] scripture itself.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[8:42] So if a if a previous pope or some
[8:44] church leader, some church father had
[8:46] exalted some type of tradition, then
[8:48] they would take that even if the Bible
[8:50] didn't say it, they would take that.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Now a modern one, a modern uh tradition
[8:55] is that Mary didn't die. She ascended
[8:58] straight to heaven and she was ever
[9:00] virgin. That's a modern one that uh in
[9:03] the 1900s, so the 20th century, one of
[9:05] the popes made that one of their new
[9:07] traditions. And so it doesn't matter
[9:09] what the Bible said to them because they
[9:11] made this new tradition. Tradition is
[9:13] even exalted probably higher than
[9:15] scripture.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said Mary had at least
[9:18] seven children through Joseph,
[9:20] &gt;&gt; right? Hallelujah. And so uh you know we
[9:24] we we take the scripture. The scripture
[9:25] is our absolute, not tradition.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; And church, there's nothing wrong with a
[9:29] tradition as long as it doesn't break
[9:31] the word of God.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing wrong with
[9:35] tradition. Uh just has to be with the
[9:37] word. Like I said last week, remember
[9:38] looked at last week, what's our
[9:39] tradition? We start with prayer, right?
[9:42] Singing, preaching, more prayer. That's
[9:44] just a tradition. We don't have a thus
[9:46] sayith the Lord. That's how we're
[9:47] supposed to do every service. We're just
[9:49] going by tradition.
[9:52] So uh but you know it would be wrong if
[9:54] we said this is the only way to do it.
[9:56] Everything else is evil and we'll
[9:58] condemn everything else. But we don't do
[10:00] that. Praise God. You have your service
[10:03] however you feel led to do it. Just make
[10:05] sure you're praying, worshiping, uh
[10:07] repenting of sins, offering prayer for
[10:08] the people, preaching the word of God.
[10:11] Hallelujah.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Then you have feet washing and communion
[10:14] as you feel led of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[10:16] Because the Bible didn't say you had to
[10:17] do that every time either. Praise God.
[10:19] It's a it's a fine tradition. If people
[10:21] want to do communion every service,
[10:22] that's wonderful.
[10:25] But just just just don't ever uh say,
[10:27] "Well, you've got all the truth and
[10:28] nobody else." Praise God.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Because that that becomes a a
[10:32] denomination, right? That becomes a the
[10:35] unbending way. And then you start
[10:36] condemning other people that are against
[10:38] you. Now, do I condemn certain beliefs?
[10:41] Yes. I'm not condemning the people. I'm
[10:43] condemning the evil spirits that brought
[10:45] the beliefs. Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; I believe Catholics, Lutheran,
[10:47] Methodist, Baptist, I believe they can
[10:49] all be saved, but they're not saved by
[10:51] their denomination. And we're not saved
[10:53] by our beliefs as far as uh following
[10:55] William Brandon. We're not saved by
[10:56] that. We're saved by the blood of Jesus
[10:58] Christ.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God. Hallelujah.
[11:04] God is good. Amen. And then one more. Uh
[11:05] they had clerical issues. Uh the priests
[11:08] were required to remain celibate and yet
[11:10] Peter's mother-in-law was healed by
[11:12] Jesus. See, again, you get the Catholic
[11:15] tradition like it's it's it's greater
[11:18] than the Bible.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; They say popes can't marry. Their first
[11:22] pope was married. It it's just total
[11:25] contradiction.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; It it it's trying it's it's a it's a
[11:29] it's sinking sands. In other words, they
[11:31] have no foundation. Hallelujah.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Because the scriptur is not their solid
[11:35] rock. Their tradition is their solid
[11:38] rock.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we got to be careful as
[11:41] a pastor and as you know as our church,
[11:43] we got to be careful not to let our
[11:45] traditions become unbending and and uh
[11:48] and criticize anyone who's against a
[11:50] tradition that we have.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; Because this this celibacy became such
[11:57] an issue and look at the problems it's
[11:59] caused. When I wrote my book uh 2021,
[12:02] there just came out the study from
[12:03] Pennsylvania. They studied the um all
[12:05] the Catholic parishes just in a few
[12:07] cities in Pennsylvania. friends, there
[12:09] was thousands of abuse cases and it
[12:12] stems from these men, the priests, and
[12:14] the women, nuns, even nuns, abusing
[12:16] people because they're taking this
[12:18] tradition above the word of God.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Now, you would think, you would think
[12:22] common sense would say, "Well, just get
[12:24] rid of your tradition. Come back to the
[12:26] Bible." But they won't do it, right? And
[12:28] again, I'm not condemning the people,
[12:30] but it's the system. And so, you know,
[12:33] Martin Luther saw all this and said,
[12:35] "Something's got to change." Amen.
[12:38] Praise God. And our church, if we see
[12:40] something in our life, we should look at
[12:41] our lives and say, "Lord, if something's
[12:43] out of order in my life, it needs to
[12:44] change."
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Because we can become self-righteous. We
[12:48] can become Pharisees. We can become
[12:50] Sadducees in the message here. We we we
[12:53] anybody can do that if if they fail to
[12:55] really recognize and be honest that I
[12:57] need help in my life. I'm not perfect. I
[12:59] need constantly the Holy Spirit's
[13:01] direction. I need repentance constantly.
[13:03] And I want to serve God in sincerity and
[13:05] in truth.
[13:07] Hallelujah.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, those are just five
[13:13] examples. Remember how many how many how
[13:15] many did Martin Luther nail
[13:18] good, buddy? Good. 95. Almost 100. 95
[13:22] thesis or arguments against the Catholic
[13:25] Church. He nailed them to the the the
[13:27] church door in Wittenberg in Germany.
[13:30] 95. I just gave you five.
[13:33] Okay. So, Martin Luther was a reformer.
[13:36] So, it's undeniable by history, God is
[13:39] trying to restore the church. God's
[13:41] trying to let the wheat grain go back to
[13:43] its full grain. Hallelujah. He's trying
[13:46] to get this the kingdom of God. The
[13:48] kingdom of God needs to grow back in
[13:50] three stages. Right? Now, I put a fourth
[13:52] one in there because brother Ram kind of
[13:54] brings it out. He just brings it out for
[13:56] the sake of history. Okay? So, uh the
[13:59] Lutheran really restored justification.
[14:02] Okay. Then uh sorry then John Wesley
[14:04] come around and restored sanctification.
[14:06] You got to live a sanctified or a
[14:08] purified life. That's what the word
[14:09] means.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Okay? You got to live pure and and he
[14:13] emphasized uh daily living of of clean
[14:16] living, right? Not getting drunk, not
[14:18] doing tobacco and alcohol and all these
[14:21] things. Living a clean life. Hallelujah.
[14:24] And then the Pentecostals uh they
[14:26] emphasize the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[14:28] Hallelujah. Right? And that's what I was
[14:30] raised. I was raised in a Pentecostal
[14:32] church. Uh, every week there was tongues
[14:34] and interpretation. I don't know. I just
[14:36] can't I don't know. I don't know the
[14:37] people. I don't know how accurate it
[14:39] was. But I have met a lot of people that
[14:41] just pretend to speak in tongues. I've
[14:43] met a lot of people.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Not everybody does it, but I met a lot
[14:46] of people that even told me they
[14:48] pretended to speak in tongues because of
[14:49] all the pressure. Right now, the way you
[14:52] know it's genuine is if you speak in a
[14:54] tongue and then an interpretation comes.
[14:57] And I'm talking about in a in a
[14:58] congregation. That's how you know it's
[15:00] genuine. If you speak in an unknown
[15:02] tongue and then somebody tells you the
[15:03] English meaning of that unknown tongue,
[15:06] right? That's how you know it's genuine.
[15:08] Or if you're just doing it in your
[15:09] prayer closet and and something
[15:11] supernatural happens because of that.
[15:12] Let's say you spoke in an unknown tongue
[15:14] and then somebody comes to your heart,
[15:16] you text them and you're praying for
[15:17] them and then God somehow helps them
[15:19] out,
[15:20] &gt;&gt; maybe heals them or something like that,
[15:22] right? You or or the Bible says when you
[15:24] speak in tonesues, it edifies yourself
[15:25] or you feel edified after speaking in
[15:27] tonesues. Not because I tried to pretend
[15:30] to speak in tongues,
[15:31] &gt;&gt; right? Like these my friends have told
[15:33] me and they've told me that in tears.
[15:35] They were so honest.
[15:37] They were just pretending to do it
[15:38] because the preacher said, "You had to
[15:40] do it, but you don't have to, right?" Uh
[15:43] but I was a benefit of that, you know,
[15:44] because uh uh my mother was healed of
[15:46] cancer. So because she saw the the real
[15:48] gifts operate, she had faith. Uh, and
[15:51] one of her friends woke up that morning
[15:52] in 1988 and she said, uh, the Holy
[15:55] Spirit said, uh, go tell Ruby, uh, Psalm
[15:58] 118. So, let's go to Psalm 118. I'll
[16:00] just read that just to to show again
[16:02] that because these people, you know,
[16:04] because the Pentecostals believed in the
[16:06] supernatural, it's a Psalm 100 118:17.
[16:10] I forget the name of that woman. I have
[16:11] to ask my mom, but she said the Holy
[16:13] Spirit told her, "Go tell Ruby Psalm
[16:15] 118:17,
[16:17] tell her she's going to be healed of
[16:18] cancer." Now, that's quite a something
[16:20] to tell somebody. But see, be because
[16:22] this woman believed in tongues and gifts
[16:24] and all these things, she believed God
[16:26] could talk to her.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't that beautiful? God
[16:29] can talk to you. And the verse says, now
[16:32] you can uh you can put that up there,
[16:33] honey. Uh sorry, I should have done that
[16:35] earlier, but it says, "I shall not die,
[16:37] but live and declare the works of the
[16:40] Lord."
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, I don't know how long it was.
[16:44] My mom just received it right away, but
[16:45] then my dad told me the story. They're
[16:47] going to do surgery to try to take some
[16:48] of the cancer out. My dad said that
[16:50] night while she was sleeping, my dad
[16:51] laid his hand right where the cancer was
[16:54] and he felt a hot sensation
[16:57] and he just stepped back and went to
[17:00] bed. The next day they opened her up,
[17:01] she's got the scar to this day and they
[17:04] couldn't find any cancer
[17:06] &gt;&gt; and they let her go. My dad said, "The
[17:07] first day home there at my grandma
[17:09] Ruby's grandma Emma's house, she danced
[17:11] out to the mailbox to get the mail.
[17:15] She was so full of the joy of the Lord.
[17:16] Now, that warm sensation is special
[17:18] because I remember I went out to Iowa
[17:20] last summer. I told the testimony to the
[17:21] Napoleon saints and a a man, he was
[17:23] about 300 lb, comes up for prayer. This
[17:25] was back in 2021. And it was after I
[17:28] told the story when Kristen got healed.
[17:31] She could hardly walk on her knee,
[17:32] hardly bend, not hardly walk, hardly
[17:34] bend over, bend her knee. We were
[17:35] talking about maybe doing rehab and
[17:37] Kristen came up for prayer. Brian
[17:39] Hawkins prayed for her and uh Kristen
[17:42] said the next day she's like 95% better.
[17:44] By the end of the week she could she was
[17:46] fine. Her knee hasn't bothered her since
[17:48] after hardly being able to bend and
[17:49] kneel down. I told that testimony out in
[17:52] Iowa in 2001, right? Or 2021, sorry.
[17:55] This man, his name's Danny. He's about
[17:56] 300 lb. He comes up and he says, "I I
[17:59] appreciate that testimony about Kristen.
[18:00] My knees bother me too. I can't run
[18:02] anymore. I can't even play with my kids.
[18:03] I can't get down on the ground with my
[18:05] kids." I said, "Brother, do you
[18:06] believe?" I said, he said, "Yes, I just
[18:08] prayed. I didn't feel anything. I just
[18:09] prayed as sincere as I could." He said,
[18:12] "On the drive home," this is on a
[18:14] Saturday night. He's driving home on a
[18:15] Saturday night. He's driving, you know,
[18:16] in his acceleration knee. It was He
[18:18] said, "While he's accelerating, he feels
[18:20] a hot sensation on his knee." And he
[18:22] said, "Honey, what is this?" He told me
[18:24] the story and she said, "It must be God.
[18:27] Start praising God." Amen. So, she he
[18:30] starts praising God. He said, "When they
[18:32] get home, he got out and his knee was
[18:34] completely healed." Amen.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I haven't had any pain." And
[18:38] he said, "I I've lost 100 pounds now
[18:40] because I can run. I can walk. I can
[18:42] bend my knee." So, because of Kristen's
[18:44] testimony, this man heard the word of
[18:47] God, now he's got a testimony. Praise
[18:49] God.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; There's something with that burning
[18:51] sensation of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. My dad felt it. I don't know if
[18:57] Kristen felt it exactly or if God just
[18:58] did it, but then her testimony caused
[19:00] this man to feel that burning sensation
[19:02] of the Holy Ghost. Ah, the spirit of
[19:04] burning.
[19:06] Amen. The Holy Ghost coming on somebody
[19:08] and doing a supernatural work. It's just
[19:10] letting you know that Jesus Christ is
[19:12] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[19:14] Hallelujah.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got about 20 minutes here. Okay,
[19:19] these are the shortest sermons I've
[19:20] preached in my life. It's kind of hard
[19:21] here. It should get easier each week,
[19:23] right, Malachi? It should get easier
[19:24] every week. If I know I got to do this
[19:26] every week, it should get easier. So I
[19:29] just thought you know with now uh yeah
[19:32] just with that visual I just want to go
[19:33] through that again and show this was
[19:35] brother Ram's masterpiece
[19:38] I just want to show you know again here
[19:40] uh you know why we believe we're at that
[19:42] wheat grain stage
[19:45] in other words however long it takes
[19:46] from from now you know brother's
[19:48] ministry uh till the rapture
[19:51] god is bringing that wheat seed to
[19:53] maturity okay now just so you know uh
[19:57] the Bible says The seed of God is the
[20:00] word of God.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, let's read that. Uh because
[20:03] we're born again of the incorruptible
[20:05] seed of God. Let's go there. First Peter
[20:07] 1:23, if you got your Bible,
[20:11] 1 Peter 1:23. So, if if if Brother
[20:15] Brandham's right, which he's quoting
[20:17] Jesus, right? Brother wasn't always
[20:19] right. But if he's right about Jesus's
[20:22] parable of the kingdom of God, about go
[20:24] Jesus restoring the church in three
[20:26] stages, then the final stage will be
[20:28] full wheat seed or full word of God.
[20:33] Right? In other words, there's less
[20:35] there's less man-made traditions as time
[20:37] goes on. And then by the end, it's back
[20:40] the gospel, the kingdom of God is back
[20:42] to the full restoration of the wheat
[20:44] seed. Hallelujah. So hope that makes
[20:47] sense. by God's grace. Okay, let's read
[20:49] that. Ready? One, two, three. Being born
[20:51] again, not of corruptible seed, but of
[20:54] the incorruptible by the word of God,
[20:57] which liveth and abideth forever.
[21:00] Amen. So, a Christian that's born again,
[21:03] it's like they have when they have the
[21:04] Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is like a
[21:06] seed, right? It's like just just like
[21:08] Jesus talked, right? It's got to be uh
[21:11] the the uh the sprout, the tassel, and
[21:13] then the seed, right? And so when you're
[21:16] born again, it's like you have the seed
[21:17] of God in you. You've got the word of
[21:19] God in you. Hallelujah.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; And but then if the church if the church
[21:23] has come got to come back to the seed
[21:25] condition, then she's got to have all
[21:27] the word restored back to her. She has
[21:30] to have the word restored. And we see
[21:33] that in numerous places in the New
[21:34] Testament as well. Remember Martin
[21:36] Luther was basically saying God has to
[21:38] restore what we started with at the
[21:40] beginning of the church age, right? We
[21:42] need reformed back to what they had. And
[21:45] that's what brother Ram is saying. That
[21:46] wheat seed came from a wheat seed. The
[21:49] seed's going to come back to the seed.
[21:52] That's what seeds do. They produce more
[21:54] seed. Hallelujah.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; So that's what Martin Luther was
[21:57] essentially saying. We've got to get
[21:58] back to that original condition. And the
[22:01] wheat plant is the symbol for it.
[22:03] Hallelujah. The wheat seed will produce
[22:05] more seed. Hallelujah. All right. So
[22:08] let's read a couple there. Um, uh, Acts
[22:10] chapter 3:20. Let's go to Acts 3:20.
[22:17] Acts chapter 3 20 and 21. Now, this
[22:19] verse is beautiful. Of course, they're
[22:21] all that way, but um, this one says
[22:25] that the heavens must keep Jesus until
[22:28] everything's restored.
[22:30] Right? In other words, Jesus will not
[22:33] leave heaven's throne
[22:35] until the church is restored back to its
[22:38] original condition. Right? So, this this
[22:41] prophecy has been laying here in the
[22:42] Bible for almost 2,000 years. But now,
[22:45] we can see why. Oh, yeah. Jesus said the
[22:47] kingdom of God has to come back to the
[22:49] seed condition. It's got to produce a
[22:51] seed. Martin Luther said it's got to be
[22:53] reformed. We got to bring it back to its
[22:55] original condition. Hallelujah.
[22:58] Now, verse 20. And he shall send Jesus
[23:01] Christ, who was preached, I'm sorry,
[23:03] which before was preached unto you. Now,
[23:04] here it is. Whom the heavens must
[23:07] receive until the times of restitution
[23:11] of all things, which God has spoken by
[23:14] the mouth of all his holy prophets since
[23:17] the world began. So, this is Jesus says,
[23:20] I'm sorry, uh this is uh Luke recording
[23:23] this in the book of Acts. Luke is saying
[23:26] since the beginning of time, the
[23:27] prophets is saying that the end's not
[23:30] going to come until everything's
[23:31] restored. Hallelujah. And that's what
[23:33] Martin Luther was saying. We got to be
[23:35] restored. John Weston was saying, "We
[23:37] got to be restored." Isuza Street was
[23:39] saying, "We got to be restored." Brother
[23:40] Brandon was saying, "We got to be what?"
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Restored. Praise God. Restored.
[23:45] Now, let's go to Matthew 17:11. Jesus
[23:47] says this again.
[23:49] Now, you got to read this real carefully
[23:51] because some people confuse
[23:53] uh the comingings of the spirit of
[23:57] Elijah. But if you're really careful,
[23:59] you'll see Matthew 17, we'll read uh 10
[24:03] and 11. Matthew 17:10. And his disciples
[24:06] asked him, saying, "Why then say the
[24:08] scribes that Elias must first come?" So,
[24:11] all the Jewish scribes are saying,
[24:12] "Elijah's got to come before the end
[24:14] time." And remember I told you I don't
[24:16] know if you remember this but even at
[24:18] the Passover that they celebrate in uh
[24:20] Israel I was I saw a video of a of an
[24:23] old Orthodox uh rabbi saying at the end
[24:26] of the Passover they always knock and
[24:28] Elijah comes back. See so there in other
[24:32] words the Jews they know Elijah's got to
[24:34] come back before the end time.
[24:36] Hallelujah.
[24:38] So they they're still asking him why do
[24:39] the scribes say Elijah's got to come
[24:41] back first? And Jesus answers in them,
[24:43] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[24:47] all things. So there's got to be a
[24:50] restoration.
[24:51] Hallelujah. Now, if you count the spirit
[24:53] of Elijah, it's used five times in the
[24:55] Bible. Elijah, Elisha, John the Baptist,
[24:59] we believe brother Brandham, and then
[25:01] it's going to be used in the tribulation
[25:03] period with Moses and Elijah coming
[25:05] back. So five times that spirit is on
[25:08] five men. Hallelujah. And so I believe
[25:11] this verse is speaking of brother
[25:13] Brandham, God's prophet, because that
[25:14] spear has to come back and restore all
[25:16] things just like Luther was trying to
[25:18] restore Wesley, William Seymour, William
[25:22] Brandham trying to restore us back to
[25:24] believe what's in the Bible. Praise God.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Think about that. We're not we're not
[25:28] taking church tradition. We're just
[25:29] trying to go back to the Bible.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Is the Bible enough, church?
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible's enough. Amen.
[25:36] Jesus said, "Thy word is truth."
[25:39] The Bible's enough. Hallelujah. We don't
[25:41] need any books added on to it. And shame
[25:43] on these people that want to add Brother
[25:44] Brandham's books onto the Bible.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; They are officially heretics. You cannot
[25:50] add one thing to this Bible. Hallelujah.
[25:53] Anybody that tries to say that, they're
[25:55] an absolute heretic because the Bible
[25:57] says you cannot add one word to the
[25:59] Bible or take one word away. Praise God.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:06] Okay. So Elijah has to come and restore
[26:08] all things. So in verse 11, Jesus said
[26:10] there's a future Elijah, right? So that
[26:12] was after Jesus. But then he says, John
[26:15] was a previous Elijah in verse 12. But I
[26:18] say unto you, so there's two. There's
[26:19] one that's future, one that's to come.
[26:21] But I say unto you that Elias has come
[26:23] already, and they knew him not, but have
[26:24] done unto him whatsoever they listed.
[26:26] Likewise shall also the son of man
[26:29] suffer of them. Okay, so we can see
[26:32] that. So can everybody see Jesus used
[26:34] the word what? Restore.
[26:36] and all things. So Elijah, the spirit of
[26:39] Elijah has to come to the church and
[26:41] restore all things. Just like that wheat
[26:44] plant, everything that was in that
[26:45] seed's got to come up through the wheat
[26:47] plant or grow up through the wheat plant
[26:48] and it's got to be restored all in that
[26:50] next seed. The whole life of it has to
[26:53] be restored and all the ne all the life
[26:55] will be in the seed, right? The shuck
[26:57] will die, rot away, the shuck will rot.
[27:00] Uh the the stalk will rot. All that will
[27:02] rot away. The life is in the seed. Can I
[27:04] say it like this? The life is in the
[27:06] word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. The life
[27:08] God's life is in this word. If we
[27:11] believe it, receive it, God's life now
[27:13] comes in us.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] Now, what um
[27:19] what struck me most when I first heard
[27:21] the message was the teaching on the
[27:23] serpent seed. That's what struck me the
[27:25] most because that's the first thing that
[27:26] I heard. That's one of the truths that
[27:29] had to be restored at the end time. Now,
[27:31] Brother Ram says knowing the serpent
[27:33] seed doesn't save you. It doesn't save
[27:36] you. The blood of Jesus Christ saves
[27:38] you.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; But serpent seed, brother Ram says it
[27:41] shines more light on the thing that
[27:44] we're all trying to see.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; What are we trying to see, church? The
[27:47] Bible.
[27:49] What are we trying? We're trying to
[27:50] understand the Bible the right way.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; So, the teaching on the serpent seed, it
[27:54] shines more light. In other words,
[27:56] without the teaching on the serpent
[27:57] seed, your Bible's dark and can't really
[27:59] understand it.
[28:01] Hallelujah. But with it, but with the
[28:04] teaching on the serpent seed, you can
[28:05] understand the beginning. Hallelujah.
[28:08] And I'll say like this, you can
[28:09] understand the end as well.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Because it this whole mess started with
[28:14] two different seeds in the Garden of
[28:15] Eden.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; And it's going to end with two different
[28:19] seeds at the end time.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; The children of God and the children of
[28:23] Satan. Now, at the beginning, it was a
[28:25] natural physical seed from a a serpent
[28:27] beast. But at the end time because you
[28:30] know Noah and all the intermaring they
[28:31] they intermarried with the physical
[28:33] serpent seed. Now everybody has this
[28:35] evil sin nature in them. And now God
[28:38] sending a spiritual seed that we must be
[28:40] born again from above. Hallelujah. In
[28:42] other words, thank God. Doesn't matter
[28:44] about your mom or dad or your grandma,
[28:46] your grandpa. Doesn't matter how bad
[28:47] they were. Doesn't anything like that.
[28:49] God's not God's not basing your
[28:51] salvation upon your physical seed or
[28:53] your genealogy. God's basing salvation
[28:56] on the spiritual seed, the spirit of
[28:58] God, the seed from heaven. That's what
[29:00] we need. We need the seed of God. We
[29:02] must be born again from above.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I love that. Amen.
[29:07] It's so beautiful.
[29:09] It's a beautiful picture. Hallelujah.
[29:11] Well, let's look at that. Let's go to
[29:12] just quickly. I got about uh oh, 11
[29:14] minutes. Boy, that clock, that busy
[29:15] body. Genesis 3:15.
[29:21] Let's just review this here briefly by
[29:22] God's grace.
[29:27] Most people don't know, but God is the
[29:28] one that originated the serpent seed. It
[29:31] wasn't brother Brandham. It wasn't me.
[29:33] It wasn't a man. It wasn't a woman. It
[29:35] was God. Right? God is talking here. God
[29:38] says, "I will put emnity or hatred
[29:40] between thee," that's the serpent, "and
[29:43] the woman, and between thy seed and her
[29:46] seed." So God, whatever fruit they ate
[29:49] of, it produced the serpent had a seed
[29:52] or offspring. Whatever fruit they ate
[29:53] of, now we know it wasn't physical fruit
[29:56] &gt;&gt; because whatever they ate of, it
[29:58] produced offspring. That word means
[29:59] offspring
[30:01] and her seed. Well, now the woman's got
[30:04] offspring. Huh? Eating an apple causes
[30:07] children to be born. No, we know better
[30:10] than that, don't we, church? But see, if
[30:12] people don't know that, then the then
[30:13] the Bible's dark. They think, "Oh, an
[30:15] apple caused all this." No, adultery
[30:17] caused all this.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; And who's the evil woman at the end?
[30:21] She's an adulterer. She's called in the
[30:23] book of Revelation at the end. Who is
[30:25] this? It's an adulterer. It's the mother
[30:27] harlot who rides upon the beast, the
[30:29] antichrist spirit. So adultery. See,
[30:31] it's adultery at the beginning. It's
[30:33] adultery at the end. Everybody see that?
[30:37] So God is the one whatever fruit they
[30:39] ate of it produced two offsprings
[30:41] already. You already have two sets of
[30:44] children in in three in 3:15. God says
[30:47] so. Now this is a prophecy of Jesus.
[30:49] Look, there's a semicolon. It shall
[30:51] bruise thy head. That's speaking of
[30:52] Jesus bruising the head of serp Satan's
[30:54] power. And thou shalt bruise his heel.
[30:57] Okay. So in Genesis 3, eating is
[31:01] symbolic for adultery. And that's found
[31:03] in uh Proverbs 30:20. Honey, you want to
[31:06] put that up there?
[31:09] And you of course you see it in the Song
[31:10] of Solomon as well. We see it in 2
[31:12] Corinthians 11. Paul talks about Eve
[31:15] losing her virginity, right? And that
[31:17] was uh and Paul said, "I don't want your
[31:19] mind to be deceived like Eve lost her
[31:21] virginity." That's what Paul says. So
[31:23] Paul compares uh the church getting
[31:26] deceived as Eve losing her virginity.
[31:29] Paul says that. Okay. Such is the way of
[31:31] adulterous woman. She eateth what? Eat
[31:36] like like Genesis chapter 3. Eve and she
[31:39] wipeth her mouth and say, "I have done
[31:41] no wickedness." That's exactly what
[31:42] happened to Eve, right? She was
[31:44] deceived. She was deceived in her
[31:46] transgression. She didn't know what she
[31:48] was doing, but Adam knew what he was
[31:49] doing. That's what the Bible said,
[31:50] Brother Chris.
[31:53] Yeah. Yeah. Second Corinthians 11. Yes.
[31:55] Yes, sir. Yes. Good.
[32:01] I was I was thinking, how can I build
[32:02] upon that uh masterpiece and just show a
[32:05] couple things that this this is what
[32:06] spoke to me when I heard the message?
[32:08] You know, Simon's like, you got to
[32:09] listen to this. And I'm like, okay,
[32:10] Simon. Okay. And then as I heard it, I'm
[32:13] like my eyes I felt like I just felt
[32:15] like my eyes were spiritually opened.
[32:17] And remember this doesn't save me, but
[32:19] it just shines more light on what we're
[32:21] trying to understand, the restoration of
[32:23] the Bible, right? And you can look you,
[32:26] Brother Rod, I'm sure you've heard it.
[32:27] Uh I know Lydia's read it. A lot of Jews
[32:30] still to this day believe the fruit was
[32:32] adultery. Like a lot of Orthodox Jews
[32:34] believe that. So that means like that's
[32:37] an original truth that was lost through
[32:39] people telling stories about apples. uh
[32:41] causing problems like apple caused a
[32:43] problem or pears or peach or whatever
[32:46] you want to call it, apricot. It wasn't
[32:48] a fruit. It was adultery because
[32:51] whatever they ate of it produced two
[32:53] seeds. Okay. Um what did I say? Second
[32:55] Corinthians 11:1. Now I just need a
[32:58] second to get there. It's not verse one.
[32:59] It might be verse two. Oh yeah, verse
[33:01] two. Okay.
[33:02] For I am jealous over you with godly
[33:04] jealousy. Paul told tells the
[33:06] Corinthians. For I have espoused you to
[33:07] one husband. So when when a preacher
[33:10] shares the gospel with you and you get
[33:11] saved, it's like he's engaged you to
[33:13] Jesus. Okay? So what's the picture?
[33:15] Corinthians are engaged to Jesus. Now
[33:17] look, he's going to change this now to
[33:20] Eve engaged to Adam. So it's a he's
[33:22] given a symbol or analogy that I may
[33:26] present you as a chasteed virgin to
[33:28] Christ. So if you read the previous
[33:30] chapters, Paul is rebuking them for all
[33:32] their false doctrines. You guys are
[33:33] letting false preachers in here. In
[33:36] other words, when you first got saved,
[33:37] it's like you were a chase virgin to
[33:39] Christ, but you've been deceived by
[33:42] false teachers. In other words, you're
[33:45] no longer pure. You've committed, and
[33:47] now this case, it would have been
[33:48] fornication, but it's almost the same
[33:50] act. Okay. Now, go to verse two. I'm
[33:52] sorry, verse three. But I fear lest by
[33:54] any means as the serpent begiled Eve
[34:00] through his subtility, so your mind
[34:02] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[34:04] that is in Christ. So when he talks
[34:06] about the Corinthians losing their
[34:08] spiritual virginity, he goes to Eve as
[34:11] the example.
[34:13] Right? And again, many Orthodox Jews
[34:15] have always believed this. Right?
[34:18] Now, I thought that might be a good
[34:20] review there uh by God's grace. And now
[34:22] go back to Genesis 3 and then I want to
[34:23] hit uh six minutes here. Boy, oh boy.
[34:28] I just want to Chris and I did Chris
[34:29] remember we did a Bible study on this a
[34:31] couple weeks ago.
[34:33] Servant seed. Yeah. You remember that? I
[34:35] when we talked those couple things
[34:37] struck me. So I just thought I'd share
[34:39] that.
[34:42] Okay. So God says there's already two
[34:44] offsprings in verse 15, right? So God
[34:47] says whenever they ate it produced two
[34:49] different offsprings or children
[34:52] right now verse 20 um
[34:56] and Adam called his wife Eve because she
[34:59] was the mother of all living. She's
[35:01] already a mother in chapter 3 and the
[35:04] church said whatever fruit she ate of
[35:07] Adam already calls her a mom. How'd you
[35:10] become a mom by eating an apple? You
[35:13] don't.
[35:14] You become a mom by having adultery.
[35:17] right? She's already a mom. Now, um also
[35:22] all the punishments
[35:25] uh fit the crime. In other words, like
[35:27] the Bible says, eye for eye, tooth for
[35:28] the tooth. So, go to verse 16. And unto
[35:31] the woman, he said, I will greatly
[35:33] multiply thy sorrow in thy conception.
[35:36] So, God's going to cause her God's going
[35:39] to kind of punish her in the conception.
[35:41] Why would God punish her in con
[35:43] conceiving children? because she already
[35:44] conceived with the wrong seed. Eye for
[35:47] an eye, tooth for a tooth. Right?
[35:50] Everybody see that? Why would she get
[35:52] punished in conceiving seed? Because she
[35:54] received the wrong seed.
[35:56] Okay? In sorrow, thou shalt bring forth
[35:58] children, and thy desire shall be to thy
[36:01] husband, and he shall rule over thee.
[36:03] Why does God got to get Eve to desire
[36:06] husband? Because she desired the serpent
[36:08] before. Remember that serpent wasn't the
[36:10] devil. The devil was inside the serpent.
[36:13] The devil's a spirit, not a man. That's
[36:16] a great misconception a lot of people
[36:17] have, you know, as I interact with them
[36:19] online and so forth. The devil just
[36:21] anointed that beast of a serpent. Okay.
[36:26] Okay. So there. So she's got to she has
[36:29] to have a desire for her husband because
[36:31] she gave her desire towards the beast,
[36:33] the serpent. Okay.
[36:36] All right. Now, that's pretty uh plain
[36:39] there by the grace of God.
[36:43] Now, there's uh there's nine proofs also
[36:45] of the serpent seed. I'm not going to
[36:47] get those tonight. But the last one, now
[36:48] the other thing that just this one makes
[36:50] all the difference in the world is the
[36:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Okay, Jesus
[36:55] said this. So, let's I'll end with that.
[36:56] I got a couple minutes. Acts 1 verse uh
[36:59] Acts 1 verse5. This is the one of the
[37:02] biggest differences in what we would
[37:04] call God's God's finishing the
[37:06] restoration process,
[37:08] right? Through the ministry of William
[37:10] Ram. That's what we believe because
[37:11] Luther had a good start. Wesley added to
[37:13] it. Isuza added it. Uh the gifts and now
[37:16] we're getting back to the full word of
[37:18] God where we understand the full word of
[37:19] God and also the power of God. Like
[37:21] we're talking about these healings and
[37:22] testimonies. We the power of God's
[37:24] moving in the church. Praise God. Did I
[37:26] tell you, brother Rod? Oh yeah. When
[37:27] Adam came, Adam came, he told his
[37:29] testimony. I think I told the church
[37:30] last week, right? He said, "When I was
[37:32] here, he said the anointing was on me as
[37:34] soon as I got in the city. The Holy
[37:35] Ghost was anointing him." And then I
[37:37] think I told you that, right? And then
[37:39] he said he left here and God took an
[37:41] addiction that he had for 28 years.
[37:44] 20 almost three decades, church, God is
[37:47] faithful. God is here. Isn't that
[37:49] awesome to know? Like this might be your
[37:51] night, brother, sister. This might be
[37:52] your night. Hallelujah. He just came and
[37:54] testified and was serving God. And God
[37:57] took an addiction after 28 years.
[38:00] Hallelujah. It makes me It makes me
[38:02] excited to see what could God do
[38:04] tonight. Hallelujah.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; If we've seen it before. Hallelujah. He
[38:07] can do it again by the grace of God.
[38:10] Acts 15. Okay. Now look, Jesus, this is
[38:13] after he's resurrected. And I just want
[38:15] to end with this because this is what
[38:16] also the serpent seed was huge. And then
[38:18] this was huge for me as well. Now this
[38:21] one's really important. This this one's
[38:22] not required for salvation, but it is
[38:24] required for the rapture. If people want
[38:26] to go in the rapture, they have to have
[38:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[38:29] soul. Because Jesus said in the parable,
[38:32] the 10 virgins, five were virgins, but
[38:35] they didn't have oil. their oil ran out
[38:38] and oil represents the Holy Spirit. So
[38:40] those five virgins that didn't have the
[38:42] oil, they didn't go out to the wedding
[38:44] and the wedding is the rapture according
[38:45] to Jesus, right? So if without the
[38:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost, they can't go
[38:50] in the rapture. But only in the church
[38:52] that has the oil, the baptism of the
[38:54] Holy Ghost, they'll go out to meet Jesus
[38:56] in the rapture. Now the thing is, we
[38:58] don't know when the rapture is. No man
[39:00] knows the day or the hour. Brother Ram
[39:01] said it could be tonight. He said it
[39:03] might be next week. I found a quote. He
[39:04] said it could be a hundred years from
[39:06] now. Now, this one kind of made me sad,
[39:07] but he said, "It could be 500 years from
[39:09] now.
[39:10] We all want it to be in our lifetime,
[39:12] right? And every Christian should live
[39:14] that way, like it's going to be in my
[39:16] lifetime, but if not, I'll serve Jesus
[39:18] as best as I can. I The Bible said,
[39:20] "Watch and pray for Jesus to come back."
[39:23] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here tonight,
[39:24] &gt;&gt; right? We could be out watching a
[39:26] college football game or you could out
[39:27] be uh you could out be shopping tonight
[39:29] or doing something like that. But you
[39:30] chose to come watch and pray because you
[39:32] want to be ready when Jesus returns. So
[39:34] do I. Hallelujah.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Running short on time, but here's
[39:38] the word. For John truly baptized with
[39:40] water, but ye shall be baptized with the
[39:42] what, church? Let's read that. The
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. Oh. So, see, there's a
[39:46] there's a water baptism. That's
[39:48] necessary. But Jesus said, "You got to
[39:50] have the soul baptized." Amen. What does
[39:52] the word baptize mean? Immerse,
[39:55] right? So, here's some water for the
[39:57] guest ministers. Sisters there bought
[39:59] it. Very nice, sisters. But if I was
[40:02] going to baptize a tissue, I had to get
[40:04] it all the way, this tissue all the way
[40:06] down the water. If I just dip it, it's
[40:07] not baptized.
[40:09] I got to get that tissue all the way so
[40:11] it's fully immersed. And that's what
[40:13] Jesus says has to happen in your soul.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; You got to get so much of God on the
[40:18] inside that you know, I'm filled. I've
[40:21] got a baptism. And how will you know?
[40:23] Jesus said, if you love me, you'll keep
[40:25] my commands.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; That's how you'll know. Praise God.
[40:28] You'll want to keep the commands of God
[40:30] because your soul has been immersed.
[40:33] Picture that, church. Your soul is like
[40:34] swimming. Your soul is just placed in
[40:36] there and it's it's just baptized with
[40:38] the Holy Ghost. Oh my, what a blessing.
[40:41] Before it wasn't. Before it wasn't a
[40:45] surrounded. It didn't have that
[40:46] anointing all around it. Before you
[40:48] lived a life of sin, you didn't care
[40:49] what anybody thought. You just did
[40:50] whatever you want. But now your soul's
[40:52] filled with the Holy Ghost. God is
[40:54] living inside of you. Hallelujah.
[40:57] Wow, what a what a privilege. What a
[40:59] blessing that we have that. Praise God.
[41:02] Sometimes I got to shake myself just to
[41:03] remember, wow, you've got that because
[41:05] we go through trials, right? We go
[41:07] through tests. Every every saint was
[41:09] must have their faith tested.
[41:11] Hallelujah.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said God chasens every
[41:15] son that he loves.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "As many as I love, I'll rebuke
[41:19] them and chasen them like Job."
[41:23] All right? And this is what made all the
[41:25] difference because my denominational
[41:27] friends, bless their hearts, I love
[41:28] them, but they were telling me, Brother
[41:29] Rod, if you said a prayer, you're
[41:31] already filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[41:32] I said, I said, I just can't accept
[41:34] that. I've seen a lot of people be
[41:36] baptized and live a life that I knew
[41:38] even even if I didn't have the Holy
[41:40] Ghost, I knew they didn't have it
[41:41] either, right? Like I told you, some of
[41:44] those guys uh there at the mega church,
[41:46] you know, they would they would go
[41:49] around after service and try to hug as
[41:51] many girls as they can to kind of bring
[41:52] up into them into their bosom like this.
[41:54] And then they would brag about it. I'm
[41:55] like, and I'm trying to serve God. I'm
[41:57] trying to read my Bible. I'm like,
[41:58] that's like a almost like adultery. Like
[42:00] you you want to commit adultery or
[42:02] fornication? Like that's not God. And
[42:04] then after church, they would watch, you
[42:06] know, like like uh these movies, you
[42:08] know, just killing and murder and tell
[42:11] me about I'm like I And when but when I
[42:13] got saved, I'm like, I just can't watch
[42:14] that anymore. It's that that's against
[42:16] my spirit. Amen. God gave me a spirit.
[42:18] I'm against that. Praise God.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; I was trying to think of that one. Oh,
[42:22] The Matrix. Yeah, they can watch The
[42:23] Matrix and people get shot up and do all
[42:24] kinds of stuff. I'm just like, I just
[42:26] can't do that anymore. That's just
[42:27] that's that's not with the nature of
[42:28] God.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; It's not. and they could go watch
[42:32] football for six hours after church. I
[42:34] just couldn't do that anymore. What a
[42:36] waste of time. I could be with my
[42:38] family. I could be reading my Bible or
[42:40] worshiping. Why would I give that much
[42:43] time to the world? My heart's full of
[42:45] the Holy Ghost. Praise God.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; My soul is filled with the Holy Ghost.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; So, let's uh let's finish with that one.
[42:53] So, I'll finish last verse. I'm already
[42:55] a little bit past my time. Colossians 1
[42:57] verse 26. Let's finish with this one.
[43:00] This is another one of those those uh uh
[43:03] Bible truths that need to be restored.
[43:05] We need that that wheat grain to come to
[43:08] full maturity. And that's what's
[43:09] happening. This message is going around
[43:11] the world, right? on the serpent seed,
[43:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[43:15] church ages, the water baptism in the
[43:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the truth
[43:19] on marriage and divorce, the anointed
[43:21] ones of the end time. Hallelujah. All
[43:22] these amazing revelations right from the
[43:25] Bible. Hallelujah. Predestination. Uh
[43:27] all these revelations, they're still
[43:29] going around the world. People are
[43:30] hearing them for the first time just
[43:32] like Martin Luther, right? His message
[43:35] went around the world. And then John
[43:36] Wesley's went around the world. And then
[43:38] Isuza Street went around the world.
[43:39] Thank God it did. It helped heal my mom.
[43:40] Praise God. But now the message of
[43:42] William Brandham is going around the
[43:44] world. Hallelujah. So people can hear it
[43:46] and I'm glad I heard it. Praise God. It
[43:48] has transformed my life. I said beyond
[43:51] that church experience that I had that
[43:52] they were trying to live like a Wesley a
[43:54] John Wesley life but then all this
[43:56] corruption was getting in there.
[44:00] Okay. Colossians 1:26. Okay. Now this is
[44:04] this is why God had to restore all the
[44:05] mysteries as well. The Bible says that
[44:07] at the end time the mystery of God will
[44:08] be finished in Revelation 10:7. So God
[44:10] has to finish the mystery. In other
[44:12] words, all that life's got to go into
[44:13] the seed. The seed's got to be mature.
[44:15] The church has to have all the truth of
[44:17] God's word. Even the mystery which has
[44:20] been hid from the ages and from
[44:21] generations, but is now made manifest to
[44:23] his saints. Next verse.
[44:26] To whom God would make known what is the
[44:28] riches of the glory of this mystery
[44:29] among the Gentiles, which is, let's say
[44:31] it together. Ready? Which is Christ in
[44:33] you, the hope of glory. That was the
[44:36] mystery. In the Old Testament, they had
[44:38] anointing, but they didn't have the soul
[44:40] baptized. They didn't have their soul
[44:42] just totally surrounded with the spirit
[44:44] of God. That's why David could slay
[44:46] Goliath, but then commit adultery with
[44:48] Basheba and have Uriah murdered because
[44:50] he didn't have the baptism of the Hol.
[44:51] His soul wasn't filled in inside.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what the Bible
[44:56] said. It was a mystery until Jesus said,
[44:58] "Go come up and be baptized with the
[45:00] Holy Ghost." Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; He was restoring this back. And that's
[45:04] what I saw in my experience. Churches
[45:06] lack that. They they they teach, okay,
[45:08] come to church, be a good person. But
[45:10] we're saying, yes, come to church, be a
[45:12] good person, but receive the baptism of
[45:14] the Holy Ghost because the baptism of
[45:15] the Holy Ghost is power to be a witness
[45:18] for Jesus Christ.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[45:21] come.
[45:23] And church, if we're not being the
[45:24] witness we ought to be, then we need to
[45:26] seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[45:30] That's what the Holy Ghost is. It's
[45:32] power to be a witness. Hallelujah.
[45:35] Thank God. Praise God. And what's a
[45:37] witness at uh at a court trial? What's
[45:39] the witness? Someone who was there when
[45:41] it happened.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to be. I want to
[45:44] be someone that I can say, "I was there
[45:46] when God came in and and filled me with
[45:47] the Holy Ghost. I was there, right? I'm
[45:50] a witness." And I know my wife was a
[45:51] witness, too. She seen the change in my
[45:53] life. There's a witness. God gives you a
[45:56] witness. I'm filled now. Now, the spirit
[45:59] of God surrounds my soul. I love Jesus
[46:02] with all my heart. I want to go deep in
[46:03] the word of God. Not church tradition. I
[46:05] appreciate some traditions, but I want
[46:07] to go full in the word of God, the seed
[46:09] of God.
[46:11] And then back to that verse, we're born
[46:13] again of the incorruptible seed of God.
[46:16] See, we got to get that seed inside of
[46:18] us. God is restoring the church back to
[46:20] that seed. In other words, that seeds,
[46:22] the spirit of God has to come into us
[46:24] and fill our souls. Oh, what a what a
[46:27] beautiful story. Thank you, Jesus. Let's
[46:28] bow our heads here.
[46:32] Heavenly Father, thank you for the
[46:33] masterpiece, Lord, that you spoke, Lord
[46:35] Jesus. You spoke it in Mark chapter 4.
[46:38] Brother Random just recognized that
[46:40] that's what you were doing through
[46:42] Martin Luther, John Wesley, and then in
[46:44] his ministry, dear God. Thank you for
[46:47] the masterpiece of the wheat plant, dear
[46:49] God. Lord, you're bringing the church
[46:52] back to what it was. And that's what we
[46:53] see as well, Lord. We see the signs, the
[46:55] wonders, the miracles, the healings.
[46:57] We're grateful for that, dear God. But
[46:59] Lord, we also want every other part of
[47:01] the scripture.
[47:04] Lord, these two areas just meant a lot
[47:06] to me. The serpent seed meant a lot to
[47:07] me and I got to Chris and I got to talk
[47:09] to about it, dear God. And then the
[47:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost where your
[47:14] soul can be totally immersed in the
[47:16] spirit of God. Hallelujah. And then
[47:18] you're a witness. You want to testify
[47:21] about Jesus. You want to testify about
[47:23] the truth of God. You were there when it
[47:26] happened. Oh God, thank you Lord God for
[47:28] your mercy and grace. Thank you for
[47:30] restoring. You said, "I'll restore all
[47:32] things at the end time. Jesus must
[47:35] remain in heaven until the restitution
[47:36] of all things." You said, "Lord, that's
[47:38] your promise, dear God."
[47:43] Lord, and even after preaching this, I
[47:44] know other people might have different
[47:46] needs. Maybe they've already been born
[47:48] again. Maybe they have a need in their
[47:49] body for physical healing. Maybe they
[47:52] have a need in their human spirit or
[47:53] mind. Maybe they're battling
[47:54] discouragement, confusion, depression,
[47:58] fear, anxiety.
[48:01] Maybe they're battling lust.
[48:04] Lord, we all must battle, Lord, the the
[48:06] evil spirits. We must have a testimony.
[48:08] We must have the armor of God on. We
[48:10] must wrestle with not against flesh and
[48:12] blood. We must wrestle against spiritual
[48:14] wickedness in high places. So, we need
[48:16] you tonight, Lord Jesus. We love you
[48:18] tonight, Lord God. Whatever the need of
[48:20] the people is, I just pray, Lord, it was
[48:22] met. And Lord, as we sing and Lord, if
[48:24] anyone needs prayer, we could pray with
[48:26] them and try to encourage them, Lord
[48:28] God. And that your spirit would move on
[48:30] their behalf, dear God. Grant it, Lord
[48:32] God. Thank you for the masterpiece, Lord
[48:35] God. This wheat plant, Lord Jesus.
[48:38] Hallelujah. Stalk, tassel, and grain.
[48:41] You restoring your word back to the
[48:44] beginning, Lord. Thank you for Martin
[48:45] Luther. Thank you for John Wesley, for
[48:47] William Seymour,
[48:50] and for brother Brandham, Lord God.
[48:54] We're grateful for your restoration,
[48:57] Lord God. A true reformation, we'd say,
[49:00] reformed back to the full truth of your
[49:03] Bible. Lord God, we thank you for
[49:05] tonight. Lord, I pray you just meet the
[49:06] needs of the saints. Lord, we try to
[49:08] have just a shorter service here
[49:09] tonight. Thank you again for Rod and my
[49:12] mother-in-law being here, Tammy. Lord
[49:14] God, we're so thankful for this
[49:15] opportunity here tonight, Lord Jesus.
[49:17] May every need be met, Lord. May we look
[49:19] to you for our needs to be met, Lord
[49:21] God. and find a Bible verse that gives
[49:23] us the hope, the encouragement, Lord,
[49:26] the strength,
[49:30] Lord, so we can receive what we have
[49:32] need of. And Lord, we don't want to
[49:34] forget. We just don't want to be
[49:35] receivers. We want to be givers of
[49:37] praise. We want to praise you, Lord God.
[49:42] We know you inhabit the praises of your
[49:44] people. So, let's Lord, we just want to
[49:46] praise you tonight, church. Let's praise
[49:48] the Lord tonight here.
[49:50] We thank you for this time in Jesus
[49:52] Christ's name.
