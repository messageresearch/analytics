[1:41] our Bibles here
[1:54] take a little thought I kind of want to
[1:59] kind of build on the dancing sermons I
[2:02] preached and uh go a little bit further
[2:04] here let's go to First Corinthians
[2:05] chapter 14 I want to go start there
[2:10] like to call this one uh
[2:15] um
[2:16] balancing Liberty and the fear of the
[2:19] Lord so I just kind of want to
[2:21] something that we work on constantly but
[2:23] you know bouncing
[2:25] having Liberty of the Holy Spirit and
[2:27] the fear of God
[2:31] so we're always striving to do first
[2:32] Corinthians chapter 14 and
[2:42] verse 33 First Corinthians 14 33.
[2:50] foreign
[2:52] of course we're aware we're in the
[2:53] presence of the Lord today Jesus said
[2:54] wherever two or three gathered there I
[2:56] am in the midst so we know the Lord
[2:57] Jesus is here praise God
[2:59] and we want to hear his voice today
[3:02] Hallelujah and we want to hear the word
[3:04] of God hallelujah
[3:06] nothing more important than hearing the
[3:08] word of God today
[3:09] First Corinthians 14 33. we'll just read
[3:12] this one here
[3:17] and then we'll have you be seated maybe
[3:19] another word of Prayer
[3:22] verse 33 let's read this together if we
[3:25] can one two three for God is not the
[3:28] author of confusion but of Peace as in
[3:33] all the churches of the Saints praise
[3:35] God let's have one more word of prayer
[3:37] here

[4:03] yield to you offered up prayers Lord God

[4:09] to the move of the Holy Spirit today
[4:10] Father God have your way Lord in the
[4:13] morning and the evening Lord God and
[4:14] Father we're just so delighted to be
[4:16] able to give this entire day to you
[4:17] thank you for the Lord's Day in the
[4:19] natural Lord God thank you for a day we
[4:21] can just set aside and we can escape
[4:23] Lord all the all the pressures of work
[4:25] Lord we could just come into your house
[4:27] and worship Lord God and enjoy the
[4:29] presence of the Lord what a blessing and
[4:32] so father use me use each and every
[4:33] person Lord God as a body of Believers
[4:36] and we ask the Lord you be glorified in
[4:38] Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said
[4:39] amen God bless you you're being seated
[4:41] praise God
[4:47] Hallelujah so I just want to start with
[4:49] this thought you know how God is not the
[4:51] author of confusion
[4:55] Hallelujah
[4:57] and I was actually looking for another
[4:59] verse yeah
[5:01] about how things should be done decently
[5:03] and in order yeah it's verse 40. there
[5:06] it is I want to go down there in the
[5:07] chapter and see if you have your bibles
[5:09] if you just go down to verse we read
[5:12] verse 33 but I'd like to read verse 40.
[5:14] this is of course the chapter on tongues
[5:16] you know I was listening to a few of my
[5:17] recordings this morning and
[5:20] when Lena's sisters were here sage and
[5:23] Jordan
[5:24] uh right before they left we did a bible
[5:26] study on this chapter of course we
[5:28] didn't read all the verses but we read a
[5:30] lot of them
[5:31] um
[5:33] but this is a beautiful chapter you know
[5:35] Church think about you know the day of
[5:36] Pentecost can you imagine you know just
[5:38] if we could just go back there a moment
[5:40] you know thousands of people gathered in
[5:42] Jerusalem thousands of people walk in
[5:44] the city streets at 9am in the morning
[5:46] and all of a sudden you hear these
[5:47] people screaming and shouting and
[5:48] praising the Lord
[5:50] and they come running out of the upper
[5:52] room and
[5:53] the Bible said they're declaring the
[5:55] wonderful works of God and
[5:57] and these people say they're drunk you
[5:59] know they're drunk
[6:01] and whatever it was brother Randolph
[6:03] said they jumped out of the windows now
[6:04] we don't know that they did but let's
[6:05] say they jumped out of the second floor
[6:06] windows then ran down the stairs and I
[6:09] don't think they jumped out of the
[6:10] windows and you know jumped all the way
[6:12] to the ground they probably would have
[6:13] broke a leg or something like that but
[6:15] in other words brother man said they had
[6:17] so much enthusiasm for Jesus they were
[6:19] so bold when the Holy Ghost fell on them
[6:21] praise God they didn't care who heard
[6:22] them praise the Lord they they just
[6:24] wanted to praise the Lord abandoned uh
[6:27] and I just want you to you know go back
[6:29] there when the church was born it was
[6:31] born in the day of Pentecost and
[6:32] everything was decent in order
[6:35] they were speaking in tongues the Bible
[6:36] said the spirit gave them utterance so
[6:38] they were speaking in Galilean but the
[6:41] people were hearing them in their own
[6:42] languages Hallelujah and it was all
[6:45] decent and in order and to the world it
[6:47] looked like they were drunk
[6:49] now a sinner now some of the I'm sorry
[6:52] some of them were Jews rather a lot of
[6:53] them were Jews visiting you know
[6:54] celebrating the Feast of Pentecost uh
[6:57] but these were staunch Jews and and they
[6:59] were no doubt more sober and more this
[7:01] is the worship day and this is the day
[7:02] of the two loaves and we're waving the
[7:04] two loaves and it was more solemn
[7:06] serious type of day but here are some
[7:08] Fanatics they'd say shouting and
[7:10] screaming and praising the Lord
[7:11] hallelujah rejoicing and declaring
[7:14] they're basically preaching on the
[7:15] streets right testifying on the streets
[7:16] praise God with a lot of emotion and
[7:19] that's the way the church was birthed
[7:21] praise God and uh and so you know Paul
[7:24] and this is 80 59. so I believe this is
[7:28] 29 years later Paul's still telling
[7:31] these holy ghost-filled Saints here now
[7:32] this is almost three decades later
[7:35] he's saying make sure you keep
[7:36] everything decent and in order praise
[7:38] God and of course if you read the
[7:39] chapter Paul says at the most two or
[7:42] three tongues and interpretations can go
[7:44] forth in a service
[7:45] now I've been in Services you know
[7:47] brother cam shirts where we had three
[7:48] that's the most I've ever seen
[7:50] now I told you though when I was growing
[7:52] up we had seven in one service or more
[7:55] because I prayed I prayed a prayer to
[7:56] the Lord I still remember this I said
[7:58] Lord I was a teenager I said Lord if you
[8:00] give seven tongues interpretations I'll
[8:02] go up and repent but I fail to do it
[8:04] because I was still ashamed so I broke
[8:06] my promise to God but God gave eight
[8:08] maybe nine maybe ten in that one service
[8:11] it was just a really highly anointed
[8:13] service you know kind of like Wednesday
[8:14] praise God except you know just
[8:16] different you know just a different It's
[8:17] A Channel Of God speaking the tongue and
[8:19] interpretation to the people it was of
[8:21] course of course all general you know it
[8:22] was all General
[8:23] uh but it was calling the people to
[8:25] serve God
[8:27] so that service was out of order when I
[8:29] was raised you know in the denomination
[8:31] but God showed me he was real even in
[8:34] that you know even even the fact they
[8:35] got out of order God was trying to prove
[8:38] his love to me bye
[8:41] um
[8:42] so you know we see we want to find this
[8:45] balance praise God and I believe we do
[8:46] it well but I I believe you know we've
[8:48] got to go towards the more of the
[8:49] Liberty side
[8:51] like Wednesday night
[8:52] you know we have to we have to have more
[8:54] of those you know in the past you've
[8:56] seen me dance around the church maybe a
[8:57] handful of times you know or something
[8:58] like that and that's okay you know like
[9:01] we said dancing in the spirit is not the
[9:03] evidence of the Holy Ghost it's evidence
[9:05] you got victory
[9:07] unless you're like brothers unless
[9:09] you're trying to put it on or something
[9:10] like that but we're not trying to put it
[9:11] on right we're we just want to be
[9:13] thankful for what God has done
[9:15] hallelujah
[9:16] um
[9:17] but you know we're
[9:19] like we kind of talked about with you
[9:21] know America is different from Ghana
[9:23] America is different from Africa you
[9:26] know uh just a different Nation you know
[9:28] different a culture
[9:30] and so you know we want to have a
[9:32] balance you know in our lives in America
[9:35] As Americans want to have a balance of
[9:36] having more Liberty because America is
[9:38] not so much of a we'd say a free place
[9:41] to have you know dancing and freedom for
[9:43] the lord it's just like they say in
[9:45] Canada too you know it's just not really
[9:46] that way you don't see a lot of people
[9:47] dancing in the North America
[9:51] I was out in South America honestly I
[9:53] honestly didn't see much dance in there
[9:54] either in South America when I've only
[9:56] been there four times I didn't see a lot
[9:58] of dancing there
[10:00] um
[10:01] but you know we wanna how many want to
[10:03] grow in the grace and knowledge of the
[10:04] Lord
[10:05] so we want to grow as Christians and
[10:06] that's definitely one area we can grow
[10:08] in is having more Liberty I'll say I
[10:10] just more Victory praise God
[10:13] or just maybe the freedom and liberty to
[10:15] express the victory that we enjoy
[10:17] Hallelujah
[10:19] and you know I believe personally too we
[10:21] can we can grow in the in the in the
[10:24] fear of the Lord as well
[10:26] definitely so you can switch over here I
[10:28] do have a few slides I like to show I
[10:30] didn't get all as many done as you know
[10:31] because of the coldness and things like
[10:33] that I didn't get as much time studying
[10:34] as I maybe I wanted to but God knows you
[10:36] know and he always works things out for
[10:38] his glory praise God he always works it
[10:40] out so I want to look at balancing
[10:41] Liberty and the fear Lord both heirs I
[10:43] feel like we can grow in I feel like
[10:45] every area we can grow it
[10:47] yeah I was telling you a few weeks ago
[10:49] like you know
[10:50] God is restoring the church back to the
[10:53] Pentecost of Acts 2.
[10:55] and we're we're on the road praise God
[10:58] we are on the road you know I would say
[11:00] our strengths you know uh
[11:02] as I was sharing with you there you know
[11:04] are with love you know a lot of people
[11:06] come to our church and they feel loved
[11:08] and then a lot of people come to our
[11:09] church and they say what a wonderful
[11:11] teaching this is you know they feel the
[11:12] teaching uh so those are two of our
[11:15] strengths you know we'd say we're we're
[11:17] really we're getting more and close to
[11:19] Pentecost all the time praise God
[11:21] but these are two areas where maybe they
[11:22] wouldn't be our biggest strengths but we
[11:24] want to see them grow Hallelujah we want
[11:27] to have more Liberty in the Holy Spirit
[11:28] and we also want to have more fear of
[11:30] the Lord because the Bible says when
[11:32] ananias and Sapphira died before the
[11:35] Lord the Bible said the fear of the Lord
[11:36] increase on the church
[11:39] in other words there's gonna but yet
[11:40] just months before that they were
[11:42] dancing and shouting in the streets you
[11:44] know
[11:45] so we've got to have a balance praise
[11:47] God
[11:48] in other words we got to recognize
[11:49] seasons of rejoicing but seasons of real
[11:52] sincerity praise God
[11:55] and yes we're sincere when we're
[11:56] rejoicing but there's just there are
[11:58] times of just kind of toning it down and
[12:00] real serious and humble before the Lord
[12:02] praise God
[12:03] and of course Church you know in those
[12:05] times you know uh the prayers will be
[12:07] different
[12:08] you know the prayers if it's in the fear
[12:10] of the Lord you know imagine what they
[12:12] were praying after anania since the fire
[12:14] died imagine what they were praying oh
[12:15] God give us sincere Hearts Let the
[12:17] church be pure amen bring us back to
[12:19] Purity praise God keep all the lies out
[12:21] of the church amen think of the prayers
[12:23] you know God keep us strong keep us in
[12:25] the faith you know uh
[12:27] but then you know think of the prayers
[12:29] we pray after we have rejoicing services
[12:30] oh God give us Soul saved amen
[12:33] hallelujah oh God just uh just pour out
[12:36] your blessings God and just do great
[12:38] things do signs miracles of Wonders you
[12:39] know we we feel so much Liberty to pray
[12:42] Hallelujah
[12:43] I know that's how I was praying at least
[12:44] you know this week by God's grace
[12:47] so you know we want to find this balance
[12:49] you know uh and that's kind of the
[12:50] topics we're looking at here uh by God's
[12:53] grace now a couple of these I didn't get
[12:55] to look up so uh go to First Peter
[12:58] chapter two if I'm not mistaken now
[13:00] these are for memory I didn't get a
[13:01] chance to kind of
[13:03] look at these actual verses up
[13:10] the Bible calls the house of the Lord
[13:12] the house of judgment
[13:19] yes
[13:21] verse 16. first Peter 4 16 please first
[13:24] Peter 4 16.
[13:26] so not only now we've been looking at
[13:28] dancing not only is this a House of Joy
[13:31] it's a house of judgment as well
[13:34] now to me I say like this if God judges
[13:37] me and forgives me then that makes me
[13:39] joyful right another like brother I said
[13:42] I want to be judged now praise God
[13:44] Hallelujah I want God to convince me of
[13:47] my sin I confess my sin he judges my sin
[13:50] now and so that I can rejoicing God
[13:52] again hallelujah amen so it depends how
[13:56] you look at the house of judgment
[13:58] God is in other words he's cleaning out
[14:00] our lives he's he's judging Our Lives
[14:02] now cleaning them out so then we're pure
[14:04] right but it judges The Sinner who
[14:07] leaves
[14:09] or the person that would walk away the
[14:11] make-believer who would walk away or the
[14:12] Judas that would walk away from the
[14:13] message or walk away from Christ and
[14:16] betray Christ the word
[14:18] not all people that leave the message
[14:19] are judases I hope you understand that
[14:21] not all people that they just they never
[14:23] had a revelation of it
[14:25] you know when I've talked to some people
[14:27] like that you know the word they use all
[14:28] the time is learn
[14:30] oh we learned about water baptism or we
[14:32] learned about modesty or we learned
[14:35] church it's more than learning it's a
[14:36] revelation
[14:39] you learn the ABCs right
[14:42] but you don't really get a revelation of
[14:44] the ABCs right right Church I mean but
[14:48] when you got a revelation of God's word
[14:49] there's no demon in hell that can talk
[14:52] you out of it praise God because Jesus
[14:54] said so praise God he said the Gates of
[14:57] Hell will not Prevail against Revelation
[14:59] amen
[15:00] someone can't leave the water back to
[15:02] the name of Lord Jesus Christ and say
[15:04] they had Revelation they never had it
[15:06] they just had they just had knowledge of
[15:08] it or learning of it
[15:10] but they didn't have a revelation
[15:11] because hell can't shake you from God's
[15:14] word amen the elect cannot be deceived
[15:17] amen
[15:18] Glory Now read this and read that verse
[15:20] for brother Chris in Matthew 16 but
[15:22] first Peter 4 16 yet if any man suffer
[15:25] as a Christian let him not be ashamed
[15:27] but let him glorify God on his behalfs
[15:29] anytime you suffer for being a Christian
[15:31] that's when you want to glorify God
[15:35] if you suffer for your own faults well
[15:37] it's hard to glorify God in that but yes
[15:40] you should still praise God in that
[15:42] but we want to we want to live such a
[15:44] life where we don't suffer for wrong so
[15:46] much where God helps us not to do so
[15:49] many wrongs
[15:50] God is teaching us to do what's right
[15:52] praise God Amen now here in verse 17 for
[15:55] the time has come that judgment must
[15:57] begin at the house of God
[16:00] and if it first begin at us what shall
[16:03] the end be of them that obey not the
[16:06] gospel
[16:07] okay
[16:09] so judgment always begins at the house
[16:11] of the Lord God bless you brother Ray
[16:12] good to see you sir Hallelujah
[16:16] and so the Bible gives us a clue here
[16:18] people that come to church they're the
[16:20] ones that are closest to being saved
[16:23] right so Chris you come to the right
[16:25] place if you want to be saved brother
[16:26] this is the right place amen
[16:27] people are rarely going to be saved
[16:29] outside of a church
[16:31] because the Bible calls it the house of
[16:33] judgment
[16:34] this is where the judgment is given out
[16:36] this is right this is wrong and God you
[16:38] either accept God's word or you turn
[16:40] down God's word but one thing's for sure
[16:42] God's judgments will stand amen
[16:46] and the Bible says judge yourselves lest
[16:48] ye be not judge amen
[16:50] if you judge yourself now so you don't
[16:51] go to the white Throne judgment and God
[16:53] doesn't have to judge your life there
[16:54] it's already been judged amen
[16:58] I let Jesus judge my life every service
[17:00] praise God
[17:02] and Lead Me In Paths of righteousness
[17:04] for his name's sake
[17:07] Verse 18 and if the righteous scarcely
[17:09] be saved where shall the ungodly and The
[17:12] Sinner appear wherefore let them that
[17:14] suffer according to the will of God
[17:15] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[17:18] in well-doing as unto a faithful crater
[17:21] so when you're suffering for doing
[17:22] what's right or when your family
[17:24] persecutes you you just have to suffer
[17:26] through that that's why the Bible said
[17:28] God gives you long suffering praise God
[17:31] you haven't done nothing wrong but yet
[17:33] you're suffering you're being mistreated
[17:35] that's why God gives you long suffering
[17:37] it's the Holy Spirit praise God it's
[17:39] patience amen God gives you anointings
[17:42] who can get through it and you just say
[17:43] I don't know why I'm going through this
[17:45] but I'm committing it in God's hands
[17:47] it's on God's control I know God loves
[17:49] me so I'm going to trust God and I'm
[17:51] going to get through this because I'm
[17:52] committing it to God Amen
[17:54] that's all you can do
[17:57] God doesn't always tell us why we suffer
[17:59] but we just got to trust God and commit
[18:02] it to him and know that if he saved us
[18:03] then there's a purpose for us being
[18:05] saved and if we're still here there's a
[18:07] purpose of us still being here we can
[18:08] still win souls we can still be filled
[18:10] with the Holy Ghost we can still pray
[18:12] for the sick we can still do God's will
[18:13] amen
[18:16] we just don't want to complain
[18:18] we're all going to do it but we just
[18:20] want to keep from it by God's grace
[18:22] and let's say Lord Jesus help me to
[18:24] suffer in silence
[18:27] that's what we used to do in football we
[18:28] used to do all kinds of push-ups and
[18:30] exercises and the coaches like suffer in
[18:32] silence
[18:33] I don't want to hear the oh
[18:36] [Music]
[18:39] I could hear that I can kind of hear
[18:41] their voices right now all those
[18:43] practices
[18:44] that's so heavy he'd say suffer in
[18:46] silence and that's what we ought to do
[18:48] sometimes but then we ought to praise
[18:50] the Lord in suffering too amen like job
[18:53] go to the house of God and bless me in
[18:55] the name of the Lord God gives and God
[18:57] takes away blessed be the name of the
[18:59] Lord praise God
[19:02] so see that we want to find that balance
[19:03] now this scripture is more like the fear
[19:05] of the Lord right judgment begins the
[19:07] house of God
[19:08] then we also know there's joy in the
[19:10] house of the Lord praise God hallelujah
[19:13] there's a lot of that in David's life
[19:14] amen as we looked at on Wednesday night
[19:17] now let's go to Matthew 16. I want to
[19:19] show this for brother uh Chris here by
[19:20] God's grace
[19:21] I mentioned it numerous times twice now
[19:23] in this service here
[19:25] Matthew 16.
[19:27] what a chapter this is my
[19:30] Jesus talks about revelation
[19:33] he heals uh or he Rooks the blind
[19:35] Pharisees he gives the symbol of Leaven
[19:39] and he asked Peter his confession about
[19:41] the Messiah
[19:42] and then after all this then he stands
[19:44] there looks at Peter and says Satan get
[19:45] behind me the man together give the keys
[19:48] to the kingdom too got Anointed with the
[19:50] wrong spirit
[19:51] right of course he wasn't born again
[19:54] but we all know but we even know after
[19:56] he got born again he got the wrong
[19:57] Spirit one time right wouldn't eat with
[19:59] Gentiles
[20:01] so we all need God's grace amen we're
[20:03] all going to be tested we're all going
[20:04] to be tried but God will bring us
[20:05] through we're going to commit Our Lives
[20:06] into his hands
[20:08] Matthew 16.
[20:14] so brother uh Christopher 17 and Jesus
[20:17] answers unto him blessed art thou Simon
[20:19] bar Jonah that means son of Jonah for
[20:21] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto
[20:23] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[20:26] so earlier a few verses above Jesus
[20:29] asked Peter who do men say that I am and
[20:32] Peter said Thou Art the Christ you're
[20:34] the Messiah
[20:35] you're the anointed one right you're
[20:37] you're the savior of the Jews right
[20:39] right
[20:40] and Jesus said blessed are your eyes he
[20:43] said because the father has revealed
[20:45] this unto you now look at verse 18. and
[20:47] I say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[20:50] and Upon This Rock of Revelation
[20:53] he said I will build my church and the
[20:55] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[20:58] it
[20:59] so Satan cannot stop amen when the
[21:02] father wants to give his child a
[21:03] revelation Satan cannot stop it amen
[21:06] Glory
[21:08] Hallelujah
[21:09] so God wanted to reveal to Chris that
[21:12] Jesus was the Messiah
[21:13] and Satan couldn't stop it hallelujah
[21:16] hallelujah and now brother you you got
[21:19] to take that as a a confirmation no
[21:21] matter what Trials come hell cannot
[21:23] Prevail against me I will always Prevail
[21:25] against the enemy because God set it up
[21:28] that way amen God in other words God
[21:30] gave you a power God Gave You weapons
[21:32] God Gave You tools God gave you a spirit
[21:34] that's more powerful than Satan and hell
[21:37] and darkness amen
[21:39] Amen brother it's helped me all these 22
[21:41] years I've been serving the lord praise
[21:43] God
[21:44] God's word is true amen
[21:46] Gates of Hell will not Prevail against
[21:48] the revelation of the father hallelujah
[21:50] or you just say General Christianity
[21:52] Hallelujah
[21:56] amen
[21:57] now I want to look up that scripture
[21:59] let's go to I think it's first Timothy
[22:01] thou knowest ought to how to behave
[22:03] thyself like I said these are the couple
[22:04] I didn't get a chance to look up and get
[22:06] the actual reference on them
[22:12] I'm gonna find it here first Timothy
[22:15] yeah first Timothy 3.
[22:18] 15.
[22:20] First Timothy 3 15. I'm just taking my
[22:22] time here I may preach an hour and a
[22:23] half we'll kind of see how it goes by
[22:24] God's grace
[22:27] but like we saw a couple weeks ago it's
[22:28] not going to be four and a half hours
[22:29] like brother Brandon preached
[22:31] Hallelujah
[22:33] unless I'm gonna make a tape or
[22:34] something like that
[22:36] uh First Timothy 3 15.
[22:41] so remember in this chapter Paul lays
[22:43] out here's how here's how you find a
[22:46] pastor he has to do he has to meet all
[22:47] these requirements like the job
[22:48] descriptions like a resume
[22:50] this is what a pastor has to do and then
[22:52] he says here's what a deacon has to be
[22:53] right
[22:56] and then in verse 13 for uh now that's
[22:59] still on deacons let's go down to verse
[23:01] 14. these things right unto thee hoping
[23:03] to come unto thee shortly but if I tarry
[23:05] along that thou mayest know how thou
[23:08] ought us to behave thyself
[23:10] In The House of the house of God which
[23:13] is which is the Church of the Living God
[23:15] the pillar and ground of the truth
[23:20] so Paul tells them here's how a pastor
[23:24] needs to act here's how deacons need to
[23:26] act and this is the conduct of the
[23:28] church
[23:30] praise God apost a pastor is supposed to
[23:32] be hospitable right welcoming you into
[23:35] my home well I do that now
[23:37] hallelujah it's a lot easier to do it
[23:38] now because we got the construction see
[23:41] God makes a way you know God he always
[23:43] makes a way praise God
[23:44] Pastor has to be apt to teach able to
[23:46] teach you right
[23:49] a Deacon's got to be a grave and sober
[23:51] praise God
[23:53] and have the the understanding of God
[23:55] hallelujah he's got to be married
[23:56] pastors got to be married with Children
[23:58] you know all these things
[24:00] and so if you keep this conduct Paul
[24:03] says this is how you'll learn how to
[24:05] behave in the house of the Lord the
[24:07] Bible said follow the faith of the
[24:08] leaders in the church so when I come in
[24:10] the message I follow brother Brooks and
[24:12] brother Samuel and brother Craig the
[24:14] elders in the church and I follow them
[24:15] and I I follow their example they did
[24:18] this and and I didn't know why they did
[24:19] it sometimes but eventually I found it
[24:21] in the Bible oh now I know why they do
[24:23] this oh okay that's the word of God now
[24:25] I understand
[24:26] praise God
[24:27] and so uh
[24:29] I want you to see this that that Paul
[24:31] told them you'll learn how to behave by
[24:34] following the example of the preachers
[24:36] right and the deacons now in our church
[24:38] I'm the pastor and I'm the Deacon so I
[24:40] don't do a whole lot of Deacon work you
[24:42] know other than uh I think the best way
[24:43] I can do it is you know when I'm not
[24:45] preaching I can go around I can help the
[24:46] kids I can open the doors I can I can
[24:49] whisper I can when I'm not preaching I
[24:50] can help people find a chair I've done
[24:51] that before
[24:53] um
[24:54] so uh that's you know kind of just the
[24:57] the kind of state we're in right now
[24:58] praise God so we think we're rejoice in
[25:00] that but we want to have this Liberty of
[25:02] the Holy Spirit praise God now we looked
[25:04] at this on Wednesday where the spirit of
[25:06] the Lord is there's liberty
[25:08] and then the Bible said if if we're in
[25:10] the spirit of the lord we will behold
[25:12] the glory of God and the glory of God
[25:14] will change us into the image of the
[25:16] word of God
[25:17] in other words the more we look in the
[25:19] Bible the more we'll live like the Bible
[25:20] and I found that to be true praise God
[25:23] the more I preach the message the more I
[25:25] see myself like the bible message praise
[25:28] God my life looks just like the bible
[25:29] message Hallelujah
[25:31] like Paul was a tent maker and yet he
[25:33] was teaching the Gentiles well I see I
[25:34] can go and work a job and I can still
[25:36] teach the people hallelujah I just see
[25:38] it praise God I see it you know
[25:40] everybody's got their certain calling in
[25:41] life you know
[25:42] and we see us growing in Grace and
[25:45] knowledge of the Lord I don't see us
[25:46] getting less like the Bible I see it's
[25:48] getting more like the Bible praise God
[25:51] amen
[25:53] so like my brother amen need a house to
[25:54] live come stay at my house when Austin
[25:56] needs a place to stay come stay at my
[25:58] house praise God when Matt hey I don't
[26:00] know if somebody remember Matt hey I let
[26:01] him come live at my house for a little
[26:02] while
[26:03] praise God that's how we should be we
[26:05] should be a family praise God
[26:07] uh yeah amen who I let sister Lina come
[26:09] and stay right see that's that's
[26:11] godliness praise God that's that's the
[26:12] right thing to do praise God we're a
[26:14] family I told brother Chris I said
[26:15] brother if you get persecution you can
[26:17] come stay with me for a while
[26:19] right because that's what we ought to do
[26:21] we're supposed to rescue our our
[26:23] Christian family from from uh from
[26:26] destruction right yeah
[26:27] yeah supposed to help them out praise
[26:28] God
[26:30] so we should see our lives being more
[26:32] conformed to the book of Acts all the
[26:34] time amen glory that's right amen
[26:36] because that's the message of the hours
[26:38] restoring the book of Acts Church praise
[26:41] God that's the message Hallelujah
[26:43] restoring the book of Acts
[26:44] now remember Liberty though was uh
[26:47] living as we ought to not as we please
[26:51] in other words when you're under Liberty
[26:53] you're free to do what God wants you to
[26:55] do
[26:56] and you're free to not be a slave to sin
[26:59] praise God you're free from your sin
[27:02] addictions amen that's what it is
[27:03] hallelujah that's that's being free in
[27:05] Christ I'm free to obey him I'm not
[27:08] bound by chains of addiction I'm not
[27:10] bound by bad habits I'm free from that
[27:12] now I'm in the spirit of Liberty because
[27:15] I'm free from sin praise God hallelujah
[27:17] thank God
[27:20] I have the Liberty to Omit things that
[27:23] have no relationship to the Bible
[27:27] that's my Liberty Hallelujah that's your
[27:29] Liberty praise God
[27:31] so in other words like I was talking
[27:32] with my brother Paul I said we have the
[27:34] power of no
[27:36] we don't have to do everything people
[27:37] ask us to do
[27:38] if it goes against the word of God just
[27:40] say no
[27:41] sorry I don't believe that praise God
[27:45] right because I'm I'm under Liberty I
[27:47] have the freedom to Omit that I don't
[27:49] have to go to that certain restaurant I
[27:50] have to go to that certain bar I
[27:52] certainly don't have to go to any sinful
[27:54] place there I have the Liberty say no
[27:56] that doesn't build up my faith that
[27:58] might be a temptation
[28:00] right we ask our Liberty to do what we
[28:03] ought to do instead of what we pleased
[28:06] to do like the flesh we're pleased to do
[28:09] now we looked at this again in the
[28:10] Liberty Roberto did you ever get that
[28:12] much Liberty to dance around the church
[28:13] praise God
[28:15] I know Austin got it praise God I know
[28:18] Chris got it one time amen do you ever
[28:20] get that haven God that praise God all
[28:22] those little girls got it Hallelujah got
[28:25] the Liberty the Holy Spirit praise God
[28:26] did you ever get that much Liberty
[28:28] praise God I think that's a great
[28:29] question amen hallelujah thank God
[28:34] and I like what I want to just want to
[28:35] read this you know what brother man said
[28:37] church when you got the holy ghost or
[28:39] you love God you ought to be exuberant
[28:40] about the gospel
[28:43] you ought to just be thankful Hallelujah
[28:46] God I could come to church and serve the
[28:48] Lord praise God
[28:49] see just as the world
[28:52] see the Christian ought to be Joseph
[28:53] Zuber and full of his pleasure in the
[28:56] Lord as the world is when it Savers and
[28:58] delights and its pleasures
[29:00] like last night I was getting gas at 10
[29:02] pm because I had to come here to the
[29:03] church and do some work you know with
[29:05] the heat and everything but I was
[29:07] getting gas I looked over and I see it

[29:21] connected to the back of it I think
[29:25] and it's got Browns painted all over I
[29:28] thought well that is a whole Unholy
[29:29] roller right there
[29:32] but at least they're a fanatic for
[29:33] that's their pleasure
[29:35] they're all bundled up at night and

[29:38] travel up there and they're going to
[29:39] sleep at the stadium

[30:53] and his love and I do not satisfy the
[30:55] flesh

[31:00] the world they will satisfy the flesh

[32:54] the blessings of the Holy Spirit
[32:56] Hallelujah or church like on Wednesday
[32:59] your worship takes over a stooped over
[33:01] individual and makes them prior makes
[33:04] them makes them thankful and makes them
[33:06] hopeful for the future
[33:08] the energy of the Holy Spirit or the
[33:10] love of God in the building take
[33:12] somebody who's cranky all the time and
[33:14] puts a smile on their face
[33:16] that's right that's just like the
[33:18] sunlight when the sunlight hits a flower
[33:20] when it's all drooped over what does it
[33:22] do it curls up it stands straight up
[33:24] that's what God is doing in his Vineyard

[33:34] manifest the glory of God Amen
[33:38] Hallelujah
[33:41] I want to get to this eventually but I
[33:43] just want to read this over when brother
[33:44] Rams rededicating the Tabernacle he says
[33:47] of course somebody works from the Lord
[33:48] that's expected that's what it should be
[33:50] that's what you're here for is to
[33:51] Worship the Lord
[33:53] and if you and just if you feel like
[33:56] praising God or shouting just go right
[33:58] on
[34:00] Hallelujah
[34:02] you feel like shouting just go right on
[34:05] if you like screaming go right on
[34:08] if you like dancing go right on
[34:10] praise God because that's what you're
[34:12] here for
[34:14] you're not here to get beaten and
[34:16] bullied and you know that's not why
[34:19] you're here the holy spirit's here yes
[34:21] to correct you but then to give you hope
[34:23] for a future praise God
[34:25] to give you an expected End Amen
[34:28] Hallelujah
[34:29] because the Bible said God has so many
[34:31] thoughts toward you praise God
[34:36] you see then go right on because that's
[34:38] what you're here for is to Worship the
[34:40] Lord in your own way of worshiping see
[34:42] your your way doesn't have to be like
[34:44] mine you don't have to dance
[34:46] but I tell you sure we'll give you some
[34:47] victory praise God
[34:49] you're really missing out on some
[34:51] victory Hallelujah
[34:56] yes amen that's right
[35:00] you got to find your way to worship I
[35:03] tell you don't worship by being
[35:04] depressed that's not how we worship
[35:07] Nobody worships by being depressed
[35:11] Nobody worships by complaining
[35:14] hello Church
[35:16] Nobody worships by falling asleep
[35:21] I feel it now brother
[35:24] [Laughter]
[35:26] I feel it now right
[35:28] that's not how you worship
[35:30] you won't find that in the Bible on the
[35:31] day of Pentecost they all got one Accord
[35:33] and took a nap
[35:35] that's not what the Bible says
[35:37] the Bible said they declared oh they
[35:39] declared the wonderful works of God is
[35:42] in he wonderful wonderful wonderful
[35:46] isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful he died
[35:51] for me he rose for me he saved my soul
[35:53] he Sanctified me fill me with the Holy
[35:55] Ghost isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful oh
[36:00] Nobody worships by sleeping
[36:05] Hallelujah
[36:07] now are you going to battle to sleep
[36:09] yeah you're going to battle but God made
[36:10] you to fight the good fight of Faith
[36:12] Hallelujah
[36:14] got to overcome that
[36:16] brother man said there's nobody worship
[36:17] so I pass the notes now he's talking to
[36:19] teenagers that would pass notes in his
[36:20] Services because that's in that's in the
[36:22] context of the quote
[36:24] he said when you're passing notes and
[36:26] distracting people from worshiping he
[36:28] says you're helping get somebody away
[36:30] from the worship of the Lord
[36:33] so you see we got to come to church say
[36:35] I'm going to worship God the way God
[36:37] made me to worship
[36:39] like I could try as hard as I want to
[36:41] get on the guitar and worship like
[36:42] brother amen it ain't going to happen
[36:45] I mean maybe I could learn
[36:47] Jesus loves me this I know maybe
[36:50] they take a couple years though
[36:52] but like he has a way to worship Church
[36:54] you have a way to worship too
[36:57] and we want to do everything we can to
[36:59] help other people worship God
[37:03] but don't come by worshiping is not
[37:05] criticizing people
[37:07] it's not being mad at amen because he
[37:09] didn't sing your song or mad at brother
[37:10] Jessica's he didn't preach what you
[37:12] wanted to hear preached that's that's
[37:13] not how you Worship the Lord that's not
[37:15] helping anybody worship
[37:17] right I'm not saying we do that I'm just
[37:18] giving examples you know let's give an
[37:20] example most people I look out and
[37:21] they're smiling at me most of the time
[37:22] you know I'm smiling at you most the
[37:24] time you know where's the family you
[37:27] know we go through ups and downs highs
[37:28] and lows mountains and valleys praise
[37:30] God but we're a family by God's grace
[37:32] and the blood makes us a family praise
[37:33] God forgives all of our trespasses
[37:36] praise God
[37:39] see
[37:40] and remember brother man dance in the
[37:41] sanctuary now I want to just remind you
[37:43] that he danced in his own sanctuary
[37:46] after calling it a disgrace
[37:49] so we also got to be open to this if my
[37:51] mind is wrong about something then Lord
[37:53] correct my thinking
[37:55] right correct me if I'm wrong
[37:59] help me not to sit in the seat of the
[38:01] scornful
[38:03] now I just wanted this real real briefly
[38:05] remember I preached two sermons on the
[38:06] fear of the Lord so what does the fear
[38:07] lord it's an anointing of the Holy
[38:09] Spirit
[38:10] it's your moral reverence in other words
[38:12] you honor God it's not cutting up or
[38:14] silliness or anything like that
[38:16] now the diff now it's kind of different
[38:18] right it's kind of close like silliness
[38:20] is kind of close to Joy right because in
[38:22] both cases we're laughing and praising
[38:23] Lord but it's not silly it's Joy
[38:29] right it's just oh thank you Jesus feels
[38:31] so wonderful I feel so free I want to
[38:33] praise God with my whole body Hallelujah
[38:36] but it's not like oh let's do a whirly
[38:38] dance or something like that
[38:40] right
[38:42] so it's both right it's we're bouncing
[38:44] Liberty and the fear of the Lord
[38:46] hallelujah fear of the Lord is your
[38:49] confidence in God when you're when
[38:50] you're obeying God you have confidence
[38:52] in God
[38:53] the fear of the Lord is your Refuge it's
[38:55] a prerequisite for wisdom which which
[38:57] the Bible says is the main thing get
[38:59] wisdom with all thy getting get wisdom
[39:02] fear the lord is your Fountain of Life
[39:04] amen it's your choice you have a choice
[39:06] to fear the lord or not today
[39:08] it's also your conclusion about your
[39:10] purpose in life now you know nobody here
[39:12] should go and say what's my purpose in
[39:13] life it's the fear God
[39:15] it's very simple fear God and keep the
[39:18] commands brother Chris that's what the
[39:19] Bible says it's the whole conclusion of
[39:21] of what your life's purpose is and as
[39:23] you fear God brother as we fear God as
[39:26] we morally reverence God God opens up
[39:29] all the doors of Our Lives he closes the
[39:32] wrong doors he opens the right doors
[39:34] as you walk with him
[39:36] we just have to fear Him respect his
[39:39] word honor his word
[39:41] and it'll open up every door
[39:45] fear the lord is your lesson to be
[39:47] learned it's your path to blessings and
[39:49] it's your path to praise
[39:51] oh thank God Amen see like I said you
[39:55] know a person who's who's guilty of sin
[39:57] and haven't hasn't confessed and how are
[39:59] they going to dance for the Lord
[40:01] that shows the nominations of dance
[40:03] they're probably already in sin it shows
[40:05] they're not really dancing with the fear
[40:06] of the Lord they're just dancing for
[40:07] actual physical pleasure
[40:09] and you can see in the way they dance
[40:10] sometimes they don't even dance they
[40:12] know these crazy dances like I tried I
[40:14] tried to show you on Wednesday but the
[40:15] Lord cut that off so
[40:16] it seem like
[40:18] I just want to give you some concrete
[40:19] examples
[40:21] but see
[40:23] as we fear God as we respect his word
[40:25] every day and say say Lord teach me
[40:27] today Lord I'm drawing closer to you
[40:29] today then God will give us the fear of
[40:31] the Lord and that will give us a reason
[40:32] to praise
[40:36] hallelujah it's your path to praise if
[40:38] you want to praise God if you want to
[40:39] worship God fear the Lord hallelujah
[40:42] keep his commands the fear of the Lord
[40:44] is to hate evil and depart from every
[40:46] Wicked way praise God
[40:49] see that's how you'll that's how you
[40:51] have enough joy to dance or praise the
[40:53] Lord or sing or shout or scream or
[40:54] whatever you want to do roll on the
[40:55] floor whatever you want to do praise God
[40:57] that's how you get the victory of it is
[40:59] confessing all your sin getting all
[41:01] sinned under the blood of Jesus and then
[41:02] you know in heaven you're totally
[41:04] forgiven praise God
[41:07] so we want to begin our services we want
[41:10] to begin our worship in the fear of the
[41:11] Lord and then we want to like this this
[41:13] service today we want to begin it in the
[41:16] fear of God
[41:18] and they want to see how the Holy Ghost
[41:20] is going to move is it going to bring us
[41:22] to a repentance service
[41:26] like a couple Wednesdays ago we had some
[41:27] good prayer up here for repentance you
[41:28] know people want to draw closer to God
[41:30] remember that that's like that the Holy
[41:32] Ghost we might have started happy and
[41:34] joyful but it moved to repentance it's
[41:36] actually when I preach on the fear of
[41:37] the Lord the first time
[41:40] and church I never know which way it's
[41:41] going to go that first time I was
[41:43] preaching on the fear Lord I thought man
[41:44] this is the heart this is a pretty hard
[41:45] service here I wonder if anybody's
[41:46] saying amen I wonder if anybody's like
[41:48] Lord did I miss your calling and then
[41:51] after the service like five or six
[41:52] people come up from prayer we're
[41:53] screaming praising and shouting giving
[41:55] God the glory it was just
[41:56] I just never really know I'm not God you
[41:58] know
[41:59] but we got to watch how the Holy Ghost
[42:01] is moving praise God
[42:04] everything must be done decently and in
[42:06] order and the fear of the Lord
[42:09] we're like how about rejoicing who would
[42:10] have thought last Wednesday would have
[42:11] been the greatest service our some of
[42:13] our girls had been in who would have
[42:15] thought it went a Wednesday night in
[42:16] December it's cold
[42:19] and we had the heat off
[42:22] see God just does things when he wants
[42:24] to do it praise God
[42:30] how about the healing service from
[42:31] Brother Johnny's foot got healed it was
[42:32] all swollen I can still see today so
[42:35] massive and he said the Lord revealed to
[42:37] him if I prayed for that and cursed that
[42:39] swelliness he'd be made well and the
[42:41] next day he was like 90 better by
[42:43] Tuesday it was 100 well
[42:45] now when I prayed for that I didn't have
[42:46] the same confidence because that
[42:48] Revelation wasn't mine but I had hope I
[42:51] didn't have a revelation he was going to
[42:52] get well because it wasn't revealed to
[42:53] me but I joined my faith that I had and
[42:56] my hope I joined that in there and God
[42:57] answered praise God
[43:01] it's also good to know too brother
[43:03] Brandon remember I think I told this to
[43:04] Naomi she asked about it in a Sunday
[43:06] School
[43:07] she asked about is it okay to have
[43:08] healing services and different yeah
[43:10] different services for different needs
[43:11] of course and I thought that's a great
[43:12] question brother bramwood he would he
[43:14] would literally ask the people if you
[43:16] heard on tape how many won a healing
[43:17] service and the hands would go up I mean
[43:19] there's
[43:20] a Congregation of 200 and there's like
[43:22] probably 100 people sick there you know
[43:23] think about our church that's a lot of
[43:26] sick people in the church
[43:27] yet they still came to church
[43:29] I'm not telling you to come spread your
[43:31] diseases I'm not coming to tell you to
[43:33] do that
[43:34] but you know maybe that different uh
[43:37] different infirmities
[43:38] but see you know next time like I think
[43:41] a member last brother amen got so sick
[43:43] you know with coven maybe we should add
[43:44] a healing service you know
[43:46] so I'm just like now going forward for
[43:48] the future
[43:49] right if we see Jose stay sick or God
[43:53] forbid but you know if we see people
[43:55] getting sick let's have it I'll just
[43:56] preach Divine Healing and then you know
[43:58] for people that can come you know if the
[44:00] sick people can't come we'll just pray
[44:01] for those who are here and they'll stand
[44:02] in for prayer
[44:04] you know so I think that's a good
[44:06] that's a good way to go
[44:08] see we just we start with the fear of
[44:10] God and which way is the holy spirit
[44:12] going to move today
[44:15] intercession remember we prayed for
[44:16] Lena's mom that's a great service
[44:17] Wednesday night again
[44:20] Satan get out Satan get out Jesus Jesus
[44:23] just a powerful service
[44:26] I didn't know it was going to end like
[44:27] that nobody knew but that was a we spent
[44:30] extra time prayer my hands are I was
[44:32] holding Austin's hands so hard and
[44:33] Lena's hands they heard after after the
[44:35] prayer it's like a 20 or 15 or 20 minute
[44:38] prayer my hands hurt Edwards because
[44:39] we're squeezing so hard
[44:41] praying it was intercession
[44:44] and Jesus came down and Vindicated that
[44:46] praise God
[44:48] so you never know how the spirit's going
[44:50] to move
[44:51] the other services there might be for
[44:52] boldness
[44:53] or for building your faith
[44:55] or I could name lots of them you're like
[44:57] any any attribute over there
[45:00] you know the Holy Spirit could
[45:02] bring someone to whatever they have need
[45:04] of for that service so we want to watch
[45:06] it we want to begin with the fear of God
[45:08] I want to read a couple quotes here
[45:11] I just like this one because I'm talking
[45:12] about getting Victory and brother random
[45:14] said I never saw dancing in the spirit
[45:16] get out of order
[45:20] okay
[45:21] oh you say I can't see these things I
[45:23] don't believe in shouting I don't
[45:24] believe in speaking in tongues I don't
[45:25] believe in Divine Healing it just shows
[45:26] you never got the victory that's why
[45:28] they don't believe in it because they've
[45:29] never been there
[45:31] they never seen tongues and they never
[45:33] seen uh shouting they never seen a
[45:36] reason to dance the reason they don't
[45:37] believe is because they never experience
[45:39] it if only they would yield and enjoy
[45:41] the experience of it praise God thank
[45:43] God we've had the experience praise God
[45:45] Hallelujah we can believe because we've
[45:48] experienced it praise God and God wants
[45:50] us to have those experiences
[45:52] just shows you never had it that's right
[45:55] but one time you get the victory then
[45:57] you got it that's right yes sir then you
[45:59] can shout you've seen one time I used to
[46:02] think about dancing in the spirit see
[46:03] somebody standing dance in the spirit
[46:04] now I've seen the mockery put on of it
[46:06] but I've seen the real thing
[46:09] see some people mock it like I was
[46:11] saying with denominations they dance for
[46:12] Jesus and they go home and the women cut
[46:14] their hair the men smoke and drink and
[46:15] commit adultery and watch porn that's
[46:17] that's wickedness that's a mockery of
[46:20] the Holy Spirit but brother Adam says if
[46:21] you dance and shout and you live right
[46:23] he said that's all right he said I
[46:25] believe in that praise God Amen
[46:28] Hallelujah that's the liberty of the
[46:30] Holy Spirit
[46:34] he said so I come to find out why people
[46:36] dance in the spirit or why could people
[46:38] dance in the spirit I've never seen one
[46:40] get out of the way I've never seen one
[46:42] act immorally I always see it just as
[46:44] decently and in order and sweetness
[46:47] and even Sinners run to the Altar and
[46:49] get saved when it's going on well I
[46:51] wondered why it was and I come to find
[46:53] out it's victory
[46:54] and we dance on Wednesday and that
[46:57] brother got saved and baptized on
[46:58] yesterday by God's grace I thought
[47:00] that's a good it's a good follow-up by
[47:02] God's grace he said David danced before
[47:04] the Lord when the ark was brought back
[47:06] to its resting place amen when David saw
[47:08] the word as it was then with the tables
[47:10] of stone brought back to its original
[47:11] Place David rejoiced and dance in the
[47:13] spirit around and around and around why
[47:15] he saw the word back in his place
[47:18] what the world or I'm sorry what uh what
[47:21] the word needs is not some old Seminary
[47:23] some theological mix-up but an
[47:25] old-fashioned godsend preacher behind
[47:27] the pulpit with the word of God seeing
[47:29] God vindicate it proof
[47:32] yes then David said glory to God this is
[47:35] it and around and around his little
[47:37] stuck up wife's set up over there being
[47:39] the King's Daughter said why he
[47:41] embarrasses me and David said you don't
[47:42] like that watch this and around and
[47:45] around he went again oh yes oh my what a
[47:47] time he had you know God looked down
[47:49] from heaven said David you're a man
[47:51] after my own heart
[47:53] see see what he had done lost all his
[47:56] bride he done lost all of his pride
[47:58] hallelujah amen hallelujah see now we
[48:02] see Sin Sin keeps us from dancing
[48:05] sin keeps us from honoring God with our
[48:08] entire body
[48:10] sin keeps you from raising your hands
[48:12] sin keeps you from shouting Pride keeps
[48:15] you those things but when you confess
[48:16] your pride and you're all humble God can
[48:19] use you however he wants to use you amen
[48:26] hahaha he looked down and said that's a
[48:28] man after my own heart praise God that's
[48:30] my boy right there Hallelujah
[48:32] he didn't look at Michael and say oh
[48:34] that's my starchy stiff stuck up
[48:36] daughter
[48:37] no he said I'm going to curse that woman
[48:40] right he said but I'm looking at the one
[48:42] who worshiped me with all their heart
[48:44] soul mind and strength That's My Boy
[48:46] amen
[48:49] Hallelujah
[48:51] he knowed he was acquainted with the
[48:53] possessor of heavens and earth Church
[48:56] and here was the word of God coming
[48:57] right back among them again and David
[48:59] was so happy he danced he just danced as
[49:03] hard as he could
[49:06] Hallelujah
[49:08] it goes into Miriam
[49:10] he said oh when she's seen the enemies
[49:13] that had tormented her see when you see
[49:14] your tormentors dead then she danced in
[49:16] the spirit that's right now see after
[49:17] the after the battles won the glory of
[49:20] God comes down amen
[49:23] amen like I said church if you got a
[49:25] testimony then you ought to come to
[49:26] church and share that testimony and then
[49:28] you ought to give God some type of
[49:29] expression of Thanksgiving
[49:33] like I said when I said when Austin gets
[49:35] out of debt I'm gonna dance around the
[49:36] church and I dance around the church
[49:37] praise God
[49:38] Hallelujah because I want to make sure
[49:41] God knows how much I appreciate what
[49:43] he's done for us praise God
[49:45] that's right
[49:46] the church the main thing I do is lose
[49:48] all of our pride that's the main thing
[49:50] Hallelujah the battle's won the glory of
[49:52] God comes down oh it's beautiful
[49:55] now I want to say brother Brown said in
[49:57] the Ephesian Church age when they left
[49:58] their first love
[50:00] there was going to become a subtle group
[50:02] of preachers that would take over with
[50:04] false doctrines I believe we don't have
[50:06] hardly any false Doctrine as far as I
[50:08] know I just want to be humble by saying
[50:10] that if I say I have all the true
[50:12] Doctrine well then I'm making myself God
[50:15] right if I say I've got all right
[50:18] Doctrine well
[50:19] I think I'm what am I Jesus or something
[50:21] like that of course not
[50:23] so all of us have room to grow
[50:26] brother man said bye brother said watch
[50:28] the man who says he's got all the
[50:29] answers
[50:31] I said because that guy he's prideful
[50:33] right
[50:34] that's right praise God
[50:37] and so brother man said there's going to
[50:39] come a group of preachers in and they're
[50:41] gonna
[50:42] uh they would exclude the people from
[50:44] any part of Holy Ghost spirit ministry
[50:46] that's why I'm glad so many people got
[50:48] involved on Wednesday night whether at
[50:50] your chair or here you know
[50:52] everybody's supposed to be a part of the
[50:53] Holy Spirit Worship
[50:56] but see evil preachers will limit the
[50:59] people and keep them from the real
[51:01] Liberty of the Holy Spirit
[51:03] now look even in brother Ramsay even
[51:05] today among those who claim to be free
[51:07] and for the Holy Spirit I mean how many
[51:08] free
[51:09] how many follow the Holy Spirit
[51:11] there's not too much freedom in the lady
[51:13] yet everybody says they're free
[51:15] right but he's talking about the
[51:17] churches in those days
[51:19] and the best we can see is a few
[51:21] preachers with inspired preaching how do
[51:23] you know it's inspired because it
[51:24] discerns the thoughts and Tents of your
[51:25] heart that's I know it's inspired
[51:28] it's a word and due season how pleasant
[51:31] it is praise God amen
[51:33] yeah that's why I know that sermon I
[51:35] preached on Wednesday was in due season
[51:36] because everybody got into it
[51:38] right it was the Holy Spirit
[51:40] but not every service is a dancing
[51:41] service
[51:42] you know that I know that
[51:46] so brother I said I see a few preachers
[51:48] who actually preach inspired while the
[51:50] flock just sits there and tries to
[51:52] absorb it so see I don't want to be an
[51:55] absorber I don't want to be trying to
[51:57] absorb I actually want to be inspired
[52:00] I'm trying to understand no I don't want
[52:02] to be that I want to be I understand I'm
[52:04] inspired I'm free praise God
[52:07] I'm free and full of the spirit I'm not
[52:09] trying to be free I'm not trying to
[52:11] understand how do I get Deliverance or I
[52:13] want to be delivered praise God
[52:15] and then when I'm free that I can praise
[52:17] God hallelujah
[52:19] my God Amen
[52:22] this is a far cry from Paul who said
[52:24] that when all came together all had the
[52:27] Leaning of the spirit and all
[52:28] participated in spiritual worship
[52:32] this is see this is where we're going
[52:33] back to church this is where we're going
[52:34] back to everybody in the church has a
[52:37] leading of the Lord
[52:39] that's what Paul said if the whole
[52:40] church become together one place and all
[52:42] speak with tongues and they're coming
[52:43] those that are unlearned or unbelievers
[52:45] will they not say that you're mad but if
[52:47] all prophesy and they're coming one that
[52:49] believes not or one unlearned he is
[52:51] convinced of all he is judged of all
[52:54] and thus listen the secrets of his heart
[52:56] made manifest
[52:58] and so falling down on his face he will
[53:00] worship God and report that God is in
[53:02] you of a truth
[53:04] so that's what we desire and that church
[53:05] that's why we need to pray more for
[53:06] services when guests come like Chris or
[53:08] now these are part of the family of God
[53:10] or like jakori we when we see visitors
[53:12] here that's a time we really need to
[53:13] pray I mean we should pray it all the
[53:15] time but when you see someone who's new
[53:17] that's when we should pray and say God
[53:18] reveal their Seekers to them so they
[53:21] know you're here praise God
[53:23] that is just out of church service it's
[53:25] a meeting with God hallelujah
[53:29] Hallelujah
[53:33] it's exactly right
[53:35] that's what it was and in every in every
[53:36] situation you know God revealed uh the
[53:39] unknown handwriting on the wall to
[53:40] belshazzar revealing the secrets praise
[53:43] God Jesus with the gets a discernment
[53:45] revealing the thoughts and intents of
[53:46] Nathaniel's Heart Right the woman at the
[53:48] well praise God
[53:50] Peter's heart Jesus was constantly and
[53:52] that's a proof that Christ isn't the man
[53:54] say Amen oh
[53:56] thank God how many times have I seen him
[53:58] praise God
[53:59] all the time praise God and church you
[54:01] don't have to be me it can be you after
[54:02] the service going to pray for somebody
[54:04] remember brother Diggs testimony there
[54:06] was that woman in the back and she said
[54:07] God
[54:08] if you're really in this have brother
[54:10] Diggs come give me a high five
[54:12] she was in the very back and brother
[54:14] Diggs was in the front and bro dick said
[54:16] he was just moved by the Holy Spirit
[54:17] went back there and gave her a big high
[54:18] five and she started screaming and got
[54:20] the victory got Deliverance over some
[54:22] type of a bondage or something like that
[54:25] see that's a prayer she prayed in her
[54:28] heart nobody heard it except God Amen
[54:30] and then God answer that prayer praise
[54:32] God
[54:35] see that's what we want we want to we
[54:37] want the people to experience so much of
[54:38] God that they fall down and say God is
[54:41] in this place
[54:42] and then they'll keep coming back praise
[54:44] God just like you
[54:45] just like me praise God
[54:49] how is it then brother when you come
[54:52] together everyone you have to assume
[54:53] have the doctor and have the tongue half
[54:55] the Revelation hath interpretation let
[54:56] all things be done unto edify so see
[54:59] church this is what we can come we can
[55:01] come to church with a song we can come
[55:03] to church with a Doctrine
[55:04] right we can come to church with a
[55:05] tongue we can come to church with a
[55:07] revelation with interpretation
[55:09] we should all come to participate in the
[55:11] worship of God
[55:13] I'll never forget in here when I
[55:15] preached I've shared this before I was
[55:17] preaching on Saul and David years ago
[55:19] probably 2016 2017. we moved in here in
[55:22] late 2015.
[55:24] but there was this visitor I didn't no
[55:25] idea who he was I was just preaching on
[55:28] my regular notes I preached on the life
[55:29] of Saul and how he was backslidden and
[55:32] then he was uh uh he suffered all I just
[55:35] went through all of Saul's sufferings
[55:37] and the man was a grandfather a young
[55:39] grandfather but a man a grandfather
[55:41] nonetheless and after service in that
[55:43] parking lot he pulled me aside and said
[55:45] brother Jesse you preached my entire
[55:46] life I'm Saul
[55:49] everything you preach about Saul was me
[55:53] he said now I'm going to jail because I
[55:55] abused a certain certain person
[55:57] he said pray for me so I pray for him
[55:59] and later years later I saw him he
[56:01] finally got out of jail and he was
[56:02] trying to serve God again
[56:03] but that's that's the Holy Spirit
[56:06] I'm just in my regular routine of trying
[56:08] to finish a series but then God steps in
[56:10] there praise God how the hell you praise
[56:12] God
[56:15] or that five identifications when sister
[56:16] Marie was bleeding and I preached on the
[56:19] five identification of the true church
[56:20] one of them is these signs follow them
[56:22] that believe praise God
[56:24] as you come right up
[56:26] and God stop the bleeding right away
[56:28] praise God well the last time I preached
[56:30] on the fear of the Lord remember me
[56:31] shared that good testimony you know
[56:33] everything in the sermon was just
[56:34] exactly what you need to hear
[56:37] see that's how we know God is among us
[56:39] because God speaks to us God knows our
[56:41] troubles he knows our trials but he's
[56:43] here to deliver us amen ah
[56:46] so every one of us can come to church
[56:49] with some anointing
[56:53] remember when you struggled Lydia and
[56:55] then sister Naomi says to beat your
[56:57] sister who I prayed for you that was
[56:58] beautiful
[57:00] when you had that Revival brother when
[57:02] you had that Revival remember you come
[57:04] remember when you come up and laid hands
[57:05] on me I don't know if I share this with
[57:06] the church but I was really struggling
[57:07] that morning just with you know battles
[57:09] and unbelief and when you laid your
[57:10] hands on me I just it just set me free
[57:12] right there
[57:14] I was like what do I preach I didn't I
[57:15] didn't tell you yeah that's the first
[57:16] time I just thought of it now I didn't
[57:18] plan to say that you know
[57:19] I remember I was like man this guy's
[57:21] coming in here he's all crying he's my
[57:22] name is all on fire and I'm like
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:25] it just broke me out of the thing I was
[57:28] battling praise God
[57:30] it's the anointing that breaks the yolks
[57:32] amen Hallelujah thank God
[57:36] I don't have to be a shouting anointing
[57:37] all the time
[57:38] I know I shout a lot you know I pay for
[57:41] it later don't don't you worry about
[57:42] that I pay for it later
[57:44] but
[57:45] you know many times we see it in
[57:46] sincerity
[57:48] but Amanda says you want to get closer
[57:49] to God he said be more sincere
[57:51] he said you must be more sincere in the
[57:53] third poll in other words the speaking
[57:54] of the word the revelation of the word
[57:57] gotta be more sincere
[57:58] so I try to be as sincere as I possibly
[58:00] can praise God
[58:03] now I've read this one before but how
[58:05] many would like to have a real Bible
[58:06] Church a real Bible Church where all the
[58:08] spiritual gifts were set in order
[58:09] everything make and manifest just
[58:11] exactly the way it should be wouldn't
[58:12] that be wonderful now you're going to
[58:14] have to sacrifice not money you're gonna
[58:15] have to sacrifice what some of your own
[58:17] ideas you're gonna have to sacrifice
[58:19] some time in prayer you're gonna have to
[58:20] sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break
[58:22] down in humility
[58:24] how much Jesus amen
[58:27] to break down in humility just say God
[58:29] help me just to do what the Bible says
[58:30] to do
[58:32] you're going to have the whole Christian
[58:34] move is sacrificial he that will follow
[58:36] me let him deny himself take up his
[58:38] cross and follow me daily is that right
[58:40] how often do we have to sacrifice
[58:41] brother every day Paul said he died
[58:43] daily
[58:44] every day he died
[58:48] now Church there's no Bible verse that
[58:50] says we have to have all nine gifts of
[58:51] the Spirit
[58:52] I've seen all of them operate in one
[58:54] time or another but there's no Bible
[58:56] verse brother and believe they should be
[58:57] in every church but then if you go to 63
[58:59] questions answers brother says we don't
[59:00] have all the gifts in the church and he
[59:02] doesn't make a big deal of it he doesn't
[59:03] rebuke the people
[59:04] because gifts are a major or minor
[59:07] ah you pass the test good job pass the
[59:09] first quiz
[59:10] the first question of the day you pass
[59:12] it gifts are a minor the major is the
[59:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[59:18] salvation those are the majors praise
[59:19] God Divine Healing is a minor
[59:22] right but there's times the miners need
[59:23] to be played out right there's times we
[59:25] need Divine Healing Services there's
[59:26] times we need dancing services
[59:29] Hallelujah
[59:30] we need though we need all these praise
[59:32] God we need the whole Orchestra of God's
[59:34] word we need the whole uh sheet music of
[59:37] God's word to be beaten out praise God
[59:41] so why so we can say I'm one of them
[59:44] praise God I know what today in
[59:46] Pentecost is like I also know what you
[59:48] know uh the suffering of John was like
[59:51] I know the suffering of what Paul had
[59:53] but I also know the glory of the
[59:55] Resurrection amen hallelujah
[59:58] I know him in the powers resurrection
[1:00:00] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:00:08] so we got to know both we got to have
[1:00:09] the balance right we've got to have
[1:00:10] Liberty and we got to have fear of the
[1:00:13] Lord
[1:00:14] we've got to have the resurrection power
[1:00:15] we also got to have suffering
[1:00:17] none of us went suffering but sorry you
[1:00:19] already signed up for it
[1:00:21] me too
[1:00:22] now
[1:00:24] honestly I didn't get a chance to go
[1:00:26] through too many of these scriptures
[1:00:27] here
[1:00:31] but I'm going to actually look for this
[1:00:32] file real quick this is the one kind of
[1:00:35] like a last minute thought I wanted to
[1:00:36] add in here so just bear with me
[1:00:39] uh here's there's two things that we
[1:00:41] want to do especially for brother Chris
[1:00:42] here as he's learning you know as a new
[1:00:44] Christian
[1:00:45] When We Gather rather there's two main
[1:00:46] things we want to set our mind on we're
[1:00:48] going to set our mind on the Saints in
[1:00:51] the church God's people and we want to
[1:00:52] set them on heaven
[1:00:54] because David said here's a man after
[1:00:56] God's Own Heart the same guy that danced
[1:00:58] around
[1:00:58] same guy that shouted with all his might
[1:01:01] dance with all of his might
[1:01:03] he said I have set my affection to the
[1:01:06] house of my God
[1:01:08] I have of my own proper good of gold and
[1:01:10] silver which I have given to the house
[1:01:12] of God in other words I paid my tithes
[1:01:13] and I'll tell you church he gave a lot
[1:01:15] of offerings now I'm not asking you for
[1:01:17] offerings I'm just telling you he was a
[1:01:19] man after God's Own Heart praise God
[1:01:22] and he wanted to build the house of God
[1:01:24] over and above all that I prepared for
[1:01:26] the Holy House
[1:01:28] in other words the more you have the
[1:01:29] more you give
[1:01:34] so his love was for the house of God
[1:01:38] our love is for the house of God because
[1:01:40] we want to provoke Chris as a new
[1:01:41] Christian also I want to provoke brother
[1:01:44] Vang and brother Austin and brother amen
[1:01:46] and brother where's brother Malachi
[1:01:47] he'll be back in here soon brother Ray I
[1:01:50] want to provoke Brother Ray I want to
[1:01:51] provoke all the brothers unto more love
[1:01:54] and good works
[1:01:57] in other words I want to stir them up am
[1:01:58] I talking to them I want to stir them up
[1:02:00] and just go do something for Jesus
[1:02:03] whatever God's called you to do you
[1:02:05] figure out what God you pray God God
[1:02:06] will open the door for you
[1:02:08] but I want that's we come together I
[1:02:11] love God's house because I want to go
[1:02:12] there and I want to help brother amen to
[1:02:14] be the best song leader he can be the
[1:02:16] best preacher he can be
[1:02:19] Hallelujah
[1:02:21] Glory
[1:02:24] see I love God's house because I want to
[1:02:27] go strengthen God's people
[1:02:29] and I'm not going to forsake the Saints
[1:02:31] the Bible said don't forsake there's
[1:02:32] something you ever seen so Chris don't
[1:02:34] let don't let anything ever get into
[1:02:35] your way from coming to church
[1:02:38] so if your car breaks down or something
[1:02:40] like that you call me I'll come pick you
[1:02:41] up
[1:02:42] Hallelujah we never want to miss church
[1:02:45] if possible unless we're sick and we
[1:02:47] feel led to stay home
[1:02:49] because the Bible says that's what the
[1:02:51] manner of Sinners is Right some is but
[1:02:53] we don't want to do that we want to
[1:02:55] exhort which means to speak positive
[1:02:57] words to build people up we want to
[1:02:59] exhort one another and so much the more
[1:03:02] as you see that day approaching
[1:03:04] oh
[1:03:06] thank God that's why we're having Church
[1:03:07] on Friday night praise God that's why
[1:03:09] we're gonna have church in two Saturdays
[1:03:10] on the New Year's Eve service Hallelujah
[1:03:13] we want to gather more as you see that
[1:03:15] day approaching we already gather
[1:03:17] together more than most churches we have
[1:03:19] three every week most people just have
[1:03:21] two a week
[1:03:22] but that's my faith and then we have
[1:03:23] Bible studies right brother sometimes we
[1:03:25] have Bible studies and that's wonderful
[1:03:26] there's Seasons where we go through that
[1:03:28] given more time to the house or we have
[1:03:30] fellowships on Saturdays or
[1:03:32] Hallelujah
[1:03:34] and we need to go gather more as we see
[1:03:37] Jesus's Rapture approaching
[1:03:41] so see we have we set our affections on
[1:03:44] the house of God
[1:03:46] and I love what brother Brown says here
[1:03:48] he says we set in Heavenly places in
[1:03:50] Christ Jesus the holy ghost coming among
[1:03:52] us overshadowing us empowering us with
[1:03:54] gifts signs wonders and miracles why
[1:03:57] it's the closest thing to Heaven There
[1:03:59] is on Earth amen that's why David loved
[1:04:01] going to church it was the closest thing
[1:04:03] he said I love to go I love to inquire
[1:04:05] of God I love to ask God I love to have
[1:04:07] God answer my questions I love to
[1:04:09] worship God it's the closest thing to
[1:04:10] Heaven you ever find is God's house amen
[1:04:14] Hallelujah
[1:04:17] think about it you've been so close to
[1:04:19] the houses of hell when you were a
[1:04:20] sinner right right because you felt
[1:04:22] Austin's the same name I say Amen
[1:04:24] there's times we've actually felt evil
[1:04:27] we felt demonic powers and we were so
[1:04:30] close to hell but here we come to the
[1:04:32] house of God and now by God's grace
[1:04:34] we're not far from God we're drawing
[1:04:36] closer to God and this is the closest we
[1:04:38] ever feel to Heaven is into the presence
[1:04:40] of Jesus Christ and Christ in his people
[1:04:42] praise God
[1:04:46] like there's been times of the past but
[1:04:48] Amy and I have had personal talks and
[1:04:49] we've been weeping and crying and that's
[1:04:51] like those are some of the most holy
[1:04:52] moments
[1:04:54] of Our Lives
[1:04:56] when we're totally sincere totally
[1:04:58] transparent
[1:05:00] or we're dancing like those are some of
[1:05:02] the happiest times of hey look your
[1:05:03] brother Chris is dancing awesome we're
[1:05:05] dancing it's just it's joyful
[1:05:08] or see when I saw Haven run around the
[1:05:10] church I thought yeah
[1:05:12] yeah Hallelujah
[1:05:13] there's joy in the house of the Lord
[1:05:15] praise God
[1:05:16] the closest thing there is to heaven on
[1:05:19] Earth
[1:05:19] is coming to church
[1:05:22] but then the Bible says also so set your
[1:05:24] affection on the house of God make sure
[1:05:26] you love God's worship more than
[1:05:27] anything else and then also set your
[1:05:29] mind on Heavenly things
[1:05:31] if you're risen in Christ Chris has now
[1:05:33] risen in Christ because he died in
[1:05:35] Christ baptism now he's risen in Christ
[1:05:37] if you're risen in Christ seek those
[1:05:39] things which are above what the commands
[1:05:41] from heaven
[1:05:43] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:05:44] of God
[1:05:46] set your affections on things above see
[1:05:49] we don't want to set our affections on
[1:05:50] things of the Earth because they'll
[1:05:51] disappoint us
[1:05:54] we want to set our affection on things
[1:05:56] above not on things on the Earth
[1:06:00] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:06:02] with Christ in God
[1:06:05] Oh what a beautiful scripture now before
[1:06:07] we get to that get your Bible I want to
[1:06:08] read a couple more verses here
[1:06:11] I'll go to Psalm 5 verse 7.
[1:06:14] uh yeah because I don't I don't want to
[1:06:16] switch over so Psalm 5 verse 7.
[1:06:32] okay Psalm five or seven uh Lydia you
[1:06:34] want to read down
[1:06:42] amen so come to church remembering God's
[1:06:45] multitude of mercies toward you in other
[1:06:48] words come to church thankful that you
[1:06:49] can actually come
[1:06:52] and fear worship God in the fear that's
[1:06:55] why we start the services with the fear
[1:06:56] of the Lord
[1:06:58] God is here God is present Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] help me to honor your help me to respect
[1:07:02] your name help me to obey everything I
[1:07:04] come in the fear of the Lord
[1:07:07] go to Psalm 77 13 Psalm 77 13 and Emma

[1:07:13] Psalm 77 13.
[1:07:27] amen God's way in other words God's will
[1:07:31] for your life you'll find it right here
[1:07:32] in the house of God
[1:07:35] right don't listen all those Guru guys
[1:07:36] out there they might have a little bit
[1:07:37] of Truth you know I listen a lot of
[1:07:38] those productivity guys
[1:07:40] how to find your things you find God's
[1:07:43] way right here in the house of God
[1:07:45] yeah they can say nice things but
[1:07:46] nothing is above God's word
[1:07:49] go to Psalms 100 verse 4. Malachi can
[1:07:52] you read that Psalm 100 verse 4.
[1:07:56] that's why no matter the situation come
[1:07:58] into God's house and give Thanksgiving
[1:08:00] to God that's a part of our worship
[1:08:02] it's Malachi whenever you're ready
[1:08:10] amen praise God and so we do that by the
[1:08:13] grace of the Lord
[1:08:16] oh my there's so many good ones here um
[1:08:20] go to the New Testament uh Hebrews 13
[1:08:22] 15. Hebrews 13 15 and sister who would
[1:08:25] that be okay could you read that Hebrews
[1:08:27] 13 15. I see you do a good good job
[1:08:29] turning your Bible there
[1:08:31] Hallelujah
[1:08:36] 13 15. yeah whatever you're ready
[1:08:47] amen so see that's why you know as we
[1:08:51] sing say thank you Jesus praise the Lord
[1:08:52] that's why you'll see me say hallelujah
[1:08:54] praise the Lord hold that's why I'll say
[1:08:55] let's all say praise the Lord you know
[1:08:57] that's what we're commanded to do
[1:08:59] all right it's the word of God that's
[1:09:01] your sacrifice praise God
[1:09:03] right we don't praise him enough so I
[1:09:05] want to make sure we get here we get
[1:09:06] some extra Praises in praise God
[1:09:09] none of us praise him enough
[1:09:11] but we're going that way by God's grace
[1:09:13] we're trying to grow in that in the
[1:09:14] knowledge of the Lord now there's a
[1:09:15] couple more go back to the Old Testament
[1:09:17] I just want to do two more psalm 92.
[1:09:21] 13-14 Psalm 92 13-14
[1:09:25] brother van could you read that buddy
[1:09:26] when you get that Psalm 92 13 and 14.
[1:09:31] there it is yes sir
[1:09:36] 92 13-14 whenever you're ready brother
[1:09:38] no rush
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:00] Hallelujah do you want a fruitful life
[1:10:01] brother if you do then you gotta plant
[1:10:04] be planted in the house of God
[1:10:06] so the Bible gives two of those
[1:10:07] directions right you're either a planted
[1:10:09] here like that plant back there
[1:10:12] or you're a pillar like one of these
[1:10:13] walls right here right these studs in
[1:10:15] the walls right here
[1:10:16] the Bible calls them both in other words
[1:10:18] I'm always in the house of God
[1:10:20] Hallelujah I'm either a plant or I'm one
[1:10:23] of these pillars right here you kind of
[1:10:24] see them you can kind of see them here
[1:10:26] two before is there I want to be one of
[1:10:29] those in the house of God I want to be
[1:10:30] planted the house of God I want to be a
[1:10:32] pillar in the house of God
[1:10:34] now the last one before I move on is
[1:10:35] Psalms 89 7. Psalm 89 7. Haven you want
[1:10:39] to read that hun you're getting there
[1:10:41] Psalm 89 7. now here's where this is why
[1:10:44] when we come in I'm going to get into
[1:10:45] this now this church order and this will
[1:10:46] be the last thing I preach on here
[1:10:49] uh that's why we come in here we try not
[1:10:51] to talk when we come in here
[1:10:54] because we want to start in the fear of
[1:10:55] the Lord and making sure everything is
[1:10:57] on all of our thoughts are on God we're
[1:10:59] here to worship
[1:11:00] and then we'll see which Avenue the Holy
[1:11:02] Spirit takes us
[1:11:04] so even when you're ready Psalm 89 verse
[1:11:06] 7.
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] greatly to be feared
[1:11:17] so we've got to go back to day of
[1:11:19] Pentecost or shortly after ananis and
[1:11:20] Sapphira died shortly thereafter because
[1:11:22] they lied to a preacher
[1:11:24] and we're supposed to be going back to
[1:11:26] that
[1:11:27] right
[1:11:29] and so we want to have that type of
[1:11:30] respect in other words I want to come to
[1:11:31] church and I want to say God forgive me
[1:11:33] of all my sins as I come in here
[1:11:37] and as a preacher I would say Lord if
[1:11:38] somebody didn't confess it anoint me to
[1:11:40] preach or anoint somebody else to expose
[1:11:42] sin so they can confess it praise God
[1:11:45] right because we don't want sin Among Us
[1:11:48] sin is like leaven it'll spread it's
[1:11:50] like a canker it's like a disease it's
[1:11:51] like cancer we don't want cancer we want
[1:11:53] a healthy spiritual body praise God
[1:11:57] now there's so much more there's a whole
[1:11:59] bible study on this brother we could do
[1:12:00] I got probably got 40 or 50 verses here
[1:12:02] I did this one years and years ago back
[1:12:04] in 2006 I did a whole bible study on
[1:12:06] this but let's read this here and we'll
[1:12:08] try to try to get ready to close after
[1:12:09] this it's a long quote but
[1:12:11] so now in the building I think that we
[1:12:13] ought to have this it's been dedicated
[1:12:14] or going to be dedicated a few minutes
[1:12:16] to the worship of God we should keep it
[1:12:17] that way we should never buy or sell in
[1:12:19] the building we should never do any
[1:12:20] business in this Auditorium here it
[1:12:22] should never be done in here that is
[1:12:24] such as permitting ministers that come
[1:12:25] in and sell books and everything no
[1:12:27] matter what it is there's other places
[1:12:28] to do that we shouldn't buy and sell in
[1:12:31] the house of the Lord it should be a
[1:12:32] place of worship wholly consecrated for
[1:12:35] that purpose
[1:12:36] and that's why brother Chris I don't
[1:12:38] sell any of those books they're all free
[1:12:40] just take whatever you want the thing to
[1:12:42] do is take them and read them praise God
[1:12:44] don't let them collect dust at your
[1:12:45] house read them praise God that's the
[1:12:47] thing to do
[1:12:48] see now he's given us a nice place let's
[1:12:51] dedicate to him and dedicate ourselves
[1:12:52] with it to him and now this may seem a
[1:12:55] little rude but it's not a place to
[1:12:56] visit
[1:12:58] it's a place of worship
[1:13:01] now this is pretty extreme here but you
[1:13:03] know everybody has their different
[1:13:04] leading we should never even murmur a
[1:13:07] word inside here outside of worship to
[1:13:09] one another unless it's absolutely
[1:13:11] necessary
[1:13:13] right so little girls you know sometimes
[1:13:15] during second service or before second
[1:13:17] service you know the girls as we're up
[1:13:18] here you know sometimes we gotta whisper
[1:13:20] to find our seats but I was going to do
[1:13:21] I'm gonna do a Bible study I'm gonna do
[1:13:22] the full Bible study for our Sunday
[1:13:23] school girls we got to make sure like we
[1:13:26] don't talk too much right
[1:13:28] and why why are we doing that because
[1:13:30] we're calming our Spirits down so we can
[1:13:32] hear the voice of God
[1:13:34] so we can worship God so I'm not here uh
[1:13:37] to show Haven what I drew
[1:13:40] and I like Haven's drawings but I'm not
[1:13:41] here to see Haven's drawings
[1:13:43] give them to me and she gives them to me
[1:13:45] after church
[1:13:46] well she used to now she's getting a
[1:13:47] little older for that I should probably
[1:13:48] use Karis or definitely Victoria's
[1:13:50] really getting good at drawing where's
[1:13:51] she oh yeah I've got letters from you
[1:13:54] know virtue and nature too
[1:13:57] but see we should try not at the
[1:13:58] beginning of service we should try not
[1:13:59] even to whisper or anything unless we
[1:14:02] absolutely have to because we want to
[1:14:04] greatly fear God in the Assembly of the
[1:14:05] Saints
[1:14:09] see we should never rally around or
[1:14:12] never run through the building or let
[1:14:14] our children run through the building
[1:14:15] now that doesn't mean running in the
[1:14:16] spirit like we did I believe in that
[1:14:19] but it means just treating this like any
[1:14:21] old room it's not any old room
[1:14:23] God is greatly to be feared in the
[1:14:25] Assembly of the Saints
[1:14:30] therefore dedicating ourselves let's
[1:14:31] remember when we enter that Sanctuary
[1:14:33] keep still to one another and worship
[1:14:35] God if we want to visit each other
[1:14:36] there's places we may visit each other
[1:14:38] like that but never walking around where
[1:14:40] you can't hear yourself think and some
[1:14:42] person come in they just don't know what
[1:14:44] to do see it's so much noise in things
[1:14:46] it's just humanly
[1:14:47] see people are talking how are you going
[1:14:49] to pray and talk to God lord lord speak
[1:14:51] to me Lord just help me to set me free
[1:14:53] through the music you know how are we
[1:14:55] going to talk to God if everybody's
[1:14:56] talking around here
[1:14:57] you're not you're gonna be distracted
[1:14:59] what is he saying what happened
[1:15:00] yesterday that has nothing to do with
[1:15:02] God right now you know
[1:15:04] what you bought at Walmart has nothing
[1:15:05] to do with yesterday and I said that has
[1:15:07] nothing to do with today praise God
[1:15:10] it's worship
[1:15:11] you want to be in a spot where you can
[1:15:13] hear yourself talking to God
[1:15:15] and I've seen it in churches until it's
[1:15:17] made me feel real bad because we do not
[1:15:19] come into the sanctuary of the Lord to
[1:15:20] meet each other we come here to worship
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:23] then go to our homes this extra this
[1:15:26] Sanctuary is dedicated to worship stand
[1:15:28] outside talk anything you wish as long
[1:15:29] as it's right and holy go to one
[1:15:31] another's homes visit one other places
[1:15:33] but when you enter that door brother
[1:15:34] says be quiet because that's what the
[1:15:36] Bible says
[1:15:40] you come here to talk to him and I love
[1:15:43] this and let him talk back to you
[1:15:45] that's called communion Church
[1:15:47] the trouble of it is what does the
[1:15:49] church we do I do we all do too much
[1:15:52] talking and don't listen enough
[1:15:55] then when we come in here wait on him
[1:15:59] now in the old Tabernacle there might
[1:16:01] not been one person present this morning
[1:16:02] that was there on the day of the
[1:16:03] dedication when major Ulrich played the
[1:16:06] music and I stood behind three crosses
[1:16:08] here to dedicate this place I would not
[1:16:09] permit anybody now look here's how
[1:16:11] brother RAM used to run his church you
[1:16:13] know before the tapes
[1:16:15] the ushers stood at the door to see that
[1:16:17] nobody talked so if you talk somebody
[1:16:18] will walk up and say
[1:16:23] what if I did that I could do that
[1:16:25] because the Bible says we're supposed to
[1:16:27] fear God greatly in the Assembly of the
[1:16:28] Saints I could do that but I haven't
[1:16:30] chosen to do that I wasn't raised in
[1:16:32] that
[1:16:33] some people like brother Kevin Arnett he
[1:16:34] said they were raised that way in
[1:16:35] Peregrine's church so with Brother Ray
[1:16:40] George and Lorraine yes sir
[1:16:43] and so there's different there's
[1:16:44] different uh leadings they're different
[1:16:46] operations same Holy Spirit so my
[1:16:49] leadership has always been just lead by
[1:16:50] example
[1:16:52] somebody's talking in here and they're
[1:16:53] the only one talking pretty soon they're
[1:16:54] gonna be like
[1:16:55] why am I the only one talking why is
[1:16:57] everybody else praying
[1:16:59] but I could I have the right as a pastor
[1:17:02] just just tap everyone's shoulder and
[1:17:04] say no talking
[1:17:06] we don't talk in the house of the Lord
[1:17:09] if you desire here's our love if you
[1:17:11] desire to silently come to the Altar and
[1:17:13] pray silently
[1:17:14] now sometimes I pray out loud right
[1:17:17] you walk back to your seat open up your
[1:17:19] Bible what your neighbor done that's up
[1:17:21] to him
[1:17:22] so you shouldn't be sharing notes or hey
[1:17:24] look at this and look at that unless
[1:17:25] you've got thus saith the Lord or
[1:17:26] something like that
[1:17:28] you had nothing to say if you want to
[1:17:30] talk to him say I'll see you outside in
[1:17:32] here I'm here to Worship the Lord
[1:17:34] you read his word or set quietly
[1:17:39] and then the music sister Gertie I don't
[1:17:41] know whether she's here or not this
[1:17:41] morning sister gives the old piano I
[1:17:43] believe set back in the corner of the
[1:17:44] best of my remembrance and then she
[1:17:45] would play softly down at the cross
[1:17:48] where am I see and then some real sweet
[1:17:51] soft music and then until it came time
[1:17:53] for the service and the song leader got
[1:17:54] up and let a couple of congregational
[1:17:56] songs and then if you had some
[1:17:57] outstanding solo they would sing it but
[1:17:59] never just a bunch of carrying on
[1:18:01] and then the music continually played
[1:18:03] and then when I heard that I know that
[1:18:04] it was my time to come out as a pastor
[1:18:06] when a minister walks into the
[1:18:08] congregation of people praying in the
[1:18:10] anointing of the spirit you're bound to
[1:18:12] hear from Heaven praise God
[1:18:14] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:16] it's a reality
[1:18:20] that's what I want to walk when I open
[1:18:21] that door I want to walk out here and
[1:18:22] know that people been praying singing
[1:18:24] worshiping God and they're ready to hear
[1:18:26] God's word and I'm ready to preach it
[1:18:28] amen amen remember we're going to have
[1:18:31] some church praise God Amen
[1:18:33] Hallelujah well we could have it too you
[1:18:36] know we could have it all the time
[1:18:38] he said but if there's no there's no way
[1:18:40] to keep from it see
[1:18:41] because the Bible says if you draw an
[1:18:42] eye to God what he's going to draw an
[1:18:44] eye to you
[1:18:45] but if you walk into confusion then
[1:18:47] you're so confused the spirit's grieved
[1:18:52] we don't want that no we want to come
[1:18:53] here to worship we have lovely homes
[1:18:55] that I'm going to speak on in just a
[1:18:56] minute so forth at home where we listen
[1:18:58] we visit our friends and take them this
[1:19:01] is the house of the Lord
[1:19:03] and then many times teenage children
[1:19:04] sometimes adults will get to you know
[1:19:06] young people will pass notes or cut up
[1:19:08] something in church now you're old
[1:19:09] enough to know better than that you
[1:19:11] should know better than that you
[1:19:12] shouldn't come in here if you expect to
[1:19:13] be a real man someday and raise a family
[1:19:15] to the kingdom of God then start it off
[1:19:17] at the beginning you see and act right
[1:19:19] and do right
[1:19:20] now the Usher stands at the corners of
[1:19:22] the buildings and so forth and if any
[1:19:23] carried on they're ordained as their
[1:19:25] Duty
[1:19:26] and trustee sat here in the front that
[1:19:28] in case of someone get getting
[1:19:30] misbehaving their commissioned to ask
[1:19:32] the person to be quiet now earlier this
[1:19:34] year somebody uh I'm not going to say
[1:19:36] who in particular but somebody had a
[1:19:38] device that was kept going off and after
[1:19:39] it went off of three times I'm like okay
[1:19:40] well I gotta go talk to them
[1:19:43] I said your device is going off
[1:19:46] and they said well they didn't know how
[1:19:47] to set it and thankfully it was it was
[1:19:49] an Apple device so I knew how to turn it
[1:19:51] off you know
[1:19:52] if it was Android I'm not sure if I
[1:19:54] would have known how to do that but
[1:19:55] um
[1:19:56] but that was my job as the Deacon I
[1:19:59] wasn't preaching that morning or maybe I
[1:20:01] was I don't know I can't remember but
[1:20:02] the point was like if it goes off once
[1:20:04] okay that's but it keeps going off and
[1:20:06] then I've got to do something about it
[1:20:09] um the same thing with talking or you
[1:20:11] know silliness or anything like that
[1:20:13] right like in months past you know my
[1:20:15] children as they're growing up sometimes
[1:20:17] you know nobody else is here I'll be
[1:20:18] praying at the author and my children
[1:20:19] will be talking I'll they probably see
[1:20:22] my they probably see my uh see me twist
[1:20:24] my neck around like this and I'm like
[1:20:27] you know I gotta go back
[1:20:28] that's my way of being a deacon you know
[1:20:30] to my own children my
[1:20:36] gym but that's my way of lovingly doing
[1:20:38] it by the God's grace
[1:20:41] so we've got to keep a real reverence
[1:20:43] for God and then see then we see how the
[1:20:44] holy spirit is going to direct the
[1:20:45] service praise God
[1:20:48] now if they don't have respect the
[1:20:50] teenagers it'd be better that somebody
[1:20:51] else had their seat of course we don't
[1:20:52] have to worry about that so I'll skip
[1:20:53] past that
[1:20:54] of course some now here's what I read
[1:20:56] earlier somebody works for me Lord
[1:20:58] that's expected amen so he should expect
[1:21:00] somebody to shout every service you know
[1:21:02] I'm probably going to shout each service
[1:21:04] right
[1:21:04] but we should expect other people to
[1:21:06] shout too
[1:21:08] he said that's what you're here for to
[1:21:10] Worship the Lord amen
[1:21:12] and it's just like feel feel like
[1:21:14] praising God or shouting just go right
[1:21:16] on because that's what you're here for
[1:21:19] is to Worship the Lord in your own way
[1:21:21] of worshiping but there's nobody
[1:21:23] worships the Lord while you're talking
[1:21:25] and passing notes and helping somebody
[1:21:27] else get away from the worship of the
[1:21:28] Lord
[1:21:30] so you want to make sure everything we
[1:21:32] do is helping people get into the
[1:21:34] worship of the Lord
[1:21:35] so I thought after such a joyful service
[1:21:37] on Wednesday I'd bring some some
[1:21:38] reminders here some good real strict
[1:21:40] reminders amen because the Bible says
[1:21:43] God is greatly to be feared in the
[1:21:46] Assembly of the Saints
[1:21:47] and there are seasons for joyfulness in
[1:21:49] their seasons for soberness reflection
[1:21:52] repentance
[1:21:54] and I'm closing here now
[1:21:57] just so you know I've been in contact
[1:21:58] with different people that are
[1:21:59] questioning the message
[1:22:02] which is okay I you know I listen to
[1:22:04] both sides I listen to the side that
[1:22:05] leaves and the side that worships
[1:22:07] brother Brown I listen to both sides
[1:22:08] because that's my battle I believe
[1:22:10] that's what I was born for I was born to
[1:22:11] defend this message that's what I
[1:22:13] believe that's my own revelation
[1:22:15] that's God speaking to me
[1:22:17] but I was sharing with a different
[1:22:18] person or this sweet person who who's
[1:22:20] questioning the message
[1:22:22] um
[1:22:23] that God used brother Ram to restore
[1:22:26] the faith of the fathers
[1:22:29] right and so brother Brandon had to
[1:22:31] restore Church order
[1:22:33] brother man had to restore the right
[1:22:35] worship praise God dancing and shouting
[1:22:37] and praising God but also the fear of
[1:22:39] the Lord too
[1:22:42] even the prayer lines brother around he
[1:22:44] would be real serious and then he'd make
[1:22:45] a little joke to kind of feel human
[1:22:47] again he says and kind of let off the
[1:22:48] pressure and then we go back to real
[1:22:50] sincere Discerning Discerning of the
[1:22:52] Holy Spirit
[1:22:54] he said and then he said he would try to
[1:22:56] catch people's Spirits by making jokes
[1:22:58] so they loosen up and so that they'll
[1:23:00] trust him and listen to him
[1:23:05] but you know in defending brother Bam's
[1:23:06] Ministry you know it brought me back to
[1:23:08] this chapter that I wrote and I really
[1:23:09] believe the Holy Spirit had me write it
[1:23:10] where I defend brother Adam's Ministry
[1:23:13] brother random gave us over 30 thus
[1:23:15] saith the Lords
[1:23:17] now it'd be it'd be neat right now to go
[1:23:19] through and see how many thus say those
[1:23:20] we got from Jeremiah wouldn't that be
[1:23:22] neat
[1:23:23] or Ezekiel
[1:23:25] Hallelujah
[1:23:27] in this chapter there's over 30 thus
[1:23:30] saith the Lords
[1:23:32] about God restoring us back to the
[1:23:35] original Apostolic Church the doctrines
[1:23:38] the prophecies
[1:23:40] the healings we have so many thus saith
[1:23:43] the Lords
[1:23:45] and I believe Church it gives the
[1:23:46] balance on having Liberty of the Holy
[1:23:49] Spirit and also the fear of the Lord
[1:23:52] because we've been visited by a
[1:23:54] prophetic message with thus saith the
[1:23:56] Lord
[1:23:58] I want to say like this and if God ever
[1:24:00] gave me a revelation
[1:24:02] if I ever got a revelation for God it
[1:24:04] was those 12 New Testament Mysteries
[1:24:06] and God's Vindicated that Tim hume's
[1:24:08] witness to that uh other people have
[1:24:11] witnessed to that brother Brooks the
[1:24:12] church was a witness of that
[1:24:14] I believe our church is a witness of
[1:24:16] that too
[1:24:17] but it's scriptural Elijah before The
[1:24:20] Showdown Elijah had to bring 12 Stones
[1:24:22] not 11. sure not 10.
[1:24:25] 12.
[1:24:27] before The Showdown he had to play some
[1:24:29] back in order amen hallelujah thank God
[1:24:32] Amen Elijah did it praise God
[1:24:35] and then after getting a place back
[1:24:37] together and everything was in order and
[1:24:39] the worship was given then the fire fell
[1:24:41] praise God and that's the rapturing
[1:24:43] faith that's going to fall that's the
[1:24:44] latter rain that falls upon the church
[1:24:45] praise God hallelujah praise God
[1:24:52] Hallelujah
[1:24:54] and then of course it's tight by the 12
[1:24:56] loaves of shoe bread
[1:24:58] Hallelujah 12 Stones 12 loaves of shoe
[1:25:01] bread these are the loaves
[1:25:04] the Bible calls him the bread of God's
[1:25:07] face Hallelujah
[1:25:09] so if you want to eat God's bread Church
[1:25:11] you got to understand these 12 New
[1:25:12] Testament Mysteries because they're all
[1:25:13] laying right there in the Bible
[1:25:17] Hallelujah
[1:25:20] this is God's word that we're talking
[1:25:22] about here God's word
[1:25:25] and there's there's the 12 Brothers you
[1:25:27] know there's 12 by these are Bible
[1:25:29] Mysteries the Bible calls them Mysteries
[1:25:30] and brother Ram gave us six of them with
[1:25:32] thus saith the Lord
[1:25:35] so that means we know that means we know
[1:25:37] we have God's revelation of what the
[1:25:39] Bible is saying to us
[1:25:41] we're not going to get in the Catholic
[1:25:42] church not going to get the Methodist
[1:25:43] Church they're going to hate it you know
[1:25:45] we're not going to get the Pentecostal
[1:25:46] Church they're going to hate it
[1:25:48] but we're going to get it where God's
[1:25:50] people are where God is greatly feared
[1:25:53] in the Assembly of the Saints praise God
[1:25:54] that's we're going to get it in there
[1:25:56] we're going to get God's food in God's
[1:25:58] house praise God
[1:26:02] Hallelujah
[1:26:05] you know and this I'm sorry this is what
[1:26:07] I meant too if God ever gave me a
[1:26:08] revelation it was that the Waters of
[1:26:10] Separation that brother Brandon preached
[1:26:12] the way to Fellowship the basis for
[1:26:14] fellowship if God ever gave me a
[1:26:16] revelation it was that because this is
[1:26:19] outer core so brother Chris is where
[1:26:20] you're at right here brother you're you
[1:26:21] just got baptized in water you're in the
[1:26:24] outer court now your next step is to go
[1:26:26] into the holiest I'm sorry in the Holy
[1:26:27] place that's your next step
[1:26:30] in there you have a Candlestick that's
[1:26:31] the seven Church ages I know it's hard
[1:26:33] to see brother because I didn't have a
[1:26:34] good picture here
[1:26:35] the Candlestick is that seven Church age
[1:26:37] book I gave you brother that red one
[1:26:40] it's the greatest book I've ever read
[1:26:41] outside of the Bible
[1:26:43] so I would encourage you read just five
[1:26:45] pages a day
[1:26:46] or set your timer read 10 minutes a day
[1:26:48] if you can
[1:26:51] oh yeah okay that's great that's great
[1:26:53] book too Same Spirit Rubble books I show
[1:26:56] brother Chris that uh The Testament I
[1:26:58] got back after I wrote the modesty book
[1:26:59] two women wrote me and said
[1:27:01] this book was as if Jesus Christ was
[1:27:04] talking to me himself
[1:27:06] because I told brother Chris I didn't
[1:27:07] write that book Jesus wrote that book
[1:27:10] no not every word as I say the Lord but
[1:27:11] the the revelations behind it are from
[1:27:13] God
[1:27:15] so brother in there so this is your next
[1:27:17] step brother get to know the church ages
[1:27:18] then you'll understand the Holy Ghost in
[1:27:20] every Church age and in our church amen

[1:27:31] closer yeah this is a closer picture so
[1:27:34] you have the Candlestick you have the
[1:27:35] shoe bread
[1:27:37] and then the last one before you get the
[1:27:40] baptism the Holy Ghost is the altar of
[1:27:42] incense this is for anybody in the
[1:27:43] church who's seeking the baptism of the
[1:27:45] Holy Ghost Church we've got to have a
[1:27:47] prayer life if we want to be born again
[1:27:51] we've got to understand the church ages
[1:27:53] Hallelujah that's why that series is
[1:27:55] such a beautiful series amen we have to
[1:27:58] understand how the oil flows in every
[1:28:00] generation Amen in every Church age the
[1:28:02] oil is the same it produces the same
[1:28:04] light same oil same experience praise

[1:28:11] you find your place in your in the
[1:28:13] church

[1:28:20] after coming in the message was the
[1:28:21] seven Church ages absolutely phenomenal
[1:28:24] book
[1:28:25] and then God started showing me these
[1:28:27] Mysteries I didn't know I was feasting
[1:28:29] on them

[1:28:43] and with this you come into the presence
[1:28:45] of God hallelujah
[1:28:47] and you come into there through prayer
[1:28:50] the last step before the before going
[1:28:52] into God's presence I'm gonna go back
[1:28:53] here so brother Chris this was God's
[1:28:55] presence there was three steps outer
[1:28:56] Court
[1:28:58] inner core holiest of holies that's that
[1:29:00] was in the Old Testament now there's
[1:29:02] three steps to be born again

[1:29:45] represents the incense or prayer going
[1:29:47] up to God every day
[1:29:49] and it had to have fire on it amen and
[1:29:52] fire is the holy spirit praise God so
[1:29:54] we've got to pray with God's spirit

[1:29:58] pray for this and how do we know we'll
[1:30:00] be real passionate about it
