[0:57] the invisible God the firstborn of every

[1:02] for by him were all things created so
[1:04] that means Jesus Christ created you
[1:09] and George how many believe he made you
[1:10] a vessel of Honor
[1:13] not a vessel of Dishonor he formed you
[1:15] to be a vessel of Honor
[1:17] Ed

[1:23] that are in heaven and that are in Earth
[1:25] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:27] Thrones or dominions or principalities

[1:46] let's all read Verse 18 one two three
[1:48] and he is the head of the body the
[1:52] church who is the beginning the
[1:55] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:58] things he might have the preeminence
[2:00] let's have one more word of prayer we're
[2:02] just going to look at the grace of God
[2:03] here today so Heavenly Father we love
[2:05] you we thank you God lord your Holy
[2:07] Spirit 2000 years ago penned this
[2:11] scripture on paper in a prison cell Lord
[2:14] God and you knew Lord this this this
[2:16] writing these words would be needful for
[2:19] us in this day two thousand years later
[2:22] so God May the same God hallelujah who
[2:26] wrote these words two thousand years ago
[2:28] but you give us inspiration today Lord
[2:31] we know it can't be the full inspiration
[2:33] but give us partial inspiration Lord God
[2:36] we know Lord we can preach a thousand
[2:38] years on one scripture Lord God
[2:39] Hallelujah give us inspiration for this
[2:41] text the inspiration that we have need
[2:44] of in this hour today I'm in need of you
[2:45] Lord we're all in need of you speak to
[2:47] your humble people thank you for
[2:49] sustaining Our Lives Lord to this point
[2:51] either we came from you Lord God you
[2:53] brought us here and Lord we will go back
[2:55] to you Lord when our journey Lord when
[2:57] our generation is over lord God
[2:59] hallelujah should you tarry so we ask
[3:01] Lord in Jesus Christ's name that your
[3:03] Holy Spirit Lord would speak to us today
[3:06] Lord Moses and shape us as the vessels
[3:08] you created For Your Glory and May
[3:10] glorify you today through this service
[3:12] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[3:14] said amen God bless you as you're being
[3:16] seated praise God
[3:18] some scriptures I like to show so I can
[3:21] switch over here whenever you're ready
[3:22] Malachi
[3:25] looking at part four here today by the
[3:27] grace of the Lord
[3:34] sorry you know we've dropped two
[3:37] we've dropped two sermons short in the
[3:39] last month and so I emailed the
[3:41] gentleman who looks at our sound system
[3:44] and he says the problems probably with
[3:47] Spectrum so I need to I need to call
[3:48] them I just had a busy day yesterday so
[3:50] I didn't get to it yesterday
[3:55] and the gentleman Mr Davis thinks that
[3:57] our router is old
[4:00] or something wrong with that our modem
[4:02] I'm not sure
[4:05] with your Tech guy like that but anyways
[4:08] I do apologize about that you know the
[4:10] sermon Wednesday cut off after half an
[4:11] hour I preached an hour after that so
[4:15] I'm very sorry you know if you hear the
[4:17] rest of it with little brother you know
[4:19] we do have the MP3 safe on
[4:23] save it
[4:26] don't work anymore
[4:29] well the holy spirit will be up to you
[4:32] better somehow
[4:33] it was it was one of them we just
[4:36] recently got it you know the the
[4:39] benefits of receiving the Revelation and
[4:41] the consumption system
[4:47] so I do apologize for that I need to
[4:50] reach out to them I just haven't done
[4:53] anything so I'd like to pick up here
[4:54] where we left off this is a scripture we
[4:55] left off you know back in June on a
[4:56] Wednesday night the Bible said Jesus is
[4:59] before all things and by him all things
[5:02] consist
[5:03] we know this is speaking of Jesus's
[5:05] Spirit not his flesh
[5:08] because his spirit is before all things
[5:10] numerous many things were before there
[5:12] was four thousand years of things that
[5:14] came before Jesus's flesh body all right
[5:16] because Jesus came at about after about
[5:19] 4 000 years about 2000 years after Noah
[5:22] so it was Jesus's Spirit which is the
[5:24] Holy Spirit
[5:26] that is before all things and his spirit
[5:29] makes all things continue
[5:32] they stay set in the same place praise
[5:35] God
[5:36] and Jesus sustains Our Lives now looking
[5:40] at this this text here uh it would be
[5:43] Jesus who would choose his choice now
[5:46] to sustain colossi for only 10 more
[5:50] years
[5:51] so we just get a idea there that Jesus
[5:54] will choose to sustain you for as long
[5:57] as he sees fit
[5:59] now again we don't know if these
[6:00] Believers were scattered to different
[6:01] locations we don't know if they died in
[6:03] that earthquake in colossi uh it would
[6:06] have been around 65 A.D or so
[6:10] we don't know exactly what happened to
[6:12] them all we know is that the city is a
[6:15] mound of ruins today
[6:17] and so Jesus chose I'm going to make
[6:19] this city I'm going to sustain it for 10
[6:21] more years but for 10 years they'll have
[6:23] the revelation of this letter from God's
[6:26] prophet and for 10 years they were to
[6:28] Feast on that can you imagine imagine
[6:30] the inspiration you know the preachers
[6:32] there colossi would have received you
[6:33] know at just 10 years they would have
[6:36] read this letter and then they would
[6:37] have preached as the Holy Spirit
[6:38] inspired them on the things that were
[6:40] said about the godhead about the baptism
[6:43] of the Holy Ghost about about holy
[6:45] living praise God as as Lord willing and
[6:47] we'll eventually get to chapter two and
[6:48] three and four by the grace of the Lord
[6:50] as time goes on
[6:53] but just you know just take that into
[6:54] consideration you know God doesn't uh
[6:57] allow everyone to consist as much as
[6:59] others you know in other words God has
[7:01] churches that will last longer churches
[7:03] that will last shorter
[7:05] some that will uh some of that will have
[7:08] more members less members
[7:10] God is a god of variety and God is a god
[7:13] with a story God has a story for each
[7:15] and every one of our lives
[7:18] like that great example uh I believe was
[7:21] Stephen was stoned it 29 years old
[7:24] martyred at 29 years old
[7:27] but then John would go on to live to 100
[7:29] years old
[7:30] John would have 70 more years of service
[7:33] than Stephen
[7:34] but God wrote that in Stephen's Plan
[7:36] before the foundation of the world
[7:38] praise God
[7:39] to be the first Holy Ghost filled
[7:41] Christian martyr praise God outside of
[7:42] Christ The Sinner saved by grace
[7:45] and God sustained Stephen to his 29th
[7:48] year
[7:49] and then God just God decided it's best
[7:52] now that I take him
[7:54] and when you come to Heaven Jesus give
[7:55] him a five general salute Hallelujah to
[7:59] recognize that saint of God Amen
[8:01] Hallelujah and he died like a man he
[8:03] died with the face of an Angel praise
[8:06] God
[8:07] Hallelujah but then God allowed John 70
[8:09] more years of preaching 70 more years of
[8:11] ministry
[8:13] and God was going to sustain him until
[8:15] he was 100 years old praise God so let
[8:18] ought to encourage us Church no matter
[8:19] how many years we get we ought to be
[8:21] thankful that Jesus sustains US during
[8:23] those years
[8:25] he hasn't chose us to be vessels of
[8:27] Dishonor
[8:28] he's chosen us to be vessels of Honor
[8:30] praise God
[8:32] we may have 29 years to honor him we may
[8:34] have a hundred years on him I hope I get
[8:36] 100. that's just my desire
[8:39] whenever the Rapture is I want to be
[8:41] living I hope I live to see the Rapture
[8:43] praise God
[8:44] every believer for 2 000 years has
[8:46] desired that but hasn't had it
[8:49] we may have it we may not have it but we
[8:52] want to live to see it if we do it'll be
[8:54] Christ sustaining us until we get there
[8:57] so let's just be let's just be thankful
[9:00] today for the years that God does give
[9:02] us amen
[9:03] let's choose to be grateful let us
[9:05] choose to give Thanksgiving let us
[9:07] choose to be joyful in the years we are
[9:10] sustained amen
[9:11] that's how I want to live my life praise
[9:13] God
[9:14] that I can be joyful in the years he's
[9:17] kept me standing praise God
[9:23] now here's the verse we the next verse
[9:25] he is the head of the body so this this
[9:28] firstborn of all creation the one who
[9:30] sustains all things he's the head of the
[9:33] body of the church
[9:35] and he is the beginning the firstborn
[9:37] from the dead
[9:38] that in all things he might have
[9:40] preeminence now of course this first one
[9:42] from the dead means uh that he's the
[9:45] first one who conquered death
[9:48] never to die again praise God he's the
[9:51] first one that conquered death in a
[9:53] glorified body praise God
[9:55] Hallelujah because Lazarus had died
[9:58] before Jesus
[9:59] he'd been brought forth from the dead
[10:02] and it was a great sign of Jesus's power
[10:06] but then he was to die again
[10:09] but then Jesus died afterwards rose
[10:12] again and the Bible calls him the
[10:14] firstborn from the dead Hallelujah in
[10:16] other words he's the first sinless man
[10:19] to die and be raised again Hallelujah
[10:22] Moses had died and been resurrected God
[10:25] took his body
[10:27] but he was a sinful man
[10:29] right but Moses pointed to Jesus Christ
[10:31] amen Lazarus pointed to Jesus Christ
[10:34] amen they're all pointing to the Holy
[10:37] One he's the First Holy One to die and
[10:40] raise again never to die again
[10:42] Hallelujah
[10:44] and become the hero of Heaven praise God
[10:47] Hallelujah to become Heaven's high
[10:49] priest Hallelujah that was not Moses
[10:51] that was not Elijah that was not Enoch
[10:53] they're not Heaven's High priests Mary's
[10:56] not Heaven's High Priestess but Jesus
[10:58] Christ is the firstborn from the dead he
[11:01] conquered death Church death doesn't
[11:02] have to shake us because the firstborn
[11:04] from the dead has conquered death
[11:07] amen
[11:08] that in all things he might have
[11:11] preeminence premise means the head it
[11:13] means the chief
[11:15] so he used to have I'm sorry Apprentice
[11:17] means the first the head is the chief
[11:20] The prominent the supreme leader Christ
[11:22] is the prominent one of the church
[11:25] right
[11:26] remember we know some have higher
[11:29] callings like prophets have higher
[11:30] callings so in one sense they have a
[11:32] higher calling but then the the Bible
[11:34] says Paul says that all preachers are
[11:37] the same
[11:38] we all plant we all water and Paul puts
[11:41] emphasis on Christ who gives the
[11:43] increase amen
[11:45] so we respect like brothers said we give
[11:47] honor to John the Baptist we give honor
[11:48] to the Elijah of our day but we don't
[11:50] worship them praise God because Christ
[11:53] is the head of all but the one who
[11:54] conquered death is the head of all those
[11:56] who had to die praise God Amen
[11:59] so Christ is the chief he's the
[12:03] preeminent one I love this quote I just
[12:04] it just came to me while I was studying
[12:05] this morning so I just I thought I'd
[12:06] share it again God shows a place of
[12:08] worship my friends I don't want to hurt
[12:10] your feelings but I'm responsible for a
[12:11] message and that message is come out of
[12:13] denominations
[12:15] and if I ask you to come out where am I
[12:17] going to take you would I take you to
[12:19] Branham Tabernacle it's just as much as
[12:20] fault as any of the rest of them so here
[12:23] brother Ram is emphasizing the baptism
[12:25] of the Holy Ghost
[12:27] and brother I'm saying a church of
[12:28] itself cannot save you how many people
[12:31] have we invited in here but the church
[12:32] itself doesn't save them
[12:35] as much as I want to save them as much
[12:38] as I want them to receive the truth I
[12:40] can't do it the church can't save them
[12:42] so brother is making a point here he's
[12:44] not doing away with Ephesians 4.
[12:46] we know the church will be perfected to
[12:48] the fivefold ministry but he's showing
[12:51] how we that every believer must come to
[12:54] the the Christ that the fifo ministry is
[12:56] preaching about
[12:58] and we can't make Branham Tabernacle we
[13:00] can't make bride of Christ Fellowship or
[13:02] Happy Valley or or Living Waters
[13:04] Tabernacle we can make no church an idol
[13:07] a church is a good place to go but
[13:09] listen church you can meet Jesus outside
[13:11] the church amen
[13:13] and like we look at tonight God wants to
[13:15] walk with you in the cool of the evening
[13:16] praise God that's my sermon for tonight
[13:18] the cool of the evening so
[13:20] I'm going to preach on that for the
[13:21] communion here
[13:22] just a simple message about walking with
[13:24] God
[13:25] uh but programs emphasize this whole
[13:28] sermon where did God choose to place his
[13:30] name he put it in Christ amen like we
[13:32] see with colossi churches rise churches
[13:34] fall churches can be burnt you know
[13:37] that's not the place of worship I mean
[13:39] it's one Gathering where we worship but
[13:41] we can worship at my house remember when
[13:43] the Holy Spirit fell when Sam was there
[13:45] Hallelujah on Labor Day Hallelujah see
[13:50] it's not so much a building it's where
[13:52] the Believers are amen hallelujah thank
[13:55] God God does visit our Sanctuary here
[13:57] thank God he does visit but it's where
[13:59] God's chosen place of worship is where
[14:01] the holy spirit is where you and I are
[14:03] believing and trusting in Christ
[14:07] he said so anyway in other words our
[14:09] church is just as much fault as any
[14:10] other Church
[14:13] he said if I'm going to point you to
[14:14] somewhere where am I going to take you
[14:15] he said but there's one place I can take
[14:17] you where you're safe and protected from
[14:19] Death that's in Jesus Christ
[14:22] God's place of worship and that's the
[14:24] place I'm introducing to you tonight
[14:26] where God put his name
[14:28] where he promised he would meet every
[14:31] person that come in there he would
[14:32] worship with him and feast with him
[14:34] that's in Christ not in no church no
[14:36] Tabernacle but in Christ he is God's
[14:39] Tabernacle
[14:40] amen thank God he's the place that God
[14:43] came into himself and dwelled in him
[14:46] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[14:47] pleased to dwell that is where God
[14:50] Tabernacle brought his name and placed
[14:52] it Upon Jesus Christ therefore his name
[14:54] was putting a man his son Jesus Christ
[14:56] in which he tabernacled himself and in
[14:59] that Tabernacle amen
[15:02] so now we can see here uh Christ is the
[15:05] head of the body Christ is the one we
[15:07] always point to yes we want them to come
[15:09] to church if if they love Jesus they
[15:12] will come to church praise God but the
[15:14] church building itself is not the place
[15:16] where we point them we point them to a
[15:19] relationship with Jesus Christ
[15:21] in other words I was waiting I remember
[15:23] I told you about that man who asked me
[15:24] last week I saw him again this week and
[15:25] I said hey have you thought about the
[15:27] Bible
[15:28] and he's like no I've been so busy I
[15:29] said well let me tell you I said let me
[15:31] tell you before I leave here Jesus
[15:33] Christ is the greatest thing that ever
[15:34] happened in my life
[15:35] there's another woman listening to us
[15:37] she looked up and smiled at me
[15:39] I said he saved my soul he forgives
[15:40] every sin he changed me from a sinner to
[15:43] a saint
[15:44] that he just kept his head down like
[15:46] that it was so sad but I'm praying for
[15:48] him praise God I hope I see him again
[15:49] I've seen him twice maybe I'll see him
[15:51] three times
[15:52] uh but but that's the reality that's
[15:55] what I got to point into
[15:56] I got appointment with Jesus Christ
[15:58] praise God he's the one that saved my
[16:00] life he's the one that uh rescued me
[16:02] from my sins praise God he's my head
[16:05] he's my chief he's my leader praise God
[16:08] he's the one that I'm looking to every
[16:10] day praise God
[16:11] he's the head of the church Hallelujah
[16:14] and he's the beginning the firstborn
[16:16] from the dead that in all things he
[16:18] might have the preeminence the first
[16:19] place he holds first place in our lives
[16:24] so because he's the beginning because
[16:26] he's the firstborn from the dead because
[16:28] he's all these firsts Hallelujah alpha
[16:31] and omega beginning in the end the first
[16:32] and the last Hallelujah that which was
[16:34] is and is to come because he's all
[16:36] things he must hold first place in our
[16:38] lives
[16:39] and of course he does by the grace of
[16:41] God
[16:42] I love this quote this this scripture
[16:44] always takes me back to this quote this
[16:46] the sermon
[16:47] he is the thing he was the prophets he
[16:49] was in them he was in the Psalms he was
[16:52] in history he's in things to come the
[16:54] same yesterday today and forever Hebrews
[16:56] 13 8 if you're writing it down think
[16:58] God's written in our hearts amen he
[17:00] should be then he should be the
[17:01] Principal if that's what he is and we
[17:04] believe it don't we then if he's that
[17:06] then he should be the Principal theme of
[17:08] our talking
[17:09] so see in every conversation we have we
[17:12] should try to bring it back to Christ
[17:14] he should be the Principal theme of our
[17:16] thinking of our singing of our walks
[17:19] with God
[17:21] he should be the Principal theme of our
[17:23] life if he's the principal theme of The
[17:25] Bible and the Bible is in us how many
[17:28] got the Bible in you
[17:29] then he should be the Principal theme of
[17:31] everything that we do say or think
[17:33] should be Christ is that right
[17:36] I love that quote that's just beautiful
[17:38] see preeminence he's the first he holds
[17:41] first place in everything we do
[17:43] the reason I preach is to honor Christ
[17:47] the reason I go to work is to honor
[17:49] Christ
[17:50] Hallelujah the reason I I come here to
[17:53] the church's study is to honor Christ
[17:55] the reason I give money away the reason
[17:57] I I help the poor is to honor Christ
[18:00] the reason you pray and sing is to honor
[18:03] Christ praise God yes it benefits you
[18:06] yes if it refreshes your spirit yes it
[18:08] makes you joyful but the reason I do it
[18:10] is to honor Jesus amen
[18:13] he holds first place in everything
[18:16] verse 19. now I want to bring a little
[18:19] bit of understanding for this one for
[18:20] please the father that in him should all
[18:23] fullness dwell
[18:25] now church I believe what I want to try
[18:27] to emphasize here is
[18:28] God's spirit did not leave heaven when
[18:31] Jesus was on Earth
[18:34] so all the fullness means all the
[18:36] authority
[18:38] okay some people think heaven was
[18:40] bankrupt when Christ was on Earth
[18:43] that's the case then Jesus was deceiving
[18:45] us when he said Our Father Who Art in
[18:47] Heaven right
[18:50] see Heaven could not have been bankrupt
[18:52] the the truth we need to understand is
[18:55] that God cannot be limited amen
[18:57] he's infinite praise God
[19:00] so all God put all of his authority and
[19:02] he put all the all the power of Heaven
[19:05] in one man
[19:07] Jesus Christ we have a measure we have a
[19:10] small portion thank God for a small
[19:12] portion praise God because Jesus said
[19:13] even with a small Faith the size of a
[19:16] mustard seed amen
[19:17] the the Bible said that kind of faith
[19:19] can move mountains Hallelujah
[19:22] so Jesus had more than a Mustard Seed
[19:24] Faith he had all the faith right he had
[19:26] because he was holy praise God and He
[19:28] waited on God to speak anything that's
[19:30] how we should do it as well praise God
[19:33] but this means all the authority of the
[19:35] of God dwelt in Christ
[19:38] everything was subject unto him he said
[19:40] I can get 12 Legions of angels if I want
[19:43] and he did so much they couldn't even
[19:45] write about it in fact this whole world
[19:47] could be filled with books about all the
[19:49] things Jesus did in three and a half
[19:51] years of ministry praise God that's my
[19:54] king amen that's my chief that's my
[19:57] supreme ruler that's my head amen he's
[20:00] the head of me in this church amen
[20:03] Jesus Christ because he had all the
[20:06] fullness of the godhead in his body
[20:08] praise God
[20:09] can you imagine that church we're going
[20:11] to be shocked for ages in heaven well he
[20:14] did this too and that too and this too
[20:16] and I imagine it'll be traced on all the
[20:18] way down to our relatives you know and
[20:20] everything all about hundreds and
[20:22] thousands of years all that Jesus did
[20:24] and will just be in awe will just be
[20:27] praising him and loving him and giving
[20:28] Glory ages Without End praise God oh
[20:33] Hallelujah just more of the same that he
[20:35] always did praise God more of the same
[20:38] because remember his soul was sealed
[20:40] Jesus Soul was sealed according to John
[20:42] 6 27 so he had the seal or the mark of
[20:44] the Holy Spirit and his soul
[20:46] but God's spirit was also in heaven he
[20:49] said let it be done on Earth I'm sorry
[20:51] Our Father Who Art in Heaven Jesus
[20:53] prayed obviously he looked up to heaven
[20:55] when he thanked uh when you thank God uh
[20:58] uh that their names are written in
[20:59] heaven praise God and then he also thank
[21:01] God when Lazarus was going to get healed
[21:03] and raised from the dead he looked up to
[21:05] heaven he looked to God
[21:06] so he had all the all the fullness in
[21:09] him yet God was still up in heaven
[21:12] that's a mystery that's what he said
[21:13] that's what he told in John The Book of
[21:15] John he said he said what if you see the
[21:16] son of man Ascend up where he is right
[21:18] now
[21:19] Hallelujah is that right that's what he
[21:22] told him he said the son of man is now
[21:24] in heaven and he's on Earth as well he's
[21:26] talking about the spirit praise God
[21:29] the spirit of God
[21:31] in him is also in heaven now
[21:34] amen what if you shall see him Ascend up
[21:37] where he was before praise God
[21:39] oh it's that omnipresence gonna say like
[21:42] that I'm the presence of God
[21:45] Glory
[21:47] Colossians 1 verse 20 we're slowly
[21:48] working I love preaching verse five
[21:50] words I just I feel like I get to know
[21:51] the Bible so much more when I preach it
[21:53] uh and having made peace through the
[21:56] blood of his cross
[21:59] by him by Christ to reconcile all things
[22:03] unto himself
[22:05] by him I say whether they be things in
[22:07] Earth or in heaven
[22:10] Hallelujah so whether you're in heaven
[22:12] if you die to go beyond or you're on
[22:15] Earth the Bible says the blood of Jesus
[22:17] Christ has reconciled you to God Amen
[22:22] Hallelujah we don't have to worry about
[22:23] you know Devils pulling us down to Hell
[22:25] or tormenting or anything like that we
[22:28] don't have to worry about that the blood
[22:29] of Jesus has already reconciled us to
[22:31] God hallelujah
[22:33] amen we know what to expect Hallelujah
[22:36] that's what Jeremiah 29 said Hallelujah
[22:39] I know the plans I have for you I get I
[22:41] come to give you a future praise God
[22:43] that you may have an expected end
[22:45] Hallelujah I know when I close my eyes
[22:48] and death of the Lord's Aries for that
[22:50] final time I know the next thing I'll
[22:52] see is the Holy Angels amen
[22:54] Hallelujah I see Heaven breaking forth
[22:57] because the blood did that for me I
[23:00] couldn't do it I wasn't worthy of it
[23:02] Christ did that for me Christ gave me
[23:04] peace Christ gave me an expected End
[23:06] Amen
[23:08] Hallelujah no man will brag Hallelujah
[23:10] no man will boast no woman will boast
[23:12] praise God but we'll be boasting in the
[23:15] cross amen
[23:17] Glory
[23:18] I'm going to be boasted in Jesus all
[23:21] that he did Hallelujah
[23:22] all they did was surrender it opened my
[23:24] heart to him
[23:26] now see the blood makes peace I love
[23:29] this verse I hope this verse is always
[23:30] my testimony Romans 3 25 I don't have it
[23:33] on the slide I just want to read it
[23:36] so many people say oh we're saved by
[23:37] grace Say by grace through faith that's
[23:39] true but it's faith in the blood and see
[23:42] that's what the devil does in these
[23:43] denominational churches they take out
[23:45] the blood
[23:46] right but we're putting the blood back
[23:48] in amen
[23:50] they take out the blood that means they
[23:51] take out the Holy Spirit we're putting
[23:52] the Holy Spirit back in we're putting
[23:54] the blood back in amen
[23:56] I was never told that in denomination by
[23:58] William they'd always say you're saved
[23:59] by faith you're saved by faith I might
[24:00] well praise God praise God when I read
[24:02] the Bible later I'm saved by faith in
[24:04] the blood praise God
[24:07] hallelujah it's the blood that we're
[24:09] saved by
[24:10] Romans 3 25.
[24:13] well we got to read 24. look at this is
[24:15] So Glorious being justified freely it
[24:18] was free by the amen
[24:20] free gift
[24:22] he declared you righteous freely
[24:25] you didn't pay for it
[24:27] you didn't buy it it was given to you
[24:30] ah by what his grace
[24:34] freely given by unmerited favor God did
[24:36] you a favor
[24:38] anybody ever did you a favor you're like
[24:39] I really appreciate that oh that was
[24:42] thank you I didn't earn it I don't I
[24:45] didn't earn it I don't deserve it the
[24:46] precious love of God that sounds kind of
[24:48] a man
[24:49] right now oh it's a it's a it's an
[24:50] unmerited favor
[24:52] it was right on time I really needed
[24:54] that that was such a blessing I didn't
[24:56] deserve it I didn't ask you for it but
[24:58] you did it and that's what God did for
[25:00] us he gave us the blood of his dear son
[25:03] hmm
[25:05] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[25:07] Jesus whom God has set forth to be a
[25:09] propitiation through faith in his blood
[25:12] to declare his righteousness for the
[25:14] remission of sins that are passed
[25:16] through the forbearance of God a lot of
[25:18] big words in there Hallelujah I love
[25:20] that word perpetuation almost every
[25:21] Easter I go back over that it means a
[25:24] propitiary sacrifice praise God in the
[25:27] place of appropriation praise God that
[25:30] which
[25:30] perpetuates Hallelujah
[25:33] it's a mercy seat that which acts as a
[25:36] mercy seat so the blood of Jesus Christ
[25:39] acts as a mercy seat hallelujah it's a
[25:42] it's a mercy see that covers over uh the
[25:46] ark of the covenant it's a it's a
[25:48] landing place for the blood Hallelujah
[25:50] it closed off the judgments of the law
[25:52] it covered the judgments of the law
[25:54] praise God and when blood was received
[25:57] there then mercy was given and then God
[26:00] spoke from that Mercy Seat amen oh see
[26:03] that's that's how you know God speaks to
[26:04] you praise God because you're trusting
[26:06] in the blood amen
[26:07] Hallelujah that's how you know
[26:10] I'm trusting in the blood of Jesus
[26:11] Christ not my righteousness I'm trusting
[26:14] in his blood and therefore if I'm
[26:15] trusting in his blood it's been received
[26:17] in heaven and now God can talk to me
[26:21] that's what he told Aaron he said I'll
[26:23] meet you in there amen take the Blood
[26:26] start in the out of the court and take
[26:27] the blood anoint every part and I'll
[26:29] meet you in there if you can just come
[26:31] and buy the blood if you can just have a
[26:33] sacrifice I will talk to you but you've
[26:35] got to come through the blood
[26:37] oh I love that amen and we've got blood
[26:40] today Church
[26:41] the blood of Jesus Christ
[26:45] so what what does the blood do brother
[26:46] sister it reconciles you
[26:49] it brings you back into harmony with God
[26:53] now since we've been born we've never we
[26:55] started out as enemies with God how many
[26:57] know that
[26:58] child's born few days full of Trouble
[27:01] full of lies
[27:03] so how did they bring us back it brings
[27:05] us back to the place where God foreknew
[27:07] us it brings us back to that sinless
[27:09] state where God knew us in his mind
[27:13] Hallelujah
[27:14] see we get that Harmony Back so God has
[27:17] harmony with the sauce we thought we saw
[27:19] that a few weeks ago God has fellowship
[27:21] with his manifested thoughts
[27:23] when his thoughts get manifested in
[27:25] flesh or in theophany then he can have
[27:27] Battleship with them
[27:28] yeah that's a deep thought right there
[27:29] I'm not going to go too far on that
[27:31] that's pretty deep I don't even know if
[27:32] I can handle that so
[27:34] it brings us back the blood reconciles
[27:37] us praise God this which is why our
[27:40] faith must be in the blood it brings
[27:42] back Harmony it brings back peace with
[27:45] God
[27:47] so I don't want to fight against God
[27:49] you don't want to fight against God
[27:51] we want peace with God
[27:53] Hallelujah
[27:55] Colossians 1 21 and you that were
[27:57] sometime alienated
[28:00] and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works
[28:03] yet now hath he reconciled a church all
[28:06] of us at one point were aliens to Christ
[28:10] we were enemies against Christ because
[28:13] of our Wicked thoughts and our Wicked
[28:15] works
[28:16] we all fought against the system we all
[28:19] fought against the blood imagine that my
[28:21] we all fought against forgiveness we all
[28:23] fought against Holiness but when we came
[28:26] to Christ then Jesus reconciled us when
[28:29] we had faith in his blood he brought us
[28:31] back to our former State again amen
[28:34] oh it's beautiful
[28:36] now remember this is right at the
[28:38] godhead Paul teaches the godhead and
[28:40] then he brings in here you fought
[28:41] against God but now God has brought you
[28:43] back in
[28:45] you are an alien to the covenants you
[28:47] were an alien to the promises you knew
[28:49] nothing about him you had War you were
[28:51] warning you were waging a war against
[28:53] the god of heaven but the god of Heaven
[28:55] in his kindness showed you his Mercy
[28:58] brought you to a place where you could
[28:59] recognize the cross and now you have
[29:01] peace with him and now you're reckon's
[29:03] out and now you're a son and daughter
[29:05] again as he saw you in his mind amen
[29:08] oh Hallelujah
[29:10] that's beautiful
[29:12] I'm not God's enemy and I'm not an alien
[29:15] to the things of God
[29:16] I'm a fellow receiver praise God I'm a
[29:20] recipient I'm a part of the family of
[29:22] God
[29:22] Hallelujah hold on Amen I've been laid
[29:25] here for two thousand years amen it's
[29:28] still fresh today it's just as fresh
[29:30] today as when Paul pended in that dirty
[29:32] prison Hallelujah just as fresh today
[29:37] how do you do this church how do you
[29:38] bring us into reconciliation in the body
[29:41] of his flesh through death
[29:45] so Jesus's death of his fleshly body
[29:49] reconciles us when it died when that
[29:51] Holy body died it brought Harmony
[29:54] between us and God
[29:56] and then I love this then he presents
[29:59] you
[30:00] remember
[30:01] this is it seems like it's going to go
[30:03] like this brother and tell us in the
[30:04] church age but he said the church H
[30:06] messenger each one will present their
[30:09] bride to Christ
[30:11] right and then Christ will present his
[30:14] bride to his father
[30:16] Hallelujah
[30:18] right because Jesus presents us holy and
[30:22] unblameable and unrebrewable in his
[30:25] sight
[30:26] oh my that was something
[30:28] Hallelujah
[30:30] so brother Ram will present his his
[30:33] elect from the laodicean church age
[30:35] he'll present Lord Jesus here's your
[30:37] bride that your word has has uh has has
[30:42] received this is this is the bride that
[30:44] your word produced for this age Lord
[30:47] these are the Overcomers this is your
[30:49] wife who was washed in the waters of
[30:52] your word amen for this generation so
[30:54] will Martin Luther say the same thing
[30:56] so will Paul Hallelujah so say Jesus
[30:59] even this is your bride even those
[31:01] Corinthians who are all about gifts and
[31:03] you know and emotion
[31:04] Hallelujah even those Galatians have
[31:07] brought legalism back in you forgave
[31:08] them and you baptized them with the Holy
[31:10] Ghost eventually right because the Bible
[31:12] says Jesus Christ will make you a chaste
[31:15] virgin under Christ amen
[31:17] none of us are spiritual versions of
[31:19] Christ because we all sin but that's
[31:21] what Jesus blood does it makes us
[31:23] spotless amen it makes us holy it makes
[31:26] us unblameable unreprovable you cannot
[31:29] put a blame on Jesus bride because of
[31:32] the blood amen
[31:34] glory amen
[31:36] because the blood reconciled me
[31:39] brought me in harmony
[31:41] and this is not future this is present
[31:45] and the church said
[31:47] this is not a future he hath he already
[31:49] did it praise God
[31:51] he's already he's going to be he's
[31:53] presenting you holy and unbelievable in
[31:56] his sight it was done through the cross
[31:58] amen
[32:00] again just like job I'm gonna get there
[32:02] in a minute job God's looking at you
[32:03] like a perfect work amen
[32:06] in heaven God sees you as a finished
[32:09] product he's got Harmony Hallelujah with

[32:18] you to be Hallelujah
[32:20] Hallelujah my buddy uh Jacob that we do
[32:23] Bible Club he brought in a piece of blue
[32:24] uh
[32:26] a piece of blue Play-Doh on Friday for
[32:28] our Bible Club lesson and he started
[32:30] he's like he's like God is like the
[32:32] Potter I may preach on the Potter
[32:33] because this kind of inspired me I might
[32:34] bring a piece of clay in here you know
[32:36] let the kids play around
[32:38] but he brought this piece of clay and he
[32:39] was talking about how God you know
[32:41] forgives us anoint us and he said and
[32:43] gods are shaping us and then he formed
[32:45] this blue heart
[32:46] and he come and brought it over he he
[32:48] brought it right by me while he's kind
[32:50] of teaching he kind of left the stage
[32:51] and come over here he said that's what
[32:53] God did for Jesse God formed Jesse's
[32:55] heart or Mr Smith's heart he calls me
[32:57] and he said he he formed him and he
[33:00] wouldn't leave him the way that he was
[33:02] amen
[33:03] he wouldn't leave my heart in the old
[33:04] wretched condition the the shapeless
[33:07] condition that it was but God formed the
[33:09] Potter took the clay took the heart of
[33:11] Mr Smith and formed it to how it should
[33:14] be Hallelujah that's what God is doing
[33:16] in our lives right now he's constantly
[33:18] forming us he's shaping us into a more
[33:21] perfect a more complete a more mature
[33:24] Christian
[33:26] he's the one forming it praise God
[33:28] you're his vessel amen hallelujah praise
[33:32] God you are his he's keeping you alive
[33:35] he's sustaining you you're consisting
[33:37] through this end of 2022 because of
[33:40] Jesus Christ
[33:42] I'm here because of Christ
[33:44] he sustained my life
[33:48] how does he do this
[33:49] through the blood
[33:51] Jesus calls you holy look at these three
[33:54] this is three
[33:55] three's completion right he calls you
[33:58] holy unblameable and unreprovable
[34:01] in his sight
[34:04] I'll never be that in my sight until I
[34:06] get a new body by the way
[34:07] once I got a new body system helmet then
[34:09] I'll be holy
[34:10] brother Jose then I'll be able to say I
[34:13] got a new body okay I'm blameless now
[34:15] I I don't have nose no more sin nature
[34:18] no more no more sadness Hallelujah no
[34:22] hard depression Hallelujah no more lust
[34:25] and no more greed no more now I'm holy
[34:28] Hallelujah I got a I'm a brand new
[34:30] creation I'm a brand new man Hallelujah
[34:32] Hallelujah
[34:34] but till then I can't say it because
[34:36] it's not in my sight but it's in God's
[34:38] sight
[34:40] now I can say I am in God's sight but I
[34:42] can't say in my sight
[34:44] Charleston why do I wake up every day
[34:46] feeling bad or discouraged you know why
[34:48] they got a battle every day because it's
[34:49] not about my sight it's about his sight
[34:53] right
[34:54] now I want to bring this out here
[34:55] remember this I preached this last
[34:57] Easter for the life of the flesh is in
[34:59] the blood and I've given it to you upon
[35:01] the altar to make an atonement for your
[35:03] souls
[35:05] for it is the blood that maketh
[35:06] atonement for the soul so when Jesus
[35:08] shed his blood it atoned our souls
[35:13] his life pardons our life it was life
[35:16] for life
[35:18] Hallelujah
[35:20] and it was the opposite of punishment
[35:21] punishment was eye for an eye if you
[35:24] poke somebody's eye out your eye gets
[35:26] poked out
[35:27] if you break somebody's tooth your tooth
[35:29] gets broken if you kill somebody you get
[35:31] killed the punishment was eye for eye
[35:34] but the sacrifice shows the sacrificial
[35:36] system that was the system of punishment
[35:38] but the system of Pardon works the same
[35:41] amen hallelujah it was life for Life
[35:44] praise God Jesus died so I can live amen
[35:48] Hallelujah just was just as punishment
[35:50] was eye for eye so is pardon eye for eye
[35:53] it's life or life amen hallelujah it's
[35:56] his grace given to me all my sins on him
[35:59] but then all his righteousness on us
[36:01] hallelujah
[36:02] oh it's beautiful
[36:05] blood has always been the atonement the
[36:07] perpetuation The Mercy Seat for our
[36:10] souls
[36:11] and it was no different with Jesus blood
[36:12] in fact it was greater
[36:16] yes much greater praise God because the
[36:20] life is in the blood and the blood
[36:22] redeems the soul
[36:26] now here's the Greek words Jesus calls
[36:28] you holy which holy means the most holy
[36:30] thing a separated thing
[36:33] remember this is in his sight so Jesus
[36:35] looks at you when you're forgiven
[36:36] and he says you are except you are a
[36:39] most separated thing
[36:41] it's kind of like the holiest of holies
[36:42] you know you are the most separated
[36:45] thing aren't we Church we're the most
[36:47] holy people on Earth by the blood of
[36:48] Christ
[36:50] like I told you last week these guys
[36:51] that leave the message they get into
[36:52] Dracula they get into horror movies and
[36:54] murder movies and all kinds of they love
[36:57] that that's because they love the things
[36:58] of the world
[37:00] but we are spiritually and naturally
[37:03] we're supposed to be the most holy
[37:05] people separated set apart God help us
[37:08] God will forgive us when we fall short
[37:10] right but our our pattern our habits our
[37:13] direction is Holy Holy Holy unto the
[37:16] Lord amen
[37:18] we're constantly progressing in more
[37:20] Holiness praise God we're growing in the
[37:22] grace of God hallelujah
[37:26] oh it's a blessing praise God
[37:28] so Jesus looks at you and he says you
[37:31] are a Most Holy person
[37:33] you are separated Beyond denomination oh
[37:36] thank God Amen you're separated Beyond
[37:39] Catholicism
[37:41] your life is way more separated than a
[37:43] Baptist
[37:44] the church said
[37:46] I used to be a pretty good Baptist yeah
[37:47] I at least listen to the bachelor's
[37:48] preachers I enjoyed them
[37:50] I wouldn't go to actually just about to
[37:52] church but I like the Baptist preaching
[37:54] but now I'm more separated than I was
[37:56] then
[37:58] it's because of the blood of Christ the
[38:00] Holy Spirit working in my life so not
[38:03] only are you holy you are unblameable
[38:06] which means you have no blemish
[38:10] like when you buy a brand new shirt at
[38:11] the store right there's not one mark on
[38:13] it
[38:15] you think oh my goodness if only I could
[38:16] keep it this good like I'll go as long
[38:18] as I can without washing a shirt because
[38:19] I want to just just be nice
[38:21] no marks
[38:23] no stains I'll be real careful oh
[38:25] lasagna can't hold you now let's wipe
[38:27] your hands you got peanut butter all
[38:28] over your hands I just got my brand new
[38:29] shirt on
[38:31] all right
[38:32] without blemish
[38:34] free from fault
[38:36] unblameable
[38:39] that's Jesus sees you no faults amen
[38:43] just like Paul said when you walk in
[38:45] this mirror there is no not some
[38:48] condemnation there is no condemnation
[38:52] there's no condemnation to them now they
[38:55] are in Christ Jesus who walk after the
[38:57] spirit and not after the flesh
[39:01] that's his sight looking at you brother
[39:03] and sister
[39:04] You Are Holy you are unblameable
[39:09] I like this last one unreprovable
[39:13] so you are separate you're the most
[39:15] separated people on the Earth from sin
[39:18] you have no Faults and you cannot be
[39:21] accused
[39:23] so if I looked at your clothes you had
[39:25] no Faults but then if I brought you
[39:27] before a judge the judge couldn't accuse
[39:29] you you haven't done anything wrong
[39:31] there's no Witnesses amen
[39:35] you can't be accused nobody can accuse
[39:37] you
[39:39] because all all your sin was placed on
[39:43] Jesus amen
[39:44] not just the sins you did before you
[39:46] became a Christian but the sins after he
[39:48] became a Christian praise God and not
[39:50] just your sins and my sins but the sins
[39:53] of the whole world Amen
[39:55] Hallelujah
[39:57] placed on one man on one Mercy Saint
[40:00] praise God
[40:01] and then all those who will receive it
[40:03] will receive this unmerited Grace praise
[40:05] God and they'll be brought into Covenant
[40:07] no longer alien no longer a stranger but
[40:10] a fellow citizen of the kingdom of God
[40:13] that's the gospel amen
[40:16] Hallelujah
[40:18] and these words have been laying here
[40:19] for two thousand years and yet we
[40:21] sometimes here see that's why we need
[40:22] these words we get discouraged we feel
[40:25] like we're we have faults
[40:27] we do it our flesh
[40:29] but not in his sight is that right
[40:31] that's the word of God
[40:34] well I see all my stains why this stain
[40:37] this week
[40:39] staying last week that stained the week
[40:42] before
[40:44] oh yeah that guy did witness my yeah I
[40:46] made that mistake at work I forgot yeah
[40:47] that guy did see it yeah and so we get
[40:50] discouraged but that's our sight
[40:53] God doesn't want us to think about our
[40:55] side yeah we have to confess in our
[40:56] sight but once we confess we understand
[40:59] we are forgiven and God is not judging
[41:02] us God is not God is not trying to warn
[41:05] us well you're going to go to hell the
[41:06] Bible says in his sight we're already
[41:08] holy he's going to present us holy
[41:11] unblameable unreprovable he's going to
[41:14] present himself abroad because nobody
[41:17] else could do it nobody else could wash
[41:18] his bride he himself had to wash his
[41:20] bride he's going to make sure his right
[41:22] is Holy unreprovable Hallelujah he's
[41:25] going to make sure she's holy that's
[41:26] what he's doing today he's washing us
[41:28] today praise God
[41:30] he's getting us ready praise God
[41:32] through the
[41:34] test of our life the trials of Our Lives
[41:36] he's making sure we'll be holy
[41:39] that's always my prayer Lord do anything
[41:41] in my life whatever it takes to keep me
[41:43] holy and filled with the Holy Ghost I
[41:45] know I can't lose myself but what I mean
[41:47] is keep my testimony
[41:48] I know you can't lose the seal the Holy
[41:50] Ghost but just keep me so close just
[41:52] keep me close to the side of my savior
[41:54] and God may I never in darkness Rove
[41:57] keep my path free from free from wrath
[41:59] and keep my soul satisfied feel my way

[42:11] a smile
[42:12] feel my way every day we might have to
[42:14] sing that buddy
[42:15] feel my way every day with love
[42:18] Hallelujah
[42:20] thank you Jesus
[42:22] that's so that's how God sees you but
[42:24] amen you're holy unblameable
[42:26] unreprovable
[42:27] sister who else so you know that's how
[42:29] God sees you holy unblameable
[42:31] unreprovable
[42:33] nobody can find a fault nobody can even
[42:35] speak a word against you but Austin in
[42:37] heaven
[42:39] that's what the Bible says he's going to
[42:42] bring through and what did that the
[42:43] cross did that
[42:45] it wasn't your fastings it wasn't your
[42:47] arms although I believe you know I
[42:49] preached those hard I believe that
[42:51] fasting praying and giving of all I
[42:54] believe in that but that's not how he
[42:56] did it it was through the cross
[42:58] it was the blood of Jesus Christ and out
[43:01] of your appreciation for that yes then
[43:03] you surrender you you give up a couple
[43:04] meals I think about your just a couple
[43:06] meals you're only giving up a couple
[43:08] meals it's not like you're fasting for
[43:09] four years or something like that
[43:11] I mean you can just give up a couple
[43:12] meals a week Hallelujah Pharisees did
[43:14] too I mean we could at least do a couple
[43:16] Wheels a week right it's not going to be
[43:19] by our ability it's by God's ability
[43:21] it's through God's sacrifice the blood
[43:24] purges our souls the blood purchased our
[43:27] souls the blood made atonement we are
[43:29] reconciled we belong to him amen
[43:33] Gloria
[43:35] unaccused there is no one to accuse you
[43:38] in heaven
[43:42] now how's this done it's simply through
[43:44] acknowledging your sin remember brother
[43:46] Jim preached this one I was praying this
[43:48] morning I'm like that's right
[43:49] was praying I'm like yes I saw my notes
[43:51] in my mind so see I'm a visual learner I
[43:54] like let me look up this up the
[43:55] something on my phone
[43:57] see all David did I acknowledged my sin
[44:00] and my iniquity have I not hit just
[44:01] don't hide anything from God
[44:04] just be honest with God and then I said
[44:06] I will confess my transgressions unto
[44:08] the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity
[44:10] of my sin let me pause and meditate on
[44:13] that Hallelujah
[44:16] that's all we have to do Church don't
[44:18] hide anything from God Amen my brother
[44:19] said let that he preached a door and a
[44:21] door every door in your life every every
[44:23] situation in your life Let Jesus into
[44:26] that situation
[44:28] open open that situation up whether it's
[44:30] you know relationships or finances
[44:32] always say Jesus come on in I need to
[44:34] talk with you praise God
[44:36] every area of my life oh I'm opening all
[44:39] these doors come into my entire life I'm
[44:42] not hiding anything Lord my life is an
[44:44] open book come in and sup with me praise
[44:46] God
[44:47] so you talk about communion Hallelujah
[44:50] because he's another good Old Testament
[44:52] and New Testament we can't say it's
[44:53] different it's the same
[44:55] we confess our sins he's faithful and
[44:57] just to forgive us our sins
[44:58] and they cleanse us from all
[45:00] unrighteousness
[45:02] everybody say oh can we oh as long as
[45:05] you say Lord
[45:08] Lord it was my sin
[45:11] don't say the devil made me do it no you
[45:13] didn't I didn't I did it was my sin
[45:16] because my unbelief in that moment
[45:18] as long as you say it's mine and forgive
[45:20] me then the Bible said he will forgive
[45:22] all unrighteousness
[45:25] and that's the power
[45:27] of the pardon hallelujah hallelujah I
[45:30] for iTunes for truth life for life
[45:33] Hallelujah
[45:34] and then he cleanses you from all our
[45:37] righteousness see the cleansing Waters
[45:39] just saying I'm sorry just saying Lord
[45:41] that was my fault that's actually the
[45:42] cleansing work of the Holy Spirit
[45:46] Forgive Me Lord
[45:48] and then I said
[45:50] I said you forgave me
[45:52] I said I confess and then I said he
[45:54] forgave me that's what I say that's what
[45:57] you say that's got to be our confession
[45:59] I confess and that I believe I'm
[46:01] forgiven praise God
[46:03] it has to be
[46:05] that that's God's system it has to work
[46:09] Glory
[46:12] now this made me think a joke so I'm
[46:13] going to go back to this great sermon I
[46:15] felt like God gave me a greater
[46:16] Revelation a couple years ago I'm just
[46:17] going to bring back a couple of thoughts
[46:19] the Bible said job was in Job 1 1 he was
[46:21] perfect and upright one that feared God
[46:24] and has skewed evil so he was he had
[46:26] integrity
[46:28] which means
[46:30] he tried to live to as honest as he
[46:33] could to God
[46:35] he took responsibility for his wrongs
[46:37] and he confessed them
[46:40] okay
[46:41] doesn't mean he never sinned right
[46:45] now the word upright he was perfect he
[46:47] was he had Integrity he was upright
[46:49] which means he was straight correct
[46:51] now church this could mean too he was
[46:53] correct in saying I'm wrong
[46:55] we should be correct on saying I'm wrong
[46:58] don't miss that be correct and say Lord
[47:00] it was my fault it was my sin it wasn't
[47:02] the devil's fault you allowed him to
[47:04] come it was my fault
[47:06] just be upright be correct just judge
[47:09] the situation right that it was me it
[47:11] was my fault I gave in to my sinful
[47:13] nature
[47:15] see
[47:16] perfect and upright
[47:19] he was correct
[47:21] and he feared God so he was he was
[47:23] afraid of God in other words he had he
[47:25] had healthy respect for God
[47:27] a healthy reverence
[47:30] and this is the one I love he has scooty
[47:32] but I never seen it like this before
[47:33] until today
[47:34] he is skewed evil which means he
[47:36] departed from that way
[47:38] so when Satan would offer him hey here's
[47:40] the evil way you could walk in this he
[47:42] would say no sir I'm going the other way
[47:45] or Satan just came right in front of him
[47:47] and said oh let me tell you about this
[47:48] he said get behind me Satan
[47:51] thou are an offense unto me
[47:54] does he say sees Church Satan offer you
[47:56] all these all these alternative routes
[47:58] they're called the permission will of
[48:00] God
[48:01] they'll say well if you do this I mean
[48:03] it might work out pretty good this way
[48:04] but but no we got to choose the right
[48:06] path when you Askew evil you depart from
[48:09] the wrong path and you choose the right
[48:11] path
[48:12] this is the kind of man job was Satan
[48:15] would present evil things but he would
[48:17] live above it he would he would go the
[48:19] other way he wouldn't follow Satan's
[48:21] paths he would walk in God's paths
[48:24] he rejected evil
[48:27] he put it aside amen hallelujah instead
[48:31] of holding on to sin he put it aside
[48:34] and that reminds you to lay aside every
[48:35] sin Hallelujah and any sin that easily
[48:38] besets us and run the race let's run the
[48:40] race with patience
[48:42] reject evil this makes you like job
[48:46] now this is one from my sermon a couple
[48:48] years ago
[48:50] job had a list of failures he had a list
[48:52] of good habits so should we
[48:54] right
[48:55] but he also
[48:57] he battled great fear about losing his
[49:00] family losing his children his money
[49:02] uh Eli who told job he had iniquity in
[49:05] his life
[49:06] see
[49:08] not uh yeah he was not just he had Pride
[49:10] he was at ease sometimes he got a little
[49:12] lazy on God
[49:14] church that we all get lazy on God
[49:16] sometimes
[49:17] but that's our side that's our side I'm
[49:19] trying to get us to see God's side amen
[49:21] hallelujah
[49:23] these are all true
[49:24] and the Bible said he was in Rebellion
[49:26] against God
[49:27] when he was saying I'm I'm righteous and
[49:29] God's not
[49:31] I'm actually the righteous one look
[49:32] that's what he said in job 32
[49:34] these these men could see it these three
[49:37] men could see that job was calling
[49:39] himself righteous
[49:40] and then Eli who comes and says
[49:43] uh job God's Wrath is kindled against
[49:45] you because I'm sorry Elijah whose wrath
[49:48] was against job because he justified
[49:49] himself rather than God did you see that
[49:51] the three friends were right on some
[49:53] things job was a little self-righteous
[49:57] sometimes church we get a little
[49:59] self-righteous praise God but see God's
[50:01] not looking at that Amen in God's side
[50:04] job was a perfect man amen
[50:06] and God brought job to this test to
[50:09] prove to the devil that he'll serve me
[50:10] because he loves me amen
[50:13] Hallelujah he don't serve me just for
[50:15] blessings he serves me because he loves
[50:16] me amen
[50:18] he wants Visions he wants the word of
[50:19] God and he caught that Vision My
[50:21] Redeemer liveth and I know I'll stand
[50:24] with him on the earth someday in this
[50:26] flesh I shall see God Amen
[50:29] in other words he wanted to be one of
[50:30] those Saints he wanted to be one of
[50:32] those redeemed he was looking for that
[50:34] he was a real believer he wanted to be
[50:36] with the Messiah so do we we'll be with
[50:38] him in the Rapture amen
[50:41] Hallelujah
[50:42] but was he human 100 percent
[50:45] 100 percent
[50:47] did he Askew Evil all the time not
[50:49] always
[50:51] I just told you where he didn't always
[50:52] ask you evil
[50:54] sometimes he let fear hang around too
[50:56] long
[50:58] sometimes he let self-righteousness and
[51:00] pride hang around a little too long
[51:03] and then in his greatest trial
[51:05] he even spoke against God
[51:07] but then God by his Mercy
[51:09] sent Elijah
[51:12] to bring him to humility
[51:13] and then even got himself come down to
[51:15] bring him to humility
[51:18] oh it's a beautiful story
[51:20] job knew he not sinned because he come
[51:22] upon the base of God's word now see
[51:24] brother let's talk about the sacrifice
[51:25] he come upon the bases of the shed blood
[51:27] knowing that God required a blood
[51:28] sacrifice and blood was what job offered
[51:31] knowing that God could not refuse it the
[51:33] whole picture is a perfect revelation
[51:36] God gave blood blood is an atonement for
[51:38] the soul so job knew I've sinned I've
[51:42] fallen short I've had fear all these
[51:43] things but he still brought blood and
[51:45] the blood was God's system it was life
[51:47] for life this life was given so my life
[51:50] could be redeemed amen it was life for
[51:53] life and job knew as long as I
[51:55] sacrificed as long as I confess my sins
[51:57] and call on God God will forgive me and
[52:00] God in heaven recognizes and says Satan
[52:02] he's perfect praise God he excuse evil
[52:05] because of the blood amen
[52:08] Hallelujah
[52:10] isn't that what the Bible says I
[52:12] preached us a few weeks ago
[52:14] the God of Peace
[52:16] who brought again from the dead our Lord
[52:18] Jesus Christ
[52:19] through the blood of the Everlasting
[52:21] Covenant make you perfect in every good
[52:22] work to do his will
[52:24] work in you that which is well pleasing
[52:26] the sight through Jesus Christ
[52:29] see the blood will make you come to make
[52:31] you perfect the blood of the Covenant
[52:32] will make you perfect
[52:34] Covenant is the oath or a promise God
[52:36] keeps his promise
[52:38] sometimes we don't keep our promises but
[52:39] God keeps his all the time
[52:41] Hallelujah for eternity
[52:43] God's promise that the blood will make
[52:45] you perfect cannot fail Hallelujah
[52:48] it will make you perfect for every good
[52:50] work in your life
[52:52] Church most of us are just getting
[52:53] started
[52:54] we're all saying you're 25.
[52:58] 17.
[53:00] for the name anyway
[53:02] just getting started
[53:05] Hallelujah
[53:07] just getting started God is going to do
[53:10] a great thing he's going to make you
[53:11] perfect for every good work in your life
[53:14] praise God
[53:15] Jose and brother William and I because
[53:17] some of those older ones can say Amen
[53:18] praise God God has made us
[53:21] you're yeah you're a young man that's
[53:23] right buddy that's right
[53:24] you're right
[53:28] Hallelujah yeah you're only as old as
[53:30] you say you are so
[53:33] but I'm sure those of us who've been
[53:34] around a little longer can see that God
[53:37] has made everything in our our life work
[53:39] together for good
[53:42] and if we really wanted we would there's
[53:44] very few things we'd really go back and
[53:45] change because we knew we got us I mean
[53:47] we had to sin somehow right we have
[53:48] we're not perfect we're going to make
[53:50] mistakes somehow I mean yeah we wish we
[53:51] could do that but then if we didn't do
[53:52] that we probably did something else
[53:55] so in other words we can look back with
[53:56] our lives brother Jose brother and
[53:58] William with no regrets because it was
[54:00] God's grace that brought us here as
[54:02] God's grace sustaining us as God's grace
[54:04] that'll take us home and the blood will
[54:06] do what the Covenant said it will do
[54:08] amen
[54:10] it's a promise
[54:11] it's a promise the blood will make you
[54:14] perfect the blood will make Jesus see
[54:16] you as holy unreprovable without rebuke
[54:19] in his sight amen
[54:21] because he's looking at you through the
[54:23] blood amen
[54:25] through your sacrifice just like he
[54:27] looked at job through the sacrifice
[54:28] God's promise cannot change God's God
[54:31] has never changed he's always looking at
[54:33] Believers through the blood Hallelujah
[54:36] just like Adam and Eve
[54:38] what's the first thing you did with Adam
[54:39] and Eve let me go kill some ghost kids
[54:41] but and then he cast him out he said but
[54:43] I'm going to bring you back in one day
[54:47] gonna bring him in praise God Hallelujah
[54:49] in the Millennium is going to bring him
[54:51] in Hallelujah
[54:52] future home he's going to bring him back
[54:54] into his presence
[54:55] Hallelujah
[54:58] because this is why God said have you
[54:59] considered job he's perfect and upright
[55:04] he's upright he excuse evil he always he
[55:08] will always depart from evil in other
[55:10] words eventually he'll depart from
[55:13] I know he's going to confess that he's
[55:15] going to make it right
[55:16] that's why God could call him perfect
[55:19] he excuse evil

[55:40] God In Prayer this did he continually
[55:43] Church what is it it's continual
[55:45] repentance you and I must continually
[55:47] spend time before the Throne of God

[56:20] because it's keeping the Covenant that
[56:23] God gave us
[56:26] recognizing I'm not perfect on Earth but

[57:45] Faith In The Blood redeems us
[57:48] buys us back purchase us back
[57:52] what is redemption it's the releasing of
[57:54] the payment
[57:55] the releasing
[57:56] of the punishment
[57:58] when you have trust in the blood it
[58:00] releases the punishment that you owed
[58:03] the payment that you owed which the
[58:04] wages of sin is what death
[58:06] that should be your wage the wages of
[58:07] sin is death
[58:09] for our sins the actual payment for that
[58:11] the check that we should receive for our
[58:13] sins is death but Jesus Took the death
[58:15] for us
[58:17] Jesus Took the payment for us
