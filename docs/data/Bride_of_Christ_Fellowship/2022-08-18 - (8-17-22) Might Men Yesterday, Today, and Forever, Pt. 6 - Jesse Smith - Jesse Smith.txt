========================================

17. thank you 13-17 i'll read all of them down and then we'll all read together on 17. so i'll read 13 out of 16 we'll read 17 together but evil men and seducers shall act worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a holy child from a child now has known the holy scriptures which are able to make me wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness let's read verse 17 together one two three that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen that's our word of prayer if you have need on your heart let's make another unto god here tonight we're not here in maine church you know there's a reason we're here and it's a great opportunity to show our love and devotion to jesus christ praise god in the midst of the busyness of life here so let's just bow our heads here father god in heaven we thank you again for tonight lord our thoughts are on heaven or what will it be when we get over yonder to join the throng upon the glassy sea lord and we want to crown you want us to we want to be there at that moment where you were crowned king of kings and lord of lords and father we're looking forward to that day what a great day lord it's our hope it's our living hope the scriptures say father god so we thank you god for that great promise and lord help us to live live today like you're risen as that song says lord worthy my song and lord just trust in you help us be mighty men and women and mighty children mighty in the scriptures lord that we can believe them quote them and obey them lord god just as we learn in jesus temptation the weakest christian just quoting the word of god can overcome satan every time any time any place anywhere so lord help us to quote the word stand behind the word and obey the word lord god we thank you for this opportunity bless each and every one that press out their way to the house of god thank you for these faithful saints lord minister to them by the holy spirit in jesus christ's name saint said amen god bless you to being seated praise god i never set my timer on sunday so i preached an hour and a half so i was actually trying to keep it in hour but thank you for your patience here so i want to finish this out maybe i can finish this series up by god's grace we looked at david a lot and looked at old testament mighty men and we looked at new testament mighty men and then we looked at paul's a mighty man last time we just looked at scriptures you can use to be mighty over different battles that you'll face and so we'll continue on that here tonight and these are scriptures that you'll learn i'll share the scripture that has really helped me many times when i've been discouraged and i wondered where's god or i'm doubting if i'm doubting in a certain situation i'll share the verse that i go to or i should say like this the verse is the holy ghost directly to you and i'll share brother branham's you might be surprised brother ham said he had a verse he always went to i don't know if you're i don't know if you're familiar with it but uh i was reminded that and i went and studied it out and uh he would always go to the book of romans he said whenever he got discouraged so uh this just means hopefully hopefully an uplifting sermon here i'm sorry i'm a little tired you know the other night i only got four hours of sleep i'm still trying to recover for that i just woke up and my mind was on i'm like okay i gotta get ready for school you know so just a little teeny bit tired you know but other than that we're doing okay by god's grace so the purpose again was to increase our faith in god and so he can work mightily in our lives and we don't want to miss god in the daily work that god is doing we're thankful for all the great testimonies and the miracles that god does but we also know god works in us mightily just to overcome our trials right and so uh we want god's word to work mightily in our daily lives praise god and so hopefully we're being able to use some of these scriptures and they're going to strengthen us you know when we need them the most that's what i'm trusting the holy spirit will bring all things to our remembrance praise god so paul told timothy your faith in the holy scriptures make you mighty and we know they make us mighty to overcome and so if you're ever feeling unseen by god here's a few verses that would encourage you to remember that god sees you okay humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care on him for he careth for you praise god so always remember that god cares for you and remember church you don't have to carry your burdens right you don't have to carry your cares you know i found i found it like this serving the lord for 20 some years now 22 years i found that i'm always going to have burdens i'm always going to have something i'm struggling with but i can either choose to care about it or i can cast it on the lord i found this though it's always going to be on my mind but i don't have to carry the stress of it i don't have to carry the worry of it like i know i've got certain bills i got to pay right you know i know i got this to take care of it i got to get that done before this certain day and i've got different things i got this meeting coming up with that brother who's sister that's upset with me you know or whatever i got this whatever phone call set up with this individual i realize though this the little bit of pressure is always going to be there but if i can have a good prayer meeting and if i can worship god and if i can have the holy spirit fall on me and anoint me afresh in some special way and i can get the joy of the lord back then it doesn't bother me as much because i've been able to cast the care of the lord for example i'm not caring about it i'm not worried about it it's going to be there i know i know i've got to approach it but it's not the same level of struggle praise god so that reminds me that i'm seen by god praise god god sees me because he says i'll take your care amen praise god in other words the whole time i'm struggling with stress god is saying give me that stress oh yeah why in other words if we were stressed out he'd be saying why are you stressed out give me your give me your problems i'll take care of your problems how do you can say amen to that right you know you you're always gonna have problems right some are more severe than others but god is literally saying you don't have to hold those problems i'll take care of those problems so i just thought if you feel like you're unseen remember he cares for you and he's asking you just give me those cares let me lighten that burden a little bit there you go the bible says we have light afflictions amen amen and we can't let these light afflictions feel too heavy we've got to have a way through prayer and remembering god he sees us he's looking on us we got to remember that that's what these services are for you come here and like i said i was tapping on this other side i'm going to tap on it again this is a place you can just leave it there praise god it's a great physical reminder that this is a place i can leave it there i gave it to god and i can walk away free i can walk away knowing that i don't have to care about it anymore god's gonna take care of it praise god and church how many can say amen that you know the times when you cast your care of the lord whatever the problem is it always works out and it's not as bad as what you thought it was gonna be right in most cases it's not as bad as what it's going to be so that means god sees you and he's saying why why would you struggle just give me that problem praise god because i care for you i'm going to help you through this this trial so this scripture has been a great blessing as you know you study and remember that god cares remember he can care because he became flesh that's right right jesus can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen praise god that means when you pray church and when we pray and ask god to help us god can feel the stress jesus knows what it's like i should say jesus can feel the stress the invisible spirit can't feel the stress but jesus's human body now glorified can still feel the stress amen praise god because he's got that human spirit he's got the human spirit he can be touched that means he can feel the affirmative affirmity that you're going through praise god that physical body praise god he knows he remembers what that's like and so we thank god that he wants to take our burdens and then but we've got to remember lord help me to cast them on you praise god amen oh this one was on my mind this morning too uh are not two sparrows sold for a farthing a farthing was just a fraction of a penny of course inflation has been huge since then and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father so god knows every bird that just passed away and laying out there on the ground right how many times my children found little birds and animals laying out there right they passed away i've seen a bird to summer oh poor bird passed away just a robin remember robin was out by uh out by our road i'm actually a one minute got hit by a car in other words even a robin that gets hit by a car god knew what happened to him god sees that in other words god's eyes are on his whole of his creation amen and jesus said but even greater than that the very hairs of your head are all numbered praise god he's got a certain account he knows in other words he knows every detail about you you are seen satan says you're not god doesn't see you he's you know you're too small but the bible said god does see and god does count your hairs amen in other words god counts your problems and god counts your breaths and he comes to everything he knows everything praise god and he cares so he said because i i know the number of your hairs don't fear fear not because you're more valuable than the spirit amen amen amen you mean more to me than the birds we love birds we love all nature but they don't have souls praise god but you've got a soul praise god if god god sent his son jesus to die to redeem your soul amen he sent jesus to pay the price for your sins so you don't have to pay for your sin you have to suffer for your sin the wages of your sin was death right in other words the payment what you deserve for your sins the wages of sin is dead you deserve death but jesus died for you so you don't have to die eternally amen he paid the wages right that you owe he paid your debt praise god he took your suffering upon you and then he says you are more valuable you meet you're more valuable than all the other nature all the other creation you're in my very image amen amen so don't fear praise god amen you're seen by god god sees you amen praise the lord you know just in my humble life course i was raised in america even in my poor state even when we had all those buckets collected in the rain the scripture tells me that god was thinking about me then amen god brought me through the hardest times praise god when i would uh nature every day i go to school i'd almost wear the same sweatpants every day we are that poor sometime i had these black sweatpants i love them but by the time i wore them about a year brother they had to hold them and i kind of got embarrassed you know but they're my favorite sweatpants i still remember those sweatpants they had like a school logo on the side and we just didn't have a whole lot of clothes you know even then i had six kids you know but even at my lowest god still knew all the errors on my head amen he still provided and he tells us don't fear because your value is great and as we as we thought as we prayed earlier our father who art in heaven hallowed be your name your father has a great view watching your life praise god he's got a view all the way up in heaven amen he's got a great view he can look down and see how there's some birds and there's a plant there's austin there's lena their sister naomi and our sister huh there's brother william i see all the children i'm watching over them i know all their hairs i know all their breasts i know everything about them and i'm gonna provide for them praise god there's nothing to fear because your father is watching over you praise god these are mighty these scriptures should make us mighty in our faith amen praise god not to fear because we're more valuable god knows about everything that falls everything that raises everything that grows god knows the number of all of it praise god so our lives are easily in this skate in this nail start hand praise god easily nothing to fear not a depression i know austin has a great testimony of overcoming depression i listened to that uh podcast last week great he said as soon as he got back the depression left praise god amen what a difference just being amongst christian makes praise god hallelujah being uh right where you're supposed to be like that song says right where i'm supposed to be praise god it uh brings you out of depression remember the greatest depression recorded in the bible was when jesus was in the garden of gethsemane that was the bible said he was very heavy if you click on that word heavy and the greek it means depression so no one ever suffered depression worse than jesus because he was so depressed he was sweating blood right and when was the last time you sweated blood because you were so depressed just never happened so the greatest amount of stress ever on an individual was jesus christ the weight of the world the sin of the whole world and think about that church i mean even he had the garden of e garden get somebody there sweating drops of blood and and remember uh not not too long before that moses and elijah visited him to speak of him of his deceased so he had heavenly visitations he had angel visitations he had the saints visit him he had all these visitations to prepare him and yet it was still the most stressful most depressing thing you could ever go through think about that to be left by god he was left by god he said my god my god why are you forsaking me so there could be no greater depression than being forsaken by god but yet jesus went through it and he did it with the right attitude the attitude [Applause] he sweat drops of blood in depression so i didn't have to praise god [Music] thank god he then he went through depression so we don't have to praise god he was depressed so you could be set free from depression brother austin amen i don't know you praise god so we really got to keep these things in mind praise god that if jesus overcame all these things for us we don't have to remain in them yes we've got to walk through them yes we've got to be tempted with them we've got to go through all these trials right we've got to go through tests we've got to overcome something if we want to be overcomers but we must remember that jesus already paid the price to free us from all these praise god and he's given us scriptures to make us mighty to overcome them praise god amen and we don't have to live in them we got to battle them but we don't have to be defeated we don't have to be slaves to them that's right in other words i will not be a slave to depression amen i will not be a slave uh to feeling i'm all alone or god doesn't see me i'm not gonna be a slave to having a pity party right we're all gonna feel like it we're gonna get discouraged but we've got to overcome that how are you gonna overcome god does see me he sees these these hairs he numbers all of them praise god he's aware of my problems he's aware of what i'm going through praise god he is mindful of them and he said don't fear in other words have faith in your trials amen amen have faith in your child church amen so here's a great good scripture on overcoming depression david writes my soul thirsts for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god in other words he wouldn't get in the presence of god when am i going to be in the presence of god now look my tears have been my meet day and night i think amen sings the songs about this uh all my tears have been my it's a shane's chainsaw i can't remember do you remember what it was now okay what is it called i'm not fond of living water okay yeah we found it yeah maybe we'll see that if we can at the end so david what are you eating every day tears now let's look at this while they continually say to me where's your god now church look at that look at the pressure david went through i mean look at that people are where's your guy and you're crying all the time if you walk up why are you crying where's your god i thought you said god loved you i thought you said god was your heavenly father he is but david david was suffering so much he's crying every day and my mockers are coming up saying where's god how come god hasn't answered your prayers where's that anointing that you got anointed with think about that brother see that anointing that natural anointing regard eventually drying up but the anointing in the soul can never dry up they poured oil on his head naturally but for us in the new testament we get a spiritual anointing that can never leave praise god and we can say our soul runs over praise god amen may it be so church maybe so that the anointing overflows out of our soul into our mind and onto our bodies so we can worship god amen amen but look at this look at the persecution reminds me of something that you went through sister you know with all the all the verbal persecution you've gone through in your life is your god where's god i thought you said you're a believer i thought god was the healer brother said if i prayed for a thousand people remember this quote and they all died the next morning i pray for divine healing that's the kind of faith that he had praise god that's why these people come out against brother brown and say well i got the prayer line and i didn't get healed well that that either wasn't god's will or you didn't believe or there's all those reasons god doesn't do divine healing but what about all the people that god healed amen what about all those great testimonies praise god and the fact is even if you get healed eventually you're going to get sick whether it's a week later or a month later or a year later you're eventually going to get sick anyway right but what about all the miracles praise god did they forget about that but see the devil say where's god where's god so we've got to cast that aside we can't be depressed right david was definitely the state of depression which he probably should have been because of being a fugitive but he says but then look he asked himself this is a good question see whenever we're struggling you'll notice whenever you're in the midst of a battle some positive thing will just suddenly come to your mind oh that's gone amen that's god trying to encourage you amen that's the holy spirit bringing everything to our remembrance praise god amen where's your god where's your god where god all of a sudden it's like heaven opens up and it pours down this saw on your mind why are you cast down my soul oh yeah it's like that song of gratitude come with my soul don't you get shy on me praise god don't get shy on me praise god we look at we take too much time to look at the natural instead of looking at the spiritual praise god we look at the earthly instead of looking up to heavenly praise god amen look at this where's your god and all of a sudden then the real questions come why are you cast down see the devil's question is where's god but the real question is why are you why are you cast down why why would you be discouraged why would you made this courage why are thou disquieted in me hope thou and god amen for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance praise god in other words i'm going to get the victory eventually i'm going to get back to the house of god and i'm going to give god praise i have hope in jesus amen amen all my hope is in jesus amen amen all my yesterdays are gone praise god i love that song my hope is in jesus name all my sins are forgiven i've been washing the blood praise god see so when you're depressed and everyone uh the devil's saying where's god where's god god will send a question to you why would you be cast out why are you quiet get up and praise the lord god help us amen i know you will praise god god will help us amen amen to get up and praise the lord despite our trials amen hallelujah don't ever lose your hope church what is depression you feel hopeless right austin remember you're talking about that in your testimony you feel like everything is useless what's it good at getting up and going to work what's the good of taking a shower right what's the good of anything feel hopeless like there's no hope right and we bat we'll go through that we'll battle through that but it just takes one question from god glory that's why i remember said i can say all these words but one word from god will change the whole situation amen day and night cry day and night where's god where's god day and night but one word from god says praise god i will get back to the house of god i know i'm going to have another victory i know i'm going to have another praise break amen thank god amen hallelujah this is what mighty men and women do wasn't david a mighty man wasn't he the leader of the mighty man mighty men get discouraged and cry all night and have struggles yeah mighty men mighty men and women do that sometimes do mighty men wonder where god is yes do mighty women wonder why isn't god moving is that okay to wonder that yes but god is going to encourage you he's going to send the right word at the right time amen just trust in the lord amen amen amen have confidence in god church has he failed you yet which one of other i remember i listened to my grandma on the sermon which one was it uh how can i overcome i think last week and he was saying i can't think of one time god has ever failed me in my entire life 56 years old amen i can't even go one time god ever failed me how could i how could i deny him how could i doubt him when he's not family for all these years that means he'll never fail me praise god he's not built to fail he's eternal praise god i know he's all-powerful all-knowing racist all loving amen he can't fail me praise god if i don't see him the the the victory is right around the corner praise god hope church have hope in god amen trust in god in the midst of the trials okay i've already preached 20 minutes okay good praise the lord so who wants to know brother ramsey's go to verse when he got discouraged right here i hear this romans 4 brother i never would have guessed i never would have guessed it i got a quote before too so i'm not making this up romans 4 19 and abraham being not weak in faith he would consider not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb so church abraham was looking at his body i'm dead my body doesn't work anymore to have a child we all know what i'm saying right my body's not working but yet i believe in god i don't see any i don't see any ability in my body to have a child but yet god can make it happen amen he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god amen and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform amen oh my what a beautiful promise a 99 year old man right he was a hundred when he had isaac his wife was 90. sarah was 90. a 100 year old man even though every every symptom said he can't have a son every symptom said he used his his body organs are dead to produce a child yet he didn't consider that he remembered thus saith the lord amen amen and when you would see abraham he was always at church giving god glory amen and of course he had some of his moments of depression too right we know he had his moments of lie right we know he had his moments of stumbling but the bible said you would find him he didn't stagger at the promise of god so in other words when he stumbled he got back up when he made a mistake he said forgive me and he kept trying to serve god hallelujah he was strong in faith giving god glory can we give god some glory tonight praise god we should let's all say glory to god heaven glory to god in the midst of my trials let's say it again ready glory to god no matter what you're going through give god the glory don't stagger at the promise of god don't stagger at god's process to make you wait don't be discouraged in that trust god if he brought you this far he's gonna bring you the rest of the way praise god he won't fail you he's a faithful father he's numbered the very hairs of your head amen so here's the quote brother says listen this who against hope this is from works his faith expressed look at that brother a month before he died exactly almost exactly a month minus two days before he died against hope all hope was gone oh let's look at this brother every time i go to feeling a little blue here's the chapter i turn to and that's something we got we have a little peek into a prophet's life whenever he got discouraged where should i go should i go to alcohol did he go to the bottom every time he got blue how about cigarettes oh no how about movie theaters no no you didn't know how to move we can name a million things did he go to his bank account no every time i get blue i go to chapter four of the book of romans praise god oh may god help us every time we get discouraged go to a sermon go to a song text a brother or sister do something but go to the word of god amen amen amen brother sister might give you the word of god right give me a verse on this sir can you pray for me with this situation every time i feel a little sad a little depressed i go to romans chapter 4. that's right he said see who quickens the dead and call those things which were not as though they were god said so so whenever program got discouraged he said god said this god's word said this god promised him so i'm going to believe it praise god i'm going to keep encouraging myself in the lord that god's promise can't fail praise god amen whenever i get blue i turn to romans chapter four good one to remember right by the way that's a pretty good one remember may god bring that to my remembrance now i'm going to get past that he just quotes that scripture i just read now you remember this one i just i preached two years ago so i'm gonna bring it back up i mentioned a few weeks ago what about talked about imperfect faith yeah that's why i was listening to it you talked about people that would drive a long distance to go to their services i appreciate that effort some of you will drive home tonight because you got to go to work by daylight in the morning i know it's hard and then when i think i get spells too you know i get moody brother and got moody sometimes i get to a spot where what gets me is i get in those spells when i'm all overworked and satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you haven't got a friend in the world see now remember i'm not immune to that temptation honestly i love brother graham he was so honest i thought he was a true christian true holy ghost real christian i can totally relate to him in many not in everything but not in divisions but everything about everything else his battle against sin and his victories see i got to overcome that oh brother i had to overcome the blues brother brown had to overcome that nobody cares for you nobody likes you you have no friends no one even nobody even thinks about you brother he says and then when i look back and see something like this all these people driving this distance i put it right back in satan's face and say what about that he said that helps me overcome what about that praise god the t-shirts in your life look for moments when you know someone loves you look for moments when you see god answering your prayers so when satan comes back you can stick that in satan's face and say look at this you're wrong god's people love me i am god does see me praise god god does care me pray god does care how do he's provided for me before he'll provide for me again praise god amen hallelujah so see the devil always puts things in your ear why don't you put something in his ear give him back right what is that what do they say give him a taste of his own medicine right he's giving you this poison medicine why don't you give him some some of your good medicine some of god's medicine amen that's what i said moses had a medicine cabinet and his medicine cabinet was psalms 103 praise god that's right i'm the lord thy god that heals all thy diseases amen amen praise god see satan's always putting something in your face put something in his face that's right put the word of god in his face praise the lord oh god doesn't care about me put well satan the bible said god has the very hairs of my head number so i'm not afraid about anything amen that's a mighty that's a mighty christian right there see because if not satan will get the victory over here then you'll be depressed and discouraged week after week month after month praise god looks like when you come to church you're eating sour patch kids or something like that because you're so sour want to smile at anybody i heard a preacher sit down with them you can sour patch kids all the time no smiling when you should be smiling at church just be happy praise god amen god died for you he said it's time to die for you praise god he cares he wants you to cast those characters he doesn't want you to be stressed out he doesn't want you depressed he wants you to know that he's right there with you praise god amen amen it's about time we put something in the devil's face right now the trouble is when we get our phones sometimes we put the we get accidentally get the wrong thing in our face right that's the devil too but we got to put something in devil's face so this is what the word of god says praise god hallelujah that's what i was doing on sunday remember last sunday i was talking no last wednesday night i was preaching about the roe v wade see whatever satan says tells me oh god god doesn't hear your prayers god doesn't hear prayers about this nation i just can take that roving weight and i can stick it right into the devil's face and said i prayed for this i cried for this for three or four years and god heard my prayer god does care amen amen he cares about the unborn children did you know idaho indiana what was the other one america i know indiana and another state just passed laws there's absolutely no abortion in those states anymore now of course some of those sinners are going to go outside the state and get abortions but think how many lives are being saved people won't have abortions now because it's illegal i thought glory to god god's gonna honor those states amen hallelujah see so when i get to victory i can stick it in satan's face too praise god hallelujah but man would say these people drive all night devil so get behind me these people care for me i've got friends who drive hundreds of miles just to see me just to hear me preach i've got lots of friends and they love jesus and we're on jesus side and jesus cares about me praise god put that in the devil's face be mighty in the word of god hallelujah praise the lord sometimes we don't feel like we're loved right but faith in the scriptures makes us feel loved remember i had all these notes to preach a few weeks ago i never got to it and i had all these other thoughts so i added a few here tonight but when you feel unloved the bible says this is what i've been going through over the last few years ever since i preached on that sermon uh the i am remember i preach that i am i preach all the uh the i am scriptures i am who you say i am there's a song that has that ever since i preached that i saw the scripture i'm like oh my lord this whole time i've been forgetting that i am god's beloved that's what i am i can tell the devil well you're devil you're going to get burned in the lake of fire but i am god's beloved amen that's what i am amen because god said so i didn't say so god said so and i believe god's word above my own i believe god's word above the devil's word amen amen even us whom we have called not the jews only but also of the gentiles that's what you are gentile as he said in the book of hosea which is oc and the in the greek translated english i will call them my people which were not my people and her my beloved which was not my beloved so church we we could honestly say as gentiles we were not god's beloved a little over 2 000 years ago but now we are right now there was a time when we weren't there's a time when maybe my ancestors way down the line we're not god's beloved but today i am god's beloved he cares about me all the hairs on my head are numbered praise god i'm more valuable than animals god loves me he cares how can i not love him back praise god how can i how can i not trust him in the midst of my deepest trials amen amen when he said i am his beloved amen which one of you would let your beloved go through the most awful things but what the bible said the bible says all temptation is common to man anything you're going through somebody else already went through it right may not be somebody in the church but somebody somewhere has gone through what you're going through already so you are beloved and remember church you can't trust your feelings all the time right you can't trust your feelings god god will have all this proof around you that you're loved these people love you that one loves me that one loves me of all this proof around you and satan will make you blind to that right but then what will the holy spirit do it'll point you back to the word of god why disquiet in my soul come on get up so get up and praise the lord same book not the same chapter god commended or proved his love to us while we were yet sinners christ died for us the very proof god loves you is in the cross of jesus christ we don't have to look any further than the cross when you see the cross that's god's love amen that's why i like when people wear that around their neck they don't have to i don't do it but i like sitting on people's necks every time i see them i love that cross praise god reminds me of god's love for me praise god much more than being now justified by his blood i'm righteous by his blood i shall be saved from wrath through him praise god amen much more praise god so much more i'm going to be saved i'm not going to be lost i'm going to be saved because the blood of jesus christ has justified me the love of god declare me righteous and the love of god will save me from the wrath that is to come amen amen this is bible believing faith right here that's right amen amen if you're a bible reader if you're a bible believer god loves me and how much more will i be saved because the blood and the blood is saved me from the wrath that is to come amen for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we should be saved by his life praise god amen oh god the light has already saved us praise amen let's believe that let's know that we're loved by god let's know that god can help us overcome doubt church amen and this is my go-to verse here's so many times i have doubt i doubt how's this going to work out did i do something wrong like is god gonna punish me if i don't do this or if i don't make this choice is god gonna i just doubt so many times you know not having a dad it's like i always doubt because i never had a dad like i never had dad just there he just wasn't there all the time you know i feel like as a man you need a good male role model right so i feel like i've always had doubt issues you know am i doing this right am i a failure uh you know i just always i've always battled that always always it's hopefully my son doesn't have to my god hopefully my kids don't have to but i see i talked to some of my siblings and they battled the same thing doubt just because dad was never there uh that you know it's just been difficult for us you know not having a dad a broken home that's kind of the effect of a broken home at least i've seen my life so this is my go-to verse brother william many times i've noticed over the last few years i've heard brother ben talk about his go-to verse sometimes i'll be struggling i'll be all stressed out on my phone or i just go to prayer and the verse that was it feels like it comes down from heaven is trust in the lord with all your heart amen see i'm doubting i'm dying i'm just going to work out how is this going to happen i don't even know what's going to what is going to happen next how is this going to work out we're going to have a church or uh are we gonna are we is anyone gonna die before the rapture are we gonna live to the rapture i get all these worries all these stresses how can you pay for this medical expense how's all this gonna happen and it's like a verse will come down saying trust in the lord without you stop doubting trust in god amen amen instead of putting all your energy into dieting put all your energy into trusting praise god that's my go-to verse because it's like god bringing me to the verse not that i'm perfect like every time i battle okay i'm going to proverbs chapter 3. i'm human but i notice in the midst of my wondering in the midst of my doubt in the midst of my fear i noticed this verse comes to me most often amen amen in church you know i memorized this verse when i was in fifth grade remember when i told you i went with my friend to this bible class it was called word of life bible class i went with my friend eric i remember i told you that this is before i bought that worldly music cd that led me away from the lord one of the first verses i memorized that that bible fast is this one right here trust the lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding see i'm always trying to lead to with my own understanding how can i understand this so i can figure it out how can i solve the problem and that's where i get problems because i can't i can't solve the problem but i noticed when i get victory is when this verse will come to my mind and i'll and i'll figure out that's right i can't i can't solve it anyway i i have no pr i have no power over the universe but i know somebody who does have power in the universe amen hallelujah and he told me to cast my cares on him and he'll take care of our problems praise god and then i remember this in all thy in all my ways acknowledge him and he will make my past straight amen i've just got to trust in the lord i can't figure it out i can't work it out only jesus can work amen so i've noticed this is the verse the holy spirit brings to me in my moments of doubt my moments of of depression we say just minor i've never been through it like some of some but this verse will come like shooting down from heaven and i'm glad because jesus said the holy ghost will bring all these things to your remembrance amen this is the one god has proved to me this is the one that god has written upon my heart so many years ago when i was in fifth grade and it keeps coming back to me in my darkest hours praise god amen trust in god don't trust in yourself amen you cannot work it out you can't solve the problem you've got to trust in god now this is kind of related you know with depression but anxiety some scriptures overcome anxiety i heard uh charles spurgeon said he was a preacher in the uh the 1800s and he said i love the i will verses of god because that's not somebody saying now god will still do what he told a prophet he would do but when god says i will that's even better praise god god is saying god's not telling a prophet to tell them i will do this god is saying i will do this that's what isaiah 41 i think this might have been haven's verse right fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i am thy god i will strengthen the yea i will help thee yay yes i will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness god is saying yes i'm with you yes i will strengthen you yes i will help you and yes i will hold you up when you feel like you're going to fall i'm going to be the one that holds you up praise god amen in other words don't worry about falling i'm going to catch you amen i've got you right i've got your back right right in other words i'm your safety net nature god is your safety net i will catch you before you fall praise god i'm right there there's nothing to fear i will do it i'm faithful i care about you i love you praise god don't worry about it don't stress about it i'm your safety net praise god i'm your security praise god now if i was your security i could help you for a little bit but i couldn't help you all the time now the great part is i'm not your security net got your security net praise god because i'll let you down my net sometimes rips it like that but i get discouraged i can't help it i couldn't help you the way you need help but god is greater than any man god cannot lie god is faithful he ever lives to be your safety net praise god amen amen is your strength in time of trouble he will uphold you with his right hand of righteousness his hand will be right there when you feel like you can't go on any further his hand will be right there to grab you under your hand and say come on come on haven't come up i'm your right hand on righteousness ain't gonna happen who reach out that hand he'll grab a hold of your hand and he'll carry you through praise god they'll lead you through the darkest times the darkest hours so the bible said don't worry about anything the bible says do not worry about anything you're worried about the inflation worried about end of the world they try to make us worry about nuclear problems you know we try to make you worry about all these things but the bible specifically says don't worry about anything but in every dark trial right every every test by prayer that's that's why i always preach on prayer right spend time with god prayer and supplication of supplication is interceding for other people by prayer and interceding with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god amen and the peace of god that's why i like that song all my ways are known to you oh what peace that i have found hallelujah oh what peace that i have found wherever i may be all my ways are known to you oh lord all my ways are known to you see he's right there what peace what great peace do you find what when we pray with thanksgiving that's when we find the peace of god the bible promises if you pray this way the peace of god will come over you don't even understand it the peace of god is going to come on you and it's going to guard your heart and mind through jesus christ amen it's going to keep you in the right place if you cast all your worries cast all your anxieties on god because he cares for you aren't you glad to care church aren't you glad tonight amen praise preach 40 minutes okay so i'm going to try to finish up here hopefully i always think i'm gonna get done so the guaranteed the guaranteed scriptures are i will i will strengthen you i will uphold you i will guide you i'll help you praise god if you just cast your cares upon me i promise my peace will come to you i promise praise god but it takes what it takes a person who will pray some of the time or every time god wants us to pray every time we won't be perfect but he says in every trial in everything by prayer and supplication he says i'll give you the peace of god if you want the peace of god makes me want to sing peace of god cover me up only we had amen here we could probably do it that guy could provide you back there my voice is out you know once i get back to school i talk all day you know so i need some help back there but i need a song later so so when you feel like you're a failure how many never felt like you're a failure you don't raise your hand i felt like that many times i remember last time when i went through my school test last year uh you know to get graded as a teacher nature i was getting graded the first let you get two lessons right the first lesson i got to see and i didn't realize i was so discouraged i'm like what do you mean i was like reading the i got a c on the first one i thought oh i'm gonna have to tell the church now i didn't get an a i'm not the best teacher i could be i was so discouraged but then i read it i read it and i said oh yeah you can you can actually raise your score on the next observation i'm like ah glory i was feeling like a failure until i read the fine print i had to read a little more and i realized i didn't have to be a failure i get a chance to redeem myself i've forgotten a couple of things i was like oh yeah i got to do this and that's right i gotta give this option for the kids i gotta get more options i gotta give challenges in the lesson but also i gotta i also gotta uh make it easier for some kids in the lesson if they can't do what i'm asking them to do and so i i took courage i felt i felt like a failure for a few weeks then i took courage and the next time i i made the corrections then when my principal came in i i i did the best i could i got his emails and oh you got you got outstanding is this you earned the highest grade as a teacher now this is just one small example of church but failure on the job can haunt you right nobody here wants to fail in their job you see that's one area where i struggled you know last year i was feeling like a failure for a couple weeks like god i've given you all this you know i've given you a dollar i've given you a part of my whole life for you and i don't want to become a average teacher i feel like a failure but then when i read and studied and i said oh i didn't realize this now i can overcome my god's grace amen so i got the highest grade by god's grace now spiritually that's just a natural example the more important one is spiritual now thanks be unto god which always everybody say always ready oh that sometimes always causes you to triumph in christ in other words god always makes me the winner praise god amen god always makes me the victory so picture yourself like on a track or picture yourself like in a contest who's always going to get top place nature you are the devils are always going to be overcome by god in you sisterhood you're always going to be on top of the podium i got my picture up there a couple times as a state champ you know i was on top i felt pretty good everybody's cheering for me i felt pretty good but that's nothing compared to this where in spiritual matters god always raises you up above the enemy oh i'm gonna take a praise god always not sometimes i lost some but i won some but in this case brother william you don't lose any time you win all the time praise i'm always going to overcome satan praise god right why because christ is causing me ah amen there there's that hand that hell that reaches out when i fall he grabs me and he causes me to win the battle praise god oh hallelujah not sometimes always amen amen hallelujah i'm always the winner but i know it's by grace right so not something i brag on but i realize he's causing me because i've dedicated my life i surrendered my life to him he takes full responsibility for me man just like a real husband right a real husband's not gonna let his wife uh you know get abused or or get neglected a real man is going to provide for his wife all the time amen that's why when we when we run out of eggs sisterhood and it's 10 o'clock at night i say i'm going to go buy eggs tonight a giant eagle praise god i'm going to make that extra half hour trip and i'm gonna i'm gonna always cause my family to have food in other words i'm not gonna let them laugh that's just a small example what about people that give their lives and really sacrifice really sacrifice really struggle but if i won't let my natural family uh have once what about a god and not church see we ought to give god thanks this ought to make us thankful god you always make me the victor praise god amen thank you for making me the victor amen i'm not the loser i'm the winner praise god i'm always the winner hallelujah he's always making me win because i'm his beloved praise god and he makes and this makes manifest the savor or the smell the anointing of his knowledge by us in every place in other words wherever god's people are you can always smell the aroma of the holy spirit amen oh this is a place of victory that's what i like what i feel when i come into church i feel victorious when i come to church i smell god's victory here i smell god's uh god's holy anointing oil here praise god this is a place where god's glory dwells this is a place where god's victory is one he's always causing us here by coming to hear the word and praying and worshiping god has given us the victory he's bringing us to the victory we don't have to worry about it and everybody's going to see the anointing of god everyone's going to smell god's spirit on us they're going to sense that god is with you praise god amen oh it's making you victorious awesome we're standing right there when that guy remember jacob alba this summer he sit right there right in front of austin and he said i've never seen jesse down and discouraged remember when he said that remember that the guy with the big beard yeah not this big beard a bigger beard than this jacob all we're saying right there yeah and i didn't even tell him to say it but he said i've never seen jesse waver that's what he said i've never seen jesse waver why because god always makes me unwavering amen hallelujah he always causes me to not waver praise god which we love we still love him but see you can live i've been around him for years bro i've been around him about at least 10 years and he's never seen me waver now you probably see me waver i have tough times i struggle i sin but he's never seen you see because jesus is always making me try amen not me but it's christ in me praise god in every place so at work he's going to make you try out he's going to make you drive for work brother he can make you triumph in the church hallelujah he's going to make you victory victorious in your home in the church every place every place where there's a believer when you surrender to god he's going to make it known amongst everybody there that really encouraged me i didn't plan to say that but that really encouraged me because i thought austin got to hear it praise god you know wasn't i wasn't asking for a compliment but he's the one that brought it up hmm and i love this verse this verse has been so great since i preached that joshua series by this i know god loves me because my enemies never triumph over me amen when that sin comes around that temptation it doesn't conquer me god conquers my temptations amen i don't fall into this and fall to them i don't stay defeated god makes me victorious praise god amen i might stumble seven times but the lord raises me up every time these sins don't get victory over me i get victory over them i'm more than a conqueror you're more than a conqueror he always causes you to triumph because he favors you because he loves you praise god amen that's a god i can serve right there with joy too with joy amen join the house of the lord this is how i know god favors me because i never fall it's all these sins he brings the saint brings my way he can't keep me down i might get down a little bit but he can't keep me down amen brother i've just seen a brother after 16 years a pastor service in service out just getting god's just getting god's presence god is always going to make you the victor amen always going to make you the minister praise god you'll eventually get the victory coming out of that it won't rule your life it won't destroy your life i'm a testimony it will help your life overcome it'll help your life it'll help your testimony for jesus christ amen it'll make your life more strong that's what i'm saying your trials will only make you stronger praise god church if we walk in the light as jesus in the light we have fellowship one with another amen that's why i always want i always want to greet everybody sunday i always want to talk i was trying to talk to everybody every sunday a little bit you know i want to have fellowship with everybody because the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin amen i don't want to have time where i just won't talk to william i just i can't stand that brother well i don't want to talk to austin no no i want to have fellowship with all god's people because that proves the blood of jesus christ is anointing my life amen right because when i have fellowship with him i can fellowship with everybody if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins see church like i said when you go through hard times you just gotta say lord i am sorry forgive me for that help me to overcome it next time you might struggle with it for weeks or months you might struggle with brother i'm struggling with that um that critical spirit for years i got the quotes i preached a little while ago constantly struggling this in fact his whole life be short with the critical spirit rickeys and regettas and he said god's own enough to do that because some of those kids are just his children we get he kept doing it see but he's gotta we gotta confess it lord forgive me i'm trying you're gonna help me i'm gonna overcome this will not overcome me i will overcome it praise god i know you favor me god because you will not let this triumph over me amen amen if you confess church god will forgive you of your sins and he will cleanse you and i from all unrighteousness amen he is faithful to forgive now there's a laugh i think i got a couple more here i see there it is i said i wasn't going to go along let's just yeah let's just close to this one i might have to have a part seven here is this part six mailchimp i might steal parts you always do more problems so there's faith in the scriptures will make you overcome laziness that's something we really got a battle in laodicea right psalm chapter 2 be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed you judges of the north now look he's talking to kings natural but what are you you're a spiritual king yeah so let's learn from this as a spiritual kingdom serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling look at that how can you rejoice while trembling but yet the bible says you can you're trembling in the presence of god yet you're rejoicing oh jesus loves me he died for me oh thank god for another chance thank god for second chances right you're just rejoicing that god has had mercy on you kiss the son see worship jesus love jesus lest he be angry you perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all day that put their trust in him amen but the point i want to get to instead of being lazy tremble before the lord right lacy's like i don't want to get close to god i just want to stay in my attitude but when you when you get out of that laziness you tremble the presence of god lord this day is important lord i want to redeem this time i don't want to waste one day serving god when you tremble in prayer you tremble in the presence of god and then look you kiss the son you worship jesus right you love jesus roman said when a woman kisses dirty feet kissed it you make all those kissing sounds he walked she washed uh jesus feet with the head of her hair and that's how we should we should just watch jesus we should love jesus worship him with all we have amen me i like to close my eyes and wait my arms like to stomp and clap shout hallelujah praise god show jesus your love that's what i'm saying amen show jesus how much you love him that's right kiss the son or else he's gonna be angry in other words don't kiss the world kiss the lord jesus christ that's right show jesus your greatest affections how many would do that by god's place i'm going to skip past that one i'm going to go right to this one let's go to this let's stand maokai you can come we'll just read this one and we'll finish up here so i'm already at almost an hour yeah i'm at 50 55. it's almost impossible to preach 30 minutes philippians 2 12 wherefore my beloved paul says as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more my absence work out your own salvation with fear from me what a great verse this was reminded to me last week i thought oh my forgot all about this verse sometimes you wonder am i even saved am i sure i got saved paul says the way to stay humble is to always keep an attitude of fear and trouble that's right so not a lazy attitude like oh i'm god's bride and god let me get away with anything that's that's not the right attitude right right attitude is lord help me always to work out my salvation with fear and trembling because it is god working in you both to will and do as good pleasure so church see god works the best with us when we're weak and trembling when we fear when we're when we're just honestly reverent around his word that's when god works the best in us when we can tremble i know it's hard when you've got a pastor preaching every week but when those moments come when you can tremble at what i'm preaching when that really shakes you that's that's a good sign that's where we need to be amen we have to be there every single service on seriousness there's rejoicing and i believe in all that shouting i i can shout with the best i can shout out to my voice goes out but see you know you're working you know you're close to god you know uh you're assured of your salvation when you have such sincerity that you tremble in god's presence you might cry you might weep but that's how you know you're on the right path you're not lazy in your walk with god but you tremble at the word of god the bible says do all things without murmurings and disputes without complaining and then divisions amongst the people try not to complain and try not to dispute with other people trying to argue with other people great verses aren't they these are verses not for weak men these are verses for mighty men amen amen these are verses for not weak women not weak children mighty children so see with girls when you go to school tomorrow and hey when you go to school don't complain when mom or the teacher asks you to do something don't don't murmur well we got to practice spelling again now maybe that's next week right not this week this week we don't have time for five days so see let's apply that to our lives that's right i'm not gonna complain when the teacher asked me just i'm not gonna complain when mom asked me to finish all my food right i'm not going to complain when the when the bathroom's dirty i'm not going to complain i'm going to pick up the toilet paper that's on the floor and of course i'm going to wash my hands too i'm not going to complain why don't people pick up the toilet paper or bathroom i'm not gonna complain and i'm gonna thank god he saved me and i'm gonna approach i'm gonna trouble his word lord help me not to complain about anything and you can quote the verse girls right gentlemen men you can quote the verse i will do all things without complaining and disputing and arguing because i'm a real christian i'm going to be a christian like that amen got some mighty believers out there god bless you let's buy our heads here i'm almost finished i'll say just hard to preach 45 it's an hour right there so it's hard it's just hard so hard 30 minutes [Music] hallelujah thank god church that he always makes you the victor thank god can we can we clap and thank the lord here let's thank god he always causes me to triumph in christ jesus always gone [Music] thank you lord for always making me victorious times i should lose times i should be defeated times i should be embarrassed yet he comes around and makes sure i get the victory over the devil that's the kind of god i love i'm so thankful jesus called me to his his salvation now may i work out my salvation with fear and trembling may be so real to me that the word of god challenges me i'm gonna be challenged by the word of god amen hallelujah and it challenges me i can overcome laziness i can overcome depression i can overcome anxiety praise god i can overcome not feeling loved wondering if god cares i can overcome all these things because christ always makes me try pray heavenly father we thank you lord god for tonight again thank you for the word that we've heard thank you for our church that's for the mighty men and women and sugar lord god
