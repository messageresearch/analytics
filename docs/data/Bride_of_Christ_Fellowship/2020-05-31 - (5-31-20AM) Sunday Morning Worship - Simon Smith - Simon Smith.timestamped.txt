[0:26] best memory in the world so we're trying

[4:24] yes based on love your teeth hey man
[4:34] freeze God isn't he good I was looking
[4:37] at Eagles and looking at the difference
[4:39] of a vulture how they fly you know of
[4:41] all true his wings go like this like a
[4:43] little bee but he goes the straight they
[4:46] said that's how you can tell is it once
[4:49] flying or you can tell if it's eagle or
[4:51] not as a them wings are straight like an
[4:53] arrow that's that's like a breeze but of
[4:57] course we know they go down they go stay
[4:59] all year round and the vultures will
[5:02] head to down south for the winner there
[5:04] they moved the warmth there anyhow I
[5:08] thought about maybe let's sing a
[5:10] Heavenly Father you know that we have a
[5:12] father
[5:13] we appreciate you I don't know the names
[5:16] these I just know keywords maybe there's
[5:19] a person back there trying to throw it
[5:20] to me
[5:22] [Music]
[5:24] the guys like I said I'm not a song
[5:26] leader by trade or my gift but by the
[5:31] grace of God we're gonna listen
[5:34] my pastor back home wasn't preaching on
[5:39] on
[5:40] chosing choosing to approach God and if
[5:44] we are kings and priests our worship
[5:48] reflects how we treat them how we love
[5:53] them and just got done preaching on the
[5:56] bells and tomogram is hanging from the
[5:58] skirt their high priest and those things
[6:01] were always making noise all always just
[6:05] worshiping God and just praising God in
[6:08] the midst of it every trial every father
[6:10] so we want to encourage you to worship
[6:12] the Lord the best you can't feel free
[6:14] this is the house of God we assemble on
[6:17] Sundays and Wednesdays to it to worship
[6:19] Him so let's sing this song here we do
[6:22] have a song special here maybe next and
[6:25] so the start of this year heavenly
[6:35] [Applause]
[6:36] [Music]
[7:46] [Music]
[7:57] [Music]
[9:05] [Music]
[9:08] this would be wonderful
[9:10] yes oh Jesus thank you without the
[9:14] leadership of the Holy Ghost for would
[9:15] it be this week I had a tremendous trial
[9:19] I woke up one day I think I believe it
[9:22] was a Thursday morning I woke up and I I
[9:26] woke up and the room was spinning and I
[9:30] got dizzy now it's about ready to pass
[9:32] out and I was like how am I go to work
[9:33] but by the grace of God I just drove
[9:36] right to work and the guy is instantly
[9:39] realized there was something wrong with
[9:40] me
[9:40] if I would just go like that I'd almost
[9:43] fall over but I had to pray through I
[9:45] didn't COFF work
[9:46] I learned something a long time ago from
[9:49] brother ray Hernandez from church near
[9:53] her Sheffield he said whatever kind of
[9:55] situation come into you say it's not
[9:57] real and I went on and worked first
[10:02] break I went in my truck for the 15
[10:04] minute nap a little bit better I kept
[10:06] working and working working at lunch I
[10:08] went skip lunch actually the meat I went
[10:11] and took a nap for half an hour got up
[10:13] and I finished the entire day because
[10:17] what this is not how I feel that that
[10:21] determines anything that is the devil
[10:23] trying to inflict this body but I was
[10:26] saying here that day I had to go to work
[10:28] because I have to pay my bills and we
[10:30] press through it and after that I went
[10:32] and changed a thermostat for somebody
[10:34] and you don't 11 o'clock p.m. and I felt
[10:36] just horrible but the next day I woke up
[10:38] that was good to go
[10:41] amen so anyhow let's say a word of
[10:46] Prayer then after that we're gonna have
[10:49] sister Wendy come up and give a song
[10:50] special god bless her for that as a
[10:54] prayer question anyone have any special
[10:56] prayer requests we all have loved ones
[10:58] maybe a need
[11:00] upcoming battles we want to be ready for
[11:02] the rapture there's many many things
[11:05] coming up we see the world seen how it's
[11:08] becoming just unrest I mean we're at war
[11:11] at the end time saying to God if I had
[11:13] to explain if I had to guess or if I had
[11:15] to make a presumption I would say this
[11:17] is we aren't we have arrived to these
[11:20] things are moving and as they say it's
[11:23] then we're coming to the new normal
[11:25] what does that tell you what are they
[11:26] telling us this thing is going to
[11:28] continue to get worse and worse and we
[11:30] are now we had better make sure we have
[11:34] the oil so unspoken prayer requests
[11:37] maybe Lord willing anything special
[11:40] because you can speak up if you want or
[11:42] whatever we're not sister Wendy has a
[11:46] request it says my mom just had a knee
[11:48] surgery please play pray for a full
[11:51] recovery i immense will keep time prayer
[11:54] precious brother there at our church
[11:57] brother mike.mccluskey he gets
[11:59] infections in his kidney and he was he
[12:03] goes down for the count and he by the
[12:06] grace of God he asked prayer requests on
[12:09] the brothers whatsapp gathering Eagles
[12:12] we called sight and he said please pray
[12:14] for me the brothers went in for prayer
[12:16] and he didn't feel pain for the first
[12:18] time in intoed for two full days he had
[12:20] no pain which for if you know his
[12:23] situation it's very very painful when he
[12:25] got shot in the back of those nerves are
[12:27] all not together and when they strike at
[12:31] whatever whatever would cause that nerve
[12:32] to hit it would hit his muscle and it
[12:34] would jerk it so he's like fighting
[12:36] constantly all day long it's that bad so
[12:39] but by the prayer of the saints of God
[12:42] he did not feel any pain for two days so
[12:45] let's bow our heads if you have any
[12:47] prayer quest just lift your hands up
[12:49] unspoken or however and it will approach

[23:10] leaning on which way to go and thank you
[23:14] brother Malachi for helping your feeble
[23:17] uncle out here by the grace of God let
[23:19] me set up here idea of power point for
[23:20] you sorry we had some hindrances on the
[23:26] way here didn't have gas in the car in
[23:30] the morning and we stopped there and
[23:31] then the pump won't work then I ran in
[23:34] the lady was hiding in the beer cave and
[23:37] it just took a long time and then I was
[23:39] through Clyde Ohio and hit a train and
[23:42] waited there for a while and then
[23:44] finally had to do some bypass action so
[23:48] I was a little struggle getting here but
[23:51] we may hit by the grace of God
[23:53] Oh Barry's doing good Pennsylvania sings
[23:59] amen amen Hollis awesome I remember you
[24:04] guys but I cannot
[24:06] place pull the names so please forgive
[24:10] me all right here we go I have a couple
[24:22] of thoughts here and God is good and you
[24:32] won't have a testimony this morning
[24:33] they'd like to share anything God's done
[24:35] for you or kept us and I want to give
[24:40] another test a little testimony this
[24:41] morning my cousin Adam showed up we had
[24:46] our men's true change study last night
[24:48] and my cousin Adam showed up again and
[24:53] that brother is just he is on fire for
[24:56] the Lord he cannot fully really come to
[25:00] our assembly yet due to certain
[25:04] situations but he is feasting on the
[25:08] message of the hour
[25:11] eyewitness tune back in the end of 2000
[25:17] or the beginning of 2000 no no I'm sorry
[25:19] I'm so sorry it was the end of 2001 I
[25:21] witnessed to him with serpent seed I
[25:23] gave him a tape and we work in different
[25:27] shifts at the same job and I said Adam I
[25:30] want you to listen to this he said
[25:31] absolutely sad was I you listened that
[25:34] tape I come back in the next shift for
[25:35] it was my turn and we we saw each other
[25:38] again and I said what do you think he
[25:41] said Simon he goes I'm a son of God and
[25:43] from that point the devil inflicted him
[25:45] with drugs and he was a junkie for 19
[25:51] years 19 solid years and our family over
[25:58] there knows the story and just last year
[26:01] God fully delivered him he was living on
[26:04] the streets lost his wife his children
[26:06] he had a painting business he lost that
[26:10] and God started moving on his life and
[26:13] he's fully delivered right now
[26:17] and he knows what we believe because we
[26:19] witnessed him so many times and he said
[26:23] Simon he goes I didn't come to you guys
[26:24] his church because I wanted God to lead
[26:26] me there if that was the truth and he
[26:27] went to denomination two big Church mega
[26:29] church this lessness and he got a little
[26:33] curious you know he's like well they're
[26:34] good preachers they're good preachers
[26:36] and he's uh he started listening to a
[26:39] couple brother branham's sermons and he
[26:43] said all the rest are trash all the rest
[26:46] they're false ministers he said and then
[26:48] I'll get this he's been listening to
[26:50] those tapes for almost four months now
[26:52] solid he's a painter now by trade and he
[26:55] puts your phones on earbuds in and just
[26:58] plays tapes constantly and he he he
[27:07] tried to us do a switch he said you know
[27:09] I'm just gonna listen to music this week
[27:11] and he started listening to music for a
[27:14] whole week and Amir buds and he by the
[27:16] end of the week he said something felt
[27:18] really wrong and he wasn't feeling good
[27:19] and he's lost his joy and he's like
[27:21] what's going on Lord he's trying to
[27:23] community uh you know prayed to the Lord
[27:25] as he works he's trying to do all those
[27:26] things and the Holy Ghost came to him
[27:28] said you're not feeding me so he tried
[27:31] to do all these worship songs and
[27:33] worship music during the week and this
[27:34] NAT and as soon as he got back to
[27:36] listening to those tapes for eight hours
[27:38] a day this guy is eating eight hours a
[27:40] day the message he said he said his soul
[27:43] his joy got revival and he is just in
[27:48] fact if you would just if you knew him
[27:49] like I knew him the last eighteen years
[27:51] and what the things he has done and you
[27:54] don't you understand but God God knows
[27:59] all things and he came last night and he
[28:02] was having it just a tremendous time by
[28:04] the grace of God and asking questions it
[28:07] was me brother cam and Jesse so we're
[28:08] and then all the rest of the brothers
[28:10] there have fellowshipping over the word
[28:11] and the God opened up a couple things it
[28:13] was absolutely fantastic so let me see
[28:17] if I can find a little the one I'm
[28:20] thinking here
[28:24] I have something here
[29:08] oh maybe the Lord does want me to teach
[29:10] that one so let's go what I have pulled
[29:12] up let's see if we got we got it already
[29:15] praise the Lord so I'll stand here and
[29:18] let's pull from the Word of God sorry
[29:22] I'm not like what you would maybe
[29:23] consider a normal Minister I'm actually
[29:25] just kind of like a little teacher we do
[29:28] Bible studies we do our best a witness
[29:31] we just had one last week with a young
[29:34] man from a sister our church her son one
[29:37] of the Bible say but went there did that
[29:39] and by the grace of God it was a really
[29:43] good time and II felt good afterwards so
[29:49] the schools have really infiltrated our
[29:53] youth the public schools and they've
[29:55] swayed obviously evolution and they
[30:01] brought that thought in and and thank
[30:02] the Lord that the Bible does contain
[30:04] many many creation scriptures as far as
[30:08] proofs things they have just now found
[30:10] out brother Jesse just shared with us
[30:13] last night that 2015 science now has
[30:16] found out that snakes have DNA or
[30:20] genetics for legs and arms of God even
[30:25] left full evidence and a witness that
[30:27] the serpent originally could walk and
[30:29] talk so science is just catching up with
[30:32] what we have right here so let's turn to
[30:33] Genesis 1 verse 1 I taught this back
[30:43] home
[30:43] not my last service but the Lord opened
[30:48] this or not opened it up he just showed
[30:49] this to me one day and I started
[30:52] thinking on it and thinking on it and I
[30:56] thought it was something that we should
[30:58] teach so Genesis 1 and verse 1 in the
[31:02] beginning God created the heavens and
[31:04] the earth and the earth was without form
[31:07] and void and darkness was upon the sky
[31:09] to face the deep and the Spirit of God
[31:11] moved upon the face of the waters now
[31:16] notice what Christ God says here
[31:20] and God said let there be light and
[31:22] there was light and God saw the light
[31:27] that it was good and God divided the
[31:30] light from the darkness and God called
[31:33] the light day and the darkness he called
[31:35] night and the evening in the morning
[31:36] were the first day so let's say a word
[31:38] of Prayer as we dive into this thought
[31:42] dear friendly father Lord Jesus Lord and
[31:45] you know Lord maybe how unprepared Lord
[31:48] I am Lord but Lord or not they're not
[31:50] counting coming here to hear me I know
[31:52] that lord or even to look at me but Lord
[31:54] Jesus Lord they want to hear from you
[31:56] this morning Lord we just asked Lord you
[31:57] just come down Lord and just break for
[32:00] this bread Lord and lawyers anoint their
[32:02] eyes and ears God Lord to see in here
[32:04] Lord like you said and to your wonderful
[32:06] disciples you had while you were here on
[32:07] earth in physical form God and you said
[32:09] blessed their eyes for they seeing their
[32:11] ears for they hear and Lord God we want
[32:13] to be the same as well God nor it or not
[32:15] it's not all about knowledge Lord but
[32:17] Lord as my revelation God and we want
[32:18] things Lord preach Lord not to just go
[32:21] into our minds ordered with the said O
[32:22] Lord and to really bring a forth a
[32:24] change in our lives God though it's
[32:27] something no that would move us Lord
[32:28] that would just we would come out
[32:30] different after this service Lord God
[32:31] and Lord Jesus Lord just bless these
[32:33] people Lord they've traveled many many
[32:35] hours their Lord and Lord just
[32:38] strengthen him Lord and all the faithful
[32:39] of this household as well God Lord be
[32:42] with them as well we love you so much
[32:44] Lord and just Lord just use my little
[32:46] voice and body Lord according to God we
[32:48] love you so much in the name of Jesus
[32:50] Christ amen
[32:51] and I have your seats
[33:05] so here's our opening scripture here by
[33:07] the grace of God every few okay this
[33:10] morning I'm not trying to be boring or
[33:12] anything or I I'm just trying I'm this
[33:14] is who I am my nephews and nieces sister
[33:16] Wendy knows me that says Naomi all them
[33:18] they know how I am and the thing but we
[33:24] just want to be edifying the main thing
[33:26] is if we can come here and we can convey
[33:29] the very thought the Lord gave me here
[33:30] we want to be edifying that you can go
[33:32] out stronger because saints of God
[33:34] there's battles coming there are some
[33:36] serious things coming a while back when
[33:39] I had taught on I had taught on the open
[33:41] book and went through Ezekiel and showed
[33:43] the days of the open book and just
[33:46] showed and it was I think it was Ezekiel
[33:48] chapter five six or seven it says an
[33:51] evil he says an evil and evil is coming
[33:54] and that was back and I it was I think I
[33:57] appreciate hear later but I I really
[33:58] caught the thought there and in August
[34:00] and look how far life has already
[34:02] changed now they've shut the entire
[34:04] world down for a virus that kills less
[34:06] than three percent of the people when I
[34:09] go on the job sites and we talk with the
[34:11] guys and this and and I always tell them
[34:13] I said people worried about how many
[34:16] have died from this but do you know how
[34:17] many do you know how many missing
[34:19] children come up missing every year in
[34:21] the United States of America not to
[34:23] Russia not Japan not China
[34:25] you how many children come up missing or
[34:28] abducted or whatever happened you how
[34:31] many eight hundred thousand children
[34:33] almost almost a million children come up
[34:36] missing every year and that we don't
[34:38] hear about on the news we're not hearing
[34:40] about it the world's not shutting down
[34:42] because these these 800,000 children
[34:45] that have come to come up missing every
[34:48] year in the United States of America and
[34:51] yet they're worried about this virus
[34:53] where's this the things of God we are we
[34:54] have arrived this is this that they are
[34:57] the the powers that be are flexing their
[34:59] muscles they're seeing how far they can
[35:01] go and take this and they're gonna take
[35:03] it all the way to the bank program said
[35:06] well these at Rome has the gold the Jews
[35:08] have the paper the bonds and all those
[35:10] things he says and when the money fails
[35:12] the trap is set prepare ourselves we
[35:16] have to be prayer
[35:17] this is the time right now to pray up to
[35:20] feed the inner man to get ready for the
[35:23] rapture so I say those things with
[35:24] reverence with seriousness so here in
[35:29] Genesis 1 and 1 we see all of creation
[35:32] and it's amazing the Lord that would
[35:35] already have this thing set in order how
[35:38] the earth was already there but remember
[35:39] as it was in darkness and in void now
[35:42] how many I don't know how many who came
[35:43] out of the world but I came right out of
[35:45] the world on the denomination and I
[35:47] called the world denomination because
[35:48] it's just the same what's the difference
[35:50] I was actually on Facebook there and one
[35:54] of the guys that I went to church with
[35:56] when I was in denomination he's still in
[35:58] denomination and all of a sudden now
[36:01] social drinking is okay he's sitting
[36:05] back on his chair and he's showing his
[36:06] he's painting around in his backyard
[36:08] while his kids are playing in the
[36:09] trampoline he says I've got he goes I'm
[36:11] living the life and I believe this man
[36:13] is a being a pastor and he pans over and
[36:15] on his little backyard a table there
[36:19] there's an alcoholic beverage and that
[36:22] was and that is the leadership now of
[36:24] this generation of denominations but
[36:29] when I was in denomination saints of God
[36:30] I'll say it like this when I was growing
[36:32] up and coming in you know as a young boy
[36:34] we at that age we have no idea
[36:37] literally really have no idea that there
[36:39] is a God we have no idea what the what
[36:42] our what we're even here for we have no
[36:43] idea what we're gonna do in the future
[36:45] we have no idea as a young child right
[36:48] here in the front door or in the back
[36:49] there right now their future they have
[36:52] no idea what's coming
[36:53] even us right now in this age and this
[36:56] this time that I'm just about ready
[36:58] turned 43 and as a 43 42 year old right
[37:02] now looking to the 43 what is in the
[37:04] future it's all darkness I have no idea
[37:06] why it's all black it's all void I
[37:08] cannot figure out what's going to take
[37:10] place tomorrow we have no idea where
[37:12] we're in this place where we have no
[37:14] concept of what tomorrow brings
[37:17] but jesus said not to worry about it why
[37:20] but but but the thing is the beautiful
[37:21] thing is about that darkness there the
[37:24] winter the first thing that Jesus
[37:26] brought that God brought to the darkness
[37:28] was
[37:29] the light amen and we must be in that
[37:32] lag correct a man now the prophet of God
[37:35] he was talking about lights I believe
[37:38] one time and and and and the one the one
[37:41] quote I read that kind of inspired this
[37:43] whole thing he said there's three kind
[37:45] of lights and I thought about it and I
[37:46] thought about and I chewed on and I
[37:48] thought about some more I spit it out
[37:50] and I pulled it back in and I started
[37:51] chewing on a chewing harder than it and
[37:53] then I said and I and as I was thinking
[37:55] on these I said actually there's four
[37:58] kinds of lights so I like to teach this
[38:04] morning on if you could walking in the
[38:06] light but that's not it you have to
[38:11] choose your light what light you
[38:14] what do you mean brother sigh I thought
[38:15] there was only one light you're gonna
[38:17] see there's four kinds of light and we
[38:21] had better make sure that we are living
[38:25] in the light amen
[38:29] makes sense we're gonna teach this the
[38:33] very best we can
[38:34] I've been in places where it's
[38:36] completely dark I've been in places
[38:39] where where you step outside and they
[38:41] had no security lights at night and I
[38:43] could not literally see behind in the
[38:45] front of my hand it was that dark out at
[38:47] some places so darkness is kind of a
[38:51] scary thing I say this too when I was a
[38:53] denomination I was walking in that
[38:54] denominational darkness there is there
[38:58] there's not a feeling like that you have
[39:00] you're so unsure about everything well
[39:02] what does this mean in the scripture
[39:04] what does that mean in the scripture
[39:05] what you ask your pastor this you ask
[39:06] another past in this or another Minister
[39:09] this or that question and they just give
[39:11] their very best opinion you know they
[39:13] give your very best answer on their own
[39:15] reasoning and very seldom do they
[39:18] actually take you to the scripture in
[39:19] that at that point things about you are
[39:21] in darkness a man even in this message
[39:24] I'll say like that if you do not have
[39:27] the correct leadership you can be in
[39:29] darkness if you do not have a leadership
[39:31] of the Holy Ghost you'll be in darkness
[39:34] absolutely you're not the first version
[39:36] they either lamps go out and what they
[39:38] find themselves in
[39:40] darkness so we must choose our light and
[39:45] choose our light wisely a man now
[39:49] look here in the book of Job here he
[39:51] says what is man that he should be clean
[39:53] and he which is born of woman that he
[39:55] should be righteous look he says
[39:58] now we know that God is like right he
[40:01] says behold he putteth no trust to his
[40:03] Saints
[40:03] yeah the heavens are not clean in his
[40:06] sight how much more the Obama on the
[40:08] filthy is a man that drinketh iniquity
[40:10] like waters what he cannot trust any of
[40:12] the Saints why because we are not light
[40:15] we have a portion or as the Prophet he
[40:18] would be I have a light that came with
[40:19] him you know inside of us were made of
[40:21] what our physical building nape or
[40:23] bodies are made on what come he said
[40:26] what chemical or sorry cosmic light the
[40:30] reason they could take x-rays on your
[40:32] body is because there's like light
[40:33] actually inside of our bodies they said
[40:36] so at this point right here what does
[40:41] man that he should be clean what as we
[40:43] were born into sin we are we're dark one
[40:47] time I I was in the world I was not even
[40:50] denomination I was actually an atheist I
[40:52] was back slidden college and it's net
[40:53] and I went to one of them fortune-teller
[40:55] ladies and she's like oh you have the
[40:57] darkest aura I've ever seen and I'm like
[41:00] okay I had no light and now I can look
[41:04] back say yes I had absolutely no light
[41:07] but at the end there I caught that she
[41:09] lied and and she says now tell me don't
[41:13] tell me but think in your mind what's
[41:15] the one thing you want to do on a
[41:17] butcher greatest wish and in my heart
[41:20] now this is as a sinner I was lost you
[41:26] know my request in my heart was my heart
[41:28] would I said I want to go to heaven and
[41:30] she said if you continue on your path
[41:33] you'll make it and I'm thinking no I'm
[41:36] not so God showed me right there there's
[41:39] absolutely a very very little
[41:41] discernment oh my so how can I trust the
[41:45] rest of what she said oh my god have
[41:48] mercy but we're all born into darkness
[41:51] in the filthiness into
[41:53] being that lost state absolutely even
[41:56] when I first got saved I was still doing
[41:58] so much worthiness I said this without
[42:01] this message a brother now I've been
[42:03] talking to he's questioning the message
[42:05] he's questioning a message and I said
[42:06] let me tell you something other I said
[42:08] what message it names somewhere else
[42:10] that has the kind of conviction that
[42:13] preaches this kind of sanctification in
[42:16] any tapes name one ministry that has
[42:19] this kind of sanctification message
[42:21] there's not a one I just saw you know
[42:24] even though the Bible says when Peter
[42:26] and James and John were filled the Holy
[42:27] Ghost they went out and Peter saw the
[42:29] man there at the gate a beautiful he
[42:31] says he's silver and gold have I none I
[42:34] just saw a video were uh who's that a
[42:38] Billy Graham and or or Robert said he's
[42:41] a silver and gold have we much he was
[42:44] bragging how much money they had saints
[42:48] of God denomination is darkness
[42:50] absolutely when you when you reject the
[42:53] light you choose to go into full
[42:55] apostasy full darkness look at even even
[42:58] David said here's behold I was shaving
[43:00] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[43:02] mother conceive me he said to the chief
[43:04] priests of David he says you indeed
[43:07] speak righteous Oh your congregation do
[43:09] you judge uprightly o ye sons of man yeh
[43:12] in a heart ye were quickness you weigh
[43:14] the violence of your hands in the earth
[43:16] the wicked are estranged from the womb
[43:18] they go astray as soon as they are born
[43:19] speaking lies absolutely saints of God
[43:22] when we come in at that Bible study last
[43:25] week I just had this boy he said he said
[43:27] if if Satan is not all-powerful
[43:30] now remember God can exist in more than
[43:32] one location or one time at one time but
[43:34] the devil cannot he said if Satan is not
[43:38] all-powerful how come there's all these
[43:40] bad people how can how can this person
[43:42] be doing something evil here and that
[43:44] person even if there's only so many
[43:45] demons you know where I took him I took
[43:49] him to the point where the Bible says
[43:50] st. st. Paul said I find a law that evil
[43:53] that sin is present with me always amen
[43:56] in other words when we took that fall
[43:57] with Adam and Eve sin entered in and now
[44:00] the devil doesn't have to do anything
[44:02] just let this thing run its course say
[44:04] man there's a lot of time Friday I was
[44:06] not even a
[44:07] no I wanted to do wrong but this thing
[44:09] wanted to do wrong what's our greatest
[44:11] enemy it's Simon Smith
[44:13] it's our flesh we don't need the demons
[44:17] can't make you do anything they will
[44:18] talk you into it and then if you're a
[44:20] weak this thing will control you a man
[44:22] sure
[44:23] sin is already in the vessel MA and we
[44:27] must fight through that yes he's a now
[44:31] he says the the wicked are estranged
[44:34] from the roomies if they go astray as
[44:35] soon as they be born speaking lies now
[44:39] as I was thinking on these lights well
[44:43] Bruce I choose your life what do you
[44:45] mean what kind of light I'll go with the
[44:50] first one that no the one that I thought
[44:52] of real heavy here choose your light
[44:56] what lie are we gonna dwell in what kind
[44:58] of light are we gonna live in look at
[45:03] this quote here a false light cause the
[45:07] greatest the greatest robbery the world
[45:10] ever had so one of the first lights that
[45:14] you can actually live in is a false
[45:16] light when I was born my mom and daddy
[45:19] were a Catholic false light then my mom
[45:21] went his denomination false light then I
[45:23] went to the world and learn false light
[45:25] I've been a false light more my entire
[45:28] life and I was in Christian that is a
[45:32] force night cause the greatest the
[45:36] greatest Train Robbery the world ever
[45:38] had in England that longer the greatest
[45:40] robbery that was performed was done by a
[45:42] force light know something to this he
[45:47] says in the Aces is an O that the 7
[45:50] million dollar robbery was done by a
[45:51] false light that slowed the train down
[45:53] Scott your Scotland Yard's couldn't find
[45:56] the man they got away with it
[45:57] so slicky they had known the greatest
[46:00] robbery of number robbers in the natural
[46:02] around the world of its greatest robbery
[46:05] so we're dealing with a false like
[46:08] notice seven million dollars why would
[46:10] that even be in the number
[46:11] I was so special about this notice the
[46:16] Prophet 1964 picks this up and shows us
[46:19] what was so special about this
[46:21] notice the Great Train Robbery took
[46:23] place in nineteen and sixty three the
[46:25] exact same year the seven seals were
[46:27] opened up when the first five what the
[46:31] first Bible study ever taught coming to
[46:33] this message brother Craig had me
[46:34] started doing Sunday schools to help him
[46:37] he can take a break this since we back
[46:38] back forth the first one ever taught was
[46:40] called the bright heist and that what
[46:42] the whole important the entire point of
[46:44] the devil is that he can what to stri
[46:47] try and steal or trying to hinder Jesus
[46:49] Christ bright now look at this 1963 one
[46:53] of the most infamous robberies of all
[46:55] time 1963 the Great Train Robbery
[46:57] involved in the hijacking of a London
[47:00] bound train left of millions of pounds
[47:01] but noticed the name of the Train is
[47:05] Royal Mail amen and what now as the
[47:11] seals were broken as those seals were
[47:14] broken in 1963 notice the devil anointed
[47:17] and showed what he was going to try and
[47:19] do remember at these opening you see us
[47:21] what was released what 200 million
[47:23] demons focused now what and they were
[47:25] not not demons of persecution but
[47:27] ecclesiastical demons what aimed at the
[47:30] bride Amon going to steal the riches of
[47:34] the bride the royal bride late on
[47:39] Thursday August 8th 1963 a traveling
[47:43] post office left train left Glasgow for
[47:47] Houston on board staff sorted the mail
[47:50] and parcels prior to its arrival in
[47:52] London the second carriage on the front
[47:54] of the train was a high value package
[47:56] cares we're registered mail was sorted
[47:58] much of the consisted of cash usually
[48:01] the the value of these items would have
[48:02] been in the region about three hundred
[48:04] thousand pounds but cause that had been
[48:06] at the bank holiday weekend in Scotland
[48:09] the total robbery was about 2.3 million
[48:11] pounds or 30 million today all took
[48:16] place a false light sprung up to try and
[48:19] steal what 1963 it's amazing how that
[48:23] all worked
[48:24] he says the train past lightened Buzzard
[48:26] and at about 3:00 a.m. notice what it
[48:29] did it was at dark it was in the middle
[48:33] of the night
[48:34] this heist was trying to take place in
[48:38] the darkness the train past lightened
[48:46] Buzzard at about 3 a.m. on August 8th
[48:48] 1963 and moments later the driver Jack
[48:50] Mills saw a red signal ahead at a place
[48:53] called Sears Crossing the signal was
[48:55] false of blood had been stuffed into the
[48:57] proper signal and the red light was
[49:00] active I activated by attaching it to a
[49:02] six volt battery when Mills stopped his
[49:05] Colt co-driver
[49:06] David will be climbed out of the diesel
[49:08] engine to bring the singer men to us sir
[49:10] tain the problem all this took place in
[49:15] the dark thanks of God when this door
[49:19] closes when this door closes we're
[49:23] living in the dark place the band
[49:26] thought this raps would take place in
[49:27] 1977 why he could not see past it was so
[49:31] dark well brother I had this revelation
[49:33] or I had this thought and the Lord just
[49:35] showed me the scripture we better make
[49:37] sure it's not a false light we better
[49:39] not make we better make sure it's not a
[49:41] false revelation we have to go what to
[49:43] our euro Thoreau might hear and make
[49:45] sure that it runs from Genesis to
[49:46] revelations absolutely there must be
[49:49] scripture to prove it
[49:51] so if that's a false light or if that's
[49:58] a type of the false light look at this
[50:01] hearing in Matthew 13 verse 24 another
[50:03] parable put he put forth under them
[50:05] saying the kingdom of heaven is like
[50:06] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[50:08] field but while men slept his enemy came
[50:11] down I'm reading this for a reason but
[50:13] while men slept his enemy came and tared
[50:15] so tares among the wheat and went his
[50:17] way you want the Prophet said about this
[50:22] and I have a testimony about this
[50:25] because this portion of Scripture
[50:26] affected my life earlier on I'll say
[50:32] like this my dad was raised Catholic
[50:35] rough childhood just was not raised
[50:38] correctly and he suffers even today for
[50:41] it and he let it overtake him all those
[50:46] things but
[50:48] my mom and dad got together they started
[50:50] having children and my dad had a dream
[50:52] one night that in my in his dream he
[50:55] said he saw salmon cam over here and
[50:58] there were little little children at the
[51:00] time little children over there and he
[51:01] said he saw a man in black over in the
[51:04] far distance and that man of black was
[51:06] really focused on them children that
[51:09] mana black started running towards those
[51:11] children and my dad said he said no and
[51:14] he started running to try and intercept
[51:17] that man
[51:18] but then as my dad was halfway in
[51:20] between them the children and the man in
[51:23] black he said that man in black then
[51:25] turned his focus onto him and he told me
[51:28] he said Sai he was he didn't want them
[51:30] he said he wanted me and that man had
[51:33] black started chasing and running after
[51:36] my dad and he woke up absolutely
[51:37] terrified and I'll say 'la and I say
[51:39] this humbly he's been running ever since
[51:44] and my dad was given a church a book by
[51:48] me and he stumbled and he started to
[51:51] read in the church age book now notice
[51:53] we read the scripture here now notice
[51:54] what the Provost said he said I closed
[51:57] the Bible I laid it down I meditated
[51:59] awhile and prayed some more I still had
[52:01] no answer I again opened the Bible Amos
[52:03] Lee but did not read suddenly the wind
[52:05] blew into the room he says them once
[52:07] more those pages turn to Hebrews 6:13
[52:09] there as the wind ceased I read read
[52:12] those words over again and when I did
[52:15] and then the Spirit of God came into the
[52:17] room and I beheld a vision I saw in the
[52:19] vision a man dressed in a bright day he
[52:22] says dressed in the purest white who
[52:24] went forth into the freshly plowed field
[52:27] and sowed grain it was a bright day and
[52:30] the sowing was done in the morning but
[52:32] late at night after the solar white was
[52:34] gone a man in black came and stoutly
[52:39] sowed more some more seeds in among
[52:41] which the man in white had sown the day
[52:45] went by the Sun rain blessed the ground
[52:47] and one there they appeared the grain
[52:49] how it was fine but a day later appeared
[52:51] the tares also my dad had been reading
[52:56] this and he stumbled onto that he said
[52:58] the man of black it sent sent
[53:01] shivers up his body he dropped the book
[53:04] stood on his bed and he was terrified he
[53:07] said Simon he goes I don't know who this
[53:08] man is he says but he knew exactly who
[53:10] the devil was a man in black Satan
[53:17] himself right remember talking about
[53:21] false lights he says therefore behold I
[53:25] will bring strangers upon thee the
[53:27] terrible the nation's name was they
[53:28] shall draw their swords against the
[53:30] beauty thy wisdom and they shall defile
[53:32] I brightness Satan's not like this with
[53:36] the pitchfork and the longtail and the
[53:39] horses that he is the most beautiful of
[53:41] all the angels oma in fact the Bible
[53:44] says here that he was the brightness he
[53:47] calls him right he had light thine heart
[53:50] was lifted up because thy beauty now has
[53:52] corrupted I wisdom by the reason of thy
[53:55] brightness he was also Lucifer means
[53:58] what bearer of light
[53:59] I will cast me to the ground I was lady
[54:04] before Kings that they may behold thee
[54:06] this one of light ma sure he says now
[54:14] learned here talking about Satan his
[54:17] power he can assume such as aspect and
[54:21] aspect as he pleases he can disassemble
[54:23] and appeared to be eminently pious a
[54:27] false light I'm talking about religious
[54:30] life I'm not talking about worldly light
[54:32] anymore I'm not talking about black
[54:33] lights and and taking your laundry
[54:35] detergent and let liquid form then just
[54:37] let it dry out and take and what staff
[54:38] there and doing this and this sin on
[54:42] your walls shut the lights off turn a
[54:43] black light on there you got your I'm
[54:46] not talking that but kind of not that
[54:47] kind of like I'm talking about what a
[54:48] false religious lied oh my Satan himself
[54:52] the man in black but what he is also a
[54:54] bearer of light a false light he can
[54:58] disassemble it appear to be every pious
[55:00] he is the Prince of duplicity as well as
[55:05] a wickedness duplicity two ways he can
[55:09] be absolutely perfectly religious but
[55:13] all he's his whole purpose
[55:15] is to take someone to hell to two ways
[55:19] he is the principle attune implicitly as
[55:22] well as of wickedness it is the
[55:25] consummation of bad power for an
[55:27] individual to be and assume any
[55:28] character which he pleases he can play
[55:31] any part he's the perfect actor his art
[55:33] he long practice in deceitful arts for
[55:36] six thousand years even practice in the
[55:37] art of delusion and with him it is
[55:40] perfect
[55:42] he's bless you he is the false light we
[55:47] are not to be supposed that all that all
[55:50] that appears to be piety is piety saints
[55:55] of God of st. Paul the first church
[55:58] agent messenger could look at his people
[56:00] and say not all Israel is Israel we can
[56:05] say in this time not all message is
[56:09] message because remember the greatest
[56:12] light November Scott is not looking like
[56:14] darkness it is looking like light and
[56:19] this man here Gil he says he will be he
[56:24] will appear as pious some of the most
[56:29] plausible appearances of piety are
[56:32] assumed by Satan and his ministers the
[56:36] most religious looking a lot of times
[56:40] will be false none ever professed or
[56:46] profound in regard for the authority of
[56:48] God and then Satan when he tempted the
[56:51] Savior now notice this Satan appeared to
[56:55] God hidden in the flesh and he acted
[56:58] tried to act religious before the
[57:00] religion one my goodness he tried to
[57:04] show how religious he was to God in the
[57:07] flesh
[57:07] remember he knew the law he knew the
[57:09] pillar of fire he the logos but he could
[57:11] not discern that the logos had changed
[57:14] and now that living God was in him Satan
[57:18] did not know the very one his very
[57:19] creator was inside them but what front
[57:23] did he bring him a pious a religious
[57:32] no one ever professed a profounder
[57:35] regard for the four-team of god and
[57:37] satan did when he tented the Saviour
[57:40] and if the Prince of wickedness can
[57:44] appear to be an angel of light we are
[57:48] not to be surprised if those who have
[57:50] the blackest hearts appear to the people
[57:52] the blackest of hearts appear to be
[57:54] people most eminent piety so let me ask
[58:00] you something if Satan is still
[58:03] operating the way he's always operated
[58:06] an angel of light is the angel of
[58:08] darkness a fall of religiousness would
[58:14] he not come to the message
[58:18] remember programs that he says he says
[58:20] Antichrist is one word not a trinity off
[58:26] now the father suddenly goes baptism off
[58:28] one word one word that's the church age
[58:34] book and if the Prince of wickedness can
[58:37] appear to be an angel light we are not
[58:39] surprised if the black is of hearts will
[58:44] be people who have the most eminent
[58:47] piety they'll walk the perfectness walk
[58:51] we're dealing with Pharisees entities
[58:53] against things we're dealing with
[58:55] religious heads now not blessed just I'm
[59:00] just I'm just teaching this morning what
[59:03] is the definition of piety a devotion
[59:07] faith religion all religious the quality
[59:13] of the state of being pious such as the
[59:15] the fidelity of natural obligation to
[59:17] repair this obligations as you parents
[59:21] do teenis in religion devoutness satan
[59:26] will be the most devout message believer
[59:29] there is so note the quotes he'll say
[59:34] the right things he'll do the right
[59:35] things he'll act the right things but
[59:39] that is a false light
[59:42] hmm now think of God as we move in
[59:46] further into time what is the what is a
[59:48] month from now hold what is a year from
[59:50] right now hold we must have that Holy
[59:57] Ghost on the inside so much that when we
[1:00:00] see we feel something false that buzzer
[1:00:03] will go off saying to God this is life
[1:00:07] and death those those were message times
[1:00:10] those message whatever you want to call
[1:00:14] it it's over clay and Church is over
[1:00:17] it's now time to move in to the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost like we've never moved into him
[1:00:23] before we just had a brother came and
[1:00:25] preached and the one thing that stuck he
[1:00:27] says jesus said if my words abide in you
[1:00:29] and you abide in me if you abide in me
[1:00:33] think on that let that soak they need me
[1:00:35] so hard that let it abide in if you
[1:00:38] abide in me what walking in his words
[1:00:42] the confines of his word if the Bible
[1:00:45] says this I'm right there if the Bible
[1:00:47] says that I'm gonna be right here if the
[1:00:48] Bible says if there's two ways right
[1:00:50] here what does the Bible say on which
[1:00:51] one I'm gonna go here what if the Bible
[1:00:53] say anything what if it's a bad thing
[1:00:54] then I'm gonna pray I'm gonna take a
[1:00:57] step and say Lord guide my footsteps say
[1:00:59] my yes sir he says we should be on guard
[1:01:06] we should not listen to suggestions
[1:01:08] merely because they appear to come from
[1:01:10] a pious man well so-and-so this pastor
[1:01:14] said this brother sigh and this preacher
[1:01:17] said this and this let me one thing I've
[1:01:20] learned since I've been in this message
[1:01:23] I will let the Holy Ghost lead me okay I
[1:01:29] hear what you're saying I hear you're
[1:01:30] saying I heard what they said I heard it
[1:01:32] doesn't matter to me what does the whole
[1:01:34] what is what is God's will for your life
[1:01:36] brother and your sister brother sister
[1:01:39] the hope each one of us has a ministry
[1:01:42] each one of us has a testimony each one
[1:01:45] of us has something gifts and callings
[1:01:47] to do for our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:01:48] Christ and you I we are all accountable
[1:01:53] for what we do
[1:01:55] well on judgement day well Lord well
[1:01:59] so-and-so said this and I heard that
[1:02:01] because they this other big name
[1:02:03] preachers preach this and I and I kind
[1:02:05] of went with no if you abide in my words
[1:02:11] he said Jesus he said we should not
[1:02:19] listen to suggestions merely because
[1:02:22] they appear to come from a pious man or
[1:02:24] because they seem to be prompted by the
[1:02:26] regard to the will of God we must be
[1:02:30] careful how someone uses a scripture
[1:02:32] towards us he says we must we may be
[1:02:37] always sure that if we are to be tempted
[1:02:40] it will be by someone having great
[1:02:42] appearance of virtue and religion
[1:02:47] because of the looking right you know
[1:02:50] feel right oh my those words and he said
[1:02:52] Wow powerful Wow praise be to God and
[1:02:55] this ananthan but is it of the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost sugar sweet taste great
[1:03:03] honey's real good too but what's inside
[1:03:06] that honey was there anything added to
[1:03:08] that sugar was there anything end to
[1:03:09] that honey that Jesus would touch that's
[1:03:11] not the oil on the wine was there
[1:03:13] anything added to that wine that
[1:03:14] stimulation was a pure wine amen
[1:03:19] I'm not I'm not trying to be hard I'm
[1:03:21] just I'm just let you know now he says
[1:03:23] we are not expected to that Satan will
[1:03:26] appear to man to be as bad as he is he
[1:03:30] will never show himself openly to be a
[1:03:33] spirit of pure wickedness or black and
[1:03:37] abomino in his character or a form of
[1:03:39] evil in hateful he's not like that
[1:03:41] he will not why because no one likes
[1:03:43] people your being around a negative
[1:03:44] person every around someone that just
[1:03:46] constantly picks on you mean to your
[1:03:48] listeners
[1:03:48] no one wants to be around that person
[1:03:50] and Satan knows that so he's never going
[1:03:54] to come at you like that
[1:03:55] he is going to come and just we prayed
[1:04:03] up I know
[1:04:06] have you read your Bible because I don't
[1:04:08] have he's gonna come religious using the
[1:04:13] scripture using the words using
[1:04:16] sweetness and kindness they say I'm just
[1:04:20] reading here from guilt this manage
[1:04:22] manage not even eagle yet he was thus
[1:04:27] defeat himself if he would reveal
[1:04:29] himself as a darkness the dark that he
[1:04:31] is but he does not come like that it is
[1:04:36] for this reason that wicked people do
[1:04:38] not believe that there is such a person
[1:04:40] such a being as Satan though continually
[1:04:43] under his influence and led captive by
[1:04:45] him at his will he says yet they neither
[1:04:49] see him nor the change which would lead
[1:04:51] them nor are they willing to believe in
[1:04:53] the existence of one or the other that's
[1:04:58] the false light that's okay that's
[1:05:01] flight number one we still got three
[1:05:03] more to go so just be careful here is
[1:05:12] that a dangerous fight that's extremely
[1:05:14] dangerous flight is there more dangerous
[1:05:19] flights absolutely let's get into it
[1:05:23] here now the Prophet said there was
[1:05:25] three lights and now this is what we're
[1:05:27] gonna go into but but as I was thinking
[1:05:29] on those things and whatever I thought
[1:05:30] about that false light Satan becoming a
[1:05:32] false making his ministers even
[1:05:35] ministers of light of righteousness he
[1:05:38] can turn himself into an angel light and
[1:05:40] I thought I said man that's a deception
[1:05:42] right there big time but now where's the
[1:05:46] other light there's another light coming
[1:05:47] I'm not talking about the light I'm
[1:05:49] talking another light here and as we've
[1:05:55] always worked with the tabernacle you
[1:06:01] know everything you know you know how
[1:06:02] the preaching of the word comes and just
[1:06:03] we hit one thing and boom something else
[1:06:05] opens and this opens and saints of God
[1:06:07] ten years ago revelation wise how have
[1:06:12] you been compared to now right now we
[1:06:16] are 10 years ahead
[1:06:18] understanding revelation knowledge we
[1:06:22] are growing in the knowledge and stature
[1:06:24] of Christ so all these things we want to
[1:06:27] incorporate these things we want to keep
[1:06:28] these things at the back or right side
[1:06:30] at the tip of our tongue it replaced
[1:06:32] right in our heart but as we studied the
[1:06:35] tabernacle I never thought of it like
[1:06:38] quite like this he says now look what
[1:06:41] the Prophet says on a hidden life 1955
[1:06:44] another thing we will call your
[1:06:45] attention just before we close look at
[1:06:48] the light on the outside in the courts
[1:06:53] it was the firmament that lit it up
[1:06:56] sunlight and so forth some days was
[1:07:04] cloudy some days the Sun didn't shine
[1:07:07] off some days it was dark now that's a
[1:07:12] knee out of court
[1:07:16] where are we living now we're talking
[1:07:20] about the Church of God here we're not
[1:07:22] talking about
[1:07:23] Satan's Eden or this or that we're
[1:07:25] talking when we come to the house of God
[1:07:27] what court have we been dwelling in
[1:07:31] because never that upper court it was
[1:07:34] wide open to the sky and they would get
[1:07:38] in there but their sacrifice and there'd
[1:07:40] be the the altar of a the brass altar
[1:07:43] the brass slabber and whenever that
[1:07:46] would happen it could it could rain in
[1:07:48] that place and they get wet
[1:07:51] the elements of the nature of the
[1:07:55] seasons could affect that court right
[1:07:57] there they could look at the Stars and
[1:08:01] blinking and twinkling and all those
[1:08:03] things the Sun would come up the moon
[1:08:05] they could see all that thing but it
[1:08:09] would go through seasons you have her
[1:08:11] seasons they're black and dark and light
[1:08:14] and cloudy overcast like our lives this
[1:08:21] goes through it some days this thing is
[1:08:23] I'm getting old I'm starting to
[1:08:24] understand this you get pains your pains
[1:08:28] maybe huh knees elbows I'm a plumber
[1:08:32] weird on my knees all the time knees
[1:08:33] hurt now there are three courts the
[1:08:40] justified man out there he was walking
[1:08:42] by daylight some days he has gloomy days
[1:08:46] you get it oh I hope you see this god
[1:08:49] bless you some days are gloomy some days
[1:08:51] you don't know whether this is even
[1:08:52] worthwhile to serve God or not yet in
[1:08:56] the house of God saved man I don't even

[1:10:53] powerful types in it what kind of life
[1:10:56] are you walking according to the weather
[1:11:00] let me share this three weeks ago I had
[1:11:04] to do the most dangerous job I ever had
[1:11:05] to do that's 40 foot up walking to Z
[1:11:08] Gertz on it on that on a metal building
[1:11:10] tight off only because the things
[1:11:12] flipped over there's really in fact that
[1:11:14] slipped off a couple of times and I had
[1:11:16] to walk like this because there's so
[1:11:18] much machinery I couldn't get a lift up
[1:11:20] there and I had the one-handed I was
[1:11:22] holding on by one hand I'd had my tools
[1:11:24] drill a hole in the Z Gert put my tool
[1:11:28] pier and then I had to try and get my
[1:11:31] elbow because I'm so short elbow on top
[1:11:33] of the Aussie Gert to hold myself as I
[1:11:35] put in the hanger and then we had to I
[1:11:37] had to wrestle pipe through the hangers
[1:11:40] and I did that for two days really not
[1:11:46] even tied off I'm just walking it and I
[1:11:49] had to bust through fear like you've
[1:11:51] never and I'm not captain huh I told the
[1:11:54] brother I said I'm an eagle but I
[1:11:55] haven't learned how to fly yet okay so I
[1:11:59] want to let you know we're I could I had
[1:12:02] to pray through the entire time and as
[1:12:05] these little trials at work are coming
[1:12:07] more and more seems like constant I find
[1:12:09] myself having to pray through more and
[1:12:11] more and push through no matter how this
[1:12:13] feels I am moving forward I am not
[1:12:16] calling off work I'm gonna get this job
[1:12:17] done and then I'll tell you this at the
[1:12:19] end of the day we put a pressure test on
[1:12:20] it in the leaked at the worst spot but
[1:12:24] God sent another man I climbed up that
[1:12:29] 40-foot ladder got up there how long
[1:12:31] with one hand the other guy had to climb
[1:12:33] up now he didn't have to do it before
[1:12:35] but now he had you
[1:12:35] he had to climb up and he was arranged
[1:12:37] here the pipe on what he had wrench on
[1:12:39] one pipe and I had on the other and we
[1:12:41] unthreaded it while one guy was holding
[1:12:43] that ladder that was the that was key
[1:12:45] because it was in like a slick plant I
[1:12:48] mean the floors were slick and that
[1:12:49] ladder so we had done do it fixed it and
[1:12:52] we're out last day but you will have I'm
[1:12:55] telling you God is going to put you to
[1:12:57] the test and you must pray through
[1:12:59] cannot give up we are overcomers on
[1:13:06] Judgment Day
[1:13:07] well Lord I really couldn't do this in
[1:13:09] Jesus I went to the cross was beaten
[1:13:12] whipped and I died for you and I was
[1:13:19] sinless what will we say on that day he
[1:13:24] says what kind of life are you walking
[1:13:26] according to the weather it will give
[1:13:28] light outside the gloomy the foggy the
[1:13:30] halfway then a bright day and then a
[1:13:32] gloomy or foggy a cloud limit Ohio it's
[1:13:35] taking the cloud state cloud over Sun
[1:13:37] that's just the way the dream the
[1:13:38] regenerated justified man lives that's
[1:13:41] right that's all the light he has to
[1:13:43] walk in that's but when just when he
[1:13:46] walks by that by that that suggested by
[1:13:49] man are they're justified meant in this
[1:13:52] message women absolutely but over the
[1:13:58] brand of my ups and downs all mine I'm
[1:14:00] the most miserable person I have to
[1:14:03] fight every day welcome to the battle he
[1:14:06] says oh yes brother water you walk
[1:14:08] that's where you're walking that's
[1:14:10] alright he's in the outer courts but
[1:14:15] he's a Christian he's saved but look at
[1:14:17] the very life they're living up and down
[1:14:21] short on money this anise snake explode
[1:14:23] this this heavenly explode no no no look
[1:14:31] he's here now
[1:14:32] the next court was the lamp of God
[1:14:36] remember they entered the holy place
[1:14:39] that was covered it was not affected by
[1:14:42] the outside natural realms and there was
[1:14:46] actually a Sevenfold candlestick light
[1:14:48] that lit up the whole place he said the
[1:14:54] next court of the lamp of God were the
[1:14:56] justified stand and it was lit by human
[1:14:58] hands notice I like how he said that
[1:15:02] Norse he said it was lit by human hand I
[1:15:07] wonder a lot of times our youth go to
[1:15:11] youth meetings and they come there
[1:15:13] fired up there but as soon as they get
[1:15:16] back they die down was it lit by man
[1:15:20] hands or did they really get in the
[1:15:24] presence of God and notice that's where
[1:15:29] we argue our denominations let's just
[1:15:32] say our message doctrines where we argue
[1:15:35] our differences on Theo fanuc substance
[1:15:38] or spiritual things like that let hairs
[1:15:42] well brother if you don't do this and
[1:15:43] that you can't come and teach for us you
[1:15:45] were here I know brother right now that
[1:15:47] does not agree with a certain doctrine
[1:15:49] that said well brother you can't
[1:15:50] interpret for us anymore because you
[1:15:51] don't agree with us on this and it's not
[1:15:53] even a Salvation issue in the message
[1:15:56] the hour oh I don't believe in divine
[1:16:00] healing I don't believe that visions
[1:16:02] come from God I don't believe this I
[1:16:03] don't believe that you're arguing
[1:16:05] because you're living yeah you're eating
[1:16:07] manna what there was there was there was
[1:16:09] 12 shoe dreads right in the holy place
[1:16:11] they were eating prepared by the priests
[1:16:14] not even by God but this was God
[1:16:16] ordained men they made these these these
[1:16:19] these Manas just these pieces of bread
[1:16:21] just for those they were able to get in
[1:16:23] the holy place and there was light there
[1:16:26] he says you're arguing because you're
[1:16:28] living yet you're eating manna but
[1:16:30] you're living under artificial light why
[1:16:34] because that light went out later on
[1:16:36] that light can go out if then priests
[1:16:40] failed to get oil numb laughs they'll go
[1:16:43] out he said that's right sometimes the
[1:16:46] light goes out sometimes your lamp gets
[1:16:48] smoked up my goodness where's that take
[1:16:51] you why isn't foolish virgin let me let
[1:16:54] me ask you this master 25 Bible says and
[1:16:58] at midnight there was a cry and all the
[1:17:01] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps I
[1:17:05] wonder where the bride is even living at
[1:17:07] the coming of the Lord if they have to
[1:17:10] trim their lamps ma he says you're
[1:17:17] arming because you're living yeah you're
[1:17:19] eating manna
[1:17:20] he said you're living under artificial
[1:17:22] light that's right sometimes the lights
[1:17:23] go sometimes your lamp gets smoked up
[1:17:25] but - he
[1:17:26] who desires to be hit away walks into
[1:17:29] the next place he says there's no
[1:17:30] artificial light anyway hey man he says
[1:17:37] well then you say well I want to go a
[1:17:38] little deeper well he comes into the
[1:17:41] court now what's in there there are
[1:17:42] seven golden candlesticks by the holy
[1:17:45] place and it's giving light the
[1:17:47] candlesticks are giving light notice
[1:17:48] what are these remember pastor Jess he's
[1:17:51] actually doing a book on the on the
[1:17:52] twelve pieces of shewbread the twelve
[1:17:56] mysteries contained in the New Testament
[1:17:58] so a Christian could be in that holy
[1:18:00] place eating all the mysteries contained
[1:18:03] in this message and contained in the
[1:18:06] Word of God and still not be in the
[1:18:09] light amazing that's to the man who
[1:18:16] quits quits to his drinking quit smoking
[1:18:20] quit slang quit stealing treats his
[1:18:22] neighbor right good to his wife or her
[1:18:25] good to her husband the same way man a
[1:18:27] woman to believer he has to come into
[1:18:29] place where is to quit all his meanness
[1:18:32] which is through the blood the
[1:18:35] sanctification he is called to the new
[1:18:37] life he walks in there he don't have to
[1:18:39] walk by the light out there he's got a
[1:18:41] better light he's walking by the light
[1:18:43] of seven golden candlesticks which is
[1:18:44] burning olive oil this is a better staff
[1:18:47] you could go from a false light where I
[1:18:49] was at
[1:18:50] you could go what to the light on the
[1:18:51] firmament where I was at at one time in
[1:18:53] denomination even into the message when
[1:18:55] I first got the heard the message I got
[1:18:57] baptized in one o'clock in the morning
[1:18:59] but I did not receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:01] till a year and a half later he says he
[1:19:04] didn't have to walk by that light out
[1:19:06] there he got a better light he's walking
[1:19:07] by the light of seven golden
[1:19:09] candlesticks which is the burning olive
[1:19:11] oil amen and the olive oil is
[1:19:13] representing the Holy Ghost the fire was
[1:19:16] the baptisms baptize you working or you
[1:19:19] can baptize in there get the holy spirit
[1:19:22] but you're not hid away yet you're not
[1:19:24] behind the veil here he is he is walking
[1:19:27] in these seven golden candlesticks there
[1:19:29] is many lights or much light in there
[1:19:32] but there's days when their lights get
[1:19:35] dull there's days when them lamps smoke
[1:19:37] and that light is not so good
[1:19:40] there is times when them lights have to
[1:19:42] be real it's again and you have to
[1:19:45] borrow a little from a neighbor to light
[1:19:46] one candle to another one hmm
[1:19:51] man whenever I get around this brother
[1:19:53] of this sister I just feel whoo whoo we
[1:19:56] should feel like that without being
[1:19:58] around the brother and sister we should
[1:19:59] be in that atmosphere all the time amen
[1:20:03] we should have so much virtue we can
[1:20:06] bless anyone at any time
[1:20:09] spiritually he says it's still not a
[1:20:12] good light we're thankful for it yes a
[1:20:15] manthe god but it's still not the right
[1:20:18] light all brother oh brother see that
[1:20:21] it's still not the right light but
[1:20:25] notice I'll say like this what is the
[1:20:28] message of the hour then not both the
[1:20:33] last two lights come with the message of
[1:20:35] the hour I'll say like this all three of
[1:20:40] these lights come with the message the
[1:20:41] hour because on that outer court was the
[1:20:43] true baptism and repentance that is
[1:20:46] taught sadly in the best in this message
[1:20:49] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ amen
[1:20:53] that is taught right here in this
[1:20:55] message then as we moved in what did the
[1:20:57] prophets are bringing forward now the
[1:20:58] mysteries contain the seven seals the
[1:21:01] serpent seed the Gentile the station the
[1:21:04] rapture all those things now I brought
[1:21:06] but the promise that that was not the
[1:21:09] message he was supposed to unwrap all
[1:21:12] the missed mysteries bring forth all the
[1:21:14] mysteries absolutely but he said what
[1:21:15] was the main thing Jesus Christ he says
[1:21:24] you say brother while I spoke in tongues
[1:21:26] I shouted good wonderful but let me tell
[1:21:28] you something different all right he's
[1:21:30] walking in the light it's an artificial
[1:21:31] light it's not the light of the Sun the
[1:21:34] light of the Moon the Stars the man in
[1:21:36] the justify courts when night comes he
[1:21:38] is a very dim light he just sees the
[1:21:39] Stars and maybe a pale moon a lot of
[1:21:41] flying clouds he's in an awful fix but
[1:21:44] the man up there at the altar he keeps
[1:21:46] give himself under consecration it says
[1:21:48] Lord I'm going to live right by you
[1:21:52] was he was to abide in Christ amen his
[1:21:54] words are him and he's in Christ amen
[1:21:56] yes sir he's not going to live go to my
[1:21:59] neighbor I'm going to try my best to do
[1:22:01] better Lord
[1:22:02] well he's living in a better place his
[1:22:04] lights out him goes out but they do
[1:22:06] smoke up and they have to light one from
[1:22:09] another just like I said here with the
[1:22:14] Virgin's that light will kick into the
[1:22:19] end it will but I do like this as a
[1:22:26] pastor Jesse one time talked about the
[1:22:28] four kinds of grounds that the Bible we
[1:22:34] get to read from word Matthew 13:24 22
[1:22:37] I'm sorry four kinds of grounds that the
[1:22:41] Word of God falls into and here's the
[1:22:44] second to last one he also that received
[1:22:46] seed among the thorns is he that heareth
[1:22:49] the word in the cares of this world and
[1:22:52] the deceitfulness of riches what in
[1:22:54] Laodicea no other age has this kind of
[1:22:58] money this kind of power this kind of
[1:23:00] wealth this kind of material increase
[1:23:02] like Miss age the deceitfulness of
[1:23:10] riches choke the word and are become
[1:23:14] unfruitful this is art this is like this
[1:23:17] is where I want to focus on is I want I
[1:23:19] do not want this because what the next
[1:23:23] is that he receives in the good ground
[1:23:25] is he that receipt here in the word
[1:23:26] here's the word and understandeth it
[1:23:28] which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[1:23:31] forth some one hundredfold some sixty
[1:23:32] some thirty but I like how Luke brings
[1:23:35] us out and that which fell among the
[1:23:38] thorns are they which have heard go
[1:23:40] forth and our choked notice the reason
[1:23:43] they're choked is because of these with
[1:23:46] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[1:23:49] life and bring no bring no fruit to
[1:23:52] perfection there in the holy place but
[1:23:59] they're not there
[1:24:01] and then of course Saints the holiest of
[1:24:04] holies as they move beyond that veil and
[1:24:09] that veil shut behind them they no
[1:24:13] longer saw the light I'll say like this
[1:24:17] what's more powerful the seven golden
[1:24:18] candlesticks light or the presence of
[1:24:21] the Shekinah glory do you think the high
[1:24:25] priest and time could look back and see
[1:24:27] through the cracks light no because
[1:24:29] there was so much in life inside this
[1:24:32] place it was lit up by itself
[1:24:34] hey man praise God he says father and
[1:24:46] Jesus name receive us now we ask the
[1:24:48] Holy Ghost to come upon us and to bless
[1:24:50] us and to give us that which we are
[1:24:51] asking for today may the great up
[1:24:54] limited power of God moving to us just
[1:24:56] now and may the Shekinah glory o God
[1:24:58] that dwelt under the interlocking wings
[1:25:01] of the cherubim may it dwell under the
[1:25:05] interlocking wings
[1:25:06] he started the interlocking arms of the
[1:25:10] cross hmm a pastor been teaching on
[1:25:20] moving into the presence of God and the
[1:25:23] reason I had this light up here look at
[1:25:30] look at Hebrews 94 which had the golden
[1:25:34] censer and the Ark of the Covenant
[1:25:38] overlaid roundabout with gold right when
[1:25:42] was the golden pot that had manna
[1:25:45] Aaron's rod button and the table of
[1:25:48] Covenant so all those had meanings our
[1:25:50] pastures went through him and over it
[1:25:53] the cherubims of glory overshadowing the
[1:25:57] mercy seat of which we cannot now
[1:26:01] particularly speak st. Paul did not know
[1:26:03] what those cherubims meant he says well
[1:26:06] we don't know the interpret I do not
[1:26:08] know the interpretation of those but
[1:26:11] brother Branham brought forth
[1:26:14] Oh God that dwell under the interlocking
[1:26:18] wings of the cherubim may it come under
[1:26:21] the interlocking arms of the cross he
[1:26:24] said it represented the cross of Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ which is what the blood came a
[1:26:31] man all the way through the scripture
[1:26:35] the woman was what the widow one was
[1:26:37] what gathering two sticks to start that
[1:26:40] fire to make her last meal right David
[1:26:43] the prophet but he was it was two sticks
[1:26:44] and the problems that look the cross but
[1:26:48] down in between the arc of the wings of
[1:26:51] these cherubims was a holy halo light
[1:26:52] hanging in there which was the halo of
[1:26:54] God that lit the whole room and a man
[1:26:59] that once entered into that Shekinah
[1:27:01] glory hallelujah Jesus that moves back
[1:27:03] there in the presence of the Almighty
[1:27:05] God brother he's at night he says the
[1:27:07] dimness of this world any artificial
[1:27:09] organizations and all man-made increse
[1:27:11] had passed away and he's living in the
[1:27:14] Shekinah glory of God of the Almighty
[1:27:16] God hey man but the man who walks beyond
[1:27:22] that and goes in when the world is shut
[1:27:24] off and the veil drops down around him
[1:27:26] down under the locking wings of the
[1:27:29] cherubim the grace kind of glory hung
[1:27:31] out there and never got damaged never
[1:27:33] went out and the man who lives in the
[1:27:36] presence of God under the veil lives in
[1:27:39] the Shekinah glory I I don't care if the
[1:27:42] storms are raging or the clouds or the
[1:27:45] moon don't shine or the standard
[1:27:47] startled shine see that's when this
[1:27:49] thing starts when the door is shut and
[1:27:51] these great things start taking place on
[1:27:53] the earth what if the bride is still
[1:27:55] there we see the Sun that shining the
[1:27:57] moon not giving her light it won't
[1:27:59] matter we're living in the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] earthquakes hit LA it doesn't matter
[1:28:05] we're living in the Holy Ghost they
[1:28:07] start rounding up Christians it does not
[1:28:08] matter we're living in that light the
[1:28:11] Holy Ghost sliding on no matter what
[1:28:14] takes place the economy crashes what are
[1:28:16] we gonna go by if they shut down all the
[1:28:19] stores they already did shut down
[1:28:22] everything they left a little bit open
[1:28:25] to see what would happen
[1:28:27] to test what would we buy what would
[1:28:30] they do what would do this you see what
[1:28:32] they're setting the stage here what if
[1:28:34] this time they drop a disease so big it
[1:28:39] shuts everything down what you eat how
[1:28:43] are we gonna stress out and ah no it
[1:28:49] doesn't matter if we eat or not
[1:28:51] Jesus what Jesus said what in Matthew 4
[1:28:54] he says man shall not live by bread
[1:28:56] alone but by every word of God what if
[1:28:59] there's coming a time
[1:29:00] well we'll be out with no food and I
[1:29:02] will read the Bible and our bellies are
[1:29:03] start getting filled is it possible
[1:29:07] possible we're gonna the Prophet said he
[1:29:12] said when this third pole hits he says
[1:29:13] we're going to see things we've never
[1:29:14] even imagined before Christ came on the
[1:29:19] scene could they even imagine someone
[1:29:22] walking on water someone breaking fish
[1:29:25] and loaves and multiplying food what's
[1:29:30] next do not put a limit on Jesus Christ
[1:29:35] the Holy Ghost is going to perform
[1:29:37] things that is going to be spectacular
[1:29:42] it'll literally be out of this world
[1:29:44] I think this it'll be beyond natural
[1:29:48] it'll be called supernatural I mean and
[1:29:52] the man who lived in the presence of God
[1:29:54] under the veil lives in the Shekinah
[1:29:55] glory I don't care if the stores are
[1:29:57] raising the clouds the moon don't shine
[1:29:58] all those things he's living in the
[1:30:00] Shekinah glory God under the power of
[1:30:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:03] it didn't go out at night it didn't go
[1:30:05] out it's a kind of a mystic light kind
[1:30:08] of soft glowing light and the believer
[1:30:10] arrest walks around inside the veil
[1:30:13] though she kind of where the pot of
[1:30:15] manna was where he ate daily never give
[1:30:19] out he ate the manna he says oh my and
[1:30:22] we know those are the greatest mysteries
[1:30:25] right there anybody can eat the
[1:30:29] mysteries we've heard but there's coming
[1:30:31] things hidden in the word that's going
[1:30:32] to open up that's going to be beyond
[1:30:34] that can only come from the Shekinah
[1:30:36] glory amen let's stand
[1:30:40] how'd you almost an hour here hope
[1:30:43] that's alright and saints of God we all
[1:30:50] have loved ones we all have people we've
[1:30:56] grown up with known before and after us
[1:30:59] that we all love and we want to make
[1:31:02] sure that not only do we live in and
[1:31:06] choose the correct light to live in but
[1:31:10] we want to push others and pull others
[1:31:12] into the glorious light of this word
[1:31:15] into that I think it's the baptism of
[1:31:17] the Holy Ghost these mysteries are great
[1:31:20] but we must receive and make sure we
[1:31:22] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:31:25] says whether your children are this way
[1:31:27] and your mother is this way your daddy
[1:31:29] is that way I can say that whether your
[1:31:31] pastor said that whether the doctor said
[1:31:34] this for that you don't even hear it
[1:31:37] my dad sits on his he's on the third
[1:31:40] floor of his apartment he's got a little
[1:31:42] overhang here I like I called the Eagles
[1:31:45] Nest it's like a balcony and he sits
[1:31:47] like this and he smokes but when I go
[1:31:51] over there all I see is a full fill the
[1:31:55] son of god pull the Holy Ghost because
[1:31:58] that's what I believe I'm not looking at
[1:32:00] what I'm seeing I'm looking at what I
[1:32:03] want to see and what the Bible says I
[1:32:05] could have I wanted I I believe I
[1:32:09] believe I see something that God said
[1:32:11] could be done I see someone that's
[1:32:14] bribed my momma stuck in denomination
[1:32:17] hair cut like this in this key we got
[1:32:19] color Anderson is wearing short pants I
[1:32:21] mean it's just but I see a daughter fold
[1:32:24] the Holy Ghost and I treat her
[1:32:27] accordingly well brother size it doesn't
[1:32:30] matter I don't see that

[1:37:11] that he will perform everything he
[1:37:14] promised in our lives for us and with us
[1:37:18] he does not lie
[1:37:20] just give him some time Leon he is
[1:37:25] faithful he defeated the devil 2,000
[1:37:27] years ago like he said he would 4000
