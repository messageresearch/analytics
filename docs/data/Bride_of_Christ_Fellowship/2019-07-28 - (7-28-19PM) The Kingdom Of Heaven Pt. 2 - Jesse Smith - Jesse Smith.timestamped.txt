[28:41] look at the kingdom of heaven part two
[28:42] tonight this is the real message of
[28:47] encouragement no this morning was a
[28:48] message of scouring out
[28:57] you
[29:09] you
[29:11] our visitors will not be coming tonight
[29:13] so I just read into heaven will give
[29:17] them rest they had some worn-out reps 19
[29:25] 20 I'll read verse 20 and then we'll all
[29:29] read verse 21 verse 20 says that when he
[29:32] was demanded the Pharisees when the
[29:34] kingdom of God should come he answered
[29:35] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[29:38] not with observation now it's all read
[29:40] verse 21 together on three one two three
[29:44] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[29:47] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[29:50] with me let's have one more word of
[29:53] Prayer as Bart it's here Heavenly Father
[29:55] Lord we're thankful for the kingdom of
[29:57] heaven that's come down to earth Lord oh
[29:59] yes we give you glory we thank you that
[30:01] it's power it and it's joined the Holy
[30:04] Ghost and it's joy unspeakable and full
[30:06] of glory in our souls oh god father we
[30:09] just pray Lord you give us a fresh look
[30:11] at this here tonight encourage our
[30:13] hearts Lord God I know you will because
[30:15] your word is so powerful Lord they meet
[30:17] every need Lord may we just find our
[30:20] position in this great Kingdom or that
[30:22] will be a part of the future Kingdom
[30:24] father that would we know we'll get to
[30:26] live with you forever Lord God and
[30:28] always be before your face smart as your
[30:30] as your wife as your bride the scripture
[30:32] says we just want to be close to you
[30:34] Lord yes
[30:35] by your grace and your mercy by the
[30:37] blood of Christ
[30:38] in Jesus Christ's name the terrset amen
[30:41] god bless you be in see the praise the
[30:43] Lord so let's look I've got a good Bible
[30:53] study here tonight looking forward to
[30:54] this here I just want a real quick
[30:58] review part one from last week I just
[31:01] wanted to sit maybe one minute remember
[31:03] the word Kingdom means ruled or domain
[31:06] or realm
[31:07] okay so when Jesus says the kingdom of
[31:11] God is within you he's meaning the realm
[31:13] of heaven
[31:18] is in you that's what the Bible says the
[31:22] authority we don't have power we have
[31:24] authority so the authority of God is in
[31:28] us that Dominion that rule the realm so
[31:32] we're ruled by the Holy Spirit right we
[31:34] live our lives by the Holy Spirit that's
[31:36] the kingdom of God in you last week we
[31:39] saw how he already has made us kings and
[31:42] priests so once you've got the spirit of
[31:44] the kingdom in you now you're a teen
[31:47] king that hangs over Sid praise guy and
[31:51] you're a king in brief so he starts by
[31:53] putting you into the kingdom and then
[31:55] when you're in the kingdom now you're a
[31:56] king and now you're a priest or queen
[31:58] we'd say as a as a sister so now what
[32:03] man tells us plainly I didn't read this
[32:05] last week but my man tells us plainly
[32:06] that acts 2:38 is the way to the kingdom
[32:09] this is the falling apart of the world
[32:12] December 16 1962 he said God's kingdom
[32:16] is not of this world when Christ was
[32:17] here to give us the program of his
[32:19] kingdom he gave us the program of God's
[32:21] kingdom the father's kingdom which is
[32:23] his work now if you want to know how to
[32:25] get the kingdom that's or this words got
[32:28] it he said you cannot come into any
[32:30] other door he says Peter on the day of
[32:34] Pentecost opened the door to the kingdom
[32:36] the kingdom had just been set up at
[32:38] Jerusalem he said I want some man to
[32:41] tell me that church begin at Rome I want
[32:43] somebody improve that to me the church
[32:45] never began in Rome
[32:46] it began in Jerusalem the kingdom was
[32:49] set up on the day of Pentecost Peter
[32:50] said repent he said and when men wanted
[32:53] to know how to get into this kingdom he
[32:55] said we'd met everyone you'd be baptized
[32:57] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[32:59] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost cuz
[33:01] that's what puts them into the kingdom
[33:03] and the other policy is a false messiah
[33:06] amen
[33:07] no matter what you are pastor Bishop
[33:10] whatever you are it's false til you come
[33:12] back to God's humble lamb and his baby
[33:17] shouting Lori this is all the key this
[33:21] how you get the kingdom by acts 2:38 and
[33:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we also
[33:26] saw last week how the kingdom of heaven
[33:27] the kingdom of God or what in the
[33:29] because Jesus gave Peter the keys to the
[33:31] kingdom of heaven but then he said the
[33:33] kingdom of God is within you
[33:35] praise God so there's all those
[33:37] scriptures I guess I can look at him
[33:39] real briefly here so the kingdom of God
[33:41] Jesus said you're not far from the
[33:44] kingdom of God Jesus preached the
[33:46] kingdom of heaven jesus said you're not
[33:48] far from the kingdom of God the ten
[33:50] virgins heard the voice to the kingdom
[33:52] of heaven and Peter had the keys the
[33:56] Holy Ghost to the kingdom of heaven so
[33:58] we have kingdom of God II know the
[33:59] heaven they're all within the same you
[34:00] know the same thing we saw that last
[34:02] week and it's gonna take and we go to
[34:05] that it's gonna take all your strength
[34:07] to press into the peanut of God it's
[34:10] gonna take all of our effort right all
[34:12] of our human strength jesus said you
[34:13] must love it with all your strength and
[34:16] those who are part of the kingdom press
[34:18] into the kingdom of God that's why
[34:20] you're here tonight right pressing the
[34:21] kingdom of God you could be anywhere
[34:23] else
[34:24] well you're here to press in the kingdom
[34:26] of God and then jesus said the Apostles
[34:29] will be appointed a portion of that
[34:31] kingdom because they continued with
[34:33] Jesus and we actually our last scripture
[34:36] you read last week was second
[34:37] Thessalonians 1:5 we must be counted
[34:39] worthy of the kingdom so once you once
[34:42] you get the call of the kingdom you got
[34:43] to live a life worthy of the kingdom now
[34:46] let's look at the second part now that's
[34:49] when we turn a lot of scriptures tonight
[34:51] so have your Bibles handy let's start a
[34:53] revelation 11:15 no Wendy and I were
[34:55] talking about this between services but
[34:58] there's two kinds of kingdoms there's
[35:00] earthly kingdoms and then there's
[35:01] heavenly kingdoms so let's look at this
[35:03] scripture like we know like on the steel
[35:07] I'm sorry the Steel Curtain you know
[35:09] Russia right the bamboo curtain China
[35:11] and the purple curtain the Catholic
[35:14] Church two of those are physical right I
[35:17] guess you could argue mannequins both
[35:20] they gotta have a natural Kingdom and
[35:23] the atmosphere cioppino
[35:24] but those are all those are natural
[35:26] except vatican is the cage of unclean
[35:29] and hateful bird that's a spiritual
[35:30] peanut it's revelation 11:15 now this is
[35:35] a great scripture here and the seventh
[35:38] angel sounded and there were voices in
[35:40] Heaven's
[35:40] the kingdoms of this world are become
[35:42] the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
[35:44] Christ he shall reign forever and ever
[35:46] so right now it's the kingdoms of this
[35:49] world
[35:49] all right the natural Pinos United
[35:51] States China Russia like we said and
[35:54] then the Vatican those are natural
[35:56] earthly kingdoms but then Jesus makes a
[36:00] peculiar statement in John 18:36 he's
[36:04] being questioned idly by Pilate
[36:05] Sir John 18:36 I just like to read it
[36:11] they don't have all these memorized to
[36:17] ask them are you the King of the Jews
[36:21] and then in verse let's go to John 1835
[36:26] Pilate answered and said am ia Jew but
[36:28] no nation and the chief priests have
[36:30] delivered be unto me what has God done
[36:32] and jesus said My Kingdom is not of this
[36:35] world if my kingdom were of this world
[36:38] then would my servants fight that I
[36:42] should not be delivered to the Jews but
[36:44] now is my kingdom not from hence praise
[36:48] God
[36:48] so we see while there's earthly kingdoms
[36:51] the kingdom of God is the baptism of the
[36:55] Holy Ghost and it's actually from heaven
[36:57] praise God that's right amen
[36:59] it's from heaven jesus said My Kingdom
[37:01] is not of this world remember last week
[37:04] we also looked at how there's Jesus's
[37:06] Kingdom which were in right now but then
[37:08] there's the father's Kingdom which will
[37:10] be in the New Jerusalem praise God after
[37:13] the white throne judgment after
[37:15] everything's been settled all the
[37:17] enemies and the death is blasted and
[37:19] casted like a fire the Jesus presents
[37:21] delivers the kingdom back to the Father
[37:23] that may God that God may be all at all
[37:26] they may that's hard to explain but
[37:28] that's what the scripture says I can't
[37:30] fully explain that all the way now
[37:32] notice Church said the kingdom that we
[37:35] have now the Holy Ghost it used to be
[37:38] with the Jews but it wasn't the baptism
[37:41] of the soul so three day x16 so under
[37:46] the Old Testament the Jews had the
[37:48] kingdom of God but it wasn't yet to the
[37:50] soul x16 this is what the
[37:54] disciples are asking for they think and
[37:56] at least they're asking this without the
[37:58] Holy Ghost so they're still think you
[38:00] might it'll be like David's Kingdom and
[38:02] when Jesus you know the Jesus force us
[38:05] out it's going to be like Solomon's
[38:06] kingdom they actually in other words
[38:08] they were opened for the Millennium
[38:09] that's what they were hoping for it's a
[38:12] good x16 says when they therefore were
[38:15] come together they asked him saying Lord
[38:17] wilt thou at this time restore again the
[38:19] Kingdom of Israel so see they were
[38:22] thinking you know a David Kingdom a
[38:24] Solomon Kingdom what did Jesus say
[38:27] percent and he said that it is not for
[38:30] you to know the times of the season
[38:32] which the father had put in his own
[38:33] power they see they thought oh you know
[38:38] the kingdom of God is gonna be like that
[38:40] really soo but Jesus said no we're gonna
[38:43] take a 2000 year break amen we're going
[38:46] to bring sixty nine and a half years
[38:47] we're going to cut it off and press the
[38:49] pause button and I'm going to go and get
[38:51] a Gentile bride for my namesake all
[38:55] right
[38:56] God had a Kingdom with the Jews we said
[38:58] would applied them per season to
[39:00] preserve life amen
[39:02] I'm gonna go get me a Gentile bride now
[39:06] it's also Matthew 21 33 so that's we
[39:08] dare Jesus and that's surviving social
[39:11] so inspired some of these parables I've
[39:13] never seen them like this before
[39:14] remember there's 15 parables Jesus says
[39:18] if lady and I love this because this
[39:20] parable in particular because Jesus
[39:22] interprets this parable for Saint ahead
[39:24] there some parables he doesn't interpret
[39:26] for us but there are a few that he does
[39:28] one of you don't need interprets the
[39:30] wheat and the tares
[39:31] the four kinds of ground and here he
[39:34] interprets this and he shows that the
[39:36] kingdom of God was given to the Jews but
[39:40] then when the further part of the
[39:41] kingdom the Holy Ghost was going to
[39:43] cover that they turn it down they didn't
[39:44] want nothing to do with me so jesus said
[39:46] in that case I'm going to take the
[39:48] kingdom and I'm going to give it to
[39:49] another nation that'll bring forth the
[39:51] fruits of the Holy Spirit hey Matty 21
[39:54] 33 what a beautiful parable here huh he
[39:58] says here another parable there that's
[40:00] God which planted a vineyard and had to
[40:02] round about and digged a winepress in it
[40:04] and built a tower let it out too high
[40:06] that's the Jews and went to a far
[40:08] country and with the time of the fruit
[40:11] drew near he sent his servants to the
[40:13] husbandmen that they might receive the
[40:14] fruits of it and the husbandmen took his
[40:16] servants and beat one and killed another
[40:18] and stoned another and he sent another
[40:20] servant more than the first and they did
[40:23] likewise unto them also now that was
[40:26] like Jeremiah Isaiah and Ezekiel they
[40:28] beat them they stoned and they killed
[40:30] them right even John the Baptist is one
[40:32] of those we could say and then the last
[40:35] one and then verse pretty soon but last
[40:37] of all I said unto them his son saying
[40:39] they will reverence my son verse 38 when
[40:44] the husbandmen saw the son they said
[40:45] among themselves this is the heir come
[40:48] let us kill him and let us seize on his
[40:50] inheritance and they caught him and cast
[40:54] him out of the vineyard sea and slew him
[40:56] see they cast by the vineyard the Bible
[40:58] said he was slayed outside the gate he
[41:03] verse thirteen that he was crucified
[41:04] without the gate Amen so they kicked him
[41:07] out of Jerusalem and they crucified him
[41:09] uncle Gotha verse forty now when the
[41:12] Lord thereof of the vineyard cometh what
[41:14] will he do under those husbandmen they
[41:16] say then he will miserably destroy those
[41:18] wicked men and will let out his vineyard
[41:21] unto other husbandmen which shall render
[41:23] him the fruits in their season look
[41:25] these people are so far from the kingdom
[41:27] of God but yet they can understand Jesus
[41:30] simple parables they know they're the
[41:33] wicked ones my right because it says it
[41:36] later that they know he's talking about
[41:37] them so they could any man any sinner
[41:41] and he is remember the religious spirit
[41:43] is the worst one even a religious spirit
[41:46] can recognize that they're wicked
[41:48] yet they still will repent they may see
[41:51] that that shows they're worthy of a
[41:52] greater condemnation because they could
[41:55] judges perfectly they say the woman the
[41:57] husband was going to give it to somebody
[41:59] else that'll bring forth fruit jesus
[42:02] said that did you never read the
[42:03] scriptures now this is solves 1:18 the
[42:05] stone which the builders rejected the
[42:07] same has become the head of the corner
[42:08] this is the Lord's doing and is it is
[42:12] marvelous in our eyes you haven't you
[42:14] this therefore I said to you the kingdom
[42:16] of God shall be taken from you he's
[42:19] talking to the chief priests and scribes
[42:21] and Pharisees see they've already got
[42:24] the kingdom of God over the Bible said
[42:25] they've got the key of knowledge but
[42:27] they they closed the door and they won't
[42:29] let anybody in the kingdom so see the
[42:32] law of God was that was they need to
[42:35] gather that because the law of God
[42:37] contained the prophecies on the New
[42:38] Testament am i right Ezekiel's brought
[42:41] all that to a Jew week we've had a qu
[42:43] that used to work at my class on Friday
[42:45] on Friday we I haven't seen her for my
[42:47] ten years and I just thought I'm gonna
[42:49] carry my book with me everywhere I go
[42:51] now so I can pass it out if I see a
[42:52] friend and we come across and she's a
[42:55] Jew she said hey how you doing I said
[42:57] I'm doing good but would you like this
[42:58] and I gave her a copy of my book and
[43:02] she's Jewish
[43:03] and you know I said there's a lot of
[43:06] good scriptures in here from the Old
[43:08] Testament because the Old Testament a
[43:10] New Testament I mentioned that Scripture
[43:12] I said because I was trying to explain
[43:14] to her how we're different from other
[43:16] churches I said well we're a holy ghost
[43:18] no Church and what's that mean I was
[43:21] like well there's kind of this most
[43:23] churches meet that they believe you're
[43:25] filled with God's Spirit as soon as you
[43:26] repent but I said that's not scriptural
[43:28] so I took her back to Z cos in Ezekiel
[43:30] 36 says you get a new heart a new spirit
[43:33] then my spirit I believe and I said we
[43:37] preach you got to press on and the
[43:39] things of God again believe Lena before
[43:42] God though she with nobody else but I
[43:46] she said I love a copybook and your side
[43:48] like yeah I don't really care to sign up
[43:50] it's the content that's in there that I
[43:52] want her to get to the content but even
[43:56] she could see that so the kingdom of God
[44:00] so see they had the keys to the kingdom
[44:02] all the promises were laying right in
[44:04] there Amos Jones prophecy about the Holy
[44:07] Ghost was right in totality amen
[44:09] it was right in there it was the kingdom
[44:11] of God the prophecy was like right in
[44:14] there they just would have kept the word
[44:15] it would have produced the Baptist with
[44:17] all the ghosts in their lives
[44:19] right but jesus said it's taken from you
[44:22] and given to a nation bringing for
[44:25] the fruits they're up oh and whosoever
[44:27] shall follow this stone shall be broken
[44:30] but on whomsoever it shall fall it will
[44:33] grind into powder now picture this
[44:36] remember go back to Daniel to remember
[44:39] when Jesus comes as a stone about it
[44:42] he's gonna fall on the mother harmony
[44:45] then if the stone falls on you you're
[44:48] going to be killed but if you fall on
[44:49] the stone you'll be saved in other words
[44:53] if you throw yourself on the heads of
[44:55] God say God I've nothing
[44:56] if you throw yourself on the heads of
[44:57] God don't break your stony heart up I'll
[45:00] give you a new heart of flesh that's
[45:03] right it's one of the other we've got to
[45:06] throw herself on the mercy of God amen
[45:09] using the one of the other I guess
[45:12] that's why the Bob would want leap of
[45:14] faith I've never seen that before -
[45:15] right now there's your leap of faith
[45:17] throw yourself through your old stony
[45:19] heart up on Christ and I'll break up all
[45:21] your stony heart I'll get you new I
[45:24] never seen that before there it is
[45:26] that's where people get that wrong amen
[45:29] glory go grind to the powder that's what
[45:33] the Bible said as soon as in Daniel -
[45:34] that stone slowed it the image at the
[45:37] feet would represent the end times it
[45:39] went as spread like chaff and just
[45:41] divide it up and broke up into chaff
[45:43] that the wind blew it away just like
[45:44] that powder this little piece is totally
[45:47] dispersed verse 45 and when the chief
[45:50] priests and Pharisees had heard this
[45:51] parables they perceived that he spake of
[45:54] them see they knew they could judge the
[45:58] farewell they can understand the parable
[45:59] but they couldn't receive it they
[46:02] couldn't obey it amen but when they
[46:05] sought to lay hands on him they feared
[46:07] the multitude because they took him for
[46:08] a profit Oh glory
[46:12] now everybody see that there's two kinds
[46:14] of kingdoms earthly heavenly
[46:16] the heavenly kingdom was with the Jews
[46:19] but then they rejected it and so it came
[46:23] to the Gentiles
[46:25] praise God a church it is preaching that
[46:29] calls you to the king baby boy go to
[46:32] acts 28 30 actually it is preaching so
[46:36] it's a good sign here in the kingdom
[46:38] here's a great she game ahead because
[46:40] the Bible said all preach the kingdom of
[46:42] God amen
[46:44] acts 28 30 this is a beautiful scripture
[46:50] and then the Paul's life right before he
[46:53] gets a martyred God opens up a little
[46:56] time of rest where he gets a little
[46:57] house an apartment to rent and he and
[47:00] the God just says that all these people
[47:02] did for him to do Bible studies with
[47:03] amen God is so gracious verse 30 and
[47:08] Paul wrote two whole years in his own
[47:10] hired house and receive all that came in
[47:13] unto him so Paul all done at least three
[47:15] memory to three missionary trips right
[47:17] and never he labored more with all the
[47:18] other apostles none of them make three
[47:20] trips like he did and he went further
[47:22] than all I'm not sure who than Thomas
[47:25] but he made more than Thomas he the
[47:27] three trips and at the end of his life
[47:29] for the kingdom of God's sake he gets
[47:31] arrested and then since he can't go up
[47:33] God sends him in amen
[47:35] oh that's how it is for us if we can't
[47:37] go out God send them in a night sense
[47:40] souls that you hear your word verse 31
[47:42] preaching the kingdom of God and
[47:44] teaching those things which concern the
[47:47] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no
[47:49] man
[47:50] forbidding him so see there's preaching
[47:52] which program says demonstrating the
[47:54] power of God
[47:55] and then there's teaching to get you
[47:57] settled to give you a foundation for the
[47:59] brand causing a basis to give you a
[48:01] basis or foundation so you're not
[48:03] talking about so you know where you
[48:05] stand
[48:06] amen Preeti 82 and remember he was the
[48:10] first church age messenger he's the one
[48:12] we're all supposed to look at and try to
[48:14] imitate him that's right glory
[48:18] first Thessalonians 2 let's go there to
[48:27] verse 11
[48:29] first Thessalonians 2 11 as you know how
[48:33] we exhorted and comfort and charge every
[48:35] one of you as a father
[48:37] Dustin's children so see how an
[48:39] apostille an apostle will preach like a
[48:41] dad right so it's been a while since
[48:45] beyond apostle here is maximally D but
[48:49] they never go to start this church
[48:51] you'd say would have been the apostle
[48:53] now it really didn't work like that so
[48:56] if they did they would act like a father
[48:59] they would speak kind of as from a
[49:00] father to children and the Bible says
[49:04] that they would exhort comfort and
[49:06] charge each one of you okay
[49:10] verse 12 that he would walk worthy of
[49:13] God who hath called you unto his kingdom
[49:16] and glory amen
[49:18] so Paul preached the gospel I'm sorry
[49:21] Paul preached the kingdom and that
[49:23] preaching was the invitation to be a
[49:26] part of the kingdom and to also share in
[49:29] the glory of the kingdom amen
[49:32] another video remember touch we're not
[49:34] just talking to any place let's remember
[49:36] this let's not forget this we're not
[49:38] just going to be a part be around the
[49:40] key to work on the sit in the throne
[49:43] with Christ in the kingdom amen we've
[49:46] got the highest calling in the Bible to
[49:48] be the Bride of Christ to sit with him
[49:50] in his throne oh yes
[49:54] see were called to the kingdom remember
[49:58] the order the order of predestination is
[50:02] first for now so God foreknew
[50:05] you'd want to be a part of the kingdom
[50:06] and then he predestined the events so
[50:09] you could hear the word of God and then
[50:11] he called you to the kingdom amen
[50:14] so he foreknew you he predestinated you
[50:17] and then he calls you and after he calls
[50:19] you he justifies you on this earth and
[50:22] then promised to glorify you give you a
[50:25] glorified body amen that's the order of
[50:29] Romans 8:28 229 first for now it's been
[50:33] predestination then your calling she
[50:36] were called to the kingdom and then he
[50:39] justified you heart of the kingdom that
[50:41] he glowered then will glorify you with a
[50:43] new glorified body all right hallelujah
[50:48] now I want you to see again how urgent
[50:51] Christ was with the kingdom of God for
[50:52] Luke 4 verse 42 we looked at it last
[50:56] Sunday morning remember some of those
[50:59] man that would have been a part of the
[51:01] seventy they had one chance
[51:03] invitation just what and look at the
[51:08] urgency again I believe it's the same
[51:09] today I'll be the holy spirit of like
[51:12] when you witness to your friends when I
[51:13] witness the friends I believe some of
[51:15] them just have one chance to get it
[51:17] other people you know God's more
[51:19] merciful to give some more chances but
[51:23] some people may just have one chance
[51:26] Luke 4 42 now Jesus just casts out a
[51:33] bunch of Devils to rebuked them and did
[51:35] great miracles if I was that He healed
[51:37] all kinds of diversity diseases in verse
[51:40] 40 number 42 and when it was day he
[51:44] departed and went into a desert place
[51:46] and the people saw him and get him unto
[51:48] Him and and stayed him that he should
[51:50] not depart from them and he said them I
[51:52] must preach the kingdom of God to other
[51:54] cities also for therefore am I sent and
[51:58] he preached in the synagogue's of
[52:00] Galilee
[52:01] so Jesus didn't stay long in some places
[52:04] because the kingdom of God needed to be
[52:07] preached other places praise God and so
[52:11] brother Graham was the same way he said
[52:13] he told them that the Brandon Tabernacle
[52:15] he said I I won't be here much longer
[52:17] the gospel must be preached elsewhere
[52:19] you know he'd have to that and that
[52:21] started where this listen to today that
[52:24] started after he got confirmation from
[52:27] the angel in 46 after he got that
[52:30] confirmation he made a promise to God
[52:31] Lord if you start discerning these
[52:34] visions and discerning people I'll take
[52:36] this gift throughout in the world and he
[52:39] kept his promise amen
[52:41] because the kingdom the gospel needed to
[52:44] preach other places praise God
[52:47] now here it's going to loop a since
[52:49] right there now in this kingdom that
[52:52] Jesus was preaching when the kingdom
[52:56] touched people's lives those people that
[52:59] had touched supported that kingdom I'm
[53:03] trying to courage you tonight and it
[53:05] came to pass afterward that he went
[53:06] throughout Luke 8:1 every city and
[53:09] village preaching and showing the glad
[53:11] tidings of the kingdom and the twelve
[53:13] were with him and certain women which
[53:15] has been healed the people
[53:16] spirits and infirmities Mary called
[53:18] Magdalene out of whom instead of devils
[53:20] and Joanna the son of chuza Herod's
[53:22] servant and Susanna and many others
[53:25] which minister in the hint of their
[53:26] substance praise God
[53:28] so whenever the kingdom of God touches
[53:30] you if you're got a true heart you'll
[53:33] support that can with all you got hey
[53:36] sorry so that's what they did the
[53:40] kingdom touch then the kingdom cleansed
[53:42] out then so they said I'm going to
[53:43] support that Kingdom amen
[53:45] I'm going to forget about my previous
[53:47] life at the master Okita I'm going to
[53:49] support the spiritual kingdom of God
[53:51] amen
[53:53] now go to second Peter 1:11 now let's
[53:58] now move here to the the Holy Ghost
[54:02] Kingdom now verdict for the Jen's house
[54:04] because this is the stature perfect man
[54:06] chapter ii peter 1:11 and this kind of
[54:14] gets into the glorified part of the
[54:17] kingdom
[54:18] so right now church were the justified
[54:20] part of the kingdom right we're
[54:22] justified before God we're forgiven but
[54:24] our bodies are not yet glorified but we
[54:26] got a glorified body waiting at the
[54:28] throne of God amen so see that's where
[54:31] we're at we know God's for notice he
[54:33] predestinated us he caught us but right
[54:35] now we're living in a justified position
[54:37] waiting for the glorification of these
[54:40] bodies and when we did let's say we
[54:43] cross over we cross over for the rapture
[54:45] then we'll enter into the what the
[54:47] scripture says here
[54:48] second Peter 1:11 now the Bible says if
[54:52] you let all of the virtues and all the
[54:56] character traits of Jesus growing you
[54:58] and it comes forth abundantly and
[55:00] Android shall be ministered unto you
[55:03] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[55:05] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ see
[55:09] so right now by the Holy Ghost the
[55:11] kingdom of God is within you but the
[55:13] Bible says if you're faithful unto death
[55:15] and you let the fullness of Christ go
[55:18] into you then that entrance will be made
[55:20] into the glorified part of the kingdom
[55:23] in other words the sixth dimension as we
[55:26] know with message believers
[55:27] the six dimension glory see that
[55:31] entrance into that Kingdom where
[55:33] everybody's glorified in a glorified
[55:35] body Lord
[55:38] Alleluia I want everybody to see that
[55:42] there by the grace of the Lord see so
[55:46] this is speaking of the sixth dimension
[55:47] of the course of the millennium
[55:49] that's his kingdom where the kingdom is
[55:51] where everybody's going on everybody's
[55:54] reach that by the stage amen now this is
[55:57] what it's for
[55:58] the kingdom now for us and they go back
[55:59] to the Holy Ghost Romans 14:17 let's
[56:02] read that you know Paul's dealing with
[56:05] people who are are taking their
[56:07] Christian liberties some are some are
[56:10] eating meat some are not some are
[56:11] meeting eating only herbs now that he
[56:15] should I do this should I do that but
[56:17] Paul's trying to show the difference
[56:19] between all these Christian liberties
[56:21] well some keep the holy day some keep
[56:23] this day only some day is that holy now
[56:26] Paul's trying to balance this Psalm out
[56:29] Romans 14:17
[56:31] you know he says his main thing is that
[56:35] we're all going to give an account to
[56:37] God in verse 12 and 13 the main thing is
[56:40] don't cause others to stumble so listen
[56:43] if you've got the kingdom of God within
[56:44] you you're gonna build people up not
[56:46] tear them down
[56:48] praise God a real Holy Ghost filled
[56:51] Christian will not put a stumbling block
[56:53] in somebody's way and say well I can
[56:55] live however they want I don't care what
[56:57] they think
[56:58] no we should care what other people
[56:59] think right don't put a stumbling block
[57:02] in your brother's way don't grieve him
[57:06] with meat and verse 15 number 16 then
[57:09] let not your good be evil spoken of
[57:11] either them so it's okay to touch
[57:13] somebody well I have this conviction
[57:14] because I think this is good verse 17
[57:17] for the kingdom of God is not meat and
[57:19] drink but righteousness peace and joy in
[57:23] the Holy Ghost amen
[57:25] right this is what the kingdom of God
[57:28] the kingdom of God is not about the
[57:30] natural things it's about the spiritual
[57:32] things amen
[57:33] I've enjoyed a piece and all the fruits
[57:35] of the Holy Spirit that's
[57:37] we need that glory you see how rare joy
[57:44] is that today career is joy how many
[57:47] people do you know actually I'm joy I
[57:48] went back to the dry cleaners yesterday
[57:49] and she said again you're just so happy
[57:51] why are you so happy they just I just
[57:55] you can send it to me yesterday people
[57:58] Jesus Christ you know he's my lord he's
[58:00] my Savior
[58:01] these are things that we should
[58:02] constantly have people should see the
[58:04] kingdom of God is within us amen
[58:07] go to first Corinthians 4 verse 20 the
[58:10] next book now we touched on this earlier
[58:15] with Paul people preached and taught the
[58:18] kingdom of God Paul says the same thing
[58:20] in 1st Corinthians 4 verse 20 now Paul
[58:29] and verse 19 is talking up preachers had
[58:31] to come into their church but they were
[58:33] puffed up with pride and they only had
[58:35] words of pride there was puffed up but
[58:38] verse 20 says for the kingdom of God is
[58:40] not in word but in power so a lot of
[58:44] times you'll see that with people that
[58:45] have bought doctrine they really don't
[58:47] have any power behind their ministries
[58:49] right God's not vindicating their word
[58:51] amen
[58:52] I love that what God comes around and
[58:54] indicates the word that's what we live
[58:57] for amen
[58:58] thank God is showing I'm with you in
[59:00] power praise God
[59:04] see look at verse 21 what will he show I
[59:07] come unto you with the rod or in love
[59:08] and the spirit of meekness now of course
[59:12] he did all that right he came in
[59:14] meekness he came to love and him with a
[59:16] rod of Correction because the next
[59:17] chapter he starts rebuking the man that
[59:19] was sleeping with his stepmother so see
[59:21] the kingdom of God comes in power
[59:23] miracles but also in love and correction
[59:26] and meekness as well praise God
[59:29] all right now let's get to this one here
[59:32] this is where you and I can be greatly
[59:34] helped you're encouraged go to Matthew 5
[59:36] let's look at the Beatitudes
[59:44] I remember I preached a few summers on
[59:48] this but I can't remember how many I
[59:49] preached on in just a couple braise the
[59:58] Lord now Jesus goes of course on the
[1:00:01] Sermon on the Mount verse 2 and he
[1:00:04] opened his mouth and taught them saying
[1:00:06] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:00:08] theirs is the kingdom of heaven praise
[1:00:13] God
[1:00:13] now look at verse 10 blessed are they
[1:00:17] which are persecuted for righteousness
[1:00:19] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:00:23] so twice he says theirs is the kingdom
[1:00:26] of heaven those who are poor in spirit
[1:00:28] and those who are persecuted for
[1:00:31] righteousness sake praise God now in the
[1:00:35] Greek poor means to be crouch I like
[1:00:38] this the crouch down it actually means a
[1:00:41] beggar
[1:00:41] now another suppose my man said we're
[1:00:44] not beggars we're not paupers but church
[1:00:46] there are times we decry to God like
[1:00:48] we're pleading with God right I
[1:00:51] understand that and we got to be careful
[1:00:54] not to lose not to let that become frie
[1:00:56] because there's quotes you can take
[1:00:57] where a son of God is way higher than an
[1:00:59] angel but we've got to eat that's true
[1:01:01] but remember we can't speak anything of
[1:01:03] our own selves we got to be led by the
[1:01:06] Holy Spirit yes I believe the blood
[1:01:09] makes us son of God dog up higher than
[1:01:11] an angel but don't go bragging and
[1:01:13] acting like you're something now you're
[1:01:14] puffed up you can only say what God
[1:01:17] tells you to say so
[1:01:20] lesson are the poor in spirit not in
[1:01:22] soul in spirit so in your mind blessed
[1:01:26] are the those who crouched and are
[1:01:28] beggarly in their minds that means
[1:01:32] pauper that's what it means in the Greek
[1:01:34] but there are paupers in their spirit in
[1:01:39] other words less than of those who are
[1:01:42] humble right
[1:01:44] blessed are those who are tiny that's of
[1:01:47] those who are needy Amen I say like this
[1:01:49] it's like the deer panting for water
[1:01:53] see because it's crouching a deer has to
[1:01:56] crouch to get the water Hey reminds us
[1:01:58] of Gideon fact the guys that crouched
[1:02:00] down and had their eyes on the enemy
[1:02:02] that's who God willing to fight for
[1:02:03] maybe the head glory blessed are the
[1:02:06] poor in spirit
[1:02:07] those who crouched those who humble
[1:02:09] themselves in their spirits and they bow
[1:02:12] down and they're thirsty for the things
[1:02:14] of God because theirs is the kingdom of
[1:02:18] God the baptismal Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:20] so who's going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:02:22] those who are crouching those who are
[1:02:25] hopeful those who are hungry and
[1:02:27] thirsting for righteousness ain't he
[1:02:29] says it just a few more verses the Lord
[1:02:31] Jesus does yeah hunger and thirst for
[1:02:37] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:02:39] that's verse 6 that's right so see he
[1:02:41] gives the same thought just a little
[1:02:43] different angle so people can understand
[1:02:46] it it's hard to find humble people but
[1:02:51] you and I are called to be humble and we
[1:02:54] need to be panting and crouching for
[1:02:55] water like the deer pants for the water
[1:02:57] that's right and then an arse of the
[1:03:01] kingdom when were persecuted right made
[1:03:03] fun of and mocked in and rejected ours
[1:03:07] is the kingdom of heaven it's a promise
[1:03:09] praise God now let's go to Matthew 5:19
[1:03:13] there's a lot about the kingdom of
[1:03:15] having this chapter whosoever therefore
[1:03:22] shall break one of the least
[1:03:23] Commandments and shall teach men so he
[1:03:26] shall be called the least in the kingdom
[1:03:28] of heaven so see there there's two
[1:03:32] aspects to this you teach it wrong and
[1:03:35] then you don't live the word that makes
[1:03:39] you the least in the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:41] reverse but let's finish immersion but
[1:03:44] whosoever shall do and teach them amen
[1:03:48] the same shall be called great in the
[1:03:50] kingdom of heaven
[1:03:52] hi there for I said to you that except
[1:03:56] your righteousness shall exceed the
[1:03:57] righteousness of the scribes the
[1:03:58] Pharisees ye shall no case enter into
[1:04:01] the kingdom of heaven Ava
[1:04:03] Oh Lord what makes you great in the
[1:04:07] kingdom of God when you live what you
[1:04:09] preach amen
[1:04:11] what you now say like this when you live
[1:04:14] what is preached to you now me I've got
[1:04:17] to live what I preach but you gotta if
[1:04:19] you're not a preacher you gotta you
[1:04:20] gotta live what's preached to you right
[1:04:23] and those who are called great in the
[1:04:26] kingdom of God live what they preach
[1:04:28] amen Lord and the Bible says not to
[1:04:34] offend the little children that I miss
[1:04:35] that one or that must be a different
[1:04:37] scripture yeah yeah we got it that's
[1:04:39] right you don't teach the little ones so
[1:04:43] always teach those children the right
[1:04:46] thing about but he that is least in the
[1:04:50] kingdom of God is greater than he
[1:04:54] Wow some of you choked on that right
[1:04:58] sometimes we choked on this scripture
[1:05:00] yeah I think you raise your hand say
[1:05:01] sometimes I choked on that waiter let me
[1:05:04] give you a little more insight I heard
[1:05:05] this this is from my new ministry but
[1:05:07] man talked about John the Baptist the
[1:05:10] angel told my man if you'll be sincere
[1:05:13] and stay humble keep way for money and
[1:05:15] stuff then I'll just keep blessing you
[1:05:17] and you'll keep climbing remember said
[1:05:19] many times we look at men who climb up
[1:05:21] in great ranks like and get high names
[1:05:24] but sometimes that's not what God calls
[1:05:26] high you remember John when he came
[1:05:30] preaching the Bible foretold said every
[1:05:32] mountain will be brought low and every
[1:05:34] low place would be lifted up see and
[1:05:36] when it comes you think it would be
[1:05:38] coming out of heaven with fiery chariots
[1:05:41] like the other elijah prophet said no
[1:05:46] but what was it but a poor man dressed
[1:05:50] in a piece of sheepskin wrapped around
[1:05:52] him and out on the banks of Jordan
[1:05:55] preaching on the muddy banks not even in
[1:05:58] a church but God saw that great
[1:06:01] hey muddy banks he's got multiple over
[1:06:06] his feet he's got a wet sheepskin
[1:06:09] because he's baptized and so many people
[1:06:11] this is greatest person in the Old
[1:06:14] Testament praise God
[1:06:17] but man keeps this is silver let's quote
[1:06:20] and when Jesus said recycles that there
[1:06:22] wasn't one born of a woman as great as
[1:06:24] John the Baptist prevention you take all
[1:06:27] the Kings and David the Prophet and all
[1:06:30] of his great splendour in Solomon that
[1:06:32] didn't even touch John the Baptist he
[1:06:35] said Lord because they haven't think
[1:06:39] beautiful rose they were a beautiful
[1:06:42] rose and then all this money and their
[1:06:44] beautiful stone that walked on it and
[1:06:46] other are the five minions and all the
[1:06:48] beautiful things but program says all
[1:06:50] that beauty couldn't touch a man
[1:06:53] anointed with the Elijah's spirit with
[1:06:55] mud all over his feet and locusts all up
[1:06:58] in his teeth mine must have lost unless
[1:07:03] he's follow them home and he's all wet
[1:07:05] soaking wet saying repent my man said
[1:07:08] David saman couldn't touch John the
[1:07:11] Baptist he said so John didn't even have
[1:07:15] a place to lay his head so you don't
[1:07:18] have to be rich you might in this world
[1:07:19] to be great the sign of God you all have
[1:07:21] to be humble in your heart so who is for
[1:07:28] overlaying that David Solomon or John
[1:07:30] the Baptist my man said John the Baptist
[1:07:32] was more humble because he didn't have a
[1:07:36] place to lay his head brother William
[1:07:40] remember David Simon they all build
[1:07:42] themselves big houses did you on the
[1:07:44] Baptist build himself a big house his
[1:07:47] message is too important do we thank God
[1:07:50] for David Solomon yes I just tell you
[1:07:52] what the Bible says yeah
[1:07:53] Jesus says John the Baptist is greater
[1:07:55] than all the women all the men born
[1:07:57] women before him and God calls that
[1:08:03] greatness he's that great enough to
[1:08:06] Humble himself by being so great he
[1:08:11] could humble himself and go out in the
[1:08:13] wilderness and stand alone
[1:08:15] and preach the gospel a day and do the
[1:08:18] whole of ministry instead of
[1:08:20] compromising to go preach with the
[1:08:22] Pharisees and Sadducees Goren and
[1:08:26] brother bang the mountains were brought
[1:08:28] down low and denominationalism an agreed
[1:08:36] in there it was all brought down by the
[1:08:39] preaching of repent the kingdom of God
[1:08:41] is at hand amen
[1:08:43] gourry he said that's a great person
[1:08:47] that'll take the blame for anything that
[1:08:50] humble himself
[1:08:51] that's greatness now Church you know the
[1:08:56] scripture we all fall shrug lord god
[1:08:58] john the baptist i don't think is there
[1:09:00] a sin recorded against him in the Bible
[1:09:01] I just thought of that I can't think of
[1:09:03] one sin record against John the Baptist
[1:09:04] in the bottom but yet we know he had the
[1:09:08] phone short of the glory of God at some
[1:09:09] point IOC would have been the Messiah
[1:09:12] oh he doubted yet he doubted Jesus there
[1:09:14] there's one record yeah thank you lord
[1:09:18] that's all I can think of but he stood
[1:09:21] there against Herod he stood against
[1:09:23] Herodias program said he didn't do it
[1:09:24] because he hated them he did it because
[1:09:26] he loves them he rebuked them because he
[1:09:29] loved them he says that's greatness John
[1:09:32] chose humanity rather than greatness so
[1:09:38] the church honey one that how could you
[1:09:40] be great that he know God humble
[1:09:41] yourself and serve other people be poor
[1:09:45] in spirit say God in my mind I'm weak in
[1:09:48] my mind lord give me your strength to my
[1:09:50] mind I'm coming to you Lord I'm hungry
[1:09:54] and thirsty behind the soap overwhelm
[1:09:56] who quit with cares of the world Lord I
[1:09:58] just come Lord I'm just hungered and
[1:10:00] thirsted give me some fresh to start my
[1:10:02] mind amen
[1:10:04] I'm poor in spirit yet but also a more
[1:10:06] spirit than the kingdom of God's by Lord
[1:10:11] see it's a mine my mind is not as strong
[1:10:14] as I wanted to be so bored I'm coming to
[1:10:16] you hungry and thirsty anoint my mind
[1:10:19] transformed by my
[1:10:21] we do love our Lord oh I love that quote
[1:10:25] I just think that yesterday that's glory
[1:10:26] that's glorious
[1:10:28] David it's Amon and all their splendor
[1:10:30] couldn't even touch John the Baptist no
[1:10:35] what about you because the Bible said
[1:10:38] he's at least in the kingdom of God and
[1:10:41] no mercy that's that's a joker anybody
[1:10:47] give water after that Chokin anybody in
[1:10:50] one of the have somebody go get you some
[1:10:52] water now to church why is that it comes
[1:10:55] down to this because the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:57] in the soul of man because David as
[1:11:01] great as he was he still lusted into
[1:11:04] another man's wife right still had a man
[1:11:07] killed committed adultery and then
[1:11:11] married what he had 300 concubines her
[1:11:13] he's at 5-under wives and the Bible said
[1:11:16] four kings not to take unto themselves
[1:11:17] many wives the Bible God warned them in
[1:11:20] Deuteronomy still great man he's still
[1:11:23] mad after God's own heart but he wasn't
[1:11:25] the greatest John the Baptist but listen
[1:11:28] John I just did just stroking there John
[1:11:30] turned down getting married all for what
[1:11:33] to be the forerunner of Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] also we can handle and hold the word man
[1:11:39] flashing all the other ones talked about
[1:11:45] all those talking about John baptized
[1:11:47] him judge separates over thirty years
[1:11:51] they men for six months of ministry and
[1:11:54] he turned down houses he turned out
[1:11:57] Lance wife children he turned all that
[1:11:59] down so he could fall run the Messiah
[1:12:02] and there's not a greater than John the
[1:12:05] Baptist in the Old Testament but it was
[1:12:09] so humble so humble didn't look great
[1:12:12] but it was great in the sight of God
[1:12:16] Laurie and so you and I when we're born
[1:12:21] again are greater than that because now
[1:12:25] we've got it in our soul praise God
[1:12:27] that's the only way I can see it it has
[1:12:30] to be that way because Jesus says the
[1:12:33] Holy Ghost could not be
[1:12:34] till Jesus was glorified praise God so
[1:12:40] the least in the kingdom is greater than
[1:12:43] John now we'll always have the attitude
[1:12:45] that were not as great as John right we
[1:12:47] always want to be humbled but according
[1:12:49] to Jesus in your soul you've got a
[1:12:51] greater blessing than what they have the
[1:12:54] Old Testament right because the kingdom
[1:12:58] of God is now within you so he won't be
[1:13:03] like Solomon's Solomon syndrome of
[1:13:06] backsliding as you get older and set a
[1:13:08] backside you'll be more dedicated to God
[1:13:10] right like Jesus said member the secret
[1:13:14] of Christianity he said your last works
[1:13:17] were more than your first oh yeah that's
[1:13:21] the secret of Christianity you labor
[1:13:23] more for God the older you get you get
[1:13:27] more dedicated more consecrated if
[1:13:29] you're not sure it's time to check up
[1:13:31] it's time to get rise see you first the
[1:13:34] kingdom of God amen and His
[1:13:37] righteousness get back on track because
[1:13:39] this is the secret of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:41] it's a concept burning fire like like
[1:13:44] you said on Wednesday night it's
[1:13:45] expanding why amen it's gonna take more
[1:13:47] and more of your life amen
[1:13:49] it's gonna consume more Amore's it's
[1:13:51] growing but you gotta be flexible like
[1:13:55] God now we're talking about that
[1:13:56] inter-service that was the word
[1:13:57] instructor on Wednesday flexible we
[1:13:59] gotta be flexible if the Holy Spirit
[1:14:01] says move and serve me in a greater ways
[1:14:03] we've got to do it because light expands
[1:14:07] the Holy Ghost expands and never slugs
[1:14:09] that it expands to all of our all of our
[1:14:12] life
[1:14:14] Laurie I've never seen like that
[1:14:20] thank the Lord you enjoyed this I love
[1:14:28] that John the Baptist's Chris there's
[1:14:29] something about that mother so glorious
[1:14:31] hallelujah humble humility porn spirit I
[1:14:37] need more of God I'm crouching before
[1:14:39] God Laura I lay my life before I'm a
[1:14:41] living sacrifice I crucify the license
[1:14:45] affections they're up I set my
[1:14:47] affections on heaven fill my heart with
[1:14:49] your spirit fill my heart with the
[1:14:52] things of God Lord I Church you know
[1:14:57] this unrepentant hearts will not inherit
[1:15:00] the kingdom of God we have to go through
[1:15:02] this but I got a Brit down here there's
[1:15:04] one two three there's four scriptures on
[1:15:07] it
[1:15:07] first Corinthians six collations five
[1:15:09] and these five at first Corinthians 15
[1:15:11] says that those who do such sins will
[1:15:13] not inherit the people of God so that's
[1:15:16] what I'm going to write in the next book
[1:15:17] with the the kingdom of the holy ghost
[1:15:19] chapter God gives us a perfect line of
[1:15:22] the sand
[1:15:22] you cannot say you're sanctified and
[1:15:25] commit adultery because you're not you
[1:15:28] cannot say you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:30] commit abomination like fornication or
[1:15:33] murderer right you cannot murder say you
[1:15:36] got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:38] another word search God gives us a river
[1:15:40] Jordan once we cross the river Jordan
[1:15:45] will never go back to those Egypt's in
[1:15:48] take that right those wilderness sins so
[1:15:52] if God gives us a line of sand if you do
[1:15:54] these things without repentance you will
[1:15:56] not inherit the kingdom of God amen
[1:16:00] so there's so many I think there was 23
[1:16:03] on this at one time I preached it one
[1:16:04] time and showed each one by the Greek
[1:16:06] and I got a video on it if you go to
[1:16:10] that video the three works of grace I
[1:16:11] think it's a two-part series on YouTube
[1:16:13] I've gone through all 23 of those and
[1:16:17] you can see each one and there's things
[1:16:19] like divide churches you know there's
[1:16:20] things like money laundering you know
[1:16:22] there's off are there's so many clues to
[1:16:26] let people know
[1:16:26] ordering it or not if they just read
[1:16:28] this Holy Bible right we've just got to
[1:16:31] be more interested in this than we are
[1:16:32] the other things of the world oh I'm
[1:16:36] interested in this right here this is
[1:16:38] what I'm interested in right here praise
[1:16:40] God Nathan now see unrepentant heart
[1:16:45] will not will not inherit it to see that
[1:16:49] bruise the foolish virgin has to repent
[1:16:50] of all that now at least repent of it
[1:16:53] they made you they may commit those sins
[1:16:55] with no repent of it because they will
[1:16:58] inherit a force for the kingdom of God
[1:16:59] not the city but they'll be outside now
[1:17:04] Brooke would know John 3 verse 3 this is
[1:17:11] why people can't find a home church this
[1:17:13] is why they can't support a local church
[1:17:16] they can't understand why church is so
[1:17:19] important but Jesus tells us plainly you
[1:17:21] got to give order to get you cannot see
[1:17:25] or understand God's kingdom until you're
[1:17:28] born again just on the church no sorna
[1:17:32] it's a kingdom amen
[1:17:34] it's establishing the Dominion on earth
[1:17:37] amen this is a foretaste of Kingdom
[1:17:40] divine a men oh yeah that's right church
[1:17:45] thank you though we're kings of Greece
[1:17:49] verse 3 Jesus answer sent him verily
[1:17:52] verily I say to you except a man be born
[1:17:53] again he cannot see he cannot understand
[1:17:56] the kingdom of God yes Nicodemus says of
[1:18:02] him how can a man be born when he's old
[1:18:04] help me enter the same time in his
[1:18:05] mother's womb to be born jesus answered
[1:18:07] verily verily I say to you except a man
[1:18:08] be born of water and of the spirit he
[1:18:10] cannot the air of the kingdom of God
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:14] hallelujah now it goes to knocks off the
[1:18:16] wind you don't know where it's coming
[1:18:17] don't know where it's going no doubt
[1:18:19] about that I'm not gonna emphasize that
[1:18:21] but I want to emphasize that's why
[1:18:22] people get so tired of a message
[1:18:25] churches or any church that's why they
[1:18:26] fall out because if they got bored again
[1:18:28] they would know that angels are here
[1:18:30] recording your thoughts and your
[1:18:32] thoughts are in heaven are other than
[1:18:34] your words on earth
[1:18:36] Lord they're here recording and this
[1:18:40] they're reporting to the Father about
[1:18:42] who's really a part of the kingdom of
[1:18:44] God who's working for the kingdom of God
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:47] because the next life is just an echo of
[1:18:50] this life right because John was so
[1:18:55] humble and faithful he had a he was the
[1:18:57] greatest of the Old Testament kingdom it
[1:18:59] was so humble heaven was watching them
[1:19:01] in church heavens watching you and Alec
[1:19:03] today to see this is more than just
[1:19:06] church smothers together this is God's
[1:19:09] rule Haven this is God's dimension on
[1:19:11] earth and the great ones are the ones
[1:19:15] who do it and to each of others amen
[1:19:19] they hear the word they do it and then
[1:19:21] they teach other people to do it as well
[1:19:23] oh that's right church that's right and
[1:19:25] that beautiful by it makes so much sense
[1:19:27] now the kingdom of God that's why people
[1:19:29] can't see it they can't see coming to
[1:19:31] sit in church here in the Word of God
[1:19:33] ran a fastener or you don't pray for the
[1:19:35] Holy Ghost they can't see it because
[1:19:38] they don't want to understand it they've
[1:19:40] got other things that are more important
[1:19:42] that's right they've got other things
[1:19:45] they won't repent of this that's the
[1:19:46] trouble because if not they would
[1:19:49] inherit the kingdom of God now just
[1:19:51] approved again go to Matthew 25:34 the
[1:19:54] foolish virgin do have a place in the
[1:19:56] kingdom because there's six things
[1:20:00] number 6 is the number of anointed man
[1:20:02] to be bald men but it's also anointed
[1:20:04] man for the Rams folks six squirrels
[1:20:06] into existence and then on the seventh
[1:20:08] I'm he just spoke it to be there where
[1:20:11] you can find it but he said sexy but RAM
[1:20:13] said that was the number of man God gave
[1:20:15] him confirmation with six squirrels he
[1:20:17] says that quote I think I shared it with
[1:20:19] you and through 25:34 just I just want
[1:20:28] to bring this out because this is a good
[1:20:29] Kingdom Scripture 25:34 then shall the
[1:20:34] King say to them on the right hand come
[1:20:35] ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:20:38] kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:20:40] foundation of the world so they had they
[1:20:44] inherit a place to live in
[1:20:47] side the kingdom but these are not kings
[1:20:50] and priests these are just those who get
[1:20:52] to live in the kingdom yeah because this
[1:20:55] for verse 25 I was hungry and you gave
[1:20:58] me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink
[1:21:00] I was stranger you took me in naked and
[1:21:03] you clothed me I was sick and you missed
[1:21:04] me I was in prison he came to me hey it
[1:21:07] just struck me this is why their foolish
[1:21:10] version they just did these physical
[1:21:12] acts of physical ruling or physical
[1:21:15] health but in but in Revelation 7 where
[1:21:18] there's a Gentile bride with palms the
[1:21:21] Bible says they are part of the kingdom
[1:21:22] because they're wash their garments
[1:21:24] white in the blood of Jesus Christ those
[1:21:29] Gentile bride were fully forgiven and
[1:21:32] they went to the fountain it was blood
[1:21:34] they in other words they had the full
[1:21:35] atonement praise God
[1:21:37] hey the brothers will have the full
[1:21:39] effects of the atonement of the blood of
[1:21:41] Christ but the Jewish version does it
[1:21:43] she turns down the blood so she gets
[1:21:45] there by being good to the people who
[1:21:47] represent the blood oh man
[1:21:50] that's right Church look at that six
[1:21:54] ways they can get anointed in six
[1:21:56] different ways and if they do a good
[1:21:58] thing to the bride does people they get
[1:22:00] eternal life they're blessed of the
[1:22:03] father to inherit the kingdom and now
[1:22:07] looks her seat all beautiful see how
[1:22:09] they're surprised right here by they men
[1:22:10] they're surprised what do you mean see
[1:22:12] they could have seen the kingdom I said
[1:22:18] what do you mean we're saying remember
[1:22:19] Jesus said unless you're born again you
[1:22:22] can't see the kingdom so they did nice
[1:22:24] aggressions not even really knowing what
[1:22:26] they were doing to the kingdom of God
[1:22:27] because they weren't born again they
[1:22:29] couldn't see the kingdom see but we know
[1:22:41] that we are God in flesh work
[1:22:43] manifesting God in our flesh they can't
[1:22:51] see the kingdom of God they can't see
[1:22:53] that the kingdom of God is God hiding
[1:22:56] himself in simplicity behind a many
[1:22:58] number bride oh thank you see the bush
[1:23:09] version of standing there you know oh
[1:23:11] I'm surprised I'm safe but the Bible
[1:23:13] said the bride is already on the throne
[1:23:16] revelation 3:21 see we're not standing
[1:23:20] there like oh but it's something good
[1:23:23] for Jesus we know that we see the
[1:23:25] kingdom of God we see with the Holy
[1:23:28] Ghost solid eyes finishing the Great
[1:23:30] Commission
[1:23:30] thank you this gospel to every nation
[1:23:32] they are you and I taking it to our
[1:23:35] family members taking this city take it
[1:23:37] to every will hear the word of God
[1:23:39] revelation 3:21 Tim it overcomes will I
[1:23:44] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:23:45] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[1:23:49] father in his throne see these foolish
[1:23:51] virgin didn't overcome anything all they
[1:23:53] did was show a little love to the
[1:23:54] product they couldn't see the kingdom of
[1:23:57] God but Jesus says to the overcomers
[1:24:00] they sit right here with me they don't
[1:24:03] stand out there with all those goats and
[1:24:06] everything like that he said they're
[1:24:07] right here by me grace God and there's
[1:24:10] more than one scripture about down that
[1:24:12] first 15-6 says the Saints will judge
[1:24:15] the earth see these white throne
[1:24:17] judgment they're getting judged by their
[1:24:19] works but the bride judges the earth by
[1:24:24] her testimony like the Queen of Sheba
[1:24:26] praise God
[1:24:27] she's the one being used her life judges
[1:24:31] those who didn't obey the kingdom of God
[1:24:33] now Revelation 20 verse 4 this is a good
[1:24:37] one a church this about the most
[1:24:38] humbling scripture I've seen in a long
[1:24:39] time
[1:24:41] the other one major rejoice where Jesus
[1:24:43] says that he this least the kingdom is
[1:24:46] greater the judge that made me rejoice
[1:24:48] that saying actually that's quite all
[1:24:50] they do but this one just as humbling
[1:24:52] verse 4 revelation 20 verse 1 and I saw
[1:24:56] Thrones and they sat on them and
[1:24:57] judgment was given
[1:24:59] then they they settlement choice may
[1:25:03] given to them remember the Bible said
[1:25:05] the Saints should judge angels will
[1:25:08] judge the fallen demons that's why the
[1:25:10] next studies no one did I found a good
[1:25:12] book and it lists all the spirits in the
[1:25:14] Bible like the spirit of slumber the
[1:25:15] spirit of fear the spirit of infirmity
[1:25:17] all these spirits out I want to look I
[1:25:19] want to go through every one of those so
[1:25:21] we can be over commerce praise God if we
[1:25:24] preach on those spirits it'll teach us
[1:25:26] to have spiritual warfare events so
[1:25:30] we'll know if the spirit produces but we
[1:25:33] always know how to overcome I Jesus
[1:25:36] speak the word obey the word speak the
[1:25:38] word in any tribe but it's good to
[1:25:41] identify those demon powers now this is
[1:25:45] so beautiful look and I saw Vincey verse
[1:25:47] 4 and I saw the souls of them that were
[1:25:49] beheaded for the witness of Jesus look
[1:25:52] at this church and for the word of God
[1:25:55] those Jews and Christians Jews that got
[1:25:58] the Holy Ghost and which had not
[1:25:59] worshipped the Beast neither His image
[1:26:01] neither had received his mark upon their
[1:26:04] foreheads or their hands and they lived
[1:26:07] and reigned with Christ a thousand years
[1:26:11] look how humbling this is Church if
[1:26:15] we're really the bride if the Bible's
[1:26:17] right and all these programs
[1:26:18] interpretations right we're going to be
[1:26:20] up there God sees our life on the same
[1:26:24] level as those who got beheaded like st.
[1:26:26] Paul that's about that makes me feel
[1:26:30] about that big God's got a place up
[1:26:33] there all the overcomers if they just
[1:26:35] turn down the Beast and they overcome
[1:26:39] the Beast in their lifetime overcome
[1:26:42] that Kingdom by God's kingdom amen
[1:26:44] they turned down that kingdom of another
[1:26:46] harlot and they give their lives all
[1:26:48] eyes to the kingdom of God they get the
[1:26:51] sit on the same throne as those beheaded
[1:26:53] like st. Paul nah whatever water church
[1:26:57] what are we were for eternity just
[1:27:00] turning down the things of this world
[1:27:01] just turning it down safety
[1:27:03] amazing we reward the Bible offers us
[1:27:06] how many believe that think about that
[1:27:09] our lives
[1:27:11] you serve the same reward as those
[1:27:14] beheaded for Christ because we go
[1:27:17] overcome the Beast let's close with this
[1:27:22] Matthew 20 verse 1 let's go to this last
[1:27:25] parable Brady Scott Arab 11 tower
[1:27:46] workers 20 verse 1
[1:27:54] most of us know the story here but you
[1:27:57] know Jesus you know the Bible tells us
[1:27:59] that the the husband went out at the
[1:28:02] first hour the third hour the six hour
[1:28:05] the ninth hour that should have been the
[1:28:07] last one be said I'm going to go out one
[1:28:09] more time at the eleventh hour my name
[1:28:11] is Greg say man there it is I can see
[1:28:13] that glory because there's really only
[1:28:16] those four divisions in the day but he's
[1:28:18] not going to have breaks their necks
[1:28:20] amen I'm having grace I'm about wool or
[1:28:22] olive he's remember they're in three our
[1:28:23] divisions right
[1:28:24] what 1st 3rd 6 9 9 ship in the last one
[1:28:28] but he said I'm gonna have Grace and I'm
[1:28:30] gonna have a fifth call for those 11th
[1:28:32] hour workers now program says that we
[1:28:35] are the 11th hour workers because of
[1:28:36] World War one ending an 11th month 11th
[1:28:39] hour and God giving more grace that the
[1:28:44] world wasn't destroyed so I that seems
[1:28:46] to be right I believe that that's Morris
[1:28:49] but now what's interesting though is
[1:28:51] that when they call the labourers in
[1:28:55] verse 8 they Bible said they call the
[1:28:57] labourers and give them their hire
[1:28:58] beginning from the last unto the first
[1:29:03] so Jesus gives those people that worked
[1:29:06] one hour compared to 12 right how many
[1:29:10] worked a 12-hour day before I did a
[1:29:12] couple of times that's no fun thank God
[1:29:15] I don't have to do it very often twelve
[1:29:18] hours and this church art works right
[1:29:20] now as hard as theirs out in the field
[1:29:21] okay
[1:29:22] right so the 12-hour workers come up
[1:29:24] with like what do you mean I'm behind
[1:29:26] the ones that worked one hour and they
[1:29:31] start complaining yes now I need to
[1:29:34] study this out of warm and it kind of
[1:29:35] seems like the Jews complaining like the
[1:29:38] Jews you know what you're harder times
[1:29:40] than I don't know I'm not sure but my
[1:29:43] map says we're allowed not work or
[1:29:44] something stay with that one but look at
[1:29:46] that they start complaining if I wasn't
[1:29:48] a murderer against Christ cuz they labor
[1:29:52] twelve but the one who labor one got
[1:29:55] their reward first and they thought well
[1:29:59] I should get more but they got a penny I
[1:30:01] should get more than a penny and they
[1:30:03] murmured a verse 11 verse 12 saying
[1:30:05] these last have wrought for one hour and
[1:30:07] that was made them each one to us which
[1:30:10] have formed the burden and heat of the
[1:30:12] day they got mad
[1:30:14] what do you mean how can they be equal
[1:30:16] with us verse 13 but he answered one of
[1:30:20] them and said friend I do thee no wrong
[1:30:23] this not thou agree with me for a penny
[1:30:28] what was the ingredient when they
[1:30:30] started working the agreement is one
[1:30:32] penny the agreement was for eternal life
[1:30:36] the one penny the one life a night
[1:30:41] there's only one life away the truth
[1:30:44] they all agreed for one penny one form
[1:30:48] of life some work longer for some work
[1:30:53] through a harder time for it but God
[1:30:57] said Electric Gunson friend I dunno do
[1:30:59] you know Rome look at verse 14 take that
[1:31:01] thine is and go my way I will give unto
[1:31:04] this last even as unto thee
[1:31:07] look at verse 15 is it not lawful for me
[1:31:10] to do what I will with mine own is thine
[1:31:15] eye evil because I'm good it's got a
[1:31:21] good God or see a mean God easily God
[1:31:25] now if you go back to the parable Jesus
[1:31:28] says eleventh are workers why aren't you
[1:31:30] working he's that no man is calling us
[1:31:32] sorry
[1:31:33] in other words
[1:31:34] never could hear the calls till now amen
[1:31:37] I wish our God all that time I woulda
[1:31:40] made but I never could hear the call so
[1:31:43] right now even and you're not would've
[1:31:46] stood during the times of all we would
[1:31:47] have stood during times of Peter we
[1:31:49] wouldn't start the day tomorrow
[1:31:51] Luther but that wasn't the time for us
[1:31:53] to hear the call our time is right now I
[1:31:56] got one hour and the Sun is setting it's
[1:31:59] not as hot as other times but we've got
[1:32:02] the labor this last hour
[1:32:04] and Jesus said I'll reward the last
[1:32:05] version because this is the most wicked
[1:32:08] of deceptive age also that evil seducers
[1:32:11] will wax worse and worse even in other
[1:32:13] words today please the discernment of
[1:32:15] the Holy Ghost more than ever before we
[1:32:19] need to see the kingdom of God believe
[1:32:21] the kingdom of God and labor for the
[1:32:22] people of God because it's an age of
[1:32:25] deception people think they see the
[1:32:27] kingdom of God that they don't what kind
[1:32:33] of life is gonna sit by these that were
[1:32:34] beheaded those that did not worship the
[1:32:39] Beast the denominational system those
[1:32:42] who chose the worship Christ in this
[1:32:45] hour alone I remember this parable is
[1:32:50] right after Jesus when Peter said Peter
[1:32:53] said Jesus lead left all what do we get
[1:32:57] he said I promised you a hundredfold in
[1:32:59] this life for the life to come amen
[1:33:02] and yes he ends that chapter 19 by
[1:33:04] saying many she'll be the first should
[1:33:06] be last last should be first many are
[1:33:10] called but few are chosen
[1:33:13] see there's a certain group that was
[1:33:15] chosen for the eleventh hour and then
[1:33:18] you're the four because they put it
[1:33:20] right there but when they showed up they
[1:33:24] were called for such a time as this amen
[1:33:28] they were called to work one hour with
[1:33:30] all of our hearts and Jesus said you get
[1:33:33] the same reward because I promised
[1:33:35] eternal life for everyone
[1:33:37] glory so these are all them for seco
[1:33:42] whether you work 12 hours 9 6 3 or 1
[1:33:46] any minute you all agree I'm feeling it
[1:33:49] I'm good I'm a good guy I'll be give
[1:33:51] everybody one reward eternal life praise
[1:33:55] God
[1:33:56] let's do our beef as we're standing
[1:33:58] think about this who knows how many
[1:34:03] years Jonathan I'm sorry Jonathan divine
[1:34:05] labor anyway no 66 years he preached the
[1:34:10] gospel praise God 66 years he died in a
[1:34:17] hundred years old
[1:34:19] he got the Holy Ghost in a t-33 with
[1:34:22] nobody ghosts fell and he lived for 66
[1:34:24] years
[1:34:25] that's according to history she imagined
[1:34:28] 66 years worth of ministry for the
[1:34:30] kingdom of God
[1:34:33] who knows how many years Stephen the
[1:34:36] first martyr lived he loved 29 years
[1:34:41] history says well the way he was 29
[1:34:44] years old what the Bible said he was
[1:34:46] full of faith the Holy Ghost Lord Church
[1:34:51] he only served one year for the kingdom
[1:34:53] of God 1 here John lived 66 but you
[1:34:59] think you think John's going to get a
[1:35:03] greater or more than Stephen oh my it
[1:35:08] was
[1:35:09] Stephens testimony was so great at 29
[1:35:11] years old that Jesus stood up to receive
[1:35:14] him into heaven he said I see Jesus
[1:35:18] standing at the right hand of the Father
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] to receive in one year brother William
[1:35:23] verses 66 and it's just like this
[1:35:26] parable whether it's one year one hour
[1:35:28] or 12 hours get the same reward seekers
[1:35:33] God has to have testimonies them in
[1:35:34] their 20s look here's a 29 year old man
[1:35:36] who got the Holy Ghost the kingdom of
[1:35:38] God and he wouldn't turn it down even
[1:35:40] die for it hey that John was a man a
[1:35:44] hundred years old and he's in the goin
[1:35:46] hands all those people that sell out God
[1:35:48] at the end of their lives
[1:35:49] see a hundred year old man can live
[1:35:51] that's the power of the kingdom of God
