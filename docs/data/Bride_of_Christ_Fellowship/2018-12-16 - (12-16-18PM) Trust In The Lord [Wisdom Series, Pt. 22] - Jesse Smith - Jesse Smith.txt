[Music] amen praise God first Christ peace amen praise the Lord amen well let's stand here let's get right into the Word of God here I like to just preach on another proverbs sermon here I like to try to get that series completed as well so if you have your Bibles let's go to proverbs chapter 3 bless you proverbs chapter 3 verse 1 selected this is part 22 Lydia I'm not sure if you're recording it or not but part 22 of though we're just gonna call it the wisdom series by the grace of the Lord so I went through every time brother Branham said the word proverb and then I pulled out the different thoughts that he said about proverbs so I like to look at that tonight I think there'll be a blessing to you robbers three verse one says my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man let's read verse five together ready one two three trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding let's read verse six one two three and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths I'll read verse 7 be not wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil verse a it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones praise God let's bow our heads here for word of Prayer if ever need on your heart just make it known unto the Lord here Heavenly Father we come to you tonight we worship You Lord we sang to you we've offered prayers in thy great name so father we ask now Lord God you anoint me as I preach your word Lord anoint each here Lord Rosse closer to you Lord speak these words of life to our hearts Lord God that they might be deeply planted in the ground of our heart Lord and bring forth through in its season father god water these things Lord as these some of these things we've heard before water these precious thoughts the Lord God these proverbs and father we just ask that you'd be glorified Heavenly Father bless our fellowship here Lord bless the the atmosphere Lord may we feel your presence dear Lord in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you to be in seated praise God so as I said I went through this quite a few months ago they went through brother grams sermons and I looked at every time he said the word proverbs I want to get a good understanding of what he said and so we'll look at some of these thoughts that he gives us here in regards to the wisdom so this is the first one I like to mention here tonight and sobrams talking about this scripture and he says it's he says this is one of the most beautiful Scripture he reads proverbs 3 what we just got done reading he said oh I think that's the most beautiful scripture he said I want to take a text he said I the fifth verse lean not unto thy own understanding is that beautiful to you verse I trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding you know church were in a day of increased knowledge right daniel said a knowledge will be increased at the end time and it's so important now to get a degree or it's so important to be smarter to be a sage on the stage as they say but you know God looks at it the other way God looks at we must become humble when we become humble we're actually doing the right thing rather than trying to figure out things we cannot lean unto thy own understanding we've got to trust in the Lord with all of our heart now it's important to note to in verse 7 be not wise in their own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil now we know it's it's ok you know to go to school it's ok to get degrees and that's alright as long as that doesn't our faith in God and the way we know that is by verse seven by fearing the Lord and departing from evil so we know no matter how much we learn in school no matter how much we learn in the college or in a trade or something as long as we're constantly leaving evil a confessing sin and walking away from sin then we know we can still fulfill verse five and lean upon God's understanding and not our own remember there was great men there was great men that were smart I remember about Daniel in the Hebrew children they were smarter than all the other ones right the Bible said they were more advanced in science knowledge and wisdom but yet when it came down to the lines then to Daniel try to figure it out scientifically and get out his Scrolls and and try to understand how can God do this the three Hebrew children that they try to figure out the temperature well maybe the temperatures this hot maybe if we have a certain layer of clothing we can shield ourselves from the temperature no they didn't lean upon their own understanding so their their perfect example and church they lived in the midst of Babylon just like we do they're a great example for us to look to that and say just like they they said it's good to know these things it's good to to work and do my job I think of a guy who works there with tools you know he's probably got to do measurements and he's probably got to figure out something with math he has to do that but that that doesn't have to take away his walk with the Lord it doesn't hurt our walk with the Lord when we when we understand maybe the laws of science and the laws of God that he's placed in mathematics and everything as we're looking at the numbers this morning that doesn't have to hurt our walk with God the thing we must do though has never become wise in our own eyes we must never think well I'm somebody because of what I've done or what I've learned we must always remain humble and put all of our trust in the Lord now brother Branham says I think that's the most beautiful scripture and he preached the whole sermon in 1965 called Lina upon that own understanding and as when I listened to it I found that he just kept going back to that thought about how we must just trust in the law and he went through all the different ages where there was believers and in every age the believers had to trust in God's Word instead of what men said or what science said and we of course find ourselves in the same way today but I want to look at this scripture in another sermon he preached called oneness in 1962 brother Branham says he says Christians have to battle with being a better class of people that goes to a church or he says all the church's ability bigger building they're smarter men and brother Graham said that don't have one thing to do with it he said sayings much smarter than Eve he says but she he says she didn't it wasn't even in the picture she wasn't supposed to be smart she was supposed to be obedient we're not supposed to be smart Jesus are the children of this world or the kingdom of this world is much smarter the children of darkness than the children of light we are likened to sheep sheep can't even lead themselves can you say amen to that you and I can't even lead ourselves into this coming week we have to trust Lord lead me through this week because I can't lead myself of course don't get me wrong if you feel led of the Spirit to do a certain thing this week then that is God's leading but we can't plan it out and make make it seem like well I'll do everything that I think I want to do it it's all gonna work out this way we can't cross bridges before we get to them praise God but we can't ask the Lord for his wisdom he says sheep can't even lead themselves they've got to have a shepherd God don't want a smart he wants us to lean on his understanding just where he leads see the picture he said don't lean on your own understanding proverbs 3 and 5 no matter how contrary it seems and how big the bright lights look out there don't pay attention to it just lean on his understanding what he says to be the truth that's what I'm gonna be facing here in a few minutes I'm gonna go up those big bright lights and Akron and the hospitals has those big bright lights but as much as we appreciate that we can't lean upon that we've gotta lean upon God's promise that's right what he says is the truth now brother Bannon skips now to first Corinthians 4:20 so liddy can you pull it up there first Corinthians 4:20 I'm gonna turn there to see brings the scripture out there just for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power now of course don't know must understand that we've got to preach the word we've got to read the word we've got to believe the word but what this scripture is referring to is the power that goes with that word as we said this morning you know a good example of that would be Lord a you know if we looked at the number 6 then the anointed man if we ran if we just heard that and we knew we are not anointed then it was just word if we just stayed unknown t'adore stayed worldly but if we saw the power behind that and repented of our our mistakes and now we feel anointed well then we receive the power of that word praise God amen so see that's what it comes down to though the preaching has to and for me too for all of us has to be more than a word we've got to receive the power of that word now program reads this and he says if you want to put that down he says the kingdom of God is God's Word made power what is the kingdom of God Jesus says the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom is within you and when the word comes in there what does the this word begin it turned itself into power making it say just exactly what it said amen to see when the word of God comes in our hearts it's comes in our hearts and is supposed to produce something it's supposed to be building and building and building that's my brother man talks about faith building he talks about sermons that build your faith so he should have heard the word this morning we should heard the hear the word tonight and it should be building our faith because it starts as a word but it's got to become more than that it's got to become power praise God man can't say it says this and it says this and make it work you got to say the same thing the word says that makes the confession not saying well it's polished up a little here how more wisdom and I'll be better standing over here you stay with the word there it is and it makes it power Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever all right now what is it you've got to get with the word he says get yourself killed out what a statement get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we receive just enough Holy Ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill you're thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his words just living right through you amen he says you don't know nothing else but God's Word just stay right with his word it is life my words our life said Jesus he's placed with them teachers believing the Bible prophets that say the truth that say that show the same prophecy that they've always did down through the age what's he done he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word his word the kingdom of God is God's Word made power amen I like that praise God God's Word God's kingdom is his word made power remember we can't we can't bring that to past ourselves we've got to let God bring us to that place we got to let God reveal his will to us praise the Lord now I want to look at a few more scriptures here and I just thought it good look a little bit of thoughts on this power now to get God's power to to heal or God's power to move in our life we've got to confess all of our sin that's the first step the Bible says confess your faults in James chapter five one to another confess your faults and then after we confess our faults we know God's forgiven us then the second step we must ask God for His perfect will what is God's will is God's will to do what we want him to do or is does God have a different will than our requests so first confess and then ask God for the perfect will of God and then once we know God's will then we can go on acting like we're healed right or acting like we've already received what we got now I've said this before and I remember it caused a little bit confusion I did talk to some people afterwards but there's very few people that you and I know that walk around doing this like they walk around and and and what I mean is that there's very few people that walk around saying I know I've got thus saith the Lord before it happens see because revelation is a very rare thing right because somebody that's walking around like that they're saying they've got thus saith the Lord basically they're saying like like they're a prophet almost so it's very rare that we see people doing this and so many times like even in my life I've experienced when I pray for people and I find out their heel later many times I'll rejoice because I wasn't sure although I felt very sincere when I we pray for them but I'm not I'm not a prophet enough to know that God was gonna do it and I think that's how a lot of us are right most of us don't walk around you know saying oh I know God God spoke to my heart and gave me a voice and that now that that's all good that's wonderful but it just doesn't happen maybe like that all the time so what we must do is we must confess God's Word and and ask him to reveal his will to us in fact program says this he's talking about prayer cards and people will say oh I didn't even get a prayer card in the prayer line he said but look brother he said these people got prayer cards but that don't mean they're going to be healed there's people sitting on the audience that doesn't mean they're going to be healed that doesn't say they will or will not be healed that all depends on their faith in God amen so even if someone doesn't come up here for prayer no matter where they are even if they're live streaming here tonight it doesn't matter where they are they're healing or their answer from God all depends on one thing that's their faith and faith is a revelation is that right now here brother ham says it again huh me knows that's true no matter how religious you are or how good or bad you are unless the grace of God drops that into your heart you're never get well he says amen no matter how good or matter how holy you think you know I think I am we're never gonna really receive a revelation unless God's grace drops it down into her heart so what are we sure we're all at the mercy of God we're all at the grace of God we each one of us need grace how many company believe that Jesus brother said jesus promised if you could believe it would happen if you can't believe it it just won't happen now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe and the church said Amen I can't and I'm going to pray for this boy I just can't I just kind of I'm actually building my faith for that prayer through this message I can't trust in anything else I can only trust in the Word of God program says you cannot make yourself believe God has got to give it to you he says it's a gift of God to believe not your faith he said it's God's faith your intellectual faith might believe it's fine but unless the faith of God is down in your hearts eat your intellectual faith can accept it do that now here's what I like what he says and just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you I like that game ahem see just keep believing it until God does reveal it so see many times we don't know God's will to heal so we've got to just keep believing it and and using our intellectual understanding and and our in other words we gotta use our hope we've got a hope it's going to happen and keep confessing it will happen until God drops that genuine faith down in our hearts amen praise God boba have said now faith is a revelation from God now faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God praise the Lord I just want to meditate on that just for a few more moments keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you trust in the Lord with all your heart don't lean on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he'll make your paths straight praise God so church many times that's how I operate I'm sure you do too like remember when brother Simon and I prayed for my my friend's father which we're trying to see I got in contact with his son today and we're trying to set something up to maybe see him in about two weeks when we go back home actually it's actually next Monday to Mondays but brother Simon looked at it he saw a few things and I remember on the phone you know this this man has passed out he's in a coma and Simon tells me on the phone he's healed and he hasn't he's been out he has he's been unconscious for days and then I'd be honest in my heart I'm like okay brother you know I'm hoping it hadn't dropped down in my heart but I went the prayer closet anyway with all the faith in sincerity I spoke to that mountain of the heart trouble in the coma and I spoke and I commanded it to move in geez Christ's name now after I got a few encouraging now the next day when he opened his eyes and next day that really raised my faith but I'm just trying to show you like that drug that this healing dropped in Simon's heart before it dropped in my heart but see I just tried to keep confessing what he believed and put our faith together put my hope with his faith and just keep confessing it until God would drop it down in my heart amen and then pretty soon after a couple of weeks after each one well then it's over you know it's a reality praise God God has he's done it so that's a brother BAM says you cannot make yourself believe so he advises us just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you keep confessing and we see that a lot you know I see that a lot with brother Amen you know what I talked to him about you know how's his family doing and I just love how he always confesses God's gonna bring Lucy in God's gonna bring Lucy it God's gonna bring Lucy him yeah I love that I just love it's never a doubt or anything like that God's she's gonna come in he said she's gonna come in so it seems like God's revealed that to him and time will tell but I like how even let's say God hasn't either way he still got the right testimony he's still confessing what he believes God is going to do maybe not without maybe not with her thus saith the Lord but just believing because he's asked that God will do it I like that so I just wanted to revisit that here that the kingdom of God is not how smart we can me now I can put myself like I'm doing today I can fast and pray and I can preach God's Word and all these things but I can't make myself believe I'll tell you there's something down inside of me that already believes he can do it amen that's called the seed of God the Word of God but now to know that God is going to do it I don't know that yet but I'm trying to piece together the signs I'm trying to piece together what God's doing the season and see if this would be the season God would do it but there is something inside of you that knows God can do it praise God that's that seed of God the Bible said you're born again of the incorruptible seed which is the Word of God now I just want to read that now go to proverbs 18 I'm just gonna hit a few proverbs scriptures like I said I'll do about fifteen more minutes I don't mean to preach all day I do want to pray for that boy and I don't want to go too late remember about answers I think that's the most beautiful scripture trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding let's all trust the Lord today praise God proverbs 18:10 so Belgrad preach I think this sermon about five times letting off the pressure how many ever heard one of those proverbs 18:10 well his text was in Proverbs and of course this is a sermon where brother Branham always talks about all the pressure in the modern society proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run ahthe into it and is safe buh-bam says he says I want to use this he said letting off the pressure as a text I chose this because before coming to a meeting I always try to pray and try to seek the Lord not to stand before any congregation smaller great one to a million would be to stand there not to be seen or to be heard but to do something to glorify my lord there force the need of the people I wouldn't come here to be heard because I'm not much to listen to bad voice not an educated man and never stay with my text I skip all over from Genesis to Revelation and I'm not an eloquent speaker but I do love the Lord and I can't love Christ until first I love his people I've got to love his people so if I love his people then I love him praise God so so see Church this is a most important scripture it's so beautiful here to see that we must trust in the Lord we must just run to whatever the word says just run there and just camp out amen just to abide there like the Bible says just abide in him if you abide in him and his words abide in you then you can ask what you will and he'll do it for you why because he's anointing you amen right then he's revealed to you what the will of God is and that's what I'm trusting for tonight that all this anointing all the prayers I prayed all the the seeking God I've done I'm trusting that he'll anoint me to do his will to bring healing now I want to get back here now you sense a little bit more about proverbs 3 so I'm gonna go back to proverbs 3 verse 5 he says today we send our children to school to have understanding that after they are through the grammar schools we said in the high school for a better understanding of knowledge then after they're through there some children even fortune up to go to college so he caught it fortunate see some people say old programs that never go to college well he says they're fortunate to go you got to understand that he says or go through college to complete their education their understanding of knowledge many times to get a job you have to have at least a high school understanding or a college education and so forth yet though I Solomon told us not to lean to it not to our understanding lean not to these things because we wonder why that he would say such a thing is this first because that usually our modern understanding is usually the wisdom of man which is contrary to the Word of God I think that's what Solomon was trying to devise his sons not to be illiterate but to not lean to their understanding he said I think that's a good excerpt a ssin today if we said to our sons and to our sons and to the sons of God that it's alright to have an education there's nothing against that but when that education is contrary to the Word of God then lean to the word and let your education go glory lean to the word see because the word an education will stand and give you a good job probably get a good standing amongst intellectual people and that's alright which will probably be a great help to you help you in your financial your livelihood and make a living a little better for you amen I can see that my life you know my parents were factory worker when my dad was a factory worker my dad told me always go to college go to college son go to college son I'm the only one of my siblings that went to go I'm sorry not Paul did Paul and I got a degree and it's helped my livelihood it's helped me I have a little better living but I can't lean to that I've always gotta lean to the Word of God that's right now let's look at a few more Proverbs here all right if you got your now I want to bring a balance here brother branham's said there's a dishonouring proverb so I think I'll close with this thought I'll just go about 10 more minutes here let me close with this thought so we've heard some good proverbs tonight right like run into the tower the righteous run into it trust in the Lord with all your heart depart from all evil now brother Branham says here there's a dishonouring proverb he says like this let's go to proverbs 14:23 can you go to proverbs 14:23 okay proverbs 14:23 now let's look at this here in all labor there is what profit is it good to go to work brothers oh yeah God made you to work man that won't work shouldn't eat the Bible said but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury so see people that talk and never really go to work that's just though that's a wasted life we don't want we want our actions to speak louder than our words now go to second Thessalonians Lydia 3:10 second Thessalonians 3:10 so brother Branham said there's a there's a dishonouring proverb out there and these scriptures help bouncing it out in other words we've got to do something we've got to work and do things but then God will work at times as well so second Thessalonians 3:10 for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat so I think it's clear can everybody see a Christian will work right a Christians not lazy no but the random is preaching here in 1953 about expectancy about how the Jews were waiting for their Messiah for all these years and yet they're under Roman rulership and it's man said it seemed like that the birth of Christ was so far away and yet Christ was born right there in the midst of that Roman rulership everybody who said that's the way it is tonight many of you here may seem like that your time of deliverance is way away anybody ever feel like don't raise your hand don't confess that but man says many of you feel like your deliverance is way far away it's never gonna get here that healings never gonna get here that that baptism of Holy Ghost will never get here or the salvation of my family will never get here or the rapture was just seems like it's so far away but have said but sometime when it seems the farthest away and the darkest of our that's when you receive help from God but have said there's an old God dishonouring proverb dishonouring so this is a discounting proverb that says God helps only those who help themselves right how many of her doubt before people say well God only helps those who help themselves get up do something now that's true to some extent right because if people are lazy and sit around saying okay God send me a job but they never go look for a job well shame on them well god only helps me I can't help myself I can't give myself a job that's true but you can go fill out some applications and get a job you can elite that's the way I've always found jobs come to me when I go out and put applications in right you can't sit around say God send me money and not go through the process which God allows you to get money because there's profit in all labor the Bible says so brahim says see it's an old dishonouring proverb to God he said that's an heir god helps those who can't help themselves now brother Aaron is dealing with the supernatural realm in the natural realm we should be able to work in order to help ourselves right but in the supernatural we cannot help ourselves and program corrects that thought see some people will take that naturally which naturally we should take that God only helps those who help themselves that's right you need to go get it try and get a job you need to work hard you need to go learn you need to go to school but in the supernatural realm we have no power or no ability even Jesus Christ said I can do nothing except first the father shows me first and if he needs the leadership of God how much more do we need the leadership of God amen mom oh I need his leadership tonight praise God program said God helps those who help themselves that's an error god helps those who can't help themselves if you can help yourself you wouldn't need God's help but God has mercy on those who cannot help himself a men hallelujah he said now I'm skipping ahead to a different sermon the power of God Satan's power is limited faith power brings to pass gods revealed revelation god helps those who cannot act and help themselves that's how I'm thinking about this little boy tonight they're laying in the hospital bed Akron Children's he cannot help himself so there's one person that can that's Jesus Christ but manases see the old dishonouring God proverb that said God helps those who helped himself he said how ridiculous god helps those who can't help themselves amen oh isn't he wonderful the power of God what does it the power of God's the only thing that can give eternal life the power of God is the only thing it's the power of God that built a tree all the science in the world can't build a tree God's power built the tree God's power he said keeps me alive amen if God calls for you or the hospital the oxygen tents the pole motors in the world can't keep you here salvation is of the Lord it's God's power that feeds the sparrow amen or it's God's power that speaks to the little duck up yonder there's nobody up there and that shoes them off the lake and said and say go down to Louisiana no sir it's God power that shoes them off the link the little fellow don't know which way to go it's God's power that directs him south hallelujah it's God's power that directs them to Jesus Christ it's God's power that brought the wise men to the cradle amen it's God's power that listen thrills the soul of every believer God's power to help those who cannot help themselves Jorge whatever God does a miracle it ought to thrill your soul it ought to thrill us when God heals or God saves or God does something miraculous it ought to thrill us because it wasn't us it was God that did it and God only hope helps those who cannot help themselves or glory perfection 1956 he said look at all these isms rising up in the world today look at these cults of this non meat-eating group and a legalist that says I've got to do this and so and so if I don't speak with tongues if I don't do this if I don't shout if I don't dance there's something wrong with me he said that's legalism we're saved by grace through faith it's nothing what you done it's what he did he did what you couldn't do if you could have saved yourself then he wouldn't have had to die but he died in order to save you where you could not save yourself that old he said old God dishonouring proverb that says God helps those who can't help themselves or god helps those who help themselves they say that's just vice versa if you can help yourself God expects you to do it see there it is if you can help yourself God expect you to do it if there's medicine and right there I'll cost on the counter and you can help yourself and take some medicine God expects you to do it right he said but God helps those who cannot help their self and you can't help yourself to be saved so God by His grace a view glory Emory another one I tuned the meal offering he's speaking of the back sitting condition of Israel in the time of Elijah he said there's an old proverb god this unerring proverb that says God helps those who help themselves that's dishonorable to God God helps those who cannot help themselves he's the God of those who needs mercy and he is a merciful God and that proverb that says he who helps he helps those who help themselves if you can help yourself you don't need his help but he helps those who cannot help themselves amen praise God do you like that yeah so I hope you can see that that's clear right there that if if you could help yourself God expects you to do it there's anything you can do that you can help yourself do it but it's only when you cannot help yourself that's when God is gonna help you praise the Lord and it's God's power that's gonna help you and it's always a gift of grace praise God now let's look at what a couple more things here before we close hallelujah now let's look at because of this thought here with work I wanted to close another thought from worth it works his faith expressed par me well Bram says your actions or works show you already have faith or do not have faith he says remember works is faith express works show that faith has already took a hold see works shows that faith has already took a hold see so if you believe that God is going to do something you got to act upon it you've got to talk about it you've got to confess it you've got to act on it and let everybody know that your faith is moving you to work and do something for God's kingdom that's right remember brother Brian tells us the balance between Paul and James remember James says you're saved by works paul says you're saved by faith abraham tells us the balance he says bow to men were talking on faith Paul justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham but James justified Abraham by what man saw on Abraham Amen hallelujah so see all of us were the ones that we have to show each other our faith by our works we got to show it to you I've got to show my faith to you and I have to act upon what God's Word says and that's me showing my fate to you but that's that's what the Bible says that's what man sees but God sees that we already believe right God already sees that God sees our faith but then we got to act on it to prove it to everybody else because the Bible said make your calling and election sure praise God the Bible said prove all things amen if you believe gods are here if you believe God's our Savior if you believe God's in the the Great Commission then we've got to act upon what we believe and do something about it amen hallelujah remember Paul wrote what God saw James wrote what man saw an Abraham hallelujah works that faith has already took a hold I'm gonna closer this at Center feet let me close with this faith is a revelation I already read this one read again there's what I want to say it's revelation he revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith that's give to you by the grace of God amen it's given to you by the grace of God he said now I can't make you believe he said just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you just keep believing it until God does reveal it are you encouraged by the word of God tonight amen let's stand here as we pray by the grace of the Lord now would like banging a little bit I'd like you to anoint me with oil I would like I want to stand in for the boy and then I want to go pray for him I want to stand in for him and I'd like everybody to pray for me as well before I go to pray for him I've got I've got the Word of God in my heart I know God can do it God heal my momma cancer right God healed that Kylie Rose girl we fasted and prayed for her now God used science to do it well at least we'll we think I guess what you're not really sure but she was gonna die too but God healed her she hasn't had cancer enough for a year and we've seen God do that by His grace his mercy Christopher stopped having seizures you know God did that and so we've got to believe we know God can do it and so we want to keep confessing not try to work ourselves up but just to rest and trust in the Lord with all our hearts and not lean to our understanding keep confessing what we knows the truth what the Bible says we'll lean just lean heavy on the Word of God just can I just give you a picture just lean on this just lean on it that's what I need I thought doing right now I'm just leaning upon the promise of God because I want to see God move I don't want to work myself up into it I just want God to reveal his word to me his will to all of us that we do the will of God let's have a word of Prayer here Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word tonight Lord God your prophet said it's the most beautiful scripture trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not upon thine own understanding hallelujah we thank you for the education we received I'm sure all of us got a high school diploma dear God maybe except one or two of us adults father we are not leaning upon science we're not leaning upon opinions of men or women we're leaning upon the unchanging Word of God tonight and this is wisdom Lord wisdom for divine healing wisdom to find the will of God wisdom to know that if we can do something you expect us to do it you expect us to act upon what we know is true you expect us to depart from evil but nor when we reach the spot where we can't do anything else that's when you do it Thank You Lord God thank you Jesus you'll help us when we can't help ourselves anymore you'll help this little boy who can't help himself Lord God just like you helped that little girl Kylie just like you helped my mother when she couldn't help herself we're asking you Lord to help those who cannot help themselves we're asking Lord that you would anoint us Lord to act upon our faith
