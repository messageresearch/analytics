[0:00] and uh
[0:02] and they they slowly get they get your
[0:04] good graces you know they get your uh
[0:06] they get your relationship and then they
[0:09] introduce a false doctrine
[0:12] but the bible says they are ungodly men
[0:14] and they turned the grace of our god
[0:17] into lashiviousness
[0:19] or lawlessness
[0:21] and so
[0:22] we saw that that was the fifth doctrine
[0:24] we looked at that's the one we finished
[0:26] with on wednesday night i just want to
[0:28] say briefly that
[0:31] again as we as we've been uh discussing
[0:34] we're all on the highway to holiness
[0:35] we're on the way of holiness we'd say
[0:38] and our goal is to stay right in the
[0:40] middle of that road
[0:42] but if we're all honest we're all going
[0:44] to battle we're all going to fall short
[0:46] of god's glory and we'll just get off a
[0:48] little bit of the middle that's what
[0:49] we're praying and hoping
[0:52] and we just get off a little bit and
[0:53] then god brings us right back
[0:56] because paul said press toward the mark
[0:58] of the high calling in christ jesus
[1:01] and we were looking at even last week
[1:03] how different doctrines take people
[1:05] further than the middle than we would
[1:07] want to go that's why we stay away from
[1:09] some of those doctrines
[1:11] right like discrimination in churches
[1:13] and it's different manifestations
[1:16] uh
[1:17] and we'll look at a couple more than
[1:19] today here by god's grace but this is
[1:20] one of them you know uh once saved
[1:22] always saved that was the the five ones
[1:25] we looked at i'm going to almost slow a
[1:27] little slower going here because i'm
[1:28] trying to just review here
[1:31] but the promise that we have is if we
[1:32] have the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:34] will guide us into all truth amen that's
[1:37] the promise that we have and then jesus
[1:39] said in john 14 23 the holy ghost will
[1:41] teach you all things
[1:44] and so we have to look at that if just
[1:46] let's apply that to joshua's day okay
[1:48] now we know they didn't have the full
[1:50] soul holy ghost baptism but joshua
[1:53] fulfilled all the word of god for his
[1:55] day
[1:55] but not everybody in his not everybody
[1:58] in his church not everybody in the
[2:00] message of that day did
[2:02] right there was numerous tribes that
[2:03] didn't drive out all the inhabitants
[2:06] praise god so that's what we'll find the
[2:09] same today there's people that are going
[2:10] to fulfill all the commands for their
[2:12] day
[2:13] right they're going to be obedient to
[2:15] the the commands of god for their day
[2:16] like we would say martin luther john
[2:18] wesley william branham amen we believe
[2:21] all those people we believe all these
[2:22] people fulfilled the will of god for
[2:24] their day but then time moved on
[2:27] and then god has something more to
[2:29] reveal to each generation praise god
[2:33] so for our day we see the mysteries of
[2:35] god were finished right revelation 10 7
[2:37] fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6 luke 17 30.
[2:41] but as time goes on the holy spirit
[2:43] gives us more revelation praise god so
[2:46] we're able to understand things better
[2:48] like just one example was the 1977
[2:50] prediction we talked about right we can
[2:52] see now that brother brown was making a
[2:54] human prediction i'm sorry i don't have
[2:55] it plugged in yet because i was waiting
[2:56] for it to uh to update here okay so
[2:58] sorry about that
[3:00] so brother brown died and went to the
[3:02] grave
[3:03] thinking that uh
[3:05] total annihilation would happen by 77.
[3:07] well the years came and gone he never
[3:09] said it was from the lord he he even
[3:11] said i don't even know why i said it and
[3:13] then we found he was doing just some
[3:14] number calculations and he thought these
[3:16] three things kind of line up so i
[3:18] believe it'll be that he said but i
[3:19] don't say the lord told me that
[3:22] so he was just being a student of the
[3:23] word right
[3:25] but see as time goes on then you can see
[3:26] okay well uh time has made it given us a
[3:29] better understanding
[3:31] right time has given us a better
[3:33] understanding and we have to take
[3:35] everything brother brahm said back to
[3:36] the bible
[3:37] praise god
[3:39] and so as time goes on brother man's
[3:40] sons rise up right
[3:42] and we have to take everything they say
[3:44] back to the bible
[3:46] any preacher rises up any preacher
[3:49] anything any preacher says we've got to
[3:50] take it back to the bible
[3:52] because god is
[3:54] god is bringing the bride of christ into
[3:56] all truth
[3:58] where they live the full word of god
[4:00] amen
[4:01] but we know evil men and seducers are
[4:03] gonna trickle in and the bible says they
[4:06] creep in
[4:07] like we'd say
[4:08] cockroaches or something like that you
[4:10] know and that's being gentle that's
[4:12] being that's being very kind
[4:14] it is because the bible said they're
[4:16] ordained to condemnation
[4:19] but they look so nice they look they
[4:21] smile so good or they're they're dressed
[4:22] so handsome
[4:24] and as we said numer
[4:26] or many times they're behind the pulpit
[4:28] too
[4:30] and that's why we've got to be extremely
[4:31] careful uh to rightly divide the word of
[4:34] truth
[4:35] and so we saw that how brother brahms
[4:37] said
[4:38] brother brahm even said i can't prove
[4:40] that my name is is on the book of the of
[4:44] the lamb's book of life he said that in
[4:45] questions and answers on the seals they
[4:47] said brother mam can you prove you're
[4:48] there no i cannot prove it
[4:50] god could use me as a tool for something
[4:53] but i believe by faith i'm saved not by
[4:55] knowledge by faith that's the way he
[4:57] says we're all saved
[5:01] and so we see this idea here where
[5:04] uh
[5:06] where the enemy tries to come in and he
[5:08] tries to inject just something off the
[5:10] word
[5:11] and for each one that he does that
[5:13] there's a reason he's doing it he's
[5:15] trying to get people to accept an
[5:17] unclean spirit
[5:19] so let me show that list again here of
[5:21] some unclean spirits and i'm going to
[5:22] try to hook up now so we can show this
[5:25] here
[5:26] i just mentioned this on sunday briefly
[5:29] i'm sorry wednesday briefly
[5:33] okay so just give me a moment here
[5:34] there's i've been studying on the the
[5:36] evil spirits and also the numerous
[5:38] attributes of the holy spirit
[5:41] so paul said or jude said evil men are
[5:44] going to come in and they're going to
[5:45] try to rob you remember paul said that
[5:48] he said they're going to try to destroy
[5:49] you who is it it's going to be men
[5:50] behind the pulpit
[5:52] are going to come in and try to destroy
[5:53] now we can look over the years and we
[5:55] can see many
[5:56] preachers who've destroyed people's
[5:58] lives
[6:00] claiming to believe this message
[6:02] or you could just say in any christian
[6:04] church right you see him in every place
[6:06] like i was telling faith that yesterday
[6:08] i said just because we follow you know
[6:09] the message of of william branham
[6:12] and people do too that doesn't mean
[6:13] they're automatically saved
[6:15] like you a lot of people can recognize
[6:17] jesus was a prophet but then fall away
[6:19] from what like judas did right
[6:22] so we were thankful that the message has
[6:24] come and god did send us a prophet but
[6:25] now it's our responsibility to be so
[6:28] filled with the holy spirit that we can
[6:30] fulfill all the promises of god for our
[6:32] day praise god but these are all bible
[6:36] definitions of evil spirits right
[6:38] divination and familiar spirit which is
[6:41] invoking the dead and and then uh you
[6:43] know divination with susan making false
[6:46] prophecies right trying to predict the
[6:48] future
[6:51] uh jealousy is a demon
[6:53] lying is a demon there's a lot of that
[6:55] uh pervert now verse i don't have a
[6:58] we're gonna focus today on the spirit of
[6:59] whoredoms we're gonna look to that one
[7:01] here uh because i believe that's the
[7:03] most prevalent one
[7:05] because it's a spirit of idolatry and
[7:07] you you'll be you'll start saying oh
[7:08] yeah i remember that i remember reading
[7:09] that now once i get to that you'll say
[7:11] oh yeah yeah okay
[7:12] if you've read the church age book or
[7:13] listen to the the series on the church
[7:15] ages from 1960.
[7:18] now another major one this is my opinion
[7:20] among message people this is the major
[7:22] one for those who are sincere and even
[7:24] holy ghost filled the major one we have
[7:26] to battle is pride
[7:29] so i believe i'm holy ghost filled so
[7:31] what evil spirit do i battle the most
[7:32] probably pride
[7:34] if you're honest with yourself you might
[7:36] say amen too
[7:37] or or maybe maybe pride is not the
[7:40] season you're not battling that one
[7:41] because remember satan comes back for a
[7:42] season
[7:43] jesus defeat him but he's going to come
[7:45] back again
[7:47] or maybe your season is lust of the eyes
[7:49] you know you see that money out there
[7:50] you see the houses and you see that ma
[7:53] or you see uh immorally dressed women or
[7:55] whatever you're for women you know sexy
[7:57] men or you know it doesn't matter
[8:00] or lust of the flesh
[8:02] maybe it's uh overeating you know maybe
[8:04] it's uh
[8:06] nice clothes oh i feel good if i had
[8:08] that nice new jacket and nice new suit
[8:11] or that nice new dress and you already
[8:13] got nice ones
[8:15] you know
[8:17] so you know we go through seasons and
[8:19] even and holy ghostville people will
[8:21] battle these in seasons of their lives
[8:23] praise god that doesn't mean they're
[8:25] lost it doesn't mean they lost the seal
[8:26] you can't lose the seal it's sealed
[8:28] until the day of redemption amen
[8:30] but what will happen a place in your
[8:32] mind as we show those uh those video or
[8:34] those those images a place in your mind
[8:37] will get anointed with the wrong spirit
[8:38] that doesn't mean you're devil possessed
[8:40] it just means you've accepted the wrong
[8:42] idea
[8:43] and but it will impact you the bible
[8:45] says when you when we do that it grieves
[8:47] the holy spirit
[8:49] it offends the holy spirit
[8:52] okay so i believe pride will be the one
[8:53] that we battle the most
[8:55] uh
[8:57] now which one i think is battling the
[8:58] message people the most idolatry because
[9:00] they're worshiping brother branham yeah
[9:02] but church don't feel bad they worship
[9:04] paul too
[9:06] this ain't something new they worship
[9:08] john the baptist they said are you the
[9:09] christ we haven't seen a man preached
[9:10] like this and thousands of being
[9:12] baptized in the jordan river are you the
[9:14] christ he said i'm not the christ amen
[9:16] he said i'm only baptizing with water
[9:18] but there's one coming after me he'll
[9:20] baptize with the holy ghost amen
[9:23] but they wonder they wanted john they
[9:25] wanted john to be the christ
[9:27] paul said i'm glad i baptized none of
[9:29] you in corinth because you'd probably
[9:31] say i baptized using my name he said you
[9:33] need to be baptized in the name of the
[9:35] one that was crucified jesus christ amen
[9:39] and what's the catholic church do today
[9:40] they blasphemed the name of god and they
[9:43] baptized with titles father son holy
[9:44] ghost instead of catching the revelation
[9:47] that jesus said there's one name to the
[9:49] father son holy ghost as peter said on
[9:51] the day of pentecost be baptized in the
[9:53] name of jesus christ for the remission
[9:55] of sins and you shall receive the holy
[9:57] ghost amen
[10:02] now we can battle that too but i'm just
[10:04] saying that's the major one i think that
[10:06] demon is creeping in i know johnny and
[10:08] sarah see it too right no matter what
[10:09] church you go to right you see it
[10:11] creeping into people where they
[10:13] uh they put brother random up as a
[10:15] pedestal or they can idolize their
[10:16] pastor
[10:19] don't idolize me because i got a lot of
[10:20] failures i'm really i'm really going to
[10:21] disappoint you
[10:22] i'm just much a man as anybody
[10:25] you idolize anybody eventually you're
[10:27] going to be discouraged because
[10:29] they're going to fall short of god's
[10:30] glory
[10:32] now heaviness this is another one too
[10:34] depression
[10:35] in a like brother man says in the church
[10:37] book when we have all these
[10:39] gadgets
[10:42] when we have all these machines
[10:45] and yet we're depressed and discouraged
[10:47] you know we
[10:49] they save us so much time yet we feel
[10:51] like we've got no time how many feel
[10:52] like you've got no time don't you don't
[10:53] have to raise your hands
[10:54] i mean all these things that save us
[10:55] time and then we go like we have no time
[10:58] so what's the revelation you in other
[11:00] words you got to enjoy god while you're
[11:01] doing the dishes or worship god while
[11:04] you're spending time with a family or
[11:05] worship god on the drive to church you
[11:07] just have to learn to find god's
[11:09] presence in everything you do praise god
[11:11] because everybody always has the same
[11:12] amount of time we all have the same
[11:14] amount of time but it's keeping the
[11:15] attitude of thankfulness amen keeping
[11:17] the attitude of worship amen in in all
[11:20] in other words recognizing god's
[11:22] presence in every era of our lives amen
[11:28] like for me you know for me i have to
[11:29] get up early that's but not everybody
[11:31] can do that especially moms you know
[11:33] it's hard to get up early when the
[11:34] baby's crying and he's the nurse or
[11:36] needs a diaper change you know
[11:38] so that's what i'm saying we have to for
[11:40] each of us we have to find where we can
[11:43] spend the time with the lord and god
[11:45] will give us victory to lead us out of
[11:48] our depression or leave us out of our
[11:49] nervousness
[11:51] the anxieties of life
[11:53] spending time with the holy spirit and
[11:55] then in god's presence is fullness of
[11:57] joy amen hallelujah thank god amen
[12:00] now we'll get to idolatry a little bit
[12:02] that's what i think strikes the message
[12:04] people the most that are off the word
[12:06] those that are on the word i think pride
[12:08] is the one that strikes them
[12:12] now infirmity is like a sickness so
[12:14] cancer would be infirmity
[12:16] right uh tuberculosis would be an
[12:18] infirmity anything that weakens your
[12:20] body that torments your body
[12:22] deaf and dumb of course uh can't talk
[12:24] and can't listen that's a demon a deaf
[12:26] and dumb demon
[12:28] a spirit of fear that's when we battle
[12:29] as well especially with the war right
[12:32] uh the media loves to push that out war
[12:34] war war what about them dropping a bomb
[12:37] on us you know what about that what
[12:39] about the seventh vision you know see
[12:41] if we don't if we don't uh deal with
[12:43] these situations if we don't take them
[12:45] to god in prayer we can eat we can
[12:47] easily get a spirit of fear
[12:49] but the bible says perfect love cast out
[12:51] all fear praise god
[12:53] and the only fear we need to have is
[12:55] fear of god amen hallelujah that's a
[12:57] healthy fear praise god
[13:00] then there's a seducing spirit which
[13:01] means a deceiving spirit remember that
[13:03] this age is the most deceiving age
[13:07] so that spirit is truly working there
[13:09] all these demons are working but that
[13:11] one is truly working this day because
[13:13] the bible said evil men and seducers
[13:15] will get worse and worse
[13:18] right this isn't the darkest day this
[13:20] isn't the uh the it's not the darkest
[13:22] day that was the dark ages was the
[13:23] darkest day where hardly anybody had a
[13:25] bible
[13:27] i mean they hardly had any access to
[13:28] anything they so limited the word of god
[13:31] but we got bibles amen we got bibles on
[13:33] our phones we got bibles in our houses
[13:35] amen we can just speak to our phone and
[13:37] say read me the bible and it'll read the
[13:38] bible man
[13:40] i mean look at we have so much
[13:42] there praise god
[13:44] but
[13:44] at the same time we've got demons trying
[13:46] to push in praise god and so we need the
[13:48] holy spirit to raise up a standard amen
[13:51] raise up a protection praise god raise
[13:54] up a battle cry against these evil
[13:56] spirits that come in amen
[13:58] hallelujah in other words you've got to
[13:59] have zeal you you and i have to have
[14:01] zeal to fight for for holiness we have
[14:04] to we have to recognize i'm in a battle
[14:06] here now you may have a period of rest
[14:08] but i'm saying after you come out of
[14:08] that now you got a period of battle
[14:10] praise god
[14:11] we might have that season of rest praise
[14:13] god i don't feel the enemies all but
[14:15] pretty soon those devils are going to
[14:16] come back to you praise god and you got
[14:18] to overcome amen it's another test it's
[14:20] another opportunity god is saying that
[14:22] you can overcome god is showing the
[14:24] devil that they won't deny my faith they
[14:27] won't deny the word of god they will be
[14:29] faithful amen and it's going to make you
[14:30] stronger amen and in every temptation
[14:32] god makes a way of escape hallelujah
[14:35] amen
[14:37] the seducing is worse than ever before
[14:40] according to paul according to the holy
[14:42] bible
[14:44] spirit of air
[14:45] is anything that's off the truth
[14:49] and then we looked at this yesterday the
[14:50] bible said yesterday
[14:51] israel has the spirit of blindness or
[14:53] slumber because of their unbelief so yes
[14:55] god give god god god did give them over
[14:58] to a spirit of slumber
[15:00] because they would not believe in jesus
[15:02] christ
[15:03] that's what the bible says
[15:05] now i think now i have question marks on
[15:07] these some of these spirits may be
[15:09] unclean like an unclean spirit or foul
[15:11] spirit that might be all spirits right
[15:13] because they're all unclean
[15:15] all spirits would be bondage right
[15:17] because they they they take people into
[15:18] bondage to lie they then they're
[15:20] addicted to lying or they're addicted to
[15:21] jealousy right or they're addicted to
[15:23] depression can you imagine that people
[15:25] like some people like being depressed
[15:28] right they like feeling depressed just
[15:30] like people like committing adultery and
[15:32] fornication same thing they like feeling
[15:34] down
[15:35] right they've learned to love and
[15:36] worship that spirit
[15:38] instead of loving the holy spirit praise
[15:40] god
[15:41] see it's such a thing we have to make
[15:43] sure like jesus said the greatest
[15:45] commandment is to love god with all your
[15:47] heart soul mind and strength amen we
[15:49] must love the joy of the lord we must
[15:51] love the victory of the lord we must
[15:53] love thanksgiving of the lord amen we
[15:55] must love the judgment of the lord we
[15:56] must love the mercy of the lord we must
[15:59] love being a real holy ghost christian
[16:01] and manifesting god's nature to our
[16:04] families amen
[16:05] and our church we must love that more
[16:07] than we love being depressed
[16:10] right
[16:11] because you know why some people like
[16:12] being depressed because they get more
[16:13] attention oh you look down you poor
[16:16] little baby how can i help you
[16:19] they they feed off that attention and
[16:22] they never really get victory right and
[16:24] and really that devil's trying to get
[16:26] you to be depressed for them too
[16:29] rather than recognize it's to bring them
[16:31] up it's to bring up you know they're
[16:33] they're depressed there to be able to
[16:34] say for us to be able to say you know
[16:37] you can overcome that depression let me
[16:38] encourage you let me give you a word of
[16:40] encouragement
[16:41] or let me say like this david encouraged
[16:43] himself in the lord so why don't you go
[16:44] encourage yourself in the lord
[16:47] and that was under the blood of bulls
[16:48] and goats amen
[16:49] that wasn't even under the blood of
[16:50] jesus christ praise god
[16:53] in other words all of us have a free
[16:54] more agency decision we can either
[16:56] continue in sin or we can choose to
[16:58] escape it hallelujah
[17:00] because it's a snare it's a trap satan
[17:02] is set up and we've got to recognize
[17:04] this is a trap and i'm not going to get
[17:06] my foot caught in this mouse trap right
[17:08] as like a mouse i'm not going to get
[17:09] caught in this trap i'm not going to get
[17:11] caught on this i'm not i'm going to
[17:13] overcome this i'm going to sidestep this
[17:15] and i'm going to keep moving forward on
[17:16] the gospel way amen
[17:18] i'm going to keep walking forward on the
[17:20] narrow way i'm not going to get trapped
[17:21] here where i can't move on with god we
[17:23] want to move on we want to grow closer
[17:25] to god we want to be ready for his
[17:27] appearing and we don't want any weights
[17:29] of sin we want to run the race with
[17:31] revelation amen
[17:33] with strength hallelujah
[17:35] we want to run the race the bible says
[17:37] with no hindrances amen
[17:42] and i would think all spirits are
[17:43] antichrist because it means
[17:46] it means an adversary of christ and that
[17:49] means an opponent
[17:50] all evil spirits are opponents of the
[17:52] holy spirit
[17:53] right
[17:54] and all spirits are worldly
[17:56] so there is some overlap here church
[18:00] and then i show this to the church as
[18:01] well and then i went read the bible
[18:03] because i got this thought from a book i
[18:04] was showing you that book a while back
[18:06] about evil spirits
[18:07] then the holy spirit though gives you
[18:10] all these anointings to combat and
[18:12] overcome the devils
[18:15] so if you need wisdom say jesus anoint
[18:17] me with a spirit of wisdom amen
[18:20] that's all you got to say
[18:22] cry out for that
[18:23] like cry out to your father ask your
[18:25] that's what we ended wednesday too ask
[18:27] your father if you ask if if a child
[18:29] asks a father for a fish he's not gonna
[18:31] give him a scorpion he's gonna give him
[18:32] a fish praise god
[18:34] if you ask for the holy ghost if you ask
[18:36] for some of these leadings god is gonna
[18:38] give it to you just wait on the lord
[18:40] amen and ask with the right motive and
[18:43] objective
[18:44] see wisdom god will give it to you need
[18:46] understanding god will give it to you
[18:47] these are all holy spirit anointings
[18:49] judgment right to judge right from wrong
[18:52] uh discernment as well burning that's
[18:54] the burning
[18:55] like the bible said our hearts burn
[18:56] within us as he talked to us along the
[18:58] way that's the burning fire of
[19:00] conviction hallelujah we need that jesus
[19:03] said o fools slow of heart to believe
[19:06] all the things the prophets have said in
[19:07] luke 24. he said did not our hearts burn
[19:10] within us as he was rebuking us along
[19:12] the way see when god rebukes you there
[19:14] should be a burning in your heart to
[19:16] show you i love you but you're wrong and
[19:18] you need to be corrected you need to
[19:20] accept the truth hallelujah
[19:23] you need to get rid of the spirit of air
[19:25] or the spirit of of seducing and accept
[19:27] the spirit of truth hallelujah
[19:30] amen
[19:34] sometimes church this is like i said if
[19:36] bride members are going to battle the
[19:37] pride if wise virgins are going to
[19:38] battle the pride then many times we need
[19:40] a spirit of humility
[19:42] a spirit of meekness help me to be more
[19:44] meek lord now we can all use this when
[19:46] we get discouraged lord give me a
[19:48] garment of praise
[19:49] help me when i go to church not to be
[19:51] depressed help me to praise the lord
[19:52] amen
[19:53] help me to put on my praise and
[19:55] thanksgiving and all my shouts to god
[19:58] and all my worship to god help me to
[20:00] have joy in my life amen help me to be a
[20:02] thankful for all that you've done
[20:05] amen
[20:06] lord give me a spirit of grace and
[20:08] supplications the bible says
[20:10] supplication is prayer for individuals
[20:12] that's what we're doing today with the
[20:12] prayer clause
[20:14] we're praying for supplication we're
[20:16] asking god for these special needs
[20:18] that god will minister to them
[20:21] the spirit of truth is the holy spirit
[20:22] the holy spirit is power amen we need a
[20:24] miracle right power also power in your
[20:27] daily life to overcome
[20:28] the spirit of love we're lacking love
[20:31] lord anoint me with love
[20:33] spirit of a sound mind my mind is going
[20:35] crazy lord anoint my mind amen
[20:37] to think the right thing
[20:39] a spirit of holiness the bible says
[20:42] i need i need to live a separated life
[20:44] holiness means separated or consecrated
[20:46] that means set aside when you're holy
[20:48] you're set aside for god's service
[20:50] you're not in the service of the world
[20:51] or enjoying the lust of the world you
[20:52] are set aside and god can use you as he
[20:55] wants to use you
[20:57] a spirit of life the bible says so death
[21:00] opposite death life jesus said my words
[21:02] are spirit and they are life amen
[21:05] the spirit of adoption that's
[21:06] relationship
[21:08] so church god is when you when you're
[21:10] born again you have the spirit of
[21:12] adoption
[21:13] god is your father and as we said if you
[21:15] need something from dad just ask dad
[21:18] praise god
[21:19] i used to beg my dad all the time hey
[21:21] can we go buy some baseball cards and my
[21:23] dad almost every time even though we
[21:24] were
[21:25] poor he would do it
[21:27] he said okay how about saturday jesse
[21:29] all right okay yeah i'm gonna buy this
[21:31] uh these baseball cards football cards i
[21:33] mean every time i ask my dad for
[21:34] something almost every time you give it
[21:35] to me
[21:36] and i'm the same way with my kids they
[21:38] want to go out and get some uh panera or
[21:40] they're gonna go out get some chipotle
[21:41] okay i'll get it for you okay just be
[21:42] patient you know with some fruit strips
[21:44] i'll get you some fruit strips just be
[21:45] patient
[21:46] you know as a if i love my children i'm
[21:49] going to give them what's best now the
[21:50] difference is god knows the beginning
[21:52] from the end and i don't praise god
[21:54] that's the difference but i'm just
[21:55] making the point that god loves you and
[21:57] god wants to give you all these spirit
[21:58] the bible says we have all spiritual
[22:01] blessings in christ jesus amen
[22:05] god doesn't want us to become slaves to
[22:06] sin or god doesn't want us to have uh
[22:11] god doesn't want to have complexes
[22:13] for long periods of time when we could
[22:15] be overcoming
[22:17] now we're going to have to have them at
[22:18] times to learn
[22:20] okay
[22:21] and to understand how to fight and how
[22:23] to become a better christian
[22:25] but god wants us to choose the right
[22:27] praise god the bible says perfect
[22:29] holiness in the fear of god
[22:32] so god desires for a perfect walk that's
[22:34] what he told abraham he said you're he
[22:35] said you're 90 years old or 90 years and
[22:37] i believe 90 if i'm not mistaken he said
[22:40] i am the almighty god walk before me be
[22:43] thou perfect amen
[22:44] hallelujah
[22:46] god told him be thou perfect in other
[22:48] words be a complete believer believe all
[22:51] the word amen lay aside the things that
[22:53] are easily besetting you and obey me and
[22:55] follow me and obey the truth of god's
[22:57] word
[22:58] but church even abraham backs it i was
[23:00] listening brother brown this week
[23:02] the demonology the religious sermon
[23:04] do you know when uh abraham
[23:07] when he lied to abimelech about sarah
[23:09] brother brahm said he was a backslidden
[23:12] lying little shyster now that's pretty
[23:14] harsh words
[23:17] he lied to abimelech that's what brother
[23:18] man said he was but abraham the prophet
[23:21] he was a backslidden prophet
[23:25] but now look at this
[23:26] abimelech though was a heathen king
[23:30] right a philistine king
[23:32] but he still prayed to god and somehow
[23:34] he had a contact with god
[23:36] but abraham was the prophet of the day
[23:39] now over all church i want you to catch
[23:41] us abimelech was not a more holy man
[23:43] than abraham abraham was a more holy man
[23:45] but when abraham came there and lied at
[23:47] that moment he was baxter and he was in
[23:49] a worse spiritual condition than
[23:50] abimelech
[23:52] because abimelech said god you know the
[23:54] integrity of my heart i would never take
[23:56] another man's wife
[23:58] but what about the integrity of
[23:59] abraham's heart
[24:01] he just lied to save his own skin he
[24:04] said take my wife don't take me because
[24:05] he knew that he'd probably kill abraham
[24:07] right
[24:08] so he's a lying brother abraham said
[24:10] another place he was a coward a church
[24:12] if we're honest sometimes we're afraid
[24:14] to witness
[24:15] so see i'm not we're not bashing abraham
[24:17] but we're just relating to abraham
[24:20] because we're children of abraham amen
[24:22] hallelujah by faith in christ we are
[24:24] children of abraham
[24:26] but the point was overall abraham was a
[24:28] the real prophet of god for that day but
[24:30] god he found abimelech and he came there
[24:32] in a backseating condition but what did
[24:34] god say he said don't touch sarah he
[24:37] said because that man is my prophet amen
[24:40] hallelujah but he just found him in a
[24:42] backseating condition
[24:44] now why didn't god hide abraham's sin to
[24:46] abimelech
[24:48] because every man falls short of the
[24:50] glory of god
[24:51] and god didn't want abimelech worshiping
[24:53] abraham and the church said
[24:56] but god said listen it bleh i know you
[24:58] didn't want to sin against me that's why
[24:59] i kept you from sinning against me but i
[25:01] said this baroness is going to stay in
[25:03] your house until you pray for until my
[25:06] prophet prays for you amen
[25:08] my goodness
[25:09] so see it proved abraham was the real
[25:11] spiritual man of that day but he was
[25:13] caught in a backseating condition a
[25:15] season of weakness but god still used it
[25:17] praise god god used it to eventually
[25:20] hallelujah bring out a seed a seed word
[25:23] son isaac amen god eventually brought
[25:26] the promised son amen so despite our
[25:29] faults despite our affairs despite our
[25:31] little backsidings in our mind despite
[25:33] all these things the promised son will
[25:35] be revealed and you and i man
[25:37] hallelujah i'm talking about the baptism
[25:39] of the holy ghost i'm talking about the
[25:41] rapture praise god
[25:42] that's what we know whether we live or
[25:44] die god will fulfill his word if we're
[25:46] the seed of abraham just hang on to
[25:48] god's word confess your faults and move
[25:51] on with god
[25:53] amen
[25:55] hallelujah
[25:58] adoption
[25:59] god's my father
[26:01] so when i need something i go to the
[26:02] lord
[26:05] now as a wise daddy he's not going to
[26:06] give you everything he asked for
[26:09] right but he's going to give you what's
[26:10] essential for you
[26:12] what do you need at that moment
[26:14] also he's going to anoint you with a
[26:15] spirit of faith
[26:17] he's anoint you with the spirit of
[26:18] promise the bible says he's going to
[26:20] anoint you with the spirit of revelation
[26:23] brother ram says to pray for this one
[26:24] more than all the others
[26:27] and that's the prophet's recommendation
[26:28] that wasn't thus saith the lord but that
[26:30] was his recommendation
[26:31] pray for the revelation of god's perfect
[26:34] will more than anything
[26:36] that's a wise that's wise counsel
[26:39] and then there's a spirit of prophecy
[26:40] that comes along right it anoints people
[26:43] and foretells the future
[26:45] praise god and then there's what the
[26:46] bible calls a fervent spirit which is a
[26:49] a diligent spirit a devoted spirit right
[26:52] a working spirit right and you're
[26:54] anointed with that lord give me more
[26:56] fervency in my family give me more
[26:58] fervency for my my prayer life amen
[27:01] give me more fervency for listening to
[27:03] more tapes and give me more fervency for
[27:05] saying amen and for reading my bible and
[27:07] witnessing and praying for people give
[27:08] me more fervency amen
[27:11] see these all come from the lord amen
[27:14] these are all anointings of god now as i
[27:16] said i want to get to that uh one i got
[27:18] a whole lot i could preach here but yeah
[27:19] let me just do this one here
[27:21] just gonna try to follow the leadership
[27:22] of the holy spirit today now as i said
[27:24] the evil spirit of whoredoms or idolatry
[27:27] is one
[27:29] uh that's very prevalent and that's
[27:31] because as i've been studying the
[27:33] scripture
[27:35] the evil spirit of whoredom causes men
[27:37] to break the first commandment
[27:40] right so you have the ten commandments
[27:42] jesus jesus quotes them in the new
[27:44] testament as well
[27:45] they're part of the moral law of god
[27:47] we're not under the law but the bible
[27:49] says we fulfill the righteousness of the
[27:52] law in other words the holy commandments
[27:54] from the old testament
[27:55] many of them the moral law god carries
[27:57] over to the new testament
[27:59] amen that's what if you don't know that
[28:01] one read romans 8. i know i got spies
[28:03] listening and things like that read
[28:04] romans 8.
[28:06] we fulfill the righteousness of the law
[28:08] because the law is holy
[28:11] now some of the laws of course the
[28:12] priesthood that was all done away in
[28:13] christ
[28:14] right we know that we have a new
[28:15] priesthood now not the aaronic
[28:17] priesthood we have the melchizedek
[28:18] priesthood now
[28:20] but the first command was no other gods
[28:23] before me
[28:24] nor there no graven image or likeness of
[28:26] anything that's in heaven or earth or
[28:27] under the water but yet remember the
[28:29] same guy that said this said go build
[28:31] two cherubims
[28:33] in other words he's saying don't build
[28:34] something to bow down and worship to it
[28:37] but you build things if you need them if
[28:39] they're going to help you build them
[28:41] right like the cherubim help them
[28:42] recognize this is what god's
[28:44] this is what god's throne looks like in
[28:45] heaven
[28:46] okay
[28:48] now he says showing mercy unto them that
[28:50] are that love me and keep my
[28:52] commandments so the first commandment
[28:53] deals with love
[28:56] have no other gods because god says i
[28:58] want your love
[29:00] i'm worthy of your love
[29:02] praise god
[29:04] now
[29:04] this is why jesus taught loving god with
[29:06] your entire being is the greatest
[29:08] commandment there's nothing greater than
[29:10] making sure every day i'm going to
[29:12] choose to love god's word i'm going to
[29:14] choose to love god
[29:16] i'm going to give all my strength mind
[29:19] body soul you'll never be wrong when you
[29:21] start your day like that i want to
[29:22] direct my love to heaven amen i would
[29:25] direct my love to jesus christ
[29:26] hallelujah that's why i put on that
[29:29] video don't go to your phone first
[29:30] because that could redirect your love
[29:31] away from god
[29:33] i had somebody uh text me last week and
[29:35] said thank you for making that video i
[29:36] was going to my phone the first thing
[29:37] and that video showed me go to the bible
[29:39] first
[29:40] right or go to the go to prayer first
[29:43] because if not it'll take your love and
[29:45] then you might you know you might love
[29:46] something else more
[29:48] you might love sports you might love
[29:49] politics more you know you might be
[29:51] deceived into something and you start
[29:52] loving that more than you love god
[29:55] right
[29:56] so he said which is the first
[29:57] commandment of all jesus
[29:59] is this hear o israel the lord our god
[30:01] is one lord thou shalt love the lord thy
[30:03] god with all thy heart thy soul thy mind
[30:05] and thy strength this is the first
[30:07] commandment and the second
[30:08] is like name of this thou shalt love thy
[30:10] neighbor as thyself there's none other
[30:12] commandment greater than these and the
[30:14] church said
[30:16] so love
[30:17] the first commandment is about love i've
[30:20] got to love god first
[30:23] this is why jesus said
[30:25] loving darkness more than light makes
[30:27] someone condemned and go to hell
[30:29] see so that means you can love god a
[30:31] little bit but if you love sin more then
[30:33] you're not
[30:34] saved because that's what jesus said
[30:37] this is right after john 3 16 for god so
[30:39] loved the world he gave his only
[30:40] begotten son
[30:41] and this is the condemnation this is the
[30:43] judgment that light has come into the
[30:45] world and men loved darkness rather than
[30:47] light because their deeds were evil for
[30:50] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[30:52] light neither cometh to the light lest
[30:53] his deed should be reproved see that's
[30:55] that burning right there there's that
[30:56] burning amen see the spirit of burning
[30:58] the holy spirit burns in your spirit and
[31:01] it's letting you know it convicts you
[31:03] you're guilty you're wrong stop loving
[31:05] that and it's trying to burn out that
[31:07] desire amen
[31:09] hallelujah is trying to get you to
[31:11] crucify that desire and obey the desire
[31:13] of god and to desire the things god
[31:16] wants you to desire there it is
[31:20] but he that doeth truth comes to the
[31:22] light comes to the word that his deeds
[31:24] may be manifest that they are wrought in
[31:26] god
[31:28] remember the book of acts when all those
[31:29] uh those
[31:31] shoe sayers remember when they got saved
[31:33] the bible said they brought their books
[31:35] of witchcraft and they brought them out
[31:37] in the street and burned them that's
[31:39] exactly what jesus loves amen
[31:41] hallelujah bring all the take them out
[31:43] of my life i just want my works to
[31:45] glorify you i want to love you i want my
[31:47] whole life to magnify you i'm coming to
[31:50] the light take me out of darkness amen
[31:53] hallelujah
[31:55] this is right after john 3 16. once
[31:56] saved always saved that's not
[31:58] true what about john 3 16 well what
[32:01] about john 3 19
[32:03] through 21 what about that
[32:05] see don't think about that they keep
[32:06] moving on with the lord see they know
[32:08] god to a point they know god to john 3
[32:10] 16 but they fail to go on to the next
[32:12] step
[32:13] it's a long road to the promised land
[32:14] church
[32:15] hallelujah you don't get there with one
[32:17] step you don't get there with one
[32:19] scripture amen you got to keep moving on
[32:21] amen keep progressing keep traveling
[32:24] footsteps is possession possess the land
[32:26] amen that god has given you
[32:31] now here's what i want to start breaking
[32:32] this thought here what is really
[32:34] idolatry
[32:36] idolatry really is spiritual
[32:39] fornication
[32:41] or another word would be a spiritual
[32:43] union because what is natural
[32:44] fornication it's a union of a sexual
[32:46] union before marriage so it's unlawful
[32:48] union
[32:50] so idolatry is a spiritual form of that
[32:53] it's uniting with something else loving
[32:56] it's loving something else being empty
[32:59] yeah it is there it is being intimate
[33:00] with something else other than the holy
[33:02] spirit
[33:04] all right
[33:06] so we're learning today
[33:10] balaam got israel to commit fornication
[33:12] do you know that physical fornication is
[33:14] the very same spirit that lies in
[33:17] organized religion
[33:19] and that just struck me that's why all
[33:20] these denominations allow people to
[33:22] divorce remarry divorce remarry divorce
[33:25] remarry they allow the natural adultery
[33:28] and natural fornication because they're
[33:30] spiritual fornicators
[33:32] right
[33:34] that's why they take a denomination say
[33:36] this is only god can only move in a
[33:37] lutheran way
[33:39] god can only move in a wesley way right
[33:43] or like today god can only move in a
[33:44] tapeway
[33:45] i'm careful saying that but see people
[33:48] they'll worship the tapes
[33:50] see what i mean by that is like 1977 or
[33:53] joseph is a prophet that's what i mean
[33:54] not every word on the tape is thus saith
[33:56] the lord
[33:58] she's a little worship
[34:00] everything i believe has to be on the
[34:01] tapes well then you need to move to
[34:02] jeffersonville and worship that man you
[34:04] know that's what you need to do
[34:06] but you're not going to do that if
[34:07] you're a real believer praise god
[34:10] because you have the holy spirit today
[34:12] to guide you into all truth praise god
[34:14] amen lord said if you have the holy
[34:16] ghost it can only point you to the
[34:18] scripture praise god amen hallelujah if
[34:21] you have the holy ghost it'll only point
[34:23] to the word of god the word of god says
[34:25] this the word of god says that yes we're
[34:26] thankful for the tapes but we have to
[34:28] take them back to the word of god see
[34:30] it's organized religion the spirit of
[34:33] fornication the spirit of whoredoms
[34:37] so now we know an organization is it's a
[34:39] spirit of whoredom it's a it's a
[34:41] spiritual from a left christ right
[34:43] and it goes to
[34:45] goes to evil
[34:46] spirits i said that the spirit of
[34:49] fornication is spirit of organization
[34:51] and all fornicators will have their
[34:52] place in the lake of fire and that is
[34:54] what god thinks of organization yes sir
[34:56] the and her daughters will be in
[34:57] the lake of fire
[34:58] so the catholic church system and all
[35:00] the other systems those spirits behind
[35:02] that they'll all be in the lake of fire
[35:05] yes
[35:07] another church age book quote they're
[35:09] partaking in the well-known babylonian
[35:11] satanic religion have joined themselves
[35:13] to idols and committed spiritual
[35:14] fornication which means death
[35:17] so any idol becomes uh
[35:21] a connection or a false union having any
[35:24] idol in our lives is a false union and
[35:26] that's spiritual fornication
[35:29] and so there's pronounce a curse against
[35:32] idolatry right and we know that we
[35:33] preached on curses a couple years ago
[35:35] now it might be a couple years ago
[35:39] right any sin brings some type of
[35:41] temporary
[35:42] effect on it right and the bible calls
[35:44] it a curse
[35:47] okay
[35:49] here's that prophet is called jezebel
[35:50] and she is teaching the people a woman
[35:53] teaching the people
[35:54] the spirit of jezebel and her teaching
[35:56] is seducing the servants of god and what
[35:58] did her teaching lead to committing
[36:00] fornication
[36:02] now fornication means idol worship
[36:04] that's what jezebel did in the natural
[36:06] right that's what the catholic church
[36:07] does in the natural today too right
[36:09] that's like we just said almost every
[36:10] denomination allows fornication and
[36:12] adultery
[36:15] but it's really spiritual fornication
[36:17] behind that
[36:19] in other words they love they love sin
[36:21] otherwise they love sin that they
[36:22] worship that sin and that becomes the
[36:24] spirit of whoredom on them
[36:27] that's what a spirit that's what it's
[36:28] spiritual meaning is it's an illegal
[36:30] union ahab's union and constantine's
[36:32] union were both illegal both committed
[36:35] spiritual fornication every fornicator
[36:37] will end up in the lake of fire god said
[36:39] so see if they don't repent before they
[36:41] die say god forgive me of sleeping
[36:43] around god forgive me of adultery god
[36:45] forgive me of this if they don't do that
[36:47] they'll burn in the lake of fire because
[36:49] they love darkness more than they love
[36:51] life but thank god for the light amen
[36:53] thank god that we can see where we are
[36:55] thank god we're not children of darkness
[36:57] but our eyes are open and the coming of
[36:59] the lord will not take us as a thief in
[37:01] the night amen
[37:03] our eyes are wide open hallelujah
[37:06] we see the spirits working in the
[37:07] churches we see the spirits working
[37:09] around the world we see these spirits
[37:14] so i'm just trying to simplify this
[37:16] church so fornication is an illegal
[37:18] union of love
[37:20] naturally so fornication is loving and
[37:23] idle right loving idolatry so in
[37:26] fornication uh if a man and woman
[37:28] committed then that uh they're
[37:29] worshiping right uh that man let's just
[37:32] use the man that man is worshiping that
[37:33] woman right because instead of honoring
[37:36] god loving god he's loving that woman
[37:37] more
[37:39] illegal union
[37:40] but this is the same thing a spirit of
[37:42] fornication is the spirit of
[37:44] organization as well
[37:47] and organization equals fornication or
[37:49] love for an idol or a false god system
[37:53] so it's a false god
[37:55] so i i don't know if that helps or not i
[37:57] sure hope that i was just saying lord
[37:58] help me to be able to make it so clear
[38:01] that a spirit a spirit of fornication
[38:03] right naturally that's that's all that's
[38:05] happening with churches and
[38:06] denominations they're just loving creeds
[38:09] they're loving sin and worshiping that
[38:10] that becomes an idol to them
[38:13] and then when you ask them are you a
[38:14] christian i'm a methodist
[38:16] i'm a catholic see that shows the union
[38:18] they've had they've not had a union with
[38:20] christ they've had a union with a
[38:22] denominational they've had a union with
[38:23] a spirit but thank god when we say when
[38:25] they ask are we christians i'm a holy
[38:27] ghost-filled christian amen
[38:29] hallelujah
[38:31] i've had a union with christ amen
[38:33] christ is my husband the bible says in
[38:35] romans chapter seven amen
[38:37] it's jesus christ
[38:42] now here's this quote brother brahm says
[38:43] i'm just now bringing down to our day
[38:45] because we all have idols in our lives
[38:46] at times
[38:48] right at some point
[38:50] right we'll all make an idol
[38:53] and ahab had knuckled down into his his
[38:55] idolater wife and brought it brought all
[38:57] israel into idolatry and you'd say well
[38:59] then brother brandon you compare it to
[39:00] today to our nation yes sir our nation
[39:02] oh it's greatly covered over with
[39:03] idolatry we might not worship wooden
[39:05] animals and so forth as we want to think
[39:07] of idolatry but that's not all idolatry
[39:09] consists of we sometimes make our
[39:11] automobiles
[39:13] and our clothes just something simple
[39:14] think of that clothes
[39:16] i can you can love you can get up for
[39:18] church now i know we saw this maybe in
[39:20] other churches right we might have been
[39:21] raised in other churches where it's all
[39:23] about how you dress when you come to
[39:24] church
[39:26] that's idolatry
[39:27] if you're more concerned about how you
[39:29] look
[39:30] then how your relationship is with god
[39:31] you have a spirit of idolatry
[39:33] church that's why i care sometimes i
[39:34] come to church and i'm like man i have
[39:36] all this i have all these stain marks do
[39:38] the people see my stain marks on my all
[39:40] my suits but i'm like i don't even care
[39:42] that's not the point why i'm coming now
[39:44] should i be more cleansy yes i should
[39:45] probably get them taken to the dry
[39:46] cleaner more often but i just forget
[39:48] about it i'm trying to do everything i
[39:49] can
[39:52] so to me that proves i don't care really
[39:53] about the so much the clothes i mean
[39:56] yeah we got to dress holy that's part of
[39:57] it but what matters is where's your love
[40:00] directed to amen your love must be
[40:02] directed to your maker amen
[40:05] hallelujah not to the close
[40:07] not
[40:08] not to anything else not to the
[40:10] automobile
[40:13] anything between you and god is an idol
[40:16] sometimes we make our churches idols
[40:19] right there's a famous church i used to
[40:21] go to before i came in the message
[40:23] and that's their slogan
[40:25] their slogan is we love our church
[40:28] that's their slogan
[40:30] that's simple that may sound simple but
[40:32] that's that's an idol
[40:34] they call and this is the this is our
[40:36] church and this is the church we love
[40:38] well i mean i'd say yeah i love our
[40:40] church too but if sin gets in here i
[40:41] won't be real happy with our church
[40:44] right you know what i mean because our
[40:45] church is not infallible there's only
[40:47] one that deserves our worship there's
[40:48] only one that deserves our adoration
[40:50] amen
[40:52] see so
[40:55] people can worship their church
[40:57] we should never ever say never
[41:00] never do that god is the only one we
[41:03] should worship
[41:04] hallelujah
[41:09] we might not oh yeah i just put this
[41:10] down at the bottom so see money be
[41:12] obviously that's the idea for many
[41:13] people jesus actually brought it down to
[41:14] that either serve god or ma'am and
[41:16] mammon means riches
[41:18] so most people in this society most
[41:20] people all throughout history either
[41:22] choose to worship god or money
[41:25] paul said remember preachers worship
[41:27] their bellies so they preach whatever
[41:28] will get them more money and more uh
[41:31] more more more people coming to church
[41:33] and more ties more offerings right they
[41:35] just want to preach that because their
[41:36] god is their belly
[41:40] spouse or immoral lover preacher can be
[41:42] an idol
[41:44] job fame anything else anything that
[41:47] takes the place of god or gets more love
[41:49] than god has now become an idol
[41:54] he says i just want to read this here
[41:57] the spirit will have to be the same kind
[41:59] of holy spirit or it'll miss that place
[42:01] going together
[42:03] amen not because you make yourself but
[42:05] because something the love of god has
[42:07] swept into your soul and tore every
[42:09] earthly idol out so i'm just reading
[42:11] this to show you the brother man says
[42:12] the holy spirit has to sweep into your
[42:14] soul like a rushing mighty woman amen
[42:17] it's just in other words god's spirit
[42:19] has to come upon you and it has to tear
[42:21] out all the idols amen
[42:23] like i've named them you know my idols
[42:24] were sports and and lustful thoughts and
[42:27] lustful movies and swearing and i mean
[42:30] you name it a good name i can name
[42:31] probably 10 or 15.
[42:33] if i just thought about it for a moment
[42:34] but when the holy spirit comes in he
[42:36] takes sometimes he takes a couple out at
[42:38] a time amen but usually it's just one at
[42:40] a time the spirit will knock this one
[42:41] away knock that away knock that away the
[42:43] holy spirit is coming in there to get
[42:45] all these things out that you love amen
[42:47] so you only love the one who deserves
[42:49] your love jesus christ amen
[42:51] hallelujah
[42:54] that's what they do on super bowl sunday
[42:56] they might sit like this watching the
[42:57] game but really they're bowing down like
[42:59] this they they love the game and that's
[43:01] what they do when those guys make good
[43:02] scores they bow down and they worship
[43:04] them now you've seen it yeah
[43:06] that's really what they're doing they're
[43:07] buying down to that idol because they're
[43:09] saying i need pleasure from this i need
[43:11] three or four hours and all these
[43:13] commercials i need all this worldliness
[43:15] because i'm hungry for it they're
[43:16] feeding on it it's an illegal union amen
[43:20] when they didn't spend five minutes
[43:21] praying who'd i share that with yeah i
[43:22] shared that with a catholic guy
[43:26] he works at giant eagle i go there
[43:27] almost every morning to get a salad you
[43:28] know or something like that
[43:30] i said uh sir
[43:33] i said uh he said oh what do you think
[43:35] the supervisor said i don't watch it
[43:38] i said i don't want to bow down and
[43:39] worship that he's like oh i need to
[43:40] think about that
[43:43] oh yeah i asked him i said i said i said
[43:45] you know most people watched four hours
[43:47] on that and they didn't read their bible
[43:48] for five minutes he's like yeah i don't
[43:49] know if i prayed five minutes this
[43:51] morning or yesterday when i watched the
[43:52] super bowl i said see there it is
[43:54] people can't see that
[43:56] you can't see that you love that more
[43:57] than you love the things of god
[43:59] oh but when we get doctors when we
[44:01] really get down the bible or really get
[44:02] down to prayer isn't there a peace that
[44:05] passes all understanding isn't there
[44:06] such a satisfaction
[44:08] in knowing that god heard your prayer
[44:10] and god loves you and you're in you're
[44:12] in
[44:12] frequent contact and connection with the
[44:15] holy spirit praise god that's something
[44:17] the world didn't give and the world
[44:19] can't take it away praise god amen but
[44:22] they want to be contact with all the
[44:23] worldly spirits
[44:25] remember church we'd have people leave
[44:26] this this church because of things like
[44:28] that tvs
[44:31] and they'd rather have that they'd
[44:32] rather have nba finals and nfl than then
[44:35] believe god sent a prophet
[44:37] see why because they love that it's a
[44:39] spirit of it's a whoredom they're
[44:40] horrors to god that's a rough word
[44:43] but that's true
[44:44] they're to god
[44:49] and they've never let the holy spirit
[44:50] sweep down their soul
[44:52] and knock all those out down praise god
[44:54] holiday that's what god wants to do
[44:56] today praise god amen
[44:58] there's anything in our lives that are
[45:00] displeasing the lord anything we're
[45:01] going to for pleasure and and enjoyment
[45:04] more than god
[45:07] god wants to
[45:09] knock those out of our lives
[45:11] like just think about church in the
[45:12] 1950s what what did they make that show
[45:14] called we love lucy love there's love
[45:18] and brother man would constantly say
[45:19] you're going instead of going to
[45:20] wednesday night prayer meeting you're
[45:22] going to watch i we love susie he said
[45:25] who we we who love susie
[45:28] see so he's catching it there in the 50s
[45:32] the show's called you're it's about your
[45:34] love
[45:35] we love it
[45:37] watching all the kind of idiotic things
[45:39] in it so idiotic
[45:41] idiotic jokes idiotic disrespect for men
[45:44] and women putting your confidence on
[45:47] prostitutes which they were
[45:49] back you imagine that they're
[45:50] prostitutes
[45:52] and staying home in bram tabernacle
[45:54] they'd stay home from church to watch we
[45:56] love susie we love i love lucy instead
[45:58] of going to church
[46:02] and you make them your idols and when
[46:03] you turn and you turn them on your
[46:05] television and let your little children
[46:06] see them
[46:08] now i just made a video about this a few
[46:09] weeks ago well maybe months ago but here
[46:11] what was she standing for this was in
[46:12] nineteen i'm sorry it's 1953.
[46:16] she was she was the most popular sitcom
[46:19] she's an adulterer i think she's married
[46:20] three or four times and she's the one
[46:22] they use to start pushing women wearing
[46:24] pants
[46:25] she was the one because we love her
[46:28] see they got the idol they made her idol
[46:31] right and then they'll they know women
[46:33] that idolize her will bow down well i'm
[46:34] going to buy me some of those pajama
[46:36] pants i don't look just like my husband
[46:38] and god said it's a abomination for a
[46:40] man to put on a woman's garment a
[46:42] woman's garment to put on a man's
[46:43] garment
[46:44] who do they use they use the woman
[46:45] that's already an idol
[46:47] who she's funny and she mocks her
[46:48] husband and married three four times
[46:50] she's a prostitute
[46:52] a
[46:54] prostitute like i told that guy on the
[46:56] debate nice guy
[46:58] he said you need to read this book i
[46:59] said i got a book for you to read you
[47:01] need to read women and pants from 2003.
[47:04] hallelujah it wasn't written by message
[47:06] believer it's written by sinners
[47:09] amen
[47:10] see they love it and so satan gives them
[47:12] what they want because they love
[47:14] darkness more than light
[47:19] now we read this quote a few weeks ago
[47:21] let me see where i'm at yeah so
[47:23] the main thing he says is stay in the
[47:25] middle of the road enough spirit in you
[47:27] to keep you warm and moving on how many
[47:29] feel warm in the holy spirit today i
[47:31] feel real warm today praise god i'm
[47:33] i'm burning up with god's love amen
[47:35] i'm warm i love god amen love worship in
[47:37] jesus amen
[47:40] and it keeps you moving
[47:43] not but you also know enough to keep
[47:45] yourself under obedience to the spirit
[47:49] so you can't just use well i feel good i
[47:52] got emotions that's good i got that too
[47:54] but i also gotta use my mind and say
[47:56] well the bible says this the bible says
[47:57] this lord help me obey the bible
[48:01] that's how you stay in the middle of the
[48:02] road church
[48:04] hallelujah
[48:05] make sure you got some emotion for god
[48:07] make sure you love god you feel warm in
[48:09] your heart oh god has been so good to me
[48:11] oh i feel alive amen
[48:13] but also now direct that thought to the
[48:15] word
[48:16] now lord here's today i have to do this
[48:18] this this and that lord is there
[48:20] anything i don't want to anything you
[48:21] want to let me know i don't want to
[48:22] disobey you i want to obey you
[48:25] and you be you'll be you you'll be
[48:27] surprised and we i'm sure you are we are
[48:29] surprised when the very thing we read in
[48:30] our bible that morning or the very thing
[48:31] we heard preach that maybe last night is
[48:34] the thing that we need for the next day
[48:36] that's happened so many times with me
[48:38] you know i get emails from all kinds of
[48:39] people like i was studying on something
[48:41] i forget what it was
[48:43] oh amy simple mcpherson i was studying
[48:44] on her because brother man talks about
[48:46] her right a woman preacher who wore
[48:48] makeup and cut her hair
[48:50] and was divorced twice
[48:52] i was just studying on that and then i
[48:53] get uh the very next day i get a message
[48:56] from india
[48:57] saying hey what do you think about that
[48:59] and the holy spirit prepared me with
[49:00] what to say it was a man it's just
[49:02] amazing i was this week you know
[49:04] see in other words you just meditate on
[49:06] the things of god and god will bring you
[49:08] what you need for that hour amen that's
[49:10] why the bible said be instant ins for
[49:12] preacher be instant in season out of
[49:14] season in other words just always give
[49:16] yourself instantly give your give your
[49:18] mind to the things of god because
[49:20] there's somebody that will need
[49:21] something somewhere and we can all be
[49:23] servants to one another in fact the
[49:24] bible says we must serve we should we
[49:26] should serve one another we should be
[49:28] servants one to another praise god
[49:36] and so my you know if you're wondering
[49:37] about amy several mcpherson let me say
[49:38] this but abraham said he went to her her
[49:40] funeral or her burial and he said he
[49:43] just bowed his head and thanked god for
[49:44] a noble life yet she's a woman preacher
[49:47] now the reason i think brother brown did
[49:48] that was because he he was invited to
[49:50] preach at her place many or her church
[49:52] she died in 1944 brother ramsar's
[49:54] ministry in 47th as far as the national
[49:56] one so i think brother brown was just a
[49:59] gentleman right he wasn't going to go
[50:00] into a woman's former church a woman
[50:02] preachers former church and blast all
[50:04] the women and condemn you know amy simon
[50:06] mcpherson to hell he just said she was a
[50:08] noble woman she did some good things
[50:10] but he never said i agree with her
[50:12] preaching
[50:14] right
[50:15] and so i think the holy spirit gave me
[50:16] the right words to say and also brother
[50:18] brown may have not known all the things
[50:19] that she did
[50:21] because he didn't have google in his
[50:22] pocket like you got
[50:24] or go like i got
[50:26] i don't like google in my pocket i like
[50:28] duck duck go in my pocket
[50:30] he couldn't just look up and say oh i
[50:31] wonder what she's doing you know
[50:35] news traveled slow in those times
[50:40] so just as the holy spirit moves
[50:43] now so see church what but brotherhood
[50:44] says you know he said we can't be too
[50:46] emotional we can't be overly emotional
[50:48] and forget about doctrine on this side
[50:50] and we can't be too word word word all
[50:53] the time and not and just get called on
[50:54] god
[50:56] so you got to have both you're going to
[50:58] be right down in the middle of the road
[50:59] you must be balanced and the church said
[51:01] amen
[51:02] jesus said he's looking for true
[51:03] worshipers who worship what here it is
[51:05] in spirit and in truth and the church
[51:07] said
[51:09] middle of the road believers amen
[51:13] hallelujah praise god
[51:16] enough warmth to keep you warm and on
[51:18] fire moving on but enough wisdom to know
[51:21] the word to obey the word of god
[51:23] and not get tricked by a doctrine of a
[51:25] devil
[51:26] hallelujah
[51:27] but the brother man said the antichrist
[51:30] will turn down the bride's doctrine
[51:34] that makes sense because uh antichrist
[51:37] is opponent of course the false church
[51:39] the antichrist church will turn down the
[51:41] doctrine because the doctrine of christ
[51:43] leads to holiness amen
[51:45] and she don't want to be holy
[51:47] she wants to look holy but the bible
[51:49] said i have a form of godliness but deny
[51:51] the power thereof
[51:54] and then also here's what i would say
[51:56] the wise version tries to stay in the
[51:57] balance the foolish virgin they kind of
[51:59] fall off on the side of the road but at
[52:00] least they're not drowning like make
[52:02] believers and unbelievers at least
[52:03] they're not drowning and lost and
[52:04] shipwrecked the bible says
[52:06] they're shipwrecked
[52:09] so i i don't even believe the foolish
[52:10] virgin are on the highway of holiness
[52:11] you know
[52:12] they've kind of fallen off because
[52:14] they're not born again they're not going
[52:15] to make it to the rapture
[52:17] praise god at the end of that road
[52:19] there's a destination church there's a
[52:20] light at the end of the road amen
[52:22] hallelujah praise god amen it's jesus
[52:25] christ and the bible says he shines in
[52:27] the light of his glory amen hallelujah
[52:31] now we
[52:33] there's numerous doctrine that are off
[52:34] the mark i'm not going to say these over
[52:36] live stream can they see this screen on
[52:37] the live stream
[52:39] all the way like it zoomed in no it's
[52:41] kind of small right so i preached on
[52:43] these a few uh sundays ago these are
[52:46] doctrines that are getting off
[52:48] you know hearing from a theophany i
[52:50] can't find that in the bible
[52:51] um some people take that interaction
[52:54] marriage and so far it becomes legalism
[52:57] and i believe it comes
[52:59] racism
[53:01] right because brother we talked about
[53:02] that
[53:05] here we'll look at this one here today
[53:07] the prosperity movement
[53:10] says god wants you to be rich and always
[53:12] healthy and that's a lie
[53:15] that's a doctrine of a devil now you you
[53:18] say well church well that's not in the
[53:19] message well i beg your pardon
[53:22] sometimes we have preachers and
[53:23] sometimes there's preachers i hear that
[53:25] they are preaching a prosperity gospel
[53:28] or god always wants to heal you
[53:31] well we're going to balance it out today
[53:33] lord willing if we can by god's grace
[53:36] seventh under some people take course
[53:38] you know coleman took it way too far
[53:39] where their the church is all in sin
[53:42] every word on the tape i don't see how
[53:44] those people cannot be drowning in
[53:45] idolatry i don't see how that's possible
[53:48] they weep and cry saying oh our pastor
[53:50] is going to preach to us tonight brother
[53:51] branham brother bam is dead
[53:53] his ministry is over
[53:55] he's passed on he's not preaching he's
[53:56] rejoicing
[53:58] praise god amen he's not preaching today
[54:00] he's rejoicing today praise god he's
[54:03] experiencing the sublime of the sublime
[54:05] amen
[54:07] and preaching ain't always sublime and
[54:09] brother jesse said amen
[54:12] you know because you get battles and you
[54:13] know discouragements but we all get it
[54:15] i'm not making anything it's not my
[54:16] battle's no harder than yours
[54:18] but you know it's just it's not sublime
[54:21] always
[54:22] what's sublime is having a new body
[54:24] no sin
[54:26] paul said to be absent from the body is
[54:28] to be present with the lord amen
[54:31] some people make christmas you know they
[54:33] go too far on that some people say no
[54:35] fasting they go too far on that with
[54:36] music right they say you can't have any
[54:38] drums they go way far off the beaten
[54:39] path
[54:41] so let me um
[54:43] let me go to that one with divine
[54:44] healing i got a few thoughts on divine
[54:45] healing here i want to get to
[54:48] so just bear with me here for a moment
[54:49] so everybody take a deep breath if you
[54:50] can
[54:52] we'll try to look at a few thoughts here
[54:54] um
[54:56] i just want to bring this out again here
[54:57] uh before we get to the divine healing
[55:00] i just want to go i went through this a
[55:01] few weeks ago church this one this is
[55:03] what i was saying a holy ghost-filled
[55:05] sealed believers still
[55:07] can have an evil spirit anointing them
[55:10] it's an offense it's just all it is is
[55:11] grieving the holy spirit it's an offense
[55:13] to god
[55:14] right but i love how god is patient
[55:18] god is patient with us
[55:21] we now here's where satan satan tries to
[55:23] whisper in your ear oh you gotta you got
[55:24] a complex oh you're definitely not the
[55:26] bride
[55:28] you definitely don't have the holy ghost
[55:30] why do you know
[55:33] you weren't there when i got to hold it
[55:34] well you might have been there when i
[55:35] got the holy ghost but i was there when
[55:36] i got the holy ghost that's why i was
[55:37] like say i was there when i got it
[55:38] praise god i know what it did in my life
[55:41] praise god
[55:42] look at the last years of foreign look
[55:45] at the last since i got the holy ghost
[55:46] in 2003. look at the last uh
[55:49] let's see
[55:50] 2003 19 years of my life
[55:53] look at that last night does my life
[55:55] speak foolish virgin or does my life
[55:56] speak wise virgin amen hallelujah i know
[55:58] what i believe amen
[56:00] i know what my life speaks
[56:02] am i flirting with the world
[56:05] or am i or am i dedicated or am i making
[56:08] preparations amen for the coming messiah
[56:10] amen what is my life doing am i lacking
[56:12] oil and i'm going to be found without
[56:14] oil i didn't make preparations or am i
[56:17] in the church of god praying every time
[56:19] preaching singing worshiping god am i
[56:22] making preparations or not the bride has
[56:24] made herself ready amen
[56:26] hallelujah
[56:29] so devil say whatever you want i know
[56:30] what my life speaks and my life speaks
[56:32] louder than my words
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:36] because you can say the same thing and
[56:37] the church said
[56:39] but just notice in 1954
[56:42] brother man said before this is before
[56:43] he preaches he said i've developed the
[56:46] critical i who developed it i did
[56:48] i did
[56:51] when you sin church most of the time you
[56:52] know that you're sinning
[56:55] brother graham said i sin a thousands of
[56:57] times a year
[56:58] that's at least five or six times a day
[57:01] do you think five or six times a day
[57:02] when we sin do you think we didn't know
[57:04] what we were doing or do you think we
[57:05] knew what we're doing
[57:07] i think most time we know what we're
[57:08] doing
[57:09] and what is this complex this is a
[57:11] complex now
[57:12] how does it feel brother ram it haunts
[57:14] me
[57:16] i told my wife yesterday the first time
[57:18] something happened now i was sitting in
[57:19] the yard i told her she had reminded me
[57:21] and i told her about it i said honey
[57:23] i've got to place till i become critical
[57:24] of people i don't want to be whose job
[57:28] is it
[57:29] it's not mine
[57:30] [Laughter]
[57:32] praise god
[57:33] and god's the one to criticize
[57:36] not me
[57:39] not church there's a balance especially
[57:41] for preachers it is my job to rebuke sin
[57:45] but brother ram recognized in his life
[57:47] he'd be and the example he gives he
[57:49] criticizes a woman preacher in india he
[57:51] criticizes the voice of healing magazine
[57:53] he said everything he saw he just
[57:54] criticized
[57:57] that's how you know he got a critical
[57:58] spirit
[58:00] criticized the preacher criticized the
[58:02] trustees criticized the song leader
[58:04] criticized the sisters criticized the
[58:05] mothers criticized everything
[58:06] everything's critical there's no like
[58:08] praise god i love you god bless you i
[58:10] sure appreciate what you're doing for
[58:11] the lord
[58:13] it's just critical critical cutting
[58:15] cutting cutting cutting mistake mistake
[58:17] mistake error
[58:20] i'm skipping he says so you help me as i
[58:22] stand here with my hand up at the pulpit
[58:24] help me to criticize nobody and help
[58:26] help me ask them to pray for him that
[58:28] god will give me a spirit in my heart
[58:30] that instead of criticizing it i will
[58:32] love them anyhow and go on
[58:34] so brother i'm saying i really can't go
[58:36] on with god because i'm just staying
[58:37] here in this spot criticizing everything
[58:39] i want to just love them i just want to
[58:40] move on past this in my life
[58:44] have you ever felt like that like you're
[58:45] not moving on with god
[58:47] because you're so overwhelmed with
[58:49] something
[58:51] many times what is a church it's an evil
[58:52] spirit
[58:55] i love this next quote
[58:57] it's just been a constant grind and a
[58:59] grind and a grind till i'm just
[59:02] human
[59:03] my mental powers are breaking like that
[59:05] you see and i've got to get away for
[59:07] some rest
[59:10] so church when did brother adam get this
[59:12] complex when he was tired
[59:14] that church doesn't happen to all of us
[59:16] brothers and sisters we work work work
[59:18] if we don't take time to rest
[59:20] satan's going to slip something before
[59:22] our eyes and we might take up the
[59:23] critical spirit
[59:25] and then that will haunt us until we
[59:27] repent of it and ask god to bring us
[59:29] back with god
[59:32] that's why it's good to build into your
[59:33] life some type of vacation
[59:36] now where you really rest i'm not
[59:37] talking about where you go vacation to
[59:39] be busy
[59:42] hallelujah
[59:44] you have to build rest into your life
[59:45] because look he gets tired he's grinding
[59:47] grinding yeah i used to run a grinder
[59:49] you know when i was in college
[59:51] i think bang you run grinders brother
[59:53] okay so van runs yeah he knows all about
[59:55] grinders
[59:57] gotta make sure it's the right one just
[59:59] grinding all the time and never letting
[1:00:00] up just so busy so over overworked
[1:00:04] over anxious oh stressed out and that's
[1:00:06] when the devil brings in a critical
[1:00:08] spirit
[1:00:09] and he said i'm coming to the pulpit and
[1:00:11] i'm haunted by this i just everything i
[1:00:13] look at i want to criticize
[1:00:15] how many believe you're still with the
[1:00:16] holy ghost
[1:00:19] and that's what i'm going to wait for
[1:00:21] to stay by myself to pray that god will
[1:00:23] take that critical feeling away from me
[1:00:25] and mellow me down
[1:00:28] i could go on and i could go and act
[1:00:30] like it but that wouldn't come from my
[1:00:31] heart and i'd be a hypocrite then sure
[1:00:33] enough see i want it to come from my
[1:00:35] heart now i love this look that i really
[1:00:37] have love for those who are not lovely
[1:00:41] now look at this
[1:00:42] that jesus did
[1:00:45] when i was critical look at this now
[1:00:47] look what he says i was critical when i
[1:00:49] needed to be criticized and still
[1:00:52] he loves me anyhow
[1:00:56] praise god amen in other words i'm the
[1:00:58] one that needs criticized and god is
[1:01:00] patient with me god still loves me amen
[1:01:03] that's divine love amen
[1:01:05] we're critical we need the criticism but
[1:01:08] god loves us anyway he's merciful with
[1:01:10] us he's patient with us hallelujah
[1:01:15] and he says you pray for me
[1:01:18] now here now let me give this thought
[1:01:20] i thought we have the power of the
[1:01:21] spoken word why didn't he just speak to
[1:01:23] the critical spirit and it goes
[1:01:25] see see how people just throw these
[1:01:27] quotes around they don't even understand
[1:01:29] like we had somebody years ago when they
[1:01:30] criticized my wife and criticized me we
[1:01:32] had some different problems they're like
[1:01:33] why don't you speak to it
[1:01:35] and they were being critical of us like
[1:01:38] every problem in life want you to speak
[1:01:39] to it because not every situation is
[1:01:42] like that you got to be anointed to
[1:01:43] speak to something
[1:01:49] like we were having some trouble one of
[1:01:50] the kids was sick why don't you just
[1:01:51] speak to that why did you speak to that
[1:01:54] now the very same person i could have
[1:01:55] now i didn't brother bang but i could
[1:01:57] have said why don't you speak to that
[1:01:58] youtube devil that you're addicted to
[1:02:01] i could have said that
[1:02:03] but you know god gave me a little more
[1:02:04] wisdom than that i should say a little
[1:02:06] more patience than that
[1:02:08] why don't you uh repent of that
[1:02:10] overeating devil that you got
[1:02:13] worship in your belly
[1:02:15] you're overweight why don't you speak to
[1:02:16] that so you can go down and eat the
[1:02:18] restaurant and not overeat why don't you
[1:02:20] don't you speak to that
[1:02:21] you see
[1:02:22] it's hypocrisy
[1:02:24] it's see it's a critical spirit and we
[1:02:26] gotta we gotta overcome that with god's
[1:02:29] divine love
[1:02:33] in other words god is going to send you
[1:02:34] the word to speak at the right time
[1:02:39] i want you to speak to it
[1:02:42] but why don't you
[1:02:43] why don't you why don't you get the beam
[1:02:44] out of your eye first
[1:02:46] right and then come talk to me about the
[1:02:47] beam in my eye
[1:02:50] because sometimes god allows trials and
[1:02:52] their tests and god doesn't tell us how
[1:02:54] long they're going to last and the
[1:02:56] church said
[1:02:57] job was months in trials why don't you
[1:02:59] speak to a job because god don't anoint
[1:03:01] me to speak to it right now amen
[1:03:05] i've asked god to do it god hasn't done
[1:03:07] it i want to speak to it but god hasn't
[1:03:09] sent me the anointing i'm mature enough
[1:03:10] to know when god wants me to speak to
[1:03:12] that mountain he'll give me the word
[1:03:14] we'll speak to that mountain and it'll
[1:03:15] move amen
[1:03:17] mature enough to know i don't keep god
[1:03:18] in my pocket and bring him out whenever
[1:03:20] i want to god's my aladdin god's my
[1:03:22] genie that's not how god works god works
[1:03:24] by his time his season his ways his ways
[1:03:28] are higher than our ways amen
[1:03:31] like i said you got a hypocrite telling
[1:03:32] you to speak to it when they won't even
[1:03:33] speak to their sins
[1:03:35] that's a beam in your eye trying to take
[1:03:36] the beam out of someone else's eye
[1:03:39] in other words they can't see clearly
[1:03:41] how they're going to help you see
[1:03:42] clearly church the only one that can
[1:03:43] help us is jesus christ
[1:03:46] i didn't mean to breathe i didn't
[1:03:47] actually plan to preach that but praise
[1:03:48] the lord anyhow
[1:03:52] now let me look at this one this god
[1:03:54] always wants to heal
[1:03:58] now i didn't really get these in the
[1:03:59] order so you can kind of tell i'm just
[1:04:00] kind of
[1:04:02] trying to find where i was at here
[1:04:05] oh yeah here's another one too
[1:04:08] yeah i just want to bring this quote out
[1:04:09] too and i got a whole list of scriptures
[1:04:10] so get your bibles go to first
[1:04:12] corinthians 12 would you
[1:04:22] see the prosperity movement you know
[1:04:23] they're all about health and wealth
[1:04:25] right that's what they're all about
[1:04:27] health and wealth and church there are
[1:04:29] documentaries on
[1:04:31] tv channels they have gone to these
[1:04:34] prosperity meetings and found all the
[1:04:35] people they pray for and hardly any of
[1:04:37] them get healed
[1:04:39] yet they're giving thousands of dollars
[1:04:40] into those ministries and these these
[1:04:42] preachers are saying give us thousand
[1:04:43] dollars god's gonna bless you sow this
[1:04:44] seed and god's gonna bless you and some
[1:04:46] of them die many of them die
[1:04:49] see because they're only after their
[1:04:51] money
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:55] but the bible says god gives us a
[1:04:58] a victory without money or price amen
[1:05:01] god gives our healing without money or
[1:05:03] price hallelujah
[1:05:06] so first corinthians 12.
[1:05:17] now look at verse 30 12 30. this is we
[1:05:19] use this all the time when we talk to
[1:05:20] pentecostal people that say you've got
[1:05:22] to speak in tongues you've got to speak
[1:05:23] in tongues well the paul said not all
[1:05:24] speak with tongues
[1:05:27] in church honestly if we're honest with
[1:05:29] ourselves i don't even know if anybody
[1:05:30] has the gift of tongues in our church
[1:05:32] at least right now because at least it's
[1:05:33] not manifest in the church and that's
[1:05:35] okay it doesn't have to manifest here
[1:05:37] there's no scripture that says all the
[1:05:39] gifts have to manifest right in the
[1:05:40] assembly of the saints
[1:05:42] there's no scripture that says it and
[1:05:44] they all have to be operated in the
[1:05:46] local assembly
[1:05:47] but they should all be within the
[1:05:49] assembly
[1:05:50] right somehow
[1:05:54] there's no scripture that says you have
[1:05:55] to operate all of them inside the
[1:05:57] assembly of the saints but the bible
[1:05:59] says when you do keep them in order
[1:06:02] remember gifts are to keep the church
[1:06:04] clean
[1:06:05] but look at first corinthians 12 30.
[1:06:06] let's read that let's all read it ready
[1:06:08] one two three have all the gifts of
[1:06:11] healing do all speak with tongues do all
[1:06:14] interpret these prosperity guys say god
[1:06:18] always wants you healthy god wants you
[1:06:19] wealthy well i am rich in christ amen
[1:06:23] i'm looking at spiritual riches here
[1:06:24] praise god i already am
[1:06:26] i've got a mansion brother amen over
[1:06:28] yonder amen
[1:06:29] hallelujah praise god and if i'm
[1:06:32] faithful i got a gold crown hallelujah
[1:06:34] that's not why i serve god but i know
[1:06:36] it's waiting over there i'm like you're
[1:06:38] saying i'm richer than all things amen
[1:06:40] there it is amen when i come in god's
[1:06:42] presence i'm the richest man in all of
[1:06:44] akron praise god well all with you we're
[1:06:46] all the same praise god
[1:06:49] but see i wouldn't we have to use a
[1:06:51] scripture not all speak with tongues and
[1:06:53] if our church doesn't have a lot of
[1:06:54] tongues well who are we to say how can
[1:06:56] we get more of it we can't ask we can't
[1:06:59] force god to give us a gift
[1:07:01] in other words we have to use what god
[1:07:02] gives us
[1:07:04] we have to the bible said gifts and
[1:07:05] callings of god are without repentance
[1:07:09] so so is the same is true will all
[1:07:11] people have all gifts of healing no
[1:07:15] no
[1:07:17] but yet they'll say now this trickles
[1:07:18] over in the message but this is a
[1:07:20] doctrine of a devil everybody needs to
[1:07:21] be rich and if you're not rich it's your
[1:07:22] fault
[1:07:24] if you're not healthy it's your fault if
[1:07:26] you're sick see that's what the devil
[1:07:28] wants you to do it's your fault like god
[1:07:29] doesn't love you or you're not good
[1:07:31] enough
[1:07:32] that's a doctrine of a devil
[1:07:36] you know the scripture they uses god
[1:07:38] would that we all prosper in health even
[1:07:39] as our soul prospers
[1:07:42] yes god wants us to prosper in health
[1:07:44] but there's also times when god doesn't
[1:07:46] heal us
[1:07:48] how about this quote this is at the end
[1:07:50] of his ministry september 11th 65.
[1:07:53] i just come back from the east i kind of

[1:09:32] they're breaking god's word well which
[1:09:33] one is it it's not they're being
[1:09:34] disrespectful it's that god has a time
[1:09:36] and season for everything in other words
[1:09:38] god will anoint you when it's your time
[1:09:39] to be healed
[1:09:44] how come people are people aren't why

[1:09:58] prophet said no i'm saying what the
[1:09:59] prophet said
[1:10:01] i'm taking it back to the word
[1:10:06] he said i don't know about that brother

[1:10:21] why don't you just speak to it brother
[1:10:22] you got the power of the third pole

[1:10:27] there the devil comes to you to say he
[1:10:29] came to jesus and said jump off the
[1:10:31] cliff
[1:10:32] come on the bible says speak to the
[1:10:33] mountain amen there it is amen praise
[1:10:36] god the same devil

[1:10:43] from me it ain't from my thoughts it's
[1:10:45] from god's thoughts amen hallelujah
[1:10:50] and that gentleman i met this week i was
[1:10:51] telling you about we're praying for his
[1:10:52] wife he actually was in those prosperity
[1:10:56] movement for 20 some years
[1:10:58] and he said those men were so full of
[1:11:00] demons
[1:11:01] he said that man would take his jacket
[1:11:03] like this and i'm not well i'm going to
[1:11:04] go in and call his name benny hen he'd
[1:11:06] go like that
[1:11:08] and he said those demon powers
[1:11:10] would go all the way to the back of the
[1:11:11] room he said he saw a man who had a big
[1:11:12] pot belly he said the demon threw his
[1:11:15] belly in like this
[1:11:17] and pushed it out and then slammed him
[1:11:19] to the ground
[1:11:21] that's how much demon power was at some
[1:11:22] of those meetings and that guy's caught
[1:11:24] on tape given on video giving people
[1:11:26] cocaine
[1:11:28] and the they uh they got millions of
[1:11:31] dollars he's a prosperity health and
[1:11:32] wealth preacher and they have the
[1:11:34] receipts when he travels over for his
[1:11:36] big meetings for these poor people
[1:11:37] supposedly to heal them he'll stay at a
[1:11:39] hotel for ten thousand dollars for one
[1:11:40] night at a hotel one night
[1:11:43] and they're living they're living their
[1:11:44] best life now well yeah they are because
[1:11:46] if they don't repent they're going to
[1:11:47] hell
[1:11:48] that's right
[1:11:53] my goodness and this is what this is see
[1:11:55] it's a doctrine of a devil
[1:11:58] oh you're not well enough well you need
[1:11:59] to sow some seed into my ministry
[1:12:02] then you'll get better they've got to
[1:12:03] honor your faith
[1:12:06] that's not faith that's fear
[1:12:09] give me money or you're going to get
[1:12:10] healed that's paying for that's that's
[1:12:11] the filthy looker amen
[1:12:14] filthy lucre and church that goes over
[1:12:16] in the message
[1:12:17] if you're not sick speak to it brother
[1:12:20] speak to it now it might be god
[1:12:21] sometimes church it might be like when
[1:12:22] you're when you're dead right brother
[1:12:24] bang
[1:12:25] and sisterhood when your dad was sick
[1:12:27] now why did we speak to it here's why we
[1:12:28] spoke to it
[1:12:30] because that morning the holy spirit
[1:12:31] woke me up at four o'clock i never wake
[1:12:32] up at four o'clock and i had three
[1:12:34] scriptures on my mind the only one i can
[1:12:35] remember now is there's life and death
[1:12:37] in the power of the tongue and i
[1:12:38] couldn't sleep i'm like rolling around
[1:12:40] my bed like why can't i go to sleep i
[1:12:41] gotta work today uh
[1:12:43] so i finally get up i'll just go study
[1:12:45] and pray okay
[1:12:46] pretty soon nine o'clock i get a call
[1:12:48] from brother amen he said really serious
[1:12:50] uh sister who is dad
[1:12:52] uh had a stroke last night
[1:12:54] he said can you pray i'm just cutting it
[1:12:56] short right
[1:12:57] i go out there i just take my phone out
[1:12:58] i don't want to pray run around the kids
[1:12:59] i just take my phone out i just got to i
[1:13:01] look at the sunrise
[1:13:02] i just say brother well let's just pray
[1:13:03] together and that's and i said brother
[1:13:05] then the holy spirit amen the holy
[1:13:07] spirit brought it to me at that moment
[1:13:08] amen the anointing of christ fell down
[1:13:11] and it reminded me this morning i woke
[1:13:13] you up i didn't say that but this
[1:13:14] morning you woke up there's power of
[1:13:16] life in the tongue and that's why we got
[1:13:18] that memorial amen that was yeah there
[1:13:20] it was right there that's when i got the
[1:13:21] prayer cloth
[1:13:23] so in other words the anointing king
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:26] and then i told amen he was my witness i
[1:13:29] said i speak to the mountain of that
[1:13:30] heart a heart attack or whatever and i
[1:13:32] commanded to move in the name of jesus
[1:13:34] christ and it moved for two weeks but i
[1:13:36] said he's going to come out of there
[1:13:37] well praise god did he come out of there
[1:13:39] well yes he did he did in the name of
[1:13:41] jesus christ when the anointing came
[1:13:43] when it was god's time to heal and look
[1:13:45] he raised all of our faith through that
[1:13:47] so we know god does all things by his
[1:13:49] time in his season we must be humble
[1:13:51] servants and be led by the holy spirit
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] that was jesus christ doing that
[1:14:02] in other words when the hour of need
[1:14:03] comes i'll raise up a standard against
[1:14:05] it amen
[1:14:08] why don't you just speak to it brother
[1:14:09] brown because it ain't the time it ain't
[1:14:10] the hour
[1:14:12] and brother man has another quote they
[1:14:13] said are you going to speak our bodies
[1:14:14] in the rapture he said i don't know he
[1:14:15] said i don't know about that
[1:14:17] he said but remember i didn't ask to
[1:14:18] speak those squirrels to existence god
[1:14:20] told me to speak it
[1:14:23] right
[1:14:24] brother amen did not ask me to speak to
[1:14:26] that heart condition
[1:14:29] the holy spirit woke me up i didn't even
[1:14:31] know it
[1:14:32] and said speak life i didn't know what i
[1:14:34] was gonna i had no idea that was gonna
[1:14:35] happen nobody knew
[1:14:37] then god used your faith brother to go
[1:14:38] there and speak that jonah word there
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:42] lying vanities amen
[1:14:45] see the word comes in this time and
[1:14:47] season don't let the devil criticize you
[1:14:49] you criticize the devil amen say you
[1:14:52] lying devil get behind me blue devil get
[1:14:54] behind me in the name of jesus christ
[1:14:56] get behind me i'm a child of god i'm
[1:14:57] moving on god always keeps his word god
[1:14:59] is faithful i love god i'm a child of
[1:15:01] the king i won't worship you i worship
[1:15:03] christ amen
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:11] see but the devil these men creeping
[1:15:13] unawares brother you know johnny they're
[1:15:14] creeping under the rule they creep in
[1:15:16] and bring these
[1:15:18] doctrines of devils
[1:15:20] to bring condemnation upon god's people
[1:15:23] but god's people will cast them down
[1:15:26] in jesus name
[1:15:28] how about paul how about timothy's
[1:15:30] stomach trouble
[1:15:32] timothy you got stomach trouble all the
[1:15:34] time just speak to it timothy is that
[1:15:36] what he said
[1:15:37] no he said go drink wine
[1:15:40] and the church said amen would you speak
[1:15:43] to the mountain brother
[1:15:44] speak to it
[1:15:45] whatever you ask god will give it to you
[1:15:47] don't we don't we have a scripture for
[1:15:49] that yes we do but there's wisdom on
[1:15:51] using those scriptures
[1:15:53] well i'm going to talk again about the
[1:15:54] tape church movement so just bear with
[1:15:55] me the tate church movie just listened
[1:15:57] to the fourth seal last week and the and
[1:15:59] the
[1:15:59] and the pastor says wrote on his blog he
[1:16:01] writes it right on the block it says you
[1:16:03] and i have power to speak to the worlds
[1:16:06] and move them we have that's what the
[1:16:07] four seal is about the two prophets
[1:16:09] you know uh at the end of the uh
[1:16:12] that's the sixth seal right but he talks
[1:16:13] about how the
[1:16:15] he talks about how uh
[1:16:17] the death rider rides into the the rider
[1:16:19] the spiritual death the fourth rider my
[1:16:22] goodness forgive me the pale horse rider
[1:16:24] rides on to the tribulation
[1:16:26] right and then brother man says those
[1:16:27] two prophets are there in the
[1:16:28] tribulation the man talks about how they
[1:16:30] they close the heavens well that the the
[1:16:32] pastor from uh jeffersonville says that
[1:16:34] we have power to close the heavens
[1:16:36] and whatever we say god will do it now
[1:16:39] there is some truth to that
[1:16:41] but we can't say it until god says it
[1:16:45] see they just make it sound like you can
[1:16:47] just do whatever you want no you can't
[1:16:48] do what you want you're a prisoner to
[1:16:50] christ what about those clothes amen
[1:16:52] you're a prisoner of jesus christ i'll
[1:16:54] only say what he tells me praise god
[1:16:59] there's such a lack of understanding
[1:17:03] why didn't paul just say speak to the
[1:17:04] stomach problem
[1:17:06] because it wasn't god's will for that
[1:17:07] time
[1:17:11] remember in john i believe it's john
[1:17:12] chapter 5 with that
[1:17:14] the blind man there when jesus the bible
[1:17:16] said he walked in and there was a there
[1:17:17] was a multitude of impotent people there
[1:17:19] and jesus healed one of them
[1:17:24] one of them
[1:17:28] that's why brother and son i thought
[1:17:29] jesus was a god of compassion he is
[1:17:33] in other words with a multitude of sick
[1:17:34] people he had a plan to either heal them
[1:17:36] or maybe some of them were under curses
[1:17:38] in other words god knew all their
[1:17:40] situations and that moment god was only
[1:17:41] going to heal one of them
[1:17:43] maybe church they were under unbelief
[1:17:45] right because the bible said because of
[1:17:46] many mighty works i'm sorry because of
[1:17:48] unbelief jesus could not do many mighty
[1:17:50] works
[1:17:56] now if you would go to second uh
[1:17:58] corinthians 12 i'm gonna pull i'm gonna
[1:17:59] try to find this quote real quick
[1:18:19] there's a good quote i found yesterday
[1:18:20] on paul
[1:18:27] help me lord
[1:18:31] maybe i didn't get it i might not have
[1:18:32] got it on there okay
[1:18:37] okay just a minute so second corinthians
[1:18:39] 12 let's look at paul again for a moment
[1:18:41] it's not always god's will to heal
[1:18:43] not always
[1:18:46] and you're not under condemnation if god
[1:18:48] doesn't heal you
[1:18:50] right we're familiar with this
[1:18:53] verse five corinthians 12 5.
[1:18:56] let me see if i can pull up that quote
[1:18:58] real quick
[1:19:01] that works as faith expressed
[1:19:06] not that one either
[1:19:15] thank you for your patience church here
[1:19:17] i'm looking for the shalom quote 1964.
[1:19:23] yeah that's it
[1:19:24] all right
[1:19:28] i'm not sure how to make that one larger
[1:19:29] so that's is that okay is that that's
[1:19:31] okay all right
[1:19:33] you know normally under most
[1:19:34] circumstances i try to make it really
[1:19:35] large for your eyes okay secretary 12
[1:19:37] verse 5 of such and one will i glory of
[1:19:40] myself i will not glory not in my
[1:19:42] infirmities for though i would desire to
[1:19:44] glory i shall not be a fool for i will
[1:19:45] say the truth for but now i forbear lest
[1:19:48] any man should think of me above that
[1:19:50] which he seeth me or to be or that he
[1:19:52] heareth of me
[1:19:54] and look paul's aware he's written he's
[1:19:56] written bible
[1:19:58] and he's like god is making it so people
[1:20:00] don't think more of me than they should
[1:20:05] right now if god did that in paul's day
[1:20:08] wouldn't he do that for all days
[1:20:10] god has to humble these prophets so
[1:20:12] people don't worship them
[1:20:14] he did that and every day look at john
[1:20:15] the baptist
[1:20:16] god had to humble him
[1:20:19] god humbles every everybody god almost
[1:20:21] everybody right
[1:20:23] verse 7 and lest i should be exalted
[1:20:25] above measure through the abundance of
[1:20:27] revelations there was given to me a
[1:20:28] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[1:20:30] satan to buff at me lest i should be
[1:20:31] exalted above measure for this thing i
[1:20:34] besought the lord three times
[1:20:36] lord is this your will is this your will
[1:20:38] or heal me heal me heal me each time
[1:20:41] the lord said no let's finish verse
[1:20:43] eight that it might depart from me and
[1:20:44] he said to me my grace is sufficient for
[1:20:46] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[1:20:47] weakness most gladly therefore will i
[1:20:50] rather glory my infirmities that the
[1:20:52] power of jesus christ may rest upon me
[1:20:55] therefore i take pleasure and
[1:20:56] infirmities in reproaches and
[1:20:58] necessities and persecutions and
[1:20:59] disruptions for christ's sake
[1:21:03] for when i am weak then i'm strong
[1:21:05] let me see if i can magnify that okay
[1:21:09] that's a little better
[1:21:15] oh it's already at 200 okay
[1:21:19] well let's try 300 so the saints can see
[1:21:20] it okay
[1:21:21] all right
[1:21:23] yeah good good good thought here i was
[1:21:24] listening this found this yesterday
[1:21:25] listened to it this morning like paul
[1:21:27] said hallelujah he had an infirmity
[1:21:28] something was bothering him the devil
[1:21:29] would buff it and blow off their blow
[1:21:31] and he consulted the lord three times
[1:21:32] taken away from him and said i don't
[1:21:34] want this lord take it away from me and
[1:21:35] then one night the lord spoke to him and
[1:21:37] said saul paul my grace is efficient
[1:21:40] he said then i'll glory my infirmity in
[1:21:42] glory i'll glory in it i know you're the
[1:21:44] healer i've seen you heal the sick now
[1:21:46] search how many of us have he's seen god
[1:21:47] heal the sick
[1:21:48] or do miracles and that yet god will let
[1:21:50] you sit sick
[1:21:53] god will let you sit without money or
[1:21:54] without without what you need
[1:21:56] you've seen god do so much and all of a
[1:21:58] sudden where's god
[1:22:02] i've seen you paul
[1:22:03] paul saw a man raised from the dead
[1:22:05] remember eunicus
[1:22:07] i cast out devils open the eyes of the
[1:22:08] blind but i've consulted you and you
[1:22:10] tell me it's your grace is sufficient
[1:22:13] then this devil that bothers me is
[1:22:14] growing pains of your grace
[1:22:18] then i'll glory in my infirmities why if
[1:22:20] less i get exalted above the abundance
[1:22:23] of the revelation see is it always god's
[1:22:25] will to heal no it's not
[1:22:28] right
[1:22:29] i'm talking about instant healing
[1:22:30] is it always instant healing god's will
[1:22:32] no
[1:22:33] now did paul probably get better
[1:22:34] eventually yeah he probably got better
[1:22:36] but in this case it was not god's will
[1:22:38] to heal him
[1:22:42] now look at this paul had something the
[1:22:45] other disciples didn't have i love this
[1:22:47] he saw him after his death burial
[1:22:50] resurrection and ascension
[1:22:53] he saw him some of them say well i walk
[1:22:56] with him well so did everybody on the
[1:22:57] street now look at that
[1:23:00] right the disciples said well i walk
[1:23:01] with him well so could hundreds of
[1:23:03] thousands of people said he walked with
[1:23:04] him or maybe not hundreds of maybe
[1:23:06] thousands
[1:23:08] but after he was dead buried rose and
[1:23:10] ascended up and returned back in the
[1:23:11] form of the pillar fire he talked to
[1:23:13] paul that was more than any of the rest
[1:23:15] of them had amen
[1:23:18] he said except i get exalted and want to
[1:23:20] build now look at this this is really
[1:23:21] something
[1:23:23] he said except i get exalted and i want
[1:23:25] to build a great big seminary and
[1:23:27] everything else
[1:23:29] and great big something other lest i get
[1:23:31] exalted above the abundance of the
[1:23:32] revelation god let a messenger of the
[1:23:34] devil keep me beat down now church could
[1:23:36] we be humble enough to say maybe
[1:23:38] something's happened in our lives they
[1:23:40] seem to be discouraging but maybe it's
[1:23:42] god keeping us from being prideful
[1:23:45] now we don't know that paul wanted to
[1:23:47] build a denomination but look how
[1:23:48] brother brand brings us to our day
[1:23:50] god might let a man be sick so he
[1:23:53] doesn't accomplish
[1:23:54] something prideful
[1:23:59] just speak to it brother
[1:24:01] i did i spoke to jesus
[1:24:03] right
[1:24:03] just speak to it paul
[1:24:06] i did i talked to him
[1:24:08] i didn't speak to it but i talked to the
[1:24:09] lord
[1:24:12] and the lord told me it's for you to be
[1:24:14] humble
[1:24:18] see
[1:24:20] growing pains of god's grace he says
[1:24:22] he said we could stay
[1:24:24] he said then when i'm weak i'm strong
[1:24:25] growing pains of grace amen we can stay
[1:24:27] on that long time an hour 45 minutes has
[1:24:28] passed and we're suffering
[1:24:30] his grace pains i think that's where he
[1:24:32] stops it right there
[1:24:34] yeah he permits you on crossroads
[1:24:37] all right
[1:24:39] now does that help a little bit by god's
[1:24:41] grace
[1:24:42] see a doctrine of the devil would bring
[1:24:44] it in and say god always wants you rich
[1:24:46] god always wants you were just more
[1:24:47] spiritual you'd have more money that's
[1:24:49] not true
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:53] you think of all the examples of poor
[1:24:54] people they were very spiritual lazarus
[1:24:56] the man that died and the rich man was
[1:24:57] sent to hell he would he was very
[1:24:59] spiritual but yet he was poor
[1:25:01] very poor
[1:25:03] see and that creeps in the message well
[1:25:06] you must be doing something wrong if
[1:25:07] you're sick
[1:25:09] no it could be god keeping you from
[1:25:11] doing something wrong
[1:25:12] and for that church should we complain
[1:25:14] about it or should we rejoice in it
[1:25:16] we should rejoice when god when god says
[1:25:19] no we should rejoice in that and saying
[1:25:21] it's accomplishing a purpose in my life
[1:25:24] praise god you can stop the livestream i
[1:25:26] want to just say one more thing here by
[1:25:27] god's grace
