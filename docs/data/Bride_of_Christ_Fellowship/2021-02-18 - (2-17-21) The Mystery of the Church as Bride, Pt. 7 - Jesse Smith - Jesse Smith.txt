ephesians 5 32 and then we'll read our memory verse here ephesians 5 32. look at the mystery of the church as the bride part seven tonight we're coming down to the end of this chapter i believe lord willing after tonight we'll look at the shulamite maybe next wednesday by god's grace if the lord is willing that's what nature was referring to on sunday night wonderful job nature we remember that this week oh and then we read a scripture last night the very scripture that you mentioned about god's love we read that in our devotional last night so we thought of you last night praise god and then we'll look at lesson learned through other brides and wives and women in the bible there's many great lessons and then i want to just rehearse the proverbs 31 woman it's a beautiful beautiful type and that's the end of the chapter then by god's grace just going through all these types as the church here types the bride of jesus christ what a revelation right so many people miss it but we're so grateful it's been delivered to us praise god ephesians 5 32 let's read that on three ready one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church praise god go to james 5 7-8 that's our memory verse here for this week this month rather james five seven and eight james five seven and eight everybody got that can you say amen if you got that all right let's read that james 5 7 8 on 3 1 2 3 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh amen may god has blessings to read his word you may be seated praise god i do have a few quotes just to share tonight casey not too many but i got a few if you'd like to switch over here so lord willing tonight we'll look at this thought and i'll try to be careful the time about 30 minutes maybe we'll preach i'm pulling up this old slideshow used to have and i just because i just want to put some quotes in here uh you're probably familiar with that one it's been a few years since i preached that uh probably four years ago five years ago so i got some random quotes for tonight i'd like to share to kind of deal with this thought last wednesday we looked at some types we looked at sarah as the type of the bride of jesus christ and we saw the former latter reign then we saw rebecca as a type of the gentile bride and aznath and then we ended with rahab the gentile harlot last wednesday night as another type of the bride amen all these great beautiful types now tonight lord willing we'll spend a little more of our time on samson's uh philistine wife from timnath now according as far as i know in the scripture brother brahm never uses this type but i think kim preached it a few years ago and i can clearly see a type i just as he preached i can clearly see a type for the gentile bride so before i get to this i just want to read a few quotes where you know there's there's no doubt a large camp of branamites and i say that i say that in love but i feel like they worship brother branham where they if brother brahm doesn't say a word about it then they won't believe it they won't preach it and i think uh you find many books of the bible where brother brahm doesn't even mention them so you know you can't throw out parts of the bible and say well i don't believe that because brother branham you know i'm not going to read that because brother brahm didn't mention that i think that's a false idea i believe if brother branham came by the holy spirit and he gave us thus saith the lord on so many different subjects i think right now i got over 30 thus saith the lords from brother branham in the book now if we get 30 thus saith the lords we should be able to rightly divide many of these books and place them positionally especially because we have a lot of uh understanding about the seven church ages right and the blinding of the jews and the hundred forty four thousand the tribulation the rapture we have so much truth everything is rightly divided into all these great categories we should be able by the holy spirit to look at a scripture maybe brother brahm never mentioned it but with the help of the holy spirit we should be able to place it in its proper place and that's what i believe uh i believe if we're not constantly searching for that we're going to denominate and become a dead church that's what i believe if we don't constantly search for growing in grace and knowledge of the lord jesus christ i feel like we'll become a denomination and we don't want to become that uh we've got to be hungry and thirsty for more righteousness and uh i'll show you a quote brother brahm says that so you can understand that i don't ever want my children to think well this is it that's all god can do and that's all god can reveal in these 1156 sermons from brother braham that's all god can reveal i don't believe that i believe god can give us more revelation or more information about the same revelations praise god that's what i believe because that's what brother ram taught now here's just a just a simple quote where brother bram says he doesn't have all the answers right so they ask him in the questions and answers according to the fifth seal moses and elijah have to die what about enoch he said i don't know if i don't know i'm just going to tell you i don't know i don't know all the answers folks i don't know he says and if i don't know i'm going to tell you i don't know if i do know i won't tell you until i do know but i don't know i've often wondered that myself here's another one he says he says a man that tells you he has all the answers he said is a gimmick now i have a video i can show you the video from the 90s where brother rams family members some of his family members say every answer you have is on the tapes and that's such a lie that's such a lie not every answer is on the tapes if it was then you can just get rid of the bible right you don't need that so it's such a lie uh but jesus said there was many lepers in the days of elijah but only one was sent to him one many widows in the days of elisha but only one was sent he was only one sent two many things jesus did not do many times those gimmicks that's got every answer be careful when somebody stands up and speaks to the lord that must be true it must be exactly the truth how many believe that that's true if someone speaks in the name of the lord like uh joseph branham did then that has to be true or they're a liar right just like brother branham every time he said in the name of the lord it's got to be right if not he's a false prophet we know that but that's why we believe he was a true prophet was because every time he spake in the name of lord it was right but the point i'm trying to make is that if a person says they've got every answer they don't right even even the body of jesus didn't have all the answers right when's the day an hour only the father knows the angels don't know the son don't know only the father knows some answers right so even the flesh even the humanity of jesus christ did not have all the answers so any person that says all the answers on the tape is a liar they're lying not every answer is on the tape and what they're doing church is they're misinterpreting a quote i don't have the quote right here i should go find it but brother man makes a statement he says if you have a question about that subject the answer's on the tape so he's talking about one question they have he knows that one answer's on that tape so that's what he's talking about he's not saying every question you ever had in life is on the tapes because it's not it's not but that's just how these worshipers of branamites or branham's uh brother brown that's that's just how they operate they twist quotes all the time and that's how they get uh followers after themselves people that have itching ears that want to hear things that are not true so they keep to themselves teachers having itching ears here's a good quote i like to read brother i'm talking about a good friend of mine he calls him a lovely brother now look how brother ram treats people that disagree with him we've been called demases we've been called make believers because we don't believe in press and play and limiting the fifo ministry we believe in expanding the fivefold ministry amen just like the bible says amen we believe in that but because we don't we're grouped with all these churches that are called demas and make believers right but look how brother branham treated people that differed with him he said a lovely brother good man i don't don't dare say one word against the brother as a christian i wouldn't say nothing against him he don't agree with me on that subject he's my precious brother we eat together oh just a dandy fella i take his magazine read his articles he writes them a mind and so forth and i've took a many a text out of what i read from his articles hear him say he's a great man but he just can't agree with me i appreciate that of the sincerity though he just don't one of these pushover just have to agree with everything you say he's got his own conviction and he stands for it i appreciate that so my point is how many pushovers do we have around the message that they might see something where brother man was just you know teaching and he grew later revelation but because they're a pushover because they don't have any backbone they won't even though they'll believe both of them like i've i've interacted with many pushovers lately they believe the third person the trinity dwells in them and they believe that trinity's wrong they told me both now that's just a pushover friend that's just that's just the coward right the brother ram has quotes where he says the third person dwells in our hearts and so they believe the third person of the trinity dwells in their hearts but then they also believe that trinitarianism is of the devil now how can you believe both you shouldn't believe both right you should believe the third person of the trinity is a false idea you should be able to rightly divide the word where brother adam said this well he grew in revelation he was wrong and he understands it right later but see those are pushovers right and they got the wrong spirit because they can't rightly divide the word of god he said i appreciate that good man oh i'm not a teacher a scholar he said but this man is both teacher and scholar he says i can't agree with him because i don't see it but it doesn't pertain to salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the lord he sees that church has to go through the tribulation for purification i say the blood of jesus christ purify the church amen so all he said is he said i think the church has to go through the tribulation and brother adam doesn't name call him he calls him a lovely brother a good man now that to me that's the spirit of christ right there amen someone that he don't name call him demons you don't name call him judas iscariot right you don't name call him a mate believer he just says we differ on this thing right here he's a lovely brother may god help us to have the same holy spirit praise god the same kindness and sweetness of the holy spirit may god help us to have that i don't want to be a pushover where i worship william branham i don't worship william branham i worship jesus christ amen so so i'm not going to be a pushover and let the devil push me over into idolatry amen praise god i'm going to stand on my convictions in other words i'm going to stand on what the holy ghost reveals to me praise god now last one i think i got a couple more oh yeah a couple more now you remember this don't don't ever forget this from the church age book we know paul's first revelation was right god can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation then add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had come through abraham and then later said it would come by the same bloodlines and david but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive it and understand it but god's word can't change amen okay so we just we i really like this quote because we can see it god won't give us second revelation he gives more information about the same revelation the first revelation and that's what god is doing today that's what god has been doing uh since brother ram left the scene giving us more revelation more information about the same revelation now here's one i was telling you i think this might that's the last one yeah that's the last one here's the one where church uh so many message people have missed this if we just limit our understanding to things on the tape where the holy spirit can't give more than what's on the tape will become a denomination because we'll stop seeking god for truth right we'll stop praying for understanding and so so to me this is a this is an issue of if people don't seek for more understanding they stop searching more truth right in other words they they cut off the holy spirit they cut off the spirit of truth and they say this is all that i can receive any more than that even though a revelation might line up with the word of god uh when they say no i can't receive it except brother adam said the exact words right there they can become a denomination and they can cut off the effects the further cleansing effects of the holy spirit hope i can just say it right let me just say like this they limit the holy one of israel can i say it like that amen praise god they become their own message denomination but america said that way when i speak against some domination or the denominational system it isn't the people in there it's the system that i'm against you see that holds them apart holds us from receiving see they drop their declaration say we believe this period if they would end it with a comma we believe this plus as much as the lord can show us out of his word it would be all right but if they do not but they do not do it that way you know that now let's just stop right there is that what a lot of message churches say we believe this plus anything god would add to it no they don't say that they just say we believe the message of brother graham's sermons and that's it they don't believe god can give them further revelation of this right here but that has to be our attitude and church if you have that attitude it'll keep you hungering for more of god but if you just limit god to just those 1156 sermons and the church age book and the seal book if you just limit it to that then you're likely just to denominate and not really hunger and thirst for more of the word anymore he says it would be all right if we say we believe this we believe the church age book the seven seal book all the books we believe all that plus as much as the lord can show us out of the word but they do not do it that way you know that so it even happened in brother braham say this is oh it's 63. he says uh it couldn't be a denomination and do that see it would just it would just be the move of god this is what i like moving on all the time you see amen you see that brother says we will be a continual living organism as long as we're seeking god for more revelation but if we don't see god for more revelation will die and denominate we'll put a period behind it praise god amen like in the years past god has revealed more scriptures to me about marriage and divorce that brother ram never preached and that has added more more information about the same revelation and to me that has brought me more understanding on marriage and divorce not a different revelation just the same revelation praise god amen hallelujah more on the godhead i'm trying to think of some examples on the godhead god's given us more revelation on the godhead god's given us more revelation on predestination that's for sure that's for sure because most people go on the side of well god chose you before the foundation world so it doesn't matter what you choose it certainly matters what you choose because you're supposed to make your calling and your election sure amen see it makes people lazy when they take this one quote uh from brother branham and they they fail to move on into other quotes and more scriptures that that brother bran may not have preached but people denominate and they they die and they no longer hunger for more souls to be filled with the holy ghost you know that's what's going to give us life when more people come in and get saved and get born again praise god that's going to give us a revival it's going to make us more excited to come to church praise god when we see somebody new come in and somebody or one of our children receive the holy ghost they're going to be stirred up they're going to love god they're going to love coming to church there's going to be fresh life in the camp amen hallelujah praise god i just can't wait till the next one amen because it gives us a fresh it gives them fresh power they come to church more excited right somebody's on fire somebody's saying amen a little louder praise god someone's just praying louder someone's praying more someone's singing louder seeing because there's fresh life that's brought that's been brought into the body and the body's got more life more power amen hallelujah praise god see this is what i'm striving for this is why i've got to get i've got to work myself into it as far as getting the holy spirit so that i don't die that i don't let myself become a denominational minded message believer right we've all got to do that brother says you can't live off your testimony from 20 years ago that's what's starting to happen to me you know my last trip to guyana was 2013. i'm just two two years away from that being 10 years ago and some of the biggest miracles i've seen at least through my prayers are going to be 10 years old if i'm not careful i can't if i'm not if i got to be careful not to live off those old testimonies in other words i got to be seeking god for more miracles amen for more testimonies for more moving of the holy spirit see i can't live off of those they're getting kind of old right i got romantic you got to have a fresh experience with god and brother man says uh he said you kind of got to picture yourself like the mana you know like how the mana fell every day you gotta have a fresh bite you gotta have a fresh meal as jesus said give us this day our daily bread amen we need a fresh revelation a fresh understanding every day so how many how many believe that we got to say i believe this plus as much as the lord can show me out of his word in fact that's how i end my book and just so you know i finished this week i finished yesterday no yeah i finished yesterday no i finished this morning i finished this morning and so i'm reaching out to the publisher tomorrow hopefully i can get a word back and get that published i finished after all these two years and two months my 26 months so it's been been brutal on me but it's teaching me patience so i'm excited by god's grace so i hope you enjoyed that i'll unplug there now you can pull up some scriptures lydia when we need them now let's go to uh judges 14 please let's go to judges 14. all right judges 14. now as i told you i'm going to preach this you'll you won't find this in brother man's message but it perfectly to me lines up with the message and we can't preach it it was it was just uh one of those simulations of revelation it just gave me such joy praise god like last time cam was here with the wise and foolish virgins and every time brother simon preaches he always brings a fresh revelation gives me such joy of the lord i hope that's how you feel now samson's philistine wife from timnath types jesus gentile bride now don't let this stumble you because remember brother branham said ruth typed the bride and she was a moabite right rahab uh she was a harlot a gentile harlot i'm not even sure her background actually does anybody know what was her does anyone know or what country she was out of i don't remember so anyways azimuth egyptian right they were filthy they were idolaters but god uses azenath as a type of us amen so what i'm trying to say is no matter which gentile group jesus proves to use as a type of us we want to be thankful that the type shows were brought into marriage with christ amen that's the beautiful type let's go to judges 14 verse 1. let's read one to four how about we get some readers out there malcolm eat your bible that'll save my voice a little bit judges 14. now guy can you read verses one to four i'm just getting there myself so whenever you're ready buddy fourteen one to four is hey man well i love verse four that's beautiful now look samson's parents were shocked why does he take a a jewish wife what's wrong with the jewish wife well we find out in verse four god is trying to bring judgment upon the philistines right so he's got to take a gentile wife in order to do this got to have samson rather take a gentile wife so it's god's plan god is doing great things how many believe god's got great plans out there and sometimes we don't understand them right why would this happen why would this person do that how what in the world what were they thinking many times church that's god behind it amen praise the lord because god wanted samson to help destroy the philistines and deliver israel and so we can see the spiritual type god's purpose to take a gentile bride was in mercy to the bride not judgment but god must pour out his wrath upon the gentiles during the tribulation because they've rejected his spirit right he's got to pour out wrath so he's got to work this out he's got to take a gentile bride and they've got to mistreat the bride and that's something wow right there they're going to mistreat the bride right and because of that brother brother said uh brother brahm said when the holy spirit said pick up your pen and write he said once they tell the bride she can't preach anymore that's when jesus comes to pour out his wrath on him amen once once they they gather around the woman and say you can't preach anymore you can't talk about jesus you can't talk about your husband anymore jesus says fine i'm going to snatch your way and i'm going to pour out my wrath upon you amen same thing here you'll hear in the scriptures so see the because they've uh they've mistreated the bride because they mistreated them god has to pour out judgment now verse 3 said samson chose his wife because she pleased him how many know the bride pleases jesus aren't you glad that your worship touches the heart of god aren't you glad he delights in your prayers amen praise god he honors church he honors your obedience he loves your obedience we looked at that a few weeks ago on that snowy morning right a snowy morning how god delights your sacrifices are a sweet smelling savor in god's nostrils see she walks in the spirit and not the flesh that's pleasing in the eyes of the lord your dedicated walk proves you have the spirit of christ and that you belong to him paul says believers i'm sorry paul taught believers how to please god through his commandments and sacrificing for others yeah let's read that let's go to first thessalonians four one and two lydia you got your bible so malachi you go my malcolm go to hebrews 13 15. lydia first thessalonians 4 1 and 2. i'll say it again malachi hebrews 13 verses 15 and 16 and lydia first thessalonians 4 verses 1 and 2. so lydia i would like you to read first first thessalonians 4 1-2 so here's paul teaching us how to please god through commandments and then also sacrificing for others go ahead lydia when you're ready first thessalonians amen how many can save me into that how many want to please god if you want to please god keep the commandments praise the lord this this timnath wife please samson well how do you please christ well keep the word amen when the temptation comes turn it down praise god speak the word and go forward hallelujah please the lord you know that pleases god when you crucify the flesh and the lust thereof and you purposely obey god's command amen i can't get any more straightforward than that malachi hebrews 13 verses 15 and 16 please amen what is god well pleased with constantly saying praise the lord thank you jesus hallelujah let's all shout praise the lord ready praise the lord let's shout a little louder ready praise the lord let's try one more time louder ready praise the lord he's well pleased amen with the sacrifices of your lips he's well pleased and then he says when you communicate that means distribute to others that's why i always preach on that give to others whether it's just a little bit of money or a little bit of your time or a meal or something constantly communicate because god is well pleased when you're kind to other people well brother jess i don't know if i'm pleasing god well are you keeping the commandments are you praising him with your lips are you giving things to other people that's how you can positively know i'm part of the bride that pleases the husband jesus christ that's right oh i love that now before marrying this woman the spirit of the lord comes upon samson so can we all go to uh back to judges 14. lydia can you read verses five six and seven look what i love this look look what happens samson wants to take this bride but what's gotta happen before he takes a gentile bride amen let me go ahead verses 5 6 and 7. amen so before marrying the gentile the spirit of god comes upon him he slays a young lion who roared against him after a short meeting uh with the bride oh you got to keep reading yeah verse 8 and after a time he returned to take her and turned aside to see the carcass of the line and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion so his father went down into the woman and samson made there a feast so for so used the young men to do oh yeah to do and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought 30 companions to be with him so after this little meeting samson finds bees and honey in the lion's carcass he eats it shares with his parents doesn't tell him where he got it now look the slain line represents what god delivering jesus the lion of the tribe of judah to be slain before the gentile marriage praise god so you catch that what a strange story this is now here this proves this has to be right because out in the world that no one understands this story why would god put this story amen of a strong supernatural jew marrying a gentile bride amen why would god put that story in the bible because he was foretelling prophetically and my bible says this was eleven hundred years before god did it right so eleven hundred years before god took a gentile wife and jesus took a gentile bride he foreshadowed it in the life of samson i can say amen to that glory bye this is awesome now acts 2 3 i'm sorry acts 2 23 says jesus was delivered by the determinant council and for knowledge of god to be crucified and slain so this line was delivered to samson right the bible says so is christ delivered to be slain now i love this inside of the lion he found all this delicious honey right well what do you find in christ you find unsearchable riches you find spiritual treasures and you find delicious revelations from jesus's death right peter says god's word has a gracious taste in first peter 2 verses 2 and 3. amen he said taste and see that the lord is gracious amen hallelujah the slain lamb right the slave left the the crucifixion is so there there's great truths in there amen like brother ram was saying not just forgive some of your sins he said the blood of jesus christ is like bleach and it washes away all your sins amen there's great truths down in there praise god he's forgiven you all your trespasses there's delicious revelations in there remember john now here's where we're getting to our day john was commanded to eat the open book right formerly sealed with seven seals and testified it tasted like broccoli no it tasted like honey in revelation 10 verse 10. so one of these revelations they taste so good to us right they give us such hope they give us such joy such revelation but they come out of a slain lamb there it is that land that was slain how'd the book get open how these revelations come forth a lamb stood in revelation 5 as it was slain praise god and then he come and took the book and opened the book thereof and then john ate it and said it tastes like honey praise god oh my thank the lord i don't know you're going to hear this in the denomination church you're only going to hear this in the message of the hour praise god the story makes no sense to any denominational church remember that list of anglicans and catholics and mormons this story makes no sense to them but we can see it plainly it types the opening of the seven sealed book hallelujah so samson hosts a seven-day wedding feast right so let's read that verse 12 and samson said to them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you 30 sheets and 30 chains of garments but if you cannot declare it me then shall ye give me 30 sheets and 30 chains of garments and they send him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it and he said to them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came for sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle and it came to pass on the seventh day so notice this they can't figure out the the riddle or the mystery of the bridegroom jesus is the bridegroom right and he had a riddle for 2000 years they couldn't figure it out this riddle it could only be revealed on the seventh day or in the seventh church age praise god my church remember that only the first church age knew god was one person and then for the next six or next five church ages you know they they wondered oh we just can't figure out this such a riddle is he trinity is was he two persons three persons more persons they couldn't figure it out until the seventh church age that's when it was revealed praise god oh it's a beautiful type what a beautiful time so on the 30 day i'm sorry i'm sorry the 30. you get the challenge of 30 philistine men they were confounded six days on the seventh they secretly threatened to burn the bride's father's house if she didn't get the answer from samson for them so let's read that verse 15 to 16. and it came to pass on the seventh day that they sent unto samson's wife enticed thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we should burn thee in thy father's house with fire have he called us to take that we have is it not so i just caught it right there the whole world has to receive the revelation of this message right before the end of the world can come praise god jesus said this revelation must be preached to every nation and then shall the end come praise god hallelujah there it is thank the lord see you so why were they wanted there wanted because they have to be a witness they have to uh testify that they got a chance to hear even though they reject it they got a chance to hear it and then the judgment could come because of what they did with it they mistreated the bride right with the revelation they mistreated the bride now look at verse 16 and samson's wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and loves me not thou has put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and it's not told at me and he said unto her behold i have not told it to my father nor my mother and shall i tell thee and she wept before them the seven days while their feasts lasted and it came to pass in the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people and the men in the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said to them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle you messed with my bride that's how you got the answer right verse 19 and the spear lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and what'd he do he slew 30 of them right so the spirit lord come upon samson and he destroyed those men for mistreating his wife see took their spoil and gave change of garments under which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his father's house but samson's wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend so remember not all types are all perfect types but we see a lot of truth inside here right the bride cries she gets the answer shares it with them samson realized what's happened he still pays the garments but afterwards he goes down and slays those gentiles those those filthy gentiles right for mistreating his bride so where is this fulfilled in the times of the gentiles around 53 a.d to the present day this seven-day feast is the seven church ages samson's riddle is the mystery of god spoken of in revelation 10 7 that can only be revealed on the seventh and final day or the last church age john took the open book revealed the truth that denominations had lost for centuries and he eats and prophesies them again around the world i believe uh my book is a part of this taking around the world now we got email we didn't have email brotherham's day but just like today i can uh send an email to a foreign country and they have my modesty book today i just did that today i do that all the time i get to send it to zimbabwe i sent to nigeria last week i sent it all over we're taking the reveal word of god and sending it around the world praise god faster than it can ever go otherwise now just as samson's wife was the only one who had the answer to the riddle only christ's bride has the revelation of the previously sealed seven seal book or the bible the bride had to lay before samson and seek his love in order to get the revelation i like that amen brother brahma had to lay before jesus amen i don't know for eight days he shut in and uh brother did until he got the revelation of the seven seals amen i like that now we must stay before the presence of god like mary right the sister of lazarus she laid at the feet of jesus and everything she received that was real to her satan couldn't take from her it was revelation and we only find these rich sweet revelations being preached by jesus's bride for out of the eater jesus came forth meat and sweetness and remember what is strong meat brother can't preach it when he was here it's out of hebrews five strong meat is being able to judge between good and evil amen that's like today people you know like even people today they can't even judge uh simple little things about the word of god they can't even judge about what uh branham tabernacle is putting out they can't even judge it other churches that well uh brother brown is going to return in ministry they can't even judge these things right why can't they judge it because they don't have the meat praise god they don't have the meat they didn't go back to calvary amen they never had a real experience like samson like like like uh the getting the honey itself they never went back to the carcass they never went to calvary they never had a real sincere relationship with jesus christ where christ gave them the real honey of the word hallelujah praise god they never really got it i believe that they can't discern good and evil like i was saying earlier all the message churches now that's recently they start watching the super bowl they don't have enough discernment to know that right or wrong because they're not eating of the honey of god's word it's just an intellectual understanding to them it's not really honey it's not really food let me say like this they're not really eating the word when they come to service it's just it's coming up here but it's not going down may god help it for us to go all the way down to the stomach praise god all the way down where it becomes a part of you right where you and you digest it it becomes a part of you and it becomes you praise god you're given strength because you fully digested the word of god not just the head knowledge amen why can't they discern it's their it's witchcraft in those games why can't they why can't they discern there's witchcraft in that music they listen to why can't they discern that because they haven't tasted of the honey of god's word the bible said david said in psalm 119 103 how sweet are thy words which i'm sorry unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth oh my hallelujah thank the lord for that the church that's what we should see when we come to the house of god and when we read our bibles in the morning it should be like hunting to us it should be so sweet you should think oh my i never seen this before or i forgot about this thank god for the promises of god like just this morning i was reading matthew 24. i got so many different revelations out of there it's like a brand new chapter to me praise god i just i even even texted to my wife tonight before church i said this is all new to me this is fresh honey for me praise god i feel like i finally understand that for all these years of struggling with matthew 24 it's fresh revelation it's sweet tasting honey it's sweeter than honey to my mouth amen so back to the story samson destroys 30 men for threatening his bride and that fulfills or that will be fulfilled when jesus destroys these nations in the tribulation when heaven's wrath is poured out upon all those who tried to persecute christ's bride remember yeah let's go to revelation 18 real quick uh revelation 18. the bible says the voice of the bride will not be heard anymore in her right so see the voice of the bride is trying to get in there the word of god is trying to get to them but there's going to come a time where that bride's voice is cut off all right look there it is yeah verse 23 revelation 18 23 took me a few seconds to find that so forgive me that's just coming to my mind here and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth praise god so we can clearly see this jesus is going to get revenge upon this woman right this false church all these nations all these false all these gentiles that were evil that tried to come against the bride he's going to take that voice to the bride they're not going to hear the voice of the bride anymore and he's going to pour out tribulation and judgment upon the false church and her daughters right because we know that jesus said another revelation i'm going to cast her and her children into a bed with those nations that's another revelation from revelation chapter 2. amen so church what do we see in here we see another great beautiful picture of christ and his bride it's a mystery and i'll give this challenge to anybody somebody show me where a denomination has preached judges 14 and can make it say what we saw here tonight where it perfectly types into seven church ages a seven day feast seven church ages with the mystery coming at the last church age to the seventh angel right the seventh day the seventh church age and it tastes like honey there's honey coming out of the slain lamb or the same lion amen there's honey and we're supposed to eat the honey on the seventh day from the seven church age messenger what do we have we have a bible that's revealed to us we have a bible that the seals are off and we're feasting on the sweet tasting honey that's coming out of the lion praise god amen let's stand i better stop right there oh thank you just it's simulation by revelation praise god amen it's a ministry of the church as the bride who would have thought samson's timnith wife would have been a type of you and i the gentile bride not many would have thought that church but we're grateful that we can do our part and now to me this is even more personal because now i see my book and my ministry and the revelations god has shown me because i haven't denominated i haven't just stopped i've actually sought to gain more understanding of the lord now i see myself in this where it's part of my duty to take this revelation and make sure the revelation gets spread around the world i can see myself in the scripture how many like to see yourself in the word the man tells you all that he told that to the young people all the time he said your influence he said either be like paul or the rich young ruler remember that investments either be like moses or be like the rich young ruler right you got to invest in your young man you got to make a choice right rich young ruler here's another here's one rich young ruler here's another he said you've got to find yourself in this scripture i see myself right here in the scripture praise god amen jesus has revealed to me jesus has revealed his revelation to me and i'm going to prophesy again before every people taste i'm sorry people nation tongues kindred to all people praise god amen musicians can come praise god amen thank god for the revelations let's give the lord applause tonight praise god amen i'm grateful for that revelation originally preached that god gave to brother kim i've never seen anybody preach that before until god gave that to our brother now let me ask you does that does that add to the bible or does that does that inject any false doctrine in the scripture that i know of no does it does it give us more information about it to me it does yeah because now i can see when is when is this book going to finally be revealed when is the mystery is going to be solved in the seventh day the seven church age that's our day hallelujah and i also know brother and said the revelation of the seven church ages were thus saith the lord i know that oh my what a blessing church that we can see ourselves right here in the word of god are you
