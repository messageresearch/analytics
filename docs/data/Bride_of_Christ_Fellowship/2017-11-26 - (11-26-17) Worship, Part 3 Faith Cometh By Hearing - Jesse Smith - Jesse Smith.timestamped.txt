[39:42] merci all we want to look at what your
[39:44] face Allah and will surely do that by
[39:48] faith by your grace the searcher says
[39:51] we'll have bodies like unto your
[39:53] glorious body father though today and
[39:56] guess that we'd see them the basis of
[39:58] your Holy Spirit day we'd see much
[40:00] holiday spirit is saying today as we
[40:02] look upon your character we look on your
[40:05] web nor traces of as a see your
[40:08] spiritual face today Lord what you would
[40:11] speak to us we know you'd only have a
[40:13] word voice it can only come to the word
[40:15] don't we trust you to speak to us it may
[40:18] help us to get out of the flesh and into
[40:20] the sphere Lord God to hear of the
[40:22] Spirit saying to the churches for your
[40:26] mercy bless every soul that's here every
[40:28] salt feast upon the Living Word of God
[40:30] for that is shifu force today thank you
[40:33] for the season of Thanksgiving
[40:35] nearly intruding over so grateful we're
[40:37] so thankful for all you've done for as
[40:40] we said on Wednesday that all the
[40:41] benefits we have not forgotten all the
[40:44] benefits we thank you for all the thank
[40:47] you that we could be like that we
[40:49] these witnesses to our failings lord I
[40:51] just pray Lord in every soul one that
[40:54] doesn't know you come to them use this
[40:56] as vessels to do that door we pray give
[40:59] all the glory of Jesus Christ Romans
[41:09] chapter 10 I can preach on part three of
[41:11] this worship series like to have a
[41:13] subtopic of faith cometh by here instead
[41:37] 17 how many happy be the house the Lord
[41:39] today so thankful for the house of
[41:42] correction praise God so grateful to
[41:44] come to God's house and hear the word of
[41:45] God that our souls might be corrected
[41:47] with the word of the Lord the Bible says
[41:51] if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you
[41:52] more
[41:53] you correct a wise man he'll love you
[41:56] more praise God so we want the Holy
[41:58] Spirit to correct us today praise the
[41:59] Lord lead us and guide us into all truth
[42:01] amen
[42:02] Romans 10:17 for there say Amen let's
[42:05] just read verse 17 together then we'll
[42:07] have you take your seats verse 17 let's
[42:10] begin on three one two three so then
[42:11] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[42:14] the Word of God may God's blessings
[42:16] reading of his word may be seated
[42:20] so I'd like to continue this thought on
[42:22] worship and I want to recall a few
[42:25] quotations remember worship means to
[42:29] kiss like a dog licking his master's
[42:31] hand
[42:32] that's what worship means it means
[42:35] surprise rate oneself in homage to do
[42:38] reverence and to worship amen
[42:42] remember were told us the importance of
[42:46] Revelation by the holy spirit to a true
[42:50] believer can never be overemphasized
[42:54] never we could never preach on that too
[42:57] long we could not never overemphasize
[42:59] how important it is for a true believer
[43:02] to
[43:02] a revelation of the Holy Spirit it can
[43:06] never be overemphasized we saw last
[43:08] Sunday with Hannah how could how could
[43:11] we overemphasize the importance of the
[43:13] revelation that God gave to Hannah that
[43:15] she would have Samuel how could we
[43:18] overemphasize that how can we say well
[43:20] you're putting too much emphasis on that
[43:21] No her whole life was centered around
[43:24] thus saith the Lord
[43:26] her whole destiny to bring forth the son
[43:29] hallelujah and then multiple children
[43:31] after that but her whole destiny
[43:33] centered around I've got to bring forth
[43:35] the son I've got to bring forth I have a
[43:38] desire to bring forth children in this
[43:40] earth her whole destiny centered around
[43:42] this desire in her heart and when she
[43:45] got thus saith the Lord it meant
[43:47] everything to her and we saw how she got
[43:50] it she fasted before she came to church
[43:52] she was fasting she was praying she had
[43:55] to go through the beating and the
[43:56] pounding of her adversaries she had to
[43:58] go through the years of trials the years
[44:01] of disappointment of not having children
[44:03] the years of disappointment of being
[44:05] rebuked and teased by her her husband's
[44:08] other wife should go through years and
[44:11] years of trials but one day she when she
[44:14] got real desperate she went to the house
[44:16] of God and Eli said God will give you
[44:19] your requests and God gave it to her so
[44:21] the Bible said her countenance changed
[44:23] if we could only have that today praise
[44:25] God who our faces would be different
[44:27] when we walk out of the service amen her
[44:29] face was different her countenance was
[44:31] changed nine months later Samuel come on
[44:34] the scene Amen so the importance of
[44:36] revelation can never be overemphasized
[44:38] that was so important and for you and I
[44:41] it's so important for us to know that
[44:43] faith comes by hearing the word that
[44:46] we're gonna hear today praise God and
[44:48] not just today but every service every
[44:50] service is important to the true
[44:53] Christian just like every meal is
[44:54] important to the hungry person out there
[44:56] you're probably not you probably to skip
[44:58] breakfast this morning you probably
[44:59] didn't skip supper last night you
[45:01] certainly didn't skip Thanksgiving lunch
[45:03] right because it was so important to
[45:05] have your favorite foods well that's
[45:07] what it's like coming to church today
[45:08] we're gonna have our favorite food it's
[45:11] God's Word amen now that's the true
[45:14] believer remember it can't be over
[45:16] emphasized
[45:16] to the true believer to the make
[45:18] believer doesn't doesn't really matter
[45:21] they they don't really come to church to
[45:22] have a revelation or to get the say at
[45:24] the Lord but the true believer comes to
[45:27] get thus saith the Lord amen
[45:29] how they do you now let's go through the
[45:30] scriptures back in Romans 10 here verse
[45:36] 9 but what say that the word is nigh
[45:37] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[45:39] that is the Word of Faith which we
[45:42] preach it's so important that we preach
[45:46] faith that we preach Revelation faith
[45:48] means assurance it's so important that I
[45:50] preach to you the assurance of God's
[45:53] Word how many you are assured God will
[45:55] keep his word to you we preach that we
[45:58] preach faith have faith in God have
[46:00] confidence in God believe God we must
[46:03] preach that but it's also got to be in
[46:05] your heart and it's got to be in my
[46:07] heart and it's got to be in all of our
[46:09] mouths we have to make sure we're
[46:11] constantly sharing I can I know God's
[46:13] gonna do this I can't wait till God God
[46:15] already did this you know we can even
[46:16] speak future tense God is gonna do this
[46:18] God has already done this we're so
[46:20] thankful we've got to speak it it's got
[46:22] to be in our heart and then it's got to
[46:24] be in our mouth as well verse 9 that if
[46:27] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[46:28] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine
[46:30] heart that God hath raised him from the
[46:32] dead thou shalt be saved
[46:34] how many grateful for that Amen so
[46:36] you've got to confess Jesus publicly
[46:38] you've got to speak that I know he's a
[46:40] son of God I know he's the risen Savior
[46:42] I know he's in my life I know he
[46:44] sanctified in my life I know I'm
[46:46] justified I know I'm filled with the
[46:47] Holy Ghost amen we must have the
[46:50] confession and the possession of the
[46:52] word amen now I says for with the heart
[46:56] man believeth unto righteousness and
[46:58] with the mouth confession is made unto
[47:00] salvation that's my brother and said you
[47:03] can cry and scream all night and beg God
[47:05] for salvation but at some point you've
[47:08] got to accept it you at some point
[47:12] you've got to accept the Holy Ghost
[47:13] you've got to accept sanctification you
[47:15] got to say yes that's mine yes the Holy
[47:17] Ghost is mine yes salvation is mine and
[47:19] once you start accepting it it will
[47:21] start working in your life but you gotta
[47:23] accept it first amen you've got to
[47:25] believe it by faith amen
[47:27] verse 11 for the scripture says who said
[47:30] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[47:31] for there's no difference between the
[47:33] Jew and the Greek for the same lord over
[47:35] all is rich unto all that call upon him
[47:39] Amen what a beautiful scripture for
[47:42] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[47:44] Lord shall be saved
[47:45] how then shall they call on him in whom
[47:48] they have not believed and how should
[47:50] they believe in him of whom they have
[47:51] not heard and how shall they hear
[47:53] without a preacher and how shall they
[47:55] preach except they be sent as is written
[47:58] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[48:00] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[48:02] glad tidings of good things
[48:05] amen but they've not all obeyed the
[48:08] gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath
[48:11] believed our report so then faith cometh
[48:14] by hearing and hearing by the Word of
[48:17] God O God has - yes - for know that
[48:21] somebody wants to be saved and when he
[48:23] knows somebody wants to be saved
[48:24] he's got to send a preacher and that
[48:26] preacher has to preach the Word of God
[48:28] and then that here has to hear the word
[48:31] of God and accept him and then confess
[48:34] in their mouth that they're saved and
[48:35] that they have salvation that they have
[48:38] forgiveness and now they would say how
[48:40] beautiful are the meetings that we have
[48:42] where there's preaching because people's
[48:44] lives are being changed amen
[48:46] people's destinies were from the pits of
[48:48] hell but now they're to that heavenly
[48:50] city the New Jerusalem amen
[48:52] that's all through the preaching of the
[48:55] word of God now as we looked at worship
[48:57] this is what we must be so careful in
[48:59] worship to make sure that we're having
[49:02] faith that comes by hearing the Word of
[49:05] God as I said on Wednesday if we leave
[49:07] the church here and got nothing out of
[49:08] it it wasn't God's fault it was our
[49:11] fault because we must make sure we hear
[49:14] the route went right way and if God will
[49:16] help me by the end of the service I want
[49:17] to get too dull of hearing there's a
[49:19] condition that comes upon people around
[49:21] the message faster than any other church
[49:23] because we're on the message of the hour
[49:25] and it's completely scriptural if you
[49:27] don't hear and get revelation from these
[49:30] services then you're quick to fall away
[49:32] quick to die in things of the Holy
[49:34] Spirit and it's absolutely scriptural so
[49:37] it's so important that you and I give
[49:39] our full attention and say God speak
[49:41] your word to me let me hear it not
[49:43] with my ears let me here in my heart
[49:45] amen let me walk out of here with some
[49:47] more supernatural strength or
[49:49] supernatural power raise my faith I need
[49:52] more faith to meet the challenge of this
[49:53] hour that's why I come to hear the word
[49:56] of God to be strengthened god help us to
[49:58] desire more of his word amen glory now
[50:01] go to Roman's 1 we're in chapter 10 go
[50:04] to Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1
[50:14] verse 11 now Paul desire to go to Roman
[50:18] the church in Rome for one reason now
[50:21] there's of course many reasons but the
[50:22] main reason was verse 11 for I long to
[50:25] see you that I may impart unto you some
[50:27] spiritual gift to the end that ye may be
[50:32] established why did Paul want to visit
[50:36] that church so the gift of the Holy
[50:38] Spirit his life could begin ministering
[50:40] to them and something through the preach
[50:43] now wouldn't be something he could give
[50:44] them it would actually be something he
[50:46] would just say to them it would be God's
[50:48] Word and if they were faithful here's
[50:50] the word would go out of paws lips and
[50:52] the people spiritually would grab ahold
[50:54] of that word and say thank God we've
[50:57] received a gift today the Holy Spirit
[50:59] imparted to me some supernatural gift
[51:02] amen holiday it might be a gift of
[51:05] healing it might be a gift of salvation
[51:07] it might have been the gift of the Holy
[51:08] Ghost but this is what Paul desired I
[51:11] want to see you so the gifts of God can
[51:13] begin working and God's people can
[51:15] receive things from heaven amen
[51:17] this was a desire I hope that's why you
[51:20] came to church today that's why we ought
[51:22] to come to church to receive some
[51:23] spiritual gift today amen exactly right
[51:27] now I want to go to Galatians chapter 3
[51:31] verse 1 if you have your Bibles
[51:32] Galatians 3 verse 1 this morning and
[51:37] every time I preach I'm trying to
[51:40] minister miracles to you people how many
[51:42] could say amen to that when brother and
[51:44] when brother Samuel came when brother
[51:47] Craig and brother Brooks where they come
[51:49] in knew they're trying to administer
[51:50] some spiritual gift to the people how
[51:54] are they doing that they're trying to
[51:55] get in the channel the Holy Spirit
[51:56] that's
[51:57] holy spirit will give them something to
[51:58] say that they'll preach it to the people
[52:00] and the people will grab ahold of that
[52:02] and say that was just for me that what
[52:05] revelation was for me and now I have
[52:07] some spiritual gift I'm trying to work
[52:09] miracles this morning by the Holy Spirit
[52:12] amen but the people got to be willing
[52:14] I've got to be willing to get in the
[52:16] channel of the Spirit that miracles can
[52:18] take place this morning amen
[52:20] Oh hallelujah I hope you understand
[52:23] let's I think you understand in
[52:24] Galatians 3 verse 1 Oh church is not a
[52:27] boring thing it's not a it's not a hard
[52:30] thing it ought to be the most exciting
[52:31] thing there is on the face of the earth
[52:33] that's coming to church amen
[52:34] but it all depends on our attitudes how
[52:37] we come faith only comes by hearing the
[52:40] preaching of the word amen
[52:42] I've got plenty of quotes for you so I
[52:45] know that you quote lovers I know you'll
[52:46] like those I'm one of those quote lovers
[52:49] Galatians 3 verse 1 o foolish Galatians
[52:52] who has bewitched you see someone put a
[52:55] demon spell on them a false spirit that
[52:58] ye should not obey the truth see when
[53:00] someone stops obeying the true Word of
[53:02] God they're bewitched a spirits gun on
[53:05] them in the church said and anything in
[53:09] any little simple thing when they stop
[53:10] obeying the Word of God they're
[53:12] bewitched they have a spiritual demon
[53:15] anointing them he said before whose eyes
[53:18] Jesus Christ has been evidently set
[53:20] forth crucified among you this only
[53:24] would I learn of you so this is what I'm
[53:26] learning he's saying from you did you
[53:29] receive receive you the spirit by the
[53:30] works of the law or by the hearing of
[53:33] faith did you receive the Holy Spirit by
[53:37] keeping the law of Moses or did you
[53:39] receive the Holy Spirit by hearing the
[53:41] Word of God and by faith you received it
[53:45] look at verse 3 oh are ye so foolish
[53:48] having begun in the spirit are you now
[53:50] made perfect in the flesh that would be
[53:54] like us going back to a circumcision
[53:55] well you've got to be circumcised of the
[53:57] flesh to be say that's what Paul is
[53:58] telling these Galatians
[54:00] like them the man tried to convince me
[54:02] all you need to keep the Sabbath day the
[54:04] natural Sabbath day I said sunday is my
[54:06] Sabbath day right sunday is my day of
[54:10] rest is my nature
[54:11] day of rest but like in the Old
[54:12] Testament priests had to work on the
[54:14] Sabbath so my day off I'm actually
[54:15] working on my day off but jesus said
[54:18] that doesn't blasting the Word of God
[54:19] because someone's got to work I'm a
[54:21] minister to the people and they try to
[54:23] bring you under these laws and and
[54:26] things that are not in the Word of God
[54:28] now look at verse five no verse four
[54:32] have you suffered so many things in vain
[54:33] if it be yet in vain I look at here's
[54:36] verse 5 this is what I was saying I'm
[54:37] trying to minister miracles to you by
[54:40] trying to get in this spirit to speak
[54:42] God's Word but then you and I all of us
[54:44] are supposed to receive that word I'll
[54:47] give you some examples he therefore that
[54:49] ministers to you the spirit and worketh
[54:53] miracles among you doeth he it by the
[54:56] works of the law or by the hearing of
[54:58] faith never understand that to see what
[55:04] preachers are coming to preachers are
[55:06] here to perform miracles
[55:07] I'm speak I'm supposed to speak words
[55:09] that will do a miracle in your life but
[55:13] the people have to hear it they have to
[55:15] receive it
[55:17] how many can say amen to that I wrote
[55:19] down a few examples of recent miracles
[55:21] we've had because remember a miracle is
[55:25] just like one of the nine gifts of the
[55:27] Holy Spirit right so whether you have a
[55:30] tongue where they have interpretation
[55:31] where they have a prophecy no matter
[55:33] what it is they're all on the same level
[55:34] because they're all gifts of the Holy
[55:35] Spirit
[55:36] a year ago this month was when sister
[55:39] Marie came up and she was at his
[55:41] bleeding condition and I preached on the
[55:43] five identification of the true church
[55:45] and she said as I prayed for her at that
[55:47] altar over there
[55:48] the bleeding stopped and she called me
[55:50] the next day her and brother Kevin said
[55:51] God did a miracle in the service that
[55:54] was one year ago this month see what was
[55:58] I doing I was ministering by the Spirit
[56:01] miracles glory hello but what did it
[56:06] take she had to respond she had to hear
[56:08] yes God's church does work miracles
[56:10] that's one of the identification of a
[56:12] true church these signs shall follow
[56:15] them that believe amen all hallelujah
[56:18] all the time are you with me sister
[56:22] Naomi I'm gonna use her last February
[56:23] spoke in tongues in that service
[56:24] member that tongues is on the same level
[56:27] as America I mean know that all the nine
[56:30] gifts are on the same level and the
[56:31] church said and we prayed for their
[56:33] interpretation and I was wondering if
[56:35] somebody gonna get so anointed they
[56:36] might give the interpretation that's a
[56:39] move of the Holy Spirit and we
[56:41] appreciate our sister being led by the
[56:42] Holy Spirit I really appreciate her
[56:44] example there to be moved by the Holy
[56:46] Spirit who's speaking in tongue because
[56:48] so many people might be afraid and no
[56:50] doubt maybe she was too but she was
[56:51] willing to get in the spirit how many
[56:53] one to get in the spirit
[56:54] I'm when I come here when any preacher
[56:57] comes here we're trying to minister
[56:59] miracles we're trying to impart some
[57:01] gift to you to preach the Word of God
[57:04] but the people got to be able to hear it
[57:06] and they got to be able to receive it
[57:08] are you with me faith comes by hearing
[57:12] the Word of God I hope you understand
[57:16] that by the grace of Lord last May I was
[57:19] in Lima and preached on the Bride of
[57:22] Christ and the day of Pentecost and you
[57:25] probably member the testimony when I
[57:26] come back we I was praying for this
[57:27] young man
[57:28] at the altar he was given his heart back
[57:29] to God he was weeping and snot and
[57:31] crying and sister Karen Sanders had come
[57:34] up for prayer why after I got done
[57:35] praying for him about a half-hour I go
[57:37] over to sister Karen said sister Karen
[57:39] desire prayer she said God already
[57:40] healed me my knee is completely healed
[57:42] in the name of Jesus I thought that's so
[57:44] nice of God while I was busy he went
[57:46] over and healed the person who was
[57:47] waiting to be prayed for that's that's
[57:49] so nice of the Lord Jesus
[57:51] that's how loving God is now who
[57:54] ministered that miracle it was Christ
[57:56] but it was Christ working through a
[57:58] vessel God wants to work through
[58:00] preachers who are filled with the Holy
[58:02] Ghost
[58:02] glory faith comes by hearing and hearing
[58:06] by the Word of God I went back and
[58:09] listened to that sermon I preached in
[58:10] Guyana from 2012 the sermon where a man
[58:13] was healed of arthritis and what were
[58:17] some other ones I forget demons were
[58:19] cast out I went back and listened to it
[58:21] I saved it and I was just so blessed to
[58:22] hear all the testimonies about being
[58:24] demons being cast out and people being
[58:26] healed that was the same trip when a
[58:28] woman come after me crying after service
[58:30] and said I had a kidney stone go after
[58:32] you prayed for me I felt a hot sensation
[58:34] and drove it out of my foot what are we
[58:36] doing here we're here to
[58:38] down the kingdom of darkness the Word of
[58:41] God always takes down the kingdom of
[58:44] darkness hallelujah but we've got to be
[58:47] in the channel to receive the Word of
[58:49] God how many understand that by God's
[58:51] grace you see God wants to do miracles
[58:55] but we've got to be able to hear and
[58:57] receive the miracle I mean understand
[59:00] that now you remember the order we went
[59:06] through it last Sunday the order of
[59:07] getting in the spirit is to come to
[59:10] church first know
[59:12] read your Bible first know the prophet
[59:15] of God said the order to receive a
[59:17] miracle is to pray first pray first he
[59:25] said so many people get baptized but
[59:26] they don't get in the spirit of
[59:28] repentance we see it all the time
[59:31] oh I'm so bad I got in the spirit of
[59:32] repentance a pen when I repented I took
[59:35] down all my evil posters threw away all
[59:37] my rock and roll and rap CDs I started
[59:39] paying back all the money I stole from
[59:40] my mom just like Zacchaeus amen sorry
[59:44] and if anybody really gets saved today
[59:46] they'll make all their wrongs right
[59:48] they'll live a Christian life they'll
[59:50] try to undo all the damage they've done
[59:52] as a sinner if they really repent from
[59:54] their sins
[59:55] amen exactly right and you so you see
[1:00:00] that's so crucial to get in the spirit
[1:00:03] first to pray first prophet says pray
[1:00:06] first he said then get in the spirit now
[1:00:10] I want to read this quote here
[1:00:11] well the RAM said I'm going to use the
[1:00:13] subject of expectation how many ever
[1:00:15] hear people say oh you have expectation
[1:00:17] how many ever people ever say that
[1:00:19] expectation is just expecting God to
[1:00:21] move like you're anticipating I have
[1:00:24] anticipation God's gonna move now you
[1:00:26] came today and you had into anticipation
[1:00:28] brother Jesse's gonna preach right
[1:00:31] you had anticipation Malachi is probably
[1:00:33] gonna play the piano you had
[1:00:34] anticipation but spiritual anticipation
[1:00:39] for God is expecting God to speak
[1:00:42] expecting God to move I expect I
[1:00:46] anticipated to see Jose I anticipated to
[1:00:48] see different ones I anticipated that
[1:00:50] but we need to end
[1:00:52] seeing the miracle working God that's
[1:00:56] true worship and it's never gods far as
[1:01:00] I said it's always our lack of maturity
[1:01:03] or it's always our laziness or it's it's
[1:01:06] our unbelief and God help us just to say
[1:01:09] we're sorry and get right with God it's
[1:01:12] so simple
[1:01:13] well Ram says this expectation usually
[1:01:17] is based upon faith and you have to have
[1:01:19] faith before you can expect anything to
[1:01:24] see before you can come to church with
[1:01:26] expectation you've got to pray first
[1:01:28] meet got in there God raises your faith
[1:01:31] in prayer right and then you come to
[1:01:34] church and you come expecting to hear
[1:01:36] from God
[1:01:37] I hope somebody came that way this
[1:01:40] morning if you did you're gonna leave
[1:01:41] out here with the new countenance you're
[1:01:43] gonna leave out here with a fresh
[1:01:45] revelation if not it's gonna be very
[1:01:48] hard you can still do it but you got to
[1:01:50] quickly repent amen
[1:01:51] right because God will anoint a dirty
[1:01:55] vessel God won't bless a vessel that's
[1:01:59] in disobedience to the Word of God
[1:02:03] so first is pray that creates
[1:02:06] expectation through faith the next step
[1:02:11] is hearing second step is hearing and
[1:02:13] receiving revelation or faith with thus
[1:02:16] saith the Lord during the preaching of
[1:02:18] the word and then the third step is
[1:02:21] pleasing God with obedience to whatever
[1:02:23] he said that's what happened to Hannah
[1:02:25] right Hannah came there she was praying
[1:02:28] she was under expectation brother
[1:02:30] Branham said she started screaming that
[1:02:32] you don't hear what you'll hear when I'm
[1:02:33] said let me let me read this real quick
[1:02:35] I got it ready down here at the bottom
[1:02:36] of my notes look up brother Branham said
[1:02:42] he said she started screaming he said a
[1:02:46] lot of women were saying hey miss Jones
[1:02:48] has a new head on isn't that beautiful
[1:02:49] Oh mrs. John Doe she has the same old
[1:02:52] veil she wore the last ten years she
[1:02:54] said he said that's why they went to
[1:02:56] church but Hannah was going for another
[1:02:58] purpose he said god help us when we're
[1:03:00] going to the house of God not to see how
[1:03:03] when others dressed or see
[1:03:05] who's there but for one solid purpose
[1:03:07] that's to meet God a man exactly right
[1:03:13] now let me skip ahead here
[1:03:17] well Ram said no he said you're coming
[1:03:20] to the house of God with faith he got to
[1:03:22] faith first Hannah walked in she run
[1:03:24] down to the altar fell down raised up
[1:03:26] her hand and began to scream till she
[1:03:29] interrupted the whole service hallelujah
[1:03:33] Hannah I'm just gonna say holla do we
[1:03:34] need some Hannah's in our church we got
[1:03:36] one natural we got one natural Hannah we
[1:03:40] need some brothers that'll have that
[1:03:42] spirit of Hannah you understand the
[1:03:43] spirit of desperation you'll come here
[1:03:46] with such expectation
[1:03:47] you'll start praying in the house of God
[1:03:49] you'll start feeling God's President
[1:03:51] that's what we all want to feel God's
[1:03:52] presence we want to feel something then
[1:03:55] that we normally don't feel in the world
[1:03:57] we want to feel the sweetness and the
[1:03:59] holiness of Jesus Christ hallelujah he
[1:04:04] said she began to scream and interrupted
[1:04:06] the whole service even the priests
[1:04:08] thought she was drunk he said that's the
[1:04:11] way a whole lot of people that get
[1:04:12] sincere do brother asked a lot of
[1:04:14] sincere people like to scream sincere
[1:04:17] people how many appreciates sincere
[1:04:18] people when you're sincere you might
[1:04:21] screen you might cry you might raise
[1:04:23] your hand you might shout you might jump
[1:04:24] you might raise your hands and wave your
[1:04:27] hands when you're sincere with God
[1:04:29] something has to move in your life
[1:04:32] is that right he said they're just
[1:04:39] misunderstood she he wasn't drunk
[1:04:41] she was just misunderstood and many men
[1:04:44] and women who are really from the core
[1:04:46] of their heart fully surrendered to the
[1:04:47] Lord Jesus they're not crazy they're
[1:04:50] misunderstood yeah that's what I say
[1:04:53] about me I'm just misunderstood when I
[1:04:56] get in the spirit or get happier start
[1:04:58] weeping and crying or shouting or
[1:04:59] screaming or something like that it's
[1:05:01] they're just I'm just misunderstood I
[1:05:03] just loved Jesus so much I healed all my
[1:05:05] emotions to him that's what we all
[1:05:07] should do and we should all praise the
[1:05:09] Lord and we should all expect to hear
[1:05:10] from heaven this morning
[1:05:11] hey man see Hannah came to church for a
[1:05:15] different purpose she didn't come to see
[1:05:16] who was there she came to meet God
[1:05:19] she came under expectation which is the
[1:05:21] only way we should come to church heal I
[1:05:27] came out and said woman why you're
[1:05:28] always drunk on strong drinks she said
[1:05:29] My Lord I'm not drunk I'm praying the
[1:05:31] Lord take away my reproach he said the
[1:05:33] Lord granted to you the Lord bless you
[1:05:35] and that's all she wanted to know how
[1:05:38] many here would say I just want to know
[1:05:40] God's gonna bless me I just want to know
[1:05:42] God's gonna answer my heart's desire oh
[1:05:44] that's all Hannah God and she left there
[1:05:47] happy as she could be he said God's
[1:05:49] priests had announced God's blessing on
[1:05:51] her and she was at the house of God hey
[1:05:55] man that's exactly right church that's
[1:05:58] how we got to come to the house of God
[1:06:00] does that right understand I'm sorry
[1:06:04] does everybody understand okay well then
[1:06:07] we got to come with expectation I'm
[1:06:10] trying to get people to come early to
[1:06:11] pray or at least pray at your house make
[1:06:12] sure you're prayed up because listen
[1:06:14] Church you can feel it when you walk in
[1:06:15] the sanctuary you can feel it people are
[1:06:18] prayed up or not if you've got the Holy
[1:06:19] Spirit you can feel as program said as I
[1:06:22] start preaching I can tell who's
[1:06:23] interested in the service or not I can
[1:06:25] tell who's who's polling and who's bored
[1:06:27] I can tell I'm fighting a spiritual
[1:06:30] battle I'm not fighting against flesh
[1:06:32] and blood I'm fighting demon powers that
[1:06:34] are trying to keep the imparting of
[1:06:36] supernatural gifts away from you and the
[1:06:40] way for me all of us we've seen I just
[1:06:42] gave numerous examples I went out to New
[1:06:45] York and the pastor's daughter danced in
[1:06:46] the spirit when she wakes up from the
[1:06:48] drunken state she's in the back facing
[1:06:50] the wall faces the face in the clock
[1:06:52] she's so drunk in this peer she didn't
[1:06:54] know which way she was facing Church
[1:06:56] that's what the Holy Ghost does but the
[1:06:57] man said it makes you forget even what
[1:06:59] your name is
[1:06:59] it makes you just trust God and believe
[1:07:02] God and hang on to his word amen brother
[1:07:05] Brooks was preaching and a woman got
[1:07:07] healed with her left she's gonna raise
[1:07:08] her left hand she got here right there
[1:07:09] and come up testified right before the
[1:07:11] church seven people said they got filled
[1:07:13] with the Holy Ghost these signs follow
[1:07:15] them that believe but we have to have
[1:07:17] hearts that can hear we have to come
[1:07:19] with expectation we have to hear the
[1:07:21] word of God make sure we're hearing it
[1:07:24] not just listening at it hearing at it
[1:07:27] where it actually impacts our lives
[1:07:30] I don't know anybody he
[1:07:32] including myself that is so perfect
[1:07:34] hearing the Word of God you don't need
[1:07:36] to hear this sermon because if you did
[1:07:39] we'd see that we'd see the supernatural
[1:07:40] multiplying in your life we would hear
[1:07:42] sign after sign after sign that's why I
[1:07:44] share the testimonies when I go preach
[1:07:46] other places or we have here I share
[1:07:48] them to let you know that these signs
[1:07:49] follow true believers and that ought to
[1:07:54] create expectation our lives but brother
[1:07:56] Ram tells us how we do that we got to
[1:07:58] pray first before we come to church and
[1:08:01] he says if you pray before the service
[1:08:03] in the Holy Spirit you're guaranteed to
[1:08:05] hear from heaven but most people are not
[1:08:08] that interested they're more interested
[1:08:09] in their phones or their their families
[1:08:12] or their jobs or money or worldly things
[1:08:15] they're more interested in that and they
[1:08:16] don't have enough interest in the
[1:08:18] hearing of God's Holy Word they have so
[1:08:21] many voices and there's so many emails
[1:08:23] and so many texts and so many busy
[1:08:25] things that do to-do list they have so
[1:08:27] much to do they're hearing so many
[1:08:28] voices that they can't hear the voice of
[1:08:31] the Holy Spirit
[1:08:31] I want to hear they're still small voice
[1:08:33] of the Holy Spirit and it'll only come
[1:08:36] through the preaching of the word of God
[1:08:38] exactly right the brother man said how
[1:08:47] can I teach him algebra when they won't
[1:08:49] learn their ABCs how many want to go
[1:08:54] into spiritual algebra here that means
[1:08:56] you go into unknowns because algebra is
[1:08:58] always solving an unknown you got an
[1:09:00] unknown problem in your life that maybe
[1:09:01] you talked to me about you can't solve
[1:09:03] we need a gift of the Holy Spirit to
[1:09:05] move and operate in the church that will
[1:09:07] make known what is unknown it will
[1:09:10] either be a prophecy or to discern the
[1:09:12] thoughts intents of the heart
[1:09:13] it'll be divine healing this is what's
[1:09:15] keeping the healing away that's algebra
[1:09:18] when the Holy Spirit moves and you and I
[1:09:20] know it's moving we can sense his
[1:09:22] presence because we're in an atmosphere
[1:09:23] of expectation we're in an atmosphere of
[1:09:25] faith we know thus saith the Lord is
[1:09:27] here and gods shouldn't want to receive
[1:09:29] the blessings of God Amen that's exactly
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:34] but we got to come to church like we're
[1:09:37] supposed to come to church
[1:09:42] it's exactly right now go to Hebrews 4 -
[1:09:46] let's just read this real briefly here
[1:09:48] you remember God got so fed up with the
[1:09:51] Israelites he wouldn't let them in the
[1:09:53] Promised Land because they didn't mix
[1:09:55] faith with the hearing of Moses his
[1:09:58] preaching and you and I have the same
[1:10:01] responsibility today Hebrews 4 - the
[1:10:12] times I've seen the holy spirit moved
[1:10:13] the most is when the people were in the
[1:10:15] most prayer in Guyana when God did all
[1:10:18] those miracles brother max called me
[1:10:21] afterwards I even listening to it on the
[1:10:22] sermon - he said as we started preaching
[1:10:24] there they started having morning prayer
[1:10:26] meetings during the camp meeting and it
[1:10:30] was at the end of that camp meaning that
[1:10:31] I cast out five Devils I went back and
[1:10:33] listened to it to make sure but the
[1:10:36] demon the casting out didn't start right
[1:10:38] away they had to get in the atmosphere
[1:10:40] of expectation and then but I think it
[1:10:43] was the fourth day after praying four
[1:10:45] days in a row in the morning then demons
[1:10:46] got cast out if you want to see demons
[1:10:48] cast out Church we got to pray if you
[1:10:52] want to see miracles and the preachers
[1:10:53] trying to administer miracles we have to
[1:10:55] pray you have to pray first and get in
[1:10:58] the spirit and then come under
[1:11:00] expectation then hang on to the Word of
[1:11:02] God and receive the Word of God and
[1:11:04] watch it come to pass
[1:11:05] uh-huh it's God's perfect equation it's
[1:11:09] God's perfect supernatural equation amen
[1:11:13] Hebrews four - who'd like to read that
[1:11:15] for me now I saw your hand first thank
[1:11:17] you so good so you have to have a true
[1:11:29] preacher of the word of God but then you
[1:11:31] have to have faith which is assurance or
[1:11:33] revelation and then you'll profit from
[1:11:36] the preaching of the word of God
[1:11:38] remember brother Branham said I never
[1:11:40] went to church and left disappointed
[1:11:42] that means he was able to go to church
[1:11:44] and receive something from God every
[1:11:46] service praise the Lord do you think
[1:11:50] God's gonna invite his people his
[1:11:52] children to eat at this beautiful table
[1:11:54] that we have of the Word of God
[1:11:56] then not give them the best food that
[1:11:57] they could possibly have Church do you
[1:12:00] realize this I heard brother Diggs say
[1:12:01] this I was listen to his sermon did you
[1:12:03] realize this we have heard preaching
[1:12:06] that the Lutheran's never heard we are
[1:12:10] hearing preaching that the Wesley uns
[1:12:12] never heard we are hearing preaching
[1:12:15] that Paul even didn't even get to hear
[1:12:17] because the book of Revelation we're
[1:12:20] hearing preaching that the Xu's the
[1:12:22] street Pentecostals never got to hear
[1:12:23] and we're so what Satan's battling us so
[1:12:26] much we have a hard time even getting
[1:12:27] excited about it why it's not because
[1:12:29] the words not great their word is the
[1:12:31] revealed word of the hour it's because
[1:12:33] we're not praying first to get in the
[1:12:36] spirit of the word of God that's exactly
[1:12:40] right
[1:12:40] I'm gonna prove it to you by this
[1:12:42] there's a scripture to prove right there
[1:12:44] imma prove to you by quote as well
[1:12:46] the only time there's a lack of
[1:12:48] supernatural is when the word is not
[1:12:51] mixed with faith if you don't accept the
[1:12:54] faith the word of faith I'm preaching
[1:12:56] today it will do you no good you'll
[1:12:58] leave out here with a dull ear it's so
[1:13:02] serious you think God plays games with
[1:13:04] this word absolutely not we need ears
[1:13:09] that are circumcised the Bible says dole
[1:13:11] means heavy never feel like got a heavy
[1:13:14] ear that sounds pretty heavy to our ears
[1:13:21] should not be heavy our ears need to be
[1:13:23] circumcised that's what the word heavy
[1:13:25] means or dole means heavy eyes are so
[1:13:29] heavy that Jesus a they have eyes that
[1:13:30] can see but they can't see they have
[1:13:33] ears that can hear but they can't hear
[1:13:35] the word they're hearing they're not
[1:13:37] mixing it with faith they're not praying
[1:13:39] before they're just going to church to
[1:13:42] play church we should not play Church
[1:13:44] your spiritual life is going to decline
[1:13:47] you're going to be disappointed you're
[1:13:49] going to be miserable if you're not
[1:13:50] praying in the spirit and then grabbing
[1:13:52] ahold of God's revelations hey man
[1:13:56] exactly right Church that's real
[1:13:59] Christianity and don't look at anybody
[1:14:01] else say well if he would do it or she
[1:14:03] gets in the spirit I will you get in the
[1:14:05] spirit you be a leader you always want
[1:14:08] to be a leader be a leader
[1:14:09] the supernatural things pray first seek
[1:14:12] God believe God's were getting the
[1:14:14] spirits are a mending the word start
[1:14:16] agreeing with the word start supporting
[1:14:18] the word and watch your spiritual
[1:14:20] experience change amen faith comes by
[1:14:24] hearing
[1:14:26] brother Bram said the highest office in
[1:14:28] the world is a minister of the gospel
[1:14:29] there's no higher office not president
[1:14:31] not Republican not Democrat not House
[1:14:34] Speaker of the House the highest office
[1:14:37] in the world is a preacher now they're
[1:14:41] under the most responsibility as well
[1:14:44] right we have to be most we're stewards
[1:14:47] of the mysteries of God we handle the
[1:14:49] mysteries of God and we'll have to
[1:14:51] answer for everything we preach is that
[1:14:53] right so while we're given the highest
[1:14:55] office we have the highest amount of
[1:14:56] responsibility that's why I'm so glad
[1:14:59] when people grab ahold of the word
[1:15:01] that's preached and they see the miracle
[1:15:03] of God in their life hallelujah that's a
[1:15:06] true blessing that means we followed the
[1:15:08] leadership of the Holy Spirit that means
[1:15:10] the preacher found it the congregation
[1:15:12] found it we all followed the Holy
[1:15:14] Spirit's desire that's what we long to
[1:15:17] see Church hallelujah now we read
[1:15:23] Hebrews four to so see you got to mix
[1:15:25] the preaching with faith mix the
[1:15:28] preaching with faith with thus saith the
[1:15:30] Lord I'm receiving that as thus saith
[1:15:32] the Lord if we don't act upon it then it
[1:15:34] wasn't faith if that with the word
[1:15:36] preached today doesn't change our lives
[1:15:38] it'll have no impact on your life and
[1:15:40] then you didn't even mix it with faith
[1:15:42] you just mix it with a church membership
[1:15:44] church attendance you say we're both yes
[1:15:49] I'm not a preacher you don't have to be
[1:15:51] you can be a prayer warrior your prayer
[1:15:55] warrior is just as important as the
[1:15:57] preaching the preaching will accomplish
[1:15:59] nothing if you and I are praying do you
[1:16:01] understand church you have romancin we
[1:16:04] have to pray the blessings down without
[1:16:06] prayer there's no power because there's
[1:16:09] no sincerity praise God
[1:16:14] amen remember the first
[1:16:17] services we came the message you're
[1:16:18] always excited to hear something new
[1:16:20] right you came with expectation you're
[1:16:22] praying you're reading your Bible all
[1:16:23] the time
[1:16:24] well what happened you stopped reading
[1:16:25] your Bible and pray no hallelujah that's
[1:16:30] right
[1:16:30] that's why preachers can come in here on
[1:16:32] Sunday all pumped up filled with the
[1:16:34] Spirit has God's word burning in your
[1:16:36] heart to preach but if the people aren't
[1:16:38] in the same condition it'll just fall to
[1:16:40] the ground and it won't take any effect
[1:16:42] it's got to take effect upon lives but
[1:16:44] to get in the spirit you have to pray
[1:16:46] first and you have to obey the Word of
[1:16:48] God it's exactly right but we know we're
[1:16:53] under the the the Battle of the the love
[1:16:57] of many shall wax cold how many know
[1:16:58] that's in the scripture let's go that's
[1:17:00] go to Matthew 24:12 Matthew 24:12 this
[1:17:06] is the spirit we're fighting this
[1:17:09] lukewarm compromising spirit that's the
[1:17:13] spirit we're fighting the spirit of
[1:17:14] Antichrist
[1:17:22] look at verse
[1:17:24] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[1:17:25] men we have that today big-name TV
[1:17:28] preachers their prophesy honest I see it
[1:17:30] all the time they prophesy that it's so
[1:17:31] broad or nothing and it never comes to
[1:17:33] pass it's just all this prophecy I'm a
[1:17:36] prophet let me speak the word upon you
[1:17:38] let me do all this nonsense look at
[1:17:41] verse 12 and because iniquity shall
[1:17:43] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:17:47] that's the our living in a cold
[1:17:50] spiritual time and you feel it and I
[1:17:52] feel it it feels so cold it's so hard to
[1:17:55] want to pray it's so hard to wanna raise
[1:17:57] your hands and pray we've got to press
[1:17:59] beyond that that's our battle we've got
[1:18:01] to press through and the way you do that
[1:18:04] is by praying and loving God and loving
[1:18:06] his people mother bear said the joy of a
[1:18:10] Christian is serving God at the house of
[1:18:12] the Lord and I wonder how many people
[1:18:15] believe that message most people say
[1:18:17] that say they believe the message don't
[1:18:18] actually believe the message because if
[1:18:19] they did they'd do what the message said
[1:18:21] it's exactly right because the Knik when
[1:18:25] he see it they start letting the
[1:18:26] compromise with little compromise it's
[1:18:28] just a little bit here a little bit
[1:18:29] there a little bit there then their love
[1:18:31] wax is cold instead of loving the people
[1:18:35] of God more they love them less and I
[1:18:38] wonder why God's not moving in their
[1:18:39] life more it's because they let iniquity
[1:18:42] in their lives and now they don't love
[1:18:44] people anymore and how do you know
[1:18:47] somebody loves you they'll tell you the
[1:18:48] truth
[1:18:50] hallelujah they'll tell you the truth
[1:18:53] that's how you know they love you that's
[1:18:57] right church that's exactly right amen
[1:19:01] to that brother Ram says this believe
[1:19:05] it's now this 1950 faith cometh by
[1:19:11] hearing hearing of the word that's what
[1:19:13] gives us faith before we can have faith
[1:19:14] we must have a basis for faith he said
[1:19:17] if I was going to get married and your
[1:19:19] wife would tell you that she would love
[1:19:21] you and how she'd be true to you you
[1:19:23] have her word then and then your faith
[1:19:25] it just depends on how you feel about it
[1:19:27] if her word is alright or not and that's
[1:19:30] the way we have to do anyway by faith we
[1:19:33] have to have the background of
[1:19:34] foundation and that's God's Word
[1:19:37] I know your wife and husbands gonna stay
[1:19:39] true to you they gave you their word
[1:19:40] you're trusting in their word I'd know
[1:19:43] God's gonna answer his prayer he always
[1:19:45] keeps his word he'll answer your prayer
[1:19:47] because he's always keeps his word
[1:19:50] you have to have a basis upon your faith
[1:19:54] well Bram said we are not saved by
[1:19:57] experiences nor by fasting nor by prayer
[1:19:59] there's one way we're saved that's faith
[1:20:01] through the word faith cometh by hearing
[1:20:02] hearing by the Word of God now the only
[1:20:05] thing that God could do to make his word
[1:20:07] real is to get some good preacher who
[1:20:09] can preach the word he said that's the
[1:20:12] official and initial way that faith
[1:20:14] comes by hearing hearing by the Word of
[1:20:17] God God said how can I get somebody to
[1:20:19] believe my word I'll give I'll give him
[1:20:21] a good solid gospel preacher hey man
[1:20:25] that's God's only way to try to get the
[1:20:28] people to have faith it's to send him a
[1:20:30] gospel preacher Easter program says the
[1:20:32] preaching that saves us look what he
[1:20:35] says next and law or grace 1954 but
[1:20:42] abandoned aux about how God is not in
[1:20:43] the big churches with the pipe organs
[1:20:45] and all the millions of thousand dollars
[1:20:47] they spend he said he's on he said but
[1:20:49] you'll get God in some little old
[1:20:51] mission somewhere you know you might
[1:20:53] find a whole lot up there you know some
[1:20:55] more spiritual vitamins God has got them
[1:20:58] for you to help your spirit up to pep
[1:21:01] you up a little
[1:21:01] that's the preaching of the gospel
[1:21:04] listen if the preaching won't pep up the
[1:21:07] church there's nothing that will see why
[1:21:13] people get nothing out of church they
[1:21:14] don't agree with the word they don't mix
[1:21:16] the preaching with faith they don't
[1:21:18] believe what the preacher saying so they
[1:21:19] get nothing out of church there's no
[1:21:21] other way to get something out of church
[1:21:22] than to agree with the Word of God and
[1:21:26] if I'm off the word you meet me in there
[1:21:28] afterwards and we get it straightened
[1:21:29] out but I haven't had anybody do that so
[1:21:31] I must be right on the Word of God well
[1:21:34] somebody has a spirit of fear right
[1:21:36] they're scared to talk about it
[1:21:38] so they have a spirit of fear on them
[1:21:40] but as far as I know by the Jose the
[1:21:42] holy spirit hasn't convicted me of
[1:21:43] anything I preached wrong amen and if
[1:21:46] I'm wrong you meet me in there so Bram
[1:21:48] said if I'm wrong he said you meet me in
[1:21:50] the room after
[1:21:50] let's talk about it in private
[1:21:53] hallelujah
[1:21:54] show me one time I didn't quote the
[1:21:55] Prophet or show me one time it wasn't
[1:21:57] the word we are hearing the word of God
[1:21:59] but we've got to believe it you're
[1:22:01] hearing it I'm hearing it but we've got
[1:22:03] to believe it like I said a few months
[1:22:05] ago I was getting sick I was preaching
[1:22:06] on the spoken word remember that I was
[1:22:08] getting sick I told to the church in my
[1:22:09] stomach I felt like I was gonna throw up
[1:22:11] and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:22:13] said this mountain of sickness is gonna
[1:22:14] move in a matter of 5 minutes I was
[1:22:17] happy again no sickness at all what is
[1:22:19] that it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:20] yesterday today and forever amen I had
[1:22:24] to take that from the sermon and believe
[1:22:26] it I wasn't feeling like it for the amen
[1:22:28] I wasn't feeling good but I had to
[1:22:30] decide am I gonna believe the word or am
[1:22:32] I gonna believe my symptoms I believe
[1:22:34] the word and God showed up on the scene
[1:22:36] your choice you're either gonna mix this
[1:22:39] preaching with unbelief or gonna mix it
[1:22:41] with faith I say let's mix it with faith
[1:22:43] I'm trying to minister miracles I'm
[1:22:45] trying to minister healing I'm trying to
[1:22:47] minister salvation those that aren't
[1:22:48] saved in baptized I'm trying to minister
[1:22:50] sanctification to people
[1:22:52] but see the people all of us have to be
[1:22:54] in the spirit of agreement we have to
[1:22:56] agree with that word we have to accept
[1:22:57] that word and say that's mine if the
[1:23:01] preaching won't pep you up
[1:23:02] nothing will you can say why don't you
[1:23:05] play tapes lesson that's not God's way
[1:23:07] to do it God never put a tape on and
[1:23:10] said God never put a tape and said well
[1:23:12] well we're not have any live preachers
[1:23:13] God always had a live preacher I'm
[1:23:16] saying exactly what the tapes say anyway
[1:23:19] I'm preaching by the Rams message the
[1:23:22] thing is you're not ready to hear or
[1:23:23] people aren't ready to hear because
[1:23:25] they're not praying beforehand they're
[1:23:26] hungrier for things of the world than
[1:23:28] they are for God people need to repent
[1:23:30] and get right with God amen then the
[1:23:33] Word of God starts having an impact on
[1:23:35] their lives
[1:23:36] if preaching doesn't help it pop you up
[1:23:40] he said nothing will because that's
[1:23:43] God's Way God sent five gifts and I'm
[1:23:45] gonna make my church perfect I'm
[1:23:47] bringing them into perfection by these
[1:23:48] five gifts that's all I'm doing and the
[1:23:50] people have a choice well that's great
[1:23:51] or they are either mix it with unbelief
[1:23:53] or they'll say hallelujah praise God
[1:23:56] Amen Church the Bramson fight
[1:24:01] tonight if I could heal every person
[1:24:02] here and I have no power to do that he
[1:24:04] said I have no power to do that the only
[1:24:06] way a minister could do that is by
[1:24:07] preaching the word so by me coming back
[1:24:11] every service to preach to you it shows
[1:24:13] that I want you to be healed it shows I
[1:24:16] want you to be filled the Holy Ghost I
[1:24:17] want to be sanctified I want you to be
[1:24:18] free from any habit just by coming back
[1:24:20] here that shows you that I'm interested
[1:24:23] in God's Word coming to you now you've
[1:24:25] got to show your part and show that
[1:24:27] you're interested in receiving God's
[1:24:28] Word if I was off and on again well as
[1:24:31] brother just coming tonight on Wednesday
[1:24:32] night
[1:24:33] sometimes I've been late and sometimes
[1:24:34] people say well are you coming or not
[1:24:36] that's cuz I got meetings but you watch
[1:24:38] my life the last 11 and a half years I'm
[1:24:40] here every single time unless I'm dead
[1:24:42] sick at home because I'm that interested
[1:24:45] in you receiving the Word of God because
[1:24:48] that's the only way I can help you is by
[1:24:49] preaching God's Word to you but you have
[1:24:52] to be able to receive it as well I've
[1:24:54] walked out of here twice completely
[1:24:56] healed nothing I came in sick I walked
[1:24:58] out completely well what does that faith
[1:25:00] comes by hearing hearing the Word of God
[1:25:05] see we have a responsibility Church we
[1:25:08] forget sometimes the power of the
[1:25:09] preaching of the word don't we we forget
[1:25:13] the power the man said get the sick and
[1:25:19] afflicted here he says how can they be
[1:25:22] healed unless they're here to see it
[1:25:24] faith comes by hearing hearing the Word
[1:25:26] of God praise the Lord if you want to be
[1:25:29] healed you've got to come to church
[1:25:31] sometimes when you're sick you've got to
[1:25:33] because faith will rise when you hear
[1:25:36] the word of God glory you have to make a
[1:25:40] sacrifice you have to sign am i mixing
[1:25:41] this preaching with unbelief or faith am
[1:25:43] I going to be discouraged am I gonna be
[1:25:45] resenting the preacher or am I gonna
[1:25:46] accept that as God's Word if it's in the
[1:25:48] Bible it's God's Word amen like we saw
[1:25:52] Karen healed we saw a Marie healed
[1:25:54] praise God
[1:25:54] we see all these people healed because
[1:25:57] they have faith they're believing the
[1:25:58] preaching they're not sitting there
[1:26:00] upset they're not sitting there
[1:26:01] discouraged or oppress or depressed or
[1:26:03] angry they're sitting there enjoying
[1:26:06] God's Word
[1:26:07] loving every word amen it's exactly
[1:26:11] right
[1:26:13] you know brother Aaron said the
[1:26:15] Apostolic way of holding a meeting is
[1:26:16] you already said the way is this is a
[1:26:19] 1950 said listen the apostolic way of
[1:26:22] holding a meeting and this is what I do
[1:26:24] every service the Apostolic way of
[1:26:27] holding a meeting is to be preaching
[1:26:29] seeing what God is doing and then
[1:26:32] speaking it out where you find faith men
[1:26:36] and women to have faith in God and
[1:26:39] believe in God and God will grant it to
[1:26:41] them did you catch that
[1:26:44] did you catch that Loran so the only way
[1:26:46] to have an apostolic Holy Ghost meeting
[1:26:48] like the day of Pentecost is to preach
[1:26:50] it and find somebody that believes
[1:26:52] that's all I try to do every service my
[1:26:55] wife knows that find someone that will
[1:26:56] believe me because it's not me it's
[1:26:58] God's Word and Paul said preachers come
[1:27:01] to minister miracles to people but if
[1:27:04] they don't mix the hearing of the word
[1:27:06] with faith it don't profit them nothing
[1:27:08] coming to church doesn't mean nothing
[1:27:09] it's because of their own unbelief it's
[1:27:12] becoming because of their dull ears but
[1:27:14] we didn't have ears that are circumcised
[1:27:16] we have to believe God's Word amen
[1:27:19] hallelujah have to mix the word with
[1:27:25] faith but to have faith you got to
[1:27:26] praying it under expectation first
[1:27:28] prayer comes first brother BAM said the
[1:27:39] only thing that keeps you from being
[1:27:40] well this morning is a spirit hanging
[1:27:43] over you I'm gonna read that again I
[1:27:47] said it earlier if someone has a bad
[1:27:49] attitude they got a demon power on them
[1:27:51] and they won't receive the Word of God
[1:27:54] they're hindering the move of the Holy
[1:27:55] Spirit right here in the church the only
[1:27:58] thing that keeps you from being well
[1:27:59] this morning is the spirit hanging over
[1:28:01] you that won't fully let you go out
[1:28:04] yonder and believe God's promised that
[1:28:06] he's already done it how many want to
[1:28:10] believe God's Word if you don't
[1:28:14] even you have to recognize there's a
[1:28:16] spirit hanging over me it's doubt or
[1:28:18] it's fear or its bitterness or its
[1:28:21] unforgiveness or something that's anger
[1:28:23] or lust or something or greed or some
[1:28:25] Spears hanging over you
[1:28:27] you've got to confess that spirit then
[1:28:29] the spirit gets exposed and Satan hates
[1:28:31] to be exposed and when they're exposing
[1:28:34] and you cast it off and say I'm no
[1:28:36] longer gonna think this I'm no longer
[1:28:38] going to obey this that spirit has to go
[1:28:40] and then God sunshine can shine down
[1:28:43] upon you and you can receive the word of
[1:28:45] faith amen
[1:28:46] exactly right here I go amen
[1:28:49] thank the Lord Jesus exactly right I
[1:28:53] know what I'm talking about that's why
[1:28:57] when I get in the spirit and go other
[1:28:58] places and hear when people get in the
[1:28:59] spirit that's why we see miracles
[1:29:00] because I'm sent to bring you the Word
[1:29:03] of God I didn't come to Akron I don't
[1:29:06] even know there was an Akron God sent me
[1:29:08] to Akron and I'm here to minister God's
[1:29:10] Word that's my purpose in life but the
[1:29:13] word preach must be mixed with faith
[1:29:15] amen Brian Hawkins was a minister of
[1:29:19] supernatural remember Mary Ellen was
[1:29:21] sitting right there I was here on a
[1:29:22] Sunday morning I remember that service
[1:29:24] brother Brian preach just to Mary Ellen
[1:29:27] had told me out there and then in the
[1:29:28] vestibule what everyone called the
[1:29:30] hallway it's not really the best of you
[1:29:31] are too small to be a vestibule she told
[1:29:35] me on the hallway there the previous
[1:29:36] Wednesday she said well Jessie I fell at
[1:29:39] home and my my tailbone is numb I can
[1:29:41] hardly walk she Wednesday night she
[1:29:44] walked into Church here Sunday morning
[1:29:48] come brother Brian Hawkins is preaching
[1:29:50] he just preached on the line of the
[1:29:51] tribe of Judah how many remember that
[1:29:52] sermon I remember that sermon the Lion
[1:29:55] of the tribe of Judah she just comes up
[1:29:58] here for prayer brother Brian just says
[1:30:01] a simple prayer he doesn't scream
[1:30:02] doesn't cry doesn't shout like I do or
[1:30:04] maybe other people might but I've seen
[1:30:06] God heal people when I scream and shout
[1:30:07] and he prays for her she tells me the
[1:30:11] next one is she oh brother Jesse I
[1:30:13] forgot to tell you she said after he
[1:30:15] prayed for me I sat down and the pain
[1:30:17] instantly vanished she had it for what
[1:30:19] Monday Tuesday about six days brother
[1:30:22] Brian was a minister of America
[1:30:27] the doctor couldn't do it nobody could
[1:30:29] heal it but Jesus Christ healed it see
[1:30:32] that's what we're sent we're sent to be
[1:30:34] carriers of miracles I'm trying to work
[1:30:36] miracles but I got to get this cloud
[1:30:38] it's hanging over you right the cloud
[1:30:41] that hangs over trying to get that out
[1:30:42] of the way so you can just simply
[1:30:44] believe God's Word amen that's all we're
[1:30:46] trying to do preachers can do no more
[1:30:51] than preach the word but a man said the
[1:30:53] believer must have faith the RAM said
[1:30:58] praise heavenly Father I pray you'll
[1:30:59] bless them and give them eternal life
[1:31:00] right now there's nothing I could do I
[1:31:02] can call them to the altar put them in
[1:31:04] extra room doing all the work it takes
[1:31:05] to do it Lord we can't do no more than
[1:31:07] preach the word you said faith comes by
[1:31:09] hearing hearing the word now we preach
[1:31:12] the word and they've raised their hands
[1:31:14] that believe it now give them
[1:31:16] everlasting life you promised you would
[1:31:17] if they were sincere and raising their
[1:31:20] hands they'll go out of this building
[1:31:22] this morning a sweet meek humble
[1:31:25] Christian because you promised it and
[1:31:27] your words cannot fail that's all I can
[1:31:31] do is preach God's Word all I can do is
[1:31:33] try to get in the Holy Spirit let the
[1:31:35] Holy Spirit use me preach against all
[1:31:37] sin try to get all these spirits hanging
[1:31:39] over people try to get them out of the
[1:31:40] church so that God can move the Spirit
[1:31:43] of God can out pray in our church amen
[1:31:45] that's all I'm trying to do 411 half
[1:31:47] years and I'll keep doing it by God's
[1:31:49] grace I know who sent me I know what he
[1:31:53] called me to do it's exactly right now I
[1:32:01] got a few minutes here I promised myself
[1:32:03] I wouldn't go too far help me Jesus help
[1:32:06] me help me Jesus let me do this let me
[1:32:11] read this quote I got a long quote for
[1:32:13] you if from 1964 questions and answers
[1:32:15] this is a good a good quote I want you
[1:32:17] to pay attention if you can try to hang
[1:32:19] on dear brother Branham is it possible
[1:32:23] for one to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:25] Ghost and not to have signs following it
[1:32:30] at least not until some
[1:32:32] your time and conditions appointed by
[1:32:35] the Holy Spirit
[1:32:36] Oh ma'am said that's a really good
[1:32:38] question he says now the persons asking
[1:32:43] about the baptism Holy Ghost without
[1:32:44] signs following them
[1:32:45] he said now I'm going to answer this in
[1:32:48] a real juvenile way but if you're a
[1:32:50] normal human being
[1:32:51] you'll actually do the things that
[1:32:52] normal human beings would do he said
[1:32:57] when you're born to human the natural
[1:32:58] traits of the human being follow you he
[1:33:01] said well then that's when you're born a
[1:33:03] Christian born of the Spirit of God you
[1:33:05] naturally take up the attributes of
[1:33:07] Christ so he's saying they're asking
[1:33:13] will science always follow believers and
[1:33:14] he goes there's a child well if you have
[1:33:16] a normal child they're gonna pretty soon
[1:33:18] talk around two years old around one
[1:33:21] give or take a few weeks or months if
[1:33:23] they're a natural child they'll do
[1:33:26] natural things about Ram said if you're
[1:33:27] a natural born again Holy Ghost child
[1:33:29] then the signs will follow your life Oh
[1:33:32] hallelujah he says you have to watch
[1:33:36] these things because the Christian takes
[1:33:38] up the habits of a Christian for they
[1:33:42] men mentioned the word habit to me
[1:33:43] recently he said and they live like a
[1:33:47] Christian Jesus says these signs shall
[1:33:49] follow them that believe in my name
[1:33:51] shall they cast out devils to take up
[1:33:52] serpents drink deadly things they'll
[1:33:54] speak with new tongues and then things
[1:33:56] just actually follow Christians that's
[1:33:58] why I rejoice when sister Naomi speaks
[1:34:00] in tongues because they follow believers
[1:34:02] approves over believers I believe in
[1:34:05] speaking in tongues it's sharing the
[1:34:06] evidence but it sure is God speaking to
[1:34:08] us when we pray for the interpretation
[1:34:13] prays to the heart now the person has a
[1:34:17] very good thing here or do we wait into
[1:34:19] the future time or the conditions
[1:34:21] appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that
[1:34:23] he said when it's appointed by the Holy
[1:34:25] Spirit God appoints things so brother
[1:34:28] Ham likes that every born-again
[1:34:30] Christian will have signs but it's at
[1:34:32] God's appointed time how many like that
[1:34:36] my brother have said when you're filled
[1:34:38] with the spirit here's one of the best
[1:34:39] signs I know listen you're so in love
[1:34:42] with Christ and believe every word he
[1:34:45] says to be the truth
[1:34:49] that's the evidence if you have the holy
[1:34:51] spirit your life's full of joy and oh my
[1:34:53] everything is different than what it
[1:34:55] used to be that's the Holy Spirit let me
[1:34:59] read this next part here and hold on to
[1:35:01] your seats make sure this doesn't blow
[1:35:02] you out of your chair
[1:35:06] jesus said a brother has to notice if
[1:35:08] every person in here was in perfectly
[1:35:10] harmony with the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:12] everyone he was filled with the Holy
[1:35:14] Ghost in harmony with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:16] then these signs would just be
[1:35:18] multiplying among you all the time
[1:35:23] did anybody catch that if everybody in
[1:35:27] here had the Holy Ghost well Graham said
[1:35:29] if I ask everybody raise your hand got
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost he said 95% of hands that
[1:35:32] go up he said but if everybody's in one
[1:35:35] accord with the Holy Ghost these signs
[1:35:38] will be multiplying all the time
[1:35:40] they go from Amen to brother Adam to me
[1:35:42] to my wife to Jose to our sisters our
[1:35:44] brothers they just be multiplied if
[1:35:46] we're all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:48] we're all in harmony with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:51] do you believe that how many believe
[1:35:54] that part of the message I know a lot of
[1:35:55] people say they under maybe that part of
[1:35:57] the message if we're in harmony and
[1:36:01] filled with the Holy Ghost these things
[1:36:03] would just multiply among us hallelujah
[1:36:08] the greatest multiplication of signs
[1:36:10] miracles I saw was from 2010 it's about
[1:36:13] well now I guess I could say because
[1:36:16] every time I go someplace and people are
[1:36:17] filled the Holy Ghost sir sometimes
[1:36:18] somebody gets real in the spirit hear
[1:36:20] gottle do America because one day
[1:36:23] brother John and I prayed at the altar
[1:36:25] for 45 minutes that God would send
[1:36:27] miracles and gods are doing it right
[1:36:28] after that I remember that was a Sunday
[1:36:31] evening service I remember that in 2010
[1:36:37] so I want you to know
[1:36:38] if everybody in here has the Holy Ghost
[1:36:41] and yet we're not seeing it multiply
[1:36:44] then that means we're out of harmony
[1:36:45] with the Holy Ghost but if we're not
[1:36:48] seeing it multiply then that means some
[1:36:51] people don't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:36:52] that's okay because we know where to get
[1:36:54] it it comes from Jesus amen
[1:36:56] he's the Good Samaritan he's got the oil
[1:36:58] in behind a man he'll pour it in but you
[1:37:00] gotta lay there and let him pour it in
[1:37:02] amen hallelujah like lay on the altar
[1:37:06] praise God like lay in your prayer
[1:37:09] closet
[1:37:11] hallelujah remember I don't follow the
[1:37:14] signs the signs follow me right when you
[1:37:19] go places when you pray God the signs
[1:37:21] follow you they follow you wherever you
[1:37:24] go that's where they go but where am
[1:37:28] said the groups that believe the whole
[1:37:30] nature the Holy Spirit flows through
[1:37:32] them and they're all full of love and
[1:37:34] joy and a great bundle of godly filled
[1:37:37] people that's the Holy Spirit how many
[1:37:41] want to be full of love and joy and a
[1:37:44] bundle of godly filled person I'm gonna
[1:37:46] be that that's what our church is to be
[1:37:49] and I know don't I'm not trying to
[1:37:51] discourage anybody but church but I know
[1:37:52] this is where we're going this is the
[1:37:55] vision of the church whoever comes
[1:37:56] whoever stays never goes it doesn't
[1:37:58] matter because we're living under the
[1:38:00] prophecy that the latter rain will be
[1:38:03] poured out upon this bride and I believe
[1:38:06] I'm a part of that bride and I believe
[1:38:07] it's gonna be poured out on me amen
[1:38:10] because I'm separating myself from all
[1:38:13] the things of the world and I'm clinging
[1:38:15] to Jesus Christ
[1:38:16] I'm not decreasing my love for Christ or
[1:38:19] my service or dedication to Christ I'm
[1:38:21] increasing it I'm not preaching less I'm
[1:38:25] preaching more I'm not going to church
[1:38:27] less I'm going to church more I'm not
[1:38:30] praying less I'm praying more praise God
[1:38:31] are you with me
[1:38:33] that's what it's gonna take it's gonna
[1:38:35] take a life a lamp that's trimmed and
[1:38:37] clean he says oh my
[1:38:44] now if the whole church should work in
[1:38:45] harmony like that then among us we'd be
[1:38:47] casting out Devils taking up serpents
[1:38:50] drinking deadly things all kinds of
[1:38:52] things going on see that we would see
[1:38:55] mark 16 more often if everybody's felt
[1:38:57] the Holy Ghost don't feel bad if you
[1:38:59] don't see him just get filled with the
[1:39:00] Holy Ghost or if you are filled with
[1:39:02] Holy Ghost just say praise God it's
[1:39:03] gonna happen sometime I'll just keep
[1:39:06] fouling the word I'll just keep saying
[1:39:07] in harmony with the Holy Spirit
[1:39:09] whenever the Holy Spirit preaches I'll
[1:39:11] say Amen I'll mix it with faith I'll
[1:39:14] obey the Word of God if we want to see
[1:39:16] God we got to draw close to God we can't
[1:39:19] draw away from God expect God to move
[1:39:21] the Bible says you've you draw nigh to
[1:39:22] him he'll do what the draw nigh to you
[1:39:28] he says oh he says our hearts are full
[1:39:32] of joy and happiness and oh my the birds
[1:39:34] are singing if you like that he said
[1:39:37] everything's wonderful my just full of
[1:39:40] the Spirit of God and we're so in love
[1:39:42] with Jesus we wanted to pray all night
[1:39:43] now there we go there we got a good test
[1:39:47] right there we want to pray all night we
[1:39:50] want to pray all day we're so in love
[1:39:51] with Jesus we just want to talk to him
[1:39:53] all day I don't appreciate this quote
[1:40:02] this is why as I study the message
[1:40:04] church you just have to trust me I study
[1:40:06] the message we have to go higher in
[1:40:09] Christ we can't pull back from our
[1:40:12] devotion to Christ because this is what
[1:40:15] the real Holy Ghost will produce right
[1:40:16] here never understand that program says
[1:40:21] if you really got the Holy Ghost
[1:40:22] everybody has a Holy Ghost here the
[1:40:23] signs of just keep multiplying see from
[1:40:25] one family to that family that family
[1:40:27] that family that family defin it just
[1:40:29] keep multiplying because they're in
[1:40:30] harmony with the Holy Spirit and the
[1:40:32] Holy Spirit is operating in their lives
[1:40:37] hallelujah my brother Graham said
[1:40:44] I've got to get the church out of
[1:40:46] babyhood and get them into manhood so I
[1:40:51] would say like this you you think about
[1:40:52] our church are we in babyhood where
[1:40:54] there's not much move with Holy Spirit
[1:40:55] or we in manhood where it's multiplying
[1:40:57] well Ram said when the signs and wonders
[1:40:59] are multiplying
[1:41:00] he said you're in spiritual manhood hey
[1:41:05] what what do you see in your life you
[1:41:06] see the song signs multiplying praise
[1:41:09] God I'm glad I do I'm glad I see that
[1:41:12] when people believe what I'm preaching
[1:41:15] and they're in the spirit God moves why
[1:41:17] because it's God's Way it's the only way
[1:41:19] to pump pep somebody up by the RAM said
[1:41:21] is to believe the preaching of the word
[1:41:22] of God
[1:41:23] if that doesn't pump you up nothing else
[1:41:25] will because the Word of God is life I
[1:41:28] said the Word of God is life its life
[1:41:32] it's eternal life I'm preaching God's
[1:41:37] eternal word of life but you've got a
[1:41:40] receipt we got to receive it or else
[1:41:43] it's not mixed with faith and our ears
[1:41:46] will be so heavy oh he's preaching on
[1:41:48] that again he's preaching on the Holy
[1:41:50] Ghost again I'm trying to preach the
[1:41:51] ticket to the rapture that's why I'm
[1:41:52] preaching on the Holy Ghost I'm trying
[1:41:55] to get people in the rapture God sent me
[1:41:57] to preach to get people in their rapture
[1:41:59] amen cuz I don't have a Wesley message I
[1:42:02] don't have a sir I'm more than a saint
[1:42:03] vacation message I don't have a Assembly
[1:42:05] of God message that's speaking in
[1:42:06] tongues
[1:42:07] I've got beyond that I'm trying to get
[1:42:09] the heavenly tongue amen
[1:42:11] or you'll meet Jesus in there and say
[1:42:13] hallelujah Jesus I long to see you I
[1:42:15] look upon your face let's go to the
[1:42:17] wedding marriage supper than I am that's
[1:42:20] what my message is that's brother Rams
[1:42:22] message that we preach the supernatural
[1:42:24] rapture let's send our feet I want to
[1:42:27] read one scripture Hebrews five it's
[1:42:28] close to this here's one way you know
[1:42:33] you're dull of hearing Hebrews chapter
[1:42:36] five Hebrews chapter
[1:42:44] five I didn't get to all this I didn't
[1:42:46] get hardly anything like I thought I
[1:42:47] would but that's okay
[1:42:48] Hebrews chapter five I don't know about
[1:42:55] you Church but I pray almost every
[1:42:57] service for God to do miracles almost
[1:42:58] every service many times I'll pray for
[1:43:00] your families I'll walk them down these
[1:43:02] roads and pray for your families I'll
[1:43:03] say God give them a revival God fill
[1:43:05] them with the Holy Ghost God bless their
[1:43:07] families and meet all their needs I'm
[1:43:11] constantly praying for supernatural why
[1:43:13] cuz that's my duty that's what I'm
[1:43:16] called to do and I know it operates when
[1:43:18] people just believe the Word of God I
[1:43:19] know it operates no one has to tell me
[1:43:21] that but see I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:43:24] the Apostolic way and find somebody that
[1:43:26] believes me out here every preacher does
[1:43:29] that trying to find someone that will
[1:43:31] believe the preacher it's exactly right
[1:43:34] we must mix faith with the Word of God
[1:43:37] that's being preached oh it's so true so
[1:43:41] true Hebrews chapter 5 this is a worship
[1:43:46] series this is the best way to worship
[1:43:49] is to pray first get in the spirit hear
[1:43:51] the word of God then you want to worship
[1:43:52] because you receive God's word no one
[1:43:55] has to beg you to worship no one has to
[1:43:56] pump you up the Word of God already
[1:43:58] pumped you up praise God the Word of God
[1:44:02] already pumps you up
[1:44:04] Hebrews five now verse 10 called of God
[1:44:10] a high priest after the order of
[1:44:11] Melchizedek of whom we have many things
[1:44:13] to say and hard to be uttered seeing
[1:44:15] you're dull of hearing so Paul is saying
[1:44:18] I really would like to teach you more
[1:44:19] about Melchizedek and if you read on he
[1:44:20] does in Chapter seven he does but before
[1:44:24] he breaks in to Melchizedek he's gonna
[1:44:25] lay this out how do you know someone's
[1:44:30] dull of hearing they're not what they're
[1:44:32] supposed to be in the eyes of God God
[1:44:36] has called them to be more than what
[1:44:38] they are that's how you know someone is
[1:44:40] dull of hearing they're not where
[1:44:44] they're supposed to be spiritually in
[1:44:46] other words they're out of place look at
[1:44:48] verse 12 for when for when for the time
[1:44:51] he ought to be teachers you have need
[1:44:55] that one teach you again
[1:44:58] which be the first principles of the
[1:44:59] Oracles of God and our become such as
[1:45:05] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[1:45:10] verse 13 for everyone that everyone that
[1:45:13] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:45:16] righteousness for he's a babe but strong
[1:45:20] meat belongeth to them that are full age
[1:45:22] even those by reason of use have their
[1:45:25] senses exercised to discern both good
[1:45:28] and evil
[1:45:30] I wonder if we just would bow our heads
[1:45:34] for a moment I wonder are we everything
[1:45:38] we ought to be let's just real let's
[1:45:40] examine our lives real close now I
[1:45:43] wonder if someone here ought teachers
[1:45:47] ought to be prayer warriors ought to be
[1:45:50] doing some or some specials off to be
[1:45:54] praying at the altar is there something
[1:45:58] you ought to be doing but you're not not
[1:46:01] help us today for the scripture tells us
[1:46:06] our ears have become dull and can't
[1:46:08] receive revelation when we should be
[1:46:11] something but we're not that how they do
[1:46:18] thank you Jesus with our heads bowed
[1:46:35] think about that a moment are you
[1:46:39] everything you ought to be
[1:46:41] [Music]

[1:47:35] God restored in the latter rain you know
[1:47:36] the bride is going back to that she's
[1:47:39] going back to Pentecost and the fullness
[1:47:41] of Pentecost maybe in the variety that's
[1:47:43] the take place Lord we have to hear the
[1:47:46] word from faith cometh by hearing
[1:47:48] hearing the Word of God well I just pray
[1:47:53] now for your people Lord these are your
[1:47:54] children I'm not gonna ask them to raise
[1:47:56] their hands today Lord I do that all the
[1:47:57] time
