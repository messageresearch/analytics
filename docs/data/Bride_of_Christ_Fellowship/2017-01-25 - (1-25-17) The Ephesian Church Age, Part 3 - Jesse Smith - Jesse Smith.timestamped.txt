[29:40] this uh series I imagine this will be a
[29:42] long series but uh if you read the
[29:45] church age book it's a long book and
[29:47] it's a good glorious book and you will
[29:49] be a more mature Christian for reading
[29:51] that book I guarantee that with all
[29:54] that's within me with all my heart I
[29:57] believe that why do you say that brother
[29:58] Jess because that's the first book I
[30:00] read when I became a Christian a message
[30:03] believer amen and this book is settled
[30:06] Us in the faith can you imagine if a
[30:09] prophet worked four years on one book
[30:12] what would he accomplish that's what we
[30:14] have by God's grace it's a prophet's
[30:17] commentary on the Bible uh the first uh
[30:20] three chapters of the Book of Revelation

[30:46] hungry and sincere for the word of God
[30:49] it it's just quite humbling I was quite

[33:24] being here tonight by the grace of the
[33:25] lord we appreciate brother Gaye being
[33:26] here I got a to listen to both the
[33:28] sermons from Sunday they're really good
[33:30] by God's grace so I'm going to preach a
[33:31] little follow up on Sunday Lord willing
[33:34] I'm going to follow up with a little
[33:35] more pastor preaching about that because
[33:38] I really enjoyed that what a wonderful
[33:40] what what wonderful messages that he
[33:42] brought there very some of those things
[33:44] I've written down I could show you I
[33:45] written down I want to preach on some of
[33:46] those things uh I could show you that uh
[33:49] so but I'm very thankful you know God
[33:50] knows just what we have need of and it's
[33:52] nice for you to hear it from somebody
[33:54] else somebody different preaching the
[33:57] same thing praise God so I know that's a
[33:59] real help I know that's a blessing to
[34:01] you and a real blessing to me um and uh
[34:06] just we're really looking forward to
[34:08] what the Lord's going to do in our midst
[34:09] amen we're happy to have uh Stephanie
[34:11] here tonight let's give her a round
[34:12] Applause praise God good to see her by
[34:15] God's grace
[34:16] amen appreciate her amen and let's uh if
[34:19] we can let's just get into this thought
[34:21] here the Ephesian Church Age part three
[34:23] now I think I have part four on the
[34:24] website but it's actually part three
[34:26] tonight uh by God's grace so Mali if
[34:30] you'd like to switch that over whenever
[34:31] you're ready let's look at this here and
[34:33] we're going to look at Jesus's message
[34:35] uh to the Ephesian Church
[34:38] age like I said these are critical
[34:41] things like I said if you could uh if
[34:43] you could asked Isaiah you know you
[34:45] could ask Isaiah Isaiah could you spend
[34:47] four years giving me a little more
[34:51] scripture some of your own personal
[34:53] thoughts scriptural thoughts about your
[34:56] prophecy and then have that or Moses
[34:59] Moses could you give me could you study
[35:01] maybe chapter the first three chapters
[35:03] of Genesis again and you could you give
[35:05] me some more scriptures to kind of back
[35:07] this up and give me some commentary what
[35:09] would you have you'd have a masterpiece
[35:11] praise God you'd have a prophet's
[35:14] commentary on the scripture and that's
[35:16] exactly what we got here uh with with
[35:19] the church age book so let's look at
[35:21] these thoughts and we'll be probably
[35:22] switching you know to some scriptures uh
[35:24] because I had some scriptures come on my
[35:26] heart that we might like to look at uh
[35:29] by the grace of the Lord but uh this is
[35:32] part three tonight now we are preaching
[35:35] we're reading a letter that Jesus sent
[35:37] out to the Christians just just for
[35:39] Austin and Stephanie probably and maybe
[35:41] some of you that haven't heard it Jesus
[35:42] wrote this letter you know to these
[35:44] Believers that would live from 53 ad to
[35:47] 170 ad that's what this letter is for
[35:51] okay and the messenger that Christ sent
[35:53] to them after he sent these words was St
[35:55] Paul and uh you know Paul lived from 5
[35:58] to 67
[36:00] ad so we are looking at this first blue
[36:03] box right here this is uh the the this
[36:06] is the group all these PE all these
[36:07] Christians that lived during that time
[36:09] that's the group that Jesus is speaking
[36:11] to right here because he said there are
[36:13] seven cities and there's seven uh
[36:15] Gentile cities and he was s sending
[36:18] seven different messages uh to each and
[36:21] every city okay and it was prophetic of
[36:24] these time periods so we're looking at
[36:26] uh a m message that that that uh Jesus
[36:29] is sending to them through Paul and Paul
[36:32] lived in that green box that light green
[36:34] box there that was Paul's lifespan so he
[36:37] came at the beginning of the church age
[36:38] how many know that by God's grace and uh
[36:42] we want to now then look at this here uh
[36:45] we we looked last week just I'm I'm
[36:47] going to review just one minute okay and
[36:48] I'm going to set my timer here I'm gonna
[36:50] preach hour by God's grace so amen I
[36:53] preached two hours on Sunday morning at
[36:56] cams and they were still really by the
[36:58] end some of them were up standing up
[36:59] still amen and so I said praise God I've
[37:01] just forgot all track of time so that's
[37:03] why my voice is still pretty horse we
[37:05] just had some wonderful times uh
[37:07] preaching at the top of my lungs so it
[37:09] was really good it it was just a real
[37:11] good time now uh in chapter two verse
[37:16] one Christ introduces himself to the

[39:04] thank you

[39:08] by looking at verse two I Know Thy works
[39:11] and thy labor and thy
[39:13] patience and how thou c not bear them
[39:15] which are evil and the prophet looks at
[39:17] this scripture and he says he sees
[39:20] Christ praising his own
[39:22] people he starts off by saying I've Got
[39:24] The Messengers I'm right walking with
[39:26] you and then he says I know your works I
[39:31] know you're what you're trying to do for
[39:32] me praise God he said I know your labor
[39:35] I know you're labor your hard labor for
[39:37] the gospel and your patience how many
[39:39] still waiting on Jesus to fulfill all
[39:41] his promises keep waiting amen he'll
[39:44] never fail one if you believe amen all
[39:46] things are possible so he's praising
[39:48] them I know what you do for me I know
[39:50] how you serve me I know you're waiting
[39:52] on me he's praising them amen and we
[39:56] ended with that and we showed how
[39:59] um that's how we run a church that's how
[40:01] we run a family when we got to when we
[40:03] got to correct our family first bring a
[40:05] compliment when you got to correct
[40:07] somebody first uh it's a good idea to
[40:09] First bring a compliment to first thank
[40:11] them for what they do and then try to
[40:13] bring the correction in a in in a in a
[40:15] corrective way that'll help them praise
[40:17] God to help them get better uh the world
[40:20] just likes to rebuke and cuss people out
[40:23] but a a real Christian will be able to
[40:26] thank somebody bring bring the
[40:27] correction and then help guide them on
[40:29] how to get
[40:31] better but a sinner just you know
[40:33] they'll cuss you out and they'll make
[40:35] you feel so and so I like I come to
[40:37] intersection today and I forgot that I
[40:39] had a stop sign but the other one
[40:42] didn't and so I stopped and then they're
[40:44] coming up and I thought well they're
[40:45] goingon to stop so I pull out into their
[40:47] section and they start honking and you
[40:49] know doing all kinds of evil things to
[40:51] me blanky blank and I'm just sitting
[40:52] there like okay thank you and uh and you
[40:57] know how it is you can see they're
[40:58] yelling in the car and they're on the
[41:00] cell phone yelling at me and all these
[41:01] things I'm just I'm not yelling
[41:04] back Christians don't return evil for
[41:06] evil Christians return good for evil I
[41:10] was so shocked I just kind of
[41:13] straightforward and I drove through I'm
[41:15] like mercy God have mercy on these
[41:16] people they could talk on their self
[41:18] cell phone and show you signs and do all
[41:20] kinds of wicked things like that I
[41:22] didn't even mean to do
[41:24] it but uh that's how the World treats
[41:28] people that make mistakes but Christians
[41:30] aren't that way Christians if they say
[41:32] something and they catch you doing wrong
[41:34] they they'll maybe pray about it they'll
[41:35] talk to you and they'll try to
[41:37] straighten you out and help you get
[41:39] better and that's what Christ is doing
[41:41] here he says I know that you're working
[41:42] for me I know that you're laboring for
[41:44] me and I know you're waiting on me
[41:47] praise the Lord now let's look at the
[41:49] rest of this next uh let's look at the
[41:51] next thought here now we're getting into
[41:52] some uh fresh quotes
[41:55] here as he walks in the midst of his
[41:58] church he's aware of the suffering of
[42:01] his
[42:02] people and he
[42:03] cares how many people just want somebody
[42:06] to care about them my hands
[42:08] up sometimes you feel like nobody
[42:11] cares we all want Christ to care about
[42:14] us and He does care about us that's why
[42:18] we've had Grace in our lives that's why
[42:19] we have Second Chances third chances
[42:21] fourth chances right that's why there
[42:23] have so many chances to get it right so
[42:25] many chances to be free from sin so many
[42:28] chances to hear God's word to be saved
[42:31] he gives us so many chances he's aware
[42:33] of our sufferings because he says I know
[42:36] I know I know what you're suffering no
[42:39] man ever suffered like Jesus Christ no
[42:41] woman ever suffered like Jesus
[42:44] Christ yes there's been innocent
[42:45] children innocent people that had been
[42:47] hurting but Jesus was perfectly innocent
[42:50] that nobody could ever say and nobody
[42:52] could ever say there was as innocent or
[42:54] perfect as Jesus no one could say that
[42:57] but Christ was the perfect God man and
[42:59] he suffered more than anyone has ever
[43:02] suffered and he says I know your
[43:04] patience I know your works I know your
[43:07] labor and he's aware of the suffering of
[43:09] his people and he cares praise
[43:12] God how do you know he cares because I
[43:15] felt
[43:15] it when no one else cared for me I
[43:18] prayed and I felt he cared about me amen
[43:21] and that relief that released my burden
[43:24] it released my pain it released that
[43:26] because I know God's
[43:28] real science can they can do all they
[43:31] want they can't explain everything
[43:33] praise God they can hardly explain
[43:35] anything anymore they keep messing up
[43:37] and all these things like that and try
[43:39] to fix something but God's word has
[43:41] always been the same it's never changed
[43:43] and God shows uh he's so powerful by
[43:45] what he
[43:46] creates man cannot create nothing nor
[43:49] destroy it so was already here before
[43:51] man got here amen and he'll be here
[43:54] after man is done done away with the
[43:55] kingdoms of the world I'm talking about
[43:57] the the kingdom of the US the kingdom of
[43:59] China all these kingdoms will fall these
[44:01] kingdoms of man but the kingdom of
[44:03] Christ will reign forever it's exactly
[44:06] right notice he cares as it was in the
[44:09] days of the Captivity in Egypt when he
[44:12] heard their
[44:13] cries he who never changes still hears
[44:16] the cries of the oppressed as he walks
[44:18] among them the very word labor signifies
[44:21] a weariness through oppression so Jesus
[44:25] is aware that you're weary anybody ever
[44:26] get weary
[44:27] fighting all these Earthly battles
[44:29] fighting all these demons all these
[44:31] Devils all these mind battles all this
[44:33] depression all this Pride all this lust
[44:36] anybody ever get weary fighting that
[44:38] persecution rejection all these things
[44:41] ever get weary battling that well Christ
[44:43] knows exactly what you're going through
[44:45] amen and he cares that's why he offered
[44:48] you hope he offered his eternal promise
[44:50] he offered you his medicine right here
[44:52] by God's
[44:53] grace it was a medicine for all my
[44:55] addictions praise God it was a medicine
[44:57] for all my disease all my sickness this
[44:59] has been medicine this is the only real
[45:01] medicine amen all the other medicine's
[45:03] nice it might help you out a little bit
[45:05] but this will help you out eternally
[45:06] praise
[45:08] God now notice God's people do not only
[45:12] work for him in a labor of love but they
[45:14] suffer for him with
[45:18] joy joy they suffer with joy they are
[45:22] patient in bearing the Yoke or the
[45:23] burden this first age suffered great
[45:26] persecution it had to work hard to
[45:28] preach the gospel and shed forth truth
[45:30] their High Calling in life was to serve
[45:34] God I just brother Jess I just want to
[45:37] serve God that's my High Calling in life
[45:39] that's all I want to hear that's all I
[45:42] want to say myself I just want to serve
[45:45] God in some
[45:47] capacity to serve my Creator to serve
[45:49] the one who formed me my mother's womb
[45:51] my mom didn't do it it might have been
[45:53] in her body but she's not the one who
[45:55] formed me it was God who form me it was
[45:58] God's creative hand that formed
[46:01] me he says Christians are patient
[46:04] bearing the Yoke I'm
[46:06] sorry their High Calling in life was to
[46:08] serve God and when their hopes in life
[46:11] were blighted they were patient and
[46:13] committed all to him who had promised a
[46:15] lasting recompense or repayment in
[46:18] heaven for what they had given up for
[46:20] him on Earth you know sometimes people
[46:23] get discouraged about you know when
[46:24] young people die early or when children
[46:26] die early but think about if they died
[46:29] uh serving God think about what kind of
[46:31] reward they'll get think about what kind
[46:34] of reward they get a great reward how
[46:36] many believe
[46:37] that or if they suffer or if they're
[46:39] Christians and Christian family maybe
[46:41] their house gets burned down and they
[46:42] die or something like that think about
[46:44] the reward yeah they didn't get to live
[46:46] out their Earthly life here but they got
[46:48] to go to Eternity and live forever with
[46:50] Jesus Christ we don't think about those
[46:54] uh scenarios very often do we because
[46:56] we're human you know we think about you
[46:58] know the hardships oh that must be hard
[46:59] that must be painful that must be awful
[47:02] but Jesus promised he said I know your
[47:04] labor I know your works and I know
[47:06] you're suffering and I care about you
[47:09] amen now I W to um if we can by God's
[47:14] grace let's read this and I want to find
[47:15] a scripture let's go to next one I want
[47:18] to find a scripture uh real quick if
[47:20] you'll bear with me just a little bit by
[47:21] God's grace let's read this and then
[47:23] we'll uh find the scripture
[47:28] I think I got a scripture in
[47:29] Ecclesiastes just a
[47:35] moment okay yeah I found it okay let's
[47:38] read this I think we ought to stop here
[47:40] and deal with the thought that God's
[47:42] people have always been and always will
[47:45] be
[47:47] persecuted you know that Genesis is the
[47:49] book of beginnings and what you find
[47:51] started there will carry right on
[47:53] through the Revelation and never change
[47:56] when we see see that Cain persecuted and
[47:58] killed Abel because the latter or Abel
[48:01] pleased God so whoever pleases God will
[48:04] be
[48:05] persecuted how many can say Amen to that
[48:08] if you're not being persecuted maybe
[48:09] you're in a season of
[48:12] Peace but if you're never been
[48:14] persecuted maybe you're not saved yet
[48:17] because once you get saved you start
[48:18] getting persecuted for what you beli our
[48:21] persecution is not physical yet although
[48:23] there can be some of that in America but
[48:26] not like other countries like Iran and
[48:28] and South Africa and different countries
[48:30] like that where there's uh maybe North
[48:32] Korea different places like that Japan
[48:35] China but we still suffer some
[48:38] persecution praise
[48:40] God he
[48:42] says then we see a perfect picture in
[48:45] Abraham's son of the flesh ishmail who
[48:47] teased so te see teasing teasing is a
[48:50] form of
[48:51] persecution teasing oh why do you gotta
[48:54] look at your oldfashioned clothes oh
[48:57] look at your split end sisters you don't
[48:59] cut your hair yet the Bible says a woman
[49:01] should not cut her hair she cuts her
[49:03] hair God doesn't hear her
[49:04] prayers praise God oh you men look at
[49:07] you oh look at your shirt and tie you
[49:09] think you're some fancy guy look at you
[49:11] you think you're somebody special oh you
[49:14] won't cuss or smoke her you won't go out
[49:15] to the shows with us you won't go to the
[49:17] sports games anymore a bunch of sissies
[49:20] and they make fun of you any teasing at
[49:23] you for following the word of God is a
[49:25] form of persecution
[49:29] that's how they that's how they first
[49:31] persecuted the son of Abraham Isaac
[49:34] right how many sons of Abraham we got in
[49:35] here
[49:36] spiritually that's the natural son of
[49:38] Abra what about the spiritual sons of
[49:41] Abraham that's right now if you got your
[49:45] Bibles uh Isaiah 571 Mal does this show
[49:49] up okay on the um the live stream is it
[49:52] showing up okay okay Isaiah 571
[49:58] I want to show this because I didn't
[49:59] have it on the
[50:00] slideshow but you
[50:02] know God uh God does things that
[50:05] oftentimes we're not really watching
[50:07] for uh we don't consider these things
[50:11] look at verse look at verse one the
[50:13] righteous perisheth so a child will be
[50:16] righteous right because they don't they
[50:17] don't know they're a sinner yet so a
[50:19] child dies the righteous perisheth and
[50:22] no man layeth it to heart nobody really
[50:25] thinks about it and merci men are taken
[50:27] away so good merciful men and none
[50:30] considerthe is taken away from the evil
[50:34] to
[50:35] come look at that scripture like I said
[50:38] people get all upset well how could this
[50:41] how could there be a God and let this
[50:42] person go off the scene and the Bible
[50:44] said many times God takes them away
[50:47] because evil that's going to come later
[50:48] on their
[50:51] lives and God will pay them back a
[50:55] millionfold
[50:57] a billionfold God always pays them back
[51:00] if they life is cut short a little bit
[51:02] here don't we trust God and know that
[51:04] God's ways are better than our ways
[51:06] don't we trust God to know that if he's
[51:08] Eternal and perfect and he knows the
[51:10] beginning from the end can't we trust
[51:11] him if somebody gets taken away even
[51:13] unexpectedly to us it was unexpected to
[51:16] us but not to
[51:18] God see nobody takes it to heart nobody
[51:21] thinks about God's perspective on things
[51:24] let's have a humble heart and say Lord
[51:25] help me just to accept what your will
[51:28] happens help me just to be humble help
[51:31] me not to judge and try to think I know
[51:33] more about it than anybody else help me
[51:34] just to be humble in my life amen so I
[51:38] thought you like that how many like that
[51:39] scripture by God's grace I come across I
[51:41] said my that's a powerful scripture
[51:43] praise God I hadn't seen that for a
[51:45] while now and then there was Esau so
[51:47] Cain persecuted Abel now Esau persecutes
[51:51] hated Jacob and would have killed him
[51:53] had not God intervened remember his mom
[51:55] said get out of here you're gonna he's
[51:56] going to kill you run and on his way a
[52:00] pillow uh pillow he had a stone for a
[52:02] pillow and he laid down and he saw
[52:05] Jacob's
[52:06] Ladder and he saw the ladder that go up
[52:09] into heaven and he said Lord because you
[52:11] showed me this surely I'll tithe all my
[52:14] tithes because you showed me there's a
[52:16] way to heaven and you'll bless me and be
[52:18] with me surely I'll give you back a
[52:20] tenth of everything I
[52:22] own and that was not a law that was
[52:24] Grace that was just Grace from his
[52:28] heart God intervene to save Jacob how
[52:31] many times God intervene to save you
[52:33] well we'll find out one day won't
[52:35] we in the New Testament we find Judas
[52:38] betraying Jesus while the righteous
[52:41] orders of the first century attempted to
[52:43] destroy the early Believers the children
[52:45] of this world controlled by the devil
[52:48] hate be careful what you hate only thing
[52:50] we should hate is
[52:51] Satan and I can say this we should hate
[52:54] our sin I forgot about that one we
[52:56] should hate our
[52:58] sin the children of God who are
[53:00] controlled by the spirit
[53:02] so we should uh we will experience
[53:05] persecution at times we'll experience
[53:07] hatred from people teasing all these are
[53:10] forms of hatred from the Antichrist
[53:12] Spirit we should expect
[53:16] that no matter how just and upright a
[53:19] Christian is before the public how
[53:20] gracious he is to his fellow man doing
[53:23] not but good so no matter how close you
[53:25] can live to God let him confess Christ
[53:28] as the Savior and acknowledge the
[53:30] operation of the gifts of the holy
[53:31] spirit in tongues prophecy healing and
[53:34] miracles and he will be
[53:37] condemned now remember our condemnation
[53:39] might come a little differently for
[53:41] example in America most time the
[53:42] condemnation comes behind your back
[53:45] people will talk bad behind your back
[53:46] and they'll stick a knife in your back
[53:48] usually most people won't do it in front
[53:50] of your face at least what I've
[53:52] experienced now they will do it over
[53:53] internet because you're not face to face
[53:54] with them I got a lot of that I got a
[53:56] lot of hatred on YouTube I sure got a
[53:59] lot of hatred there because it's not
[54:01] face to face and people are fearful they
[54:03] won't say it to your face because
[54:05] they're
[54:05] fearful uh but really deep inside of
[54:08] them when they attack when they tease
[54:11] when they condemn it's the spirit of
[54:13] hatred from
[54:14] Satan we should expect that as
[54:18] Believers the spirit of the world hates
[54:21] the spirit of God and because it can't
[54:23] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[54:25] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[54:28] of Truth
[54:29] dwells hallelujah our spirit cannot be
[54:32] conquered amen our spirit's Mighty
[54:35] Victorious powerful Eternal the Victor
[54:38] Hallelujah and so he Satan tries to
[54:40] destroy the humans who are pack in the
[54:42] word of
[54:44] Truth persecution and trials are a
[54:47] natural normal let's say normal normal
[54:51] part of the Christian Life what's the
[54:53] normal part of your life eating lunch
[54:55] eating breakfast
[54:57] getting dressed taking a shower rushing
[54:59] your teeth those are all normal things
[55:01] so is persecution and trials for a
[55:04] Christian it's part of the normal
[55:07] everyday life so we ought to get used to
[55:09] it and just stop complaining about it
[55:11] and the church
[55:13] said stop complaining about it it's the
[55:15] normal part of life brother man said
[55:18] trials are what Growing Pains of God's
[55:21] grace there's only one thing you can do
[55:23] about all your persecution and trials
[55:25] and teas and hins commit them to God say
[55:29] God you take care of this person who's
[55:31] teasing me you take care of this person
[55:33] who looks down upon me or mocks me or
[55:35] ignores
[55:36] me you take you I'm gonna just love love
[55:40] love you take care of this and I'm not
[55:42] gonna judge that person I'm not gonna
[55:45] say Well they're going to hell or I hope
[55:47] God kills them and don't judge
[55:50] them leave their outworking of these
[55:52] trials and the final judgments to God
[55:58] God is the judge let's let him be
[56:01] judge we get in trouble when we try to
[56:03] judge right try to judge everything and
[56:05] judge people let God be the
[56:08] judge praise God it's a normal part of
[56:12] life the only thing you can do is Lord
[56:14] take this teasing take this rebuke take
[56:16] this ignorance or people ignore me take
[56:18] this pain that I have Lord I committed
[56:21] under your hands just give me Grace to
[56:23] go
[56:23] through every now and then he might just
[56:25] supernat deliver you from something
[56:28] praise God he might just uh take away
[56:30] your enemies and take away the reproach
[56:32] but other times he might let you suffer
[56:34] through it for a
[56:35] while and you might have to bear the
[56:37] cross for a
[56:38] while but during that time don't judge
[56:41] leave it all up to him just ask God for
[56:44] Grace to
[56:45] endure for example brother Simon brother
[56:47] Cam's got a brother in his church there
[56:49] that we prayed for uh in tears with all
[56:51] of our hearts he got shot by a cop a few
[56:54] years ago if you want the news
[56:56] uh video send me a textt and I'll text
[56:58] him to you it's just a powerful story
[57:00] well we were praying for him on Saturday
[57:02] night just maybe for 30 minutes 40
[57:04] minutes afterwards uh the bullet's still
[57:06] in his back and he's paralyzed from the
[57:08] waist down and he said there's bullets
[57:10] causing me pain and we just prayed and
[57:12] cried and I cried out to God I yelled
[57:14] and the relief didn't come right
[57:17] then but that didn't stumble him at all
[57:20] he said I've believe in God he saved me
[57:23] uh he's redeemed me and he said later
[57:25] went to bed that night he woke up in the
[57:26] middle of night and his got off his
[57:28] wheelchair wheeled his way to the water
[57:30] uh got some water and he said there pain
[57:31] left him there that in the middle of the
[57:33] night by God's grace now look we prayed
[57:36] for him at 10 o'clock at night he just
[57:38] had to wait a few more hours for the for
[57:40] the pain to
[57:42] subside but if we didn't get it right
[57:44] away we say well God must not love me he
[57:46] must not hear my prayer God heard the
[57:48] prayer we just got to wait do you want
[57:50] to know the story the story is he was a
[57:53] weightlifter uh a bouncer and some
[57:57] uh very wealthy Toledo clubs and he
[58:00] thought he was invincible and two weeks
[58:02] before he got shot he said I'm so strong
[58:03] and powerful it'll take a bullet to take
[58:05] me down he wasn't a
[58:07] Christian he he got stopped by a police
[58:09] officer on his motorcycle the co cops
[58:11] back here and I got the videos if you
[58:14] want to see it it's powerful powerful he
[58:16] was reaching in to get his license and
[58:18] ID and the cop thought he was getting a
[58:19] gun and shot him right in the back and
[58:21] paralyzed
[58:22] him uh this was a few years
[58:25] ago he said that situation he wasn't a
[58:28] Christian tore his family apart they
[58:30] hated this cop and they just came to
[58:32] trial two months
[58:34] ago and the family all wanted to uh get
[58:38] this cop in jail and they pressed
[58:39] charges against him because really he
[58:41] was in the wrong and he would have been
[58:43] condemned but a month before the trial
[58:45] he met my cousin Adam who came a few
[58:47] months ago remember
[58:49] that and they did Bible study with Simon
[58:51] and Cam and he received the message two
[58:54] months ago
[58:57] and all that he and he said that anger
[59:00] and hatred was tearing his family apart
[59:02] they hated this cop so bad as soon as he
[59:05] received the message he learned about
[59:06] forgiveness he forgave the cop and his
[59:10] whole family he convinced his whole
[59:11] family to accept Christ I don't know if
[59:13] they have or not but they have accepted
[59:14] forgiveness and he said his whole family
[59:16] can now move on they've forgiven the cop
[59:19] and the and the court at the court date
[59:21] when they went to the court he's he's
[59:23] sitting there in his wheelchair and he
[59:24] says I've got my King James Bible here
[59:26] and I love Jesus Christ I'll send you
[59:27] the video he literally says that it's on
[59:29] the news and brother Simon and cam been
[59:32] teaching him the word of God and he said
[59:33] I forgive him because uh Christ forgave
[59:38] me and he said we're we want all the
[59:41] charges dropped on the police officer
[59:43] and all the charges were
[59:45] dropped That's The Power of forgiveness
[59:48] now what would be greater for God to
[59:49] heal him instantly and he can walk again
[59:51] and not forgive and go to hell because
[59:54] he's got hatred in his heart or to be
[59:56] able to forgive the man and receive
[59:59] salvation
[1:00:00] amen and then let's see if God don't
[1:00:03] heal him let's see because he's the same
[1:00:06] yesterday today and forever let's ask
[1:00:08] and see what God will do I got two and
[1:00:10] two news stations covered
[1:00:12] it it's powerful he stands right there
[1:00:14] packing his Bible and he says I know
[1:00:16] God's going to heal me uh so he has a
[1:00:18] revelation of his healing he said I'm
[1:00:19] gonna walk out of this wheelchair I feel
[1:00:21] my nerves coming back in my
[1:00:23] legs anyways we're praying for him on S
[1:00:26] night and that's what it came through we
[1:00:28] just we just prayed and cried out to God
[1:00:30] we don't know but we all these things we
[1:00:32] gota we can't judge like he couldn't
[1:00:33] judge the cop right he couldn't say oh
[1:00:36] he's going to hell and all these things
[1:00:38] oh he did me so wrong every trial
[1:00:41] committed to
[1:00:42] God if somebody does something evil
[1:00:44] against you forgive
[1:00:47] them forgive and you shall be forgiven
[1:00:49] how many know that's the scripture if
[1:00:51] you don't forgive Christ won't forgive
[1:00:53] you you must forgive everyone who sinned
[1:00:55] against
[1:00:56] you and how do you do that well you
[1:00:58] think well I want Christ to forgive me I
[1:01:00] sinned against him and let me tell you
[1:01:01] you've sinned against Christ more than
[1:01:03] anyone else ever sinned against
[1:01:07] you we must have a revelation of
[1:01:09] forgiveness Lord unveil forgiveness show
[1:01:12] me what this means help me to forgive
[1:01:14] those whove wronged
[1:01:15] me
[1:01:17] Glory all right I got 35 minutes okay
[1:01:20] next let's let's let's keep going on
[1:01:22] verse two and how now this church
[1:01:26] uh could not stand evil
[1:01:29] people so see while while we forgive
[1:01:32] it's the the the evil still burdens
[1:01:35] us and Jesus says I know how you cannot
[1:01:39] bear them which are evil in other words
[1:01:41] they can't let them hang around and
[1:01:44] that's true although we love and forgive
[1:01:46] people we can't let people who sin hang
[1:01:48] around the church too long because their
[1:01:50] sin will start influencing others that's
[1:01:53] how demons work demons anoint one person
[1:01:56] they call out and they try to influence
[1:01:57] others come join me come join
[1:01:59] me when you were a sinner how how did
[1:02:02] you get into sin somebody invited you to
[1:02:03] watch a evil movie somebody looked
[1:02:05] invited look at some evil magazine
[1:02:06] somebody invited you to wear some evil
[1:02:09] clothes praise God it travels from one
[1:02:12] evil person to another so Jesus tells
[1:02:14] us while we while he will help us during
[1:02:17] these trials we should not bear with
[1:02:20] them that are
[1:02:22] evil now he said these a believe that
[1:02:26] God's people ought to be holy which
[1:02:29] means sacred and set apart from
[1:02:33] sin according to this verse they took
[1:02:35] steps to keep the body unleavened from
[1:02:38] sin most evidently the apostasy had
[1:02:41] already started send an enter into the
[1:02:43] church but they were obedient to the
[1:02:45] words of Paul when he said to put away
[1:02:47] the wicked from among
[1:02:49] them they were a separated people they
[1:02:52] had come out of the world and now they
[1:02:53] weren't going to let the world enter
[1:02:55] amongst them I like that amen glory I
[1:02:59] spent 19 years living in sin and I've
[1:03:03] spent the last how old am I
[1:03:06] now 17 S I spent the last 17 or 18 years
[1:03:11] keeping the sin out and I'm not ready to
[1:03:13] let that sin back in amen I spent 19
[1:03:16] years loving sin I spent the last 17
[1:03:19] hating sin and I will not let it come
[1:03:22] back
[1:03:22] in because I'm happier without it I'm
[1:03:25] forgiven without it I'm free without it
[1:03:27] I'm a Christian without it hallelujah
[1:03:29] hallelujah it will not come back in
[1:03:32] because it's cast out in Jesus Christ's
[1:03:35] name this is how the Ephesians were they
[1:03:37] used to be Sinners and once they got
[1:03:39] holy they said we're not letting that
[1:03:41] devil back in amen that's the Revelation
[1:03:44] this church needs amen do everything we
[1:03:46] can do to keep him out if we finally get
[1:03:49] him out let's keep him out amen don't
[1:03:52] let him in now let's go to that real
[1:03:54] quick let's go to First Corinthians 5 I
[1:03:56] don't have it on there let's just go
[1:03:58] what he's talking about 1 Corinthians 5
[1:04:01] just as a reminder here's an
[1:04:07] example 1 Corinthians 5 it's familiar to
[1:04:10] you 1 Corinthians 5 verse1 I might as
[1:04:13] well turn there if I got it here can see
[1:04:16] it a little better by God's grace takes
[1:04:19] a
[1:04:21] second verse one it's reported commonly
[1:04:24] that there is fornication among you now
[1:04:26] fornication is any sexual activity
[1:04:28] outside of a a legal
[1:04:31] marriage and such fornication as is not
[1:04:34] so much as named among the Gentiles that
[1:04:37] one should have his father's wife so
[1:04:38] there was a man sitting in this church
[1:04:40] in
[1:04:41] Corinth who was having uh sexual
[1:04:44] relations with his
[1:04:47] stepmother in verse two and you are
[1:04:49] puffed up so you they were prideful
[1:04:51] about it they were uh they were not
[1:04:53] burdened about it they were prideful
[1:04:54] about it and have not rather mourn they
[1:04:56] weren't mourning and crying over this
[1:04:58] how could this person our church do such
[1:05:01] evil wickedness they weren't mourning
[1:05:03] about it and Paul's here to correct them
[1:05:06] we should mourn over sin in the
[1:05:09] church they should have been mourning
[1:05:11] that he which had done this deed might
[1:05:12] be taken away from among
[1:05:15] you so see that Spirit of sexual
[1:05:18] Temptation and lust it would jump off
[1:05:20] that man and try to get on somebody else
[1:05:23] praise the Lord
[1:05:27] verse three but for verily as absent in
[1:05:29] body but present in spirit I've judged
[1:05:32] this already as though I were present
[1:05:34] concerning him that had done or so done
[1:05:36] this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ when you're gathered together and
[1:05:40] my spirit with the power of our Lord
[1:05:42] Jesus Christ amen so in the name and in
[1:05:45] the power of the name
[1:05:47] Hallelujah deliver such in one unto
[1:05:50] Satan for the destruction of the flesh
[1:05:52] so when someone won't mourn and repent
[1:05:54] over their sins we know what Jesus said
[1:05:56] go to them first one-on-one if they
[1:05:58] won't receive it take a witness with you
[1:06:01] if they still won't receive it give them
[1:06:02] so many days and then kick them out of
[1:06:04] the church that's how we keep the church
[1:06:07] clean you deliver them say let Satan
[1:06:10] haveen if they want want want to repent
[1:06:11] then let let them enjoy Satan's
[1:06:13] treatment and Satan will try to kill
[1:06:15] them that the spirit may be saved in the
[1:06:18] day of the Lord
[1:06:19] Jesus all right so that's an example if
[1:06:22] we let people come in here and say
[1:06:24] they're church members and get baptized
[1:06:25] in Jesus name and act like they're
[1:06:27] Christians and they continue in sexual
[1:06:29] sin or other sins they should not be a
[1:06:31] part of and if we just put up with that
[1:06:33] it's ultimately gonna pervert our
[1:06:35] spiritual lives it will affect us
[1:06:38] because it's a it's a pleasure-loving
[1:06:40] demon amongst the Christians and we're
[1:06:42] either gonna have the Holy Spirit moving
[1:06:43] here or the Unholy Spirit here but we
[1:06:46] want the Holy Spirit
[1:06:47] here and the Holy Spirit can't work
[1:06:50] while the Unholy one is is is taking
[1:06:52] over people's lives and making them
[1:06:54] lukewarm and all these things like that
[1:06:55] we've got to cast out evil spirits
[1:06:58] amen all right so Paul says there Purge
[1:07:00] it out clean it out get rid of that old
[1:07:02] Le be a new church be a new lump amen
[1:07:05] for even Christ Our Passover is
[1:07:08] sacrificed for us amen all right so I
[1:07:11] want to show that that gives you a clear
[1:07:14] concrete example once we come out of the
[1:07:16] world we don't want the world coming
[1:07:18] back in all right brother Gabe was
[1:07:20] hitting on some of those things like uh
[1:07:22] you know the clothes and the TV and the
[1:07:25] Facebook book and so I'm going to preach
[1:07:26] again on that Lord willing on Sunday by
[1:07:28] God's grace Amen to kind of uh back that
[1:07:30] up by God's grace I already had preached
[1:07:32] that but I want to go over that uh again
[1:07:34] and of course family life and things
[1:07:36] like that I want to go over family life
[1:07:37] a little bit on Sunday Morning by God's
[1:07:40] grace the Ephesians would not put up
[1:07:42] with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a
[1:07:46] phrase with them or a figure of speech
[1:07:48] it was a way of life amen in other words
[1:07:52] they just say well we're trying to be
[1:07:53] holy we're trying to be holy we're holy
[1:07:55] were holy they actually lived holy lives
[1:07:57] they didn't have to say how holy they
[1:07:59] were you could feel how holy they
[1:08:01] were Glory you could see how holy they
[1:08:04] were by their life wasn't just like all
[1:08:07] talk it wasn't all talk it was action
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:13] now doing good on time okay praise the
[1:08:16] Lord now Jesus says now he says and you
[1:08:20] have this what we got to do we have and
[1:08:22] thou has tried them which say their
[1:08:24] apostles
[1:08:26] and are not and has found them
[1:08:30] Liars now what do I mean we got to do
[1:08:32] this anyone who says they have a calling
[1:08:35] of God in their life must be Tried by
[1:08:37] the
[1:08:39] word praise
[1:08:41] God anyone if you say you're a pastor
[1:08:43] you got to be Tried by the word your
[1:08:45] life's got to be proven by the word of
[1:08:47] God the Bible said lay no or lay hands
[1:08:50] upon no man suddenly that's speaking of
[1:08:52] ordaining gifts in the church so don't
[1:08:55] we if somebody like somebody feels led
[1:08:57] to preach the way we do it we give them
[1:08:59] a few opportunities to preach and and
[1:09:00] then when we when we all can say oh my
[1:09:03] the Holy Ghost is really in this man's
[1:09:04] Ministry then we lay hands and sanction
[1:09:07] that gift and say God's given us another
[1:09:09] gift in the
[1:09:10] church praise God I started preaching in
[1:09:13] January of 2004 I got ordained in August
[1:09:16] of 2004 it's eight months later so they
[1:09:19] gave me eight months before they
[1:09:21] ordained my gift
[1:09:23] amen and I say like this I believe it's
[1:09:25] the test of time amen that's just my
[1:09:27] personal opinion by God's grace because
[1:09:29] it ain't me it's Christ's calling in my
[1:09:31] life amen and every gift should be like
[1:09:35] that and so the real
[1:09:38] church will make sure all those who say
[1:09:40] they have a calling or gift to you got
[1:09:42] got a gift to prophesy I got a gift to
[1:09:44] tongues they make sure they prove
[1:09:46] it God has to prove that they got what
[1:09:49] they say they got and if not they're
[1:09:52] Liars see this ain't a time to play this
[1:09:54] ain't a time to be silly and nonsense or
[1:09:57] try to pretend you got something you got
[1:09:59] whatever you got Amen brother B said how
[1:10:02] do you know you got a gift you can do
[1:10:03] whatever you're talking
[1:10:05] about you can do it amen not just talk
[1:10:08] about it you can do it
[1:10:10] Hallelujah he said what right has a
[1:10:13] people to try those who call themselves
[1:10:15] Apostles and how do they try them he
[1:10:17] said oh I love
[1:10:20] this he said here it is in Galatians 1:
[1:10:23] 18 but though we are an angel from
[1:10:25] heaven preach any other gospel on you
[1:10:26] than that which we have already preached
[1:10:28] unto you let him be
[1:10:31] cursed it was the apostles who brought
[1:10:34] the original word to the people that
[1:10:36] original word could not change not even
[1:10:39] a DOT or a dash of it
[1:10:44] Hallelujah so how do you try them if you
[1:10:46] if you say you're an apostle then you
[1:10:48] got to preach the apostles word if you
[1:10:50] change anything about it you're not an
[1:10:52] apostle how many believe that praise God
[1:10:56] they knew that the Ephesians knew that
[1:10:57] they met Paul Paul's an apostle Paul
[1:10:59] prayed for them they got filled with the
[1:11:01] Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] amen and then Paul preached to them and
[1:11:05] uh all the sorcerers threw all their
[1:11:07] magic books in a pile and burn about
[1:11:09] $100,000 worth of books we'd say for
[1:11:11] that day oh a mighty move of
[1:11:14] God but remember Alexander and I think
[1:11:18] it was Demetrius the copper Smith put up
[1:11:20] a fuss remember what happened after that
[1:11:22] Paul left after that and that's when
[1:11:24] demons down and said well maybe Paul's
[1:11:26] Lo lost his gift maybe he's not such a
[1:11:29] mighty man
[1:11:32] anymore well that have stumbled you no
[1:11:35] that would not have stumbled me because
[1:11:37] you can only do whatever God's called
[1:11:38] you to
[1:11:40] do and then if you read your Bible in
[1:11:42] second Timothy Paul warned Timothy be
[1:11:44] careful for Alexander and
[1:11:48] Demetrius well I've got perfect Rapture
[1:11:50] in faith well you
[1:11:52] might but if you don't have a revelation
[1:11:54] about a certain thing thing you
[1:11:55] shouldn't act like you got it Paul had
[1:11:58] no Revelation that Timothy would have no
[1:12:00] trouble with Alexander so he didn't act
[1:12:01] like he
[1:12:03] did praise the
[1:12:06] Lord so be
[1:12:08] careful what we say about a revelation
[1:12:11] amen because Paul was even so wise and
[1:12:13] mature to say be careful for Alexander
[1:12:16] be careful for Demetrius they've done me
[1:12:18] much harm that's the word of God he
[1:12:21] never lost his gift he never lost his
[1:12:22] Visions he never lost his anointing but
[1:12:25] he would not insert something that God
[1:12:28] didn't say he'd only say what God Said
[1:12:30] there it is right there amen and so
[1:12:32] should
[1:12:37] we all right Paul knew it was God who
[1:12:41] had spoken to him so he said even if I
[1:12:43] come and try to give a second Revelation
[1:12:45] try to make one little change in what I
[1:12:47] gave originally let me be cursed that's
[1:12:49] how important it is to stay with the
[1:12:51] word of God he said I I should even be
[1:12:54] cursed if I change one thing in my in my
[1:12:56] word you see Paul knew the first
[1:12:59] revelation was correct God can't give a
[1:13:01] first revelation and then a second
[1:13:03] Revelation if he did he would be
[1:13:04] changing his mind he can give a
[1:13:06] revelation and then add to
[1:13:08] it as he did in the Garden of Eden when
[1:13:10] he promised the seed to the woman and
[1:13:12] then later designated that the seed
[1:13:14] would come through Abraham and then
[1:13:15] later said it would come by the
[1:13:17] Bloodlines in David how many you know
[1:13:20] that he starts off by saying I'll give
[1:13:22] you a seed Eve and that seed will bruise
[1:13:25] the head of the serpent about a thousand
[1:13:28] years later he tells Abraham he said
[1:13:30] through you all the world will be
[1:13:32] blessed amen through Abraham's seed so
[1:13:34] now he's got more Revelation same
[1:13:36] Revelation just more information about
[1:13:38] it more details amen it's kind of like
[1:13:41] God given a main idea then he gives
[1:13:42] details to follow the main idea is the
[1:13:45] messiah's coming Hallelujah and it's
[1:13:48] coming to deliver you from Satan and to
[1:13:50] smash Satan's head and then he gives
[1:13:53] that's his main idea then he gives
[1:13:54] details it's coming through Abraham it's
[1:13:56] coming through David he'll be born in
[1:13:57] Bethlehem all these details and Jesus
[1:14:00] fulfilled every one of those
[1:14:03] amen now this is what I want to say too
[1:14:06] let's look at this this is beautiful but
[1:14:08] it was the same Revelation about the
[1:14:09] Messiah it only gave the people more
[1:14:12] information to help them receive and
[1:14:15] understand it but God's word can't
[1:14:17] change the seed came exactly as revealed
[1:14:19] Hallelujah and see what those false
[1:14:21] apostles were doing they came with their
[1:14:23] own word those Ephesians knew what word
[1:14:27] I'm sorry that word as Paul taught it
[1:14:29] they were full of the Holy Ghost by
[1:14:31] laying on of Paul's hands h Allelujah
[1:14:34] amen now let me say this I highlighted
[1:14:38] that let me give an example the Rapture
[1:14:41] 1965 the message from Yuma Arizona I
[1:14:45] believe that was more information on the
[1:14:48] same Revelation in the
[1:14:50] Bible Paul gave us Revelation about the
[1:14:52] Rapture in 1 Corinthians 15 1 Thessalon
[1:14:55] chapter 4 he gave us all this
[1:14:56] information all these Revelations but
[1:14:59] then brother Brandon breaks down for us
[1:15:01] the shout the voice and the Trump amen
[1:15:05] glory Paul never did that he just said
[1:15:07] there's going to be a shout of voice and
[1:15:08] a trump but then the prophet of God
[1:15:10] comes and says the shout is the message
[1:15:12] the Midnight Cry to get the bride ready
[1:15:15] for the Rapture
[1:15:16] amen and then he says the voice is the
[1:15:19] voice of the Archangel and archangels
[1:15:20] are connected to body changes because
[1:15:23] the Archangel Moses or the AR Angel
[1:15:25] disputed with Satan about the body of
[1:15:27] Moses because Moses got a body change
[1:15:30] amen and the voice of the Archangel is
[1:15:32] the raising of the Dead Saints just like
[1:15:34] the same voice raised Lazarus from the
[1:15:37] grave the dead raised to life and the
[1:15:39] Trump the Bible said at the Trump of God
[1:15:42] the uh the Bible said will be changed in
[1:15:44] the moment of the twinkling of an eye
[1:15:46] amen glory he gave us more information
[1:15:50] about it praise God he connected first
[1:15:53] Thessalonians 4 with uh Matthew chapter
[1:15:56] 25 Hallelujah glory and the shout of the
[1:15:59] 10 that went out to the 10 versions what
[1:16:01] is it it's more information about the
[1:16:03] same promise now somebody got really
[1:16:06] upset at one of my
[1:16:07] videos and uh on YouTube and I admit I
[1:16:11] made a mistake so let me just uh share
[1:16:13] with you how I make mistakes sometimes
[1:16:14] because I'm not perfect on my video
[1:16:16] about modest clothing in the Bible it's
[1:16:18] got 11,000 hits on it which is pretty
[1:16:20] exciting for me to know that people you
[1:16:22] know want to know about modest clothes
[1:16:23] that's just it's awesome I like that
[1:16:26] well on the video I say that everybody's
[1:16:29] got to have you know a close down to
[1:16:31] here but actually by scripture by
[1:16:33] scripture we can only prove that when
[1:16:35] anyone shows off anything above the knee
[1:16:37] it's nakedness right that's in Isaiah
[1:16:41] 47 the Bible said I'll uncover your
[1:16:43] thigh that's
[1:16:45] nakedness okay and of course the showing
[1:16:48] the chest of the breast especially for
[1:16:49] women or men men in two anytime they
[1:16:51] show off their chest that's nakedness so
[1:16:54] God wants from here covered all the way
[1:16:56] down to here at least and the church
[1:16:58] said but on the video I kind of got
[1:17:00] really zealous I got a little
[1:17:02] overzealous and I said well Jesus wears
[1:17:04] a garment down to the foot in heaven so
[1:17:06] we all should now I got went a little
[1:17:09] overboard there okay I went to little
[1:17:11] extreme and somebody called me out on it
[1:17:13] and I thank them for that because by
[1:17:15] scripture I can't prove we should all do
[1:17:17] that now by scripture I can only say
[1:17:19] that we should have uh at least covering
[1:17:22] the thighs because if you go and study
[1:17:24] hisory history in the days of Jesus I
[1:17:26] was saying this earlier the men only had
[1:17:28] garments down past their knee but the
[1:17:29] women had them all the way down to the
[1:17:31] foot okay so you could tell right away
[1:17:34] who's a man or woman when you saw shins
[1:17:36] that's a man if you didn't see any shins
[1:17:38] or any feet that's a woman you could
[1:17:40] tell right away it's very easy and then
[1:17:42] they also wore two layers of clothes
[1:17:44] they had what was called a tunic which
[1:17:45] is like a shirt underwear
[1:17:47] shirt like if you wear a T-shirt and
[1:17:49] it's really long that's kind like your
[1:17:51] underwear layer and on top of that they
[1:17:53] had either what's called a cloak or robe
[1:17:55] how many know that and that was the
[1:17:57] outer
[1:17:58] garment Peter went fishing after the
[1:18:01] resurrection he took off his Fisher's
[1:18:03] what coat and the Bible said he was
[1:18:06] naked so see he had a very thin layer a
[1:18:09] very thin layer of underwear
[1:18:12] on praise God I don't know how far it
[1:18:15] went all I know is the Bible said he had
[1:18:16] a tunic on so when we take off clothes
[1:18:20] our outer
[1:18:21] garments right now it's okay to wear one
[1:18:23] garment if it's thick but in those days
[1:18:25] it was a very thin garment so Peter's
[1:18:28] out there fishing with his underwear on
[1:18:31] and the Bible said he was naked how many
[1:18:32] know that's the scripture that's the
[1:18:33] word of God it's John chapter 20 ver
[1:18:35] 29 now so what I I updated the videos
[1:18:39] now to correct myself and I said uh we
[1:18:42] know God is surely pleased when men and
[1:18:44] women all cover from their chest all the
[1:18:47] way down to their knees I said God is
[1:18:49] surely pleased with that I said but we
[1:18:51] encourage the Christians to pray and if
[1:18:55] God wouldn't have them to wear even more
[1:18:57] modest clothing in order to stay a far
[1:19:00] away from nakedness as they possibly
[1:19:04] could now that's to me the church now
[1:19:06] listen this is just my thought I could
[1:19:08] be wrong on this but as a minister I've
[1:19:09] got to stand somewhere when people ask
[1:19:11] me
[1:19:12] questions the Revelation that God
[1:19:15] restored to brother Ram in this day is
[1:19:16] the revelation we must dress modestly
[1:19:19] and that's in 1 Timothy 2:9 I would that
[1:19:22] women dress with modest clothing and and
[1:19:24] of course men too because Peter was
[1:19:25] naked right so you know he's
[1:19:28] specifically speaking to women because
[1:19:29] they're more beautiful they are the the
[1:19:31] temp they can be tempting if a man's not
[1:19:33] careful man's got to guard his eyes but
[1:19:35] I believe the Holy Spirit has given us
[1:19:37] more information on the revelation of
[1:19:40] modesty because we see Jesus in heaven
[1:19:43] he's gonna be wearing a garment down to
[1:19:45] the foot for all
[1:19:47] eternity praise the Lord so that's why I
[1:19:49] believe the holy spirit's given us more
[1:19:51] revelation we should be the leaders in
[1:19:54] modesty by God's grace not to be
[1:19:57] legalist now if I now here's what
[1:19:59] legalism is and I preached this on
[1:20:00] Sunday they were really blessed at Cam's
[1:20:02] Church legalism is anything excessive to
[1:20:05] the word of God in other words anytime
[1:20:07] you add to God's word that's
[1:20:10] legalism okay so if I
[1:20:13] said if I said men um you have to wear
[1:20:17] pants or you're going to hell that's
[1:20:20] legalism right I'm saying that go down
[1:20:22] to your feet if you you have to wear
[1:20:23] pants and go down to your feet or you're
[1:20:24] going to hell that's legalism that's
[1:20:26] excessive but if I said Brothers you
[1:20:28] have to wear pants that at least cover
[1:20:31] your thighs to your knees now that's
[1:20:34] scriptural praise God are you with me or
[1:20:37] if I said sisters your hair has to be 36
[1:20:40] inches down or you're going to hell
[1:20:43] that's
[1:20:44] legalism but if I say your hair has got
[1:20:47] to be long and uncut that's
[1:20:49] obedience are you with me church because
[1:20:52] some women can grow their hair long they
[1:20:53] don't have the genetic
[1:20:55] ability to do it all right but it has to
[1:20:58] be as long as it possibly can get and
[1:21:01] uncut that's what the word of God
[1:21:03] says but if I add to that that becomes
[1:21:07] legalistic but if we just keep what the
[1:21:09] Bible said we're not legalists because
[1:21:11] we're not adding anything excessive
[1:21:14] we're just loyalists can I say it like
[1:21:16] that Glory we're not legalists we're
[1:21:18] loyalist amen we're loyal to God's word
[1:21:22] and you got to apply that to murder you
[1:21:24] got to apply it to
[1:21:26] adultery you say well you don't murder
[1:21:28] you're a
[1:21:30] legalist no I'm a
[1:21:32] loyalist right I'm a loyalist you got to
[1:21:35] apply it the same way you must we must
[1:21:37] always obey the commands of God and love
[1:21:40] Jesus Christ we must never transgress
[1:21:42] Jesus never transgressed and he was
[1:21:44] never a
[1:21:45] legalist he never commanded anyone to do
[1:21:47] anything excessive than what the word of
[1:21:49] God said he said live by every word of
[1:21:52] the
[1:21:53] Bible not by anything additional just by
[1:21:56] every word are you with me church I'm
[1:21:59] not being legalistic if I say you
[1:22:01] shouldn't murder people you shouldn't
[1:22:02] commit adultery that's not legalism
[1:22:05] that's obedience that's loyalism amen
[1:22:07] that's being loyal to the word of God
[1:22:09] how many understand
[1:22:11] that legalism is adding something
[1:22:14] extra and then making that a requirement
[1:22:18] that's legalism so see I feel like I was
[1:22:20] getting kind of legalistic on that first
[1:22:21] video but I left it out there uh I
[1:22:24] didn't delete it because I still want
[1:22:25] people to find it for example like uh
[1:22:28] even though there's a mistake on it I
[1:22:30] left it out there because brother BR has
[1:22:31] all those a thousand sermons and
[1:22:33] sometimes there's mistakes on there they
[1:22:34] don't get rid of the ones that he made a
[1:22:35] human mistake on they leave it out there
[1:22:38] why because if you're truly led by the
[1:22:39] spirit of God you can't be
[1:22:41] deceived praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:22:45] they really like that the brother said
[1:22:46] well we were talking we were just
[1:22:47] talking about that yesterday that's
[1:22:49] exactly word for word what we were
[1:22:50] talking about I said Thank you must and
[1:22:52] I I looked at the church I said I didn't
[1:22:53] even plan to preach that
[1:22:55] and they admitted afterwards that's
[1:22:56] exactly what they were talking about the
[1:22:57] day before so thank God that's the Holy
[1:23:00] Spirit Discerning our hearts and lives
[1:23:02] amen so I'm just giving you that's my
[1:23:05] thought God can give us a revelation but
[1:23:07] then give us more information on it it
[1:23:09] doesn't change it it just gives us more
[1:23:11] details about it praise the
[1:23:14] Lord so that's just I want to lay that
[1:23:16] in there by God's grace how many doing
[1:23:17] on time okay I got about 13
[1:23:20] minutes now here's what the Ephesians
[1:23:22] did when they came across a OST Les that
[1:23:25] were not preaching the word of God they
[1:23:27] wouldn't preach this here's what they
[1:23:28] said they looked at those F false
[1:23:31] Apostles in the eye and said you are not
[1:23:33] saying what Paul
[1:23:35] said you are therefore
[1:23:38] false praise the Lord look how look how
[1:23:42] firm look how sure they were of what
[1:23:43] God's word was they could look in the
[1:23:46] face of false preachers now we're not
[1:23:47] just talking any lay member or a woman
[1:23:50] or child preachers people that came and
[1:23:53] say we're starting churches we're
[1:23:54] Apostles they would look them in the
[1:23:55] face and say you're not saying what Paul
[1:23:58] said
[1:24:00] Hallelujah this is the confidence a real
[1:24:03] Christian has in the written word of
[1:24:06] God he says oh that sets my heart on
[1:24:08] fire get back to the word it is not you
[1:24:12] really that tries the
[1:24:14] Apostle and prophet and teacher it is
[1:24:17] the word that tries
[1:24:19] them one of these days there's going to
[1:24:22] come a prophet to the lean Church age
[1:24:24] and you will know if he's a real one
[1:24:26] sent from God or not you'll know it
[1:24:28] Hallelujah yes you will for if he is of
[1:24:33] God he will be in that word exactly as
[1:24:35] God gave it to Paul amen Glory
[1:24:39] Hallelujah exactly as Paul was in it he
[1:24:43] won't deviate from that word for a
[1:24:45] moment not for by one
[1:24:48] iota in the last age when there will be
[1:24:50] many false prophets appearing watch and
[1:24:52] see how they keep telling you that if
[1:24:53] you don't believe them and what they say
[1:24:55] you'll be lost but when that last day
[1:24:57] Prophet comes on the scene if he is
[1:24:59] truly that prophet he will be crying out
[1:25:01] get back to the word or you are
[1:25:05] lost he won't build a private Revelation
[1:25:09] or interpretation but on that
[1:25:11] word amen and amen these are FAL false
[1:25:15] Apostles are the Grievous wolves that
[1:25:17] Paul spoke of he said once I'm gone they
[1:25:19] will try and come and claim equal
[1:25:21] Revelation but their purpose is not to
[1:25:23] help you but destroy you and that's in
[1:25:27] Acts chapter 20 let's read that since we
[1:25:29] got a little m a little time here by
[1:25:30] God's grace Acts chapter
[1:25:33] 20 oh I love these I love these words of
[1:25:36] God Amen I love this kind of preaching
[1:25:38] amen hallelujah acts
[1:25:45] 20:27 now I don't remember how long he
[1:25:47] was here but I was telling this to a
[1:25:49] brother after service I think he was
[1:25:50] here a year and a half or nine months I
[1:25:53] can't remember which one it was he was
[1:25:54] in Ephesus Paul was in Ephesus look what
[1:25:56] he says in verse 27 I just want to make
[1:25:58] just a point here for I've not shown to
[1:26:00] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[1:26:02] now whether it was a year and a half or
[1:26:05] nine months that's long enough to tell
[1:26:08] you all the counsel of God praise God
[1:26:11] Amen I like that
[1:26:13] hallelujah it's enough to hit the major
[1:26:15] highlights in the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:17] Ghost and preaching against sin and all
[1:26:19] the revelations all the powers of God
[1:26:21] all the Mysteries a year and a half or
[1:26:23] two years whatever it was is long enough
[1:26:26] to sit and hear the preaching of the
[1:26:28] word and you'll be accountable for it on
[1:26:29] the day of
[1:26:30] judgment that's exactly right I've not
[1:26:34] shun to declare you the whole counsel of
[1:26:35] God I've been pastoring here almost 11
[1:26:37] years I let me say like this I've not
[1:26:38] shun to declare unto you the whole
[1:26:40] counil of God either amen hallelujah the
[1:26:43] people that have sat under the ministry
[1:26:44] these all these years I've declared the
[1:26:46] whole counsel as far as I know by God's
[1:26:48] grace we should be able to say that
[1:26:51] especially if we're preaching on the
[1:26:52] baptism Holy Ghost because when you get
[1:26:54] that you've got everything amen glory
[1:26:56] when you got eternal life you've got
[1:26:58] everything Hallelujah that's the seed of
[1:27:00] God and everything that you need of is
[1:27:02] in that seat already amen
[1:27:06] glory so the prophet won't build on a
[1:27:08] private Revelation he'll build on the
[1:27:11] word of
[1:27:13] God John knew of them also for he said
[1:27:15] in 1 John 4:1 many false prophets are
[1:27:17] already gone out into the world that
[1:27:19] Antichrist Spirit was already
[1:27:20] infiltrating the church and it was doing
[1:27:23] it by going against the
[1:27:26] word why here it is where it all started
[1:27:29] right here in the first church age
[1:27:30] already they were denying the word and
[1:27:32] setting up their own Creeds and
[1:27:33] philosophies instead of the word that is
[1:27:35] Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be
[1:27:39] anti- is to be anti- Jesus how many
[1:27:43] believe that anything that goes against
[1:27:46] what's written here is Antichrist and
[1:27:48] the church said if it breaks any truth
[1:27:51] in here it's Antichrist
[1:27:55] and he said if you change one word of it
[1:27:56] you're
[1:27:57] cursed praise
[1:28:00] God to be anti word is to be Antichrist
[1:28:04] because the spirit and the word are one
[1:28:07] in Ephesians 6 Paul said and take the
[1:28:09] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:28:11] God amen glory the holy spirit is the
[1:28:15] word of God in action for wrote the word
[1:28:18] of God if you are anti- word you will
[1:28:21] have to be Antichrist and if it's start
[1:28:24] in the first church it will have to grow
[1:28:26] until the end when it takes
[1:28:28] over and that is exactly what you will
[1:28:30] see as we cover all the ages that starts
[1:28:32] out real small in the Ephesian age and
[1:28:34] it grows in every age until the anti-
[1:28:36] word Antichrist system takes over
[1:28:39] entirely and the infallibility of the
[1:28:42] word is repudiated by the false Apostles
[1:28:46] of the false
[1:28:48] Church all right now I want to insert
[1:28:51] this before I close I got a few more
[1:28:52] minutes I heard this quote the other day
[1:28:54] and or other week and I was so uh
[1:28:57] delighted brother brandham was God's
[1:29:00] Prophet but that does not mean he's
[1:29:03] infallible because he's not God I can
[1:29:06] show you and even I read this morning in
[1:29:07] act or Genesis 13 where Abraham lied
[1:29:10] about
[1:29:12] Sarah Abraham tried to guess and say
[1:29:14] well honey they're going to kill me in
[1:29:16] Egypt because you're pretty uh they're
[1:29:18] going to kill me so you lie and say
[1:29:21] you're not married to me so he so that's
[1:29:23] what happened he lied they both lied and
[1:29:26] the king of Egypt took her and God
[1:29:27] smoted his family with plagues and he
[1:29:30] said why' you lie to me get out of here
[1:29:32] and they kicked him
[1:29:34] out prophets make mistakes prophets lie
[1:29:36] prophets sin they they do now they're
[1:29:38] infallible when they say thus sayith the
[1:29:40] Lord that's the balance we got to have
[1:29:42] but look at this quote just have you
[1:29:43] heard this from key to the door have you
[1:29:45] heard this by the way brother said I
[1:29:47] have a letter that just come in the mail
[1:29:49] as Billy picked it up a while ago that
[1:29:51] some brethren are in Michigan and this
[1:29:53] comes from the ministeri of Association
[1:29:54] that's got a lot of things that's what
[1:29:56] gets things cred up you see that they
[1:29:59] claim in here that some men or Brethren
[1:30:02] up there that said that I sent them up
[1:30:04] there and they're preaching that men
[1:30:06] should leave their
[1:30:08] wives and hunt for their spiritual
[1:30:11] mate and that I am perfectly infallible
[1:30:15] so there's some preachers in Michigan
[1:30:16] that were saying Oh Brother Bram son us
[1:30:18] up here and you men can leave your wife
[1:30:20] and find your real spiritual mate and
[1:30:23] also brother random is is perfectly
[1:30:24] infallible he never makes a
[1:30:26] mistake look what brother Ram
[1:30:29] says that there's nothing and oh oh some
[1:30:32] of the awfulest things you ever
[1:30:36] heard to say brother brandom's
[1:30:38] infallible is one of the most awful
[1:30:41] things you've ever heard to make a
[1:30:44] prophet God is
[1:30:47] Antichrist you understand
[1:30:50] that and to say oh you can divorce and
[1:30:53] remarry again as much you one that's
[1:30:55] Antichrist are you with me and he had to
[1:30:59] deal with that he heard in fact if you
[1:31:01] listen to a few messages in 1961 right
[1:31:03] at the beginning I think it's Revelation
[1:31:05] chapter 4 part one brother brandom says
[1:31:08] he's leaving the field how many you ever
[1:31:10] heard that in 1961 he says I'm leaving
[1:31:13] the field because people are baptizing
[1:31:15] in my name saying that I'm Jesus Christ
[1:31:18] and he said I'm not going out anymore
[1:31:19] I'm just going to preach to the
[1:31:20] Tabernacle he said pray for me because I
[1:31:22] think I'm gon to go crazy he says
[1:31:25] now within a week the next week they
[1:31:27] repent of it and he's back on the
[1:31:29] field but that Spirit never died because
[1:31:32] people still worship him today that's
[1:31:34] okay they they bapti they tried to
[1:31:35] baptize in Paul's name too because they
[1:31:38] were such Mighty Men of God but see how
[1:31:40] Satan gets in there and tries to pervert
[1:31:42] it the awfulest thing you can hear is
[1:31:45] that oh it's okay to divorce and just
[1:31:46] marry all you want oh and brother Ram's
[1:31:49] perfect as well
[1:31:51] now some people say every word he said
[1:31:54] was thus sayith the Lord I don't agree
[1:31:55] with that I personally believe that's
[1:31:57] one of the most awfulest things you
[1:31:58] could say I could be wrong but that's
[1:32:01] what I believe because of this right
[1:32:02] here to say every word he said was thus
[1:32:05] say the Lord would mean he's
[1:32:07] infallible and brother Ram say that's
[1:32:09] one of the most awfulest things you have
[1:32:11] ever heard to make a man God outside of
[1:32:15] Christ because Christ is God
[1:32:19] Amen it keeps going and the Ministerial
[1:32:22] Association got a hold of it and they
[1:32:23] writing me a letter about it and that I
[1:32:25] sent up there and it's causing a lot of
[1:32:28] confusion see this causes confusion when
[1:32:30] people say things that aren't the
[1:32:32] truth praise
[1:32:34] God and some of them prophesying and
[1:32:37] saying that one man should leave his
[1:32:39] wife and go marry another that's just
[1:32:40] the spirit of lust are you with me
[1:32:43] church that's the spirit of
[1:32:45] lust and it's breaking the word of God
[1:32:48] the Bible said a man should be married
[1:32:49] to his wife until death do they part
[1:32:52] they're bound as long as they both shall
[1:32:54] live to their vow that they made they
[1:32:56] stood there before God and before
[1:32:57] preachers and before family and said
[1:32:59] I'll be with you till death do us part
[1:33:01] and they're Bound by that they'll answer
[1:33:03] for that on the day of judgment if they
[1:33:04] don't keep that word not legalism but
[1:33:07] loyalism amen I got a new word there I
[1:33:10] got look that up and see if that's a
[1:33:12] real word huh see now see they're acting
[1:33:15] all spiritual well I've got thus sayi
[1:33:17] the Lord for brother Jesse he can
[1:33:18] divorce and go Remar
[1:33:21] liar
[1:33:22] Antichrist not an apostle not a prophet
[1:33:25] because it goes against the word of
[1:33:27] God brother Ram's perfectly infallible
[1:33:32] liar you're not saying what Paul said
[1:33:35] Glory are you with me
[1:33:37] church and he said now this church knows
[1:33:40] that we don't stand for such Tommy Rod
[1:33:42] as
[1:33:44] that so now you know what false Doctrine
[1:33:46] is Tommy rot it's rotting
[1:33:50] trash rotting trash false Doctrine like
[1:33:53] that it's Satan disguised Satan
[1:33:55] transforms himself as an angel of Light
[1:33:58] Behind the pulpit or an angel of Light
[1:33:59] with a gift of prophesy or some type of
[1:34:02] Angel some light giver but if that light
[1:34:04] don't shine on the word of God get rid
[1:34:06] of it it's false light Hallelujah we
[1:34:10] must stay with the word of God I got a
[1:34:13] few minutes here how many is that raise
[1:34:15] your hand if that's quotes new to you
[1:34:16] anybody is that new to anybody okay okay
[1:34:18] praise hope that was a blessing by God's
[1:34:20] grace so you know brother Bram never
[1:34:21] said he said that's awful to say that
[1:34:24] I'm
[1:34:25] infallible that's awful that's awful
[1:34:27] thing to say it's Tommy rot don't
[1:34:29] believe kind of stuff like that all
[1:34:31] right is that help by God's
[1:34:33] grace all
[1:34:36] right I just thought I'd put that in
[1:34:38] there I just put that in there yesterday
[1:34:39] I thought well I think the church will
[1:34:40] like that by God's grace I think they'll
[1:34:41] appreciate that don't you appreciate
[1:34:43] that I appreciated that when I heard
[1:34:45] that so I thought you would too amen all
[1:34:48] right
[1:34:50] now and we got a few more let me see
[1:34:52] just a few more slides I want try to be
[1:34:54] timely here okay yeah I got uh let's
[1:34:56] just do one two four
[1:34:59] more you bear with me I've never
[1:35:01] preached like this before so I hope I
[1:35:04] hope it's okay with everybody like I've
[1:35:06] I rarely just preach quote quote quote
[1:35:07] quot quote I usually go scripture
[1:35:08] scripture scripture and then a few
[1:35:10] quotes but I thought this is so critical
[1:35:13] this book is so important because the
[1:35:16] Holy Spirit warned brother brandom to
[1:35:18] write it so the people know what kind of
[1:35:19] hour we're living in and ese now all the
[1:35:21] ages are important but especially
[1:35:23] Ephesians
[1:35:25] and Le oia because it's the beginning
[1:35:27] and end and we've got to go back to our
[1:35:31] first love so if we can see how sin came
[1:35:33] in the first church age it'll help us to
[1:35:35] keep sin out of our
[1:35:37] lives are you with me this is how it
[1:35:40] comes in people start bringing false
[1:35:41] lights and you got to stand there and
[1:35:43] say that's not what the Bible said I
[1:35:46] don't care if it's me or anybody else
[1:35:47] you come up and say that's not what the
[1:35:48] word of God says if it's me then you
[1:35:51] come see me right after church you don't
[1:35:53] have to knock on the door just come in
[1:35:54] there and sayi brother Jess I got to
[1:35:56] talk to you I got a question for you is
[1:35:58] that exactly right what you preach I I
[1:36:00] don't want to be wrong I want to be
[1:36:01] right by God's grace I'm not pouring my
[1:36:04] heart in life and this to be wrong or
[1:36:05] deceive anybody or to be rich or go
[1:36:07] after women or go after power I'm
[1:36:08] pouring my heart in this because I love
[1:36:10] Jesus Christ and I preach to five people
[1:36:12] I preach to two people I'll preach to 40
[1:36:15] people I'll preach to whatever I got
[1:36:16] because I love preaching about Christ
[1:36:18] he's my Lord and Savior and if he saved
[1:36:19] me he can save others amen that's why I
[1:36:22] preach to save souls to point to the
[1:36:24] Cross amen not because I want to be
[1:36:26] somebody I want to be what Christ made
[1:36:27] me to
[1:36:29] be now he said it's easy to get a wrong
[1:36:31] impression of what we're talking about
[1:36:34] because I'm making such making this so
[1:36:36] strong now it could sound to you as
[1:36:38] though this Antichrist spirit is a
[1:36:40] complete repudiation of the word that
[1:36:42] means the total rejection of the Bible
[1:36:44] in other words he's saying the
[1:36:46] Antichrist spirit is not saying oh we're
[1:36:47] just going to do away with the bi the
[1:36:49] whole Bible that's not what it's saying
[1:36:51] he said it's just to change one word the
[1:36:53] Antichrist Spirit just wants to change
[1:36:55] change one word are you with
[1:36:57] me see it's a denial of the Bible
[1:37:01] culminating in its rejection no sir it
[1:37:03] is not that it is what Revelation
[1:37:05] 22:18-19 says let's read that you got it
[1:37:08] real quick there Revelation 228 and
[1:37:11] 19 praise the
[1:37:14] Lord boy that's nice I can just do that
[1:37:16] glory and then the live streamers get to
[1:37:18] see that too praise the Lord now verse
[1:37:20] 18 for I testify to every man that
[1:37:22] Hearth the words of the prophecy of this
[1:37:24] book If any man shall what let's say
[1:37:26] together shall add unto these things God
[1:37:30] shall add unto his him the plagues that
[1:37:32] are written in the book verse 19 and if
[1:37:34] any man should take away from the words
[1:37:36] of this book of the prophecy God shall
[1:37:38] take away his part of the book of life
[1:37:40] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:37:42] things which are written in this book we
[1:37:45] cannot add to the Bible and we cannot
[1:37:47] take it away most churches today Church
[1:37:50] take away the Bible they take away the
[1:37:53] about women and how they should dress
[1:37:55] and men and how they should act they
[1:37:57] take away the part about the
[1:37:58] supernatural they take away the part
[1:37:59] about the prophets they take away all
[1:38:01] the part about uh the godhead and all
[1:38:03] these things like that they're
[1:38:04] constantly taken out but we're but we
[1:38:07] got to be careful not to add to it
[1:38:10] amen by God's grace Of course takeway as
[1:38:12] well but I'm just saying we we we we try
[1:38:15] to really with all of our hearts just
[1:38:17] say what the Bible said and we got to
[1:38:19] make sure we don't add to it got to make
[1:38:20] sure we just say what it says all all
[1:38:23] right three more by God's grace I'm
[1:38:25] trying to be mindful of the time it is
[1:38:28] the changing of even just one word by
[1:38:31] taking away or adding it adding to it it
[1:38:34] is the original trick of Satan the
[1:38:35] Garden of Eden he just added one little
[1:38:37] word to what God had said that did it it
[1:38:40] brought death and destruction and in
[1:38:42] Ephesus it was just the same just a word
[1:38:45] added just a word taken away and the
[1:38:47] anti- word Antichrist Spirit began to
[1:38:50] flourish remember Satan just added a
[1:38:53] knot he added a not Thou shalt not
[1:38:55] surely
[1:38:56] die and that caused the all the fall all
[1:38:59] the C all the all the ambulances uh that
[1:39:03] ever rang out their their alarm uh all
[1:39:05] the babies that died all the disease it
[1:39:07] was all caused by adding one word to the
[1:39:09] word of God it's exactly right so the
[1:39:13] Antichrist spirit is not just throwing
[1:39:15] out the Bible it's changing one word of
[1:39:18] it he starts off changing one word and
[1:39:20] then he grows and grows and grows in the
[1:39:22] lives of the those who are
[1:39:25] deceived all
[1:39:27] right
[1:39:30] now he said do you get it now there are
[1:39:33] there are those two twins again there
[1:39:35] are those two trees again growing side
[1:39:36] by side in the same Earth partaking of
[1:39:38] the same nourishment drinking in the
[1:39:39] same rain and benefitting by the same
[1:39:42] Sun but they come from different seeds
[1:39:46] one tree is for the word of God exactly
[1:39:48] as God gave it and loves it and obeys it
[1:39:52] how many love the word of God
[1:39:54] how many obey the word of God you must
[1:39:56] be the right tree amen because the real
[1:39:59] tree of God loves it and obeys it praise
[1:40:01] God the other tree is from the seed that
[1:40:03] is anti the word of God and changes it
[1:40:06] where it wants to well I don't like this
[1:40:08] they're too hard on this or they they
[1:40:10] don't they shouldn't preach this and
[1:40:11] they change it they change how it they
[1:40:13] make it however they want it they
[1:40:15] basically make their own they make the
[1:40:16] Bible
[1:40:17] Buffet well I'll just take this I'll
[1:40:20] just take that if God does have a buffet
[1:40:22] then you're required to take every part
[1:40:23] part of it amen
[1:40:25] glory but see the denomination they make
[1:40:27] it the buffet well I'll just take a
[1:40:28] little bit of this I'll take the sweet
[1:40:30] stuff I'll take the the the good taste
[1:40:32] and stuff and they don't take all of it
[1:40:34] we got to take all of it amen that's
[1:40:38] right it substitutes its own Creeds and
[1:40:41] dogmas for the living true word exactly
[1:40:44] as Cain did who ended up killing Abel
[1:40:46] but fear not little flock stay with the
[1:40:49] word keep that word between you and the
[1:40:52] devil
[1:40:54] amen Eve did did not do that and she
[1:40:57] failed and when the church lets down on
[1:40:59] the word she goes into the depths of the
[1:41:02] darkness of Satan let's stand to our
[1:41:03] feet praise God we must keep the word
[1:41:07] between us and the
[1:41:12] devil that's where Eve failed and that's
[1:41:14] where they always
[1:41:18] fail
[1:41:19] Glory now I know I preach a little hard
[1:41:22] tonight but uh just a little hard not
[1:41:24] too hard not as hard as I preach this
[1:41:25] week can but uh I try to explain some
[1:41:28] things about legalism do everybody
[1:41:30] understand that amen legalism is adding
[1:41:32] to the word but Jesus never broke a
[1:41:34] command of God and he was never a
[1:41:35] legalist because he never added to the
[1:41:37] word he was a loyal Son of God the Son
[1:41:41] of God and that's what we must be I hope
[1:41:43] you understood that by God's grace now I
[1:41:45] want to just show real
[1:41:48] quick uh can everybody see that okay
[1:41:51] yeah there we go
[1:41:53] I want to see if this will work
[1:41:55] here I want to just uh show real quick
[1:41:59] how we know brother BR was a prophit if
[1:42:01] it will let me play I don't know if
[1:42:02] it'll let me play it or
[1:42:03] not because I got I got live stream
[1:42:06] going I'm trying to stream the video so
[1:42:08] maybe that's too much on it I just want
[1:42:09] to show a few quick things about how we
[1:42:11] know brother Brandon was a prophet he's
[1:42:13] not infallible as far as
[1:42:18] sinless but he predicted three things
[1:42:20] that we can easily see have come to pass
[1:42:23] I guess I'll just pause it
[1:42:25] here and I'll just go back here that's
[1:42:28] some awful picture my Mercy the three
[1:42:32] things he prophesied he said the he
[1:42:34] prophesied of the immoral condition of
[1:42:36] the United States church and he said the
[1:42:38] United States Church would have people
[1:42:40] all smoking dancing to rock and
[1:42:43] roll uh drinking women cutting their
[1:42:47] hair uh women wearing uh makeup and sexy
[1:42:50] clothes and undressing wearing what less
[1:42:52] and less all the time isn't that what's
[1:42:54] going on in churches today he prophesied
[1:42:57] that back in 1965 and look what we got
[1:42:59] today every church that's Mega has a
[1:43:01] rock and roll concert going on he
[1:43:03] predicted the immoral condition United
[1:43:05] States churches he also said thus sayith
[1:43:07] the Lord uh he said no denomination will
[1:43:11] ever break up its denomination and come
[1:43:13] back to the word of God and you show me
[1:43:14] one that has none of them have the
[1:43:17] Catholic hasn't come back Lutheran
[1:43:18] hasn't come back Methodist Nazarene
[1:43:22] Pentecost Pilgrim h Hess none of them
[1:43:24] come back and he said they never will he
[1:43:25] said they'll take the mark of the beast
[1:43:27] thus sayith the Lord that's still
[1:43:28] standing after 50 years praise God that
[1:43:32] tells us he's a prophet and the last one
[1:43:34] he said there never rise a Ministry to
[1:43:36] the Gentiles greater than his
[1:43:38] ministry and that has stood no preacher
[1:43:41] has ever come along with a greater
[1:43:42] Ministry than that that brother brandham
[1:43:44] had how many you understand that by
[1:43:46] God's grace that's how we know he's a
[1:43:48] prophet every time he spoke in the name
[1:43:49] of the Lord it came to pass and so we're
[1:43:51] thankful for that our job must be to
[1:43:54] stay with the word keep the word between
[1:43:57] us and Satan and we'll be Overcomers how
[1:44:00] many love that by God's grace let me
[1:44:01] pray for you let's bow our heads here if
[1:44:03] you have a need just you're welcome to
[1:44:04] come up here while we sing brother
[1:44:05] amen's got some songs he'd like to play
[1:44:07] so brother just make your way there by
[1:44:09] God's
[1:44:10] grace we thank the Lord for that thank
[1:44:13] the Lord for his Mercy let's just bow
[1:44:15] our heads and we have prayer for our
[1:44:16] brother here by God's
[1:44:18] grace Heavenly Father we love you
[1:44:21] tonight Lord I just sometimes feel a
[1:44:23] little uncomfortable because I usually
[1:44:25] don't preach like this just all quotes
[1:44:26] all quotes but Lord as we said you sent
[1:44:30] your prophet he had four years to go
[1:44:33] over these thoughts and start teaching
[1:44:36] and combing the scriptures and laying
[1:44:38] out truths from Genesis to Revelation
[1:44:41] and we are privileged to read the
[1:44:43] comment commentary of a prophet of God
[1:44:47] on Revelation chapters 1 two and three
[1:44:49] and so Lord we don't shy away from that
[1:44:51] we want to say thank you
[1:44:53] and Lord I don't know who in the church
[1:44:55] has invested the time into really
[1:44:58] seeking you and understanding these
[1:45:00] things and hearing the warning of the
[1:45:02] holy spirit in this
[1:45:04] hour your Holy Spirit said write it down
[1:45:07] so the people will be
[1:45:08] warned they'll know what hour we're
[1:45:10] living in Lord we're seeing what hour
[1:45:12] we're living in right now anyone that
[1:45:15] exalts their idea above the word they're
[1:45:17] Liars we don't want to add to it we
[1:45:19] don't want to take away we just want to
[1:45:21] say exactly what it says
[1:45:25] Lord I thought of all your prophets Paul
[1:45:27] and Peter and John they had so many
[1:45:29] miracles but when they wrote letters to
[1:45:31] the church they would constantly warn
[1:45:33] them about false teachers and false
[1:45:36] prophets because
[1:45:38] Satan gets in so deceptive and so slick
[1:45:41] and and Sly as we heard on Sunday with
[1:45:43] our
[1:45:44] brother Lord let us be mindful let us
[1:45:46] have spiritual eyes let's not go to
[1:45:48] sleep spiritually let's not get tired up
[1:45:50] upon these truths that we know may we
[1:45:53] continually let them wash our lives
[1:45:57] clean let's remember that every
[1:45:59] Christian goes through trials every
[1:46:01] Christian must suffer every P Christian
[1:46:03] must be teased and mocked and made fun
[1:46:05] of and rejected but Lord through it all
