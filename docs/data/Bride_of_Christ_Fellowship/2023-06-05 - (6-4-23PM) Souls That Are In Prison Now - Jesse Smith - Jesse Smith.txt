========================================

spot start there as I told you this morning I'd like to preach on Souls that are in prison now just kind of preach through the whole sermon that brother Brandon preached I'll probably get about a third of the way through tonight Lord willing we'll kind of see how things go you know sometimes it turns out different than you think it's going to go but after all these sermons just on the Bible the Bible and I pull in a little bit of brother Branham I like to just kind of go through some of his sermons and just get kind of deep into some of his teachings here we normally don't cover I told Jose before he left I said brother I'm going to preaching a little bit on the third poll tonight so I told him I said well you can listen in if you want I said you might like that topic and just for Lena since it's new to her the third poll is basically the third phase of brother Brown's Ministry he just had a vision where it was like he had he was fishing three times so a poll is like you know pulling in the line the fishing line you know it's kind of like the third phase of brother Adams Ministry and how and he connected it to the bride as well oh so we'll look at this here tonight by God's grace Jude 1 5 and 6 Jude one five and six Souls that are imprisoned now it's been kind of strangely drawn to this sermon the last few months I've been listening to this one off and on and yesterday I went through it and I took a lot of notes on it so we'll be looking at that here tonight since we have three of them I'll read the first two and then I'll read the first and the last we'll read the second because the last week we already read this morning Jude 5 6 says I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitations these are the angels that became demons some of them he hath reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day so brother Ram noticed he says notice how the angels are reserved in Everlasting change there's some angels that are in Chains now no that's a that's an interesting topic I don't know a lot about that but the Bible says it and it's connected how their souls right in prison right now in the heart of the Earth right the little lost souls in prison okay let's read this one together though second Peter 2 4 and 5. there's a lot of wonderful things in this sermon by brother Brandon there's a few things that people misunderstand so I want to go over those that's part of the reason to go over it II Peter 2 4 and 5. and we can all read these together here by God's grace it's a little bit longer but if you can hear everyone's voice so to read read this on three one two three for if God spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to Hell and deliver them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but save Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly so again we see Angels right delivered into chains of Darkness reserved unto judgment so again we see angels that are in prison now okay then the last one I read this morning uh first Peter 3 18 19 and 20. I'll read that one for Christ also hath the once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit here's the the main thought by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison of course those are lost souls in the prison in the heart of the earth and what brother random calls the region of the Lost verse 20 which sometimes were disobedient when Once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark wasn't preparing where and few that is eight Souls were saved by water let's have one more word of prayer if we can hear it tonight by God's grace if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God I don't want to pray for Lena's sisters again Kyle Emma's travel as well here father God we thank you Lord we come into your presence with Grace and just worship to you Lord our all of our songs are for you Lord Jesus we thank you God for all you've done all your goodness you Porta upon us we want to come back and recognize it Lord thank you for your goodness and your mercy as we saw this morning thank you for salvation by grace alone Lord God not by works but Grace that no man would boast so we thank you and give you praise and now Lord this message is kind of the opposite Lord God this is this is the the warning if if people don't accept your Amazing Grace and try to earn it by works or go against it in defiance as as haters of God lord we never want to see people do this but Lord many many do because you said few there be that Friday so God I pray God you just guide us tonight Lord here by the word of God help me to to preach your word and Lord we also want to remember Emma she travels let your angel be with her Lord God protect her that she can get home enjoy her family time Lord God also be with Lena's sisters Lord God it just seems like Lord if you don't change anything we just got to keep praying how we love them we love to see them move here Lord God and become a part of the church but Lord we're just asking that your granted in your time and season in the meantime protect their lives Lord God let this be for a testimony for Venus Faith the church's Faith Austin's Faith we're all believing together that their souls can be saved and they could come to this church lorder some church that believes the truth Lord grant it dear God lastly we pray for Kyle Lord thank you for his kindness and I just pray God that his heart will open to the truth of your word and Lord the message is for him because the messages come out of her my people Lord God granted Lord Jesus if he's one of yours I pray you bring him out Lord God I thank you for this wonderful opportunity to be here thank you for 17 years Lord with these Saints all these Saints in Jesus Christ name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I do have some slides here like to show here we read our texts from Brother Branham here and I'll try to maybe just preach an hour like I said I want to get to I want to get to today I want to get to Four Points I think I'll just back up here I just if I had a title just Souls that are in prison now the first out of four or the first four important observations just been kind of drawn to this sermon I found a lot of good things in here then some things that are you know brother amps Human Side that we want to rightly divide you I want to rightly divide this sermon like we have to with every sermon has many truths but there's also some statements that are misunderstood and I'll just go straight in the order of the sermon like I said I've been doing a lot of just straight Bible teaching and bringing a little bit of quotes well this one's going to be mostly quotes and a little bit of scripture uh but it'd be good I thought it'd be a good refresher too to look at the third poll because I haven't talked about that I haven't preached about that for a while and I think it'd be Lena's first time hearing about the third pull so I I don't know I don't know how much you my children have in case you have you heard much about the third pole okay so yeah I haven't I haven't preached on it for years I mean the last time I preached on it I forget I think it was 2016. I was looking at it yesterday so it's been a while so the first thing with this sermon as you if you haven't listened to it it's November 10th 63 so it was let's see it was eight months after the Seven Seals were open and so brother Brown said he was just presuming in that's not I shouldn't be if it should be in he was just presuming in November of 63. um he was he was wondering uh was the hour of preaching was this the hour of preaching to the Eternal lost in other words brother bran was wondering if anybody could be saved anymore and there's a scriptural reason for that we see it in the Bible I won't get to it today but there was a time when Noah and his family were in the ark and no matter what they said no one else was going to get saved and then you know you have revelation 22 11. I'm just going to read that you've got your Bible you can read that with me there does come a time when no one else can be saved revelation 22 11. he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still so there's going to come a time here at the end time when no one else is going to be saved of course our hearts break for that moment but it's happened in many many cases I was even thinking about Sodom and Gomorrah think about that Sodom and Gomorrah you know a lot couldn't save any more other than his three daughters or was it two daughters two daughters and his wife that come out and then his wife was lost um so they were preaching basically to the the Eternal lost so there's going to come a time and thank God it's not now thank God it's not now because we're still getting saved right people are still getting saved um but there there will come a time when this will be happening and even I believe the foolish version I believe they'll already be saved once they cross over the Rapture once of course they won't go in the Rapture but once they cross over the raptures pass and then they're in the tribulation I I don't see how they can be saved anymore they've already got to be saved right because God has now moved officially to the Jews he's raptured his bride the Gentile dispensation is over so it's a uh it's quite a subject so just so you know this whole sermon was a presumption brother random says it himself I'm not I didn't say that brother I'm going to read you the quote brother says I'm just presuming in this sermon so you have to be very careful and then it's sad that people can take this sermon and make it like nobody else gets saved and he just said I'm just presuming okay because he thought oh because of the experience he had at JCPenney we'll talk about that that's part of this here he had this experience um so here's how he starts this morning he said something struck my heart about a month ago that was the experience at JCPenney where it's like hell was blending in with the Earth um but we'll get to that in a moment here if you some like I know Lena hasn't heard that story but Brother Band constantly had vision and so there was so many Visions on tape and we got to take every Vision back to the word of God right we talked about that he says are they taping this yes so I want uh so that I would know where if the tape gets out to others I can't say that I'm going to speak on this morning I can't say it is I know it's right see the message part will be right but the thing that I want to do is a question in my mind it looks so real what are you saying it looks so real that time might be over first for people for people to be saved and yet since I come in it was revealed to me I have been so scared now look he's scared he's scared going to the pulpit then I'd say the wrong thing it might leave the wrong impression upon the people he says what I had notes wrote down or what I was going to say I cut part of it out so that I might not make it too strong because you see if a person I love the Lord God and the only way I love him is because I love you see so if you love each other then you know you love God right that's what the Bible says how can you love someone you can't see if you can't love the people you can see that's why it's so important to love people in this church right that proves you love God Hallelujah he says that's the only way I know yet I don't want to have anything that's revealed to me and not tell you if it's to tell you in church that's why you know when we do the uh when we do the kids Bible study I'll share things that I'll never share live because I want you to know everything I know that will help you in this life's journey sometimes I got to call names sometimes I gotta I just give examples dear friends and brothers or sisters in Christ or whatever you know sometimes I just got to be really plain because I want you to know everything I know so you're prepared for the coming of the Lord right and many times I say that you know so you'll be prepared for any trial or Temptation that might come so you'll be able to overcome that because the the last thing we want anyone to do is to Fall Away we want everyone to stand in the faith right and if I see people fall away and I know why they fell away then I'm going to tell you because I love you and I don't want you to fall away so brother Brown was the same way any Revelation he had he wanted to share with the people because he loved them okay so that's what this sermon is about sharing this experience he had in the JCPenney store it would have been October 63 because this is November 10th you can see it up there November 10th 63. um he doesn't want to hurt anybody he said you just have to almost just get to the platform and then feel led to say what you're going to say that's all and then sometimes you might say something and someone will get another slant to it they'd run off on that side then someone would say oh this is this see now look here's where he says it so does everybody know this I'm not making this up brother man said but I want you to know that what I'm saying is just presuming and the word presume means to Adventure without Authority so I don't say that this is true but it's just a little thought that I might drop along to you that you might weigh it out and see what you think about it now look he says it I'm gonna let you just make your own decision about it and then it'll of course it'll be scriptural because I wouldn't preach nothing now he's talking about the scriptural aspect of Noah having to preach the Eternal lost a lot had to preach the Eternal lost Jesus preached Eternal loss we see this idea of Believers preaching to the Eternal lost okay now there is a balance to it I want to get to it maybe in the next part I'll get to you know I think there's a I think there's a better balance because if you if you think about it every real believer at some time is preaching to eternally lost people right didn't Jesus tell the Pharisees your children of the your children of the devil you're two-fold more of the children of the of the devil than your fathers because you you made them twice as as devilish as you are right so and they were and then he said who will warn you to flee from the wrath of God that is to come who will save your soul from the wrath of God like they were already eternally lost so there's a certain balance of this that no matter what age you live in the preachers are going to be preaching to the Eternal lost now not you've got not this church because you're saved I'm talking about people that be like Jesus they call Jesus the devil so whoever would call us Devils sometimes not all the time but sometimes uh would be perhaps the Eternal lost right because Jesus had to deal with that they called him beelzebubble they were the Eternal lost he was the Eternal Son of God I should say Eternal Son of God I should say the Eternal uh Eternal God and flesh Eternal God and flesh so Bob Ram is presuming that's why this sermon is very important when you listen very closely and at the end church you can hear the people they're crying at the altar because they think time might be over and they they're begging God that their children will be saved and their loved ones you can hear them you know preaches as a presumption he said is time over because he was seeing so much happen in his life in his ministry having so many visions he says here's a question but is that hour yet has this arrived to this hour that these things meant that I pray with all that's within me that it isn't now look he's praying I pray that it isn't right and that that that this isn't that hour it's going to be at some point right but has it has it come to that time yet see see that's what I wonder now everybody understands thoroughly that I don't know is this a time if it is God be immersed with us but if it isn't that time then it's going to come so there's going to come a time when no one else is going to be saved that's brother Ram's point he's making here okay now I want you to see here's four times brother I'm talking about this sermon after he preached it so you understand his whole point of preaching this so this is uh what three days later New York he said you can stop the messenger but not the message and the Bible said he ascended into hell and preached the souls that were in prison that were sometimes disobedient and there his last message was to the doomed now I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna get to this later but Jesus actually did have a Ministry after that right because he come up and ministered for 40 days so that's where you got to balance that Olive Jesus had more Ministry to do right he had to show himself alive remember to to the 11 and the women he had a Ministry so that's why I feel like this is a this is a very scriptural thought like preaching internal loss but I think brother random didn't have enough time to really go into it because Jesus had a fourth part of his ministry he came back right he came back to Earth for 40 days so just something to consider because that wasn't his last message you know he was still preaching after that he was preaching to the the people that saw him after he resurrected now here's why he taught it though it'd be awful to think now that some of these days that people would be going on preaching just like they did in the days of Noah they'd be going on just the same but to a doomed world that's already the doors is closed okay we don't know what time that might happen so if you're not a Christian tonight think real hard give it a serious thought in other words brother Adam just wanted people to be saved before the door closed that's why he preached his sermon he wanted people to get saved before you couldn't get saved right in other words before they crossed the line of mercy and judgment here he says it again in Shreveport a couple weeks after this and the last name that goes on the book or the last name that's redeemed that was put on the book that settles it he clo I'm sorry he comes to claim what he redeemed and it might be a strange time did you ever think people go right on preaching the church will go right on even thinking they're getting people saved it's too late then it's all over see and the message will go to the totally lost just like it did in the days in Noah seven days in the ark okay then you're good he ties inside him there I missed that there I should have highlighted that but that's a good thought okay so let's be warned he said just don't stand around let's do something about it if we're not if we're not right with god let's get right with God now here I think he says it most plainly I love this this is a really good quote even a month later oh God our father today there's Hungry Heart still left on Earth why little Bethlehem in my poor unlearned way Lord I've tried to let this little group which loves me I know they do Lord and I love them and I want them so much till I love them so much till Lord I'm zealous of them so his brother I was zealous for people to be saved I don't want to see them mixed up in these great things and get cut off then when it's too late and see them poor souljandra in prison and know at once had the opportunity so I love this because brother Rama is zealous for people he doesn't want to see them in the readings of the Lost he wants to see them in heaven okay all right and then he talks about he just mentions this and who is this Melchizedek that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany he's just talking about Jesus changing you know from theophany to flesh back to theophany um okay now after brother man reads his text he teaches on the soul it's a beautiful teaching the soul is not the body man it's the soul see and the soul is is the nature of the human spirit and he goes off on this I taught on that a number of years ago about the soul he says man is in God's image man has a dual nature a body and a spirit so flesh and spirit God's nature must come in you though by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and each Must Die to his own human nature that's in the soul right and of course in the mind we've got to Die daily to our sinful desires praise God now I put this up there for uh Kyle but Kyle I I changed the sermon before so we had a visitor this morning brother bang and I don't want to preach on this because it might just go over his head too much you know I don't want to drown him in brother man who I want to hear Jesus Jesus Jesus that's why I thank you for letting me preach Romans 4 this morning you know I didn't want to drown out our visitor with quotes about brother Ram because he just doesn't know who he is now here's a second observation brother Brown says any Jew outside of Israel's backslid now I'm not sure about that that's why I want to bring this up you know it just says I listen to these sermons I find so much good but then I find things I wonder about you know or things uh brother man may have corrected later like right now I think I'm at 87 on 87 things brother man either changed or just got wrong you know like he would just cite the wrong scripture you know just to show he's human and just these people you know on YouTube They just they think I don't believe in brother Brandon as a prophet and I preach Brothers a prophet every sermon and I'm like you guys just don't and so some people they just hear whatever they want to hear like you can't you can't change what people are going to decide all you can do is tell the truth and then let the spirit on them and guide them whether it's a holy spirit or Unholy spirit I just you can't worry about it you just got to tell the truth and keep telling the truth the whole time just keep telling the truth but the reason I bring all those out is to show how insane the Jeffersonville people are that's why I bring it out but people just can't I don't know that you can't see it I think I believe that brother man was more of a prophet than they believe that they even worship brother brand but I think I believe brother Ram the right way I think they're wrong I'm I think I'm the actually one who believes in brother Brown the right way of course we are but it's so sad so brother says any Jew that leaves their promised land is backslid because God gave that to them and promised them to stay there see and they left it so he went down into career but it hadn't been for that end quote now I guess you know Daniel was he forced to leave he was forced to leave the promised land and Esther was probably born in needs of Persia in Persia and Mordecai I don't know he might have been born and probably saying we don't know but I don't know were they backslidden or you know so does brother Adam mean anyone who's outside the prophesied in his back son or just the people that purposely leave the promised land I don't know we know Abraham left the promised land and he was backslid that's where he made the lie to the king of Egypt right so it's just interesting you know uh and then when God manifest himself so powerfully to Daniel if he was backslid you know Daniel seemed like a tremendous man of God right very faithful man of God again God's seen the god seemed to vindicate that he was not backslid so just some observations here just some things to think about um uh brother Rams talks about you know the truth sometimes is like a Razor's Edge like here's the truth but then you know something could be off just so so close it's so close to the truth but it's not the truth that's how this is well when they just leave on their own or they're forced to leave or if they're just out of the promised land are they backslid you know it's it's just it's just a good question to have it's a good question um now here's where brother Adam says Daniel wasn't backslid this is in 57. he says now he said when you go go like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel they purpose in their heart that they would not defile themselves no matter what color went no matter whether the rest of the church back said what happened they purposed in their heart there we can see those four were not backslid according brother Branham so I just thought each other now the third thing third observation did God tell Abraham to marry Hagar I don't think so and brother Ram says he makes it sound like God told Abraham to marry Hagar I don't think he did I think what brother man meant to say was by foreknowledge God knew he would okay so here's where he says it see it's hard to understand that see but if it wasn't that we wouldn't know what Grace was why did he go and marry Hagar after having a lovely wife like Sarah and he didn't want to see but Sarah told him and then God told him you listen to what Sarah told you see those are things I catch right because church we should have a buzzer right we should have a discernment buzzer and it should go off every time right I don't think God ever told Abraham to marry Hagar so see this is where brother he's just human right he's just doing his best because here's what the Bible said there's no mention of God telling Abraham to marry Hagar Sarah said to Abram the Lord hath restrained me I pray they go into my maid and Abraham Harkin to the voice of Sarah now there's nothing in here where God says oh yeah you go ahead and listen to her see so that's where the Bible says now here that's where the Bible says search the scriptures right Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and what did what did the Bible call the bereans the Bible call them more noble than those in thessalonica why because they searched the Scriptures Daily whether these things were so so Church it makes us more spiritual brother Bang it makes us more like Christ when we take everything brother Ram said back to the word of God my wife reminded me of that so thank you this week this week she reminded me of that yeah thank you thank you so humble huh yeah but really Church no all joking aside we're more spiritual when we take everything back to the word to make sure that's the truth because we don't want to be deceived and I'll say like this we can't be deceived amen praise God we might make a mistake here and there but we're not going to be deceived by the devil right the Bible said they can't you can't be deceived now here's yeah it seems God only told Abraham to cast out the Bond woman God never told Abraham not I'm sorry God never told Abraham to marry Hagar that was all Sarah and that must have been Abraham's lust or Abraham's human desire I don't know okay so uh Sarah said to Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son because remember Ishmael was making fun of Isaac oh you little baby now you're weaned and you're just a little baby making fun of the promised child right the promised son and it was very Grievous in Abraham's sight and so God said to Abraham uh hearken yeah and all that Sarah said unto you hearken unto her voice now here's an interesting thought I shared with Jose so let's get some more uh more discernment going on here can uh in the church age book brother Adam says the elect cannot persecute the elect but how far do you take that because Paul was elect and he allowed the persecution of Stephen how about King Saul was elect but he chased around David for years okay so you got that thought there's something else that you want right and here we now we know by this um we know by this the prom sorry the elect won't so how can I say it Ishmael was not the elect as far as the chosen one of God Isaac was right so Isaac didn't persecute Ishmael Ishmael the the the son by the flesh persecuted the son of the promise okay I don't know if Ishmael was saved or not I don't know it doesn't look like it but um I mean could be I don't know so I don't even know if you can use Ishmael and Isaac as a type of the wise and foolish virgin or not I don't even know that because I don't even know if Ishmael was saved I'd have to do read some more on his history but I don't think so so to something else to consider there by God's grace see just I pick up on these things as you as I listen now here despite brother I'm being wrong about that statement that God told Abraham to marry Hagar we understand the point brother Brown was trying to make he was trying to make the point that Ishmael and Isaac were a were a uh allegory right I think we used it a couple of weeks ago at the Sunday School the Sunday night Sunday school it was types and allegories yeah types of allegories a type is a foretelling of one a specific event and allegories just where two things represent some or something represents something so this was the allegory the Bible said Abraham had two sons one by the bond maid other by the free woman but he was of the Bond woman Ishmael was born after the flesh but here the free one was born by promise Isaac which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one which is from Mount Sinai which generate the bondage which is agar so we know that under we understand that now so Ishmael is the type of the law and Isaac is the type of the New Testament Grace okay so that's the point Brothers trying to make he just made a simple human mistake church I get stories mixed up in the Bible all the time and the church said okay see so you know I'm human right so we know brother I'm human we know all men are human right anyone outside of Jesus is going to make mistakes Christ never made a mistake never will but humans will make mistakes okay now after this program gets right into this story leading up to the JCPenney story he tells his short life story where he was born and everything until he was accidentally shot I think it was Jim Poole at 14 years old and he almost lost both of his legs because all the the bullets that was parts of the bulls that were in his legs he almost lost his legs so he's he just got shot he's in the hospital he tried to go to sleep he said I woke up something splashed and here was his own blood half a gal and he was laying in his own blood the the shot from the bullet was so close to the artery on either side just a little scratch would have cut it right in two he'd start bleeding well I thought this is the end of me I put my hands down like this and raise it up and the blood was running down my hands it was my own blood I was laying in now what a place to be and he's not even saved yet what a place to be in 14. now this gives it a little thought too God gives him a vision about going to hell could a 14 year old go to hell I don't know now the wrong uh the the Mormon Church our friend Mr Hasam I think they they say they have thus saved the Lord I think eight or seven is the age of accountability can you imagine that like if someone doesn't accept Christ by seven or eight they go to hell if they die that's really that's it's really strict no one knows the the the time though the age of accountability but here's brother random at 14 years old not even saved laying in his own blood we didn't he's uh here's this is another reason why this sermon is important brother Branham says the KKK which were awful Wicked people and the Masons which reject Jesus Christ as God they paid for his hospital bill and he says I can never forget them this is where people will take this and they'll say see brother random like the KKK that's not true he just recognized that they paid for his bill right so this sermon has a lot of good in it but then it's got a lot of human stories in it too he said they paid hundreds of dollars he said I can never forget them no matter what they do there's something and that stays with me see what they did for me so whenever somebody shows you kindness it stays with you that's the point he's trying to make not trying to support the Masons or the KKK we would never support any of those demonic institutions right never we never sport in those but he just recognizes they did something nice for me the no he's okay so he's in this surgery uh and he has a vision the first vision is the one where he's falling like he's going to hell and then he has a surgery I think a month later he says and then he has a second Vision so we'll go through this first Vision I think uh here so he has two visions one's about hell and the other one's about receiving Glory out in the west which is the type of the Seven Seals it's a beautiful picture so in the first Vision he was in a trance I thought I was just in hell now here's how he describes it oh no I'm sorry seven months later after the first surgery he had the second operation and then here's this here's his second mission the first Vision was about hell the second vision is about going out west he said I had another Vision there was a great Golden Cross in the sky and the glory of the Lord flowing out of that cross and I stood with my hands out like this and the glory was falling into my chest I like that Hallelujah the vision left me my father was sitting there looking at me when the vision came okay so that's the second mission you had after the second surgery to take out the shot out of his legs because he almost lost his legs he almost had to uh he said they almost had to amputate both of his legs and he said if you do that just amputate me right here he said which is a a joke for just just kill me right because I don't want to have a life without legs he said but now God's healed me so thoroughly he said I have such great strong legs by the grace of Christ amen so this is a yeah so this Vision I believe this Vision I believe brother Branham received a uh here when he was a 14 year old boy was a foretelling of him receiving the revelation of the Seven Seals because brother Adam says the Old Testament writer Moses had to be drove from his People Into the Wilderness to get the inspiration right the Old Testament and in the New Testament the writer Paul Paul wrote the majority of the books was drove by the author into the desert place to get the inspiration to write the New Testament and the books are sealed with Seven Seals it would also require the same I believe in these days to open those Seven Seals amen did you catch that so brother Adam says I'm just like Moses and Paul I'm a prophet I had to be driven out to the wet out west of the Wilderness to get the inspiration of the Seven Seals amen that's why people say you know God gave the Revelation to the Old Testament to Moses Revelation New Testament to uh Paul and then uh the Revelation brother random to tie it all together with the Revel with the Finnish Mysteries that's why people say that because brother man makes this statement he received the glory and it's likely the spirit's inspiration to preach the Seven Seals because remember Jesus is the only one who can lose the Seven Seals but the Lamb made it known to the seventh angel yes I told you I'm going to get into some message terminology here tonight right so we're seeing that you know dreams and visions and experiences maybe not found in the Bible if he was a genuine Prophet we got to take him back to the word and they got to match up with the word all right sorry because it's cold tonight here so but the first Vision was uh the region of the lost where brother man said he felt like he was falling so now he says the purpose of this message the souls are in prison now is to pose the church in everything he'll let me post to the church as far as I know as I go along so you want to just share this Vision with them or this experience he had out in JCPenney in October 63. he want to share it with the people how it connected to his previous Vision when he was 14. and after the vision struck me I was so weak I lost all the blood he said I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity so here he has a vision of Falling In Hell many of you has heard me tell this before I was sinking to the endless eternity and I was going through like clouds and then through darkness and sinking down down now this reminds us of the bottomless pit in Revelation chapter 19 I think it is or is it 20. where Satan's cast into the bottom of spit I think it's maybe 20. let me just get the right verse in the kid yes 20. yeah verse 3 20 verse 3 children just you know that's when Satan's cast in the bottomless pit okay he says uh and the first thing you know I got into the reasons of the loss and there I screamed and I looked and there just about everything there was no Foundation to it I could never stop falling for eternity looked like I was going to fall there was no stop in nowhere and then what a difference it was from the vision I had not long ago of being in glory with the people the contrast in this I was falling I finally screamed for my dad of course being just a kid that's what I would do I scream for my daddy my daddy wasn't there and I screamed for my mother somebody catched me but there was no mother there I was just going and I screamed then to God there was no God there there was nothing there now that's interesting because David said God would be in hell if he made his bed in hell but that might mean something different right so I think brother Adam's experience was different than what David was writing about if David met his made his bed in hell God would be there I'm not sure I'm not sure what that means okay so I I don't know but there was no God there now church we know this though God is Everywhere by foreknowledge right but in this case program said he felt like there was no God there so I don't know maybe maybe just God doesn't allow his presence to be felt in the regions of the lost but by foreknowledge God knows everything that's going on there right if he doesn't he's not God but he has to know so again just some interesting statements and we've got to try to understand them by the best best we can and then brother random felt like that hellish Dimension that same Dimension he felt the regions of the Lost he felt like it was also come up to JCPenney okay and this was in Tucson Arizona in a JCPenney store in October of 63. so let me I'll just kind of shorten this a little bit so I went upstairs and I sat down and when I did there was an escalator it was in a JCPenney store and the escalator bringing the people up well I really turned sick at my stomach seen those women come up there young old and different wrinkled young everywhere those little bitty little bitty shorts on I think about the little bitty shorts they have on today I mean my goodness it's it's ten times worse today if not more like we were just at Chipotle with Lena and it don't look like they have clothes on it's like they're spray painting clothes on that's that's how tight their clothes are he says their filthy body and those sexy dressed women with those great big heads like that now she talked about the big hairdos they used to have like the Jackie Kennedy Heritage really big none of our sisters use those hairstyles thank goodness and one coming right off that escalator just coming right up like that where I was sitting back in a chair sitting there with my head down and I turned and look and one of them coming up the steps saying ooh Spanish speaking to another woman she was a white woman speaking to Spanish women and when I looked brother snaps his finger all at once I was changed there I had seen that before so brother man goes through some change I don't know if like the dimensions Blended I don't know if he went to another Vision like a vision popped up he's saying these women come up the escalator and they look like women that are actually in the readings of the Lost he says because they got the colors they got green and their faces blue on their faces all the crazy makeup he said that's what a cankered person looks like in the readings of the Lost he said her eyes you know how the women are doing now painting their eyes just like like cat you know put it up like this and wearing cat glasses and everything you know with eyes up like this and the green stuff under their eyes there was that thing that I seen when I was a child there was the woman just exactly and I just got numb all over began to look around and there was those people mumbling you know going on about the prices and things in the building and I said honey he says I'm almost as a dead man and she said what's the matter are you sick I said no something's just happened now she don't know so brother Adam didn't even tell the vision to his wife because he wanted to tell the church all of his Visions first that he said that's a promise he made to the church he said she don't know she's waiting for this tape to return I've never said to nobody and I thought I'd wait as I promised bring it to the church Mercy bring it to the church that was my promise and you'll realize after tonight the reason I try to keep my promise he and then them canker looking eyes so the woman with the blue and the green around their eyes and the eyes of the paint they run back like cat's eyes and them talking there I was again standing there in JCPenney store back in hell again so friends I don't know exactly what happened I don't know if you know that God let that Dimension come up for a little bit or God brought just a vision down from heaven and you know brother random saw their conditions like these are one of some of the ones that are eternally lost I don't know exactly what happened he said I got so scared I thought Lord surely I haven't died and you've not and you've let me come to this place after all so the women's faces and the way they were dressed reminded him of the canker condition of what he saw people look like in the regions of the Lost that's quite a quite a thought okay and now this would be my final thought right now I'm going to preach a little bit longer I don't know how I actually didn't set my timer I wanted to preach on the third poll because brother Ram connects this Vision to the third pole and that's why I've said over the years Church well I haven't mentioned it too much over the years I guess recently I guess I appreciated earlier in my Ministry but there's numerous access aspects to the third poll so let me give you three one aspect of the third poll is speaking the word and doing Miracles or Supernatural That's one of them we'll get to that today a second one is the opening of The Seven Seals right program got the sword of the king and he said now you're going to open the Seven Seals for God the third one is this the preaching to the Eternal lost I guess I can throw a fourth in there latter rain later rain is a fourth thing connected to the third pole so there's four Ministries all connected to the third poll and remember the third poll is brother around his final Ministry and then he says he says I don't say the Lord's telling me this but um the third pole will operate greatly at the time of the Rapture the latter rain but he said the Lord didn't tell me that he said I just feel like it is so see people banking on that they can go too far and what if it don't happen they'll be disappointed well does that mean they'll be in the Rapture or not I don't know I don't know so what are you trusting are trusting in Supernatural are you trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ what are we trusting in the only absolute thing we have is the scriptures about the latter rain that's only it because that's what the Bible says the latter rain right so you know it just takes a lot of a lot of patience it takes a lot of long suffering a lot of wisdom um a lot of Grace you gotta we gotta be great gracious so now brother Ram connects this Vision about JCPenney store and uh his vision as a 14 year old kind of come in together all come together he connects us to the third pole he says his wife come up and he said just let me alone a minute honey if you don't mind I just want to go home are you sick no just go ahead if you got any shopping news she said no I'm finished let me he said let me take you by the arm see I walked out she said what's the matter she said Mita something happened up there he felt like he was in hell again now Church let's be honest and some of these rides we'd have over the last few years right and some of these gatherings of gay and lesbian and trans it looks like hell it looks like hell they hate God it looks like hell on Earth right and that's exactly what brother man was seeing now think if he could be in our day think what would he say today oh my goodness what would he say today and then he says while I was under that I thought this so he's under that shock and Something's Happened to me he's under that uh that vision and he says what day are we living in could this be the third poll now I've got some notes down here now next time I preach on this I'll pick up where his notes his notes are start with Jesus preaching the Eternal loss and then he goes through all those scriptures about that we read in the text about angels being lost and Angels chained up and souls that are in prison now and all that we'll go through all that next time Lord willing but I want to finish this sermon with the third pull thoughts okay by God's grace it'd be good Refresher anybody even remember last time I preached on the third poll do you remember brother Bank do you remember darling okay so nobody remembers all right neither do I son okay so I want to leave Souls that are in prison now and I want to finish with this just an overview of the third poll especially okay Lena stepped out but she and uh Austin can listen to this later if they like just a base let me give you just a timeline of the overview okay so brother man pastored I think from 1933 to 1947 or 46 some people say 46. to me it doesn't matter the point was he pastored right actually might be 46. I have to look it up but whatever year Billy Graham became famous and Oral Roberts brother Branham started that either that earlier that same year or the year before because everybody can prove that by the newspaper articles and everything like that so it's either 46 or 47. but brother Adam said his first poll was the sign in his hand so brother man would take somebody's uh hand in his hand and then he'd look at his hand and it would have dots on it from what the brothers say and once he memorized the dots he know what Spirit they had or what disease or infirmity they had okay that was the first poll and that was and the first the first two uh polls were his first two signs that God gave him just like Mo God gave Moses two signs right the sign in his hand and then the sign of the staff now two years later the second poll manifested brother Adam said in in Regina Saskatchewan LeBron said a man came up and then he just knew all the thoughts and he saw the vision he and he told him the thoughts intents of his heart that was the second poll this is a that's a powerful testimony I mean you can just turn on brother Brandon I mean it's powerful like I told you I was listening to communion 1957 I think I was listening to that because Zur had asked me a good question about that a few weeks ago and brothers says how many got prayer cards he said okay we're not doing prayer cards I'm just gonna start and he called nine people out he told nine people their their names their addresses and where they live and their their sicknesses who can do that nobody can do that and the people are crying and you hear the you hear the faith of the people rise again you can hear Faith rise I want to get that on recording I want to send that to the The Junction City Saints because they don't they don't quite know what it feels like to have like Faith rise and everybody's singing everybody's shouting everybody's praising all those are great moments amen that's that's God pouring out his spear on the whole church all right every now and then you know one person will get it two people get it but it's awesome when everybody's under that anointing praise God Amen and that's what that and I met people like I met one or two people on tape that have had brother random discern them right now they've passed away but so the first poll 47 second pole 1949 now in night it wasn't until 1956 that brother Adam even calls them polls at first he just called them signs and then he has visions and the angel shows them these are actually polls or phases of your ministry polling in the Saints pulling in the fish right Fishers and men pulling them in so brother I didn't even say the word third pole until 1956 after his first two polls have already started okay so he didn't get the terminology until 56. it's actually January 1st 1956 where he says that okay so fast four I can't really draw hands I don't know why he says fast forward to uh 63. brother random preached Christ in the mystery of God revealed and he ends the sermon by saying look it's two o'clock now look he must have preached that must have been like a four-hour sermon now see I've never preached four hours to you all right he says look it's two o'clock the end of the second poll he says the third poll is on its way and then on August 25th he preaches perfect faith and he has that long prayer line I don't remember I preached on that years ago brother man it takes an hour to pray for almost every person they come to the prayer line and then he says now how many of you already feel an instant change in your body said look at those hands he's like over 90 percent of the people had almost instantaneous and he says what is this this is getting us ready for the third Bowl in other words Faith just by the spoken word of God right God's God's giving in other words God doing Supernatural works by the spoken word he just said he you can hear him he just says he says uh uh you're healed by Jesus Stripes he said I lay my hands on my sister in Jesus Christ's name let my sister be healed and they just go for an hour it's just an hour of they're singing The Great physician and praying and he says this is coming into that third poll so brother man was expecting a time of Great Mighty Miracles before the rapture right he thought that would be like the latter rain right that's what he thought and he for him it was called his third poll of his ministry now brother random died of course before the Rapture right some people say we're in the Millennium now you're wrong about that I don't see any uh wolf lying down with any Lambs right don't see it they just misunderstood quotes and then church four months later on December 29th 63 he says the third poll has now been Vindicated that it's here okay and then he gives five examples some of them were from before 1963. so the third poll had been in operation for a while but now here at the end of 63 now you can recognize wow the third poll has been operating then he gives us five examples of it okay that's a real brief overview there's other Visions in here he has Visions about a baby shoe trying to get the baby shoe through the latch you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things then he has a dream about fishing and how he his first two polls he made mistakes by trying to explain it I mean there's so much to this topic it's it's an extremely in-depth death topic but then the angel said you made a mistake on those first two but you won't make any mistake on the third pole he said don't say much about it and so brother Brown doesn't say much about it right with the third poll he just says I'll show I'll show the quote later with the third pull he says you have to wait till God leads you to speak the word of God you can't just wake up one day and say you know tastes like a nice day I like to speak squirrelsome to existence or something you know or I'd like to speak uh you know for the farmers I like to speak rain into existence today will that be nice but is that God's will so he said he didn't explain as much about it like he did the first two polls because that the angel got upset and said you caused a lot of fanaticism by trying to explain everything my brother man said I'm sorry I'm a stupid man of course he wasn't he was just being humble you know just being humble but he said don't say much about that third poll okay now here's where he says in 1950 that the first sign started manifesting three years ago okay so 1947 was about or 46 would have been about the time of the first sign the bumps in the hand and the color the colored dots now did you know this I think I have this oh no here's the next one here's where the angel met brother Brandon for either 46 or 47 he said the people won't believe me because I'm not educated sufficient to speak to people and the angel said you'll be given two signs as the prophet Moses one sign will be that you'll detect diseases through your hand when the people contact you well you'll be able to tell them what diseases they have through a supernatural discernment and then said if you'll be sincere then it will come to pass it you'll tell the people the secrets of their hearts and the things that they've done in life that might have hindered their healing and so forth right and so these first two signs end up being the first two poles of the three poles or the three phases of his ministry okay now here's where he says this is in Souls that are imprisoned brother random says that the second Paul manifested he said up in uh Regina Saskatchewan before several thousand people there it was he said their second poll just manifested like that okay now now I'm jumping back here I'm jumping back not to 1956. here's the first time he makes mention of the third poll and then he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent now this is where there's a lot of ideas about the this is called the tent Vision how many ever heard the tent Vision before service brother I'm seeing it this is what he says he's seen a tent it was packed and lined everywhere with people and I walked out looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an altar call hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior and I looked and then I heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and people begin to line up over on this side the left from where I was looking down towards the platform and they lined all the way up and down the street for Carolina notice to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I seen that light and all they that had the picture of you know that that's always in the meetings I seen that light leave me so brother ends up looking down the light leaves him and goes to that building and then the voice says I'll meet you in there that'll be the third poll I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came to so the first two polls were out in front of the public right he would discern he'd take him by the hand and discern you've got TB or you've got whatever problem you got cancer the second poll I see Visions I tell you the thoughts and intents of your heart Secret he said but the third poll I'll meet you in this little wooden building okay now brother Randy Cyrus years ago when we were at the Waterloo Place preached this quote to me and I was like oh I needed this quote you know because I didn't understand the third poll the angel told Brother Branham what the little wood building was it was a place of Prayer it wasn't a natural building you Saints know that after brother Branham died some of the people that worshiped him they bought a huge great tent expecting brother bam to rise from the dead and they were gonna they had planes ready they were gonna fly brother random around the world because he said I got to ride this Trail again he had he had different dreams and missions and we laugh now but these people were they're just insane they were random worshipers they didn't pray I mean I laughed I have too much avocado people think that like I how could they think that and now they've all died and it shows they misinterpreted the quotes they worship Brothers rather than taking everything he said back to the word and just waiting on God brother random said the angel told him he said I don't know what's going on in that closet like that he said is it not written by our Lord when thou praise be not like the Hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father or seeth in secret and he who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfectly to the scripture every time it is it's beautiful I've always told Brother Randy I've seen him a couple years ago I said thank you brother for sharing that quote that just meant so much to me because I didn't know if it brother bang if we got do we have to go build a wooden building from other random to preach in one day you know is he gonna come back is he gonna come back you know because there's another dream brother or a man had a dream of brother Brandon he was on a white horse he looked dressed up like an Indian he said I'll ride this Trail again well we don't really know what that means brother Jose's got an idea he shared it with us a couple years ago I just think that it means brother Ram's gospel his gospel message the Bible revelations have to go around the world again and that because that's what's happened I mean it's been what 50 57 years his brother man passed away 50 58 years yeah come in December it'd be 58 years since brother man passed away well what's happened his message has gone to all the world seems the most logical answer right rather than brother is going to come back oh yeah they even had a white horse waiting for him brother they had a white horse and the white headdress yeah brother Perry green knew people that had he knew he knew the men that had the plane ready the tent the wooden building they thought this was all going to happen natural but brother bear says the angel said it's like a prayer closet it's not a literal it's a literal wooden building and that's why church I think I shared it on Wednesday and Austin said that the the sermon meant a lot to him he said every dream and vision everything that we have we've got to wait on the Lord and take it back to the word see if these people have done that they never would have bought that plane and now that that plane is collecting dust or you know it's it's done like it's it's going to be junk unless somebody pays all these efforts and all that waste and time and money because they didn't take things back to the word of God they just didn't wait on the Lord and some of those people were just tape people they didn't have a pastor they just press play because and that shows they're breaking the word of God Ephesians chapter four with the fivefold ministry Gathering more as you see that day approaching it's people that break the word of God they don't pray enough they don't search the scripture enough we ought to be so thankful that we search the word of God hallelujah amen praise God thank God Amen that's why I love Brothers message because it points me back to the word of God hallelujah and now no man or woman can to see me right because I'll say well that's a good idea that might be a good story but let's take that back to the word of God let's see what God's word says about that even the third Paul even the brothers all this has to go back to the Bible somewhere in the Bible where if someone has three three parts of their Ministry right right so the man said of God Son of David we preached on that last year you know there's just you know there's three there's justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you can kind of see how there's phases of ministry and so I got to study more on that but everything we everything God gave brother Brandon there has to be a Biblical principle for it there has to be and there is but it's uh you know uh I'll just say like this you know at the end time every seed has to manifest of its own kind so I Rejoice that our seed is The Good Seed praise God hallelujah we got the good seed the seed of the king Hallelujah real faith in God's word okay uh okay that's the same thing that's that's kind of more of the same quote now I don't know if you knew this but I okay I got the book in there lady can you go in there real quick it's on my desk there's a book in there I gave everybody copy now I want to give this one to Zur if she wants it because she wasn't here when I bought it you get that brown book The Message companion can you see it there doing a good job holding the door open and getting the book so years ago I remember when I gave everybody a copy this sister you can have one and then Lena if you and Austin yeah it was before you guys came if you want I can order one for you in Austin it's a great summary of brother Adam's Ministry from the last six years of his of his ministry it's beautiful uh they got a DVD in there if you like uh some videos on there um but yeah I got I got there's a page that talks about the three poles of his ministry it has quotes on it but anyways January 11th 63 is when they calculated brother Branham had the vision of the getting the king's sword let me find it yeah here's the king the sword the king and it was right there in uh I don't remember the name of the the mountain might be rattlesnake fall rattlesnake Mesa or something like that Somewhere in Arizona I can't remember the name of that right now because I don't that's not my Ministry to study every detail brother Adam's life I preached the word of God I don't have his whole Ministry memorized um anyways they calculated it by the time I think January 3rd brother Ram left uh Jeffersonville to go out west God called him to go out west and then it would have been uh January 11th that he had this experience where he uh Christ showed him that he had the sword of the king and the sword is the word right the sword and remember Ephesians chapter six what's our last piece of uh armor it's actually offensive it's the sword of the spirit so church not only does brother Brandon have a sword you've got a sword too amen don't forget that you've got the sword too so it's scriptural to say brother Ram had the sword of the spirit because each one of us have it amen Glory but he had this experience and be based upon this experience that's why I believe the tent vision is fulfilled now let me say this you've got people in this message some people believe the tent vision is not yet fulfilled and so we've got to set up a tent and brogram's going to raise from the dead and we've got to go set up a tent he's going to preach and we're gonna have Revival services with brother Brandon I don't believe that one bit some people believe that brother random failed Division and there was never a um so the tent Vision never happened so I'm not in either of those groups I believe when brother Adam preached the Seven Seals that was the Fulfillment of the tent vision because God said I'll meet you in there and brother I met or brother man was met by an Angel or the Holy Spirit every day for eight days that's my humble opinion he said he spent all those hours in there praying reading his Bible he said walking up and down the floor Lord what's the revelation of this first CLA he just had to wait what's the Revelation the second seal he said and then he'd have a vision sometimes you have to go outside it was so powerful he said I just he said standing in the ball if I preacher here years ago but standing in the prince of that ball of fire he said your human body can only take so much of that he'd have to go walk out you know and just he said feel like I'm human again so to me you know people say oh brother man's Visions fail not that I found what I found is that brother man didn't understand it or some people other than didn't understand it but if we looked at the word of God and we looked to his life they're fulfilled that's what I believe Hallelujah now here's the quote so this is in the seventh sea of romance preaching he said now if it said a sword of the king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one king that's God and he has one sword that's his word what I live by that so help me God standing over this holy desk here with this holy word laying here it's the word amen so brother I am sword in his is his revelation of the word of God the Seven Seals he just got done he's he's finishing up on the Seven Seals oh what a day we're living and what a great thing you see the mystery and the secret the third he's gonna say the third poll standing there when this left me so when this vision of the sword of the king he said it fit his hand perfectly was feather Ed sharp he said oh my fits my hand perfectly when this Vision left me of the sword of the king he said something just came to me and said Don't Fear now I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke I just have to tell you the truth that's exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pole so on January 11th he had this Vision the third pole is this word and then two months later he preaches the Seven Seals right and the angel said I'll meet you in there in the third poll right for the third poll it'd be time of prayer it'll be consecration it won't be a public show not in front of the public it was just with their local home Church it wasn't a public show right like the other two wasn't campaigns it was just in their local church now to me that's just as simple that's to me that's just simple as one plus one is two or is it three I'm just kidding he said this is that third poll it's so simple to me why people I don't know why I guess it takes just humility it takes a revelation or something he said third poll you remember he said you've had so many impersonators of this the first two polls what you tried to explain but don't even try this see do you remember 100 numbers that Vision why it's been all over taping everywhere the vision of the tent like I read you earlier from 56. why it's all over the table that's been about six years ago seven years ago but seven years ago said don't try to explain to see this is that third poll but I'll meet you in there that's right he said don't try now this scripture shows how he was in there 560 it ended up being there eight days she was he was in prayer when the fifth seal came he said I was just out in prayer before Daybreak I was out in prayer and I just have set these last five or six days in a little room don't see no one now how many of us have ever sit in a room reading our Bible praying for eight days in a row I mean how many of us have ever done that I've never done that but this age the angel said I'll meet you in there in that private little room in a time of prayer and Consecration and this will be the third poll now it's got to be the Seven Seals it's got to be a memory of that Vision out west he's on the cross and all this Glory coming into him all this Revelation hallelujah praise God Amen remember out west he got the rebel what was Revelation he said go back to open the Seven Seals for God right so the inspiration was go back there and I'll meet you so we got that Glory got all that confidence the Lord's going to open the Seven Seals and he drove back and then the Lord met him every day for eight days in a row or eight or nine days in a row met him every single day to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals that's what I'm going to preach the Lord willing the next time I go to the Junction City Saints I'm going to preach in the Seven Seals because brother Irvin's like he's like you gotta get up to the church afterwards my brother Jesse said Seven Seals he said something leaped in my heart I thought Oh Glory you must be a saint because that's our message the message is the mystery of God is finished amen that's our mystery that's our revelation and I told her brother it's just the Seven Seals are just the anoint the first four seals just the anointings on the seven Church ages it's so simple all right so simple and then we get the the fifth seal which is the Jews Sixth Seal tribulation seven seal Rapture and all the time left before the new heavens and new earth it's very very simple now take some time to to digest it but once you once you catch it it's very very simple and and those unlock romance so those unlock those connect all the mysteries of the Bible together and they do especially the Jewish part that really unlocks everything because then we can see how people can be saved yet blinded to Christ right and then we know the Jews condition we know where they are they're Souls under the altar of incense in heaven and then there are souls right by the altar of Jesus throne in heaven there's there's at least two layers two levels in heaven at least right in the seventh we say the highest dimension all right now your brother I'm even admits when he preached the first seal he said I would have made a horrible mistake on that first seal if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock in the day when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something I was writing down to say he was going to preach it from an old context he said but then the Holy Spirit swept out in the room and the first seal opened up amen praise God hallelujah in that wonderful praise God a church that should be a reality in our lives Holy Spirit should come into our lives into our services and it should open things up to us so we understand right Allelujah like that's what happened we're out there in the point it's just it's just I just use it because it's the most recent example right but it's like when it's like when I preach on the dancing and remember you were worshiping brother and the Holy Spirit struck you right that's how the Holy Spirit could just come in the room and just come he's just come in a great way like that praise God and look he said I'll meet you in there did God meet brother Brandon in the room yes he said it right here he emits I would have made horrible mistakes if God hadn't met me in the room down there um and then he says you know at the seventh seal he also says there was lots of things happening that week he says I'm sure you noticed the little Collins boy was healed dying and that girl was healed in leukemia there was numerous miracles going on he said the kingdom of God is coming it's been coming more from the negative the positive as it has been we're drawing closer to God all the time and then he says I like to add this of all the service that ever had in all my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all my life in services now wouldn't that make sense if this was the greatest Services of his life wouldn't this make sense that this is the third poll of his ministry where the angel would meet him every day I'll meet you in there it won't be a public show before the people but I'll meet you in there I'll give you the revelation of the Seven Seals and this was greater than the first pole and the second Pole right does that make sense he says these are the greatest sermons but I was also in the little room for nine days or eight days and God met with me every day why can't people see it my it's just so sad people can't see it they think Brothers got to rise from the dead and we've got to have a little tent or they think brother man's Vision failed it's impossible don't fail we went through it the only time a vision could fail is if it was a conditional promise of God fail because of the if it's a mistake right brother Brown didn't fail this one right he met the Lord met him there and he preached the revelation of the Seven Seals and look there's over a hundred people being baptized and that Vision he said there was hundreds of people being saved and baptized we don't know how many got saved during the week of the Seven Seals but over a hundred praise God okay now let me see how much more I got to go here uh where am I at slide 61 where did I want to go oh my I want to go to 87. can I do it thanks sister Hallelujah some of these I'll just I'll skip let me let me skip through some of this this I appreciate that Hallelujah I feel pretty good I've actually I've been sleeping actually I was telling amen who actually been not setting my alarm the last few days I feel pretty good today I should be like I got some strength and energy but this goes back to that earlier slide I showed where I gave you the short timeline of the three polls so this is in Christ the mystery God revealed he preached I think for four hours in this sermon he says if you'll turn look at the clock look it's two o'clock the end of the second poll the third pulls at hand and then he says we took this song an octave higher the next poll is at hand amen so brother man kind of knew the third pole was coming on the seals had already been open four months earlier and then in perfect faith brother Adam I said prayed he did the out there's my 30 minutes okay brother I did an hour prayer prayer line of just saying you know the blood of Jesus Christ makes you well your made whole sister your brother Lord Jesus heal my brother the name of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus heal my sister in the name of Jesus Christ just for a whole straight whole hour and then he says I want to ask you a sincere question can you actually believe and feel now that there's something happened in you since you've laid hands on you raise your hand there it is this is what we waited for now look he said all these hands go up they already felt a change and they were sick in their bodies and after a prayer line they already felt the change all these people had felt a change in their bodies he says this is what we waited for this is just starting to bloom now see I did this for a purpose I'm working out something I'm taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it in that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith build it right in there watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than any two-edged sword and a discernment of thoughts and tens of the heart what we're coming to the Perfection because the people has come to this in order for the Rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come that perfect raptured Faith looking for it it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God okay so now again I don't know Church how much of I don't know how perfect we have to be for the rapture well the reason I highlighted this is that whatever we need to be God's grace will bring us there praise God right just like God's grace brought Enoch to the Rapture and condition we saw that on Wednesday just like God's grace brought Elijah to the Rapture and condition right he was a man subject to like passions like you and I always men same Passions right but God's grace brought him to be in the condition for the Rapture God is the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah praise God I don't know how perfect we're going to be but whatever we have need of God's going to bring us to that at the right time of the rapture now this is uh how many months later let's see this would have been four months later now here's where he's going to go in the five times he says the third poll is operated in his ministry he said I'm going to say something to you now that haven't said all along that is the thing that we've been looked for for so long the third poll has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is okay so back to that timeline in July he said we're getting ready for it right it already happened actually this because the Seven Seals were already revealed right you're just recognizing it and then in August the perfect Faith he says we're stepping into that third poll and now four months later he says it's Vindicated it's here and you know what it is and he precedes to tell five testimonies about speaking the word right just speaking the word so here's the five manifestations some of you might remember if you listen to that sermon Look Away to Jesus 63 he takes the first hour and goes through his thoughts about the third poll it's a great sermon to listen to you want to listen to me Sunny shimf which he has a candy store still it's in Jeffersonville I visited with brother Jose and brother William and we took pictures with those silly hats on so I got the proof on the slideshow I can show it to you he was dying and he was 45 pounds he was almost dead he was in some type of a plastic tent and brother bear had to dress up in the Hazmat suit or whatever and he had a vision in there he said he said he said you're going to sell me Red Hots again thus saith the Lord and he's dying he's 45 pounds he says thus say Lord you're going to sell me Red Hots again and he walks out and then a couple years later he goes in there to buy Christmas presents Red Hots and uh he says I'll take a bit of those Red Hots I love that story and he says Oh Brother Branham brother man says see it was thus saith the Lord you're gonna sell me Red Hots again so that's that's this that's the third poll speaking the word of God now that was in the 50s if I'm not mistaken second brother man squirrels I believe that was in 19 now that's why this is a good book sisters there and sister lean if you want one you can look up the squirrels I think squirrels was in 1960 if I'm not mistaken maybe I can find it real quick it was in the fall there's a silver tip grizzly but you get all these uh that would have been before that would have been I don't know if I can find it real quick now it must have been 62. or maybe 1960. anyways now okay I could probably find it for me oh no there's right there it's 59 okay there's a squirrel all right I found it 59. so this was mid 50s this was 1959 remember he said the third pole is already operating that was just three years after he had the vision of the third pole but he didn't know it was operating isn't that just like Jesus you know isn't that just like John the Baptist John the Baptist came and went and the disciples didn't even know he the scriptures that were fulfilled remember Jesus said he was a voice in the awareness he was Isaiah 40 and you didn't know it right so see how we see all this this is very scriptural God will be doing things and we're not even aware of what he's doing and we don't realize until later praise God right third how do you write now that's in here too I don't remember what year that was I have no idea on that one I think it's 62 or 61 if I'm not mistaken that's the one where she said that's nothing but the truth brother random about the squirrels and the Holy Spirit came on brother Ram said whatever you ask I'm giving to you right now in the name of Jesus Christ and if you don't get it right now I'm I'm a false prophet and he said she asked for the greatest thing you could ask for salvation of Souls that's why sister Lina you keep asking for the Salvation of your family don't ever quit on that that's the greatest thing you can ask for the fourth time brother man was out hunting with some brothers and they were way far out in the wilderness and they knew a storm was coming and they said as soon as you see that storm come in the snow you get back to camp and brother M saw the snow coming he started walking and the Holy Spirit said no turn and walk walk with me so then I said are you sure is that the God's voice or not because I'm gonna get buried in snow I'm going to be my wife's gonna be a widow if I don't get out of the snowstorm and The Voice come again said come walk with me so he turned to walked right into the snowstorm right towards the snowstorm and then the holy spirit said whatever you say it'll be that way now I'm just paraphrasing you can listen brother random brother brother Brown said he said in the name of Jesus he said it's going to be sunny now that storm is going to go back where it came from it's going to be sunny now until we leave this uh campgrounds and he said that's exactly what happened he said within a moment all the clouds and snow turned and went back he said they got to hunt the next few days so the third poll heals by the spoken word creates by the spoken word saved by the spoken word what Alters weather by this moment doesn't that sound like Jesus he said speak to the storm right he spoke to the storm right Moses created created by the spoken word thus saith the Lord there's going to be flies I'll say lord they're going to be fleas they'll say the Lord is going to be frogs he created by the spoken word and the last one was healing by the spoken word another healing by the spoken word when his wife had that tumor and Rhode Island was out in Arizona and prayed uh before his wife went into the the appointment and the Holy Spirit said stand up and he said whatever you say right now to be done for your wife he said before the doctor can the moment before he can touch the tumor it'll vanish it should be completely well and that's exactly what happened exactly what happened sister Mita was there to testify about it and uh so that those are the five times Brotherhood said the spoken word in the third poll had already operated okay we're at 4 30 all right now let me see here now here's where bunram says the third poll so this speaking the word is only operated by the leading of God and that's where it's real real difficult for us all right because even brother Brandon was like is this God telling me to walk with him here is this is this just my own imagination like what is like the still Small Voice we talked about sister all right they asked brother Branham they said brother Branham is the the third Paul is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and we'd be fully restored ready for the Rapture if you just speak the word and would you do this if properly pressed upon they asked brother Brandon and he says my dear friend now I think you got a good statement yes sir in other words um you're believing because of the spoken words and things that he said about all of you here Witnesses squirrels and things but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this that's why people the people that want to speak things in the squeeze or whatever like if they want to do it it probably won't happen to them right because brother Adam said I never asked for this it was God leading me to do it and even if there will be a squeeze like that we don't know if there will be a squeeze like that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you do this remember I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down to Egypt right but God sent him down there now I believe the Holy Spirit could come to me and say in a vision go to a certain certain thing they're trying to overcome a certain thing I'm going to skip down and would it take place absolutely yes it absolutely would I'd take place but now upon my presuming now presume means Adventure without Authority Now isn't that what the sermon's about souls are in prison now that's he said it's presuming see I'd go right down there to help this person I'm just presuming it'll be all right then I don't know I can call the name Lord over them I can pray for them or do whatever I wish to he says it was up to my power if I had the authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do those kind of things see I have the authority from God to do it but now when he gives the order she go back home well okay so we have authority over evil spirits we have authority over uh sicknesses diseases but the only way we know it's going to happen is if God gives us a actual thus saith the Lord for that right we don't know that's why you'll hear me pray If It Be Your Will Lord let it be done to court if it Be Your Will according to your will cause I don't know right unless God shows me something which never happened as far as Vision I've never seen a vision of that well maybe the vision when I got the Holy Ghost but not a vision of the future he said but first see no one even Jesus himself said the son can do nothing in himself but what do you see the father do that dude the son likewise we we know that Saint John 5 19. okay now here's an interesting thought too I'm almost done brother random felt the third pole would lay dormant until the time of the persecution before the Rapture if there is such a time and persecution for us if there is here's where he says it now we all know now he goes through those five examples that was a month earlier oh yeah just two weeks later he says we know what the third poll is we all understood that see you you'll have the tape that's the Look Away to Jesus and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly and now I think just wait see to see what it does okay so see brother Brown thought the third poll wouldn't be as active until the time right before the rapture so I understand the third poll is speaking God's word right because he said that in perfect Faith he's praying for them to just believe God's promise that will heal you um oh yeah and even after a perfect Faith he says this he says now do you love him just think right here now already begun to work in your body now look at that he just prayed for them and God's already doing the healing in their body of your healing because that he he promised it would happen and now see did you catch what I was saying tonight so brother I was under the surface was trying to get them to see a scripture and I'm gonna I'm gonna show it next have you got the riddle of it don't you love when preachers give you a riddle Simon's really good at that give us riddles he's like let me try to discern you with something or let me try it right he's done that before he said have you got the riddle of it see if you say to this mountain see don't doubt don't doubt but believe what you have said now watch in less than five minutes every hand went up that's a work had begun in them right now so they believe Brothers prayer so much in faith in the word of God within five minutes they were already starting to feel the healing come on them that's a pretty good testimony right there now what does this all go back to what is all this third full stuff brother Jesse you went on for 45 minutes about the third Bowl what's the third pole it's this right here brother man I said this is the riddle behind all this in other words what is this third pole program says at the time of the rapture we may have such an anointing that we'll just speak God's word and whatever we have need of in that hour God may give it to us that's possible it's very possible right but I have later on here I can't find one thus saith the Lord quote about it so it's it's brother I'm just presuming it's him thinking he actually says I don't say the Lord tells me this but I think it won't though the third poll won't be used in a great way until the time of the squeeze he says I don't say the Lord tells me this have faith in God Jesus said now the only way you can have faith is is as if it's a gift of faith like we said this morning the only way you can have faith for healing is if God gives you a gift here's the gift of your healing here's the gift of your healing God has to give you that gift first everything we receive as a gift from God we don't earn it we're not going to brag in heaven right there's no boasting in heaven so you just have to humbly wait until God gives us gifts in our life that's part of our testimony for truly I say unto you that whatsoever shall I'm sorry that whosoever shall say in this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saying now that's quite a promise therefore I say to you what things so ever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them what a promise right but then we know Paul died as a martyr John I'm sorry Peter was crucified upside down Timothy had often stomach's sake well what didn't they know this verse of course they knew this verse but you can't use this verse like it's a just your own toy in your pocket I don't keep I don't care I don't keep the third pole in my pocket I'll say that again so Brothers have said I like when you use that statement brother Jesse I don't keep the third pole in my pocket well I'll use it now I'll use it here I won't use it there I'll use it right here that's not that's not how it operates these scriptures were spoken and Paul could use them anytime so could Peter right but you can only use it as you're led to use it is this a good is this going to refresher tonight by God's grace now I'll close with this these are the three times I've spoken in the mountain and God moved in one of them I don't I gotta I gotta contact brother Mike I don't know I'll talk about that the first one was when I had a co-worker who couldn't get pregnant and uh my friend Debbie Lucas and I went over there and I did a Bible study and even some woman mocked me in the Bible study she's like Satan doesn't give us bad thoughts I just didn't say anything who was Vindicated to be right I was Vindicated to be right because they got pregnant she just kind of mocked me and made fun of me I said no there's scripture but I prayed for my co-worker and just one morning I was studying I can still remember at our house right now I just I just I stopped studying I got on my knees I started praying I was looking out the window and I just felt the power of God come on me I started weeping and crying I said I speak to that mountain of baroness in the name of Jesus Christ and I remember after I got started I went to my wife at the sink and I said honey I think I just spoke Something In The Name Of The Lord and I it might come to pass I don't know I didn't I was afraid I didn't tell anybody because it never happened to me ever like that before a few weeks later I got a text and there was her and her husband with the pregnancy test saying we're pregnant Jesse thanks for praying for us and I said glory and they had a little baby girl and then I ran into her in Fairlawn at the pulp the smoothie store she said I just had a dream about you about having another babies and I'm like oh no what he's a good dream or bad dream and I saw a third time she said we just had twins so she had a dream about me praying for them to have more babies and they had twins I can't explain that all I can say is that that's the first time I've ever spoken to a mountain ever second time was for hula and Zur and Bang's dad amen called me up at like seven or eight a.m on that Wednesday morning or whatever Tuesday morning and I went out there and I said I speak to that mountain of heart disease and I said he's going to come out of here completely well in the name of Jesus Christ and it happened and we just we just kept encouraging ourselves for weeks right to Speak Life brother but Jesse just speak life right and then bang had that Joan of Faith there by God's grace lying vanities lying vanities amen Hallelujah extra years with his family praise God all by the grace of God all by the grace of God extra window of Grace and then Tom Atkinson that was when Simon was involved in one of my best friends from high school called me and said my dad had a heart attack his wife uh gave him mouth to mouth and they had to shock him back to life very similar to Lee very similarly and he was in a coma and the doctor said he's got one percent chance just to wake up and Seth he's my friend Seth he called me up and said can you pray and I thought who can go pray for him Simon Simon Simon go pray for my best friend's dad or what not my best friend but one of my better friend and Simon got my text he said it was really late at night he said Simon said he went in his prayer clause and he said Lord he said if he's still alive in the morning I'll go pray for him and so Simon woke up texted me I said yeah he's still alive and Simon said he went and he said I was looking for signs God are you going to heal Tom or not he's a retired teacher and Simon said he saw all these signs like God's A Healer a guy like and Simon's Faith was raised up and so Simon got in there and my Heathen friend sat and listened to Simon tell testimonies for 10 minutes Simon preached for him for 10 minutes and Simon said my Heathen friend stood up and he said let's go pray for my dad right now and he's got one percent chance to even talk or wake up again that's how much God was anointing Simon and when Simon told me and Simon said Simon said he walked in there he said he said Seth your dad is going to live and all the doctors saying he's going to die and he's he's on uh he's on he's on the ventilator now when Simon told me that I'll be very honest I was very afraid when Simon told me that so I went my prayer closet that night and I started crying and I said Lord I said just something similar like this I said Lord I'm going to put my faith with Simons I said I feel how you I feel you've actually you've arranged these situations and I said Lord if you raise him up Tom Atkinson I said I'll tell him about brother Branham and so I was crying I said I speak to that mountain of that coma in Jesus Christ's name it's going to move and I forget how many weeks it was it might have been like you know your dad brother bank I don't know how many weeks but after a few weeks he woke up and then he started talking and then I got a picture of him on the last day he was in there he's still to this day completely whole and he had one chance to even live one percent and God turned it completely around now I remember I shared those testimonies in Napoleon and Mike and natania came up for netanya's back and I was just under that I was just crying so I don't know if it was God's anointing or not but I I said I speak to that mountain I think she had scoliosis or something like that so I need to always contact Mike today Lord winning after service I said I speak to that mountain of scoliosis I don't know if that's come to pass or not but she's at church she looks normal and healthy so I don't know and I remember when we prayed for Brian Hawkins Lydia you were there I don't know I don't remember if I spoke to them about it or not but I did use that verse where I spoke life his hips were degenerating and the the doctor said you got to have a double hip replacement and I said no that can't I can't happen to it he's 45. my uncle just had hip replacement he's in his 60s and I said brother can you confess all your sins yes something just come it just like the the sincerity the Holy Spirit fell on me and I said no we're going to pray right now we're going to rebuke that and then I was listening to Brother Ray I'm talking about the third poll two days later I was out weeding I Remember by the the blueberries I'm listening brother Brown I'm talking about the third poll and I get a text from Brian and said we don't know what happened he said but the doctor we went back for more scans the doctor said he's never she's never seen this before your degeneration has healed itself and you I don't need hip replacement anymore they said that's never happened before ever so I don't know if I spoke to the mountain or not but I did Speak Life okay and then remember the one about Jose I don't know if Jose spoke to the mountain but he told his niece she'd get pregnant and then the the next year the baby was born on my birthday tell you God has a sense of humor he really knows how to make us laugh and humble us so this is another reason why I know brother man's message is right because if I had not heard brother Brandon I never would have known those verses about speaking the mountain because that's the program majors on that like towards the end of his ministry because that's his ministry speak to the mountain he spoke to the storm squirrels how do you write you know you Sonny Schiff his wife's tumor speak the word but you got to wait for the right time of it okay no I want to yeah so I don't have any thus saith the Lord quotes third pull for the bride here's the only one now this one I wanted to show you but Ram said the third poll is so sacred I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself now look at that all those testimonies I had those testimony they speak for themselves because God does something Supernatural man can't do it I've tried to explain to others I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going of the way program thought it would be such on a greater scale right before the Rapture it could be I don't know it could be so let's uh let's stand in the promise we I'm sorry let's stand to our feet here we still have the promise musicians can come I will pick up on Souls that are in prison now I just wanted you to refreshing on the third pole it has at least four parts to it right I wanted to just have a good reminder every time brother random use the third pole it was God leading him to do it it wasn't what he wanted to do it was God leading him to do it okay so we know the same must be true in our lives it's probably good good spot to stop right there yeah I did have actually one more quote let me let me do one more here let's just start playing let me do one more here here brother Ram says it plainly that's what I'm saying is that church God may speak the word through you but you've got to wait for that moment right you don't know when it's going to come unless God will give you a vision or a dream right then that'd be like a vision like you know what's going to happen but you got to wait for these things to come to pass well the random said here's so here's what we need to work on as a church right we need to love each other too right that's really an important thing to work on but he said work on that pulsation that spare of the moment so that that moment where you feel like is God does God want me to speak the word he says like Joshua did Joshua spoke to the son and it Stood Still well how did he know it just happened right in that moment right how did I know about you know Tom Atkinson or how do you know about you know brother amen and his father-in-law when he called me how did I know I don't know I just in that moment how did Brother Graham no you know the Lord told him speak it right you got to just wait in that moment and Mary Magdalene all those I'm not sure about Mary Magdalene speaking the word I'm not sure just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it hold on to it the spare of a moment so we have to be aware of when God raises your faith in a particular moment in order to speak God's word now a good example recently was when Lena felt led to go pray for my wife a couple months ago remember that was like Lena like in that moment Lena like should I do this and she did and that was a real blessing to my wife so that's what I'm saying like this is just like a step of maturity like following the leadership of the Lord is not an easy thing right it's a we gotta have to Humble ourselves we've got to be very spiritual because what we don't want to happen is to speak to mountains and they don't move if that would happen then we got to say we're sorry right like that's why I need to go text brother Mike and I just remember that if not I got to say I'm sorry so it's a serious thing in other words God is speaking through us that's kind of like the third bullet God is speaking right through us and it's going to come to pass right like with all those times built around the five times they all came to pass okay so did you enjoy that tonight my God it's a little different than I normally preach right hope you enjoyed that good review on the third pull and just a bounce I want to bring a bounce to that to the tent Vision as well there's a lot in there I mean some preachers preach months on just the tent vision you can never do that for months on the third pole I don't think that's that's maybe not yet if God does lead us that way to the Rapture then we have to go that way but I just want you to be aware of that scripture Mark chapter 11. if God anoints you to speak the word of God then speak the word of God and then God's word cannot fail but until then we just ask the Lord If It Be Your Will that's why you hear me in the light If It Be Your Will It Be Your Will it would be your will because I don't know I wait for the moments when I'm highly emotional or highly sincere I start seeing things it's kind of like when I preach on David in the point like I'd seen all these signs David David like I just knew it and then God man it like God manifested like that was what God wanted to be preached undoubtedly it speaks for itself that service spoke for itself right and so as Christians we got to work on that moment we're recognized okay God's leading me remember did you spoke that word was there anything else working on you like do you listen to any sermons that week or anything that was got your thought or did that just come on you okay now I remember when brother amen got the Holy
