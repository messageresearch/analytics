========================================

for anybody I'm feeling kind of warm is it a little warm maybe amen you open that nobody thank you sir I put it at about 68 but then once the body's getting here we start praising the lord it's really warm real fast but better than that to have it cold right wouldn't want to come here and freeze icicles so we're thankful for God's gra thank brother am appreciate that Philippians 3 we'll read 13 and 14 like to preach part two as I said on in 2024 we press toward the Mark I've have just been uh so blessed by these quotes from brother Brandon uh about how he approached the new year and then today we'll look at I think Jose will like some of these quotes we're look at all the times brother Brandon was given a commission by the holy spirit so I know he likes the quotes I like it too I love I just love talking about he shared some quotes with me this week where brother man said Jesus was tempted at the woman at the well just in his own physical you know because she was Immortal woman he just had to overcome that he was tempted in all points like as we are thought wow I never knew brother R said that so that's a little JB there a little nugget our brother got there and just the reality Jesus overcame everything and he overcame it one way by the word of God that's what we can overcome today by the word of God so Philippians 3:13 and 14 I'll read 13 we can all read 14 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before let's all read this on three 1 2 3 I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen may God add his Blessing to reo's word may be seated see how this service goes I like maybe have some time of prayer at the end because some of these topics are dealing with seeking the Lord so I've learned just you know just I've been maybe reminded but I've learned how brother brandom approached a new year and how he approached uh the you know the goals for his life I thought it was uh just inspiring just so simple but so inspiring um and I've been blessed by that so I'm just going to review just for five minutes Wednesday's message if you didn't hear it uh pressing toward the mark means uh eagerly running after the goal and the High Calling is the invitation to Heaven it's the invitation to the marriage supper of the lamb praise God there's only a small group of people that get to set the marriage supper the lamb Hallelujah and God has called us to be a part of that amen we're not sitting in a Catholic church today thank God we're not sitting in a bar we're not sitting in the hospital today we are in the house of God hallelujah amen we serve the Living God so we are privileged to be invited to the marriage supper Land one place brother said that's the greatest privilege of your life is to be invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb with Jesus Christ Hallelujah say thank you Lord for inviting me I didn't go looking for him he came looking for me praise God hallelujah he came looking for you Hallelujah and we saw that we do this by Pres in our bodies a Living Sacrifice and then renewing our minds according to Romans 12 God promised to instruct Us in the way we would go he would guide us our our steps are ordered of God he gives us wisdom to number our days to apply our hearts to wisdom his word is a lamp into our feet right so the word will be a lamp for 2024 Hallelujah and we saw God rewards diligent Seekers Hallelujah so we want to diligently uh investigate that means diligent means investigate to Crave or seek after the will of God seek after God there's always more to be known about God yes there let's us never have the attitude well I'm in the message I know all about it let's never have that attitude let's be thankful for the message as we said thankful we're invited to the marriage supper the lamb but let us always remember there's more to God for us to have Hallelujah and we saw how moral you know your free moral agency decisions make you an overcomer Hallelujah and David was better at obeying God than Saul the only way you can overcome is by the word hallelujah that's the only way you're know sorry the only way you know you're an overcomer is by overcoming so in other words we should have testimonies at the end of the year God help me overcome this God brought me through that situation hallelujah amen that's the only way we can know we're Overcomers Hallelujah we must give all diligence keep your heart with all diligence Peter said give all diligence twice Hallelujah he says love the Lord your God with all your strength but we must first find the will of God for our lives in our gifts our relationships our vocations our locations our Ministries Hallelujah and brother Ram gave us five musts to do the will of God so we went through that again a wonderful review Hallelujah and then we looked at how we must shape Our Lives by self-control Hallelujah and then brother Ram said uh we must do our best for Jesus and then he'll say Well done it was well done good and faithful servant hallelujah amen now uh brother man said do a good job with your talent whatever you've been doing to whatever Talent you've been given to fix machines Hallelujah we got some Factory workers in here that do a wonderful job uh to fix the Earth brother Jose landscaper Hallelujah to train children's Minds you know that's kind of where I whatever job you've been given he said give God all your talent do the best job you can Hallelujah because you're doing it for God hallelujah says the worst thing you can do is neglect a try that's the worst thing like he said the parable burying your talent in the ground that's the worst thing you can do the the so the best thing is find what God's called you to do and do it the very best you can hallelujah amen brother said the most ambitious person is a Christian Hallelujah brother said get some ambition about you set your goal on Christ Hallelujah am he said you got to persevere to make your goal which means continuing in a course of action you got to keep acting on the the word of God despite difficulty we must persevere amen and then I like what he said he said when you plan for the year he said lay he said now he laid out all his imitations brother Jose said he had over a thousand imitations and uh to different states and around the world so he'd let all the California imitations in one stack all the Michigan all the Ohio all that overseas and he would wait on God then he said I'd wait for a week I'd drive around I'd pray i' go for for walks he would look for God to give him inspiration that's what I'm looking for this morning Hallelujah cuz I've laid my request I wrote about on Wednesday night after service I prayed I wrote my goals for 2024 Hallelujah and then this morning before church I laid them before God and I'm going to wait a week I'm going to see what the Lord is leading me to do praise God I'm looking for two witnesses because in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established and that's what brother Ram did he'd pray he'd wait and he looked for inspiration from the Holy Spirit he said I'm looking for something to impress me so hard I'm looking for just an impression he says I want to be impressed by the Holy Spirit don't you want to be that way said when you approach the New Year resolutions don't work I'm I'm I'm resolved to do this this year he said what works is death dying out to yourself Hallelujah he said it doesn't make you can resolve to do anything he said you'll just go back to it the next day right right but he said die yourself let God give you some impression and then you know God is with you for that that that goal praise God amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so uh now I'm getting down to these last quotes here and when brother Ram didn't have a leading he looked for somebody who had a leading like brother arganbright Hallelujah so if you don't have a leading you know look look to somebody who feels LED you know they're led by God and follow their leading maybe help out with their Ministry praise God hallelujah and then by 1964 he said I have no leading of the Lord out here in Arizona but I'm just going to try to do whatever I can so he had no specific leading at that time of his life so he was just doing what wherever got an imitation he would go so it just encourages us no matter where we are you know we should be seeking uh God's perfect will for our lives but if we can't if we can't put our finger on God wants me to do that do something praise God and I'll say like this you're already doing a wonderful job you know paying your ties coming to church singing songs and worshiping God those are all good things but anything beyond that let's seek God for it praise God let's seek God for is there something this year God wants me to do praise God hallelujah so that's what I ended with that last quote uh do the best job whatever you can I appreciate beus gave me a little comment on the the the video there on Wednesday so thank you sister beatric all right now let's begin part two amen I like to hear it's just nice to hear some feedback sometimes you know when you when you're preaching and studying now you can switch over I got some quotes here so that was a actually a 8 Minute 8 Minute review so forgive me so I did A Brief Review eight minutes there so I compiled some of these uh quotes here I want to bring this quote out too brother Rand said you know sometimes he would have invitations to go to a poor church or a rich church I want you to see what he says here he said I truly say I'm sorry this is the closing service he said I'm going to skip down a little bit he says I say this because it's true there's places waiting that's got tens of thousands of people together all overseas hundreds of places overseas major cities in America now but I usually lay the things out the invitations and pray over them now think about that what if you had an imitation e for your job or anything you know and they said there's 10,000 people you're going to be the speaker and there's 10,000 people there or there's just like a you know a same same type of convention and there's only 10 people there which one you think God would lead you to well we would think in our minds well he wants me to go to the big place but just here some time ago I read an invitation my wife and I were getting the invitations at our house one man said brother Ram if you'll come we'll guarantee you such and such a money now isn't that such a Temptation isn't that you know so much if you'll just come now preachers should be paid to come the Bible said the the labors worthy of his hire yes right but the next letter said brother Ram I haven't got a thing I can promise you not even a place to lay your head now which one which one do you think tens of thousands with lots of money or a place where we don't even know if we can house you I said I'm a married man and I have and I have seven daughters the preacher said I got six that's pretty close to me and five of them are grown I got one grown we're all here in a little three room house said I'm preaching under two pine trees said God knows I need you you know where I went he didn't go to the big place promising him money he went to the little humble place that didn't have any money he said that's right and there out of the meeting they built a great Tabernacle so somehow they got funding there to build it they were poor but they great they built a great Tabernacle and that as far as I know is still pastoring and that was down in Arkansas see it's always best to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit you know I'm promised more money if I go to this job or this place here I'm not promised anything but where is God leading that takes the direction of the Holy Spirit that takes somebody who's led by the holy spirit that can submit and humble themselves to the Holy Spirit I'm promised big money here I'm not even promised a hotel over there he says I've never preached to a nicer congregation I have these five nights he said I appreciate you all you've been very loyal so isn't that just wonderful to see a man of God it kind of reminds me of Philip remember Philip was at the great Revival down there in Samaria but the holy spirit said go out to one and preach a Revival preaching a Revival to one person hallelujah amen very similar right so see how again brother R's life matches that of a prophet very closely perfectly I'll say with the scriptures now here I like this prayer you know I'm not sure if this is a New Year's Prayer or not we'll look no he said help us as ministers uh see that we are requiring so much we must have a church we must have this we must have everything our women before going to church yet call themselves Christian we have to have a certain kind of a dress or have to be dressed so dobly now we don't battle that sisters and preachers will have so much money before they'll come thank God we don't have preachers like that you know fact there's been numerous times a like three or four times I forgot to pay preachers and they never complain I just mail it in the mail the week the next week you know I just forget sometimes in my busy life oh Christ when I read here how they wondered about and she skins and goat skins see God may God ever keep us humble like the real saints they lived in the dens of the earth and caves they wondered about under vile persecution yet obtain the faith under the ministry of angels how will we escape when the Lord Jesus has given us fine homes how many got a fine home how many got cars I got cars clothes and food and we murmur we sit around we're lazy now I don't think that's us but I'll say like this we don't want to become that that you're not that because if you're lazy you'd be at home right you're not lazy you come here to love the Lord and worship and you give all your Sunday to God most people can't even give hardly one service to God on a Sunday it's the Lord's day we never try to go out and do something about it how will we escape God now the point I want to get out of here is I want to do something about my friends and loved ones that maybe aren't serving God and that's what I think will help you what is there some what's a situation that you can do something about and what I mean by that is like I've learned this week you know is just just going out and offering to fellowship with somebody or just going out and trying to see someone who who might be depressed or discouraged what can you do about it that's what's impressed upon me what can I do about it is there something I can do about it amen hallelujah that's the kind of zeal I want to have this year praise God Amen I want to finish 2023 and I want to start Lord willly 2024 I don't want to sit back and do nothing about it I want to do something about it you I think about when I wasn't saved at akan University brother bang when we were both there the the chapel preacher invited me out to breakfast I think it was every Tuesday morning I didn't have I wasn't a Christian I didn't have Christian friends I was going to a couple parties and it wasn't was awful you know but but he made that he made a step with me like to kind of Mentor me and eventually you know the story I've told it many times he drew me in right but see I'm glad he made that effort he did something about it so when my mom dropped me off and I was the only one I didn't know a single soul in all of arine except for the coach she drops me off with 150,000 people I know one of them but thank God Jesus was with me amen her last words were uh preacher can you try to invite Jesse to church and look what the preacher did he met with met with me every week and it was nice even paid for my my lunch or my breakfast I always get the pancakes and eggs you like that buddy I always get pancakes and then he would print off parts of a chapter out of a book of a Bible I'm sorry out of a a book of a of a Christian Author can't remember his name now I'll think of it eventually but we he would just go over a few things in there and talk to me about college and how's it going he he did something about my walk my walk with the Lord that's what I want to do that's why I reach out to those three families that don't have they don't have dads they don't have moms and I want I want to do something about it amen I want to show the love of Christ to them I don't want to sit back and let somebody else do it I want to do it praise God am so see I'm not you know I'm not condemning anybody but I recognize I battle complaining sometimes because I'm human right I'm an American I battle first world problems like waiting behind somebody at a stop like too long or someone's driving too slow on the way to church and I'm like can you just you're just going for a Sunday Drive can you please move you know we we're human and we battle these things but I don't want to sit around and do something nothing about it I want to do something about it praise God but I got to be led by the Holy Spirit and so I got to seek God to know what to do like I remember uh remember 200 21 I looked at bang right down here I said brother bang maybe this is year Zur comes back remember that brother hallelujah amen maybe this 2024 maybe it's the year you feel in the blank Hallelujah we'll do something about it now we didn't do anything about it other than praying God LED our sister back by God's grace what a blessing amen we got a miracle sit right here in the church amen hallelujah each one of you are a miracle that serve Jesus Christ hallelujah amen but what could what could be different in the next year if we do something about it and even just praying is is something praying is enough praise God praying is enough because it's not being lazy the Bible said you have not because you ask not so let's keep praying for souls to be saved and I'll just be honest like this I'm working on my barber yesterday I gave him a little love offering I didn't have to do that I've never done that before I gave him a love offering I wrote him a little verse in there and then he started he said I've been reading the Bible I thought about you all morning he said I want to talk to you about the book of Daniels we talked about Israel and so after that I shared some uh some of my videos with him and he said I've listened to the first 27 minutes of of your chapter on the mother the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic Church I'm working on him praise God I'm going try to invite him to church pretty soon by God's grace he's wanted to come his wife just won't join him because he's uh she's not a Believer but I was praying for her this morning praise God I would just love for her to get around sister Naomi and beatric and Zur I just love for you sister just to love on her amen show her some real love amen they shall know the love of Jesus Hallelujah see our little girls praising God would you love to see that amen some sinner that don't know Jesus get around here and hear these girls praise the Lord I've had numerous people tell me they love to watch Haven worship some people were sitting the back and they they watch Haven and nature and virtue and I think the other ones too but I think this year I can't remember but they said I love watching them raise their hands and praise the Lord I love that we just sometimes got to get people around us we got to invite some people to church praise God let's do something about it hallelujah amen hallelujah how many you want to do that like I I'm trying to lay it in there real thick praise God Amen oh I pray that you'll burn old fashion conviction into every heart this morning Lord that the people might be up and at it am so not be sitting back lazy now this is kind of sa religious but sit back lazy doing nothing for God oh that the people might be up and at it ready to do something for Jesus Jus amen am that's his prayer that's an oldfashioned way Hallelujah that's not the new way that's the oldfashioned way hallelujah amen the apostles were up and at it amen those those deacons were up and at it feeding those widows Hallelujah as we looked at in Acts chapter 6 and 7 let us work while the daylight is shining because the sun is swiftly sinking and remember brother said the greatest thr you ever have is living for others am Hallelujah the greatest thrill is when you witness to somebody and they come to church or they love the Lord you know that's the greatest thrill in life is doing something for somebody else that can't do it themselves see you know sometimes we're tempted to look for Thrills elsewhere the Thrills are sacrificing for other people amen that's the thrill in life doing something about somebody else's life Hallelujah am amen so I'm going to try to get to do something for those three lives hopefully in the next few weeks by God's grace I want to do something I want to make some type of impact on their life I think you know with the little kids I'm going I bought some wrapping paper yesterday I'll just buy him some little Christmas gifts and wrap it up and and we'll go over there maybe play some drele or something like that you we play some Dr we just connect forward something like that just try to show the love of Jesus to them maybe a little bible or something like that he says civil civilization is going and there'll be no more time it'll blend eternity oh God grant today that we go with what a fresh vision that's what I need Hallelujah with wisdom with understanding to know how to approach Sinners amen and bring them to Christ hallelujah ammen hallelujah I love it praise God God give us oldfashioned conviction where I want do something about it I want to see somebody say praise God give me a fresh Vision to win a soul for Jesus amen oh I love these quotes amen so empowering Hallelujah you know I'll just share this we had a I've been telling you about this this blind brother who I've been uh talking to and uh he said just pray for me he said I'm learning these songs you know he's singing I'm one of them he's just leaves me these voice messages and I said wow I was just that was just he's like it's the first time so like he's like in a Revival this the first time he's ever shouted and screamed you know I'm like that's awesome so I sent him a voice message back and I started singing I will praise him praise the lamb for sin SL and God's my witness it was like 6:00 in the morning and I felt this surge of the Holy Spirit flow up through me I thought my this guy is first enjoying it this this anointing that comes with singing and I need a refreshing of that amen I need a fresh Vision to praise God in the morning like that I I literally felt it I'm like whoa this is the holy spirit here amen but see we just get into our routines and we go through the year if you're like anything like me I'm just a very routine person but it's just a fresh reminder you know we do something about other people's lives we reach out to other people we try to help people God give us a fresh Vision give us renewed Faith so we'll be up and at it hallelujah amen hallelujah remember it was your Worship in those dance services that he was like wow there's so much Freedom it was those services that he saw all you praising the Lord that made him first reach out to me praise God see God God uses those videos God uses your testimony praise God Amen now we looked at this a little bit I just want to share a little example here now some habits you can overcome by the Holy Spirit how many know that so God help me overcome smoking and chewing and alcohol and dirty magazines all the god helped me do it as I surrendered to his will in other words God just didn't take it all away I had to sacrifice I had to do something about it okay and that's what brother is talking about here habits or Spirits the Bible said they're unclean spirits so we want to have healthy habits by God's grace and here's the quote I read this on Wednesday night you know sobody says Lord uh if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me drinking or gambling or stealing I'll serve him he said but that's up to you you got something to do that they that overcome shall inherit all things they must they that they that overcome you have power to do it you must be willing to lay it down see she's made herself ready you've got to make decisions for yourself when you do that you show your faith and respect to God Amen now I'm going to preach both sides of this right now one side is there's habits that we can get rid of on our own if we just yield to the Holy Spirit right Hallelujah that's what I'm saying today if we got habits that we shouldn't have let's pray God will give us Grace Hallelujah let's reach out to god let's put our faith in it let's trust God to overcome any habit that we can control praise God Amen but there are other habits on this other side see how I move from one side to other side there are habits on this side where you can't overcome it on your own and you have to have God intervening amen so I'm just bringing that out there's some you can't do without God's help there's others you can you can do on your own amen amen hallelujah so we're going to have a fresh Vision we're going to have a an attit you to get up and be at it well we got to recognize some things we can overcome other things we have to have God step in amen and the example I want to give is this sister yeah only there's other habits Only God Can Heal so brother Jose brought me this great book brother I'm loving this book uh we're about 60% done we're doing it for our family devotions at night I love it I love hearing these stories of brother brother R would have visions like eating at the table he had visions of people this person's going to be made well and then the people would get well well just just while you're eating dinner it's just amazing I love hearing these testimonies because some of these are not on tape you only hear them when the people write I want I want to read about this sister here I thought it would just be a good example sister Rosella Griffith Martin how many know Sister Rosella she's on tape brother Jose knows you she first came into contact with brother br's meetings in 1952 uh uh now what happened was her addiction was alcohol she was an alcoholic for many years okay she graduated high school got a job and then going she started going out with the girls they they ordered mixed drinks like every night after work and it became an obsession she drank excessively at the age of 25 in 1949 there was no hope for her she was a confir confirmed alcoholic she was so so cold cuz you know you get shakes when you're an alcoholic she was so cold at just like you know 20 some years old 25 her mom bought her one of those big fur coats but she would hide alcohol on the inside of those and keep drinking the whole time that that this is the kind of addicts that would come to brother R's meetings they had to give her shots of vitamins to keep her alive because all she would do was drink alcohol her dad gave up on her one time she tried to step in front of a car going 80 miles per hour and it just it just skimmed her leg just barely she tried to commit suicide how many know God's in the details God knew that little inch or that quarter inch right between the car and this woman why she was a predestinated seed amen amen kind of reminds you of the maniac of gther right she just in this world of addiction and world of demon possession with alcohol her mom her mom never gave up on her her dad kind of gave up on her her mom said said maybe she can't change herself but God is able to change her am when I was at my worst my mother saw me in a vision with my Bible in front of me she believed God gave her that vision and she clung to that rather than believe with the doctor told her amen may God give us a vision Hallelujah give us a dream something to hang on for to do something about somebody else's need praise God oh I love this story what a beautiful Story So eventually she joined alcoholics and she was sober for 9 months every day I kneel down by my bed and prayed God would you keep me sober today I stayed sober but I was not free now there's a difference there was that terrible craving still and the craving never left for those nine months until she went to see the prophet of God hallelujah her friend one day told her Rosella make sure you tell your mom there's a man of God over in Hammond Indiana now don't forget that two nights later I was standing for brother brandom on the plat platform and through his prophetic eyes he saw me covered in darkness you're an alcoholic he said to me I said yes sir he told the audience to Bow their heads and he placed his hand on my head and rebuked the demon of alcohol from my life in the name of Jesus Christ instantly I was free Amen Hallelujah Lord that wasn't it Church she had a friend who was addicted she went and got her friend who had the same demon came to brother R brother R prayed for her and she got made well too praise God then she went to Brother M's meetings in Jeffersonville and it was time for communion and she was wondering oh I got to drink alcohol again I think about what a Temptation that would be but before they St up there she tells the testimony brother R saids sister you can have it you're going to be all right she took it she said I never had one craving I've all these years later she said I've never had any craving other at all and I'm able to take the communion I talk about a healing praise God Amen you're addicted for all these years but then God drops down and God does the Deliverance amen see there's some habits you and I need to take care of and there's other habits that only God can take care of but God is faithful Hallelujah well somebody in your corner somebody praying for you somebody encouraging you praise God until the time of Deliverance comes thank God for the hour of Deliverance praise God amen amen then she led her husband to Jesus Christ she said 'I never forget brother Brown for bringing Jesus to me he told me don't you ever fail to witness for Jesus Christ amen think of that she was an alcoholic then an Alcoholic Anonymous that could never cure it then she gets healed and brother says never fail to witness about your testimony now let me bring that down home what testimony has God given us let us always have it on the front of our lips to share our testimony with others praise God I want to show you where God LED this woman this was no ordinary woman she said for the last 50 years I have witnessed in jail Services when was the last time you were jail it's been a number of years since I went to jail I saw I wasn't in jail but I was visiting somebody in jail for 50 years she'd go visit jail Services skidrow missions I'm not sure what that is but missions where I think they take care of drug addicts churches hospitals to my neighbor and people I meet on the street when brother R prayed for me he asked if I would serve Jesus the rest of my life I said yes and I meant it praise God the greatest joy has been to go out and win souls for the Lord she's no preacher but what she's like the woman at the well she's got a mighty testimony Hallelujah and your testimony can burn up the city for Jesus hallelujah amen isn't that beautiful she says when I get over to my Eternal home I will still be shouting his praises and loving him for what he has done for me oh thank you Jesus amen a woman who spent 50 years doing something about it praise God Amen I'm not going to sit back and let let the souls come to me I'm going to go out to the hurting I'm going to go give them hope praise God I forget who was brother Jose but we had a preacher coming here and he'd heard her testimony she they would have meetings you know message meetings pre Services instead of preaching they would invite her just to give her testimony how she knew brother brandom and people got saved people got delivered so what I'm trying to say is uh let by God's grace let's find what God's called us to do amen amen let's find the hurting let's find where we can share our testimonies praise God let's do something about it by God's grace amen I think that's beautiful look at that she's got both pictures back there Lord Jesus and brother R's picture sometimes I think about putting brother R's picture in here maybe I'll do that that in 2024 because it it's it's about Jesus it's about the pillar of fire that led the prophet of God Amen now here's another one I shared with you just I just want to bring balance to this one too he said H uh this is the New Year's Eve service so so how many is glad and happy the Lord spared you another year and here we are coming up to the end of the road and pray that God will forgive us all of our sins and our shortcomings now I want to say this before I start I wish to each of you all the most successful and blessful and healthy New Year that I can wish to you God be with you how many want god with them may you grow both physically and spiritually financially materially everything God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it now I emphasize that because God can't bring everything upon us right right he might it might not be the time or season or he he might not be able to trust us with that right right praise God he said I'm facing a new year myself God only knows what lays in the future what laid in the future after 196 we had 1961 62 63 the Seven Seals Hallelujah we got all of our stuff all the decisions have to be made right away brother Jim up there he's got it ready now for the imitations and things from internationally worldwide to see where the Lord will lead us and I certainly solicit the prayers of you people to pray with all your heart that God will never let me be misled amen of anything I want to be a sincere never be misled and now I'm had a good year who's had a good 2023 by God's grace I've had a good year It's Been a Good Year by God's grace but see you got to approach it with this add this humility this sincerity Lord I don't want to misstep this year I want to walk in all your steps you've ordered my steps for 2024 praise God amen amen and God May everything good may you bring it on me if you can bring it on me amen like you know we've heard people say oh if God made me a millionaire I do this no you would do exactly what you're doing right now you'd be just as generous or lack of generous as you are right now praise God it's the money won't change the person it just reveals more of what the person is hallelujah right that's right it's exactly right now remember brother talks about you know eating so you know uh a lot of people get a lot of people aren't blessed physically because they eat the wrong Foods right brother tells us you know some of us eat and never exercise others are over exercised and don't get a chance to eat now he's talking about spiritually but it applies to the Natural as well I mean people want people want their physical bodies blessed but are they willing to meet the conditions of that right we got to be if we want to see a change God's not going to naturally take off 20 pounds or for me he's not going to add 10 pounds of muscle for me I've got to put some effort into it right I've got to obey the laws of the Bible amen so you know I I love these quotes you know brother wish is all these blessings but part of it sometimes we've got to get good habits about praise God the Bible said don't be among wine Biers and righteous Eaters of Flesh the drunker and the Glutton the Overeaters should come to poverty and the Bible said glorify God in your body because it's God Amen and how many want success there's only one time you know this I preach this when the Joshua series there's only one time the Bible said the word success and and God told Joshua you'll be a good success you'll be strong and of good courage do not be afraid of anything because the Lord thy God is with you whether soever thou goest hallelujah amen let's all say God is with me ready God is with me amen he's with you praise God and you'll be a success just keep the word of God in your mouth meditate upon the word of God in your heart praise God God will bless all your pasts hallelujah amen see I want to I want to I want to grow spiritually the Bible says resist the the devil he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you praise Goden if we want to be if we want to grow spiritually we've got to make an effort we got to obey the laws of God we got to draw nigh to God we must be closer with God in 2024 amen it's not just going to magically happen right right right I mean God could do that what he's going to do is he's going to put it on our hearts the word of God and then we look down at the word of God every day obey it and then we do it and when we do that we're overcoming hallelujah amen Glory humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up humility always goes before reward or Victory humility is always first humbling ourselves drawing close to God and then God will exalt you Amen in the eyes of your family your friends like I said spouse the church the world whatever God chooses to do humility comes first reward comes second hallelujah amen and brother says I I pray God will bless you materially and financially well sometimes God's going to give you an abundance so you can help out other people that don't have as much righten see we might want well I want more money for me or I want more money for whatever but sometimes God's going to give you more just so you can give it to somebody else amen hallelujah that might be the reason God will bless you materially so you can be a blessing to somebody else amen hallelujah okay I'm those are just my notes I forgot to put them now I want to uh again emphasize this we must inquire or look to Jesus or consider Jesus when we plan for this next coming year like I said I've spent a little time praying about that I want to be led by the Holy Spirit I'm looking for something like in 2020 I was preaching on Philippians and I was showing how Paul defended the gospel and I was praying Lord do you want me to take this debate and as I was preaching it I said I I just I felt the Holy Spirit Come On Me me and I said I was born to defend this message and as soon as I close service I got an email pop up saying do you want to do this debate I thought I took that as two witnesses then I did did the debate and numerous people have been helped to save the message through that debate so that's what I'm looking for for 2024 amen I'm looking for a second witness a third witness I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to move me because I don't want to do what I want to do I want to do what Jesus wants me to do am that's why I come to church praise God Amen to find out what is God want me to do right we know we know and I'll say like this as a balance we know so much of what God wants us to do but then there are certain areas where we need God to guide us into what to do which we'll show with brother Rand in in a moment here by God's grace I know Jose just can't wait to hear those quotes right Jose I love these quotes I just love remember David said one thing I desired and I will seek after this that that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to acquire his Temple I just walked in here this morning and I just said I love being in the house of God Amen I love it praise God there nowhere else I want to be praise God all the days so I can behold the beauty of God and inquire in his Temple for I love this in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion praise God amen amen in other words I want to spend all my time with God so that when Trials come he'll hide me with him s praise God because I spent all the other days trying to draw close to him praise God and brother uses that that's a Rapture verse for brother BR time of trouble the laying down the mark of the beast he'll hide me in his he'll Rapture me up to the meeting in the air praise God in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me on a rock and inquire means to seek after to look for I'm looking for God I'm looking for Jesus I'm considering God I'm reflecting on God go amen now I'm bringing this up from an old sermon I think it was 2017 David never inquired of the Lord about bringing the ark back yet he required about other situations four times and I just I just I'm reading through first Samuel now I'm in second Samuel now and I've just read these recently um David saved Kela from the Philistines remember that David David said Lord are they going to come out what should I do and the Lord said you you'll you'll save Kila and then David came back you know that that case in 1st Samuel 30 David went out with the Phil Philistine King to fight Saul talk about Civil War and God protected him from fighting against his brother and sister that's what I want God to do for us praise God God protect us from fighting against one another Hallelujah a lot of churches have a lot of fights between people that's why they have a lot of troubles different pastors tell me about it I'm like oh thank God for a church that loves each other praise God Amen but David actually went out with his mighty men and then the the Philistine King said uh one of his friends said oh he's just here to spy on you so he sent David back David was upset as soon as he got back to ziklag all the wives and children were gone everything was burned up and they went to Stone David and that's where David said I got to encourage myself amen there's nobody here to encourage me I got to encourage myself hallelujah amen and what did he do he said priest bring me the ark let me ask God what what I should do praise God that's what we need today praise God lord what do you want me to do today praise God and the he said Lord shall I go up he said go and restore all amen amen and while on the way there with the 600 friends two of them 200 of them are too tired to go and some of the some of the guys said these guys are weak and tired they won't get the reward David said no they're part of our church praise God they've been faithful just because they're weak doesn't mean they don't get the spoils uh just because they're weak in this moment here that doesn't make them less they're still going to get reward I like that praise God hallelujah see not every battle is yours to win not every battle is yours to fight but you get all the blessings hallelujah amen you get all the blessings of being a Christian you get every benefit from being a Christian Hallelujah whether you're in the fight or not Hallelujah God still blesses his people God still anoints his people praise God Amen I like that then he said where should I go after Saul died and the Holy Spirit said go up to Hebron and he reigned there seven years as a king he Judah anointed him and he reigned seven years remember ishbosheth was was Saul's son and ishbosheth reigned those seven years and then he asked the Lord in 2 Samuel 5 shall I go up against the Philistines and the Lord said yes they came against Jerusalem and twice he he inquired another time too the first time he went out whipped them they came back and the Lord said don't go straight out he said go by the way of the malberry trees and when you hear the Holy Spirit move through the malberry trees you follow that leading amen amen I want to hear the Holy Spirit come through this church praise God whether it's me preaching another preacher or one of you giv a word or testimony I want the Holy Spirit to blow through this church so we can follow the wind of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen praise God so you know what to do for this year amen and again there's nothing wrong with continuing what you're doing investing in whatever God's called you to do but if there's a a leading of God on your life let's inquire for God about it amen let's ask God what do you want to do about it like I've got numerous requests on here should I write the family book I want to do a series about learning the message I preach remember learning to learn from Jesus I want to finish that music series I would like to pay off my my debt my one more debt you know should we have more Revival services like the Appo one shall reach out to camp for more of those maybe God would meet us again I don't I don't know do God want us to have another Revival meeting here there's different things I like to make um different Souls I want to win invite people to church well what should I do I need to know but what I do is I have to inquire of God what does God want me to do am if I write the book I don't have much time for anything else right right Hallelujah if I pray for God to pay off the mortgage and some some large money sum comes to me but I've got this other need where do I do what do I do with that I need to know what God wants me to doen Hallelujah I need to know which souls to invite the church amen right praise God so David was undefeated he was in he had an invincible Army whenever he asked God about it this shows us the power of prayer amen hallelujah later when he had the ark he inquired about the famine because of Saul's sins and God answered Hallelujah so again this we get this idea of seeking God seeking God for everything asking God God is there anything different about this year do I need to change something do I need to uh have have something new come in my life do I need a fresh Vision amen amen Lord what what what Lord what do you want me to do about things is there anything that I can do something about that I haven't been doing something about now I just want to bring this out this is this struck my mind this week brother brandom uh wanted to do a world tour so brother Jose I don't know if you remember this but it never materialized so this just goes to show church we can have desires and people around us can be talking about things but it might not materialize so I just want to show you that a prophet of God he said I definitely feel led to have these meetings but they never happened now the thing about that I definitely feel led well there's either one or two things that was just a human leading or was God's leading and then he missed the Mark I choose to believe the first one it probably just a human leading I doubt brother Brandon missed the leading of the Holy Ghost on that he wouldn't had meetings set up where he can preach the vials the trumpets and all these things they never materialize sometimes Church some of the things we plan in life we definitely feel led to do let's not be discouraged amen right ask brother I'm just going to skip down here 1962 he said when I come back from overseas I want to go down into Uganda South Africa just make a world tour around trying to be back again by next spring if the Lord willing I like that if the Lord willing and he wants me to continue on trying to evangelize for his glory now here's something I'm going to add for brother Jose too then I aim to do what I've always promise to set the tent in the community where there's no revivals remember brother had the third pole vision and there was a little tent and everybody that walked in there walked out home brother his whole life he thought he was going to set this tent it never happened and I told you my understanding because it was a spiritual tent it was him fasting and praying and preaching the Seven Seals and there was amazing leukemia was healed that week there was over 100 baptisms that's what I believe it was amen I think so but look I's he's Pro I promise you I'm going set that tent but it wasn't a natural tent it was a spiritual tent he set up brother uh let's see he set up eight months later spiritually amen hallelujah I've always promised I'm going to do this but it was a different interpretation how many know he said that by God's grace I'm promising you this but it was actually a spiritual tent not a natural tent yeah the church said there's people that still believe brother's going to raise from the dead come back and set up tents and preach around the world they don't know the quotes yes that's now here brother says this is five months before he died he's still saying this I hope we can have where we can bring all of us together maybe under big tent where I'm feeling really definitely led to preach these seven last vows and he never preached it see church God Is So merciful we feel like something's happening but it's okay if we don't know everything the main thing to do is keep sin out of your life have good habits God will show you the right path hallelujah amen I just wanted you to show you even a prophet can definely feel led to do something but it wasn't the time right or maybe he just had the the wrong understanding of it and that's okay it never materialized all the way the rest of his life he was looking for this tent to uh this tent to manifest and even brother and even as brother Jose knows even when he got healed of that stomach condition he talked about it on the wings of a snow white duve he said I'm going to ride this Trail again and he met or he was saying I'm going to go around the world again he never went around the world [Music] again see but I love it I love brother want to be up and at it praise God I love that he still would have a fresh Vision amen I'm Healed oh God do something with my life amen amen whatever you want me to preach whatever meetings you want me to set up I want to be led to do it and Lord just allow allow what needs to come to pass just work out your perfect will in my life Hallelujah I'm definitely see I I love you know like I can say I told you this I love when I can look and say I definitely felt led to invite that brother and look what happened God would speak to somebody or I definitely feel led I called those meetings in well the Holy Spirit called those meetings in the point that was me that was God using me that wasn't it wasn't me it was God you understand like that was God doing that I felt led to do it now every time I so see every time I I say I'm be led don't make me prophesying okay just like brother R okay sometimes y I feel like it's Le I hope it's l and look brother says yeah brother Jose you like this one said I'm going to leave in around January this is 1963 he said I want to take a complete World Tour all around the world how many knows did he ever do it never did it in' 64 God kept him in America the rest of his life except one time he went to South Africa in May of 1965 he thought I'm feeling LED I'm going to go around the world and said mea go come with me she said I'm too old to go and look she had the right leading right it wasn't God's will for him to go well I you said about my last trip overseas about eight years ago if be like I'm in better shape now I know more about it see he had all these right reasons it seems like he was supposed to go but God never opened the doors because remember he said Lord willing right and Billy right now uh is working on overseas for a complete World Tour begin immediately after Christmas never happened I got the book I left the book in there the message companion I love it they list all the sermons and locations of every one of brother brandom's and in all of 64 he stayed in the United States the entire year but he thought he was all had it all planned out I'm going around the world on a world tour it never it never materialized and that's okay he says since Christmas this first of the year there's been over a thousand imitations around the world a thousand imitations has coming back there and so the Lord just has to direct me on which of those to go to and what to do we just depend on him you couldn't take them all like I said on Wednesday who has a to-do list of a thousand jobs you have to do I looked at mine I got about 30 or 40 i' like to do probably not going to do all of them right but he to do this wow I got to get back to these thousand people it's impossible for me to do it so how do I do it through prayer and looking for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit spirit amen Amen brother Jess I just don't know how I can accomplish everything let me tell you let me burst your bubble now you can't accomplish everything brother R couldn't accomplish everything but you must accomplish what God has called you to accomplish praise God let's not be a Jonah and leave the will of God and then God's got to spank us to get us back in the will of God and the church said amen hallelujah brother R said uh in desperations he said we're coming back from a or we want to go on a complete World Tour to begin just as soon as we can get it ready but we have to wait for conditions I like that we're waiting for conditions waiting for the time and season says we're fixing to make another world tour it never got one now I got a lot of these quotes here from this book I love this book it's been such a help to me God bless Marcus Becker he's still alive he's such a wonderful brother I never met it but he seemed like a wonderful brother brother to make this so um in 1964 I actually left the book in there but it doesn't matter I already told you I think he started Louisiana and he just stay in the America for the entire year of 64 after saying World Tour World World Tour I definitely feel led it never it never materialized his final trip was in May of 65 to South Africa and remember they wouldn't let him preach and brother R told those ministers the blood of those Souls will be on your hands think about that they wouldn't let him preach cuz they had doctrinal differences against him and he made all that effort to fly over there all all he got to do is just go on hunting trips because of a bunch of denominational uh what is it uh jealousy and all the blood will be on their hands now here's what I want to show with Jose here I think I like this did you ever look at all the brother Ram's commissions that he's been given the first one when he was I was seven years old in 1916 and the commission was don't never smoke or drink or defile your body in any way there'll be a work to do for you when you get older I said that's sacred wouldn't it be wonderful God could visit some our seveny olds how about eight nine or 10 nature how about 10 and give you a commission but now the rest of your life you've got to honor that remind you of anybody like Samson John the Baptist men men that were born under a vow born under a commission so his first one when he was 7 years old then in 1933 believe he's 30 let's see 22 years old he had his first meetings there in 1933 and as as he was baptizing the 17th person he got another commission brother Jose yeah as John was sent to forerun the first coming your message will forerun the second coming of Christ amen hallelujah remember he was only courting hope at this time they weren't they didn't get married till 34 1934 so he he started a church in 1933 after after this he started church he was the pastor yet he wasn't married yet he didn't have children how many believe God's a god of Grace I believe it now more than ever in the same Year brother brother Jose when they laid the Cornerstone Hallelujah he saw the vision of the two two trees and the vision said he's got to stand between the trinitarians and the Oneness and God would bring great forth I'm sorry God would bring great fruit out of it and that has happened remember brother's Ministry even history says it started the healing revivals of the 1940s 50s and 60s I believe my mom's healing is a result of brother Brand's Ministry because my mom was in the Assemblies of God and the Assemblies of God honored brother brand amen amen hallelujah I believe that and they the Assemblies of God believe in Divine Healing because of brother [Applause] Brandon Hallelujah and the voice said that morning he was walking in the church and he said uh the boy said do the work of evangelist this is not your Tabernacle I like sharing that one with voice of God records I said well then where is my Tabernacle amen hallelujah he sent me down under a big bright blue sky and he said do the work of of Angels make full proof of your ministry the time will come when they will not endure doct of second Timothy chapter 4 but shall Heap for themselves together teachers having itcher itching ears and shall be turned from the truth to fables if that hasn't happened word by word that is why I've tried to strictly stay with the word of God Amen beautiful so three commissions already glory amen so Church what am I trying to I'm trying to show what's God's commission for you now with parenting it's very easy in marriage very easy love your spouse as Christ love the church raise your children in the honor and admonition of the Lord but anything outside of that we got to find God's will for it amen and the best thing you can do is inquire of God say God like David is it your will that I do this is it your will and then just wait don't jump into it wait upon the Lord how many know that when you wait on God you get renewed strength you get a fresh visionen Hallelujah I remember when that sister Joy she go was the brother uh what's his name down in Alabama brother Steven Shell's Church she edited my two books and the first time she said Jesse you're a man of vision because I told her my ideas for the modesty book and the uh uh the Mysteries book and she said you're a man of vision I never and no one never told me that before I'm like am I really I don't really realize that but what I realized is I just caught the vision of God oh yeah I had a brother email me last weekend he said he said I was so fed up he said I'm GNA write a a book to prove to these people that left the message I'm going to write a book proving that modesty's of the Lord he said and then I found your book he said it was already written I said thank the Lord I love that see there's a deep call to the Deep praise God Amen God led me to do that amen God leads you to do things praise God Amen we got to be led by the Lord to do it I'm definitely feeling L to this I'm definitely feeling let's be definite about it praise God Amen and again I've made I've written those two books the first one cost four grand just to edit it the second one cost six grand and I didn't pay pay one penny of that I love how God backs up his word amen if God calls you to do something he'll make a way for it praise God yes where's my Tabernacle it's not eth and Penn Street it's the world praise God hallelujah amen yeah yeah remember that Vision brother R said the Tabernacle won't eat the bread of God I got I got to find that quote and brother R said he saw himself outside the Tabernacle with a mountain of bread and he said all the people of the world were running to that bread amen hallelujah amen see that wasn't his Tabernacle his ministry was going out as the Evangelist as the prophet as the eler to get a bride that will wear the clothes of the word of God amen amen thank God Hallelujah and then 1946 he got the commission of the the first pole remember the angel met him in the cave right after God uh brought Israel into a nation he said do not fear and I know these bed the sign people are probably going to make fun of me they say oh it wasn't 1946 and whatever they can do whatever they want I'm standing with the word of God I'm standing with the Bible revelations if they care that you need to read my books then if they care so much about truth read my books research The Other Side by God's grace mhm and show me where I'm Wrong by the Bible hallelujah amen the angel saido not fear I'm set from the presence of God to tell you that you were born A peculiar birth and a and your peculiar life has been to indicate that you're to take the gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world well sir I'm uneducated I couldn't go if you'll get them to believe you and if you'll be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer if you'll get them to believe you sister Rosella beyond the curent of time can say Amen to that God heal me of alcohol ISM it was incurable but only Jesus could heal me because the prophet got me to believe the word of God hallelujah amen amen yes you'll be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given two signs to get the people to believe you is really the issue all right that's the that was the first poll 1946 May the second poll was in Regina 1949 brother said I was standing at vagina Saskatchewan 3 months ago this was in uh January 1950 so would have been what September or let's see 12 11 10 yeah so October October there's my hour I'm not done yet gra I was standing on the platform talking to the audience we're having a great meeting so I guess close to 10,000 people were gathered there and I said now the Lord has told me that if I would be sincere that someday it would come to pass that the secrets of the people's heart would be told and he said in that meaning a man came up and he told him all the secrets of the heart and he says wow the second poll has now been Vindicated hallelujah hallelujah he noticed he said the first pole the second pole went from one to another I predicted remember when I first started about the first there'll come a time it'll will'll even know the secrets of their heart all right I'm going skip past that the third poll was told to him in 1956 Church but he didn't accept it until around 1961 62 63 Hallelujah he said he taken me up there I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a tent and it was packed and lined with people everywhere and looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an altar call and hundreds and hundreds of people were reaping and rejoicing after they accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior I heard a man say call the prayer line he says the people begin to line up on this side the uh the left from where I was looking down towards a platform and they lined up all the way down the street for a prayer line and notice to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I've seen that light all they all have a picture of you know that's always in the meetings I've seen that light leave me and go to that building and the voice said I'll meet you in there that will be the third poll Hallelujah I said why well it won't be a public show like the other and I came too amen amen now think about that if that was the the seven seal meetings then it came to pass it wasn't a public show God met brother brandom individually in that prayer room he stayed with the woods family remember brother wood his neighbor he stayed with him the whole week and he said I sat in the room in dark and prayed all day and each morning the angel Lord would meet me and give me the revelation of the Seven Seals praise God amen amen amen yes now remember this quote U this is the quote I I read last week brother random had a signus inection for 9 days and he missed the sermon and then he asked his wife ma am I even called to preach and sister me kind of rebuked him remember that people a lot of people like that online and brother said aren't you glad for a faithful wife will tell you the truth hallelujah now look what Jesus then he saws Jesus and Jesus says you're waiting for your new ministry it's the third pole to be confirmed to I've already confirmed it to you it's already confirmed you've got to accept it m God had already done hady R's a miracle of her two sons being saved that was in 59 if I'm not mistaken God had already showed it to him but he had a hard time accepting it isn't that true sometimes church God has something for us to do but it's hard for us to do it I wonder if God's trying to get us to do something this next year that we've been kind of putting off or haven't quite understood for a while think about that is there anything that God's called you to do you haven't know yet but you know God's calling you to do it or maybe you don't understand what God's calling you to do thank God there's Mercy thank God God is patient with us hallelujah he said Jesus said you've got to accept it in the same way you've got to believe it you got to believe in your ministry Hallelujah you have to believe the word of God that God has revealed to your heart yeah praise God I love that quote now 1963 brother Raam says this Look Away to Jesus right at the end of the year he says there's no more doubt in my mind so finally after all these years God showed him this in 1956 it takes all these years seven years now he says now there's no more doubt in my mind I know what the third poll is I know what it does hallelujah third poll was speaking the word of God it was the revelation of God's word amen amen he would meet with God get thus say the Lord go out and preach it he'd also speak to the storm right the snowstorm he speak to meus tumor it was speaking the word of God hallelujah teaching the word of God you like this one this is really good this one bless me brother BR had a dream in 1962 and what was the interpretation go back to Jeffersonville and store up food I love this quote where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here any anywhere that will compare with the message we have that's my question amen where's a church like our church where's a church like brother Jim's church or brother Brooks's church or brother caner where's a church like ours that's so deep and in love with the word of God hallelujah amen amen show me one he says Where do we have a church where we got like this where people love the word of God they'll say Amen to the word of God they'll believe the word of God they'll believe the Bible Hallelujah they'll take God at his word and speak the word praise God am where do we go a church like this I watched a presbyterian service this week there was no prayer before service the man just got up he said a few nonous they said okay now let's play the prelude they pray the pr they play the prelude everybody sat still they keep talking a little bit whisper then they got by sing a few hymns sat down got up and preach sat down now they say the benediction now we're all dismissed it was just it was so formal now don't get me wrong if they're sincere God God helps them but but there's no emotion there's no Zeal for God there's no sincerity there's no shouting and praising God there ought to be joy in the house of the Lord Praise Goden there ought to be something spontaneous happened in the house of God even this morning praise God there ought be something Supernatural God just don't anoint me God anoints all of you praise God amen amen the doctrine of nicolan takes all the uh puts all the anointing on the preacher well I I'm telling you what I feel led to do not does anybody else feel led to do anything praise God Amen Hallelujah go up and ser up the spiritual food show me it's comparison anywhere you go right to out to denominational Creeds you'll go right away from the name of the Lord Jesus like I showed I didn't show you but the videos there's videos of the Pope with circus people dancing all around him and he's throwing rings and trying to get rings to fall on a a stick you know that and that's in the Vatican they're doing that in the Vatican half naked women dancing around him and half naked men dancing all around them that's happening that's their

flee to Tarsus then he ministered in Syria wow for uh eight years then he visited Jerusalem a second time he was there three years with Barnabas that was during the time of the famine that agabus prophesied up and then in 46 and 47 he went on his first missionary journey look you got a commission you need to go on your missionary journey look at that he come back spent a little time in Antioch
