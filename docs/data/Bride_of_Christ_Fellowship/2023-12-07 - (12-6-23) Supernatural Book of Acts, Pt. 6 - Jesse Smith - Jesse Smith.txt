========================================

cons time of course on school night 7:51 I think this is part six of the supernatural book of Acts Church Lord willing on Sunday I'll have a little more time and I like to go over just some of the highlights of what I enjoyed you know on last Sunday's messages I was really blessed hope you were to by the grace of the Lord and you know I just fting you know and brother Samuel mentioned how he likes our singing you know that's another preacher coming in saying how much he likes our s very thankful for how you worship the Holy Spirit and the spirit and Truth hallelu Grand preachers don't have to come in here and rebuke us and say you need to sing more you need to sometimes that happens that's kind of what happened if you listen to cam service brother bod come in there and he really rebuked him cam got up there and said we needed this rebuke so but I'm sure we all we all need to rebuke about something praise God we all need God's grace we want to receive it God rebukes all his children praise God anyone that is a child of God gets rebuked by the Holy Spirit from time to time so we're thankful again for God's grace thank you for the good fellowship and all the support for two Services there brother said Okay so let's read this here quite a striking scripture to read here as far as a maybe an aggressive scripture this is the Holy Spirit speaking remember here in the book of Acts church and this is the holy spirit rebuking we'd say demon-possessed Pharisees right demon possessed Pharisees this is what the Holy Spirit would say as reviewed remember then right after this the Holy Spirit offers Mercy right because Stephen says father Lord don't lay this to their charge isn't that just like God he gives us a stronger ruk that doesn't mean he's always going to hate us or's he's going to ever going to hate us but he gives us a sharp rebuke to wake us up out of our Slumber right right and he says now come to me that's right now do something about the rebuke receive the rebuke let's read this on three ready one two three ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do God bless you as you're being seated there may God bless reading of his word I like to uh you switch over just for a little bit I don't have all my uh I don't have all my notes on here but I just do want to show a few things here just keep this in mind here's a little chart I made I was mentioning it last week you know so I I did a list of the nine gifts in the book of Acts church and I I'll keep this going Lord willing if I can keep the inspiration you know sometimes I'll jump in and out of series I've just kind of been keeping track of the verse in the book of Acts and the gifts that manifest the one thing that was notable last week I said there was six but when I was reading today uh what was interesting about the lame man that walked the Bible said his name through faith in his name made this man whole so either the man had the faith or Peter had the faith but the the whole thing was a miracle right the Bible calls it plainly a notable Miracle but it took Faith to operate the miracle so um I just thought I would you know share that by God's grace you know get on you know we're going to see prophecy remember agabus prophesies he said there's a Dar coming uh and so be prepared for that you know there's kind of reminds us of Joseph the Old Testament seven good years and seven awful years God's given us a lot of good years praise God now despite the inflation we still had good years praise God we still have everything we need no one starving we still have a lot of great Blessings by God's grace now knowledge I think we're going to see that in uh from my understanding uh we'll see that in Acts chapter 8 where Phillip is translated and the unic says I'm reading Isaiah 53 who is this spoken of who is this all about and then the Bible said Philip preaches one service or one one little message to this unic and he gives him understanding of who it's talking about so understanding is knowledge so we'll see you know the first uh eight of the nine gifts will be covered in the first eight chapters of the book of Acts so uh is that a help by God's grace just to kind of see that remember this covers 30 years or 28 we talked about last week you know somewhere around almost three decades so we don't know how many miracles you know we're we're in this entire span of time I imagine many but this is what God records in the book of Acts and so it's neat to see you know uh which ones of these were actually in a church service no no CU this was out on the street uh that was that was Doctrine was teaching house to house lay man know that was public the sermon of Peter that was just kind of like in a a personal meeting with Peter that really wasn't a church service um the shadow that's probably wasn't a church service probably out out in the out in the street or something like that teaching and then Steven's wisdom uh he had wisdom that they he when he was kind of surrounded by the council so I don't think that was in a church service either so that's one thing to keep in mind you know we want to have all the gifts operating but I said I've SE we've seen them all operate within the last 10 years or so we've seen them all operate now we'd like to see them more right here just because we love the experience of the presence of God brother R said when the gifts operate this is what brother said I don't have the quote ready but I could find it R said when gifts operate in the church it's the closest thing you'll ever have to heaven on Earth until the Millennium right Hallelujah so he said that Thrills every person's heart right to be able to know wow I'm in the presence of God we felt I really felt that on Sunday morning I really felt you know the presence of God it was a beautiful uh atmosphere and of course Sunday night was great too but I think I was if you're like me I was kind of worn out by Sunday night we that's just how our church is like I told Brother Brooks I told Brother C I said we can do a couple services but after that we get worn out but that's everybody right that's every church that's not just us that's everybody so no shame on us no shame on anybody just can't keep it up for you know you just do the best you can and so U I just thought I'd share that with you now I'm going to unplug here because I don't have any other notes really I just got a couple of visuals I do want to show eventually but I'll look at part six here by God's grace and I want to pick up right where I left off I left off with this quote from the church age book brother R said until God stops calling the Pentecostal message of power will not cease okay so there is no cease today even though maybe we haven't seen a dead person raised I've never seen a dead person raised we may not have seen a lame man walk we know the power though is still here amen we got to remind ourselves of that right we got to remind ourselves because so often we just get into the the routine of life that's why we constantly need Revival praise God Amen Revival every day I know about you but after that Sunday morning service I fell on a cloud n with faith I don't know I just but then by the afternoon come I was out of energy and I I was in trouble you know having the faith you uh but I really felt strong faith after that morning service I felt like it was anointing me uh to believe God's word and so I reached out to numerous people on my drive to get the food you know I was reaching out and sending words of encouragement I felt like while the anointings here I'm not going to be afraid I'm going to send I'm going to send these texts and messages amen and some of them were received by God's grace but we must keep that in mind the power doesn't cease you know I've shared different testimonies from different messages churches over the last few years you know leukemia healings and uh other other ministers testifying that um you know the lame have walked in their services children that couldn't walked can now walk in the message churches so uh that it goes around it happens by God's grace the power does not cease Hallelujah and we must be ready we must be willing as brother Samuel preached we must be willing and ready at any time to be the channel that God can use for that amen and where we've seen it is where we've seen it numerous times just speaking the word right speaking to the mountain that's where I've seen it you know numerous cases with sick people um or like with Brian Hawkins you know just you know he's got the degenerative hips and I just spoke it I said I'm speaking life into these hips in Jesus Christ's name I didn't know what I was doing I didn't know that hips couldn't regenerate I just was moved by the Holy Spirit to say that and then his doctor's like this has never happened before you know uh just Rejoice uh and so God's power is here we just want to be yielded to that power praise God and he says what the church brother said what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right so it's our right to have exactly what they had at Pentecost we could we can pray for that we can desire that we can know it's ours praise God am that's why I I I always try to never be encouraged I'll just keep coming back to church one of these Services is going to hit praise God never know when that's why you don't want to miss any hallelujah amen I want to be there when it happens by God's grace amen Hallelujah because God the wind blows and no one knows when it's coming except God knows when it's coming Hallelujah I just want to be in the right place at the right time I want to be able to say I was there when the spirit came Hallelujah I felt his power and I praise His name Hallelujah that's right but this is our right so that's why we keep coming back to God we keep praying we keep believing one of these times it's going to hit praise God God's power is going to the Bible said the power of God will be present to heal hallelujah amen and so brother Ram quotes this scripture Hebrews 2 1-4 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we've heard lest at any time we should let them slip so see we can't let things slip too far out of our memory he's talking about the power of the Holy Ghost down the power we can't let the power slip out for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience to the word received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will there's the key right there his own will praise God Amen how many miracles did John the Baptist do zero it wasn't God's will how many miracles did Brother Ram do many more Hallelujah many many many right he said many that are even recording the Bible because there's not a lot recorded in the Bible compared to like a person's lifelong ministry right as far as number of recorded miracles in the Bible and so we can't let them slip in other words we can't let this great salvation we've got a great salvation we can't let that slip our minds like well I don't know if God can do this or I don't know if God can sa that person of course he can praise God but it's got to be according to God's Will and we can't let that slip we can't let it give up we got to keep trying right the church will always try to be like the book of Acts Church amen amen so brother ra says now I want to read something right after this here he says uh the original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern that's what we looked at last week by God's grace we're doing everything in our power to stay true to this patter PN amen right but remember within the pattern there's room for Liberty so going back to Simon's example a Simon may have All These Blueprints I'll have to ask him about this when he gets back from Thailand but I imagine you know there's some Liberty in other words you could buy this brand of a pipe now what's the name brand of a pipe I don't know Johnson timkin probably not timkin but you know or maybe you can have a different quality of a pipe there there's liberty maybe you want a plastic cor maybe you want a a a stainless steel one maybe you want to Steel one you know but there's liberty within the blueprint and I'm not I didn't forget the one I'm going to share with you on Sunday night I'm going to share that one with you I didn't share there's something I couldn't really T teach on well maybe I'll just share it brly I just share broadly here then we'll talk about it Sunday night and my wife's looking at me you better be careful what you say I'm like I'm gonna try I'll just share like this I'll share it more broadly um when a pastor's wife dies should that Pastor keep preaching because now he's not the husband of one wife anymore right it just happens in the message often you know preachers get older okay how about if a preacher How about if he's faithful to God but his wife leaves him and divorces should he continue preaching see we'll talk about that on Sunday night because remember there brother said brother was a pastor yet he didn't have a wife and children remember that see makes us all quiet start thinking what would I do if I good thing I'm not in that situation that's what I say good thing I'm not in this situation he said now don't get L astray here when I said that God and his ways never changed this is brother brandom I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't God the church is in God said so she can change but what I said was that because of the unchanging God and with unchanging ways we can go back back to the beginning and see what the first and perfect ACT of God was and then judge by that standard he said that is how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original one at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one amen hallelujah so see as soon as Ephesus fell remember Ephesus left the first love it's the first church age and after that they kept losing Revelation losing Revelation to the fourth Church age and then the fifth Church age God started restoring justification by faith amen but remember Church even John Wesley was a trinitarian right right he was still a TR it wasn't until this age these last 117 or 18 years now that we got the revelation of the godhead back we got the right water baptism back God is restoring we're in the midst of God restoring and we're thankful to be a part of it praise God God is restored now each one of those men had joh John Wesley Martin Luther had Mighty mer mirales of healing and Supernatural praise God and so did brother Brandon praise God if you look at your life you'll see miracles in your life too praise God but remember it does not cease we cannot get complacent we got to keep the revival going hallelujah amen you can't let the supernatural slip we got to always believe in that praise God we've always got to pray for it Hallelujah and be willing to cry out to God for more of it praise God Amen now um now why I say this I want to read that quote I read last week it's from questions answer part three 1964 they asked brother brandom uh about do we have to come to the church for perfecting in other words do we have to come to Bram Tabernacle to be perfected brother said no they want to come here to the church for the perfecting no we get Fellowship one with another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and God now I made a video about this in if you if you go back and listen to the whole quote brother R's talking to a man who thinks he has to move from Spokane Washington to Jefferson vill indana to be perfected and brother trying to tell him you don't have to move here to be perfected in other words you don't have to be around the prophet to be perfected Hallelujah you don't have to now it's going to help you yes there are benefits to being around a prophet right if you're a friend of a prophet you get a prophet's reward praise God that's what the Bible says there's many rewards to being a prophet but um but in this case or to being associated with the prophet but in this case brother Ram's kind of discerning and saying uh this church you know uh you don't get perfected just by coming to this church you get fellowship at the church but the real perfecting notice he says between you and Christ not between you and me amen right so see how he's already batt that tape Church movement I mean course it was always there R called it a serpent in 1961 he called it a devil he called it a a demon serpent that spirit that would worship brother Bradon he says the blood of Christ is what perfects Us in the Holy Spirit he said now he said the church says he says the church has the gifts operating now no this is brother's exact quote now we do not have too many gifts operating here but we have some of them I'm going to read it again we do not have too many gifts uh operating here but we have some of them this is in 1964 a year before he goes off the scene we have gift of tongues and the gift of prophecy two or three of them end quote okay so see sometimes we got to be careful not to put tooo much emphasis on gifts but at the same time gifts can't be our absolute but at the same time we can't let them slip so what we got to do we got to find that middle of the road amen I'm not lost if I don't have a gift or I can't make a gift happen I'm not lost if I don't have gifts but at the same time I can't forget about them I've got to always believe in them I got to know that God's Powers not cease Hallelujah and like brother said brother said power comes with sincerity and we got to look at our lives and say perhaps we're not seeing more gifts because we're not as sincere as we could be praise God right it's just something it's just something like a cycle it's a cycle of Revival from time to time we got to go back and say am I being sincere enough and I got to ask myself that almost every service praise God so do you are we are we sincere enough so it it's not a Salvation issue or I'm not a saved issue about the gifts because brother R doesn't even have all nine of them and this is the this is the year before he goes off the scene and remember God couldn't God wouldn't take him till God was done with him right right right so we don't want to put too much emphasis on the gifts and we don't want to make certain quotes about gifts thus say the Lord if they're not thus say the Lord hallelujah but we cannot let them slip praise God hallelujah we cannot let the gift slip which means we got to stay true to God hallelujah uh we got to have faith we got to have faith building messages amen hallelujah that's what I need help with too and I'm sure all of us want to have faith building messages hallelujah amen I think these ser about the book of Acts should build our faith don't you am if he's the same yesterday today and forever then the book of Acts is still going on praise God am sometimes we got to shake ourselves remember the book of Acts is still going on I'm you and I are a continuation of the book of Acts hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah I mean uh it's this the thought just came to me it just it was just so clear uh two things I want to share about Guyana especially when I get went to Ghana when I went to Ghana we went out and preached on the street twice just we went right to this open Village it looked like a bunch of I hate to say it but it looks like their houses look like a bunch of chicken coops that's how small their houses were we just set up we just plugged in some electricity set up a mic and I had this thought come to me and I was going to and all as we drove through Guyana all I saw was all these Buddhist temples and so the scripture come to me act 17 you have all these Gods but you did the the god that you worship you don't even know there's an unknown God his name is Jesus Christ and church God's my witness I'm holding my iPad preaching that and while I'm preaching that people are getting uh I'm feeling led by the Holy Spirit and all of a sudden this demon-possessed man I didn't realize it was demon possessed man until later he said why do you keep looking at your notes preacher and I just kind of ignored him you know because I just I look at my notes I don't have my sermons memorized I wish I had that gift but I don't stand the mirror like some preachers in practice like you know uh like Joe olol he practices how he's going to say everything I'll practice Saturday night so I can memorize it to the people I don't want to scripted sermon like that I want a holy ghost anointed sermon praise God there's nothing I guess there's nothing wrong with that I'm not trying to be critical but but look you know you don't preach against homosexuality and lets women preach and everything like that wears makeup when he preaches a man wearing makeup come on goodness gracious you would think you would think people would see it but he kept battling me he kept battling me I just kind of I was just young in the faith I wish I would have been a little older amen I just would have rebuked I would have rebuked him in the name of Jesus Christ but he just badgered me the whole service and after that a couple people come up for prayer the next Sunday people came from that and got baptized I was already gone but brother Max said one or two I think a family or one or two people come in and got baptized from that Outreach service there but that was showing me that was like a real clipse in the book of Acts we're bringing the gospel to a a town that never heard it before and what is there Sayan is always rising up trying to criticize preachers just like that demon possessed woman that was going after Paul these men are the preachers of Salvation these men are the Real Men of God and they're uh making fun of me because I'm looking at my notes well I'll don't know what to do next time if the Holy Spirit reminds me Hallelujah I'll rebuke that Spirit Jesus even read the Bible one time he looked down at his notes and he read Isaiah it wasn't notes it was just the scripture and the other thing was you know it was very easy for me to see in Guyana that I was a part of the book of Acts Church you know sometimes you know it was hard on my wife and it was hard on me mostly hard on her but I'd be gone sometimes 12 or 13 days but during that time I got really built up on faith and one time that that first trip I went although I was all bid up with mosquitoes all my legs were covered in red dots all the why they sure got my I slept in a net that was trying to keep the mosquitoes out it's almost like the net let the mosquitoes in anyway I was so moved by the Holy Spirit something struck me I'm preaching all these young people and I said I don't know it was just on a it was like on a Saturday morning I'm preaching right by the lake and there's all these young people sitting there in chairs and the boldness of the Holy Spirit Come on me and I said if God doesn't vindicate this message then I'm a false preacher that's quite a statement I didn't know how God was going to vindicate it but I saw by the end I said all these all these young people had never been baptized and I said if you want to be baptized if you want to be saved I just I just realized it right at the end I said you you come down to the water I said I'll be the the first one to run down there and a line of young people maybe 10 15 I always exaggerate so just bear with me maybe 10 20 30 but I remember the last one that come up was the pastor son he's a young teenager at that point and he come up I said brother I said I'm not going to baptize your son you baptize your son Hallelujah Nathaniel what's his name and we buried in the name of Jesus Christ we're all shouting rejoicing I go for a little swim afterwards in my full suit I have my full suit on I got sand all over my suat but it was work it was 95 degrees you know but it was so clear demons fighting us people getting saved and then the boldness to speak God's word and instantly let's say 10 or 20 people baptize in the name of Jesus Christ it's easy to see in that place but sometimes it gets hard when we when our lives become common here in the United States and so we can't let things become common we got to remember the power doesn't cease God doesn't change but sometimes the church changes if we change for the worst we got to Humble ourselves and and change and get back to the better praise God Amen Hallelujah now this is why I didn't get to last week I want to say this as well we are in the process of restoration and God has greatly restored our church remember the uh I I listened in my book there's 14 doctrines that we have that are restored to us that almost no other church has so I'm going to run through real quickly how many remember the 14 how many remember as you as I go you remember uh we condemn homosexual relationships that's what Paul did right second we condemn adulteries right and couples being married more than once like I said almost almost every one of my aunts and uncles is married two times maybe more third we condemn fornication right a lot of churches they celebrate when people live together before they're married we've seen it we've went to wedding like that one time third murder right people murder through a uh birth control pills they murder babies oh it's okay to take birth control bills if you want to be a murderer it's okay but it's not okay with God fifth women preachers now most churches have women preachers six substance abuse right the Bible says if you're not holy you will not see God right but most most churches let you drink especially drink they'll let you drink or smoke uh casual drink has just become the social Norm now everybody goes out to drink and they think they can Witness by drinking now that's not what Jesus did Jesus had a water down line right because the water was not healthy to drink remember that to okay eight viewing sinful movies and television shows yet Paul says avoid all appearance of evil n they have shameful hair lengths now that's almost every single church right remember it's a shame it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair it's a shame for a man to have long hair uh next is false conversions they say you're converted uh and you're filled with the Holy Ghost just when you say a scripted sinner's prayer in modest clothing that's almost every Church how many feel pretty restored now feel pretty good Hallelujah I'm only at uh I'm only at 10 I've only gone through 10 I'm feeling pretty clean up here by God's grace Hallelujah I ought to be because I've been washed By the Waters of the word amen hallelujah I ought to feel clean tonight Hallelujah 11th water baptisms are done in the literal name of Jesus Christ uh 12 Believers are taught to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul so Soul Hallelujah and there's three works of Grace 13 God is one person not three persons and 14 14 uh the supernatural power currently operates all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost any church outside of a Pentecostal Church doesn't believe that right a lot of churches don't even believe in the five-fold ministry now there's 14 Pauline gospels I'm sorry Pauline doctrines most churches don't have but you and I got it we're restored amen Church believe it you are a part you are a continuation of the book of Acts hallelujah praise God and then the 15th one is not in the New Testament necessarily but men and women wear separate garments right Jesus wore men's garments not women's garments so we would imagine that would continue in the New Testament hallelujah it's an Abomination for a man to wear a woman's garment and so forth Hallelujah so there's 15 right there so we are part of the restored book of Acts Church Hallelujah that's what Jesus said in Matthew 17:11 Elijah will come and restore all things Joel 2 23-26 I'll restore sayeth the Lord amen hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah so in at least these 14 ways and I'd imagine there's more than that I'm for sure there's more than that but that's what I had time to study off or study on when I wrote that book there by God's grace Hallelujah because what about uh what about feeding the poor not all churches do that some Churches don't even care about the poor but God sees you when you help out the poor amen we've helped people get cars in our church numerous people right how many churches do that so Church you know praying and fasting how many churches do that we're more like the book of Acts Church than what we think hallelujah amen glory all right now that's my little introduction there Hallelujah now let's go to Acts chapter 6 that's why I didn't finish from last week I finish whenever I have questions church I always go back to that we have at least 14 whenever mind battles you know something wrong with the church or something wrong with me I always go back to that we are part of the restored book of Acts church amen hallelujah and church many of those I shouldn't say many but maybe half of those 14 or 15 we have thus say the Lord on so we have the gift of prop we have the voice of the Holy Spirit Plus the Bible Prophet Bible you know we have thus sayith the Lord so what do you resting your soul on I'm resting my soul on the word of God hallelujah hallelujah okay so Acts chapter 6 now we I want to just uh pick up where Stephen gets uh accused now in verse 13 acts 613 he gets some false Witnesses against him then verse 14 for we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place place and shall change the Customs which Moses delivered us hallelujah now I don't know what Steven said about that but uh Jesus did say all these stones will be thrown down did he not what was he prophesying 40 years Titus is coming and not one stone will be left on another but see they took this as an attack they took prophecy as an attack against them well it was a rebuke against them but they took it as a personal attack against them and did Jesus change the customs of Moses did he change them absolutely he fulfilled them all right cuz he never sinned and then he changed them through St Paul and the church said right Paul said you no longer got to do circumcision right no longer got to eat meat on these certain days and abstain and all this all this ceremonial things no longer got to do that I'm changing Moses's Customs amen hallelujah amen was he was Stephen right he was absolutely right Hallelujah there were some things that were going continue that was in Acts chapter 15 remember those four things you know eating blood we went through that uh fornication strangled things I can never remember the fourth one I always forget the fourth one anybody remember no it's okay I I didn't expect anybody to remember I could always forget that fourth one um and so all these things were true but they took it as an attack and church that's what's going to happen to America all the things we're preaching they're going to hate us for and they're going to want to kill americ that's what the Bible says Revelation 13 they're going to kill anyone who doesn't take the Mark is that right you can see it now how they already hate conservatives talk about the government the US government they're already jailing conservatives and they'll let uh liberals do way more than what the conservatives did and they don't even get charged right so we can see it's in the process may God give us Grace Hallelujah as we heard not to fear here but to be ready praise God the bride has made herself ready amen that's right we got to make ready by the word of God and all that sat in the counsil looked steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an Angel Hallelujah he was so much like Christ he looked like he'd been with Christ literally in with a theop body now chapter 7 verse one then the high priest I'm sorry then said the high priest are these things so and he said men and Brethren and fathers hearken now I like this does Stephen address or I'm sorry does Stephen directly answer this question no no said are these things so he says men and Brethren let me talk to you little bit remember brother said Stephen was not a preacher Hallelujah brother Ram says Stephen A Man full of the Holy Ghost this is from 1953 Resurrection the Bible said how could you stop him why he was like a house on fire in dry weather on a windy day I don't know if the girls remember but we had some pretty good fires on some windy days right it almost got the tree almost the peach tree almost got caught on fire my wife's looking at me again like I shouldn't have done that that's my fault I didn't realize how dry it was but brother R said that's what Stephen was like he was on fire and the Winds of the holy spirit amen we're blowing making it more bold all the time hallelujah amen glory that's what they prayed for after they first got the Holy Ghost they got some discouragement what did they pray for more boldness praise God Amen what does God want for us for you and I to be bold with the word of God Amen I started carrying these in my pocket on Monday uh I I kept asking Lord you know I figured out I I I felt the Holy Spirit gave me that question these are my books and I I I'm trying to be more bold I haven't had opportunity but my desire is when I see somebody and they make eye contact and say hi I want to say hey I got a question for I've done this before I just haven't done it lately but I want to be more bold I want to say do you know anybody wants to read a book about Jesus and then I can give them this if they say yes if not then that they'll be judged on the day of judgment they didn't want to read about Jesus so it's a great it's a great question right but I've had them in my pocket all week I just haven't ran into anybody yet so I guess I need to spend more time out in public but I want to be more bold because Stephen was bold he was like a dry stick on a windy day on fire hallelujah amen brother said why you couldn't put him out if you had to hallelujah amen only way they could stop him was to kill him he was full of the Holy Ghost he wasn't no preacher he was just a deacon just a deacon yeah he's a man full of Miracle so we know he wasn't just a deacon right and I know brother didn't mean it that that way but I want you to remember this let's respect this man this was a mighty man of Faith he was out on the street testifying in glorifying God they couldn't stop him the Holy Ghost had so wrapped him up till he wasn't his own he only looked through God's eyes he only seen what God seen he only acted on what God Said and he said verse Two Men and Brethren fathers hearken the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Cher and said to him get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and come into the land which I will show thee remember church he left not knowing where he was going so don't feel discouraged if you kind of you have an idea what God wants you to do but you don't know all the details don't feel discouraged be encouraged you're a child of Abraham remember the Bible said you walk in the steps of faithful Abraham praise God the main thing to do is leave where you were at praise God act upon God's word do what the Bible says hallelujah amen leave your old sinful life behind leave that all behind and follow Jesus hallelujah amen I got to tell numerous people over the weekend I went to this uh game I got to go to the game uh with my friends and my mom I got to tell numerous friends I said I was like Abraham God called me away from my family to be a preacher to feed God's people in a I I got to tell all of them I said these games don't matter what matters is serving Jesus Christ they said how you feel being around the games you miss the games I'm like well yeah I miss them but it all passes away and pretty soon all that's left is your life and your walk with God and that's the main thing your walk with Christ praise God hallelujah so like Abraham verse uh four yeah then came he out of the land of the Chans and dwelt in cheron and from then when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell and he gave him none other inheritance didn't know not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to a seed after him when he was yet had no child look at that God promised him all this land but did he get any of it not much of it see God might make you all these promises you might not get it though to the other side oh and I don't care I don't care if I get it now I just want it in the Millennium praise God hallelujah I don't care how much land I get here I don't have a full acre land yeah but it don't even matter what matters is God has promised us great rewards great blessings if we follow his leadership praise God if we walk like Abraham walked walking lives of Faith hallelujah amen glory look at that verse five he didn't have he have none of it but yet God promised it to him remember the Bible said in Hebrews 11 many of them died not receiving the promise did God lie nope God's got a better revelation of it for you amen God's got a better understanding of This Promise than you have of it Hallelujah that's right verse six and God spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a Strange Land and that they should bring him into bondage and in treat them evil 400 years now I've said this before but imagine within that 400 years what if you were one of the generations that didn't see Moses right and you had to live your life in slavery would you still praise God would you still found a Reas reason to praise would you been singing stomping on the mud bricks I still got a reason to praise praise someday God's going to send a prophet someday and someday he's finally came Hallelujah well that's kind of like we are brother ra said the church WIll slug along he said from service to service but one day Jesus is coming back amen hallelujah amen let's be his faithful as we can Hallelujah we don't know which generation is going to be but let's not let these things slip let let's believe God's word let's be faithful to Christ hallelujah oh I love this 400 years you're always talking when are we going to get out of here when do we get out of here maybe it's not for your day that's why I said Lord if it's not my time to be in the Rapture then let me just be as faithful as I can while I have life I won't beit I'll be disappointed a little bit but I'll have enough hopefully I have enough maturity to know that God's perfect will was for me to die M and not and not cheat death it was for the Next Generation or the Next Generation thereafter I'm not going to get mad at God Amen I'll say this God isn't late either the Rapture will be right on time amen but said the Rapture is not one second late hallelujah amen God's got a purpose there's

brother said brother they said brother stop making Tes brother said I'm making more Tes amen hallelujah I'm making more videos amen I'm preaching more sermons amen we're praying more we're singing more we're worshiping God more because that's the secret praise God Amen never let the devil talk you out of doing more for God Amen now we all need breaks and vacations brother would brother would take two weeks three weeks out in the wilderness right and as far as I know but amen wouldn't preach out there so the devil might say oh you're not preaching up you're not preaching well I got to restore my mind I got to restore my body so I can't go back and preach it yes so I'm not saying don't take vacations I love summer vacation if anybody loves summer vacation it's I'm saying have it in your heart know where you're at with God and and take a little break right or when you need a rest take a rest let's say I'm get right back to it praise God Amen that's the secret the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raise up a stand you rally around to the word of God you say I'm I just only begun to fight praise God I've only just started to fight praise God hallelujah I love that now in this chapter here I'm not going to read all it because I'm running short on time I'm down to 15 minutes to my hour but if you haven't read it for a while um Stephen not preaches but he tests ifies about God with Abraham god with Jacob god with Joseph Moses and then he goes to Solomon okay so let's skip down to that one start at verse 51 Act 7 and 51 and some of these I just can't preach every single verse for the sake of time actually you know let's go to 47 pardon me oh yeah also spoke of David sorry Miss David after Moses he goes to David pardon but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things Hallelujah praise God so God so Stephen is used by the Holy Ghost to remind these worshippers of the temple Prophet worshippers they worship Moses said they made a tradition out of his life right they had the mission of the which was their own interpretation of what Moses said they were Prophet worshippers and he said and he tells them God doesn't dwell in temples made with Man Hands in other words you can't put God in your temple that kind of Temple the temple God wants to live in is your temple praise God your soul praise God Amen your soul then he want he wants to anoint your mind he wants to anoint your body he wants your Tabernacle as we heard so wonderfully on Sunday he wants to anoint your Tabernacle so he can manifest his presence to other people hallelujah you know my teacher I we were praying for earlier my teacher on U Aid we were just talking and she just want she just started saying she said she said Mr Smith she said can I just tell you something I said yeah I didn't know what to expect she said you're I've been in a lot of teacher's classroom she said you're the only teacher that I've ever seen that allows love in your classroom because when the kids are hurt I just go up and hug them sometimes I whisper a prayer for them Lord Jesus have mercy but then when other kids are sad I'll let the other ones go up and give them a hug and she said I in all these classrooms you're the only teacher teacher that allows love in your classroom I said you know what I said that's cuz I'm a Christian Jesus said you know my disciples because of their love one for another and then right after that was when I prayed for because I like oh you open the door I'm coming in start talking about love I'm I'm coming with Jesus I said can I pray for you she said of course I pray for you and she was almost crying by that she was kind of wiping her tears got all this makeup on you but almost crying by the end because God wants to live in our Tabernacle amen God wants to uh flow through you Hallelujah God wants to flow through me God wants to be a channel for you and I we were praying also for our coworker I pray with the teachers every Tuesday morning I think we have three or four teachers and I said let's just remember I said let's remember we prayed in my I said we prayed in my room about 10 years ago and God healed Kylie Ros of cancer I came through medicine but God still healed her yes that's right and then another another boy named Landon God healed him of cancer and we prayed in my in my classroom I said we're just in a different classroom let's believe God let's ask God and let's let's trust that all things are possible the believe amen now God might take the coworker but I just want to try to encourage our faith the apostolic age has not ceased amen hallelujah it's still a continuation of the book of Acts hallelujah amen now hath not my hand made all these things now so we have this uh this this truth Solomon built him a house and of course David did before Moses did but God can't be contained in a house right he says the heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot what house will you build me Hallelujah so this you know go just creation is just a small thing god holds all creation think of all the trillions and billions of stars and planets we went over a couple years ago all that just he holds that in his hand Hallelujah he's so great verse 51 ye stiff NE and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost that's what brother Ben was rebuking people that won't say Amen people that won't raise their hands in worship he said people that will fall asleep in the service right I thought you preach it brother Ben preach it brother and we got him coming maybe he'll preach that us hopefully we don't need it you know but people will sit back and they won't get into the spirit you come here to get in God's spirit I come here to be moved by God hallelujah I don't know everything I'm going to say I want to be open so God can use me to speak his word see if people don't worship if they don't really worship if they don't really pray if they don't say Amen you're resisting the Holy Spirit and we don't want that right we want to welcome the Holy Spirit yes amen but it's each each each person's individual choice yes now in this case the Pharisees were stiff necked and uncircumcised in both heart and ears they still had hearts of stone to the gospel amen hallelujah and ears they couldn't hear they they didn't have uh the eyes of Isa didn't have ears that could hear and they always resisted the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost trying to say there's been a transition from Moses to Jesus amen hallelujah there's a transition Hallelujah and they couldn't see it they resisted the transition now look they stayed in their old way of life we can't stay in an old way of life we got to accept God's new way of life Hallelujah we got to accept New Life Hallelujah and brother s and I were talking he reminded me of when brother BR went beyond the current of time it was such an impactful thing he says I've got to convince more people to come here yeah he said I'm not the same brother brother Brandon now that's what I want church that's I'm sure that's what you want too I want to have Services where whoever's pre I don't care if I'm preaching or who's preaching but I want to leave out of here knowing I'm a different Jesse Smith praise God because the brother said I'm a new brother brandom I'm G to be a new amen Lee hallelujah our new Malachi Smith Hallelujah that that's the reality of it praise God and that's what happens when we accept the leadership of the holy spirit amen like I said even just something like this just being I want to be more aware I want to be knew Jesse Smith I going to be more bold for Christ amen I want to be able to pray for my uh co-workers as soon as they say I want to pray for my students I want boldness I want to be uh I want to remember that I have authority in the presence of God hallelujah I have authority and God May answer my prayer or he may not but one thing I I got to remember I do have authority in the presence of God I'm a Child of God God showed me I've spoken the word on three or four occasions and it actually came to pass that shows it wasn't my word it was God's word amen right Hallelujah now stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart ears which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted in other words you are always persecutors you are always violent you're always murderers right your family you know just have a history of of V vience a history of aggression let's have a history of Mercy let's have a history of Holiness so nobody can look at our church and say you guys got a history of church splitting right like we were talking about one I don't want a history of church splitting I want a history of everybody likes our singing every preacher that comes in here likes to hear you sing amen I want I want a history of wow those were deep Revelations the holy spirit let us into praise God Amen how the history of you guys really know how to dance and rejoice before the Lord praise God Amen AR the history of you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover praise God Amen but the holy spirit says you're stiff necked uncircumcised and Harden ears you always resist the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Stephen was testified about the Holy Ghost uh that would uh feed the widows the Christian widows everything the the holy ghost that healed the lame man they resist to that and it was a sin he said then yet they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have now been betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept think about that their ancestors had got the word from Angels but now they're filled with Devils right it's it only been 1500 years since Moses in 1500 years they went from angels to devils and the Holy Ghost told them exactly what they were see I I look and see what preachers say about us when they come and it always comes out good that we're serving God Amen because I come here I say Lord if we need to rebuke give me a rebie and the church said amen Lord if I need encouragement give me encouragement amen if I need healing give me healing amen boldness he whatever whatever it is if I need boldness if I need uh sincerity whatever I need just give it to me Lord amen see the Holy Ghost won't hold it back rebuke if we need one Hallelujah he says so they went from angels to being filled with demons went from Holy Angels to Fallen Angels now church this had to have cut them the Bible said cut them to the heart why because they knew Deuteronomy 10:16 circumcised therefore the foreskin of your heart Moses had already told him ain't that something they say we're relying on Moses and then he quotes Moses your own Prophet said this we can do the same thing all these tape worshippers but your Prophet said Perfection comes with the fivefold ministry that's what the Bible says hallelujah amen I mean how many how many times with all their 24 lies we can always go back and said but the prophet said this right right praise God and so we know if they don't repent they'll be judged by the very Prophet that they said they believe didn't Jesus say that Moses will judge you that's why we really got to do what brother Ram said as long as it lines up in the Bible let's do what brother Ram said amen because it's the Bible truth hallelujah am it's a Bible Foundation see the the Pharisees were condemned by Moses because they didn't really believe Moses's word because Moses wrote of Jesus amen that's right Hallelujah didn't they know uh Deuteronomy 30:6 and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with that thou mayest live so see when God circumcises your heart you love the Lord amen more than money amen hallelujah more than popularity God circumcised your heart you love God see you get a circumcised heart then you love God you don't love the things of the world you love being a Christian amen amen amen thank God and not and Stephen said it right to them these are the very scriptures you say you believe and they didn't believe him Jeremiah 4:3 said for thus sayith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem break up the follow ground and so not among Thorns see that's Thorns were cares of the world remember that the thir the Third ground you can't have thorns in your heart and expect God's word to bring forth of its fruit amen it chokes it out there's not enough room for the world and God's word we got to have only God's word circumcise yourselves to the Lord and take away the foreskin of your heart ye men of Judah inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my Fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quch it because of the evil of your doings Hallelujah Church we've seen numerous testimonies I've shared some of them if these message people don't repent of their pride they're going to get burned with fire right yes even denominational right whoever it is if they don't keep God's word God will rebuke them that's a good sign God loves him amen hallelujah Romans uh 2:29 honey Romans 229 I'm almost almost at my hour this says I got two more minutes I got two minutes maybe I need some overtime see but he's a Jew which is won inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart and the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God now we're not Jews but spiritual Jew is just a term it just means I'm a real spiritual Seed of Abraham that's all it means amen amen in one way the Gentiles replace the Jews as the bride but it's not the full replacement where God's done the Jews God's still going to have a Jewish people saved that's right so there there's some there's some preachers that say not in the message but there's preachers that's called the replacement theology like Gentiles totally rep replace the Jews and the Jews are no longer saved that's not it that's not what that verse is saying it just saying it just says the real believer that is a real Seed of Abraham doesn't just have a natural circumcision it's a spiritual circumcision amen and there's been a permanent surgery in their soul praise God hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost had is a sharp sword brother amen and it cuts away all those old habits and you never go back to it praise God I've had a permanent surgery and ain't coming back hallelujah amen now I want to uh look at this thought here now verse 54 when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth I'll tell you want to get a message person mad that's got a wrong Spirit show them their own hypocrisy that's when they're going to really mad how do I know because it happened a lot this week on YouTube I showed them their hypocrisy they call me this this this they call me all these things and this one guy's like I'm praying for you you've you've suffered so many scars I'm like well some of them are not really the it's not too bad sick words really really words really don't hurt me that much anymore you know over the Internet they don't hurt me too bad I appre appreciate the guy praying for me but you want to get somebody mad remember the devil's always going to accuse you through that person of what that person is guilty of always always like uh the brother that left the message he come to me and just sent me a text and said oh you don't do enough research that's what he's guilty of because he won't then he said I don't have time to read your book okay now we know now we know who won't do the research right right so whenever they accuse of if you confessed it right you're forgiven that's what they're guilty of all the people that have accused me in this church and left that's what they were guilty of they had issues with money if they're accusing me of that or they had issues of false prophecy that one sister I'm not laughing but I'm just saying it's just it's just just making me aware now she's the one that falsely prophesied something I didn't falsely prophesy anything I just said I really think that brother's going to come in the message someday let's pray that he comes in the message that's all I said come to find out they're the one that's guilty that because that sister would say the Lord told me this the Lord told me that I don't know if you remember who I'm talking about H but they would say she would say the Lord told me this the Lord told me the Lord didn't tell her nothing because what she said didn't come to pass the very thing the devil and that person is guilty of they'll accuse you of that but I've learned just always turn it around back on them Hallelujah this have been some spiritual warfare this week Hallelujah got the sharp sword of the word of God hallelujah nashed on their teeth boy they got real mad they weren't really smiling wasn't a real happy uh wasn't happy congregation that night but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven look he sees a vision he sees the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God hallelujah praise God oh my goodness in our deepest moments of persecution our moments of life and death may we see Jesus Hallelujah God help me to have a vision of Jesus or at least feel his presence or feel a wind or some anointing in my hardest moments have mercy on me Lord and let me see Jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen look how Jesus comes on the scene he didn't have to give him a vision Stephen couldn't make a vision Jesus gave him that Vision in his in his what was going to be his worst or hardest moment there Hallelujah reminds me of The Lamplighter book there the Ser of the spend way every time he's in a bad situation he'd finally look up and say there's a vision I see the king's face I see Jesus amen hallelujah in our deepest trials may God give us the greatest light hallelujah amen greatest Revelations and our deepest trials may we sense his presence how many want to sense his presence praise God give me a vision of Jesus in my hardest moments praise God and he said behold I see the heavens open the son of man sitting on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord right that's the same thing they did to uh John the Baptist they couldn't silence him so they cut off his head here they can't silence him so they just raise their voices they'll do anything to drown out his voice that's what YouTube does that's what uh all these moderators do uh I'm sorry these social networks do they'll cut off Christian voices you lose your platform that's okay that's right that don't make any difference God's word is still being preached praise God you can't stop the word of God it will not return void that's right verse 58 and cast him out of the city and stone him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul what an amazing thing the first church age messenger was a witness of the first Christian martyr and he supported it 100% he was so spiritually blinded think about this he had such an anointing of antichrist on him that he had wanted this Christian to be killed but it wouldn't be a short time where it would switch he would be the one being persecuted I tell you our God is a mighty God hallelujah our god God is a great Redeemer he can take someone who's filled with anger filled with hatred filled with murder and turn them to the softest hardest person hallelujah praise God and then then move them to give their life as a sacrifice for the Gospel of Jesus Christ imagine he said I'll hold your coats go kill them I'll hold your coats you guys go kill him and just watch it and probably he probably Rejoice with the rest of them the whole time he was inside of there was a seed of God not the seed of Satan he wasn't a serpent seed he was a seed of God how many how many know that by God's he was acting like a serpent seed but he wasn't a serpent seed goodness Hallelujah and they stoned Steven calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord they not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep church if we're cognizant of our last hours may we cry with the same voice may we have those same words if we're near death Lord receive my spirit up to heaven amen look at his request do you think there was any doubt in anybody's mind if he was going to go to heaven amongst the Christians no but look how humble he was he's like Lord receive my spirit I want to be with you I'm testifying of you you I I want to spend eternity with you I see a vision of you Lord receive me into heaven hallelujah amen Lord receive us hallelujah amen let our lives be lived in such a way that when we're ready to go we'll see a vision what like like sister Karen Rose mom when they all when she was dying all the kids heard angels singing at right on her deathbed they all looked around and said what where where's the singing coming from and it was Angel singing out in Arizona that's a way to go out praise God remember brother FF Bosworth Fred Bosworth for the last two hours before he died he was shaking hands with invisible people he was crossing over in that other dimension praise God I heard brother Donnie Reagan say the other day he's watched numerous people die and numerous people were the same way they were crossing over they were greeting people before they went over beyond the curtain of time what a testimony praise God Amen what a testimony there is a land Hallelujah that I'm homesick for though I've never seen it before Hallelujah and he kneels down he says lay this not to their charge oh you know why he said that he had to say that because Saul was standing right there and Saul had to be forgiven hallelujah praise God Amen see it comes out of this God will anoint you to pray for people's forgiveness hallelujah amen and it doesn't look like there they deserve it but God will put that upon your heart God will have you speak that word when the word needs spoken when forgiveness is spoken God will speak through you and people can be forgiven Hallelujah that's what Jesus said he said when I give you the keys to bind and loose that's what he was saying Stephen had the key to loose uh loose sa from all those sins and and Stephen through that prayer he hit a multitude of sins Hallelujah let's head to our feet praise God I didn't get to my thought but musicians can come if you like here if you want to you don't have to PR just feel like you're you're you're welcome to if you want to I didn't get to the thought but I want to get I wanted to get to the thought where brother R said if you want the Holy Ghost you got to open yourself up to it in other words you can't resist it amen right he talks about that in Albuquerque 1963 God hiding himself in Simplicity brother said I see you're afraid to tune your turn yourself loose you're scared of something there's something wrong God Don't Make A Promise then go back on it he says it's your death it's your burial it's your exception there's the word he said so help me the holy spirit is here so help me Jesus Christ is here praise God amen amen hallelujah he says friends you got to get away from that starchy Pentecostal way you got to really die you got to really mean it he said you got a partial hunger but not a real hunger you got to make it genuine while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard it he says try closing your eyes and bowing your head think it over is there something wrong Lord take away my unbelief he says he says you have a a conception of what you should do you kind of have an idea he says well now if I stand up and this he says you can sit down it don't make any difference where you're at but where you will open yourself up and then the holy spirit will strike amen hallelujah amen he says then well sometimes it begins to anoint you and you won't just lead on through with it you get a little scared you're afraid you pull back he said Just Surrender yourself re surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit don't be afraid of fanaticism if it's the devil acting don't you think we'll know it that's what I learned over these last this last year preaching on Dancing if it's the devil dancing we'll know it's the devil dancing they'll start someone will start shaking their wrong body part or something like that they'll just go try to glorify themselves but if it's God if it's God encouraging the people to dance that they're just going to glorify God in other words we got nothing to fear praise God amen amen we just got to get unafraid we just got to open ourselves up and let the Holy Spirit lead and guide us praise Goden Hallelujah not in other words don't resist the Holy Spirit he said you just surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit when you feel that glorious he said something warm come over he said that's when you say Lord Jesus I believe you I accept you then something will start taking place mean it from your heart then it takes place isn't that a beautiful quotation there I'm about preach again on that on Sunday we'll see by God's grace let's bow our heads friends we never want to resist the Holy Spirit Hallelujah we want to welcome the holy spirit thank you Jesus if you play that now guys Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me preach a little more direct tonight by God's grace I kind of felt let to go this way we need that church we need sometimes we need harsh messages sometimes we [Music] need less harsh [Music] messages remember church we were admonished by the word of God we

for an extra person or two I want to keep that motivation I want to keep that desire I want to leave here I want to be bold for Jesus how many want to be bold for Jesus let's pray for boldness then also let's pray that we could open ourselves up more but Church listen I have total confidence that when God wants to use a gift God will use it I have total confidence in that the reason I've been praying like this and allowing time for gifts is because I want to I want to expect more gifts I just want to give a chance for more gifts and we'll know if it's God or not cuz we've got the Holy Ghost how many got the Holy Ghost we'll know Hallelujah [Music] you know the Bible tells us about tongue's interpretation every word is judged by TR three Witnesses but really with anything spoken if anybody speaks in the name of the Holy Ghost well then we all those of us who have discernment we can all judge it right or wrong Hallelujah let's pray for boldness let's pray that God can help us to be a Channel of the Holy Spirit that we will not resist the Holy Spirit but we'll open ourselves up to the Holy Spirit and not be afraid I like that what brother Bender Rod said he said some people
