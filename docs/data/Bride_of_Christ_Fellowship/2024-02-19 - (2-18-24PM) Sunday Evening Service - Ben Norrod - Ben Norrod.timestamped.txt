[16:01] guess Genesis CH 3: 4 if you got your
[16:05] Bible just want to say how much we
[16:07] appreciate one more time being here with
[16:09] you thank you so much for all of the
[16:13] hospitality and um we uh we counted a
[16:16] privilege to be gathered here with you
[16:19] and uh certainly appreciate all of the
[16:22] kind fellowship and the nice words and
[16:25] all the prayers and the things you would
[16:27] offer for me and my family and keep us
[16:29] in prayer hold us before the Lord and uh
[16:34] oh I almost forgot to mention brother
[16:36] Jesse so coming up may God willing I'm
[16:39] getting everything prepared the trip I
[16:40] was supposed to take to ugana last year
[16:42] and I didn't get there because of the
[16:43] Visa I'm going to put that back in play
[16:46] for May we're working on May going up
[16:48] there maybe the third week or something
[16:50] around there so pray for us on that trip
[16:52] will you that the Lord hold us and uh
[16:55] you know I put that before you last year
[16:56] but um or even maybe toward the closing
[16:59] of the year before that cuz we're going
[17:00] to go in February I do believe it was I
[17:03] think it was either late January or
[17:05] sometime maybe second week of February I
[17:08] think is when we're supposed to go but
[17:09] they they give me this electronic visa
[17:12] and and I keep hearing from Brethren
[17:13] that they don't accept that when you get
[17:15] over to the border and that's the only
[17:17] thing that I can see that they're doing
[17:19] now so y'all pray that the Lord help me
[17:21] figure it out last thing I want to do is
[17:23] spend 30 hours on a plane get to the
[17:24] border and say go home and don't work so
[17:27] you know you pray for me the Lord helped
[17:29] me do it I I I I I don't want that to
[17:31] happen to me and uh used to be you could
[17:33] go right to the border and buy the Visa
[17:36] right there you know and they let you
[17:37] pay and go right on in but they've got
[17:39] things changed since Co and I'm not sure
[17:41] if it's just a uh thing with our
[17:43] embassies over here or what it is but
[17:45] anyways we'll we'll figure it out the
[17:47] Lord willing all right Genesis chapter 3
[17:50] I'll look at verse four five and six I
[17:52] want to speak to you this evening upon
[17:53] stolen identity stolen identity and um
[17:58] this is the one I was referring to this
[18:00] morning and I've been trying all day
[18:02] long and yesterday to get away from this
[18:04] I thought well Lord I put this together
[18:07] special for the church at home but I
[18:09] keep feeling the Holy Spirit say no you
[18:11] didn't put that together for just home
[18:12] you're going to take it out here and use
[18:14] it on the field so here we are um
[18:18] beginning at verse four now if you're
[18:19] reading with me and the serpent said
[18:21] unto the woman you shall not surely die
[18:24] for God doth know that in the day you
[18:27] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[18:30] opened and you shall be as Gods knowing
[18:33] good and evil and the serpent when he
[18:36] tells her this notice he's working on
[18:38] the eyes the eyes will be wise when the
[18:43] woman saw that the tree was good for
[18:45] food that it was pleasant to the eyes
[18:47] and desired to make one wise a tree
[18:50] it'll make her wise she took of the
[18:52] fruit thereof and then did give to her
[18:55] husband and he ate as well so brother
[18:58] said she live with the serpent that
[18:59] morning produced Cain Live with Adam
[19:02] that evening possibly is the way it
[19:04] might have been and then uh that
[19:06] produced Abel two twins in the same womb
[19:09] two churches in the two Spirits rather
[19:12] in the framework of one Church same type
[19:14] being lived out here but notice the
[19:17] focus was upon the eyes the eyes was the
[19:20] thing now I want to read to you out of
[19:22] blind barus and if you'll just remain
[19:24] standing just one more moment and we're
[19:26] going to pray over the word and uh just
[19:28] just one statement here from Brother
[19:30] brandham your eye is the gate to your
[19:34] soul let's pray together father thank
[19:37] you Lord
[19:38] Jesus what a privilege Lord it is to
[19:40] come back into your house tonight Lord
[19:43] after the wonderful outpouring of your
[19:45] Holy Spirit this morning we are setting
[19:48] on the edge of our seed about what kind
[19:50] of seed you're going to plant in us
[19:51] after the ground all broken up now and
[19:54] our hearts ready for the planting of
[19:56] your word father take this message
[19:59] tonight and Lord you've seen I've
[20:01] struggled and wrestled trying to get
[20:02] away from it Lord because it just seems
[20:04] like a a thing Lord maybe not so much
[20:07] Evangelistic but you just keep
[20:10] compelling me go back to it and bring it
[20:11] and Lord I'm just going to follow you
[20:13] and Obey you tonight because I know you
[20:16] know what's best for all of us just help
[20:18] me I pray Lord to be able to deliver it
[20:20] in the way that you would desire to put
[20:22] it before the people tonight there be
[20:24] anything laying up here Lord that maybe
[20:26] my mind would go certain direction you
[20:28] just steer me right on the path and help
[20:30] me stay right where you want me to stay
[20:31] Lord then open the hearts of your
[20:33] children tonight the visible and the
[20:35] invisible audience the same Lord those
[20:38] that might get the message later and
[20:39] listen to it a different time May the
[20:42] same fresh Holy Spirit fall on each of
[20:44] them Lord just as it'll fall in here
[20:46] tonight and has been falling by thy
[20:49] Grace and we just pray you'll anoint me
[20:51] and the people together that we can
[20:53] receive from Thy word as we commit this
[20:55] to you now in the name of Jesus Christ
[20:57] and all of the needs of the people
[20:59] together in Jesus name and all the
[21:01] saints said amen you may be seated may
[21:04] the Lord bless you we so thank the Lord
[21:06] for all of his great things now if the
[21:10] Lord will help me I'm going to deal uh
[21:13] extensively with um just different
[21:15] things about uh you know there's a lot
[21:17] of young people sitting here tonight and
[21:19] young men and women of course that are
[21:21] sitting here just the same and uh young
[21:24] mothers and things like that and to my
[21:27] opinion this would be be a really really
[21:29] good message to be able to bring to the
[21:31] people of God in the way of
[21:34] understanding and giving understanding
[21:35] about where we're living at in a time of
[21:38] social media and all the little things
[21:40] that go around us and I think this would
[21:42] be a good evening to try to bring forth
[21:44] an understanding about how these affect
[21:46] us and I've got several things up here
[21:50] that's going to sound quite negative
[21:51] against social media but let me just put
[21:54] it this way you know by the help of the
[21:56] lord I can't come up here and say hi how
[21:58] good everything is and blessed and
[21:59] wonderful and you know and then you
[22:01] understand maybe the dangers of it but
[22:03] there aren't positive things and I think
[22:05] of brother Jesse back there tonight and
[22:08] to me he is a positive example of how to
[22:11] use social media properly he uses his
[22:13] YouTube for the witnessing and for the
[22:15] kingdom of God and you know I'm thankful
[22:17] for that brother Jesse and I was
[22:19] thinking on the way up here about what a
[22:21] blessing I spend to many many people and
[22:23] I've heard people mention things and
[22:25] talk and what more and that blessed me
[22:27] to hear that then of course you know if
[22:30] you have any dealings with the ways of
[22:32] the world in this day and age you got to
[22:34] have some kind of connection you know in
[22:36] school to some kind of page or some kind
[22:39] of a thing and then mothers and fathers
[22:42] you know they they get wrapped into this
[22:44] type of world where everything is based
[22:47] upon what's in that cell phone and based
[22:49] on what's in the highspeed area of life
[22:51] and there's a lot of things in there
[22:53] that quite honestly if we're not careful
[22:56] we're going to get caught up and it'll
[22:58] catch away all of our time and steal
[23:00] away all of our time and will even shape
[23:03] us and mold us and form us into the
[23:06] image of what we're looking at remember
[23:08] the Apostle Paul said that if I look
[23:11] into a glass dartling whatever image I'm
[23:14] looking at that's the image that I
[23:16] become and so whenever someone is taken
[23:19] time to look into the uh into you know
[23:22] into the face of their computer the
[23:23] screen of their computer into their
[23:25] phone or whatever it may be there's an
[23:27] image an identity that's being placed
[23:29] before the world and I think that what
[23:32] we're going to find in a little while as
[23:34] we come down to Daniel we're going to
[23:36] find that Satan wants to do everything
[23:39] he can to change the identity of Sons
[23:43] and Daughters of God look when he goes
[23:45] all the way back to the beginning and
[23:46] I'm going to Veer from these notes a
[23:48] little bit because I I keep trying to
[23:49] hang there and the holy spirit's pulling
[23:51] me away and I'm just going to follow
[23:53] that a little bit but I I I I think back
[23:55] to the very beginning amen when when
[23:58] they were first called Christians at
[24:00] Antioch and my thoughts go here that
[24:03] like in the Garden of Eden Eve wasn't
[24:06] even named Eve did you know that her
[24:08] name in the very beginning was Adam she
[24:11] had no identity other than Adam he was
[24:14] her head he was her flesh he was her
[24:17] bone he was everything that she would
[24:20] ever be Amen in feminist form and in
[24:23] name she was exactly the same thing but
[24:26] after the serpent got to her and brought
[24:28] deception to her he began to start a
[24:31] renaming or a reidentifying process when
[24:34] he stood right there in front of her and
[24:36] said but God knows the day you eat
[24:38] thereof will your eyes will be open and
[24:41] that when your eyes are open then you'll
[24:43] be able to see Good and Evil and you'll
[24:45] be able to know right from wrong and
[24:47] things of that nature and see God never
[24:50] intended for Humanity not in his perfect
[24:53] will anyways he never intended for
[24:56] Humanity to make make their own
[24:58] decisions and find their own ways and
[25:00] all of that he simply wanted them to be
[25:04] submissive to the word of God are you
[25:06] with me so far amen and follow what he
[25:09] said amen and then they would be
[25:11] protected behind a word Veil and that
[25:13] word Veil would protect them and shroud
[25:16] them and encase them all of the days
[25:19] that they had breath in their body and
[25:20] all of the time that they would spend in
[25:22] that garden now we know that Satan had
[25:25] to be working on this girl amen maybe
[25:28] for even thousands of years Satan looked
[25:31] for the right process and for the right
[25:33] moments and for the right workings and
[25:35] how everything might fit together no
[25:38] doubt he studied nature extensively to
[25:40] see exactly how nature operated and when
[25:43] he realized that nature was uh working
[25:47] by procreation amen then he begin to
[25:49] think to himself well why don't Adam and
[25:51] Eve bring forth and multiply the same
[25:54] way the squirrels and the dogs and the
[25:56] cats and the monkeys and all the these
[25:57] others bring forth and then it real then
[26:00] he dawned on him out at one point he
[26:02] realized maybe there's a reason why
[26:04] they're not doing it he went back and
[26:06] heard what God said about it you know
[26:08] and I'm just kind of putting this in the
[26:09] way of a drama just to kind of give you
[26:11] an example of it and he went back no
[26:13] doubt in his mind and he said all right
[26:16] God told them to multiply and replenish
[26:19] but he told them not to touch of a
[26:21] certain tree but as I watch this Animal
[26:23] Kingdom out here and I watch these bees
[26:25] buzzing around the flowers there must be
[26:28] something in humanity that is similar to
[26:30] this out here but God said don't you
[26:32] touch that lest you eat of it and you'll
[26:35] find death will strike the moment you do
[26:38] so Satan found a creature we know the
[26:41] serpent was upright like a man and he
[26:43] was as close as he could be in order to
[26:45] mix with the woman's egg in order to
[26:48] bring forth a child he had all of the
[26:50] ability to bring forth just like Adam
[26:53] did but he was handsome brother man said
[26:56] he was 10 feet tall no doubt he was a
[26:58] very good-look thing maybe when Satan
[27:00] moved on him he was a smooth talker you
[27:03] know what I'm talking about amen he knew
[27:05] all the right words to say and knew all
[27:07] the right things to say reminds me some
[27:10] of these last day Slicker preachers that
[27:12] get up here and they know how to Goose
[27:13] the crowd and grease the crowd and get
[27:16] everybody amen shouting and jumping CU
[27:18] they know how to say the right things
[27:20] amen they're not preaching the gospel
[27:22] and sewing word seed but they sure are
[27:24] easing things over telling everybody
[27:26] you're the bride you're the elect you're
[27:28] going in the Rapture not living like the
[27:30] devil you're not going in no Rapture
[27:33] amen you've got to be holy ghost filled
[27:35] saved and Sanctified amen and I believe
[27:38] that only that kind's going in the
[27:40] Rapture amen and the fact of the matter
[27:42] is amen the church just like
[27:46] organization became reidentified the
[27:49] very same way that Eve became
[27:52] reidentified after the fall now remember
[27:55] your eye is the gate to to your soul and
[27:58] she said she beheld the tree by her eye
[28:01] one desired and so forth amen and she
[28:04] took of the fruit thereof and gave to
[28:06] her husband that evening now the Bible
[28:08] said that Adam was not deceived do you
[28:11] believe that's the truth amen why he was
[28:14] directly a descendant from almighty God
[28:16] he came directly from the spoken word of
[28:19] God and she was formed as a byproduct
[28:22] and made and built with a weakness in
[28:24] her that she could fall now we know that
[28:27] God did it on purpose he manifested this
[28:30] thing on purpose so she could fall that
[28:33] the promise of God and all of the things
[28:35] that would happen amen down through the
[28:37] stream of time could happen just like
[28:40] they did and God was savior but nobody
[28:42] was lost in God was healer but nobody
[28:44] was sick in him was Redeemer but nobody
[28:47] was amen separated uh from the
[28:49] Commonwealth of the kingdom of God but
[28:52] through the fall amen through that
[28:54] reidentification of Eve amen sin struck
[28:57] the the world and now all that was in
[28:59] God can be expressed to you and I amen
[29:02] that makes me want to shout hallelujah
[29:03] don't it you amen and think about now
[29:07] how that the eye that's the thing that
[29:09] caught her was her eye same thing caught
[29:12] the children of Israel in the days of
[29:13] Saul when they kept looking around at
[29:15] all of them moabites and all those ites
[29:18] and things around them then great
[29:20] kingdoms with the King amen they had all
[29:22] kinds of wealth and everything in the
[29:23] world they begin to look with their eye
[29:26] and with their eye they begin to see we
[29:28] want to be like the rest of them we want
[29:29] a king just like the rest of them here
[29:32] come that little prophet Samuel amen
[29:34] with that gird laying over his shoulder
[29:36] he said I am your king amen and God Amen
[29:41] was rejected right there and what did
[29:44] the people do they didn't go out there
[29:46] and get that little humble David even
[29:48] though that's what the Horn of oil and
[29:49] the anointing drew the prophet too was
[29:52] that little humble David amen ready
[29:54] hanging around he's a mama's boy you see
[29:58] but what do the people look for they
[30:00] look for the tallest the best looking
[30:02] good to the eye desired to make one wise
[30:05] that's what man's always trying to do
[30:07] he's always trying to look for something
[30:09] bigger and greater please in the name of
[30:12] God please somebody tell me why we as
[30:15] message people in the last day are
[30:17] putting up 1920 and $30 million
[30:19] buildings all over the place amen
[30:21] getting bigger internet programs and
[30:23] getting better this and that and the
[30:25] other amen we're right at the eve of the
[30:27] coming of the lord we shouldn't be
[30:29] working according to the eye we should
[30:32] be working upon upon the need of the
[30:34] people now if someone needed a church
[30:36] like that God bless them may the Lord be
[30:38] with them but my God Amen are we
[30:40] preparing to pack up to get out of here
[30:42] or are we trying to find a home on this
[30:45] planet amen the ages coming to a close
[30:48] very quickly brother Ram uses this in
[30:50] marriage and divorce when he talks about
[30:51] the beauty of women he types the church
[30:54] with the woman and he said when do the
[30:56] women or the church to this day ever get
[30:58] any more beautiful with their big spires
[31:01] on the hill you know and all of the gold
[31:04] and the things that they have now at one
[31:06] time message people in them storefronts
[31:09] and them hokey broken down little
[31:10] country buildings they couldn't brag too
[31:13] much and boast too much about the status
[31:15] but we're 60 years past brother randam
[31:17] friends now these message churches just
[31:20] like the trend of the day they're
[31:21] getting more beautiful all the time amen
[31:23] getting bigger and and more you know
[31:25] more robust and every everybody trying
[31:27] to put out the best looking product amen
[31:31] that's what brother bam called a hybrid
[31:32] situation he said it might be a better
[31:34] looking product but ain't got no life in
[31:36] it amen God give me a storefront any day
[31:39] I'll take an old house meeting or
[31:41] college prayer meeting any day that's
[31:43] got the Holy Ghost in it than some of
[31:45] these great Machines of the last
[31:47] day amen and then God might be working
[31:50] in some of these things I'm not throwing
[31:52] off on them amen but why are we doing
[31:55] such great things the eye Satan once
[31:57] again working upon what we see and the
[32:00] eye and the characteristic of the day
[32:02] amen preachers get up they have to have
[32:04] you know a $400 silk tie on $400
[32:07] alligator shoes amen a $200 alligator
[32:10] belt and a $1,000 suit amen I get my
[32:14] suits from GW Fashions that's Goodwill
[32:16] if you didn't know better amen amen or
[32:20] GM Fashions that's good Mama Fashions
[32:22] amen while I'm at it Hallelujah I don't
[32:24] go out there amen somebody asked me how
[32:26] do you survive as an evangelist nearly
[32:28] 21 years I said I don't go to these
[32:30] great big stores the Brooks Brothers of
[32:32] the world Amen and buy them brand new
[32:34] off the rack amen nothing against that
[32:37] amen but to live like I've got to live I
[32:39] have to make a sacrifice for the kingdom
[32:41] of God Amen I I I try to look
[32:44] approachable and I try to look decent
[32:46] when I come to the kingdom of God Amen
[32:48] before the people of God Amen but what
[32:50] are the people I preached you couldn't
[32:51] care less if I had shoes on much less
[32:54] how expensive they
[32:55] were amen and I I think that's where the
[32:57] kingdom of God needs to come back to
[32:59] back to that side of humility where we
[33:02] just do what God requires us to do amen
[33:05] rather than try to build up some kind of
[33:07] a kingdom remember what Jesus said
[33:09] wherever your heart is that's where your
[33:10] treasure is going to be we invest
[33:13] millions of dollars into programs and
[33:14] everything else amen now listen if
[33:16] you're going to do something he said
[33:18] make a great A1 tape or have a great
[33:20] product if you're going to do it do the
[33:21] very best that you can do amen but some
[33:24] people their best is just Absolut
[33:27] absolutely flamboyant and and almost
[33:29] braggadocious in a lot of ways amen I
[33:32] don't believe God wants us to live that
[33:33] kind of way that's a peing to the eye
[33:36] that's the gate to the eye and then what
[33:38] you see is you see a lot of churches in
[33:40] the message in they start pattering
[33:42] after
[33:43] that and if we ain't careful then men
[33:45] are putting their churches in debt going
[33:48] deeper and deeper in things and trying
[33:49] to get bigger and bigger and bigger and
[33:51] in order to get a bigger Church they got
[33:53] to compromise a little bit every time
[33:54] they do it just to get a few more people
[33:56] in the the chairs amen get a few more
[33:59] Bodies Warm Bodies in the pews amen I
[34:02] would rather amen lay on my stomach
[34:04] drink Branch water and eat soda crackers
[34:06] and serve god with five in a church much
[34:09] less compromise my standards just to get
[34:12] a church full of people amen if some of
[34:15] these guys want a church full why don't
[34:16] they do what brother Carol used to say
[34:18] do he said go out to the street corner
[34:20] lay some empty hands on some empty heads
[34:22] call a few women to preach you'll have a
[34:24] mega church within a month amen every
[34:26] everybody loves a message of love and
[34:28] grace and mercy and long as you don't
[34:30] preach on their lifestyle and tell them
[34:32] how to live amen they love that don't
[34:34] you think so amen but the real bride of
[34:36] Christ wants to be corrected they want
[34:38] to be straight thy rod thy staff they
[34:41] comfort me that's what comforts me is to
[34:43] know I'm right with God Amen to know
[34:46] that his word is leading me in a
[34:47] direction where I can be corrected by
[34:49] his spirits if I got that kind of
[34:52] conscience in me amen I will never be
[34:54] deceived by the eye that's right right
[34:57] and if I'm elected I cannot be deceived
[34:59] you say Amen to that you know that's
[35:01] right amen amen that's right now looking
[35:03] at this uh this direction I want to take
[35:06] about the way that this works for us I I
[35:10] I'm I'm coming from a study here uh uh
[35:13] it's from MIT they did in 2014 and I
[35:17] thought this was incredible they said
[35:19] that people can identify an image as
[35:23] fast as 13
[35:24] milliseconds so in other words before
[35:28] you have an understanding out here in
[35:31] your conscious mind of what you've seen
[35:33] there's a part of your subconscious mind
[35:35] that's already caught what you looked at
[35:38] the minute you see it the minute your
[35:39] eyes behold it whmo it's done lodged in
[35:43] there that's one reason why we got to be
[35:45] careful what we view on the internet and
[35:47] careful what we view on phones and
[35:49] careful what we expose our eyes to and
[35:51] television and movies and all these
[35:53] other kind of things like that because
[35:55] you hear people say well I can control
[35:58] it not according to this you can't
[36:00] according to this your mind and your
[36:02] mind and your spirit catches it way
[36:05] faster on the back side than it does on
[36:07] the front side where you can fully
[36:09] understand and digest what it is you're
[36:10] even looking at because of that amen
[36:13] Satan knows how the human being is made
[36:16] up so he works according to that
[36:19] knowledge if you ever notice in the last
[36:21] day how fast things move amen you you
[36:25] can scroll through Instagram Facebook or
[36:27] some of these things amen every little
[36:28] video is 30 seconds 50 seconds a minute
[36:31] long because they know they know that
[36:34] when you're looking at all of these
[36:35] things like that amen that your mind is
[36:38] catching one image after another after
[36:40] another after another amen and they
[36:42] don't care whether you can unpack it or
[36:44] digest it or not they just want the
[36:46] image implanted in your mind and then as
[36:48] a minister traveling Amen brother Smith
[36:52] how many times I've lost counts of it
[36:54] I've lost count of the times that people
[36:56] have come come to me I'm upset troubled
[36:59] depressed discouraged and I don't even
[37:00] know why and now as I study this I'm
[37:03] coming back to saying all right what is
[37:06] it that you're putting before your eyes
[37:08] that's planting itself in your spirit
[37:10] what is it that's getting inside you
[37:12] that's making you feel the way that
[37:14] you're feeling amen that's why we've got
[37:16] to be careful somebody said I can
[37:18] monitor it not without the Holy Ghost
[37:20] you
[37:21] can't Satan is a lot smarter than you
[37:23] are amen I have a hard time amen being
[37:27] able to understand things when it's
[37:29] being digested have to stop and read it
[37:31] and think about it and study on it amen
[37:34] I I might be an intelligent guy to some
[37:36] some degree but at the same time I still
[37:38] have to work on it to figure out how it
[37:40] all comes together but Satan knows how
[37:43] to plant these things in our human
[37:45] Spirits amen now looking at this in
[37:47] Exodus chapter 20 picking up verse three
[37:51] look at 3 four and five and you'll study
[37:53] right here how that he said in the Ten
[37:56] Commandments Thou shalt have no other
[37:58] gods before me Thou shalt not make unto
[38:01] thee any Graven image or any likeness of
[38:03] anything that is in the heaven above in
[38:05] the earth beneath or that is in the
[38:07] water or under the Earth Thou shalt not
[38:09] bow thyself down to them nor serve them
[38:13] amen and what are we seeing today we're
[38:15] seeing influencers coming across
[38:17] Instagram Facebook Twitter all these
[38:20] different things and what are they they
[38:22] are images being erected before people
[38:25] that are modern day gods and goddesses
[38:28] amen just as Pagan as Greek mythology
[38:31] just as devilish as
[38:33] Catholicism setting before the people's
[38:36] eyes people worshiping worshiping at the
[38:40] feet of some of these
[38:42] influencers worshiping at the feet of
[38:45] who's got the biggest YouTube channel on
[38:47] on the net amen and this is exactly what
[38:50] God told him don't put no other gods
[38:52] before you because God knew as our
[38:55] creator what kind of of person we would
[38:57] be and how we would absorb these things
[38:59] that we looked at in Deuteronomy 4:1 16
[39:03] Moses is referring back to the Ten
[39:05] Commandments and he said letest you
[39:08] corrupt yourselves and make you a Graven
[39:11] image now watch the image now Moses is
[39:14] identifying the image can bring
[39:16] corruption to you why in 13 milliseconds
[39:20] your mind is catching something it's
[39:22] absorbing something and it's actually
[39:25] bringing into your human Spirit
[39:27] Corruption of ideas Doctrine thoughts
[39:31] moldings morale and anything else and
[39:33] morals for that matter it can be
[39:35] corrupting you in a moment of time and
[39:38] you don't even realize it's
[39:39] happening you ever wonder where kids are
[39:41] getting these crazy ideas that they get
[39:43] from today all of the stuff that they
[39:46] get in their mind and you wonder where
[39:47] in the world did they hear stuff like
[39:49] that if parents were smart enough and if
[39:52] men and women were Godly enough to go
[39:54] back and take a look at all the social
[39:56] media they've been exposed to what kind
[39:59] of pages they're following what kind of
[40:01] things that they're getting involved in
[40:03] you'd find out that Satan is sewing into
[40:06] the hearts of this generation things and
[40:08] ideas that are as contrary to the word
[40:11] of God as it could possibly
[40:13] Beall Satan using the eye again using
[40:17] the eye to behold an image notice Let me
[40:20] let me show you how this runs together
[40:22] in the serpent SE brother R said this is
[40:24] 1958 now you imagine in 58 is saying
[40:27] this take some of these old movie actors
[40:29] and get up here married four and five
[40:30] times living with three or four
[40:32] different husbands at the same time and
[40:34] some of these magazines exposing them
[40:36] taking pictures naked and everything and
[40:38] you little girls set that as your
[40:41] example and notice how brother bam is
[40:43] using this to show us the power of
[40:46] imagery and do you know there's a
[40:49] statement they call this the in science
[40:51] and psychology and sociology and things
[40:54] they call this the picture superiority
[40:55] effect
[40:57] that a picture has the ability to not
[40:59] only ingrain within your mind in a
[41:01] moment's time the image that you're
[41:03] looking at but also it what they call
[41:06] dual encoding in other words that
[41:09] picture without a word on it can not
[41:11] only put the image in your mind but it
[41:14] also sends a message that dual encodes
[41:16] itself into your spirit and when you're
[41:18] looking they say a picture is a thousand
[41:20] words when you're looking at a certain
[41:22] image and you see this image setting out
[41:24] yonder whatever thought you would
[41:26] attached to that image it becomes
[41:28] encoded in your
[41:29] hearts oh you say well brother Ben
[41:31] that's not really that important I beg
[41:33] your pardon brother bam talked about
[41:35] these three boys that had uh stayed
[41:38] together in the same room they had a
[41:40] picture of a ship on the sea out there
[41:42] on the on the wall and they looked at
[41:44] this picture every day he said down
[41:46] through time they come to the spot to
[41:48] where every single one of those boys I
[41:50] think it was three of them in a room all
[41:52] three of them became Sailors in a part
[41:53] of the Navy in some way why they have an
[41:56] influence upon us what we see and what
[42:00] we behold has an influence upon what we
[42:03] listen to what we think how we think
[42:05] about things and H how what kind of
[42:07] filter we use to hear certain things and
[42:10] you wonder why that people when they sit
[42:13] in the house of God Amen can't
[42:15] concentrate more than about 30 seconds
[42:17] that's because this ain't no Instagram
[42:19] re and this ain't no Facebook post
[42:22] that's right amen and this ain't no
[42:23] short YouTube video or some of those
[42:25] kind of things things amen and it's
[42:28] training them training them to lose
[42:30] their focus and then you come to church
[42:32] and preach 45 minutes and it's just
[42:33] about kills
[42:35] them and yet they could sit in front of
[42:37] their phone for three straight hours
[42:39] never even get up and go to the bathroom
[42:41] amen why what they're seeing has an
[42:44] influence upon their character it's
[42:47] right reidentifying them amen
[42:50] now in Psalm 101:3 David said I will set
[42:55] a Wicked thing before my
[42:58] eyes let me go on record here and say
[43:01] something whether or not you watch
[43:04] television or don't whether not you
[43:06] watch movies or don't whether not you
[43:07] have Netflix Hulu prime or any of these
[43:10] other things that's up to you I'm not a
[43:12] legalist you make a decision on what
[43:15] things you do when ain't nobody looking
[43:17] you make the decision to watch or listen
[43:19] to whatever you want to watch and
[43:21] whatever you want to listen to but I
[43:23] will say this the holy spirit is not
[43:25] assess pool amen and if you're born
[43:28] again of the Holy Ghost you're not going
[43:30] to be setting a bunch of stuff before
[43:31] you that's going to grieve the
[43:33] Lord that's true and if it is something
[43:36] that Grieves the Lord and you got the
[43:37] Holy Ghost I guarantee you'll do your
[43:39] best to get away from
[43:41] it amen I'm not interested in watching a
[43:44] bunch of shoot them upups and cussing
[43:45] and all that kind of stuff like that I'm
[43:47] not interested in things like that amen
[43:50] and then for all of you book readers
[43:51] sitting in here that would be critical
[43:53] against the television Watchers just be
[43:55] careful what kind of book you're you're
[43:56] getting into cuz you can create the same
[43:57] world up here and you can have the same
[44:00] world going on up here that somebody's
[44:02] watching on a television screen well
[44:05] Hallelujah the word's Amen in case you
[44:06] forgot
[44:07] it that's right now David said no Wicked
[44:11] thing no Wicked thing before my eyes but
[44:14] watch here in a way of a true Prophet
[44:16] brother says again television uncensored
[44:18] picture shows he said dirt filth makes
[44:21] an example look at our young kids today
[44:24] look at our girls little bitty fell
[44:26] coming from school not over six seven or
[44:29] eight years old lighting up a
[44:32] cigarette why is it their mama before
[44:35] them probably done it and if they didn't
[44:37] do it it might have been some of the
[44:38] kids that they're associating with and
[44:40] brother BR says watch who your kids play
[44:43] with right right he says now you know
[44:49] let's say brother Jesse
[44:51] some some Slick Rick come down to your
[44:54] house this evening wanting to be buddies
[44:57] with some of your girls sitting here he
[44:59] had tattoos all over him and he you know
[45:02] and he had a had a pack of cigarettes in
[45:04] his pocket and you know and cussed out
[45:06] of both sides of his mouth I imagine
[45:09] before you had the opportunity to say
[45:11] get out of my house you've done
[45:13] formulated a plan about how this dude
[45:15] ain't never coming around here no more
[45:18] yes sir why would we say such a thing in
[45:21] our mind we think I I don't want
[45:23] somebody like that associating with my
[45:27] children yet when it comes to things
[45:29] like social media they've got
[45:32] 4,689 friends that have all got the same
[45:35] type of attributes about them it's just
[45:38] the difference is they're not exactly in
[45:39] your home physically they come in your
[45:42] home and through a different
[45:43] medium same exact way that television
[45:46] brought these things in why do the
[45:48] churches have the problems that they
[45:50] have today why did they allow the things
[45:53] they go on brother Ram told us the
[45:55] invasion of the United States was
[45:58] Hollywood invaded the United States and
[46:01] ultimately invaded the pull pits he
[46:04] said now people want Hollywood glamour
[46:07] instead of the preaching of the Gospel
[46:09] they want somebody exciting to bring the
[46:11] truth to them they want somebody that
[46:13] can move them and motivate them and like
[46:16] I said this morning they want a TED Talk
[46:18] style of things amen they don't want
[46:20] somebody to just preach the gospel
[46:23] barehanded bare-fisted and just bring it
[46:25] Right Down the Line raw because we're
[46:27] living in a generation of people that
[46:29] get triggered and hurt and offended over
[46:31] everything that
[46:33] moves and how is that Bunch ever going
[46:36] to come to the place to where they'll be
[46:37] Rapture Ready when it's going to take a
[46:40] preacher that will not only cut your
[46:41] hide but strip it Plum from the bones to
[46:44] get you ready for the
[46:46] gospel's for the gospel's finish for
[46:49] Rapture amen triggered people don't do
[46:52] good in church with my kind of
[46:54] preaching amen amen people that get
[46:56] triggered or get their feelings hurt I'm
[46:58] a hard preacher for them to listen to
[47:00] amen because to them I've offended every
[47:03] way of life they've ever
[47:04] had amen but that's the generation we're
[47:07] listening to and watching and and and
[47:09] and seeing on on all of our social media
[47:12] all of the platforms amen and I'm only
[47:14] going to call a few just for the sake of
[47:16] it amen but there's hundreds of
[47:18] platforms out there that people are so
[47:20] absorbed in that they can't even simply
[47:24] allow themselves to separate from that
[47:27] and sit down and read their Bible I'm
[47:30] talking about the book itself amen and
[47:32] read the word of God they're attached to
[47:34] everything in social
[47:36] media everything is electronic these
[47:39] days amen but reading the Bible I've
[47:41] never had a popup a text message a
[47:45] voicemail or nothing reading the Bible
[47:46] I've always read the Bible and it's
[47:48] always just the
[47:49] Bible there's nothing there to click
[47:51] nothing there to swipe nothing there to
[47:53] ex out I can just read the word of God
[47:56] and spend time with the Lord Jesus and I
[47:59] love that don't you in those morning
[48:01] hours when amen all of my youngans are
[48:03] asleep and I get a little time and I
[48:05] flip my Bible open and stop and read for
[48:07] a little while amen that's what I love
[48:09] to get alone with the word and imagine
[48:12] where this little girl got this idea
[48:13] from Brother B says it just in a I'm
[48:16] saying this in a different way the same
[48:17] idea though it was modeled before her
[48:20] said probably some Mammy or some kid
[48:22] they're associating with Now watch how
[48:24] that converts over here to this 21st
[48:26] century to
[48:27] 2024 doing a study on ecigarettes or
[48:31] vaping the youth in 2017 and
[48:35] 2018 had a rise of 78% in high school
[48:40] students with nearly three out of five
[48:42] teens vaping in high
[48:45] school the where the idea they got this
[48:47] from where this come from is that when
[48:50] they conducted a study of social media
[48:53] they found that over 30,000 videos were
[48:56] on YouTube of people vaping the jewel
[48:59] cigarettes juuu L and there was over 100
[49:03] million views recorded and reported of
[49:06] kids vaping some of the they have seven
[49:09] sites on Instagram some on third party
[49:12] and different ones with 2.5 million
[49:15] followers of Just The Vaping cigaretts
[49:18] amen e cgar an you say now why is this
[49:21] important because I'm trying to show you
[49:22] something The Same Spirit that brother
[49:24] bam said was there when they would watch
[49:26] their friends or their mother do it look
[49:28] how much it's multiplied in the last day
[49:31] out here across these platforms like
[49:33] that amen three out of five high school
[49:36] students are vapid they told him in the
[49:38] very beginning that it was harmless that
[49:40] it wasn't as bad as cigaretts and all
[49:42] the science proved that the kids that
[49:44] are vaping it's actually 10 times worse
[49:48] for their body and their lungs than if
[49:50] they were smoking a regular old
[49:51] fashioned cigarette amen and then the
[49:54] kids can go into school School my wife
[49:56] you talk to her sometime with these
[49:57] middle school kids they had to put up
[49:59] machines in the bathroom to catch the
[50:01] smoke cuz they were doing it so often
[50:03] and they can sit in the classroom with
[50:05] their head on the desk like this and
[50:07] they can Vape that Vapor right onto the
[50:09] desk amen and not even get caught pull
[50:11] their hoodie over their head and vape
[50:12] into their hood and right in class and
[50:14] nobody can catch them all that easy amen
[50:17] but what is it it is an age of changing
[50:20] the identity amen no longer are these
[50:22] kids wanting to become engineers or
[50:24] Scholars or scientists every single one
[50:28] of them are wanting to become
[50:29] influencers and find a way to sit in a
[50:32] chair in front of a computer screen and
[50:34] make all kinds of
[50:35] money amen and what it's done is it's
[50:38] rotted the brain of this new generation
[50:42] coming amen they might be smart as a
[50:44] whip about how to be able to split an
[50:46] atam but ain't none of them got hardly
[50:48] any common Horse
[50:49] Sense amen and that's the problem amen
[50:53] is it's causing the mind of the people
[50:56] to become now listen close to become
[51:00] robotic in other words monkey see and
[51:03] monkey do and they're following a trend
[51:06] they're following a pattern as they
[51:08] follow that pattern amen and the Holy
[51:11] Spirit is trying to get the minds and
[51:13] the spirit of the people of this age
[51:15] Amen to look up and to look at the word
[51:17] of God and instead of looking up most of
[51:20] them are sitting there looking
[51:22] down focusing on everything except for
[51:25] the word of God and for what time
[51:27] they're living in brother bam even said
[51:29] it he said when I come to a new year he
[51:32] said I want to know what the hour is and
[51:34] where I'm living and how far up the road
[51:35] I'm at amen he wasn't interested in uh
[51:39] going back and and and and un ringing
[51:41] bells that have already been rung he
[51:43] wanted to know where am I at today in my
[51:45] walk with God he didn't want to be
[51:47] distracted from the things that are out
[51:48] there now many years ago they produced
[51:51] this Theory called the cultivation
[51:53] Theory this is a t test to show the
[51:56] impact of television on
[51:58] viewers the key of this theory was they
[52:02] found that the more time that people
[52:05] spent living in a television world the
[52:07] more likely they were believe they were
[52:09] to believe that what they saw on
[52:11] television was the same thing they saw
[52:13] in
[52:15] reality you know Marilyn Monroe was
[52:17] supposedly the most beautiful woman in
[52:18] the world did you know that she's
[52:21] definitely according to all of the
[52:23] historians the most photograph woman in
[52:25] the world but did you also know that she
[52:28] had cartilage here cheekbone implants
[52:31] there she had augmentations from the top
[52:33] of her head to the sole of her feet to
[52:35] look like she looked it wasn't natural
[52:38] normagene that we first meet you know
[52:41] and the uh the little old bun thing tied
[52:44] up around her hair and some of those
[52:46] early photographs standing out by a
[52:48] fence with a piece of straw on her mouth
[52:50] no this was the super duper modified
[52:53] version of Norma genene the Maryland
[52:55] Monro that we know today and yet all of
[52:57] those enhancements when they would see
[52:59] her on that television somebody bought
[53:02] her those clothes and somebody dressed
[53:04] her and done her makeup and somebody did
[53:06] her hair left her her own devices she
[53:09] may not have looked like that in normal
[53:11] life but they created an image on the
[53:13] television and now every woman wanted to
[53:16] chase that listen to brother bam amen
[53:18] down here in 1963 talking about Tommy
[53:20] Hicks he said and what it was he said
[53:23] there was Sister Hicks seeing those wom
[53:25] out there with them Jacqueline Kennedy
[53:27] Waterhead haircuts and followed that
[53:29] example out there until it pulled him
[53:31] into those worldly systems like that
[53:34] amen imagine what he says here he said
[53:36] it's a matching day this is in future
[53:39] home he said you paint your steps red
[53:40] today and your neighbor can't stand it
[53:42] till he paints his own red why they're
[53:45] always looking for a way to identify
[53:47] themsel with something that they see and
[53:50] television social media all of these
[53:52] things out there are creating an
[53:55] imagery that's influencing people to
[53:58] think in a different manner than what is
[54:01] actual
[54:03] reality you go back and listen at some
[54:05] of these reality
[54:06] stars I done a little digging into the
[54:09] life of this Matthew Perry that just di
[54:11] one of the friends on the friend show
[54:14] you know and and and you know they
[54:17] always advertise these guys their
[54:18] friends their buddies and everything is
[54:20] hunky dory and a bunch of laughs and all
[54:22] that the guy absolutely was a horrible
[54:25] drug addict amen was in and out of rehab
[54:29] so many times it was
[54:31] ridiculous and yet when you would watch
[54:34] maybe perhaps a moment of him on a
[54:36] program and a show and laughing and
[54:38] carrying on as his character you might
[54:41] look at him and think everything is all
[54:42] right but he is a classic example of
[54:45] every movie star and let me say every
[54:47] influencer and every person on social
[54:49] media they only create what you want
[54:52] them to see but behind the scenes their
[54:54] life is a wreck and a
[54:56] mess oh now you say but brother Ben
[54:59] what's that got to do with me none of
[55:00] this influences me I'm not a TV Watcher
[55:02] I don't fool with social media yes but
[55:05] how has that filtrated itself into the
[55:08] church it has infiltrated the church
[55:10] amen because pastors and evangelists and
[55:13] preachers alike and even the
[55:15] congregations amen are beginning to form
[55:17] themsel in an image of everything is
[55:21] okay listen brother it doesn't make
[55:23] great big hits on YouTube and other
[55:25] programs and live streaming amen with
[55:28] the church laying with with amen slobber
[55:30] coming out of their mouth and folks
[55:32] shouting all over the building and on
[55:34] and on Amen what they want to see is
[55:36] somebody with some round Rim glasses and
[55:38] the light reflect off that gesture just
[55:41] perfect and the congregation clap in
[55:43] unison say Amen on
[55:45] time what is it created Hollywood
[55:48] evangelism but it's created a Hollywood
[55:50] church and then the glow of the
[55:52] oldfashioned Gospel is begin to
[55:55] dissipate away from the people that we
[55:57] call Believers of the end time
[55:59] message and it's created such an
[56:02] influence around us until we can't sing
[56:04] songs unless they're absolutely
[56:07] perfect every note has to be Flawless
[56:10] every every vo vocal part has to be
[56:12] exactly perfect or else they won't put
[56:15] you on their podcast or on their
[56:19] whatever amen and yet the Bible said
[56:22] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord amen
[56:25] amen what is it it's a stolen identity
[56:28] taking away the identity of the people
[56:31] of the day and I'm just giving you a few
[56:32] little examples here to show you how it
[56:34] is out there but this same thing has
[56:36] crept into the church and people are
[56:39] beginning to formulate this imagery of
[56:42] what they think the bride of Christ is
[56:44] supposed to look like amen and let me
[56:47] tell you what kind of thing brother bam
[56:49] said it in Christ is a mystery the
[56:51] prophet of God said that one of these
[56:53] days they would close CL the doors of
[56:55] the churches he said like this one
[56:58] talking about his own
[57:00] Tabernacle well I've challenged this at
[57:02] different times what kind of church
[57:04] should brother Bram
[57:06] have certainly wasn't a tape church
[57:08] that's right am there certainly wasn't a
[57:10] church that didn't believe in worship
[57:13] and it certainly wasn't a church that
[57:14] believe didn't believe in the gifts of
[57:15] the spirits that's right and it
[57:17] certainly wasn't a church that didn't
[57:18] believe in Deliverance or salvation or
[57:20] oldfashioned altar calls so where did
[57:23] this imagery come from from Hollywood
[57:26] crept itself into the church taking the
[57:29] family constellation and putting them in
[57:31] a mindset of they'd rather watch We Love
[57:33] Lucy than come to
[57:36] church they have to be
[57:38] entertained remember what Paul said in
[57:40] the last day they would come to the
[57:42] place that be lovers of pleasure more
[57:44] than theyd be lovers of
[57:47] God right and then instead of the
[57:49] preacher you know being some old ugly
[57:52] thing and he doesn't got his hair combed
[57:54] and comes out with old clothes and holes
[57:55] in them he's got to be some Stellar you
[57:59] know the shine and the slick and
[58:02] everything it's got to be just right
[58:04] he's got to be handsome right you know
[58:07] but if he's a little heavy set and not
[58:09] that goodlooking hey well we not so sure
[58:11] about that guy but there's got to be
[58:14] some goodlook thing out there he's got
[58:16] to make an impact so when they stream
[58:18] the television thing they got out there
[58:21] everything looks just like they wanted
[58:23] to everything proper and Prim and that
[58:26] is where the churches come into a place
[58:28] and brother R said they would shut the
[58:29] doors of those kind of churches look at
[58:31] what people are doing today around the
[58:33] ranks of this message you have a
[58:35] grouping of people amen that don't want
[58:37] the nine spiritual gifts in their Church
[58:40] they don't want people crying and
[58:41] weeping their way through to Christ in
[58:43] an oldfashioned altar they don't want
[58:45] prayer lines they don't want nobody B
[58:47] you know uh dying out to themselves and
[58:50] crying and burden over with the things
[58:52] of God they want some nice little church
[58:55] that believes a message and goes home
[58:57] after they do their religion that's
[58:59] right but that's not the kind of church
[59:01] that's going to get shut down that's
[59:02] right and listen friends a lot of people
[59:04] vote with their feet it don't have to be
[59:07] some kind of ecumenical move out here
[59:09] that comes and slaps a sign on that door
[59:10] out there people vote with their feeds
[59:13] they vote with their participation they
[59:15] vote for what they support and if they
[59:17] don't want that kind of church they can
[59:19] shut it down by not supporting it that's
[59:22] right and that's what happens a lot of
[59:25] times they get mad at the preacher
[59:27] because he looks right at them when he
[59:28] say I won't go back to that church they
[59:31] don't have no love
[59:32] there triggered over every little thing
[59:35] feelings hurt over every little thing
[59:37] but they're blending together real life
[59:40] with what they've been exposed to out
[59:41] there in the world families are the same
[59:44] way listen to this brother R was talking
[59:45] about identified Christ he said I was
[59:47] hearing on the radio coming home some
[59:48] great Italian man in Denver was playing
[59:51] a Hopalong Cassidy with a loaded gun he
[59:53] said now instead of that is going to be
[59:55] a Chester the rest of his life cuz he
[59:56] shot his kneecap off he said there you
[59:59] go people trying to find something to
[1:00:02] identify themselves with now let's turn
[1:00:05] to Daniel chapter 1 verse
[1:00:07] 6 let me get to the meat of this right
[1:00:09] here and then let's let's move on with
[1:00:11] the thoughts a little bit amen is this
[1:00:13] all right say amen
[1:00:15] amen now when we look at these things we
[1:00:20] recognize that Satan is not only trying
[1:00:23] to shape this world remember he came to
[1:00:25] Eve through the
[1:00:26] eye everything has to be beautiful and
[1:00:29] fine but let me quote to you what
[1:00:30] brother bam said he said that a tuxedo
[1:00:34] suit with the Holy Ghost can put his arm
[1:00:37] around a pair of overhauls with the Holy
[1:00:39] Ghost and love him and call him
[1:00:42] brother there should be no shame in
[1:00:45] other words economic status shouldn't
[1:00:47] put us in the mind of saying somebody is
[1:00:50] beneath
[1:00:52] us amen that's how how we'll win the
[1:00:55] loss to Jesus Christ friends I wonder
[1:00:58] how many churches around this message
[1:01:00] would really genuinely open their doors
[1:01:03] brother Jesse to the some prostitute
[1:01:05] drunkard drug addict coming into the
[1:01:07] church and sitting down wanting to find
[1:01:09] peace in his soul with
[1:01:11] God how many of them be welcome to that
[1:01:14] they don't want that they've got their
[1:01:16] fine program established with all their
[1:01:18] fine people and all their fine uh
[1:01:20] clothing and cars and everything just
[1:01:22] the way but my God if the woman the well
[1:01:24] showed up and sat on the front row it
[1:01:26] would almost cause heart failure they
[1:01:28] need some of them doctors around there
[1:01:29] to do mouth-to-mouth
[1:01:32] resuscitation but that's the kind of
[1:01:34] crowd that Jesus hung out with listen to
[1:01:37] this while you're getting ready to read
[1:01:38] with me brother BR said Jesus made his
[1:01:41] reputation with
[1:01:44] Sinners that's how he made his
[1:01:46] reputation not by what you see in the
[1:01:48] eye listen this in marriage and divorce
[1:01:50] Judas was handsome he said but Jesus
[1:01:53] didn't look like some some God walking
[1:01:55] along he said he was humble and the
[1:01:58] Bible said we turned away our faces it
[1:02:00] was looking at him amen that's the
[1:02:03] humble of it he talks about the glow of
[1:02:06] the real true gold he said rather than
[1:02:08] the shine and the flashh and the glitz
[1:02:11] of he said pyite or Fool's
[1:02:14] cold that's what the world chases after
[1:02:16] today they chase after all kinds of
[1:02:18] false things I feel sorry for some of
[1:02:21] our young people connected to these
[1:02:23] things like they are
[1:02:25] because everything they see on there
[1:02:28] whether folks realize it or not is
[1:02:30] designed to steal your true
[1:02:34] identity it's designed to take away from
[1:02:37] you every magazine every billboard every
[1:02:40] radio program every television show
[1:02:42] remember Satan is the God of this world
[1:02:45] that is his marketing his advertising
[1:02:48] his broadcasting and his streaming yes
[1:02:51] and every one of those things whether we
[1:02:53] realize it or not is designed to steal
[1:02:56] the identity of true children of god
[1:02:58] let's look at this in Daniel chapter
[1:03:00] 1:6 now among these were or uh verse six
[1:03:04] rather chapter 1 verse 6 now among these
[1:03:05] were the children of Judah Daniel haniah
[1:03:08] Michel and as Azariah unto whom the
[1:03:12] prince of the Unix gave
[1:03:14] names now watch this the first thing he
[1:03:18] did was he reidentified
[1:03:22] them their names represented their
[1:03:25] commitment and their dedication to
[1:03:27] Jehovah
[1:03:29] God every name that was given to these
[1:03:31] children of Israel was placed there as a
[1:03:34] commitment to
[1:03:35] Yahweh but I want you to
[1:03:38] notice to Daniel he calls him
[1:03:41] Bazar aanii shadra Misha mesach Azariah
[1:03:47] abedo this was the reidentifying of
[1:03:51] these men to give them names that
[1:03:53] represent presented a tie to Babylonian
[1:03:57] deities and each one of these
[1:04:00] deities would now be the
[1:04:03] emphasis upon the nature of these
[1:04:06] boys you think about how this
[1:04:09] works you say well there's nothing in a
[1:04:11] name wait a minute now when God came to
[1:04:14] Abram one of the first things he did
[1:04:16] when he was really getting down to the
[1:04:18] time the promise is going to be
[1:04:19] fulfilled he changed his name from Abram
[1:04:22] to Abraham right changed it from s to S
[1:04:25] ey he called change Simon over to Peter
[1:04:29] amen as I said the other night thinking
[1:04:31] about this myself coming up the road
[1:04:33] amen we wouldn't even think about the
[1:04:35] word Jezebel as being a bad name if we
[1:04:37] didn't know the character that was
[1:04:38] attached to that
[1:04:40] name names do have a meaning the last
[1:04:43] day God sent two Messengers one down to
[1:04:46] Sodom and he sent one up here to stay
[1:04:48] with Abraham both of them their last
[1:04:50] name ended an
[1:04:51] HM amen even the beginning of the the
[1:04:54] Pentecostal Church the Pentecostal
[1:04:56] movement one of the first changes over
[1:04:59] was a param
[1:05:01] hm and moving into this hour coming from
[1:05:04] that Methodist time into the lady oan
[1:05:06] age here God sends another ham which
[1:05:09] means father of
[1:05:11] Nations amen and that Billy Graham is
[1:05:14] producing Sons amen that doctrine of
[1:05:17] that ecumenical thing amen and brother
[1:05:19] Branham produced sons of God as well
[1:05:22] through the word sown through the word
[1:05:24] heard but they reidentified him by their
[1:05:27] name part of their training was to
[1:05:29] immerse them in Babylonian culture
[1:05:32] listen to this they changed the food
[1:05:35] they
[1:05:36] ate they changed the the the culture
[1:05:39] that the the the books they read they
[1:05:42] changed the language they
[1:05:45] spoke when when have you ever seen such
[1:05:48] a way people talk
[1:05:50] nowadays I heard this preacher get up
[1:05:53] some time ago and he was reading what
[1:05:55] they call the Gen X no it's not Gen X
[1:05:58] it's gen Z isn't it the Gen I'm Gen X I
[1:06:01] think or somewhere around there anyways
[1:06:04] the Gen Z Bible and they were talking
[1:06:07] about things like you know they just
[1:06:08] read it just the way that some of these
[1:06:10] kids talk about how sus it was
[1:06:15] and and all of these kind of things I
[1:06:18] understand what writers are trying to do
[1:06:20] they're trying to appeal to a certain
[1:06:21] generation but if we're not careful will
[1:06:24] forget that it's programming it's
[1:06:27] training to get them to think in a
[1:06:29] different way amen you say well why does
[1:06:32] our language have to be any certain way
[1:06:34] at all think about when you first was
[1:06:36] introduced to Jesus Christ amen it
[1:06:38] changed the very way you spoke your
[1:06:41] language changed
[1:06:43] altoe that's what he said what happened
[1:06:45] in Mark 16 they'd speak with new
[1:06:47] tongues it changed the way that we
[1:06:49] approached even the way we had
[1:06:51] conversations in the thing we talked
[1:06:53] about but the world today is fashioning
[1:06:56] everything in a manner to train even the
[1:06:58] way we
[1:07:00] speak would you imagine some poor kid
[1:07:03] trying to come up and get right with
[1:07:06] God triggered about everything that
[1:07:08] moved his feelings hurt about everything
[1:07:09] that move he'd have had a hard time
[1:07:11] being that sarap phenician woman
[1:07:12] wouldn't
[1:07:13] he God calling him a dog and telling him
[1:07:16] that he couldn't get nothing because it
[1:07:18] wasn't promised to him amen but God
[1:07:21] gives
[1:07:22] Grit and determination the real saints
[1:07:25] of God you believe that's
[1:07:28] true yes sir they gave them training to
[1:07:32] immerse them in Babylonian
[1:07:35] culture and remember in
[1:07:37] Babylon the very first place that the
[1:07:40] language Chang was in
[1:07:43] Babel and when Nebuchadnezzar sets his
[1:07:45] kingdom up running right through the
[1:07:48] middle of Babylon was a
[1:07:51] stream or we would call it in this this
[1:07:54] day and age
[1:07:56] streaming it's a flood of things that
[1:07:58] come like old Chief said about what dog
[1:08:02] he fed he said whichever one he feeds
[1:08:04] that's what I said you got to be careful
[1:08:06] what comes through your
[1:08:08] feeds amen because these things are
[1:08:11] designed to pervert our minds away from
[1:08:14] the Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ
[1:08:17] remember Paul said I fear that your mind
[1:08:19] would be corrupted from the Simplicity
[1:08:22] that's in Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] amen now let's just look at how this all
[1:08:30] comes together a little bit 2 Timothy
[1:08:33] chapter 3
[1:08:35] 1-5 gives us what brother bam calls him
[1:08:37] the queen of the South a prophecy of
[1:08:40] what he called teenage
[1:08:43] rulership British Invasion The Beatles
[1:08:45] and the bugs and the alligators and the
[1:08:47] crocodiles and all the rest of
[1:08:50] them Elvis was a
[1:08:52] teenager Mr s Great Balls of Fire was a
[1:08:55] teenager Johnny Cash a teenager all of
[1:08:58] them came at the very time that the
[1:09:00] Bible prophesied disobedient to parents
[1:09:03] unruly unthankful
[1:09:06] Unholy Now watch how brother Bram
[1:09:08] identifies this in 1958 get a message
[1:09:11] called lifting them up out of History he
[1:09:13] said to see our teenage boys the men and
[1:09:16] women of Tomorrow teens today hair down
[1:09:19] their neck britches pulled down over
[1:09:22] their hips
[1:09:25] this is in 1958
[1:09:27] y'all with a pistol stuck in their side
[1:09:29] and a cigarette out of the side of their
[1:09:31] mouth what is it slavery of the
[1:09:35] devil and where do they see such a thing
[1:09:38] watching all of the influences around
[1:09:41] them they begin to model themsel after
[1:09:43] what they
[1:09:44] see friends can't you see why it is so
[1:09:47] important to keep the image of this word
[1:09:49] before our eyes all the
[1:09:52] time the SAT name playing games he puts
[1:09:54] that imagery when you're riding down the
[1:09:56] road you can see things everywhere you
[1:09:57] turn around you you could get on the
[1:09:59] phone to read your Bible app and 25
[1:10:01] things will pop up in your face that you
[1:10:03] got to XXXX swipe swipe swipe swipe
[1:10:06] swipe yes sir that's why quite honestly
[1:10:08] it's better if we just stick with this
[1:10:09] old fashion version like
[1:10:11] this amen it be a whole lot easier than
[1:10:13] trying to manage all that other
[1:10:15] stupidity right slavery of the devil he
[1:10:18] said in questions answers the teenage
[1:10:19] kids took over the world he said you
[1:10:21] know the Bible predicts that but here's
[1:10:24] what I love going back into Daniel
[1:10:26] picking up verse eight but Daniel I love
[1:10:29] this this is the Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:31] God right here Daniel purposed in his
[1:10:33] heart amen that he would not defile
[1:10:37] himself with the portion of the king's
[1:10:40] meets he made a decision in his heart I
[1:10:44] will not allow myself to be corrupted by
[1:10:47] the things that I see around me now I'm
[1:10:49] not a legalist if you're going to choose
[1:10:50] to have a cell phone and you're going to
[1:10:52] be connected to social media I'm on I'm
[1:10:54] on Facebook myself and and uh I've had
[1:10:57] YouTube channels I'm not against social
[1:10:59] media but the Holy Ghost is not a Cess
[1:11:01] pool and if you're going to be connected
[1:11:03] to things you've got to purpose in your
[1:11:05] heart I've got my lines my limits and my
[1:11:08] boundaries and I will not be corrupted
[1:11:10] by the things that I see before
[1:11:12] meall praise the
[1:11:15] Lord he purposed in his heart he would
[1:11:18] not be defiled you know the food they
[1:11:20] were feeding I'm more sacrificed to
[1:11:22] Idols you know many of those Foods they
[1:11:24] would feed to the children of Israel
[1:11:26] they wasn't prepared in the kosher style
[1:11:28] they were considered unclean maybe pork
[1:11:30] and other things like that and much of
[1:11:32] that food was already sacrificed to an
[1:11:34] idol and turn around and feed it to the
[1:11:35] children of Israel and you got these
[1:11:37] four right here that said I will not bow
[1:11:40] to the image of Daniel I will not bow to
[1:11:42] the image of anything yes but the rest
[1:11:45] of them
[1:11:47] Israelites just stayed hooked up in the
[1:11:51] Stream every one of them bowed except
[1:11:54] for those
[1:11:56] four and you know the image that was set
[1:11:59] up was the image of
[1:12:01] Daniel oh you say that ain't right hold
[1:12:03] on possessing the enemy's Gates brother
[1:12:05] R said us take him Hebrew children they
[1:12:07] to stood true and wouldn't tolerate
[1:12:09] image
[1:12:10] worship they refus to bow to the image
[1:12:13] of a holy man the image of Daniel he
[1:12:16] says now watch here in Isaiah CH 59: 19
[1:12:20] let me hurry I'm closing he said so they
[1:12:23] they that fear the name of the Lord from
[1:12:24] the West and his glory from the rising
[1:12:26] of the sun when the enemy shall come in
[1:12:29] like a flood or a
[1:12:32] stream the spirit of the Lord shall
[1:12:35] raise up a standard against
[1:12:37] him that tells us that Satan is going to
[1:12:40] come in and flood this world you see he
[1:12:44] copycats everything God does God had his
[1:12:47] delou now Satan's bringing his Del
[1:12:50] Lou and his purpose is to drown the
[1:12:53] saints of God drown them in technology
[1:12:55] drown them in busyness drown them in
[1:12:57] this thing and that
[1:12:59] thing Brother people talk to me about
[1:13:02] well we don't need the Holy Ghost like
[1:13:03] we used to I don't know what what in the
[1:13:05] world they're thinking we need the Lord
[1:13:07] Jesus more now than we've ever needed
[1:13:10] him so all of these things are a part of
[1:13:13] a society a society of people an army
[1:13:17] that Satan is
[1:13:19] building of people that will absolutely
[1:13:21] but be so complete and I'm just going to
[1:13:24] say this as nice as I know how but
[1:13:25] they'll be so completely perverted and
[1:13:29] robotic that all it's going to take is a
[1:13:31] little nudge and all of them will fall
[1:13:34] down and worship the image of the
[1:13:36] Beast taking the mark of the beast to be
[1:13:39] cast into
[1:13:42] tribulation do you
[1:13:44] understand that if you're a message
[1:13:48] person you have enough in You by
[1:13:51] revelation of the spirit that there's no
[1:13:53] way that you're ever going to bow down
[1:13:55] to the pope or any of these other
[1:13:57] things but if Satan can change that
[1:14:00] image and make it brother brandom or a
[1:14:01] pastor or an evangelist or something or
[1:14:04] mommy or daddy or the house or some
[1:14:06] other thing he doesn't care who you bow
[1:14:09] to As Long as You
[1:14:10] bow right and anything you put between
[1:14:13] you and God becomes an idol and God said
[1:14:15] don't set any image up before
[1:14:17] me but you think about all of those
[1:14:19] spirits that came out now listen to this
[1:14:21] in in Feast of the trumpets brother said
[1:14:23] those 2,000,000 Horsemen were bound at
[1:14:26] the river
[1:14:28] Euphrates but in the last day are loosed
[1:14:33] upon the
[1:14:34] bride so in other words the lid of Hell
[1:14:37] itself is being pulled off and dumped
[1:14:40] out upon this
[1:14:42] generation Satan coming in like a flood
[1:14:45] never
[1:14:46] never in 6,000 years of man's history
[1:14:50] has he had access to the mind the spirit
[1:14:52] the heart and in 13 milliseconds he can
[1:14:55] grab somebody's attention never has he
[1:14:58] had that kind of power before yes but
[1:15:01] now he holds everything right here in
[1:15:03] the palm of his hand and he can
[1:15:05] influence people right in the middle of
[1:15:07] the night in their own
[1:15:09] beds can I read you a few figures and
[1:15:12] stats
[1:15:13] here I don't want this to bore you so
[1:15:16] I'm going to try to preach my way
[1:15:17] through it a little bit but 75% of
[1:15:20] American
[1:15:21] teenagers ages 13 to 17 have access to a
[1:15:26] smartphone 75% think of
[1:15:29] that Facebook has 2.8 billion monthly
[1:15:32] active users YouTube has two billion
[1:15:34] logged in every month WhatsApp two
[1:15:37] billion Instagram a billion monthly
[1:15:39] active and Tik Tock over a billion
[1:15:42] monthly
[1:15:43] active so you've got all of these
[1:15:46] billions of people that are connected to
[1:15:49] the
[1:15:51] flood without the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] what do you think's going to
[1:15:55] happen CU remember Satan is forming a
[1:15:58] generation of people into an image of
[1:16:00] something just like Babylon did here and
[1:16:03] renaming what do people do when they get
[1:16:05] on the on the internet first thing they
[1:16:07] do is choose a new name they don't
[1:16:09] always use their original name because
[1:16:11] they're scared of all the mess and and
[1:16:13] things that people can search them out
[1:16:14] and find out who they are so they change
[1:16:17] their name to some other kind of
[1:16:19] thing and then they change their
[1:16:22] identity they filter themselves to look
[1:16:24] a whole lot better than what they really
[1:16:26] look sure and listen the Bible said not
[1:16:29] to make images of animals and things
[1:16:31] like that too look at the generation
[1:16:33] we're living in where kids are acting
[1:16:34] like furries or cats they call them and
[1:16:36] things like that and they'll put these
[1:16:38] images of all these animals and things
[1:16:40] up above them Hey listen being silly and
[1:16:43] having fun as a little kid or something
[1:16:44] that might be one thing but some of
[1:16:46] these people are identifying themsel
[1:16:49] with a trend of society that is designed
[1:16:52] by the devil to take them away from
[1:16:54] Jesus Christ to re-identify
[1:16:57] themselves where the majority of them
[1:16:59] don't have any kind of feeling in their
[1:17:01] own self of their own
[1:17:03] selfworth or their own their own
[1:17:06] insignificance or their own importance
[1:17:07] to the kingdom of
[1:17:09] God listen to these these numbers 44% of
[1:17:13] people on social media will experience
[1:17:16] online harassment or
[1:17:18] abuse 42% of young people report feeling
[1:17:21] sad or depressed after using social
[1:17:23] media for an extended period of time 21%
[1:17:27] of teenagers feel worse about their own
[1:17:28] lives because of what they see on social
[1:17:30] media social media has been linked to
[1:17:32] feelings of loneliness and social
[1:17:34] isolation and a study found that the one
[1:17:37] of the worst social media platforms for
[1:17:39] mental health including anxiety
[1:17:42] depression poor body image Amen in a
[1:17:45] study done that half of 1200 uh 18 to 34
[1:17:49] year olds felt unattractive when they
[1:17:51] looked at their social media feed
[1:17:53] another 60% felt their own achievements
[1:17:55] were inadequate when compared to the
[1:17:57] post of others and I'm going to ask you
[1:17:59] a question you may get that out of
[1:18:01] social media or what you see in school
[1:18:03] or what you see on television or what
[1:18:05] you see out here in this world in a
[1:18:06] restaurant or something like that amen
[1:18:09] but I've never looked into the Bible and
[1:18:11] walked away feeling depressed or anxious
[1:18:13] or low
[1:18:15] selfworth and brother R called this the
[1:18:17] bride's Looking Glass this is what we
[1:18:19] need to be looking
[1:18:20] into focusing on the word of God on Amen
[1:18:24] imagine this the overuse of social media
[1:18:27] has contributed to depression anxiety
[1:18:29] jealousy loneliness isolation self harm
[1:18:33] poor body image Eating Disorders like
[1:18:35] anorexia and disrupted sleep you tell me
[1:18:38] or tell me not is that a flood or ain't
[1:18:40] it yes sir all created right here yes
[1:18:45] sir people scrolling scrolling scrolling
[1:18:48] to their own
[1:18:49] demise according to a journal of
[1:18:51] movement disorders
[1:18:54] in certain a certain time period this
[1:18:56] was about maybe somewhere around
[1:19:00] 2020 they said girls between 20 and
[1:19:03] excuse me 12 and
[1:19:05] 17 they started seeing an A A an uptick
[1:19:09] in the uh disorders tick disorders
[1:19:13] movement now some of these kids were
[1:19:15] proved out later they would just faking
[1:19:17] and acting just to get attention but
[1:19:19] some of them were legitimate disorders
[1:19:21] and they they' done a a bit of research
[1:19:23] to find out why were these girls
[1:19:25] entering into tourettes and all these
[1:19:27] other kind of things like that and it
[1:19:29] said because they were watching Tik Tock
[1:19:31] and YouTube specifically and watching
[1:19:34] people with those disorders and that
[1:19:36] thing came on
[1:19:38] them just like Paul said looking into a
[1:19:41] glass Darkly becoming the image of the
[1:19:43] thing you're looking
[1:19:44] at oh you say ain't that powerful hold
[1:19:47] on when Jacob the little Shyer was
[1:19:50] trying to get a hold of was was laban's
[1:19:52] cows I think
[1:19:53] think he had them pregnated cows look in
[1:19:57] the water at them sticks with the
[1:19:58] stripes on it and that looking in that
[1:20:01] water like that marked that cow on the
[1:20:05] inside you say it don't happen that way
[1:20:07] yes it does brother B said when he was
[1:20:10] talking about he said the rock and roll
[1:20:12] strip teases he said why are you a rock
[1:20:15] and roll strip tease he said because
[1:20:16] your Mammy was a flapper and your
[1:20:18] grandma was a chorus girl you think it
[1:20:21] doesn't Mark that child sin is visited
[1:20:23] from the fourth generation all the way
[1:20:25] down the line yes sir it marks them all
[1:20:28] the way down what they see what
[1:20:30] influences on them brings them to this
[1:20:33] kind of thing they say that social media
[1:20:35] addiction is linked to higher rates of
[1:20:37] anxiety depression and poor Sleep
[1:20:39] Quality of course it is as they stay up
[1:20:41] half the night watching this
[1:20:43] stuff and in the University of
[1:20:45] Birmingham they did a study on girls 13
[1:20:47] to 15 they showed them certain images
[1:20:50] off of social media and these girls kept
[1:20:52] feeling discouraged intimidating
[1:20:55] insecure and they felt 10 times worse
[1:20:58] looking at these unrealistic images they
[1:21:00] put before them and some of the girls
[1:21:03] said it was like those pictures were fat
[1:21:05] shaming them I don't know if you know
[1:21:07] what fat shaming is but of the words
[1:21:09] making them feel like they're fat and
[1:21:10] overweight and ugly and all that kind of
[1:21:12] stuff they were showing them fake
[1:21:13] pictures and these girls just by
[1:21:15] watching these images starting feeling
[1:21:18] lower and lower and lower and lower and
[1:21:21] lower about themselves and yet here's
[1:21:23] brother bam in 1958 saying these
[1:21:26] Hollywood movies and these people out
[1:21:27] there married four and five times and
[1:21:29] the girls taking that thing for their
[1:21:30] example what could this generation have
[1:21:33] been if they would have kicked Hollywood
[1:21:35] out of
[1:21:37] America well I may not be able to kick
[1:21:39] it out of America but I can sure kick it
[1:21:40] out of my life and my home and I can
[1:21:43] take a stand against those kind of
[1:21:46] things therefore my brother sister we
[1:21:49] cannot be dependent upon the inventors
[1:21:52] or the AR
[1:21:53] artificers of these instruments to be
[1:21:55] The Gatekeepers of our home we must be
[1:21:59] The Gatekeepers of our life realizing
[1:22:01] the eye is the gateway to the
[1:22:03] soul that's exactly what's happening the
[1:22:06] world today is what they're calling
[1:22:08] renegotiating the family
[1:22:11] constellation and so nowadays it isn't
[1:22:13] mom and dad but it's Mom who thinks he's
[1:22:15] a dad dad thinks he's a mom or two
[1:22:17] mommies or two daddies or whoever else
[1:22:20] they plan on putting in the middle of
[1:22:21] the family
[1:22:23] and the kids himself have no genuine
[1:22:25] identity of who they're supposed to
[1:22:28] be and Friends listen close how does
[1:22:32] that apply to us in a message if we're
[1:22:33] not careful we do the same exact things
[1:22:36] with the message of the hour we set
[1:22:38] before them an image of what a
[1:22:40] Christian's supposed to be how Christian
[1:22:43] supposed to behave but if we get too
[1:22:46] legalistic interject all of our ideas
[1:22:49] and our thoughts toward things we can
[1:22:51] pervert the image of what a real
[1:22:53] Christian is and take away a person's
[1:22:56] autonomy and their free moral agency and
[1:22:59] force them to be a cookie cutter version
[1:23:01] of a
[1:23:02] Christian and what's left because they
[1:23:05] didn't make the decisions thems because
[1:23:07] they didn't follow along with the
[1:23:09] conviction of the Lord
[1:23:11] themsel they become a robot of the
[1:23:14] church system and that's why a lot of
[1:23:17] them will come and sit down in the pews
[1:23:18] and they hear what's going on counting
[1:23:21] the days and Biden the time that they
[1:23:23] can get out of that mess and go do their
[1:23:24] own thing that's why friends we have to
[1:23:27] keep our eyes squarely focused on the
[1:23:30] word of God Satan is trying to
[1:23:32] re-identify us out the world and also
[1:23:35] right here in the
[1:23:36] church we got to be wise to his
[1:23:39] deceits God bless you thank you for your
[1:23:42] patience I know that was a lot stand
[1:23:44] with me if you will I'm done we're going
[1:23:47] to close right
[1:23:48] there stolen identity we cannot let the
[1:23:51] devil steal our ident identity as
[1:23:54] Believers we can't let Church formal
[1:23:57] take away from us our real identity
[1:24:00] right our identity in Christ is to be
[1:24:02] another book of Acts can you say amen
[1:24:05] amen that's what we're supposed to be
[1:24:07] but friends with all of the outside
[1:24:09] influences coming in all of these things
[1:24:11] crushing down upon us if we're not
[1:24:13] careful we're going to find oursel in a
[1:24:15] spot where we absolutely don't know who
[1:24:19] we are and remember the prophet said
[1:24:22] when the bride knows who she is then the
[1:24:25] Rapture will come and we'll go out of
[1:24:27] here with
[1:24:28] Jesus Satan confuses the world he
[1:24:31] confuses the church he tries to put all
[1:24:33] kinds of things before us why why do you
[1:24:36] think let me say this quickly why do you
[1:24:38] think brother Bram was so hard on women
[1:24:39] like he was because brother Bram had
[1:24:42] enough spiritual discernment to know
[1:24:43] that this age goes out in such gross
[1:24:46] denominationalism he knew that the
[1:24:48] organizations that let in women cut
[1:24:49] their hair and wear pants and makeup and
[1:24:51] the men do any older Godly thing they
[1:24:53] want to do and come right into the
[1:24:55] church and call himself Believers he
[1:24:57] said deacons married two and three times
[1:24:59] pastors married two and three times the
[1:25:01] cigarette breaks after in between the
[1:25:04] church services and on and on and on and
[1:25:05] he said you Pentecostal people following
[1:25:08] right after the same thing so he had to
[1:25:10] make it clear he didn't call women dog
[1:25:13] meat to be mean he called them dog meat
[1:25:15] to make the line of demarcation clear
[1:25:17] enough this is what Holiness is this is
[1:25:20] what unholiness is amen and God had to
[1:25:23] make it that clear so we wouldn't be
[1:25:24] deceived and we would know what's
[1:25:27] truth amen God bless you let's sing
[1:25:29] something Worship the Lord a little bit
[1:25:31] I hope you enjoyed that
[1:25:33] amen I know it was a lot but I hope you
[1:25:36] enjoyed it God bless you anything you
[1:25:39] want to sing
[1:25:51] buddy
[1:26:21] us

[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:21] us
[1:28:22] you know I thought about something too
[1:28:25] you the prophet of God said we would
[1:28:26] come to a time to where the world would
[1:28:28] get so corrupted around us he said the
[1:28:32] squeeze would start pressing upon the
[1:28:34] elect is squeeze and squeeze upon that
[1:28:37] true real bride you know what he said we
[1:28:39] would do we would look
[1:28:42] away Hallelujah Look Away to
[1:28:47] Jesus and Jesus himself said if your eye
[1:28:50] be single your whole body be full of
[1:28:52] light that's right but if your eye be
[1:28:54] dark it'll make the whole body full of
[1:28:56] darkness and how great is that Darkness
[1:28:57] said Jesus right the eye be in the gate
[1:29:00] to the soul I I know some of this didn't
[1:29:02] specifically apply to many of you I I
[1:29:04] know that maybe this is not where you're
[1:29:06] living at it's okay it's okay I don't
[1:29:08] really care whether it is or not but you
[1:29:11] need to be aware of this kind of stuff
[1:29:12] because you don't know how quickly you
[1:29:15] can get in the middle of something and
[1:29:16] not even recognize you're in the middle
[1:29:17] of it that's right and I think it's good
[1:29:20] and time for us to have some good
[1:29:22] oldfashioned church honesty about where
[1:29:25] we're living Hallelujah and these things
[1:29:28] they're real if you got a cell phone in
[1:29:30] your hand don't you dare treat this like
[1:29:33] I I'm I'm immune I can't I'm not a
[1:29:35] Target I can control what I
[1:29:38] do you've already lost the battle right
[1:29:40] there that's right you ought to take
[1:29:42] this thing and lay it before God your
[1:29:44] tablet your computer you lay it before
[1:29:45] God and say God I dedicate this thing to
[1:29:47] the service of God you strengthen me you
[1:29:50] protect me Lord you keep me from
[1:29:52] anything that will take me in a wrong
[1:29:55] direction that's true but in the last
[1:29:58] day the bride is going to look way to
[1:30:00] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah God bless
[1:30:03] you let's sing something
[1:30:05] else I've enjoyed speaking to your
