========================================

I want to apologize to live streamers or people that maybe don't have a home church or they follow you know our ministry you know by the grace of God of course there's other churches I follow their Ministries too and I'm encouraged by them but I apologize I forgot to have someone record uh the weekend Services while I was out um so we had brother Keith Randolph and brother Frank Ward preached for us sorry it wasn't recorded uh but uh the people were in Heavenly places by God's grace and a lot of people wanted a closer walk with the Lord is that right was that the first service was about having a closer walk with the Lord hallelujah so I trust you're enjoying a closer walk with Jesus hallelujah amen tonight by God's grace we' like to preach on proving all things part 20 we looked at part 19 last week on the Elijah this days the Lord Jesus Christ in other words the spirit of Elijah is really the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Spirit uh tonight I'd like to look at proven all things part 20 and we'll look at Vain babblings and endless questions 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse3 and friends you know with the poll if you poll on God's Gift God will speak right to you how many know that by God's grace happen numerous times this weekend so uh we just got to be reminded by the Holy Spirit we just got to stir up our minds by way of remembrance that God wants to meet our needs God cares about us amen hallelujah uh we must draw nigh to God and then God will draw n to us hallelujah we can cast our cares on God because he cares for us amen we'll read verse just three and four and why don't read those together I'll give you a little bit of chance to read There by God's grace you already sang a lot but i' like to hear your voice a little more and hopefully I'll hear a few amens here tonight by God's grace here so chapter chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 let's read that on three 1 2 3 as I besought Thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine neither give heed to fables and endless gen ologies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do praise God may God add his Blessing to ring of's word you may be seated we know God's spirit is here he said wherever two or three gathered there I am in the midst of them Hallelujah we've worshiped God he inhabits the praise of your people how many feel God was in your praise tonight amen God was guiding you into a closer walk God was guiding you into your worship praise God you weren't praising by your own power you're praising by the power of God Amen Hallelujah so we know God's here and uh you know this weekend is another great reminder of that how God is so gracious and merciful to us so we like to look at uh the subtopic proving all things and looking at vain babblings uh a couple weeks ago I was studying on this and I was uh I felt like it was quick and by the Holy Spirit about the number of times if I'm not mistaken it's either five or six times Paul told Timothy to be careful not to spend his time on Vain babblings and endless questions and I was just struck uh by that that was so uh uh that was so inspired to me because the same man said prove all things right the same man that said prove all things in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 hold fast that which is good the same man says avoid vain babblings avoid endless genealogies so we have a balance right right and uh trust by God's grace tonight we'll look at the context of each of these times and uh trust be a blessing to you uh and of course I think you probably know where I'm going you know the final scriptures I'll probably close with right uh that that give us the instruction about uh how to how how to deal with these type of things I like to though go to a few things here if you're here in uh uh the New Testament let's go to acts 17:21 if you have your Bibles there I'm going to put my bookmark there in 1 Timothy we'll be coming back there we'll spend a lot of time here uh in Paul's Epistles 1 Timothy and second Timothy but while we're uh I just want to lay a quick Foundation here acts 17:21 you remember this is Paul in Athens uh 7 act 17 is a beautiful chapter this is the chapter where uh the bereans were more noble than those of thessalonica because everything Paul said they took it back to the Bible and made sure it was right that's your job Church you can't just sit there and Trust well brother Keith said it right or brother Frank or brother Brooks or brother Simon or brother Jesse you've got to go take it back to the word of God yourself that proves you really love God when you want to make sure that you're believing the truth of God's word hallelujah if we're not careful we'll get into a habit of not not taking what was heard we'll forget ex exactly what was preached it'll just go over our heads we'll we'll go to church we'll say Amen everything will look good on the outside but if we're not careful we'll lose our hunger and Zeal for the Lord and then we just start playing Church the Bible calls that uh a guile a pretending we don't want to pretend I'm going to preach on Lev maybe next week by God's grace I preach on that over in uh Iowa was well received we don't want to pretend we want to have real sincere Christianity by God's grace that's the way you'll prove it to God you take what you heard and you'll go back and listen to the brother you know you can't do it this weekend but you go back and listen to Brother Paul's sermon or brother Aaron's sermon or even my sermon go and listen to it again Hallelujah don't forget what you heard praise God you must apply it to your life right or else what's what's the enemy going to do the thing that God gave you during the service the enemy might snatch it out of your mind that's the scripture so you want to be very careful uh now here's here's the trouble though the trouble with the Athenians was that they were spent all their time talking about new things right they always want to hear something new they weren't satisfied unless they had something new right verse uh 21 17:21 for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing and then remember Paul says a few verses later the unknown God is the one that I'm declaring to you you know all about these other gods remember think about that every day was a new thought a new idea a new doctrine a new God right Hindu has over thousands of gods maybe Millions if I'm not mistaken sometimes I get this the religions mixed up of the world you know there's so many false ones uh but you know they so they could have endless days of bringing a new thought a new God that operates like this and that and Paul said you've wasted your time the unknown God is the god that I'm preaching to you Hallelujah and I love what Paul says Paul says he's not far from you in fact he wants you to reach out and try to touch him Hallelujah Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by am you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry how many believe that tonight amen hallelujah remember God and Paul tells him you know this is the one God who's determined your times in verse 26 he determined what time you live he determined the bounds of your habitation he knew you'd live in akan Ohio Hallelujah that why so you would seek God God knew you'd best seek God here in this area and in this time amen 2024 God knew this was the best time for you to seek him him Hallelujah he's not far from each one of us and the Bible said you have to feel after him that's why brother said part of being on fire is reaching out in the spirit that means talking to the spirit talking to God say God move on my behalf God speak to me Spirit move for me amen hallelujah you know I don't like that Ocean song necessarily but a sister sang it at church there in Iowa and I thought that's right Spirit lead me where my trust is Without Borders so see there's a part of that song that's a good good part other parts maybe not so much I'm not going to get into the lyrics of that tonight but you understand what I'm saying you got to reach out in the Holy Spirit God I really need you to move God uh I need your grace I I need I'm looking for you to move God hallelujah I'm reaching out the spirit God I'm trying to go beyond my my human thoughts I'm trying to be I want to be led by the Holy Spirit praise God that's what Paul's saying Reach Out feel after God God is at you God give me a a dream give me a vision give give me a tongue give me interpretation nothing is too hard for God hallelujah amen one of those Brothers came up for prayer this weekend and he said brother I've just been praying that somebody would come in and preach on what you preached and he was crying weeping in tears I mean I've rarely seen a man cry like that rarely and he went like this he said from the beginning he said like this he went from the beginning every single thing you said was me you preach my whole life and I said Glory I said I didn't preach it it was Jesus amen hallelujah praise God and that was a sermon where I couldn't I think that was a sermon where I couldn't sleep I tried to take a little nap you know we're up to like 1:00 a.m. or 2 a.m. every single night you know and traveling and uh the Microsoft system went out you know did you know that your pastor was at the airport when that when that happened had to deal with all the Microsoft failing you know but it didn't set us back too much but you know uh it really messed up our plans but you know God has a way to do things and so I couldn't wrestle all the scriptures the Holy Spirit gave me while I was just trying to nap I just wrote it down and and preached all those and they said that's exactly what they needed to hear so see God's even in the times you can't sleep and you want to sleep right the footsteps of the righteous are what so that means even you're L you're rising up and you're laying down you're laying down you're not able to sleep God's still in that church I got a good reminder of that amen God's even in the times I don't get rest when I like to get rest Hallelujah and then he gave me Grace to pray you know an hour after service for each person pray we prayed for an hour for people coming up that's a real prayer line now our prayer lines are good too don't get me wrong they're all good no matter how the S the the size but I'm saying even though I don't get enough sleep God will give me Grace to get through it Hallelujah God will give you Grace when you feel like you don't have strength just Reach Out And Touch the Lord he'll give you strength hallelujah amen trust God with all your heart and see for in him we live see we're living in Christ amen in him we move in Christ and we have are being it's in Christ hallelujah our the Bible said our lives are HID in Christ amen hallelujah and because it says in verse 29 We're The Offspring of God but Paul was rebuking these people remember some believed some doubted I like that at least some be at least somebody believed Hallelujah at least somebody was blessed that that's all I want to see church when I Minister here I just want to see that somebody's blessed I mean I would hope that at some point you know or maybe maybe there's lots of services where everybody leaves here blessed but I'm hoping at least somebody is blessed Hallelujah because I'm trying to do God a service with it being his will amen not not against his will I'm trying to do his will hallelujah amen but see here this people this Athenians they were such idolators that all they want to do is hear something new but remember God's not in just giving new stuff right God gives you new and old because you forget the old righten that's right hallelujah amen right uh that's according to uh Matthew 13:52 uh want to pull that up there hun you're real fast there it's nice to be back in this Sanctuary too by God's grace hallelujah amen therefore every scribe instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that's a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old amen so see the Athenians were were deceived by Satan Satan was like oh I'll give you a new thought every day but it was taking them the wrong places amen it wasn't guiding them to Christ so see just cuz people have new things all the time that's what the Bible says amen the Bible said ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth praise God think about that these people in these churches mega churches most churches are lost most churches are very few will find the narrow road that leads to life amen think about that they're learning new things brother Austin but it's not getting them any closer to God because they haven't got the old things yet Hallelujah they haven't got the oldfashioned way of repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and the brother told me too he said you preached on repentance he said I've been telling brother Brooks we needed that for months and all I said was there's three levels there's three there's three attributes of repentance first you change your mind see if you say I'm repentant but you don't change your mind about your sin you haven't repented if you still like that you're still making plans to do that you didn't repent you just got caught right right or you just felt bad about it that's called worldly sorrow you got to change your mind then you got to hate your sin the Bible the the Greek says abhor your sin right you have to actually hate the sin and third you got to make amends for it amen go and say to that person I'm sorry I sinned against you amen now you've repented and the church said amen and the the one one brother's in his 70s there he said he's been a stable the church that church has been going on one less year than us I think it was or two I think they passed their 16 or 17 year anniversary we just passed 18 it was interesting there in Lima uh God took me out in 2006 and then God took brother Brooks out either 2007 or 2008 then God took cam out then God took Simon out so God knows what he's doing hallelujah amen so don't forget that friends we need things new and old Peter said remember in second Peter chapter 1 Peter said I'm going to keep bringing these things to remembrance until I die basically I'm going to remind you now here's something that bless the church friends you you and I have to ask God say God add to me Faith add some Faith to my life when was the last time you said God add faith God add virtue God add knowledge and for the brothers that really needed it God give me Temperance over sensual passions add that to my life I need something from God hallelujah and then add patience like I told those young people now you can have patience and wait to marry the right woman right and not go off often do wicked things with these other worldly women and I said now you sisters can wait for the right man cuz now you got patience hallelujah praise God after patience uh uh brotherly kindness I'm sorry no godliness after patience godliness you love your enemies brotherly kindness you love the church remember God won't give you the Holy Ghost until he gives you brotherly kindness so make sure you treat the church the right way right amen right God's not going to give you the Holy Ghost if you're going to mistreat people in the church amen God said the last thing I'm giving you before I seal that that that Tabernacle that pyramid the last thing I'm giving you is brotherly kindness for your brothers and sisters Hallelujah so you can be kind to the family of God hallelujah going off on all these different scriptures not really my notes but I just kind of in preacher mode I've been preaching a lot lately by God's grace amen but see they they Satan tried to deceive them oh here's something new new new they got distracted by all the new they forgot about the truth they forgot about the old things of God and they didn't even recognize the unknown God right there in their presence they didn't even recognize him that's how Jesus is many times Jesus is in a church and he's unrecognized right right they don't see Jesus what's Jesus want what's Jesus trying to do what's Jesus trying to what's Jesus trying to produce he's trying to produce the character of this word in you and I praise God am that's what he's trying to do Hallelujah now if you put this one up here uh Proverbs 264 and 5 yes the Bible says prove all things I believe that yes the Bible says first uh John 4 try every Spirit whether they be of God or not believe not every Spirit don't believe every Spirit try them by the word of God hallelujah 1 Peter 3:15 always have an answer for the hope that you have within you with meekness and in fear right so the Bible tells us prove all things try them have answers ready but then the Bible also says avoid foolish questions and endless genealogies that don't edify people and here's a good one too this is I always like this answer fools but don't answer fools I like how Solomon gives us the balance in other words sometimes you answer a fool sometimes you don't answer fools here's how you know he tells us answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him so see this is the time you don't answer fools when you can tell you're getting in the flesh and you're going to start you know trying to attack them or something like that if you don't have the grace in your heart to be wise and kind don't answer a fool right or if the Holy Spirit tells you they blasphemed don't pray for them don't answer them now that's very rare I think I've ever had that maybe in my life I don't know maybe very few hallelujah amen there's times you don't answer a fool right what the Bible say a fool doesn't believe in God uh yeah a fool says there's no God so atheists well we know there are there could be people that go to church that are fools as well Jesus even called his only disciples like Copus and his friend you're fools slow to believe the word of God so people that don't recognize the message of this hour Hallelujah they could be fools amen some of them could be if they fail to recognize the word for the hour amen that's what Jesus says Jesus tells those c as his friend you don't recognize what God's doing this was spoken by the prophets you should have recognized fools slow of heart to believe everything the prophet said about the Messiah hallelujah amen amen glory now here's how you know when answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit so if a fool is is conceited and you know you by the Holy Spirit you can humble him in a in a wise way go ahead and answer that fool I see all the time on the comments on YouTube all the time in the emails all the time they think they know something like the latest one is Hebrews 1 says uh God has spoken to us in the prophets in Sundry times but now he's spoken to us by his son and people will say oh see there's no prophets brother Jesse that's a foolish thing to say and so I'll answer the fool I'll say did you ever read the book of Acts agabus is a prophet Paul's a prophet Peter's a prophet they all prophesied that's a foolish thing to say Jesus was the last prophet uh read your Bible Hallelujah uh read the book of Revelation 100 AD 70 years after Jesus left a man is still prophesying and the church said amen amen answer Folly lest he be wise in his own he thinks he's so smart I got Hebrews 1 1 and two well it's also written devil amen it's also written Satan right what they trying to they're trying to ultimately attack brother random see but they're wrong but if you got the wisdom of God if you know the answer if you know you can say in a humble way go ahead and say it you'll show them they're conceited they're arrogant and the if they're really sincere they'll admit I'm wrong I've had that one time I had a a tape worshiper maybe I shouldn't say that one time I had a tape worshiper say uh U he was saying we should just play the tapes I said brother brandham said the most important thing of this day is a preacher who can rightly divide the word of Truth he said no he didn't prove it I said in the text he text me right back brother said it in 1957 or 59 he sent me a text uh right back he said I stand to be corrected I said there's a good man right there hallelujah praise God a man who call me out I don't mind being called out I know where I stand Hallelujah I know what the Bible says hallelujah God's revealed to me I studied myself s approved Hallelujah God's word cannot fail Hallelujah brother Ram you got to recognize the Keystone of the Bible brother Austin is Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and prever and brother said see God's word cannot change neither does he change his ways Hallelujah neither does he change his program he'll never change his programs that he established hallelujah amen amen and because we got that Keystone because we got that Cornerstone we cannot be deceived and we can answer fools according to their fol Hallelujah Glory so you know as I was studying this a few weeks ago I just got a fresh understanding we have to have a balance on answering questions amen we don't have to answer every single question Hallelujah sometimes I would put pressure on myself I have to answer every single question no I don't I don't have to it's a balance the same man that said prove all things said avoid them avoid foolish questions so let's prove it by God's grace here's another one too this is for the people that uh for all the people that won't read my books or won't listen to brother random or won't uh listen to the other side uh Proverbs 18113 said he that answers a matter before he hears it it is a Folly and shame unto him that sounds like foolishness to me uhhuh so see it's a fool that says uh that attacks brother Brandon but they won't look at the other side of what brother Ram actually said amen it's a fool that would do that amen the Bible says so and that's why I have very little time for these people because they won't even read my book they won't even uh uh uh study the the things the videos I put out that shows they're not really looking for truth right the noble ones the spiritual nobility the spiritual family of the king of kings and Lord of lords they search the scriptures daily whether those things be so Hallelujah we got to stay in our Bibles friends the truth shall set us free hallelujah hallelujah we must stay in the scriptures that way we won't be deceived Hallelujah Jesus said Beware lest any man deceive you what the Bible say the Bible said these evil men will creep into silly women's house Laden with diverse sins I'm not calling our sisters here silly I'm just saying look what the enemy will go after he'll go after uh we say the weaker vessel just like he went after Eve right so we got to be careful see how the enemy does he tries to keep in creep into people's houses and allow them to enjoy lust give them false teachings about lust church with any sin the Bible said touch not the unclean thing don't even touch it and then I'll receive you sayith the Lord hallelujah amen like I was telling those Brothers don't even touch that website don't even touch that app don't even touch that Hallelujah don't even touch it hallelujah it's unclean Hallelujah so see if people answer matters before they hear it it's a shame and Folly to them foolishness to answer a question without even uh without even without even studying the other side Hallelujah now let's go back to First Timothy 1 I feel like I can now move back there by God's grace 1 Timothy 1 we read three and four notice teach no other Doctrine brother brandom corrected I showed it to you I proved it to you I got a video brother corrected over 110 doctrines of false churches Church you're in a safe place you have been instructed by God's Prophet back to the Bible hallelujah amen you know God's Doctrine you know Paul's Doctrine if you've been listening and studying by God's grace amen we're not following uh fables and tales like the Bible say well look at those we know the real Doctrine we know the instruction of the Bible now we just got to live it church amen amen amen every day God help me to live it amen just a closer walk with the granted Jesus is my plea daily walking close to thee Hallelujah dear Lord let it be Hallelujah we know the doctrine that means we got more responsibility for the word of God glory like some of these brothers have confessed to me they just stopped reading their Bible they stop listen they can't remember the last time they read their Bible the last time they listened to a tape of other random no wonder they're struggling with porn no wonder they're struggling with uh immorality and lying and stealing and and and and money stealing money and no wonder they struggle with that they're not feeding on the things of God hallelujah amen oh it's so important to stay in the word of God notice no other Doctrine there's only one faith I love it Ephesians 4:5 there's one Lord One Faith one baptism and the church said there's one Faith there's one way to believe there's one interpretation to the Bible amen amen not 500 not a th000 some people say there's 90 some thousand denominations there's not 90,000 Faith there's only one Faith Hallelujah did you see the uh Republican National Convention last week they opened it with a republican from California praying to the Hindu god and she called the Hindu god the one true God I said that's blasphemy there's only one God his name is Jesus Christ am sir hallelujah amen right and didn't it brother R tell Saints didn't he tell us that the politics and church are going to unite and the church said am we've been told we've been warned I'll say like this we've also been rescued the great Holy Spirit has rescued us out of the mother harlet and the daughter systems hallelujah amen God rescued us out of the Assemblies of God God rescued us out of the Lutheran church amen God res us rescued us out of the Christian Missionary lives God's in the rescuing business h glory amen is good so Paul said teach no other Doctrine no other instruction verse 14 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister so look you got to look at the question if someone's asking you a question what's what does the answer produce does it produce more questions or does it give you peace in your heart and and the question if the question leads to more questions it's of the devil I'm talking about attacking God's servant go or God's word or God's Doctrine in our case it's mostly attacking brother Brandon but see they stay away from the doctrine because we got a Bible we got a verse for every Doctrine amen I got one church amen I wrote 832 pages on brother's Doctrine I could have went way further I could have wrote 3,000 Pages because it's the Bible hallelujah it's the Bible restored to us amen amen blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear Hallelujah no man can deceive you because brother R point us back to the word of God so God doesn't want us to go to fables God doesn't want us to uh spend our time in Endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edify which is in faith so do so questions that lead to edification edification means stewardship in that in that place so questions should make us better stewards I got a question about tithes and offering see the answer will make you a better Steward of your money right you'll be a better ownership or if you have a question about family or marriage or children that will make you a better Steward of your home Glory Hallelujah but if the question just leads to more questions and you start questioning the word of God is this Bible even inspired well most of the Bibles aren't inspired right because they got the false translations so many false translations did you see this week China's going to put out a new Bible it it's reported they cannot stop the church growing the more they tried to stop it the greater it's grown amen so they're coming out with the new Bible in a few years and they're going to mandate everybody to use it and they gave one example of how they're changing it when Jesus was brought the woman called adultery they changed it and said Jesus said uh let he that's without sin cast the first stone and those Devils changed it to say Jesus picked up the stone and stoned her that's what those demons are doing they're trying to change the Bible I got but I got news for you God protects his word I got news for you the elect cannot be deceived Hallelujah people will die for that Bible people will write out that Bible they might have to go back to the oldfashioned days hallelujah of writing on Scrolls whether they take their phones or take their tablets one thing you can't take you can't take the word of God that's been written on the fleshly tables of their heart hallelujah look at Satan's always trying to do he's always trying to attack the word of God hallelujah am teach some other Doctrine that's demonic power but we got the power of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen amen see be careful these people that just want more questions about brother more questions more questions more questions it's never going to end that's what the devil says the devil will never let it end and I he take them back to the quotes they don't like brother BR said I'm a sinner saved by grace I have no merits of my own to get to heaven I'm not going to go to heaven because I'm Pentecostal I'm going to go to heaven because of Jesus Christ's merits how about that one amen how about we're not saved by works we're Saved By Faith through grace alone Hallelujah and the church book brother it's not Jesus Plus for salvation it's Jesus alone for salvation hallelujah we're saved by the work of Jesus Christ not by our works but by the grace of almighty God glory ah they rarely they rarely comment after that they I rarely get a reply on all these verse five now the end of the Commandment is what here's here's where we're going church the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart God wants you to love in Purity amen and you know if your life isn't pure you know if your life isn't pure you know if there's something you got to take care of something dirty in your life something not cleaned out you know the whole the end game the whole goal of Christianity is you can love people with Purity amen am no agendas no G uh right Nathaniel had no gu Jesus said there's a man with no gu he's don't pretend Hallelujah and of good conscience and of Faith unfeigned or faith unpretending faith in Jesus Christ verse six from which some have swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling vain means usess and uh jangling means Babble or random talk they just uselessly do random talks useless it doesn't get you any closer to God it doesn't edify you it doesn't make you better Steward it just creates more questions about the Servants of God it just creates more questions about the word of God that's a devil Hallelujah Paul told Timothy don't give your time to those things but make sure you edify the people amen answer their questions with the Bible and it should edify them it should make them more pure it should make them love God with Purity in their hearts Hallelujah is this helping anybody see there's people out there they do endless podcasts or endless videos and that's all endless rabbit Trails of false assumptions and fake false accusations this is uh vain babbling personified Hallelujah and and a lot of these people some of them will even allow tattoos they'll they'll allow uh non-binary relationships cussing swearing rock and roll rrap they'll allow all these things they can't even recognize an evil spirit that's because they're anointed by an evil spirit hallelujah amen and all they give their time to is more vain babblings the Bible said don't give any time to it verse seven Desiring to be teachers of the law now these in this context it was Jud Judaism uh false uh legalistic Jews understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm hallelujah amen so these people they're not even preachers and they desire to teach you instead of a vindictive prophet of God and the fivefold ministry that Jesus Christ said would bring us into a Unity of the faith and bring us to a perfect man a mature Christian Hallelujah that's what I love about the message the messenger brother R has made me a true Christian a pure Christian hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah it's brought me to a Unity of the Faith with my brothers and sisters praise God it sh me the true revelation of God's word hallelujah how can I not enjoy this Doctrine it is life the Bible says if you abide in the doctrine you have both the father and son I'm so glad I got the father I'm so glad I got the son I'm so glad I got the Holy Ghost these three are one Hallelujah not three Hallelujah God never said I'm three persons Hallelujah Jesus is the expressed image of the person of God Hebrews 1:3 Hallelujah and remember those trinitarians they didn't even say the Holy Ghost was a person until 385 a 3 I'm sorry 381 ad why did it take them uh 350 years to know the Holy Ghost was Divine why because they didn't have the Holy Ghost that's why amen but if you got the Holy Ghost you know the Holy Ghost is God Amen and the church said amen hallelujah they didn't know for 350 years praise God oh my you know a lot of give a lot of people give TD Jak a hard time and they should but there's one thing that he's right on I don't I believe he's a false prophet or false preacher whatever but he's one thing he's right on he said he believes God's not three persons good for him now bad for all the other things with the you've heard about maybe some of the news about him really bad stuff I'll give him credit for that one thing he stood against what trinitarians have said he said I'm not a trinitarian he said I'm Pauline in other words I get my definition of the godhead from St Paul and that's really a m drop moment right now of course he lives in prob he probably lives in sin and does awful things but I'm just saying that's one that's one person that that has one good thing hallelujah our our our faith isn't built upon the Creeds of man our faith is written upon the word of God that the Holy Ghost inspired holy men to write hallelujah amen and the holy word never calls God three persons or second person oh uh Paul never said oh thank you second person for dying for my sins Paul never said that he said oh thank you first person for uh creating heavens and earth or thank you third person uh for coming into my soul Paul never said that Hallelujah and John said if you got the right doctrine that proves you got both father and son he never even mentioned the Holy Ghost that's because God is the Holy Ghost the father is the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh you thinking de deep in heart anybody thinking deep in heart here tonight okay go to chapter four amen 1 Timothy 4: 6 here's the second passage where he says don't give your time to these things well that must mean brother Jess uh sisters that must mean your time is very precious is that true yes don't give your time to foolishness endless questions endless genealogy fables like that one the Fable that uh brother Rand is somehow responsible for Jim Jones just because Jim Jones at one time was a a Pentecostal that's an absolute Fable from hell I I did videos on it proven it beyond a shadow of a doubt that's a fable I don't give my time to fables now I did the one time to show how it was wrong and anybody that wants to be free from that Fable they can be free from that Fable amen and God can turn them to the truth of God's word hallelujah amen I think it was I'm not mistaken nine times in that sermon brother Austin the Holy Spirit told Brother Ram or the Holy Spirit had brother Ram speak to the pastors and warned the people and the pastors and Jim Jones is sitting right there remember he's responsible for over 900 deaths nine times brother called out you Pastors make sure you don't give this he was talking about a bobbed hair makeup and all these things and Jim Jones allowed that and then by the end he didn't even he said he was God he said he was God and he said prophesied of brother Ram's death that's a lie too there's nothing on tape there's nothing foretold about that either see fables we think a a Cinderella no that's it's attacks against God's servants that's the fables hallelujah amen but we don't do preach fables here we preach nothing but the Holy Ghost truth hallelujah amen verse six if thou put brethren in remembrance of these things see put the preachers in remembrance that then Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourish up in the words of faith and good doctrin again Doctrine where unto thou Hast attained so you have to attain to good faith you have to press in so you have good enough Faith you have to press in and believe God until you've got good Doctrine verse 7even but refuse profane and old wise fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness see all these fables like brother R was in cahoots with the KKK or Roy Davis and all this Jim Jones nonsense those are endless fables those are attacks those are old wise fables those are profane fables Hallelujah verse now go down to verse 16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee Oh My a preacher that's preaching the truth from the Holy Ghost will save his Doctrine will save because it's not his Doctrine it's God's Doctrine Hallelujah it's God's instruction on how to get saved hallelujah oh that makes me happy Hallelujah to know that God has given us the right Doctrine the one Doctrine no other Doctrine it's the doctrine of the Apostles it's what Paul preached and we're resting on that just like the Believers are behind the curtain of time hallelujah we're resting on this Hallelujah Glory go to First Timothy 620 this is the third passage oh Timothy keep that which is committed to thy Trust see something the word of God the message has been committed to me God is trusting me with it I got to be faithful with it avoiding profane and Vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so-called we got a bunch of false science out there hallelujah oh there's no such thing as God or Evolution and all this nonsense show me one uh creature that's in the process of evolving right now in fact brother Ram did say one time he made a joke hopefully I can remember this I don't chop it up too much brother talking about all these women taking off their clothes and brother said now they say we're coming from monkeys he said I don't believe that but it sure looks like these women undressing it looks like they they're going back to monkeys he said I can find that quote if you want I thought that was good brother Bram I think I actually said amen when I heard him say that I started laughing he said you're kind of convincing me you didn't come from monkeys cuz you're taking off your clothes cuz monkeys don't wear clothes Hallelujah glory amen thank you brother ROM hallelujah thank you for preaching God's word Glory see it's avoid profane babblings useless random talk no focus on Doctrine no focus on the word of God and babbling is fruitless discussions there's no really fruit to it what how does someone get closer to God this way and look at verse 21 which some professing have ered concerning the faith see they're professing Christianity but they're they're giving all these false science right I heard a preacher a famous preacher his name is Andy Stanley boy he's going off the rails this guy's really falling away from God excepting homosexuality all these things but he said Evolution doesn't contradict the word of God I'm sorry you need to go see Answers in Genesis and get some real Answers by God's grace Hallelujah totally contradicts the word of God but see avoid it avoid it I thought Paul didn't you say we're supposed to approve all things yes we are when they're sincere questions when someone really wants to know amen and they want to be a better Steward of a Christian Life am not when they just want to debate until they can uh make you feel like you're wrong no the word of God Is Right Hallelujah Church you know you can sense it can't you how many got the discernment of the Holy Ghost you can just sense when people really have good questions we had a brother who was with us for a while then left us and when I was talking to him and texting with him I could tell he was he was going that way there there was never going to be an end to these questions there was never going to be an end of well maybe you're wrong on tithes and offerings maybe you're wrong on the godhead maybe you're wrong on this maybe wrong on that there's never going to be an end see what does that that make that makes him the pastor then that makes him my leader then I got to submit to him and do what he says no sir I'm led by the Holy Spirit I was called by the Holy Spirit I was commissioned by the Holy Spirit and I'm under the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen Ah that's the third passage avoid profane vain babblings see it's a Heir when they go into all these unending questions and all these fables about brother random or even the Bible they're aing from the faith go to 2 Timothy 2:15 this is the fourth passage and hopefully I can hopefully the Hol not me hopefully the Holy Spirit can convince you it's very important how you spend your time it's very important how you accept or decline questions Hallelujah study to show thyself approved unto God he's talking to a p or I'm sorry preacher I I don't think maybe Timothy was a pastor I have to go look that up because he he tell he tells him later do the work of evangelist I don't think he's a pastor yet I don't think Timothy was the pastor yet because he's telling him to do evangelism a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth see you got to you got to cut the word that that right divide means a cut you got to cut straight you got to cut this truth straight you can't can't do a jagged cut it's got to be straight people got to understand they got to know what's right and wrong Hallelujah you got to cut it right you can't let cut a little piece and say well it's okay to be a homosexual it's okay to be an adulter oh you can no you can't you better cut it straight Hallelujah talk about straight amen hallelujah you better cut it straight Hallelujah I didn't a plan to say that verse 16 but shallan not here now he before he said prove all things now he said shun them shun them shun profane and vain babblings when they start doing profane attacks against God's word or God's people shun them for they will increase under more ungodliness this is what I brought up I brought up many times I listed all those sins and I'm just saying sins of certain people that leave the message not all that leave the message but some they'll cut their hair they'll well makeup they'll wear pants they'll wear shorts they'll watch filthy movies uh they get into the lgbq lifestyle they they approve of rock and roll rap and and Halloween and Dracula and dirty movies I see their lives are either getting more holy or more or less holy Our Lives ought to be getting more holy Hallelujah am God said be holy church for I'm holy Hallelujah live a sacred separated life live a holy life because God is separate from sin Hallelujah that's how I know these people asking questions if their lives get more worldly now some of them I'm not going to name their names but some of them all they do is attack brother Braham they don't say exactly what they believe and there's a reason they do that because if they actually said what they believed I'd call them out on it I would because I already do Hallelujah I called out others see they don't tell you what they believe they just attack brother Brandon they just attack the Bible but God knows church God knows God knows who's hungry and thirsting after righteousness they shall be filled and what happens in verse 17 their word eats as a canker that's a flesh eating disease see it slowly rots away their life that's why that Lev sermon is very similar just slowly rots away the leaven slowly permeates the hole and they say in verse 18 oh the raptures already happened you know I got a good sermon coming up on the Rapture did you know tuck Tucker Carlson just attacked the scoffield Bible did you know know that I just heard it today brother Austin so I got my Scofield bible right here brother Tucker maybe he'll see this online and he'll want to talk to me maybe I could be a a interview person on his show here's my new guest he's a no-name pastor from Ohio attacking the scoffield Bible I thought bro I bro I was like I about ready to throw down there that's all I've had is a Scofield bible and church you know what they're attacking that's ties into this they're attacking the pre-tribulation Rapture and I've been attacked so much on that recently brother Austin so you know see see see what God is doing whenever Satan when when the enemy whenever the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard come R around here I'm going to prove it by the Bible God's Prophet said it was pre-tribulation the B says it's pre-tribulation Hallelujah so now I know why I got to go preach and it also lines up with those sermons and that song I Just Want to Thank You Lord um uh it this the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery that's my next one after the the spirit of Grace I know it's right on time God is always right on time how many you believe that Amen brother Tucker I love verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of God stand ass sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his God knows his children I love this let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity see a lot of these people won't they won't say what they believe that after they the message because they know they're getting into more iniquity and they know they'll be called out right so they won't say it now some of them will some of just get on there like I told you they'll name off every single thing they do all the things they want to do it's sad but it's fulfilling the scripture and they're the ones spending their time on profane and Vain babblings and they increase unto more godliness may we see in our lives that our lives are getting more holy praise God not less holy May Our Lives get more holy praise God what do you need to cut out of your life what can you sacrifice out of your life that will draw you closer to Christ that's a good question isn't it oh no wonder the pastor preaches on sanctification all the time see because you're either increasing one way or the other church right but said you can't leave this service the same way you came right you either be more determined to to hear the word obey the word pray or less determined your choice God help us to make the right choice 2 Timothy Chapter 4: 2 2 Timothy 4:2 this is the fifth and final passage amazing this was amazing me brother I'm just using you because you're a man and I I know you don't mind if I call your name you know I don't want to call our dear sisters you know they're so tender and sweet and timid out of Godly respects also out of privacy too you know I I don't want to say too much but look five times the prophet of God Paul tells Timothy don't give time to these things shun them avoid them don't give yourself to these old wise fables old wives tales fables Hallelujah make sure the questions are going to lead to stewardship more faithful Christianity everybody got me I'm got the word not me second Timothy 4:2 preach the word be instant in season out of season boy this is a season a lot of preaching for me Hallelujah reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine see you have to be all longsuffering just keep suffering just keep suffering Paul tell Timothy suffer with the people just be longsuffering give them time to come into the grace of God Amen cuz we all need time to come into God's grace I need time amen we all need time to come into the fullness of our maturity as Christians and give all Doctrine to the people that's all I preach you know we like we had a with two 4our services and all I preach was Doctrine I hardly gave any testimonies I mean I gave some but I preached Doctrine I instructed them on how to live above sin I instructed them on how to have treasure in their homes I focused a lot on overcoming pornography and all said was instruct them on this and this and that and it produced all this all this response they're all available on YouTube if you want to watch it by God's grace see doctr will produce a Revival in fact that's the only thing that will produce Revival it's repentance Hallelujah for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine people won't hear the Lord Jesus Christ baptism they won't they won't even hear three works of Grace but said that's my message the the three works of Grace justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's my message but after their own lust look a lust again here's the fifth time Paul's saying lust these people that have all these endless questions they have lust of the flesh they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they're saying just tell me what I want to hear itch my ears make me feel good when I come to church it is not my job to make you feel good sometimes I will but sometimes I won't amen amen I'm not here to tickle your ears I want to preach the promises of God and that ought to make it joyful Hallelujah sometimes you got to lay down truth lay down things that might hurt but it's not me it's the word of God it's God uh bringing a cut that he might after he cuts with the sword he might bring in the balm for healing praise God the oil of healing God Cuts you so that he can heal you by God's grace cut out PR out areas of your life this shouldn't be in your life and yes it hurts but then God puts the oil of the holy spirit for healing verse four and they shall turn their ears away from the truth see they don't want to hear the message they want they don't want to hear the truth and should be turned unto fables like I said fables that God Saves everybody whether you're Hindu or Catholic or no matter what you are God Saves people by Grace Hallelujah through the blood of Jesus Christ brother R said a Catholic is saved if he's trusting in the blood of Jesus Christen not the prayer beads Hallelujah if you're trusting in the prayer beads you're lost if you're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ you're saved hallelujah amen but watch thou in all things you have to watch all your life endure afflictions do the work of evangelist make full proof of your ministry I'm constantly trying to prove I've got a a Ministry with sound Doctrine that's my whole job is to prove I'm giving all of you the trth true doctrine of our Lord and savior the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but what do we have today we have accusers of the Brethren like uh uh Revelation 12 says the Bible said the accuser of the Brethren is cast down right speaking of Satan and people Anointed with evil spirits they accuse the Brethren the true Christians they accuse them online or face to face or over letters or email somehow some people do it not everybody but some people do it see and it's just like the Pharisees and the herodians mark 12:13 and they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and the herodians to catch him in his words see that that's what these evil spirited people they're trying to catch the True Believers and try to find some mistake and then accuse them and go make them go down these endless questions well if you're wrong there what about this if you made a mistake there what about that hey enough to say I'm sorry forgive me now let's move on praise God I'm sorry I I'll I'll say I'm sorry I'll repent my mistake and have Grace on somebody but no it's one more thing one more thing one more thing hallelujah amen they did it to Daniel in Daniel chapter 6 verse4 The Presidents and the princes sought to find out occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any Heir or fault found in him so the presence of the princess they're just watching Daniel just to find something wrong look at that they got their eyes off God they got their their eyes on a man trying to watch a man to accuse him get your Eyes On Christ the Bible said look you know to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith Hallelujah that was Michael's problem remember Michael's problem she was looking at David she should not have been looking at David she should have been looking at the ark Hallelujah we've got the ark we've got the word Christ is in our midst we get our eyes off of people get our eyes on Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah remember Proverbs 17:20 this tells you what a critical spirit is you only find negative things about people he that had the forward part findeth no good they can't find they can't say anything good about you Hallelujah and he that had the perverse tongue fall into Mischief they get into things they shouldn't deal with Mischief right sinful things they get into because they don't have the right anointing of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah remember this good old good old verse here uh 2 Chronicles 36 verse 15 16 the Lord God of their father sent to them by his Messengers rising up be times and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his Dwelling Place I said this last week God sent brother Ram to our God sent brother's message to me and my wife so because God had compassion on us and he wanted to bring us out of all the man-made Creeds that the churches we are raised in all the fables I was believing right everybody goes to heaven and all these things hell lasts eternally all these fables I was believing God had to call me out of that I'm so glad he did am that was God that was God's compassion on us hallelujah praise God he would have let us believe like I talked to these friends that used to go to the chapel and they sit there and told me in the car I don't know if I pray to the father or the son or the Holy Ghost and they've been in the church for 40 years they didn't know who to pray to I'm glad that we know who to pray to praise God we pray to God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen you can say dear God you can say dear Jesus you can say dear holy spirit because it's one person Hallelujah I'm glad God called us out of fables amen and called us to this Marvelous Light the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen the glory of the knowledge of our Lord and savior knowledge is understanding we understand the true Gospel of Jesus Christ but what did many people do verse 16 they mock The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets that's what they do today they mock brother brandom he'll make a mistake there mock him he'll say something wrong there the mock him they despise his words his Bible preaching and they misuse His prophets which is they misquote him they splice his quotes and make him say something he doesn't say just like last week when we looked at that the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ they splice that and make it say brother R's calling himself the Lord Jesus Christ no he wasn't go listen to the whole thing he was saying the spirit of God on the prophet is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ spirit amen hallelujah amen they misuse God's prophets aren't you glad that the holy spirit is here hallelujah and the Holy Spirit is guiding us into all truth and we can be blessed because God had compassion on us and called us out of dead denominational systems praise God Amen aren't you glad can somebody say amen hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God Amen called us out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light amen I know what I was talking about I was in darkness but he's called me out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light amen God bless the live streamers I'm going to stop right here I'm going to finish with some testimonies God bless you live streamers appreciate you in the name of the Lord
