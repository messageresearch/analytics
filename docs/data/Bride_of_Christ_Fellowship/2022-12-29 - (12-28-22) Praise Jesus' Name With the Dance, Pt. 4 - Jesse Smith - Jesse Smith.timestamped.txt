[0:00] I'd like to continue to minister on
[0:01] praise Jesus's name and the dance here
[0:03] tonight I'd like to
[0:05] go a little bit further as I told you
[0:07] last Wednesday I didn't get the chance
[0:08] to finish all the the texts on Dancing
[0:12] so I like to
[0:13] continue on that we'll just see where
[0:15] the Lord
[0:17] directs us here tonight by his grace
[0:27] as you turning there to Psalms 149 verse
[0:30] 3
[0:32] uh just want to remind you the schedule
[0:34] you know Lord willing Saturday night
[0:35] we'll try to keep it a short two-hour
[0:37] service I'll really try to do that
[0:39] because we have two services on Sunday
[0:41] I want to get back to the two services
[0:43] on Sunday you know we kind of we lost
[0:45] that service last you know Friday
[0:47] because of the weather and so I kind of
[0:48] want to get back to that by God's grace
[0:50] and
[0:51] um and I'd like to say this for Saturday
[0:53] if you can let's make it a song and
[0:55] testimony service
[0:57] on Saturday night it's our New Year's
[0:59] Eve service so bring a testimony
[1:02] might be interesting too if you go back

[1:06] testimonies New Year service and kind of
[1:08] see what you said or see what we sang
[1:10] and
[1:11] just kind of reflect on the year I've
[1:13] been doing that I've been I've been
[1:15] making a list of all the testimonies
[1:16] from each month you know I don't have a
[1:17] testimony for every month but I've got
[1:19] like eight or nine testimonies from this
[1:21] year and I think I'll share some of
[1:22] those you know just remind us of some of
[1:24] the testimonies
[1:25] God's done and uh
[1:29] and you know we didn't get to do our
[1:30] dance service really on Christmas
[1:31] because it was just a strange day you
[1:33] know it's been a strange
[1:35] strange moment but we're willing maybe
[1:38] we could do that Saturday too by God's
[1:39] grace
[1:40] and just so you know brother Simon will
[1:41] be coming January 15th he'll preach both
[1:43] services for us
[1:45] I'm going to reschedule with brother
[1:46] Matt Leitner by God's grace but we have
[1:48] brother Simon coming January 15th
[1:51] and I believe that's it I asked brother
[1:55] Brian Hawkins to come in March again so
[1:57] he hasn't got back to me but I asked
[1:58] brother and Brian to come and March
[2:01] so that's the update there on the events
[2:04] by God's grace
[2:05] okay so let's go to our text here we'll
[2:08] go to Psalm 149 verse 3.

[2:24] sing praises unto him with the timbrel
[2:27] and heart may God bless his word tonight
[2:29] you may be seated praise God
[2:33] so I have some quotes I'd like to share
[2:35] and
[2:36] um
[2:38] you know we'll just kind of see how it's
[2:40] seven o'clock okay so I'll try to preach
[2:42] an hour we'll kind of see how that goes
[2:47] sure brother yeah yeah
[2:49] um let's see uh but amen we didn't crack
[2:52] that window there buddy by God's grace
[2:53] so you got to pull up the blind there
[2:55] yes I
[2:56] and then there's a lock
[2:58] on the right side the window so there's
[3:00] you got to unlock it yeah um
[3:02] I'll do it thank you
[3:05] yes sir
[3:06] so we're looking at part four here and
[3:08] we'll kind of pick up where we left off
[3:10] last Wednesday you know I've gotten
[3:11] numerous emails and um
[3:14] you know comments on YouTube how this
[3:16] this Series has been a blessing to
[3:18] people you know some people have said it
[3:20] the series has helped renew their
[3:21] worship with the Lord
[3:23] and so hopefully it's helped you as well
[3:25] by God's grace I know it's brought a lot
[3:26] of Liberty and freedom to me and you
[3:28] know to see the children dance and all
[3:29] of us dance together I know it's been a
[3:31] real blessing for me
[3:32] uh and I know there's a time and season
[3:35] for everything praise God so just
[3:37] rejoice in that and
[3:39] um
[3:40] so I'm very thankful for what God is
[3:42] doing praise God oh yeah and I had
[3:43] Brother Ray come up uh last Wednesday
[3:45] night after everybody left you know he
[3:47] stayed tell me some testimonies he left
[3:49] and then he come back and he said he
[3:51] just said the Holy Spirit told me
[3:52] brother Jesse to come tell you you're
[3:54] preaching exactly what he wants
[3:57] he said because these children get to
[3:59] rejoice in the presence of the Lord he
[4:01] said I just want to tell you he said I
[4:02] was in my car and the voice of the Lord
[4:03] said go tell brother Jesse he's
[4:05] preaching the right thing so I said well
[4:06] thank you I felt like that but it's nice
[4:08] to have a confirmation
[4:11] uh he said the children he said the
[4:14] children need to learn how to praise the
[4:15] Lord and uh
[4:18] and he said just as a second testimony
[4:21] with the voice he said he heard
[4:23] he said he was just talking to somebody
[4:26] of that I think the Sunday before
[4:28] about the freedom to worship and the
[4:31] dancing and the shouting and the
[4:33] praising of God
[4:34] and I said well praise God that's just
[4:36] another confirmation to me praise God
[4:38] the Bible says you study and I always
[4:40] point to the study room you know the
[4:41] Bible says you study yourself approved
[4:43] unto God so you've got to study long
[4:45] enough until you feel like God has given
[4:47] you that message
[4:48] right and then you go preach to the
[4:50] people like I was talking about amen
[4:51] last week you know
[4:52] there's some Services that's just hard
[4:54] they start out hard but then you get
[4:55] right into the prince of the Lord you
[4:56] know but you just got to push through as
[4:58] a minister you got to just push through
[5:01] sometimes you start off and man
[5:02] everybody's in one Accord and you just
[5:04] start real awesome and then it kind of
[5:05] Fades off to the end
[5:07] maybe I wear the people out or something
[5:10] um but you never know how it's going to
[5:12] go so what we must do is just be
[5:13] faithful
[5:15] we just got to be faithful the Bible
[5:16] said a Workman that needeth not be
[5:18] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[5:20] Truth and so you know we just rejoice in
[5:22] what God has done and of course what God
[5:24] is doing
[5:26] and we're so grateful for God's love and
[5:29] his Mercy praise God you want to make
[5:30] sure I got a few thoughts there okay
[5:32] all right so you know with this series
[5:34] we just want to remember that what we're
[5:36] doing is we're yielding our body to
[5:38] Jesus
[5:39] you know I think I think the uh
[5:41] the the battle many times is you know we
[5:44] we think we only have to yield the soul
[5:46] to Jesus you know we just got to get
[5:47] born again you know and uh then no
[5:49] matter what happens after that you know
[5:51] we're okay which that's true in one
[5:52] sense but uh if if that's if that's our
[5:55] attitude then we're only getting victory
[5:57] in one third of the battle
[5:59] praise God but the battle is three
[6:02] fronts praise God right it's it's Soul
[6:05] spirit and body praise God and so we
[6:09] want to have victory in all three Realms
[6:11] praise God I don't know about you but I
[6:12] don't want my body to get such
[6:14] sicknesses that my body can't praise the
[6:15] Lord
[6:16] I want to keep my I want to keep my body
[6:18] healthy by God's grace right I want to
[6:20] keep it healthy so that my body can
[6:22] praise the Lord
[6:24] right
[6:25] I don't want to get so sick and and weak
[6:28] and tired that uh mistreat my body like
[6:30] the like the brother James told me
[6:32] brother James Browning he said my only
[6:33] regret is that I didn't eat healthy all
[6:35] those years he said because now I got
[6:38] heart trouble and I didn't exercise and
[6:39] I didn't take care of myself
[6:41] and so I said well ever ever since I
[6:43] heard that I said that and it's going to
[6:45] encourage me to keep working out because
[6:47] I want to serve God as long as I
[6:48] possibly can until the Rapture praise
[6:50] God or until I go to the Grave my body
[6:53] goes there but my soul goes to heaven
[6:54] praise God
[6:55] and so I want to yield all three parts I
[6:58] don't want to give God 33 percent of me
[6:59] I want to give God 100 of me praise God
[7:02] Hallelujah by God's grace I'll do that
[7:04] you will too by God's grace we've got to
[7:06] learn to do that
[7:08] and so the Bible you know makes it plain
[7:10] you know what know you not that your
[7:13] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[7:16] which is in you
[7:17] which you have of God and ye are not
[7:20] your own this is a great verse to remind
[7:21] us ourselves our body doesn't even
[7:23] belong to us you know the world tells
[7:26] you it's your body your choice like
[7:27] that's the women right they can have
[7:28] abortions because it's your body your
[7:30] choice it's not
[7:31] your body is God's
[7:34] he he purchased our bodies with his own
[7:36] blood praise God the blood of God and so
[7:40] we have to remember our body is a church
[7:42] building
[7:43] and I know about I'm pretty sure you
[7:45] would agree if God has a church building
[7:47] he wants it full of Praise Hallelujah he
[7:50] don't want it full of you know
[7:51] depression and he don't want it full of
[7:53] anger and wrath and he don't want it
[7:56] full of that God wants his house full of
[7:58] worship praise God he doesn't want a
[8:00] silent church he wants a church that is
[8:02] ready to give God praise amen I'm going
[8:04] to prove it to you tonight praise God
[8:05] it's in the Psalms that the Bible said
[8:07] we should praise God from the rising of
[8:09] the Sun to the going down of the same
[8:11] amen amen God deserves praise all the
[8:13] time Hallelujah from the time you wake
[8:15] up to the time you lay your head he
[8:17] deserves all the praise hallelujah amen
[8:20] he's reminding us what don't you know
[8:23] don't you remember that your body is a
[8:25] temple the Holy Ghost you are bought
[8:28] with a price a heavy price was paid to
[8:30] buy your body
[8:32] Hallelujah therefore because such a high
[8:34] price was paid glorify God in your body
[8:37] and in your spirit which are Gods now
[8:39] think of this church I paid a heavy
[8:41] price for my van out there
[8:43] I knew it when I was going into it I
[8:45] paid a heavy price so that's why I take
[8:46] care of it right
[8:48] Hallelujah
[8:50] like I think nature asked me last time
[8:51] why do you keep these mats there and I'm
[8:53] like well if there's any permanent spill
[8:54] I can keep off those carpets I'm going
[8:56] to keep it off there because I want this
[8:58] thing to last forever well not forever
[9:00] but as long as I can at least all the
[9:02] kids are moved out or whatever happens
[9:03] you know actually I can load grandkids
[9:05] in there by God's grace
[9:07] but a heavy price was paid for so I take
[9:10] care of it now that's just the natural
[9:12] if that's a natural what about the
[9:14] spiritual praise God
[9:15] if Jesus is blood and he died to to
[9:19] purchase my body it was such a heavy
[9:22] price how much how much greater is that
[9:24] there for therefore I'm gonna take care
[9:26] of my body and therefore I'm gonna take
[9:28] care of my mind praise God
[9:30] I'm going to make sure I meditate on the
[9:32] right things and not the wrong things
[9:35] I'm going to make sure I take care of my
[9:37] body praise God that I have Temperance
[9:39] of the Holy Ghost I get up there amen
[9:40] amen I'm not going to give in the
[9:42] fleshly all the fleshly passions praise
[9:44] God right I don't have to be a legalist
[9:46] or I could have sugar every now and then
[9:48] but sugar is going to cause cancer too
[9:49] much sugar is going to cause cancer
[9:51] praise God
[9:52] we should know that right
[9:54] and we should take care of our body
[9:56] right make your heart strong unless
[9:58] you're going to have heart disease right
[9:59] you gotta exercise you got to take care
[10:01] of your heart praise God
[10:03] but we should glorify God whatever
[10:04] brings God glory we should do it in our
[10:07] body and our spirit and of course our
[10:10] soul which is God's Hallelujah
[10:12] and remember this verse of course of
[10:14] course again it's just a beautiful
[10:15] reminder you'd your body mind and soul
[10:18] to Holiness not to unrighteousness
[10:22] Hallelujah
[10:23] I'm going to skip down here for as you
[10:25] have yielded your members servants to
[10:28] uncleanness and iniquity to iniquity
[10:29] even so now yield your members servants
[10:32] to righteousness unto holiness
[10:36] okay
[10:38] so you know when I was a sinner I would
[10:40] go from from cigarette pack to cigarette
[10:42] pack or from uh it may be hard to
[10:44] imagine now you know but or from chewing
[10:47] tobacco 10 to the next 10. I go from 10
[10:49] to 10. right I've got to have a fresh
[10:51] anointing each time I've got to have a
[10:54] fresh taste each day that's how it is
[10:55] with God I gotta have a fresh rejoicing
[10:57] with Jesus every single day praise God
[10:59] I'm yielding my body to that I'm uniting
[11:02] my mind to that I need a fresh
[11:04] experience every day praise God
[11:07] see we're uniting that I've gotta in
[11:09] other words I had to make time to go buy
[11:11] the tin I had to make time to to chew it

[11:16] to make time to spend with Jesus amen
[11:19] amen I've got to make time to be in the
[11:22] presence of God I've got to make time to
[11:24] do that because my Tempo needs to be
[11:26] worshipful praise God I don't want a
[11:28] quiet church right and the church said I
[11:31] said like this we don't want this quiet
[11:33] Church

[12:08] Brandon says use your intellect
[12:10] right like there's a move in the tape
[12:13] Church movement there's a and I don't
[12:15] want to go deep in that but there's a
[12:16] move in there where the the Pastor said
[12:18] just relax and don't think of anything
[12:19] you can just say Amen to every word
[12:22] that's opening themselves up to Demons
[12:25] intellectual demons
[12:27] right Demons of idolatry
[12:30] the Bible never taught us that the Bible
[12:32] said prove all things and so the prophet
[12:35] said the same thing amen hallelujah but
[12:38] we come here we got to use our mind
[12:39] right but then it also you know if we
[12:41] get our mind right then the joy and the
[12:43] Victory sure flow out to our bodies

[12:51] right you know you want you want the
[12:53] channel like like of water right water
[12:55] we didn't have water the channel of
[12:56] water was closed up on Sunday so we had
[12:58] to go to my house because the channels
[12:59] were open
[13:00] right yeah and you want your channels
[13:03] flowing with God's spirit praise God
[13:05] glory amen you want your channels open
[13:08] oh my what a type a Frozen a Frozen
[13:10] channels I mean what a beautiful there's
[13:12] a stiff cold Icy starchy he said a
[13:16] church service where their chat where
[13:18] the temperature is spiritually below
[13:20] zero
[13:21] and there's no shouting there's no
[13:23] rejoicing there's no happiness there's
[13:25] no gladness there's no fire but we
[13:27] should have fire in our lives we should
[13:29] have channels open the fire should be
[13:31] burning amen God should be producing
[13:33] heat in our lives and and and and and
[13:35] burn up anything that's frozen
[13:38] unthought praise God so the Tails can
[13:41] flow the waters can flow Living Waters
[13:44] can flow praise God
[13:45] ah hallelujah amen open up those
[13:48] channels praise God
[13:51] where we can have like we said
[13:53] testimonies where if people come in here
[13:54] discouraged they can be encouraged by
[13:56] the time they leave
[13:57] and it don't have to be the pastor all
[13:59] the time it can be one of you praise God
[14:00] as you know right each one of us must be
[14:03] open to the leading of the Holy Spirit
[14:05] praise God flowing through our intellect
[14:08] because remember we don't want to give
[14:10] any of these places brother Chris these
[14:11] are all rooms in your mind there's a
[14:13] room in your mind called the conscience
[14:15] there's one called the memory your
[14:18] reason your affection your imagination
[14:20] and if we're not careful we'll give
[14:22] Satan like here here's like let's say I
[14:24] hold this evil memory against brother
[14:25] Chris or hold a memory against that that
[14:28] sister or that brother
[14:30] see we can't do that we can't give any
[14:32] place to the devil right we're all going
[14:34] to have struggles we're all going to
[14:35] battle but the best part is we can cast
[14:38] all of our cares on the Lord
[14:41] my wife get honey what's that good meme
[14:43] you told me worrying is talking to
[14:45] yourself
[14:46] about your problems but praying is
[14:48] talking to God with your problems
[14:49] something like that go ahead and say it
[14:51] for us
[14:54] try your best
[14:59] yes
[15:02] amen
[15:03] so worry is a conversation you have with
[15:05] yourself but you can take those same
[15:07] words and talk them to Jesus and that is
[15:10] not word anymore it's Lord I gotta I
[15:12] gotta talk with you praise God the Bible
[15:14] said commune with your heart to the Lord
[15:16] amen hallelujah thank you honey I
[15:19] appreciate that sweetie thanks for being
[15:20] on the spot I knew you remember because
[15:22] you got a good memory
[15:23] you're really yeah that's really you
[15:25] gotta you give your place to the Lord
[15:27] there amen hallelujah
[15:29] my memory's not so great it's probably
[15:30] because I don't sleep enough but anyways
[15:32] uh you know we don't want to yield any
[15:34] of these places to Satan but if there's
[15:36] a stronghold the Bible says we have
[15:39] weapons to tear it down praise God ah
[15:41] each one of us need those weapons amen
[15:44] the weapons of the word amen we're all
[15:46] going to have strongholds we're all
[15:48] going to have problems we're all gonna
[15:49] have mind battles it's just it's just
[15:50] part of living but we all have access to
[15:53] Greater Powers we all have access to a
[15:56] greater stronghold a greater Fortress A
[16:00] Mighty Fortress Is Our God Amen if I can
[16:03] quote Martin Luther there praise God the
[16:04] fifth Church Ace messenger Hallelujah A
[16:08] Mighty Fortress Is Our God
[16:10] in other words God's got a bigger Tower
[16:12] than that one so God's kingdom Reigns
[16:15] God's kingdom rules
[16:17] Hallelujah
[16:19] Glory now somebody says review but
[16:22] remember
[16:22] so affections brother Chris is your
[16:24] emotions right the Bible said if you're
[16:26] risen with Christ seek those things
[16:28] which are above now it's a balance right
[16:30] because we have to seek things here I
[16:32] gotta have food shelter clothing out of
[16:34] all these things but while we're doing
[16:36] that our affection should be on Heaven
[16:38] Lord I just got to have this this is
[16:40] only temporary I just need this for a
[16:41] little while but my main point is to
[16:43] glorify you in what I need and the money
[16:46] and everything the main thing is I want
[16:48] to glorify you while I'm on this Earth
[16:49] praise God
[16:51] so if your resume is with Christ seek
[16:54] those things where Christ sits on the
[16:56] right hand of God
[16:58] set your affection on things above set
[17:00] your emotions
[17:03] right
[17:04] now that's anger too Church
[17:07] set your anger on the devil that's in
[17:09] heaven right
[17:11] right the Bible says that Bob said you
[17:13] can have a spirit of Revenge if you fall
[17:15] in sin you repent and then you have
[17:17] Revenge I'm not going back to that again
[17:19] when the enemy comes I'm turning him
[17:21] down amen
[17:23] you can be angry and said not Hallelujah
[17:26] right set your affection it's okay all
[17:29] those emotions God wants you have all
[17:30] those emotions but when it's directed
[17:32] the right way it'll always glorify God
[17:34] it'll make you more than a conqueror
[17:36] praise God
[17:38] in Christ Jesus
[17:40] so you don't set your emotions on
[17:43] uh
[17:44] you know
[17:46] you know temporary things
[17:48] you know uh
[17:51] you know we we must not set our emotions
[17:53] on things that are temporary like we
[17:56] know these things are going to pass away
[17:57] so they should not have the most emotion
[17:59] in our hearts and Minds like our jobs
[18:03] right or like like any temporary thing
[18:06] we should not get too emotionally
[18:07] attached because we found with job
[18:10] sometimes God just takes him away
[18:13] and I've always prayed that prayer Lord
[18:14] let me have job Faith so no matter what
[18:16] happens I can say the Lord gives the
[18:19] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[18:21] the Lord
[18:23] now God forbid we'd have to go through
[18:24] what job would went through as a as a
[18:26] man of God that he went through who was
[18:29] tested to the utmost
[18:31] but I loved how he still had his
[18:33] affection on things above he was still
[18:35] able to acknowledge God and give him
[18:37] praise Hallelujah for you are dead how
[18:40] many dead tonight
[18:41] and your life is in with Christ in God
[18:45] Amen
[18:46] where's your life it's in Christ which
[18:49] is in God Amen
[18:51] so God is my life other than my life is
[18:54] done I don't live for Jesse Smith I live
[18:56] for Jesus Christ amen my life is in
[18:59] Christ and that life is in God
[19:01] hallelujah it all goes back Amen to God
[19:06] I just want to read this here
[19:08] see a road is built a good road is built
[19:11] the highest part is in the center and
[19:12] I've read this so if you maybe last year
[19:14] because it lets all the trash wash off
[19:16] both sides that's it when a man really
[19:18] comes to Christ he's got his eyes
[19:19] centered on Christ if he's a little bit
[19:21] emotional he'll be a fanatic
[19:23] if he's a little cold he'll get on the
[19:26] other side and just be a cucumber over
[19:28] on that side
[19:31] right now we can all think of people who
[19:33] they when they're right when they get
[19:34] saved they're either too emotional or
[19:36] too cold
[19:38] now Church those of us who are
[19:39] experienced shouldn't be either one
[19:40] those of us who are experienced should
[19:42] be right in the middle of the road
[19:44] Hallelujah because we ain't babies
[19:45] anymore
[19:47] we're not just brother Branham calls
[19:49] them fresh recruits we're not fresh
[19:51] recruits we've been serving God a while
[19:52] now praise God oh
[19:54] amen
[19:56] right Hallelujah I'm not just some fresh
[19:58] recruit I've been serving God for 20

[20:11] they're they're in position uh thank God
[20:14] Amen thank God we can be in possession
[20:16] Hallelujah
[20:19] now be careful you don't want to sit
[20:20] there like a cucumber during service I
[20:22] don't want to preach like a cucumber
[20:24] we don't want cucumber preachers we want
[20:26] Eagle preachers right we don't or
[20:29] whatever you would say whatever you call
[20:30] a firecracker preacher that's what
[20:32] Barbara said Peter was a Firebrand amen
[20:35] hallelujah thank God Amen we don't want
[20:38] a cucumber preacher
[20:40] see
[20:42] the main thing
[20:44] is right in the middle of the road I'm
[20:46] sorry yeah yeah the main thing is right
[20:48] in the middle of the road with enough
[20:49] spirit in you keep you warm and moving
[20:51] on
[20:52] amen and knowing enough to keep yourself
[20:55] under obedience to the spirit
[20:58] see knowing knowing enough
[21:01] see
[21:02] to move just as the spirit moves I'm so
[21:05] glad I moved in the channel of this
[21:06] dance series
[21:08] because people have been blessed
[21:09] Hallelujah
[21:10] and that God's given us some indication
[21:12] it was the right direction praise God
[21:13] see just under just obey the Lord obey
[21:16] the Lord every day obey the Lord and God
[21:17] will move you in the right channels
[21:18] Hallelujah
[21:20] not till or not after but just as the
[21:23] spirit moves
[21:26] and now look what the church has done
[21:28] it's got off on a bunch of fanaticism
[21:30] and went either went real starchy and
[21:33] stiff and take none of it but brother
[21:35] there's a middle of the road where the
[21:37] true
[21:38] real true gospel is preached and the
[21:40] real true Bible signs and wonders
[21:41] following a Sweet Holy Spirit that leads
[21:44] the church that's the kind of a church
[21:46] to go to an intellectual Church
[21:48] preaching the word standing on the word
[21:50] with a real Full Gospel sermon real
[21:53] spirit of God everything in the spirit
[21:55] everything is decent everybody in order
[21:57] everything in love that's the kind of
[21:59] church we want how many wants to belong
[22:01] to that kind of church raise your hands
[22:03] why sure we all do well God wants us to
[22:06] what made the difference we just started
[22:07] getting a little arrogant and different
[22:09] in our churches and the dove flew away
[22:12] now Church most churches
[22:14] are on the stiff and starches I think of
[22:16] Luther think of Baptist think of
[22:19] Presbyterian right Catholic we went to
[22:22] Catholic church with brother William two
[22:23] years ago
[22:24] or last year
[22:26] I mean most churches are on this stiff
[22:28] cold side stiff and starchy just sit up
[22:30] or kneel down to Catholic at least the
[22:31] Catholics kneel down some Churches don't
[22:33] even kneel right at least they kneel now
[22:35] of course their way off the word
[22:37] but we don't want to be stiff and
[22:38] starchy and can't be moved by the Holy
[22:40] Spirit
[22:41] but we don't want to be it's all emotion
[22:43] if I don't sing or if I don't shout or
[22:45] if somebody doesn't cry somebody doesn't
[22:47] scream we didn't have church I want to
[22:49] be right in the middle of the road
[22:50] praise God
[22:51] I don't want to be a cucumber but I
[22:53] don't want to be a distraction praise
[22:55] God
[22:56] Hallelujah as far as I know there's very
[22:58] few distractions in our church just so
[23:00] you know in other words most people
[23:01] aren't on that fanatical side
[23:04] we've had some before
[23:06] right where the people shout too loud or
[23:07] shout too much right we've had some like
[23:10] that over the years just a couple
[23:12] you have some of that where it seems
[23:14] like the person is drawing attention to
[23:16] themselves
[23:17] rather than giving the glory to Christ
[23:20] right and of course we know later
[23:22] because by their fruits there are known
[23:25] right eventually they leave the word of
[23:27] God
[23:28] right
[23:29] see the what happens is when we become
[23:32] cucumbers we let the dove fly away
[23:34] rather than say Lord keep me sweet
[23:36] keep my life sweet with you help me to
[23:38] have a balance of love and and
[23:40] understanding and wisdom and a decent uh
[23:44] a real Bible sermon give me the real
[23:47] Bible signs wonders and miracles praise
[23:49] God oh it's beautiful
[23:52] now brother Brown says now we've got to
[23:54] have order but what he means here when
[23:55] he says got out of order you got to get
[23:57] out of the Cucumber state

[31:09] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[31:11] have received the Holy Ghost but we just
[31:13] receive enough holy ghost in us to make
[31:15] us to a place where we don't want to lie
[31:17] we don't want to steal we don't want to
[31:19] do anything but God wants to fill every
[31:21] fiber of his church
[31:24] he wants to fill your thinking and he
[31:27] wants to fill your mind he wants to fill
[31:28] every bit of you just make you
[31:31] completely totally dead to yourself or
[31:33] to your thinking just so surrendered in

[31:38] but God's word just stay right with his
[31:41] word it is life my words are life said
[31:44] Jesus he's placed with them teachers
[31:46] believe in the Bible prophets that say
[31:48] the truth that say show the same

[31:54] showing himself alive among them
[31:55] confirming his word his word the kingdom
[31:58] of God is God's word made Power
[32:01] Church like I tell these guys struggle
[32:03] with pornography I said quote the word
[32:06] of God to the devil and say I'm not
[32:08] doing it and you watch the word of God
[32:10] will back up Satan Hallelujah
[32:13] you can't quote the word and then not
[32:15] have it active if you're quoting like
[32:18] that you don't even believe it
[32:20] but the word has power in any situation
[32:23] just quote the word believe it stand
[32:25] behind the word and you watch the word
[32:27] it'll drive back Satan Hallelujah
[32:32] Hallelujah
[32:33] like I told those guys I said some of
[32:35] those guys said you stare in that mirror
[32:37] and you tell and you preach it to
[32:39] yourself
[32:39] say I you like even science knows it you
[32:43] you can't look at yours you can't say
[32:44] like I'm not a healthy person if you
[32:46] want to become healthy even science says
[32:48] you got to say you have to you have to
[32:50] be identified with what you want to be
[32:53] like it they say if you want to overcome
[32:55] cigarettes you got to say well I'm not a
[32:57] cigarette smoker
[32:58] and that will help you overcome
[32:59] cigarettes you have to change your
[33:01] identity and if anybody ever changed
[33:03] your identity it was Jesus
[33:06] Hallelujah because you're you're dead
[33:08] your life is dead right your old life is
[33:11] dead but now you're alive in Christ you
[33:13] have a new identity you are not your own
[33:16] you're born with a price you belong to
[33:18] God Amen
[33:21] like if you have trouble exercising you
[33:23] got to have the mindset well I'm a
[33:24] healthy person that's why I gotta go
[33:25] exercise
[33:27] when you've changed your identity then
[33:29] it's easier to do what those type of
[33:31] people do because that's your identity
[33:33] so then you say well I'm a holy ghost
[33:35] he'll say I'm a worshiper amen I am
[33:39] meant to worship God I'm not a cucumber
[33:42] praise God let's keep going back to

[34:08] God Amen
[34:10] oh it's beautiful
[34:11] gotta change your identity
[34:18] always when the power of God comes in
[34:21] the walls that you build around you fall
[34:23] remember that isolation sermon
[34:25] sometimes we let Satan build us in we
[34:28] isolate ourselves when the power of God
[34:30] comes it breaks down those walls of
[34:32] isolation
[34:34] it's no longer just me and myself and my
[34:36] pity party and the devil
[34:39] right because he's the one who's giving
[34:40] you the pity party
[34:42] the holy and the power of God comes in
[34:44] he breaks down the Walls brother Adam
[34:46] said that you built around you that you
[34:49] built in your mind
[34:50] how can I go on
[34:52] how in the world could I ever make it
[34:54] how could I be made well how could I
[34:56] ever get Revival
[34:58] right all these things we build up I can
[35:00] never have peace with this person I can
[35:02] never be friends again with that person
[35:03] I can never face that person you built
[35:06] your own walls but when the power of God
[35:08] comes in he breaks down the Walls amen I
[35:11] say like this is better than Domino's
[35:12] it's easier than dominoes for God to
[35:14] break down you think dominoes are easy I
[35:17] think I mean you think that my God can
[35:18] do greater than that praise God God just
[35:20] has to blow I mean God I mean he's so
[35:23] powerful praise God
[35:24] nothing is too hard for God in other
[35:26] words God help us to stop building walls
[35:28] and let the power of God come in and
[35:30] break down all those walls Hallelujah
[35:35] see your denomination walls will crush
[35:37] and God will be known again he's the
[35:40] same yesterday to name forever his every
[35:42] fiber filling with the Holy Ghost every
[35:45] muscle field he's talking about Samson
[35:46] now look at this he went from having all
[35:48] these walls of of sexual immorality
[35:50] right and all these walls have I lost my
[35:53] eyes and woe is me I'm a slave the rest
[35:55] of my life I can never do anything for
[35:57] God he let the Holy Ghost break down all
[35:59] those walls and even now I can do
[36:02] something for God and it turned out as
[36:04] brother Adam said it was Samson's
[36:06] greatest Victory Hallelujah
[36:09] in his darkest moment when he let the
[36:12] Holy Ghost pour into his life amen oh I
[36:15] love this it filled every fiber of his
[36:18] being praise God
[36:19] not just his soul well I'm saved now
[36:21] Hallelujah now I can die Samson no he
[36:25] said fill every fiber oh my fill my mind
[36:28] fill my fill my soul and fill my body
[36:32] praise God so I can get a great victory
[36:34] for Jehovah let me die with the
[36:37] Philistines that prophecy might be
[36:39] fulfilled praise God
[36:44] let me die to myself that prophecy might
[36:47] be fulfilled in The Bride of Jesus
[36:48] Christ
[36:50] Hallelujah
[36:56] see every fiber
[36:58] talk about muscles filled with creatine
[37:00] right or you talk about muscles filled
[37:03] with protein how about muscles filled
[37:04] with the Holy Ghost now now we're on to
[37:07] something praise God hallelujah
[37:10] but really the main thing is the mind
[37:12] right that's the main thing
[37:16] oh Church the Living God I'm going to
[37:17] omit the rest of my notes to say this
[37:19] one thing why don't we are you ready
[37:21] Assemblies of God are you ready United
[37:22] Church are you ready one is sanitary
[37:24] whatever you are you ready Church of God
[37:25] are you ready right of Christ Fellowship
[37:28] to let God fill every fiber of your
[37:31] being praise God
[37:32] just flow through me Lord Jesus whatever
[37:34] you want to do tonight
[37:36] just flow through me praise God
[37:39] and do what only you can do praise God
[37:43] Hallelujah
[37:45] like we've seen I'm just going to go
[37:47] back to some of these examples sometimes
[37:48] all it takes is somebody else's prayer
[37:50] or a word of wisdom from somebody and
[37:53] you are set free
[37:54] we've seen it we've been doing podcasts
[37:56] right we've seen it sometimes it just
[37:58] takes a hand laid on somebody and
[38:00] they're instantly healed in the night
[38:01] time hallelujah amen praise God
[38:04] sometimes it just takes a group of
[38:06] sisters to talk to somebody and they're
[38:08] instantly set free
[38:09] the burn is gone Hallelujah sometimes
[38:13] that's all it takes sometimes all it
[38:15] takes is somebody to come up for prayer
[38:16] and you feel the fire of God burning up
[38:18] in your bosom remember brother the first
[38:20] time you're here last year
[38:23] Hallelujah sometimes it's all it is
[38:27] but see we got to yield to the holy
[38:29] spirit so the spirit of God fills every
[38:31] part of our being
[38:33] is it already 40 minutes preaching
[38:35] unbelievable
[38:37] unbelievable
[38:38] I don't know how this happens
[38:41] something wrong with that clock
[38:42] now this beautiful quote I may preach a
[38:44] whole series on this sermon this sermon
[38:46] is so powerful
[38:47] so brother I'm talking about there's
[38:49] four there's four bugs that kill the
[38:51] Holy Ghost anointing in unbelievers
[38:53] lives
[38:54] so God has four steps to restore it
[38:57] right he has the four anointings right
[38:59] with the church ages
[39:01] brother RAM does it like this he types
[39:03] it as a tree right a tree
[39:05] Jesus or yeah the Bible said I'll
[39:07] restore saith Lord hallelujah glory to
[39:09] God praise be to God the fourth light is
[39:11] to come that will bring the forth the
[39:13] same signs watch justification brought
[39:15] back the pope so Brothers using a tree
[39:18] as the the whole bride of Christ
[39:20] so the tree had started dying on the
[39:22] inside the inside would be the pulp of
[39:24] the tree right but but Martin Luther
[39:26] brought back the pulp
[39:29] the just shall live by faith live amen
[39:31] but just shall live Hallelujah live by
[39:35] faith First Step it's another tree it's
[39:38] dead it's dead uh any any anything else
[39:42] on the tree is dead otherwise there's
[39:44] trees that except now the trees got life
[39:46] in the pulp
[39:47] it looks on the outside looks like it's
[39:49] dead no signs of life but now Luther
[39:51] brought pulp back to the tree
[39:58] he said but sanctification through
[40:01] Wesley brought back the bark the
[40:04] doctrine of holiness
[40:05] so see when women start cutting their
[40:07] hair or wearing makeup or Men start
[40:09] wearing shorts it's like the tree is
[40:11] naked there's no bark on the tree
[40:15] right so the bark is the covering that's
[40:17] why then God sisters got your bark on
[40:19] tonight praise God
[40:20] Hallelujah
[40:23] thank God Amen if not we'd have a naked
[40:25] tree
[40:26] there's no bark on the street
[40:27] something's wrong with that it might
[40:28] have the pulp inside think of how many
[40:30] churches brother have trees that are
[40:32] naked naked churches and naked trees in
[40:35] the church
[40:35] but yet there's a little pulp on the
[40:37] inside
[40:38] right
[40:41] but thank God we've been restored
[40:44] we're not naked trees I've got bark amen
[40:47] the children can rip the bark off you
[40:49] know they can they can see oh it's a
[40:51] healthy tree I got signs I've got life
[40:54] praise God
[40:55] can I say this I've got signs I'm living
[40:57] a holy life praise God
[41:00] now remember this is what Satan does in
[41:02] the opposite order though we'll we'll
[41:03] see that what brought back the leaf the
[41:07] Pentecostal so zuza Street Pentecost
[41:09] those leaves clap their hand Joy
[41:12] rejoicing Pentecostal
[41:15] hallelujah what was the fourth was the
[41:18] word itself in other words the Seven
[41:19] Seals the mysteries of God the word made
[41:22] flesh fruits of the proof of the fruits
[41:25] there it is proof of the Resurrection
[41:27] sign that Christ is finally after
[41:29] justification has been planted
[41:30] sanctification has been planted baptism
[41:33] the Holy Ghost organizations night out
[41:35] and Christ has again centered himself
[41:37] like that cap on the pyramid first line
[41:40] justification sanctification baptism
[41:42] Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap
[41:44] amen isn't that beautiful I thought now
[41:48] see George when we're healthy Christians
[41:50] all the we're producing all these fruits
[41:54] right people can feel your love
[41:56] people can feel your long suffering
[41:59] Hallelujah people can see the fruit of
[42:02] faith in your life come on they still
[42:03] got faith after all these tests and
[42:04] proud
[42:06] Hallelujah they're still patient after
[42:08] all these trials they're still patient
[42:10] in the midst of this
[42:13] but see Satan comes around he tries to
[42:15] eat away all of our fruits well now we
[42:17] lost all the fruits well we might have a
[42:19] little clapping still right we still got
[42:20] the leaves right we might have a little
[42:22] clapping I'll clap a little bit at
[42:23] church
[42:24] but you gotta lost your patience well
[42:26] then pretty soon it gets you so cold you
[42:28] can't even clap anymore
[42:30] you have to wait to the preacher or the
[42:32] song there says let's give God a praise
[42:33] praise the Lord
[42:35] let's clap for Jesus
[42:40] oh you cucumber
[42:42] let's not be a cucumber charger come on
[42:44] let's not let the bug eat away all of
[42:47] our leaves amen all of our fruits let's
[42:51] manifest fruits for the glory of God
[42:53] hallelujah
[42:55] see they leave they
[42:57] these people people let Satan eat away
[43:00] their leaves
[43:02] They Don't Clap anymore they don't sing
[43:04] and praise anymore they don't got any
[43:07] leaves
[43:10] can't shout Amen to the word of God
[43:13] there's no noise it's just dead like
[43:15] brother answer those moaning trees
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] ooh this moment we don't want to be that
[43:21] church we want to be living trees amen
[43:23] we want Pope praise God Amen we will
[43:27] burn we want leaves we want fruit we
[43:30] want to be the bride tree praise God
[43:32] I want to be a healthy Christian not a
[43:34] dying one
[43:36] Hallelujah
[43:38] I want to be planted by rivers of Living
[43:41] Water Lord Jesus I know you never do it
[43:43] but may I never plant myself out in the
[43:45] desert
[43:47] isolating myself out Jesus won't do that
[43:49] church we do that to ourselves
[43:52] Hallelujah Lord I know Lord you'll plant
[43:54] Me by rivers of Living Water
[43:56] I can always get a fresh drink anytime I
[43:59] want one
[44:00] is that right Church
[44:02] see so we've got to watch that in our
[44:04] lives Satan will eat away first at the
[44:06] fruit you're no longer patient no longer
[44:10] loving you can't love your enemies
[44:11] anymore
[44:12] you're upset at everybody
[44:14] where's the fruits of the spirit
[44:16] and then you come to church
[44:21] maybe it's not even that maybe just hang
[44:23] your head the whole time
[44:25] the bugs and the spiritually church God
[44:27] can see the bugs crawling all over here
[44:29] think about that
[44:31] all your all your leaves they're being
[44:33] eaten up
[44:35] right and then as we've seen then
[44:37] sometimes the sisters come with cut hair
[44:39] or man come
[44:41] uh in immoral clothes or men come and
[44:43] they're just disinterested they we've
[44:45] had Brothers come here that wouldn't
[44:46] even say we had a brother come here for
[44:48] seven years and never said amen to one
[44:50] word I said God help me I miss it all
[44:52] those years I I missed it that that
[44:55] brother had the bugs crawling all over
[44:57] him he had no leaves
[44:59] but the first time I met with him in a
[45:01] counselor I said you have the Holy Ghost
[45:02] and he said I don't know I should have
[45:03] called it right there
[45:05] but he could play music to make me cry
[45:07] and I thought well that's God he's got
[45:08] to have the Holy Ghost if he's making me
[45:09] cry
[45:10] I found out he didn't have the Holy
[45:12] Ghost
[45:13] I finally just had a gift
[45:15] right and when you operate the gift you
[45:16] get the you get the anointing going
[45:19] but Church the whole time in all those
[45:20] years never came up for prayer one time
[45:22] what was it the bugs are eating away and
[45:24] last time I talked to him he said I
[45:26] don't know if it's father son holy ghost
[45:27] or Lord Jesus Christ how could you not
[45:28] know that the name of Jesus Christ is
[45:31] the name above all names
[45:34] and church bugs have been eating on him
[45:35] for 40 years probably
[45:38] so let's learn from that church I don't
[45:40] do that to bad mouth people I do that so
[45:42] we get a warning because Jesus said
[45:44] remember a Lot's wife
[45:45] remember the brother who had no leaves
[45:48] right
[45:49] remember the brother who had no fruit
[45:50] let my life be a fruitful healthy
[45:54] Christian experience praise God
[45:57] please God don't let me be a cucumber
[45:59] let me be a real living epistle a real
[46:01] living tree where people can come enjoy
[46:04] the fruits of my life amen they know
[46:07] they can walk up to brother Jesse and
[46:08] they're going to get some fruits of the
[46:10] Holy Spirit praise God
[46:11] I'm not going to say I don't have time
[46:13] to talk to you I don't want to hear your
[46:14] voice
[46:16] we got time for you
[46:19] may God give us Grace that we can always
[46:21] show the fruits of the Holy Spirit
[46:28] I thought that's a beautiful quote
[46:30] so now you know church when you start
[46:32] losing your clap now you know what the
[46:33] bug the bug's trying to eat your leaves
[46:34] now
[46:36] Hallelujah
[46:38] that's what you know now you know
[46:40] he's trying to eat away at your worship
[46:45] that's why it's good to dance every now
[46:46] and then because you got some victory in
[46:47] your life
[46:49] Hallelujah and your dancing don't have
[46:51] to be like mine now everybody dancing
[46:53] had to be like David
[46:55] Hallelujah
[46:57] but you gotta do something for the Lord
[46:59] you got to feel every fiber you got to
[47:02] feel the spirit of God in your feet amen
[47:04] you got to command your feet to praise
[47:06] the Lord amen
[47:08] as far as you can do is stump stomp your
[47:10] way to Victory praise God
[47:13] Glory
[47:15] so see brother bear said I'd rather have
[47:17] Wildfire which is uncontrollable emotion
[47:21] or rather have somebody who's so
[47:23] uncontrollable than a dead cucumber
[47:26] because at least they're in touch with
[47:28] their emotions
[47:30] right someone who's dead they have shut
[47:31] off just like just like this this
[47:33] building had to shut off the water
[47:34] whoops I almost tripped off there they
[47:36] had to shut off the water to make sure
[47:38] that because the pipe some of the pipes
[47:39] froze this this weekend
[47:41] right but a cucumber shuts off all
[47:43] access God can't get any of their
[47:45] emotions
[47:46] and yet they'll Shout at the football
[47:48] game
[47:49] right they'll cry at the movie
[47:52] right they'll show all this excitement
[47:54] watching porn or some sex scene on a
[47:56] movie they'll show all this excitement I
[47:57] can't wait for this they've shut it off
[47:59] to God but the devil's got it all
[48:01] clogged up
[48:02] they're not setting their affections on
[48:04] things above
[48:05] we have to we have to make a point I'm
[48:08] only going to give God my emotions
[48:11] Hallelujah I'm going to reserve all my
[48:14] praise to God
[48:16] Hallelujah
[48:18] like you can you can you can ask Malachi
[48:20] Malachi's my witness when my nephew last
[48:22] year was in the playoffs
[48:24] I was praying for him to have a good
[48:25] game
[48:27] okay that was the first game I went to
[48:29] in like 15 or 10 years something like
[48:31] that I don't go to games just for go to
[48:33] games I believe it's sinful to go to
[48:34] games just for fun
[48:36] but I went to support my nephew and I
[48:37] prayed before you can ask maokai when he
[48:39] scored a second third touchdown I said I
[48:41] said praise the Lord and everybody's
[48:43] like looking at me well these little
[48:45] group was looking at me
[48:47] I said Hallelujah to turn around and
[48:49] look at people staring at me
[48:51] because it's what I prayed for
[48:53] and now he's got a scholarship to go to
[48:54] Toledo so I said Hallelujah
[48:56] Hallelujah
[48:58] like I was like praise God
[49:01] that's just what I prayed for you know
[49:04] it was I wasn't rejoicing the natural I
[49:06] was rejoicing because God heard my
[49:08] prayer Hallelujah
[49:12] the Wildfire maybe at the football game
[49:15] Hallelujah
[49:17] he said this is Brother uh Reed had
[49:19] brother Brandon I'm here today to ask
[49:21] this I've seen the Pentecost listen kick
[49:23] the seats out in the floor
[49:24] has anyone ever done that that's good
[49:26] timing Malachi has anybody ever kicked
[49:28] the seat
[49:31] like anybody ever got so emotional they
[49:33] kicked the seat out
[49:35] this preacher had seen the Pentecostals
[49:38] kick the seats out in the floor and
[49:39] break up the furniture has anyone ever
[49:42] broken Furniture here no
[49:46] he said but have they got anything Reid
[49:50] has was it was a Baptist yes brother
[49:51] Reid had they have he said they have the
[49:53] Holy Ghost yes sir
[49:56] when you're praising God and you might
[49:58] I'm not going to do it you might bump
[50:00] this over you might break them
[50:02] if you're praising God and you break
[50:03] this guess what that can be replaced
[50:06] but at least you're not a dead cucumber
[50:09] Hallelujah Church
[50:11] I can buy you another guitar hopefully
[50:13] I can buy you another stand
[50:16] but man said these people had the Holy
[50:19] Ghost because they were praising God to
[50:21] a measure right
[50:22] it depends how much Holy Ghost they had
[50:24] based upon their reaction to the word of
[50:26] God because if you've got the word if
[50:28] you've got the Holy Ghost you can say
[50:29] Amen to every word of God
[50:31] ah hallelujah amen
[50:35] I said yes sir what kicking over
[50:38] furniture and breaking Furniture in the
[50:40] church you can have the Holy Ghost doing
[50:41] that yes sir well we about to have it
[50:44] too I said if you did you got it after
[50:46] you believe not when you believe they
[50:47] believe you get it when you believe
[50:49] Paulson Acts 19 have you received the
[50:51] Holy Ghost did you believed I said I can
[50:52] stand a little wildfire and kicking over
[50:54] Furniture over before I could sit in an
[50:57] old church so cold to the spiritual
[51:00] thermometer go 40 below zero we just saw
[51:03] 30 below zero this past weekend with the
[51:05] wind chill
[51:07] I was out there and I think you might
[51:09] have heard me say it on Christmas I was
[51:10] out there just 15 minutes shoveling snow
[51:12] and I had a permanent crease in my my
[51:15] lips like this I looked like the Joker
[51:16] If You Ever Seen The Joker I'd like I
[51:19] couldn't I was so my face was frozen so
[51:21] solid and come in yeah I was losing uh
[51:24] I'd come in because I was losing feeling
[51:25] in my fingers
[51:26] see it just puts this Frozen it puts you
[51:29] in this dead state it gets you stuck
[51:31] here so you don't you're not free
[51:33] anymore Hallelujah you're not warm
[51:35] anymore That's what Satan tries to do
[51:37] cool us off so he can't be moved by the
[51:40] Holy Spirit we can't give God praise
[51:42] we're not free to worship God Satan's
[51:44] trying to freeze us up but God's trying
[51:46] to thaw us out give us life and make us
[51:48] free give us Liberty praise God
[51:52] see Robert said I'd rather have that
[51:55] people kicking over the chairs and
[51:57] knocking over the chairs and and just
[52:00] you know knocking over things and
[52:01] kicking them I'd rather have that than
[52:03] dead church members
[52:05] dead cucumbers
[52:07] Hallelujah and the church said
[52:12] see because these people when they're
[52:14] cold they grieve the holy spirit so much
[52:16] they don't even know what the Holy
[52:18] Spirit feels like well at least somebody
[52:19] with a little emotion knows what the
[52:21] Holy Spirit feels like
[52:22] just got to ask for more wisdom control
[52:24] it
[52:25] Hallelujah
[52:27] Hallelujah when Dave was dancing the
[52:29] Bible never said he knocked over the ark
[52:31] and the church said that's a good
[52:32] thought
[52:33] that's a good thought
[52:34] that's right when brother Just Dances
[52:36] all over and I'm praising God I'm never
[52:38] knocked over
[52:39] the pulpit
[52:41] see because I'm under control
[52:43] I've got to control the Holy Ghost
[52:46] but I've been in Services where Saints
[52:48] haven't almost knocked over the entire
[52:50] uh they they've moved that there's a
[52:53] wooden Buick Camp search and I saw a
[52:55] sister get so in the spirit she she
[52:57] bumped this until it was like uneven it
[52:59] was way out here
[53:00] and she prayed that night for three
[53:02] hours straight after that we were just
[53:04] singing that was the night I was dancing
[53:05] I wrote it down I looked at my notes I
[53:07] was dancing two hours I danced around
[53:08] that church two hours came upstairs
[53:10] that was back in 2011. I got the notes
[53:12] on it too I got the sermon I saved too
[53:15] on that one
[53:16] but this whole row I saw I saw her knock
[53:18] this whole row and she come up screaming
[53:20] and crying and prayed there for three
[53:22] hours she said she woke up at midnight
[53:24] and she was starting at nine at nine PM
[53:26] praying there and woke up at midnight
[53:28] and where where have I been I've been in
[53:30] the spirit
[53:31] now a church we'd rather have that than
[53:33] dead cucumbers
[53:35] and the church said
[53:37] Hallelujah
[53:38] now that's not the evidence of the Holy
[53:40] Ghost as far as the soul but it is
[53:42] evidence you got in the spirit praise
[53:44] God
[53:45] hallelujah praise God
[53:48] see
[53:50] so see I've seen pews almost knocked
[53:53] over
[53:54] and God's in that oh yeah absolutely
[53:57] yeah that mother was seeking uh victory
[54:00] for her children she was seeking all
[54:01] kinds of things and she had testimonies
[54:03] after that service
[54:04] God answered some of her prayers
[54:06] she was so filled with God every five of
[54:09] her being amen she's just a little girl
[54:11] she's just a little old woman little
[54:13] mother but she sure moved that bench
[54:14] right there Hallelujah
[54:18] I got a lot of quotes on here how many
[54:19] quotes I have I'm sure going heavy
[54:20] quotes tonight here I'm trying okay I'm
[54:22] almost there I'm almost at the end here
[54:24] bye
[54:26] just flop then just keep on weather
[54:27] going up or you're down whichever way
[54:30] you're doing okay he's talking about how
[54:32] if you're an eagle a baby eaglet the
[54:35] mother will come find you
[54:37] right how many know that mothers will
[54:39] look out for their children praise God
[54:41] mother animals go searching for their
[54:43] babies
[54:45] mother's standing right out there
[54:46] soaring right around his eyes on the
[54:48] sparrow I know he watches in and out of
[54:51] his church to see if you got out
[54:52] topsy-turvy something will happen the
[54:54] big wings the word of God will bring you
[54:56] right back up somebody said that's
[54:58] Wildfire I'd rather have a little
[55:00] Wildfire than no fire at all you know
[55:02] all right we could take those big wings
[55:04] and bear it back up to the right is that
[55:06] right Brothers just think if it's just a
[55:08] little out of order why we'll just catch
[55:10] them on the wings see just exactly what
[55:12] it is and bring them back up into Grace
[55:14] again
[55:16] if he said if they just let them flop
[55:20] yes sir just let them go ahead and shout
[55:22] and praise the Lord and holler
[55:23] Hallelujah dance in the spirit whatever
[55:25] they want to do they get out of order we
[55:27] got something here The Wings God will
[55:30] never let you drop if you're an eagle
[55:33] Hallelujah in other words if you're
[55:35] worshiping God and freedom God will
[55:37] always protect you
[55:39] Hallelujah
[55:40] and I believe but I believe like this if
[55:42] God if you're willing the spirit God
[55:43] will keep you under control
[55:45] and I believe that is in order I believe
[55:47] that's the order or the command of the
[55:49] holy spirit for that service amen the
[55:51] girls ask me are we going to dance
[55:52] tonight I said if the Holy Spirit leads
[55:54] us
[55:54] Who Am I who am I to say when we're
[55:57] going to have it like I tried to set the
[55:59] dates but it don't really matter we
[56:00] actually had it before we actually had
[56:01] dance Services before my scheduled dance
[56:04] service amen
[56:05] but at least I was in the right season
[56:07] praise God oh yeah I had the wrong date
[56:09] brother but I had the right season
[56:10] hallelujah thank God Amen
[56:15] see God does it on his time not ours
[56:21] now if you're a buzzard
[56:23] you're failing anyhow you're falling
[56:24] down so you just splash out on the
[56:26] ground but if you're a real Eagle you'll
[56:27] listen the word of God you know that
[56:29] Mother's Wing will bring you right back
[56:30] to Grace again
[56:32] so I've had that I've I'll just give an
[56:33] example I'll have it where I'm almost
[56:35] falling off and I feel like God will
[56:36] catch me from falling on my face and
[56:37] hurt maybe hurting myself there's been
[56:39] times I've almost fallen off this pulpit
[56:42] or I'm like off balance and I almost go
[56:44] through that window I could go glass
[56:46] could break I could cut myself but so
[56:48] many times I've just been worshiping
[56:49] like that God has always caught me
[56:51] and the church said
[56:54] what would you think if your pastor fell
[56:55] through the back window that makes me
[56:57] think I should probably put a board up
[56:58] here actually just to be on the safe
[57:00] side
[57:02] bye but see every time I almost got out
[57:05] of order God is always gracious to us
[57:08] mother Eagles watching over I want to
[57:10] make sure my baby don't get too much out
[57:11] of order
[57:13] wherever they hurt themselves or
[57:15] something like that
[57:17] Mama Eagles watching over you girls how
[57:19] many believe that
[57:20] Mama Eagle's watching you
[57:23] and God if I really love God God won't
[57:26] let me get in the flesh too far
[57:28] to where his spirit will say you're a
[57:29] little out of order now you bring it
[57:31] right back
[57:32] how many believe that
[57:36] oh you got to believe that church
[57:37] because you'll be you'll you'll be so
[57:39] excited sometimes and then you'll say
[57:41] something flesh and you'll say oops I'm
[57:42] sorry I didn't mean to say that how many
[57:43] how many can relate to that
[57:45] if God helps you catch it there God will
[57:48] help you catch it in worship too
[57:51] Glory
[57:52] now this one I read to you a while ago
[57:54] or a couple weeks ago when I started
[57:56] this series
[57:57] he said I know there's a lot of
[57:58] fanaticism of people carry it on I know
[58:00] sometimes they do it when the music's
[58:01] jumping up and down and everything and I
[58:03] know that goes I believe that too I've
[58:04] seen people in that day as long as the
[58:06] music's playing everybody's jumping and
[58:08] screaming when the Music Stops they stop
[58:10] see
[58:11] well that's still all right as far as
[58:13] I'm concerned as long as a people lives
[58:16] right but now you start bringing that
[58:18] word that's a thing that actually brings
[58:20] life is the word and that brings the joy
[58:24] of stimulation of new wine and that's
[58:26] what it was on Pentecost when the word
[58:29] was Vindicated
[58:31] now that's what I found when we've had
[58:33] our dance services this month it was the
[58:35] word that brought me life and then I
[58:38] wanted to dance afterwards
[58:40] I had to save some of my dancing for
[58:42] afterwards right and even you if you
[58:44] feel like dancing you got to save it
[58:46] it's got to be in the right time and
[58:47] season
[58:49] right because you don't want to be a
[58:50] distraction
[58:51] but I'll say like this if you want to
[58:52] dance you go ahead and dance praise God
[58:54] I'll just keep preaching preaching the
[58:57] word of God Amen
[58:58] somebody's enjoyed it hallelujah amen
[59:01] see
[59:04] there's freedom
[59:06] the main thing is live right and let God
[59:09] flow through you and let's try to avoid
[59:11] being pickle Christians or cucumber
[59:13] Christians
[59:15] which sometimes I wonder are they even
[59:16] Christians
[59:18] uh
[59:19] right because Robert said you got to get
[59:21] out of order just to get saved
[59:23] you got to get out of the Cucumber
[59:25] experience just to get saved Hallelujah
[59:28] that's right now finally where I want
[59:31] this is kind of where I wanted to go
[59:33] I want to finish all the verses that
[59:35] talked about dancing
[59:38] now I don't want to let the cat out of
[59:39] the bag here too quick but go to
[59:40] proverbs 31 here
[59:42] proverbs 31 verse 25.
[59:47] I got two more sections that speak
[59:49] specifically of dancing
[59:52] and that Hebrew word is rejoicing
[59:54] remember whirling around rejoicing Joy
[59:56] spiraling
[59:58] uh Proverbs 31 25.
[1:00:08] now we ended last time remember in
[1:00:10] Isaiah
[1:00:11] remember Isaiah said God will make you
[1:00:13] to dance again you remember that
[1:00:16] God will build you up when you're weak
[1:00:18] when you're when your Castle is broken
[1:00:20] down God will build you back up so you
[1:00:23] can dance again
[1:00:25] your walls are servation our Salvation
[1:00:28] your gates are praise amen oh
[1:00:31] in other words God wants you to dance
[1:00:33] again amen God wants you to shout again
[1:00:36] God wants you to Rejoice again amen God
[1:00:39] wants you to scream again Hallelujah
[1:00:42] ah thank God Amen
[1:00:44] he's going to build you back up
[1:00:48] proverbs 31.
[1:00:50] I'll hear a few mothers say Amen on this
[1:00:52] one here pretty soon proverbs 31 here
[1:00:55] no pressure though of course
[1:00:58] 31.25 this is the portion on the
[1:01:01] Proverbs 31 Woman
[1:01:05] remember she has two things she always
[1:01:07] does she's good to her husband all the
[1:01:09] days of her of her life
[1:01:11] and second she has the fear of the Lord
[1:01:13] that's a Proverbs 31 Woman
[1:01:19] verse 25.
[1:01:22] well actually let's go to yeah 25.
[1:01:24] strength and honor are her clothing and
[1:01:26] she shall rejoice in time to come that's
[1:01:29] where is the Rejoice is the same one for
[1:01:31] dance
[1:01:34] now if you read this chapter this woman
[1:01:36] ain't busy dancing all the time she's up
[1:01:39] at night making sure the candle's on
[1:01:42] making sure the kids got food
[1:01:44] making sure everybody's got clothes on
[1:01:46] the church said
[1:01:48] she's making purchases she's making
[1:01:50] business deals she's sewing she's making
[1:01:52] food
[1:01:54] now remember it's interesting the Bible
[1:01:56] says women in the Bible most often women
[1:01:58] are dancing not men
[1:02:01] when it comes to this Proverbs 131 31
[1:02:04] Woman the Bible shows all that she does
[1:02:07] and the Bible says there's times here
[1:02:09] her rejoicing her dancing will be in the
[1:02:12] future
[1:02:14] because she's so busy now she don't got
[1:02:16] a lot of time to dance
[1:02:19] thought I'd get some amens on that one
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:25] her rejoicing is in the time to come
[1:02:29] because the Bible says there's no
[1:02:31] Greater Joy Hallelujah than to see your
[1:02:33] children walk in the truth amen
[1:02:37] so when these women these mothers
[1:02:39] finally see their children dancing or
[1:02:40] sorry yeah dancing too when they finally
[1:02:42] see their children praising God serving
[1:02:45] God with all their hearts it might cause
[1:02:47] her to dance a little bit and praise the
[1:02:49] Lord I cause her to glorify the Lord and
[1:02:51] sing God's Praises but her rejoicing is
[1:02:54] in time to come
[1:02:56] when she sees the fruits of all her
[1:02:58] labors
[1:02:59] she might be too tired to dance right
[1:03:01] now while she's putting the clothes
[1:03:03] together sewing the clothes or making
[1:03:04] the purchases or doing all these or
[1:03:06] staying up all night with the sick ones
[1:03:08] it's hard to dance when you guys throw
[1:03:09] up all over you
[1:03:11] I know because I caught throw up this
[1:03:12] week with my bare hands
[1:03:15] well thanks to a rag actually
[1:03:18] I had the rag in my bare hands and
[1:03:19] caught all of it it was like a I don't
[1:03:21] get too descriptive here but
[1:03:24] I'm gonna cause anybody to throw up in
[1:03:25] the surface not here I don't want to
[1:03:26] catch it again I guess
[1:03:28] but I know it's like and I didn't really
[1:03:30] feel like dancing in that moment
[1:03:32] just just like the mother the rejoicing
[1:03:35] wasn't a time to come there's a there's
[1:03:37] a season to mourn and there's a season
[1:03:39] to dance
[1:03:41] thank God but the reality is God's gonna
[1:03:44] make us Dance Again Hallelujah he's
[1:03:47] going to make us a Rejoice Hallelujah
[1:03:49] he's going to give us a reason to praise
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:52] Hallelujah I still got a reason to
[1:03:54] praise amen
[1:03:58] Glory
[1:04:02] so look at this mama
[1:04:04] this Mama's got to have a dance
[1:04:08] right there's no Greater Joy I want to
[1:04:09] bring that brother Branham told Marilyn
[1:04:11] Hickey thus saith the Lord You're gonna
[1:04:12] have a baby she had to wait 10 years for
[1:04:14] it
[1:04:15] think her her rejoicing was in time to
[1:04:17] come
[1:04:19] now of course she's a woman preacher we
[1:04:20] don't agree with women preachers but she
[1:04:22] honored the prophet of God and God
[1:04:23] blessed her right now she could have
[1:04:25] said no I don't believe that and when
[1:04:26] she had a baby I don't know it could
[1:04:28] have been a conditional promise
[1:04:30] but she waited 10 years
[1:04:32] now Church think about that are we how
[1:04:34] long have we waited for our promise
[1:04:36] let this be an encouragement let's go
[1:04:38] back to Abraham where there's 10 years
[1:04:40] or 25 years you're the children of
[1:04:42] Abraham praise God keep waiting on the
[1:04:44] Lord keep believing God you're rejoicing
[1:04:46] could be now or in time to come praise
[1:04:49] God I would say like this I'm rejoicing
[1:04:51] now and I'm gonna rejoice in time to
[1:04:52] come
[1:04:53] I ain't gonna let the devil steal my
[1:04:55] rejoicing
[1:04:56] I'm going to give God praise while I'm
[1:04:59] in the land of the living Hallelujah
[1:05:01] amen because I yield my vessel my body's
[1:05:04] not my own it's God's body Hallelujah
[1:05:08] so I glorify God in my body and my mind
[1:05:11] which are gods
[1:05:13] it ain't mine it's God's like I was
[1:05:15] praying before service out here like I
[1:05:16] normally do Lord just use my body
[1:05:18] tonight For Your Glory
[1:05:19] it ain't mine
[1:05:21] it's yours
[1:05:23] now Lord I don't know why you make a
[1:05:25] body like this
[1:05:26] ugly like this and forget I don't know
[1:05:27] why you'd make a bite like this but part
[1:05:29] of it's my fault
[1:05:31] all of us my fault forgive me Lord
[1:05:33] forgive me Jesus oh it's my fault praise
[1:05:35] God
[1:05:36] any wrong in me
[1:05:38] so look this woman
[1:05:41] her dancing will come later after all
[1:05:43] these years of toil
[1:05:45] all these years of Toyota
[1:05:49] think about that one of these days we're
[1:05:50] gonna see sister Beatrice dance around
[1:05:52] here
[1:05:55] where's he sister Naomi sister Kristen
[1:05:58] all you sisters
[1:06:00] we're gonna see all these mothers
[1:06:02] Hallelujah and all the mothers to me
[1:06:04] praise God where's they're all going to
[1:06:06] be dancing it's some time to come
[1:06:09] that's what the Bible says praise God
[1:06:12] some of our fathers need to dance to and
[1:06:15] thank God and praise God Look What the
[1:06:17] Lord Has Done amen
[1:06:19] hallelujah praise God
[1:06:23] like I told you I made that promise to
[1:06:24] God over there in that Sanctuary Lord I
[1:06:26] said let my children be filled with the
[1:06:28] Holy Ghost as proof before this other
[1:06:30] family that that we're going the right
[1:06:33] way and God's given me desire in my
[1:06:34] heart that's why I can dance around here
[1:06:36] and praise God that's why I can love the
[1:06:38] Lord praise God
[1:06:39] Hallelujah
[1:06:41] Look what Jesus has done praise God
[1:06:45] so Jesus specializes in changing our
[1:06:47] emotions
[1:06:49] bringing us out of these valleys
[1:06:52] bringing us out of our difficulties
[1:06:56] our seasons of slumps
[1:07:00] our winter seasons
[1:07:02] anybody ever anybody ever had a winter
[1:07:04] season
[1:07:06] check it out right there
[1:07:08] kind of nice if you like spring now
[1:07:10] though hallelujah it's gonna be 48
[1:07:12] tomorrow thank God so he gives us a
[1:07:15] little sign the Spring's coming
[1:07:16] Church your spring is coming amen amen
[1:07:19] hallelujah keep believing God's word
[1:07:21] keep trusting God you'll dance again
[1:07:23] Hallelujah amen
[1:07:28] but you'll dance again
[1:07:30] it might be in time to come but you'll
[1:07:31] dance again
[1:07:34] Jesus quoted these first two verses in
[1:07:36] Luke chapter four when he read the
[1:07:37] scroll the spirit Lord of God is upon me
[1:07:40] because he anointed me to preach Good
[1:07:41] Tidings under the meek what's annoying
[1:07:44] to me tonight is this Satan or is this
[1:07:45] Jesus
[1:07:46] he has sent me to bind of the
[1:07:47] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:07:50] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:07:51] to them that are around you don't have
[1:07:52] to be a prisoner to sin
[1:07:54] you can be free tonight in Jesus
[1:07:56] Christ's name
[1:07:58] I'm preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] tonight hallelujah oh it's done so much
[1:08:03] for me amen I cannot tell the law amen
[1:08:05] thank God Hallelujah
[1:08:08] to proclaim the acceptably the year of
[1:08:10] the Lord and Jesus stop right there
[1:08:12] because the next part is the Armageddon
[1:08:14] the day of Vengeance of our God
[1:08:16] to come for all that more now that's
[1:08:18] what we can have we can have comfort
[1:08:19] today
[1:08:21] you're gonna have comfort
[1:08:23] through all that more look at that oh
[1:08:25] look at that oh
[1:08:26] all but more
[1:08:29] to a point unto them that mourn in Zion
[1:08:31] to give unto them Beauty
[1:08:34] for ashes
[1:08:36] in the Bible Whenever there was bad news
[1:08:38] they would get in sackcloth and Ashes
[1:08:40] they would take off their their fancy
[1:08:42] clothes and they would put on sackcloth
[1:08:44] clothes and Ashes and just sit around in
[1:08:46] the ashes the outside matched the inside
[1:08:51] but Jesus Promised when the spirit of
[1:08:53] God comes I'm going to take away the
[1:08:55] ashes and I'm going to give I'm going to
[1:08:57] restore your beauty back
[1:08:59] because the spirit of the Lord is on me
[1:09:03] Hallelujah I'm going to give you the oil
[1:09:05] of Joy instead of mourning
[1:09:08] oil makes you shine right every night my
[1:09:10] wife puts on these oils wow her face is
[1:09:12] shining like a like a light bulb or like
[1:09:14] a son or something like that so I'm
[1:09:15] pretty like the sun I'd say like it
[1:09:18] something she puts on there though what
[1:09:19] is it it's not oil
[1:09:21] it's oil okay all right
[1:09:24] all right it's oil instead of morning
[1:09:27] right ashes all over your face
[1:09:29] sad disfigure faces Jesus is going to

[1:13:43] contact with God I'm asking God for
[1:13:46] something and he said you'll have it
[1:13:48] then praise God
[1:13:50] and she'd come back after Samuel's
[1:13:52] weaned and said praise the Lord and
[1:13:54] God's been so good to me I forget all
[1:13:55] the exact quotes she said it's in first
[1:13:57] Samuel chapter two you can read everyone
[1:13:58] she started praising God glorifying God
[1:14:01] hallelujah that's exactly what God does
[1:14:03] he gives us oil and takes away our
[1:14:05] mourning praise God
[1:14:08] oh we serve an awesome God

[1:16:09] God's word tonight
[1:16:11] from this time forth and all forevermore
[1:16:15] like I was praying last week God give us
[1:16:17] a 2023 where we can dance all over the
[1:16:19] church
[1:16:20] where we see prayers finally answered
[1:16:22] years of waiting years of crying now but
[1:16:25] now God's taking away our our garments
[1:16:27] of mourning and giving us garments of
[1:16:29] praise amen
[1:16:30] granted Jesus amen
[1:16:36] did I get to verse 4.
[1:16:40] nope verse three yeah here it is now
[1:16:43] here's a command church we want to be
[1:16:44] real children of God look at this verse
[1:16:46] 3 from the rising of the sun unto the
[1:16:48] going down of the shame the lord's name
[1:16:50] is to be praised that's why I put on
[1:16:51] instrumental music right away when I
[1:16:53] wake up in the morning I get the praise
[1:16:54] on sometimes I'll get on Joy in the
[1:16:56] hospital or right away in the morning
[1:16:57] you gotta think of Eden and virtue and
[1:16:59] nature shouting that song out yeah I
[1:17:01] think of them too or my girls hey Haven
[1:17:03] and Victoria shouting it out
[1:17:06] so now they just need that uplift I got
[1:17:07] to get it I got to get in the praise
[1:17:08] mode Hallelujah verse 4 the Lord is high
[1:17:11] above all nations and it's glory above
[1:17:14] the heavens
[1:17:15] who is liking the Lord Our God who dwelt
[1:17:17] on high look at this who humbled himself
[1:17:19] remember little Jehovah on Sunday who
[1:17:21] humbles himself to behold the things
[1:17:23] that are in heaven and earth God is so
[1:17:25] far above Earth but he humbles himself
[1:17:27] and he comes out and he shows you how
[1:17:29] much he cares about you
[1:17:31] that's humility
[1:17:33] God's so far above this he comes out and
[1:17:35] humbles himself and interacts with each
[1:17:37] of Our Lives
[1:17:40] see humility is a good thing right
[1:17:44] because God humbles himself
[1:17:46] verse 7 he raises up the poor Out of the
[1:17:49] Dust now that's what he did to my family
[1:17:51] now we weren't dirt poor but we were
[1:17:53] pretty poor
[1:17:54] look at my family now look at my
[1:17:55] brothers now look at my mom now like I
[1:17:57] showed you that testimony look at my mom
[1:17:59] now Look What the Lord Has Done praise

[1:18:07] need that money she would tell me like
[1:18:08] they got this testimony of somebody gave
[1:18:10] Simon uh some money
[1:18:13] and Simon tried to give it to my mom I
[1:18:14] was like I don't need that money because
[1:18:15] Look What the Lord Has Done
[1:18:18] and the church said I just have such an
[1:18:21] encouragement to me
[1:18:22] my mom's all alone and God God has been
[1:18:24] her husband praise God
[1:18:26] even in her condition
[1:18:28] he raised the poor Out of the Dust and
[1:18:30] lift the needy out of the dungeon I
[1:18:31] think about Joseph Joseph was in a pit
[1:18:34] maybe not dung in there but how much
[1:18:36] lower can you get than a pit and then
[1:18:38] Paul said I count all these things as
[1:18:40] dumb
[1:18:41] see we were in some of us were in
[1:18:43] denominations of dunghills
[1:18:46] and God brought us out of the dunghill
[1:18:49] ah thank God Amen thank God he didn't
[1:18:52] forget about me and leave me in the dung
[1:18:54] Hill of the Presbyterian Church
[1:18:57] or Assembly of God church thank God he
[1:18:59] didn't leave me the dung Hill he cleaned
[1:19:01] me off with amen he rushed off all the
[1:19:03] Dungy he took off that old garment and
[1:19:05] he gave me a new one

[1:19:17] leaves got some fruit praise God
[1:19:20] thank God
[1:19:22] sometimes I wonder why I'm so happy I
[1:19:24] guess it's the prince of the Lord
[1:19:25] I hear myself preaching my why is he
[1:19:27] laughing so much he must be the joy of
[1:19:29] the Lord
[1:19:30] the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:19:33] verse 8 that he may set him with princes
[1:19:35] even with the princes of his people is
[1:19:37] that what God did to Joseph
[1:19:39] he was in a pit and raised him up to be
[1:19:40] a prince
[1:19:42] Moses was out in the desert murder God
[1:19:45] raised him up to be a prince of his
[1:19:46] people
[1:19:50] he maketh the bear woman to keep house
[1:19:52] to be a joyful mother of children Praise
[1:19:55] You the Lord
[1:19:57] look God says praise praise praise he
[1:20:00] gives all these examples
[1:20:02] God always takes the opposite the bad
[1:20:05] and turns it into good praise God
[1:20:08] oh it's so beautiful is that what Mary
[1:20:11] said Mary said my soul magnifies the
[1:20:13] Lord my spirit hath rejoicing God my
[1:20:16] savior
[1:20:17] free is guarded the lowest state of his
[1:20:19] handmade look up in the Greek low means
[1:20:22] really really low like depressed and uh
[1:20:25] Mary was in a really low spot
[1:20:28] she was in she was a she was a teenage
[1:20:31] Jew
[1:20:32] you know just a low women were not very
[1:20:35] appreciating those days you know the
[1:20:37] Romans could have their wives and
[1:20:38] children killed at that in those days
[1:20:43] and when when God showed her she was
[1:20:45] going to bring forth the Christ child
[1:20:47] she changes from a low estate and now
[1:20:49] she's praising God magnifying God giving
[1:20:53] God all the glory ah let it be a picture
[1:20:55] of Our Lives Church oh that Christ could
[1:20:58] be born in our soul praise God
[1:21:01] let the word be born in you and me
[1:21:04] Church Hallelujah
[1:21:08] from for behold from henceforth all
[1:21:11] generations shall call me blessed all
[1:21:13] generations will say you're the bride
[1:21:14] out of laodicea
[1:21:16] you made it out of laodicea praise God
[1:21:18] and I'll say you made it out of fire
[1:21:19] terror how are that possible how did you
[1:21:22] make it out of Sardis Luther my goodness
[1:21:24] see each one will look at each other in
[1:21:26] admiration how did you look it out of
[1:21:28] there and each one will say by the blood
[1:21:29] of the Lamb and the word of Our
[1:21:31] Testimony
[1:21:33] I didn't make it by my might or by my
[1:21:34] power but by his Spirit saith the Lord
[1:21:38] I made it because the spirit of God was
[1:21:40] anointed me he took away my morning and
[1:21:43] gave me dancing
[1:21:48] the servant
[1:21:49] and he hath Lifted Me Up
[1:21:53] he that is mighty hath done to me great
[1:21:56] things
[1:21:57] holy is his name
[1:21:59] I was low but the great one condescended
[1:22:02] down to my level and Raised Me Up and
[1:22:04] has done great things to me how many can
[1:22:06] say Amen to that
[1:22:10] you know I was thinking about Austin Lee
[1:22:11] and Chris let's go to Luke 15 the last
[1:22:13] one
[1:22:14] Luke 15 25
[1:22:21] this was the last verse I found worth
[1:22:23] dancing in a good way there are some bad
[1:22:25] dancing in there in the scripture but I
[1:22:27] focus on the good ones
[1:22:32] this is a beautiful chapter if you want
[1:22:33] to read Jesus thoughts about saving
[1:22:35] Sinners that's a good chapter to read
[1:22:36] right here
[1:22:38] the Pharisees murmur in verses one and
[1:22:40] two this man sits with Sinners he eats
[1:22:44] with Sinners so Jesus tells a parable of
[1:22:46] the lost sheep they tell us the parable
[1:22:48] the Lost coin
[1:22:50] then he tells the parable of the lost
[1:22:52] son which this one is the prodigal
[1:22:58] now church one thing I want to bring out
[1:23:00] if you go to verse
[1:23:03] where is it
[1:23:05] verse 31 go to verse 31.
[1:23:07] this elder son
[1:23:09] was not a Pharisee
[1:23:12] this was a believer
[1:23:16] because look what 31 says read 31 Lydia
[1:23:25] the Pharisees didn't get all of Heaven
[1:23:27] they were children of Hell According To
[1:23:28] Jesus
[1:23:31] so in the parable the two sons these are
[1:23:33] both message believers
[1:23:37] but one message believer goes way out
[1:23:40] into the world right
[1:23:43] that's what the story is
[1:23:45] he disrespects his father so much he
[1:23:48] leaves the message
[1:23:50] right disrespects he goes to the spot
[1:23:52] where he's the lowest any Jew could go
[1:23:54] with a pig
[1:23:55] these pigs were unclean
[1:23:57] he went to the very depths of sin
[1:24:00] but finally at the very Rock Bottom the
[1:24:03] Bible said finally he came out of that
[1:24:05] lustful Spirit he came out of that that
[1:24:07] rebellious spirit and he came to himself
[1:24:10] see sometimes it takes the very lowest
[1:24:12] spot we can get to until we can finally
[1:24:14] get a victory
[1:24:16] if anybody needed a change of garments
[1:24:18] it was this guy
[1:24:20] this guy was sleeping with pigs I mean
[1:24:23] he's eating with pigs
[1:24:25] and he said I come to myself and said I
[1:24:28] know my father's house if I just ask and
[1:24:30] go back I know he'll make me a servant
[1:24:32] because my father loves me my father's
[1:24:34] full of grace
[1:24:37] and church the Bible said the father was
[1:24:39] waiting
[1:24:40] as soon as he saw him he said That's my
[1:24:42] boy
[1:24:43] and he ran out to meet him and he didn't
[1:24:46] care what he was dressing he wasn't
[1:24:48] looking at his natural garments he was
[1:24:50] looking at a spiritual garments praise
[1:24:52] God
[1:24:53] he's come back a repentant heart and he
[1:24:55] said go say the say the fighting calf
[1:24:58] give him a ring put some shoes on give
[1:25:00] him a change of clothes my son was dead
[1:25:02] and now he's alive and the Bible said
[1:25:04] pretty soon after that the old son came
[1:25:06] back and he come back the faithful son
[1:25:08] and he heard people dancing and praising
[1:25:10] God he says where's all this dancing
[1:25:12] because someone that was lost is found
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:17] see it makes us dance when people come
[1:25:19] back to the word of God hallelujah
[1:25:23] ah this is the last time I think here
[1:25:26] that I can preach here tonight this is
[1:25:29] the last time where we see dancing
[1:25:32] and it's when Souls return
[1:25:35] when people that have wandered away come
[1:25:37] back in real sincerity and weep their
[1:25:39] way and get right with God it makes the
[1:25:42] people Rejoice God help it to happen
[1:25:45] more to us praise God man let's stand to
[1:25:47] our feet
[1:25:52] and we Rejoice with uh Chris before he
[1:25:54] even got baptized we Rejoice musicians
[1:25:56] can come
[1:25:57] do you have a song in your heart with
[1:25:58] him
[1:26:01] I'ma stop right there
[1:26:05] Hallelujah
[1:26:08] how many thank God for the word of God
[1:26:09] tonight
[1:26:10] I preach my voice now I preach my heart
[1:26:12] out tonight
[1:26:13] I said Lord don't let it be me I said
[1:26:15] Lord you preached through me tonight
[1:26:17] I've tried to yield myself in every way
[1:26:19] I know how
[1:26:24] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:26:27] Hallelujah
[1:26:28] we all should want to say that
[1:26:31] Hallelujah
[1:26:34] and he's taken away by garments a
