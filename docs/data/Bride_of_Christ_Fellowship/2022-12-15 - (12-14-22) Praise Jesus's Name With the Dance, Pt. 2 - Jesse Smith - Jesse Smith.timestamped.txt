[0:00] the live stream okay
[0:02] praise God I want to apologize about the
[0:04] the heat the
[0:06] the inspectors came today or not the
[0:09] inspectors but the workers
[0:11] and they found out uh
[0:13] the Heat's been turned off so there was
[0:15] some miscommunication there's been a
[0:18] some type of miscommunication with
[0:20] dominion and then uh
[0:23] I didn't take it as far as I should have
[0:25] so it's I think it's partly on the
[0:27] technology end and it's partly on my end
[0:29] so I'm sorry about that so we have to
[0:31] open a brand new account and it's going
[0:33] to be open on Monday so we have to get
[0:34] through it one more weekend of cold but
[0:37] we'll probably have service at my house
[0:38] on Sunday my God's great because it's
[0:40] warmer there so
[0:42] um so I apologize that's my fault
[0:44] I call this summer to try to fix it and
[0:47] they didn't have an answer I was I
[0:48] contacted the landlord she didn't have
[0:50] an answer so I just let it go I should
[0:52] not have let it go so forgive me that's
[0:54] my fault that was six months ago but I
[0:57] just got shut off last week so I'm sorry
[0:59] that's my fault
[1:00] and hopefully we'll get it all fixed on
[1:03] Monday by God's grace so thank you for
[1:04] your patience
[1:06] and I trust you had a great time with
[1:08] brother Nathaniel there by God's grace
[1:09] and I don't know if you heard but he's
[1:11] going to be the new pastor at his home
[1:13] Church his dad has been the pastor of 47
[1:16] years
[1:17] um and so he is his dad is kind of
[1:20] retiring and going into the missionary
[1:22] field which is wonderful
[1:24] now brother Nathaniel is likely going to
[1:26] be voted in on January 1st so
[1:29] I probably won't invite him back too
[1:31] much you know because now he's got to
[1:32] Pastor a big church or they're a little
[1:34] I mean they're quite a bigger Church in
[1:35] our church you know
[1:37] perhaps in the future you know
[1:39] um
[1:40] so again you know that's that's a answer
[1:42] to prayer too you know so uh but Josh
[1:44] had a wonderful time in the Lord uh this
[1:46] weekend
[1:47] so let's take our Bibles here let's go
[1:49] to Psalm chapter
[1:50] 149 verse 3. I'd like to preach again on
[1:54] praise Jesus's name in the dance praise
[1:57] God
[2:08] Psalm 149 verse 3.
[2:18] and just so you're aware you know we're
[2:20] running two space heaters and um
[2:22] you know any time you know it could uh
[2:25] it could pop one of those where they
[2:26] call it when yeah it pops a fuse or yeah
[2:29] breaker yeah trips the breaker whatever
[2:31] they call it
[2:32] um so if that would happen you know we'd
[2:34] I probably sent Austin back there was
[2:35] amen back there you know and
[2:37] um Turned the breaker on again and then
[2:40] we probably have to turn it on low but
[2:41] so far it's been running good we've had
[2:43] it running for about an hour here
[2:44] try to get some heat in here
[2:47] um so you know just just so that may
[2:49] happen so we'll kind of see how that
[2:51] goes
[2:52] Psalm 149 verse 3.
[2:59] again it's nice to have Anthony here

[3:39] praise Jesus's name in the dance
[3:41] Hallelujah let's look let's read verse
[3:43] three together if we can here on three
[3:45] one two three let them praise His name
[3:48] in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto
[3:52] him with the timbrel and harp amen may
[3:55] God as blessing zarima's word you may be
[3:57] seated praise God we'll try to preach
[3:59] hopefully about an hour here and if and
[4:01] if you get too cold you'll feel free to
[4:02] move right over there you know then I
[4:05] just want to give the young children the
[4:06] first choice to sit closest to the
[4:08] space heaters because they have a hard
[4:10] time you know maybe handling being cold
[4:12] but most of us you know we had to work
[4:14] outside from Ohio where it used to being
[4:16] cold you know in the winter time and if
[4:19] you're just cold you know rub your hands
[4:20] together and just feel free to love the
[4:22] Lord here tonight we'll switch over I
[4:23] have a few quotes I'd like to share
[4:25] I'd like to preach again on Dancing you
[4:27] know we had a wonderful service last
[4:29] Wednesday night that was just a
[4:30] wonderful service I went back and
[4:31] listened to it again and of course I
[4:32] normally do that to kind of prepare
[4:34] oh
[4:35] and you know catch what the spirit was
[4:37] saying you know try to remember what the
[4:39] spirit was speaking to us
[4:41] and so I'd like to go a little bit
[4:43] further here with uh the scripture and
[4:46] I'm going to show a couple videos Lord
[4:48] winning if we get there
[4:49] I'm going to show a couple of videos uh
[4:51] from the internet so I'll be pulling you
[4:53] know from my data not the church data
[4:55] here
[4:57] uh and we'll just see how that goes by
[4:59] the grace of the Lord because I want to
[5:01] show you some real solid examples you
[5:03] know of what I think could be good
[5:04] dancing and what I think is maybe
[5:06] fleshly or sinful dancing of course we
[5:08] know most sinful dances right but but
[5:11] there's like a gray area in there and so
[5:13] I'm not saying I have all the answers
[5:14] but I just want to show you some
[5:16] examples what I think well this looks
[5:17] holy
[5:19] um and then maybe a couple moves that I
[5:21] think well I personally wouldn't do that
[5:22] move you know
[5:24] unless the Holy Spirit you know anointed
[5:26] me for that you know
[5:29] so God is good you know
[5:31] and we just want to have Liberty the
[5:34] Holy Spirit praise God because if Jesus
[5:36] has Set Me Free I am free indeed
[5:40] amen hallelujah I will not like I said
[5:42] last time last Wednesday I will not let
[5:44] Satan chain me up
[5:46] and make me a fearful
[5:48] sorrowful depressed Christian
[5:51] I'm going to overcome
[5:54] Hallelujah by the grace of God if at all
[5:56] possible I am not going to be a
[5:59] sorrowful sad complaining sour Christian
[6:04] Hallelujah I want to walk by faith I
[6:06] don't want to walk by sight
[6:09] and all of us if we're a Christian
[6:10] Church all of us have a reason to praise
[6:12] the Lord
[6:14] because that means we have faith in
[6:16] Jesus Christ and he has finished the
[6:18] work of Calvary Hallelujah it is not a
[6:21] partial finish work it is a finished
[6:23] work Hallelujah
[6:25] every sin's been paid for amen
[6:27] hallelujah every one of our deaths have
[6:29] been paid Hallelujah
[6:31] and Jesus as far as the Bible says
[6:33] doesn't hold any sin against us anymore
[6:36] praise God that's how I want to live
[6:38] praise God I want to live like the Old
[6:39] Testament where there was always a
[6:41] remembrance of sin always remembers
[6:43] because sin could not be fully confess
[6:46] or I'm sorry sin could not be fully paid
[6:48] for but in this one the Bible says sin
[6:51] is remitted it's sent away it's in the
[6:53] sea of forgetfulness praise God it is no
[6:56] more Hallelujah
[6:58] so we want to rejoice in that Hallelujah
[6:59] if anybody has a a reason to dance it's
[7:02] the Christian praise God hallelujah
[7:04] because we have eternal life and I just
[7:06] want to say God bless to jakora let's
[7:08] give him round flowers God bless you
[7:09] Jakari Hallelujah sir
[7:11] did your dad drop you off
[7:13] okay did he leave yeah okay yeah he's a
[7:16] busy man he's a pastor so he sure love
[7:18] you brother it's good to see you by
[7:19] God's grace hopefully we meet up next
[7:21] week before school and have another
[7:23] meeting there by the grace of the Lord
[7:25] so just you know a real Brief Review you
[7:27] know this was the the Hebrew definition
[7:28] of Dance
[7:30] that's that word kahul I'm not sure how
[7:32] to say it you know I'm not I'm not a
[7:34] Hebrew I don't know how to say it but I
[7:36] took the definition from here A
[7:38] Primitive root so this is a root word
[7:40] uh properly to twist or Twirl in a
[7:44] circular or spiral manner that is to
[7:46] dance of course then it gets into to
[7:48] writhe and pain you know that's not what
[7:50] a dance is a dance isn't painful but you
[7:53] know a Hebrew word can have many
[7:54] different definitions too just like the
[7:56] board right board room or Board of wood
[7:58] or a board of directors there's all I'm
[8:00] bored I'm tired I don't feel like paying
[8:02] attention hopefully that's not how you
[8:03] feel tonight praise God if it is I'm
[8:05] going to try to shake you up a little
[8:06] bit and wake you up here hopefully the
[8:08] music did that too
[8:10] but you know as I was saying last week
[8:12] you know when people dance you know if
[8:13] they spin and whirl or if they're
[8:15] dancing in a circle you know together
[8:16] like we did last week girls do you like
[8:18] that dance girls I appreciate that that
[8:20] was a great dance that's actually what
[8:21] the word means to go in a circular
[8:23] motion you know to dance and praise the
[8:25] Lord that's what it actually means
[8:28] and so that can be done as we saw that
[8:30] can be done uh by Believers uh it could
[8:33] also be done by Sinners right as we saw
[8:37] you know so last week we looked at lots
[8:39] of the scriptures so if you didn't see
[8:40] last Wednesday night's message I went
[8:42] through the majority of New Testament
[8:44] scriptures on Dance not all of them but
[8:46] the majority at the highlights now there
[8:49] was one I didn't get to which was a
[8:50] great one when the prodigal came home uh
[8:52] the Elder son coming from the field he's
[8:54] like I hear music and dancing so that's
[8:56] a good example of when you get saved you
[8:58] should give a dance to Jesus amen thank
[9:01] God Amen you know the dance praise God
[9:04] and when a brother comes home or sister
[9:06] comes home it's a cause for a dance
[9:07] Hallelujah so I'm gonna say this if
[9:09] Chris gets baptized on Saturday we're
[9:11] gonna have a dance time pretty soon
[9:12] praise God hallelujah because a son has
[9:16] come home
[9:17] Hallelujah he ordered he wandered so
[9:19] long far away from his father Hallelujah
[9:21] but he's coming home to Papa amen father
[9:25] God hallelujah amen thank God it's a
[9:28] reality church it's a reality Hallelujah
[9:30] when a sinner is Forgiven the Bible said
[9:34] he's from the he goes from the power of
[9:35] Darkness the power of Satan unto the
[9:38] power of God hallelujah he's changed
[9:40] kingdoms amen hallelujah he's no longer
[9:43] under the Dominion of Satan he's not
[9:45] bound addicted to Satan Satan's lusts
[9:48] and and Satan's sins but now he's free
[9:50] from Satan's power and now he's under
[9:53] the power of the Holy Spirit praise God
[9:54] to live a holy life amen thank God
[9:57] Hallelujah oh what a blessing praise God
[10:01] remember God's Prophet brother Branham
[10:03] he defined dancing as just as having
[10:06] Victory right Victory and then he we
[10:09] talked about two of his experiences one
[10:11] was dancing around a tree out in the
[10:13] wilderness in Canada another one was
[10:15] dancing at a New Year's Eve service
[10:16] praise God where he he just started
[10:18] tapping his foot and pretty soon before
[10:20] somehow he was out on I was he was out
[10:22] on the floor dancing with a little girl
[10:24] you know out there so
[10:26] um he just had to realize well you know
[10:28] wow they've got more Victory than I do
[10:30] praise God I need more victory in my
[10:32] life praise God
[10:33] so it's a beautiful stories there and
[10:36] great testimonies and I'll tell you that
[10:38] gave me a lot of Courage when I found
[10:39] out brother random dance I thought oh I
[10:41] can dance then because what are they
[10:42] going to say the Broadband was wrong
[10:43] when he danced he was right praise God
[10:46] because the Bible's right Hallelujah
[10:48] now see we found out though as we finish
[10:51] it's sin that takes away the dance
[10:54] right that was in the Lamentations
[10:57] you dance when you're happy you're
[10:59] dancing rejoicing but why aren't you why
[11:01] aren't you happy and rejoicing because
[11:03] you let sin in somewhere
[11:05] right Satan can't make you sin
[11:09] God would never make make you sin God
[11:11] doesn't even tempt us to sin we are
[11:13] drawn away by our own lust the Bible
[11:15] says
[11:17] and so our we let we let Satan in and
[11:20] that takes away our joy takes away our
[11:22] Victory and so it takes away our dance
[11:24] takes away our our shout like like the
[11:27] Bible says there should be a shout of
[11:29] the king in the camp there shall be a
[11:31] shout for Jesus in the church amen ah I
[11:35] didn't hear you praise God if not the
[11:38] power of God's gone in your life
[11:40] praise God
[11:42] so we we constantly need to examine
[11:44] ourselves when we lose the victory when
[11:46] we use lose the joy when we lose the
[11:48] rejoicing something's taken it away
[11:50] we've allowed the enemy to take it away
[11:53] so I'm going to focus a little more on
[11:54] that tonight by God's grace now God does
[11:57] allow us to go through seasons of
[11:58] mourning where it's okay if you don't
[12:00] feel joyful it's okay because you're
[12:01] being tested
[12:03] if we're going to have rewards in heaven
[12:05] we got to overcome something
[12:07] right we've got to be tested praise God
[12:09] if we want to have a testimony we got to
[12:11] go through a test first we got to pass a
[12:13] test Hallelujah
[12:15] but ever if God ever lets us go through
[12:17] a seasonal mourning he's letting us go
[12:19] through a season of sadness or Mourning
[12:21] or loss in other words to bring us out
[12:24] of it praise God so we'll know what it
[12:26] feels like praise God and we'll have a
[12:28] restored Life we'll have a restored mind
[12:30] we'll have a new vision praise God A New
[12:33] Perspective praise God we'll be more
[12:35] mature praise God well understand more
[12:37] about God we'll love God more praise God
[12:41] Hallelujah when God brings us out of
[12:43] difficult times and God brings us
[12:44] through and God brings us through the
[12:46] test and and God sees that uh that we're
[12:48] able to overcome he he rewards us praise
[12:52] God the Bible said God rewards them who
[12:54] diligently seek after him the reason
[12:56] people don't have more testimonies or
[12:58] more experiences with God they're too
[13:00] busy seeking worldly things if they
[13:02] sought God more that God would show up
[13:03] in their lives amen
[13:05] hallelujah it's so true
[13:08] for 19 years I was a ranked Sinner and I
[13:11] gave my life to Christ at 19 and since
[13:12] then I've seen nothing but blessings
[13:14] amen a pastor called me up and was
[13:16] asking about you know how I give to the
[13:18] poor overseas and everything I went and
[13:20] told him about all these Financial
[13:21] blessings we got he's like oh my
[13:22] goodness
[13:24] he said but I still can't he said I
[13:25] still can't give like you now that's
[13:27] fine
[13:28] but I said I was raised poor so that's
[13:29] why I give so much
[13:33] I was kind of hoping he'd do what I do
[13:34] but I can't expect everybody to be like
[13:36] me
[13:36] and you know not that there's anything
[13:38] wrong in what he said but I just you
[13:40] know
[13:41] God backs up his word
[13:43] that's one thing God said prove me
[13:46] now that's the only time I could see her
[13:48] right related that's the only time I
[13:50] could see God ever said prove me with
[13:51] finances that's the only thing he ever
[13:53] said prove me with your money he said
[13:55] and I'll pour open the windows of Heaven
[13:57] that's right amen
[14:00] test me with your money and don't watch
[14:02] if I don't open the windows of heaven
[14:04] and pour out blessings praise God now
[14:07] you're going to go through seasons of
[14:08] less of course you're going to be tested
[14:09] with money
[14:10] but hang on hold to God's unchanging
[14:13] hand if there's any hand you should hold
[14:15] on to it's the hand of Christ Hallelujah
[14:18] trust him amen trust him don't be a baby
[14:20] Christian like we said grow up and be a
[14:22] real son or daughter of God hallelujah
[14:28] they're those Faith muscles praise God
[14:31] Hallelujah take God at his word believe
[14:33] the promises right take those take those
[14:36] weights of tests and trials and say God
[14:38] is good God is faithful God said prove
[14:40] me I believe God either God is faithful
[14:43] praise God all things work together for
[14:45] good to them that love the Lord keep
[14:46] working those face muscles yeah it's
[14:48] going to hurt but tomorrow you're going
[14:50] to be stronger amen
[14:51] hallelujah amen make sure you eat a
[14:54] Godly diet too praise God
[14:56] amen
[14:58] it's exactly right
[15:02] remember we closed them by saying when
[15:04] we praise God with the dance We join all
[15:06] creation because right now the Earth is
[15:08] spinning in a dance
[15:10] Hallelujah
[15:12] right now all those little baby calves
[15:14] or all those baby uh those baby goats
[15:16] are out there dancing praising the Lord
[15:18] out there right we get we get chicks in
[15:20] we get chicks in our school every year
[15:21] and they name the chickens like you know
[15:24] Kentucky Fried Chicken or whatever they
[15:25] name them you know silly names but once
[15:27] they get their strength you ought to see
[15:29] them dance around they dance around too
[15:30] praise God puppies dancing around all
[15:33] creation dances and so because they're
[15:36] they're glorifying their creator and
[15:38] that's why we dance because we're
[15:39] glorifying Our Father hallelujah our
[15:42] heavenly father the creator of
[15:44] everything Hallelujah life amen it's
[15:47] exactly right
[15:49] everything he created that's what the
[15:50] Bible says all creation proves that God
[15:53] is the Creator and there'll be no
[15:55] excuses on the day of judgment because
[15:57] all he's got to do is look out there
[15:58] look at look at that plant in the backer
[16:00] look at your hands everything screams
[16:02] Creator Creator undeniable you can't
[16:05] make this we can't make that somebody
[16:07] made it it was God almighty praise God
[16:09] it was my dad amen
[16:11] it was your dad hallelujah amen thank
[16:14] God we ought to join our father in his
[16:17] creation Hallelujah
[16:19] thank the Lord
[16:20] now I want to just bring this quote I
[16:22] read this quote last week it took me
[16:24] about two minutes to fight it remember
[16:25] everybody was waiting for me thank you
[16:26] for waiting for me but I want to read
[16:28] the quote in the in the whole context of
[16:30] it the word itself is spirit so this is
[16:33] this is not spirit this is paper
[16:36] this is the word in paper form
[16:39] but this but the words on here are from
[16:42] the spirit that wrote it
[16:45] it's the spirit in word form and then
[16:48] you see when it's quickened or brought
[16:50] to life so in one of these verses it
[16:52] brought to life the spirit of God goes
[16:54] to work and acts
[16:57] right whether it's healing or salvation
[16:59] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Joy
[17:03] or patience Whatever Whenever one of
[17:05] these becomes real and it becomes alive
[17:07] God is now taking this and it's jumping
[17:09] off the pages and God is making this a
[17:12] reality praise God hallelujah
[17:17] he said now look here a thought has to
[17:19] be a thought before it become a word see
[17:21] from thought to word and then when it's
[17:23] a thought that's presented it's a word
[17:25] now this is God's thought that he has
[17:27] placed in the word and then when we
[17:29] receive it from him it becomes a word
[17:31] god revealed to Moses what to do Moses
[17:34] spoke it it happened
[17:35] that it stimulates it gives Joy because
[17:38] it's God's word
[17:40] I think I skipped the line sorry yeah
[17:42] when it really comes from God he said it
[17:43] stimulates it gives Joy because it's
[17:44] God's word and new wine the new wine
[17:46] simulates when it reveals the word then
[17:48] brings Joy beyond measure sometimes that
[17:52] it brings such a joy till you get over
[17:54] flooded
[17:57] God overflow my life
[18:00] Hallelujah that's what I need I don't
[18:01] need an overflow of depression I need an
[18:04] overflow of Joy Hallelujah thank God
[18:06] Hallelujah that we can have it
[18:08] Hallelujah
[18:09] any day of the week Hallelujah
[18:13] when God's joy comes on you sometimes
[18:15] when it becomes so real you get over
[18:17] flooded with it church that's why
[18:19] sometimes a dental service you'll see me
[18:21] cry like a baby I'm snotting out because
[18:23] I think how real this Bible is I think
[18:26] about how many times has God answered my
[18:28] prayer and I'm So Unworthy but yet he's
[18:31] so faithful praise God
[18:33] I just can't contain myself I get so
[18:35] overflooded sometimes hallelujah amen
[18:38] thank God
[18:42] like let me since we're in Psalms go to
[18:45] Psalms 1 18. I don't know if I share
[18:47] this with brother Chris yet
[18:49] but since he's going to be a new
[18:51] believer
[18:52] so brother Chris when I was in second
[18:54] grade I was eight years old my mom was
[18:55] dying of liver cancer it's still
[18:57] uncurable
[18:59] right she's in the hospital she has six
[19:01] kids and she's dying
[19:03] she's gonna live six she's gonna leave
[19:04] six kids Behind
[19:06] her friend woke up in the morning prayed
[19:09] opened her Bible and a voice said
[19:11] and it wasn't the radio
[19:14] it wasn't a phone call it was the voice
[19:16] of the Holy Spirit
[19:18] the holy spirit said go read Psalm 118
[19:20] verse 17 and go tell Ruby now Ruby's my
[19:23] mom
[19:24] but Chris you want to read that verse
[19:26] 17.
[19:32] my mom's dying she has six months to
[19:34] live
[19:35] that woman was weeping crying praise God
[19:38] Ruby's going to be made well the kids
[19:39] aren't going to be without a a mother
[19:43] she drove to the hospital walked in and
[19:45] told my mom my mom's sitting in the in
[19:47] the she got she got bruises all over her
[19:50] body because of the cancer purple
[19:52] bruises everywhere
[19:54] it looks like it's impossible
[19:56] Glory Hallelujah we know that in the
[19:58] story amen glory and she said Ruby the
[20:02] Holy Spirit told me Psalm 118 verse 17
[20:04] is your verse and she said I believe it
[20:08] I don't know how long it went but they
[20:09] were doctors said let's have some
[20:10] surgery we'll try to take some of the
[20:12] liver out the night before my dad while
[20:15] she was sleeping my dad went right to
[20:16] that spot on her liver I don't remember
[20:18] where it is
[20:19] and prayed for that and said I rebuked
[20:21] that liver in the I'm sorry rebuke that
[20:23] cancer in the name of Jesus Christ and
[20:25] he said he felt a hot sensation
[20:28] the next day they had cancer they opened
[20:30] my mom or outside the surgery they
[20:31] opened my mom up they couldn't find any
[20:33] cancer and she's never had remission
[20:38] now you tell me does that make that
[20:40] verse pop out to you or not amen my mama
[20:44] spent the rest of her life she's 72 now
[20:47] feeding the poor visiting the sick and
[20:50] God all that she lost in divorce God has
[20:52] paid it back a hundredfold amen
[20:54] hallelujah praise God I was thinking
[20:56] about that last week I had to pay her
[20:58] back from all that you know that I stole
[20:59] from her I thought God paid her back
[21:00] even more like I told you that testimony
[21:04] oh my God you can never outgive God Amen
[21:08] Hallelujah
[21:09] because God keeps receipts amen
[21:12] hallelujah and he's going to give
[21:13] interest as you wait on the Lord he'll
[21:16] renew your strength amen
[21:19] so see that's a sometimes you get so
[21:21] over flooded
[21:22] right you just rejoice and praise God
[21:24] the Bible becomes real
[21:27] so nobody can tell me the Bible doesn't
[21:28] work because it works praise God it
[21:30] might not work all the time because
[21:31] that's because God has different plans
[21:32] for every person every person's not the
[21:34] same
[21:35] everybody's got different battles they
[21:36] got to overcome my mom had to overcome
[21:38] cancer
[21:39] right she's got to overcome divorce
[21:41] praise God but different ones must have
[21:43] other battles to overcome who's got to
[21:45] overcome greed
[21:47] who's got to overcome murder
[21:49] so we're getting some serious ones there
[21:52] who's got to overcome and kidnapping or
[21:54] who's got to overcome all these things
[21:55] somebody's got to overcome it
[21:58] because God has to prove to the devil
[22:00] that God's children will love him no
[22:01] matter what because they know the love
[22:03] of Jesus Christ is a real and alive
[22:06] Hallelujah
[22:07] somebody's got to overcome it praise God
[22:09] needs a witness
[22:13] now I know there's a lot of fanaticism
[22:15] in people carrying on I know sometimes
[22:16] they do it when the music's jumping up
[22:18] and down and everything and I know that
[22:19] goes and I believe that too so everybody
[22:21] recognize that brother Rand believed in
[22:24] jumping around When the Music's going
[22:26] loud
[22:27] and the church said
[22:30] I've seen people in the day when as long
[22:31] as the music's playing everybody was
[22:33] jumping and screaming when the music
[22:34] stopped they stopped see I believe that
[22:35] well that's still all right as far as
[22:37] I'm concerned as long as people lives
[22:40] right
[22:42] but now you start bringing the word
[22:46] which is what I'm bringing right now
[22:48] right that's the thing that actually
[22:51] brings life is the word that brings the
[22:54] joy of simulation of new wine praise God
[22:58] in other words you and I should be the
[23:00] happiest as the word of God is being
[23:02] preached when it becomes a reality to us
[23:04] like when brother Nathaniel's preaching
[23:06] it's just it's right down your alley
[23:07] it's just what you need to hear or I'm
[23:09] preaching it's just what you wanted to
[23:11] hear just what you need to hear that
[23:13] ought to make us overflow that'll give
[23:15] us simulation it ought to give us
[23:16] courage for the next battle Hallelujah
[23:18] amen
[23:20] Hallelujah
[23:24] and that's what it was on Pentecost when
[23:26] the word was Vindicated
[23:29] God always backs up his word amen he's
[23:32] faithful
[23:34] now this is one of the main thoughts I
[23:36] had last week that I thought was
[23:37] inspired by the Holy Spirit
[23:39] what channel is clogged up in our lives
[23:41] if the preaching of the word is not
[23:43] giving us life
[23:45] if we can zone out of preaching or if we
[23:47] can just get tired of preaching
[23:48] something's been clogged up in our minds
[23:51] because the word is what brings life
[23:53] glory in Acts chapter 10 Peter preached
[23:56] a short sermon to Cornelius and the
[23:58] Bible said while Peter preached the word
[24:01] the Holy Ghost fell on them that hurt
[24:03] and praise God oh my
[24:07] that's what really brings life is when
[24:09] people hear the word of God and they
[24:11] receive it and they say Amen praise God
[24:13] that's a reality to me that's
[24:15] stimulating
[24:18] oh thank God Amen
[24:20] Hallelujah
[24:21] so see one of these channels is clogged
[24:23] up because in your soul is a holy thirst
[24:25] it's your decree more agency your thirst
[24:28] for God every soul thirst for God
[24:30] some people just hush it with drugs or
[24:32] hush it with pornography or hush it with
[24:35] sports
[24:36] see they want to see excitement and the
[24:38] Really the soul desires to see God doing
[24:40] something exciting but they hush it with
[24:42] an exciting sports event or something
[24:44] like that
[24:45] they say quiet now no don't thirst for
[24:47] god let's thirst for Steph Curry
[24:50] well let's thirst for uh Michael
[24:52] Jordan's old highlights or something
[24:53] like that
[24:55] which they're fine I mean they might be
[24:56] nice people but it's not eternal life
[24:58] they might give them millions of dollars
[25:00] to charity but that don't get you to
[25:01] heaven we'll get you to heaven is
[25:03] repenting of your sins praise God and
[25:05] changing your life and letting Christ be
[25:07] the ruler and king of your life
[25:09] Hallelujah that's what gets somebody to
[25:12] heaven
[25:13] but see which one of these now in your
[25:15] mind though this is your soul the
[25:16] deepest part of you in your mind though
[25:18] you've got a conscience right wrong
[25:19] memory we have all these memories
[25:21] reasonings reasons why you do things
[25:22] affections are your emotions and
[25:24] Imagination you have these five elements
[25:26] of your mind church and if if we're not
[25:29] careful these get clogged up we get
[25:31] castles or fortresses or strongholds
[25:34] like we gotta we got a memory against
[25:35] somebody that I just can't forgive them
[25:38] because of this memory and that will
[25:40] clog up the worship
[25:43] remember church we got people we got
[25:45] people I'm watching watching our
[25:47] services and they love our gusto
[25:52] the fact that we can just freely praise
[25:54] God you can just shoot your hands up her
[25:55] you can stand up and say amen and we can
[25:58] shout and praise the Lord people are
[26:00] inspired Hallelujah when your channels
[26:02] are open I'll say like this and help it
[26:04] opens up other channels for other people
[26:06] praise God ah in other words God uses
[26:10] you to bless other people so confess all
[26:13] your sin get all your sin out talk to
[26:15] God about it be an open Channel and
[26:17] somebody else's channels will be opened
[26:20] up praise God
[26:21] oh that really helped me when I got that
[26:22] email last week praise God he said I
[26:25] haven't seen a man worship like you
[26:28] I said well that's because the channels
[26:29] are cleaned out I can confess my sins
[26:32] right pray
[26:34] when I got when somebody has something
[26:35] against me I don't usually go talk to
[26:37] them I go talk to God about them first
[26:41] right
[26:42] I don't like confrontation yeah
[26:45] I don't like confrontation so much if
[26:47] someone if I know somebody's got
[26:48] something against me I'll go talk to
[26:49] somebody about it God that's what I'm
[26:51] going to talk to about it
[26:54] and God will often bring that scripture
[26:56] if you can't forgive them I can't
[26:58] forgive you
[26:59] Jesus said if you can't forgive somebody
[27:01] else I'm not going to forgive you
[27:03] well guess what I feel about this big
[27:04] then then I can praise God
[27:06] and then I can forgive them Hallelujah
[27:09] then I can live with what they've done
[27:11] for me and like that quote I showed
[27:12] brother Amen brother said if you can't
[27:14] take the knocks and all the
[27:15] discouragements he said you better go
[27:17] back to the cross and reaffirm your
[27:19] commission
[27:21] Hallelujah I praise God you need a fresh
[27:24] visit to Calvary Amen to see look at
[27:26] this one who died he did it innocently
[27:28] he did nothing wrong yet he still
[27:30] forgives we do wrong all the time so we
[27:33] should forgive Hallelujah
[27:35] because we do things wrong all the time
[27:37] Christ was bruised and punished and
[27:39] beaten and bloodied and he didn't
[27:41] deserve it we deserve it he took our
[27:43] place so God help us to have the
[27:45] righteousness of Christ help us to
[27:46] extend forgiveness like we want to be
[27:48] forgiven
[27:50] Hallelujah
[27:52] I say like this we need some open
[27:54] channels praise God
[27:57] let's open our imagination praise God
[27:59] let's open our emotions let's open up
[28:01] our reasoning let's open up our memory
[28:03] our conscious to the holy spirit so can
[28:05] we overflooded with it so he can be over
[28:08] flooded with it praise God and we can
[28:10] experience the joy of the Lord because
[28:12] there's one thing that brings Joy that's
[28:14] the word of God
[28:16] Hallelujah
[28:19] now think about this church when you
[28:20] were a sinner how could we be so freely
[28:22] given over to the devil to dance for him
[28:25] and now we're claiming to be serving the
[28:27] lord and not dance for the god of the
[28:29] universe the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:32] I told you I'm embarrassed I used to I
[28:34] didn't know about uh the message when I
[28:36] was in high school I went to the proms I
[28:38] went to homecomings I went to every
[28:40] dance and I wasn't comfortable but I
[28:42] went out there anyway to dance look like
[28:43] a fool
[28:45] serving Satan but when I came to Jesus
[28:47] that I was scared to lift my hand see
[28:49] how Satan
[28:50] Satan is just such a such a accuser of
[28:53] the Brethren he said oh you're going to
[28:55] be a fanatic if you raise your hand so I
[28:56] just start raising my hands like this
[28:57] and only when somebody else would raise
[28:59] their hands I wouldn't do it by myself
[29:01] right
[29:03] Hallelujah
[29:05] right but then the message comes and the
[29:07] Revelation oh my and I go to churches
[29:09] where it's actually welcome and people
[29:11] actually do that praise God
[29:13] and then the freedom slowly comes
[29:15] Hallelujah the chains are being broken
[29:18] amen hallelujah
[29:20] the chains are being broke up all the
[29:22] inhibitions are being let go of because
[29:25] I realize I'm not living for other
[29:27] people I don't care what other people
[29:29] think necessarily I care what God thinks
[29:31] about me and I know what God thinks
[29:33] about me he loves me amen glory amen he
[29:37] died for me he and my mama cancer he's
[29:39] healed my wife he's healed us he's
[29:41] faithful he's worthy of all praise amen
[29:45] Gloria
[29:47] so we should be completely yielded to
[29:49] Christ
[29:50] in all righteousness
[29:52] not just dancing Scream and Shout but
[29:54] also live a holy life tomorrow
[29:57] Hallelujah
[30:00] now I'm sorry the verses are kind of
[30:01] small but know ye not to whom don't you
[30:05] know that whom you yield yourself
[30:06] servants to obey his servants that ye
[30:09] are to whom you obey
[30:11] so when I would Chew Tobacco or smoke a
[30:12] cigarette or drink alcohol
[30:14] I was choosing to obey Satan
[30:18] whether sin unto death or of obedience
[30:20] unto unrighteousness but see when I
[30:23] choose to shun those things now become a
[30:25] servant to Christ
[30:26] Hallelujah
[30:28] it depends who I yield to it depends who
[30:30] I obey God help us to hear the voice of
[30:32] the Holy Spirit and Obey it tonight
[30:36] but God be thanked see we ought to thank
[30:38] God Amen that you were the Servants of
[30:40] sin but you have obeyed see this is all
[30:43] tied back to obedience amen it's all
[30:45] tied back to Hallelujah hearing the word
[30:47] of God and acting upon the word of God
[30:49] we cannot be hearers only we've got to
[30:51] be doers of the word of God
[30:53] Glory if you're hearing only and the
[30:56] word doesn't affect you something's
[30:58] wrong I went listen to the it is rising
[31:00] of the Sun that brother Adam preached I
[31:03] listened to it it was a blessing
[31:05] now what if I said I'm gonna listen to
[31:07] that and I didn't go listen to it then
[31:08] the word has no effect on me
[31:10] and the church said
[31:12] keep those amens coming okay
[31:15] keep saying Sikkim
[31:17] seek that devil Hallelujah
[31:20] see if I say well well that was a good
[31:22] sermon and I don't do nothing about it
[31:24] something's wrong with me
[31:26] that's the whole purpose of the sermon
[31:28] is to stir up action Hallelujah
[31:32] that's why I love it you know that's
[31:33] when I'll come up here you'll see me
[31:34] come up for a prayer usually when a
[31:35] guest preachers here you know
[31:36] I didn't Sunday because I've been on a
[31:38] victory where Lately by God's grace I've
[31:39] been had a lot of Victory lately
[31:41] Hallelujah I just thought about that but
[31:43] I'll come up here and say oh I haven't
[31:44] gone up early or I'm getting up too late
[31:46] and or I'm going to bed early enough
[31:49] I'm just mindlessly scrolling you know
[31:51] on my phone God forgive me
[31:54] yo but
[31:55] if I come up for prayer I've got to act
[31:57] on that tomorrow
[31:59] I've got to make sure that word isn't
[32:02] ineffective I don't want to hear it in
[32:04] vain I don't want to power this religion
[32:07] I want a religion that changes me praise
[32:09] God
[32:10] Glory
[32:12] after 23 years of serving Christ Church
[32:15] it gets sweeter as the days go by amen
[32:18] oh Hallelujah

[32:26] trustworthy ah he's even more faithful
[32:28] amen he's even more holy amen he's even
[32:31] more good than our thoughts Hallelujah
[32:33] and church somebody says he'll be
[32:35] telling us that through all eternity
[32:38] we'll see how much more glorious how
[32:40] much more holy how much a lot more
[32:42] loving God was all throughout eternity
[32:45] it'll never end because there's no end
[32:47] to our God Amen

[32:52] see you obeyed from the heart what that
[32:54] form of what is that a bad word no

[32:58] because you obeyed the doctrine the
[33:00] instruction the teaching that was given
[33:03] that was delivered to you
[33:05] that's how you become a servant to God
[33:06] you obey the word of God that's preached
[33:10] Hallelujah
[33:12] that's how you become more unit to God
[33:14] you have to obey what you hear now that
[33:17] doesn't mean you have to obey everything
[33:17] on day one
[33:20] you have to obey everything on day 365
[33:23] either
[33:24] praise God but you must be in that
[33:26] channel of Lord I want more of you I'm
[33:29] going to seek more of you I'm going to
[33:30] hear more of the word I want to be
[33:32] stimulated I want to overflow with this

[33:56] that I'm free from that now I'm a
[33:58] servant to holiness
[33:59] I speak after the man or men because of
[34:01] the infirmity of your flesh see how weak
[34:04] your our bodies are and the church said
[34:05] our bodies are just weak right
[34:08] you have you and your members servants
[34:10] to uncleanness and to iniquity
[34:12] uniniquity see we used to go from worse
[34:14] to worse
[34:15] I thought I'd get a louder one than that
[34:17] we went from worst to worse praise God
[34:20] we went from iniquity to more iniquity
[34:22] oh from something filthy to even more
[34:24] filthy I know I did even so now you'd
[34:27] remember servants unto righteousness
[34:29] unto Holiness become more holy more like
[34:32] Christ more loving the word more devoted
[34:34] to God more in love with Jesus

[35:09] Hallelujah

[35:16] the bank she went dancing Hallelujah yes

[35:21] that much
[35:22] did you ever cut that much Church

[36:17] you got to trust the Lord you got to
[36:19] seek God Amen ask seek and knock
[36:23] do those three praise God and you'll
[36:25] have this Hallelujah ask God for it seek

[36:33] I'm waiting Lord I hear send your spirit
[36:36] overflow me praise God over flood me
[36:38] praise God Amen Glory
[36:42] and yield yourself brother Adam says our
[36:44] spirit is clean it's fresh it's real
[36:46] it's sober and serious but not
[36:48] nonetheless it's full of the joy Lord so
[36:51] you can be sober and serious yet joyful
[36:55] serious and joyful at the same time yes
[37:00] the Christian ought to be just as
[37:02] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[37:04] the Lord as the world is when it Savers
[37:07] and delights in its pleasures
[37:11] Glory
[37:13] I'd be happy to compare my rejoicing
[37:16] last Wednesday to any football game
[37:18] anybody went to last fall
[37:20] because I danced right around this place
[37:22] praise God he had the children come up
[37:24] and dance
[37:25] I was so happy last week praise God I'm
[37:27] so happy this week
[37:29] well in other words I'm just saying I'm
[37:31] a just as exuberant about Jesus Christ
[37:34] as they are about Satan
[37:36] Hallelujah and I ought to be praise God
[37:39] and if not I'm either going through a
[37:40] season of mourning or I let sin in and
[37:43] God help us not to be the one where we
[37:44] let sin into our lives
[37:47] Hallelujah
[37:51] so that's what we I Savor uh times in
[37:54] the presence of the Lord I Delight in
[37:57] the presence of the Lord
[37:58] don't you love those Services where the
[38:00] power of God's moving and you don't feel
[38:02] like leaving the church don't you love
[38:03] those services
[38:05] God's dealing with somebody
[38:06] strengthening we're a rebuke and
[38:08] correcting help and answering prayer
[38:10] don't you love those type of things that
[38:11] should be our pleasure we should Delight
[38:14] in those Services more than anything
[38:15] else praise God
[38:17] Hallelujah
[38:19] both Christians in the world are human
[38:21] both have emotions the difference is
[38:23] Christians hearts and emotions are
[38:26] purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love
[38:28] while the world satisfies the flesh
[38:31] let me share this church sometimes I
[38:33] need a good laugh like some of these
[38:35] guys that do silly videos like we talk
[38:37] about something we show some of the
[38:38] silly videos but there there's got to be
[38:40] an end to that at some point
[38:43] right
[38:45] because I you know I can't give all my
[38:47] Laughing to silly YouTube videos
[38:50] I've got a laugh for Jesus
[38:53] Hallelujah you got to be careful we
[38:56] can't let our emotions go just to the
[38:58] world or things like you know just
[38:59] silliness
[39:00] we got to make sure we make sure stop
[39:02] that at some point and then yield all of
[39:05] our emotions to God
[39:07] right or get back on track yeah we have
[39:09] a little you know comic relief like
[39:11] there's these one guys that do these
[39:12] crazy like they just act like everything
[39:14] with slow motion or everything was fast
[39:16] forward you know cleaning the house fast
[39:17] forward it's funny it's hilarious but I
[39:20] gotta watch how much I get into that I
[39:22] can't get too much into that
[39:24] because then I'll take my mind off the
[39:26] Lord
[39:27] and then I'll train my emotions well you
[39:29] can only have a good time when you're
[39:31] going like you can only laugh when
[39:32] you're going like this
[39:36] see you become you become tied down to
[39:39] this where this is your Source this is
[39:41] not your source
[39:42] Jesus is your source
[39:44] he's my source praise God
[39:47] Hallelujah
[39:49] we got to make sure we got to put more
[39:51] of our emotions on the Lord
[39:55] we've got to put our emotions on the
[39:56] glory of God and his love
[39:59] but the world will always satisfy the
[40:02] flesh
[40:03] the world will always satisfy the flesh
[40:06] that's why you have to starve the flesh
[40:07] that's why you got to fast and that's
[40:09] why you got to give alms because your
[40:10] flesh wants to hold on to everything
[40:14] right your flesh wants to keep
[40:15] everything for you well make sure I got
[40:16] to take care of me no no God's gonna
[40:17] take care of you
[40:19] Hallelujah you're not responsible for
[40:21] yourself God's responsible for you
[40:24] that doesn't mean you give everything
[40:25] away like the Rich Young Ruler we went
[40:26] through that a couple
[40:27] months ago
[40:29] but it's all what God's calling you to
[40:31] do you have to find God's calling for
[40:33] your life praise God and then give your
[40:35] emotions to God give everything to God
[40:37] and have just as much joy in God as the
[40:40] world has in their things oh I'm so glad
[40:42] I can just rejoice in God I can be free
[40:44] in God we can love God we can just have
[40:47] such a sense of security praise God such
[40:49] a sense of Joy I live such a sense that
[40:52] God is with us he'll never leave us
[40:54] he'll never forsake us God Is With Us
[40:56] amen
[40:57] Hallelujah
[41:00] so help us may the Lord help us to make
[41:02] our hearts and emotions solely on the
[41:05] Lord
[41:06] that's what we got to get to of course
[41:08] while you're serving your family yes
[41:09] that counts as the Lord right because
[41:10] the lord gave you the family
[41:12] right lord gave your husband your wife
[41:13] your children father mother God gave you
[41:16] them
[41:17] now if they're not saved it makes it
[41:19] difficult but the Bible says give
[41:21] everything yield everything to God let
[41:23] give God your conscience give God your
[41:25] memories amen give God your reasoning
[41:28] and your affection your imagination give
[41:30] all that to God and watch God pour out
[41:31] blessings upon you
[41:33] it's exactly right that's where you turn
[41:35] yourself that's what you're made for
[41:37] let's not fight against the maker let's
[41:39] not fight against the system
[41:41] right
[41:43] if you put water in your your car it
[41:45] ain't car ain't going to go
[41:47] you're fighting against the system
[41:49] praise God like we heard on Sunday with
[41:51] a mechanics and Dynamics let's put
[41:53] gasoline in the car let's get the
[41:55] mechanics together and let's get the
[41:57] spark going amen
[41:58] let's go with the purpose the purpose of
[42:01] God the Bible says the kingdom of God is
[42:03] not in meat and drink but in peace and
[42:06] joy and loving the Holy Ghost amen
[42:08] that's what the kingdom of God is joy in
[42:11] the Holy Ghost praise God let me read
[42:13] that I think that's
[42:15] Romans 5 if I'm not mistaken I better
[42:18] look it up while I'm turning there
[42:22] the kingdom is not in meat and drink
[42:25] but joy Just Gotta Type in meat drink
[42:27] and joy
[42:30] ah it's Romans 14. it's a good thing I
[42:31] looked it up something's kind of said
[42:32] maybe it's not Romans
[42:34] 14s Romans 14 17. of course this is the
[42:37] chapter on Christian Liberties right
[42:38] like we looked at with Christmas and
[42:39] things like that any celebration
[42:43] you know her brother Ram say uh that
[42:45] Christmas is a cell I mean Easter is a
[42:46] celebration
[42:49] so people say oh you shouldn't celebrate
[42:50] Christmas you shouldn't celebrate Easter
[42:52] brother Brown said he was celebrating
[42:53] Easter
[42:54] right in other words he's worshiping at
[42:56] Easter time
[42:58] some people are just way too critical
[43:00] may God help us see church then that
[43:01] gives us compassion they've got a
[43:03] critical spirit so God help us to have a
[43:04] humble spirit
[43:07] if we get salty what are they going to
[43:08] get
[43:09] thirsty if they're sincere if they're
[43:11] thirsty
[43:12] I'm sorry yeah if we're we're salty
[43:14] they'll get thirsty if they're sincere
[43:15] if they really want to know God they'll
[43:17] get they'll get thirsty for sure
[43:19] Hallelujah
[43:22] I've seen the church I've won people
[43:23] over
[43:24] they've they've fought against me they
[43:26] haven't liked my side but pretty soon
[43:28] they come to the light
[43:30] that the word is Right praise God Amen
[43:35] thank God
[43:37] you're standing in the word of God
[43:39] so what is the kingdom of God brother

[43:59] gifts to my kids I'm not ashamed of that
[44:01] I'm not ashamed of seeing uh hymns about
[44:03] Jesus birth I'm not ashamed of that

[44:34] ones the only ones haven't sinned

[44:40] there verse 17 for the kingdom of God is
[44:43] Not meat and drink it's not these
[44:45] carnal things it's spiritual
[44:48] but the kingdom of God is righteousness
[44:50] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost
[44:55] Kingdom means Dominion
[44:57] everybody say Dominion right that means
[44:59] rule
[45:01] the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost ruling
[45:03] you through those things righteousness
[45:05] joy and peace how many peace in their
[45:07] life

[45:21] Dominion the Holy Ghost is trying to
[45:23] rule your life the Holy Ghost is trying
[45:24] to rule my life not with meat and drink
[45:26] so much but with righteousness peace and
[45:29] joy of the Lord
[45:31] did you hear on when we were closing on
[45:33] Sunday night we sang joy in the house of
[45:34] the Lord and brother Nathaniel's going
[45:36] whoa
[45:37] whoa
[45:38] whoa did you hear that I was like I'm
[45:39] about ready because I was dancing up
[45:41] here praise God but I was really tired
[45:43] so I didn't answer out I was kind of
[45:44] tired
[45:45] I knew I'd probably do it tonight
[45:47] Hallelujah
[45:49] there's something about that church you
[45:51] start talking about George I'm about God
[45:52] talking about how good he's been to you
[45:54] something inside he has to respond and
[45:56] say yes that's right I will praise the
[45:58] Lord amen
[46:01] he's been so good to me
[46:04] let's not satisfy the flesh let's
[46:06] satisfy the spirit of God
[46:10] now this is I it's been a while since I
[46:13] read this we're not going to read all of
[46:14] it but Hezekiah said this prayer after
[46:17] he got healed remember Isaiah said thus
[46:19] saith the Lord set your house in order
[46:21] you shall die he walked out the Lord
[46:23] said no well she says no he said thus
[46:25] saith the Lord go tell him he's got 15
[46:26] more years
[46:28] so he said be outside of verse 17 behold
[46:30] for peace I had great bitterness so see
[46:33] when he heard that when he heard that uh
[46:35] word of Lord he's going to die he was
[46:36] bitter but thou Hast in love to my soul
[46:40] delivered it from the pit of corruption
[46:43] for thou has cast all my sins behind thy
[46:48] back
[46:48] that means God's not God's not staring
[46:50] at your sins well Jesse did that amen
[46:52] did that Austin did that bang did that
[46:54] Malachi use all the brothers Chris did
[46:56] that you know it's not right in front of
[46:58] him oh I know he's I'm so upset with him
[47:00] but God is gracious and God put all
[47:02] those behind his back
[47:04] Hallelujah amen that means God don't
[47:08] look at my he's not looking at my sins
[47:09] he's looking at my seed he's looking at
[47:11] my soul he's looking at my very inner
[47:14] depths of me he's looking at my genetic
[47:15] makeup my spiritual Gene the seed word
[47:18] of God Amen
[47:22] for the grave cannot praise you look
[47:24] what he's here now we know why he's
[47:25] crying out to God he says if I die I
[47:28] can't praise you
[47:30] sound like this man like to praise
[47:33] Hallelujah
[47:34] death cannot celebrate thee
[47:38] they either go down the pit cannot hope
[47:40] for thy truth
[47:41] now of course that was in the Old
[47:42] Testament now the New Testament there's
[47:44] victory over there praise God
[47:46] Hallelujah the living the living He
[47:50] Shall praise thee as I do this day the
[47:53] father to the children shall make known
[47:55] thy truth
[47:56] in other words I'm going to make sure
[47:57] before I die I teach my children the
[47:59] truth
[48:00] Hallelujah
[48:02] and I'm going to praise God while I got
[48:05] a life here well I got breath here it's
[48:07] my time to praise God hallelujah amen
[48:11] thank God
[48:14] the Lord was ready to save me Church
[48:15] he's ready to save you too
[48:17] from sins
[48:19] from addictions whatever it is the Lord
[48:22] is ready praise God
[48:23] in his time and season praise God
[48:26] he's ready to save now like the Bible
[48:28] said that song says he's mighty to save
[48:30] praise God
[48:31] the mighty conqueror the Mighty God the
[48:33] Everlasting father
[48:34] therefore because he's ready to save me
[48:37] look at this we'll sing my songs to the
[48:39] string instruments all the days of our
[48:41] life in the house of the Lord I wonder
[48:43] how look he's going he's got the same
[48:45] heart as Hannah
[48:47] said if you give me this son I'll give
[48:50] him back to you
[48:51] that meant
[48:53] over
[48:54] in other words the rest of my life I'll
[48:56] live without him because you gave me one
[48:59] look at that
[49:00] he says the same thing if you heal me
[49:02] I'll praise you the rest of my life amen
[49:05] ah in other words you got 15 years of
[49:08] song and joy and praising the Lord you
[49:10] got 15 years of Celebration and worship
[49:12] coming Lord if you touch me I'll get
[49:14] about that I'll give that to you let me
[49:17] Praise You In the land of the living
[49:19] praise God
[49:20] Hallelujah
[49:25] look at that vowel so just like Hannah
[49:27] now we see Hezekiah made a vow to God
[49:29] too if you do this I will praise you
[49:32] I'll celebrate you all the days of my
[49:34] life
[49:37] and church even without a vow we ought
[49:38] to do that for God praise God
[49:40] because like I said he's worthy of it
[49:43] if we could just you know program said
[49:44] that other people have said it if we if
[49:46] we even got a glimpse of the reality of
[49:47] hell it would scare us so much we would
[49:49] we would just you know be even even more
[49:52] sincere
[49:53] even more sincere if we had a vision of
[49:56] it or experience it or something like
[49:57] that
[49:59] now the church the Reason God don't have
[50:00] to do that to us because he knows we're
[50:01] already going to fear Him we've got the
[50:03] fear of the Lord there it is amen thank
[50:06] God
[50:07] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[50:09] wisdom Hallelujah
[50:11] the people that don't fear the lord
[50:12] sometimes they need dreams of hell
[50:14] right
[50:16] they need dreams about dying going to
[50:18] hell I had somebody tell me that this
[50:19] week they had a dream about going to
[50:21] hell I forget who I forget who it was
[50:23] somebody told me that I dream about that
[50:26] I said you know what to do that
[50:28] oh yes a brother emailed me from
[50:30] overseas
[50:31] you had a dream he went to hell I said
[50:33] brother I said you better first confess
[50:35] your sins
[50:37] right go make everything right anyone
[50:39] you know wrong make it right I said
[50:41] don't wait till tomorrow do it today
[50:43] because God could be warning you
[50:46] do it now
[50:47] don't put it off
[50:50] I said because I don't know I'm not God
[50:51] but why would God give such a powerful
[50:54] dream like that such a warning
[50:56] because there's probably something late
[50:58] in his life
[50:59] but seizures that's God's mercy too
[51:02] look how merciful god is before a
[51:04] judgment or before something God always
[51:05] sends Mercy
[51:07] always sends Mercy Hallelujah
[51:10] thank God for his Mercy
[51:13] so Church remember if you want to answer
[51:15] to prayer if you want something be sure
[51:16] to give God praise if you get it
[51:18] Hallelujah like those 10 lepers make
[51:20] sure you're the one that comes back amen
[51:23] thank God Amen Lord I'm not going to be
[51:26] silent I'm not going to forget to give
[51:28] you praise I will worship your name I
[51:30] will sing the praise of Jesus I will
[51:32] tell others about Jesus I'll magnify
[51:34] Christ all the days of my life praise
[51:36] God Amen
[51:41] now I'm gonna read a quote here now when
[51:43] they got down to Jordan time to cross
[51:44] over he made the way
[51:46] speaking of
[51:47] uh
[51:49] this is Elijah and Elisha
[51:53] the stage of the Holy Ghost Church said
[51:55] now I want to ask you something so what
[51:57] do you want that's what Elijah said and
[51:59] Elijah said a double portion of your
[52:01] spirit come upon me that's the way to
[52:02] ask for it don't be scared ask for the
[52:05] whole lot Jesus said you have not
[52:07] because you ask not ask not because you
[52:09] believe not ask abundantly that your
[52:10] Joys might be full ask a whole lot God
[52:13] just don't make me a little bit better
[52:14] make me all the way well
[52:17] Hallelujah
[52:18] amen don't just let me have enough

[56:22] thinks just kill me out that's what we

[56:26] that right many of us was like the
[56:28] school of prophets stand over on the
[56:30] other side of the Hill looking off Let's
[56:31] cross the river tonight
[56:34] oh Hallelujah
[56:37] that's easy to preach that's easy to say
[56:39] Amen to now how many of us really want
[56:41] that though that's the way it really
[56:42] meets the that's where the rubber meets
[56:44] the road like the brother said
[56:46] what word are we going to take and let
[56:48] it Quicken us
[56:50] and Inspire us like we heard and put a
[56:52] spark to the mechanics and Dynamics
[56:55] something something has to move us
[56:57] praise God
[56:58] Hallelujah
[57:00] it takes an action
[57:02] so this is a different sermon this is
[57:04] one of the most beautiful sermons
[57:05] remember I preached on the soul this has
[57:06] I got so many Revelations out of this
[57:08] sermon this was an unbelievable sermon
[57:09] it totally changed my whole outlook on
[57:11] the soul
[57:12] but man they're singing at the end
[57:14] brother man says when they crown him
[57:16] Lord of all
[57:18] oh when they crown him Lord of all oh
[57:22] Lord I want to be in that number when
[57:27] the sun refused to shine but remember
[57:30] says do you love that now I wonder if
[57:32] you got your feet converted you don't
[57:33] dance anymore out there for the world
[57:35] see let's Pat our feet to the Lord
[57:37] to the Lord
[57:40] brother says when you're a sinner you
[57:42] dance for the devil but when you become
[57:44] a Christian you start using your feet
[57:45] for Jesus hallelujah oh thank you Jesus
[57:48] ah now we don't have a lot of room in
[57:49] here to dance so we can just go back and
[57:50] forth hallelujah thank you Lord thank
[57:52] you Jesus glory amen did your feet get
[57:55] saved or not praise God
[57:58] now your feet really didn't but your
[57:59] soul says feet I command my feet to
[58:01] praise the Lord amen thank God Amen yes
[58:05] as your hands can burn you don't steal
[58:07] any more that's what I was guilty of I
[58:08] stole so many things
[58:10] from Walmart you name it all kinds of
[58:11] places
[58:13] but see when I got converted I don't
[58:15] steal anymore now I clap my hands
[58:18] now I take these hands everyone's dirty
[58:20] now they're clean now I give to the
[58:22] people
[58:23] now I give to others when I used to
[58:25] steal from others
[58:26] he changed my life
[58:29] he wants to change yours too
[58:33] your lips are converted you don't lie
[58:36] anymore
[58:37] just don't get religion in your head
[58:39] Saints get it all over you
[58:44] that's it it takes the whole man that's
[58:45] right now let's Pat our feet and they
[58:47] sing a different song they sing that
[58:49] again
[58:50] Steve church this is a reality
[58:52] if you get saved if something starts
[58:54] happening here it's got to work its way
[58:56] out to the outside
[58:58] it's got to work its way out because
[59:00] something has changed on the inside
[59:03] Hallelujah and the only way it doesn't
[59:05] is if something gets clogged up up here
[59:08] well I'm imagining they're going to say
[59:10] that and I can't the reason I can't do
[59:12] that is because of that
[59:14] and I remember when the brothers of that
[59:16] or sister said that so I can't praise
[59:17] God like I want to let clean it out
[59:19] Church let's clean it out praise God
[59:20] bend it out
[59:22] God's if Jesus died like that he's
[59:25] worthy of all of our praise
[59:27] Hallelujah
[59:29] I didn't I'm not really getting far like
[59:31] I thought I'd get tonight praise God
[59:33] anyhow now this is the entry from the
[59:35] Bible dictionary I thought you'd like it
[59:36] uh
[59:37] now here's all the verses on dancing and
[59:40] it says the translation of whole in the
[59:42] Hebrew which points to the word whirling
[59:44] motion of Oriental sacred dances it's
[59:46] the rendering of a word which means to
[59:48] skip or leap for joy
[59:50] so skip
[59:51] right skip
[59:54] is this skipping or Galloping is that oh
[59:56] no that's right this is Skipper I'm
[59:58] trying to go back to my Elementary uh PE
[1:00:00] classes okay now this is skipping
[1:00:02] and this is gallop
[1:00:07] foreign so you can skip all over the
[1:00:10] church and praise the Lord
[1:00:12] Hallelujah or you can leave for joy
[1:00:16] the Bible commands us to do it amen
[1:00:20] let them praise His name in the dance
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] hallelujah thank God
[1:00:28] that talks about New Testament uh also
[1:00:30] means like a circular motion that's when
[1:00:32] the The Prodigal came home they were
[1:00:34] leaping and dancing
[1:00:36] uh
[1:00:38] it's symbolic of rejoicing we know that
[1:00:41] they had sacred dances of joint
[1:00:43] Thanksgiving and the performers were
[1:00:45] usually female so usually the dancers
[1:00:46] were females
[1:00:48] because the Bible never said Moses dance
[1:00:50] Miriam led the sisters out and danced
[1:00:54] so I'm one of those rare types like
[1:00:56] David I guess
[1:00:58] that's fine Hallelujah I want to be a
[1:01:01] man after God's Own heart anyway
[1:01:02] Hallelujah now every all the most men
[1:01:05] like to dance too if they're really
[1:01:06] Christian they love the Lord
[1:01:08] the ancient dance was very different
[1:01:09] from the common Western Nations isn't
[1:01:12] that the truth I actually got a couple
[1:01:13] amens on that one here
[1:01:15] the western dance American dance
[1:01:17] which is hell hell dance right dances
[1:01:21] from the pits of Hell demon dances
[1:01:23] it was usually the part of the women
[1:01:25] only
[1:01:27] and then talks about David again and we
[1:01:29] went through that last week now here's
[1:01:31] the thing I like this is like what
[1:01:32] brother William told me uh the male and
[1:01:33] female among the Jews always dance
[1:01:35] separately
[1:01:37] and that's good so that men aren't
[1:01:38] tempted right
[1:01:40] because that's what men have to battle
[1:01:41] that
[1:01:42] all right now there's three kinds of
[1:01:44] Hebrew dancing
[1:01:46] the horror I'm not probably not saying
[1:01:48] these right courses from Wikipedia but
[1:01:49] they have references I know most
[1:01:51] Wikipedia you can't trust it you can't
[1:01:52] trust hardly most anything
[1:01:54] right the Britannica says Constantine
[1:01:56] was a good guy he was a rascal
[1:01:59] right I mean who are you going to trust
[1:02:00] I mean you're gonna trust MSNBC
[1:02:02] you're gonna trust Fox News come on
[1:02:05] yeah you're gonna just see it yeah right
[1:02:07] exactly right that's why we're all
[1:02:09] laughing they just lie to us oh covet oh
[1:02:12] mascara and protect you three months
[1:02:13] later Mass don't help you
[1:02:16] it's just ridiculous
[1:02:18] it's all propaganda to get you to give
[1:02:21] up your rights
[1:02:22] right because they want to lay down the
[1:02:24] mark of the beast worldwide that's what
[1:02:25] they want to do but there's first a
[1:02:27] circle dance that's kind of what we did
[1:02:28] last week girls Circle dance
[1:02:33] the second one is just hopping in place
[1:02:35] so praise the Lord that little hops that
[1:02:36] they do hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:02:39] that but then there's a spontaneous
[1:02:41] that's my definition I just call it
[1:02:42] spontaneous because we don't know what
[1:02:44] David was doing but whatever he did
[1:02:46] church he did it with all of his might
[1:02:49] Hallelujah
[1:02:51] and he wasn't doing it to glorify
[1:02:53] himself like oh let's have a dance let's
[1:02:56] have a dance off let's have a dance
[1:02:57] competition that wasn't what David was
[1:02:59] doing
[1:03:00] the Bible said he was before the Lord
[1:03:02] thank you that the prince of God is
[1:03:04] returning to its rightful place oh
[1:03:06] church when the god when we get another
[1:03:08] Revival in here praise God the prince of
[1:03:10] God coming back to this place we should
[1:03:12] be dancing all around praise God
[1:03:14] Hallelujah because the prince of God is
[1:03:17] coming back to the people it's right
[1:03:19] back in his position he's going to say
[1:03:21] like this this is where the prince of
[1:03:23] God should be amen
[1:03:25] hallelujah amen
[1:03:28] so Dave when he saw it coming back oh
[1:03:31] hallelujah we're in Melchizedek City
[1:03:33] amen this is where Melchizedek came this
[1:03:35] is where God visited and now the prince
[1:03:37] of God is back we're back to the days
[1:03:39] where God would speak to man we're going
[1:03:42] to hear from God and so long you're
[1:03:43] hearing deadness or science but we get
[1:03:47] to hear the voice of God
[1:03:49] that'll make a man dance
[1:03:51] Hallelujah
[1:03:53] when he hears the voice of God it makes
[1:03:56] a man or woman dance Hallelujah
[1:03:59] thank you Jesus
[1:04:03] it's already been an hour so bear with
[1:04:05] me
[1:04:06] let me see how much I got left I might
[1:04:07] have to hold this off here in the next
[1:04:08] week
[1:04:09] I still got to work tomorrow
[1:04:12] oh boy I gotta hold on here one two
[1:04:15] three four
[1:04:16] five six seven eight
[1:04:22] okay bye-bye
[1:04:23] 18 here let me uh
[1:04:27] I'll close with this little section here
[1:04:28] just just a simple section we'll close
[1:04:30] with this and then I'll pick up again
[1:04:31] Lord buddy oh that's right I want to
[1:04:32] show you those videos too okay I forgot
[1:04:34] about that all right uh
[1:04:37] yeah I'll go through this section and
[1:04:39] I'll show the videos okay by God's grace
[1:04:41] we'll turn that off on the YouTube
[1:04:42] because they're probably gonna strike me
[1:04:43] for using somebody else's videos and
[1:04:45] then we'll be off YouTube for 90 days or
[1:04:47] something like that ridiculous I'm not
[1:04:49] trying to make money off of these people
[1:04:50] are ridiculous dancing's Place among the
[1:04:53] Holy Ghost Field Saints praise God now
[1:04:54] remember uh
[1:04:56] let's remember the the evidence of the
[1:04:58] Holy Ghost is not dancing
[1:05:01] I've seen lots of people dance like I
[1:05:03] said last week I've seen a brother he
[1:05:04] ran around a message Church like a
[1:05:06] cheetah
[1:05:09] a couple years later he don't even
[1:05:11] believe the message anymore
[1:05:12] he was actually raised Amish he come he
[1:05:15] came out of the Amish community that's
[1:05:16] really something
[1:05:18] they were so locked up but he found so
[1:05:20] much freedom in The Messengers he would
[1:05:21] run around the church I could just see
[1:05:23] him right now he's running around here
[1:05:24] hallelujah he'd have his hands up praise
[1:05:27] the Lord I'm trying not to trip over
[1:05:28] these he's running around I mean he'd go
[1:05:30] around and around and around I thought
[1:05:32] this guy's really on fire praise God
[1:05:33] hallelujah
[1:05:35] but then he married a nominational woman
[1:05:38] now there's nothing wrong with that if
[1:05:39] God's leading it but the woman Drew him
[1:05:42] away from the message
[1:05:43] that's how you know you married the
[1:05:44] wrong person
[1:05:45] right if they lead you away from the
[1:05:47] word of God but if God leads you in that
[1:05:49] you're trying to save somebody now
[1:05:51] that's different praise God hallelujah
[1:05:53] thank God
[1:05:55] so dancing is not the evidence
[1:05:58] Norris tongues
[1:06:00] Norris Miracles nor is my mom being
[1:06:03] healed of cancer
[1:06:05] be in here to cancer is not the evidence
[1:06:07] of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is what
[1:06:10] Jesus said it's power to be a witness
[1:06:13] amen and he said when you receive that
[1:06:16] it'll guide you into all truth amen
[1:06:19] Hallelujah it will remind you of
[1:06:23] Everything Jesus said and it will show
[1:06:25] you things that are to come amen
[1:06:27] Hallelujah
[1:06:31] I just want to show that balance on that
[1:06:33] how many times did Paul write about
[1:06:34] dancing I can't find one
[1:06:37] I can't find one
[1:06:39] if I'm not mistaken
[1:06:41] yet he was a holy ghost film man
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:46] so we got to be careful I don't want to
[1:06:48] over emphasize dancing but also I don't
[1:06:50] want you to have channels that are
[1:06:52] clogged up
[1:06:54] Hallelujah
[1:06:56] like those Miserable quotes that's why I
[1:06:58] brought those out God did not save you
[1:07:00] for you to be miserable
[1:07:01] God save you to be light
[1:07:04] Hallelujah God didn't save you to be
[1:07:06] Darkness God save you to be light
[1:07:09] God didn't save you
[1:07:12] to be lacking salt God made you to be
[1:07:15] real salt to have Savor God didn't make
[1:07:18] you to be plain and Bland God made you
[1:07:20] to have saver so the people can see
[1:07:22] something different about you
[1:07:24] Hallelujah we know if you are going to
[1:07:26] be saved don't expect brother Chris I
[1:07:28] expect ever to be saved when I come in
[1:07:29] this message boy was I wrong
[1:07:31] but one thing I knew I was saved
[1:07:34] and they don't want to be saying they
[1:07:36] don't have to but I know I got saved
[1:07:38] hallelujah amen the old Jesse Dunn and I
[1:07:42] knew Jesse was raised up Hallelujah
[1:07:44] I've never been the same Hallelujah
[1:07:48] Glory thank you Jesus
[1:07:51] so I knew as long as it happened to me
[1:07:52] as long as I got the experience I know
[1:07:54] it's real Hallelujah
[1:07:56] has never failed to keep me walking for
[1:08:00] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:01] this power of salvation
[1:08:04] so we want a real experience with God
[1:08:06] Hallelujah
[1:08:08] but the RAM said jump as high as you can
[1:08:10] live right
[1:08:12] however high if you can if you can live
[1:08:14] over smoking
[1:08:15] I jump this high
[1:08:17] right if I can live over over dirty
[1:08:19] magazines I could jump that high right
[1:08:21] if I can live over gossip in life then I
[1:08:24] can jump real high praise God
[1:08:26] Hallelujah tell the kids like that
[1:08:29] I'm just like David you just give God
[1:08:31] all your might
[1:08:33] only jump as high as you live
[1:08:36] Hallelujah
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] some of these preachers out there dance
[1:08:42] or they dance around and Shout around
[1:08:43] and they find out they're living sinful
[1:08:45] in their private lives shame on them
[1:08:47] they were jumping higher than what they
[1:08:49] lived
[1:08:50] only jump as high as you live
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:55] the trouble is they don't yield all
[1:08:56] their courts
[1:08:59] right they don't yield their soul their
[1:09:01] Spirit or their body all the way they've
[1:09:03] got to yield all the way to the Lord
[1:09:05] Jesus Christ
[1:09:07] I'm trying to close here
[1:09:09] I better I better hold this up here yeah
[1:09:11] let's close it uh
[1:09:14] this goes with these two okay
[1:09:15] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:09:17] the spirit of the Lord is there's what
[1:09:19] there's liberty
[1:09:21] look you got Liberty now Liberty means
[1:09:24] this true Liberty is living as we ought
[1:09:26] and not as we please so true Liberty is

[1:09:55] face beholding as a glass in the glory
[1:09:58] of the Lord our change into the same
[1:10:00] image from glory to glory even by the
[1:10:02] spirit of God
[1:10:04] in other words if you really got Liberty
[1:10:06] you're looking into God's mirror and it
[1:10:09] is changing you to look just like it
[1:10:13] right you look into the word oh that's
[1:10:16] right that's why you read your Bible
[1:10:17] every day right that's why you pray Lord
[1:10:19] I want to be like that I want to see
[1:10:21] that my life I want to see Miracles I
[1:10:23] want to see healings I want to see
[1:10:24] salvation I want to see peace oh I want
[1:10:27] to see righteousness I want to see Joy
[1:10:28] praise God I want to become that and the
[1:10:30] Bible says if you have Liberty then you
[1:10:33] will become that praise God
[1:10:35] you become the word of God as you look
[1:10:38] into it
[1:10:42] just like any old book right you look
[1:10:43] into a porn book you're going to turn
[1:10:44] into a porn star
[1:10:46] you put your book in a doctor book
[1:10:48] you're gonna turn into a doctor
[1:10:50] huh
[1:10:52] put yourself I'd put myself in the
[1:10:53] Playbook when I played I played Akron
[1:10:55] Universe I played football at Akron
[1:10:56] University
[1:10:57] I play with some former superstars in
[1:10:59] the NFL I was never good though not that
[1:11:02] good
[1:11:02] but I just tell you the Playbook when I
[1:11:04] say the Playbook I become the Playbook
[1:11:07] right
[1:11:08] you put your face in this book you
[1:11:10] become God's book
[1:11:12] you become God's
[1:11:14] image you become God's servant
[1:11:18] your change from Glory unto Glory oh
[1:11:21] Hallelujah
[1:11:23] church I know it's all about when I
[1:11:25] first come the message I can only handle
[1:11:26] so much Glory
[1:11:28] I only understood water baptism but as
[1:11:30] time goes on I can handle more Glory oh
[1:11:32] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost Seven
[1:11:34] Seals I can just handle so much more
[1:11:36] Glory Hallelujah dancing before the Lord
[1:11:38] I can handle that amen because we go
[1:11:41] from glory to glory to more Glory
[1:11:44] because we stare in the word of God and
[1:11:45] we become the word of God
[1:11:49] we become
[1:11:50] the prophecy that's written about us
[1:11:52] that's what I mean we become the Bride
[1:11:54] of the last days
[1:11:59] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:12:01] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:12:02] is be not drunk with wine
[1:12:04] which is excess
[1:12:06] but be filled with the spirit
[1:12:10] speaking to yourselves in Psalms so here
[1:12:12] again this is these are clear signs
[1:12:14] you're walking in obedience to the
[1:12:15] spirit you're talking to one another
[1:12:17] about songs
[1:12:19] and hymns and spiritual songs singing

[1:12:24] your time where it's just you and God
[1:12:25] you don't have your cell phone there all
[1:12:26] the time right or your iPad or your
[1:12:28] whatever iMac whatever you got Aces
[1:12:32] in those times when you're just by
[1:12:34] yourself you're singing and making
[1:12:36] melody in your heart to the Lord there's
[1:12:37] joy in the house of the Lord
[1:12:40] there's joy in the house or are we
[1:12:42] worried about things that speaking bad
[1:12:43] things and what are we doing
[1:12:46] see when you're filled with the spirit
[1:12:47] you'll be constantly singing the praise
[1:12:48] of God
[1:12:50] still got a reason to praise
[1:12:54] so you'll sing these in your heart
[1:12:56] you'll constantly meditate upon the
[1:12:58] Praises of God
