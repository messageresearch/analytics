Thanksgiving we all sacrifice is amen praise God glory holiday best and let's think our bye was this evening by the grace of Lord I imagine that let's read out of let's go to try there's just different there's two different thoughts I kind of want to bring out tonight so let's just go to revelation 21:27 and we'll just we'll just read that for our text but I'm gonna background a little bit revelation 21:27 I'll try to be mindful the time here by God's grace I want to look at modesty again we've been look at the last couple weeks we've been looking at kind of reviewing modesty why we dressed the way we dress and so forth like that to update you on my book I'm writing this book and I think I have three thousand words done in Chapter five and this is on like all the other we I mean I've already done a chapter on hair clothing modest clothing there's a couple chapters this is the chapter that covers like jewelry makeup high heels and someone tattoos that's what and this one's taken the longest because there's so many scriptures about jeweler I didn't I didn't realize I must have forgot there's so many scriptures on jewelry in the Bible's haha it's taking all I'm taking a lot of ours I'm I'm just devoting a lot of hours and then to you know pray about that and what I find wonderful though that as I get into the channel the Holy Spirit brings the thoughts you know and gives me the right balance between the scriptures so I'm excited about that and just then you know this chapter is the slowest chapter so far because it requires so much additional study but praise the Lord anyhow god is good Revelation chapter 21 verse 27 let's read this together I like to look at abominations tonight and kinda like rightly dividing the Old Testament revelation 21:27 let's read this together on three one two three and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life Amen may God had his blessing serene of his word may be seated here praise the Lord so I was gonna ask the children to get ready to read here and not our guests now artists are regular children so Lydia Malachi and maybe Rebecca glad you can you have her Bibles handy we'll probably lean on you guys to do some reading there I want to start though back in second Kings 9:00 Wednesday we looked at make up and so let's go to 2nd Kings 9 I want to look at this thought on Jezebel's I was preaching on that thought you know I never studied out what does Emery mean remember her response was like Oh aren't you gonna be like Zimri gee who aren't you gonna be like Zimri I always wondered what was that about so I went studied it and now I understand so I think it'll be a blessing to you so it's gonna 2nd Kings chapter 9 I love these gold nuggets the Prophet talked about I just love going deeper in the Word of God and understanding the scripture so second Kings 9 and I'll watch this spear on Jezebel watch this spirit remember she's the one that's murdered she's murdered hundreds of Hebrew prophets she murdered neighbor the Bible said she committed whoredoms now I don't know if that's natural whoredoms with other men or just spiritual whoredoms but the Bible said she was guilty of whoredoms murders idolatry all kinds of wicked things now second Kings 9 when we start with Malachi Elijah Malachi why don't you read 30 and then Elijah we read 31 please sir all right thank you now as I was preaching on that I was like I kind of feel bad I wish I knew it who's Emery was and was it Henry was but let's look at this now remember from this from this story Jehu was anointed by I believe Elijah from the a by thy chef I'm not mistaken Elijah and he had already brought vengeance upon a Habs family he'd already end the lives of all a Habs and Jezebel's sons so that news had got back to Jezebel and she knew you know Jay who's coming for me she knew that according to what the historians say the commentaries so when she heard now that he's coming she paints her face and she does this in other defiance this is in defiance now uh on Wednesday I said maybe it was for to seduce him but I don't think it was that I think it was just utter defiance I think because she was an older woman you know she had children that were raised I don't think she was trying to seduce Jihu it doesn't look like that in the context but we know of course women today do that right that's why women paint their face up many times to attract men with a false face but anyways she paints her face and tires her head so she tyre means to arrange her hair cut in a calmly manner so she makes her hair I guess look as pretty as she can and paints her face and looks out the window so she doesn't go hide when she knows judgments coming she goes and stands right in the face of the man of God doesn't run away and repent you know doesn't try to get away she just stands there she's the queen she's she's gonna stand her ground and that's striking look at the boldness of this woman look at the boldness of this woman the utter rebellion of this woman this disappeared behind Jezebel remember this whole same spirit Jesus said is in the New Testament church deceiving churches today right same spirit spear of Jezebel and seduces my servants so we have to watch out for that sphere amongst us amongst all of us now to understand zimri now Jay who Jay who orgy who keeps saying Jay who I think it's G who entered in at the gate and she looks out at G who and says had Zimri peace who slew his master so in other words she's saying something about do you think you're gonna have any peace after what you're gonna do G who now let's find out whose Emory was so let's go to first I'm sorry that's the wrong one notes yeah that's first King 16 I'm sorry yeah first King 16 so her last attempt to save her life is to try to get this man of God if he you feel guilty I thought God this is her last attempt they're trying to work on his emotions maybe he won't bring the hammer down with me or maybe I can bring self condemnation on him this is her last attempt to save her life and this woman who's guilty of murders and guilty of whoredoms and all this wretched with the most notorious woman in the entire Bible her last attempt to save her life is to put the blame off of her not repent when she sees judgement coming she doesn't repent she boldly stands against it and tries to get the attention off of her and get it on the man of God that he'll feel ashamed of himself in that striking how many see that was sinners they try to make you feel guilty you're just trying to do what's right but they put all the blame on you yet there are the guilty ones they're the ones that need to repent they're the ones that need to feel bad but for some reasons Christians we just always feel bad right we feel like oh it's me I'm not doing the right thing but when word obeying the word of God when we're trying to cut sin out of our lives it's the right thing first King 16 let's find out who simmer II was so in other words she's saying oh you're just gonna be like Zimri G who don't you remember zimri first King 16 Lydia and Rebecca are you ready okay are you ready do you want to redo no okay sorry all right Lydia why don't you do eight or ten okay so who is zimri Zimmer II was a servant of a king and he conspired and he got the King drunk so he could kill him and then he took his throne and look at Jezebel Jezebel's like oh you're just like zimri cuz that's what Jay who's coming in to now he's not gonna really take over necessarily but she's trying to get him to feel bad Oh like you're just doing a conspiracy you're just getting rid of me in a selfish way that's when you got to know is this my feelings or is this God's leadership we know if it's God's leadership praise God not our feelings not our desires but what is the Holy Ghost leading me to do praise God and I'll always lead us away from sin always well the RAM said that I'm just doing a general quotation here but I've heard brother Branham say this he said if we say we have the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit can't convict us of our little sins on a daily basis then what good is it for he's there to catch us on every little thing that we can light up our entire lives with God's Word God's interested in the little details of our life okay Rebecca can you read verse 11 Pacey I think okay so look what he did he he killed the King and then he kills everybody else in the family now to make a long story short he ends up set he ruled for seven long years no seven days so his his conspiracy wasn't very fruitful he ruled for seven days and the Bible said later on in verse 9 in verse 20 that is all the northern Israel this he was a northern king not a king of Judah northern King and he saw all of northern Israel they anointed Omri to be king instead of him and so on the seventh day he got upset about that and he burnt down the whole king's house and himself he committed suicide and burnt down the whole King's chambers and everything like that so Jezebel's using this and saying Jay you think you're gonna have peace like Zimri denied peace he conspired to get the throne you think you're gonna have peace oh look at that demon power my she tried to get Jay to think he wouldn't have peace after pouring out the wrath of God rather than repenting and focusing on herself she shifted the blame on him in other words she's saying you're gonna feel bad if you kill me but Jay who knew he was anointed to pour out the wrath of God he knew if I don't cut her off God's gonna cut me off right because we said this morning Zimri did not have peace because he came to power unlawfully so look what happened here is again a perfect example of Jezebel misinterpreting miss applying the Word of God she looks at a situation that was part of history and she miss applies the situation to her own situation right that's what that's what the Jezebel spirit always does they miss apply the Word of God like one time this this one just comes to my mind a marriage in divorce case where somebody said well has you heiress could put away Vashti so that means I can put away my wife and marry another and that person's marriage second mayor they got married a second time it fell apart and the the the wife left the message left everything and you see they didn't have the Word of God they miss apply that and I prayed about this and said Lord Isis and the Holy Spirit showed me in the Book of Jeremiah where God told Jeremiah he said if you marry and put somebody away you could never take him back he said but I can do that I'm just paraphrasing but God said I will do that I'll put away Israel but I'll bring her back and so in other words the Bible says that God is saying I'm the only one that can do that New Testament people can't do that I'm the only one that can do that and so the Holy Spirit showed me that that was a real blessing in my heart so does this now make more sense I hope this is helpful this is why Jay Jay who doesn't skip a beat he looks up there and said who's on my side you listen you're on one side of the other you're on either the Jezebel side although all the churches are saved all the churches are go in heaven or you're with the message of the hour the small little minority I'm one of God's chosen for you praise the Lord I'm taking my way with God's a spice view there's a bigger Church in Akron that preached this message I go support them I say that all the time but since there is it will just be a little small minority praise God because we're standing with the Word of God that's right to see this was not a parallel Zimri was not a parallel to G who cuz G who was doing it lawfully by the anointing of Elijah spirit of God but our other friend there did not Zimri did not and maybe I shouldn't say friend but the other man did not do it lawfully he did it in a conspiracy okay so does that help to see any Jezebel spirit Church you see what do they do they fail to repent themselves and they shift the blame to other people they try to put people on a guilt trip it's really you know sister Connie it's really your fault you know Kristin you know it's really your fault and you should not have done that and you're gonna you're not peace with God you know oh that devil slick isn't he her last chance to save her life what does she do try to give meat you make you feel guilty that's why the Bible says if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you and we've got to remember that if I say God forgive me and you mean it God has forgiven you praise God we cannot live in self condemnation because this is the end this is the approach of the Jezebel spirit tries to rule keep her Kingdom trying to exalt herself above man and she puts the blame on the real man of God all right now hope that was a help that really helped me this week I thought now it all finally makes sense praise the Lord I never understood that okay now I would like to put this up here so Malachi can you switch over my desire is to go through let's go through abominations and rightly dividing the Old Testament it's been about three years since I preached on this I don't know if Fang and Bo were here when I hear brother bang when I preach on abominations I preach two sermons on 2015 so if you yeah if we can't remember maybe it's good that we go over it again so I wanted to cover that Jezebel and Zimri now chapter 2 of the book is gonna be on called how to apply Old Testament scripture to the New Testament now some of these are real familiar but let's just state this again the Bible says st. Peter and st. Paul both wrote that we must learn from the Old Testament Paul said that we can learn from Israel's journey through the wilderness and 1st Corinthians chapter 10 and all scripture I remember that says all Scripture is useful for doctrine reproof correction and instruction and righteousness all scripture now the trouble is that people don't rightly divide the word the right way and so a man of God has to see the whole Word of God and he's got to rightly divided he's got to cut this and say this applies to the bride this applies to the foolish virgin this applies to the Jew this applies to the make believer this this applies to the unbeliever or this no longer applies anymore so that's the that's the bet that's the gift of God today so in my studies now I could be wrong in other words I've got room to grow but I right now I can see there's five categories that we divide Old Testament scripture into we divide it into ceremonial laws that the priests would keep but we're no longer under that anymore so those are no longer in effect for Gentiles other moral laws that were there's some more laws that were not under anymore and I'm gonna give you some examples now a third group is this is the one that we've got to be careful of Old Testament laws that are still in effect today in other words the holy nature of God in the Old Testament he despised the sin and he still despises that sin today and then there's another category where you can take a scripture and it's really not a law or anything but it's an allegory and we can learn from an allegory which is like a type you can learn from a type and then there's other Scripture that's not really a law of the Old Testament it's just a prophecy and then that is a direct prophecy that we have to be able to apply to our lives today okay does that help by God's grace and I think you'll see as we go through these what I'm talking about here now I'm not gonna spend much time but I'm gonna go through ceremonial laws in Hebrew 7 the Bible says the blood of bulls and goats is done away with we have one sacrifice now it's Jesus Christ so I'm not gonna spend much time on that other but let's go to Hebrews 10 let's go to Hebrews 10 and I want to show you where the scripture says that we're under the new priesthood I know the last time I preached on the priesthood and marriage requirements and ministers I know that's third some feathers but that's fine I mean if people don't believe the Bible or maybe they can't see it that's fine you know if they can't see what what I can see that's fine but I want to I want to show you that the Bible says that the priesthood is changed so hebrews chapter 10 now i'm not finding the scripture so I'm sorry I gotta go look it up real quick / me he I'm sorry it's Hebrews 7 12 forgive me I'm sorry I thought was Hebrews 10 my fault Hebrews 7 12 pardon me so in other words what we're saying is the believer today is not under the Arion ik priesthood when brother Branham says that clearer than the church age book he said that's what the deeds of the Nicolaitans was all about Christians supposed to Christians that would try to do a headship where men rule over men that's getting back into the Aaronic system or how preachers can only come out of seminaries you know this idea something like that so let's look at the scripture here Hebrews 7:10 I'm sorry 712 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law okay so the priests it has changed we're not under the air in priests it anymore we're under the Melchizedek Priesthood and it's a good thing we are because if we were under the error in priesthood st. Paul could not have been a preacher because he had eye trouble I remember that and Leviticus Leviticus says no priests can have eye trouble he can have no blemish in his eyes but there's times Paul couldn't see very well does the aren't you glad you're not under the Levitical ceremonies anymore we're under the Melchizedek Priesthood now so that that's one example that's one example so that's a ceremonial all the ceremonial laws are no longer in effect the physical requirements for ministers the hereditary requirements of priesthood you have to be born of the tribe of Aaron and Levi sacrificing animals we're no longer under that now let's go through some examples of laws we're not under huh me no we're no longer under circumcision anymore that's in Galatians 615 prohibited foods in Acts chapter 10 9 through 16 we're not under the diet of the Jews anymore God showed Peter three visions and said rise and eat and Peter says no Lord can you imagine town the Lord no right to his face no he's like no Lord no I said rise keone no I've never touched anything unclean rise killing eat no Lord he was it was so ingrained in him I just can't I couldn't eat that I just can't do that it's against my religion and he even turned on the voice of the Holy Spirit but I'm sure he learned later on also another example and if you have some examples you can share him with me afterwards I like to hear him too the instant death penalty for blasphemy was no longer in effect because Paul was a blasphemer and the Christians didn't go out and kill him right Paul said I was a blasphemer but I did it in ignorance but the scripture says in Leviticus 24 14 anyone who blasphemes should die right there on the spot so see these are just you and what you church what we have to do is we have to be patient enough and search the scripture deep enough to find the answer in other words we have to care if people ask you what do you feel about this what do you feel about that we have to care enough to actually look in the scripture we have to care enough to answer questions in other words we can't get complacent well brother Jesse this is what I've done my whole life I can't grow anymore yeah this is all I can do now I don't want to read the Bible anymore we don't want that attitude here we want to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord so those are three clear laws that are no longer in effect that we can prove by the scripture now and then I listened in the chapter listed three that are still in effect and here they are the first one is nine out of ten commandments are still in effect the only one that's not is the literal Sabbath day that's the only one that's not in effect the next one is abominations there's many abominations that are still in effect today and the third one is tithing tithing is still in effect today so those are three clear examples now we may get to those in just a minute but let's go through allegorical truth let's go to Galatians 4 21 now we can we can use some of the Old Testament Scriptures helpful for us and we can divide it into this category of allegory or types and shadows so Galatians go to Galatians 4 21 maybe I can go back to Malachi and Elijah for this one okay guys all right thank you because we can't say well or blanket statement all we don't need the Old Testament anymore we're not under the law anymore we're not under the Old Testament we'll get to that in a minute it's true in a way we're not under the law but another way we are under the law but it's the law of the Spirit so we're just under a different law the law of the Spirit so Galatians 4 21 now chyron don't you read 21 and 22 please ok logic can you read 23 and 24 please a Liguria okay so the idea of Ishmael and Isaac was given to us as an allegory we can learn from that Scripture today that's a type Ishmael was born of the flesh but Isaac was born of the promise praise God see Ishmael was a result of Abraham trying to bring God's Word to pass himself but Isaac is a result of waiting on God's promise and so this scripture you know the story of Isaac and Ishmael can be placed under here that's the allegorical truth that we can learn from everybody see that by God's grace okay hope that's quite clear another one is the idea of Jesus and Joseph were both both sold for pieces of silver but we're not gonna read that Joseph was sold for twenty and Jesus for thirty that's an allegorical truth it's a foreshadowing of Christ to come so see we can use those Old Testament Scriptures they're very important to us now another thing is that allegory sometimes are prophetic like with the story of Joseph in Egypt I remember when he revealed himself to the breslin where was his bride at church she was put out she was put away so when Jesus reveals himself to the 144,000 the bride is nowhere to be seen she's not on the earth she's at the marriage supper so see that's why we need or allegorical truths that's why we need types and shadows because they teach us about the Lord and it allows Jesus to reveal things to us which other you know intellectual people of the Bible they can't see that because they say well the Old Testament doesn't apply to us or they don't spend time back there but how many know the Holy Spirit wrote that word and the Holy Spirit wants to speak to us through that Old Testament amen hallelujah praise God the next example is direct prophecy okay so Lydia and Rebecca maybe Liddy why don't you go to first Corinthians 15:54 first Corinthians 15:54 this is just a striking that's always been a striking example to me first Corinthians 15:54 now this of course is the portion on the rapture all right so lady can you read 54 please did you ever think about that where did that statement death SWAT up in victory come from it came from the writings of Isaiah eight hundred years before Christ was born Isaiah got inspired of the Holy Spirit and said death will be swallowed up in victory now let's go read it let's have Rebecca and everybody let's go to isaiah 25:8 isaiah 25:8 can you imagine paul would read those Old Testament Old Testament text and you and I would have never caught the rapture in Isaiah 25 we would not have been looking for the rapture but a prophet reads that and that thought is inspired it jumps off the pages and he picks it up he's reading Isaiah 25 you said this is the rapture this is what's gonna happen at the second coming of Jesus Christ amen glory death is going to be swallowed up in victory and nobody else can see that in the Book of Isaiah but a prophet of God amen isaiah 25:8 okay Rebecca whenever you're ready amen praise the Lord Isaiah wrote this actually in 712 BC so about 800 years god bless you sir amen now who would have thought Church who would have thought that the rapture would be laying in Isaiah 25 the rapture of all these surrounding scriptures the Holy Spirit takes just that one pulls it out and said this is referring to the rapture so see that's why we got to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit we could be reading and the Holy Spirit could reveal something that applies to our day and it could be direct prophecy for us but if we've never understood it we might be hesitant to believe it so we have to wait for the anointing or the influence of the Holy Spirit we have to wait for the direction of the Holy Spirit to guide us to more direct prophecy that's already laying in Scripture in front of us amen look at verse 6 though and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines and of the leaves of fat things full of marrow of wines on the LEAs well refined and he will destroy in this mount in the face of the covering cast over all the people and the veil that is spread before all nations and he will swallow up death in victory so he's speaking about a time where there's gonna be wine flowing on mountains the mountain of the New Jerusalem praise God and then he starts talking about how all the the veil that's over the earth is gonna be taken away God's gonna take that veil away and everybody is gonna see him amen he's going to destroy that this covering that's cast over all the people this this sin disease God is going to destroy that what's he gonna do he's gonna send fire burn it over and make a new heavens and a new earth that's right who would have thought the rapture was right there he will swallow up death in victory I don't know yeah that's why I love the holy spirit amen he just picks that up and said this is for your day Paul prophesied now another example is the new heavens and new earth I'm not gonna go over that though we're pretty familiar with that Isaiah 65 17 in second Peter 3:13 another example is David in Psalm 16:10 I will not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption direct prophecy and then acts 2:27 Peter says that death I'm sorry Peter says that Jesus was God's Holy One and he did not see any corruption so direct prophecy these aren't really ceremonial laws or laws they're just they're their words their songs and it's prophecy that the Holy Spirit wants to fulfill today amen now let's go the next one here two or three witnesses I don't think we need to cover the homosexuality we know that's the sin in the Old Testament New Testament how about honoring children honoring their parents somebody know that's in the New Testament okay fusions chapter 6 how about tithing does anyone want to see tithing again in the New Testament you're gonna see that no okay caris do you want to I'm sure you do I know you do let me go that real quick first there's five reasons that still applies the New Testament never abolish is tithing second Jesus said tithing was the least of the commands which means it's still command third Jesus never stopped anyone from paying ties fourth st. Paul taught ministers who preach the gospel should live of the gospel in 1st Corinthians chapter 9 fifth Hebrews 7 verses 2 & 3 Abraham the father of faith paid ties without a written command of God and the Bible said we're the children of Abraham when we have faith in Jesus Christ okay so that one asked us five witnesses now let's go over this thought that we're not under the law now it's true we're not under the Old Testament law as far as like Ishmael we're not trying to keep the word of our self how many knows your flesh cannot keep the Word of God how many know that your flesh is gonna fail every time that's why you need to live by the faith of Christ that's why you got to get up every day die to yourself say Holy Spirit and power me and anoint me give me the desire to do what's right give me your desire your faith to obey the Word of God and if you do that now you're not walking according to the Old Testament law but you're walking in the law of the Spirit which is the law that we're under so let's go to Romans 8 we'll see that in the scripture so I take a couple pages in the book Lord willing like I said if we get it published and I show this we show how we are under the law of the Holy Spirit so people say oh we're not in the law we're not gonna law well yeah to some degree you're right we're not under the curse of the law the curse of laws if you break one word you're guilty of all of it the Bible said Jesus took that curse away from us amen we're not under the curse of the law but we are under the law of the Spirit so what the Holy Spirit wrote there in the Old Testament that was holiness holy Living God wants us to keep that today we are under that law the holiness of God amen Romans 8 see some people like I said well all of us all of us are without understanding all of us needed to understand this by God's grace Romans 8:1 was it start there Malachi and logic can you help us out here Malak I won't read verse 1 and 2 amen Church you should be happy if you're walking by the spirit you have no condemnation today there's nothing Satan can put on you because you're walking in the spear in other words you're obeying the Holy Spirit you're not under the law of sin and death I'm not I'm not a slave and I'm not trying to earn my salvation I'm already saying they men I'm walking in the spirit praise God Satan can't condemn me because I've confessed all my sins and when I'm wrong I've talked about it anything I've done wrong I told Jesus he's the most important one to tell about it but see the law of the spirit of life that's the law were under now the Holy Spirit law Alijah can you read three and four please amen thank you sir so see that what the Bible say the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us how many member when Paul wrote that the law was holy the law was good he said but I'm a carnal I'm sold under sin and the things that I want to do I can't do remember that interest I think it's later on and it's previously in Romans chapter 6 but Paul's saying that's what I'm walking the flesh right but see when we walk in the spirit we're fulfilling the righteousness of the law remember jesus said when he got baptized he said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness God is God wants his people to do the right thing to do the holy thing to walk and righteousness the only way to do that is to obey the Holy Spirit and that will never lead you away from the word it all leads you into the word that's exactly right so the blanket statement all we're not under the law well yeah that's true to some degree we're not trying to earn salvation we're not under the curse of all that's true but we are under the law of the Holy Spirit I'm you understand that and anyone who rejects the law of the Holy Spirit will reject eternal life because the Holy Spirit is eternal life it's exactly right that's the scripture now there's a lot of blanket statements that are true like here's a blanket statement that is true Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father and no one gets to heaven except through Christ and we know that that's a blanket statement that's all true the Bible says that he's an a only one to be saved here's other blanket statements Lord willing I've also put him on my video to know person the New Testament was ever a record as being baptized in the titles father son Holy Ghost all recorded baptisms were in the name of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus or Lord God never asked one woman one godly woman to cut or trim her hair god never asked I'm sorry that God never called himself three persons Jesus was never called the second person Jesus never called a woman to be an apostle the Apostles never asked anyone if they wanted to invite Jesus into their hearts what they say they said repent and be baptized repent of your sins turn from your sins and now you can serve Christ so see there are there are blanket statements that are true but church were the only ones I believe in the whole world that can make true blanket statement like this that are not only true but they're thus saith the Lord which means we have a prophet that has come and told us this is thus saith the Bible we're the only ones that have that amen glory glory okay give me 15 more minutes here I'm gonna try to do about an hour now I need some readers here let's close with abominations here so I did about two pages on abominations okay any of the children know what's about what's an abomination mean what is the word we mean is anybody know anybody know Haman you know it's a sin it actually means a disgusting thing it means a disgusting thing like an unclean a really gross thing that's what abomination is it's an unclean thing let's go to Deuteronomy 1231 Lydia and Rebecca once you get ready here we'll have you read next Deuteronomy 1231 God literally says listen what he literally says in Deuteronomy 1231 whenever you're ready Lydia I'm not there yet but Deuteronomy 1231 okay this is speaking of course child sacrifice but notice they did according to their abominations which the LORD thy God hated so that God sets a precedence right there a pattern he is going to hate every abomination every disgusting thing he's going to hate so we have laws we had moral laws all these things now of course you know abominations fall under laws that are still in effect their commands that God's given us that we have to be careful there are hundreds sixty-six times the Bible mentions abominations 157 the Old Testament and nine in the New Testament so there's a lot more in the Old Testament than the New Testament and I went through every one again and I found most of the abominations in the Old Testament are still abomination in the New Testament fact almost all of them except for three I found that's a lot so there's only three that are no longer abomination so as a preacher I'm supposed to rightly divide the word if somebody asked me are we under the law anymore well we're under the law of the Holy Spirit and I find in my studies that 9 out of 10 commandments are still sin the New Testament and almost every abomination except for three are still abomination the New Testament so we can't say I don't need the Old Testament anymore we desperately need the Old Testament it's part of God's inspired Word all Scripture is useful to make us what perfect unto every good work amen glory now here's the three that are no longer in effect the first one is eating a peace offering on the third day if you eat if you left a peace offering sit out for three days and you eat it on the third day God said that's an abomination probably because of health reasons if you leave how food that long without refrigeration you know but it was an abomination and that's in Leviticus 718 now the reason since I'm short on time I'm just gonna go quickly the reason that's done away with is because the Bible says that Christ is our offering and Christ is our peace now and we already showed from Hebrews 7 that we're not under the law bulls and goats anymore we're not under the physical sacrifice we're under the sacrifice of Christ and the Bible said we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ not through animal sacrifice okay the second abomination which is no longer in effect is offering a blemished animal sacrifice that's in Deuteronomy 17 1 so if you brought a lamb but it had a blemish or a broken leg or you know it was bleeding or something like that or I don't know it wasn't the right sacrifice it was an abomination in other words God is saying don't bring me some wimpy offering no don't bring me some half-hearted sacrifice give me your best amen that's what I believe God's asking us on Sunday give us our give God our best worship on Sunday our best on Wednesday give everything we got to God we must bring our best sacrifice amen that's why I give Church the most I give them a church than most of my attention the most of my energy and if I'm worn out on Monday hallelujah I'm worn out for Jesus amen but Christ is gonna get them my best sacrifice no so let me say this the offering a blemish animal sacrifice is no longer in effect but haami no we must offer a true spiritual sacrifice in the New Testament if not it's a domination to God now that's true because of John 4:24 jesus said the father is looking for worshipers who worship in spirit and truth and in Matthew 15:9 jesus said if you teach for doctrines the commandments of men your worship is in vain okay so there are spiritual sacrifices if you offer these things to God and there's a blemish in their spiritual blemish God does not receive it so spiritually that law applies today yes because the Bible says present your bodies a living sacrifice in Romans 12:1 and 2 okay and then the third abomination is the unclean foods we already talked about that that's in Leviticus 11 I'm sorry let me guess 9/11 243 all those foods that Peter can eat God says now you can eat them now to go along with that there's a balance there how many know there's a balance even to that the Bible said you cannot eat blood or strangled animals in the New Testament or the third one is foods that are dedicated to an idol now that did really doesn't impact us today but the days of paw I was reading on that yesterday they must have went into restaurants and the restaurants must have had idols in them or something and they the paul told him it said if you sit down and eat this meat as offered to idols he said it doesn't bother your conscience but what about the people around you young weak Christians that are sitting around you and they - you eat meat that was sacrificed to an idol he said you'll cause him to stumble he said in he said you could cause your brother to perish can you imagine that because of me and my Liberty I thought I could eat this oh I'm a Christian I know this isn't a sin I know this isn't really I know there's no God that this is really sacrificed - I'll just eat it anyway but the Bible says if you don't think about the needs of others you can cause people to perish spiritually how many know that and Paul says when you do that you not only sin against the weak Christian you sit against Christ that's the scripture so that one really doesn't impact us right now as far as I can see can any brothers think of any ideas like where we eat meat that sacrificed to idols you think of that I mean would you consider a hamburger at bw3 sacrificed soon I don't know I don't know I just know you I'd be careful what kind of atmosphere you go around no yes we wouldn't go in a place like that let me close with these last few thoughts here so that's the third one unclean foods that abomination has done away with but there is a balance you can't eat a strangled animal meat meat that's bloody I don't know and I don't know I that's something I got study too you know like oh I want a rare steak I don't know if that's wrong or not Church I don't know I don't know I like rare steaks I'll be honest I prefer steaks I don't like I'm too bloody but you know to me I just I don't know so I need to look up that I've never studied that so if I'm wrong forgive me if I do if I'm doing wrong it's because I'm ignorant of it but like I said we ought to be willing to examine our lives more closely to the Word of God okay now the last thing here's a list of abominations that are still detestable to God I briefly went over this last week I'm gonna go a little slower because I still got seven minutes and I'll try to close in seven minutes and I think will be how I'll be happy to cover most of chapter two okay how many know that justifying sin is an abomination let me know that when you say this sin it's okay to do this soon it's okay for me to dissent when you do that you're committing an abomination well it's okay in my case to do this it's okay for me to lie it's okay for me to steal it's okay for me to commit adultery or fornication when you justify yourself it's an abomination the sight of God when you're in sin now now that's in Jude verse four let's go to Jude 4 and who we at liddie or Malachi I'm sorry Lydia wait you yeah see this is Rebecca okay Becca can go to Jude for thank you the Bible clearly teaches us when you say that sin is acceptable unto God that's an abomination like my little girls walked up to me yesterday after my mom left and said daddy can mommy be can your mommy be safe she cuts her hair wears shorts wears makeup and I said I don't know I don't know I said God is gonna have to have mercy on her she doesn't repent and change your ways God is gonna have to have mercy on her I said because she's sitting and I said I just told my children right was it Karras or haven which one was Haven in here she's not Karras was a human that said that I think it was you yeah and they come up real sincere and I want to be sincere with them I said but I have this consolation the thief on the cross was a murderer and he just got done making fun of Jesus mocking Jesus when they're first came to the cross I've scripture on that but somehow in the matter of the hours he was on the cross he repents and he said Jesus is holy he's he's right just we deserve this and he said remember me when you come into your kingdom and I said God saved him so I said let's pray to God save grandma I think we prayed right there that God would save grandma you can't act like Jezebel I think you're gonna be saved right it's gonna take the mercy of God God is gonna have to mercy upon people and so we don't want it we don't want to justify sin we don't want to tell them oh it's okay if they wear shorts or it's okay if they wear pants or it's okay it's not okay and is gonna have to have mercy upon people and that's what we asked for that's why we should be the ones praying and sighing and crying for the abominations done in our families who else is gonna do it who's gonna be the job in here who's gonna be the job in here that offers sacrifices for your children or offer sacrifices for your family members we need some saints like Joel praise God now understand if someone's living in sin it's gonna have to be us it's gonna be our prayers so God will have mercy upon them someone's got to intercede for them they're not interceding for their self so we have to become priests amen we have to use the priestly role and intercede honey be God honored job sacrifice for his children but Graham said God did honor his sacrifice for his children and have got under his he's gotta honor yours too he's not a respecter of persons but the thing to do is trust in your sacrifice trust in the blood of Jesus sake put your trust in the blood of Jesus Christ all right we're back I'm sorry you got that Jude 1:4 condemnation the Shiva sness thank you wonderful so the Bible said preachers who turn God's grace into a license to sin or ordained to be condemned so that proves it any any preacher anyone who justifies sin and cause it righteous is under the judgment of God so God still hates justifying sin now the next one's homosexuality there's three scriptures a New Testament that say it's wrong I don't think we need to go there I think we understand that idolatry and graven images are condemned in Galatians 5 revelation 13 revelation 21 revelation 22 so there's another abomination that's still sin sacrificing children is still abomination in Revelation 21:8 I don't remember that one oh it's murder yeah revelation 21:8 sorry I'm gonna go there I'll read that one our Malachi can you read that revelation 21:8 sir yeah it's murderers I believe yeah amen think of all these abortions Church I think of all this evil that's being done it's still an abomination people don't understand that witchcraft is also condemned in Galatians 5 20 and 21 Old Testament Bhama nation New Testament abomination cross-dressing now this is one Deuteronomy 20 five we know cross-dressing abomination I am I'm using indirect scriptures to prove this one because there's nothing in the New Testament that condemns cross-dressing that I can find if you found it let me know because I want to preach it I want to share with the world but what I can find is that Jesus never broke the law so geez that means Jesus always wore men garments always and for some reason I wrote down John 829 let's go there John 829 and Elijah can you read that John 829 please I'm not sure I wrote this down I must had a good reason John 829 okay yeah yeah you read that okay so I just use indirect scriptures every understand that since I have no direct scriptures that say cross-dressing is wrong in the New Testament I have to use indirect scriptures where Jesus says I always do that which pleased the father I never broke any Old Testament command so it was pleasing to God for his own son never to put on women's clothes and so our women she never put on men's pants right men's clothes and our men should never dress like women right which is awful like at my school at Halloween time I see boys that dress up as girls and it's awful I just sit there and look at them and shake my head like that's awful that's what they're teaching them at this age that it's okay and that said worshiping with a wicked heart okay there's my timer so there's my 15 minutes let's stand I better stop here this is what I'll do is I'll keep preaching while you stand so couple more minutes worshiping with the wicked heart even though you're worshiping is an abomination and this is found in Matthew 7 where Jesus says yeah you might have cast out devils you might done many wonderful works of my name but your worker of iniquity you never I never knew you depart from me you worker of iniquity they had to been worshiping because they were doing great things and not under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and Jesus has depart from me so they were worshiping with wicked hearts how many member diverse weights and measures the the financial people that would change the measure oh if I just if I if I decrease this or decrease this measure I can make a little more money that's called extortion and you can still go to jail for that today stealing people's money well extortionists clearly called sin in first corinthians 6:10 so that's still an abomination to steal people's money wicked thoughts wicked hearts wicked ways froward perverse hearts are all abominations and that's seen in acts 20 29 and 30 and there are seven abominations that are still abominations in proverbs 6 16 through 19 pride there's seven things the Lord doth hate abominable pride lying murder wicked thoughts pursuing mischief false witness and sowing discord and every single one of those can be shown the New Testament to be sin and abominations are you grateful for the Word of God today I'm grateful for a prophet that God sent us to help us rightly divide the word but now we know our prophet today is the Holy Spirit amen let's give Lord Rama pause amen and now as we close Church you know I'll be honest like there's some there's some Old Testament laws I don't sure I'm not sure about like cotton you know the Bible said there's certain materials you must wear I never even thought about these things and if you asked me after church I wouldn't know what to tell you so what would I have to do I would have to use the same laws that Paul placed in our scripture we'd have to look at that scripture and say was it right for me to wear this clothing nah I hope nobody asked me that though out there sad because I don't know but you'd have to have to study the scripture and try to understand these things and we know of course our prophet would have probably told us but there perhaps or something maybe he didn't get to but the idea is we want to grow in righteousness the idea is Jesus said the Holy Ghost will lead you into all truth the Holy Ghost is going to keep leading us deeper into the word the Word of God and we got to understand the Word of God now I close that chapter with how Jesus magnified the law and Jesus Jesus showed Jesus enlarged the law like of adultery and showed what it really was it was the spirit of lust and huh me know there's one thing you need to fill all the long let me know what that is love amen God that sister praise the Lord there's one thing that fulfills all the law the law so fill in one word love and what laachraoui under the law of the Spirit and the Spirit is love God is love God is the Holy Ghost there's one thing we need to keep all the law the baptism of the ha it just keeps going back to the baptism the Holy Ghost church and guess what it's gonna keep going back to that because that's what's gonna separate the wise virgins from the foolish virgins those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible said he shed his love upon us in the form of the Holy Ghost so God when if God has really loved you you know what he's done He shed His grace upon you he's poured out his love upon you he's poured out his Holy Spirit upon you so now you can keep all the law because the Holy Spirit will lead you away from anything that represents sin and unrighteousness now I want you come to the piano thank you sir and I want to thank now hi today he got the live stream going without my help and he was doing the piano okay thank you ma'am I appreciate that I'm sorry I was in there I was so nervous like you know how I get before sermons you know I just wanna get everything ready but thank you son I appreciate that that meant a lot to me now are there any questions I know brother John likes to ask questions I want to maybe do this on Sunday night are there any questions I could answer now that you might have where I can research for Wednesday's anybody have any questions or anything you want to just think about it for a minute so I really like questions I like to go search it out myself and find out what is that or what is what script what scripture says any questions at all yeah okay yes is it does that be known because he just got space or okay that means no man can see the invisible spirit he saw God's theophany that's what that means he saw God's spiritual body that's what he saw kind of like an angelic body it's the same type of body it's at theophany or spiritual body good question I like that question John right yeah yeah that's a good question that's a good question I'll look into a little bit I just would say first of all just make sure we pray before every every meal but then also since we're aware of that bill John we've got to use the net knowledge and if we know McDonald's has some unhealthy standards for Ray to make getting their chicken breasts or whatever more that we should probably just stay away from McDonald's if we or just get a sound when we go or something like that oh yeah we have to use whisk that's a great that's a great thought if we know there's on humane practices like strangling the other we need we need to abstain from that that's a good thought brother good thought any other thoughts about sister Connie yeah that's a good one yeah I've never studied that yeah I'll look that up and I'll look in the message to see her brother Brandon said anything about that anybody know if he said anything about that brother Johnny have you heard anything about that okay I'll look up like silk cotton what else God yeah I know that's in this wool cotton wool I would like to see what brother Graham said about it first and then if we don't have that then we just have to lean upon the Holy Spirit you know I would like to know that that's a good thought I like the questions at the end is good to know what people are thinking by God's grace all right so maybe next time we're willing we'll look at Christian liberties there was numerous areas about our Christian liberties let me just read them real quick so you got them and so you'll be thinking about this week here are the areas ok foods foods are an era of Christian Liberty except like we talked about things strangled blood observing holy day so now that gets down to like Christmas and Easter and that would be something good to preach on certain holidays is your Christian Liberty the next one is wine I want to preach on wine because I was studying on that and the Bible says in Luke 1 that John the Baptist was not to drink any wine or strong drink so the wine in the Bible days is different than wine today and the history I've been reading on it says the wine was the the the blood of the the blood of the grape only it had no additive intoxication purposes it was just the juice from the fruit okay so we'll look at that Lord willing next week by the grace of God but member Paul said if drinking wine or eating fruit causes one person to stumble he said I won't do it as long as the world is standing and that's the ethic because why because you're living for other people you're living for the people how many living for other people and I was studying too and I found one person I think that caused people to be lost I think it was a lot I think it was lies I said the scripture he caused his wife to be lost because the Bible says that you can call somebody to sin and they'll perish the Bible says think about that he chose to move down into Sodom and when he's leaving his wife turns around and wants to go back what if he never would have moved down to Sodom but see it looks like he caused his wife to be lost can you imagine it and brothers we got to be careful where were leading our families how many could say amen to that as a pastor I'd be careful where I'm leading this church I want to lead us to the Holy Spirit lead us to the Word of God that we live the right kind of life now I have a whole sermon on that one so that's just a little introduction to that amen what song is that buddy what was it all right let's see that to sing that by God is good okay see the light of the Holy Spirit today Oh the Holy Spirit just takes this word and shines upon and lights it up so we can see how our lives should glorify Christ all right it's just about home time I can see my father standing at the door this word has been wilderness not ready for deliver it know what I'm never this home and you see the birds know what I never been this home before when the redeemed are gathering
