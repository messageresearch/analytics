[6:19] through the book of Romans by God's
[6:21] grace such a wonderful book and brother
[6:24] Ram said this is a deep book brother Ram
[6:26] said uh Paul couldn't preach these types
[6:28] of things to the Corinthian Church
[6:30] because it's so deep and we're not
[6:33] trying to be deep like in a prideful way
[6:35] but the Bible said the spirit searches
[6:36] the Deep things yay the Deep things of
[6:38] God so we're taught from the scripture
[6:41] that the Holy Ghost will guide us into
[6:42] deeper things and that's what we want we
[6:44] want a more personal walk with the Lord
[6:46] how many you want that like God I don't
[6:48] want a superficial walk like I kind of
[6:50] know God I want a deep walk with the
[6:52] Lord or we can really know we are the
[6:54] bride of Christ all you husbands know
[6:57] you whispered all these secrets made all
[6:58] these promises to your bride before you
[7:00] took her and I'm sure you make some more
[7:02] now that's your married like honey I
[7:04] promise I'll take you out this summer
[7:05] for a little getaway that's what I'm
[7:07] telling my wife some of you help me out
[7:09] with that by God's grace but we whisper
[7:11] these secrets right these personal
[7:12] things that's how I want to know Jesus
[7:14] praise God Amen I want to know I want to
[7:16] know him that well where he whispers his
[7:17] love secrets to us hallelujah amen amen
[7:20] amen Romans here uh chapter 8 I think
[7:23] we'll start at verse
[7:28] three
[7:31] I just want to read uh 3 four and five
[7:33] by God's grace you know last Sunday we
[7:36] looked at the
[7:37] righteousness U of the New Testament
[7:41] we're not under the condemnation of the
[7:42] Old Testament we're under the
[7:43] righteousness the ministry of
[7:45] righteousness Paul calls it and it's
[7:48] Jesus Christ sharing his righteousness
[7:50] with us praise God amen amen we have no
[7:52] no boasting in heaven we can't brag on
[7:54] anything in heaven uh all the
[7:56] righteousness comes from Jesus Christ he
[7:58] makes us righteous it's imputed to us as
[8:01] a substitutionary sacrifice our sin was
[8:03] placed upon him his righteousness comes
[8:06] Upon Us Praise Goden hallelujah we're
[8:08] robed in his righteousness Romans 8:3
[8:11] for what the law could not do in that it
[8:14] was weak through the flesh God sending
[8:15] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[8:17] flesh and for sin condemned sin in the
[8:21] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[8:23] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[8:25] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[8:29] they that are after The Flesh do mind
[8:30] the things of the flesh but they that
[8:32] are after the spirit the things of the
[8:34] spirit God bless you may God has
[8:36] blessings to read his word you may be
[8:40] seated I know that's why you're here
[8:41] Church you're walking after the things
[8:43] of the spirit how many want more things
[8:44] of the
[8:45] spirit you know we get so wrapped up in
[8:48] carnal things you know we just have to
[8:50] we have to take care of insurance and
[8:52] bills and uh eating and feeding
[8:55] ourselves and taking care of our
[8:56] families uh and it's such a blessing to
[8:58] have the the Holy Spirit move in
[9:00] spiritual Supernatural ways how many
[9:02] look for Spiritual things in your life
[9:03] amen amen remember like I preached a few
[9:05] weeks ago brother said he would approach
[9:07] a new year and he'd lay out a thousand
[9:09] imitations he said he'd lay them out on
[9:11] a table and he'd say Lord direct me to
[9:14] which ones and he he said I I go for a
[9:16] drive I go for a walk and I pray and
[9:19] talk and wait for God to give him some
[9:21] type of inspiration praise God and to me
[9:23] church that's the simple humble way that
[9:25] if that's how a prophet look for
[9:27] inspiration that's how we can look for
[9:29] inspiration praise God Amen yes we pray
[9:31] we read our Bibles and we're dedicated
[9:33] to God but as we go throughout the day
[9:34] we keep our minds focused on the Lord
[9:37] and we look for the inspiration of the
[9:38] Holy Spirit praise God for God to put
[9:41] somebody on your heart or God leading
[9:43] you to go to a certain place we want to
[9:45] be led by the spirit of God hallelujah
[9:47] amen amen now verse three tells us that
[9:51] uh the Bible says here that God sent his
[9:54] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[9:56] now it wasn't sinful flesh Jesus never
[9:59] sinned he was tempted at all points but
[10:02] the Bible said he was without sin praise
[10:04] God Amen
[10:06] Hallelujah God sent him like that and of
[10:09] course his flesh brother R said he could
[10:11] have headaches right he could be in the
[10:12] boat trying to sleep off a headache and
[10:14] then the disciples would wake him up and
[10:16] said come speak to the storm he said oh
[10:18] you have little
[10:19] faith he'd have enough uh enough
[10:22] awareness to rebuke the the disciples if
[10:24] you only had a little bit of Faith you
[10:26] could rebuke the storm God help us amen
[10:28] amen help us today hallelujah amen we
[10:31] know he's the same yesterday today and
[10:32] forever praise God so God would
[10:34] encourage us he had to rebuke us to use
[10:37] some of the Godly uh Power and The Godly
[10:40] Authority that he's given to the people
[10:42] of God Amen but the Bible said uh Jesus
[10:46] he took on flesh to condemn sin in the
[10:49] flesh that means he condemned all of our
[10:51] sin he paid for all of our sins that's
[10:54] why the Bible said there's no
[10:56] condemnation to us amen Jesus condemn
[10:59] sin hallelujah it's like Moses with the
[11:02] Brazen serpent brother that said that
[11:04] serpent represented Christ that's what
[11:06] the Bible says right see it represented
[11:09] sin was already judged right amen it
[11:11] already gone through the fires of
[11:13] Affliction right the fires of judgment
[11:15] the serpent had already been and burnt
[11:17] right Jesus went through the fiery uh
[11:20] sufferings of death and and persecution
[11:23] he went through that and when he rose
[11:25] Hallelujah we could look on him like
[11:27] brother said we could look on him in
[11:30] Hallelujah anyone that want to be healed
[11:32] from the serpent bites anyone that want
[11:34] to be healed from any sickness anyone
[11:36] that want to deliver from Death all they
[11:38] had to do was look and live to Christ
[11:40] hallelujah look to the word of God look
[11:42] to Jesus hallelujah how many been healed
[11:44] by Jesus hallelujah how many have looked
[11:46] to the The Serpent and you've lived
[11:48] hallelujah oh thank God that's what our
[11:51] life is is built upon Hallelujah the
[11:53] revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[11:55] amen he condemned sin that's what the
[11:57] cross did it condemns sin so the Bible
[12:00] says we are now under no condemnation
[12:03] let's all say no condemnation can we no
[12:06] condemnation there's no condemnation
[12:08] remember that's a damnatory sentence
[12:10] there's no damnatory sentence to you as
[12:13] you walk in the spirit as you're led by
[12:15] the Holy Spirit as you're believing in
[12:17] Jesus Christ there's no damnatory
[12:20] sentence he he won't look at you and say
[12:22] I never knew you he'll look at you and
[12:24] say I knew you Hallelujah well done I
[12:26] knew you well you are my bride amen you
[12:29] wer just a servant you were my bride HJ
[12:33] that's what that's what the Bible says
[12:34] there's no condemnation there's no
[12:36] damnatory sentence hallelujah amen and
[12:39] that's what Jesus told us in Matthew 7
[12:41] the reason he looks on the workers of
[12:43] iniquity they never knew him they did
[12:46] they had gifts of God but and they could
[12:49] yield to God for temporary times but
[12:51] they didn't do the will of God but see
[12:53] we're the opposite of that we do the
[12:55] will of God Amen Hallelujah we don't
[12:58] work in it inity when we see iniquity in
[12:59] our lives we say God forgive me I don't
[13:02] want to work it that's right amen I
[13:04] don't want to constantly do iniquity I
[13:06] want to overcome
[13:08] iniquity and if you'll help me do it
[13:10] I'll do it by your grace amen amen cuz
[13:13] the Bible said I can do all things
[13:15] through Christen I can't do all things
[13:17] by my own effort but I can do all things
[13:20] through
[13:20] Christ praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[13:23] not through my works not not by any
[13:25] Works lest any man should boast
[13:27] Hallelujah but it's the power of Christ
[13:30] Hal Hallelujah he said you abide in me
[13:33] I'll abide in you Hallelujah and ask
[13:35] what you will it shall be done for you
[13:38] hallah
[13:39] amen now verse four that the
[13:41] righteousness of the law might be
[13:43] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[13:46] flesh but after the spirit so in the New
[13:49] Testament we have a power to fulfill the
[13:51] righteousness of Christ when we freely
[13:54] choose to to crucify sin and walk after
[13:58] the Spirit we fulfill the righteousness
[14:01] of the law hallelujah we're walking uh
[14:04] in in obedience to the Holy Spirit In
[14:06] other words we're living a righteous
[14:08] life we're living as we ought to yes
[14:11] we're presented sin or righteousness and
[14:13] because of our love for Jesus because of
[14:15] our appreciation that he died for our
[14:17] sins we choose Holiness amen Jesus said
[14:20] if you love me keep my commands
[14:23] hallelujah it's a love affair Hallelujah
[14:26] and that's how we fulfill the righteous
[14:28] of the La we love the Lord Our God with
[14:30] all of our heart soul mind and strength
[14:34] amen I just feel so discouraged
[14:36] sometimes people say you're legalist and
[14:37] all these things and no if if you're
[14:39] really in love with Jesus you just want
[14:41] to do do what's right that's right your
[14:43] motivation is love Hallelujah he said if
[14:46] you love me how many love him here today
[14:48] Hallelujah then you want to know his
[14:50] commands you want to do his commands God
[14:52] that's right you want to please him you
[14:54] don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit as
[14:55] Ephesians 4:30 says you don't want to
[14:57] grieve the Holy Spirit you want to obey
[14:59] the Holy Spirit yes amen and so that's
[15:02] how we walk in the righteousness of the
[15:04] law it's the Holy Spirit God has
[15:06] forgiven all of our sins and now we walk
[15:08] in the power of the Holy Spirit verse
[15:11] five for they that are after The Flesh
[15:12] do mind the things of the flesh but they
[15:15] that after the spirit the things of the
[15:17] of the spirit now we all had days where
[15:19] we're just walk in the Holy Spirit and
[15:21] almost all day how many know that's a
[15:22] great feel praise God amen amen but then
[15:24] there are certain days where we do have
[15:26] to we do we have we have to battle sin
[15:29] right even the Bible said Satan left
[15:31] Jesus for a season well that means he
[15:33] was coming back yes and that means some
[15:36] of us are going to go through difficult
[15:37] Seasons where it seems like Satan is
[15:39] right there all the time where he's got
[15:40] his demon powers right there don't be
[15:42] discouraged just realize you're in a
[15:44] season Hallelujah draw nigh to God he'll
[15:46] draw nigh to you Hallelujah resist Satan
[15:49] he shall flee hallelujah it's a Bible
[15:52] promise you've got a Bible thus say the
[15:54] Lord you mighty men and women Hallelujah
[15:56] we reached on the Mighty Men series last
[15:57] year we're Mighty through the power of
[16:00] God it's the it's the word of God that
[16:02] pulls down strongholds it's the word of
[16:04] God that helps us overcome addictions or
[16:06] or iniquity or depression or whatever it
[16:08] be it's the spirit of God that pulls
[16:10] that down and makes us free in Christ
[16:13] Jesus amenallah so we must not mind the
[16:17] things of the flesh that's why we come
[16:18] to church to get a new mind
[16:20] Hallelujah had a tough week that's fine
[16:23] but let's get our mind back on the
[16:24] things of God hallelujah right see
[16:27] sometimes we do mind the things the
[16:28] flesh but God the previous chapter he
[16:30] said I hate myself right Paul said that
[16:32] I'm a Wretched Man but yet I got no
[16:35] condemnation I Paradise one side I'm
[16:38] wretched one side I never sin in the
[16:40] first place praise God right the real me
[16:43] the part of me from my spiritual DNA
[16:45] from God never sin but I live in this
[16:47] flesh body because I have to have
[16:49] something to overcome I got to get some
[16:51] victory praise God I got to do something
[16:54] Hallelujah I got to bring uh the word of
[16:55] God into reality into my life I I have
[16:58] to manifest Christ I must be identified
[17:02] with Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I've
[17:04] got to overcome in my day Hallelujah we
[17:07] were called to overcome in this hour
[17:09] Hallelujah verse six for to be Carly
[17:11] minded is death but to be spiritually
[17:14] minded is life and
[17:17] peace
[17:19] Hallelujah so uh the emphasis I want to
[17:22] put on here is life and
[17:25] peace life and peace remember we were
[17:28] preaching on the book of Acts we'll get
[17:30] back to that Lord will yes I just been
[17:32] feeling this poll to Romans Lately by
[17:34] God's grace remember they were the
[17:36] apostles were in jail I believe it was
[17:37] chapter 5 and the angel broke them out I
[17:40] like how God breaks his people out of
[17:41] jail hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and
[17:44] they he said go what he said go into a
[17:47] cave and hide he said go back in the
[17:49] public and speak all the words of this
[17:52] life amen hallelujah I mean this is what
[17:56] this is the life of the believer it's a
[17:58] life of of Peace Hallelujah I want to
[18:02] just emphasize that you know recently I
[18:03] talked to a brother I'm going to try not
[18:04] to use as many names here I'm not going
[18:06] to I'm going to try not to address all
[18:08] the trolls I've been addressing the
[18:09] trolls a lot I'm going to try to address
[18:10] the trolls today okay they troll me all
[18:13] the
[18:14] time I'm going to try not to you you
[18:16] watch me brother amen okay you let me
[18:18] know say no trolls no trolls try not to
[18:22] address it it just WS on my heart mind
[18:23] sometimes I don't want to get any bad
[18:26] habits sometimes I feel like it's a
[18:27] warning of the ho Spirit but I don't
[18:28] want to I don't want to focus on the
[18:30] trolls today but you know um this idea
[18:32] of life and peace a young believer
[18:34] recently he and I were talking on the
[18:36] phone we talk for about an hour last
[18:37] week and uh he's uh he's fairly new to
[18:40] the message I'm going try not to say
[18:42] names
[18:43] here but he said uh you know uh some
[18:46] some some a sister Church these people
[18:49] say they got they just received the Holy
[18:51] Ghost and and they come into this
[18:53] brother's church and and and they're
[18:55] they're fresh in the message and they
[18:56] don't know about the Holy Ghost and uh
[18:58] these people that say they got the Holy
[19:00] Ghost are putting all this pressure on
[19:02] the church and people and and I know
[19:04] some of the situations very detail some
[19:06] of the people are going bound depression
[19:09] saying we don't have the Holy Ghost like
[19:10] these people because all these uh things
[19:13] wrong because these people coming in are
[19:15] bringing in all these uh Corrections and
[19:17] all the well this is how it worked for
[19:19] me this is how it worked for me you need
[19:21] to do this and you need to do that and
[19:22] church I just want to bring it out that
[19:24] uh I think people like that they're a
[19:26] little
[19:26] overzealous because it's not producing
[19:29] life and peace the gospel should produce
[19:32] life and peace that's right now is there
[19:34] an element of desperation yes you must
[19:36] have an element of desperation there's
[19:38] times God brings us to desperation amen
[19:41] but these people you know this this new
[19:43] church they fresh into the message and
[19:45] so forth and and and the last thing they
[19:47] need is depression right we got enough
[19:50] depressed people right yes and we can't
[19:54] decide when God's going to fill us with
[19:56] the Holy Ghost we can't speed up our

[21:41] chapter 8 by God's grace there's a
[21:43] certain time in season where the Holy
[21:45] Ghost Falls we just must be in
[21:48] position I was reading this morning in
[21:50] second Samuel David got out of a
[21:53] position that's why he fell with basba
[21:55] he was out of position right King Kings
[21:58] go out to war in the springtime yeah
[22:01] hallelujah holy ghost fi Saints keep
[22:04] battling in the war Hallelujah right the
[22:06] war of prayer hallelujah amen the war of
[22:10] worshiping God the spiritual warfare
[22:13] they take on the six pieces of the armor
[22:15] of God David left the war David was out
[22:18] of position we got to stay in position
[22:20] we got to fight the good fight of Faith
[22:23] hallelujah amen that's right I'm not
[22:26] saying you know me there's times we need
[22:28] uh
[22:29] vacations I need a vacation every now
[22:31] and then MH but Springtime was a time
[22:33] for battle you don't you don't go out
[22:36] without the king the king's Your
[22:38] Leader you don't go out to war without
[22:40] the King right but see when he was out
[22:43] of position that's when it happened
[22:45] that's when he became carnally minded
[22:47] and he saw a woman clean herself what is
[22:49] her name out of position but spiritual
[22:53] mindedness is life and peace hallelujah
[22:56] amen see if he would went out to war he
[22:57] would oh this is I have peace with God
[23:00] I'm doing exactly what God called me to
[23:01] do praise God right amen
[23:04] amen now verse seven because the carnal
[23:07] mind is enmity or hatred against God
[23:09] think about that the same man just said
[23:11] I'm a Wretched Man
[23:13] right remember he said earlier in
[23:15] chapter 7 I I bring myself into
[23:18] captivity to sin every time we sin and
[23:21] fall short of God's glory we brought
[23:23] ourselves into captivity we we've let
[23:25] ourselves be enslaved right prison yeah
[23:29] right and Paul said sometimes I do that
[23:31] I just love what he said he said
[23:33] sometimes I do things I hate may God
[23:35] help us to hate the sin that we're
[23:37] struggling
[23:38] with let us lay aside every weight and
[23:43] sin that so easily does be set us
[23:46] hallelujah amen yes it's hatred against
[23:51] God because why it is not subject to the
[23:54] law of God neither can be when we're
[23:57] walking with human thoughts you know
[23:59] will never obey the word of God that's
[24:01] how you know you're walking in the
[24:02] spirit when your mind is like no I got
[24:03] to obey the I got to obey the word
[24:05] what's the word say what's the Holy
[24:07] Ghost say what does God want me to do
[24:08] now you're walking in the spirit praise
[24:10] God but as long as you're Walk In the
[24:13] Flesh you cannot please God that's what
[24:16] the Bible says remember Hebrews
[24:20] 11 here it is in Romans 88 as well so
[24:23] then they there in the flesh cannot
[24:24] please God right right we know that as
[24:28] long as we're uh giving into sin or
[24:31] doing things that we hate we cannot
[24:33] please God but as soon as we confess I
[24:35] heard brother ra say this week as soon
[24:37] as the breath goes out of my lips and I
[24:39] say forgive me he said Jesus has
[24:41] forgiven me praise
[24:43] God that fast it has to be that fast
[24:46] remember in the prayer lines brother
[24:48] would tell them confess your sins now
[24:50] because once you get in the prayer line
[24:51] if you don't confess it then God can see
[24:53] it but as soon as it's confessed God
[24:55] don't see it anymore amen hallelujah
[24:58] praise God that's exactly
[25:01] right they that in the flesh cannot
[25:03] please God and we're not we're not
[25:05] legalist or trying to be perfect but we
[25:07] want to be mature hallelujah amen we
[25:09] want to obey the Lord we want to serve
[25:12] God we want to uh we want to have
[25:14] abundant fruit the Bible said if you
[25:16] abide in Christ you can have much fruit
[25:19] yes amen we want people we want the
[25:21] Saints and even Sinners and we want
[25:22] people around us to know we're
[25:23] Christians am we want to look at each
[25:25] other's life and say wow I can see the
[25:27] fruit of their lives amen I can see the
[25:31] the testimonies coming out of their
[25:32] lives amen hallelujah we we should be
[25:35] each one of us are a tree and as long as
[25:37] we're planted and drinking in the waters
[25:39] of Life we'll push out fruit in every
[25:41] season amen amen some Seasons we got to
[25:44] get pruned up a little bit right knows
[25:47] all about pruning have you pruned meel
[25:48] now gu knows about pruning praise God
[25:51] hopefully all all the rest of them can
[25:52] go over there and work and keep learning
[25:54] about pruning praise
[25:56] God but but there are seasons where
[25:58] we're going to be pruned but let's not
[26:00] be discouraged God's trying to he's
[26:02] trying to uh help us be more obedient
[26:04] remember Jesus learned obedience through
[26:07] the things he suffered if we're
[26:09] suffering it's a good sign God is
[26:11] helping us to obey the word of God
[26:13] hallelujah amen amen God doesn't want us
[26:15] to fall into complacency right right
[26:18] right where the word just doesn't impact
[26:20] us anymore we're not moved by the word
[26:22] of God anymore God doesn't want us to be
[26:24] complacent Hallelujah we cannot please
[26:27] God if we're operating in the
[26:30] flesh Hallelujah now verse n but if but
[26:33] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[26:35] spirit if I like that word if God always
[26:37] puts it in there there's all these
[26:39] conditional Promises of God if so be
[26:42] that the spirit of God dwell in you now
[26:44] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[26:46] he's none of
[26:48] his now church I I preached this before
[26:50] but you know this even the foolish
[26:52] virgin are his right right if a foolish
[26:56] virgin is able to be virgin to all the
[26:59] word that they know well then they must
[27:01] have the Holy Spirit in their minds
[27:04] right yes not their souls because if
[27:07] they had that they'd be wise virgins
[27:09] Jesus said I'm bringing you rest to your
[27:11] soul right yes they they couldn't have
[27:14] that the Old Testament because the blood
[27:15] of BS and goats right but a foolish bir
[27:18] so so what I'm saying is that some
[27:20] preachers use this and say not even the
[27:21] foolish virgins are saved nonsense right
[27:26] nonsense what about the thief on the
[27:28] cross that was under the law right you
[27:31] said how is the the the how is the thief
[27:33] Jesus's because Jesus said today you'll
[27:35] be with me amen Jesus Took ownership of
[27:39] him right there and says you'll be with
[27:41] me Hallelujah you're mine hallelujah
[27:44] amen because the spirit of Christ was
[27:45] working on him the spirit of Christ was
[27:47] on him enough to say this man's holy we
[27:50] deserve this he don't deserve that see
[27:52] so the the same Thief was belonging to
[27:55] Jesus
[27:56] Hallelujah the spirit of Christ was
[27:58] working on them hallelujah amen that's
[28:01] right see CU in their minds they've
[28:04] obeyed they've accepted the word of
[28:06] God and the Bible said in Ezekiel 36
[28:09] they have a new heart remember there's
[28:11] three steps to being filled with Holy
[28:13] Ghost new heart new spirit my spirit
[28:17] amen so this deep on the cross truly had
[28:20] a new heart because he wasn't mocking
[28:22] Christ so see he belonged to Christ amen
[28:26] amenallah
[28:29] alah he belonged to Jesus so much that
[28:31] Jesus said you'll be with me in Paradise
[28:33] today praise God yes amen hallelujah
[28:37] amen oh that's a wonderful scripture
[28:39] there by the grace of the Lord now I
[28:41] just have a scripture on my heart and
[28:42] I'm trying to remember what it was going
[28:44] to there by God's grace sorry can't
[28:46] think of it
[28:47] now now if any man have not the spirit
[28:50] of Christ he's none of his we want to
[28:53] belong to Jesus praise God Amen the
[28:56] spirit of Christ work working in our
[28:58] hearts and lives maybe I'll think of it
[29:00] here later Romans 8:10 and if Christ be
[29:02] in you the body is dead because of sin
[29:05] but the spirit is life because of
[29:08] righteousness amen amen amen so see your
[29:12] body is dead because of the sin we must
[29:14] not feed it sinful desires but the spear
[29:17] is life because of righteousness which
[29:19] is right doing the spirit's always going
[29:22] to tell you to do what's right yes amen
[29:24] hallelujah oh my it's beautiful verse 11
[29:27] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[29:29] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[29:31] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[29:34] also Quicken your mortal bodies by a
[29:36] spirit that dwelleth within you praise
[29:38] God Amen what a promise if the spirit
[29:42] that was in Jesus is in you we like that
[29:44] song it will Quicken your mortal body
[29:46] hallelujah amen amen what a blessing to
[29:50] know and remember church I'm going to go
[29:52] back to this cuz I was studying this go
[29:53] to Romans 6 remember
[29:55] this if you have been baptized in the
[29:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are
[30:00] promised a
[30:02] resurrection amen all this ties together
[30:07] Hallelujah Romans 6 4 and 5 therefore we
[30:11] are buried with him by baptism into
[30:13] death that like as Christ was raised up
[30:14] from the dead by the glory of the father
[30:16] even so we also should walk in the
[30:18] newness of
[30:19] Life yes for we have been planted
[30:22] together in the likeness of his death we
[30:24] shall also be in the likeness of his
[30:26] resurrection amen amen so baptism
[30:29] represents the
[30:31] death Jesus paid for all of our sins we
[30:34] we died to ourselves just like Jesus
[30:36] died for us but then Jesus was raised
[30:39] and so will you be raised if you go down
[30:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:43] you'll be raised in the name of the the
[30:44] Lord Jesus by the spirit of Jesus
[30:46] hallelujah amen like I put on that video
[30:49] yesterday brother ra said I command you
[30:51] he said in the thus sayith the Lord he
[30:53] said in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:55] Christ he said if you were baptized and
[30:57] father and Holy Ghost I command you to
[30:59] be reapz in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:02] Christ that's a man that knows God
[31:04] hallelujah amen that can say thus sayth
[31:07] the Lord and use the name of the Lord
[31:09] and he's got a scriptural foundation for
[31:12] it hallelujah amen it takes us back to
[31:15] the Bible Acts 19 where they were
[31:17] re-baptized for the baptism of the Lord
[31:20] Jesus Christ amen amen amen so we get
[31:24] this idea here Church Hallelujah you are
[31:28] his if Christ is in you either even
[31:31] through repentance or sanctification we
[31:34] call it justification is repenting
[31:35] you're saved you're forgiven
[31:37] sanctification you're getting Sanctified
[31:39] your daily habits are getting cleaned
[31:40] out you're getting a new mind to serve
[31:42] God and then the baptism of the Holy
[31:44] Ghost God's Spirit dwelling within you
[31:45] you belong to Christ at all three stages
[31:48] yes in fact if you're a true true child
[31:51] of God and your name was on that book
[31:53] before the foundation of the world you
[31:55] always belong to God hallelujah amen
[31:57] you eternally belong to God because he
[31:59] put your name on The Book of Life
[32:01] Hallelujah am and if we're Holy Ghost
[32:03] filled the Lamb's Book of Life amen that
[32:05] other wonderful section amen amen
[32:07] hallelujah now remember what I was
[32:09] thinking of it was 1 Corinthians 15 so
[32:11] keep your spot
[32:14] there I was reminded of this this week
[32:16] uh 1 Corinthians
[32:23] 15 Paul summarizes the gospel so
[32:28] when someone gets saved they need to
[32:30] hear the simple
[32:31] gospel right when I got saved you know I
[32:34] didn't know the message or anything like
[32:35] that I didn't know the message of
[32:36] brother I got saved at a athletes
[32:38] Athletes In Action conference brother
[32:40] Preston that's I wasn't even the message
[32:42] I went down there I was all these I play
[32:44] football in college I was with all these
[32:45] football guys and I seen them raise
[32:46] their hands I'm like God forgive me I
[32:48] need to serve God I repented of my sins
[32:50] right there but I belong to God right
[32:52] there praise God but there was more God
[32:55] wanted to show me praise God thank God
[32:57] for brother Simon
[33:00] Hallelujah now First Corinthians 15 but
[33:03] when you get saved you need this we we
[33:05] need just simple gospel message gospel
[33:07] means good news yes amen see that's why
[33:10] I think many people have fallen away
[33:11] around the message they're taught don't
[33:13] cut your hair don't wear shorts for the
[33:15] brothers don't grow long hair Brothers
[33:18] don't smoke they're taught all
[33:20] this but they're they're never taught
[33:23] the
[33:24] gospel right see they're kind of like
[33:27] fear fear serve God a base of fear I
[33:30] mean it's good to know God's commands
[33:32] But first you got to have a new heart
[33:33] praise God that's right if you just
[33:36] serve god with the Heart of Stone it's
[33:38] just going to be the law all over again
[33:40] that's right right it's just the law the
[33:42] law the law but once you fall in love
[33:44] with him now you got a new heart now you
[33:45] want to you want to obey praise God
[33:48] that's right and I mean I I don't blame
[33:51] preachers and parents tell your kids the
[33:53] word of God tell your kids the word of
[33:54] God but make sure they know the good
[33:56] news
[33:58] the good news that Christ died to save
[34:00] Sinners Hallelujah and we're all Sinners
[34:03] we've all fall of God's grace but God
[34:06] gives us hope if we believe in him he's
[34:07] forgiven our sins and we pass from Death
[34:10] unto life
[34:11] Hallelujah good news in the gospel

[34:16] gives us this a wonderful it's just a
[34:19] summary of The

[34:41] us all things and brother Ram lays out
[34:43] salvation by the blood we're all saved
[34:45] by the blood whether you're Presbyterian
[34:46] or Baptist he said we all find
[34:48] everything in common at the
[34:50] cross amen hallelujah now at the end he
[34:54] brings it he brings it to well now we're
[34:56] established church churches he said but
[34:58] now if if we're just serving God by
[35:00] tradition said if Jesus was here he'd be
[35:03] throwing over some tables with some whip
[35:05] cords and some rope

[49:14] wisdom in that you know there's all

[49:18] everything right in our lives but let's
[49:20] focus on what's most important praise
[49:22] God you know I guess the reason I'm
[49:23] saying that is cuz she would by the end
[49:25] of the year she feel like she failed why
[49:27] didn't get to all these n but what if
[49:29] you got to two or three right what if
[49:31] you really got victory in two or three
[49:33] those areas amen amen let's look at the
[49:36] good that God's done amen let's remember
[49:39] some of these victories come on Joshua

[50:00] spirit the holy spirit is leading us to
[50:04] mortify the Deeds of the flesh I'm
[50:06] looking at the time here so yeah
[50:09] okay Hallelujah you know that the spirit
[50:12] will always lead you to Die daily same
[50:15] man that wrote Die daily in Corinthians
[50:17] he wrote this here mortify the Deeds of
[50:19] your flesh take up your cross daily and
[50:22] follow
[50:24] him now last Sunday I ended with the
[50:26] joint a thought hope you enjoyed that by
[50:28] God's grace this week I'm going to I
[50:30] felt led as I was listening this week to
[50:33] brother I want to skip down to Romans
[50:35] 8:28 I want to close with a few I know
[50:37] I'm saying closed pretty early aren't I
[50:39] what's going on
[50:40] brother nothing I'm trying to watch the
[50:42] CL Romans 8:28 for we know that all
[50:45] things work together for good to them
[50:47] that love God yes Amen to them who are
[50:50] called according to his purpose same man
[50:53] that said I hate things I do I'm a
[50:56] Wretched
[50:57] Man yet I have no condemnation now he
[51:00] says all things work together for for
[51:03] good even his struggles would work
[51:05] together for good amen right like that I
[51:09] wrote down some thoughts here I was just
[51:12] praying up here I thought oh that's
[51:13] right I want to share with a few of
[51:14] these thoughts God even uses our
[51:17] mistakes right to glorify God
[51:20] Amen brother Ram said Moses sent out the
[51:22] two spies he said Joshua I'm sorry the
[51:25] 12 spies he said Joshua learned from
[51:27] that and he didn't send out 12
[51:29] Spies he learned from it so even our
[51:32] mistakes right even the mistakes of the
[51:34] Prophet can help us to do what's right
[51:37] amen hallelujah amen let's look at some
[51:41] other examples I thought even Elisha
[51:44] when he died you know he Elisha didn't
[51:46] get raptured up into heaven he died of
[51:47] an awful
[51:49] disease but even that worked out to good
[51:51] his bones were laying there and they
[51:53] threw a dead man on his bones
[51:55] and the anointing that was still on that
[51:58] body brought this man back to life and
[52:01] that fulfilled the 16 Miracles Elisha
[52:04] had to have because he had a double
[52:05] portion of God's spirit so even death
[52:08] even in death there's a purpose in that
[52:10] all things work together for good
[52:13] Hallelujah even his death all the
[52:15] sufferings and the place where he was
[52:17] laid everything has a purpose and church
[52:20] if all that has a purpose what about us
[52:21] being here today am like I tell Naomi be
[52:26] all the time God sent you 5,000 miles
[52:28] just to our church of all the
[52:30] churches it could have been that many
[52:32] churches why here well cuz God has a
[52:35] purpose we're called according to his
[52:37] purpose PR amen like I told you last
[52:40] week I could have went to AIO state to
[52:41] play to run track instead of football at
[52:43] aan well God had a purpose I had to come
[52:46] to akan I didn't know akan from anything
[52:48] on the world you know I guess it was a
[52:50] Pennsylvania accur too I didn't know
[52:51] that it could have been any place but
[52:53] God has a purpose and everything will
[52:55] work together for good if you love God
[52:58] how love God
[52:59] today just love God obey God keep God's
[53:03] commands believe the gospel and
[53:05] everything will work out for your good
[53:07] Hallelujah am
[53:12] amen hallelujah there's a we've been
[53:14] reading through the book of generations
[53:16] thank you again brother Jose I keep
[53:17] thanking you till we get done and I'll
[53:19] thank you that I'm sure one of the
[53:20] brothers said he said uh every time we
[53:23] were sick he said we call brother for
[53:25] any little thing and he said God
[53:27] answered all his prayers he said but we
[53:29] learned to lean too much on brother
[53:31] Brandon he said that's why I think God
[53:33] took brother brandom off the scene so
[53:36] even so all things work together for
[53:37] good God lets our prophet die in a car
[53:39] accident 1965 but this brother says it
[53:41] taught us to lean on the holy spirit
[53:44] amen and not so much on a man and the
[53:46] church say yes am
[53:48] amen all things work together for
[53:52] good Hallelujah
[53:58] remember David's Disobedience he brought
[53:59] the ark up this is one of the most fresh
[54:00] lyia sh with me but even in that Aza
[54:03] died how awful that was but as part of
[54:07] that David he learned to obey the
[54:09] scriptures the next
[54:11] time the ark at least the ark then the
[54:13] ark at least finally got into its
[54:15] rightful place in Jerusalem because of
[54:17] the mistake and then obad Ed got blessed
[54:20] for three months right in the midst of
[54:23] mistakes there's always a blessing
[54:25] praise God there's always a
[54:28] purpose God wants us to learn God wants
[54:30] us to see everything works together for
[54:33] good Hallelujah a I texting he was say
[54:35] saying how Ecclesiastes has been meant a
[54:37] lot to him lately amen I love that book
[54:41] you got to have a spiritual mind though
[54:42] when you read that he'll say like there
[54:44] was nothing good in anything I did Under
[54:46] the Sun yet the Bible says we should be
[54:48] zealous for good works yes right right
[54:51] so he's coming from an old man
[54:53] perspective of he wasted a lot of years
[54:55] yeah right so we got to take we got to
[54:57] right divide that but I love what
[54:59] brother brother Austin was sharing
[55:01] there and I think I'm just going to read
[55:03] it I'm going to go to Ecclesiastes 12
[55:05] you know you would think look at all the
[55:07] mistakes of Solomon's life the idolatry
[55:09] the wars remember he bow two adversaries
[55:12] because he he didn't obey God God raised
[55:15] up two adversaries on purpose and God
[55:17] told him I'm going to raise these two
[55:18] men up because of the evils you've done
[55:20] with idolatry multiplying wies and then
[55:22] even God uses that as a type it was a
[55:24] mistake but God you all things work
[55:26] together for good amen please ask you
[55:31] 12 and this is what I'm talking about
[55:33] you
[55:34] know sometimes the enemy tries to
[55:36] distract us away from the Simplicity of
[55:37] the
[55:38] Gospel which we love the Simplicity and
[55:40] we also want the deeper things of God
[55:43] like like Paul said Church what we want
[55:44] is the whole counsel of God lord don't
[55:46] leave any of your wisdom out I want all

[57:14] finally feel feel like preaching
[57:16] now like I'm trying to feel religious
[57:19] now here's brother's prayer after
[57:22] someone died in a plane crash think of
[57:23] that we've had that in the message
[57:25] there's some brothers out west that died
[57:26] in a prayer in a plane crash years ago
[57:28] when I first come in the message it was
[57:29] a pastor and his sons died in Arizona in
[57:34] a plane crash and when I first come in
[57:36] the message brother Preston that was
[57:37] hard for me
[57:38] to hard for me to understand all like
[57:41] all I knew was wow revelation God sent
[57:44] the prophet Miracles all and then you
[57:46] get this news you're like wait what I
[57:49] was just a
[57:50] baby babies don't understand
[57:53] everything neither do lot of 43 year old
[57:55] babies I'm
[57:58] 43 but this just meant a lot to me
[58:00] brother this is from ex expectancy 1952
[58:04] in Battle Creek
[58:07] Michigan he said the brother has been in
[58:09] an airplane crash and been killed it's
[58:12] Ben and Florence
[58:14] Smith and then he said here's special
[58:16] prayer brother BR a man who's in the
[58:18] hospital that's only 42 that's right
[58:20] let's bow our heads and pray for these
[58:21] now the reason I'm reading this is
[58:23] because brother Brandon brings out
[58:24] Romans 828 so I want you to see how a
[58:26] prophet of God how would he bring out
[58:28] Romans 8:28 in the moments of Unexpected
[58:31] death or things that are just hard to
[58:34] understand how could all things work
[58:36] together for good to them that love the
[58:38] Lord he said heavenly father I pray you
[58:41] look down here on this desk this
[58:43] afternoon actually you know what I can
[58:44] put these quotes up here so then you
[58:46] guys can see it you can read along that
[58:48] would help you I don't know I like to do
[58:51] that many
[58:53] times along with
[58:55] me and you see these people
[58:58] oh I think of that bereaved home of that
[59:02] man being killed in that crash God all
[59:03] things work together for good to them
[59:05] that love you he just died in a plane
[59:07] crash and he thinks of that home what
[59:09] does that home feel like right now right
[59:11] after the plane crash and he quotes
[59:13] Romans
[59:16] 8:28 trusting that his soul was right
[59:19] with you and today he wouldn't return if
[59:21] he had
[59:22] to think of that stepen after he got
[59:24] Stone he would not have come back if he
[59:27] could if he was asked to he'd take his
[59:30] choice he'd stay where he's at I pray
[59:32] that he was saved Lord that you'll
[59:33] Comfort all his loved ones you think you
[59:35] know let's say he had some moments
[59:37] before the he knew the plane was going
[59:39] down do you think he probably cried out
[59:40] to God I would hope so if he was trained
[59:43] in the Bible or the message or
[59:45] something God gives opportunities where
[59:47] we can make things
[59:49] right I pray that you'll Comfort all his
[59:51] loved ones and let them know that he
[59:53] said I would not have you in your
[59:54] brethren concerning those things that
[59:56] are that those that are asleep for we
[59:57] believe that Christ died and rose again
[59:59] the third day even so them that sleep in
[1:00:01] Christ should God bring with him that's
[1:00:03] first Thessalonians 4 how is brother
[1:00:06] going to understand this how's he going
[1:00:07] to help the people Romans 8:28 and also
[1:00:09] first Thessalonians 4 you'll see your
[1:00:11] loved ones again hallelujah amen amen
[1:00:14] amen we believe that Lord he said
[1:00:17] wherefore Comfort one another with with
[1:00:19] these words you'll see them again
[1:00:20] Hallelujah and we believe it's the truth
[1:00:23] and if this Earthly Tabernacle we Des
[1:00:24] all we have one already waiting to move
[1:00:26] into one not made with hands but God
[1:00:28] himself has made us a body that when
[1:00:30] these Spirits shall be set free from
[1:00:32] this one we go to that glorious body
[1:00:34] realizing that one day that the blood of
[1:00:36] the bulls and goats and sheep covered
[1:00:37] sin but the blood of Jesus Christ takes
[1:00:39] it away and we go straight into the
[1:00:41] presence of
[1:00:43] God from a plane accident right into the
[1:00:46] presence of God amen amen think they
[1:00:48] were sad about it I mean you might had a
[1:00:49] little fear in that moment everybody
[1:00:50] would have been fearful in a plane crash
[1:00:52] but they go right from that moment the
[1:00:54] the moment of the impact right to the
[1:00:56] presence of God Amen
[1:01:01] Hallelujah he said how we thank you for
[1:01:03] this oh no wonder we can stand Fearless
[1:01:05] Lord how many want to be Fearless today

[1:01:09] fear about 2024 if these government
[1:01:12] leaders did this in 2020 what are they
[1:01:14] going to do now I don't know right we we
[1:01:17] have to trust God we have to be Fearless

[1:01:22] the vision the word of God we have the
[1:01:24] Assurance of the Holy Spirit and he's
[1:01:26] here to vindicate and prove God's power
[1:01:28] to us that he loves us and is with us in
[1:01:30] these dark hours of the closing of the
[1:01:32] world's history this other man here Lord
[1:01:34] in the hospital I pray you heal him may
[1:01:35] your spirit be upon him and deliver him
[1:01:37] this afternoon and may his testimony

[1:02:39] brother R always wanted to preach
[1:02:41] marriage and divorce listen to the tapes
[1:02:42] he always wanted to preach it even in
[1:02:43] the the early 60s he'd say one of these
[1:02:46] days I'm going to preach it and God
[1:02:47] allowed him to preach it before he took
[1:02:48] him off the scene I love that because
[1:02:51] God will not take you till he's finished
[1:02:52] with you amen amen how many think God
[1:02:56] has something for you to do left right
[1:02:58] right some of us are younger there must
[1:03:00] be a lot for us to do praise God by the
[1:03:02] grace of the
[1:03:04] Lord may God do great things before our
[1:03:07] Lord comes that's saving Souls that's
[1:03:10] filling people with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:12] that's laying hands on the sick and they
[1:03:13] shall recover hallelujah amen amen
[1:03:16] that's one of the five identifications
[1:03:18] of the church brother Mark 16 in action
[1:03:20] that's one of the five identifications
[1:03:21] you got the right Doctrine the right
[1:03:23] baptism uh the signs wonders and
[1:03:25] miracles I forget the other two but
[1:03:26] brother says that's what she's got she's

[1:03:30] Holy Ghost follows us cuz we're
[1:03:32] Believers amen amen
[1:03:34] amen now here's another one I'll just
[1:03:37] I'll finish with this one because I'm
[1:03:38] almost on my hour I got two minutes left
[1:03:39] on my hour I'm going to try to keep my
[1:03:41] word here I never want to break my word
[1:03:44] I mean you understand what I'm saying
[1:03:46] what I'm saying is sometimes I wish to
[1:03:47] close early but the Holy Spirit takes us
[1:03:48] a little longer and notice I said the
[1:03:50] holy
[1:03:51] spirit amen cuz you would know if it
[1:03:54] wasn't the Holy Spirit we'd be
[1:03:56] sinning right he'd be sitting there like
[1:03:58] come on brother you're sinning or you're
[1:03:59] preaching false Doctrine right right so
[1:04:01] that's how we know it's the Holy Spirit
[1:04:03] if you're being blessed it's the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit if I'm preaching false Doctrine
[1:04:07] it's the devil I should have closed
[1:04:08] early but how many know I'm teaching the
[1:04:10] truth today by yes amen by the grace of
[1:04:12] the
[1:04:13] Lord so I just thought here here's a uh
[1:04:15] now this brother was a deacon at at uh
[1:04:18] brand
[1:04:19] Tabernacle so before brother preaches
[1:04:21] this and brother BR calls this one of
[1:04:22] the highlights of his message here
[1:04:24] uh Blasphemous names this is one of the
[1:04:27] tapes that I believe I'm not mistaken he
[1:04:29] kept he kept secret and they released it
[1:04:31] after he died there was a 11 brother
[1:04:33] Morris show me that picture I got on my
[1:04:34] phone somewhere it was such a such a
[1:04:37] direct harsh sermon he said I'm not
[1:04:39] releasing this to the
[1:04:40] public because it was so uh against
[1:04:42] denominational Spirits right which is
[1:04:44] the Antichrist Spirit right but he said
[1:04:47] one of the first things I want to
[1:04:49] say the passing of our gracious brother
[1:04:51] Taylor while we were gone so brother
[1:04:54] brother Ram wasn't there for the funeral
[1:04:55] brother Neville did the funeral brother
[1:04:56] Taylor had been coming to church for
[1:04:58] years and years all of us knew I'm sure
[1:04:59] but if there' be some strangers here it
[1:05:01] was that precious Old Gentleman that
[1:05:03] always found you a seat to sit down
[1:05:06] brother Taylor last time I saw him now
[1:05:09] until I see him until I see him a young
[1:05:11] man he was standing there at the door
[1:05:14] about three or four Sundays ago he said
[1:05:15] I'd like to have some books brother
[1:05:17] brandom i' like to distribute these
[1:05:19] books think about that what's your last
[1:05:20] memory of some people that pass on
[1:05:22] what's your last memory the last ask
[1:05:24] memory of this man can I have some more
[1:05:26] books to pass out to people can I share
[1:05:29] the gospel a little more if God takes us
[1:05:31] early may that be one of our testimonies
[1:05:33] amen the last thing you remember about
[1:05:35] me I wanted to win souls I wanted people
[1:05:37] to hear the message I want them to know
[1:05:39] the same Jesus that I know praise God
[1:05:41] Amen what a beautiful Story the last
[1:05:44] thing he remembers can I have some more
[1:05:46] books to pass out to can you help me try
[1:05:49] to save some Souls that's
[1:05:53] precious he wasn't arguing about
[1:05:55] something right he wasn't arguing
[1:05:56] condemning brother Bram or something
[1:05:57] like that he was asking for books to
[1:06:00] save
[1:06:01] Souls what I understand he had diabetes
[1:06:03] and went in a coma and not knowing he
[1:06:05] had the diabetes when he died he never
[1:06:08] died he just went to be with the Lord
[1:06:09] Jesus talking to the soul right because
[1:06:12] death means separation right that's what
[1:06:14] brother's talking about and he was
[1:06:16] faithful a wonderful brother now think
[1:06:18] about this all things were together for
[1:06:20] good and these are the last words a
[1:06:22] prophet would say about you like think
[1:06:24] about this if this was you a faithful
[1:06:27] wonderful brother always mindful of
[1:06:29] other
[1:06:30] people like I I remember when my
[1:06:32] grandmother Garza Julia Garza died
[1:06:35] everybody that got up there to say a
[1:06:36] word about her said every time you left
[1:06:38] her house she gave you food or gave you
[1:06:40] money or gave you something every time
[1:06:42] you left her house she was always giving
[1:06:44] you something on the way
[1:06:45] out that was her testimony she and was
[1:06:48] faithful to church took her family to
[1:06:50] church all these
[1:06:51] things and that's very similar to this
[1:06:54] brother
[1:06:55] here always mindful of other people see
[1:06:58] cuz why he had eternal life right when
[1:07:01] you have eternal life you're mindful of
[1:07:02] other people you don't live for yourself
[1:07:05] you live for others how many want to do
[1:07:06] that my God Amen I like to hear those
[1:07:08] amens
[1:07:11] here and you know maybe when we cross
[1:07:14] over the bar wouldn't it be nice to see
[1:07:15] brother Taylor there and he'd find us a
[1:07:17] place to sit down on the other
[1:07:19] side oh if he's a deacon in life he'll
[1:07:22] be a deacon afterlife sound like Samuel
[1:07:24] he was a prophet in life he was a
[1:07:25] prophet after life he told Saul you'll
[1:07:28] be with me tomorrow I wonder if there's
[1:07:29] deacons in
[1:07:30] heaven Hallelujah I think in
[1:07:33] commemoration of brother Taylor I wasn't
[1:07:35] here to speak it with brother Neville at
[1:07:36] his funeral but I want to say a word of
[1:07:37] my appreciation to his widow sister
[1:07:39] Taylor iose is here somewhere this
[1:07:41] morning bless her loyal
[1:07:44] heart so we see a man who's always
[1:07:46] mindful of others and we see a loyal
[1:07:48] wife
[1:07:50] MH brother Taylor one day he said come
[1:07:52] up and see me I got a little Lake dug up
[1:07:56] here put some fish in it so you come up
[1:07:58] and fish always mindful of somebody else
[1:08:02] and there was someone mindful of him
[1:08:04] that was Christ to give him
[1:08:06] salvation Hallelujah that's that's the
[1:08:08] only reason anything good can be in our
[1:08:10] lives is because of what Jesus did for
[1:08:12] us amen I think in commemoration yet for
[1:08:16] this church as it gathers in the body
[1:08:17] this morning let us Stand Together bow
[1:08:19] our heads before God our heavenly father
[1:08:21] we as human beings this morning and the
[1:08:23] comers to this place and worship thy
[1:08:24] great hand has moved Among Us and taken
[1:08:27] from us one of our precious brothers who
[1:08:29] we love and know that thou did love him
[1:08:32] and you had a reason for this Lord all
[1:08:35] this Lord or it would not have happened
[1:08:37] in this way knowing that our Bible tells
[1:08:40] us that all things work together for
[1:08:42] good to them that love God and that he
[1:08:46] did a man dies of diabetes didn't know
[1:08:48] he had diabetes but all things work
[1:08:51] together for good to them that love the
[1:08:53] Lord there's a certain coworker I have
[1:08:56] and uh she was telling me how her dad
[1:08:57] passed young I think it was
[1:08:59] 52
[1:09:02] young and uh in the story you know their
[1:09:05] family was
[1:09:07] poor and they're they're I think they're
[1:09:09] Catholic I'm not
[1:09:11] mistaken and brother had a lot of
[1:09:13] success praying for the Catholic how
[1:09:14] many heard that on the table especially
[1:09:16] listen to Seven Seals brother talks
[1:09:17] about the Catholics had faith in brother
[1:09:19] Ram's gift they had confidence in
[1:09:21] brother Ram's gift and God heard many of
[1:09:22] the catholic's prayers
[1:09:25] which is interesting but in the story
[1:09:27] they were on hard times and all of a
[1:09:29] sudden uh the husband died and they
[1:09:31] found out after the autopsy he died of
[1:09:33] cancer he never let them
[1:09:35] know so the the wife is like there goes
[1:09:39] my money he he's he's the bread winner
[1:09:42] just out of nowhere he just he wouldn't
[1:09:43] go to the hospital act like everything
[1:09:45] was okay just I'm a little sick today
[1:09:47] died of cancer he you know uh and then
[1:09:51] the little he had little daughters they
[1:09:53] didn't have Dad anymore and I'm just
[1:09:55] struggling along for I think it was like
[1:09:57] 6 months or something like that just
[1:09:58] struggling along and especially
[1:09:59] financially they're really struggling
[1:10:01] like what about the house what about
[1:10:02] this how are we going to make it out of
[1:10:03] this and relying on everybody else and
[1:10:05] then one day in the mail they got a
[1:10:06] check in the mail for half a million
[1:10:07] dollars from a life insurance
[1:10:11] policy and I thought wow what a good
[1:10:13] example of all things work together for
[1:10:15] good to them that love the Lord the man
[1:10:17] and he was a Catholic
[1:10:18] man so apparently once he got sick he
[1:10:22] took out insurance policy to take care
[1:10:24] of his family he didn't want to go
[1:10:25] through all the uh the chemo and
[1:10:27] everything like that and he wanted his
[1:10:30] family to be taken care of I thought
[1:10:31] that's a pretty Gallant thing to do to
[1:10:34] make sure his family's taken care of now
[1:10:36] he might have got a couple extra years
[1:10:37] you know on the the chemo treatments but
[1:10:40] you know to each his own right each his
[1:10:43] own I just thought that's another good
[1:10:45] example of all things work together for
[1:10:47] good to them that love God and like said
[1:10:49] do you think that man if he's in heaven
[1:10:51] if he's in heaven do you think he' want
[1:10:53] to come back back here no there's no way
[1:10:57] once you have a taste of eternal life
