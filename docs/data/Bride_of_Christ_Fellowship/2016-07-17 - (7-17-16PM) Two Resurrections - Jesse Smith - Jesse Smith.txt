down since I laid my burdens dead I'm sorry got a special time so that's it cuz he burns not assist or any kind of my gosh Kings not a lot of walk land our church is about a long walk listen that burns down now let's see this morning in Daniel E house now I walk into church and tonight and I realized I was singing this song I guess I was confirmed for him for Jesse just probably one equipped oh the Hospice's many your school by the workers who fish great a load on the Horvath's to give a stir but and to reach out to others to work in the fuse together Lucy but how could they hear you we

walls all right this is write the word freeze got hos other higher they're probably good thing I did it raising I think metal or appreciate that brother very Scott let's not open of our Bibles to Revelation chapter 20 I spent a little bit of time on this a few Wednesday's ago by like to spend more time on two resurrections like that I preset tonight by the grace of the Lord and it ties exactly n you know with this morning's message that's why i want to make sure i bring it out here by the grace of the Lord so Revelation chapter 20 and I think it's believe its first four so I got my Bible here yes revelation 20 verse 44 they're saying that I saw Thrones and they SAT upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshipped the Beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they live and reign with Christ thousand years but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years a minutes how will the word of Prayer pivot on your heart just thinking on it to God as we pray I'm going to be a part of that first resurrection I like to be a part of that by God's grace living for that with all my heart let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for tonight again for privileged people order to be gathered in your presence here God for you bless this reading if I were Lord come and break for the word before us or that's when the two on the road and once they got off the road in the little tent their Lord or home that's when they recognize who you were where they got that little room Lord God Father we know that's the type of the third Pole dear God going into a little room privately with Jesus and there you reveal yourself in a little room dear God so just sore make that real to us tonight or if you reveal yourself to us tonight it or may help us to serve you better go or got it I know will or is it ties in with this morning's message we all want to be wise virgins Lord so help us jesus to to Lord fulfill these scriptures Lord and I know you will as we humble ourselves and pray in Jesus Christ's name everybody said hey I bless you mean see that face guy brother bad guy have a little sideshow so whatever you're ready cutters hdmi tutor so let's look at this talking you're like assembly trying to keep at a forty-five minutes so it's 430 right now so we'll try to end it 5 15 by the restored I just one look at this the to resurrection the not sure why that's on there okay by God's grace we have two resurrections and we doing a lot of reading here from the scripture then I'm going to be what I plan to do because I didn't get this fully done with all the quotes what I plan to do is go through this and then I want to take a look at the white throne judgment a few things by the Rams said about that now I want to go through the remaining quote that just have a few more quotes from this morning's message for you pre-shop three kinds of believers and four classes I want to kind of look at that little more my god Tracy for the hose I did you a chance to check your email did you get this power point that I sent to you okay big guy step okay thank you sir thanks for let me know my vote has a new way to email so i didn't i didn't know that tried to figure that out so thanks for let me know that sister this morning in a row Scott's wife there's Scott's mom was taking pictures of my slides all the way in the back there so hopefully it was a blessing she said it was a real blessing to hurt her brother Scott came up in naming afterwards he said I really enjoyed these last few messages well Jessie it's really showing us how Abraham she needs to live we don't want to be like locked would it be like Abraham got this no Scott that's the same thing I've been thinking you know the more we look at it I'm over them closer to the word and look at Abraham's life versus last night the more we see where Abraham's seed praise God the fray bruh have seen that we gotta hang on for all 25 years or however long it's going to be can we see the body change villari so not to be with us and help us now I just want to start with this here I want to start with this and show you the first resurrection on the second resurrection now as you know if you get and I'm going to step down here if you know if we are part of this first resurrection I actually in another slide i turn the arrow upside down because you actually go up first resurrection is up and then you live up here with Christ chill and glory in heaven through these and then we come back at the Battle of Armageddon walk upon and ashes the wicked and then we spend all this time Rach sheet in here too they surround us as we went through and reach on the Millennium all the unbelievers surround their Satan gets all the unbelievers from all there surround us as numbers of sand of the sea program said that was the people who never got to hear possibly the gospel during their lives on the earth but then we lived through here eternally but we'll be all alive this whole time but everybody that dies the tribulation they'll there will be in the graves this whole time then they get resurrected right here ok so just want to make sure i bring that out so buddy can see that that's the that's the two resurrections all the dead bodies here of you know Saint Paul or the Saints even brother branham all the same to be resurrected here we get a body change we meet the Lord there that's the first resurrection you live above the tribulation come down to Armageddon we're here on the earth we're all part of that and then we sit on the throne and judge in the second resurrection okay now I want to read the scriptures that most easily prove this so the next slide has those scriptures like I said you could write those down or I could email to you I want to start with the first resurrection scriptures and then we'll just hop like this will hop back and forth so they're more plain and this one we actually read this morning right we are in debt one this morning I want to bring that out here back at the grace of the Lord just so we have those scriptures the more we study the message over we know we've got thus saith the Lord praise God the more we know this is the absolute truth God is revealed it to a prophet brought it to us and church to me the more everything makes sense as you saw this morning you know when we see in the news and Russia the news and Hillary Clinton and possibly know the Pope when we see all this in the news we know exactly where we're standing amen we're spending with Christ Jesus amen it'll be a small group like Enoch was Enoch was one Noah's was eight it'll be a small group in every hour it gives us grace to know that we're in the right spot now John chapter 5 right where we need to be remember brother branham said Jesus won't be one second late for the rapture that we right on time we can rest and that we have a lot of confidence that John 524 now I get all these quotes if you remember from the church age bokra brother Ram talks about the two resurrections it actually takes a break in the book of life section and he breaks into the two resurrections because you have a resurrection for the goes feel that you have a resurrection for all others so that's actually in the church each book and that's where I get on these scriptures from ok jaan bhai 24 barely married I send you he they hear my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life it should not come into condemnation or judgment but is passed from death unto life butters this has to mean that baptism of the Holy Ghost it has to write because the foolish version comes into Condon they come into the judgment right to come into that so uh jesus said when you believe you have like you pass from death no more death or well what we saw a few Wednesday's ago the soul the scene in the soul is not normal anymore it's brought to life praise God it's brought to light because the foolish version they have a seat now they're part of the resident we'd say they have a seat but it's never quickened it's never brought up to the fullness because they never get bored again and so they can never pass into real life of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the day before no we saw this morning they were for known before the foundation of the world jesus said so and he prepared part of the kingdom of the new heavens and new earth he prepared part of the kingdom or the foolish virgin that's exactly what Jesus said so they were foreign up before ordained and foreign or four known as well but verse 24 John 5 is the bride is those who receive the baptism of Holy Ghost they're passed from death unto life they met first 25 bear the bear not saying you the hours coming and now is when the dead you hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live now some people say that's compound that might have been when Jesus resurrected his first resurrection or might be the rat rapture as well so mighty compound in verse 25 like i said i'm not sure i'm not really sure it sounds like it would be verse 26 president bother at life in himself so had he given to the son have life in himself I've given him authority to execute judgment also because he's a son of man okay now we get to verse 28 29 this is the second resurrection in the first resurrection that's all those who already have like they're passed from death unto life no more condemnation because they're walking in the spirit not the flesh ties it with revelation I'm sorry Romans 8 so let's read 28-29 al Qaeda you got your Bible buddy all right maybe you read that for Yuri 28 29 oh it's okay i'm sorry i thought your turn out it's okay buddy i read back i get the next one ready get can get this room ready here revelation 20 verse 4 i'm sorry i thought you had been my father here 28 Marvel not this for the hour is coming in which all a double album random says all that are in the graves shall hear his voice not everybody hears his voice right here not everybody does okay but it's at this this is the all when all hear his voice everybody this is my brother em sell around the corner Lindsey but I said everyone's got to give god the glory some time either in your lifetime you'll bow your knees in your lifetime or your bow your knee at the white throne judgment every knee shall bow every tongue confess you're going to give God glory at some time let's give it to a matter net uh although the grace yours voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation okay now then that will stop right there because that's basically the end of it so Jesus caught and we'll get to this in a moment but Jesus calls the second resurrection the resurrection unto sorry life and condemnation or damnation this is called life and damnation and that's called the rapture or the catching away the first resurrection okay so Malik I can you read revelation twenty four and six yeah for five or six please thank you condom and judgmental spirit of confident and I saw the soul of the American headed to the fitness of Jesus and for the word of God and we tried not worship the Beast even his image either i received his mark upon their foreheads with their hands and they lived in very fresh two thousand years but the rest of the dads with monica and blue father years fulfill this is the first resurrection weston and blue easy part resurrection of such the second death with no power but they shall be priests of God and a price game with them amen now I'm just going to go through verse 4 because first four makes it seem like you have to be a harder but the Bible uses the word and over and over again and and and right so those that will be bribed members may be beheaded right like Paul was like Peter while Peter was crucified upside am appalled was beheaded different ones were beheaded in the martyr martyrs age and they still are today it's her countries so those that are guys martyrs and now also for the word of God and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image what's the image of a man tells the image of the Beast is the World Council churches okay so this this covers the whole church change from the time you're a martyr the early martyrs in the lion age and ox age of course ox age was more sacrificial a lot of people die throughout all the ages so this covers all those so those that don't bow to the economical movement and system neither had received his mark in their foreheads but if brother have said the mark of the forehead was the doctrine right or the will of of the ecumenical move that's the mark of the beast do what they want or we believe in three persons we believe it sprinkling or we believe in all this holy water and all kinds of stuff like that not that might not be scriptural a lot of that subscription also they had not received it in their hands in front end so that's do the will of the World Council system so tell you what they do I don't know if you saw but yesterday they had a major gathering washington DC at all all kinds of Christians did you see that then christian rappers there they had all kinds of christian speakers that women preachers men creatures they say there's all this violence go along let's just come together for Christ now that could be dangerous that's very dangerous because you have women preachers and you have all these had two guys and all kinds of worldly were Creek worldly Christian Christian music right and to me it was a free figure of what's coming right the whole economical system because they see all this you know homosexuality abominations and so more like that and my wife sent me hard one of the main speaker said hopefully in 10 years they'll have an openly gay preacher preaching this affects they plan to it every year that's their hope is that sad so that clearly shows us that is moving towards the mark of the beast amen although you know it's a good idea to be one the only way you can be one with God is go Bay all the work right that doesn't make us one with God when we disobey the word so we see what that is now let's go to Revelation 23rd 11 through 15 okay but I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them right and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened another book was opened which is the book of life and you imagine Elvis will be there imagine that a man said I hate to call ladies brought Elvis pappu Michael Jackson Prince all these men women have gone on before Marilyn Monroe everybody will be there and the home standing before the Lord Jesus and the dead were judged out of things which are in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death in hell were cast in lake a fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast in the lake of fire now I forgot I one of the same verse 5 but the rest of the Dead those are some of the most keywords for this doctrine of two resurrections the rest that then lived not until the thousand years were expired okay so jesus said all that are the graves will hear his voice that has to be at the white throne judgment so the rest of the Dead don't live during the thousand year period they live afterwards those are the most important words when you're building this doctor the rest of the dead now first Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 I'm just going to read it because I'm really close to it get there pretty fast and then Matthew 25 you read that this morning all right hey for 1674 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord and these words were to comfort those we lost loved ones verse 18 wherefore comfort one another with these words on a concert that is we'll see our loved ones again and our friends again amen now Matthew 25 I'm not gonna read all that because we read a lot of that this morning but let's go to 25 and we'll probably start around 35 or something like that Matthew 25 this is probably to be one of my next videos I'm kind of praying about it and asking God to give me a script you know it most important things to say so I've kind of a really stayed on the subject here and also with this seriously savored and scarcely lost the car it all ties together ok now we did 31 this morning though so this morning we read about the righteous right so let's read about the goats okay numbers 41 then shall i say unto them on the left hand depart from me he cursed an everlasting fire prepared for the devil his angels I was hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger he took me not in naked and you code me not sick and in prison and you visited me not and shall they also answer him saying Lord wenzhou ed a hundred or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shy answer them saying marathon send you in as much have you done it not to one of the least of these you did it knocks to me and these should go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal so jesus said this is the resurrection of life resurrection of damnation the white throne judgment all right now so these are things i think the next few slides have already covered so corn in Jesus Christ Himself there's two resurrections or two types of Christians and we read the we read that this morning we read this so sweet Ephesians 5 14 it shows the two types of Christians as well it's all over the scripture it seemed you're like Abraham lot like we said David and saw different ones like that but it's also seen here in Ephesians chapter 5 talks about the wise and the foolish that's really been a good screw sure that's opened up lately as well these wise and foolish scriptures Sophie's ins 5 14 through 17 all right wherefore he saith awake now that sleep is does that sound like the parable of the virgins they're awake now the steepness right and arise from the dead in Christ shall give me light amen see then that he walk circumspectly or that means precisely we should walk precisely in the will of God not as fool's but as wise as beautiful redeeming the time because the days are evil understanding I'm sorry we're corby not unwise but understanding what the will the Lord is remember that what the will of God is her brother or st. Paul says the will of God is a mystery in Ephesians chapter 1 and brother Branham picks it up in the adoption series he says a mystery see every man or woman has to seek god for the will of God for their life he talks about Paul going off to Raven for three years so here again the only the lies version do the perfect will of God they're the ones who the mysteries been revealed to okay the foolish don't know they don't redeem the time they don't walk perfectly or circumspectly they just walk half has early in and out well I think I'm in the will of God maybe not but the true wise Christian is in the will of God they understand the will of God hallelujah so now next slide the two resurrections there's a person second now we read this the first resurrection we read that a reddit reddit those are the scriptures so the first resurrection those who live and reign with Christ for a thousand years that's the first resurrection and that's only who it is right plus 144,000 unbored for thousands of broad members holy ghost filled members this includes oddly this includes all the Old Testament Saints that were resurrected Jesus that came up to the gates because the Bible said they had glorified bodies they had new bodies so they had Laura five bodies and once you're the glorified body on see how you can get out of them I don't see how God I would take that away from it but I believe the first resurrection will be all those Saints the old testament to a glorified bodies the bride members of the New Covenant and the 144,000 I believe that will be there and then the Bible said that there will be heathen nations the numbers of the sands of the sea in the Millennium that will roll over brother grams that that's what the bride will rule over those who didn't get a chance possibly to hear the word of God that's what he said it's possible okay the second resurrection is life or damnation at the light thrown so that's what that is so I had it just I had those descriptions on there so you can see that here yeah here's where I changed my arrow the first resurrection is actually going up those who live and reign with Christ a thousand Blenheim now the second resurrection is those who miss the thousand-year millennium and must be judged at the White throw praise god that's the second resurrection now that's probably review for most of us here but let's look at here Jesus called the second resurrection the resurrection of the life or denomination so like or damnation takes place at the white throne judgment so this is where this was another example I want to say for tonight this is the example of those who are scarcely stayed or scarcely lost right here they're scarcely saved or scarcely lost right at the white throne judgment okay because the second net is the damnation or the separation from Christ for all eternity we know they won't live for eternity whether they have to be separated for all your ternity until they are niall ated totally now here's the second death jesus warned us about the second death let's read it together never see that discreet if ready 123 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he the overcometh shall not be her of the second death amen sorry I all over covers will not be hurt of that second death so it kind of shows you as well the foolish heart included in here if they can overcome to their pride and they can overcome their hatred and they can overcome any evil that would make them feeble about Christians and actually be kind of the Christians and the Christians Jesus will call them an overcomer and they won't be heard of the second death amen that's grace right direction that's amazing grace a bit so see we about the bride is supposed to overcome everything but the fooj version will just overcome maybe hatred for Christians and other sins and other pride so we're like that some of them will be to merge into the word as far as they know but they'll be foolish to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right that's the word of the Lord now I want to go through a few things here let's look at those scarcely saying at the white throne judgment my brother has a few quotes here so i want to read these to you I don't have them on a slide that's why i said here i want to look at the white throne judgment scarcely stayed and those that are lost and i want to go through the last few quotes of three kinds of believers from that message honest and two and studied yesterday all right now in the white throne judgment here's her brother him says he's preaching the message conference of with God 1959 December twentieth Levin says he's talked about conferences he said for let me tell you I'm going to speak of the last conference that will ever be held oh my i'm going to go back on my slideshow go back to that one the last conference that I'll ever be held right here the last conference we're having a lot of great conferences in America right and all around the world message conferences we call them special meetings amen and they got for that anniversary meetings and like we do in all kinds of meetings family camps and youth camps and now that's wonderful but he said I'm going to speak of the last conference that will ever be held he said God be merciful only one thing will stand there reconciled that's the judgment and the only thing you will be reconciled by is when you accepted the blood of Jesus Christ and your pardon and then fill with his spirit he said there's a conference where every man will meet woman will be every childhood meet there is a place selected where that conference will be held and there will be a great white throne judgment set and the Bible said the books were open another book which is the book of life ten thousand nine ten thousand The ministers and angels ministered to him and there was written and the righteous be scarcely saying where will the sinner and the ungodly appear amen that's how we find these quotes when you look up those like that what will your stand be at that conference you might have bypass all the conference's down through your life you may walk out this door this morning to bypass this one but my friend you will never buy past that one you are going to be there for it is once a point up to beg to die but after that the judgment so we're looking at the white throne judgment everybody is going to be there by now let me go to a different quote if you got your Bibles it's going to Daniel chapter 7 he ever Bibles ready so at the end of chapter 7 where we have another scripture about the white throne judgment right after Ezekiel you have Daniel Daniel 7 verse 9 brother infosys in the Patmos vision 1960 no let's read verse 9 and 10 I be held to the thrones were cast out of the Ancient of Days thats it whose garment was white as snow in the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his wheels as a burning fire does that sound familiar like revelation what his throne is fire right fire he has fire on his throne this is the white throne judgment first ten a fiery stream issued in came for from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open how many how many you read that before by God's grace so here's another picture of the white throne judgment you have thousand thousand administering or serving him which program says in some places it's the ride other places he says 144,000 okay it could be either one defensive cookie use but then the judgment is set and books are open and then the this ancient of day starts reading and judging out of the books now mother ever says is I want to ask you something I'm speaking to you lukewarm Church 10 versions went out to mean the Lord five of the Hawaiian spy foolish he said Daniel 79 said the books are open that's the book of the sinner and another book was opened who came within the church from the rapture tens of tens of thousands times thousands came with him and ministered unto him his wife the bride's this Casey said the bride o glory his wife came with him the church Johnson was set and the books were opened and another book was opened which was the sleeping virgin and every man was judged thus from the book now can I just stop for a moment here I just wanted to say this let's go back a little bit let's go back here to the rapture that's the first resurrection I really love the Lord tonight first resurrection this is what the scripture teaches the furnished resurrection the holy spirit goes up and Satan comes down safety and cast out of heaven for another time he's already cashed out when Michael kicked him out he's getting cat kicked out again now some point not long after the rapture maybe a writing suffer for three half years sometime in there the Bible said all must stand before the judgment seat of Christ let me know that that's when we all stand before the judgment seat of Christ so while the world is going through tribulation purging we are being given rewards and crowds okay that's what we're taught here from the scripture all of us and before the judgment seat of Christ so if we are all on the judgment seat here then we got to stand before the judgment seat at another time and that's the apt sometime after the marriage supper of the Lamb or sometime during that that great procession so when you and I stand before the judgment seat of Christ mother rabbit had a dream about it ever he saw brother Neville go up he was HOH so happy oh praise God brother Devils enter against it and all these things and then he said he never thought he'd be caught up he was caught up he felt a hand on this side it was his first wife hope and then he had on the side was beat up and he goes up to stand before the judgment seat of Christ had a dream about that so that's where we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ and we will we will look at our lives in the Bible set your works will be judged right you'll get a reward for your works all the works that remain you'll be given a reward for praise God and that's where that takes place so the the judgment seat of Christ for the believer is in heaven while the tribulations going on in earth yeah next we see at the Battle of Armageddon Christ comes back down right with his white horse praise God and then the Army of God comes with him riding on white horses and brother the Bible said the sort of the spirit goes out of his mouth destroys his enemies the files come down brother ramsden at some point about volcanoes have to erupt right he also said if idea so holy fire from heaven but god has to burn the earth over before Christ sets his foot upon the earth they met so he sets his foot upon the earth now once his burned-over Christ sets his foot upon the earth and the Bible said the next thing Jesus does is he anoint the most holy he annoys the Jewish temple in it sorry he sets up his temple upon the earth and then Christ and the ride are in the temple apparently that's we would look at it and banana the 144,000 are two resurrected there and they serve the bride amen so we had that going on now for a thousand years program said nations have to be rude over and the Bible said the believers israel will build houses and half of them and they'll be animals and a child will lead a lamb a child will need a lion and all these things that's all taking place through the thousand-year reign Satan is bound up and the bottomless pit with the seal on it for a thousand years and then as we saw at the gog and magog Satan is Lou so Satan is loose for a little while he comes up to the earth he deceives all the nations one more time he gathers them around Jerusalem and they're going to try to destroy the camp of God the Bible said but then God sends a fire from heaven a holy fire down and burns up Satan and all the all the unbelievers and throwing all the nations now you have just Christ left with his bride now is the time or the white throne judgment and here's what the scripture said Marvel not at this from the hours coming in which all that are the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth so let me just stop here for a moment Jesus will step out I don't know how he's going to do it he might you know go outside of the court you just might stand on his throne but the cheese is going to call all the different generations of covenants so I'm just kind of in my mind I start thinking about things like this I'm just going to dramatize so perhaps he'll call forth the first covenant it was the Adamek covenant right to add in public so Jesus would call for the Bible said he'll say come for all those in the grades from the Covenant of Adam and all those bodies the Bible said whether they are the see whether they're in the earth no matter where they are all those bodies will be raised up and come for praise God they're right next Jesus was saying all those from the Abrahamic covenant remember that's what we come to change now us the Abraham and his seed can be saved right that's in Genesis 15 18 the i seed would be saved so all those are the circumcision all those of Abraham see during Abraham's day they must rise up and they'll rise up and they'll come forth next Jesus will say all those of the Mosaic Covenant all those that lived in times of Moses all the way up to the New Testament come for and all those bodies will raise up can you imagine all the bodies coming up all coming forth unto the white throne judgment right here and the last one born is the New Covenant all those who died under the New Covenant the New Testament all those who died all those bodies come for her judgment and all the bodies will come for right everybody who says this is the last conference to be held now back in Revelation 20 I wonder what a time is going to be I remember we already stood we already stood before the judgment seat of Christ during this time so now we're sitting with him praise God we're sitting with the Lord and not being judged by the Lord this will be the last conference we all ever attend the eve ahead will be this white throne judgment cording to brother Brandon what he said they're down the revelation 20 he takes the books and he opens the book the scripture says the small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which written the books according to their works yeah I imagine don't know where to start I don't know if we'll start with the first offenders I'm hoping to add an age or not to have covered or not but he'll start maybe there with a bow and well he able was resurrected we'll start with you okay two different ones like that and they'll begin being judged and brother Brandon said this I want to read this he said another book was opened which was a sleeping virgin and every man was judged us in the book he said you'll be asked and give a reason why you didn't believe and then what then you better know now he said you know better you might not I'm sorry you might not have noted before but you do now so brother houses Jesus going to ask you why didn't what's your reason for not being a part of the lines virgin he's going to ask you that he's going to ask all these because remember the bride is sitting with him here some type of a judgment seat and he's going to ask all those from the Attic age why didn't they believe the blood sacrifice did you believe it if not given or the course they didn't give me a reason and there they'll be judged and all those that are as the sheep will be separated to the right hand i'll say this side let me separate the right hand and all those that rejected it will be judged and then we separate to the left hand praise God fine and next all the Abraham page that weren't the wise version of Abraham's age they'll be brought form then their books to be read why didn't you believe this what was the reason you have for not believing it and then this one's that would be say to be saved and the ones that are lost to be lost then the mosaic age of those that are safe those are lost and then you have that last and final one which is the new now in the new we see when the scripture says Jesus will divide all those on the right and they'll say you on the right are the blessed of the lord because you've done good things unto me right you gave you a drink of water you visit me in prison you visited you gave me food gave it close it gave me shelter all these things like that and because of that you'll enter into eternal life hey mother knew you talk about scarcely saved amen scarcely the very last judgment they way they they didn't even receive it while they could have my life they waited to the last conference the white throne judgment they waited here to be given in journal I'd rather than receiving it right now when you man see how boring this have life now praise god church now but they're scarcely saved right before the final moments before he passed all these boats in the lake of fire they're scarcely saving their surprise Lord ha what do you mean when do we do this to you we never saw you on earth and he said when you've done the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me amen so we'll give up ask you to give a reason why if anyone's there at the light throne judgment they'll ask and be given the reason why didn't you receive the Holy Ghost why didn't you receive life why were you foolish for the time I gave you why aren't you wise in church let me say like this there won't be many good answers there let me know good answers there none right no good answers there hallelujah now at some point there let me go back to me back up a little bit to the days of two days of Jesus let's look back when the mosaic people were being judged in times of Moses remember what Jesus said who did Jesus say is going to rise up and condemn those Pharisees queen him south right the queen of the south so while Jesus judgment you know with those people of mosaic they said we trusted in Moses and Jesus said during that time the queen of the south will rise up in judgment and condemn this generation because she traveled three months across the desert right sorry just to hear the wisdom gift of salad adjusting hero wisdom of a man by the Holy Spirit she traveled three months to hear the wisdom of Solomon but behold of greater than Solomon is here amen so there will be examples of different people raised up now brother Brandon even said this I don't know if you know this or not but brother branham said that between the south will be rise up to condemn the United States I never heard that before sir mota who says between the South she'd be raised up to judge United States because they're greater than Solomon is here today because they didn't come to hear brother ran it right because they didn't come to hear the message to the hour they'll be judged the same because it was the son of man another thing a son of man on the little yacht they'll be judged mother have said the South be raised up in the generation the United States so she'll be raised up against the Pharisees under the mosaic as they believed in Moses before the boat Jesus Christ was a shed and everything like that but she'll also be raised up during the time the United States right and she will condemned United States because a greater than Solomon was sent to United States praise god I love that that's exactly right that's what Jesus said should be raised up to condemn this generation oh my let me see if I got everything here where he's got over so see that's what we look at this morning give all diligence to make your call election sure church any effort you can give to draw closer to God let's get it Carrie because they were condemned for not getting more effort not driving right this is that Nick is lucky but for us it would be driving so if we hear you know God's moving on us and do something or for us is mostly come to the church is be bigger than ever to go to church and being also God or if there's special meetings you feel drawn by the Holy Spirit and you feel God is really going to speak there you know let me know is if the pastor you know it but you need to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit or he's God because the physical effort of the Pharisees will be condemned because they didn't go out to hear Jesus right because they didn't have diligence to go steer the man of God preachy hey man I'm so important about going to hear preaching that's where eternal life is that's where judgments are being issued praise God his judgment begins to the house of God and when we come house have got to be judged even though her judge were actually pardon in the same service because we repent of our sin come on but not there will be very few actually barn in there very few most will be under condemnation so that is the time so Jesus would call the atom covenant choose will call the Abraham Conan the mosaic come in and raise up witnesses I'll raise up this witness the race of that I magic Enoch could be raised up against his generation that's right each one all these different loads be raised up to condemn Theo's because they chose that to have life they chose not to receive life in their day oh my other new here what brother am say the wise going to say the foolish he's going to say you should have prayed up right Jesus will say okay wise merchant or are those that missed it Reverend you know they'll be there at the white throne judgment why did she receive the life God you should have prayed up and they'll be bribed numbers raised up and said we prayed up praise God we received life they'll condemn them because they did it do what God has told them to do jesus said knew two things right watch and pray that's that's what they're going to do and then pray open up as the bios said in Jude chapter one that if prayed the spirit enough to build up their most holy finish a man Olivia their faith wasn't raised high enough to really receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so there at the white throne judgment examples of race on broad numbers we raised up to condemn their testimonies their excuses well I didn't have time or all these things but these are those who prayed up they met that brings it down too hard a little bit by God's grace but can you imagine those that are scarcely saved why I went and visited this message believer when they were in prison and Jesus say because you did that enter into the joys of the Lord I fed this message believer they were sick or they were poor and I've met them food and because you were good to them jesus said you were good to me that's reality of it praise God didn't have any clues right like he said didn't have any food whatever you've got into the lease that he's my brother you've done it unto me glory then Jesus gives the rewards hallelujah nice that's right thanks dr. right amen ok now bow time says this is a revelation chapter 4 part 1 1960 he said tonight a blood lays on that throne it's a mercy seat for every sinner that's sinking mercy but on that day speak of the white throne judgment but on that day it won't be a mercy seat then it will be a judgment seat with the angry god setting there this isn't some nice calm god it's an angry god why didn't you do this why didn't you do that because we passed her mercy now his judgment right presents an angry god sitting there he said the righteous be scarcely say we're with a sitter ungodly appear you didn't redeem the time he's going to say right the wise redeem the time even when he comes to the cause of his Laura the balance will try to find a place to hide what are we the state or see what are we going to say that program what I didn't say then to Jesus when he's not happy he's not calling me that patient he's an angry god who's bringing judgment praise God what are we to say let's make our time right now by God's grace let's do what were called to do now by the grace of the Lord amen the last conference okay all right now let me close with this I'm not okay I'll write that about the time to post this is okay all right because this one we go through the last few quotes from the three kinds of believers I think me like I can move on now does anybody know x text for three kinds of leavers it was John chapter six when the many preachers left the message now brother Graham says this around the 22 minute mark he said separation had to be done and brother brahim said two things brought separation from the real believer and the unbelievers and brother man said it was doctrine and prophecy so listen to that the afternoon Fox remember remember idyllic Scripture how do you preached Paul told Timothy if you preach the right doctor and you'll be saved doctors important Jesus are the preaching doctrine and saying that I am the bread of life you must eat my flesh and drink my blood right that's doctrine you must do this this is teaching you must do this you must a community he's preaching doctrine and doctrines separated but America this case separated the believer from the unbeliever he said but that make believe her hung around Judas I want you to see that doctrine is extremely important real natural brief supernatural power no doubt about that amen so i told people recently i've had people kind of attack need from that left the message to speak again i could get these emails cube and text people attacking me and I say you know I never could have deliverance from the evil things I used to do you know my drugs or whatever I did and the evil words and curses i used to do it all these things i never got deliverance in any other Church than a message church why because they're a murder can't deliver you it doesn't have the power to deliver you it's an old word right from an old generation it's not the fresh man of the word is that right hey did I suppose I said that's exactly right when I lived in the Presbyterian Church the main Church in Akron I never could get delivered from chewing tobacco never deliver from these things when I come to the message that's when the power was there he met a word came in power what was it different doctrine praise God as far as that the church as far as prophecy doctrine or proxy boat ramps that separate the bleep ruffed lemur the other church has no prophecy right we've got prophecy from a prophet of God who gave us the state the lower eyelid of you so I want to make sure i read that and you can look up at the quotes because three kinds of lemurs doctrine and prophecy separated all those seventy preachers from Jesus my brother ran to actually call those seventy creatures unbelievers I know if you do that actually call them unbelievers to they didn't hang around as long as you to sit he said the ones that hang around to the very end he said those are actually the make believers so that's all another okay i always all those pictures were make believers brother have dolls of unbelievers because as soon as doctrines hard to be a preacher that's what mother have said as soon as you freaks your doctor if somebody walks out the church he that's the unbeliever that's if it's the right doctor right oh man so I want to make sure i bring that with you oder einem said after a while you'll see which class your inner I want to bring that one up by the band then goes and he talks about real believers he talks about a job he said sometimes believers are put to the test not sometimes every time amen glory so Joe had to be tested and that's why you're being tested for the Jose that's why we're being tested we're being tested because we're true believers and brother man said God allowed it to temper joke right to give him a Mormon more he can handle more trials and brother and said this is so beautiful he allowed that to see where jobs treasures were amen story was job's treasures and his money or his family weatherman said no his treasure was in god that's why I never cursed God when he lost all the other blessings oh he said when you go through trials it shows where your treasures rats what do you treasure more you can SAT and give up because you treasure the earthly things you're lost or just keep your faith and gods that God I don't understand it but though you slay me that god I'll trust you then had so but I said every Christian goes through he tests every Christian every time in Scripture was Hebrews 12 every stuff that cometh to God must be tried amen glory he goes on to say this you must get in your place whether your mechanic or housewife he said no one can take your place don't you love that nobody can take your place this morning he said God has something for you to do you may have many heartaches and disappointments but we do not great to shun them but we pray for the lord to take us through that if they are set for me just give me grace to go through them praise God there's beautiful message my Olivia give me the grace to go through every trial the trials were so excited on the trials will show what I really believe the trials will show what I treasure the most treasured living a holy galley life you're serving God because I love them or die treasure the things I'm pleasures of this world and there's couple of time of molson but come to type of man said we're not going to spend much time on the other two classes he sent there because they're not important anyway they're not important anyway now that's been listen that's because God knows those but we don't know who's who so we must as our sister saying we must throw the highways and hedges praise God amen that's why I like the internet when I make those videos go to places where I can't go I can't travel never let nothin I got an email from a pass from the Netherlands saying oh it surely enjoyed your messages on the brother branham as a prophet he said they were like water to my thirsty so he said no he says I'm music to my ears as what he said he's there's so many people of all the way from the message criticize her brother branham he said it just really said it was such a wonderful thing to see how we stand with the word the messenger the hour I said praise God we're certainly staying with him because he stood for us now here's another one when the real truth Kane and the review came from Jesus to those 70 preachers he says the make believers or unbelievers always show their colors when the real preacher the doctor comes down the oxygen prophecy said separate twin a real truth or riverview comes to the people it always separated those that leave he said I make believers are unbelievers those instead of the real believers that's right and he talked about how Jesus preaching was too much for them he talked about how he was sent from heaven and he wasn't having a ball on the earth at the same time I go back to where I came from and how he was the bread of life you must eat eat my flesh and drink my blood and they couldn't have on that type of doctrine oh my and that brother adam says this I mean decision is he said the real believer does not question anything because it's written in the word and they just go on praise God so long as the real believer here's preaching and they know why don't know Jesse freaks out now for us now of course whether ramming listen program to any feature when you listen to them oh I know that's in the Word of God I might not understand it but I know it's God's promise I know it's in the Bible so I'm just going to go on believe it anyway I can't explain it i don't know all the details but because it's in the word a real believer believes it amen hallelujah the man said if it isn't written in the word just stay away from it no matter what happens how to do you amen no it is closed this is his altar call he said you cannot escape it you were I'm sure you are one of these classes he said you have to identify yourself with a Bible character that's why this morning went overlap and Abraham and the thief on the cross and Jesus and Judas we went over these so you can see which one you are praise God well there's that the word it always separates these three classes of people but we know later he taught for classes there are two classes of believers you can say it either way they're willing to work out he said look in the mirror or look at the Bible and see which one is you he says amen let's let us say to our feet by God's grace I'll stop right there how many can see two resurrections tonight everybody see that by God's grace we must we must strive as Paul said by any means we must not let anything hinder us we must strive to be a part of the first resurrection for Jesus will call for everyone who's not in the first resurrection and ask them why didn't they be prepared for the first resurrection why do they make it had the chance to do it amen now he says right here we are pictured here with one of these classes he said the only way to know it is test it with the word in brother grams altar call he said raise your hand if you want to believe all the words some do that tonight if you want to believe all the word tonight would you raise your hand so we can pray together amen Oh dad said forbid that I would be a Judas program said he's hanging around right we're hanging around the word we're hanging on the message will sort of Judas but Judas didn't go all the way brother mam said judith stop at the Lord Jesus Christ baptism at the Holy Ghost bath pistol you stop right there you wouldn't go any further and brother evidence he said say Lord Jesus let your words be first place in my life for the real Christian the real wise virgin believer so let's pray together you all said you wanted to believe all the word and let the word be first real life let's pray together and ask how to do that Heavenly Father we try to cut the message short Lord God thank you for the people's patience or these Sunday night services there's such a blessing dear god it's so wonderful to hear another portion of your word preached Lourdes is teaching straight from your profit straight from the Bible straight from the Word of God I want to thank you for that Lord now you saw the hands that were raised your guy handa said let me believe all the word let me put the word first and or my hands are up as well your God let me put the word first let me believe all the word not argue and fuss and get intellectual with it oh lord if I don't understand it let me just believe the Word of God and go on if I see it written the word as your prophet said let me just hang on to it let me not get upset and walk away and lasting the word like a Judas or something dear god help me to stay with the word help me to be faithful and true and help the church dear god help each one of us for God to put the word above everything else in our lives we're coming down to a great separating time we're coming down to a time when the food's version will
