come fully to the submission of Jesus Christ amen saints of God let's prep for service here hope that's alright I've never fully actually run a whole entire thing here and by the grace of God so have your mercy on me we want to get right into the Word of God thank you brother Malachi lovely sister Lily Lydia god bless your heart I've got to look kind of a a preparation study this morning I believe the bride is slowly but surely awakening to this hour I want to hit just prepare for something by God's grace many promises in this day saints of God this world is falling apart this thing is getting so close I just heard rumor through a YouTube video a brother had sent me the North Star supposedly has moved three to five degrees the North Star as our prophesied easy that was the absolute he said that was a type of Christ he's that was a type of the Holy Ghost because it remains constant in the heavens a sailor a traveler in the old days they would look to that North Star and find out and be able to calculate they were leon now they're saying it's mood and if you look at the sunset it's actually setting a different location now a little bit more northern didn't Jesus say that the end he said he says our shaken not only the heavens but I'll shake the earth also everything that can be shaken everything that can be fallen down every broken branch or weak branch weak tree dead tree will be able to will be falling in this time we must make sure that our house is founded on the solid rock of Revelation amen let's get into this by God's grace I want to keep you holding held enter in here hold you a little thought the Lord's dealt with me he's given me a couple ideas here a couple months back I believe some revelations we want to touch on the shadow today by God's grace hope it's a blessing sorry I've got to old laptop here is she people keeps on rolling she's old it takes a little bit to load there's my precious family by God's grace they're all coming somebody at church was saying something after service about how Rahab had her scarlet thread and how she hung it out her window and she got all her family into that house and as the brother said it I had bought I had gotten my sister-in-law a scarf from Thailand and they had a little red threads and they were started they weren't fully stitched in it was cheap and they started falling everywhere and as soon as the brother said that we looked down and there was three of them little red and threads and I grabbed my real quick eye stuff to write my Bible I said that was let's say the Lord I'm claiming my family everyone we're going in this rapture every one of them by the grace of God you just have to believe all things are possible to those that believe if you could turn to proverbs 18:10 hope this is all right I'm just this is a little prep prep sermon for something maybe look great coming in the future we want to be ready but I want to plant these seeds in our hearts because anything's possible the mind of God is so deep it's so full that's so wise it's so untouchable unsearchable are his ways the Bible said we want to prep everything if God has a promise in the scripture coming we want it for us but if we're not looking for it just like his coming his rapture we're like looking for his coming we'll miss it he said watch and pray we must get into the spirit of the word in of our day Noah's message ain't gonna save us this time Moses message will not save us this time John the Baptist message will not save us this time we have to come to the message of our hour says here proverbs 18:10 you can have receipts after the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run thin to it and is safe let's actually bow our heads real quick dearly father Lord Jesus Lord Lord you know how you gave me this little Sunday School Lord here a little study I know we want to run this Lord and show the people Lord you've got your something great in store for us we just love you be with each heart Lord call me everything God heal every infirmity God we rebuke any spirit Lourdes contra to your word Lord may leave right now it's not welcome here but Lord we welcome the Holy Ghost your spirit your person or who you are Lord we want you to be here present we that we love your Lord just take full control this little vessel here god bless the people Lord hears the word blessed God granite in the name Jesus Christ Eman you may have your seats it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run off into it and is safe why are they running into it because it looks like they need safety looks like a danger has arisen looks like a trial a tribulation maybe has arisen it and they need to find a place of refuge and the Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong tower absolutely doesn't say a weak one or one that's kind of good but it says it's strong tower man and it's just it's not a natural tower but it's actually the very name the power of the name we run into that name right so this morning I'd like to teach on by the grace of God let me see if I can get this little mouse to work here I'd like to teach on a strong tower a strong tower I'll read these other scriptures and proverbs 30 verse 4 he says who asked ascended up into heaven or descent it is this not the disciples asked about Jesus who John the Baptist and who he was and this that Jesus as the Son of Man that which has come down from everything has also a sent it up into heaven when the Son of God appeared on earth he did he spoke from this scripture says who has gathered the wind in his fist who has bound waters in the Garmon who established all the ends of the earth what isn't his name and what is his son's name if thou canst tell interesting scripture here the name of God the name of Jesus Christ we know as the sons name but it's also the father's name as well correct and a Bible says every word is if God is pure he is the shield unto them that put their trust in him amen but to put their trust in him you must know their name if you need a plumber a little plumber to get in your crawlspace if you say hey brother and I I don't recognize that name brother but if you call me by name I'm like yes sir you can say me say sigh get in this cross base now fix this pipe payment but if you have to call me my name so I can get into your plumbing fix this leak or fix that sanitary line of this water line is heating line absolutely he says and now and not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou found to be a what a liar sure it says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold saints of God check our names this morning we've had a name change as well as what missus Jesus Christ a man it's not absolutely we're no longer just an espoused one but now he said what call them bride absolutely and the bride takes on the name of the husband Ecclesiastes 7 1 he's a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than 1 days of one birth absolutely so good name is good for you absolutely as mean a brother were sitting around his name is you've been here before he gave his testimony but your pastor had actually put his testimony online brother mike.mccluskey young convert about a year and a half ago the Lord led him right to his my right led me right to his house put me right on his doorstep one a right to the Lord and I said brother Mike what does your name mean and the name McCroskey means out and strong and if you ever might wear the mike.mccluskey he's loud and he's strong he's got a powerful voice but originated from he says the bearer of that name originally was a man who is fierce in battle and able to make himself when he's heard in the throng of battle so that name was originated from a man that while he's out slaying the enemy this man he was loud and he just let her know but he was strong and loud absolutely and that's the origination the origin of his name a good name is more precious than diamond a good name is to be favored absolutely look at Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God before creation before Genesis 1 warning he did not identify there was no one to identify himself with he dwelt alone all by himself the self existing one correct God in the beginning god but as soon as time broke forth as soon as he claimed the angels of heaven absolutely he's created all his cherubims and seraphim's the zooms and all the all these all these creatures that we hardly haven't seen except on probably we've seen more demon ones on television and movies than anything else but he then at Atlas creation he comes and reveals himself as God and that's the first name he gives himself to his creation is God that were God is from Elohim it means God or angels great judge he's a mighty but then that stems from Aloha which is the deity God we know deity means God absolutely so he reveals himself to his angels as God the deity the great one the mighty one and that's how he chose to identify himself first as I am your Creator is what he's saying the name just the word God means what object of worship so not only is he Lord of all and India t but he doesn't mean demands our worship it's song to Solomon he says identifies himself what as he says The Rose of Sharon and the lily the valleys absolutely he picks something naturally he had created he says I'm just like this and I'm just like that absolutely is the Rose of Sharon Lillian valleys in first Timothy 613 he says I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickens all things before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession he brings pathes Pilate in towards that he was the great one but that now in verse 15 he says which is times past times which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords so now Paul identifies himself Pontius Pilate was not that important 8 the port state means an officer or ruler of one having great Authority and mighty but in Jesus Christ was the true potentate a man yes sir he's the king of kings in the Lord amen yes sir a man sure now in Revelations 1 he starts out bringing these things to John Christ has now come down redeemed the people he's done everything he's paid the price on Calvary shed his blood for us he sent us the life that was in the blood back onto the people but now here over almost 100 years 70 years from that time now he's bringing the beginning to work with John and he says he tells John that he's the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end which was Jesus sayeth the Lord which was and is and which is to come the Almighty he's revealing himself more and more now to the what the Gentiles verse 11 says even pizzas Alpha the Omega the first and the last in Revelations 2:18 is the first to the last and that was his dead is now alive he's picking all these titles and names to reveal himself to his people in verse 12 he says he says not only does he have these names he said but he comes with a sharp sword which has two inches amen so he's not a powerless God but he's one full of strength and power and weapon jure everything he has can be also yielded to you as well if you pour on the Word of God absolutely if you pull on God himself notice here in the thigh tyrion Church H under Columba in Revelations 2 and verse 22 he says and I will give him the morning star who is that morning star it's Jesus Christ and you study the histories this was the thigh tyrant church age and the very next shirt age was what Luther's church age which one that lie that Brydon morning started now started shining his light pulling the people out of Catholicism absolutely because that's when the first that's when the Reformation started was when Luther's age and and what Christ started to rise up and shed his light on his word and revealed the just shall live by faith they man praise be to God what it was promised if you were come what I'll send that Morningstar back absolutely but where was the morning star was at the body of Christ was at the flesh now is Christ back to low gas form a man back to light former shows what that low ghost was rising up once again amen and it lit its way in Luther's day in Wesley's day Azusa Street there was a fire seen above that big building they were under and worshiping but then remember in this day in 19 and 51 that pillar of fire was seen finally a man there morning started risen now and it displayed itself above the Prophet Amen praise be to God showing whether it started right there a man in Revelations three seven in the age of the church and Lela filled up he said write these things saith he that is holy and is true so reveals himself as the holy God the sinless Scott the one that is perfect he's holy and he's true there's no lie in him there's no deception in him Amen praise be to God then now looking revelations 3:14 he says and to the angel the church age of lair of scenes write these things saith what he says da man Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so slowly is revealing himself more and more he's giving more names more descriptions details about himself he's unfill folding to the bride in this day in Revelations 19:11 and I saw heavens open and behold a white horse and hidden upon a horse said upon him was called faithful and true once again and in righteous he does make judge and make war and then in verse 13 says in he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God amen he brings it all the way back to what the John 1:1 and the revelations 19 verse 16 is and he that has this vessels on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords he's reversing these things continually to the people hey man letting him know never forget who the king and Lord of lords is the king of kings and Lord of lords the Alpha he's repeating all these things for our sakes just building a foundation revelations 20 verse 13 he's once again he says he's what he'd identified himself again Alpha the Omega the beginning the end the first and the last they met he what he starts that way and he ends up that way in Revelations he's revealing hood yeah I'm so same here and I'm the same here all the way through it's always been me Jesus Christ all right revelation 22 verse 16 I Jesus have sent mine off my name's I'm testifying to these things of the Church of Jesus I am the root and offspring of David that bright and Morning Star there's a man praise be to God where does that scripture come out of they pull him from this Morningstar the morning star goes all the way back to numbers 24 verse 7 I shall see him but not now I shall behold abut not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob Aimie he says in a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall smite the corners more and destroyed all the children of Chef descriptive names descriptive titles of who God is I love this one Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder notice calls him a child and a son oh my what is the name of the son wonderful what is the name of wonderful amen the name of counselor what is the name of mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace a man there's only one name we know of a man Hebrews 13 29 of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that's great Shepherd of the sheep a man he identifies him 9 when as a shepherd and the sheep humming his sheep this morning a man you say baa baa baa hey man here's all these things he's identified well all Scripture is given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost this was not necessarily Isaiah's idea to call him this but this was God's own mind saying I'm coming like this I'm being like this this is how you know me this identify myself Hebrews 3:1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our possession profession Jesus Christ he calls him the Apostle Paul's the apostle of apostles but he said Jesus Christ started the church and no man could stop Jesus Christ grabbed 12 men what it was a devil but he used those eleven and bought Paul in is what he started a church right there and look it's continued here we are two thousand years later he's the great apostle he's the one he's the soul winner he grabbed the leaven that formed millions upon millions and millions and billions of Christian stemmed out of that original Church the Apostle Jesus Christ a man in John 136 the Prophet John says in looking upon Jesus as he watches behold the lamb of God amen the one that takes away in the sins of the world I mean the Giants all salvation coming yes Lord you ever see that mystery you ever see the mystery of Israel where was this prophesied of men in Ephesians 4 it said Paul is breaking down the bride in Christ he said this is a great mystery he says fresh and flashier bone of my bone he's dealing with the Gentile church and he goes all the way back to Genesis were Eve comes Eve is pulled out of Adam and Adam identifies Eva said this is bone and my bowling my flesh my flesh that was a type of the Gentile Church correct the Lamb of God that takes away the sin the world who is he who is he dealing with first who was that Lamb of God sent to Israel first where was the first prophecy that took place here I must go through listen for bonus Genesis go to Genesis let's just go on this little trail here I want to show you some how powerful the Word of God this just opened up a wheat a month and a half ago a month ago Genesis 3 notice at the fall at the fall Genesis 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes are both them were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together who is the fig tree notice they didn't take fruit because there was no fruit all there was left on that tree was leaves and they wrapped himself showing what is showing that the Jewish religion would never do never do it would never fully cover his bride amen Jesus said salvation is of the Jews how come these fig leaves didn't cover because it was a set of the bloodless religion a man so what God takes it takes the Jewish religion off and what it leaves the leaves there and then what takes a landlady and covers it with the skin of the lamb showing that the Gentile or sorry the Jedi were not the the Jewish religion the law would never fit his bride he was going to put her and something else hey man look prophesied all the way back here amen praise be to God now let's continue on Genesis 12 verse 1 so one throw that in there because it was showed it was prophesied they would go to the Jewish religion first but then it would have to come and change and go right into what the blood the life behind the sacrifice Genesis 12 verse 1 Abraham's first Abraham's first encounter with God look how identifies him and now the Lord said unto Abraham Abram get thee out of thy country how does he identify himself to Abram Jehovah Jehovah that word Jehovah means self existing eternal God now the Lord said unto Abram now he's Jehovah right in the beginning of Genesis 1:1 he was God Elohim but now here he's reveals himself as Jehovah correct and he starts deal with Abraham Abraham was the father of the faith he was a Gentile correct now look next year waiting I have this out of order first encounter I don't have the scripture here I must have messed up but the very next time right at the name God gives Abraham a name change from Abram to Abraham but notice if you look in the scripture I don't think I have it written down here it's I think I missed it no I missed I didn't put it down but he reveals himself as a shell shanty I at the time of the name change and that l word el shaddai means the breasted one so to pull from God as our prophet Jesus and notice I am al-sharia he's your the weak little baby but lean upon my bosom my promise and nurse from me first Frankie was ninety and nine or ninety years old right around that time when he changed his name he says draw for me your strength I'm the creator that hung the heavens the earth put the Stars out yonder is anything too great for God I am El Shaddai I Jesus and you are my child though you are weak and I'm letting you go that way just to see what you'll do about it I'm going to make example he says for my people Hereafter that man will believe my word I'll stand by it no matter what it takes how long I'll do it I'll stand by it I'll shout it draw your strength from me so reveals himself first as Jehovah then he reveals himself as El Shaddai but then now as he as the promised son now comes he had to have a name change before the Sun came the Sun now comes and now God has revealed something else to him in his name this is what we're gonna go into is the seven compound redemptive names of God in Genesis 22 verse 1 it comes to what Abrahamic God comes he says and it came to pass everything that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he said Behold Here I am and he said now take take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou has lovest and get thee to land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering unto the mountains which I tell thee so God chose him by vision what mountain what to do but then as we see in verse 5 Abraham said unto these young men abide ye here with the ass and I in the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you so somehow through this vision he saw that he would come back with his son but God said go and slay your son on the altar right and he's raviga is now dealing with him November this is Holy Ghost field led or Holy Ghost leadership upon his children and he leads him up into all these things but now he's here to reveal himself Abraham takes the son brings him up to the altar he said he put what the word on the back of the son the son takes the Isaac takes it up then he takes the word sets in an order lays down and submissive son and as and as Abraham now pulls out his sharp knife he's ready to lay to slain his only son he saw the vision he says I'll be coming back I'll be coming back me and the lad will come back to you we're coming back and he's the running through his mind and now he says Lord I don't know how you're gonna do this he's got a sharpest knife because this is his sacrifice thus saith the Lord Kingdom says slay him and he's going up the bog skin now is on his head he's reflecting his sweat is down his then his face is beard and now he does not know what's gonna take place he's raising a knife and the voice says stop do not slay the son but he had fallen said that he would do this trusting in God that he would raise him up give him another one somehow stop the blade do something I need to put his fall trust and after that he pulls his son hugs him up and what the Bible says that God created a ram it was its horns were caught in a thicket just be honored that was creative power Saints creative power the horns represented with the power caught in the wood or the thurzo or the bus which is humanity 4 or 6 he was caught in there and then he laid him down and slay that lamb and from that time Abraham said I know I'm not just Jehovah not just as a Sharia because I remember he gave me the name Jehovah first show you what he was the only was the all-powerful one self-existing but not he showed what Girona then El Shaddai I then you can actually pull from this God for something and at this time Abraham deep in his heart a deep cold from the deep he was pulling for something to take place here he did not know it was gonna take place and God he was able to pull a sacrifice from God and he knew him as Jehovah Jireh right there why would God do such thing he has to reveal who he is what good is a God if he can't do anything for us or doesn't care about us but these Old Testament Saints had to live their lives out just wondering what God can do here's the God what could he do and from that time he was known as Jehovah Jireh now just the self existing one but the God that can provide anything can provide a sacrifice confided he's a provider he's a real husband amen yes Lord praise be to God next one revealed in the scripture Moses sisters directly after the Red Sea marina just got on the tambourine hitting the banks at 80 years old having a revival of herself leading the sisters leaving all their just worshiping God right at the mother the opening in the closing the Red Sea the horse when the rider or a casting they're lost forever but notices the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire the cloud by day and the light by night he says he leads them now to where first 22 so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness ashore and they were three days in the wilderness and found no water and they were come tomorrow and they could not drink of the water of Marah for they were huh God led him to bitter water he had to reveal more of himself well brother sigh why am I going through this he's trying to reveal himself to you if you were if we could just catch the revelation and the people murmured oh my goodness why am I going through this verse I my wife this and my husband this or the children of this land he he murmured against Moses watch what we say saying what shall we drink and he cried into the Lord and the Lord shoot him notice Jehovah Jehovah showed him a tree which when his cast in the waters the waters are made sweet and they remain for them a statute notes and there he proved them and said if thou definitely hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God thou shalt do which is right inside God he'll give her ear to His commandments keep his attention I'll put none of these diseases upon thee which I brought upon the Egyptians ceases for i am the lord the heel 'they what is this Jehovah Rapha God can heal anything a man there's nothing you cannot do a girl messenger said he says when you come up against one of your bitterest waters or something like that he said there's a tree tonight spiritually speaking hang you Gaza or the world tonight that'll sweeten any bitter words that you mean you may be led by but John's just keep me this oh that's true that or or less personally get annoying and that's this this saints of God anything better just throw out the Tree of Life into that situation why don't you compare your situation with what Christ walking down carrying the cross being my rib Romans scourges they carrying get up their cross than the hung on it compared to that Amen we have it's a sweet they are these are mild tribulations mile temptations were going through he said that's right that Calvary was sweet in any experience many times we get in a hard place I wonder how but shut my eyes I think yonder on Calvary where am i sit where my demon died for my life then my trial seemed so small but we always a murmur and complain and listener I can't believe I just throw aside and walk on it makes it sweet it swings every experience I ever had he already swings it when I come to my wires Amaro yes sir God I can take anything and make it wonderful you can be in the dungeon to the pit like the Old Testament Saints it's still be praising God David said when I'm in the hail thou art there oh yeah as long as Jesus is walking with you it's just heaven sweet communion you could be anywhere as long as he's there hey man yes Don now the next one the Lord our banner Jehovah Nissi x2 the seventeen verse 8 through 15 this is typed out eases the enemy was Amalek a type of the flesh in the conflict that stands today for the conflict of Galatians 5 some the war of spirit versus fresh what represents victory was holy do victory was holy due to divine help brother sigh I see so much wickedness who's your greatest enemy Satan know our own selves Satan can only come and put an idea in her mind safety can only allow a spirit to jump on you get sicker to that but if you speak negative if you go into that negativity if you embrace that the doctor said I had this the doctor said his brother look so he said did God tell you that did Jesus tell you I had cancer did Jesus tell you oh no whatever speak whatever you will and God can make these things better he's already a provider he can provide your healing amen and he's our banner here they're going up against uh Amalek here and notice what takes place notice how he defeats him against November this is a type against the flesh and it came to pass when Moses held up as a hand that is reprieve ailed and we let down his hand Amalek prevailed for a long time I always imagined this Moses who stand like this but I remember I wonder if it was more like this and Joshua Moses had said him and taught and fought with emilich and Moses and Aaron her went up on top of the hill it did not Jesus Christ go on to kogasa that hill Calvary and held his hands up and while he kept those hands up God made sure those hands wouldn't go down he nailed to the cross and the one is doing those hands held he could cry out with his last breath in his finish the battle over the flesh is done it is over amen praise be to God we just have to walk in the spirit as he's in the spirit as he's in the light and will not be partakers of the sins of the flesh hey man and as he kept his arms up he says and the Lord said the most write this for a memorial to the book and rehearse in the ears of Joshua for surely put out remembers of Alamut Amalek from under heaven and one day Saints this body will be changed absolutely when I got to be sad again so again we'll never get sick whenever you're tired whatever had to be affected by this kind of environment again death the sin of death will be fully out of us the disease of sin will be out of us a man praise be to God then we know remember son of heaven praise be to God for this he said because the Lord Jehovah has sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation they called the name of Jehovah Nissi he's our banner amen and when he healed in that claw a cross and that cross is still the banner this morning a man churches around the world have that and when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let one of them live if it's a cute little baby a little Amalek any little thought you've seen your flesh they even in your spiritual rally says kill it he says he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the Word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what denomination it belongs to you say well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to the Word of God he says get the thing out of you it's growing a little Amalek looks cute looks innocent that's why we have to watch each other and be brother's keeper real sisters keeper absolutely keep one another clean it looks like it's alright but you don't have anything to do with that you stay right away from it well brother branham I'll go down here because well I don't you remember Emmy any amal Amalekites anything that denies the word stay away from it have nothing to do with it at all how many believers that's the truth see sure it is in the last couple months I've been in the mode where when someone says something off the word I correct it right away I correct it right away correct it right away when I see myself you do this or that I correct it right away I said try and get back on the track stay right in a narrow narrow line right back on that narrow gate absolutely sure sure right there Galatians 5:16 through 26 you don't we won't hit that real quick we'll just read verse 16 17 this I say walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to another this is a battle with us every day costly right now he says so that you cannot do the thing that you would but if you be led by the spirit you're not under the law praise be to God and you can go in the works and those things later cuz I got a little ways to go here now next one is jehova sholom the Lord our peace the Lord are the Lord our peace the Lord will send peace this actually if you think about actually deals with the backslider because look how it starts look how he slowly reveals this thing and the children's will do evil in the sight of the Lord they back slid from God they weren't contrary started worshipping false listen false that did not have God as their first love and the hand of Midian and they sent him in the hand of Midian seven years I wonder why it's seven we know that was seven always represents the seven church ages and the hand of many prevailed against Israel look it's prophesied because in this day we break free because the mini i'ts and the children visitor had made them dens which are in the mountains in the caves and strongholds they ran from them and Israel was greatly impoverished because the mini Knights and the children of the Lord of Israel cried unto the Lord are we not living a million miles below what we should be we should be in spoken word already as far as Lord I need this waiting for the mind of God and we speak it in the moment happens every prayer should be answered absolutely we should be living like Eagles flying capturing what we need when we need absolutely we should be full of joy and go hey man but look what he says he rebukes him and I said you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the Amorite and whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice the second of Eve fell right from the book of Acts that was the second Eve and she fell as well but that's the Lord verse 16 and the Lord said to him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smite the many eyes as one man so God says there's gonna be one more war he says and I will be with you this is before the war and what it gave Gideon such comfort such peace that here in verse 23 and the Lord seven peace be unto thee fear thou not thou shall not die a man so God now is giving him comfort and what that's where the name I believe it's here yeah the Lord says peacefully the Lord is sorry Shalom that's what it is jovis sholom jehova sholom is right here even before the battle god was giving Gideon peace to go into this battle for the final round so we can take peace in that amen by God's grace now now look what it ties in here with the with the message of this hour he says one more thing we permitted to be said day before yesterday morning you notice on the board he said there was a vision he said I had a vision it was about five o'clock in the morning he says my as my wife knows there about five or six he says I woke up we get up the children in your school now I have these then and you all know everyone here they never fail they have absolute perfect they never fail so he has this vision and I thought that I was the happiest person I'd ever seen notice how the vision starts he's the happy he's glowing I was standing in the Sun the s UN and there was and I was preaching the gospel to a large mammoth congregation he says I just want to see if the tape it was being taped a larger mammoth congregation they were sitting in a forest and straight to the Sun were sitting down on them just they're getting they're getting the Word of God right he says and I'm as usual a little too long late a little too long too late preach too long and I preach too long until the congregation became hungry for physical food and they some of them started to get tired please got up and went out and got some food started to go out I said don't don't during the prophets ministries having this dream he says I had I had two climaxes I wanted to meet he was preaching in the minute when a preacher gets a sermon he thinks God shows us some of this so and he wants to convey it to the people and he had two major points he wanted to hit he says I wanted to meet in my sermon and the Lord gave it to me and any preachers know when you really know it's God give it to you it's just burning to tell the people and I was just preaching charlie just as hard as I could preach just laying on it you know he says all these great things what God is doing look at this he discerns if I thought what is it easy the word going on he's just going on like that trying to hit these points oh I wish I could remember when I was saying what text what my text was I can't think of a C but I was preaching whales watching myself do it and then I'm staying there looking watching myself preach and I was preaching who wouldn't have it and just have the bit raised up you know thought going to God look at these wonderful things in this and that and directly I noticed that people begin to get physically hungry so they had they had enough spiritual food is this not what happened this has already taken place they started to walk away some of them and he goes hmm they got tired of listening to the word they got tired of the spiritual me the stored-up mana what's the matter with everybody and it looked here and some young couples were going along to my side and I stopped I said just wait a minute friends just wait a minute he says you'll be back when the evening shadows fall see I said you'll be back again then we not received a great falling away already in this message a major but saints of God there will be some that come back when the evening shadows fall when this one this things about ready to strike when this things about ready to take place they'll be back when it goes right back to the back side what God will can eat he is our peace as we can take comfort for our loved ones if they weren't up in the world a man now moving on the next one if you look at Psalms 22 Jehovah makes peace by the blood of the cross and Psalms 21 what is this this has spoken this God actually spoken this in tongues my God my God why has thou forsaken me why aren't there so far from helping me and my words from my roaring lion he was a lion up there dying chapter 22 is Christ on the cross look at verse 7 all that you see that see me laughed me to scorn they shoot at the lip they shoot the head saying he trusts in the Lord that he would deliver him all these things are all Christ on the cross chapter 22 is Christ on the cross the Lamb of God right dogs have come past me assembly the wicked because they have pierced my hands and feet I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me chapter 22 is Christ on the cross but the very compound reductive redemptive name of Jehovah is revealed in the next chapter Jehovah Rapha the Lord is my shepherd if God is a shepherd he would have to lead the Sheep and if he is leading the sheep he led them to Calvary and did his part on Calvary amen so where are we supposed to lead him as he led us amen what he did the shepherded the Sheep must follow a man crazy be to God and there David reveals to us to what he is the shepherd a man but within that act of dying in Psalms 22 he dies but now he's revealed as all of these all seven compound redemptive names are found in Psalms 23 he says the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah Rapha he's I Sharon I want Jehovah Jireh why because he's provided everything I'm contained in every situation I'm content here I'm a bay if I'm gonna get a base if I'm a bound I'm a Content he making me lead the green green pastures jehova sholom he leaves me me to be still waters over are restoreth my soul amen he steals my soul with the Holy Ghost amen takes with him believe all sin out a man drove the Rafah he leaves me the path of the righteous for his namesake over this canoe yea though I walk in the shallow valley of death I will fear no evil Giovanni see for thou art with me Jove of Shama thy rod and thy staff they covered me to override now prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies Giovanni see now unknowing just my head in oil drove around for my cup runneth over Jehovah Jireh all the names are now revealed after this in this song after Psalms 22 the death burial resurrection of our Savior amen when the blood is spilled Maui's by the Spirit of God notice the profession of the Bible the sacrifice and now revealing the day everything that he did open up all this yes he did you know one time I was told I don't know whether this is authentic or not we're a missionary told me in Palestine however he had CDs that has seen a Shepherd coming with his sheep and he said and said once she / had he had on its he had a packet on his back he had a splint on one of its legs he said did the sheep fall sir he said did it hurt his leg he said no I said what happened to its leg he said I broke it said you broke it said you must be a very very very cruel Shepherd to do that to any of your own sheep he said what does Shepherd say no he said the sheep wouldn't mind me but it was a sheep and I was a shepherd now she wasn't my flock and he wouldn't hear my voice see the sheep wouldn't mind me kept going astray he says and I know it was going to get it was going to get killed so I had to break its leg in order to bring it up close to me and give a little special treatment feed it out of my hand and I said I would love me more you know when you know when the best converts come you know when the best time to go fishing and when you see somewhere at the very lowest point God has to break them we were there life loud every day Willie ruined her life that's the best time you go fishing for a soul you seemed their lowest state that's what I came I'd ruined my life God let me break it and that draw me ever so close what Jesus say who would love me more Simon he that sinister lot or sinners less either sin is the most cuz I have many transgressions and equities under his blood hey yes so many guys sometimes just let a little something happened to you so he can bring you just a little closer to him says love your little extra then he gives you a little special treatment or healing and you say yes lord I believe you are see that's it see how God how God does it is he wonderful we just believe him hey man hey man just a couple more here then we're gonna go into this is all foundation hope it's all right Joubert it's canoe Jeremiah 23 verse 6 hittin the Jewish religion even talks about this if you understand the type a wall unto the world be to the pastor's destroy and scatter the sheep of my flock saith the Lord bad pastors therefore saith the Lord God of Israel gets the pastor's that feed my people er you have scattered my flock driven them away they have not and have not visited them behold I will visit you with the evil of your doings saith the Lord our God the remnant of my flock out of all countries will that I've driven them and will gather them together to the together to their folds that they shall be fruitful and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them that shall feed them so these Shepherds are wicked and took them away from what's what has revealed to the righteousness of God God became sin that we become the riot of the very righteousness of God and in his days verse 6 in his days Judah shall be saved and there shall be safely and this is the name where he shall be called Jehovah he says the Lord our righteousness this is yet to come this is future tense the Jews are still in their fig leaves their fig leaf religion right now the Israeli religion but salvation of the Jews they just haven't called back up to yet absolutely the next one and the last one notice how God reveals us last in Scripture jehova shamma God is our provider he's a healer he's our banner he's our peace he's all these things but what good is it if you can only pull from it at a certain time but what's revealed here is jehova shamma the Lord is present right now anytime you need healing anytime he's something provided and it's a unique piece he's opposing God in a time of trouble any man the Prophet picks up on this we'll just paraphrase he's preaching on the seventh compound name is Jehovah and he hits jehova shamma and he goes in the story I'll him and his wife had just got married he was too poor for a honeymoon and too poor to have a hunting trip separate so he combines him so he take he takes over in this high mountain where there's no heat and he's being big shot bill and big shot bill and he goes out hot and he says he's his baby I'll be back he's ominous going out to hunt little he's maybe we have a I'll get em you got me ELISA dear I'll get some backs tracks want some fresh meat for the four tonight he goes up to the mountain he's he's tracking deer gets on this bear track finds this bear can't find it then he finds a deer he shoots the deer or boom he's got it cuts up the meat and he's like wow I better head back to my wife and child and what we know what takes place next he gets lost he said in the Indian Indian tradition they called the dead man's walk he says I'll find my way back had gotten foggy the mountains he couldn't find his way the fall get settled in he started walking and holding the meeting's gun fires sure enough he comes right he finds himself right back at that near he'd killed he'd gone half an hour and he went right back he goes out again I bill gyro you're a wilderness man you've been trained here you're you know all about he comes right back that year again and he tells you the inner battles he has Lord I'm this I can't be lost I can't be lost and then finally he gets to the point where says I am lost and my new wife was a city girl it's gonna die tonight because it's getting cold she don't know how to start a fire she know how to cook on a fire what's that where's the stove where's the oven table top nice table see with a flattop they're clean they're real easy and he starts out and he says and then the voice said what let's just look at that look at the voice said so I here's something whispering in my ear the Lord is my refuge our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble I thought now I'm getting for nefra Nanak started to walk around it said something the lord is our refuge and help a very present time and help of time of trouble I just kept walking on got louder the Lord as our refuge and strength a very present help in a time of trouble I kept moving on and dragging my gun along I was so tired and then and then you know the Lord that was jehova shamma but talking to me he was present right there God watching over him and looking through the pines and winds of tearing whistling them through there I believe beyond yonder that somewhere there was an angel of God follow me through this force and there was he was with me yeah he never manifested itself that's years ago about 15 years ago and I wasn't going through walking like this and what happened is he finally got down and said lord please help me he said Lord I'm going this direction I believe it's this way but if I'm wrong you correct me he says and I was going along the way that walk like this and I felt somebody go on my shoulder and I turned to look who it was and the fall cleared away just that moment and revealed the very mountain he needed to see to find his way back gay men but what we have to understand God is right there right now any time all the time whatever you need and he's right there ambulance at four o'clock door at four o'clock in the morning this morning God woke me up you know how he did it I was laying in bed and it never happened before you know in the mornings on Saturdays because when I actually get to sleep in Saturday's you're laying in bed and the sunlight starts manifesting shooting it's rays through the window and it starts your does that thing on your eyelid you say anybody got magically you know by the presence of the S UN right well last night I rolled over and the same thing started happening I look we'll wake up wide awake God had use moonlight to wake me up last night the moon was so bright and it was shining all over my arm like this and it woke me up God can do anything he was trying to make contact with me there did he say he said he's make the Sun he's make the moon as bright as the Sun but you have to raise the Sun up seven times brighter amen God's attitude toward his people since the Garden of Eden has been wrapped up in the seven compound redemptive names the fall itself unlike the ads used to or bottle up in our God if the fall would have never taken place we'd never known this about him we needed to fall in the sin God allowed he set the stage he planned this thing perfectly thank God for the fall and now we know our Savior but look what it says here first - and the Gentiles shall see thy righteous and all kings like glory and thou shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord Jehovah shall name alright what does that name the name of Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ Jehovah Mitch which means what Jehovah Savior now look how the Prophet breaks us down he says when Matthew said no Matthew 28:19 he says go he is there for all teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost this was written this was spoken out of Christ's mouth look how how it's been misinterpreted today and say in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost in the name he said the name it's not even written he left it a mystery on that mountain high up with their eleven disciples he says baptize in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost he never gives the name he leaves it a mystery it was a complete mystery he said it wasn't even written at that time it's it's in the name singular of the Father is not a name son is not name Holy Ghost is not name it's a title ten days later Peter Peter stood up and said repair everyone baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen see so the new name was then revealed he says well I'll give the Gentiles a new name now look how he breaks it down further he's a salvation along goes in the name of Jesus why would you get baptized father son Holy Ghost when there's no salvation in those titles he says whatever you're doing word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ there is not another name no church no hierarchy no titles nothing else yet here's the Rose of Sharon the loser Bellary the morning stars Alpha Omega beginning the end Joubert IRA Roth aye Manasseh all these things he is all these things yet but there is no salvation in any of those titles Jehovah no salvation a man runs us and yet he is no salvation far so he goes he says no shows up in salvation only the name of Jesus Christ praise be to God which means Jehovah Savior hallelujah amen now we're gonna go somewhere now all that all that little want to go somewhere we got one service hang on notice the seals I wish I could stop on that just a minute oh my I got a good notion maybe you you
