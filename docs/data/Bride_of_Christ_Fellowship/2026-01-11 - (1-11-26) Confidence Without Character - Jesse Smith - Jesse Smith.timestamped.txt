[0:00] taught on uh integrity. So, I hope that
[0:02] was a blessing by God's grace. Today, uh
[0:05] we'll look at this thought. I've never
[0:06] preached this thought before, but it's a
[0:08] very familiar topic. Uh I kind of
[0:10] remembered when brother McBride preached
[0:12] a sermon called a false sense of
[0:14] security. I don't know if you remember
[0:15] that one a couple years ago, and it was
[0:17] basically about Matthew chapter 7 with
[0:19] the workers of iniquity. I have a
[0:21] similar thought today. I think it's a
[0:23] good thought as we prepare for the
[0:24] Lord's supper with uh with feet washing
[0:27] of course to follow. But my sermon for
[0:29] today is called confidence without
[0:31] character.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Because this group that we're going to
[0:34] read about has confidence in God, but
[0:36] they don't have the character that's
[0:38] needed. Now, church, we want confidence
[0:40] with character.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let's read 1st Samuel
[0:44] chapter 4 verse one. 1st Samuel 4:1.
[0:50] Is the live stream on, Malca? Okay.
[0:52] Thank you. Was it on during the song
[0:54] service? Okay. No. All right. So, I was
[0:56] just looking for a text from my wife.
[1:00] As you're turning there, 1st Samuel
[1:02] chapter 4, we want to uh also recognize
[1:05] we had the birthday girls last week,
[1:06] Eden and Virtue. Let's give a round of
[1:07] applause. Amen. Hallelujah. Our January
[1:10] birthdays. Hope girls had a good
[1:12] birthday by God's grace. Uh my wife's
[1:14] birthday is coming up on Friday, so look
[1:17] forward to that. Uh by God's grace. And
[1:20] there's a couple more January birthdays.
[1:22] Who am I forgetting? I think brother
[1:23] Patrick has a January birthday and
[1:26] Victoria has a birthday coming up,
[1:27] right? So, we want to pray for our
[1:30] birthday friends in in the body of Jesus
[1:32] Christ. Ask God to bless their next year
[1:35] of their lives. Hallelujah. So great to
[1:37] have another year to serve the Lord. 1st
[1:40] Samuel chapter 4 verse one.
[1:43] I'll read one through four and then we
[1:45] can read uh verse five together by God's
[1:50] grace. Now, this thought came to me this
[1:51] week. I was reading uh I got done with 2
[1:53] Samuel. So I went back to 1 Samuel. I
[1:56] kind of read the the Bible backwards. I
[1:58] start with Revelation and I go forward
[1:59] because I love the book of Revelation.
[2:02] So I finished 2 Samuel. Then I went to
[2:04] First Samuel. And I'd forgotten about
[2:06] this text. It's a beautiful text here uh
[2:08] by God's grace.
[2:11] Verse one says, "And the word of Samuel
[2:14] came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
[2:17] against the Philistines to battle and
[2:18] pitched beside Ebenezer. And the
[2:21] Philistines pitched in Aphek. And the
[2:24] Philistines put themselves in array
[2:26] against Israel. And when they joined
[2:27] battle, Israel was smitten before the
[2:29] Philistines. And they slew of the army
[2:31] in the field about 4,000 men. That's
[2:35] quite a loss. And when the people were
[2:38] come into the camp, the elders of Israel
[2:40] said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten
[2:42] us today before the Philistines? Let us
[2:45] fetch the ark of the covenant of the
[2:46] Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it
[2:50] cometh among us, it may save us out of
[2:52] the hand of our enemies. Now, this
[2:54] sounds really good, doesn't it? It
[2:56] sounds like if we just get the ark of
[2:58] God and bring it here, God will save us.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; But they're going to find out a hard
[3:03] lesson. Just because God's ark is with
[3:06] you, just because you have the word,
[3:08] that doesn't mean you're going to get
[3:09] the victory,
[3:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:12] Verse
[3:14] four. So the people sent to Shiloh that
[3:16] they might bring from hence the ark of
[3:18] the covenant of the Lord of hosts which
[3:20] dwelleth between the cherubams. And the
[3:22] two sons of Eli, Hoffne and Phineas,
[3:25] were there with the ark of the covenant
[3:27] of God. Let's read verse five if we can.
[3:30] Ready? 1 2 3. And when the ark of the
[3:33] covenant of the Lord came into the camp,
[3:36] all Israel shouted with a great shout so
[3:40] that the earth rang again. May God add
[3:43] his blessing to the reading of the word.
[3:44] You can be seated here by God's grace.
[3:48] So I like to preach on confidence
[3:50] without character. That's the negative
[3:52] side of it. The positive side of it is
[3:54] confidence with character. Hallelujah.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; That's what we want today as we approach
[3:59] the Lord's supper today. We want to have
[4:01] confidence in God because of our
[4:03] Christian character. Hallelujah.
[4:06] Now, if you remember, uh I'm not going
[4:08] to read all these verses, but if you
[4:10] read verses 6 through 10,
[4:13] the Philistines hear Israel shouting all
[4:16] the way across all those miles. It's
[4:18] such a loud shout
[4:21] and they get afraid and they said,
[4:22] "Well," they said, "Quit you like men.
[4:24] Let's be strong." Remember, that's what
[4:25] Paul told the Corinthians, right? Quit
[4:27] you like men. In other words, be brave.
[4:29] Be brave men. Be strong. Don't be
[4:31] cowards. That's what we need today.
[4:33] Hallelujah. Brave men. Hallelujah. Brave
[4:35] women. Well, they went out to battle.
[4:38] And if you read in verse 10, and the
[4:39] Philistines fought, and Israel was
[4:41] smitten, and they fled every man into
[4:42] his tent, and there was a very great
[4:44] slaughter, for there fell of Israel,
[4:47] 30,000 footmen. So, you have 4,000
[4:51] uh in verse I'm sorry. Yeah. 4,000 that
[4:54] fell earlier,
[4:57] right? Uh yes, in verse two. And then
[4:59] here in verse 10, you have 30,000. So
[5:02] 34,000 Israelis died. And church, we
[5:06] wonder why. And if you wonder why,
[5:07] you'll read, we'll read later on, you'll
[5:09] figure out why. It's all because of sin.
[5:12] If sin is allowed to stay in the church
[5:14] of the living God, then bad things are
[5:16] going to happen. There's going to be no
[5:18] victory.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; No matter how loud people shout, no
[5:22] matter how much noise people make, and
[5:24] we're going to show the other side. No
[5:25] matter how quiet you are, if you don't
[5:27] have the character of the Holy Ghost,
[5:29] it's not going to help you at all in
[5:30] your battles.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; So, Brother McBride had preached this
[5:34] thought a few years ago, a false sense
[5:35] of security. So, I thought this was a
[5:38] very similar thing when I read this this
[5:39] week. I read it before uh work. I
[5:42] thought, my that reminded me of Brother
[5:44] McBride's sermon. So, notice they had a
[5:46] shout, they had emotion, but they had no
[5:48] character.
[5:50] It's because of idols, as you'll see.
[5:52] It's because they had sinful leaders.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; It's because the people were
[5:57] self-indulgent,
[5:58] partaking of the lust of the flesh and
[6:00] the lust of the eyes. They were
[6:02] doubleminded men. Now, do you remember
[6:05] when I preached last year on the
[6:06] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[6:07] his ways? I think I preached five
[6:09] sermons on that last year. And Eli was
[6:12] one of the examples that I used because
[6:14] Eli would tremble. Imagine every time
[6:17] the ark came around, he would tremble.
[6:18] He'd actually be shivering because he
[6:21] respected the ark so much.
[6:24] But then he was overweight.
[6:26] He didn't treat his body like a temple
[6:28] of the Holy Ghost.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we'll see, he let his
[6:32] sons continue living in sin.
[6:35] He didn't correct them the way he should
[6:37] have. So he was double-minded. Sometimes
[6:40] uh when the prince of God was there,
[6:42] he'd be real fearful. And didn't he
[6:43] treat He treated Samuel pretty good,
[6:45] didn't he? There's another good thing.
[6:47] And remember, he spoke the word to
[6:48] Hannah and said, "You'll have this baby
[6:50] that you're praying for." Amen. So, he
[6:53] had some good things. He was when he was
[6:54] minded on the Lord, he had some good
[6:55] things. But when he wasn't minded on the
[6:58] Lord, he had some bad things. Like his
[7:00] two sons, he never really corrected his
[7:02] two sons. And then he w he was
[7:04] overindulgent with the with the food
[7:06] that he ate. He didn't take care of his
[7:08] body.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; And somebody come up to me one time, now
[7:11] this person doesn't come to church
[7:12] anymore. Uh but after I preach that they
[7:15] come up to me and they said, 'Brother
[7:16] Jesse, you were preaching on me uh with
[7:18] the double-minded sermons. And I said,
[7:20] 'Yes, that's true. I said, 'But I was
[7:21] preaching to everybody in the church.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The reason we
[7:25] come to church is to find our weak
[7:27] points."
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "The pastor is to
[7:30] study and find weak points in the church
[7:32] and try to help the church." And church,
[7:34] if you listen to those sermons, I put
[7:35] myself in there. I sometimes I'm
[7:38] double-minded. We're all double-minded.
[7:40] Amen.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; And but I told that brother, I said,
[7:43] "That was my love for you. That was my
[7:46] way just to try to help you." I said,
[7:47] "But all of us are double-minded at
[7:49] times." We all need grace.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Who else remembers who I preached on?
[7:52] Remember Peter?
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Now, how many want to be like Peter? My
[7:56] hands up. I want to have faith. I want
[7:57] to have the Holy Ghost. I want to I want
[7:59] to uh have the keys to the kingdom.
[8:01] Right?
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; So, see, I was preaching on everybody.
[8:04] I'm helping everybody. Right? The
[8:06] preaching is for all of us. The
[8:08] preaching is a sword. Everybody gets cut
[8:10] cut with a sword. Hallelujah.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; But also, everybody gets healed by the
[8:14] balm in Gilead. Everybody gets healed by
[8:17] the anointing oil.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. The word always cuts,
[8:21] church. It cuts all of us. Brother Ram
[8:22] said that's why we study to find the
[8:24] weak points. He said that's why you come
[8:26] to church to find your weak points that
[8:28] you can make them strengths and become a
[8:30] better Christian.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; So yes, I preach on myself. Hallelujah.
[8:35] Church as a preacher. And now you
[8:37] wouldn't know if you're a preacher, but
[8:39] you would if you're a dad. You as a dad,
[8:41] you got to teach or mom, you got to
[8:42] teach your children the things, but
[8:43] sometimes you fail in those areas as
[8:45] well.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand?
[8:48] &gt;&gt; At some point, all all of us at some
[8:50] point are going to try to help somebody
[8:52] learn something that we struggle with or
[8:54] we're battling.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Didn't Paul say he said good's right
[9:00] there, but sometimes when I want to do
[9:01] good, evil's right there, too. and I
[9:03] don't choose the good and I do the thing
[9:05] that I hate.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, wretched man that I am,
[9:09] but thanks be to God." Amen. Who gives
[9:12] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[9:13] Christ.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:17] Now, church, you remember Matthew
[9:18] 7:21-23.
[9:20] Let's read it because it's one of the
[9:21] most uh powerful portions of scripture.
[9:24] I've seen YouTube videos and people say
[9:26] this is the uh ven you might have heard
[9:28] it. People say this is the scariest
[9:30] verse in the whole Bible. Now I I agree
[9:33] for the unbeliever or I say for the
[9:36] makebeliever but not for the true
[9:37] believer.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Matthew 7:21. This is of course speaking
[9:43] of the wheat and the tears. This is the
[9:45] Judas group who is lost because they
[9:47] were workers of iniquity. They did not
[9:49] work righteousness.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Now church, you remember the church age
[9:54] book. Brother Bam said, "How do you know
[9:56] you're accepted before God?" He said,
[9:58] "Look at your works and go do the right
[10:01] things in God's eyes, and then God will
[10:03] accept you." It's that simple. If you're
[10:06] not obeying the Bible, repent, obey the
[10:09] Bible, and then God will accept you if
[10:11] you do the works of God.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; It's that simple, church. Let's not make
[10:14] this uh spiritual algebra to this
[10:16] degree. God accepts us if we're
[10:19] repenting of our sins and then we're
[10:21] trying to walk in obedience and do the
[10:24] right things.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:26] Hallelujah.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Now, you know the verses here, very
[10:31] familiar, but let's read them. Matthew
[10:34] 7, I'm sorry, in the wrong chapter,
[10:35] 7:21. Not everyone that saith unto me,
[10:37] Lord, Lord, shall enter in the kingdom
[10:39] of heaven, but he that doeth the will of
[10:41] my father which is in heaven. So, God
[10:42] help us to find the will of God.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Now, uh a precious family member of mine
[10:49] recently asked me how or or no, he
[10:51] didn't ask me. Uh he just said, "I want
[10:54] to know that I'm in the will of God."
[10:56] And I said, "Well, I've got a good
[10:57] chapter for you." In my 2021 book, I
[10:59] have a whole chapter on the mystery of
[11:01] God's will. Remember church, God has a
[11:04] sovereign will, which nobody can ever
[11:06] change, right?
[11:07] &gt;&gt; And then, friends, God has the will of
[11:10] God in the Bible that he's made known to
[11:13] us.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; So, this is called the known will of
[11:15] God. But then what there's something
[11:17] Brother Ram calls the progressive will
[11:19] of God which is you finding out what God
[11:22] wants you to do as you live your life on
[11:24] earth.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; But it's already it's already determined
[11:26] right in the sovereign will of God. But
[11:28] we don't know it.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, brother Chris, that
[11:32] we work out our own salvation with fear
[11:35] and trembling. Oh, there it is. That's
[11:36] good. Amen. Hallelujah.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; That means as you're trying to find the
[11:41] will of God, you're trembling before
[11:43] God. As you read the Bible, say, "God,
[11:45] help me to make the right choice with my
[11:46] marriage, my job, my finances, the gifts
[11:50] in my life. If if I move, do I move here
[11:53] or move there?" You tremble before God
[11:54] and say, "God, just help me to make the
[11:56] right choice."
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Good. Great question.
[12:00] Work out your own salvation with fear
[12:03] and trembling.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; So, see, that's why Christians, as
[12:06] Christians, we shouldn't just say,
[12:07] "Well, I'll do this or I'll do that." We
[12:08] should make sure we ask God first. Then
[12:12] we know God's will because we've
[12:14] trembled in God's presence and God sees
[12:16] our sincerity. We're trying to do what's
[12:18] right.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; But look, the workers of iniquity didn't
[12:23] do this. They didn't do the will of God.
[12:26] Now church, a lot of you are doing the
[12:27] will of God. You come to church, you pay
[12:29] your tithes, you worship, you sing, you
[12:32] pray. Those are all things we should do.
[12:34] Amen.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That those are good things.
[12:37] So you can know I'm doing the will of
[12:38] God today. Hallelujah.
[12:41] Now, make sure you do the will of God
[12:43] the rest of the day. Then you see then
[12:44] then the devil can't beat you up about
[12:46] it.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Cast down anything that exalts itself
[12:49] against the word of God. As we said, our
[12:51] verse for 2026, or at least my verse was
[12:54] uh Psalm 16:8. I've set the Lord always
[12:57] before my face. I've set the Lord. He's
[12:59] at my right hand. Therefore, I shall not
[13:01] be moved.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody can move you, Brother Chris. I
[13:05] don't know why I use Brother Chris.
[13:06] Brother Jose, nobody can move you,
[13:08] Brother Jose. As long as you've set God
[13:10] before your face and you know you've
[13:12] done what God wants you to do.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[13:16] righteousness. Matthew 6:33. And all
[13:18] these things shall be added unto you.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; So if you seek God first and say, put
[13:23] God's face before you and say, I'm going
[13:24] to do this because God's word says so,
[13:27] then God will supply all your needs.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; I've seen that with nine children. God
[13:32] just continues to supply for all the
[13:34] needs. uh some somewhere somehow money
[13:36] will just come out of some place and God
[13:38] will help provide the needs of my family
[13:40] which I give thanks for.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Year after year, God is
[13:44] faithful. God is gracious and merciful.
[13:47] Now verse 22, many will say to me in
[13:49] that day, so this is this is an amazing
[13:51] scene here.
[13:54] Many will say, not a few, many will say,
[13:56] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[13:59] thy name? and in thy name cast out
[14:00] devils, and in thy name have done many
[14:03] wonderful works. Then will I profess
[14:05] unto them, I never knew you. Depart from
[14:08] me, ye that work iniquity. So, this
[14:10] shows lots of things. Miracles don't
[14:13] prove you're a believer.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's one thing that the
[14:17] the church world just they have a hard
[14:19] time grasping that. It doesn't matter
[14:21] what miracles you do. Get the miracle of
[14:23] getting saved first and being a worker
[14:25] of God's righteousness. AMEN. GET THAT
[14:27] miracle first. That's the miracle that
[14:29] matters. Hallelujah. And notice Jesus
[14:32] did not correct them. Jesus didn't say,
[14:33] "No, you didn't cast out devils. No, you
[14:35] didn't prophesy." No, they did.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Because the word always corrects. Jesus
[14:40] Christ always corrected Mary, Joseph,
[14:43] who his brother and his sisters. Jesus
[14:45] corrected everybody. The Pharisees, the
[14:46] Sadducees, the publicans, but he did not
[14:48] correct these people, these many people
[14:50] on the day of judgment because they had
[14:52] done the miracles.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So friends, we can see this.
[14:59] We must do the will of God. We not we
[15:02] must not be workers of iniquity.
[15:04] Iniquity means lawlessness. In other
[15:06] words, I don't care what the Bible said.
[15:07] I don't care what my mom or if we're
[15:09] children. I don't care if what my mom or
[15:10] dad or grandma says. I'm going to do
[15:12] whatever I want. That's iniquity.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Now, for the adults, I don't care what
[15:16] the Bible says. I don't care what the
[15:17] pastor says. I don't care what uh the
[15:20] evangelist says. I don't care what the
[15:21] deacon says. You know, with that type of
[15:23] attitude, that's iniquity. But remember,
[15:26] if you confess it, God even forgives all
[15:28] iniquity. Amen.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; You just don't want to work it. You just
[15:31] don't want to get into the habit of
[15:32] doing iniquity. You want to get in the
[15:34] habits of righteousness, a life of
[15:36] integrity.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[15:41] Now, you say, "Brother Jesse, is there a
[15:42] scripture that says confidence without
[15:44] character?" Yes. It's in uh Proverbs
[15:46] 14:16. So, if you got that, let's read
[15:49] that. I was ready to preach this
[15:51] Wednesday, but I'm like, "I don't got
[15:52] enough time on Wednesday night."
[15:54] Hallelujah. I need a full service by
[15:56] God's grace. Amen, church. A wise man
[15:59] fearthth and departs from evil. See,
[16:01] we're not workers of iniquity.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; So, the w I'll put virgin in there. The
[16:06] wise virgin fearth and the church said,
[16:08] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[16:09] &gt;&gt; See, the wise virgin will leave the evil
[16:12] behind.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; But the fool rageth and is confident.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Now, did you see another Christian
[16:21] author fell this week? He's 8 78 years
[16:23] old and it just came out. He had an
[16:25] affair with a woman for eight years.
[16:27] Another one fell this week. Brother Ram
[16:30] said, Brother Ram said they drop like
[16:32] flies. Here's here's why they say he
[16:33] says they drop like flies. He said they
[16:35] start climbing up here, but then they
[16:37] fall off. So this man sold 15 million
[16:39] copies of Christian books, but he never
[16:41] got here because he committed adultery
[16:43] for eight years with his against his
[16:45] wife. Think about that. You can sell 18
[16:48] million books, I'm sorry, 15 million
[16:49] books and still not have temperance.
[16:51] boy, he had knowledge. I read one of his
[16:53] books. It was a pretty nice book, but he
[16:56] never even got that high because he was
[16:58] a an adulterer. And the Bible said
[17:01] adulterers God will judge.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; So So friends, what am I saying? Make
[17:06] sure this year, this 2026, add to your
[17:09] faith. You've got faith or you wouldn't
[17:10] be a Christian. You add to your faith.
[17:12] Add some virtue to that. Right? Virtue.
[17:14] Hallelujah. And then add some knowledge,
[17:16] understanding. Then add temperance so
[17:18] you can control your sensual passions.
[17:20] And then add patience so you CAN BE
[17:22] PATIENT WITH GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; And then ADD TO THAT GODLINESS SO YOU'RE
[17:26] LIKE GOD. YOU CAN LOVE your enemies. And
[17:28] then get brotherly kindness so you can
[17:29] love PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH. AND THEN GOD
[17:31] WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST.
[17:32] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. That's right.
[17:34] Hallelujah.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; That and that's the wise virgin. They
[17:38] depart from evil. But the fool rageth
[17:41] and is
[17:43] confident without character. That's what
[17:45] Israel was. THEY SHOUTED SO LOUD THAT
[17:48] THE ENEMY HEARD THEM MILES away and then
[17:51] 30,000 died.
[17:54] Church, you can have confidence without
[17:55] any Christian character. Brother Chris,
[17:59] &gt;&gt; we're going to get to that. Good
[18:00] question, buddy. You're getting to my
[18:02] punch line. Amen.
[18:04] That's great, brother. Good question.
[18:06] All right. Now, you see it now. Brother
[18:08] McBride called this a false sense of
[18:10] security. And I was like, "Oh, let me
[18:12] find some more examples of this."
[18:13] Matthew 7.
[18:15] Now before we move on, remember
[18:19] uh with this Judas Escari group, this is
[18:21] the Judas Escariat group that has
[18:23] confidence but no character.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:28] Now I preached a few years ago on this
[18:30] when brother William was here. 13
[18:32] metaphors for the Judas Escar group. So
[18:35] the Judas Escar group will be
[18:37] shipwrecked. Their ships won't reach the
[18:39] destination. Now these are all Bible
[18:41] verses.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Make sure your ship makes it to land.
[18:45] through the storms of life.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; They are they war against God. They're
[18:51] fighting a war against God. They're
[18:53] falling away or which is also a
[18:55] desertter. They're running away from
[18:56] their post of duty. That's why people
[18:58] run away from church. Fourth, they're
[19:01] offended or stumble. They stumble at the
[19:03] word of God. They trip over the word of
[19:05] God. Fifth, they're cut off or cast
[19:08] forth from the body of Christ. Sixth,
[19:10] they're cast away. Hallelujah. They're
[19:13] cast away. They lose. They they they go
[19:15] astray from their route and they're cast
[19:16] away. Seventh, they return back to
[19:19] Sodom. These are all Bible verses.
[19:21] That's what Judas did. He went back to
[19:22] the world, right? He sold out Jesus.
[19:26] Eighth, they had itching ears. Oh,
[19:27] somebody just come itch my ears and
[19:29] speak pleasant things unto me instead of
[19:31] these hard sermons that you preach.
[19:34] Number nine, they got hard hearts.
[19:37] Number 10, they crucify Jesus aresh.
[19:40] Number 11, they trample underfoot the
[19:42] son of God. They say, "I don't care what
[19:44] the Bible says. Nobody's going to tell
[19:46] me what to do." Number 12, they get
[19:48] entangled. So, they get trapped and
[19:50] entangled in the traps of the world. And
[19:53] number 13, 13, they get uprooted or
[19:56] plucked up by the roots.
[19:58] Now, church, that sounds awful, but
[20:00] that's not our destiny.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Our destiny is our ship will not wreck
[20:06] because Jesus is in the ship.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Our destiny is we'll war
[20:10] against the devil and we'll fight for
[20:12] God.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; I will abide in Christ because I've
[20:16] deserted the world. I've run to Jesus.
[20:19] Jesus is my city of refuge.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; God will keep my feet from stumbling. I
[20:25] won't stumble.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. I WILL REMAIN ATTACHED TO
[20:30] JESUS. HE'S THE BRANCH. And then I'll be
[20:32] gathered into his garner.
[20:34] I will stand every attest approved by
[20:37] God.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; I will stay out of Sodom LIKE ABRAHAM
[20:41] AND I'LL PRAY FOR THE LOTS THAT ARE IN
[20:43] SODOM.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Like I was yesterday. Amen.
[20:46] Like you should pray for the the lots
[20:48] that are still in Sodom.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; My ears will hear what the spirit's
[20:52] saying to the church and I'll reject
[20:54] anything that's contrary.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; I will let the Holy Ghost write his word
[20:59] upon the fleshly table of my heart. I
[21:02] will crucify the affections and the lust
[21:05] thereof, and I will show forth the death
[21:07] of Christ in my life.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; I will let the Lord put every devil
[21:12] under my feet because you and I are the
[21:15] woman's seed. Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:18] I will let the Lord Yes, I'm sorry. I
[21:20] read that. I'LL REMAIN FREE from Satan's
[21:22] tangling traps, for I am free indeed
[21:24] because the sun has set me free.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; And number 13, are you counting? 13 is I
[21:30] remain planted in the word, growing up
[21:32] into Christ into all things, drinking of
[21:35] his holy water. And that's what we're
[21:37] drinking today. Hallelujah. It's not the
[21:39] wine THAT'S HOLY, BUT IT REPRESENTS THAT
[21:41] I'M DRINKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT. I'M
[21:43] THIRSTY, SO I GET A DRINK OF THE HOLY
[21:45] SPIRIT, and my thirst is quenched. I
[21:47] DON'T THIRST FOR THE THINGS OF THE
[21:49] WORLD.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Hallelujah.
[21:55] Now, let me do this balance here as I
[21:56] was as I was preparing.
[21:58] Israel had a shout but no character.
[22:01] But then there's times the people of God
[22:03] did have a shout and they did get the
[22:06] victory.
[22:08] Hallelujah. Now put up Acts 2:33.
[22:10] Malachi. Remember every person that's
[22:12] born again. I'm going to break into this
[22:13] thought here before I get to the main
[22:15] point.
[22:18] When you get the Holy Ghost, it's got to
[22:20] be something that people can see and
[22:23] hear.
[22:24] If you don't, you got to keep seeking
[22:26] God because you're off the scripture.
[22:30] Every person that was born again had
[22:32] some experience that they could see or
[22:34] hear.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; And brother said it might be crying. He
[22:38] said it might be shouting. He said it
[22:41] might be uh dancing. It might be
[22:42] speaking in tongues. It might be
[22:44] prophesying. But you whenever a baby's
[22:46] born, I've seen nine of them born.
[22:49] Every time a baby's born, you can tell
[22:51] something happened.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; There was no baby before. Now I see a
[22:55] baby. Now there's life. I saw a large I
[22:59] saw a large round uh stomach, we'd say,
[23:02] or belly. But now I see a baby here. A
[23:05] baby is crying. It's making noise. Help
[23:07] the baby.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Take care of the baby. A new life has
[23:10] emerged. When you get THE HOLY GHOST, A
[23:12] NEW LIFE EMERGES. HALLELUJAH.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Something happens. YOU GOT TO GIVE IT
[23:16] LIFE. I NEED MORE OF THE WORD. I NEED
[23:18] MORE of the scripture. I need more
[23:20] prayer. I NEED MORE WORSHIP. A NEW LIFE
[23:22] HAS COME FORTH.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. People
[23:26] say they're born again and don't feed on
[23:28] the word of God. It's very likely
[23:30] they're not born again because they're
[23:31] feeding on the things of the world.
[23:33] WHETHER IT'S POLITICS OR whether it's
[23:34] worldliness or money, whatever it is, if
[23:36] they're feeding on things of the world,
[23:38] they're not feeding on God's word. We
[23:40] have a right to question, are they born
[23:42] again?
[23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; The real Holy Ghost when it falls, you
[23:48] can see it and hear it.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, "You must have an
[23:54] experience." Now, recently, I've got
[23:55] numerous emails from people around the
[23:57] world. I would say maybe three or four.
[23:59] I could be wrong. Jose probably can see
[24:00] him online, too. Uh because he comments
[24:02] on my YouTube videos.
[24:05] And recently, this question has come up.
[24:07] It's always about the experience.
[24:08] Brother Jesse, do I have the right
[24:10] experience? And I always say the same
[24:12] thing. You got to have some experience
[24:14] that people can see and hear. But
[24:16] recently, it just struck me and I shared
[24:18] it with these three individuals this
[24:19] week. I said, "Yes, make sure you have
[24:21] an emotional, supernatural, some type of
[24:23] experience where you're changed." But
[24:26] what struck me is that so many people
[24:27] are just focused on that experience.
[24:29] They're forgetting the life that should
[24:31] follow.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Because if you read read the church age
[24:35] book, Brother Ram says the evidence is
[24:37] being in the word all the way. That's
[24:39] right.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; So the it doesn't really matter which
[24:41] experience you choose. Was it dancing?
[24:43] Was it shouting? Was it crying? Was it
[24:45] weeping? What was it? Was it at the
[24:47] altar screaming? What was it? THAT
[24:49] DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. JUST CHOOSE ONE
[24:51] OF THEM. I'LL say it like that. And then
[24:52] make sure YOU'RE IN THE WORD ALL THE WAY
[24:54] AFTERWARDS. HALLELUJAH.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE THE LIFE OF THE WORD PROVES
[24:58] THAT WHATEVER EXPERIENCE IT WAS, IT WAS
[25:00] A GENUINE EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU WERE
[25:02] CHANGED.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; I saw I saw the change when there was no
[25:06] Tulsi and then I saw Tulsi. I SAW THE
[25:08] CHANGE. A NEW LIFE HAS EMERGED. AMEN.
[25:11] NOW, she still gets sick and sometimes
[25:13] you get sick spiritually.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Bless her heart. I hate to see sick
[25:18] babies, right? We hate to see sick
[25:19] Adena, but she's good today. Amen. But
[25:21] you know, all the children, in other
[25:22] words, all the children are going to get
[25:24] sick. Ell's going to get sick. You know,
[25:25] it's really sad. BUT A NEW LIFE HAS
[25:27] EMERGED. PRAISE GOD.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; And we all struggle. We all of of we all
[25:32] HAVE PROBLEMS. BUT THE question is, are
[25:34] you growing in to a real believer? Are
[25:37] you in the word all the way?
[25:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Or are you just into religion like
[25:41] Israel? They were just into having an
[25:44] ark without having godlike character.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; For us, it might be, well, I just if I
[25:50] just go to church, then I know I can
[25:51] have confidence. Well, church is good.
[25:53] That's part of it, but that's not all of
[25:55] it.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:24 and 25 says we should
[25:59] gather more and provoke one another to
[26:01] good works. WE SHOULD DO THAT MORE. SO,
[26:03] WE SEE THAT DAY APPROACHING. BUT THERE'S
[26:04] OTHER scriptures about praying and
[26:06] fasting and giving homes. There's so
[26:08] much more about forgiving. How about
[26:09] forgiving our loved ones? Praise God.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; How about that? THAT'S JUST AS
[26:13] IMPORTANT. IT'S JUST AS MUCH OF THE
[26:15] CHARACTER OF CHRIST AS ALL THE THINGS
[26:16] THAT WE NORMALLY DO. Praise God.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; But a person who's in the word all the
[26:21] way wants to do all the word of God.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Now, let me balance this out. Like I
[26:26] said, there's so many people that, well,
[26:28] not so many, but there there's people
[26:29] that are so so focused on the
[26:32] experience. And yes, you got to have it.
[26:34] But what's more important is the life
[26:36] that follows
[26:38] &gt;&gt; because that proves whether your
[26:39] experience was genuine or not.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham's talking about
[26:44] the still small voice. How many remember
[26:45] that from Elijah?
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Now, God was outside. Brother Chris, he
[26:49] was outside in the thunder, the
[26:51] earthquake, the fire, and the and and
[26:53] the uh what was the other one? Uh the
[26:56] wind. Maybe the wind. God was outside.
[26:58] But God didn't speak through all that.
[27:00] Eventually, God came down and whispered
[27:02] a still small voice, "Elijah, what are
[27:04] you doing in here?"
[27:06] &gt;&gt; God made all that noise out there. God
[27:08] was in all that. But God, it's not how
[27:10] God was talking to Elijah. It was in
[27:13] that still small voice.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; What doest thou here, Elijah? What are
[27:17] you doing in this cave? Church, the Holy
[27:19] Spirit whispered to your heart, "What
[27:20] are you doing in this backsliding
[27:22] condition? Good.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Lying, stealing,
[27:27] &gt;&gt; not forgiving, holding bitterness,
[27:29] &gt;&gt; committing sexual sin. That's what the
[27:30] Holy Spirit will say. Why are you doing
[27:32] this?
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Why are you here?
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the still small voice of the
[27:38] Holy Spirit is. Now, sometimes it's
[27:40] loud, right? We know sometimes God spoke
[27:41] loudly
[27:43] &gt;&gt; and God does that. But, brother, I'm
[27:46] showing how there's different types of
[27:47] experiences. This one with Elijah was a
[27:50] still small voice.
[27:53] Brother Ram says, "Now the world can out
[27:56] entertain the church." The church is not
[27:59] an entertainment and not it's not
[28:01] supposed to entertain. It's supposed to
[28:03] preach a new birth that makes a new
[28:05] creature in Christ.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Although I want you to smile and have a
[28:09] good time. I'm not here to make you
[28:11] smile. I'm here to preach the GOSPEL OF
[28:12] JESUS CHRIST SO EVERYBODY CAN BE BORN
[28:15] AGAIN.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. HALLELUJAH. I LIKE
[28:18] to see you smile. I I do want that. I I
[28:20] want everybody happy. Praise God.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; But it's not to entertain people.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; He said the world's looking for
[28:26] entertainment. Some social parties or
[28:28] some fantastic some sort.
[28:32] He says now it now look what brother
[28:33] says. It isn't always the noisy things
[28:36] that's great things.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Now for us we got to be careful. It's
[28:41] not always the noisy services that are
[28:43] the best services
[28:45] &gt;&gt; now. Yet there are right? So it depends
[28:47] what God's doing in that moment. That's
[28:49] why I want to show balance to this. He
[28:52] says, "It's not the noisy things." Now,
[28:54] you remember this quote, Brother said,
[28:55] "A wagon." So, if you have a wagon, like
[28:57] in your garden, a wagon can go out in a
[29:00] field when it's unloaded, it'll bump and
[29:02] rattle and make a bunch of noise. Come
[29:04] right back over them same bumps with
[29:06] loaded with good things and it won't
[29:09] even make a squeak. Why? It's loaded.
[29:12] What the church needs tonight is to be
[29:14] loaded, filled with, guess what he says?
[29:16] The love of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:20] That's what you AND I NEED. WE GOT TO
[29:22] GET FILLED UP WITH GOD'S LOVE. AND WHAT
[29:24] IS GOD'S LOVE? It's his longsuffering.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; It's truth. It doesn't rejoice in
[29:28] iniquity. HALLELUJAH. IT THINKKETH NO
[29:30] EVIL. PRAISE GOD.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD. AND THAT'S WHAT
[29:34] OUR WAGON SHOULD BE filled with.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; So, Brother says, "A wagon," and I've
[29:42] had these before. We don't have one
[29:44] anymore, but we used to have an old
[29:45] wagon. in it and it was wobbly and it
[29:46] would squeak, but then when you put
[29:48] things in it, then it it was nice and
[29:50] quiet, but you had to go slow or else
[29:52] it's going to tip over one way or the
[29:54] other. You got to be able to handle it.
[29:56] But he's saying an EMPTY WAGON IS LOUD
[29:59] MAKING ALL KINDS OF NOISE BECAUSE IT
[30:00] DOESN'T HAVE the love of God in it.
[30:02] Let's not be an empty wagon Christian.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Let's be a filled up wagon Christian.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; How you feeling, Brother Jesse? Oh, I'm
[30:09] so full of love today.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; I can hardly stand it, Nia. I got so
[30:14] much love in my heart. Hallelujah.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; That's why I walk slowly up to the
[30:18] altar.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; That's why I walk slowly in here. I
[30:22] shake hands and say, "God bless you."
[30:24] Because I'm filled with the love of God.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. And I'm shouting
[30:30] afterwards. Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother uses another story from
[30:35] Palm Sunday when Jesus came into
[30:37] Jerusalem fulfilling Zechariah 12 on the
[30:41] colt, the foul of an ass. remember that.
[30:45] And brother Ram says, "And people might
[30:47] tell you we're just too emotional."
[30:50] Brother Ram said it isn't emotion. Of
[30:52] course, it is in one way. It is emotion.
[30:57] But anything that hasn't got emotion is
[31:00] dead. So if your religion hasn't got a
[31:02] little emotion about you, you'd better
[31:04] bury it because it's dead. Uh-huh.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[31:09] &gt;&gt; "So, see, in one case, you can be so
[31:11] quiet and full of God's love. In another
[31:13] case, my man said, "IF YOU DON'T HAVE
[31:15] NOISE, YOU'RE DEAD."
[31:17] &gt;&gt; SO, what is it? Sometimes I'll have
[31:19] emotion. SOMETIMES I WON'T. BUT EITHER
[31:22] WAY, I'm filled with the love of God.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; So, you got to look at each case. Elijah
[31:30] didn't need noise because he was already
[31:32] in a depressed condition where he wanted
[31:33] to die. Brother Chris,
[31:35] &gt;&gt; he was asking God to let him die.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Totally depressed, running from a woman,
[31:39] Jezebel,
[31:40] &gt;&gt; backsliding, we'd say.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; So, he didn't need noise. He needed to
[31:44] hear the still small voice.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; But on Palm Sunday, they needed to hear
[31:48] the noise BECAUSE JESUS, GOD HAD ALREADY
[31:50] SAID it a thousand years before. If you
[31:53] don't CRY OUT, THE ROCKS WILL CRY OUT.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; There it is, BROTHER JOSE. SO, SOMETIMES
[31:58] THERE'S TIMES OF NOISE FOR GOD TO BE
[32:00] PRAISED. OTHER TIMES, GOD WANTS TO DEAL
[32:02] WITH YOU in a still small voice in a
[32:04] quiet way because you're in a dark
[32:06] place.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; And if you're in a dark place today, you
[32:09] don't have to be. God can bring you into
[32:11] the light.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; All it takes is confession.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Cleaning out your life, purifying your
[32:18] life, and God can bring you back into
[32:19] the light.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says again, this is baptism
[32:24] of the Holy Spirit 58. You know, it
[32:27] don't take a lot of hollering.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; It don't take a lot of screaming.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take a lot. Well, then
[32:35] what would we say? Just takes a little.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; He says that's all right. Nothing
[32:41] against it. It's all right. It don't
[32:43] take that. It takes a submitted heart.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Setting in heavenly places, feasting on
[32:50] the things of the spirit. Church, we got
[32:52] to enjoy the word of God.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; We have to enjoy this. And when we do
[32:57] that, then it really doesn't matter how
[32:58] loud you are because you're enjoying the
[33:00] word of God.
[33:02] Remember, we don't want to war against
[33:04] the word of God. Waring against the word
[33:06] of God, fighting against the word of God
[33:07] is actually a characteristic of the
[33:09] Judas group.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; It takes a submitted heart and that's
[33:16] what the spirit feeds on.
[33:18] Now look what brother Ram says. Does the
[33:20] spirit feast on emotion? He said, "Now
[33:22] listen, not all together.
[33:27] It brings emotion." He says, "So, let's
[33:30] balance that out. Sometimes the Holy
[33:32] Spirit wants you to give more worship."
[33:34] Give me an example, brothers. Yes. I'd
[33:36] love to.
[33:38] Remember when Jehoshaphat and Ahab's son
[33:40] came to Elisha and they said, "Give us a
[33:42] word of prophecy. We're going out to
[33:44] battle." What did Elijah, what did
[33:45] Elisha say? "Only because Jehoshaphat's
[33:47] here will I do this. But not because of
[33:49] Ahab's son."
[33:51] He said, "Somebody bring me a minstrel.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody go get a Somebody GO GET SOME
[33:57] STRINGS. LET'S START PRAISING GOD." AND
[33:59] THEN the Holy Spirit came on Elisha AND
[34:02] HE SAID, "MAKE THE VALLEY FULL OF
[34:03] DITCHES." HALLELUJAH.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; SO, he needed more emotion, more music,
[34:08] and then the spirit of God could work.
[34:10] Hallelujah.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; So, see, there's times that we have to
[34:14] give the sacrifice of praise. We have to
[34:16] worship and get in the spirit and then
[34:18] God will pour out some blessing on our
[34:20] lives.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; So, brother Ram says, "Does the spirit
[34:24] always need emotion?" HE SAID, "NOT ALL
[34:25] TOGETHER. NOT EVERY TIME, but sometimes
[34:28] God wants you to put more emotion into
[34:30] your worship."
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Remember, I preached
[34:33] on this last year. If you don't clap
[34:35] your hands and raise your hand at some
[34:36] point, you're backsliding because the
[34:38] Bible says raise your hands and clap.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It also says dance. So, if
[34:43] you haven't danced in a while, if I were
[34:45] you, I would just dance for God sometime
[34:46] to make sure I'm keeping the word of
[34:48] God.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that DOESN'T MAKE YOU
[34:50] SAVED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "LET THEM
[34:52] DANCE." HALLELUJAH.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said it's a season. It's
[34:56] either a time of mourning or dancing.
[34:58] You're telling me you're going to mourn
[34:59] every SEASON OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN ARE YOU
[35:01] GOING TO GET A DANCING SEASON?
[35:04] &gt;&gt; When are you going to get SOME JOY IN
[35:05] YOUR LIFE? WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET
[35:06] SOME VICTORY IN YOUR LIFE? THERE'S GOT
[35:08] TO BE A TIME TO DANCE AS WELL.
[35:09] HALLELUJAH.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[35:13] AMEN.
[35:16] Like I danced a few weeks ago when we
[35:17] preach on the water and the blood.
[35:18] Remember that? I just like I just
[35:20] started crying. I'm like, well, usually
[35:21] when I start crying, that's usually a
[35:23] good sign I need to dance around the
[35:24] church. Amen. That's a good sign to me
[35:26] because God is working on my emotions
[35:28] and I got to let that out. I want to
[35:30] show God how much I appreciate his word.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; And then the the blood and the water
[35:36] just became so real to me. And remember
[35:37] what I said? I said, I hope I remember
[35:39] that when we preach communion in a
[35:40] couple weeks. And here we are by God's
[35:43] grace.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit brought it back to my
[35:45] remembrance so I wouldn't forget. Now
[35:47] we're going to end with that in a little
[35:48] bit here by God's grace. Now I also
[35:51] shared these quotes. If you want to hear
[35:53] a good sermon on the Holy Ghost, listen
[35:55] to the fourth seal from Brother Brandham
[35:57] because the first hour, Brother Brandham
[35:59] talks about the baptism of the Holy
[36:01] Ghost. These are some of my favorite
[36:02] quotes. Listen what he says here. He
[36:04] said, "I know there's a lot of
[36:06] fanaticism and people carrying on." Now
[36:08] see, SO THE QUIET people that are
[36:10] normally quiet, they don't like to see
[36:12] people just carrying on and making
[36:13] noise. But brother says, I know there's
[36:15] that.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; He said, I know that.
[36:20] He says, and I know sometimes they do it
[36:22] when the music is jumping up and down
[36:24] and everything. I know how that goes.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; So brother said, quiet people look at
[36:29] look at people loud with music and
[36:31] they'll say they're just loud because
[36:33] they like to get loud with music.
[36:36] Well, guess what the loud people say?
[36:37] They're just quiet because they're
[36:39] backing on God,
[36:42] right? But then the the the quiet people
[36:44] can look at the loud people and say
[36:45] they're just putting on like they're
[36:46] just acting like it. But look what
[36:49] brother Ram says. Brother Ram said, "I
[36:51] believe that too." So Brother Ram
[36:52] believed him both loud and and and and
[36:55] quiet.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I've seen people as long
[36:59] as the music is playing, everybody was
[37:01] jumping and screaming. AND WHEN THE
[37:03] MUSIC STOPPED, it stopped."
[37:06] So, brother says, "I've seen people,
[37:08] they only get excited when the music's
[37:09] loud."
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, church, there's no music right now,
[37:12] AND I'M EXCITED. HALLELUJAH. WHY?
[37:14] BECAUSE IT DON'T TAKE MUSIC TO MAKE ME
[37:16] EXCITED. IT TAKES THE WORD BECAUSE THE
[37:18] WORD IS LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "THE SONGS JUST GET
[37:22] YOU OPEN FOR THE WORD," HE SAID. BUT
[37:25] IT'S ACTUALLY THE PREACHING OF THE WORD
[37:26] THAT BRINGS LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Songs will encourage you. Songs are just
[37:31] there to get your mind cleaned out, to
[37:33] transform your mind. So the word of God
[37:35] CAN COME IN AND TRANSFORM YOU.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "As long as the
[37:45] music's playing,
[37:47] people are jumping and screaming, BUT
[37:49] WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS, IT STOPS." Now
[37:51] remember what brother Ram SAID. HE SAID,
[37:52] "THAT'S STILL ALL RIGHT AS FAR AS I'M
[37:54] concerned as long as the people lives
[37:58] right."
[38:00] &gt;&gt; So see, some people are more quiet,
[38:02] Sister Beatatric. Americans, I'll just
[38:04] say it like that.
[38:06] And then you got Africans. They're just
[38:08] naturally more into it, right? They
[38:10] enjoy the louder and the dancing.
[38:11] They'll dance every service. Is that
[38:13] right? They'll dance. They dance every
[38:15] And we just have to have a dance service
[38:16] just so to make sure people dance
[38:18] sometimes because we're just in
[38:20] different cultures, right? That that's
[38:21] what's expected in Africa. Well, this is
[38:23] what's expected in America. But brother
[38:26] says, EVEN IF YOU JUST EVEN IF IT TAKES
[38:28] IF IT JUST TAKES Malachi and Victoria to
[38:31] get you going so you can finally jump
[38:32] and praise the Lord. BROTHER SAID THAT'S
[38:34] FINE AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING RIGHT.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; So if it takes music to get you
[38:41] emotional, get emotional. If you don't,
[38:43] YOU DON'T. JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE LIVING
[38:45] RIGHT. Make sure you're a worker of
[38:47] righteousness and not a worker of
[38:49] iniquity.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Is that a good balance by God's grace?
[38:53] Yes, sir.
[38:55] Now, Brother Ram's talking about the
[38:56] evidence of the Holy Ghost, and he says,
[38:58] "We must wait until the Holy Spirit's
[39:00] done something like in Acts 2:4 where
[39:03] the Holy Ghost came upon them and they
[39:04] spoke in another tongue." He said, "Not
[39:08] necessarily because we spoke in
[39:09] tongues." It doesn't have to be speaking
[39:10] in tongues. It could be not because
[39:13] we've danced or we got emotional or we
[39:16] shouted. So, you list four things. Any
[39:18] of these things are fine if you get the
[39:20] Holy Ghost, right? Because you just have
[39:23] to have an experience where people can
[39:24] see something happen to you and they can
[39:26] hear something happen to you. Cuz that's
[39:28] what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's tongues dancing,
[39:34] shouting, screaming.
[39:37] He says until we're changed, until
[39:41] something actually happened. I don't
[39:43] care what form it comes in. Just so it
[39:47] happened. That's the main thing. Amen.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; So I I use this quote all the time when
[39:53] people email me about the Holy Ghost. I
[39:55] don't care what form you get the Holy
[39:57] Ghost in. Just get the Holy Ghost. And
[40:00] the main thing is have a have a
[40:02] experience where you know you were
[40:04] changed from that moment.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Now my testimony was again the day after
[40:09] I got married. So my wife married a man
[40:11] who wasn't full of the Holy Ghost. But
[40:12] the next day I got it. Brother Jose, I
[40:14] got something. Amen. Whatever I got,
[40:16] it's kept me this far. Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was love. I just
[40:20] felt so much love. I weeped and cried. I
[40:23] shouted at the top of my lungs. I had my
[40:25] hands raised just for a few minutes. And
[40:26] then I shook hands with everybody. And I
[40:28] just felt so much love. I just wanted to
[40:30] love everybody. I can look back to that
[40:32] moment and say, "I was changed. I cried.
[40:35] I wept. I shouted. I praised God.
[40:37] Something happened. Everybody could see
[40:39] it if they're watching." Praise God.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now I've got to make
[40:43] sure I live right. How do I live right?
[40:46] Seek ye first the kingdom of God and HIS
[40:48] RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND ALL THESE things will
[40:49] be added unto me.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Same for you.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, remember, Brother Ram
[40:58] says in the church age book, power
[41:00] without character is satanic. That's why
[41:02] 34,000 Israelis died.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; They had the power of the ark, but their
[41:11] character was contrary to the ark. They
[41:14] were sinful. The ark was holy.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; See, they should have matched their
[41:20] character. They should have lived holy
[41:21] lives in order to get the holy power.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Random uses this. Malachi, would
[41:27] you put up Romans 8 17 and 18? How many
[41:31] want How many want to be joints with
[41:33] Christ?
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Think about that. You inherit what Jesus
[41:37] inherits.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Joint heir. An heir is someone who gets
[41:41] an inheritance.
[41:43] If we're children, we're heirs. We have
[41:45] an eternal inheritance. Heirs of God and
[41:47] joint hes with Christ.
[41:50] And church, what what are some of those
[41:52] things? The white robe. Remember the
[41:53] white robe. We inherit a white robe as
[41:55] well.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I'm pretty excited, brother Jose. One
[41:58] day I just only I got to wear is white.
[42:00] I got one garment. I don't have to
[42:02] change different clothes and match and
[42:03] mix. I just got one set of clothing.
[42:05] It's my glorified body.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; It's a white robe. I don't have to
[42:10] wonder what am I going to wear today,
[42:11] Brother Chris? I'm going to wear white.
[42:12] WHAT AM WHAT AM I GOING TO WEAR
[42:13] TOMORROW? I'M GOING TO WEAR WHAT? WHAT
[42:15] AM I GOING TO WEAR THROUGHOUT ALL
[42:16] ETERNITY? I'M GOING TO WEAR WHITE
[42:17] BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF
[42:19] SAINTS. IT'S THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JESUS
[42:21] CHRIST.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; I can't wait till I get that change of
[42:25] garment. Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:28] If so be that we suffer with him that we
[42:31] may also be glorified together.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; So the only way you get the white robe
[42:37] or you get an inheritance is if you
[42:39] suffer as a Christian. Now, I'm going to
[42:42] preach a sermon maybe uh Wednesday about
[42:45] many are the afflictions of the
[42:47] righteous.
[42:48] Now, your afflictions, Brother Chris,
[42:50] might be different from mine, Brother
[42:51] Vang. Yours might be different from
[42:53] mine, but we have many afflictions.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; And church, if you can just recognize
[42:59] I'm suffering through an affliction, if
[43:02] you can just recognize that and keep
[43:04] praising God through that, then you will
[43:07] inherit what GOD HAS FOR CHRIST AS WELL.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:13] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[43:15] present time are not worthy to be cont
[43:18] compared with the glory which shall be
[43:20] revealed in us.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Since I'm there, let me give you a
[43:25] preview for Wednesday. Okay, everybody
[43:27] ready?
[43:29] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 1
[43:32] since I was already in Samuel because
[43:34] this is for sisters.
[43:40] Chapter 1 verse 11.
[43:43] You think, brother Jesse, you know, and
[43:44] and I said this too. Our afflictions,
[43:46] the Bible says, are just light
[43:47] afflictions.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Just light afflictions, right?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; But look at verse 11. What was Hannah's
[43:54] affliction?
[43:56] And she vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord
[43:58] of hosts, if thou will indeed look on
[44:00] thee, what?" Affliction of thine
[44:03] handmade. Her affliction was she
[44:05] couldn't have a baby because the Lord
[44:08] had closed up her womb and then uh her
[44:11] husband's other wife. Imagine that
[44:13] sisters having another wife with you.
[44:17] You're not the only wife. You got a wife
[44:19] to compete against. Thank God we're in
[44:21] the New Testament. And the church said,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; "Thank God we're not in the Old
[44:25] Testament days."
[44:27] And the Bible said and the Bible said
[44:29] earlier in chapter one that every year
[44:31] she would make fun of Hannah. In other
[44:33] words, she'd make her sore. She'd vex
[44:35] her. Oh, you don't have children. Too
[44:38] bad you don't have children, Hannah.
[44:40] Year after year after year. That was her
[44:43] affliction. Now, church, do we read of
[44:45] any other afflictions in her life? No.
[44:47] Even her husband's like, "I'm better you
[44:49] than 10 sons, honey. Imagine that.
[44:54] A husband so loving he treats you better
[44:56] than 10 sons." El kind of. Hallelujah.
[45:02] But church, if you can just recognize
[45:04] what's my affliction and if you CAN BE
[45:07] LIKE HANNAH, GLORY. SHE WENT DOWN TO
[45:09] CHURCH EVERY YEAR AND she started
[45:10] praying. Brother Chris, it wasn't it
[45:12] wasn't okay for her to be loud. She had
[45:14] to whisper. She was like, "Oh God,
[45:16] deliver me from my affliction." Eli
[45:17] comes around and says, "She's drunk.
[45:18] Stop drinking wine." And she said, "THIS
[45:20] AIN'T WINE. THIS is the affliction OF MY
[45:22] SOUL. I'M CRYING OUT TO GOD." AND THE
[45:24] SPIRIT STRUCK ELI AND SAID, "YOU'VE HAD
[45:26] YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR." AMEN.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. LOOK, QUIET PRAYER.
[45:32] SHE WAS QUIETLY PRAYING AND PLEADING TO
[45:34] GOD, "GOD, IF YOU GIVE ME A SON, I'LL
[45:36] GIVE HIM BACK TO YOU." NOW, how many
[45:37] would do that today?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; As soon as he was done weaning, which
[45:42] was like four or five years old, then
[45:45] I'm never going to see him except once a
[45:46] year I'm going to see him. How many
[45:48] women would do that today? Now, of
[45:51] course, it's hard to do, right? Unless
[45:52] you got a full-time pastor to church. We
[45:55] don't have that. We couldn't do it at
[45:56] our church. Amen.
[46:01] All right. Now,
[46:03] thank you. Now, brother Ram says these
[46:06] beautiful words. Unless we suffer with
[46:08] him, we cannot reign with him.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Now, church, we complain about our
[46:12] sufferings, but you must suffer if you
[46:14] want to reign.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, let's say this. Let's
[46:18] say, I'm going to stop complaining.
[46:20] Ready? I'm going to stop complaining.
[46:22] Because you have to suffer if you want
[46:24] to rain. Don't complain about what's
[46:26] giving you the character to reign
[46:28] someday.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Don't complain. I don't complain. Just
[46:32] reign. Hallelujah. Don't complain. Just
[46:35] reign over the afflictions that God in
[46:38] his wisdom has allowed to come to pass
[46:40] in your life. You have to suffer to
[46:42] reign. The reason for this is that
[46:44] character simply is never made without
[46:47] suffering.
[46:48] Character is a what, church? Victory.
[46:51] It's not a gift.
[46:55] You know, brother Chris, we look at
[46:56] brother's lives and we can say, "Wow, my
[46:58] brother McBride, boy, look at the
[47:00] character. Go, God really blessed him
[47:01] with character." That's the wrong thing.
[47:04] Now, you put any person in there you
[47:06] admire. I admire sister so and so. Look
[47:08] at sister so- and so. Wow, God really
[47:09] blessed her with character. No, she
[47:11] suffered to get that character.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; So, see, that's why we don't got to envy
[47:16] anybody. We just have to recognize what
[47:18] affliction did God give me? Help me to
[47:20] suffer through it. Help me to glorify
[47:22] God through it. Not to get shipwrecked
[47:24] because of my afflictions.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Not to sell out the gospel because of my
[47:28] afflictions, but to patiently endure
[47:30] them so someday I can reign with Christ.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know how these babies sleep
[47:36] through my clapping. Brother Vang,
[47:37] hallelujah.
[47:39] God give them a special anointing. I've
[47:40] seen it nine times. I still don't know
[47:42] how they do it. Praise God. I'm clapping
[47:44] and screaming there. Adena's sitting
[47:46] there enjoying her rest in the Lord.
[47:48] Hallelujah. God bless her.
[47:51] A man without character can't reign
[47:53] because power apart from charact from
[47:55] character is satanic. But power with
[47:57] character is fit to rule.
[48:01] Now I've been preaching 45 minutes.
[48:06] Let me see where I can close. I wanted
[48:08] to preach about an hour. Let me see.
[48:11] Okay. Now maybe I'll preach a part two
[48:13] Wednesday.
[48:14] So I had one, two, three, four, five,
[48:18] six, seven. I had seven more examples in
[48:21] the Bible where people had all this
[48:24] confidence, but they didn't have the
[48:26] character before God.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And so we know what God would do, right?
[48:30] God would let them fall because pride
[48:33] goes before the fall.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:45] Now, this was the whole point I want to
[48:46] bring here. Uh,
[48:49] you got your Bibles? Go to Isaiah 66:1.
[48:52] And I'm going to look up that verse
[48:53] because that just struck me. Isaiah
[48:55] 66:1.
[49:00] Why can't I remember what verse that is?
[49:11] Oh, there that's okay. Philippians
[49:14] chapter 2.
[49:25] Okay, thank you.
[49:27] Now, bring it I'm going to bring this
[49:28] down to close. I'm going to go back to
[49:29] Eli. Like I said, I got seven other
[49:31] examples of people that were confident
[49:34] but didn't have Christlike character.
[49:35] Therefore, they failed.
[49:37] But look at Isaiah 66:1. Thus sayith the
[49:40] Lord, the heaven is my throne. The earth
[49:42] is my foottool. Where is the house that
[49:44] you'll build unto me? Remember, remember
[49:46] Solomon already tried to build a house.
[49:47] Like what good is that? What good is it
[49:49] Solomon building God a house if he if if
[49:51] we saw on Wednesday he went and married
[49:53] a thousand women?
[49:55] &gt;&gt; What good is building a house of God?
[49:57] And then remember, brother Chris, he
[49:58] built houses of worship for all the
[50:00] other gods.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So what good if you're going to give
[50:03] love to all the demons? What good is
[50:04] building a house for God? God don't want
[50:06] that. God wants all of our love.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; See, so God's like, "What house?" This
[50:11] is already after Solomon. This is 200
[50:12] years after Solomon. What house you
[50:14] going to build me? Don't build me stuff.
[50:16] Just be faithful to me.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. Yeah. If you want to
[50:21] build a church for God, that's great.
[50:22] But be faithful to God.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Like recently, church, um I would say
[50:27] about three years ago, someone came to
[50:28] me and said the Lord
[50:31] told them to build a church. Listen
[50:32] church, they built a brand new church,
[50:35] but they never had a pastor set up. And
[50:37] so when they asked me about it, I said,
[50:38] 'Brother, you don't have a pastor
[50:40] ordained by another pastor. So you're
[50:43] outside of the will of God. I'm not
[50:45] going to come to your dedication. Now,
[50:47] all of you were invited. You probably
[50:48] don't remember. It was about three years
[50:49] ago, but you didn't see me go because it
[50:52] was against the plan of God,
[50:55] church, right?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; And now this uh this this it's just a
[51:00] little move. It started it's been going
[51:01] on for three years and now from what
[51:03] people tell me around there it's the
[51:05] church is dying out.
[51:08] So the point is what good is it to build
[51:10] a house if you don't follow the law of
[51:13] God for the house?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; It's good to build God a church. Don't
[51:18] get me wrong. God will bless you for
[51:20] that.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; But you need to obey the word of the
[51:24] Lord in the house of the Lord. And to
[51:26] this day, church, they still don't have
[51:28] a pastor.
[51:30] And you know what the brother, you know,
[51:31] the man who built it, you know, we had a
[51:32] preacher come in here and he told that
[51:34] brother, he said, "Why don't you just go
[51:36] to brother Jesse's church? They already
[51:37] got music and preaching and everything.
[51:39] Why would you build that church when you
[51:40] got Brother Jesse's church right there?"
[51:42] But he didn't like that. Which is fine.
[51:44] He don't have to come here. But look,
[51:46] look here. We can look back three years
[51:48] later and one church is dying. But look,
[51:50] church, we're still going on by the
[51:52] grace of God.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And that church still isn't obeying the
[51:56] word of God.
[51:58] still doesn't have a pastor ordained by
[52:00] another pastor through the five-fold
[52:02] ministry. Oh, just so you know, brother
[52:03] Brooks's 70th birthday is coming up
[52:04] pretty soon because he's the pastor that
[52:07] ordained me. Okay, so if you want to
[52:08] wish him a happy birthday, it's January
[52:10] 31st. He's turning 70 by God's grace.
[52:12] Hallelujah.
[52:16] I didn't even get to my verse. Verse
[52:18] two. This is the verse. Now, I'm trying
[52:19] to bring this down. I've been preaching
[52:21] 50 minutes, so bear with me. To this man
[52:23] will I look. Who wants God to look at
[52:25] you? Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; I said, "Who wants God to look at you?"
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Church, you can take this verse today to
[52:32] God and say, "God, you promised you'd
[52:34] look at me if I did this."
[52:38] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes, church, we wonder, "Was
[52:39] God does God even see me?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Where's God?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; God, why don't you show up in my life?"
[52:44] Well, this is the kind of people God
[52:46] looks to.
[52:48] Hallelujah.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Jesse, I haven't felt God for so
[52:51] long. Do this. God promised he'll look
[52:55] at you.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; For all those things my hands have made,
[52:59] but to this man will I look, even to him
[53:01] that's what? Poor. That means humble and
[53:06] a contrite spirit. Actually got the
[53:07] Hebrew definition, too. Poor means
[53:09] afflicted, humble. There's the
[53:11] affliction. Many are the afflictions of
[53:15] the righteous.
[53:16] Who does God look at? God looks at the
[53:18] person that's afflicted, that's humble
[53:21] because of their trials.
[53:24] and of a contrite. Who knows what
[53:25] contrite means? Smitten,
[53:28] dejected spirit.
[53:31] Huh? You mean God doesn't look at all
[53:32] the people that are happy and confident,
[53:34] rejoicing and joyful all the time? Not
[53:36] all the time. See, people could just be
[53:38] putting that on. People like the
[53:40] denominations, they just pretend to have
[53:42] that and they disobey God's word. Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; But God wants to find somebody who obeys
[53:48] the word of God, who is humble and
[53:52] smitten. And what do they do at the word
[53:54] of God? Do they laugh at it? Do they
[53:56] joke about it? Do they tease with it?
[53:58] They tremble at it.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; That means they really take what brother
[54:04] Jesse's saying seriously.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; They're not just, uh,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; when are you gonna be done, preacher?
[54:10] Can we go? It's lunchtime. Now, most
[54:13] people don't do that here.
[54:15] Most people don't do this, but I've had
[54:16] in the years past when people leave and
[54:18] they accuse me of things. I've had just
[54:20] them roll their eyes at me and just look
[54:22] mean at me. You should see some of the
[54:23] faces I've seen over the years. So, I'm
[54:26] happy when I see happy faces.
[54:28] Brother Ram said it's the devil who's
[54:30] getting exposed when that happens.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; People get evil faces because they have
[54:34] evil spirits
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and then they leave and won't repent.
[54:38] That proves they have the evil spirit.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. But see, what is the what
[54:43] does the what does the believer do? He's
[54:45] humble. He smoke. He smoked. Remember
[54:47] the Bible said they their hearts were
[54:48] pricricked. Brother Chris on the day of
[54:49] Pentecost. Their hearts were PRICRICKED
[54:51] AND SAID, "WHAT SHALL WE DO?" SEE, you
[54:52] know you're smitten WHEN YOU SAY, "GOD,
[54:54] WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?"
[54:57] &gt;&gt; That's when your heart's smitten. You're
[54:59] poor and contrite. I'm humble. I'm
[55:01] afflicted. And I and my heart has smoked
[55:04] me. And say, "God, what do you want me
[55:05] to do?" And that's when you tremble at
[55:08] God's word.
[55:13] Now, would you put up there Malachi
[55:14] Philippians 2:12? This is the one that
[55:16] came to me while I was preaching. This
[55:18] is the New Testament version of it.
[55:21] Wherefore, my beloved, as you have
[55:23] always obeyed. How many are How many How
[55:26] many are trying to always obey the word?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Bless you. And not as in my presence
[55:31] only. Oh, how many try to obey it when
[55:32] the preacher's not around?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's I'm trying to do that, too. But
[55:37] now much more in my absence. Work out
[55:40] your own salvation with fear. And
[55:44] see, that's how you know you're close to
[55:45] God. When you'll tremble at the word and
[55:47] say, "I don't want to break one thing in
[55:49] here."
[55:51] That's when God will look on you. If
[55:53] you're pretending or just in a
[55:54] backsliding condition, God's not going
[55:56] to look on people like that. Is that
[55:59] clear?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; It's a good fresh reminder for us, isn't
[56:01] it?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And Paul, this is Paul. So Paul's
[56:05] agreeing with Isaiah because they're
[56:07] both prophets.
[56:09] So church, the question is as we go on
[56:11] and I'm finishing up here, the question
[56:14] is, what do you tremble at?
[56:20] Do you tremble at the pleasures of the
[56:22] world?
[56:23] Do you tremble at the news and my
[56:25] another war? Oh, what's going to happen
[56:27] to this? What's what do you what do you
[56:28] tremble at? Do you tremble at your
[56:30] husband or wife getting upset with you?
[56:33] Or do we tremble at the word of God?
[56:36] &gt;&gt; See, people tremble at all these things.
[56:39] All these things impact them. There's
[56:40] one thing that should tremble at us, and
[56:42] that's the word of Jesus Christ.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:48] Remember, Moses could stand in the face
[56:50] of Pharaoh, brother said, because he'd
[56:52] been in the presence of somebody greater
[56:53] than than Pharaoh.
[56:55] I love that quote. Amen. That's worth
[56:57] quoting all the time. Amen. If we could
[56:59] just get in THE PRESENCE OF SOMEBODY
[57:01] GREATER than Pharaoh or our boss or even
[57:04] the pastor or the preacher, the
[57:05] evangelist, whoever made, the teacher,
[57:07] if we can just get IN THE PRESENCE OF
[57:09] SOMEBODY GREATER,
[57:10] then we'll tremble at the word of God.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:19] Now, friends, remember, let's look at
[57:21] let's close with Eli.
[57:25] Let's go to back to 1 Samuel. We already
[57:27] there in 1st Samuel 1. Let's go back to
[57:29] 1st Samuel.
[57:32] Brother Chris, here's why uh they here's
[57:35] why they were defeated.
[57:38] That's a good question.
[57:41] Let's go to chapter
[57:49] Let's go to chapter two. Here's one
[57:51] reason they were defeated. They had
[57:53] corrupt leaders, brother Chris. That's
[57:55] why the Bible said a pastor must be
[57:57] blameless.
[57:59] Try to live si try to live as pure as
[58:02] you can to everybody. Hallelujah. At my
[58:04] job, here at the church, in my family, I
[58:07] try to live blameless. The pastor has to
[58:09] be blameless.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to make mistakes, but
[58:11] he's going to confess them. Hallelujah.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; But these leaders were not blameless.
[58:17] Look at verse 12. 1st Samuel 2:12. So,
[58:19] here we go, brother Chris. Now, the sons
[58:20] of Eli were sons of Satan. In other
[58:22] words, they they were they were serving
[58:25] God, but actually serving the devil.
[58:27] They're working for God, but serving the
[58:29] devil. And here's how here's why. They
[58:31] knew not God. And the priest's custom
[58:34] with the people was that when any man
[58:36] offered sacrifice, the priest servant
[58:38] came while the flesh was in seething
[58:40] with a flesh hook of three teeth in his
[58:42] hand, and he stuck it into the pan or
[58:44] kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the
[58:46] flesh hook brought up, the priest took
[58:49] for himself. So did all that sha in
[58:51] Shiloh unto all the Israelites that
[58:53] came. Now, Brother Chris, they would
[58:54] offer a meat sacrifice, right? A lamb,
[58:56] bullock. They were supposed to put the
[58:59] fork in there and then give the the
[59:01] piece with with uh the biggest piece
[59:04] with all the fat on it. That was to go
[59:06] to God. But these preachers had come in
[59:08] there and they changed it. Now they put
[59:11] the the fork in there and they took the
[59:13] best food even if it had meat on. I'm
[59:15] sorry, fat on it.
[59:17] In other words, God wasn't getting the
[59:19] first part of the sacrifice. Man was
[59:21] taking part of the sacrifice.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're supposed to burn the meat
[59:25] with that had the fat on it. And they
[59:27] were not to eat any fat. But now we know
[59:29] why Eli was overweight.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; He was eating the meat that had fat on
[59:34] it still too much,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; right? Because once you get sin, if you
[59:39] don't clean it out, it's just going to
[59:40] grow and grow and grow.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; The first time he did it, he's probably
[59:43] like, "Oh, is God gonna smite me dead?"
[59:44] And then next time it's easier easier.
[59:46] Pretty soon I'll take all I'll take the
[59:48] biggest choice of meat. Let me have that
[59:50] fat on it.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:55] This is why they were sons of the devil.
[59:58] And not only that, look at verse uh 15.
[1:00:02] Also, before they burnt the fat, the
[1:00:03] priest servant came and said unto this
[1:00:05] man that sacrificed, "Give me flesh to
[1:00:06] roast for the priest, for he will not
[1:00:08] have sod and flesh of thee, but raw."
[1:00:11] And if any man said unto him, let not
[1:00:13] let them not fail to burn the fat
[1:00:15] presently. So in other words, these men
[1:00:16] were saying, "No, NO, LET'S GIVE GOD the
[1:00:18] the meat first."
[1:00:21] Then what happened? "And then take as
[1:00:23] much as I so desires." Then he would
[1:00:25] answer him, "Nay, but thou shalt give it
[1:00:27] to me now. And if not, I'll take it by
[1:00:29] force."
[1:00:31] In other words, I'm going to force
[1:00:32] myself and take this meat that belongs
[1:00:34] to God because I want the best pieces.
[1:00:38] And the man's even like, "Just give it
[1:00:39] to God and then you can have your
[1:00:41] choice." In other words, you can choose
[1:00:42] to meat before me, but just give God the
[1:00:45] first.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And they're like, "No, I'm going to take
[1:00:48] it by force. I'm going to do what I
[1:00:49] want." Even though the word of God says,
[1:00:51] "Give God the fat first."
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Now, what did this cause?
[1:00:57] Verse 17. Wherefore the sin of the young
[1:01:00] men was very great before the Lord, for
[1:01:01] the men abhored offering of the Lord.
[1:01:04] So, Brother Chris, because of their sin,
[1:01:06] everybody hated coming to church.
[1:01:09] Hallelujah. Now, we shouldn't feel like
[1:01:11] that. We should feel happy coming to
[1:01:12] church.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "If God's in your
[1:01:15] heart, you can't wait for those doors to
[1:01:17] open."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And if I sin or any preacher, Simon,
[1:01:20] Cam, anybody, Brother Brooks, anybody
[1:01:22] that preaches here sins, you go talk to
[1:01:24] them one-on-one, face to face like Jesus
[1:01:26] says.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's that's the word of God. Amen. So
[1:01:31] in other words, our services should be
[1:01:32] should not have this. People should love
[1:01:34] coming to worship.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Ah yes. Amen.
[1:01:40] Now go to verse 22. Here's the second
[1:01:42] reason. So the first reason they
[1:01:44] polluted the worship and the worship was
[1:01:46] man-c centered instead of God- centered.
[1:01:49] It was all about man, not about God. God
[1:01:52] didn't get the worship he deserved. Now
[1:01:55] verse 22 is sexual sin. Brother Chris.
[1:01:57] Now Eli was very old and heard all that
[1:01:58] his sons did unto Israel and how they
[1:02:01] lay with the women that assembled at the
[1:02:02] door of the tabernacle of the
[1:02:03] congregation. So these men, brother
[1:02:05] Chris, after taking the food, they say,
[1:02:07] "Oh, you got a beautiful wife. Let me
[1:02:08] talk to your wife over here. Let me get
[1:02:10] your number."
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they would sleep with
[1:02:13] them. There's my hour.
[1:02:17] So not only were they forcing themselves
[1:02:20] and taking away God's worship, they were
[1:02:22] also sleeping with the men's wives. Now,
[1:02:24] that also shows the wickedness of those
[1:02:26] women, too.
[1:02:33] Hallelujah.
[1:02:35] I can see I'm not going to finish this
[1:02:36] here, so I better uh So, Brother Chris,
[1:02:39] let's let's finish with this. 1st Samuel
[1:02:41] 7. Let's go to 1st Samuel.
[1:02:46] Actually, you know what? Go to go to 1st
[1:02:47] Samuel 4 first. Now, here's a story.
[1:02:50] Here's another story. after they lose
[1:02:52] 30,000 in 1st Samuel 4 um let's go to 13
[1:02:58] 1st Samuel 4:13 and when he came low Eli
[1:03:01] sat upon the sea by the wayside watching
[1:03:04] for his heart trembled for the ark of
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:08] and when the man came into the city he
[1:03:10] told it and all the city cried out so
[1:03:12] let me back around this so brother Chris
[1:03:15] we saw how early in the chapter 34,000
[1:03:17] died they went out for another battle
[1:03:20] and the Philistines means took the ark
[1:03:22] away. Now, Israel don't even have the
[1:03:24] ark. And so, the man comes back and
[1:03:26] says, "Eli, we lost the ark." And Eli
[1:03:29] was trembling for the ark. Now, look, he
[1:03:31] trembled for the ark, but he didn't
[1:03:32] tremble with obeying the word of God.
[1:03:36] And the Bible said he fell over because
[1:03:38] he was heavy. He was obese.
[1:03:42] Look at verse 18. And it came to pass
[1:03:44] when he made mention of the ark of God
[1:03:45] that he fell from off the seat backward
[1:03:47] by the side of the gate and his neck
[1:03:49] break and he died for he was an old man
[1:03:50] and heavy and he had judged Israel 40
[1:03:53] years. All right. So because they were
[1:03:58] taking the meat he got heavy. He was now
[1:04:01] church this is the thing too. He allowed
[1:04:03] his sons to sleep around and Eli could
[1:04:06] have removed them from being priests.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So he saw sin. That's another reason,
[1:04:11] brother Chris, he saw sin in the church
[1:04:13] and didn't take it out of the church.
[1:04:16] Another one, brother Chris, is that he
[1:04:18] neglected
[1:04:20] the ministry of God. In 1st Samuel 3:3,
[1:04:23] Malachi, can you put that up there? And
[1:04:25] he air the lamp of God went out in the
[1:04:27] temple of the Lord where the ark of God
[1:04:29] was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep.
[1:04:32] So, brother Chris, remember we have the
[1:04:33] outer court where they kill the
[1:04:34] sacrifices and wash them. The inner
[1:04:37] court was the candlestick.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. Also, the altar of incense
[1:04:41] and the table of shoebre.
[1:04:44] And then in the holiest of holies was
[1:04:45] the ark of the covenant.
[1:04:48] No, the burnt offering was in the outer
[1:04:50] court. That was the first altar. They
[1:04:52] called the the brazen or brass altar. So
[1:04:55] in other words, Eli had also neglected
[1:04:57] the holy place. He stopped lighting the
[1:05:00] lights. And God saw that. So see, he was
[1:05:04] breaking the word of God in so many
[1:05:05] ways. He wasn't faithful with the
[1:05:07] lights. He wasn't faithful with his
[1:05:08] children. He wasn't faithful with his
[1:05:10] health and the church said
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and he was letting his sons sleep around
[1:05:15] and also make the worship a disgusting
[1:05:17] thing or a hateful thing. They hated
[1:05:19] coming to church because it wasn't about
[1:05:21] God. It was about people getting money
[1:05:23] and getting the best food.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Thank God our church isn't like that.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] Now,
[1:05:34] let's go to chapter seven.
[1:05:37] And I'm closing with this. hour and four
[1:05:39] minutes.
[1:05:42] Now, church, you know the story. Eli
[1:05:43] dies, Samuel grows up, and the first
[1:05:46] time they go out to battle when they got
[1:05:48] the ark of the covenant back. You
[1:05:50] remember what happens? It was the battle
[1:05:52] at Mispa and they set up an Ebenezer,
[1:05:55] that's why we sang that song, come thou
[1:05:57] fountain. Here I raise my Ebenezer.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Now, let's see, church, how do they get
[1:06:03] the character
[1:06:05] with the confidence? Verse
[1:06:12] one. And the men of Kirjath Jereim came
[1:06:15] and fetched up the ark of the Lord and
[1:06:16] brought it into the house of Abinadab in
[1:06:18] the hill and sanctified Eleazar's son to
[1:06:20] keep the ark of the Lord. And it came to
[1:06:22] pass while the ark abode in Kirjath
[1:06:24] Jereim that the time was long for it was
[1:06:26] 20 years and all the house of Israel
[1:06:28] lamented after the Lord. See church,
[1:06:30] sometimes God gives you a long season to
[1:06:32] think about your ways.
[1:06:35] 20 years since 34,000 people died.
[1:06:39] Sometimes God wants you to wait it out
[1:06:42] and think about your mistakes.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And Samuel spoke unto all the house of
[1:06:49] Israel, saying, "If you do turn unto the
[1:06:52] Lord with all your hearts," what's that
[1:06:54] sound like? Elijah shall come and turn
[1:06:57] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:06:59] fathers. Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH. HALLELUJAH. NOW,
[1:07:04] of course, it's not this is not Elijah,
[1:07:05] but we get the same idea. A prophet,
[1:07:07] SAMUEL WAS A PROPHET. A PROPHET HAS TO
[1:07:10] COME, brother V, to turn our hearts back
[1:07:11] to the apostolic fathers. Aren't you
[1:07:13] glad brother Ram came? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] The assembly of God, Sister Beatric, THE
[1:07:19] ASSEMBLY OF GOD COULDN'T turn my heart
[1:07:20] back.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; But the message of a prophet could turn
[1:07:24] my heart back to the apostolic father.
[1:07:26] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY I'M here today. Amen.
[1:07:29] Because God sent brother Brandham and
[1:07:31] then faithful men preached. It's brother
[1:07:33] Ram's Bible based message. That's why
[1:07:35] we're here today.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Now, here it is, brother Chris. The the
[1:07:41] last one that I'll show. Then put away
[1:07:43] the strange gods and ashtrath from among
[1:07:46] you and prepare your hearts unto the
[1:07:49] Lord and serve him only. And he will
[1:07:51] deliver you out of the hand of the
[1:07:52] Philistines. So what' they do? Verse
[1:07:54] four. And the children of Israel did put
[1:07:56] away Balam and Ashth and serve the Lord
[1:07:59] only. So, sexual sin, greedy preachers
[1:08:03] getting fat, right? Huh?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Sexual sin. Not taking care of the house
[1:08:10] of God, letting the lamps go out.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Eli not taking his sons out of positions
[1:08:16] of leadership. And now we see the next
[1:08:18] one, Brother Chris. The almost the rest
[1:08:20] of the entire nation had idols and they
[1:08:22] were bowing down and worshiping other
[1:08:23] gods.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Like today, they bow down to worship to
[1:08:26] the the gods of Ohio State Buckeyes and
[1:08:28] Cleveland. of Cavaliers and Cleveland uh
[1:08:31] Indians and Cleveland Browns. Right,
[1:08:33] brother?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Or they bow down to the I'm gonna be a
[1:08:36] millionaire someday or now it's
[1:08:38] billionaire. I'm gonna be a billionaire.
[1:08:39] And they bow down at the gods of money
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; or I got to have sexual sin. They bow
[1:08:45] down at the altar of a sexual sin.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And God said, "You're not going to get
[1:08:50] victory living that kind of a life. If
[1:08:52] you want confidence, let's have the
[1:08:54] character of Jesus Christ."
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] So that's the last one there, brothers,
[1:08:59] sisters.
[1:09:03] Now what' they do? Verse five. And
[1:09:05] Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to
[1:09:06] Mispa, and I'll pray for you unto the
[1:09:08] Lord." See, now that you repent and get
[1:09:11] the sin out of your life, now the
[1:09:13] preacher can pray."
[1:09:16] And they gathered together to Mispa and
[1:09:18] drew water and poured it out before the
[1:09:20] Lord, a drink offering, and fasted on
[1:09:23] that day and said, "There, we have
[1:09:25] sinned against the Lord." And Samuel
[1:09:27] judged the children of Israel and Mispa.
[1:09:29] And when the Philistines heard that, the
[1:09:30] children of Israel were gathered
[1:09:31] together of Mispa. The lords of the
[1:09:33] Philistines went up against Israel. And
[1:09:35] when the children of Israel heard it,
[1:09:36] they were afraid of the Philistines. But
[1:09:38] now the church, even though they're
[1:09:39] afraid, now they've got character.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Because now they're not bowing down to
[1:09:45] sexual sin, riches, right? Cares of the
[1:09:48] world. They're not bowing down to these
[1:09:50] things. Although they're afraid now
[1:09:52] they've got confidence in God and God's
[1:09:54] servant, Samuel.
[1:09:57] That's right. And the children of Israel
[1:09:59] said to Samuel, "Cease not to cry unto
[1:10:00] the Lord our God for us, that he will
[1:10:02] save us out of the hand of the
[1:10:04] Philistines." Does that remind you of
[1:10:05] anything? Pray without ceasing.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray without ceasing. They're
[1:10:09] like, "Samuel, we've confessed all of
[1:10:11] our sins. NOW YOU JUST PRAY FOR US ALL
[1:10:13] THE TIME."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And Samuel took a suckling
[1:10:22] lamb. Does this surprise anybody? and
[1:10:24] offered it for a burnt offering holy
[1:10:27] unto the Lord. So we have water and we
[1:10:30] have blood.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Water. Pour out water. Fast. Pray.
[1:10:36] Blood.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Blood's forgiveness of sins.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Remember I showed you water represents
[1:10:42] cleanliness. The washing of water by the
[1:10:45] word. Water came out of Jesus side.
[1:10:47] Blood came out. Blood represents
[1:10:49] atonement, forgiveness.
[1:10:52] Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] And as Samuel was offering up the burnt
[1:10:57] offering, the Philistines drew near to
[1:10:58] battle against Israel. But the Lord
[1:11:00] thundered. Oh, we got seven thunders
[1:11:02] here. Amen. Which are the revelations
[1:11:04] contained in the seven seals.
[1:11:06] Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; With a great thunder on that day upon
[1:11:09] the Philistines and discomforted them.
[1:11:12] And the men of Israel went out against
[1:11:13] Mispa and pursued the Philistines and
[1:11:15] smoked them until they came unto Bethar.
[1:11:18] What's the difference? The difference
[1:11:20] was they've got the sin OUT OF THEIR
[1:11:22] LIVES. NOW THEY'VE GOT CONFIDENCE WITH
[1:11:25] CHARACTER.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I'VE CONFESSED ALL MY SINS. WE GOT THESE
[1:11:29] EVIL LEADERS REMOVED. WE'RE SERVING GOD.
[1:11:32] HALLELUJAH. WE GOT THE ARK OF GOD. AND
[1:11:34] NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET BEAT UP BY
[1:11:36] THE PHILISTINES. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
[1:11:37] DEFEAT THEM.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And church, you don't have to get
[1:11:40] defeated by besetting sins.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You and I don't have to be defeated by
[1:11:45] besetting sins. And the church said,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Put away any besetting sin.
[1:11:52] Go to God. Look to God and God will look
[1:11:54] to you and then God will give you the
[1:11:57] victory
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; because you have confidence with
[1:12:01] character now.
[1:12:03] That's right, church. Blood and thunder.
[1:12:08] Hallelujah. And then church, after the
[1:12:10] victory, what did Samuel do? Verse 12.
[1:12:12] Then Samuel took a stone and set it
[1:12:13] between Mispa and Shen, and called the
[1:12:15] name of it Ebenezer, saying, "Hitherto
[1:12:18] hath the Lord helped us." Let's stand to
[1:12:19] our feet. musicians can come. Now, this
[1:12:23] is why I chose to sing that song. Come
[1:12:25] thou fountain of every blessing. So,
[1:12:27] Haven, put that verse up there.
