[0:00] three I'd like to uh continue that
[0:02] thought I started last Wednesday night
[0:04] you know we sang that song I Just Want
[0:07] to Thank You Lord so we looked at
[0:09] recognizing your day well this week I
[0:11] listened to serpent seed and then uh
[0:13] perfect Faith Listen to Perfect Faith
[0:15] two times and then serpent seed twice
[0:18] and uh I started a third time on perfect
[0:21] faith today so I don't know if I'll get
[0:22] to perfect Faith tonight but uh we'll
[0:24] definitely do uh serpent seed tonight by
[0:26] God's
[0:28] grace and you know like I said I'll
[0:30] bringing out you know numerous thoughts
[0:31] or highlights from this sermon from 1958
[0:34] but let's read Genesis 3:15 very
[0:35] familiar
[0:36] scripture grace of
[0:42] God maybe lyd can you give me a favor
[0:45] honey I forgot my 12 New Testament
[0:47] Mysteries book in there can you get it I
[0:48] think it's up against the wall I just
[0:50] want to read those nine points about the
[0:51] serpent seed that kind of prove it just
[0:54] as a visiting that one by God's
[0:57] grace thank you
[1:07] probably doesn't impact many people but
[1:08] I ordered 10 more copies of my books I
[1:11] ran out of the 12 mystery books been
[1:14] given a lot out um so I order 10 so if
[1:16] anybody wants one or wants to give one
[1:17] away you know they'll be in probably
[1:19] this week or next week and of course you
[1:21] can take anything out there give it away
[1:24] whatever you feel that to do by God's
[1:25] grace it's so wonderful you know Rod one
[1:27] to Ros and you know my brother
[1:30] thankful for that oh yeah I had another
[1:32] trucker uh I don't know one time I told
[1:34] you we pray for a man named Ralph he's a
[1:35] trucker and he said he's read through
[1:38] one of my books and was really blessed
[1:40] he was blessed to know that he saved by
[1:42] grace through faith you know a simple
[1:44] just a simple justification Doctrine he
[1:47] said God bless you for you know writing
[1:49] that and really helped me he must have
[1:51] been raised in maybe like a legalistic
[1:52] type of environment or something but
[1:54] just like Sunday morning I was so
[1:56] blessed to hear that message this is who
[1:57] we are I just I need reminders about who
[2:00] I am tell me Lord once again who I am to
[2:03] you amen Genesis 3:15 very familiar of
[2:06] course here's where God originated the
[2:07] serpent Seed
[2:09] doctrine Genesis
[2:13] 3:15 maybe wouldn't maybe we wouldn't
[2:15] call it a Doctrine necessarily I don't
[2:16] mean to be too technical but it's just a
[2:19] revelation I I put it in as part of the
[2:21] the mystery of iniquity how iniquity
[2:23] came into the world here's where it came
[2:25] in Genesis 3:15 so let's read that on
[2:28] three one two 3 and I will put enmity
[2:31] between thee and the woman and between
[2:34] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[2:37] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[2:40] let's have one more word of prayer ask
[2:41] God to bless our preaching here tonight
[2:44] father God we thank you for tonight Lord
[2:45] thank you God that we're on the highway
[2:47] to Heaven Lord God hallelujah we want to

[2:55] may we have faith God as we approach you
[2:58] here Lord to hear your word father Lord
[3:00] you know I've listened to these messages
[3:01] and trying to pull the inspiration from
[3:03] the Holy Spirit Lord I just kind of
[3:06] caught this inspiration recently Lord I
[3:08] want the Saints to know what we're
[3:09] singing about especially in this case
[3:11] lord it's a great review for me as well
[3:12] so father may we just be seated in
[3:14] Heavenly places here tonight Lord uh

[3:34] Lydia oh you didn't find it okay what
[3:36] did I do with that maybe I gave it away
[3:38] I must have gave it away all right no
[3:39] problem I think I got a PDF copy
[3:46] here so uh if you haven't listened to
[3:49] recognize your day's message or serpent
[3:51] seed or perfect faith I would encourage
[3:52] you to do that I really enjoyed it uh
[3:54] this week listen to that sorry I can't
[3:57] find that
[4:00] there it is
[4:11] okay okay so thank you for your patience
[4:14] here there it
[4:20] is I wanted to get those nine just to
[4:22] review real briefly here by the grace of
[4:24] the
[4:26] Lord nine points proven the serpent SE
[4:29] we've taught on this uh preached on this
[4:32] a little bit maybe not a whole lot
[4:36] um still kind of scrolling to see if I
[4:39] can find
[4:44] it oh there it is okay all right there
[4:46] thank you
[4:48] Lord I think I gave the last book away
[4:51] last week by God's grace brother Mercy
[4:53] took one and then the brother who came
[4:55] visited with him okay all right so we're
[4:58] set here thank you for so uh you know
[5:00] last week I had to cut it a little short
[5:02] uh you know I kind of went long but I
[5:04] had to cut short that sermon on
[5:05] recognizing your day and its message um
[5:08] one thing to keep in mind again is there
[5:10] you know we have a video about uh 30
[5:11] different verses brother brandom used to
[5:14] tell us what the message of the hour is
[5:16] you know Acts chapter 2 acts 238 Malachi
[5:20] 45 and 6 Luke 17:30 brother random uses
[5:23] some of those verses here in this sermon
[5:25] recognizing your day and his message but
[5:27] the main parallel he was taking
[5:30] was from Hosea 6 you know showing that
[5:33] Israel was in a backsliding condition
[5:35] yet they were the people of God but God
[5:37] would promise to restore Hallelujah and
[5:40] God has to do that in the church ages
[5:41] we're seeing that now in the seventh
[5:43] Church age God is restoring Hallelujah
[5:46] uh we're we're part of the restored uh
[5:48] book of Acts Church praise God
[5:51] hallelujah we're so grateful to be a
[5:52] part of that and uh thankful that we
[5:54] have the doctrine the love the power uh
[5:57] the spirit of a Christian Hallelujah
[5:59] thank God that we can have that original
[6:01] apostolic faith in the word of God we
[6:04] got it back hallelujah amen we're a part
[6:06] of that Hallelujah of course you know if
[6:08] you weren't raised in the message you
[6:09] know most of us are raised in
[6:10] denomination you know we can clearly see
[6:12] a huge difference between where we are
[6:14] now to where we were raised Hallelujah
[6:17] we can see a massive difference
[6:19] Hallelujah that this is a true book of
[6:21] Acts church
[6:23] amen so uh I'm not going to read through
[6:25] those 30 verses but I do uh I could I
[6:27] could do that but I just want to refresh
[6:28] you there's so much verses that tell us
[6:31] what our message is for today Hallelujah
[6:34] and I'm going to set a timer here just
[6:36] so I can watch it all
[6:39] right and so you know when I finish I I
[6:42] finished last week's message with
[6:43] brother Ram's statement that oh I love
[6:45] to hunt and fish he said but one moment
[6:47] of this is better than all of that
[6:49] hunting and fishing in other words
[6:51] brother Ram's True Heart his true love
[6:53] was to be gathered with the Saints his
[6:56] time with the Saints in church was more
[6:58] important than his leisure time
[7:00] praise God and that's why I've always
[7:02] said you know our highlight to our week
[7:04] should be Wednesday and Sunday and if we
[7:06] have a Saturday night concert that
[7:07] should be the highlight too amen
[7:10] hallelujah whatever uh whenever uh
[7:12] whenever the Saints are gathered that
[7:14] should be a highlight to our week
[7:16] Hallelujah and uh I love seeing that
[7:18] from brother brandom now one thing I
[7:19] left out didn't have time was right
[7:21] after brother Bram prayed for the people
[7:23] for their bad habits they fluster which
[7:25] isn't a word by the way it's
[7:27] frustrations uh fights he said fights
[7:30] stews
[7:32] fusses uh he he prays for them and then
[7:35] he says he says do you feel you're ready
[7:38] for the last
[7:39] trumpet Hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[7:41] the power of prayer you could have a
[7:43] fight during the week you could have a
[7:44] fuss you could have a bad habit during
[7:46] the week but you can come to church you
[7:48] can pray you can confess your sins and
[7:51] you can worship and trust God and in
[7:53] that moment you can feel ready for the
[7:55] Rapture praise God I just thought it was
[7:57] beautiful how brother brand he goes from
[7:59] that just people the Christians battles
[8:01] to total forgiveness through the blood
[8:03] of Christ and now I'm ready for the
[8:05] Rapture I know I don't know about you
[8:06] but I left Sunday feeling ready for the
[8:07] Rapture I want you to leave here tonight
[8:09] feeling ready for the Rapture praise God
[8:12] I know we all up here Saturday night
[8:13] feeling ready for the Rapture and I know
[8:15] you know Sunday night was a little more
[8:16] sobering message but it it blessed
[8:18] numerous people we got a comment online
[8:19] and you know uh at home we talked about
[8:22] it how it was a blessing uh to get that
[8:24] good message on forgiveness Hallelujah
[8:26] and brother am just a preview brother am
[8:27] says in perfect Faith he said per
[8:29] perfect faith is based upon
[8:32] forgiveness so just I thought that was
[8:34] so important it's really timely too if
[8:36] Lord willing next Wednesday I preach on
[8:37] perfect Faith Lord willing we'll see
[8:39] where God directs me but how brother
[8:41] random uh or how brother Brooks would
[8:43] preach on perfect faith I'm sorry
[8:44] perfect forgiveness really and that's
[8:46] necessary in order to have perfect Faith
[8:49] so it's very very wonderful and again
[8:51] just so as a a a reminder perfect faith
[8:54] is simply you've got a revelation God
[8:56] revealed his will to you and you know
[8:58] it's going to come to pass it's
[8:59] basically a prophecy but as I said
[9:02] before in those moments you and I we not
[9:04] prophets we really don't know we're
[9:05] prophesying right we just might feel oh
[9:08] God's going to do something here I
[9:09] really feel God's going to answer this
[9:11] person's prayer right but none of us
[9:13] will stand there and say thus sayith the
[9:15] Lord you know God heard Haven's prayer
[9:17] you know like we just might have this
[9:19] unction though like really feel like God
[9:21] heard that prayer I really feel like
[9:22] that's going to come to pass how many
[9:23] you ever had that before so that's like
[9:25] a prophecy right but we're not prophets
[9:27] where we'd have enough uh lead
[9:29] leadership to say that's thus sayith the
[9:30] Lord right that's a whole another level
[9:32] of a gift level of Faith level of
[9:35] Prophecy discernment you know it's it
[9:37] takes a higher level it takes a greater
[9:40] gift to say say something like
[9:43] that so uh brother Ram says he says you
[9:46] feel good now the congregation says amen
[9:49] you feel it's already now he said let's
[9:51] sing uh when the RS Called Up Yonder so
[9:53] they sing a couple of verses through
[9:55] that then he says he says let's raise
[9:56] our hands and say by thy Grace Lord the
[9:59] Cong says by thy Grace Lord uh when the
[10:02] RO is Called Up Yonder I'll be there how
[10:04] many trusting in God's grace amen oh
[10:06] yeah Hallelujah and then he says he ends
[10:08] this is the last quote I'm going to read
[10:09] and then we'll move on to serpent seed
[10:11] oh won't that be a time now listen here
[10:13] he's describing the day of the Rapture
[10:16] just walking along someday and hears
[10:18] appear somebody who is it
[10:23] mother amen it ain't going to be long
[10:26] now that's what we'll say if we see a
[10:27] loved one it ain't going to be long now
[10:30] now remember this is based upon Matthew
[10:33] 27 right they saw the dead Old Testament
[10:35] Saints rise first and then there was a
[10:38] resurrection 50 or I'm sorry uh 40 days
[10:42] after that sorry 40 days they were seen
[10:43] 40 days 40 days after that that's why
[10:46] brother B said about a month and a half
[10:48] after the the dead in Christ rise we'll
[10:50] be gone in the Rapture now it's not a th
[10:53] say the Lord but it's sure it's a
[10:54] scriptural pattern so we believe we
[10:56] could be wrong but we believe God do the
[10:58] same thing at the at that Resurrection
[11:00] as he did the same thing he did there
[11:02] he'll do it again by God's grace so
[11:05] you'll see someone that's passed on oh
[11:06] it's brother so- and so or brother Keith
[11:09] might see his wife Judy it's Judy I know
[11:11] I know it ain't going to be long now I
[11:13] mean it it could be that near right or
[11:15] it might be in another generation we
[11:17] don't know but that's the reality where
[11:19] brother Ram tries to bring it down
[11:21] confess all your bad habits your fights
[11:23] your stews your fluster and feel ready
[11:26] to go in the Rapture praise God that's
[11:28] how he ends this sermon what a beautiful
[11:29] thought recognize your name's message
[11:32] just in a few minutes you're changed he
[11:34] says and we'll meet them then be caught
[11:36] up together with them to meet the Lord
[11:38] in the air oh in a moment in the twink
[11:40] of an eye
[11:41] see now he named some brothers from his
[11:43] church that died he said here is brother
[11:45] Seward that old brother that used to be
[11:47] at the church here why here's brother
[11:49] dear you've heard probably on tape
[11:51] brother dear here's brother so and so
[11:54] well look you here they're all around me
[11:56] now wouldn't that be something amen
[11:57] hallelujah where you see in Saints all
[12:00] around you that were dead but now
[12:02] they're alive amen but we know in Christ
[12:05] you never die anyway cuz God is not the
[12:07] god of the Dead God's the god of the
[12:08] living
[12:09] hallelujah amen he said look they're all
[12:12] around me what's the matter here in just
[12:14] a few minutes I know they've done appear
[12:16] to me it ain't going to be long now I'm
[12:18] going to be changed now just in a moment
[12:20] oh yes he says when the morning breaks
[12:23] Eternal bride and
[12:24] fair Hallelujah now just as a side note
[12:28] brother BR said some some morning
[12:29] between 6 and 9 or 7 and 9 the Rapture
[12:32] would happen now we don't have any thus
[12:34] sayith the Lord for that that's the
[12:36] first watch of the day in Jewish time
[12:38] from 6:00 am to 9:00 am is called the
[12:40] first watch a watch lasts three hours
[12:43] right and so they would have that now
[12:47] the reason I don't know the reason but
[12:48] it seems the reason to me brother R
[12:49] thought that is because of Jesus
[12:52] resurrection it was right in the morning
[12:53] right that's when the dead in Christ
[12:54] Rose after Jesus rose it would have been
[12:56] early in the morning also you have the
[12:59] Holy Ghost fell at 9:00
[13:01] a.m. on day on the day of Pentecost 9:00
[13:03] a.m. is about the third hour of the day
[13:05] hallelujah amen you got some pretty good
[13:07] events that happen before 9:00
[13:09] a.m. we don't like to get up before 9:00
[13:11] a.m. or you might like to sleep in past
[13:13] 9:00 a.m. but God does a lot of great
[13:15] things before 9:00 a.m. the greatest day
[13:17] in history was of Resurrection
[13:19] Hallelujah right after 6:00 a.m.
[13:21] Hallelujah the first watch right right
[13:24] before you know uh you know the the
[13:26] women went went to the the the the Great
[13:29] grave the supplier right before the sun
[13:31] rose and when the natural sun rose the
[13:33] spiritual sun rose hallelujah amen well
[13:36] this be morning people I'm sure that
[13:38] morning we will be morning people you
[13:40] know why because we'll see them all
[13:41] around us hallelujah well there's
[13:43] brother so and so there's brother numer
[13:44] right Julia's dad passed away a number
[13:46] of years ago there's brother numer what
[13:48] other message people have passed away
[13:49] that we could say who is it brother
[13:52] there's brother James Browning amen
[13:53] hallelujah oh can you imagine seeing
[13:55] some of these Saints Hallelujah back
[13:57] from the dead Hallelujah am amen won't
[14:00] be long now he says now I want to get
[14:02] into this serpent seed sermon now from
[14:04] it's September 28th uh
[14:06] 1958 this is the first time think of
[14:08] that it's the first time he preached it
[14:10] think of that um and if you know
[14:12] anything about the message it's uh
[14:14] about6 minutes long so about a little
[14:16] over hour and 46 minutes um and if you
[14:20] know anything about it he he preaches on
[14:22] something else for the first 36 minutes
[14:24] he doesn't even talk about serpent seed
[14:26] for the first you ever done that before
[14:27] when I first came in the message I'm
[14:28] like I'm going to go listen to serpent
[14:29] seed I'm like when is he going to talk
[14:31] about serpent seed yeah haven't talked
[14:32] about the first 36 minutes I'm like when
[14:34] I got the right sermon here they did
[14:36] they put the right title on here well
[14:38] after 36 minutes he breaks into it
[14:40] because he spends the first 36 minutes
[14:42] reviewing his sermon why we're not
[14:44] denomination that's the sermon brother
[14:45] amen came into the message that that God
[14:48] had me preach back there in 2014 I
[14:50] always remember that so he SPS the first
[14:53] 36 minutes going over some of those
[14:55] major topics and then he says let me
[14:58] show you where all that came from and he
[15:00] goes back to Genesis right so where does
[15:03] the denomination come from Genesis any
[15:05] man-made religion comes from Genesis and
[15:08] who's the first man religion Cain right
[15:11] he goes back to Cain think about that to
[15:14] to to ask yourself where does the
[15:15] Catholic Church come from where does the
[15:17] Assembly of God you know where does the
[15:18] Christian Missionary Alliance where does
[15:20] the Baptist where does it come from Cain
[15:23] think about that where's brother Rah go
[15:25] to to find where do denomination start
[15:28] Genesis chapter 3 I'm sorry chapter 3
[15:30] I'm sorry Genesis chapter 4 sorry
[15:32] Genesis 4 where Cain sets up his altar
[15:35] right and he gets rejected Abel gets
[15:37] accepted because he brought the blood
[15:39] amen God always wants blood
[15:41] Hallelujah now um I want to just read a
[15:44] few important quotes out of here like I
[15:45] said I got about 40 or 50 minutes left
[15:47] on my hour
[15:50] here he starts by reviewing why we're
[15:52] not a
[15:53] denomination and he said I he said uh
[15:56] I've got to be so hard he said I've got
[15:59] to make it real strong against
[16:01] denominations he's going to tell us why
[16:03] at the end it's quite a statement he's
[16:04] going to tell us why at the
[16:06] end he says and this morning I believe
[16:09] uh he
[16:10] says the different articles that's come
[16:12] out through denomination that's
[16:14] absolutely not spoken the Bible so you
[16:15] know dominations put out they have
[16:17] conferences and they put out changes
[16:18] every year right Kristen used to be a
[16:20] part of the Lutheran so over the years
[16:22] we paid attention to a few we've I mean
[16:23] Lutheran changes have made headlines
[16:25] that's how we found out about it we
[16:26] don't keep track on them but you find
[16:28] out about it where they ordain women
[16:30] preachers or they accept homosexual
[16:31] clergy or whatever more you just they
[16:34] put brother says they're constantly
[16:35] putting out these articles and they do
[16:38] and brother R said it's that Protestant
[16:40] churches are bowing down to and teaching
[16:43] for Doctrine to their Creeds the same
[16:46] thing that old mother prostitute the
[16:48] Catholic Church preaches and come out
[16:51] into the Protestant church we know the
[16:54] same thing which is contrary to anywhere
[16:56] in God's word so brother starts here by
[16:59] saying denominations put out false
[17:01] beliefs just like the Roman Catholic
[17:03] Church does okay so the same
[17:06] thing and I don't know if you saw
[17:08] recently did you see Candace Owens went
[17:10] back to the Roman Catholic Church see
[17:12] that she's a big uh what's they call a
[17:15] conservative voice right very smart
[17:17] woman very
[17:19] smart uh I wish I could debate like her
[17:21] you know much a debat her but she
[17:25] recently went back to the cath Catholic
[17:27] church and she said I'm going back home
[17:30] and that's that's what brother raham
[17:31] warned about all these Protestants are
[17:33] going back to the mother right I looked
[17:35] it up Mark Wahlberg you know I don't I
[17:38] don't think I ever watched a movie his
[17:39] but he's a famous person Jimmy Fallon I
[17:41] know who he is all all these celebrities
[17:43] numerous you know famous people are
[17:45] going back to the mother
[17:47] Harlot now church that just shows they
[17:49] never really had a real grasp on
[17:51] Protestant teaching
[17:53] Hallelujah they didn't really re realize
[17:55] what a Protestant was it's protesting
[17:58] the authority of the
[18:00] Pope Martin Luther only nailed 95 thesis
[18:04] against the church door in witenberg
[18:05] there I mean he only had 95 complaints
[18:07] against the pope how many complaints I
[18:09] have against Bram Tabernacle 24 right
[18:11] now I got 24 when I get to 95 Church you
[18:13] know where I'm
[18:14] going I'm going there newly constructed
[18:17] Tabernacle I'm not going to nail it on
[18:18] there I'll just tape it on
[18:20] there we'll see by God's
[18:22] grace I'm keeping track though I'm at
[18:25] I'm at 24 by God's grace
[18:29] but brother ad says you know he says the
[18:31] Catholic Church gave birth to
[18:33] Protestants and that's in I preach it
[18:35] many times Revelation 2 uh Jesus said
[18:38] because you didn't repent I'm going to
[18:39] throw the mother and her children into
[18:41] the bed and kill them with death now
[18:43] that's speaking of the white Throne
[18:44] judgment being cast into hell so in
[18:46] other words unbelievers Sinners yet they
[18:49] went to church they were associated with
[18:51] the mother Harlot and her daughters
[18:53] thank God he's caught us out of
[18:55] denominations hallelujah thank God you
[18:57] heard The Voice come on of her my people
[19:00] amen that you be not partakers of her
[19:02] sins and her plages
[19:05] Hallelujah my it's a blessing he said
[19:08] what'd she give birth to the Protestant
[19:09] churches exactly she
[19:12] did Brother BR makes a statement in this
[19:14] sermon he said John Smith the founder of
[19:16] the Baptist Church used to stay up at
[19:18] night crying because the women and men
[19:20] started wearing wedding
[19:22] rings now he wasn't crying over a
[19:25] scriptural matter let me make that clear
[19:27] don't feel bad if you're married don't
[19:28] feel bad if if you're wearing a wedding
[19:29] ring because I can show you where Jesus
[19:31] said the prodigal got a ring on his
[19:32] finger after he got saved well Rings
[19:35] aren't sin then Joseph was given a ring
[19:37] by uh Pharaoh right as long as there's a
[19:39] purpose for it there's nothing wrong
[19:40] with it now if you're going around
[19:41] saying look at my ring look how great I
[19:43] am oh let me flash that to you well now
[19:45] you're a sinner right you know now
[19:46] you're living at least a backslid in
[19:48] state that's what the Bible says you
[19:49] know expensive gold and jewelry and
[19:51] expensive braids you know hairstyles
[19:53] whatever more he said Paul said that's
[19:55] sin that's not a modest lifestyle we
[19:57] want to be modest hallelujah amen amen
[20:00] but he said John Smith used to cry and
[20:02] he said he' cry all night and he wake up
[20:04] with swollen eyes and his wife would
[20:06] have to feed him because he was crying
[20:08] about like Holiness standards and
[20:11] brother Bram said what would John Smith
[20:13] see today if he went to baptist churches
[20:15] and saw them with shorts on and
[20:18] miniskirts and showing and painting
[20:20] their faces and bobbed hair he said he'd
[20:22] roll over in his
[20:24] grave brother says look look at the
[20:26] progression of it
[20:28] right when was the last time you and I
[20:30] lost sleep over somebody's life
[20:33] understand what I'm saying like he's a
[20:34] sincere man John Smith a Baptist
[20:38] preacher so we have to understand this
[20:40] is how this is how sincere we should be
[20:42] about our faith now I believe we have
[20:45] the right balance remember a couple
[20:46] weeks ago I preached on Romans 13- 14
[20:49] Paul said don't let anybody call your
[20:51] good evil he said but if it causes
[20:53] somebody stumble just do it between you
[20:54] and
[20:55] God right I was talking to brother
[20:57] Brooks I said afterwards you you know I
[20:58] was talking about we I somehow we
[21:00] talking about wine and I'm like uh I'm
[21:02] like do you know anybody that drinks
[21:03] wine at their house you know because
[21:04] that's a Christian Liberty somehow we
[21:06] got talking about that he's like yeah I
[21:07] know that's a Christian Liberty he said
[21:08] I don't know he said but I just condemn
[21:10] it he said because that's what I
[21:10] struggle with when I was out in the
[21:12] world he said so I preached against a
[21:14] real heart I said I like that brother
[21:16] Brooks Hallelujah I appreciate that man
[21:17] that's that's my brother you know that's
[21:19] my former
[21:21] Pastor you know I just thought wow he
[21:23] was he was so humble to say I struggle
[21:25] with that so I've got to stay so far
[21:27] away from it he said I can only drink it
[21:29] in the
[21:30] church but the then the interesting is
[21:33] see that like I've told you uh you know
[21:36] my flesh is still likes the smell of
[21:39] cigarettes I know it's hard to
[21:41] understand but that just a fleshly thing
[21:43] but see brother Brooks would realizes
[21:45] he'd be tempted if he did that in the
[21:48] home other people wouldn't I'm going to
[21:50] read you a quote later brother brandom
[21:52] had a convert named Rosella Griffith
[21:54] anybody remember her she was a total
[21:56] alcoholic she was down to what 100 pound
[21:58] maybe less she was dying from being a an
[22:02] addict on alcohol and nobody could heal
[22:05] her she couldn't get oh yeah she was
[22:07] clean for like six months but she still
[22:09] had she thirsted for alcohol liquor all
[22:11] the time she went to Brother R's
[22:12] meetings and he said instantly when
[22:14] brother R told discern her heart it
[22:16] instantly left she never desired one
[22:17] more one one more drop but then she was
[22:20] nervous she went to Brother R's church
[22:22] for communion and she said brother Ram
[22:23] should I have the wine brother Ram said
[22:25] you'll have no problems at all in the
[22:26] name of the Lord and from that day on
[22:29] she could drink alcohol every time at
[22:31] Communion and never had a Temptation
[22:33] again but see there's some people that
[22:35] will get total Victory some people have
[22:37] to keep their body and beat it under
[22:39] subjection the church said
[22:42] right so it's just really something it's
[22:44] we got to keep uh we got to keep under
[22:46] our body we have to know our battles we
[22:48] got to fight our battles Hallelujah keep
[22:50] the enemy off Hallelujah brother R said
[22:53] got to dodge all his punches right
[22:54] always got one little punch on you right
[22:56] he said but try to dodge the punches
[22:58] keep keep off as many punches as you can
[23:02] Hallelujah now uh brother Ram says how
[23:05] does the Roman Catholic Church rule in
[23:06] this sermon remember the first 36
[23:07] minutes are about Rome basically and
[23:09] Protestants he says she rules over all
[23:12] the Earth spiritually speaking so
[23:15] somehow Rome has control over the entire
[23:19] world now we know some famous people are
[23:21] Roman Catholic like a lot of the famous
[23:22] American government leaders are Roman
[23:24] Catholic right our current
[23:25] Administration uh many of the Senate
[23:27] Senators and the house Representatives a
[23:29] lot of them are Catholic and they're the
[23:31] ones funding their Ukraine Wars right I
[23:34] saw a funny meme it showed you know uh
[23:37] Israel bombing Hamas and and uh it
[23:39] showed both the both of the uh the
[23:42] Rockets firing and it said funded by
[23:44] United States funded by United
[23:46] States both both both countries fighting
[23:50] got their money from the US to fight and
[23:52] who's in charge of the US mostly Roman
[23:54] Catholics and you can do the same thing
[23:56] with with Russia and Ukraine Russian
[23:59] bomb well I guess Russian maybe wouldn't
[24:00] be from us but Ukraine would be from us
[24:04] right so it's really something uh and it
[24:06] goes back to this idea where remember Ro
[24:08] Romans 18 all the deaths of the world
[24:10] are going to be put the blame is going
[24:12] to be put on the Roman Catholic church I
[24:14] preached on that before but just a
[24:15] reminder brother baham uh states that
[24:18] plainly now I want to read a statement
[24:20] here this may be brand new to you so if
[24:22] you have questions you can ask me in two
[24:24] Sunday
[24:26] nights but maybe you'll be familiar with
[24:28] this in this sermon there's a statement
[24:30] made he makes it numerous times and then
[24:32] he fixes it later
[24:34] on so I want you to hear this just
[24:36] because it's important for you to know
[24:37] if you've never heard it you need to
[24:38] hear this so you know this uh brother
[24:41] Jose really needed help with this when
[24:43] he first came in the message because his
[24:44] church that he was raised in was a
[24:46] return Ministry Church they basically
[24:47] worshiped the tapes right and he needed
[24:50] balance on this and then he found a
[24:51] quote and a letter from brother brandham
[24:54] that fixed this statement that brother
[24:55] bram's going to make here so he says the
[24:58] Bible claims the whole thing a
[25:00] prostitute Roman Catholic church
[25:01] protestantism now what are you going to
[25:03] do that's right and how the sins of the
[25:05] people will be
[25:06] visited we went back in Deuteronomy and
[25:08] showed that an illegitimate child here
[25:11] here's the topic a bastard child a child
[25:13] born out of wedlock in other words their
[25:15] parents weren't married but they had a
[25:17] child brother Ram said could not even
[25:20] enter the congregation of the Lord for
[25:21] 14 Generations think about that
[25:24] 14 that family couldn't go go to church
[25:28] for 14 Generations that's a long
[25:31] time that's a very long
[25:34] time he said that was under the law now
[25:36] look what brother says next and Christ
[25:38] come to magnify the law how much more is
[25:41] it
[25:42] now so you've had message preachers over
[25:45] the years I don't know Naomi if anyone
[25:47] in your family heard this you know
[25:48] growing up but I've heard of message
[25:50] preachers over the years that have said
[25:51] that they won't they won't dedicate a
[25:54] baby if it's born out of
[25:56] wedlock and and they'll preach across
[25:58] the pulpit that baby can't be
[26:01] saved so they might as well leave the
[26:04] church because of this quote now brother
[26:08] random fixes it by 19 uh
[26:11] 64 yes by
[26:13] 64 and brother brother brother brother
[26:15] Jose has this letter you can find it
[26:17] online where brother Ram wrote a
[26:18] handwritten letter to somebody saying oh
[26:20] no uh you know basically I I I learned
[26:23] more about this he said all babies go to
[26:25] heaven and all babies can be saved
[26:27] whether they're Bor not a w like w like
[26:29] or not the blood of Jesus Christ covers
[26:31] over them
[26:32] all so see brother man put two verses
[26:35] together but it wasn't quite the a right
[26:38] application right but I wonder what
[26:40] brandom Tabernacle says about that I'm
[26:42] gonna get to another one about that here
[26:43] in a little bit by God's grace see
[26:45] because you can see so much truth in his
[26:46] sermons but then he's got these human
[26:48] thoughts that God corrects him six years
[26:51] later six years later right there's 18
[26:55] years worth of tape recordings and some
[26:57] of these these thoughts he has he has to
[26:59] grow and he gets progressive
[27:02] revelation right so did Abraham Glory so
[27:05] did job job thought I'm more I'm I'm a
[27:08] prophet I'm more just I'm I'm more just
[27:10] than God is well guess what God had to
[27:11] spank him a real good
[27:14] spanking and he had to have progressive
[27:16] revelation I heard about God I I
[27:19] lectured about God I preached about God
[27:20] but now I've seen God progressive
[27:24] revelation right for how many years uh I
[27:27] think it was 90 was it 90 uh 90 years
[27:30] well from 75 to 90 so uh was that 15
[27:33] about 15 years Abraham thought the sea
[27:35] was going to come through
[27:37] Hagar progressive
[27:39] revelation he knew he was going to have
[27:41] seed as the stars and the sand but he
[27:43] thought it was going to come through
[27:44] Hagar God had to give him a progressive
[27:46] revelation Hallelujah and these people
[27:48] that I better not go on there Hallelujah
[27:52] so he takes magnify the law and then
[27:54] this uh wedlock scripture and says it's
[27:57] even more
[27:58] now now by 1964 they say dear brother
[28:01] brandom I like this question dear
[28:03] brother brand if a baby's born out of
[28:05] wedlock can the child ever be saved or
[28:07] go in the
[28:09] Rapture now I'm going to skip he said
[28:11] saved why sure I believe the child the
[28:13] child can't help what's been done that's
[28:15] true now about going in the Rapture he
[28:17] says but in the Rapture it's a
[28:18] predestinated seed that goes in the
[28:20] Rapture and I can't believe that
[28:21] adultery was a predestinated seed you
[28:24] see everybody catch that
[28:29] so brother says they can be saved now
[28:31] but he says they I don't see how they
[28:32] could go in the
[28:34] Rapture now what do we believe or what
[28:36] do I believe I believe a child of
[28:37] wedlock could go in the Rapture as long
[28:39] as they get the seed of God because the
[28:42] natural seed doesn't matter
[28:44] anymore it's all about being born again
[28:46] of The Incorruptible seed the word of
[28:49] God now I need to search this out I
[28:51] don't know if there's other quotes or
[28:52] brother BR fix it or not but then he
[28:53] goes through uh you know the Old
[28:55] Testament and a congregation for 14
[28:58] Generations they were cursed he said but
[29:01] you see there's something there strong
[29:03] enough to forgive that sin the blood of
[29:04] Christ amen he said the blood of Jesus
[29:07] forgives sins it covers sins the blood
[29:09] of Christ divorces sin that's different
[29:11] now when the blood of Jesus comes it's
[29:14] different
[29:15] hallelujah hallelujah now this also goes
[29:18] in with that quote brother Ram said
[29:19] maybe maybe uh husbands and wives living
[29:22] in adultery maybe they can go in the
[29:23] Rapture brother said maybe maybe
[29:25] there'll be a chance for them to go in
[29:27] it's maybe
[29:29] right and we got to leave it up to God
[29:31] right because are you God are you God am
[29:33] I God no there's one God now we might
[29:36] have the mind of Christ but not in every
[29:38] situation Hallelujah so we want to we
[29:41] want to uh what's that song we we we
[29:43] listen that song from Micah uh walk
[29:46] humbly love mercy and and act justly was
[29:49] it act justly okay it's a beautiful
[29:51] scripture what does god require of us
[29:53] but love Mercy right love Mercy we
[29:55] should we would we we should think of
[29:57] wow that' be so lovely if God could fill
[29:59] a child born out of wedlock with the
[30:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe it I
[30:03] believe he can Hallelujah absolutely
[30:06] because why CH why what does It
[30:08] ultimately go back to my reasoning no it
[30:10] goes back to the New
[30:11] Testament Hallelujah goes back to the
[30:14] New
[30:15] Testament and we don't see anything
[30:17] brought over from that scripture in
[30:19] Deuteronomy to the Gentiles in the New
[30:22] Testament remember that's the that
[30:24] that's the rule that that's the pattern
[30:26] if some if if if Paul repeats it in the
[30:28] New Testament it's in the Old Testament
[30:29] well then it
[30:30] continues and that's why I told somebody
[30:32] on on the uh email this week we got to
[30:35] be silent where the Bible's silent and
[30:37] we got to speak where the Bible
[30:39] speaks love Mercy act justly be
[30:44] humble I know I mixed that one up there
[30:46] by God's grace if you look it up okaya
[30:48] we'll read it can you look it up it's
[30:49] mic or something but while you're
[30:51] looking that up so see I don't know
[30:53] anybody ever heard that before okay uh
[30:56] born out of wedlock brother R said at
[30:57] first there's they can't even be saved
[31:00] then he says well they can be saved but
[31:01] I don't see how they can go to the
[31:03] Rapture okay so just so you know I
[31:05] believe if they got the Holy Ghost
[31:06] they're going to the Rapture I'm talking
[31:07] about in the soul right Hallelujah okay
[31:11] then he goes in depths into the Roman
[31:13] Catholic church and denomination where
[31:14] it started there and uh starts in
[31:18] Genesis
[31:19] 3:15 and this is where 36 minutes in he
[31:21] starts preaching on the serpent
[31:25] seed he said there's got to be a
[31:27] beginning of all all the
[31:30] things now I like this I'm just going to
[31:31] throw this in there because this made me
[31:33] feel good brother Ram reads about three
[31:35] poems or he recites three poems I don't
[31:37] know I I think they're Longfellow poems
[31:40] but he says here here's the poem it says
[31:42] how do you tackle your work each day are
[31:45] you scared of the job that you find can
[31:48] you stand right up to the work ahead
[31:51] have you got a tired and empty mind so
[31:54] just a fun little rhyme find and mind
[31:56] you know he says he said or do you stand
[31:59] up right to the work ahead or is fear
[32:01] ever running through it if so tackle the
[32:04] next thing you find he said by thinking
[32:07] you're going to do it so in other words
[32:09] if if you're discouraged and not sure
[32:11] what to do brother Ram said just think
[32:13] about it and go do it right we don't
[32:15] want to sit back and be paralyzed right
[32:17] remember we looked at the parable of the
[32:18] talents the guy with the one Talent he
[32:20] was afraid so he buried his talent in
[32:22] the earth I'm just going to use this
[32:24] simple example because Haven come up for
[32:26] prayer we feel like Haven's got a gift
[32:28] to write music you know she's wrote
[32:30] numerous songs and then write poems so
[32:33] Haven I'm just going to use you okay
[32:34] said and I said honey that's a talent
[32:37] right I don't have that talent I mean I
[32:38] wish I guess I've written my wife a few
[32:40] good love poems over the years you what
[32:42] do you think honey PR good pretty
[32:45] romantic probably
[32:47] not but you know but it doesn't flow out
[32:50] like uh you know when we were going
[32:52] through a the identity theft you know
[32:54] God gave Haven this long long poem I'll
[32:56] have to read it maybe maybe Sunday or
[32:58] something it's just beautiful Rhymes and
[33:00] everything kind of like this one but I I
[33:03] expressed her you know and I just
[33:04] preached I said honey and she got a
[33:06] whole notebook almost of poems I'm like
[33:08] here's your doubling your talents this
[33:11] this notebook represents you've doubled
[33:13] your talent in other words God might
[33:15] have give her a one Talent of a poem
[33:17] well you gotta you gota you got to work
[33:18] on that Hallelujah Church got to work on
[33:22] it if I say I'm a preacher but I never
[33:24] preach how am I ever going to increase
[33:25] my preaching gift I'm not
[33:28] right so whatever God's made you invest
[33:31] in it right say God here's the little
[33:34] gift you gave me I'm going to invest in
[33:36] it by God's grace
[33:38] Hallelujah so I said that little
[33:39] notebook with all those pages you know
[33:41] maybe half full I said that is your
[33:43] effort you're not hiding from that gift
[33:45] you're putting it to work Hallelujah all
[33:47] right so is that okay H all right give
[33:49] me a thumbs up
[33:51] there so little poems like that brother
[33:53] R love poems you know he wrote a poem
[33:55] about going out west a beautiful poem
[33:57] and finally fulfilled it you know he
[33:58] said I always was drawn out to the west
[34:00] and he had uh a leading to go out
[34:04] there now um we're pretty familiar with
[34:08] uh the serpent seed like I said I've got
[34:10] I think two videos on it I got a whole
[34:12] chapter on the mystery of iniquity I
[34:14] preached that whole chapter to you uh I
[34:17] think it was in 2022 if I'm not
[34:19] mistaken um so I'm not going to spend a
[34:22] whole lot of time on that um but I do
[34:24] want to read this quote again in this is
[34:26] from a different sermon the 70th week of
[34:27] Dan Daniel so about 3 years later
[34:29] brother R said the seed of the serpent
[34:31] that's the killer many people don't
[34:34] believe that but if you just read
[34:36] Genesis the Bible said the serpent had a
[34:37] seed and I'll put enity enity between
[34:40] the woman's seed and the Serpent's Seed
[34:43] see the serpent had a seed God said so
[34:45] if it's a Serpent's Seed was spiritual
[34:47] then Jesus was not a man so the woman's
[34:49] seed was
[34:50] spiritual he said they both had seeds
[34:53] the enity is still there the serpent had
[34:55] a seed and if you'll just take your
[34:56] Bible and get down and be real Reverend
[34:58] before God I believe God will reveal it
[35:00] to you now we can see it with the hamash
[35:02] and the Jews we can see the seed of God
[35:05] and the serpy right they hate them so
[35:07] much they're chanting on the college
[35:09] campuses death to Israel death to
[35:11] America some of these radical people
[35:13] right they started last week some of
[35:15] them are still
[35:16] going that that's how you always know
[35:18] the serpent seed death they want to kill
[35:20] God's seed now that's the manifested
[35:23] form of that the mature form of
[35:25] that right
[35:28] that's like Cain and Abel it boils down
[35:30] to that like the Pharisees against Jesus
[35:32] right Judas against Jesus it boils down
[35:34] to
[35:35] that and I've always thought you know
[35:37] that's interesting why is serpent seed
[35:38] such a killer
[35:40] Doctrine you know why does it kill
[35:42] people to think adultery was the first
[35:43] sin why does that kill
[35:46] people how could apples be the first sin
[35:49] who doesn't like
[35:50] apples I love
[35:52] apples who doesn't like a good apple
[35:55] crisp Mercy so I I'm not sure my my but
[35:59] my only thought is you know sexual
[36:01] perversion should be an obvious
[36:05] evil now I believe it's a killer because
[36:08] I believe a lot of these people have
[36:09] their own sexual sin that's my thought I
[36:12] could be wrong and they want to desensi
[36:15] desensitize themselves to the guilt of
[36:17] their sexual
[36:20] sin because how can apples cause someone
[36:23] to know they're
[36:25] naked it doesn't
[36:28] right so the serpent seed is part of
[36:30] this deeper brother say this is a deep
[36:31] teaching on the mystery of iniquity now
[36:34] I'm going to read those nine proofs
[36:35] again so just to kind of refresh
[36:37] you the Bible supports the serpent Seed
[36:40] doctrine from Genesis to Revelation
[36:42] Genesis and its numerous people in the
[36:44] New Testament wrote about it Moses Jesus
[36:46] Peter Paul John that's a pretty good
[36:48] group of preachers in the church said
[36:50] you got the preacher of preachers in
[36:52] there Jesus they all preach on two seeds
[36:55] amen all right the second reason now of
[36:58] course I have whole book on this the two
[37:00] trees in the midst of the garden were
[37:01] not literal trees because the tree of
[37:03] knowledge of good evil was not good for
[37:04] food God said all the trees are good for
[37:06] food and any tree that will kill you is
[37:09] not good for food so this was a
[37:11] different kind of tree third the tree of
[37:14] life was Jesus spirit because there's
[37:16] only one way to eternal life eating food
[37:19] has never been and will be the way to
[37:21] eternal life you say well we're going to
[37:23] eat fruits in the in revelation 22 the
[37:25] 12 fruits yeah but
[37:28] that's not what's going to give us
[37:29] eternal life we've already got Eternal
[37:30] bodies Hallelujah that might somehow
[37:33] sustain the life or somehow just be a
[37:35] refreshment to the life but we've
[37:36] already got eternal life hallelujah amen
[37:40] we got eternal life right now hallelujah
[37:42] amen it ain't going to come from a fruit
[37:44] it ain't going to come from 12 fruits
[37:46] every year you've already got it eternal
[37:50] life number four the serpent seed
[37:52] explains the purpose of the Virgin birth
[37:53] that's the most powerful one to me
[37:55] always wonder why did Jesus have to be
[37:57] virgin why why why why why why does it
[37:59] make any difference this is why because
[38:00] sin came into the world through
[38:03] adultery right absolutely makes perfect
[38:06] sense remember church that's the first
[38:08] sermon that brought me in the message
[38:10] serpent SE Adam and Eve fifth Adam and
[38:13] Eve covered their loins after eating the
[38:14] forbidden fruit not their
[38:16] mouths the punishment always fits the
[38:19] crime right and when God clothed them I
[38:22] looked I emailed somebody this week the
[38:24] Bible said it was a loin cloth from the
[38:26] shoulders all the way past the KNE
[38:28] that's what God gave them God didn't
[38:29] give them many
[38:30] skirts right or bikinis God didn't give
[38:32] them bikinis like they see on the like
[38:34] on the shows even
[38:36] uh what's that Christian one we watch
[38:39] super book even super books got bikinis
[38:41] on
[38:42] mind guys did some good research but you
[38:44] sure didn't do deep enough research time
[38:47] to go back to the research
[38:48] table but it the punishment always fits
[38:51] the
[38:52] crime number six God's punishments for
[38:54] Eve sin centered on her reproduction and
[38:57] her longing for
[38:59] Adam that's what the punishments
[39:01] centered around right the consequence
[39:03] now she's going to have pain in child
[39:05] birth because she took the wrong seed at
[39:06] the beginning now she's going to have
[39:07] pain bringing the natural seed and
[39:10] second now she got long for Adam because
[39:12] she longed for the
[39:14] serpent that's what God said it's going
[39:16] to be for your husband now you got to
[39:17] long for your husband right now church
[39:20] if this don't put the nail on the thing
[39:22] I don't know what does Amen I'm still
[39:25] waiting for somebody to challenge me on
[39:26] these they don't do it he's just bring
[39:28] up well this don't make sense and this
[39:29] says this and this says that well you
[39:31] never they never address the literal
[39:32] points I'm making number seven the
[39:35] serpent was humanlike before the fall
[39:37] could talk it was standing upright those
[39:38] are the two Clues right could carry
[39:40] conversations and then God said he's got
[39:42] a seed he's got
[39:44] Offspring he must have been close to
[39:46] human enough where he had
[39:48] Offspring uh number eight Cain was the
[39:50] Serpent's son and not Adams the Bible
[39:52] never calls Cain the Father the Son
[39:55] rather of Adam he's called the son of
[39:58] the wicked one in 1 John 3:12 that's
[40:01] thus sayith the word and evidence last
[40:03] one the Sea of the woman was a literal
[40:05] man Jesus this one brother brand brings
[40:06] up and so the seed of the serpent must
[40:08] be a literal man king that's awesome
[40:11] that's awesome thought brother BR
[40:12] brought out there okay so back to this
[40:15] here back to the 1958
[40:17] sermon now I just want to lay this one
[40:18] in here brother Bram talks about men
[40:20] wanting to be women in this sermon like
[40:22] the trans movement and this was uh 66
[40:25] years ago he foresaw this
[40:28] he said when you see a man that's a
[40:29] little
[40:30] manicuring his
[40:34] fingernails he says four on one side
[40:37] five on the other colored and slicking
[40:39] his hair down to hold his mouth open in
[40:42] front and such stuff of that these
[40:43] pretty boys you remember sis there's
[40:46] something wrong with that bird he
[40:48] says you better keep an eye on
[40:51] him right look what we see
[40:55] today when you see woman with a
[40:57] cigarette in the side of her mouth and a
[40:59] pair of overalls on saying I'll tell you
[41:01] fell what it is brother you watch out
[41:03] that old gal he says there's something
[41:05] wrong with
[41:07] her he said a man is becoming more
[41:09] cissified every day women's becoming
[41:11] more masculine what's the matter we're
[41:13] going to find out in a few minutes by
[41:14] the Bible women ain't women no more I
[41:16] don't mean you Christian women
[41:17] Hallelujah he said I'm talking about the
[41:19] general
[41:20] run they want to act like men want to
[41:23] cut their hair like men put their hand
[41:26] up on a bar like that and sing God Bless
[41:28] America with a cigarette out of the
[41:29] corner of their mouth it's a disgrace he
[41:31] said and he goes back to the beginning
[41:32] he said Adam and Eve were in one Spirit
[41:34] at the beginning but God separated the
[41:36] feminine part out of Adam right he said
[41:40] so they should be totally separate
[41:41] hallelujah praise God I'm glad we got
[41:43] some Burly men in this church amen you
[41:46] think I'm
[41:47] Burly I know brother Bley
[41:49] Williams but we got some real feminine
[41:51] sisters in the church amen
[41:55] hallelujah so even 66 six years ago
[41:58] brother R was calling this out and look
[41:59] what we got today and he then course it
[42:02] goes back to cutting hair uh
[42:03] crossdressing Abomination remember it's
[42:06] a disgusting thing to to crossdress
[42:09] that's why it's sad these sisters wear
[42:10] uh pajama pants to bed that's disgusting
[42:13] in the sight of God it'd be like if I
[42:15] wore a skirt to bed it's
[42:17] disgusting and it's just the one open
[42:20] door to letting all this other sin
[42:23] in I wonder why people are leaving the
[42:26] message it ain't necessarily because of
[42:27] believe the sign or somebody else it's
[42:29] because they start with those small
[42:31] things a little leaven will leaven the
[42:34] whole
[42:34] lump let them crossdress or watch the
[42:37] wrong things or listen to the wrong
[42:39] things well you don't take care of that
[42:41] well yeah it'll open the door later to
[42:42] something like believe the sign or these
[42:44] other people that left the message but
[42:47] it starts with something small they let
[42:49] down the
[42:50] bars right and I imagine I'll get an
[42:53] email about this but God bless all the
[42:54] emailers
[42:56] Hallelujah he said but what do you see
[42:58] where the seed of the serpent what was
[43:00] the seed of the serpent he said it's
[43:01] adultery you following adultery with
[43:05] Eve okay so that's what brought about
[43:08] the serpent seed was an act of
[43:11] adultery right so brother lays it out
[43:14] plainly in
[43:15] here now here's where brother BR brings
[43:18] it down this is why brother BR brought
[43:19] up the
[43:21] illegitimate scripture in the beginning
[43:23] now this is going to be kind of hard to
[43:24] hear but just just bear with me I hope I
[43:26] don't get an email about this
[43:28] uh he said now he's talking about the
[43:30] Roman Catholic church and all the
[43:31] Protestants that are lost everybody say
[43:33] lost that's why the people that they
[43:35] email me you missed it I'm not talking
[43:37] about save people in denomination I'm
[43:39] talking about the lost the majority of
[43:41] them are lost Jesus said few there be
[43:44] that find it he said come out of her my
[43:45] people that you be not partakers the
[43:48] longer they stay in there the more
[43:49] danger there is in partaking of their
[43:52] acts their sinful acts so listen to this
[43:55] brother mam said it's got to place a big
[43:58] religious bunch of illegitimate bastard
[44:00] children he's talking about the
[44:03] spiritual right are denominational
[44:06] people uh or Catholic or whatever that
[44:09] are sinners are they born again
[44:12] no so what what happened they're
[44:15] illegitimate born they don't have a real
[44:18] birth I'm talking about by the Holy
[44:20] Ghost they're alive they got some type
[44:22] of life but they're not legitimate
[44:25] children of God they say they the
[44:27] children of God but their Works deny the
[44:29] word of God Amen that's why this sermon
[44:31] is so powerful because he's looking at
[44:33] he's looking at now look at the
[44:34] spiritual seat of people's lives and
[44:36] brother R says if you say Amen to every
[44:38] word of God that proves you're a child
[44:40] of God Amen that proves you've got the
[44:42] seat of God hallelujah ah
[44:45] amen
[44:47] hallelujah he said there's my final
[44:49] remark you want to know brother ad's
[44:50] final remarks and the serpent seed
[44:52] that's his final
[44:53] remarks he shows the spiritual churches
[44:56] that are the serpent seed churches are
[44:58] illegitimate children to God they're not
[45:01] God's
[45:02] children because you don't become God's
[45:04] children by joining a church you become
[45:06] God's children by getting the holy
[45:09] ghost or potentially if you're a foolish
[45:12] virgin potentially you will get you'll
[45:13] get you'll get a brand new body you'll
[45:14] get a Holy Ghost spirit body right
[45:16] you'll get a theophany eventually but
[45:18] that's all you inherit you don't have
[45:19] any
[45:20] reward he said that's exactly what it
[45:22] come to you know that to be the truth
[45:24] it's come to a place where it's Church
[45:26] joined and church members having a form
[45:28] of godliness but denying the power
[45:30] thereof till it's come to a bunch of
[45:32] religious bastard children that's
[45:34] exactly what it is so this ain't no this
[45:36] is pulling no
[45:39] punches what's next brother Bram says
[45:42] the atomic bombs right so he's talking
[45:43] about the bombing of the United States
[45:45] the seventh major Vision probably
[45:47] happens well no doubt it happens in the
[45:48] Great Tribulation period no doubt we
[45:50] don't know where you know there's a
[45:51] couple uh there's a couple scriptures
[45:53] you know I asked that to cam and Simon
[45:55] we had that last Minister's meeting back
[45:56] there in April I said Brothers I've
[45:57] always wondered where is that and they
[45:59] took me to uh Hebrews 12 let's go there
[46:01] because I kind of be something new here
[46:04] I said well that might be it Brothers I
[46:06] really like that
[46:08] idea um Hebrews
[46:11] 12 it's at the end of the chapter I'm
[46:13] got to look for the
[46:17] verse okay
[46:20] 26 whose voice then shook the Earth but
[46:23] now he hath promised saying yet once
[46:25] more I shake not the Earth only only but
[46:27] also
[46:28] heaven and this word yet once more
[46:31] signify the removing of those things
[46:32] that are shaken now think about the Los
[46:35] Angeles earthquake right a shaking as of
[46:37] things that are made that those things
[46:39] which cannot be shaken May remain
[46:41] Hallelujah wherefor Church we've
[46:43] received a kingdom which what cannot be
[46:46] moved Hallelujah no matter what happens
[46:49] to this earth no matter what happens
[46:50] with atomic fire our kingdom cannot be
[46:52] moved because our kingdom isn't the
[46:53] United States our kingdom is the kingdom
[46:56] of God amen
[46:59] glory let us have what Grace whereby we
[47:02] may serve God acceptably with reverence
[47:05] and godly fear talk I mean if you were
[47:07] going to summarize how to live a
[47:09] Christian Life what would you say the
[47:10] Hebrew writer Paul says serve god with
[47:13] reverence and godly
[47:15] fear right there's lots of ways to
[47:17] summarize it right um the two greatest
[47:20] commands love the Lord your God love
[47:21] your neighbor as yourself right
[47:23] there's what's the conclusion of the
[47:25] whole matter Ecclesiastes 12 fear God
[47:27] keep his commands right there's
[47:28] different ways to summarize the word of
[47:31] God and how how should I live my life
[47:34] how should I live as a Christian how
[47:35] about serve god with reverence and godly
[47:37] fear because God is going to shake
[47:39] everything on this Earth it's all going
[47:41] to be shaken but our kingdom can never
[47:43] be shaken Hallelujah it can never be
[47:45] moved amen because it's God's Eternal
[47:48] Kingdom
[47:51] Hallelujah so that's the scripture Cam
[47:53] and Simon thought I thought well hey
[47:54] that's pretty good scripture I don't
[47:55] have any other scripture you know I've
[47:57] always you know we got how many believe
[47:58] we got to take everything back to the
[47:59] word of God if brother had seven major
[48:01] Visions well surely we can find them in
[48:03] the Bible That's what I'm
[48:05] saying right we can see you know uh we
[48:07] can see the persecution of the Jews with
[48:09] Hitler melini we can see that in the
[48:10] fifth seal there it
[48:12] is
[48:14] hallelujah like I told you uh that
[48:16] Vision brother Bram saw of the American
[48:17] Church dancing rock and roll that was in
[48:19] the scripture that's happened in Moses
[48:21] day remember I made that video on that
[48:23] cam Cam said that's real spiritual
[48:25] brother I said well that was the Holy
[48:26] Ghost that wasn't me anything that good
[48:28] comes out of my life it wasn't me God
[48:30] just showed me that just by just waiting
[48:32] on the Lord just
[48:33] studying brother said what's left he
[48:36] said atomic bomb everything
[48:38] else he says and Friends whatever you do
[48:40] if you're a Christian and you've got God
[48:42] in your heart how many got God in their
[48:43] heart
[48:44] today and you know that you pass from
[48:46] death and life how many pass from death
[48:47] and life you ought to be the happiest
[48:50] person in all the world he
[48:52] says amen hallelujah you mean I love
[48:55] Jesus and he loves me
[48:58] Hallelujah you got to be the happiest
[49:00] person cuz you're not a illegitimate
[49:02] child you're a genuine child of God
[49:05] you're born of God hallelujah your life
[49:08] speaks that I'm a
[49:10] Christian when the Holy Spirit in you
[49:12] and the Bible says Jesus Christ is same
[49:15] yesterday today and forever denomination
[49:16] say h but we believe the Miracles have
[49:18] passed the holy spirit says amen Jesus
[49:21] is the same yesterday today and forever
[49:23] so be
[49:24] it Hallelujah praise the Lord if the
[49:27] Bible said repent be baptized every one
[49:29] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[49:30] the remission of sins and you shall
[49:32] receive the Holy Ghost the promises for
[49:33] you and your children to the Gentiles
[49:35] all that's a far off even as many as our
[49:36] Lord Our God shall
[49:38] call he says and when that strikes you
[49:41] you say what what do you say yes you do
[49:44] good church you knew you knew you knew
[49:45] that quote didn't you the church said oh
[49:48] it don't make any difference how you're
[49:49] baptized that was so good Simon brought
[49:50] that out that prostitute speaks so
[49:52] smoothly oh God knows my heart oh I'm
[49:56] saved by grace it don't matter what I'm
[49:58] doing oh it's so smooth but it's such a
[50:00] lie if they know better I'm talking
[50:03] about if they know better if they don't
[50:04] know better that's something
[50:06] different Church all you got to do is
[50:07] look at their lives are they living a
[50:09] verion life to the word or
[50:11] not are they mixed up in idolatry that
[50:14] fornication right spiritual fornication
[50:16] are they fornicating are they loving the
[50:17] things of the world or not that's all
[50:18] you got to see then you know what their
[50:21] confession is then you know where where
[50:23] they where the at least the way the
[50:24] trees leaning brother where the trees
[50:26] leaning usually Falls right unless
[50:27] there's some type of a uh deathbed
[50:29] confession which we know the thief on
[50:31] the cross right and we just talked about
[50:32] one hopefully that happened last week by
[50:34] God's
[50:36] grace the church says oh it don't make
[50:38] any difference but the holy spirit in
[50:39] you says Amen to the word of God he said
[50:43] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[50:45] every word that proceeds out of the
[50:46] mouth of God how am I doing my
[50:48] time there you
[50:49] are he said I want you to show me one
[50:52] scripture I love this show me one
[50:53] scripture where it ever said an Apple
[50:56] started the the thing to going on
[50:58] now where does the bible saying
[51:01] Apple started the original sin doesn't
[51:04] say that it does say the bride the
[51:06] shulamite is the was the apple of
[51:08] Solomon's eye though it does say that
[51:10] you want to find an Apple I'll show you
[51:11] an apple hallelujah it's that pure bride
[51:15] she's the apple of the husband's eye
[51:17] that's the Apple in the Bible right
[51:19] there
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:21] amen he said I want you to show me where
[51:24] Adam and Eve ate apples I'll show you
[51:26] where Cain brought the same thing where
[51:28] his seed still thinks the same
[51:31] thing he says but the spiritual
[51:33] Revelation from God proves that it was a
[51:36] intercourse between man and woman
[51:38] illegally that's where your Giants come
[51:40] from that's another powerful
[51:42] statement that natural seed line of the
[51:45] serpent mixed with the human seed the
[51:47] genetic all the genetic uh possibilities
[51:50] in there eventually produce
[51:52] Giants right we showed it to you even up
[51:56] to the days of
[51:57] David right uh yeah I think those were
[51:59] the last recorded ones in the scripture
[52:01] in David's day still had Giants that was
[52:05] what a thousand years before Christ so
[52:07] the first uh 4,000 years the first 4,000
[52:09] years of human history there was Giants
[52:12] because of this seed line brought
[52:15] in
[52:17] I now he says where does that seed of
[52:19] serpent stand today in these smart
[52:22] intellectual places the smart shrewd
[52:25] Scholars
[52:28] that's where he is that's where he lays
[52:31] did you know when I I don't know if I
[52:33] told the story before when I first came
[52:34] in the message I was battling some uh uh
[52:38] Seminary preachers and I said uh God's
[52:41] one person they said God's three persons
[52:43] I said okay well show me your scriptures
[52:45] on that you know what he did I bought
[52:48] the book he took me to a seminary
[52:50] textbook and he copied the chapter about
[52:53] the Trinity and then he gave me that
[52:55] copy
[52:57] you know what the last statement is in
[52:58] that
[52:59] chapter let's see if I can remember
[53:02] verb try to understand the three persons
[53:06] you'll lose your mind deny the three
[53:09] persons you'll lose your
[53:11] soul anybody catch you what's he trying
[53:15] to do he's trying to put a spirit of
[53:16] fear on me don't go against the grain
[53:19] you know believe the sign just call me a
[53:20] well not just but believe the sign
[53:22] called me a heretic because I don't
[53:23] believe in the Trinity excuse me Jesus
[53:26] never called God three
[53:28] persons huh Paul never said God three
[53:32] persons and where does Satan lay at he
[53:35] lays in those seminaries with these
[53:37] smart shrewd people oh it's okay if we
[53:41] add to the word of God the doctors of
[53:42] dein said so here take take my chapter
[53:45] God's three persons if you don't believe
[53:46] it you're going to
[53:48] hell my my good
[53:50] friend and yet we say they can be saved
[53:52] but if we deny their Trinity we're
[53:54] lost amen who's did you find that Mercy
[53:58] verse by chance okay P it up there I
[53:59] just came to me right
[54:01] now we see we love Mercy we don't want
[54:03] to see these people lost we want to see
[54:05] them saved Hallelujah we want to see
[54:07] them confess their man-made dogmas and
[54:10] Tre and Creeds Hallelujah Jesus said you
[54:13] transgress the word of God by your
[54:17] tradition and the Bible said Jesus said
[54:19] you do it in vain think about that
[54:21] church most Services they go to church
[54:24] and God doesn't accept anything
[54:27] nothing how many believe God accepted
[54:29] your dancing here on Saturday night I
[54:31] believe God accepted mine how do I know
[54:33] because I'm trying to live by every word
[54:35] of God I try to bring the right
[54:37] sacrifice I brought and and what's My
[54:40] Sacrifice is it my good deeds sisters no
[54:43] it's the sacrifice of Jesus Christ amen
[54:46] alls I brought sister Caris was Faith In
[54:48] My Sacrifice that's all I got I have
[54:51] nothing else than that sister Victoria
[54:54] that's all I got all I got is my genuine
[54:57] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ I'm
[54:58] trusting in Him and not myself and
[55:01] therefore if he's the word if my
[55:03] sacrifice is the word I'm only going to
[55:05] believe the word I'm not going to add to
[55:07] the word and then that that way God
[55:09] accepts My Sacrifice hallelujah amen and
[55:12] it's not in
[55:14] vain he has showed thee oh man what is
[55:16] good and what does the Lord require of
[55:19] our church what's he require of you

[56:49] of it lays in him your salvation the
[56:51] Rapture it all Lays in him now this is
[56:54] all from the serpent seed sermon now

[57:48] not going to go up and say I've done one
[57:50] thing it's the grace of God that done it
[57:51] all see nothing I done for salvation I
[57:54] never had a thing to do you never need
[57:56] either you never merited one thing for
[57:58] salvation God did every bit of it you
[58:00] never turn your finger for one part of
[58:01] it you didn't say well I come out I I
[58:04] come out of a good family I did this
[58:06] that don't have one thing to do with it
[58:08] God is the one who did it God's
[58:11] mercy Hallelujah let me see how many
[58:14] quotes I got left here a
[58:18] lot why can't I just preach one sermon
[58:20] on
[58:23] this okay I'll go kind of quick here
[58:26] and I can just pick up with the perfect
[58:28] Faith next week brother B tells us in
[58:30] this sermon he saidthe serpent seed came
[58:32] through the Ark of Noah and he
[58:33] especially points out ham remember ham
[58:35] Shem and japheth brother raham said look
[58:38] at Ham's life he was cursed he was
[58:40] probably uh the seed of the serpent but
[58:44] then remember he says they all
[58:46] intermarried so ham must have been maybe
[58:48] the last one that had this natural thing
[58:50] but shortly after that it switched over
[58:53] to it's all spiritual now it does
[58:56] doesn't matter which family you're born
[58:57] in the the natural seed line doesn't
[59:00] matter it's you must be born of the
[59:02] spiritual seed put up 1 Timothy 1 I'm
[59:05] sorry 1 Peter 123 and I'm going to keep
[59:07] reading he said the SE the seed came
[59:09] over in the ark just like it did in the
[59:10] beginning through the woman their wives
[59:12] they carry the seed of Satan through the
[59:14] ark just as e packed the seed of Satan
[59:16] to giving birth to Cain through the
[59:20] woman so brother ad says here now
[59:24] there's ham and Seth or he he means uh
[59:27] he doesn't mean Seth oh there's another
[59:28] one I could show with another human
[59:30] mistake I could show that to Brown
[59:31] Tabernacle there's ham and uh japheth
[59:34] and Shem in the same Ark so look there's
[59:37] there's a seed of God and serpent seed
[59:38] in the
[59:39] ark brother said there was a crow and a
[59:42] dove in the same Ark then brother R says
[59:45] there's Jesus and Judas es scar in the
[59:47] same
[59:48] church thank God we got uh real
[59:50] Believers here by God's grace
[59:53] amen so he says how they're so close
[59:55] together yes being born again not of the
[59:57] not of the corruptible seed so your your
[59:59] seed human seed doesn't matter he said
[1:00:02] what matters is The Incorruptible seed
[1:00:04] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:00:07] forever amen aren't you glad You' got a
[1:00:10] spiritual genetics that will live
[1:00:12] forever as brother Brooks reminded us
[1:00:15] you were in the mind of God before the
[1:00:17] foundation of the world that's your
[1:00:18] spiritual Gene that Gene can never end
[1:00:21] that Gene can never die you're going to
[1:00:23] live eternally praise God cuz you got a
[1:00:26] part of God's Offspring You're a part of
[1:00:28] God's Offspring You're a part of God's
[1:00:30] family
[1:00:31] Hallelujah I hope somebody leaves here
[1:00:33] happy tonight by God's grace brother
[1:00:35] said God took the Serpent's legs off
[1:00:37] when he cursed him that's just familiar
[1:00:39] just thought I'd bring that one out I
[1:00:40] like that
[1:00:41] quote brother man said let's draw a
[1:00:43] picture of this great big fella he
[1:00:44] called The Serpent of great big fella
[1:00:46] he's between a chimpanzee and a
[1:00:49] man and the serpent the devil Lucifer
[1:00:51] they knew that the only blood that could
[1:00:53] mix with the human blood would have been
[1:00:54] this serpent couldn't couldn't have been
[1:00:57] a chimpanzee the blood wouldn't
[1:00:59] mix couldn't have couldn't have been the
[1:01:01] Sheep couldn't have been a horse
[1:01:03] couldn't deal with any other animal had
[1:01:05] to be this serpent this Beast the Bible
[1:01:06] calls him a
[1:01:08] beast he said he was a great big fellow
[1:01:11] prehistoric giant he says now of course
[1:01:12] not prehistoric well maybe prehistoric
[1:01:15] to humans keeping track of
[1:01:17] History
[1:01:20] um he's a big fell he said maybe he was
[1:01:22] 10 feet tall that's about how tall uh
[1:01:24] Goliath was
[1:01:26] great big shoulders look just like a
[1:01:29] man and so he uh he says you see how
[1:01:32] many knows that science can't find the
[1:01:33] missing link he says there he is he's
[1:01:36] the serpent he's this great big
[1:01:39] fellow okay so brother lays that in
[1:01:41] there describing the
[1:01:42] serpent now getting I'm just going to
[1:01:44] finish with a few few more highlight
[1:01:46] quotes brother Ram said quote brother if
[1:01:48] there's one thing that I have to do to
[1:01:50] be saved Jesus Christ died in
[1:01:53] vain Grace I am saved not by myself but
[1:01:57] by the will of God by the goodness of
[1:01:59] God end
[1:02:00] quote Hallelujah prise God if I have to
[1:02:03] do one thing to be saved then Jesus died
[1:02:05] in vain then he needs me Hallelujah he
[1:02:08] don't need me I need him
[1:02:11] Hallelujah so I love how brother lays in
[1:02:13] these good reminders I see these people
[1:02:14] that say brother BR preach Works based
[1:02:16] salvation they just don't listen to the
[1:02:17] tapes I'm not going to go off on them
[1:02:19] today now brother tells a story he now
[1:02:22] he ends a sermon also by showing how
[1:02:25] Satan uses wh like in the days of Noah
[1:02:27] of course these days as it was in days
[1:02:29] of lot days of
[1:02:31] Sodom brother Bram said there was a
[1:02:33] sister Edith right remember she's the
[1:02:34] one that spoke uh her children's
[1:02:36] salvation the holy spirit said say
[1:02:38] whatever you want and it'll be yours
[1:02:39] remember that that was uh operation of
[1:02:42] the third pole brother manam says sister
[1:02:45] right back there she
[1:02:47] remembers there's a woman that came he
[1:02:49] says they used to wear cut their dresses
[1:02:51] down like this I don't know which way I
[1:02:53] don't know if he's going like this or if
[1:02:54] he's like they cut their dresses down
[1:02:56] like this I don't know he said they just
[1:02:58] cut their dresses down like that that
[1:03:00] funny looking stuff about half of their
[1:03:02] body
[1:03:05] exposed and he said remember Sister
[1:03:08] Wright remember I said if they ever come
[1:03:09] in my church I'll sure put them out he
[1:03:11] said sure enough a little old snickle
[1:03:13] Fritz come down
[1:03:15] here he said a Catholic girl sat down
[1:03:19] with it like that I looked back and I
[1:03:21] spied her sitting up here they was
[1:03:23] singing I took off my coat now look
[1:03:26] picture brother Bram on the pulpit he
[1:03:28] sees a girl there I don't know if it's
[1:03:29] like this or the other side but he says
[1:03:32] she has all her shoulders exposed now
[1:03:35] what would I do if that happened to me
[1:03:38] that's what I when I read these quotes
[1:03:39] that's what I think what would I
[1:03:43] do thank God it hasn't happened to me he
[1:03:46] said he said they were all sitting they
[1:03:47] were all singing so during the song
[1:03:49] service brother leaves the pulpit I took
[1:03:51] off my coat walked back there I put it
[1:03:53] around her shoulders I said Madam if
[1:03:55] you're going to listen to me preach
[1:03:56] would you please wear this coat while
[1:03:58] you're in the Church of
[1:04:00] God and cover your shoulders put it
[1:04:03] around your shoulders sure enough she
[1:04:04] stomped out of there and spread them
[1:04:06] little lips she went out of the building
[1:04:08] she said now think about this right
[1:04:09] during the song service if he is got
[1:04:12] religion I wouldn't let my cow have that
[1:04:14] kind of religion and brother B said
[1:04:16] don't worry she won't have it brother
[1:04:19] Bram said she died a few years after
[1:04:21] that and he was she was calling for
[1:04:23] brother Ram to come pray for her
[1:04:26] and he said she was trying to repent at
[1:04:28] the end of her life brother R doesn't
[1:04:29] know if she got saved or not but brother
[1:04:30] R couldn't get there to pray for her
[1:04:32] think about
[1:04:33] that so talk about having Church manners
[1:04:38] Hallelujah I just thought it was
[1:04:40] something this is the story this is the
[1:04:41] message he tells that
[1:04:44] in and then he goes through these
[1:04:46] serpent seed
[1:04:47] preachers uh and he he lists a bunch of
[1:04:51] things
[1:04:52] here he said if that man tells you
[1:04:55] pouring for your baptism is right he
[1:04:57] said he's told you a lie if he tells you
[1:04:59] sprinklings is is all right he's told
[1:05:01] you a
[1:05:02] lie he said if he tells you the name of
[1:05:04] the father and the Holy Ghost is all
[1:05:06] right he's told you a lie if he tells
[1:05:08] you the day of Miracles is passed he's
[1:05:09] told you a lie if he tells you it's all
[1:05:12] right for women to preach he's told you
[1:05:13] a lot and I know you've heard this
[1:05:14] before stay with me he said if it if he
[1:05:17] if he tells you it's all right for you
[1:05:18] to go ahead and stick to your
[1:05:20] denominations he's told you a lie it
[1:05:22] won't flash on the urum Thum of God's
[1:05:24] word
[1:05:27] he said there's dozens of things that
[1:05:28] come out in that old mother Harlot that
[1:05:30] come down here to the Protestants and
[1:05:32] there's where we stay away from those
[1:05:34] denominations he says we love our
[1:05:36] Brethren and sisters out there in
[1:05:38] denominations but you don't go and
[1:05:40] saying I'm a Methodist and make you a
[1:05:41] Christian you're a Christian because
[1:05:43] you're born of the spirit of
[1:05:45] God he said you don't have to be a
[1:05:47] Methodist or Baptist and I say this you
[1:05:49] don't have to be a message believer
[1:05:50] you've got to be born by the spirit of
[1:05:52] God
[1:05:53] hallelujah right because a message can
[1:05:55] mean anything anything can return
[1:05:57] Ministry push play and Obey it can mean
[1:05:59] anything so that's why it's got to be if
[1:06:01] I'm a Christian I'm born of the Holy
[1:06:03] Ghost Hallelujah and any man that tells
[1:06:06] you you got to play tapes and not preach
[1:06:08] that man's told you a lie let me bring
[1:06:10] it down to home Hallelujah they told you
[1:06:13] a lie because you don't find that in the
[1:06:14] Bible now I'm almost
[1:06:17] done I got 19 seconds on my
[1:06:20] hour now look what brother says in
[1:06:22] paragraph 306 quote and you Tabernacle
[1:06:26] here I told you we're going to change
[1:06:28] the name of this it's not right for it
[1:06:31] to be brandom
[1:06:33] Tabernacle that's just a man see we're
[1:06:36] going to change the name of it make it
[1:06:39] some other name we'll get to that after
[1:06:41] a while I just wanted to be a Church of
[1:06:43] the Living God end
[1:06:47] quote so if I could email that brother
[1:06:51] again I'd say brother your Prophet said
[1:06:54] it's not right for it to be called
[1:06:56] brandom Tabernacle and we're going to do
[1:06:59] it if every word is th thus say the Lord
[1:07:01] why isn't it done
[1:07:04] yet wonder what they'd
[1:07:06] say I I love quotes like this I call
[1:07:09] these little nuggets hiding in there
[1:07:11] aren't they little golden nuggets in
[1:07:12] there it's not
[1:07:14] right but see brother Ram wanted to
[1:07:16] change it but who wouldn't change it the
[1:07:19] trustees trustees the people that owned
[1:07:22] it right the who are the leaders of our
[1:07:24] church Bang myself brother amen we're
[1:07:26] the
[1:07:27] trustees that's how you change it he
[1:07:29] said it should just be the Church of the
[1:07:30] Living God no they want to keep a man's
[1:07:33] name on it that's why they're in
[1:07:34] man-made Creeds right now amen just
[1:07:36] struck me right there that's why it's a
[1:07:38] man-made
[1:07:39] Creeds he says it again uh next
[1:07:46] week he said now one week later he said
[1:07:49] I wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle what
[1:07:51] do you think of that uh brandom
[1:07:53] Tabernacle today I wish it was just

[1:09:24] inspiration to preach these so we can
[1:09:25] sing that song and yes we're going to
[1:09:27] sing uh just want to thank you Lord for
[1:09:29] letting me hear your word so the sermon
[1:09:31] ends with brother Ram saying we have a
[1:09:33] baptismal service tonight and guess who
[1:09:35] it was Rosella Griffin's
[1:09:39] mother Rosella Griffin was one of
[1:09:41] brother Ram's most uh well-known
[1:09:43] converts because Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:09:46] gave her up she couldn't you know she
[1:09:49] she stayed free from uh liquor for like
[1:09:52] six months but she was she was still had
[1:09:53] the shakes and we read the testimony in
[1:09:55] our book we got a book on it the
[1:09:58] generations she said she met somebody on
[1:10:01] a bus and they said have you been to see
[1:10:03] brother brandom she's like
[1:10:05] no uh he's like she's a he's a prophet
[1:10:08] of God you need to go see him and she
[1:10:10] said she prayed and she said I she knew
[1:10:12] just like the woman with the blood issue
[1:10:14] she said if I can get brother brother
[1:10:15] R's prayer line I'll be healed and
[1:10:17] that's exactly what happened and the
[1:10:19] awesome thing was the next night she
[1:10:22] went and told a friend who had the same
[1:10:24] alcoholic problem she said if you come
[1:10:25] and he brother Braham you'll get healed
[1:10:27] too the same thing happened she got in
[1:10:29] the prayer line and then it happened a
[1:10:31] third night third time three nights in a
[1:10:33] row amen hallelujah amen and here's a
[1:10:36] woman she was 100 pounds she was
[1:10:38] hopeless there's no way I can ever get
[1:10:39] this desire for alcohol amen but one
[1:10:42] minute in the presence of God one minute
[1:10:44] in the presence of Jesus Christ the
[1:10:45] angel of God the Holy Ghost he whom the
[1:10:48] son has set free is free indeed
[1:10:49] hallelujah amen and Saints she spent the
[1:10:53] rest of her life going to people to is
[1:10:55] testifying and she said I won many souls
[1:10:57] to the Lord a woman giving her testimony
[1:11:00] in other words churches would just say
[1:11:01] hey we're going to have a testimony
[1:11:02] tonight we're going to let sister
[1:11:03] Rosella stand over here not the pulpit
[1:11:06] because sisters don't want a complex
[1:11:07] right neither do preachers want a
[1:11:10] complex but we're just going to listen
[1:11:11] to our sister give her testimony now she
[1:11:14] give her testimony I overcame tobacco
[1:11:16] I'm sorry overcome that's what I
[1:11:17] overcame I overcame alcohol now who
[1:11:19] wants to give their heart to the Lord
[1:11:20] hundreds of people got saved through a
[1:11:23] woman's testimony
[1:11:25] so Saints don't don't ever think your
[1:11:27] testimony doesn't mean something it
[1:11:28] means something I told Brother bang
[1:11:30] maybe on May 12th when I get back here
[1:11:32] on that PM service we'll record his
[1:11:34] testimony for the next podcast because
[1:11:36] you never know who it's going to help by
[1:11:37] God's grace sister Z might have to do
[1:11:40] yours too by God's grace I just thought
[1:11:41] about
[1:11:42] that I gotta do Jose too and who else I
[1:11:45] gotta maybe some of these young Saints
[1:11:48] by God's
[1:11:49] grace last quote Rosella is that your
[1:11:52] mother Rosella says yes why bless your
[1:11:54] heart glad to see you sister doing doing
[1:11:55] that that's very fine Rosella Griffin
[1:11:57] one of the finest little friends that
[1:11:59] we've ever had she's a young woman that
[1:12:01] was an alcoholic to some of you people
[1:12:02] here might be a stranger Rosella don't
[1:12:04] care for me saying that when she come on
[1:12:06] the platform up there in Indiana you
[1:12:09] never seen a wret she was one of them a
[1:12:11] waly alcoholic I don't know what walyed
[1:12:13] means but maybe just
[1:12:16] crazy four great doctors in Chicago the
[1:12:18] Alcoholics Anonymous and everything else
[1:12:20] give her up but one night she came in
[1:12:22] the meeting the Holy Ghost unraveled her
[1:12:24] life and told her right there that
[1:12:26] settled it look at her now I guess 30
[1:12:29] something years old would pass for 18
[1:12:31] that's quite a compliment I got to learn
[1:12:33] to do that for the sisters from now on
[1:12:35] oh you're 40 you like you look like
[1:12:37] you're
[1:12:39] 15 oh you're 60 you're look like you
[1:12:42] just passed
[1:12:43] 30 that's good Pulpit manners right
[1:12:47] there you'd pass for 18 lovely beautiful
[1:12:49] young woman never tasted whiskey since
[1:12:52] no more desire for it living for Christ
[1:12:54] going around the street everywhere
[1:12:56] testifying to the glory of God to
[1:12:57] Sinners and alcoholics all through skid
[1:12:59] RADS and everything else she even went
[1:13:00] to prisons church talk about a woman
[1:13:02] talk about a saint she would go into
[1:13:05] prisons give her testimony and people
[1:13:06] get saved in the prison women
[1:13:11] now she was baptized in the name of the
[1:13:13] Lord Jesus and her mother comes tonight
[1:13:15] to do likewise if a God could heal her
[1:13:17] if Jesus could heal her whatsoever you
[1:13:19] do in word or deed do it all in the name
[1:13:21] of Jesus Christ that's what the Bible
[1:13:23] taught that's right and the church said
[1:13:26] let's thank God for the word of God
[1:13:27] tonight hallelujah
[1:13:29] amen recognizing your day and serpent
[1:13:32] seed
