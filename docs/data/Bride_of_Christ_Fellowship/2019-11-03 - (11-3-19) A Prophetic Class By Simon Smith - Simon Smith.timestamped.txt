[0:24] I feel a little bit different than
[0:29] ministers I'm kind of a teacher maybe
[0:34] slower pace for a man no there's I'll
[0:44] tell you what if yours is not in power
[0:46] and steel bar story testimony my
[0:50] goodness
[0:51] praise Lord I'll never forget that
[0:52] brother in fact I had a situation not
[0:55] quite like that but I used that same
[0:57] testimony and used my applied my faith
[1:00] to it and overcame the saying not like
[1:02] that but my mind will write to that
[1:05] testimony and I walked right through it
[1:07] so immense that made an impact whether
[1:10] that's a tremendous testimony but just
[1:13] to if you've heard of high before and if
[1:15] you ever not heard I made the effort
[1:16] service contact our brother here listen
[1:19] to what God did is God is still gone he
[1:25] does what he he won't see and he's
[1:28] always he needs doesn't matter what this
[1:30] doesn't matter what the situation looks
[1:31] like it's not real right and God can do
[1:37] all things so anyhow I wouldn't want to
[1:41] hold you too long here let me get set up
[1:43] here by God's grace I just want to teach
[1:45] on a little dog
[1:47] I hope everybody's bless this weekend I
[1:55] know when we got back from Thailand
[2:00] there and brother Jesse said rather we
[2:02] have any services like I was thinking
[2:06] you want me okay like I couldn't even
[2:10] sleep through the night
[2:12] [Laughter]
[2:13] but God ordained it that way and your
[2:17] play pray you were blessed on Friday
[2:18] night and it's not easy to all run your
[2:22] pastor then we passed the service after
[2:25] you passed it so keeps you humble and
[2:29] shown your toes and crying out for the
[2:31] Spirit of God to speak so praise the
[2:35] Lord bless up let's turn to John 15 by
[2:41] God's grace Friday night I taught on the
[2:57] only the only ammo had not shot out over
[3:00] here he prays a blessed I hope he saw
[3:03] the culmination of studies that God has
[3:06] given me through the last four or five
[3:07] years and how God has supernaturally
[3:11] placed in the word it's a I'm still kind
[3:14] of an all but I know we're coming to
[3:16] something very important we're coming to
[3:19] the Lord the coming of the Lord is
[3:20] sealed and he reveals things he I mean
[3:24] if you think back to maybe when you know
[3:30] the Prophet may have been think God was
[3:32] dealing with the Prophet on
[3:34] serpent seed and maybe the God would
[3:37] show the one scripture year and
[3:39] then one scripture year at a time then
[3:42] he would seek the Lord and I add it all
[3:43] now we have the entire study of serpent
[3:45] see the entire study of Godhead oh thank
[3:54] you hey men so now we have the entire
[3:57] study of all these topics and you can
[3:59] run on the doctrines run perfectly
[4:02] there's nothing quite like the Bible
[4:04] there's nothing by no one quite like the
[4:07] Lord Jesus Christ he's a faithful dog a
[4:10] friend in the time of need he's never
[4:14] failed us not a one time so let's read
[4:17] this here we have two fours from the
[4:19] Scriptures by God's grace in John 15:12
[4:24] says
[4:25] this is my commandment that you love one
[4:27] another as I have loved you greater love
[4:29] hath no man than this that a man lay
[4:32] down his life for his friends ye are my
[4:35] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[4:37] you
[4:40] henceforth I call you not servants for
[4:43] the servant knoweth not what his Lord do
[4:45] is mine I think about the services this
[4:50] weekend but I have called you friends
[4:52] for all things that I have heard of my
[4:54] father I've made known unto you he was
[4:59] breaking forth he was revealing what he
[5:02] is about to do he's revealing the end
[5:05] time he's revealing exactly what he's
[5:10] planning here always on his mind the
[5:13] next step the next thing to strike the
[5:16] earth to strike his bride and why does
[5:20] he does this 4:16 you have not chosen me
[5:24] but I have chosen you and or done
[5:28] ordained you that you should go and
[5:31] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[5:33] should remain what is he looking forward
[5:35] to harvest the precious fruits he said
[5:38] that so whatsoever you shall ask of the
[5:40] Father in my name he may give it you
[5:43] these things I command you that you love
[5:46] one another our next portion of
[5:48] Scripture is in John 2 verse 23 this uh
[5:58] this is a this will make you shudder a
[6:02] little bit maybe on the inside you know
[6:04] the Bible says to make your calling
[6:05] election Shore search out your own
[6:10] salvation with fear and trembling here
[6:14] in John 23 223 now when he was in
[6:19] Jerusalem to Passover the feast day he
[6:21] believed many believed in his name when
[6:24] they saw the miracles which he did but
[6:26] Jesus did not commit himself unto them
[6:28] because he knew all men and needed not
[6:33] to any should testify of man for he knew
[6:37] what was in
[6:38] man all our heads during the Father Lord
[6:47] Jesus we approach your throne of grace
[6:50] Lord humble in order pie in the token
[6:52] Lord we want to be seen through the
[6:54] blood of Jesus Christ once again this
[6:56] morning lord rahl we pray over you just

[7:01] little study gone and Lord Jesus but we
[7:04] pray you anoint their hearts God Lord

[7:07] little mess up your Lord and when you

[7:13] in the name of Jesus Christ or and I
[7:15] will amen
[7:17] you may be seated
[7:20] I want to kind of you know I've been
[7:25] this the Lord brought this message to me
[7:28] you reveal the to me back at the end of
[7:31] 2001 readjusted exact same time his wife
[7:36] as well
[7:37] exact same time and we sat through a lot
[7:42] of services seen a lot of things and I
[7:45] kind of want to and I seen the way it
[7:47] seems like the time has and things I
[7:52] went as far as we say in this message we
[7:54] say as far as where the emphasis is
[7:57] placed okay but we want to take it a
[8:01] turn maybe and we have I believe we all
[8:04] have been those that are led of the Holy
[8:06] Ghost that are for the Holy Ghost we
[8:09] need to take this turn and I guess if we
[8:12] had a little teaching this morning I
[8:15] didn't have I had but one scripture when
[8:17] I woke up this morning so I set my alarm
[8:21] clock early and God knows if that you
[8:24] know I'm not a morning person
[8:26] maybe call like a late night eagle I
[8:28] like to you like to eat my last kill at
[8:31] evening time then just kind of sit the
[8:34] nest and that's kind of when I get my
[8:36] relaxing time so I feel good at night
[8:38] because where were we're here at the
[8:41] evening time in that the Bob said there
[8:43] would be light here as well so yeah so I
[8:46] don't know if that's just how I'm built
[8:48] or there's morning people there's night
[8:50] fitness buff it
[8:51] nosey built each one equal teach one
[8:53] accordingly so so today by God's grace
[8:56] I'd like to teach on a prophetic class
[9:00] you know when we read that scripture and
[9:03] John 2 is said you know the God knows
[9:06] what's in a man as you have all received
[9:11] the Word of God as you've all heard the
[9:15] mysteries unfold you received the Holy
[9:17] Ghost into your souls a sealing of a
[9:19] filling and as you went out and you've
[9:24] I'm sure you've witnessed many times to
[9:26] individuals and how they could not catch
[9:29] it they could not receive it I mean
[9:31] that's the majority of people we deal
[9:32] with the saints of God we witness and
[9:34] there's no no effect
[9:37] you plead with them you show them you
[9:39] unfold mysteries but like I were
[9:42] construction a lot of times I witnessed
[9:43] baptism and I was rolling on a wall
[9:45] because it's unfinished concrete or
[9:47] drywall or whatever I draw it with my
[9:49] permanent marker and there's one time I
[9:51] was witnessing to a man he and uh he and
[9:56] I started breaking out baptism a
[9:58] drawn-out possibly goes Lord Jesus
[9:59] Christ and this and that in it and
[10:01] started dramatizing it was who long
[10:03] manual you're blowing my mind
[10:07] and he just endured all like this and I
[10:11] said man any time you'll be baptized and
[10:13] this gave my car gave my number and he
[10:15] just walked off while his mind was done
[10:17] did I ever hear from him again no but
[10:21] God was dealing with him that day yeah I
[10:24] just didn't speak it I drew a plane on
[10:26] the walls a hand and come down and
[10:28] started writing in the walls again my
[10:31] goodness so so we're dealing with the
[10:35] prophetic class you know God has
[10:38] prophets if you think about I taught a
[10:40] study here a long time ago on the
[10:42] testimony of the earth versus your
[10:44] testimony and if you look at the
[10:47] scripture you look at the types and
[10:48] shadows the earth goes through the exact
[10:50] same stages as a Christian if you look
[10:55] at the earth God actually chose the
[10:57] earth he formed the earth a certain way
[11:00] and God chose you and formed you a
[11:02] certain way
[11:04] and as he's dealing with that chosen
[11:06] world as he's dealing with you as a
[11:08] chosen person as I told him son or
[11:10] daughter whom gone what's one of the
[11:12] next things to take place is that the
[11:14] that God in order for I was like this in
[11:18] order for us to receive salvation the
[11:21] Word of God must come right and if you
[11:24] look at the very first thing God does is
[11:26] he must bring forth the Word of God and
[11:28] the Word of God only comes to a prophet
[11:31] right and according to the scripture the
[11:33] first one that prophesied was denied
[11:36] right Amen the Word of God came to Enoch
[11:38] he saw 10,000 Saints coming down from
[11:40] heaven coming down with the king they
[11:42] might you see that as a second cup and
[11:44] then after that the Bible says now after
[11:46] now in reality what takes place next the
[11:49] Prophet the Word of God cars of the
[11:51] Prophet the Prophet blast it out and
[11:54] then what takes place next if you look
[11:56] at no.1 the Bible said Noah was a
[11:58] preacher of righteousness so then now as
[12:00] the Prophet were blast word the
[12:02] preachers on the earth I would Kant
[12:04] would grasp this word receive this word
[12:07] and go out and start preaching the
[12:09] gospel as well amen amen
[12:11] absolutely and then notice after Noah
[12:14] then would preach the Word of God what
[12:16] takes place on the earth the earth
[12:19] repents and gets baptized see and that
[12:23] is the way I'm salvation okay and then
[12:26] of course with that baptism come to
[12:27] covenant a man which is what the acts
[12:31] 2:38 right here Missy he's so hot hot
[12:34] hot runs just company together events
[12:36] fun then fact the Lord quick of that to
[12:38] me there I think I was supposed to bring
[12:40] it forward you know so here we see is a
[12:42] God when he deals with a prophet a
[12:44] prophet is a special built man the Word
[12:46] of God only comes to the Prophet first
[12:50] right we know that at scripture here at
[12:52] Jeremiah wanted forces and then the word
[12:54] of the Lord came unto me see he says and
[12:56] then I wanted he's speaking now to this
[12:59] man the word comes to him and Jeremiah
[13:02] has no doubt he said why me why what
[13:05] about this person what about that person
[13:07] my daddy I maybe my brother my cousin
[13:09] listen I Jesus but God says before I
[13:12] formed thee in the belly I knew thee
[13:15] gotta hand picks and chooses Lou he says
[13:20] and there and before thou camest forth
[13:21] out of the womb I sanctified be notice
[13:25] this vessel could not enter into force
[13:27] in like maybe I did vacuum in the day
[13:30] ladies in the eighties in the early
[13:33] 2000s at that I did some weird very
[13:36] wicked things he said I sanctified thee
[13:39] and I have ordained thee a prophet unto
[13:41] the nations she says and then said I o
[13:45] Lord God behold I cannot speak he's and
[13:47] far I'm a child and every true prophet
[13:49] of God does not want to fulfill the
[13:51] commission in fact they don't see their
[13:53] shortcomings how many shortcomings in
[13:55] Moses bring out but I can't talk him
[13:57] well i don't think i don't think i'm a
[14:00] i-i-i-i i'm not equipped for this next
[14:03] monday god chooses a prophet he has
[14:06] equipped him for they meant he was built
[14:08] a certain way email he says what the
[14:11] Lord said they say not I am a child do
[14:14] not belittle yourself well on this I'm
[14:17] not this and I'm not that for the
[14:25] William you Friday night you said
[14:27] brother that's your brother always
[14:29] obscenity brother that's your brother
[14:30] that's your brother you said brother god
[14:32] bless reason your crown sir no no you
[14:37] brother your crown you have something to
[14:41] do and you've been doing it whatever
[14:43] prepare yourself
[14:45] there are things coming this is I'm
[14:48] almost gonna say this is not a this is
[14:52] not going to be a five fold ministry at
[14:55] the coming of the Lord just a five fold
[14:58] ministry he says for I am a child he
[15:04] says say not that I am a child for thou
[15:06] shalt go to all that I send thee in
[15:08] watching all the Kamandi thou shalt
[15:09] speak he says be not afraid of their
[15:12] faces for I am with thee to deliver thee
[15:14] saith the Lord if the prophet he says is
[15:23] a special man a prophet is a man whom
[15:26] the word of the Lord
[15:27] comes to amen and don't we love to hear
[15:31] the word of God my goodness when I was
[15:34] in denomination I thought there must be
[15:37] more of the Word of God resistance to
[15:40] that where we hunger where we're just
[15:43] guess he's listened to John Piper I'm
[15:44] trying to go to churches here and there
[15:46] on Friday nights and Saturday nights and
[15:47] Street looking for the world God
[15:49] remember the Bible prophesied then women
[15:51] should go into and looking but he's in
[15:54] there behaved in the land not when we're
[15:57] a while before the hearing of aware of
[15:59] God amen and that's where you get so
[16:04] desperate you gotta crawl this and Lord
[16:06] show me the truth and he brought because
[16:11] because the Prophet is so designed life
[16:13] he says that his conscience and his
[16:15] first conscience is so close together
[16:18] did not go to sleep to dream his dream
[16:21] so as in science there's of
[16:24] conscious and the subconscious behind
[16:26] each other he says and then the majority
[16:28] of people have their separated and far
[16:31] far apart the Prophet even said I made
[16:33] me have to call here later he said he
[16:34] said he said that some of I'm here I've
[16:37] had dreams majority people have dreams
[16:41] he says for those who don't I have
[16:43] dreams he said your subconscious is way
[16:44] he's like to the back of the room but
[16:48] some to have dreams are conscious and
[16:50] their subconscious are closer together
[16:52] easily but a prophet he says they're so
[16:54] close together they can he can jump from
[16:57] one to the other in no time
[16:59] while he's a way he sees it when he's
[17:03] wide awake and now seen how another
[17:05] something God has to do see he's see
[17:07] what's going on he says a Prophet sees
[17:10] away far off way way off see the things
[17:14] that is coming he sees a cup of God's
[17:16] wrath
[17:16] he says floor before his field say see
[17:20] he can say thus saith the Lord God will
[17:22] destroy the city except you repent why
[17:25] he's an eagle
[17:26] he rides way up and Odyssey and he looks
[17:29] way off there and he's he he sees the
[17:31] cup of wrath poured out he goes work he
[17:33] doesn't he does not look at his
[17:34] surroundings but he can see in
[17:37] the future he said that's what the
[17:40] prophets looking at he ain't looking
[17:42] what's going on here he's looking yonder
[17:44] he's saying it's coming the judgment is
[17:47] coming saints of God we are at the Last
[17:49] Judgment there was one of Noah's Dana's
[17:52] what an Abraham they turn one in Christ
[17:54] a to the Jews in 70 AD but now we're
[17:56] coming to the final one of the final and
[17:59] last ones for us amen it's ours
[18:02] bride wise he says he can go so high so
[18:04] we can see that shade was that a
[18:07] darkness he said the world will be dark
[18:10] darkness and gross darkness didn't
[18:13] promise it he said he could not see past
[18:16] 77 he said it would go into apostasy
[18:19] which is a darkness because he goes up
[18:22] high enough the sun's shining out when
[18:24] he sees a shame coming he's saying what
[18:26] he's looking at it ain't here yet but
[18:28] it'll sure be here that's right is going
[18:30] to be here gross darkness upon the
[18:33] people he knows his coming years away
[18:35] yet he sees it why because he is a
[18:37] prophet of God amen no let us take him
[18:40] into the spirit into the heavenlies and
[18:42] shows him what is coming and there's a
[18:45] danger he's a watchman he's looking and
[18:47] he sees the enemy approaching him so he
[18:49] sees what as we saw in Ezekiel and even
[18:52] even was coming and edges here a man
[18:54] sure yes now notice John the Baptist was
[19:00] a prophet sure he says even want to rate
[19:03] the prophet of course that was born of
[19:04] all men as Jesus would say and notice
[19:06] here in Isaiah 40 verse 40 chapter 40
[19:09] verse 3 he says the voice of him that
[19:11] cries and the wareness prepare ye the
[19:14] way of the Lord make straight in the
[19:15] desert a highway for he says our God
[19:18] what is this this is a major prophecy a
[19:21] major prophecy of a major prophet a
[19:23] prophet is the woo the word of the Lord
[19:26] comes to a man and if there is a major
[19:29] profit God is going to show and foretell
[19:32] that he's coming right so that they went
[19:35] that prophet gets you leaving for tell
[19:36] and show what's coming as well amen sure
[19:39] absolutely John the Baptist would this
[19:42] one in fact when a major profit comes on
[19:44] the scene
[19:45] strange things take place and notice
[19:49] once the time is conveyed all the way to
[19:51] Isaiah and once that scripture would
[19:53] been circling the earth for years and
[19:55] years it was waiting fulfilled and at
[19:57] the time of the fulfilling its wraps
[19:59] down and now the Spirit of God
[20:01] prophesized over John the Baptist in
[20:04] baby form here
[20:05] he says for he shall be great in the
[20:07] sight of the Lord and shall drink either
[20:09] wine or strong drink let his commission
[20:11] look he sank him he is sanctified from
[20:13] his mother's womb amen much like
[20:16] Jeremiah he says and he shall be filled
[20:18] will not he should be filled with the
[20:20] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[20:22] sure this is a major profit this is
[20:24] someone special coming on the scene
[20:27] remember this is a prophetic class of
[20:30] people absolutely this is one of the
[20:32] great ones I'll say like in the
[20:33] scripture a man sure these are than many
[20:36] of the totemism shall he turned to the
[20:37] Lord their God and he shall go before
[20:39] them in the spirit and power of eat
[20:41] Elias or Elijah any man he was a major
[20:44] profit praise God
[20:47] but the Bible says he that is least in
[20:49] the kingdom is greater than this one
[20:54] when did the kingdom of God start in
[20:57] acts 2 that's when what the spiritual
[21:02] Israel spiritual bride now is all in the
[21:06] face we heard in the least in that
[21:08] kingdom the least of we had the least
[21:10] gifts the least quality or character
[21:13] whatever but it's still Holy Ghost
[21:14] filled is greater than John the Baptist
[21:18] Amen right sure now look at this here
[21:21] and isaiah 53:1 who had believed our
[21:24] report and to whom is the arm of the
[21:26] Lord revealed for he shall go up before
[21:28] him as a tender plant oma and as a root
[21:31] out of a dry ground he has no form nor
[21:33] comeliness this is someone you will not
[21:35] be drawn to this is not someone that has
[21:38] a big wide broad silver's and most those
[21:41] bouncing here and there and thighs it
[21:43] could shake the ground that when he
[21:45] walked he can leap with and dunk a
[21:48] basketball and 3:16 all kinds of stuff
[21:51] went through his legs behind his back Oh
[21:53] anyhow he does not have a 50 inch
[21:55] vertical he says
[21:57] no beauty that we should desire here who
[22:01] is this talking about this is talking
[22:07] about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[22:09] Amos the one that was not attacked with
[22:12] pain and dying for you the water was not
[22:15] even in any form that we would desire
[22:17] him he's the one that shed his precious
[22:19] blood he forsook live here and took on
[22:22] the crucifixion amen
[22:24] there's no one like me man he's Jesus
[22:28] Christ the righteous the true potentate
[22:31] amen he's the Great when I say like that
[22:35] amen and notice when God Himself comes
[22:39] down there was a forerunner first a
[22:41] great man by the name of John the
[22:43] Baptist and then now God starts
[22:44] revealing himself he men he says into
[22:48] the virgin spouse to meant to a man
[22:50] whose name was Joseph Anna and the house
[22:52] of David and the Virgin's name was Mary
[22:54] and what the angel came down and said
[22:57] you are going to have a son yes this was
[23:03] a god prophet this was the god man sure
[23:07] this was none other than Jehovah come
[23:09] down into what the vessel or the veil
[23:12] which was the body which was Jesus
[23:14] Christ amen this was God the spirit out
[23:17] forming what a body a god body a word
[23:20] body to come down remember he had to
[23:23] come in hell arrest that's the whole
[23:25] plan of God in Genesis 1:1 in a meeting
[23:27] God prayed the heavens and the earth he
[23:31] created two realms why did he create two
[23:35] realms why not just one room I couldn't
[23:38] God just do it all on one realm but he
[23:42] had to create two realms because we had
[23:49] to fall if we would have fallen up there
[23:51] the Bible says that God is a spirit and
[23:55] those that worship Him must worship in
[23:57] spirit and truth
[23:58] and a bod of the spirit and he is the
[24:00] eternal spirit is someone full should
[24:02] fall of there there be no remission of
[24:06] sins how could God die
[24:09] up there he did not die so he hadn't
[24:12] read a specific a special room to write
[24:15] this love story man that's why Jesus
[24:18] Christ is so important once he treated
[24:20] us in Genesis 2 up there and gave us a
[24:24] commission up there and then in Genesis
[24:27] 2 later on he then he places what the
[24:30] man informed a body and put the spirit
[24:33] of the man in there and then now he can
[24:35] fall in that body because that's not a
[24:38] spiritual body and if we fail in our
[24:41] flesh God would have to create something
[24:43] in the fresh or a flesh man to die and
[24:46] make it a substitute of refrigeration
[24:49] but to get us back to that realm they
[24:51] know that's why those two realms amen so
[24:54] that's why Jesus Christ that's the only
[24:57] way to God is through Jesus Christ they
[24:59] know amen secession or beautiful now
[25:05] Lord Savior came and did everything he
[25:09] needed to do 2,000 years ago that's why
[25:11] we're sitting here today why are we not
[25:14] out doing the things of the world and
[25:16] this and that like whoever this is
[25:18] because what God starting dealing with
[25:19] us Gentiles amen
[25:23] but now fast-forward another nineteen
[25:26] hundred years there's another major move
[25:30] on the scene here we're dealing with a
[25:33] prophetic class and I lived in a law a
[25:36] little log cabin the picture hangs over
[25:38] my house today that a person painted for
[25:40] me in California of a little log cabin
[25:42] and in there this little log cabin that
[25:44] morning on April 6 the Midwife opened
[25:47] the windows so the light is shining into
[25:48] to show that mama see what I look like
[25:51] and Papa when they lived in there was a
[25:53] light that coming whirling through the
[25:55] window the size of a pillow and it
[25:59] circle round where I was and went down
[26:01] on the bed and several Mountain people
[26:03] were there standing there he says they
[26:05] were crying my people back before me
[26:07] were Catholic I'm Irish on both sides
[26:09] he's somewhere these are my people that
[26:11] my mother father because he had gotten
[26:13] away from church he says and they did
[26:15] not know what happened of course you
[26:17] know how superstitious the mountain
[26:18] people is oh man go to Thailand
[26:22] there's a light appeared out yonder in a
[26:25] room wonder what kind of young initially
[26:27] what God was meditating he was choosing
[26:30] or dating and sanctified there would be
[26:33] another problem this would not be a
[26:37] God's prophet Li a prophet with God in
[26:39] him Amen yes sure so we see little
[26:44] indication there now he says I was born
[26:46] in a poor family raised up your
[26:49] religious my people will be for me we're
[26:52] Catholic was jump here the next one till
[26:54] I was a little boy about seven years old
[26:55] on mazing how he even said seven and
[26:58] when I was bored he's a firstborn very
[27:00] peculiar thing happened in the morning
[27:01] when I was born and a light came in the
[27:03] room all of them started crying up the
[27:06] mountains where I was to tucky he's
[27:07] where I'm born went on for seven years
[27:09] and at the age of seven years I appeared
[27:11] to me the first time as a voice speaking
[27:13] to me and told me not to smoke to drink
[27:17] to follow myself in any way because
[27:19] there would be work for me to do when I
[27:21] got older this is a major problem God is
[27:26] now prepping the young man for service
[27:29] there's something he must do and God is
[27:33] one-by-one dealing in this man's life
[27:34] showing and showing the people around
[27:37] him that something is happening then one
[27:42] day at the river I was baptizing five
[27:44] hundred people at the river and then all
[27:45] of a sudden the same light that coming
[27:47] when I was a little boy and I was told
[27:48] the people pulled the people that I had
[27:51] been seeing it that they said that I was
[27:53] dreaming of some kind of mental
[27:54] conception that I had but before but
[27:57] before better than 5,000 people bedroom
[28:00] five thousand people at two o'clock in
[28:03] the afternoon in 1933 out of the skies
[28:06] came this cloud coming down speaking
[28:08] these words as John the Baptist was
[28:10] commissioned before forerun the first
[28:12] coming of Christ for ministry will
[28:14] forerun the second coming of Christ
[28:16] where thousands times thousands of
[28:18] people heard it in newspapers be witness
[28:20] to God was going to use something and
[28:24] yeah he'd wait a couple years and boom
[28:27] something wait a couple years and boom
[28:28] something wait a couple using something
[28:32] now look at this now look at this
[28:34] prophets here that came
[28:36] 19:09 or 1906 years after his ministry
[28:41] started he went to the hospital Aaron
[28:43] got examined it's just like your
[28:47] conscious see your subconscious is where
[28:49] you dream I had a physical examination
[28:52] here a couple three years ago by the
[28:54] time wave brainwave you know the doctors
[28:58] come and say hey you're a funny guy
[29:00] for some reason they eat I don't know
[29:03] what happened or whatever he was in the
[29:04] hospital he said hey let's do a little
[29:06] green screen on him
[29:07] kind of a weird little guy here and they
[29:10] did a little brain scan and the doctor
[29:12] said what he said you're a funny guy you
[29:14] know what's the matter he says you know
[29:15] what you could dream when you was why
[29:18] don't we and my science by instrum our
[29:23] technology they can figure this out
[29:27] because now all we're dealing with in
[29:29] the spiritual realm they're picking up
[29:32] the spiritual realm and saying just like
[29:33] the television goes blasting through
[29:35] these right here the reign of those
[29:37] fearful snake go through here we do not
[29:39] see it but they have instruments to be
[29:41] able to pick it off a map and now
[29:43] they're diving into the prophet's brain
[29:47] he said you're funny
[29:50] you could probably dream while you're
[29:52] why do we I said what you can scream
[29:57] when you're wide awake I said I said
[30:01] here's your first conscience and is
[30:03] controlled by your seven or your six
[30:05] senses taste smell smell hear all those
[30:08] things these are your first conscious is
[30:10] only active as long as here in the six
[30:13] senses so here is your subconscious said
[30:16] here is when when these are inactive
[30:19] then you go to your subconscious when
[30:22] these are inactive you're asleep and you
[30:24] go over here and dream a dream and part
[30:26] of you goes over there into this other
[30:28] area into the subconscious and if you
[30:33] have dreams and they've come to pass
[30:34] into the future he says and then you
[30:38] remember what your dream when you come
[30:40] out of your senses is he says and when
[30:42] you come back from here he says all
[30:44] conscious said then you remember what
[30:45] you dreamed when you was out of your
[30:47] senses of taste melts
[30:49] see smell uh feel taste smell seeing
[30:53] here yes he said that's the ordinary he
[30:56] said said that we've never seen it
[30:58] before both of yours are lying right
[31:01] here together they're examining malachi
[31:05] for the seventh star in the hand and the
[31:09] right hand of jesus christ and they're
[31:12] able to sighs somehow got permission and
[31:14] and god-ordained is in science just like
[31:18] that recorder was given for the prophet
[31:20] the bridge a man just like that the
[31:22] pillar of fire came down on 1951 in the
[31:24] camera carton you God allow the
[31:26] mechanical device to catch it and now
[31:28] God has allowed as well the mechanical
[31:30] device to catch what is going on in the
[31:32] prophets mind in the spiritual realm
[31:35] both of yours are lying right here
[31:37] together both of your time timing waves
[31:40] from Kant's subconscious and your
[31:42] other's conscious they never heard of it
[31:44] before my life said man you could dream
[31:47] a dream standing up and why do we so by
[31:51] size they could say you are a prophet
[31:56] look how smart man is getting they could
[32:00] sit here and examine who's got more of a
[32:02] gift and who done and then who would the
[32:03] other one not even discerning the spirit
[32:07] but by mechanical device man's
[32:10] intelligence can now discern who and who
[32:13] why is why is Google why is everything
[32:15] tracking everything you're doing and
[32:17] saying this and that to whatever they're
[32:19] breaking you down so doctor did you ever
[32:23] hear of a vision you said no I don't
[32:26] believe I ever did he says I said are
[32:28] you a believer he said well I'm a
[32:31] Presbyterian many times the problem see
[32:34] but that's not what I asked
[32:36] everybody was too easy but but that's
[32:38] all he said the pastor said the pastor
[32:41] was got some people down here every
[32:42] Thursday night and and all I hear is
[32:46] Presbyterian Presbyterian Presbyterian
[32:47] said I don't even go down I said did you
[32:50] ever read in the Bible he said I have he
[32:54] said together hear what the old prophets
[32:56] of the Old Testament went off into
[32:58] another dimension like that he said is
[33:01] that what you're talking about
[33:03] Ezekiel Jeremiah Isaiah Moses was caught
[33:09] up into that heavenly realm he said well
[33:13] that would be wonderful say brother
[33:14] branham you ought to go I said I've
[33:16] already been interviewed by Mayo C and
[33:18] says but you look at you
[33:20] but look do you ever dream a dream
[33:22] doctor he says oh sure he says I dream I
[33:25] said dream me a dream then go to sleep
[33:29] and dream me a dream he's trying to
[33:31] explain this to this man tell me what to
[33:34] do he couldn't do it you can't do it but
[33:38] ever you but who but ever who controls
[33:41] you could give you a dream of me and
[33:44] then you can wake up and tell it I can't
[33:47] do it neither so the man of God a
[33:52] Malakai forward walked through the world
[33:54] where is he what 60 56 years I think
[33:57] they're 55 years right around there and
[33:59] God would control his very subconscious
[34:02] be conscious and he would see visions
[34:05] uncontrollably he did not choose this
[34:08] God ordained him for this I can't do it
[34:14] either I can't say what is in here it's
[34:16] got to be him that does it and your
[34:18] faith in Him confirmed this word just
[34:22] that a woman no matter what anyone says
[34:24] she believed if she could touch His
[34:26] garment it would be it would happened
[34:27] now he is the same yesterday today and
[34:29] forever that's the only thing there is a
[34:32] man now you just wanted to build a
[34:36] foundation on coffins okay major
[34:38] prophets great ones Jesus Christ he
[34:40] obviously their God prophet the Prophet
[34:43] I'll take a big profit
[34:45] remember the Prophet here is the
[34:48] subconscious cuz they've learned
[34:49] perfectly so who is giving a visions the
[34:52] Prophet Jesus Christ
[34:54] Isiah did not choose anything the
[34:57] Prophet brought it to a man of God
[35:00] right they did not control anything they
[35:05] had no part in it
[35:07] God did everything he orchestrated he
[35:10] built that man like this
[35:13] he built a profit so his brainwaves on
[35:17] the subconscious date word Hartmann tap
[35:21] in here and this because the Prophet did
[35:24] not have enough time to go to sleep
[35:27] every time someone needed healed amen
[35:32] now that's issue switch over here you
[35:37] guys ever hear of a guy named Enoch you
[35:41] know who Enoch is of course you know
[35:45] Genesis 5 and 23 and all the days of
[35:48] Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five
[35:50] years and Enoch walked with God and he
[35:52] was not for God took him but notice here
[35:55] how did God take him Hebrews 11:5 by
[36:01] faith Enoch was translated he should not
[36:05] see death and was not found because he
[36:09] had because God had translated him for
[36:12] before his translation he had a
[36:14] testimony please God but notice how was
[36:18] he translated by faith this man must had
[36:26] the fine Wow of the most pure substance
[36:35] his faith must have been under the
[36:38] boiling hot and refined in the fire the
[36:41] pilot fire all those things that must
[36:44] been the most purest and I hope we can
[36:51] obtain that kind of faith but look at
[36:56] Enochs life here in the days of Noah and
[36:59] them days look at the church Nasir what
[37:02] were they what the church natural hmm
[37:05] scientists builders smart men but the
[37:07] elected Enoch and Noah were shepherds
[37:10] and farmers
[37:12] humble not educated not smart
[37:16] thank God I can fit into that category
[37:19] but no their God anybody we want to fit
[37:22] in that category
[37:23] everyone knows no God shall view
[37:26] exploits a man
[37:27] yes something in their moving he is
[37:30] calling we've got to get after that a
[37:33] bit and that kind of faith the enoch
[37:36] head looks like the exact kind of faith
[37:42] that everyone else now faith is a
[37:47] substance through faith we understand
[37:52] the world's frame were framed by the
[37:54] Word of God so God beginning before
[37:56] Genesis 1:1 had faith waters mountains
[38:04] plan a ground air everything we had
[38:10] around this came from was that the same
[38:16] quality of faith is what Enoch had if
[38:20] you go I challenge you to go to the
[38:22] Hebrew or to the Greek here and look up
[38:24] every one of these faith is it the same
[38:28] Greek word the prophecies can take more
[38:35] faith in this age for a body change for
[38:37] translation but by faith Noah well
[38:43] certainly that wasn't the same faith of
[38:45] yeah certainly
[38:48] Enoch I had a little bit better faith to
[38:51] Noah no that's not what the Bible says
[38:55] the exact same faith well I mean Noah's
[39:05] at the end when destruction was going to
[39:07] hit and to build this building you know
[39:08] there's this big big ship this boat
[39:11] surely the faith would be greater than
[39:13] Abraham see Abraham
[39:17] leave your mom and Daddy go start
[39:19] walking Abraham by three
[39:25] there's no evening right everything
[39:29] behind was exact same thing which was
[39:35] the exact same faith that God you see
[39:42] how simple this is going to get I would
[39:48] go this far number the story the kid the
[39:53] woman here as the daughter grievously
[39:55] vexed says he says she's crying after
[40:00] the disciples saying I want to speak to
[40:01] Jesus and the answer said I am NOT sent
[40:03] back to the lost sheep of the house of
[40:06] Israel then she came and worship saying
[40:07] lord help me but he answered said it is
[40:10] not meet to take the children's bread
[40:12] and cats and dogs and she said true Lord
[40:14] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[40:17] fall in the master's table then jesus
[40:19] answered to do a woman great is i you go
[40:27] in the praise of fair closet and God
[40:28] does an answer go back and he will
[40:32] answer because what at that time you go
[40:35] back in a persistent and keep diligently
[40:38] seeking God that faith will become
[40:41] grateful and there's had a certain man
[40:47] at Lystra is impotent in the feet being
[40:50] covered from his mother's womb it never
[40:51] had who never had walked the same heard
[40:53] paul speak who steadfast if you holding
[40:56] proceed again faith to be healed that
[41:00] faith is the exact same faith that
[41:02] created the heavens in you the same
[41:06] faith that caused the body change did
[41:10] not a change his body Oh Oh God the only
[41:18] reason that these New Testament warriors
[41:22] these disciples those in between X 1
[41:26] here the purity from 33 to 53
[41:28] the reason they did not take a rapture
[41:30] is because it was not the time same
[41:35] thing for years it was there and they
[41:38] had to save and we have the scene all's
[41:42] you have to do is get all underneath
[41:46] that all things are possible
[41:51] amen now notice Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[41:54] the Bible says he blessed Israel because
[41:57] he loved my father's why because he saw
[42:01] faith in Abraham he's also faith and
[42:03] Isaac and Jacob may not so much faith in
[42:06] Jacob they what they hate for the name
[42:07] change he meant it meant prince with God
[42:11] sure now we could hear where we at then
[42:15] brother now noticed here
[42:18] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[42:20] father long the priest of Midian led the
[42:23] flock to the backside desert came the
[42:26] mountain of God even the horror so here
[42:28] he is he's being a shepherd
[42:30] the great prophet Moses was being a
[42:32] shepherd let me place you can I place
[42:35] you this morning what's going on here
[42:36] leave it in the message help 50 some
[42:39] years to the promise of the scene Moses
[42:44] know intellectually by his godly mother
[42:48] our beloved sister
[42:50] jochebed he heard her teaching in the
[42:54] intellectual manner you are the Brian
[42:57] you're going to take a rapture by faith
[43:00] everything's him you are the Enoch of
[43:02] this way you are the last group how that
[43:07] his life isn't spared from the crocodile
[43:09] how that God had made enough I'm a
[43:11] proper child o mine and he was born for
[43:15] deliverer and now and how had Miriam his
[43:18] sister in the prophets they had followed
[43:19] him down to the bathing beach where
[43:21] Pharaoh's daughter was bathing and how
[43:22] that God had brought him up and nurtured
[43:25] him right in the house of Pharaoh and
[43:26] huh and how he's going to deliver the
[43:29] children now intellectually he knew that
[43:33] but what did that produce we know that
[43:35] produce a dedication intellectual not do
[43:40] it
[43:41] the brine that's into lecture whether
[43:45] they go to the priests like this mortar
[43:47] denomination creature right now God
[43:49] loves everybody we're all God's children
[43:52] what is the message preaching role the
[43:55] bride Rob right are we all the bride
[43:58] intellectually people know that oh don't
[44:02] miss a church you might know it from the
[44:04] word standpoint you might know that the
[44:09] Bible said the prayer of faith shall
[44:11] save the sick but you pray until God
[44:14] says the prayer may save you then that's
[44:16] the difference this is more just new
[44:22] intellection that he was a deliverer who
[44:24] knows intellection to the bride we all
[44:27] do he said but when he thought that
[44:31] surely they would understand when he
[44:32] would snow the Egyptian the first little
[44:34] rumor come up come up and he wasn't
[44:36] perseverant at all when this squeeze is
[44:55] we're going to pray we're going to speak
[44:58] the word and think of it intellectually
[45:03] we know that but you let a really no
[45:07] real pressure fall upon you everybody
[45:13] won't draw attention trial here yeah
[45:15] those are prepping you for this that
[45:19] hand is prepping you or something right
[45:22] you know there's nothing about the word
[45:26] man you know this natural realm is not
[45:30] real right how many testimonies went
[45:35] forward of the healings of God doing
[45:37] this God doing that saints of God keep
[45:40] those things in your remembrance those
[45:41] should be feet building things he took
[45:48] for the desert because he wasn't
[45:49] persevered he wasn't too sure he just
[45:53] known it from the word
[45:55] a standpoint the promise now there's a
[45:58] difference between I was actually this
[46:00] week ended running Jessie if it would
[46:02] worked out I preached on Saturday
[46:03] morning I was going to preach on prayer
[46:06] and you know what we can pray all we
[46:08] want but if you do not have see back in
[46:14] your prayer if you ask a miss and
[46:18] hopefully pray but I'm talking praying
[46:21] and knowing that God has done what you
[46:24] requested you can pray all you want but
[46:28] if there is not fee that is what you
[46:32] need that if there is a goddess place of
[46:35] desire in your heart for loved ones for
[46:37] your healing for this and for that if he
[46:40] is place it in your heart it's not and
[46:42] you feel it burning on you and you
[46:45] cannot escape it pray and believe it's
[46:48] gonna happen
[46:49] because it will I don't know brother
[46:53] Jesse knows this 1995 I graduated high
[46:57] school that screen fall of 1995 I start
[47:05] college in defiance and the first thing
[47:08] I told my my my roommate at that time I
[47:11] said you watch when my brothers are
[47:14] smears on over in station and I told him
[47:19] that year after year he's alone and what
[47:23] they do they wouldn't see change and
[47:28] after they won the state championship in
[47:29] fact I'm going to his wedding this March
[47:32] I said Dave you remember when I told you
[47:35] this listen yes I just knew it was going
[47:43] to happen and I started speaking it and
[47:46] it happened power of your confession but
[47:52] notice that same champion had nothing to
[47:54] do with me I wanted that for my brother
[48:02] believe what you believe what you say
[48:06] that's so Carlos I mean it's what I
[48:09] wanted I wasn't a Christian then either
[48:14] I live like a devil but I believed it
[48:19] was going to happen figure that out
[48:23] there's no mystery paradox for you just
[48:27] reach out on Wednesday night I'll be
[48:28] listening Rosie he says but one day
[48:36] after all this intellectual preaching of
[48:39] Moses he knew he was called for this he
[48:41] knew he was the man he knew he was they
[48:43] were the people for the day but one day
[48:46] he saw a bush there was a fire and it
[48:48] was burning and it could not did not
[48:49] consume so Moses took and went up on the
[48:52] mountainside is studying the back bush
[48:54] that was the big pillar of fire was led
[48:56] to him the rest of his days see these
[48:58] things of God until the Holy Ghost comes
[49:01] out in reveals it to me that's when
[49:06] things that's when he cannot be stopped
[49:08] it's too late now Moses could say I've
[49:13] met God
[49:14] I met the pillar of fire I am going down
[49:17] to Egypt amen
[49:18] notice the difference now here's
[49:24] something for you it was Moses who lived
[49:27] peacefully marrying the sheikh of the
[49:28] midians daughters a poor and while he
[49:30] was out there herding his sheep one day
[49:32] on the backs of desert there the
[49:33] familiar old path he was walking down
[49:35] herding the Sheep notice doing something
[49:37] simple he's an at peace Israel was in
[49:39] bondage under slavery and he was
[49:41] thinking on his ways this is not my job
[49:46] as a sheep herding
[49:48] God called me to be a creature how do I
[49:54] know that I'm not preaching to a Moses
[49:56] this morning are there any Moses is here
[50:01] that's out yonder and a steel factory or
[50:04] now here at the pulp Factory don't ask
[50:07] what that is
[50:07] as our yonder driving a truck somewhere
[50:10] that God hasn't commissioned you to save
[50:12] souls instead of doing it you've got
[50:15] a job to make your daily bread living at
[50:17] ease help me Lord and thousand souls
[50:22] bearing into destruction you know how I
[50:26] do not know how I'm preaching to a man
[50:28] or a woman that's called to the mission
[50:29] field and yet you're selling that
[50:31] birthright for a morsel bread come to
[50:33] yourself think on your ways y'all teach
[50:36] to myself here this morning now let's
[50:39] continue to move on a lot of God's man

[51:00] prophet in thine room showing a part of
[51:06] this and found elisha the son of shaphat

[51:12] form and he was with the 12th he was
[51:16] just doing a simple task and a prophet
[51:18] sent elijah god was training in - rope -

[51:27] the word of god he was to lead the
[51:29] twelve tribe of israel as a prophetic
[51:31] realm amen God was training him in the
[51:34] natural but remember he was just a
[51:40] farmer a simple farmer I die where are

[52:43] unstoppable or whole team
[52:46] you let the 1992 an amazing I never be
[52:49] duplicated carnally when's the

[53:01] down at the time of the open book we are
[53:08] done right there's nothing left God now
[53:12] reveals corruption in the ministry at
[53:16] that time of the revelation or the
[53:19] revealing of the corruption ministry now
[53:22] it is time to pray right and God says in
[53:28] Ezekiel even if I would put together a
[53:32] dream team and the Lord of Lord came and
[53:36] me saying son of man when the land
[53:38] sinneth against me by a trespassing
[53:40] grievously then will I spread forth my

[54:52] of the open book and let them do their
[54:57] jobs let them do what they did back
[54:59] there because if they're alive today and
[55:00] if you do the exact same thing because
[55:02] what's more ya know what's right here
[55:07] that's the dog bring a dream team down
[55:10] here in this age though these tree mana
[55:14] know damn well don't read they should
[55:17] deliver with their own Souls by their
[55:20] righteousness saith the Lord
[55:24] they wouldn't be to do except see
[55:27] himself right name ow please Noah the
[55:33] creature of rice in the days don't book

[55:45] many souls we wait to see how many it
[55:46] sold to be witness to don't worry Noah
[55:49] could do any better than you Daniel
[55:52] could not do any better
[55:55] Joe could not do any better cause of you
[56:04] amen in the days of the open book I
[56:11] dream teams though these three men he
[56:14] says it three times though these three
[56:17] men were in it as I live saith God said
[56:20] I am a witness they would be able to do
[56:23] nothing more than save their homes cells
[56:28] saith the Lord God they should deliver
[56:30] neither sons nor daughters they wouldn't
[56:34] be able to save no would not even be
[56:35] able to do what he did before
[56:37] his three sons and his three super
[56:41] daughters in-laws
[56:46] they only shall be delivered but the
[56:50] land shall be desperate decimals
[56:53] saints of God this is an individual fair
[56:58] this is not Jewish time this is Gentile
[57:01] delivers time God deals with individuals
[57:04] the Prophet said he said I'm I know
[57:07] you're going to hate this but remember
[57:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ was only
[57:11] given to you not the rest of the title
[57:16] even John but it's only to be of God
[57:19] only God have mercy on me not a person
[57:30] or if I bring a sort of hung land and
[57:33] say sword go through the lands like aa
[57:35] man and beast man though these three men
[57:37] were in it as I live saith the Lord God
[57:40] they shall deliver neither something out
[57:42] for the show only deliver themselves you
[57:43] look at themselves brings a dream team
[57:49] down and they can't do anything
[57:52] that's how evil this agencies
[57:57] that's how wicked how dark it is
[58:02] remember in the days open book no our
[58:07] day is supposed to be partly know as if
[58:10] days Noah as a days a lot right
[58:11] but we never seen lasting he has no idea
[58:15] the amount of insanity is these men have
[58:19] never seen a combination of both of the
[58:22] most wicked times I remember these three
[58:29] didn't have the Holy Ghost four times
[58:40] though no and Daniel jail for in it as I
[58:44] live saith the Lord God they should
[58:45] deliver neither son of how they shall be
[58:47] divided live of their own souls by their
[58:48] righteous why is it a more time because
[58:50] there's four things of judgment come oh
[58:52] my now let's continue on here don't want
[58:58] to train this horse
[58:59] study is to transition something you
[59:00] okay we've been dealing with major
[59:03] prophets I'm talking serious men oh god
[59:06] bitters they can catch the light their
[59:08] way I mean God set them designed they
[59:13] had no doubt who God was and who they
[59:15] were and the God was speaking to them
[59:16] and that this was God and I me and we
[59:19] have something here and no one else can
[59:20] figure out sigh I feel like a weird
[59:22] strange person here I'm different I'm a
[59:24] what a prophet
[59:28] let's read this here real quick now the
[59:33] thing that we're talking of the question
[59:35] is this should men or should women do
[59:37] that's exactly what started the church
[59:40] in its chaos at the beginning they had
[59:43] taken all the solemnity of the from the
[59:46] audience and placed it in the pulpit do
[59:51] you see what's happened in this message
[59:52] the minister is the great one remember
[59:55] this is the most important is the word
[59:56] and it is what we remember who you what
[1:00:02] is this vessel he was supposed to do
[1:00:04] here
[1:00:04] assistant minister what is he supposed
[1:00:06] to do he's supposed to Lord show me him
[1:00:09] give me a thought
[1:00:10] he gets the thought don't we put it
[1:00:12] together for me okay snapped and then
[1:00:15] now I must deliver it to the most
[1:00:17] precious people on the face very this
[1:00:23] person standing here is there's nothing
[1:00:26] about he wants to be here this guy is
[1:00:32] already heard what he's talked back here
[1:00:34] he already heard this hearing those was
[1:00:37] what is in his mind well God is showing
[1:00:38] right hearing it but it's not working
[1:00:52] this is not to exalt any figure up here
[1:00:57] God is a God of the audience the
[1:01:02] fivefold is only this look at the
[1:01:05] portion what percentage of the body is
[1:01:06] is thus canvassing the Prophet the
[1:01:10] Evangelist the apostle
[1:01:12] the pastor of the teacher now how they
[1:01:14] use it right what portion of the book I
[1:01:16] mean my personal body is the most
[1:01:21] important part because when I still
[1:01:24] might hope that hurts when I sprain my
[1:01:27] ankle
[1:01:28] this really doesn't do I mean it helps
[1:01:30] but you need every portion of the body
[1:01:33] off everyone is equally important or in
[1:01:40] that and the Papa said why because the
[1:01:43] women will have a greater reward on the
[1:01:45] other side
[1:01:46] what if let's just pretend what if the
[1:01:49] woman have a greater problem in the men
[1:01:51] because they had to live and dress a
[1:01:53] certain way in this way today who is
[1:01:58] something I said who is the great one
[1:02:01] who are the little ones or should be the
[1:02:04] little ones should be the minister who
[1:02:08] are the great ones then you guys this is
[1:02:12] for you and what does the devil do he
[1:02:17] pushes pushes you under his thumb and
[1:02:20] says the man is the great one the movie
[1:02:24] stars the rock stars of the message is
[1:02:27] the minister's no this is for you that's
[1:02:34] exactly what started a church in his
[1:02:36] chaos at the beginning they had taken
[1:02:37] all the solemnity from the audience in
[1:02:40] place in the pulpit but God is the god
[1:02:43] of the audience see he works in every
[1:02:47] human being
[1:02:48] he lives in every heart they can get
[1:02:51] into he finds those tempted people who's
[1:02:53] that tough he says he prays the gifted
[1:02:56] people and works through them what does
[1:02:59] he mean what is he saying
[1:03:01] let's read further now if the devil
[1:03:04] can't catch one of them things one of
[1:03:06] them thing and then he runs out comes
[1:03:08] over here and makes a big conglomeration
[1:03:10] nothing nothing it runs the people way
[1:03:12] like Paul said when we come together if
[1:03:14] you speak return he send the unlearned
[1:03:18] comes in and st. and said you're crazy
[1:03:21] foolish somebody's speaking in tongues
[1:03:23] and this and this on all of everything
[1:03:25] he's
[1:03:26] that won't work but he said if one
[1:03:28] prophesized that revealed the secret of
[1:03:30] the heart then they'll say truly God is
[1:03:32] with you
[1:03:33] what gifted purse he's talking about
[1:03:35] those gifted with the nine spiritual
[1:03:37] gifts of the ferryman which is supposed
[1:03:40] to be new in the audience how many
[1:03:46] messengers creatures have fallen from
[1:03:48] the mess I walks administer the Holy
[1:03:53] Ghost by the enthusiast seat of God all
[1:04:01] right until eventually I have heard the
[1:04:04] greatest minister I have a hurt and tied
[1:04:06] this message boy I mean wet I said it
[1:04:09] several times nice and wet because it is
[1:04:11] so beautiful you know he's in right now
[1:04:14] divorced wife remarried in town and now
[1:04:18] he's wandering around the world doing
[1:04:22] you can write the greatest minister I've
[1:04:25] ever heard
[1:04:26] as far as being able to tie the
[1:04:28] scripture together right amen you know
[1:04:37] that shakes me to the core that text
[1:04:40] every time I think about it I check
[1:04:42] myself yeah
[1:04:45] is this real absolutely yeah he said but
[1:04:53] if one speak with tongues by a
[1:04:54] revelation he gives the interpretation
[1:04:55] of somebody to the MFI to edify what the
[1:04:59] minister no the church then the whole
[1:05:03] church has edified by it see this is for
[1:05:06] is for the entire body amen
[1:05:09] it's all walled it or not at all it were
[1:05:13] divided what does that say if you're
[1:05:17] dividing you can be conquered and if the
[1:05:20] clergy divided from the laity the
[1:05:25] conquering coming or has conquered
[1:05:28] something that will speak and God will
[1:05:31] speaking in languages and nothing no
[1:05:33] nothing about it will give to one
[1:05:34] interpret by another one and say a
[1:05:36] certain thing it happened just exactly
[1:05:38] the way I said the
[1:05:40] you got the Spirit of the Lord among you
[1:05:43] saints of God we wanted the promise that
[1:05:45] there will be a church with nine
[1:05:47] spiritual gifts operating in the local
[1:05:50] assembly a man look it up look it up and
[1:05:52] according to Damon Church it out be sure
[1:05:55] let's keep that he says oh let's strive
[1:05:57] for that friends the Prophet that

[1:06:39] clean you up and when you're leaned up

[1:09:24] if we need all that but we it you
[1:09:26] includes all the bride now let's start
[1:09:33] wrapping up here man out you know
[1:09:36] now here's what I'm going here's here's
[1:09:37] actually the scripture that I actually
[1:09:39] started with you the words of Amos who
[1:09:43] is among the herd men of Toccoa and he's
[1:09:48] all concerning Israel the days of uzziah
[1:09:51] the king of Judah and the days of
[1:09:52] Jeroboam the son of go ask king of
[1:09:54] Israel two years before the earthquake
[1:09:56] so two years before the earthquake what
[1:09:58] happens and he said the Lord will roar
[1:10:00] from Zion
[1:10:02] ties right into Revelations 10 roars out
[1:10:07] Christ's coming down here oars the seven
[1:10:08] thunders this is this right but notice
[1:10:13] Amos that were Tacoma means a trumpet he
[1:10:19] was in the time or the herdsman or the
[1:10:23] Shepherd's in the time of the trumpet
[1:10:26] shout voice Trump at the last time for
[1:10:30] the last hour at the last right before
[1:10:34] the coming of the Lord
[1:10:35] this is his location and notice directly
[1:10:38] after that the earthquake hits but first
[1:10:40] the Lord
[1:10:41] roars out of Zion a trumpet and the
[1:10:45] Prophet always said if Amos was here
[1:10:48] what do you think he would do he would
[1:10:49] stay with the word that's what he would
[1:10:51] do you know what he would tell us where
[1:10:53] we've been taught off the foundation of
[1:10:56] the original Word of God he tires were
[1:10:59] far away from the first Pentecostal
[1:11:02] church I felt the whole point of mankind
[1:11:04] for was he said get back to prayer pops
[1:11:08] why do I send you Elijah the prophet the
[1:11:11] turn are the hearts of the children back
[1:11:13] to the APIs on table which was Pentecost
[1:11:17] amen so if anyone is a true minister he
[1:11:23] will point back if Amos was here about
[1:11:27] the spirit those on Amos it is in us
[1:11:30] amen he would try somewhere far away
[1:11:33] from the first Pentecost of Scripture
[1:11:35] hey man way ourselves remember Pentecost
[1:11:43] is original there is no other way and
[1:11:48] notice what also camps here in Amos Amos
[1:11:50] 3:6 buna shallots probably blowing the
[1:11:52] city the people not be afraid fella tree
[1:11:54] evil the city and where and I've done it
[1:11:56] sure the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:11:58] you reveals his secret unto his servants
[1:12:00] the prophets the law have Lord who will
[1:12:05] not fear the Lord has spoken who can but
[1:12:11] prophesy but remember the lion is going
[1:12:14] to roll out of Zion
[1:12:19] kind of classy you win Saints think
[1:12:23] about it
[1:12:24] look what liquid Amos says here he goes
[1:12:26] down then he starts blasts misery blast
[1:12:28] him and blasts them and looking first
[1:12:31] twelve and Emmas aya Amaziah said of the
[1:12:33] Amos oh thou seer he calls my prophet
[1:12:36] though they away through into the land
[1:12:38] of Judea and there he threatened
[1:12:39] prophesy there he said but promise I not
[1:12:42] again
[1:12:42] Norway Bethel or the house of God we
[1:12:46] don't want you in our apartment here at
[1:12:48] the house of God you're not welcome
[1:12:51] anymore
[1:12:52] but if Amos was here he would put him
[1:12:54] back to medical they matter and look
[1:12:57] what the Prophet says then answer name
[1:13:00] said I was no he did not have a cane
[1:13:07] jewel come into his room of his birth
[1:13:08] and say well what is going on here what
[1:13:12] he was seven years old he did not hear a
[1:13:13] voice as if this is that and he was
[1:13:17] baptizing 19 whenever I was mad no boys
[1:13:20] chained here and said he will bring
[1:13:22] forth joy he said I was no prophet
[1:13:29] neither was i have prophets son are you
[1:13:33] catching this are you touching what I'm
[1:13:35] trying to lay down here before you he
[1:13:37] said when I was a herdsmen and gather of
[1:13:40] sycamore fruit and the Lord took me as I
[1:13:43] followed the flock and the loads of me
[1:13:45] girl prophesy unto my people Israel he
[1:13:50] was just a simple shepherd a farmer a
[1:13:55] hunter-gatherer if you will and God
[1:13:58] hand-picked it brother you brother you
[1:14:09] is that possible it happened and I
[1:14:15] screamed today is it was a great prophet
[1:14:17] long ago Amos when he come down come
[1:14:19] down to that see he said I'm not a
[1:14:21] prophet he's nor so the prophet but if
[1:14:24] the line was new
[1:14:27] you are the bride of Jesus Christ and if
[1:14:30] you were around the lion on this stage
[1:14:33] how can you not with prophesy he might
[1:14:36] talk to me seems to me he said when God
[1:14:41] speaks through the prophesy he predicted
[1:14:43] judgment upon the generations of the
[1:14:45] very God you came to serve will destroy
[1:14:47] you
[1:14:49] man now put this on tape you remember
[1:14:53] the very God that these people is

[1:15:33] simple and I don't want to hit him but
[1:15:36] into both fields in the world there was
[1:15:38] a fence and the man said he's an
[1:15:40] intellectual just heart and he said he
[1:15:42] said you know what he says I don't want
[1:15:44] to be in his view I don't have any hate

[1:16:30] all figured out Henson's is actually the
[1:16:32] genius I'm quite a first person in
[1:16:33] history to figure this out I have a
[1:16:36] couple of hours later devil come back
[1:16:38] hey aren't you coming the guys like no I
[1:16:42] think I pick my spot
[1:16:45] well don't you know that I own the fence

[1:16:54] time you try to ride the fence a devil
[1:17:03] in the fence
[1:17:05] hey men now let's wrap up here I don't
[1:17:09] want to keep you too long here now look
[1:17:14] at this here Jesus Christ came down
[1:17:18] Houdini pick there was two major
[1:17:21] denominational organizations that time
[1:17:23] the Pharisees and Sadducees and what God
[1:17:26] came down he chose two fishermen here
[1:17:30] two fishermen here they're not clergy he
[1:17:38] picks a tax collector named Matthew
[1:17:42] calls Philip and Nathaniel he rounds up
[1:17:46] his dream team here he's got 12 warriors
[1:17:49] he puts them through a little test he
[1:17:51] says about to destroy devil Kingdom they
[1:17:52] were tearing it up right you know that
[1:17:59] dream team those eleven disciples were
[1:18:03] so important that they were actually
[1:18:07] prophesied all the way back in the book
[1:18:09] of Joel a bunch of nobodies they were
[1:18:14] not religious leaders they did not know
[1:18:17] the Bible and could roll the scrolls and
[1:18:19] put a pin right there that they were
[1:18:20] shut they were simple men they were tags
[1:18:25] me oh my
[1:18:27] but God hadn't picked him why because
[1:18:29] God knows what's in a man
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:33] alright let me tell you something when I
[1:18:38] saw this quote it blew me away the Alpha
[1:18:44] the Omega is the same he said I am Alpha
[1:18:50] and Omega
[1:18:51] what was the Alpha ministry Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] come down in his church pure for twenty
[1:19:00] years he never said anything in between
[1:19:09] I'm talking pure God what will you
[1:19:16] produce has the omegaco already where is
[1:19:20] the church with nine spiritual gifts
[1:19:21] where is the church operating fully
[1:19:24] under the Holy Ghost like we want to see
[1:19:26] brother like we want to see like we know
[1:19:28] what we're going to see like the book of
[1:19:29] Acts absolutely no tanking of man made
[1:19:34] anything he never said anything in
[1:19:38] between uh-huh I am Alpha and Omega that
[1:19:42] first and the last Luther was not Jesus
[1:19:45] Christ ministry that was not the Omega
[1:19:48] Wesley was not the Omega
[1:19:50] Azusa Street was nothing left oh my god
[1:19:52] our messenger was not the Omega the
[1:19:55] Omega is coming it is coming for a body
[1:20:00] movement it is a jolt to warrior in town
[1:20:04] is it soul to movement where God comes
[1:20:08] into his children and the Bible said
[1:20:11] there will be an army like there never
[1:20:12] has been or ever will be it will be us a
[1:20:16] man by the grace of God amen now
[1:20:20] continue on he calls it the great
[1:20:23] masterpiece of a family the second Adam
[1:20:27] in the second Eve now let's continue on
[1:20:30] here I want to close here by other
[1:20:31] because race putting finest pie here I
[1:20:34] want to show you this too why are the
[1:20:37] majority or a lot of message churches
[1:20:39] dead I'll say like that and what we from
[1:20:42] what I hear how can the Holy Spirit
[1:20:45] possibly be
[1:20:46] organization when it is organization
[1:20:48] that takes the place of the spirit the
[1:20:50] problem said this message will never do
[1:20:52] nominate it doesn't need you but if
[1:20:56] there's an organization of men or
[1:20:58] ministry it actually pushes the spirit
[1:21:01] out sure they don't need to change one
[1:21:04] quote they don't need to change one
[1:21:05] scripture but if they can just get the
[1:21:07] Holy Ghost out of the system and then
[1:21:11] once the Holy Ghost is out of the system
[1:21:13] now a denominational spirit can come in
[1:21:15] and replace the word of God but while
[1:21:17] the Spirit of God is here nothing can
[1:21:20] change the word because we call now ting
[1:21:21] that a man sure now let's just read a
[1:21:26] scripture here in first name there 16:7
[1:21:31] I'm sorry I'm just phone winning
[1:21:32] teaching this teach on the kitchen
[1:21:33] tables two to three hours fit this heart
[1:21:36] so sorry
[1:21:38] but now notice daniel has come to pick
[1:21:41] the chosen king the chosen one and by
[1:21:44] his own intellectual looking at the
[1:21:46] natural physical pure istic so the man
[1:21:49] LEM come to form and surely the Lord's
[1:21:52] anointed is before him but the Lord said
[1:21:55] to Samuel look not on his countenance
[1:21:57] during the height of the stature because
[1:21:58] I have refused him for the Lord seeth
[1:22:00] not as Nancy for man looketh on the
[1:22:03] outward appearance of the Lord looketh
[1:22:04] on the heart can you handle this last
[1:22:07] movement will you be so humble and so
[1:22:09] weak it's so metal holding those that
[1:22:13] God will use you in his last Amen let's
[1:22:20] continue on here remember Christ is the
[1:22:23] church Christ in the true church is a
[1:22:26] continuation of the book of Acts
[1:22:29] okay we're closing here he knows as a
[1:22:33] people can get the true revelation of
[1:22:35] the true church how does the child is a
[1:22:38] true church operate really we'd have to
[1:22:43] go back to the scriptures we'd have to
[1:22:44] search the message oh co d well as you
[1:22:47] can dig a lot deeper than that and what
[1:22:50] she is what she stands for and that she
[1:22:54] can do the great work she would be an
[1:22:56] invincible army but what is this if they
[1:22:59] get that
[1:23:00] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:23:03] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:23:05] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[1:23:07] Antichrist spirit seats will be posted
[1:23:09] for him he will be as definitely Thor
[1:23:11] today as when Christ was stood as every
[1:23:12] effort in to gain power room in the
[1:23:14] desert and how are we gonna do that
[1:23:17] there's Christ forty days fasting
[1:23:20] fasting no food forty days without food
[1:23:25] God in flesh
[1:23:27] now all power is accessible you can
[1:23:31] speak this speak that I think this
[1:23:33] business is he couldíve this Hubble tell
[1:23:36] the devil get behind me but what does he
[1:23:38] use he uses the Word of God the very
[1:23:41] scripture itself amen
[1:23:46] you will recall that I mentioned at the
[1:23:48] beginning of this message that the boat
[1:23:49] we are trying to try studying is the
[1:23:52] actual revelation of Jesus himself you
[1:23:53] may stand now they're stretched a little
[1:23:56] bit by God's grace wave them arms shake
[1:23:59] the legs a little bit sorry I'm
[1:24:01] long-winded you on that's right you know
[1:24:03] when the termites are same where I come
[1:24:05] from is living waters taverley
[1:24:07] Tabernacle we call LWT long-winded
[1:24:09] technical so we were the long services
[1:24:13] and long studies this is for long and
[1:24:15] drawn-out my goodness now he says he
[1:24:20] says the book were standing here is the
[1:24:23] actual revelation of Jesus himself in
[1:24:25] the church and his work in the future
[1:24:27] ages that I mentioned that it takes the
[1:24:30] Holy Spirit to just give us the
[1:24:31] revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:24:34] bringing these two thoughts together
[1:24:37] you'll see that it won't take just
[1:24:39] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:24:42] book real as this would become more real
[1:24:44] to you this weekend and on the Bible it
[1:24:47] is going to take the operation of the
[1:24:51] Holy Ghost plus the Holy Ghost plus the
[1:24:54] noise of man oh yo thanks for woolly dog
[1:24:56] that means the book can't be revealed to
[1:24:58] anyone for the special class of people
[1:25:02] it will take one a group of people let
[1:25:07] me go to the audience one with prophetic
[1:25:11] insight
[1:25:13] well what about these great prophets
[1:25:14] saints of God we're dealing with the
[1:25:16] last prophetic group where the Eagles be
[1:25:20] there where the carcass is there will
[1:25:23] the eagle's be what is Eagle prophetic
[1:25:25] site they'll be able to see exactly that
[1:25:29] vision is necessarily but they'll be
[1:25:31] able to see the word just it's clear
[1:25:33] that it will take one with prophetic
[1:25:36] insight will require the ability to hear
[1:25:38] from God
[1:25:39] it required supernatural instruction not
[1:25:42] just the student comparing verses verse
[1:25:44] though that is good but the mystery
[1:25:45] requires the teaching of the Spirit or
[1:25:47] it never becomes clear how we need to
[1:25:51] hear from God and lay ourselves open to
[1:25:53] community to the spirit to hear and to
[1:25:55] know it is the revelation of God that
[1:26:00] will give you authority over the devil
[1:26:03] let's jump right I just want to look at
[1:26:08] this here one of the evidence of the
[1:26:10] Holy Ghost but God hath revealed to us
[1:26:13] by his Spirit for the spirit searches
[1:26:16] all things yay is that it is that all of
[1:26:21] it no but that's important God will
[1:26:23] continue unfold beefer and what to make
[1:26:26] it more clear and clear the Word of God
[1:26:28] let's bow our heads dear how the Father
[1:26:31] Lord forgive me Lord for being so long
[1:26:33] and drawn-out lord I just bless the
[1:26:35] people god I pray Lord to you edified
[1:26:38] them Lord God I have no part of this law
[1:26:40] but Lord just you just gave this is what
[1:26:42] you gave in going on and go we love you
[1:26:44] so much you're less every soul and
[1:26:46] pushing way out god lord I pray Lord
[1:26:47] their faith is increased God know just
[1:26:50] like Enoch needed faith Lord for that
[1:26:52] lift off God or the exact same faith God
[1:26:55] we need for healing just the exact same
[1:26:57] faith we need more when we pray God
[1:26:59] notice all we need is that simple and
[1:27:02] hyssop blowing out that simple common
[1:27:04] faith is still enough to make a wraps
[1:27:07] for this day got a Pawnee chief don't
[1:27:10] bless the people God really understand
[1:27:11] everything God if I send the wrong order
