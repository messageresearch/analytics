[32:06] - I want to continue on the Thyatira
[32:09] church age my view good works again like
[32:12] last month as I've studied prayed and
[32:14] thought about it as a preparedness
[32:15] morning I just thought I would and I
[32:18] felt led to go into the church ages
[32:21] again it increases the Lord I'll
[32:25] probably two more services maybe more
[32:26] running on the side to tear in church
[32:28] age and get to the Sardis church age by
[32:32] God's grace hope it's been a blessing
[32:36] you know
[32:38] you know there's as a pastor you can
[32:41] imagine it's kinda like at your home
[32:43] like let's say you have visitors to your
[32:45] home they can kind of get a sense of
[32:48] what's going on in the home like if
[32:49] everything's going good or if we're
[32:51] struggles right you can kind of get a
[32:52] sense of that but the people that live
[32:55] at home they know everything that's
[32:56] going on okay and so what I mean by that
[33:00] is like for the church as a pastor I
[33:02] know a lot about what's going on the
[33:04] church you know just with different
[33:06] everybody different families individuals
[33:07] and just like you people that
[33:09] all the time you good idea - and the
[33:12] reason I'm saying that is because I feel
[33:14] like these church ages have really given
[33:17] a glimpse into things going on in the
[33:19] church I'll just have to leave it a very
[33:21] broad as pastor tonight
[33:22] I never want to lose any confidence with
[33:25] people I never want to share anything
[33:26] personal I possibly can't for the saints
[33:29] that stay here you know they can make
[33:31] this their church home but I really feel
[33:34] like the church ages these server
[33:36] services have really showed us things
[33:38] that are going on everyone's a life and
[33:41] our lives the good and the bad blessings
[33:45] and also the struggles and I think if
[33:47] you're honest you can see your life in
[33:48] the trees church age sermons as well but
[33:51] I know person I've just been meditating
[33:53] on that this week they could watch these
[33:55] things that we've heard these quotes we
[33:58] preached these scriptures we read
[34:00] they're so applicable to all of us and
[34:03] the things that families are going
[34:04] through right now it's really I really
[34:07] believe it because I can see it I kind
[34:09] of know what's gone you know I can have
[34:10] a little bit idea what's going on in
[34:12] people's lives that let me know it so
[34:16] just be encouraged you know if it
[34:17] doesn't seem like it's maybe client for
[34:19] those live-streaming or anyone here you
[34:21] know it is a lie so we just got to be
[34:23] able to hear what the Holy Spirit
[34:25] setting to us amen so let's look at this
[34:27] here we're look at our text and this
[34:30] part five update tonight and chapter 2
[34:33] verse 20 so I'd like to do is read that
[34:39] and then have it on the screen relation
[34:44] to 20 through 23 I like to read about
[34:47] four scriptures there I hope to if I can
[34:53] get to verse 23 tonight why don't I read
[35:02] verse 20 and then our everyone else can
[35:06] be 2122 endeavor 3:21 re verse 20 now
[35:11] we're standing out a few things against
[35:12] thee because thou sufferest that woman
[35:14] Jezebel which call her self a prophetess
[35:17] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[35:20] commit fornication and to eat
[35:22] being sacrificed unto idols now let's
[35:25] all reverse 21 ready 1 2 3
[35:27] and I gave her space to repent of her
[35:30] fornication and she may benefit not thou
[35:34] reversely to behold I will cast her into
[35:38] a bed and then they commit adultery with
[35:42] her into Great Tribulation except they
[35:45] repent of their deeds
[35:47] let's read 23 together 1 2 3 and I will
[35:52] get over her children would it be - and
[35:54] all the churches shall know he which
[35:58] searcheth the reins and hearts now we
[36:01] get it learn to everyone we're not you
[36:03] according to your horses so let's look
[36:06] at those scriptures tonight it's kind of
[36:08] serious scriptures you know it again
[36:09] real serious I remember this was the
[36:11] darkest age so it had to be very serious
[36:13] Christ had to really lay out a very
[36:16] serious warning of this second death
[36:17] that's just our as here as we create
[36:20] more time help me Father Lord have need
[36:23] of you tonight and come humbly
[36:25] reverently speak to us dear Lord of this
[36:28] word doing precious to us as you are

[37:09] I was able to record the serpent seed
[37:10] video and the beginning of the book of
[37:14] Revelation videos finally after all
[37:16] these hours and weeks of writing script
[37:18] and getting out all the thoughts laying
[37:19] out everything I was able to record that
[37:21] and so now I'm going to edit it
[37:23] hopefully I'll get a first video done by
[37:24] next week if I can God is very really
[37:27] excited to get that done and put it up
[37:30] there by God's grace I think we have a
[37:33] thirteen hundred subscribers
[37:36] to the YouTube channel and almost
[37:39] 150,000 views total that's pretty great
[37:43] by God's grace people are viewing that
[37:46] and hear the message of the hour praise
[37:49] God so let's look at tonight here as our
[37:53] text we read number text here we're
[37:55] still looking at higher tier of course
[37:56] the longest church age the church with
[37:58] the least amount of length because of
[38:00] persecution the darkness of persecution
[38:02] that's why I was called the dark ages
[38:04] and that's why that Dark Horse writer
[38:06] that's why that anointing and he stopped
[38:08] we actually started riding around here
[38:10] when they really started getting the
[38:11] indulgences going at Dark Horse Ryder
[38:13] Road quite a while killing here in the
[38:18] dark ages and of course capturing the
[38:20] wealth of the world this is when you
[38:21] begin our here around a thousand
[38:23] thousand ad started capturing the wealth
[38:26] of the world and there of course is
[38:27] Colombo's life there as we've talked
[38:29] about numerous times so tonight like I
[38:32] said I spent most of my time working on
[38:34] the video so I'm going to I don't have
[38:39] all the quotes out there so I'm going to
[38:40] be reading some of them like I did a few
[38:41] weeks ago by God's grace so hope that's
[38:44] alright
[38:45] I just want to be pulling in some more
[38:48] quotes here from scriptures by the grace
[38:52] of the Lord so I want to look at these
[38:53] paragraphs I just I just typed out the
[38:55] paragraphs so they'd have to just it
[38:57] takes a lot of time to copy and paste
[38:59] them over I think I'll just read these
[39:01] here that woman Jezebel right now that
[39:06] woman Jezebel so I want to start with
[39:08] paragraph 227 yeah I want to start a
[39:13] paragraph two now we end off we ended up
[39:17] looking at Jezebel on Sunday and we
[39:22] looked at how she was the most greatest
[39:25] curse and all the world is a is a woman
[39:28] who's got the iron disposition right
[39:31] swamps her way all the time
[39:33] forces her way right the woman with iron
[39:36] disposition but brother Ram says it's
[39:38] equally perverted for a man to be a weak
[39:41] man so we don't want to preach too hard
[39:43] on the sisters and not the same heart on
[39:45] the brothers
[39:46] however we preach are the brothers we
[39:48] want to preach
[39:49] the same on the sisters so we looked at
[39:53] that and I hope that was helpful by the
[39:55] grace of Lord I was a couple of hands
[39:56] and went up antenna service so I was
[39:57] happy to see that as the needs were met
[40:00] there now brother Branham started
[40:02] talking about Jensen oh so we'll look at
[40:03] a little bit about Jezebel and I found
[40:06] the very day that I did preach that
[40:08] message was when I preach on the spell
[40:12] of Jezebel that's when Elijah said
[40:15] that's when he went to calorie so there
[40:17] must been a good anointing that night
[40:19] and he got baptized later on the same
[40:24] day at Amen was baptized
[40:26] I remember Elijah cry after coming out
[40:29] of the water that was real to the
[40:30] touching time now he was really simply
[40:36] seemed to be sincere
[40:37] so very thankful for that now it says
[40:41] the very first and important thing that
[40:43] we learned about Jezebel is she's not a
[40:45] daughter of Abraham so she wasn't in the
[40:47] right seat right now the right scene
[40:50] light now remember the seed lighting
[40:52] mattered up to the days of Noah right
[40:55] your seat your physical genetic seed
[40:59] line mattered until the days of Noah
[41:01] because you had that you had another
[41:04] good thing preaching on our teaching on
[41:05] serpents II so it's kind of fresh
[41:06] overnight you had in Genesis for you had
[41:09] Cain seed line right and then in Genesis
[41:11] 5 you have Adam seed line and their
[41:14] separate seed lines right because uh
[41:17] shaken interjected his seed into the
[41:20] human race came through Cain and Cain
[41:23] had all the characteristics of the
[41:24] serpent right the characteristics of
[41:26] Satan as well a murderer a liar from the
[41:29] beginning but out of the seed they began
[41:33] to call upon the Lord remember that
[41:34] praised God said what's out of that Seth
[41:37] and had some descendants then men begin
[41:39] to call upon the Lord so they had a good
[41:42] they had a good seed line so that's how
[41:44] you know your seed line today
[41:45] it's not a natural seed line it's a
[41:47] spiritual seed line if you're born again
[41:49] of the spiritual seat of the Baptist and
[41:51] Holy Ghost what do you do call upon God
[41:53] amen
[41:54] you cry out to God you worship God
[41:56] that's exactly right and that makes us
[41:58] the children of Abraham by a spiritual
[42:01] seed by
[42:02] faith in Christ Jesus program said she
[42:06] did not come into Israel by the way that
[42:09] Ruth did she came in by marriage of
[42:12] course 2 a.m. so she didn't come through
[42:16] the blood she came through marriage
[42:18] right and we know we got to all come
[42:21] through the blood right hallelujah
[42:24] Ruth of course came through the blood
[42:27] and of course through marriage but she
[42:29] would have went through all the acts of
[42:30] purification which of course we know
[42:33] Jezebel denied Jezebel was the daughter
[42:37] of a murder remember that her dad was a
[42:39] murderer so she had murder in her
[42:41] lineage just like hey right was like hey
[42:43] in AWS descendants they had murder in
[42:46] their lineage that's right now I want to
[42:52] read that program says this from the
[42:57] time of Abe's marriage to Jezebel
[43:00] idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion
[43:03] so once Jezebel got into the church
[43:07] would say the idols increased
[43:10] drastically right and brother hams have
[43:12] that increase or that was a
[43:14] foreshadowing right of JFK bringing
[43:19] rolling Catholic Church influence back
[43:21] into America and of course we can all
[43:23] see the idolatry that's increased in our
[43:25] day and it just keeps increasing right
[43:27] it just keeps getting worse and worse
[43:30] and worse now you're seeing it you're
[43:33] seeing on Facebook now they're really
[43:35] pushing even children that are wanting
[43:38] to trust or cross-gender right that's a
[43:41] big thing now 7 year olds 8 year olds 9
[43:44] year olds letting them dress and
[43:46] transgender that's a big thing now is
[43:48] being able to let children go it's not
[43:50] enough for a little an adult to do it
[43:52] now that spirit wants to jump on
[43:54] children and ruin lives right also ruin
[43:57] lies it's awful look that's what you see
[44:00] on the news
[44:00] the total perversion the total idolatry
[44:03] and it's increasing more and more
[44:06] right we're seeing that just like the
[44:08] type show once jessabelle got in there
[44:11] the idolatry starts increasing
[44:16] they met no Milgram said see that's what
[44:20] the Spirit is setting forth in the fire
[44:23] tear in church age 1/2 married Jezebel
[44:27] and she did it as a political maneuver
[44:29] to strengthen his kingdom and secure it
[44:32] that's exactly what the church did when
[44:34] it married under Constantine they both
[44:37] got together for political reasons
[44:39] though they put a spiritual heir to it
[44:41] aren't you glad you got together with
[44:43] your spouse for spiritual reasons aren't
[44:46] you glad aren't you glad you come to
[44:48] this church for spiritual reasons praise
[44:51] God I married my wife for spiritual
[44:53] reason I knew she loved Christ of course
[44:56] I loved her you know as well but the
[44:59] main decision was spiritual decision
[45:01] right that's why we choose our church
[45:03] there's so many churches out here you
[45:05] have many churches you can marry out
[45:06] here right spiritually we could be
[45:09] married to many different churches out
[45:10] here but we choose to be married based
[45:13] upon the word amen Christ the work
[45:15] hallelujah amen that's why we're united
[45:18] with this church tonight with Christ
[45:20] hallelujah is because of the work not
[45:23] because of the carpet not because of the
[45:25] chairs not because of the parking lot
[45:27] but because of the word but many people
[45:30] is not that way many people I talked to
[45:33] many friends I have they choose their
[45:35] church based upon the children's
[45:36] ministry and you'll never find out the
[45:38] Bible you never find children having a
[45:40] separate ministry children were supposed
[45:42] to sit with the families why so the
[45:44] family can feel United
[45:46] the churner could see the parents enjoy
[45:48] the word right love the word and then
[45:51] that would make the children want to
[45:52] love the word you never never saw we
[45:56] never saw the modern evangelism right
[45:58] but I had my cousin my cousin told me he
[46:01] go chooses his church because of the
[46:02] rock and roll right and I have other
[46:05] friends later said that choose it older
[46:06] friends that just choose well so our
[46:08] children can have a ministry so we can
[46:10] sit in peace and quiet in the service
[46:11] that's why and see not understanding
[46:15] that God does his what the pattern God
[46:17] doesn't want the church to pattern off
[46:19] the world God wants the church to
[46:21] pattern off the word and so I met
[46:24] friends I back so we got to be able to
[46:25] and I have
[46:26] like that we've got to be able to keep
[46:28] continue stay married in Christ the
[46:30] right reasons a day I believe you have
[46:32] special Wednesday night when were the
[46:34] only five of the four adults are here
[46:35] tonight tip you gotta love the word to
[46:37] be here tonight Amen Alleluia
[46:40] but that is what it was Jay have a
[46:42] jessabelle was just like Constantine and
[46:45] the Roman Catholic Church the same
[46:47] marriage now Milgram said Constantine's
[46:52] idea was to get everyone together the
[46:54] pagans and Christians he says but the
[46:58] real believers came along to see if they
[47:01] could bring back the ones that had
[47:02] drifted away from the word so once again
[47:05] we see true believers will always try to
[47:08] get people to repent amen
[47:11] always those true believers try to get
[47:13] Constantine's group and member the
[47:15] church in Rome number Polycarp went to
[47:16] the Church of Rome to try to get it to
[47:18] come back and they wouldn't come back so
[47:21] we've got to at least try to get people
[47:23] to come back to the Word of God that
[47:25] should be us holding those who are
[47:27] drifting away like I'm texting brothers
[47:29] or texts hoses brothers or sisters I
[47:31] lead the church you know please come
[47:33] back please come back to the word we
[47:36] should be the ones holding the Drifters
[47:38] back to the word amen
[47:40] that should be our duty to speak our
[47:42] heart but program said the false church
[47:45] will fight the true Pentecostals I don't
[47:48] mean the organization I mean the ones
[47:50] who are Pentecostal because they're
[47:52] filled with the Holy Ghost and have the
[47:54] signs and gifts in their midst because
[47:56] they walk in truth they meant holiday
[47:59] yeah I like that
[48:00] Great Scott he says this next yeah I
[48:06] vote for the next paragraph
[48:07] it's 228 no that's to 20 to 29 yeah our
[48:12] new to 29 now if you remember the
[48:16] scripture Jezebel took the the state
[48:21] money and erect into huge houses of
[48:24] worship to a star T and Bale remember
[48:28] that he we build a house of bail it was
[48:30] a massive house my man said history says
[48:34] that was the big enough for all the
[48:36] Israel to come in
[48:37] worship their act and when Constantine
[48:40] in the church married
[48:41] he gave the church buildings instead of
[48:43] altars and images and organized a
[48:45] hierarchy that had already been shaping
[48:47] up now I don't remember the history but
[48:49] I never read the Bible somewhat after
[48:52] the time of a hab was going for revival
[48:55] I forget who it was it might have been
[48:56] Ju but they gathered they said oh let's
[48:59] go worship Bailey remember that
[49:00] description Lenny remembers that having
[49:01] read through that they gathered all the
[49:03] workers let's go worship Bale now the
[49:05] true Christians into the true Jews did
[49:07] that not Christian they said oh let's go
[49:09] to the office of male worship and once
[49:11] they got all the sinners in there they
[49:13] said this is the judgment of God and
[49:15] they killed all the communal workers in
[49:18] bales house that was God's idea of
[49:21] judgment right because judgment begins
[49:22] in the house of God well in that case
[49:23] judgment began with house of bale as
[49:25] well judgment was pouring forth so the
[49:29] very house that they were worshipping of
[49:32] false idols of false gods and God
[49:35] allowed them to die that house is that a
[49:36] type of today that type of today the
[49:39] very houses and churches people go to
[49:41] the worst Street buildings are
[49:43] worshipping by Creed's that house is
[49:46] where they'll have a spiritual death
[49:47] that's exactly right
[49:49] spiritual death in those houses
[49:52] themselves now let me move on here but
[49:58] rancid had got so bad in the days of
[50:00] Jezebel and Elijah thought he was the
[50:01] only one left right but God had 7,000
[50:06] more that had about the knee - Bailey go
[50:09] to the right now amongst those
[50:11] denominations of Baptists Methodists
[50:13] Presbyterians there are some that will
[50:15] come out and come back to God I want you
[50:18] to know that I am NOT now and never
[50:21] happened against the people it's the
[50:23] denomination the system of organization
[50:26] that I'm against I have to be against it
[50:29] for God hates it they met so see we're
[50:32] not against the people were against the
[50:34] system so like today even yesterday I
[50:37] got to witness somebody gotta tell me
[50:39] about Bill Graham I got to worship or
[50:41] witness to the cashier Walmart and God
[50:45] you know he said oh he said I was weak
[50:47] and I said great I said we spent all of
[50:49] Sunday
[50:49] knowing Church
[50:51] the kids were all standing right there
[50:52] and I said Saturday went to a friend's
[50:54] house and then we did something for oh
[50:56] we went to that crazy thing with dance a
[50:58] church dancing a event that they did
[51:01] they dance in the duro godly way they
[51:04] dance for Jesus and he said oh said what
[51:07] church you go to
[51:08] I said well I'm a master with Church
[51:10] riding high scholarship he said what
[51:12] denomination I said no doubt no
[51:14] denomination I said we follow the
[51:16] Ministry of William Brandt and he said
[51:20] you believe in speaking in tongues I
[51:21] said yes I do but it's not the evidence
[51:23] of the Holy Ghost he said what I think
[51:27] it is I go to Apostolic Church I said
[51:30] okay and I said that I said we had a
[51:33] speaking in tongues I said a few months
[51:34] ago in February I said but we just can't
[51:38] say it's the scripture I said I grew it
[51:40] in church where they spoke in tongues
[51:40] every Sunday almost and he and then he
[51:44] changes to because I started saying
[51:46] something he said well maybe I need to
[51:48] study that more I'm not quite sure you
[51:50] know if that's the evidence of the Holy
[51:52] Spirit or not I said here abroad I said
[51:54] here's my card call me and let's talk
[51:56] about it now he hasn't called me yet I
[51:58] hope he will or the most people that
[51:59] don't but if he's a lack of God he will
[52:02] if he's left but I but he said he makes
[52:08] mention of this here and I wanted him to
[52:11] know I wasn't against him I was against
[52:14] the organization and says you've got to
[52:15] speak in tongues because I was raised
[52:17] under that and I let him know I said I'm
[52:20] thankful that the Assembly of God
[52:22] denomination of Pentecost then I was
[52:25] raised on thankful they pray for me I I
[52:28] said I was thinking for their prayers
[52:30] their financial support I said they were
[52:32] fine fine people now what would it look
[52:35] like about I said oh they're a bunch of
[52:36] Devils they weren't they were very
[52:39] they're very kind very loving people but
[52:43] see you see how we can't attack the
[52:45] people we got attacked the doctrine we
[52:48] got to attack the organization and so I
[52:51] was able to say we don't agree with that
[52:53] doctrine but I love the people and so
[52:56] God has showed me that you know through
[52:57] brother branham's
[52:58] teachings so forth that we've got to be
[53:00] able to love the people but totally
[53:03] disagree with
[53:03] after and so that's what we do by God's
[53:06] grace that just kind of reminded me of
[53:07] that I felt really I felt really happy
[53:09] yesterday I got the witness of my life
[53:11] finally something I want to talk about
[53:12] God it's all artifice it but there was
[53:15] one said yesterday by God's grace now
[53:18] bambam said remember this Jezebel spirit
[53:21] was the spirit that was in the churches
[53:24] in Thyatira and he said member how they
[53:26] did it they had a prophetess sit on a
[53:28] tripod remember that from a few services
[53:31] ago a prophetess old woman prophetess
[53:34] had to be a woman prophetess in Thyatira
[53:36] when Thyatira became the literal seed of
[53:38] Satan he said and she sounded a try
[53:42] vanities tripod you see it hears the
[53:44] Prophet is called Jezebel and she's
[53:46] teaching the people fell for this church
[53:50] age it had to be a woman and she would
[53:53] prophesy and yet they have a sexual sins
[53:58] I'll just say like that Hartman saying
[53:59] it either way that's where you got
[54:01] fornication here in the scripture says
[54:03] she was teaching them to commit
[54:04] fornication right and he things
[54:07] sacrificed unto idols so this woman but
[54:11] the church that was led by a woman in
[54:13] Thyatira was a symbol of Jessica they
[54:16] did car Jezebel but because a woman was
[54:18] leading the people jesus said that's the
[54:20] spirit of Jezebel right the same demonic
[54:23] spirit right same spirit and remember
[54:26] church let me know this is rough I know
[54:29] it's rough but the denominational
[54:31] churches will have the same destiny as
[54:34] jessabelle I know that's rough but if
[54:36] you have a list of the four see lately
[54:38] you'll remember day if you get to listen
[54:40] to Matt Berger's brother heads by saying
[54:42] that slaps horse rider a spiritual death
[54:45] and where does that death ultimately
[54:47] head take them to the Battle of
[54:49] Armageddon my man is going to be hot and
[54:51] heavy there because you have all those
[54:53] sinners and here comes Christ writing
[54:55] the white horse the pure white horse out
[54:57] of heaven and my dad said he's got his
[54:59] resurrected Saints behind him on white
[55:01] horses and they say how would you say
[55:03] there's not animals in heaven because
[55:05] here Jesus comes out of the heaven of
[55:06] heavens riding a white horse and he's
[55:09] got all those white horses behind him
[55:10] there's animals in heaven amen
[55:13] I think you progressive Loretta I'm
[55:15] surprised at your scripture lack of
[55:17] scripture dollars and don't think there
[55:19] is animals in heaven because Jesus comes
[55:22] out of the very third heaven with
[55:24] animals amen
[55:25] remember the same destiny that Jess
[55:30] about a hat is the same destiny that the
[55:33] churches have today that deny the Word
[55:36] of God taught those that noth-nothing
[55:39] ones that love the Word of God those
[55:40] that deny the word of God and will take
[55:42] the mark of the piece and will love the
[55:43] Catholic Church and will love
[55:45] denominations right they have the same
[55:47] destiny but Madison why is that it's
[55:49] because there was a jessabelle and
[55:51] Elijah in both days ha ha hey what do
[55:55] you mean well just Elijah have we had
[55:57] you had brother bran hey Dad we've had
[56:00] the spirit of Elijah so if there's a
[56:02] spirit of Elijah here there's got to be
[56:03] a habit just about here too hey what is
[56:06] that the Roman Catholic Church now
[56:07] Jezebel's daughters which we'll get to
[56:10] in just a moment here if that just a
[56:12] moment I'll probably close of that
[56:13] thought so see because we have a we had
[56:17] a half Kennedy Jezebel the Roman
[56:21] Catholic Church or you could say his
[56:22] wife because she influenced so many
[56:23] women but it's awesome in the Roman
[56:25] Catholic Church because you have a man
[56:26] Jezebel and Elijah brother branham you
[56:29] have to have the same destinies of all
[56:31] of them praise God that's exactly what
[56:33] we have that has to repeat now I oughta
[56:36] just over eaten by dogs right so that's
[56:38] the difference but for those are dogs
[56:40] lick their blood and ate their bones but
[56:43] in Armageddon its Birds remember if the
[56:46] fowls of the air come together to the
[56:48] Bible set the great feast
[56:49] so both both spirits of just about the
[56:53] spirit of Jezebel there the woman
[56:55] Jezebel the spirit of Jezebel the
[56:56] churches both destinies are to be eaten
[56:59] by animals in that a shame that's an
[57:02] awful thing all because they don't care
[57:05] what the Word of God says we should be
[57:07] more loved with our Bibles than we ever
[57:09] were attention because that's the only
[57:11] way we're not going to be deceived amen
[57:13] is to know this word hallelujah you
[57:16] should know the truth and the truth
[57:17] shall set you free
[57:17] it's exactly right so we shouldn't be
[57:21] reading our Bibles less we should be
[57:22] reading our Bibles more
[57:24] teaching our Bible for me teaching the
[57:26] Bible or reading it more loving the
[57:28] Bible Lord's actually right now let's
[57:31] move on now have I read 29 3 yes I did
[57:40] okay now but man said this woman on the
[57:44] tripod was seducing them and teaching
[57:47] them to commit fornication but RAM says
[57:49] that fornication for us is symbolic of
[57:52] idolatry or idol worship it we've gone
[57:55] through that right we know all the
[57:56] height of smoking drinking money right
[57:59] all these things can be idol sports
[58:01] people all that movies all these things
[58:03] to be idols and that's the idols of
[58:06] today you know that so but if all
[58:09] churches will allow them to keep doing
[58:10] that a man working it's kind of nice but
[58:14] it's kind of discouraging because he's
[58:16] getting he's trying to get on fire for
[58:17] God and he's going to a a mega church in
[58:21] the Farallon area might know which one
[58:23] of this in my city but he come up to me
[58:27] and he was like all brother Justin
[58:28] because me brother Jesse I think you
[58:30] been even had even at work because
[58:32] another Jesse indeed knows I'm a bastard
[58:35] but he said all there's a great sermon
[58:37] on Sunday unique on Monday he saw me and
[58:39] said this he said oh and the pastor was
[58:42] saying this this and that but then the
[58:44] sad part was he said but see the pastor
[58:46] said it's okay if we still watch dirty
[58:48] shows with with cussing on it and all
[58:51] these things and watch murders and he
[58:53] said because we've got to stay in touch
[58:55] you know and with the culture and all
[58:56] these days don't think and like at that
[58:59] point I stopped smiley and I get really
[59:00] sad like this is awful like I'm happy
[59:03] see he wants to draw closer to God but
[59:05] those preachers are going to be guilty
[59:07] on the day of judgment because they're
[59:10] pointing the people off the word instead
[59:12] of pointing them to the Word of God so I
[59:15] just try to don't change the subject and
[59:17] talk about something that I preach or
[59:19] something I heard preach but then he
[59:21] wrote me uh he sets up really nice he
[59:23] wrote me out of the text and said you're
[59:24] a real light to me this year at school
[59:26] as I said praise God at least something
[59:28] is getting through to him you know I try
[59:31] to ignore what they say and just change
[59:32] the subject point it back to Christ but
[59:36] see that's what the people are feeding
[59:37] them today
[59:38] isn't it awful same thing there they're
[59:41] saying it's okay to be in idolatry it's
[59:43] not okay Christ must be number one
[59:45] Christ must be our greatest love in bed
[59:48] he must be our focus all throughout the
[59:50] day morning noon and night what better
[59:52] thing to focus on in Christ that's
[59:55] exactly right
[59:56] but see that's the idol worship that
[59:58] this woman the spirit of just about
[1:00:00] today the churches is giving out to the
[1:00:02] people it's okay to have idols it's okay
[1:00:04] to commit which is actually spiritual
[1:00:06] fornication in other words not being
[1:00:08] true to Christ but falling in love and
[1:00:10] giving your love like Samson to Delilah
[1:00:12] giving your love to anything other than
[1:00:15] the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:00:17] Legrand said every fornicator will wind
[1:00:20] up in the lake of fire right that's what
[1:00:23] the Bible says there in Revelation
[1:00:24] chapter 20 fornicators all those things
[1:00:27] will have their part in the lake which
[1:00:28] burneth with fire so even spiritual
[1:00:31] fornicators okay now next I'm going to
[1:00:34] next page I only got a few more slides
[1:00:41] all right program sit down let us go
[1:00:45] over here revelation 17 and see this
[1:00:47] woman the church who is living on false
[1:00:49] prophecies and not the Word of God in
[1:00:54] verse 1 of revelation 17 god calls her a
[1:00:58] great why is she a because
[1:01:01] she's in idolatry
[1:01:04] she has caught the people up in to the
[1:01:06] same thing what's the cure for idolatry
[1:01:09] and we know the Word of God
[1:01:11] I like how brother that makes it simple
[1:01:14] how do you cure idolatry come back and
[1:01:16] we'll lay the word so this woman is a
[1:01:18] because she has left the word
[1:01:20] there she is sitting upon many waters
[1:01:23] which means multitudes of people this
[1:01:25] surely has to be the false church
[1:01:27] because the Church of God is small few
[1:01:29] there be that find it be generous you
[1:01:30] take a look at the Vatican I've never
[1:01:32] been that would you ever look at the
[1:01:33] pictures they have idols all the way
[1:01:36] around the Vatican like all the tops of
[1:01:38] the building there are statues
[1:01:39] everywhere and out of that but they have
[1:01:41] those paintings with native people all
[1:01:43] over and they wonder you know people
[1:01:46] wonder why those priests get into the
[1:01:48] trouble they get into right with
[1:01:50] molestation
[1:01:51] and all kinds of evil things they wonder
[1:01:54] because it's it's a spirit of idolatry
[1:01:56] they're praying to evil spirits right
[1:01:59] they're calling Mary the mother of God
[1:02:02] they're literally into idolatry praying
[1:02:06] to demon powers and everybody thinks
[1:02:08] it's okay everybody says oh they're so
[1:02:11] spiritual oh it's so Reverend it's a
[1:02:12] false reverence right because there's no
[1:02:16] repentance if there's no repentance it's
[1:02:18] not the Spirit of God amen
[1:02:20] if the Spirit of God brings us to
[1:02:21] repentance he said that is I love I
[1:02:24] rebuke them other there we go now I
[1:02:26] bring them back to the promises of God
[1:02:28] back to the word right so that's why
[1:02:33] she's a and then she spreads her
[1:02:35] love with all the kings of the earth
[1:02:37] right number I showed the picture if you
[1:02:39] don't know a couple years ago I preached
[1:02:41] on that and almost every nation under
[1:02:43] heaven has ambassadors from the Vatican
[1:02:46] that go out to the countries right and
[1:02:48] so see that's how she's spreading her
[1:02:51] fornications she's sharing her love
[1:02:54] she's spreading her false doctrines and
[1:02:56] her idols with the nations of the world
[1:02:58] and his guilty as the mother of all
[1:03:01] harlots the mother the Bible says
[1:03:04] guilty of adultery I'm sorry in idolatry
[1:03:10] lamented sir surely she has to be the
[1:03:12] false Church because the Church of God
[1:03:14] is small few that'll be the fighting I'm
[1:03:16] happy about that
[1:03:17] praise God amen let's go to verse 21
[1:03:20] revelation 221 let's go there we'll get
[1:03:22] to the next one it's called space to
[1:03:24] repent allogram gives us a illustration
[1:03:28] here I'm sure he gives you the title
[1:03:30] Gravatt a title revelation 221 and I
[1:03:40] gave her space to repent repent of her
[1:03:42] fornication and she repented not so
[1:03:49] Milgram says did you know that this
[1:03:52] church was actually more wicked than a
[1:03:55] hat Legrand says because a had actually
[1:03:59] repented the Bible said and for a while
[1:04:01] walk softly before God her brother had
[1:04:05] said
[1:04:05] can't say that a varoma Catholic Church
[1:04:08] right when in the Roman Catholic Church
[1:04:10] apologize for the Inquisition when they
[1:04:12] apologize for the Crusades
[1:04:15] they've never apologized last year the
[1:04:17] Pope got in trouble for going into one
[1:04:19] was it Syria I don't know which one he
[1:04:21] went into and he brought an accusation
[1:04:23] from the past and said this country's
[1:04:25] still guilty and everybody got upset
[1:04:27] because he wanted her here every can of
[1:04:29] what he said against this country
[1:04:31] I wish it would wrote that down but see
[1:04:34] then they don't have it in them to
[1:04:35] repent they don't have it in them to
[1:04:37] come back to the work just like any can
[1:04:39] couldn't rip them right Esau tried to
[1:04:42] repent but couldn't get it because he'd
[1:04:44] already passed the line between mercy
[1:04:45] and judgment in other words God are you
[1:04:46] given the blessings of the birthright to
[1:04:49] Jacob is that right so he couldn't get
[1:04:51] it back just like the Roman Catholic
[1:04:53] Church they've already given the
[1:04:54] birthright away thank God who's got the
[1:04:56] birthright we've got the birthright we
[1:04:59] can be born again on Olivia but they've
[1:05:01] already turned it down they don't want
[1:05:03] it they rather have denominations
[1:05:04] increase that they'd have the Word of
[1:05:06] God
[1:05:07] oh my it's a striking thing now let's
[1:05:15] look at this here I want to go to the
[1:05:18] thought in verse 22 yeah that's what
[1:05:22] this talk now I want to try to do this
[1:05:24] and preach me about twenty more minutes
[1:05:25] yeah and then we'll be good the Lord
[1:05:28] with it by God's grace so oh yeah I had
[1:05:35] to stop here I want to lay this out here
[1:05:38] I went through my sermon that I preached
[1:05:40] on the spell of Jezebel and this was the
[1:05:43] order of Jezebel first she brought in
[1:05:46] the false worship of false gods then she
[1:05:49] built her own church then she killed the
[1:05:52] prophets and then she started feeding
[1:05:55] her own prophets and that ties him with
[1:05:57] that four-step course of sin that we
[1:05:59] went over on Sunday remember that that
[1:06:01] four-course step it ties him perfectly
[1:06:04] she Burgess brought it in a book just a
[1:06:06] little bit of idols right and then she
[1:06:09] started building her kingdom
[1:06:10] killing the prophets see those killing
[1:06:12] and building your kingdom and at the end
[1:06:14] you're feeding her own crop your own
[1:06:16] prophets all right your May
[1:06:18] in your kingdom so great to rule over
[1:06:20] everybody else order that we saw the
[1:06:23] course of sin go through on Sunday night
[1:06:31] and I forgot about this
[1:06:33] first Kings 1819 said she spread a table
[1:06:37] before her false prophets and there was
[1:06:40] she was feeding her prophets I did a
[1:06:43] pretty see the tiger you see spiritually
[1:06:45] she became the pastor of the prophets
[1:06:48] did you see that they were feeding at
[1:06:51] her table oh mercy right she became the
[1:06:56] shepherd of her own creatures right she
[1:07:00] was feeding them she becomes the
[1:07:03] bachelors to see what the spear of the
[1:07:04] Antichrist does it tries to serve the
[1:07:06] pass to Authority that's why I told you
[1:07:08] we got to be careful about what's going
[1:07:10] on with a lot of churches are saying Oh
[1:07:12] pastors need to sit down and play tapes
[1:07:15] it's hitting a lot of churches it's it's
[1:07:17] in fact the one church that does the
[1:07:20] most has the Church of almost 800 people
[1:07:22] that show up and sprung up almost
[1:07:24] overnight
[1:07:25] last year 800 people rally around this
[1:07:29] thought of all we don't need a pastor to
[1:07:32] preach we just want to play the tapes
[1:07:33] and what is that done that is taken away
[1:07:36] God's gift of a pastor it's eliminated
[1:07:39] Scripture and it's interjected something
[1:07:41] new right we don't want to try to carry
[1:07:44] the Ark on a new cart we want the
[1:07:46] overlay we want to on the shoulders of
[1:07:48] the Levites are you with me Terrance
[1:07:49] Amen one of the shoulders of God called
[1:07:52] man hallelujah that will pack the Word
[1:07:54] of God that's exactly right let's see
[1:07:57] what they're doing they're replacing
[1:07:59] God's form right away let's try to do on
[1:08:01] let's try something new when brother
[1:08:03] Graham never taught that weather I've
[1:08:05] never said to do that as we've mentioned
[1:08:06] recently what are they doing I believe
[1:08:09] it's the spirit of Jezebel right and
[1:08:11] it's giving somebody the opportunity to
[1:08:14] be a pastor rather than a God called man
[1:08:16] and doing it God's provided way I
[1:08:19] believe that now verse 22 brother
[1:08:23] Branham brings us out let's read 22
[1:08:25] behold I will cast her into bed and then
[1:08:29] that commit adultery with her into Great
[1:08:32] Tribulation except
[1:08:33] depending their deeds and then you reach
[1:08:34] 23 and I will kill her children with
[1:08:36] death now if you listen to the server
[1:08:38] from 1960 brother Graham said whoa he
[1:08:40] goes like that whoa
[1:08:42] you see listen to you kind of shook me
[1:08:44] baby laughs he's like whoa
[1:08:46] he said children the woman's got
[1:08:49] children are the random says that's
[1:08:52] quite a striking revelation is really
[1:08:54] think about it think about before you
[1:08:56] before you knew that you know we didn't
[1:08:59] know whose it we didn't know who we
[1:09:01] thought the Satanists were God's entity
[1:09:02] right we thought the Church of Satan was
[1:09:04] God's enemy poorly sided before the
[1:09:06] message I thought you know sinners rock
[1:09:09] and roll stars you know they're they are
[1:09:11] the enemy but when we come to the
[1:09:13] message we see that the mother is the
[1:09:15] greatest enemy of the church the mother
[1:09:18] harlot and not only her but she's got
[1:09:21] daughters why is that the greatest enemy
[1:09:22] because they're deceiving people making
[1:09:25] people think they're right with God and
[1:09:27] they're totally not right with God
[1:09:28] they're only right kind of Devils
[1:09:32] Vincent whoa so what this woman has
[1:09:35] children and she was a if that's
[1:09:38] the case she had sugared by her
[1:09:40] whoredoms that she must be burned with
[1:09:42] fire as ezekiel says his ego says
[1:09:44] Ezekiel 36 had burned the with
[1:09:46] fire right so that's why she got to be
[1:09:50] burned with fire right before the
[1:09:52] Millenium right after the Battle of
[1:09:53] Armageddon Christ comes the sword comes
[1:09:56] out sometime after that maybe it's the
[1:09:58] sword itself but she's got to be burned
[1:10:00] with fire because the Bible said in
[1:10:01] Malachi 4 they walk up out on the ashes
[1:10:04] of the wicked right so at some point
[1:10:06] after a verb again and there's got to be
[1:10:08] fire to burn up all the sinners because
[1:10:11] their horns to God's Word I know that's
[1:10:13] a flat word and what's hard to say but
[1:10:15] it's nothing but the truth it's it's
[1:10:18] it's hard to say that was true her hand
[1:10:22] will be burned with fire her end is the
[1:10:24] lake of fire but stop and think about
[1:10:28] these children for a moment a woman is
[1:10:30] the one out of whom the children come
[1:10:32] it's evident of this woman had children
[1:10:34] that came out of hurt but they did the
[1:10:35] same thing she did she'll be one church
[1:10:38] and ever came out of organization and
[1:10:40] didn't go right back into it there is a
[1:10:44] one that one Luther's came out and then
[1:10:46] or
[1:10:47] I was right back and today they're
[1:10:48] hand-in-glove with this ecumenical move
[1:10:50] the Methodists came out and they
[1:10:51] organized right back the Pentecostals
[1:10:53] came out and organized right back he
[1:10:56] said there is going to be another coming
[1:10:57] out and praise God they won't be
[1:10:59] organized back because they know the
[1:11:01] truth that group will be the bride of
[1:11:03] the last day see she's coming out but
[1:11:06] she won't go back in and she won't let
[1:11:08] that demon come in her church either
[1:11:10] that's exactly right that's why we got
[1:11:13] to watch if there's oh if there's any
[1:11:15] sinful move coming in the church like we
[1:11:19] said just like with morally things like
[1:11:21] TVs like movies right standards fall for
[1:11:24] men and women they stay and the holiness
[1:11:26] standards fall we got to be careful of
[1:11:28] any little thing right because that's
[1:11:32] what was sort of seeing people's lives
[1:11:34] crumble
[1:11:35] I had a quote if I was going to preach
[1:11:36] on the good works but brother Graham
[1:11:38] said what's the first thing that Satan
[1:11:40] bites off he says off a tree he said the
[1:11:42] bugs bright off what first the fruit
[1:11:45] because that's the sweetest part right
[1:11:47] everybody already knows that it's the
[1:11:49] sweetest part so Satan will bite off
[1:11:51] your fruits of the spirit love joy
[1:11:53] patience goodness gentleness right you
[1:11:56] lose your jet I used to be so gentle
[1:11:58] now person lost their gentleness what
[1:12:00] was it the Antichrist spirit starts
[1:12:03] taking that sweetness away Loretta said
[1:12:05] what's the next thing he bites off the
[1:12:08] leaves everybody said that's the
[1:12:10] fellowship under the hot Sun so then
[1:12:14] they stopped first people will still
[1:12:15] come to church but they lose their
[1:12:17] happiness for God that's the first thing
[1:12:20] they lose there's fruit of the Spirit
[1:12:21] the second thing is they'll just stop
[1:12:23] coming to church all together because
[1:12:24] that's the leaves that's the fellowship
[1:12:26] and then the bark is the third step no
[1:12:29] more protection right and then the
[1:12:31] fourth thing the last step is the life
[1:12:32] he said to get to the sack they get to
[1:12:35] the life of the tree so I want to make
[1:12:38] sure I bring that up by God's grace
[1:12:39] let's remember that see the bride's
[1:12:42] gonna come out and she's going to stay
[1:12:44] out and she's going to keep the bugs out
[1:12:46] Thema hmmm because we got the best
[1:12:48] repellent there is right here the Word
[1:12:50] of God the best
[1:12:51] you can possibly get other than we just
[1:12:54] spray it all over throw it all over
[1:12:56] preach it all over wherever there's sin
[1:12:58] we just apply the word to it and it
[1:13:00] drives those demon powers back that's
[1:13:01] exactly right
[1:13:03] amen no infestations for us praise God
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:08] now I'm trying to close here let me do a
[1:13:10] few more things here
[1:13:11] okay few more paragraphs yeah I think I
[1:13:21] missed one no I'm sorry I did miss one
[1:13:27] okay let me go back program oh yeah I
[1:13:29] miss this part brother Graham said the
[1:13:31] Roman Catholic Church will never repent
[1:13:33] he said not once has she ever apologized
[1:13:36] and said she was wrong for her mass
[1:13:37] murders and she won't either and no
[1:13:40] matter how mellow and sweet she appears
[1:13:42] at this particular time she will get
[1:13:45] rise up to kill for murder lies in her
[1:13:48] evil and unrepentant heart it's hard to
[1:13:51] imagine right now Church I mean I don't
[1:13:53] think you can understand it's hard for
[1:13:54] me to imagine Pope Francis or someone
[1:13:57] like him saying okay we're going to kill
[1:13:59] people now because he seems so gentle
[1:14:02] that's about the RAM said he seems so
[1:14:05] mellow right now right remember the
[1:14:09] first year he was poked remember he was
[1:14:11] Time magazine's Person of the Year
[1:14:12] like that's worldwide the most wonderful
[1:14:16] person of the year was the Pope because
[1:14:18] he saw a so happy he so he's so nice to
[1:14:22] people but brother I've said but at some
[1:14:25] point that Meletus will turn to anger
[1:14:28] right you know it's hard to imagine that
[1:14:31] but because they're off on the word
[1:14:33] because he said oh I can't preach again
[1:14:35] Who am I to judge homosexual well you're
[1:14:37] a preacher you're supposed to be able to
[1:14:38] judge that you're supposed to tell you
[1:14:40] tell them what the Bible judges about
[1:14:42] homosexuality I'm not judging I don't
[1:14:44] know where they'll go I don't know if
[1:14:45] there are better or not but the Bible
[1:14:47] judges you and said this is wrong if you
[1:14:49] don't repent you'll you can't escape
[1:14:51] death
[1:14:52] you'll die the second death because
[1:14:54] you're the Bhama nations but see it's
[1:14:57] hard to remember that but we're going to
[1:14:58] preach on Sunday night on Daniel 11 and
[1:15:00] Daniel 11 said that Antiochus memories
[1:15:05] from agree she's the Grecian Empire he's
[1:15:08] the one that was a type of the
[1:15:09] Antichrist the Bible said he came in by
[1:15:12] flatteries
[1:15:13] in other words really nice really sweet
[1:15:16] really wonderful just a nice guy nicest
[1:15:19] guy you want to meet
[1:15:20] that's how Antiochus came in and that's
[1:15:23] how the Antichrist is going to come in
[1:15:25] program said that's a tight or a shadow
[1:15:28] of the Antichrist in Daniel 11 it's
[1:15:31] Danny 1121 let's read that we got the
[1:15:33] time tonight I don't have two more
[1:15:35] slides I just met some paragraphs to me
[1:15:37] we're going to preach us on Sunday night
[1:15:39] Lord much I'm not the center night
[1:15:40] between our church Sunday night so maybe
[1:15:42] next Wednesday yeah that's right just
[1:15:46] one service Sunday yeah I got by the
[1:15:48] time is scheduled to come out and I have
[1:15:51] a well they can text me back I still got
[1:15:53] to get back and have let him know he's
[1:15:56] going to come they all look at the
[1:15:58] killer I just I was busy today
[1:16:00] he just texted Monday Daniel 11 21 now
[1:16:04] hadn't read yet 11:21 sir and in his
[1:16:09] estate should stand up a vile person to
[1:16:12] whom they shall not give the honor of
[1:16:14] the kingdom but he shall come in
[1:16:16] peaceably obtained the kingdom my
[1:16:18] flatters thank you that's strange
[1:16:21] he's called vile but yet he's so full of
[1:16:24] peace he's so kind and compliments
[1:16:27] everybody oh my goodness see how sitting
[1:16:31] good hi didn't saying it actually really
[1:16:33] really nice right you got to be careful
[1:16:36] you careful give it give people time
[1:16:38] that's why the Bible said lay hands on
[1:16:40] no man suddenly right don't worry day to
[1:16:44] day and real fast don't work there Dana
[1:16:46] brother for this is that give it time so
[1:16:49] they can show their true colors let some
[1:16:51] trials come right let's see what
[1:16:54] everybody's made up praise the Lord
[1:16:55] because that's what happened right here
[1:16:57] oh he's so peacefully so gentle
[1:17:00] oh my you're gentle he's such a fine
[1:17:02] person but the Bible said his heart was
[1:17:05] vile now verse 3232 wickedly against the
[1:17:14] Covenant shoddy corrupt by flattery
[1:17:17] other people
[1:17:18] God shall be strong then so see how
[1:17:23] Louie see who's gonna crush he's going
[1:17:25] to krump everybody that was isn't the
[1:17:27] Jews because it's the people that are
[1:17:29] against the Covenant so somehow the Pope
[1:17:31] is gonna be able to get Saudi Arabia
[1:17:33] Iran maybe North Korea he's got to get
[1:17:37] all nations behind him I was going to
[1:17:39] seize all nations he's going to do it by
[1:17:42] flatteries by being real mellow real
[1:17:46] kind
[1:17:49] let's see behind that is a vile person
[1:17:51] so see we got it when we're kind we got
[1:17:54] to be kind because we love our names
[1:17:55] amen we have to love our enemies and do
[1:17:58] good to those that even do evil to us
[1:18:01] all right now I think I'm getting to the
[1:18:03] close here yeah just got three more
[1:18:05] slides
[1:18:06] can you bear that three one I got em
[1:18:08] already ten then we're minutes by God's
[1:18:10] grace okay page 232 I read that page 233
[1:18:16] okay that's where I'm at right now okay
[1:18:18] here we are now it's said here that this
[1:18:25] had children
[1:18:27] now what were they they were daughters
[1:18:29] for they were churches just like her
[1:18:32] that's what I show people to on the
[1:18:35] videos if we can find out who the mother
[1:18:37] is that we can prove she's got daughters
[1:18:39] we have to first prove who the mothers
[1:18:41] sits on seven hills where scarlet red
[1:18:43] purple all these things you can riches
[1:18:46] money as influence over every nation
[1:18:48] it's out of the Roman Catholic Church if
[1:18:50] you can prove that then you can easily
[1:18:52] prove who this daughters are because the
[1:18:54] Lutheran Church came out of the Catholic
[1:18:56] right the Methodists and Zwingli and all
[1:19:00] these brother Church of the Brethren
[1:19:01] they all came out of one another
[1:19:04] Danette now here is what I'm going to
[1:19:08] close with Loretta said now here is a
[1:19:10] very interesting point just about a AB
[1:19:15] had a daughter this is a good time that
[1:19:19] daughter married
[1:19:20] Jago r am the son of Jehoshaphat in
[1:19:24] second Kings a 16 it says jo-jo ramp
[1:19:30] walked in the ways of
[1:19:32] is father of all that beautiful as far
[1:19:35] as the beautiful type and sad it
[1:19:37] happened but it's beautiful tight for us
[1:19:39] to see today Jo Ram brought god-fearing
[1:19:44] and God worshipping Judah into idolatry
[1:19:47] that's exactly what all these daughter
[1:19:50] churches have done even eyes as I
[1:19:52] pointed out to you so let me back up
[1:19:54] there a little bit a having Jezebel were
[1:20:00] not of Judah they are of northern Israel
[1:20:03] so you remember huh remember how many
[1:20:05] tribes northern Israel had at ten tribes
[1:20:10] it was ten tribes and then Judah was one
[1:20:13] drive all by itself and in the Levites
[1:20:15] so I was like ten versus one the
[1:20:19] northern tribe at northern group at ten
[1:20:20] tribes Judah had one so Satan came in
[1:20:24] two through Jezebel into the northern
[1:20:26] kingdom right those ten tribes but he
[1:20:28] wasn't satisfied because it Judah had
[1:20:31] had some good Kings they had Hezekiah
[1:20:33] Josiah Jehoshaphat so Satan wasn't
[1:20:36] satisfied with just the northern kingdom
[1:20:38] he's got to have every king and he's not
[1:20:41] satisfied with some churches he wants
[1:20:42] every church but we will withstand him
[1:20:45] by God's grace and all the churches
[1:20:46] without the message of the hour will
[1:20:48] withstand him and even who was murdered
[1:20:50] in churches what was tentative because
[1:20:52] their Burchard to the word so see what
[1:20:56] Satan did he wasn't happy with northern
[1:20:58] Israel he had to get JUnit as well and
[1:21:00] so how'd he do it he did it by marriage
[1:21:02] the daughter of Jezebel you know that's
[1:21:05] that's a beautiful time right there
[1:21:07] discussion the jessabelle was the mother
[1:21:10] the daughter church right her daughter
[1:21:13] went into Judah and Judah he is praise
[1:21:16] right stuff and intermingle with praise
[1:21:19] and stop the praises of God right she
[1:21:22] intermitted she intermixed idolatry in
[1:21:26] to praise and what does that cause
[1:21:27] perverting worship it's no longer seared
[1:21:30] in truth but now it's you might have the
[1:21:33] right spirit of praise but now you have
[1:21:34] Hoffs doctor now you've got idolatry
[1:21:37] because the daughter of the mother has
[1:21:40] married into the church
[1:21:41] I thought that's just a beautiful type
[1:21:43] if we can see that the mother Jezebel
[1:21:46] the daughter church's married into Judah
[1:21:49] married into the praise and it produced
[1:21:52] a an awful church we'd say AB accident
[1:21:55] Church the Nansen they start in truth
[1:21:59] and marry an organization and leave the
[1:22:01] word for tradition Creed's etc we have
[1:22:07] said now I remember
[1:22:09] let me get this across in Hebrews 13:7
[1:22:12] it says remember them which have the
[1:22:13] rule over you who's spoken to you the
[1:22:16] Word of God it is the word that rules
[1:22:18] not men I am not the one to ruin the
[1:22:21] church if the word that I'm preaching
[1:22:24] rules the trade man or brother Samuel
[1:22:26] comes in a brother Brooks it's the word
[1:22:28] that rules and if I don't keep the word
[1:22:31] then I need to step down against
[1:22:33] somebody who will keep the word praise
[1:22:35] the Lord and I see people not living the
[1:22:38] word I've got to take the word to that
[1:22:39] I'm duty bound they voted me in to be a
[1:22:43] watcher over their souls but really when
[1:22:45] people are Baxton they don't want you to
[1:22:47] tell but I got to tell them anyway right
[1:22:51] they voted for me they believe me to be
[1:22:54] a fan of God a shepherd but when
[1:22:56] someone's back said they don't want to
[1:22:58] know they're wrong
[1:22:59] but I've got to tell them anyway man
[1:23:01] right I've got to be sensitive when I'm
[1:23:04] wrong so he comes tell me I get a little
[1:23:06] back slid then I got to be able to
[1:23:08] accept that too because everybody the
[1:23:10] brand rather preach with a critical
[1:23:11] spirit remember we talked about that he
[1:23:13] said go to the ballclub even though he
[1:23:15] was in the right condition he stood to
[1:23:16] go and God was the Blessed image Kirsten
[1:23:18] got us a blessed gift but everybody
[1:23:22] needs shepherding by the grace of God
[1:23:24] everyone needs a shufflin nobody needs
[1:23:27] correction now man a husband is heaven
[1:23:32] I'm sorry now man as a husband is head
[1:23:35] of the woman he rules her but the church
[1:23:37] is a woman - and her ruler is the word
[1:23:39] Jesus is the word if she rejects the
[1:23:42] word and takes any other headship she's
[1:23:44] an adulteress now you naming one church
[1:23:47] hasn't given up on the word for
[1:23:49] tradition the Creed's
[1:23:50] they are all adulteresses like mother
[1:23:52] like daughter
[1:23:53] let's
[1:23:54] your feet here I want to show that he
[1:23:55] closes these two quotes I got thing I
[1:23:57] have two quotes for you or too close to
[1:23:59] this and then I want to just say a
[1:24:00] prayer for our friends and family who
[1:24:02] are in denominations because if they
[1:24:05] don't come out of that they will go to
[1:24:06] hell and if they don't come out and that
[1:24:10] just breaks my heart
[1:24:11] think about my mother and my brother we
[1:24:15] guys kind of pray you got to just
[1:24:16] believe in pray like program sets apply
[1:24:18] your faith for your salvation to them in
[1:24:21] other words I know I'm saved
[1:24:22] they're going to be saying - we got to
[1:24:25] do that by God's grace now you remember
[1:24:26] this quote from adroit 110 times
[1:24:28] remember this well Graham said it's
[1:24:30] predicted that they're going to do it
[1:24:31] and they're going to do it for thus says
[1:24:33] the Lord they're going to do it you
[1:24:34] think that nominations over break up
[1:24:36] their denomination come back to the word
[1:24:39] it's thus saith the Lord
[1:24:41] they won't now here's the part against
[1:24:44] me will they go into the Antichrist
[1:24:46] exactly it's thus said the Lord they
[1:24:51] will isn't that striking think about I
[1:24:54] know you have family and denominations I
[1:24:56] have family denominations and I try to
[1:25:00] tell on your family members couple years
[1:25:01] ago I before they made certain decisions
[1:25:04] I said you have to pray that that church
[1:25:08] gets a revival and comes back to the
[1:25:11] word if not they're going into the
[1:25:14] anti-crisis and then they said they
[1:25:15] would and last time I checked the person
[1:25:18] told me they hadn't come out yet I said
[1:25:19] what are you going to come out and they
[1:25:22] said I'm just going to keep praying I
[1:25:23] said okay but I've warned that
[1:25:25] individual I said if you don't come out
[1:25:27] of there and they don't come out of the
[1:25:29] Creed's they will become an antichrist
[1:25:31] system they will take the mark of the
[1:25:34] beast why is Munny simple they just let
[1:25:39] me just say if every my turns into they
[1:25:41] just go to my old church my whole
[1:25:42] denomination Church just another brand
[1:25:44] new big Church and I know your family
[1:25:48] member that we talked about they built a
[1:25:50] new church right and so who would want
[1:25:54] to give that up they just put thousands
[1:25:55] if not a million who know how much it
[1:25:58] cost
[1:25:59] they put all their hardware money now
[1:26:01] what church is going to say well you
[1:26:04] know we've got to keep the church or
[1:26:07] got it Oh are we go we gotta stop you
[1:26:09] against the Pope we got to extend
[1:26:11] against the Pope what are they gonna do
[1:26:12] there is well he's a nice guy he's
[1:26:15] flattering us you canif latter pentecost
[1:26:19] nib my family Christian Missionary
[1:26:23] Alliance
[1:26:24] he's gonna flatter all of them right and
[1:26:28] it's not just maybe it's thus saith the
[1:26:31] Lord because the daughters are cast into
[1:26:35] a bed the Bible said by the Rams that
[1:26:37] that bed is the Great Tribulation Period
[1:26:39] well that's what the Bible says it is so
[1:26:42] see does that put a burden on our hearts
[1:26:43] that's why I think this see that's why
[1:26:45] this is important it's I know just teach
[1:26:48] in terms of Church ages teaching but
[1:26:50] this makes us one to realize why our
[1:26:52] family members are in the churches of
[1:26:55] Jezebel's daughters so we were living in
[1:26:59] Elijah's day our family would be done at
[1:27:02] the house of ale but yet they think it's
[1:27:04] the house of God who's going to pray
[1:27:07] who's going to talk to them asking us we
[1:27:10] have to we have to be those who will not
[1:27:12] bow the knee to denominational edge or
[1:27:16] denominational pressure that's why so
[1:27:19] appreciated amen and each more abuses
[1:27:22] even though the view of the family
[1:27:24] pressure we're going to kick you out and
[1:27:25] we're going to cut you off of all this
[1:27:27] money or we want to part you we won't
[1:27:28] love you that's fine I'd rather have the
[1:27:32] love of Jesus than anything else I'll be
[1:27:35] right with God and right with you and
[1:27:37] that is real love jesus said those and
[1:27:41] your own house will be your enemy's
[1:27:44] right he said I didn't come to bring the
[1:27:47] peace on the earth like Antichrist gonna
[1:27:48] bring peace and flatteries I came to
[1:27:50] bring a sword now he gets us individual
[1:27:53] peace I'm not the son karma say is going
[1:27:55] to bring worldwide false peace but then
[1:27:58] sudden destruction comes upon them
[1:28:00] because those prophets will start
[1:28:02] blowing those trumpets and one after
[1:28:04] another all the structures that we
[1:28:05] interrupt in nature why because they
[1:28:08] love the the filthiness of fornications
[1:28:11] they love their idolatry more than the
[1:28:13] Word of God
[1:28:14] god help us to love God's Word more and
[1:28:16] more all the time do you believe that
[1:28:19] that's us
[1:28:21] say it the Lord Jesus my my family the
[1:28:26] denomination they belong to will go in
[1:28:28] the mark of the beast because of money
[1:28:33] here's the last - one remind you you
[1:28:36] have to pray for our family because
[1:28:38] they're in the Jezebel's daughter
[1:28:39] systems and they cannot hear the voice
[1:28:43] of God because our register you last
[1:28:45] week God's voice is not there they can't
[1:28:48] hear God's voice
[1:28:49] we are God's voice to them the Rhenish
[1:28:53] today we run God's voice to my mom I'm
[1:28:55] God's voice to my brothers I am I've got
[1:28:59] to reach out to them more I reach out
[1:29:01] before it has been many years you know I
[1:29:03] get to reach out again I got I'll reach
[1:29:05] out to the family numbers too difficult
[1:29:07] I reach out to them again yes sir the
[1:29:10] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:29:11] God so when they go to church they can't
[1:29:12] hear from God
[1:29:14] it's it's own mouthpiece so God is
[1:29:18] turning on her God has already turned on
[1:29:19] all those organizations who can found
[1:29:21] her through the Prophet the bride but
[1:29:23] the voice of God will be in her that's
[1:29:26] what the Bible said the sphere and the
[1:29:27] bride say come
[1:29:28] I'm going to close right here I think
[1:29:30] that's it now kind of good switch over
[1:29:32] there you enjoyed side by God's grace I
[1:29:35] know a lot of you and I hope you can see
[1:29:37] that especially their faithful Saints
[1:29:38] here I hope that was good for you by
[1:29:40] God's grace but I hope you can see how
[1:29:43] this is so important for our date right
[1:29:45] now this was you know this was a
[1:29:48] thousand years ago but yet it's still
[1:29:49] applicable right now because the
[1:29:51] mother's children her daughters are
[1:29:54] still have a grip on our family and
[1:29:56] friends my you said I have many friends
[1:29:58] the nominations I don't want to see me
[1:30:00] lost they like the world unity they
[1:30:03] liked all this Pope stuff and we need
[1:30:05] God's grace to be able to tell them and
[1:30:07] warn them it's wrong I often warn people
[1:30:10] in our church but because I focused on
[1:30:13] pastor like I was just focused on our
[1:30:15] church I oftentimes forget to warn
[1:30:17] people outside the churches so can we
[1:30:19] just pray for that tonight that God will
[1:30:21] give us the grace to warn our family
[1:30:23] members to warn our friends and also
[1:30:27] then we can see if any idolatry or
[1:30:30] fornication slips into the church how
[1:30:32] about that that's grace

[1:30:54] that you gave a type of Ahab Jezebel
[1:30:58] Elijah and then Jezebel had daughters
[1:31:01] and had a daughter that married in Judah
[1:31:04] and corrupted the praise of God had
[1:31:06] cooked in all the worship of God the of
[1:31:09] the very tribe that was actually right
[1:31:11] with you and even perverted those who
[1:31:13] were right with you and or we see that
[1:31:15] repeated today we've had a a hat and a
[1:31:18] president we've had a Jezebel the Roman
[1:31:21] Catholic Church we've had an Elijah
[1:31:23] brother venom but now it's the daughter
[1:31:27] of Jezebel it's the mother is the
[1:31:30] daughters of the mother that are
[1:31:33] perverting Judah that are perverting
[1:31:35] even what seemingly were good churches
