your own way Lord God lead us with your nail scarred head we right in Jesus Christ name Church said Amen let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go to Revelation 17 like to do part 4 on revelation 17 and 18 revelation 17 I like to start at verse 8 Lord willing tonight revelation 17 verse 8 revelation 17 verse 8 last time we we kind of had our text in verse 7 where John had great admiration about this beautiful woman and we saw what a beautiful place the Vatican is naturally but spiritually if you could look at it you would see a cage of unclean and hateful bird 'he's my revelation 17 verse 8 I like to finish chapter 7 tonight and begin 18 and if we have time I like to look at the the Bible says you can take I'm sorry Oh buying and selling will only be accomplished through one of three ways I like to get to that the mark the name or the number of his name I'd like to get to that Lord willing if I could tonight so we'll see what the Holy Spirit has for us here so revelation 17 verse 8 if you're there say Amen I'll read 17 I'll read 17 8 I'll just read that one without just be our text here tonight verse 8 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is amen may God as busing redeem his word he may be seated there praise God so we like to look look at verse eight we'll start there we'll start picking up here and Lord willing we'll get to these thoughts tonight I'd like to get to now verse eight speaks of a beast that comes out of the bottomless pit now if you know your Bible real well especially revelation the Beast can stand for a few things it can stand for the Antichrist the person of the Pope the future Pope rather it can also stand brother Hampson the beast is Rome so the evil spirit of Rome or the Antichrist spirit and so we see in verse eight after John admires this woman and look at a great admiration we see that a beast he sees a beast that was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is so this scripture makes it seem like that beast is there in perdition or on the bottomless pit and will come up so of course this could have a few meetings I'm not going to nail this down to one particular but we know Satan during the thousand year millennial reign he gets thrown down to the bottomless pit so this could represent Satan or it could represent the spirit of Satan that will anoint the Antichrist later well one thing's for sure when it comes to the beast or the spirit of Rome all the earth is going to wonder after this beast and kind of admire this beast unless their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen what a blessing Church to know tonight Alleluia it gives you a great encouragement and a great proof that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life if you can recognize the beast the Spirit of Rome and if you can see it working you know through ancient Rome and now it's in papal Rome and now it's in the United States government and religion if you can see that and you don't wonder after and you don't admire and you don't think it's a good thing that's good proof that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life a my head because we see the same thing in revelation 13 if you got your Bible revelation 13:8 collec Hebrews 13:8 revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world praise God so God has a book with names on it that was in heaven before earth was founded praise God amen and Jesus Christ was slain God's plan in his mind before the earth was already founded amen hallelujah which is striking it's just it goes back to these great deep thoughts God is giving us insight into his foreknowledge praise God because mother Adam tells us that's the order of how God did things he started with foreknowledge and then he called and then he predestinated Amen hallelujah so God first had to have foreknowledge what kind of seed we'd be would we be a believer or unbeliever and because of that God can't force you to go to heaven a house of God has to give you the free choice and God foresaw and because he foresaw he could write that book praise God amen and put your name your your name my name on the Lamb's Book of Life they met he said because God knew we'd love him amen hallelujah and then he could call us and then he could predestinate us amen but bro Graham said he didn't say well I just choose you and I don't I don't like you so I won't choose you I like them he said he couldn't do that and be just but he had to have for now Jannah for know what you would choose I always think on that because sometimes people you know I make us sound like we have no choice at all but you can't have that because then there's no free more agency brother man said whenever God plays Adam and Eve on God had to do the same thing for everybody amen and Adam and Eve were on free more agency right and because they're the free choice if you do this you do that if you do this this will happen and because they had free more see you have to remain on free more agency and thank God with free Boise we choose to love Jesus Christ tonight amen hey Laurie no one's forcing me to do it no one's pressuring me to do it but I feel I feel burden to it yes but it's the burden of the Holy Spirit amen it's not a burden of a denomination or a man it's a burden from God Almighty amen sorry a little in my pocket there now what a now look at that just from over the Beast that was is not so at this point when John wrote it this beast wasn't because it's in the bottomless pit and yet is so it still exists it was on the earth it's not right now but it still exists so it looks like this spirit of Satan here to anoint either the full spirit of Rome or the Pope I got just that is my thought now verse 9 and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads of the seven mountains on which the woman sitteth that was one of the eleven proofs that Mystery Babylon is the Roman Catholic Church because ancient Rome sat on seven hills and you can just zoom in to Apple maps or Google Maps and you can see those seven hills and any time you want to do that verse 10 now and there are seven kings five or fall and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space now I don't understand verse 10 so I'm not going to try to interpret it verse 11 and the Beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition now that makes it sounds like going in perdition is the same a thing they said in verse eight so that makes it look like it's an eighth Pope but again I don't know I'm not for sure because they both go into perdition the Beast and verse 8 goes into perdition and now this beast in verse 11 goes into perdition and it's the last one verse 12 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings which have not received no Kingdom as yet so when John sees us the horns represent Kings that that don't even manifest for when he saw it took two thousand years later so the Beast has ten horns but they don't even manifest until the Tribulation period he they have no Kingdom yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast nine the band said those are those are tyrants first 13 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful amen look at that it already jumps ahead to the Battle of Armageddon how do I know yeah so in chapter 17 we jump before we jump way back before even the church earth begin the church ages then we jump back to about a hundred 96 ad and then we hop forward 2,000 years to the Battle of Armageddon and notice it's still causing the Lamb God so wants us to always appreciate the Lamb of God in other words God never wants us to forget the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is let's remember how do we get lost how do we get here the lamb amen it'll never be why look who I am I'm the bride I'm some big somebody no the bible keeps reminding us it's the lamb it's the lamb you're following the lamb amen god save you by Passover lamb amen so see he constantly reminding us the land look he the Beast has got this big huge beast by the air this massive beast with a leopard and bear he's going to make war against a little lamb but the lamb is greater amen the Lambs eternal hallelujah this man's a mighty Conqueror he conquered through its broad Amen the natural mind looking at it would look at the Vatican and ten ten ten Kings or ten tyrants and you think man these guys are so powerful they got military weapons and tanks and guns and battleships and submarines and they're going to fight against al five-foot-two Messiah a 5 foot 2 men but the Bible said this just ain't a normal lamp this is the king of kings amen this is the Lord of lords amen and the lamb shopper do you know what it is God always hides and simplicity amen oh my and I like that you know a verse 14 I like that what it was what is Jesus scholars church then that are with him are called oh the called see first your your first it's for knowledge then you're called or elected that word means the same if you look it up you're calling an election it's the same thing so he said the wolves that are with the lamb are the called the elected and the chosen and the faithful see we have something to do we have to be faithful and we can do it the Bible said by giving all diligence we can be faithful to God so we got to give all of our human effort praise God hey man now verse 15 and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's and multitudes and nations and tongues and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the Beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire man so they give their power to the Beast for one hour but and then of course they they hate the mother harlot later and destroy her says actually chapter 18 as well verse 7 17 for God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will and look at this these evil Kings can't escape the will of God amen right just like fellow bill couldn't escape God's will because God knew Pharaoh wouldn't love him so the Bible said in Romans 9 that I chose Pharaoh that I might show my power in him amen because God knew he just hardened his heart hardness our God knew he never repent so God said he's a vessel he's a vessel fit for Wrath and destruction so I can use him to show my power amen amen same thing here I love this I love this because even the sinners even the Beast worshipers can't escape the will of God so you and I won't escape the will of God will obey the will of God amen it's not even realizing it but they're fulfilling God's will by destroying the mother harlot amen and we're fulfilling God's will by overcome amen Larry see we both fulfill it Laurie see put it in their hearts how did you why did you have the will of God in your heart to come to church tonight because God put it there God put it there God puts in their heart and God put it in your heart to do his will amen and to agree and I look at it back to these tyrants here to agree and to give their Kingdom unto the Beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled oh my see everybody's gonna fulfill God's will right his predestinated plan see because he had foreknowledge you could plan well these to be the enemies these will be the righteous well god bless sister Naomi good to see you phrase the Lord we missed you Lord bless you I didn't know you're here praise the Lord see until the will the words of God shall be fulfilled so it's our choice which words you want to fulfill I want to fulfill the words that are faithful called holy I want to be with that bunch of believers amen that's the will of God because remember Matthew seven says only those who do the will of God many will say Lord Lord but shall not enter the kingdom of God but only those who do the will of my father amen we must do the will of God for our generation just like David verse 18 and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth and we've been looking at that the last few weeks I think everybody's convinced on that I think we saw last time how pope john paul ii he was credited with ending the cold war between Soviet Union United States he's given credit for that a pope because you can't war against the kings of the earth or the Kings can't war against that guy right because he has spiritual influence over them that's right mine now let me look at my notes here I want to hit a few things here okay now let's go you're 18 here I'll bet you want to get to this the buying and selling here verse 18 and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory see woman angels never a her glory it's always his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for some nations their right scene if you're paying attention for some nations all nations see the Roman Catholic Church still has to get into every nation now I want to say this we went to the voice of God last year they told us that there's so many more languages that the message needs to be translated into let me say this I wouldn't be surprised if the raptures next year but I want to be surprised if the raptures not even in my lifetime either way I wouldn't be surprised because not all nations have heard the message yet and Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24 he said when the gospel shall be preached to every nation then shall the end come so I wouldn't be surprised either way but the RAM said preach like it'll be in ten years but live like it's gonna be today amen see so I want to be surprised either way and I want to be ready either way praise God amen from and so what does that mean tours alls it means is keep all the sin out of your life that's all it means don't backside on god don't get lukewarm on God live on fire Holy Ghost for life all the time amen and if you're born again you will do that just like a dove automatically cleans itself out amen it's got oil from the inside and it works its way out praise God if you're really born again you will be if you're born again you're already ready for the rapture amen because the ticket of God the tokens already in you amen I don't know yet if you're born again you'll always be ready so doesn't matter if it happens next year or a hundred years from now it doesn't matter you've already got the oil and it's cleaning from the inside amen that's why wouldn't you know you know friends say people from other churches try to influence me like all the raptures you know like last year they said all the rapture is going to be this year or the year before that they said all they're actually gonna be 2018 you know after a while just it just you know it just rushes off your shoulder yeah you just get kind of get tired of people trying to influence you now it's different if somebody stands up here and says thus saith the Lord that's different now you got a reason to prove all things you better make sure that's right or you got the lying spirit but see people just try to Endon see they're trying to use scare tactics to get the bride ready the bride doesn't need scare tactics the bride needs love to get ready right because he will appear to all those that love his appearing see love is what motivates us to get ready praise God and that's what the Holy Ghost is charity love amen the love of God so see all nations that's why I say it could be next year could be fighters could be a hundred years for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with it no matter what was fornication fornication was the false doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church she takes that in there and when she teaches her false doctrine they become idolaters and that spiritual fornication because the church is saying we're married to Christ we're married to Christ but then they're actually making love with the rich men and the merchants and the bankers is that right by silly by setting their statues and they're living their cloth linen and they're building their big buildings all these things they're actually committing spiritual fornication against Christ because Christ is the word amen see that's what there and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies now I was just thinking about this on the way here there's 22 sorry 220 mm parishes worldwide of Catholic churches there's almost a quarter million and they all got to have gold cups and they all got to have spices for incense and they all got to have linen coats and outfits what so there's God so I think the Lord is trying to help me to find out there's a big economy connected with the Vatican it you know think about I just have to provide water like just let's just use water or chairs I as a pastor I just have to provide chairs and waters for one church now think if I had 225 thousand of those that'd be some big business sir that'd be some big money and so we got to remember that so connected to the local economies these these Catholic parishes because the Vatican of course is the headquarters and they got to make sure all these parishes out there all have these materials to do their worship but it's false worship verse 4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues so one great angel says babylons fawn and then another angel says come out of her my people have might be brother branham some people probably think it is verse 5 for the sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities praise God now see that means she didn't confess her sins Amen because you and I our sins don't make it to heaven if we confess them because the accuser of the brother and Satan is there and when he goes to accuse us if we say God forgive me and really change and repent then there's no record of our sins in heaven amen because he's faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness but see she won't repent so her sins wrong to heaven and reach up to heaven but our sins are forgiven before they get to heaven hey I is God that's why it's so important if you're born again you confess it right away you make a mistake God forgive me you make you teach true somebody wrong with an accident you quickly go back and say I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that you humble yourself but see her sins reach to heaven and God remembers her iniquity but the Bible said blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute iniquity amen whose sins are forgiven whose trans passes are forgiven hallelujah now verse 6 reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill her double now isn't it striking sure just just a moment at double where's the double God says pour whatever evil she did double the punishment isn't that striking catch this the mother of harlots doubles gets double of our evil but if you remember Jesus rewards we get double the rewards the phrase God right because we we work with our gifts if God gives you 1 count what you do you double it amen God gives you 3 talents what do you do double it and get 6 God gives you 5 dance what do you do double it you got 10 taels he said I'll give you ten cities amen so you've got both got double God wants us to double God wants us to do more God wants us to multiply and be abundant amen hallelujah that means I'll double the father I'll be double the father I'll invest I'll become double the preacher I'll become double the prayer warrior about that amen I'll be double the mother that I was about that one whatever gift I'll be double of wisdom ah now we're talking about some spiritual accountability responsibility praise God double so we see that in both cases and Elijah had a double anointing of Allah and that types the church a man and the church is born the game the Holy Ghost so those people with the Holy Ghost will double their towns that God gave them oh that's fresh that wasn't in my notes I just came to me right now when I seen the double there they both at double we one double the anointing and we want to double the talents that God gave us think about a church are you a better Christian than you were last year I hope you can look back to when when you first really believe I hope you're double the Christian you are since then hey man because that's what Jesus said you had three now you got six you had five now you got ten double it amen so what's gonna take is gonna take full surrender it's gonna take a crucifixion he said take up your cross daily and follow me oh it's gonna be a compound interest it's gonna be a compound interest amen what does that mean every day right with compound interest you get interest at it every day it compiles and that's what you do choice you read your Bible every day don't you yeah don't you pray every day you pray every day read about and and after law starts compounding praise God it's not smooth to fly it starts about me amen and then things start growing and you can achieve double by God's grace oh thank you Lord but she gets double the punishment for mistreating God's bride God's people fill it to her double the angel says verse seven now look at this how much she hath glorified herself that's where we got to be careful we don't glorify brother branham or we don't glorify ourselves or we don't lift up our church see that's what watch that Catholic Church watch those denominations what they do they build these huge churches to glorify who themselves see so you got a look at the spirit behind that why did they build that huge church many times not not all the time but many times why did they do this huge thing because remember if it looks like the Catholic Church it might be the same spirit right see deliciously she glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she said in her heart I sit a queen and AM no Widow and shall see no sorrow a church that's so different than we are right now in our hearts we can say I'm the bride of Jesus Christ and we're truly married but church we whoopsy sorrow right everyone that lives godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer what persecution everyone and we looked at that a few months ago brother Graham said the hardest thing he ever went through his life was being rejected out in Arizona for three years only one person had him in to preach he said never have I had such sorrow in my life he said just reject it people that you thought were your friends rejecting you people mocking you make fun of you isolate you I don't want nothing to do with you and the Bible said see she wants to have no sorrows she wants an easy life but the Christian attitude is Lord I'll take up my cross daily I'll follow you whatever comes comes I know persecution is coming give me grace to go through it praise God amen a church it may be like Joe Joe cried out said God show me God put me on a scale so I know what have I done wrong and God never told him what he did wrong God never told him why he was tested him in fact there was I think there were 66 questions God asked him the first one was where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth he went back and started with creation where were you and I made the foundation of Jobe speak if you know what I'm talking about and Jobe said I repent you're greater God you're greater than I thought I repent in dust and ashes amen God never told him why he did this he sometimes hurts God's not going to answer your prayer he's not gonna answer he's not gonna tell you all things but as long as you're humble a man as long as you know God's great as long as you worship is you'll figure it out one day praise God but remember that's that white stone that white stone with the words written on the inside but then said that's the mystery that Jesus is going to let us know all of our unanswered questions all throughout eternity hey the reward of the white stone that mystery inside is that Jesus will answer job's question that he didn't quite know rather they God for the reward of the white stone all these things we don't know why did this brother do that why did that church go that direction why did this happen in my life all these things we don't know we get the reward of knowing one day thank God for that oh we got a lot to look forward to an eternity we got all the time in the world so we can hear oh that's why God do that for that brother that sister and pretty soon it'll come to you then you get to ask Jesus Jesus you can you explain why this happened and he'll reveal and that's part of your reward oh it's knowing the unsearchable riches of Christ amen oh thank you Jesus see we're gonna have sorrow but this woman says oh it's all about me it's all about my church I don't mind like I have any problems and she lives deliciously verse 8 therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire out who judges her you of God till they exalt is so far out there and she's done so much evil remember she does the same thing Jezebel did remember that the murders right they murdered her in the Inquisition the Crusades sexual sins right the Bible said Jezebel was guilty of whoredoms so who knows what kind of evils sexual sin she did I forget the third one but there was three of those there where Jezebel the natural Jezebel and the spiritual Jezebel did the same exact thing let me look it up real quick I got it right I got it right here in front of me yeah oh yeah idolatry so sex death and idolatry or murder and adultery so Jezebel did all three things the Roman Catholic Church does the same thing my and so God said death and mourning and famine for strong as the Lord God who judges her amen verse 9 now leave this and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning this is going to be some huge huge burning brother branham said thus saith the lord though the russian government will drop a hydrogen bomb of some sort on the vatican right so this is this is part of the destruction in one hour hydrogen atomic bombs are going to hit the Vatican and all the kings of the earth committed publication are gonna see that smoke rising up and the Bible said that they'll lament her when they see her smoke of her burning verse 10 standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city Babylon that mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment scum and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore to see how these merchants must be selling into the Catholic Church than the Catholic churches and selling them out to the their churches that's that's the best I can see right now that's what it looks like now here it actually tells you in verse 12 the merchandise of gold and of silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and pure purple and silk and scarlet and all fine and thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all matters a most precious wood in a brass that of iron and marble and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots now they're gonna send slaves they got a lot of sex slaves in their churches and souls of men right see that's where we told you the the denominational churches many of them just see their church members as money that's they're pretty nice right they see a person the seat oh you know they're now they are given now we're gonna make more money Athena says God sheep is instead of see them as sick people that need to be healed in the in the end right with the innkeeper who had two prints from Jesus instead of seeing them as Lambs instead of seeing them as sheep they see them as dollar bills amen because that's their merchandise the souls of men they make merchandise of the souls of men they're just a number to them how many newcomers do we have this year how many more seats do we need all these things it's merchandise to them verse 14 and the fruits that I sold losses after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing now that's what I want to look up I want to look up on Google I want to look at the Vatican's impact on Italy's economy that's what I want to look up brother because if atomic bomb explodes it over the Vatican you won't be able to see that all around the world but you'll see it for hundreds of miles no doubt and so a lot of their economic contacts will be able to see that smoke and that fire so I'd like to know the Vatican's impact on the economy of Italy and then also the neighboring European countries because the Bible said they'll see it the ones that got rich through the Vatican they'll see it and they'll royal and no more there goes my money there goes my retirement who cares heavens our retirement amen your body is your glorified body that's your real retirement that's Rito no retirement Haven that's your inheritance hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is just a down payment on that inheritance amen I know yeah but their soul goes well because who cares on the heaven where the streets are paved with gold amen the ass for the payment is sparing gold amen you can see through the gold I wonder what's underneath the ground there I wonder what they see when they look through the payment of the transparent gold what do they see merci now they're all concerned about their merchandise Oh on my cinnamon all my gold all my precious jewels Oh what's gonna happen to all my money they're more concerned about that in the Lamb of God Oh see they just want an easy life right there dainty they're goodly things they want a delicious life they want a glorified life they want to glorify themselves now let's go down to verse 17 I believe we left left there well I know let's go to 15 not the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and alas saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen now see that's what those priests all wear right there were that beautiful fine linen I got different colors for different seasons we don't went over that a few weeks ago and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls for in one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and the ships and sailors and as many as trade by his City stood afar off I'd like to see that like this know what routes they have with ematic in their to saying what city is like under this great city and they cast dust upon their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her coastlines for in one hour she's made desolate see they should have been weeping and wailing over the sins done in the city a man ha ha ha that's what the board does amen the bride is marked because she's sighs and cries for all the abominations done in the city amen but instead she was crying about her bank account and her money more than crying to verse to be safe see the Bible said wherever you set your affections on we should set them on things above not upon the things of the earth so this proves that mine is only on fine linen beautiful clothes gold and pearls and riches and when they see that destroyed they cry but all mine their own heaven things and when we see people fall to church it makes us cry amen glory holiday or when we see us a little child give their heart to Jesus and baptize them in the name of Lord Jesus Christ it makes us cry tears of joy because that's the eternal reward Amen that's what sets our that's what we set our affections on Alleluia so see your emotions are tied to whatever you set your affections on your thoughts write your feelings and so see our feelings must be on loving God worshiping God and also having a burden for people to be saved alright now I hope you're getting the picture just reading this and I'm just preaching off my notes here here verse 20 rejoice over her now look what it says rejoice over her thou heaven 9 now picture that I don't know about you but when I've seen the videos and the pictures of when Hiroshima and Nagasaki got bombed in World War two I don't rejoice over that I mean I'm glad I'm glad we won the war and you know Germany and Japan didn't take over the world I'm glad about that but I can't rejoice over that just because I'm a human and I see a hundred thousands of people killed instantly by that was atomic bombs thousands how many was it you America you remember how many ways was it like a hundred thousand both cities combined and so like you know you and I know and our humanity we don't rejoice over that but look at heaven look what heaven feels when that bomb that Russian bomb drops on the Vatican the Bible said rejoice Oh her thou heaven any holy prophet apostles and prophets for God hath avenged you on her by this is a whole different kind of emotion right this is this is a heavenly this is a perfect love right this is now the human compassion this is a divine love because we're we have human compassion you know we want to see everybody save we want to see everybody healed you know we want to see everybody helped and we want to see everybody get some kind of help but once they got the new bodies in heaven and they're up in heaven they know exactly what spirits are working on every Church right and then when judgment comes upon this they greatly rejoice because God has taken a revenge right my goodness verse 21 and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it in the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all Amen this city's got the expiration date Amen it's gonna have an ending day praise God they they call themselves the Eternal City but that's blessed amen we saw that like a few weeks ago that's one of the three fold blasphemy there are ninety turn there's only one eternal city and that's your mother the New Jerusalem amen that's your motherland your homeland the New Jerusalem so she has an ending point verse 22 and Harper's and musicians in the Pipers and the trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found anymore in thee and the millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee so see it sounds like all these Harper's and all this beautiful music right that if you go to any Catholic Church where they got beautiful music organs and pipes and it sounds so gorgeous but heavens rejoicing that all that false worship is now destroyed amen because Jesus said true worship is in spirit and in truth they may no matter how beautiful it sounds it was not according to the truth it the file polluted religion amen that's right so heaven rejoices I mean no more harping no little pipe organs nothing wrong with the pipe organ but it's the spirit behind it praise God this bierbaum is let's glorify ourselves let's have no suffering let's we're the queen of heaven work we know we pray our mother Mary that's the spirit behind it and that's a wrong spirit so God rejoices over that all the prophets rejoice when that gets destroyed because it's demonic worship verse 23 and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom have the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth now that's what's striking right there so I've heard this before too many of the mote richest men in the world are Roman Catholic but I got to search it out I don't know for sure like I can't prove it like I can say well here's the website that's what I need to find so you find one give it to me so the great man of the earth were merchants that soul into the Roman Catholic Church for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived so America is gonna be deceived by the Roman Catholic Church Japan Russia Iran right Iran North Korea our enemy right Iran our enemy they're all gonna be deceived by this Antichrist verse 24 and her was found the blood of the prophets and of saints and of Allah this is striking Church all that were slain upon the earth all my brother William that's quite a it's quite a statement right there all that we're saying upon the earth the punishment for that all goes back to the Vatican now that's that's striking I think of all the people that died thousands die every day millions die every year the blood of all those that died unjustly goes back on the Roman Catholic Church so I don't know how that's connected but that's what the Bible says so we believe it and we want to stay a million miles away from that system well there have said that Pope and the church the Roman Catholic Church is your greatest enemy did you know that that's your greatest enemy that's not your greatest friend that's not even a good friend that's your enemy your greatest enemy because of idolatry sexual sin violence against the true bride of Jesus Christ now I got a few things before we move on to chapter 19 maybe next week now I want to I'll just I'm here let me just hit a few real quick brother branham said the mark of the beast' now let's go the mark of the beast because visa the spirit of Rome both both marks God's mark and Satan's mark bromance that our spiritual marks and they can be received today even before the Tribulation Period and he starts by saying you could receive them from the beginning like Cain was marked I don't know what physical mark he had I was guessing maybe the ears because remember the Jews that rejected it they got all in the ear maybe it was a mark on the forehead I don't know it doesn't really matter what it was but when every met winnette when men looked at him they're like oh I'm not going to kill him because of some visual mark that he had upon him but remember that mark didn't start that way the mark started in Cain's heart when God told him if you do well you'll rule over your brother and he said nonsense and he went away and he killed his brother Abel he was already marked when he left the perfect was of God because the mark of the beast is a spiritual mark when you turned out and despised and trampled on the will of God there's no other man to take except the mark of the beast now the mark make Holloman a in a computer chip or something like that or some tattoo on therefore it may culminate in that but it's not what's going to start it's gonna start as a spiritual mark because God's mark is spiritual everyman hallelujah see and God gives the mark when you obey Him because the acts 5:32 that he pulled it up acts 5:32 so see Satan's mark comes when you disobey God for the love when you cross over to the reprobate mind but God's mark is receive when you obey Him because obedience is greater than sacrifice amen see we're witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost who God have given to them that obey Him Cain couldn't obey Him brother Cain went oh man he knew the perfect will of God he wouldn't do a blood sacrifice so he walked away and he got marked spiritually he turned out and he made a sacrifice within obey obedience is greater than sacrifice amen I don't care how hard it is don't care if it's a you know pressure from your family I don't care if it's pressure from a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a father or parent or a preacher no matter what the pressure comes from always obey God's Word praise God always obey it never compromise and say well I'll do this to make up for that never cop the Bible said give no provision for the flesh make no plans to fulfill the lust of your flesh just obey and obedience the Bible said in patience you possess your soul hey man praise God obey always obey the Word of God see because at some point when Cain chose to disobey he got marked by the mark of the beast as well brother BAM tells us all she had to do was obey but he wouldn't obey and church he spent the rest of his life wasting his life wandering around like a fugitive and a vagabond that was his punishment his punish he said the punishments more than I came back and God said I'm gonna place a mark on you and you're gonna be a huge ative and a vagabond he just wonder from this church guy say like that he wanted from this church to that church to that church to that church to that state to that state to that County he just wandered around see God wants us to be solid God wants us to find a hole God wants us to be solid and sound and sane and faithful praise God amen amen it's easy to even like people it's easy to hop around you know we have all these friends nobody that's here today or anything like that but I had all these friends that they just they can never find a home they hop from that person's house and that person's house that that person something's wrong with that God wants us to be solid god wants to provide for us and if you look at their lives I've looked at people's lives is because they don't obey the Word of God see that's a like Caine the Bible said you're a wandering star the Bible said in Jude I just wonder here wonder there and not only do they physically wander by there and they wonder well wonder if I'm born again I wonder if the message is right I wondered brother branham's the prophet right they just wonder all these things instead of saying God open up my heart and drop down your revelation amen because the Bible said all that ask receive amen that's all it takes just ask and they'll open it to you you'll give it beauty we just got to ask God for it see all these vagabond canes these Wanderers and fugitives they just want to wander around and go every place and do everything like that they have no accountability first of all and they become their own pastor right they become their own headship that's what Cain Cain was just gonna wander around and just be his own pastor but God said why don't you be the pastor isn't that what basically what he said he said you will rule over your brother if you just do it God offered him a position as a preacher as a ruler just like Judas but never said he had the highest calling in the Bible an apostle there both offer the highest place but they'd rather wander around and be a fugitive vagabond wrapped and simply obeying God's Word I don't not you but let's just obey God's Word let's just obey God if God requires blood let's give them blood if God requires the born-again experience then let's wait at this altar or wait there at your chair until you're born again praise God hey amen just wait there until your until you know I passed from death unto life I'm not the same person I was I'm born again hallelujah hey man let's just do it God's Way let's not take a substitute let's not warn there from place to place let's be right where your God wants us to be let's be like post-eternity let's be a pillar in the house of God there it is I've been waiting for that amen that's a reward to you'll be a pillar in the house of God not a wonderer a pillar in the house of God see that's when that mark of the beast comes when he said I just want to be a vagabond I don't want to submit I don't want to submit to God I don't want to with God's way I don't want to be around my anyone who rule over my brother I don't want to take a place of position he didn't want to take God's position that God had for him in that said God had a position you will rule over your brother but he didn't even want God's position to rule over his shirt I said I got his church Oh huh see people run from responsibility program so that's why I'm God don't give people more gifts is because he can't trust them with gifts because they can't they'll run from it rather than that rather than coming up here and saying I believe in lord help me to be faithful with it they'd rather run from it and well Ram said easy called this but van said they'd rather shirk their responsibilities right they'd rather just run from it so they don't have to answer for it but listen Church your answer one way or the other you might as well just face up whatever God's called you to do whatever responsibility God's giving you you might as well just relay yourself before the Lord and say Lord Here I am used to me praise God don't run from it whatever gives you place in my life whatever you told me to do here just use me help me to be faithful with the talents you've given me but can't couldn't do that Cain said I don't want your offer God I don't need your offer I'm not gonna worship the way you want me to worship he turned it down took the mark of the beast when Cain did that he became a reprobate the word reprobate means not standing the test not approved unfit for see Cain was unfit for heaven he was unfit to serve God he didn't pass the test yes huh me no your life is a test the trial of your faith is more precious than gold the trial this is a big test Church it's a big test a big trial and what are you gonna do are you gonna over it you're gonna pass the test or fail the test we're gonna pass the test with flying colors of a sevenfold rainbow color not the one got the homosexuals are trying to rob it never belong to them in the first place it belong to God Joseph's coat of many colors amen Noah's rainbow covenant that's our covenant amen we're gonna pass it with flying covers the Covenant of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the New Covenant amen now let me find out find a place to close here got a couple minutes here let's just go back let's read Exodus 21 6 I'll just close with this thought about the market and we'll pick it up then next week Lord willing Exodus 21 6 this is the all oh that's just my that's just my thought maybe Cain had it all maybe Cain had a mark on his forehead well whatever it was they could look it right at this guy and say he's I'm not going to touch that guy but God chose the all as a mark that all the Jews could look at that I want to live in slavery he didn't have enough responsibility to take his land of his forefathers in other words he did a disrespect he he denied he didn't want the inheritance God had for him just like Cain right God had it God had a place and inheritance for Cain when he turned it down I don't want to serve you lord I'd rather wander around and do my own thing worship how in a worship I'm still mad at you God oh my god Church God is slow to anger and rich in mercy God is rich in mercy God is slow to anger and that is Master shall bring him under the judges he should also bring him to the door into the door of the post and his master shall Bors ear through with it all and he shall serve Him forever go to Deuteronomy 1517 now that was pronounced in Exodus Deuteronomy 1517 see so God even showed a mark on his own people that turned down their inheritance and refused to possess their inheritance now 15:17 is where I want to go I'm actually in gold of 16 15 16 initially used to sanity I will not go away from thee because he loveth the in thine house because he is well with thee then thou shalt taking all and thrust it through his ear under the door and he shall be thy servant forever and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise and it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou send us him away free from thee for he hath been worth a double hired servant to the inn serving these six years and the LORD thy God shall bless thee and all that I'll do us praise God I see Church we know that we know the mark in the ear represents in the in the New Testament a person that will not hear of the gospel trumpet the gospel trumpet that says you can be free from denomination you can be free from worldliness you can be free from sexual temptation and you can be free from pride hey man you can be free from arrogance you be free from greed you can be free from all these things but when they turn their ear way they don't want to hear they don't wanna listen to it anymore and they do for the last time God marks them in their ear because jesus said they have ears but they cannot hear praise God they have eyes but cannot see ears that can I hear see they fell in love with their slave master right they fell in love the sins of the world there are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God right see that's the our feet here the church what separates us as Christians what separates us from the world people should be able to look at our lives and tell we don't love the world we don't love pleasures we love the things of God our lives should be so different right lovers of God more than lovers of pleasures and if this is God's house we should love coming to God's house amen and anything related to God we should love that we should choose to obey God's Word he said few there be that find it now can you imagine let's say it let's pretend your brother or sister they got in the debt they got sold off just your neighbor's house and after the year of Jubilee comes and you say hey the gospel trumpet just blowed come on over like no I like it here I like it here and you look at them and they got these big old earrings on and yet you see them out there or maybe feeding the swine the lowest of the jobs they love slavery more than they love the responsibility of being a child of God they love being a slave to sin oh that's let's examine our hearts Church let's examine our desires to make sure we don't love the things of the world that we're not lovers of pleasures but we're lovers of God now how much you come to the piano here praise the Lord I was right on time thank the Lord let's bow here and I think I'll just take this thought here as we close slaves they choose to be slaves like Cain he chose to be a slave to his own will rather than taking the position God had for him he rejected it so he could just live how he wanted to live [Music] my I'm meditating on these thoughts of the sermon I'm gonna pray and ask the Lord to help us set our affections on things above that when we cry it'll be over spiritual things glory hallelujah and that when God asks us to take composition when God asks us to have a responsibility that will say yes Lord when God asks us to obey and not just sacrifice but obey will say praise the Lord let's pray together Church you know in your heart maybe you're even a slave to a certain attitude maybe been a slave to a certain fleshly lust or lust of the eyes are but a slave to pride how are the holy spirits deal with you let's pray tonight maybe you got your affections off the thing God made for lost souls but spray that our pleasures will be in the house of God doing the things of God we've seen how the false church glorified herself let's try to glorify Christ father in heaven we thank you Lord God for this word what a calling you give in the true church the false church wants to live an easy life doesn't want to suffer what's the glorify yourself Oh God doesn't want to take responsibility like cainy doesn't want to take the position God has but I play in Jesus Christ's name god help us to be like able help us to be true worshipers Lord none will suffer for it but yeah it'll be accepted in the eyes of God our obedience our sacrifice will be the right sacrifice it'll be an obedient sacrifice amen let our affections beyond the things of God hallelujah granted Lord Jesus or the striking to look at this false church Lord heaven rejoices over their destruction Oh God that divine nature that divine holiness Oh God so hard to understand this carnal body Lord but I believe it Lord God well God sanctifies lor urges so God that our ears hear the word of God tonight Lord and take it home with us Lord God thank you Lord and father if your people are enslaved to anything maybe just started this week maybe it's been going on for a couple weeks maybe months god forbid years Oh God that your people be free Alleluia may they hear in the gospel Trump in this sense I can be free tonight in Jesus name and it Lord God you came to set the captive free how to heal you Amen thank you Lord that every ear hear the gospel Trump and accept the freedom and not take the mark of a disobedient person Oh God let us be marked with your Holy Spirit on a Noah let us labor to enter into that rest Lord God may we follow after those things Lord these things that are eternal dear God as we set our affections on heaven so we thank you Lord God each of us search our hearts your Lord God may you be the pleasure of our lives Lord Jesus Christ amen if anyone needs prayer you're more than welcome to come we'll be happy to pray with you if anyone needs prayer at all always want to make sure that everybody knows that I will praise God let's just worship the Lord let's obey every word of God Church amen let's hear the gospel trumpet

the Lord thank you Jesus we love you Lord Jesus we set our affections on things above Lord amen let's pick it up a little bit we find many people who can understand why we are so happy and free we've crossed over Jordan to Kayden's Maryland and this is like heaven to me oh this is like heaven to me praise God yes this is heaven to me crossed over Jordan debated spelling and this is like heaven to me when we're happy oh and we are happy we sing and we shout so cold understand us you see with the spirit there's not a dot and that's what's the matter oh that's what's the matter with me place God yes that's what's the matter with me I feel with the switchover real quick I just got a real quick testimony I'd like to share before we close I don't know if I told you but I had a friend who robbed a bank years ago and he's been in prison for ten years I said in my book and he said I received your book so far it's truly an awesome book I read a chapter a day I can study it when I'm reading it able to digest the knowledge and then he says he said God truly blessed you you're using the gifts he gave you in an awesome way you're doing God's work by writing this book because it's opening my eyes a lot he's in prison he has nowhere to go he says he says I'm currently on chapter six and my whole perception of a person's appearance has been forever changed in prison what a blessing you know what the challenge is since I've been reading your book the lust he said Hayat lust of the eyes he said he said your book has taken it to another level I'm trying not to look at women anymore your book has helped me to see why it's so tough not to less in America it's because there's so much temptation everywhere not to make excuses let's see why you wrote your book now it's because society's got out of control women think they're men and men think they're women now more than ever tattoos are out of control lengths of women's skirts out of control he says man I'm out of time I just want to encourage you with that that we should always have a heart to reach out share the gospel and who knows maybe had to get in there so God could get a hold his life who knows the footsteps of the righteous for hope that encouraging that really bless my heart this week my god knows what he's doing church and I know too I can send more men I can send brother grams books in there not you I just can't have my name on has to have the church's name on it so I can send books and glory thank you Lord amen hallelujah as far as for what a prayer here is we're dismissed Lord what a what a way to end the service of a person who's in prison Lord we just talked about slaves I didn't even catch that Lord so right now Lord thank you for opening that man's eyes Lord my friend God may it making obey it Lord God now now that he's seen it order just encourage you to know that your word will not return void it'll accomplished all that it was said to do and thank you for the word we've heard tonight

see Lord God I'm gonna set our affections on things above and be free in Christ hallelujah you know you'll help us do it Lord God thank you for these lessons as we preach through your your book of
