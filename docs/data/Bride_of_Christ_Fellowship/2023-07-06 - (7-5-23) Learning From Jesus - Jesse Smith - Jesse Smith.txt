========================================

[Music] let's shout glory to God glory to God Amen one more time [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] God bless you let's take our Bibles as we stand here I'd like to go to Matthew chapter 11 tonight I just want to start maybe just a very short series I kind of mentioned this thought on Sunday I just want to call this short little series learning from Jesus you know sometimes learning can be a a negative word maybe around the message but if you actually look in the Bible learning is a good thing in the Bible praise God so we want to look at that here tonight and Trust to be a blessing to you Matthew chapter 11 verse 25. Matthew 11 25 by God's grace Matthew 11 25 praise God Hallelujah of course in context here this is the chapter where John the Baptist is in prison and he gets word or he sent he sends for word about Jesus is Jesus the Messiah so of course this is at the beginning of Jesus ministry when he first starts laboring Healing The Sick and of course after the the miracle of the wine and so forth so Matthew 11 25 I'll read 25 down to 27 then we can all read 28 and 29 and 30. we'll give you a little extra reading there tonight on this Wednesday night God's grace let me set a timer here so we can kind of manage the time Scott allows so I'll read 25 through 27. at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him let's read 28 29 and 30 together ready one two three come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light praise God let's bow our heads here for word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make anointing to God I love these words Jesus says come unto me Jesus is always inviting us to have Fellowship Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight Lord God thank you for this reading of your word thank you for the songs all the Akron Saints here and our visitors from Napoleon thank you God for this opportunity to be in your house Lord Jesus it's a joy to sing to you Lord we're saying in our hearts look what you've done Lord God you saved us right on time you've done so much for us so many reasons to praise you Lord God Hallelujah there are so many reasons to Rejoice Lord God in what you've done father take this thought here tonight Lord I just pray you to anoint me God for your purpose Lord God as I try to study on three other subjects or two other subjects here in order this is the one that seemed to have the inspiration so Lord I just pray Lord do my best to follow you you Lord I'm reporting for service Lord God reporting for Duty use me as a king and priest Lord reigning over sin and Lord interceding for the Saints Lord God each person here do the same Lord God may you give us what we have need of for this hour of our our journey our walk with you Lord God so father help us Lord God to come to you Jesus tonight Lord God we've come here physically now let us come to you spiritually Lord God help us to learn of you give you thanks and praise in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I'd like to look at the start like I said I might preach maybe two or three services on this we'll kind of see how it goes just as the inspiration allows to have a few slides here and uh you know the thought came to me we were looking at the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Jesus called it rest unto your soul your soul a soul is your the nature the deepest nature of your entire being and so that means before a person's born again uh your soul is not at rest I mean it's it's at Labor right in other words it's working to earn salvation but when the Holy Ghost comes in now the person can rest Hallelujah and then Hebrews remember Hebrews 4 shows us what that means before you're born again you're doing a lot of your own works but then the Bible says when you get the Holy Ghost and the Soul now you do the works of Christ right you do the works of God and that aligns up exactly with Ephesians 2 8-10 we're saved by grace through faith uh it's not of ourselves it's the gift of God right but then the Bible said in verse 10 we're created unto good works God created us to do something for him praise God a lot of times it deals closely with our family right raising our children and loving our husband or loving our wife whatever side we're on and raising our children to the honor and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's exactly what God wants and of course we know there's more to it than that but just a brief summary and God wants us to have the Holy Ghost in our souls so our souls so the very so when we close our our eyes at night church you know and there's all these pressure and all these we got a to-do list of our to-do lists we have all these things but we got a list of all these things that we got to try to do tomorrow when we close our eyes at night we can say thank God he saved me he filled me with the Holy Ghost I know it's going to be all right praise God no matter what happens tomorrow my soul rests in Christ Jesus praise God I know what I'm saying I know I'm right with God hallelujah because he's the he started this work he's the author of my life he's the continuer he's the finisher praise God it's just that rest and brothers I just read a quote today brother Adam said he woke up uh from this thought at 11 PM he said the whole Christian journey is about rest and he said I had nobody to preach it to he said so I woke up my wife and preached to her he said he preached till 1am that's a pretty long sermon right there 11 to 12 one so two hour sermon I bet sister Mita was really pulling on that one don't you think she got three kids you know three little ones to take care of all these scriptures about resting and and how uh you know we cease from our own Works he actually quotes Hebrews for you know in Matthew 11. he just ties these scriptures together and he says that that's the whole of the Christian life is to rest in God right to trust God and then let God work through you like remember brother Brandon said he said what is the anointing he said the anointing is supreme power but under control so it doesn't have to be loud shouting you don't have to be dancing like I like to do don't it can just be supreme power in control gives the example when Jesus in Luke chapter 4 he goes he's in the synagogue he never missed Church right he was in the church on Saturday and he walked up he picked up the scroll he read Isaiah 61 and he sat down and everybody turned to look at Jesus what are you going to say now everybody turn their necks like the the creek in the neck and looking back like a bunch of cranes or something and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and brother Ram said that was the greatest anointing on him now of course we know that anointing never left him to the Cross right because God couldn't curse his own spirit right but that that Holy power that unlimited anointing was on him that whole time sometimes he would be happy or sometimes he would be happy like in this case I thank thee God you've hid it from the wise and prudent that's sometimes sometimes we have a hard time with that don't we because we want to see the law saved but there's times when you realize you know you understand God's sovereignty God's going to save all those that are predestinated to be saved and in those moments you know when you're uh when you're thinking about God's point of view you can rejoice and say thank God I'm one of them praise God I was one that God chose to reveal it to praise God and it's hidden from the wise the wealthy and uh the famous and the popular and uh the sinful it's hidden from them because they don't want to see it and Jesus Rejoice now other times he got mad he took the rope and he beat out the money changers and he threw over their tables and said get out you don't make my house or my father's house a house of merchandise this is the House of Prayer amen and so he had this great anointing on him but what we see is that you know the anointing is following God's leadership in each moment of Our Lives Hallelujah so that way sisters when you're at home and hubby's at work whatever you can still have the anointing right on you there to clean the house right or wash dishes or whatever you can have that same anointing praise God say the same anointing that might have caused you to shout or scream or praise the Lord or lay your hands on somebody that got healed you know the previous day but then the same anointing is right on you just praising God thanking God right for the family you got the health you got and brother same for me as a teacher I can get up here I can I can preach and pray for the sick and God heals them at times and I can go to work at school I can sit amongst you know 19 six-year-olds and I can just sit there and be a sweet Christian to them praise God and the same anointing praise God right same Holy Spirit and so he was and like brother Branham said brother man said faith is the master of every circumstance you and I are not the Masters faith in this in other words God's spirit is the is the answer to every problem No Matter What circus or circumstance we're in the the master of that circumstance is God's anointing that anointing we're talking about praise God Amen it's that anointing we're talking about and yes then God uses us God uses you know his anointing on us to be the master of it but we're really not the master of it because we've all tried to figure out situations and circumstances and we failed and then went totally opposite about what we thought it was going to go so we're not the master of every circumstance it's Christ in US is the master just like the Bible said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world praise God Hallelujah son I always want to make sure we give all the credit where it's due it's due to Christ Hallelujah now uh that's just a little brief intro there I didn't have that in my notes really but um let's look at here a few uh quotes before I want to uh you know I had we had other visitors that I thought were going to come and they didn't come that's okay but I just wanted uh there was a pastor that was going to come tonight but I just wanted if he was here I wanted him to read this I'm just going to read it Anyway by God's grace every Doctrine and everything else of the Bible that we have in the church must be based upon the word of God must come from the word not just one place but from Genesis of Revelation it must say the same thing because we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture for the Bible said in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established right brother random gives that famous example where the Bible said Judas went and hung himself and he said a preacher can't take that one person say now you go do the same right the Bible the Bible never says we should commit suicide we should serve God all the days of our life praise God we should fill up the full measure of the days God has ordained for us the Bible said they're all written in God's book praise God so with everything in the Bible we need two or three witnesses to establish a Doctrine an instruction Hallelujah here's another one just familiar with you this is the one I like because it shows brother Adam says if I'm wrong the Bible's always right now we must prove All Things by the tapes no tapes are good tapes are going to point us to the Bible but we must prove All Things by the scripture if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and I'm wrong and I know people have a hard time saying brother Ram's wrong and you know I do too it's just we all do as out of our respect for a man of God like who's going to stand up and say uh you know Paul was wrong or or John Wesley was wrong ending the church age Messengers like that would be hard for us to to say but there's times we got to say it because they're all men right they're all fallible they can all make mistakes except Christ cannot make a mistake amen so we say these things with humility because that's what brother Brandon said well Grant said we have to read a Bible verse every every service because my words will fail but God's words can never fail amen he said see the scripture is always right and the only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture now is that true now I'd like to hear you say Amen when you believe it you see amen means so be it now we cannot all right now in this context in Jesus's life brother Adam said I've often thought I'd like to have heard him when he raised up those precious hands and said come unto me so he raised up his hand said come to me now brother I'm just dramatizing right we don't know if he was like this or hands we don't know where the hands were these are dramatizing see that tired weary look on him now this is his first year of ministry but he's already been Healing The Sick and having healing campaigns right he had three pulls to his ministry we talked about that Hallelujah he said come unto me see that tired weary look on him when he was tired and weary from his journey say come unto me all ye that are labor and heavy laden I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me he said for I meek and lowly I'd like to have heard him say that I wasn't there in that day I wasn't standing with Peter James and John but I hope I'm standing by them in the day when I can hear him say it was well done good and faithful servant now enter into the joys of the Lord that's beautiful Hallelujah so brother man you know it makes Jesus look like he's tired and weary like we all see black sometimes we get black circles under eyes right so we imagine Jesus he's tired but he said come unto me if you're tired now he's a tired one saying come to me if you're tired right because he was laboring for God but I like this he said all you that labor heavy laden and I'll give you rest now this is this is before the Holy Ghost could be given so at this time he's saying anyone he said everyone who's not born again should come to me and I'll give you rest he said take my yoke upon you now let me stop right there that means everybody else before you're born again you're yoked is something that you don't need to be yoked to like first for me it was my denomination or the mega church I was yoked to before I came to Christ you know or maybe it was my mom my mom's leadership because that's all the only leadership I had or maybe it was your grandma or dad or whoever you are yoked to something but he says you you know to be born again you've got to leave your previous Associates and you got to come to me and you got to yoke yourself with me you got to labor with me see we're going to labor for something we're going to labor for money or popularity or or pleasures of this world but Jesus wants us to labor with him praise God we got to be yoked to something praise God and when you're yoked to Christ you work with him like you walk stepping step and step with them right step with you just take the same steps he does you only like Brotherhood says the bride only does was thus saith the Lord praise God oh my God he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me so we see before you can learn in the natural with animals being yoked together I've only seen it a few times down in Amish Country I've only seen animals yoke together a couple times not too often usually I just see one Amish guy and he's got he's behind one horse or something like that or one ox or something like that I've only seen a couple times where they've been yoked he says so but we see another be in order to be yoked I'm sorry in order to learn you've got to be yoked to him first that means you got to get in close Association right you got to get in real close association with Jesus like like kneeling on your knees or or reading your Bible or looking into the Open Bible is that right amen you got to be yoked to him you got to be laboring for him you have to be near Christ praise God and that's how you learn from Christ you got to come to him and you got to be yoked to him you have to serve him serve his purpose in your life he said for I'm meek and lowly now that means everybody else isn't right that means the world Satan is not very meek he's boastful he's a liar right he's arrogant and he's not lowly so Jesus is the opposite of all these others aren't you glad he's the opposite Hallelujah it's so wonderful that we can always feel his presence because we know it's sacred praise God it's holy it's not the same Spirit you know they'd have at the at the bar tonight totally different like brother Matthew says our spirit is fresh our spirit is clean he said our spirit is sober he said but it's also full the joy of the Lord praise God thank God Amen he said that's he said that's what John said we said when he said I was in this fear on the Lord's Day Hallelujah what a great sweet spirit that we feel when we're gathered in Christ's name oh it's a beautiful beautiful thing so this is again the beginning of Jesus ministry John was wondering are you the Messiah or look for another now I want to if you got your Bibles there handy I'll probably call my children to read the Mosa they were read a few verses here by the grace of God we'll kind of see how it goes now I want to start with this first verse you know Matthew 11 29 I want to look at verses that use the word learn and there's many I think there was over 15 if I'm not mistaken like I said this is part one but I want to start there in Matthew 11 29. so there are 60 verses in the entire Bible I just looked up there that used the word learn and uh you know of course in Parts two and three I can go over all these and just kind of show the importance of learning it's been misunderstood and uh and it's understandable you know brother random many times brother random was he was pointing out how colleges and high schools were already so liberal in his day now what are they today you know but brother man was making the point you know education many times overall is of the devil right as far as when they they indoctrinate you with awful things but we have to we have to know how to read the Bible so we do need education we have to learn to read for our bosses right that's a maybe type for our bosses we have to learn the you know I'm a teacher so I like education when it's a right a good education but but Ram's making the point the majority of schools are Heathen schools right you know they're teaching us they're teaching wicked things but see we uh you know and then you know brother ramble brother Rand Will Blast preachers that have Doctorate Degrees and yet uh and yet you know there's nothing wrong with learning about the history of the Bible but it's only wrong when you when you crucify the effects of the Holy Ghost right that that's what it's really awful when you say the whole well Jesus isn't the same today Jesus doesn't heal today and Jesus uh that that part of the Bible that doesn't apply today like we've all heard those those serpents you're right they the serpents spit out those lies right we've all heard that there's nothing wrong with you know learning about history and then nothing wrong with that at all but when we get into human philosophies and and human ideas like everybody has to speak in tongues right or just human philosophies like that or we should pray to marry and pray to the Saints those are human philosophies and that's those are doctrines of devils because they make you they anoint you with the wrong Spirit to seek the gifts instead of The Giver or teach you spiritualism instead of Holy Spirit Worship praise God praying to Jesus Christ the high priest amen we don't need any other intercessors we've already got the perfect one praise God we've got Jesus Christ and his ears always open to our prayers Hallelujah so it's understandable you know why some people would say well learning is not even a word I would use if I come to church well then you haven't read your Bible lately it's time to read your Bible too yes you listen to tapes but yes read your Bible too praise God have a balance of the word of God right but this word learned in the Greek means to understand so 24 times it's learn and then one time it's understand and it means to increase your knowledge now the word knowledge courses having understanding I've gone over that numerous times but I like this one as well when you learn you actually use what you've been taught now we all know we went to math class we learned a lot of stuff but then we never used it once we got out of math class right so did we really learn it no no you only really learn it when you use it praise God right like I've watched all these YouTube videos about how to you know fix the plumbing when it's leaking and sometimes I get it sometimes I don't so I really haven't learned it yet you know I really haven't learned I'm just watching and trying to imitate it how to unclog that sink now Simon and cam could Dustin they could come to in a moment's time right they really learned it they can use it they can practice it but it also means to be the habit of I like that because uh Peter says we must be diligent in all things we must have good habits if we don't have the good habit yet we haven't learned it yet and church there's nothing wrong with saying that right like a couple years ago in in our school are are uh I'm just talking a natural type here in our elementary middle school and high school they had this big movement called The Power of yet now it sounds funny to us but but it was true the kids would sometimes say well I haven't learned that or I don't know that and the teachers were trained tell them to add the word yet on the end because yet gives you hope you're going to learn it eventually and it was a big move you know the kids say well I can't read I would say you can't read yet but you're getting close you're closer than you were last week right it's the power of yet so I want to encourage you if you don't have the habits that you want yet that's okay you can still get them praise God there's hope for us amen I don't have all the habits I want praise God but I want to develop Christian habits praise God I just don't have them yet but I can look back from last year since I've got some ones I didn't have last year right I understand some things now I can use some things now that I couldn't use last year like dancing amen praise God so things you're accustomed to you're learning them you're practicing them you've got good habits you've learned it and Jesus says we need to do this people say well I just can't learn to do that I can't I can't do that when it comes to Jesus well then you just got to come to him more because he's right there ready to teach you and did you did you see what he said he's a Meek teacher now we all know the teachers that scream at us most of us don't like those kind of teachers and I'm not one of those kind of teachers but we don't like those uh we don't like those brazen right um red face and they get so mad they want to blow up at you and so you you you're a failure you can never learn this and I don't like you in my class get out of my class we don't like those kind of teachers doing Jesus is not that way he's humble he's meek so we have to discern is this who's beating me up here is it the devil or Jesus well Jesus says I'm meek and lowly of heart I'm a patient teacher now are there times we get spanked by Jesus yes yes many prophets got spanked Jonah got spanked pretty bad by getting tossed out of a ship right get swallowed up by a large fish a whale I mean there's going to be times he's trying to get our attention but that's just because we're stubborn sometimes and the church said like we're all we're all stubborn at times just like even even our Swedish teachers sometimes they get a little Stern they do get a little certain sometimes if I just want to just point this out Jesus is first of all meek and lowly he's humble didn't Jesus say the greatest among you will be what the servants so Jesus leads by example he says Watch How I serve and then you do what I do real humble right find a way to serve other people that's where you'll find Jesus Hallelujah so is the is the word learn a good word yes it's a good word as long as you're using it the right way let's look at another one now I put up here just in Red so you would catch it learn is the same as increasing knowledge right or understanding but Revelation is also the appearing or the coming of knowledge so learn in Revelation are very similar like the word reveal means to unveil right if I said if I said what's under this you know I put this over here it's veiled right but as soon as I unveil it oh now now I I understand what's under there now I've learned what's under there very similar definitions okay very simple and it's even in the scripture that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit now it's the spirit praise God that's what we need the Holy Spirit to learn praise God in other words you got to say Lord anoint me with the learner Spirit anoint me with the spirit I want to learn from you praise God because everything inside of us our sin nature is all fighting against I don't want to learn I don't want to grow as a Christian that's what your sin nature is saying your body's saying I don't want to pray I don't want to read my Bible I don't want to go to church I don't want to testify but the holy spirit inside of you says you need to praise God you need to learn how to do that more praise God I need to learn how to do that more praise God so it's a spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge so the unveiling or the appearing in the understanding okay so me just to make it simple I would use learn and reveal interchangeably well now you get into Faith as a revelation I get into that too right if you if you have if you have a revelation of something you have faith that's going to happen right you have you have trust it's going to happen well that means you've all you've also learned it's going to happen right you've learned oh I've learned to trust God I've learned from this from God this is going to happen I've got faith so see these are very close together and I don't mean to you know nitpick at words but I'm just giving you an understanding of what these words mean so then it doesn't feel bad to to say well I came here to learn tonight now most people you know most churches if you walk into them imagine the message if you walked in and said well I'm here to learn tonight they'd say you Heathen you know or they say something like that you backslider you're lukewarm but Jesus said come and learn of me come and learn I want you to learn from me I'm really Meek I'm really lonely yoke yourself to me work with me praise God and I'll show you how to have rest for your soul praise God so I'm just going to use those interchangeably learn is to increase your understanding and Revelation is the coming of your understanding so it comes right and then you learn it you you see the Revelation and you learn it then you have a habit of it Hallelujah it's a good thought I think it's a good good set of scriptures to place together now there's 24 verses that use that same Greek word of learn and here's one of them people that say they don't want to learn well you don't know what you're saying so you don't know what you're saying because the Bible says though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and I don't have to ask anybody to raise their hand here I'm sure we all need to learn how to suffer learn how to take suffering as an opportunity to learn something about obeying God right and see what does that do and that makes you perfect or makes you complete it makes you the best believer that you can be it makes you the best representative of Christ that you possibly can when you learn to look at your sufferings as this is my opportunity to learn church and Austin I've been talking about it you know any any sickness is opportunity to learn Financial trials opportunity to learn learn to trust God learn to obey God right family family disagreements that's a great opportunity to learn right there I'll just admit you know I wasn't a very good husband when we first got married but by God's grace I hope I've learned to be a better one honey yeah she said yes okay everybody hear that now I grew I learned I hope myself to Christ but no really that that's that's how it all has to be you know and I had to make many mistakes to learn how to be a better husband or a better father or a better pastor same thing for you a better a per a better a holy ghost anointed member the laity we got to learn how to do that it's possible so we'll suffer many times so God can teach us to obey him the next time Hallelujah so and he became perfect through this suffering and so you and I can't be completed unless we learn through our sufferings right our trials now the beautiful part is many times in our sufferings will suffer but then God will bring some amazing answer to prayer Even in our suffering even when we don't deserve it can anybody say Amen to that like we weren't faithful the whole time and we weren't overcoming we weren't speaking the word the whole time yet God will come around and do something great for us but he's teaching us be next time be patient longer next time testify a little longer hold on a little longer next time right that's stretching our muscles our spiritual muscles right stretching our face making us stronger in Christ hopefully somebody will come around and say well remember last time like when we were suffering hopefully one of our Saints and one of our friends will come along and say well remember last time I was struggling this God help me through it God will help you through it be encouraged and think about that church nobody could come and take Jesus suffering for him Peter was like I'll die with you did he not not there you see sometimes Church even I we have to learn to sometimes we gotta let our Saints suffer a little bit right especially parents you know at some point you gotta let your kids suffer a little bit you have to they got to learn lessons and I don't mean throw them out to the devil that's not what I mean but I mean you got to let them make mistakes they gotta let them make their own choices and then learn from their choices nobody could take Jesus sufferings like remember he prayed he Brother Brad said he prayed to dodge the cross but he ultimately said let your will be done not my will be done he had to learn he had to learn this for the joy that was set before he had to learn as we looked at it on Sunday the joy that's how he got through no weapon amen no weapon that was formed against Jesus could Prosper praise God he learned every weapon that came Adam of Satan that attacked him he overcame and he learned to obey God in all of it there's 30 minutes already what a great what a great group of scriptures the Lord give us on the word learning now did you remember this one Jesus said this is red letters it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh to me now Look at that interesting I just caught that Jesus said come to me and I'll give you rest well first he said you got to learn to the father and then come to Jesus so you gotta you gotta learn in other words the father's the Holy Ghost right so the first time God works on your heart right it's through the Holy Ghost right and then it brings us to now for us it brings us to the words of Jesus but in his day it brought him to the it brought them to the literal body of Jesus God's son does everybody understand and today you know the holy spirit will bring us to make intercession to the high priest the body of Jesus in heaven the glorified body in heaven see that isn't that awesome you got to learn from the Holy Spirit and then you can learn from the son oh my Hallelujah this deep and Rich already by God's grace Hallelujah and did you know brother RAM used this verse to explain the baptism of the Holy Ghost so what are we getting at only the people with the Holy Ghost will learn to be better Christians remember the foolish version they won't go on and get more oil they won't they won't learn how to get oil at the right time look at that say what they knew better they could have they could have learned that they could learn oh before night falls you better go get some they should have known that they can learn that he did it God's true church will learn to get the oil now amen God's true bride will learn to get the Holy Ghost now well there's time Hallelujah oh thank God there's time Hallelujah amen and like I talked about you know a few weeks ago like brother Ram said we you don't want to be a moss-back Christian right how does moss form right it's just something that sits still and it gets moisture on it and Moss builds up everyone said you don't want to be that kind of a Christian you want to sit you don't want to sit around and do nothing for God do you want to do something for God right because say like this you want to get cleaned off for Jesus you want to get cleaned off and be working for Jesus amen you don't want to sit still and do nothing we got to find what does God called me to do in other words get yoke to Jesus and start working for Jesus amen see oh it's beautiful thought there's a quote it's from page 140. to further bring out what we've just said and to also use a scripture that should be born in the mind as we talk about who it is that's baptized with the Holy Ghost see what Jesus says in John 6 45. it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God but turn to Isaiah 54 13 whence this is taken and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord the all of God are the children of God in church we said on Sunday when are you the Sons and Daughters of God who remembers now let's say it together now you're not the Son of God later or a daughter of God you're a son or daughter of God right now praise God amen you are right now it's now you can go to your father now because you got a relationship with Daddy Hallelujah amen you've got a relationship with the father hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of God he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the Holy Ghost isn't that wonderful oh it's so beautiful so who's got the Holy Ghost those that can learn of Christ those can those that can keep hearing the word of God and develop the right habits right and become a better understanding of Jesus and live a life that pleases Christ at the end at the end of the sermon I'm going to ask you what do you need to learn and the fact that you're still alive means you need to learn something praise God so don't say you got to all figure it out fool anybody and act like well I'm the perfect person or I'm the perfect Christian let's not act like that we all can learn something praise God we can all grow in understanding we can all grow in Revelation I'll be the first one to say I need to grow in that praise God that's why I keep coming to church that's why I keep worshiping that's why I keep reading my Bible that's why I keep praying that's why I keep preaching praise God because I got things I can learn now John 7 14. now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up in the temple and taught and the Jewish Marvel was saying how know if this man letters having never learned now they're talking about the fair School of Pharisees Jesus answered and said my Doctrine is not mine so my learning is not mine but his that set me Hallelujah see in church Jesus knew the Bible better than anybody because he was the word amen he was the word made flesh you know we always hear the quote you know the Pharisees had the the Scrolls memorized they could put a pin and they'd know exactly where it was and and and and Satan's got the Bible memorized well so did Jesus because he was the word let's not make the Pharisees and Satan like smarter than Jesus Jesus is the word of God hallelujah can't fool Jesus he knows every prophecy every word and not one John Orton will fail Hallelujah [Music] let's make sure we exalt Jesus where he needs to be amen higher amen High way higher than the devil let's stop Satan Lord and let's put Jesus Higher praise God he was and is the word but Satan has it memorized but not the Revelation remember he didn't have the Revelation that if I kill the Messiah he'll raised on the third day the Bible said the prince of this world would not have done that they would not have killed Jesus if they knew what it was going to accomplish they might the devil might have had it memorized but he didn't understand he didn't have the revelation of it but look now he's got a Jesus up here he's got Jesus in there I'm Satan Satan's got a battle with the Jesus right there amen is that right he's gonna and then the Bible said Greater Works than this shall you do because I go to my father amen there's more miracle workers there's more power of the holy spirit in a many-membered bride not just one man but it's in the bride of Christ Hallelujah it's better that way praise God amen hallelujah Jesus has both the memory and the Revelation the word of God that's what we need by God's grace of course we don't have to memorize the Bible but we have to have the revelation of the word of God and yes at the right you know as much as we can let's write the memorization of the word of God in our hearts Hallelujah Luke 14 25 and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come unto me and hate not his father his mother and his wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple so he's basically saying you have to love Jesus Christ more than any person in your family and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple all right so you have to love Jesus so much you're willing to lose any physical relationship like Doris did praise God Amen you're a real disciple there sister traveled across the country to be a disciple of Christ hallelujah amen that's beautiful praise God but Jesus said if you cannot bear the cross and you cannot come after him now there it is come again right he said come unto me and I says You must come after me praise God that means he's going somewhere right if you've got a cross and you're supposed to come after him well he's going somewhere where is he leading to he's leading you to heaven praise God Hallelujah but you can't be a disciple unless you take up your cross and follow the lord sounds like a good yoke doesn't it the cross sounds like a good yoke I'm yoked to Christ Hallelujah I've got to die to myself to follow Christ what's the word disciple mean the word disciple means a learner there is learner learner whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my learner now look it's going to be a learner because you're Jesus learner I like the Mind front of that learner I'm Jesus's learner right I'm not I'm not the universities learner I'm Jesus's learner I belong to him praise God I'm his little child I'm as I'm a son Hallelujah and he's teaching me as I follow after him so we learn from Jesus we cannot be his disciples if we do not crucify our sinful desires every single day it's impossible and you don't have to raise your hand but I'm sure most of you if not all of you crucified some sinful desires today so God bless you you group of your wonderful group of disciples here tonight right you're learning you're learning you're understanding how to follow Christ Glory so we must take the cross and then we become learners and look at that now I cannot I mean it's a it's a it's a direct command like this is impossible it's impossible to be a learner if you don't go through the self-crucifixion of your sinful desires it's impossible right it's impossible then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my Learners indeed I'll just put that word in there because it means the same thing so you're not a true learner unless you keep staying in the word of God week after week month after month year after year for some of us decade after decade I just passed two decades a few years ago Hallelujah we just keep going we and and as we go then we become the Learners uh God wants us to be and when I just started teaching you know back in 2004 uh three you know 2004 another slogan in the schools was a lifelong learner I remember that was brand new everybody was saying it lifelong learner lifelong learner you're not there yet you're not there yet I mean all these sayings that just go through the school systems right you they teach you something new you do it for a few years and you learn something else right they're slogans well that was the beginning I'm a lifelong learner and then I just dawned to me you know not long after that that's what I am as a Christian I don't want to be satisfied with what I know about Jesus I want to know more about Jesus praise God there's more of Jesus to know praise God I tell you I tell you I need to know him better as a father and pretty soon if God terrorists I'm gonna have to know him as a grandfather I got a lot to know I got a lot to learn praise God right I've got a lot to learn as a pastor I still got a lot to learn Hallelujah I mean think about different stages of life that you have to learn there's more learning to do each stage but like I preached an important The Best Is Yet To Come the best is when you see your children walking in the truth there's no Greater Joy than that praise God Amen to see your children walk in the truth of God's word hallelujah No Greater Joy praise God it's greater than the joy of Divine Healing right it's greater than the joy of a revelation or dream or prophecy it's greater than that is to see your children walk in the truth and if you're Paul you didn't have natural children so he rejoiced when he saw the Corinthians walking the truth amen hallelujah so I guess as a pastor I can see two kinds of children walking the truth my own children and then the sheep that I feed by God's grace I could have two Joys amen double Joy double portion Hallelujah so we got to continue we got to stay with the word the Revelation the message of the hour and then we're Jesus is Learners and then you should know the truth and the truth should make you free well now we get the idea you can't be free unless you learn how to be free praise God you know people they struggle in there you know and I didn't do it totally Christian I struggle with addiction the struggle with these I've always felt like I was bound up or I was forced to do it but you can learn how to not do it praise God you can learn to be free praise God you can learn to to help Christ Christ and break those chains Hallelujah you can learn how to get out of the present house amen hallelujah and be a free God's free man God's free woman you can learn how to do it praise God Amen Mary Magdalene learned how to be free from Seven demons praise God what you do she come to Jesus she yoked Upon Jesus and Jesus delivered her from Seven demons praise God if she could do it we can do it praise God we can all learn how to be free right we can all understand how to be free and program tells us you got to expose Satan and many times that means sometimes you got to confess your sins to somebody else now not always you have to tell everybody all your deep dark troubles but you got to confess it to God In Prayer you got to say Jesus I'm like the prodigal I'm the guilty one I'm sitting against you I've sinned against my fellow man I've sinned against my father I sinned against heaven and you got to expose Satan and then die out to it praise God die out to your sin and that's Jesus Take that away and make my house clean sweep out my house and then fill my house with your love praise God oh God fill my house with the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Christ amen there it is amen there it is hallelujah thank you Jesus I love the word of God thank you Lord I see that's what Christ did in my life praise God Hallelujah Jesus how many want to continue in the word of God so I want to be a real learner I don't want to be one of those Learners we're going to get to at the end of the sermon maybe I'm at the end now we'll see how many slides I got forgot me to have it now I'm not going to read through all this but the Bible says only the disciples bear much fruit now remember I'm going to drop this in here too there's three kinds of fruit there's fruit when you just get saved because because John the Baptist said bring forth fruits of repentance there's fruit fruits you have when you just got saved right you can see a new Christian they're on fire they're joyful they they feel forgiven that's a fruit of the spirit and then there's fruits of sanctification right you start getting your life cleaned up starting to get the good habits there's fruits of that wow I can tell this person's really changed look he don't cuss anymore she don't cuss anymore uh they they took out all their jewelry you know they're whatever nose rings and everything for me it was I cut my long hair off you know I had long hair I'd cut my hair that's a fruit of repentance amen but then there's also fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God like love joy and Temperance and long-suffering and godliness amen all these fruits and this makes me ask the question well then who are the true Disciples of brother Brown's message it's the ones who learn the word of God that brother Adam taught right not just memorize the stories I thank God for the stories but those stories got to point us back to the word of God hallelujah that story might not apply to you like let's go back to the Hattie right one like how many of us are ever going to have I mean we might but how many of us are ever going to tell somebody Haven say whatever you want and I'm it's going to be right here right now I mean how many how many of us are actually gonna be able to say it very few but yet we can learn from that right we can learn that idea of the truth of speak to the mountain and it'll move right or speak to the Rock it'll bring forth water but we get the uh ought to raise our faith right to say what the spirit wants us to say in the right time so we love all the stories we love the taste we love everything but it's got to point us back to the word of God hallelujah and even with Divine Healing or someone if we learn from Brother man's healing well that doesn't apply to all of us because we all don't have the gift of healing the Bible says right so we gotta learn to apply these the right way Lord raise my faith to use the gifts the particular gifts that are in my life praise God and church the more gifts you got the more accountable you are right the more you're gonna have to answer Hallelujah and preachers get the hardest judgment right that's what the Bible says he said be not many Masters be not many preachers because they're going to be judged the harshest I better be praying up more by God's grace right we all got to pray up praise God we want to live as close as we can praise God the true disciples are the ones who abide in Christ they're yoked to Christ I'm gonna go down to verse eight because we're familiar with this now my life verse is in verse 5 right without me you can do nothing but verse 8 here it is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples can't be Learners unless we are yoked with Christ and then we learn from Christ we learn and understand how to serve him at the same time we're taking up the cross we're dying to our lusts of our flesh and our pride in life and lust of our eyes at the same time we're dying out to those things and that's when we can bear fruit for Christ oh it's beautiful I love placing all these scriptures together side by side because you can see them okay now this this has to go like this my life I got to come to Christ I gotta be yoke to Christ amen I gotta take up a cross and then I can learn Hallelujah that I can be a true disciple then I can have fruits in my life praise God Hallelujah now this is the one I saw cam use a few weeks ago I don't know you guys saw that the four kinds of grounds there are four reactions to the gospel right this is the wise version It's the only one that brings forth good fruit the only one that has fruit Holy Ghost filled fruit is the wise virgin the foolish version doesn't have Holy Ghost fruit fruit but they can have you know the fruits of repentance right because that's what John the Baptist said they could have fruits of sanctification but they won't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost fruits those are special fruits those are the most mature that's much fruit amen that's the much fruit Jesus spoke about much fruit so see we want that we want a life that is very fruitful we learn we come to Christ we learn and then people can see the fruits in our lives right the easy one to see is with long patience long I'm sorry long-suffering right we if we are long-suffering then we can suffer with somebody a long time when they're wrong yeah we I I left you in other words someone's wrong and they mistreated you but you can still love them a long time you can suffer with their ignorance or their Disobedience a long time without trying to write them out of the Kingdom especially your brothers and sisters in Christ that's the real love right because your natural family you might you know you might see your might not see your family you might have a disagreement you might not see them maybe once a month but you're going to see your church family three times a week right church is that right we really need to be long-suffering with one another that's why the last anointing you get before the Holy Ghost is broadly kindness God wants you to be kind to your family before you come into that before your baptized into the family he wants you to learn to love your brothers and sisters in Christ all right getting a little tired here so that's understandable so let me try to finish this up here now here's what I would try to say to you know message people that would say well learning is a bad word well that's there's two kinds of learning right here's the kind we don't want having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such certain way for of this sore are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women on Laden with sins LED away with diverse locks ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth this is the this is the learning that brother Branham is blasting they're church members but they're learning how to sin they're learning to sin and this applies even to message churches that allow polygamy or allow movies into their church right yeah or any any sin any sin they allow they're ever learning but they're learning the wrong things see the sins get into their homes I'm just speaking in general and it teaches people to sin rather than take up the cross praise God Hallelujah they're never never able to come to the knowledge the revelation of the truth the learning of the truth they don't learn to obey the truth that's why people want to call me a strict Pastor I'll say Amen every time because I am not I'm here to teach you to learn Jesus Christ not not learning to sin let's learn Jesus Christ Hallelujah so I like that reputation I'll keep that one finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are good report if there be any virtue any praise think on these things eight things hates eternity those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you living on this is very similar to the scripture Brothers said about resting how many want a peaceful life well what's a peaceful life you're resting in Christ I mean it's very it's basically the same thing the anointing of the Holy Spirit giving you peace with God how do you get that bro Jess how do we how do I do that think on the right things that's what the Bible says think on all these eight it gives us eight options that's a lot of options a lot of options but Salvation you only got two life or death yeah but with with your thought life here's here's a option here's eight Avenues think on one of these things see so Paul says the things that you've learned received and heard and seen in my life do God will be with you so this is the kind of learning we want that's why we want to listen to brother random stories right we can learn from those stories right that's the kind of learning they want to do they looked at Paul and they learned from Paul I imagine brother Derek he'd be out there making tents I wonder what they can learn from his tent making wow he's such he pays attention in detail just like God pays attention to every detail in my life wow Paul makes a pretty good tent there Paul really cares about that tent oh yeah that's right Paul cares about the tense of the Believers we're the Tabernacles of God we're the tents of God Paul works a lot of long hours boy it takes a lot of I got to spend a lot of time with the Lord in order to be built up as a real Tabernacle of God I mean there's things we can learn right we can learn from the natural just from watching just from watching a man of God you can learn and then the peace of God is with you Hallelujah here's another one very similar all that live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution because you got to learn right you suck Jesus had to learn things that he suffered right but evil men and seducers who acts worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so look at the deception today the deception is greater today than it was back then because Paul said it's thus saith the Lord the deception is greater today that's right but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and been assured of what things are we assured of today I'm sure they're going to find them right in here I'm assured we're going to find them right in here what things are we assured of I'm sure we're gonna find them right in here the things we know are the truth knowing of whom thou Hast learned them oh so God sent us a God sent man and then we learn from him and we're assured of them because they are thus saith the Lord Hallelujah that from a child that's known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus so here this is spiritual or Godly learning this isn't the vain learning like ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth we're not vain Learners we're spiritual learners Hallelujah and then we can learn from other holy ghost-filled Saints praise God II Peter 3 17 ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness that's why the first thing we look at when we were concerned about people they stopped coming to church they're step where's their steadfastness or they start uh gossiping or they start saying evil things about one another they're falling from their steadfastness right we're supposed to like like brothers said about brother Neville he said one thing I love about brother Neville he's the same brother Neville every day of the week right he's just the same we just sang that song right uh uh about being the same it's always the same right praising God I want to praise God every day and every day be the same let me be a real solid Christian praise God you have a test you have a consistent testimony Hallelujah but grow Saints grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be glory both now and forever see it's a Bible command that we must be learners it's a Bible command that we must grow in our understanding in our learning now there's the you know the take Church movement says we don't have to they say we don't have to discern anything on tape they just sit back and say Amen to every word that's being a lazy learner all right that's that's less learning to not discern that's learning to uh neglect your gift of judging the word of God right it also disobeys the Bible command to prove all things try every Spirit search the scriptures to prove what is taught is scriptural see so saying Amen to everywhere on tape that's not spiritual learning that's not understanding right because I can show you where brother Adam said uh Rebecca one day is going to take my place well what does that mean he passed away who's placing anything right praying for the sick or seeing visions brother Jose reached out and asked the family about that and they said no she never took brother's place in any way right so many examples I have a I have a document with almost 90. I have over eight examples of just human things brother Ram said see God wants us to learn God wants us to ask questions how we can say Amen to that God wants us to grow the only way we grow as many times is ask questions I'm not going to go through those examples tonight because I'm already I want to stop around eight o'clock I'm already 805 here but remember they're just like there's two kinds of learning there's two kinds of faith brother Ram said Paul down there in the natural realm with his PhD he had an intellectual Faith but he didn't have a Divine Faith there's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith and divine faith okay and a good example this is James 2 19. the Bible said the devil believes in God but trembles well that's just the intellectual faith that's an intellectual belief but the devil won't obey the word of God the devil won't repent so that's intellectual faith right now the same thing we can't get stuck in that we've got to repent when we're wrong praise God we're going to repent of bad bad attitudes right we got to repent of being ill to somebody we've got to repent of saying the wrong words harboring evil spirits right we got to repent on those things right that's what the Bible's we gotta have real Faith praise God not intellectual faith I'm not going to read all that there there's at least 18 times brother Adam says this there's two kinds of Faith there's human faith and there's Divine Faith same thing with learning there's human learning but then there's Divine learning so believing brother Branham he says was learning from Jesus that's what brother Adam says no no John Ryan was the man who received his sight he was blind received his sight still preaching Divine Healing tonight so the the man was blind he got his sight and then he started preaching and in that meeting down there he'd been healed and how God was pouring out his blessings I remember my wife come down to see me and there was about four city blocks of people ready for the Revival they were standing and my wife said you don't mean all those people come to hear you preach I said no they come to learn of Jesus brother brother Brown was going to be preaching but he said it's not me teaching the people it's Jesus teaching the people Hallelujah so see there's a good one for the tapes when I listen to brother Brown I'm not listening brother Bram I'm listening to Jesus the word of God hallelujah amen brother Ram says we must learn two doc true Doctrine from God's spirit we must learn it from the Holy Spirit now watch he says but you'll never win the opinion of the organization one person no sir when they got their rule set we believe this period if you'd write up their Doctrine we we believe this comma it'd be different so here's the idea we must learn more about God right we can't say we understand everything and know everything about the word of God he says if you write that up your Doctrine we believe this comma it'd be different appear it means we believe that and you've got to come to this and sign this paper or that's all of it but if you say we believe this comma plus as much as we can learn from God we're open to the Holy Spirit now you're going on brother he said that's going to be different now Hallelujah and church that's all the awesome thing is you can say that tonight praise God if you've grown away from seeking God this week you can start tonight and you can start tomorrow morning learning more about God hallelujah you can change it you have the choice you have the power to change it praise God I have the choice we all have that choice to be Learners of Christ oh it's beautiful see we should always have a comma well yeah I know about not eternal hell I know about Serpentine I know about water baptism brother Jesse I know about the book of Romans but put a comma say but God can show me more haha Glory Hallelujah glad to be with a bunch of disciples here tonight by God's grace you want to learn more about Jesus and brother random even prayed to learn from God see learning is not a bad word learning is a good word when it's the Divine learning brother man takes his text on be certain of God he said and now Lord bless Thy word as it goes forth and may the Holy Spirit capture our minds that's what I hope happened tonight I hope somehow the Holy Spirit was able to get our minds away from everything going on out there was he able to do it tonight and prepare us for his visitation as we have asked him to come for we do not come to the house Lord to be seen or to see but to learn of Thee and to know of thy nature where's nature and thy way and thy causes that we might be able to face the problems of life with a real Assurance being surgeon of God Amen God help me to learn tonight that I can trust you in every problem praise God in every problem in every circumstance of my life teach me that I can be certain that you're with me praise God teach me that tonight I'm going to learn that tonight that's a beautiful prayer now I know you like this one program learned about cat I've learned about God just by looking at cattle right he says I'm a Hunter as you all know my mother's half Indian I'm and my conversion never taken that out of me I still go up to Colorado where I'm a licensed guy to every phone go away hype in the mountains where I used to herd cattle for years and sat there many times learned so much about God not even in the church not even in the church and so he tells the story of the blood tag right you remember that story but you know that Ranger never noticed the brands now sometimes you use brands for a good thing like it's a brand is like a seal the Holy Ghost well in this case he doesn't use the brand he used the ear tag he watched for the blood tag in your ear you couldn't put a here a Hereford on that forest or cow on that Forest without being a thoroughbred Hereford it had to be a registered Hereford and I think of the day of judgment God will not notice whether I belong to the assemblies or the Church of God or what church I belong to the brand that I wear he'll look for the blood tag the blood of his own son that's what he'll look for praise God Amen he can learn church we can learn out there in nature can't we we can learn right out there you can learn so much like we learned with our chickens right we learn from other people you better put a fence around them or else the enemies are going to get them then you better dig under the ground and put that chicken wire under the ground because they can dig under the fence what does that teach us the word of God fortifies us well the man said God fortified you with the best thing he could give you that's the word of God hallelujah he put a hedge he put a fence all the way around you so you're safe and secure praise God you might hear all those wolves you might hear the coyote and the raccoons but you're safe in there you can be happy inside your chicken run well your Eagle Run can I say like that Hallelujah your lamb run let me call like that you can be safe inside your land run God's protecting you he gave you the best defense plus he gave you a sword of Despair praise God oh man you can learn so much search just out in nature you can learn of God now I'm going to skip past this for time's sake here yeah I'm close right here so church what do you and I need to learn of Jesus tonight I preach this whole sermon on learning was it inspired of God I felt I was inspired to preach it was my study in vain or was it going to be help to somebody tonight it's yet to be seen but I hope it's going to be a healthy people in other words what are we going to take from this what are we going to learn from this what habit are we going to apply to our lives from this hopefully the best one would be to come to Christ take up your yoke right get yoked with Christ get partnered with Christ and if you do that you'll take up your cross and you'll follow where the Lord is leading you and your in your life what do you need to learn I'm going to skip past that for time's sake because I've already preached over an hour what can we learn tonight well we can learn to forgive if we can't if we're having trouble forgiving somebody right I'm not going to put a list of 100 things up here we could learn to repent right if we still haven't repented of something we can learn to overcome well Ram said it doesn't even matter in the church age book it doesn't matter what you have to overcome as long as you know how to overcome and we already went through that you can expose the devil you confess and say God empty me out of that sin and fill me with your spirit renew my mind transform my mind praise God we can learn to wait and have patience we can learn to be diligent we can learn to put these this knowledge that we have into practice we can learn to care for others and look to the needs of other people we can learn to operate the gifts God has placed in our lives those are all things we want to learn so the question is who will come to Jesus tonight and who will yoke themselves to him to learn of him let's stand to our feet and musicians can come play that song O Come To The Altar and I'm not opening up this I mean hardly anybody comes this altar anyway you know a small church it's a small altar you know it's not even a big altar it's not even all the way across the front but like brother Ram says let's go to the altar of our hearts praise God what we learn of Christ were any of those areas important for you there's lots of things like he said the lonely one says come to me what about Jesus [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] the precious blood of Jesus Christ [Music] foreign [Music] everything is going crazy hey Jesus is born [Music] again we are together foreign [Music] isn't it rise this reason friends [Music] oh God [Applause] foreign running for Christ foreign [Music] thank you Lord for all thy children shall be taught over [Music] here every hour of my life even says Lord you're knocking every heart Lord God thank you Dragon Ball room [Music] so wonderful Lord as your spirit hear your voice saying [Music] worries the Bible says be anxious for nothing oh God that court on Sunday the nervous attention to this life help us to overcome cares of riches thank you oh thank you for this atmosphere the Holy Spirit when our doors of our hearts we say come on in Jesus [Music] I want to put this scripture into practice I just don't want to talk about it [Music] these things in Jesus Christ
