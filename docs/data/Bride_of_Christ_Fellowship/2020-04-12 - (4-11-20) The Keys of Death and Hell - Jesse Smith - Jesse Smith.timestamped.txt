[36:27] in your hands
[36:28] those nail-scarred hands in Jesus
[36:30] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[36:32] god bless yous being seated praise God
[36:44] so last night we looked at the Passion
[36:47] of Jesus Christ I've I've never really
[36:49] preached too detailed on the actual you
[36:53] know medical terminology of what he
[36:55] suffered but we looked at it last night
[36:56] and we're so thankful that he took our
[36:59] place
[37:00] you know Jesus had a cardiac arrest so
[37:02] we didn't have to praise God Jesus
[37:04] suffered the extreme dehydration so we
[37:07] didn't have to he bled the sweat drops
[37:10] of blood so we didn't have to and so
[37:13] we're thankful for that all that he did
[37:14] he became the god sacrifice taking all
[37:19] the Nick WA T of mankind upon him that
[37:21] we might receive his righteousness
[37:22] praise God
[37:24] hope that was a blessing to our hearts
[37:26] last night today I was listening to
[37:28] brother Graham preach the entombment I
[37:31] believe jeffersonville listen to that
[37:32] today or they're gonna listen to it
[37:34] tonight I get all the emails from
[37:35] Jefferson I'm signed up for their their
[37:38] email list cuz I'd like to know what
[37:39] they're doing I'm hoping that I can help
[37:41] correct them by God's grace I've tried
[37:43] it I'm gonna keep trying I'm hoping to
[37:46] one of these days to see a little
[37:47] correction there that they'll start
[37:48] changing their tune a little bit but
[37:50] it's a sermon from 1957 a beautiful
[37:52] message brother Branham preaches I think
[37:56] I'll just mention a few things before we
[37:58] get to the keys of death and Hell
[37:59] tonight it's a beautiful sermon brother
[38:04] Branham you know he talks about the
[38:06] absolute of the word we kinda looked at
[38:07] on Wednesday night the absolute and
[38:11] there's nice I got a preacher text me
[38:14] right afterwards and said I absolutely
[38:15] loved your sermon brother Jesse because
[38:18] it's about the absolute praise God it's
[38:19] about Jesus Christ amen
[38:21] he's our hamster there's only one one
[38:24] person who is the absolute that has
[38:26] unlimited power
[38:27] who's unlimited his judgment that's
[38:29] Christ amen so we know there's one
[38:32] absolute and so Jesus and as we saw last
[38:36] night he went the hardest road any man
[38:38] ever went no man had ever been beaten
[38:40] like him no man had suffered like him
[38:43] because Jesus said it was the power of
[38:46] darkness all the demons and
[38:48] gathered there you know and maybe not
[38:50] all but many demons had gathered there
[38:51] and anointed those Roman soldiers to
[38:53] beat him in a way that no man had ever
[38:55] been beaten he had to take the brunt of
[38:57] all sin the pall of the punishment for
[39:00] all mankind for all 6,000 years of human
[39:03] history and in church it gives us a
[39:04] clearer picture of what God thinks about
[39:06] sin God hates sin it's so it's
[39:09] completely opposite to his perfect
[39:11] nature
[39:12] he's so holy so when we look at Jesus
[39:15] Christ we see how ugly sin is when he
[39:17] died on the cross he had to be beaten as
[39:20] we said blindfolded and he couldn't roll
[39:22] with the punches it was even worse
[39:25] the abuse was worse than it could ever
[39:27] possibly be at least a boxer can kind of
[39:29] see when it's coming but Jesus was
[39:31] blindfolded and mocked and scourged in a
[39:34] way that no man had ever been beaten nor
[39:36] ever will be beaten before but he had to
[39:39] do that to show the ugliness of sin God
[39:41] had to show if I'm gonna judge sin this
[39:44] is what sin is gonna look like remember
[39:46] Moses put up the brass serpent member
[39:48] and that was a judgment a snake judge
[39:50] and that's what Christ Christ had to be
[39:52] the brass serpent raised up he had to be
[39:55] lifted up that would draw all men unto
[39:57] Him praise God oh there's no other story
[40:00] Church that will draw all men to God
[40:02] like the story of Jesus's crucifixion
[40:04] amen because he we find ourselves there
[40:08] we see uh we see ourselves as the Sheep
[40:11] running away all of us left him praise
[40:14] God he was despised of men we esteemed
[40:18] him not
[40:18] praise God just like all the women ran
[40:21] the men ran for that day and separated
[40:23] themselves they all ran eventually they
[40:26] came back we know but they all ran and
[40:28] here we esteemed him not we didn't care
[40:30] enough about him but we see what God
[40:33] thinks of sin and brother have said he
[40:35] died so much that even the son had to
[40:38] acknowledge it praise God amen a son
[40:41] that never breaks its pattern it'll
[40:43] never break its its pattern of day and
[40:45] night his ordinance it's always faithful
[40:48] in its ordinance and my man said he was
[40:50] so holy Jesus was so holy that the very
[40:53] son he created by the word amen because
[40:56] he was the word amen the very Sonny
[40:59] created had to just stop shining
[41:01] for three hours from 12 to 3 even the
[41:05] Sun all creation had to witness that the
[41:07] Creator was dying in the form of a man
[41:10] praise God
[41:11] we know the Creator can't die as a
[41:12] spirit of course so the Creator had to
[41:15] form himself a body he formed a body
[41:18] that he himself could take to the cross
[41:19] and when that word body that that
[41:22] perfect body died all the creation had
[41:25] to turn turn off right brother Adam even
[41:28] said God the Father had to turn away
[41:29] from his own son because he cried Jesus
[41:31] cried out my God my God why hast thou
[41:34] forsaken me
[41:35] the spirit turning away from the flesh
[41:37] all the sin of mankind was laid upon him
[41:41] and so brother Ram said not only nature
[41:43] had to witness he was God son so did all
[41:46] sinful humanity even the Roman soldier
[41:48] praised God Oh even the ones who didn't
[41:51] believe never believed God proved it so
[41:54] much that even sinners ranked sinners
[41:56] that were evil men that their whole job
[41:59] was to murder people on the cross there
[42:01] are an entire livelihood they made their
[42:04] money by killing people and God made
[42:06] them recognize that truly this man was
[42:08] the son of God amen he was so holy in
[42:11] his death he was so holy in his life he
[42:14] was so holy in his resurrection and I
[42:16] feel his holiness and I praise God amen
[42:19] thank the Lord and His Holiness is here
[42:22] for you and I tonight praise God he was
[42:25] so holy Butler and said when he was in
[42:28] the tomb when they laid his body in the
[42:31] tomb member from 3 to 6 o'clock they had
[42:34] three hours to take his body off the
[42:35] cross and to put it in Joseph of
[42:38] Arimathea stoom because he had to die on
[42:41] the Friday member Jewish days go from 6
[42:43] p.m. to 6 p.m. that's their day so a
[42:47] Jewish day their Saturday is already
[42:49] finished
[42:49] they're already started Sunday where as
[42:52] far as right now they've already started
[42:53] their Sunday so Jesus had to die and to
[42:57] give up the ghost at 3 o'clock I believe
[43:00] was it 3 or 12 I can't remember now I
[43:02] think it was 12 yeah it's 12 and so he I
[43:05] think was it 12 or 3 why can't I
[43:08] remember
[43:09] I study too much it got too much in
[43:11] there a little muddled in my mind
[43:14] but he had from 12 to 3 there was no
[43:17] light it was no Sun so from 3 to 6 that
[43:21] women took him down and spices prepared
[43:24] his body and took him to the tomb and
[43:26] had to hurry off because they could not
[43:27] work on a Sabbath day they could not be
[43:30] out and about doing any business than to
[43:32] be home by 6 o'clock and there and there
[43:34] they would rest they had to have all the
[43:37] unleavened bread ready all the the
[43:39] spices that have all but ready because
[43:41] all they could do on Saturday was
[43:43] resting can you imagine Mary see resting
[43:46] all day Saturday thinking about her son
[43:47] died on the cross and the light of the
[43:50] Sun light turned off for three hours can
[43:52] you imagine all the saints and what has
[43:54] happened here he was supposed to take
[43:56] over and they remember they didn't they
[43:58] didn't catch everything Jesus said
[43:59] remember we saw it last night he kept
[44:01] telling them the Son of Man has to
[44:03] suffer many things and then rise again
[44:04] and they didn't even catch it right
[44:07] because they're just human they were
[44:09] born again right and so can you imagine
[44:11] that Saturday no doubt they're they're
[44:14] sad they're hopeless they they're trying
[44:18] to understand what has happened now God
[44:20] just fulfilled all these scriptures and
[44:22] they don't even know what's going on oh
[44:24] my but God is faithful amen
[44:28] he's faithful to the believers even
[44:30] though they miss what he's doing many
[44:31] times that's what God does he fulfills
[44:33] his word and then tells everybody what
[44:35] he did praise God let me tell you
[44:37] there's gonna be one word that you and I
[44:39] if we're born again we won't miss and
[44:41] that will be the body change amen we
[44:44] won't be late on that one we won't list
[44:46] that one if we're born again the Bible
[44:48] said the Spirit of God will change us in
[44:50] the moment and the twinkling of an eye a
[44:52] man but after the rapture won't be one
[44:55] second late praise God he said
[44:57] everything is working
[44:59] he said perfectly everything is on time
[45:01] everything is working perfectly in God's
[45:04] plan amen hallelujah thank the Lord and
[45:08] I'll say I guess I'm glad he's tearing
[45:10] so that my children can get the Holy
[45:11] Ghost
[45:13] hallelujah so people can complain all
[45:15] they want I'm gonna rejoice praise God
[45:18] anyhow you tarry long enough so I could
[45:21] get the Holy Ghost I'm glad you didn't
[45:22] come in brother Rams Day because I
[45:24] wasn't here yet I would
[45:26] spirits I would have lived for Christ I
[45:27] would have died to myself I would have
[45:30] take up my cross and follow him daily
[45:31] praise God
[45:32] hey man I would have found this bloody
[45:35] footprints I wouldn't know him in the in
[45:37] the goo powers resurrection and the
[45:39] Fellowship of his sufferings praise God
[45:41] I want to know this Jesus
[45:42] I wouldn't know now in this life and I
[45:45] went on in the future for all eternity
[45:47] praise God
[45:48] I just want to know him because he's the
[45:50] lovely one he's the eternal one he's the
[45:52] absolute praise God I just want to know
[45:54] him my Creator my God my lord and my
[45:57] king praise God but listen Jesus was an
[46:01] idol when his body was in the tomb we
[46:05] think he was just laying there dead but
[46:07] he was down still conquering conquered
[46:13] everywhere he went brother Stephen
[46:14] healin he conquered everywhere amen no
[46:17] matter where he was if there's wine he
[46:19] conquered the water the water change it
[46:20] to behine praise God wherever he was
[46:23] where the dead he raised him up he was
[46:25] constantly conquering and even in his
[46:27] death he was conquering death praise God
[46:30] hey Ben he went down with medicine and
[46:34] took the keys away from Satan he's got
[46:36] the keys of both death and hell tonight
[46:39] he said because I live you can live also
[46:43] amen
[46:44] now this is a beautiful story now you
[46:47] know the story where brother man it's
[46:48] one of the most beautiful dramas I think
[46:50] I've ever heard preach is when rogram
[46:52] dramatizes Jesus going down to hell and
[46:56] then the paradise we'll get to that in
[46:57] just a moment I'm not gonna spend much
[46:59] time on that but I want you to see this
[47:02] here I want to just background and do
[47:04] some teaching through the Word of God to
[47:07] show us why Jesus had to do this why do
[47:10] you have to do this now
[47:13] how many no Hebrews 11:1 what does the
[47:16] Bible describe faith as faith is a what
[47:20] is it is it an invisible thing or is
[47:23] face something you can buy at the store
[47:24] no but it is a substance right faith is
[47:28] it a portion of the Holy Spirit faith is
[47:32] a substance of something spiritual it
[47:34] has to be a substance of the Holy Spirit
[47:36] because there's only two kind of spirits
[47:38] right there's only you
[47:40] spirits or the holy spirit praise God
[47:42] and and Paul says faith is a substance
[47:46] so the old let's look at the Old
[47:47] Testament believers here for a moment
[47:49] the Bible said Abraham is the father of
[47:52] us all and yet Abraham here could not be
[47:57] born again which is why Jesus Christ had
[47:59] to come in the first place the Holy
[48:02] Ghost could not be given until Jesus was
[48:05] glorified praise God that's John 7:37
[48:08] 239 so abraham like all men was born a
[48:12] sinner he had an inherent sin nature
[48:15] just like david row he said behold I was
[48:18] shapen iniquity and in sin did my mother
[48:20] conceive me and then Romans 3:23 says
[48:25] for all have sinned and come short of
[48:28] the glory of God Abraham was raised in
[48:31] the year of Chaldees which is a southern
[48:34] Babylonian city I believe modern-day
[48:36] Iraq even as a sinner
[48:38] Abraham's soul was thirsting for God
[48:41] because David said it's my soul that
[48:43] thirst for the Living God amen because
[48:46] member brother have said you got a
[48:47] natural thirst and you got a soul thirst
[48:49] praise God so Abraham had this time n
[48:52] we're gonna this is we're building why
[48:53] Jesus had to come the way he came so
[48:58] Abraham was thirsting for God but he had
[49:00] no faith at first his soul was in a
[49:03] state of unbelief because it didn't have
[49:05] the anointing of faith but one wonderful
[49:09] day in Mesopotamia the glory of God
[49:12] appeared to Abraham praise God and this
[49:15] said separate yourselves from your
[49:17] family and your kindred and go to a land
[49:20] that I'd called you to go and Abraham
[49:22] didn't question course we know he was
[49:24] Abram at that point he didn't question
[49:25] he said just said yes Lord I'll follow
[49:28] he didn't need all the details you know
[49:29] women I know my wife likes lots of
[49:31] details but Abraham didn't have many
[49:33] details to give to Sarah I write well
[49:36] where are we going I'm not sure I'm just
[49:37] following the Lord well how long we
[49:39] gonna go I'm not sure we're just gonna
[49:40] follow a little hard there was not many
[49:42] details but there's one thing's for sure
[49:44] he had God's Word he had in assurance he
[49:47] had faith in the promise of God amen he
[49:49] had a substance he didn't have many
[49:51] details but he had a substance that said
[49:53] this Way's right praise God that's what
[49:55] you and I know we come to this message
[49:57] we've come to the Word of God we can't
[49:59] explain everything but we know one thing
[50:01] we've got something inside of us that
[50:03] knows God's Word is true praise God amen
[50:06] and we're going to believe it with all
[50:07] of our hearts because the glory of God
[50:09] appeared to us like it did to Abraham
[50:12] praise God the Bible said every sinner
[50:17] is turned from the error of his way so
[50:20] Abram had to be turned from the he was
[50:22] going the wrong way he had to be turned
[50:24] from the error of his way and follow the
[50:26] Lord which he did the Bible said by
[50:29] faith Abraham when he was called to go
[50:31] out into a place which he should after
[50:33] receive for inheritance obeyed and he
[50:37] went out not knowing whither he went
[50:39] praise God we can just type in we can
[50:42] say hey phone tell me I need directions
[50:44] here there you have to worry about it we
[50:47] know where we're going he'll tell us
[50:48] right there where we're going
[50:49] Abraham didn't have that luxury praise
[50:50] God all she had was God's positioning
[50:54] system right the GPS God's positioning
[50:56] system that's all you had you had no
[50:58] idea to know he just obeyed God's Word
[51:01] and started walking praise God Amen like
[51:04] brother Branham in down south with that
[51:05] the black woman there right with the
[51:08] washed woman in Tennessee right the Holy
[51:11] Spirit just said start walking and he
[51:13] start walking praise God church that's
[51:15] about like my life the Holy Spirit tells
[51:16] me just start pastoring I don't know how
[51:18] long I don't know where but I'm gonna
[51:20] keep filing God's voice until he tells
[51:22] me something different praise God I
[51:23] don't know other details I don't know
[51:25] what's going to happen in this year that
[51:26] year we don't know what's going to
[51:28] happen but we can hear God's voice and
[51:30] we have a choice either disobey and run
[51:32] from it or obey it god help us to obey
[51:35] His Word amen
[51:36] praise the Lord he said I obeyed by
[51:39] faith he sojourned in the land of
[51:41] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[51:44] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[51:47] heirs with him of the same promise for
[51:49] he looked for a city which hath
[51:51] foundations whose builder and maker was
[51:54] God who never said he was looking all
[51:57] round like this
[51:57] he said all's he had to do was look up
[51:59] because the city was up it was the New
[52:01] Jerusalem Amen that's the real city he
[52:03] was looking for my
[52:05] oops four or five 3000 years in advance
[52:08] he's looking for where is this New
[52:10] Jerusalem where is it and it was in
[52:12] heaven but he was attached to it all my
[52:14] church you and I should be so happy
[52:16] because we've got a magnetic attraction
[52:18] a spiritual magnet that's attracted to
[52:21] the New Jerusalem praise God if Abraham
[52:24] had at most even and I'm a child of
[52:26] Abraham then I've got his same seed I've
[52:28] got the same magnet I'm connected to the
[52:31] future home praise God
[52:32] amen because I'm a child of Abraham on
[52:35] the sea the same seed of Abraham praise
[52:38] God hallelujah so see Abraham gets saved
[52:46] and now when he gets saved the Holy
[52:48] Spirit comes as a little anointing and
[52:51] it's like a seed that's fallen upon his
[52:53] soul yet that seed was not yet quickened
[52:57] we just say like this in other words
[52:59] there's not enough anointing there to
[53:01] quicken his soul we'll say like that but
[53:04] he has some anointing on this soul
[53:06] because the Bible says the Bible
[53:08] literally says Abraham was justified by
[53:12] faith Abraham was declared righteous in
[53:16] all the animal sacrifices he could offer
[53:18] God looked at him and said you're
[53:20] righteous the Bible calls lot righteous
[53:23] as well in second Peter 79 lot was a
[53:25] righteous man and a righteous soul so
[53:29] that means he didn't have a soul of
[53:30] unbelief he had a soul of faith and
[53:33] faith is a substance it's a spiritual
[53:36] anointing praise God but it wasn't the
[53:38] fullness of the anointing that was going
[53:40] to come later amen praise God
[53:45] now that see that they received a great
[53:48] potential amen hallelujah but it could
[53:51] not be quickened all the way here
[53:54] because the spiritual conditions weren't
[53:56] ready for it now let me give you a
[53:58] natural illustration anybody ever plant
[54:02] any seeds this spring my wife's planning
[54:03] numerous little seeds in these little
[54:05] containers right the natural seed lays
[54:08] dormant until three conditions are met
[54:11] right sufficient water sufficient light
[54:15] and fertile soil
[54:17] the spiritual seed of God's Word
[54:20] also needs three conditions met in
[54:23] Abraham's lifetime only two of the three
[54:26] conditions were present see the waters
[54:32] of the Spirit was available to believers
[54:34] his member David said remember David
[54:36] said my cup runneth over praise God
[54:39] amen the Holy Spirit waters were just
[54:42] running over his human spirit right
[54:44] his human mind he said my cup is running
[54:47] all over I'm just overflowing I dance
[54:49] and I sing and I praise God and I play
[54:51] the music and the instruments and I
[54:53] dance when the arts returning right he
[54:55] his cup ran over and he loved the Lord
[54:58] thank you Lord amen
[55:04] see their minds and bodies what could be
[55:07] anointed but the spiritual light and the
[55:11] fertile soil were unavailable so two out
[55:14] of the three conditions were unavailable
[55:15] and I'm gonna prove this by the word I
[55:18] mean maybe never heard this before but
[55:20] I'm taking this is like the revelation
[55:21] that comes to me as I'm writing this
[55:23] book here so David and even David and of
[55:28] course Abraham had the water the
[55:30] anointing would fall on them but they
[55:32] didn't have the two other conditions the
[55:35] spiritual light and the fertile grounds
[55:37] and you'll see what I mean in just a
[55:38] moment because the scripture will answer
[55:40] it to us now spiritual light they start
[55:44] with light first we have light and
[55:45] fertile soul the spiritual light is the
[55:48] knowledge of Jesus Christ and the
[55:50] forgiveness of his sins through the
[55:52] cross that specifically said in 2nd
[55:54] Corinthians 4:6 can you pull out their
[55:56] case you say Corinthians 4:6 Paul says
[55:59] the light of the knowledge of Jesus
[56:02] Christ has shined upon you praise God
[56:05] amen Abraham didn't have that knowledge
[56:07] of the Messiah as far as all the oh that
[56:11] his blood was going to accomplish
[56:13] because God command the light to shine
[56:16] of darkness has shined into our hearts
[56:18] to give us the light of the knowledge of
[56:20] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[56:22] Christ amen
[56:23] in other words we're looking in the face
[56:24] of Christ and his light is shining upon
[56:27] us a
[56:28] we're not looking away from Jesus we're
[56:30] not looking away from Jesus we're
[56:31] looking right at him we see him and that
[56:34] light shines upon our souls praise God
[56:36] amen
[56:38] I leave the area and what is soil soil
[56:42] is an honest and good heart in Luke 8:15
[56:45] can you pull that up there occasion Luke
[56:47] 8:15 this now this may be new to you but
[56:50] I think you'll see it the spiritual
[56:52] fertile soil was unavailable that's
[56:55] because the blood of bulls and goats
[56:58] could not purify the human heart and
[57:02] there's a lot of scripture on that
[57:04] church so see Abraham had the water but
[57:08] he didn't have the light of the
[57:10] knowledge of Christ all that he was
[57:11] going to accomplish and he didn't have
[57:14] the fertile soil but that on the good
[57:17] ground are they with you at the honest
[57:19] and good heart having heard the word
[57:20] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[57:22] patience praise God now the reason we
[57:30] say this is because the book of Hebrews
[57:33] 9 says that Abraham's flesh cannot be
[57:37] purified after animal sacrifice could
[57:39] you ball Ebers 9 900 but as human spirit
[57:44] or heart didn't completely feel good
[57:46] let's blow up Hebrews 9 here just for a
[57:49] moment Hebrews 9 9 let me pull it up
[57:51] here on my device here this was just a
[57:57] great blessing to me alright Hebrews 9
[58:07] 9 which was a figure for the time then
[58:09] present in which were offered both gifts
[58:11] and sacrifices that could not make him
[58:14] that did the service perfect as
[58:15] pertaining to the conscious now let's
[58:18] apply that church who's this speaking to
[58:20] anyone in the Old Testament anyone under
[58:24] the blood of bulls and goats they can
[58:26] make a sacrifice they could whether as a
[58:29] Turtledove or a heifer whatever was a
[58:32] goat a lamb but they would walk away and
[58:34] their conscience wasn't quite quite
[58:37] clean yet they still had a guilty
[58:39] conscience knowing I know I'm gonna go
[58:40] back and do this again and again and
[58:42] again and again can everybody say Amen
[58:45] see so Abraham see the conditions
[58:48] weren't right brother Stephen I hope
[58:50] everybody could see that the sea could
[58:52] not be totally quickened because the
[58:54] fertile ground wasn't there the blood of
[58:57] the animals couldn't take away their
[58:59] guilty conscience amen ah so Abraham
[59:04] would worship and he would sacrifice he
[59:06] feel forgiven because he know he's
[59:08] forgiven because God said so but in he
[59:11] still had a guilty conscience turn to
[59:15] Hebrews 10 3 so Keysha Hebrews 10 3 see
[59:21] Abraham would remember his sins year
[59:24] after year Hebrews 10 3 but in those
[59:27] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[59:30] made of sins every year right so so
[59:35] Abraham would sacrifice year after year
[59:37] verse 4 said it is not possible that the
[59:40] blood of bulls and goats should take
[59:42] away sin so his his conscience never got
[59:46] pure he never really felt like oh I feel
[59:48] clean before God in my mind and I know
[59:51] I'm gonna be a just different person
[59:53] right it's proof because he lied to the
[59:55] one king a few years later he lies to
[59:57] the other key see those sacrifices could
[1:00:00] have purified his soul because the life
[1:00:04] of the sacrifice couldn't come upon him
[1:00:06] uh-huh but it comes upon you and I thank
[1:00:09] God hallelujah see animal blood in
[1:00:14] church this is the Bible animal but
[1:00:16] blood does purge your flesh but not your
[1:00:20] human spirit
[1:00:21] see with the unclean when spear God
[1:00:25] cannot baptize Abraham's human soul with
[1:00:28] the Holy Spirit nor even his human
[1:00:32] spirit did you catch that even Abraham's
[1:00:34] human spirit couldn't be baptized with
[1:00:37] the Holy Ghost because the blood of
[1:00:39] bulls and goats can never take away his
[1:00:41] guilty conscience and we just sang about
[1:00:43] that church that hear all my shame is
[1:00:46] gone at the cross shame and sin cannot
[1:00:50] exist at the cross of Christ amen it
[1:00:53] can't because he paid for it's all right
[1:00:55] there and it's all paid for and it has
[1:00:58] to be sent away praise God a man like
[1:01:01] the like to go right like the scapegoat
[1:01:03] there's two goats one of the goats would
[1:01:05] live one of the goats would die the one
[1:01:07] that would die the high priests put his
[1:01:09] hands on his head and confess all of his
[1:01:11] sins and all of Israel's sins and they
[1:01:14] sent him away until he fell over a cliff
[1:01:16] they forced him to fall over Duke lift
[1:01:18] till until he until he's totally out of
[1:01:20] the country and the word came back and
[1:01:22] said the sins been paid for the sins
[1:01:25] paid for and it comes all the way back
[1:01:26] to the temple where the people would
[1:01:29] receive it and say we're forgiven but in
[1:01:32] all reality they're conscious never got
[1:01:34] purged because it's impossible for the
[1:01:38] blood of a goat to take away your sins
[1:01:40] but it's possible because the goat was
[1:01:42] guilty right a goats not perfect but
[1:01:44] it's possible when a perfect sacrifice
[1:01:46] dies for an imperfect one that God
[1:01:49] imputes that righteousness unto the
[1:01:52] sinner praise God through a
[1:01:54] substitutionary word praise God amen
[1:01:57] I don't need it because the the full
[1:01:59] price of sin has now been paid
[1:02:03] hallelujah yea now joel has two
[1:02:10] scriptures that show he never felt just
[1:02:13] with God
[1:02:14] pull up job 9 - did you know that church
[1:02:17] joke never really felt equal God said
[1:02:20] you're perfect by the animal sacrifice
[1:02:21] as far as I do forgive you through this
[1:02:23] temporary way of animal blood but Joel
[1:02:26] never felt just with God he couldn't he
[1:02:30] couldn't because the animal blood
[1:02:32] couldn't purge his mind it
[1:02:34] couldn't wash away his mind now look
[1:02:37] what he says I know it is so of a truth
[1:02:39] but how shall man be just with God God
[1:02:42] had already called him perfect remember
[1:02:44] chapter 1 remember chapter 2 God said
[1:02:46] you're forgiven by the animal blood your
[1:02:48] perfect
[1:02:48] but Joey still doesn't feel just you
[1:02:51] don't feel justified or right with God
[1:02:53] you and I have such a privilege we can
[1:02:56] actually feel right with God today we
[1:02:58] can act like we just read our memory
[1:03:00] verse right we can think on good things
[1:03:02] and the Bible says when we think on
[1:03:04] things that are true the peace of God
[1:03:06] that passes all understanding keep your
[1:03:09] hearts and minds through Jesus Christ
[1:03:11] amen oh sorry
[1:03:13] Joe couldn't have it David couldn't have
[1:03:15] it Abraham couldn't have it Adam and Eve
[1:03:17] couldn't have it but we can have it
[1:03:19] praise God that's exactly what the Word
[1:03:22] of God says amen oh thank you lord
[1:03:27] job said I just don't feel right with
[1:03:30] God of course he couldn't job said I
[1:03:34] need a mediator pull up verse 33 job
[1:03:37] 9:33 he says I need a mediator isn't
[1:03:39] there something that can stand before me
[1:03:41] and a holy God job 933 neither is there
[1:03:48] any days men be Twix us that might lay
[1:03:51] his hand upon both of us right don't
[1:03:55] just want somebody to say hey can you be
[1:03:57] a mediator can you talk to this holy God
[1:03:59] for me because I can't I need someone to
[1:04:01] come stand in the way someone that knows
[1:04:04] when I go through oh holy God does it
[1:04:07] know right the invisible spirit doesn't
[1:04:10] know what it's like to be tempted so the
[1:04:12] invisible spirit had to build himself a
[1:04:14] body praise God a body that could be
[1:04:16] tempted and now this high priest this
[1:04:18] body can stand between us and the holy
[1:04:21] God and bridge the way and forgive us
[1:04:24] praise God because he can relate to what
[1:04:26] we went through and he can give us
[1:04:28] victory to overcome what we're battling
[1:04:30] praise God hey man
[1:04:33] Oh hallelujah
[1:04:36] thank the Lord David said the same thing
[1:04:40] David said if thou Lord should mark
[1:04:43] iniquities O Lord who shall stand see
[1:04:47] they could they and if anybody sacrifice
[1:04:49] animals it was David and Solomon and yet
[1:04:51] David still saying who can stand before
[1:04:53] God no matter how many animals I
[1:04:54] sacrifice I can't do it because they
[1:04:57] could have the blood didn't have the
[1:04:59] power David said in thy sight shall no
[1:05:02] man livin be justified Paul even said
[1:05:06] that the law couldn't justify believers
[1:05:09] by the deeds of the law there should be
[1:05:11] no flesh justified in his sight mine so
[1:05:15] see Church you know all through the Old
[1:05:17] Testament see how these believers they
[1:05:19] had anointings on them but when that
[1:05:21] anointing left they didn't even feel
[1:05:22] like they were really saved right they
[1:05:25] did awful things like when David lost
[1:05:26] anointing adultery murder
[1:05:28] Abraham lost the anointing lie lie right
[1:05:32] Sarah lost anointing laugh at God and
[1:05:34] lied to God's face and God had mercy on
[1:05:37] it see because they didn't have the
[1:05:40] opportunity their sacrifices weren't
[1:05:43] powerful enough the Bible said Abraham
[1:05:47] and the Old Testament Saints lived a
[1:05:49] life that was subject to bondage and the
[1:05:52] fear of death due to the weakness of
[1:05:54] animal sacrifices they were always
[1:05:55] scared oh my god oh we're gonna die am i
[1:05:58] right with god they just lived
[1:06:00] constantly under fear
[1:06:02] that's why church they would cry so lo
[1:06:04] remember I've run it this week they
[1:06:06] cried a month for Aaron I think it was
[1:06:08] three months for Moses would he die they
[1:06:11] were just cry and wail because it was
[1:06:12] such a sad thing like there was
[1:06:14] uncertainty they didn't feel forgiven oh
[1:06:17] my but we can go to funerals we can cry
[1:06:20] for our loved ones in a second later we
[1:06:23] can raise our hands that they thank God
[1:06:24] we know where they're at Jesus paid for
[1:06:27] their sins and the Bible said to me to
[1:06:29] die here is to be present with the Lord
[1:06:31] praise God amen what a blessing praise
[1:06:37] the Lord
[1:06:41] the Bible said the law was a
[1:06:43] schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ
[1:06:46] it's a strict teacher right this
[1:06:48] business this is you're wrong you're
[1:06:50] wrong you sinned again you're sinned
[1:06:51] again you send again and it was a
[1:06:53] teacher to show us we need grace amen
[1:06:57] we need grace the weak animal sacrifices
[1:07:01] just showed our constant need for for
[1:07:04] forgiveness and mercy and mercy because
[1:07:07] we were so guilty guilty guilty all the
[1:07:09] time
[1:07:12] Church we know Satan stands like an
[1:07:15] accuser of the Brethren
[1:07:16] does he not praise God he stands there
[1:07:21] accusing us and what a look at his
[1:07:25] scripture here if you could pull this up
[1:07:27] Colossians 2:14 yea Colossians 2:14
[1:07:35] let's put that up there now here's what
[1:07:39] Jesus did on the cross he blotted out
[1:07:42] the handwriting of Ordinances that was
[1:07:45] against us now how do you blot out
[1:07:48] handwriting you got to erase it right or
[1:07:50] you got to mark all over it what is the
[1:07:52] blood of Jesus Christ dude it erases
[1:07:54] praise God it washes away all sins Amen
[1:07:57] you saw like we saw last night a
[1:07:59] fountain has open now in the house of
[1:08:02] the Gentiles praise God there's a
[1:08:04] fountain of Mercy flowing out of here
[1:08:06] you can be forgiven you can feel loved
[1:08:08] you can feel accepted you can know
[1:08:11] you're going to heaven it's a fountain
[1:08:12] flowing today praise God Amen hallelujah

[1:08:20] but a man said he first stopped at those
[1:08:23] that rejected in Noah's day but ran said
[1:08:26] that was his first stop he said he

[1:08:40] door in their faces and as he went down

[1:08:44] he condemned every demon tuberculosis
[1:08:46] cancer

[1:12:30] hope church that's right you can open
[1:12:32] you could see it now the Old Testament
[1:12:33] Saints they they didn't have the holy
[1:12:35] blood that you know that all the

[1:12:39] still had them the whole time they're
[1:12:41] even up there living oh I got I tricked

[1:13:20] what somebody's going to pay
[1:13:22] if nobody's gonna pay 75 or 100 then
[1:13:25] it's not worth that much right it's only
[1:13:28] worth what you pay for it
[1:13:30] right like they say like my dad always
[1:13:32] told me you get what you pay for
[1:13:34] if it's a high cost that it must be

[1:13:57] more than a food a few bullets a few
[1:13:59] hundred thousand bullets you're much
[1:14:01] more than that you were worth the price
[1:14:03] of his son praise God
[1:14:05] his holy sinless obedient son that's
[1:14:10] your value don't ever forget how
[1:14:12] valuable you are because God he emptied
[1:14:14] heaven of his son praise God right his
[1:14:16] son came down and he emptied him
[1:14:19] bankrupt heaven sent his son down that
[1:14:21] he might pay the price for our sins

[1:14:36] Amos never ending amen
[1:14:38] we're just starting it here this is just
[1:14:40] a foretaste this is just a first root of
[1:14:43] the Fellowship we're gonna have with
[1:14:45] Jesus for all eternity praise God Amen
[1:14:48] this is the very slow a little portion I
[1:14:50] can't wait to get the phonus of it
[1:14:52] praise God amen to see the one that I've
[1:14:56] served these years just to see him and
[1:14:58] lay at his feet and I program said just
[1:15:00] lay on his feet for a thousand years
[1:15:01] it'll be worth it all day and praise God
[1:15:03] to see his face and to know that he is

[1:15:09] this world he's the only love in this
[1:15:11] world praise God the only one worth
[1:15:13] living for praise God
[1:15:15] a man because he is truth thy Word is
[1:15:18] truth all other religions and runes and
[1:15:21] doctrines and and denominations they
[1:15:24] have lies in them but ours has the truth
[1:15:27] praise God amen we believe it's all true
[1:15:30] to the ability God will let us
[1:15:33] have it praise God what I mean is we
[1:15:36] don't know every answer to every
[1:15:37] question what our doctrines are all true
[1:15:39] praise God
[1:15:41] amen I believe that with all my heart
[1:15:44] think about it serpent seed Godhead
[1:15:47] church ages seals modesty hair length
[1:15:51] holiness righteousness look at all her
[1:15:54] doctrines they are truly the word amen
[1:15:56] they're truly God's Word as I told that
[1:16:01] one gentleman on the podcast I said the
[1:16:03] beautiful thing about the message is you
[1:16:04] don't have to say the word William
[1:16:06] Branham to teach it now I'm a pretty
[1:16:09] soon remember it like it was me they
[1:16:10] didn't tell me William Branham at first
[1:16:11] but after I'm like this is too much
[1:16:13] where'd this come from I know this is
[1:16:16] gonna come from you where did it come
[1:16:18] from oh that's oh yeah William Branham
[1:16:20] that's right now other people like that
[1:16:22] remember that Mike guy it was the guy
[1:16:26] from your the pastor from your city
[1:16:28] Mansfield the pastor there witnessed
[1:16:30] that Mike girdle he was a homosexual he
[1:16:32] gave him a card about brother Branham
[1:16:33] and that caused him to write a letter to
[1:16:35] Jeffersonville get a book and he got
[1:16:36] saved so see it doesn't matter how you
[1:16:39] come in but what matters is you're
[1:16:42] searching for truth and there's only one
[1:16:44] truth there's only one absolute that's
[1:16:46] Christ our Lord doesn't matter how you
[1:16:48] come in but the beauty of it is is God's
[1:16:50] Word it defends itself
[1:16:53] there's no contradictions praise God and
[1:16:55] it produces a holy man's taste amen

[1:18:42] out his blood for you and I and that was
[1:18:45] sufficient payment praise God Holy
[1:18:47] Innocents son of God Lamb of God holy
[1:18:50] innocent man that is a valuable payment
[1:18:53] the Bible said it's an incorruptible
[1:18:55] payment for our sins ain't ahead oh
[1:18:57] thank you lord
[1:18:58] precious blood precious blood redeem
[1:19:05] means to release the receipt of ransom
[1:19:09] so when Christ redeemed us he paid he
[1:19:13] paid for us and got the receipt
[1:19:14] that's what ransom means I paid and I
[1:19:17] got the receipt
[1:19:18] I didn't hear ya I paid for it I got
[1:19:21] proof that I paid for it praise God he
[1:19:24] got proof because the Bible said he had
[1:19:26] proof because he rose Amen
[1:19:28] that was his proof he came back amen
[1:19:32] he invaded hail Saints and then he come
[1:19:35] back to tell about it praise God he came
[1:19:37] to back he came so look I got the keys
[1:19:39] of death and hell death can't hold me
[1:19:41] down praise God you know why because
[1:19:43] death was made for sinners and Jesus
[1:19:46] Christ wasn't a sinner
[1:19:47] so death couldn't hold him because he
[1:19:49] died here in a state where he should not
[1:19:53] have died death can only he that sinneth
[1:19:55] shall die right the soul that sinneth it
[1:19:57] shall die well jesus never sinned so
[1:20:00] death could never hold and praise God
[1:20:01] hey man that's why I took the power of
[1:20:04] death himself and now he has control
[1:20:06] over death and hell hey man thank the
[1:20:10] Lord
[1:20:11] that's our Lord hallelujah
[1:20:16] and that's why Abraham and all of us his
[1:20:19] godly friends were all kept in that
[1:20:21] bosom cuz they were they didn't have a
[1:20:23] valuable they were they weren't redeemed
[1:20:25] their price was them paid the the
[1:20:27] handwriting was still against them the
[1:20:29] blood of bulls and goats couldn't wash
[1:20:31] it away
[1:20:32] it couldn't cleanse it Satan had brought
[1:20:36] all men's souls into bondage when he
[1:20:38] overcame Adam right in the Garden of
[1:20:41] Eden at the beginning but the Bible said
[1:20:44] in acts 20:28 Christ purchased the
[1:20:47] church with his own blood praise God
[1:20:50] dying and the since and since the wages
[1:20:54] of sin was death death was an innocent
[1:20:56] substitute it was a lawful payment for
[1:21:00] the redemption of believing Souls the
[1:21:02] wages of sin is death right the wages of
[1:21:07] sin is death
[1:21:08] so Christ's blood was a substitute and a
[1:21:12] lawful payment to cover our sins and
[1:21:16] redeem us because he died he died
[1:21:19] unjustly praise God he died and should
[1:21:22] not have died hallelujah jesus said the
[1:21:27] Son of man came not to be ministered to
[1:21:28] but to minister and give his life for a
[1:21:32] ransom from
[1:21:33] uh-uh praise God Jesus wasn't telling
[1:21:37] her but hey come sir me come come make
[1:21:39] my life easier he wouldn't say that he
[1:21:40] was ministering to them he was he see so
[1:21:43] I come to give my life for you praise
[1:21:45] God that's what our Lord did hallelujah
[1:21:55] yes
[1:21:57] scripture declared Hebrews 9:22 without
[1:22:01] shedding of blood is no remission God
[1:22:04] had this eternal law his law in heaven
[1:22:06] there's their sins of Abraham and Jove
[1:22:09] and David cannot be remitted until blood
[1:22:11] is shed and so Jesus Christ paid the
[1:22:15] price now with some corruptible kind of
[1:22:18] payment that anybody could pay he paid
[1:22:20] it with special payment an incorruptible
[1:22:22] blood praise God hallelujah what a
[1:22:27] blessing let me see where I want to
[1:22:31] close here how the different scriptures
[1:22:33] I want to see Jesus Christ blood was so
[1:22:36] powerful he nailed that list two of our
[1:22:39] sins of the cross and blotted it all out
[1:22:42] also put up Ephesians 2:14 also we as
[1:22:51] Gentiles we all had a big problem our
[1:22:54] problem was we didn't have any covenants
[1:22:55] right we've been preaching on the
[1:22:56] covenants lately right on the Sunday
[1:22:58] night our problem was were Gentiles we
[1:23:00] hadn't known the Bible said no hope no
[1:23:02] covenants no God no nothing but the
[1:23:06] Bible says when Jesus died look at this
[1:23:08] verse 14 for he is our peace who have
[1:23:11] made both one and hath broken down the
[1:23:14] middle wall of partition between us the
[1:23:18] the law had built up this wall like like
[1:23:21] the tables of stone that you could
[1:23:22] imagine that Moses held they were like a
[1:23:24] law saying stay out stay out
[1:23:26] but when Jesus died on the cross he said
[1:23:28] I'm not just dying for Jews I'm dying
[1:23:31] for Gentiles praise God
[1:23:33] so the handwriting was blotted out and
[1:23:36] the wall came falling down I wonder if
[1:23:38] that's why there was an earthquake
[1:23:38] praise God because there is a spiritual
[1:23:41] wall that fell down praise God
[1:23:44] and then we
[1:23:45] now we can come in there's no more while
[1:23:47] I'm ahead
[1:23:48] if there's a wall like Trump's building
[1:23:50] the wall it keeps people out but if the
[1:23:53] wall falls down now we have access now
[1:23:55] we can come in now we can know what
[1:23:58] God's Word is all about we can have
[1:24:00] confidence we can have promises we can
[1:24:02] have assurance that heaven will accept
[1:24:04] us praise God amen and not only that but
[1:24:09] here's the one thing my wife reminded me
[1:24:10] not only did that wall fall down the
[1:24:13] veil got torn in two and now God say he
[1:24:16] used to say stay out but now you say
[1:24:18] come on in I want my life to dwell in
[1:24:22] your soul praise God I want to feel
[1:24:24] every fiber of your be come on in more
[1:24:27] than just clean your flesh I want to
[1:24:29] clean your mind more than that I want to
[1:24:31] clean your soul praise God amen so your
[1:24:35] nature is God's nature no longer yours
[1:24:38] but now it's God's amen
[1:24:41] look at all those things the handwriting
[1:24:43] up blotted out the wall fell down the
[1:24:45] veil torn he was tearing up all hell's
[1:24:48] powers amen he conquered death in the
[1:24:51] hell mighty Conqueror Jesus Christ amen

[1:26:28] especially in this hour we have nothing
[1:26:30] to to discourage us we should remember
[1:26:33] that he's alive and well and he has the
[1:26:36] keys of death and he'll praise God as I
[1:26:41] close I'm not sure which I wonder which
[1:26:47] one I want to close with here at church
[1:26:54] I don't know how God does this but here
[1:26:57] let me just finish with this thought
[1:26:59] here I'll go to more thoughts just real
[1:27:02] quickly program said after Jesus
[1:27:04] defeated Satan he took the keys of death
[1:27:07] and hell he blotted out all the
[1:27:09] handwriting he went over but Ram said he
[1:27:11] knocked on Abraham's door he said
[1:27:13] Abraham looked out and said ah that's
[1:27:15] the one who sat with me under the oak
[1:27:17] tree that's the one that discerned my
[1:27:19] wife saw her Sarah look that's him and
[1:27:23] brother Aaron goes through all the
[1:27:24] scenes right Daniel saw him as a stone
[1:27:26] coming out of the mountain right
[1:27:29] Ezekiel saw him as a meat or wheel in
[1:27:31] the middle of a wheel I still don't
[1:27:32] understand that if somebody could
[1:27:33] explain that to me I'd appreciate that
[1:27:35] way up in the middle there I don't
[1:27:37] understand what that's like when he's a
[1:27:38] wheel as a wheel and everyone that Joel
[1:27:40] said that's the Redeemer I saw him and
[1:27:43] I'm gonna stay with him on the earth and
[1:27:45] mother said he didn't know it but he
[1:27:46] said I'm gonna be doing it in 15 minutes
[1:27:48] for his God amen
[1:27:50] John's like 15 minutes I'll be standing
[1:27:53] with him on the earth praise God brother
[1:27:58] said Jesus had to come in and he had
[1:28:00] announced he said I'm here I'm the
[1:28:02] virgin born son of God but RAM said it
[1:28:03] repeats he said my blood is still wet on
[1:28:06] the cross now look how fast brother look
[1:28:08] how fast Jesus moves in the theophany
[1:28:10] Jesus bodies still probably hanging up
[1:28:12] there but yet his Souls already down
[1:28:14] there in hell cleaning it up praise God
[1:28:16] tearing it up amen he said my blood is
[1:28:19] still wet because he's in theophany 4
[1:28:21] because remember they travel a lot
[1:28:23] faster in a dimension we got to speed up
[1:28:25] when these days were gonna speed up
[1:28:26] praise God if we see the rapture in our
[1:28:28] data will speed up right and they'll
[1:28:31] slow down that song so Jesus is worries
[1:28:35] we tell him I've redeemed you and Bob
[1:28:38] Anderson they all rejoice and they'll
[1:28:40] say let Jesus let's go come with me
[1:28:42] Abraham and Sarah say oh Jesus we loved
[1:28:46] our life so much in that Promised Land
[1:28:48] can we make a whistle-stop there and
[1:28:51] Jesus said yes that yep that works
[1:28:53] perfectly with my plan I wanted to show
[1:28:55] myself alive for 40 days he said yes
[1:28:57] Abraham that would work out perfectly
[1:28:59] look how Jesus you know Abraham had the
[1:29:03] mind of Christ God they on the same
[1:29:05] Mountain praise God and on resurrection
[1:29:10] morning Christ rose first they make and
[1:29:12] then all the Saints rows and were seen
[1:29:15] of many praised God and then Jesus forty
[1:29:18] days later he showed himself the
[1:29:21] disciples program said the disciples on
[1:29:24] that mountain they didn't see all the
[1:29:26] saints ascend they only saw Jesus
[1:29:28] ascends which is interesting the Bible
[1:29:32] said Jesus left on a white cloud the
[1:29:37] Bible said when he has sent it up on
[1:29:39] high he led captivity captive so pretty
[1:29:43] soon after he got out of the other sight
[1:29:44] in the clouds he said Abraham Isaac
[1:29:47] Jacob job come on boy Sarah come on
[1:29:49] Rebecca come on we're going home now
[1:29:51] praise God and Abraham you're going to
[1:29:55] be closer to that City you're looking
[1:29:56] for praise God amen he wasn't close
[1:29:59] threw it down the heart of the earth but
[1:30:01] now he's closer than he ever has been
[1:30:03] before
[1:30:04] and let me say that's Church we're
[1:30:05] closer to the rapture that we ever been
[1:30:07] before praise God amen
[1:30:10] we're so close praise God it may be
[1:30:12] another five years ten hundred who knows
[1:30:14] but we're closer than we ever made we
[1:30:16] should be on fire for Christ hallelujah
[1:30:24] well the mayor said Jesus Scott joined
[1:30:26] by all the Saints said come on Bob said
[1:30:31] Jesus lead or brother I said that you
[1:30:33] let him pass you know the Milky Way and
[1:30:35] I don't know how that possible God does
[1:30:39] it he's so great he goes best all the
[1:30:41] moon and the stars and all these things
[1:30:42] he goes in that other dimension and then
[1:30:46] Psalms 40:24 7 through 10 Psalms 24 7 to
[1:30:57] 10 brother Branham brings out this
[1:31:01] scripture and said this is the
[1:31:03] conversation that Christ had and the
[1:31:06] Saints and the angel doorkeepers as they
[1:31:08] came into heaven this is the
[1:31:10] conversation praise God but ransom the
[1:31:14] Saints start realizing they're getting
