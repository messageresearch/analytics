large thank you sir let's go to proverbs chapter 31 3 verse 12 we read verse 12 and then skip down to verse 34 our text this morning like to continue on the proverbs 31 woman we started that a few weeks ago about two weeks ago by God's grace I'd like to continue on that thought so you know I was thinking this is kinda like a Mother's Day message so if I don't preach a Mother's Day theme on Mother's Day well you got it a little early this year and who doesn't like early presents you know I I sure like early presents don't you so we'll see what the Lord has for us but just feeling you know really inspired here and in the Proverbs and really been blessed by the messages the Lord has given to us praise God proverbs 31 12 and then we'll go down to verse 30 these are the two attributes or these are the two foundations of a woman's life these two because these two are like the bookshelves or the bookends on a book on a bookshelf these hold this this portion together these two hold it together verse 12 let's read that together on three one two three she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life now let's go down to verse 30 let's read that on three one two three favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised amen these two scriptures are like the bookends of our lives remember this applies not only to natural women but to the church as well for the church is the wife of Christ that's just bow our heads you haven't eaten your heart just make it known unto the Lord as we approach the Word of God Father in heaven we thank you Lord again for today open our eyes Lord we want to see you this morning open our ears we want to hear you this morning that's all we ask Lord God is that we could experience fellowship we could experience communion with the eternal God who has revealed his name as the Lord Jesus Christ we're so grateful Lord for your spirit that we feel Lord God I'm humbled in your presence Lord God it's a sacred feeling Lord I never get used to it Lord God never Lord because I'm made of flesh Lord we're but Lord inside we grown to be clothed upon the body that's eternal in the heavens Lord God we desire that we're groaning for that Lord God how we love your presence dear God and we rejoice in your word Heavenly Father speak to us Lord through this Mother's Day message Lord God and help the whole church Lord all the brothers as well to see how our part is so crucial Lord God and as we Lord our types of the church or the Bride of Christ help us all to receive from thee this morning Lord let us hear thy voice loud and clear in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you two being seated praise the Lord so we're just grateful to be here in the service of the Lord this morning and looking forward to communion tonight by God's grace maokai you can switch over when you're ready I'd prepared some slides and things some thoughts and I would like to preach these this morning by the grace the Lord I'm gonna send time or two I don't want to wear myself out today a couple years ago I lost my voice from preaching so hard from song leading so hard and I told the Lord I would never push myself too hard again if he could help me by His grace I got a I got a control my zeal so help me Jesus so we look at this well let's look at this is part 2 of the proverbs 31 woman but part 7 of the series so like to look at this thought and then tonight I don't know what I'm going to preach tonight I've just got numerous thoughts scattered so I need to get back to the church early and pray a little more and I'm not sure what I'm going to minister on to night so we'll see what the Lord has for us here so we read our text this morning you know these are the two foundations of a woman's testimony we also say the church you know this is the foundation now remember part one we a couple weeks ago we looked at the origin or author or the background of chapter 31 was either it was either Solomon or some proselyte king named lemuel I believe I'm more lean towards Solomon it just doesn't really make a whole lot of sense that there would be a proselyte king who was a Jew and then he wrote he had so much wisdom about a woman it would seem like Solomon would get that wisdom because he was the wisest man of all that's what it would seem like to me but I don't know for sure but anyways we saw the path of wisdom wisdom starts with God in this chapter wisdom starts with God and then it comes down to a mother a mother who made a vow and said God if you give me a son I know he's gonna be king I'll teach him the ways of God so in this chapter the wisdom went from God to a mother who made a vow for a son to be a faithful king and then the king would take this wisdom that he received from his mother no doubt later his tutors and his father but remember mothers the the first gospel or the fifth gospel right the first one that gets to the child or the RAM said before Matthew Mark Luke and John get their mother gets their amen and then that King would influence the entire nation remember this nation was a kingdom of king of kings and priests we know the Levites were the the Levitical priesthood the Aaronic priesthood we'd say but really every true believer in Israel was a king and priests unto God Amen just like us today we're kings and priests unto God hallelujah and so God determined this is the way wisdom would flow here in Israel this time or if it was a proselyte king in another nation remember there was that he she said this is the words of my prophecy so we saw it was prophetic if it applied to Solomon the because the the mother said ask for wisdom asked for judgment have a voice for the poor we saw how Solomon asked for wisdom later on he asked to judge this great people and then he and then he judged the harlots the right way you know so it seems prophetic and and also it seems prophetic in a sad way like a warning to Solomon who fell to women because the mother said stay away from wine and women all Kings need to stay away from strange women and excess wine so it seems prophetic in that way as well and then we ended by showing how these were a mother's words to her son the future King I'm sorry I kind of went over that already and then we ended with this how chapter 31 from verses I believe it's 10 all the way to 31 is an acrostic poem of the virtuous woman which means that every sentence begins with a different Hebrew letter all the Hebrew letters of the alphabet so this is what we're this is a nice picture I found on on Google so it starts with a woman of Valor who can finds that's one that's one Hebrew letter and so the rest of the the chapter each sentence begins with a different Hebrew letter that's quite a challenge if you tried to try to write a sentence about you're trying to try to round a poem about your spouse and begin every sentence with a different letter of the alphabet it was considered a highly skillful thing to do and we find the greatest poetry in God's Bible amen not Shakespeare or Homer her Iliad and he's they not like that the greatest poetry and writings are recording this Holy Bible that were so grateful to hold this morning amen so that's what we're saying an acrostic poem so in other words this is a poem about the A to Z of a godly woman and remember brother ram said Christ is the A to Z he is the Alpha and Omega so if this applies to a woman then this must mean that his bra has his full characteristics Amen now only Jesus had the full characteristics of the Father he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily but the bride so from we'd say from Ephesus to Laodicea the bride of all ages she would we say has the full characteristics of Christ's character because every one of her members was in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world amen and the Bible said that Jesus chose us in him before the foundation of the world so all that Christ was all these characteristics all these desires he had he knew his wife would fully Express his character over the course of the Gentile church age Amen hallelujah she's in the word all the ways we saw that quote from the prophet of God that's why she's born again of the Holy Ghost she's washed by his blood and his all fare remember in the Song of Solomon I preached on that quite a few years ago now but but in one of the chapters it starts off with the husband and he he goes from feet to head and just lists all the beautiful things about her and then the bride takes her turn and she lists all the beautiful things about her husband and that's a great type of Christ who he loves everything abroad his bride amen she's all fair she's all beautiful she's all clean she's all holy amen she's all washed hallelujah she's expressing all of Christ's character to the world and so now you have an idea of this acrostic poem it's the A to Z and this that this then this this poem then shows all that a godly woman could accomplish in her life and I know how our sisters want to be godly women or else you wouldn't be here as as personal as the Word of God is you know how it cuts at men and women but especially at women in this we'd say this culture that seeks to magnify beauty and power and authority and influence and all these things that it magnifies for women in the of this dark lair to see an age god bless our sisters for wanting to be real proverbs 31 women amen and not being tempted by the things of the world but walking in the straight and narrow because even churches will tell you today oh it's okay for a woman to do this and okay for a woman to do that but we must look to the Word of God to give us all the answers to what type of characteristics a Christian woman should express hallelujah now let's we'll start working our way through here by God's grace so this is an acrostic poem and it's of an extremely rare and valuable life okay so in other words this woman is going to be very hard to find there's not many like this woman so she's hard to find and her price is far above rubies the Bible said who can find a virtuous woman her price is not just the price of rubies but far above rubies so brothers have you got a godly wife on the way home you should give her a little back massage with one hand if that's safe for you and you driver just recognize you're sitting next to millions of dollars how many believe that it's far above now not just Ruby Ruby's I'm going to show you the value of one carat of one Ruby and now my daughter fear not now this is speaking of the virtue who can find a virtuous woman Ruth was this way and Boaz says I will do to the all that thou requires amen I hope we have that desire this morning amen that Christ can do everything we require what Christ can meet all of our needs we just gotta ask him amen this is where she laid herself she was at the end of a rope she she that of a road she laid herself at the feet of Boaz and said I need a husband I need a kinsman Reid praise God I need someone to take care of me I need a family I need a future hallelujah in church we've got the lay ourselves at the feet of Christ's Alleluia and know that he'll give us all we require amen not everything we want but everything we require because all the city everybody knows that you're a virtuous woman everybody knows si Boaz was willing to meet her requests because everybody knew she was a strong godly Jewish woman Amen everybody knows she lived the life before everyone remember she would follow with the other maidens the Bible said I was reading that in Chapter two she would just follow the other maidens and he's met these maidens were you know either female daughters unmarried or they were female slaves and and they would follow after the other harvesters and there'd be a little glean over here a little you know barley over here they picked that little one up and they were that they didn't have a big job they actually had just a hard job they just had to go and get the scraps but thank God the children still get the scraps that fall from the master's table they had how do ya amen and she she would just follow right along with them she could have went out to other men's fields she could have went to other denominations right she could have went to other churches but she stayed in the field of Boaz her kinsman redeemer praise God and everybody knew what kind of life she lived and listened church everybody knows what kind of life you live all right how do we express it everyday we express it every week every every decision we make expresses what kind of life is inside us and everybody knows what kind of virtue we have and that means strength she was a strong woman she wasn't tempted by other men she wasn't you she may have been tempted but she overcame it you know and she stayed true she stayed faithful she was a strong believer in other words now for rubies now not just one ruby remember not just one her price is far above rubies now rubies according this is according to gem society org so on I am no you can take a test and become certified to be a master gem guy I forget what it's called gemologist I'm guessing there I have no idea but you can become so knowledgeable about gems but I'm definitely not I just copied I just copied of what it said off the website the hardness is second only to the diamond and extremely rare even more rare than diamonds in fact they just found a new weed say string of rubies in Myanmar if I'm not mistaken from the reading yesterday so there's you know certain packs where you know in the ground where they have all these precious jewels I think Africa has lots of diamonds from what I've heard in South Africa I know there's lots of diamonds and gold and but these are so rare they're hard to find and I like this you can do more with the Ruby than with other gems amen I like that you can treat it you can take it through different heats and and Cooling's and cuts and different things and it still stays genuine Ruby praise God that's a real Christian woman don't you think God can put her through all kinds of trials but he shall come out shinier and brighter with more clarity at the end you can do more of the Christian woman than with all these other worldly women amen I like that it's a beautiful thing this these rubies they're one of the most popular and expensive gems in the world and I like this the record prices go from $100,000 per carat to a 2 million per carat based upon the clarity and the cut and there's there's 4 C's I don't remember all of them I remember clarity and cut that's all I remember a hundred thousand per carat all the way up to two million per carat and a care is the weight of a paperclip I don't have one up here I wish I had should have brought one out I got one on my desk out there imagine the weight of a Paperclip if you could get a ruby that weight one carat it can be up to two million dollars and the Bible said a godly woman's price is more valuable than rubies so her value is far above 2 million per carat brothers I just sometimes think we forget God forgive us right if we forget how valuable our wives are that's not me that's the Bible it's far above rubies so when you look over there say mile when you're driving home I've got about twenty million dollars sitting over there I'm so blessed because it's far about what's far above two million I don't know I'd say 20 30 50 hundred far above and very hard to find a man I'm so glad that God didn't put mine very far for me it would put put her in the same high school as me to make sure I wouldn't miss that shine in Ruby there a lot I think I just thank the Lord for that God knows I never want to I never would have went all these years like wondering you know go from camp-meeting to camp-meeting where's my wife where's my wife God knows I don't want to go through all that nonsense I just want to find her I just want to live be happy with her by God's grace God knows what we have need of I've seen brothers go to this god I see one brother in particular went from South Africa up to Canada and down to Texas and over here just looking for a wife who can find one amen but God will give it to us if we just ask in his name Amen so valuable I'll say like this is so valuable it's worth going around the world for it if you had to if that's part of your testimony and God's testing you to see if you'll stay with the word it's worth traveling around the world to find one of these million dollar women by God's grace multi-million dollar women as far as value her spiritual value is compared to millions of dollars that's right church now before we get to this list she has this list of works that she she's known for in verses twelve I'm sorry thirteen down to 27 cuz after twenty-seven and just talks about how she's praised and virtuous and fears God before we get to do that let's look again at these two defining attributes of the proverbs 31 woman and we need to spend time on this a lot of time people when they preach this they just jump to what a woman does which that's fine but if you do that if you just jump to her works and you don't start at her foundation then the works become vain because before you build a house you got to prepare the ground Amen I don't know yeah you've got to have the foundation in place amen and this woman has to we'd say pillars of foundation I say like that or two cornerstones of or one good cornerstone that has two parts whatever you want to say to her character amen and I'm going to call them boundaries these two attributes of a woman define the boundaries of her life in other words these two things if she has these two attributes to her these two characteristics then that determines all that she can do in her life and then that makes her happy that'll make the church happy if we can stay in God's boundaries if we can do what God's called us to do and not step out in our pride and try to do something we're not called to do but just do what God's called us to do so here's the two defining attributes we read it in our text the first one is in verse 12 she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life that's the first but of course is not the first the first ones actually verse 30 because we put the Lord takes our top priority right God first then family next right so number third verse 30 a woman that feareth the Lord shall be praised so the shorter is one this woman must fear the Lord second after that after she fears God then she does good to her husband every day of the week not just Sunday and I'm talking about to the church now we do good we treat Christ the best we can every day of the week not just Wednesday and Sunday we serve Jesus every day we're in every day of the week Christian hallelujah so her relationship with the Lord we'd say is her foundation now I preach on this but I did it on an online video when I was sick of last month but let's just review the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord is to laugh at evil that's not right and the church said the fear of the Lord is to hate evil this is when you're allowed to express hate when you see sin you can hate sin we shouldn't hate our brother and sister we should love our brothers and sisters praise God we shouldn't even hate our enemies we must love our enemies but one time you can't express the vine hate is when you see sin and you can hate sin proverbs 8 I'm sorry pride arrogance II and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate be not wise in that own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil so you hate evil so the fear of God hates evil and then it leaves evil behind in the dust it doesn't hang around evil and kind of play with it a little bit and experiment and just trial just try this I'll just pet this this be my little pet thing and no it hates it and then it leaves it praise God by mercy and truth and Nic wa t is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil the reason men commit sins and we say adulteries or or fornications the reason men do that is because they don't fear God enough amen the reason women commit adultery and fornication said and get drunk and do drugs the reason they do that is they don't fear God enough they love the pleasures of the world more than they fear the Living God hallelujah so the fear of the Lord is to hate it and then walk away from it praise God you know we know the Bible says you know casting down imaginations but if we cast it down and hang around it doesn't do us any good if the box of snakes comes to our house that we just toss it down but we hang out outside the front door that doesn't do us any good the snakes are gonna crawl all over our feet all right Church but you've got to hate it cast it down reject it slam the door and get away from it amen that's real fear of the Lord so this is the foundation of a godly wife a proverbs 31 woman and I'll say on this a proverbs 31 church so her first priority is to submit to every word of God a woman's thinking attitude behavior must all submit to God it doesn't even matter you know we shouldn't skip ahead to the work so what does she do I want to do that you must make sure your heart is right because remember the Prophet said if the nominations can build churches and hospitals and missionary programs if they can do all that without the Spirit of God it's an antichrist spirit so what good are the works if the spirits not right first we got to get the spirit right verse and fear the Lord amen then go build a hospital or a missionary or or something like that a church then go do that but first get your foundation right so in other words this is what lamu Elle's mother or possibly Bathsheba this is what she's saying son maybe Solomon uf they're different people make sure you choose a woman who fears the Lord above all things let me just tell our young sisters because my daughter is now a teenager let me just tell them the best thing that young sisters can do is to fear God and live such a godly pure innocent life learn to fear God be an example to all the other young sisters in the church don't worry don't try to get somebody's attention just sit there and you're another word stay in your spiritual position don't try to attract anybody's attention just try to get God's attention Amen with your faith and fear of the Lord don't change your clothing to be a modest don't change anything about your character don't be flirty with the boys but fear God humble yourself fear God and God will send you the husband at the right time that's right that's what you young men like Malachi and Elijah need to be looking for as they come in their teenage years I know he's only 11 but I've got to preach it anyhow you know he's he's got to hear when they go to places or cultures they should have looked for a girl who doesn't love the Lord they should look for a girl who trembles in the presence of the Holy Ghost hallelujah someone that fears God they care what God thinks about them amen they hate evil and they depart from evil that's what our young men need to be looking for that's the most important thing they can look for because we're gonna see with some of these the jobs and the works that this proverbs 31 woman does she couldn't do these while she had little kids some of these she had to do when they were all grown and she had more time on her hands like clearing a field the Bible said she clears out a field of the rocks a woman clears out the field plants it and then sells those and gets money off it and is fruitful in her endeavors how can she those she's if she's got twins on her back you know this this would be a very hard thing to do so we have to understand like so Solomon or well you know this young King Lemuel if he's looking for a wife you know he wouldn't look maybe for an older woman he would be looking for a younger woman and this younger woman might not be out in the fields yet but one thing she's got to have the fear of the Lord she's got to love God and fear God and hate evil amen he will he might not see that works yet but he can know this those works will happen if she loves God with all her heart amen she's going to be a proverbs 31 woman I'll be very honest and my wife and I have you know we talked about this numerous times I believe if not if not I apologize to her afterwards but I told her I said you know I love my wife but I never knew she was gonna be this good of a mother I knew she loved the Lord but I didn't know she was gonna be this valuable you understand what I'm saying because you know we I just didn't know all that was in her but one thing I knew is that she would separate herself she leave her denomination and she come to the message even after here in marriage and divorce was her first sermon she ever heard even after hear on that she was still love and serve the Lord and I didn't know at that time what just all the works and all the love for the family and all the fruit that would come out of her mothering I didn't know but I knew one thing she loved the Lord and that's what you have to know brothers when you choose you've just got to know one thing does she fear the Lord or does she do what she wants to do we need women that fear the Lord amen that is the most important thing fear God keep his commands Gloria oh look I doubled the slide so forgive me I just put quotes on that one sorry I don't know why did that well Graham said the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition in his character remember she's the reflection of him right if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to truly shows what's in him why did this man tie himself to was it a woman who feared the Lord or was it a woman who has a make believer or unbeliever what is a man tie himself to it shows what's inside of him now if he wasn't a Christian yet made a decision or something like that that's different right and then God allowed that for our testimony sake and you know we know that person would have done different had they been a believer and so forth like that but we've got to trust in the sovereign knowledge of God that God knew what we do God knew and we get saved and all things work together for them that love the Lord we've got to trust the sovereign wisdom of God so a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for life it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married and that Grich huh watch what he marries that will show what's on the inside of him it shows what he has in his mind what his future home is going to be because he's took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that just shows what he's thinking of the future Amen hallelujah what a beautiful thought for us and think about that Christ knows what's inside of our character right cry if Christ chose us in him well we must have the right kind of character a man by His grace now by His grace so I proverbs 31 woman simply cannot stand evil she's constantly purging it from her life and her home so should our church constantly purge sin from our church that right and then later she does this if she fears God departs from evil hates evil then cries and her family will praise her for this later not worship praise and complement her because brother Bram teaches that in the church age book brother Aaron said Christ praises his own he's not worshiping us he's just complimenting us for being well well done good and faithful servant amen he's complimenting us cuz this is what he says he said I know your works I know your labor mother's he knows your works your labor your patience how you cannot bear them which are evil so see there's the fear of the Lord right there these ephesian church age believers they couldn't handle evil people no matter how religious they are they hated sin and now has tried them which say they are possible you say you're a messege believer let me try and see if you really do believe the message and are not and has found them liars and has born and has patience thank God for a patient wife patient mother patient father and for my namesake has labored and is not fainted how many glad when you feel like giving up Christ is there to lift you up amen you're in your flesh of your mind you're so weary you're so tired but Jesus won't let you quit amen because he that started a good work will finish it will completed in you and I a man because he's faithful hallelujah it's his power behind this dream he met he's the one that's pushing us on hallelujah that's right church so this is a compliment this is Jesus praising the Ephesian bride so if this will can rid her life and her family of all the sin in the family Christ will praise her so sisters it's your job to go home well I say follow the leadership of your husband of course but with his leadership purge out the entire home keep all the leaven out Amen but man said how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he that takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior you know Jesus watching your attitude this morning all wise you got to preach this or I'm thankful he's preaching this he's watching our attitudes this morning and he's either gonna praise you or rebuke you that's what he because if he don't rebuke you you're not one of his own right as many as I love I rebuke and chasten amen he takes full account he knows that there's weakness amongst them but yet he does not cry out against it he said isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong matters I can truly say that I had two brother another brother from Africa texted me yesterday and he was saying out he's a young brother and I've text him over the last few months but he was telling me he said brother Jesse he said I've sat on the message all these things he said but I'm not born again and how do I do this I'm I forget how old he was either teenage or early college and he said every time I get around my friends at school he says I just join in to their evil conversations he said what should I do am I born again and I said no sir you're probably not born again because when you're born again you hate evil praise God you hate evil and so after the text he agreed he said yes I need to be born again I've got too many things I got like repent he said what should I do I said you need to get alone with God and pray and weep until you hate the dirty jokes of your friends more than anything in the world amen then you need to ask God to fill you with the Holy Ghost amen because he when you're born again then you determine the atmosphere and if you can't change the atmosphere then you leave the atmosphere is that right and he thanked me said I got to go study Center I wish I had more time to talk to you have all these questions I said well whenever you're ready I'll help you and he sent me a picture of him and his buddy I guess they did a selfie or something like that I don't he said he said we love your videos all these things like that but I was telling look I was trying to show him that Jesus wants to discourage his evil conversations but encourage him that he's at least come this far he's been baptized we encouraged him that you've been baptized praise God but now you've got to walk through the hot wilderness you've got to be sanctified amen you got to be cleaned out of your daily habits and desires until God fills you with His Holy Spirit he can trust you with his word amen that's right how many seen how God knows how to encourage you when you're struggling this week I'll be real honest I was really struggling I was really discouraged this week different things in my life you know I was really discouraged really discouraged and and I got a text was that yesterday yeah yesterday morning I was here at the church said I got a text from one of my friends in Copley and it was a mother and she you know sent a text to my wife and I at the same time which was very respectful because they're not in the message but she loves the Lord you know it seems as far as she knows and she said Jesse and Christin last night the Lord woke me up several times all's I could dream about was your family and she said I don't know what's going on I can't even remember all this going on but each time God woke me up I prayed for you and your family and I rarely get texts like that and so she sent me a scripture John 10:10 that said the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy but I have come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly he said I'm praying for you to have the abundant life and the little did she know I was been so discouraged the last few days just discouraging what's why this and why that and why this and the and then God and I thought how how how sweet is God that God can anoint somebody who doesn't even know what I'm going through wake her up a mother of numerous children wake her up in the middle of the night over and over again just to pray for my wife and I how much Oh how He loves you and me amen makes me wanna sing a hymn hallelujah Oh how He loves you and me and then this morning right before church I got a text from Tennessee and a brother said how are you doing you're really heavy on my heart today is everything okay Oh how He loves you and me praise God does Jesus know how to encourage this church absolutely does he know how to discourage us in the wrong matters absolutely program said we could all learn a good lesson right here running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with us each one of us in exactly the same way amen you so you can't say well well brother Jesse God loves you more than he loves me or yo God God treats you a little bit better than me you can't say that because Jesus treats all his children the same hallelujah he's not a respecter of persons he said don't ever be discouraged saint of God that's real good for me this morning he said for God is now ungracious to forget your labor of love hallelujah whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water someone has a reward and a blessing from the Lord let's say hallelujah ready hallelujah amen so if she we can keep all the sin out of her life and her home even when her children become teenagers we can't make an excuse when they become teenagers right we got to keep the house clean I know my mom fought it as hard as she could but she was all by herself she let in more than she should have but she didn't know the message but she tried to keep out the bad movies and the worldly music when I was growing up cuz I didn't know better she would she would destroy tapes and you know cassette tapes remember cassette tapes anybody remember that she'd break CD she throwing the trash she break our video games of that violence on him she tried as hard as one woman could with five boys and one girl she tried as hard as she could so the woman has to fear the Lord and now after fearing God hating evil she must do good to her husband every single day now look she purposely does good every day that's her first thing I've got to do good to my husband I fear God I love God I keep it all the sin on the house the next thing what good thing can I do for my hubby amen now brothers the Bible said you need to love your wives too so I'm not leaving the brothers out but this is proverbs 31 this is what I'm preaching right now men you if you don't love your wife shame on you right but she's got to have a purpose today what can I do good for my husband I've gotta do something today to be good to him now timebut Church I already read through the whole book of Proverbs I took detailed notes I didn't have time yesterday to go through it but there are all the scriptures about odious wife or contentious wife and what the Bible say the Bible says it's bad work better to dwell in the wilderness than in a house with a contentious wife praise the Lord she's either the greatest Blessington or brother Ram said she's water in his blood and husband's you can be the same to your wife right we all know husbands that have been abusive either verbally or physically and it's the most awful thing that could be done in a marriage right using the children not loving the wife shame on a man like that he's probably guilty of it he's probably deserving of jail time if not worse right if he's violent towards his wife and children he deserves jail time but the Bible now as this point here she's got to do good not to start arguments not to get back at her husband but she's got to think what good can I do to my husband today you need to wake up you and I and say what can we do for the kingdom of God today amen what can I do to lift up the name of Jesus Christ today let me do something good for Jesus today I don't want to take a day off I don't care if it's Saturday I want to glorify Jesus hallelujah so she doesn't say or do anything evil towards her husband because she so has so much fear of the Lord that she would never let any evil into her home I hope I hope this reminds you of your life right now I hope you say oh praise the Lord that's how I'm living and if not Oh Lord forgive me help me to live the right way cleanse me this morning so I can have a house like a proverbs 31 woman so see this woman she recognizes that she is his helpmate not the other way around right I she says I'm here to carry out his vision I'm here to help him he's not here to help me get what I want I'm here as a helpmate to help him get what God's leading him to so her motivation is now this is powerful now just stay with me here I know I know I preached 40 minutes already can you believe that her motivation then for the many activities she will accomplish in her lifetime in this chapter is to be good to her husband now we're going to talk about spices we're talking about clothes in a moment here maybe later next week all these things that she can do fields prophets are trading with merchants across the oceans this woman does it all oh she knows all of this with one goal to fear God and then to do something good for my husband no doubt her family but notice in this chapter the chapter never exalts children above the husband this chapter keeps the order of God where God is first then husband and the church said so we got to take the understanding as we look at this chapter all that she accomplished she doesn't she does this in the name of her husband just like we do everything in the name of Jesus Christ amen we'll cross the sea right we will do whatever we cross the country we'll go whatever we can and everything we do if we give to the poor or if we go to the hospital pray for somebody we do it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen remember wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ as the head of the church he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so that wives be to their own husband's in everything now look at this I'm not going to raise your hand sisters but how many sisters feel like you're submitting to your husband I hope all of them but here's what it means in the Greek to arrange under if I submit I yield to your admonition or advice so sisters if your husband gives you his advice you should yield to that how many believe that's godly unless he tells you something outside the word you don't have to obey that put everything else even it's just his preference or his advice whatever he wants the woman needs to submit and listen to the advice because how should the church respond to every word of Christ should we just brush it off and do what we want or should we take the advice of Jesus and every preference that he has Amen I think you know the answer to that I thought that was so striking sisters are we just are we even taking the advice of our husbands we ought to because that's what the word submit means the Greek military term means to arrange troops and divisions in military fashion under the command of a leader in non-military use it was a voluntary attitude of giving in so our sisters are most like Christ when they just give in and say okay I'll do away now you need to do this and listen you need to do that that that that do what I want do what I want no a real godly submissive woman she does she's able to give him she's able to take advice she's able to do what the husband asked her to do but see he's got to have a loving spirit behind it and even if he does it as long as it's not nothing off the word she should still submit I know that's tough an hour later to see in society or maybe the way you were raised but how many believe the Word of God is more important than society and culture how many believe that so our sisters and remember we get brothers we got apply this to our life with Christ are we taking Christ's advice or we just do in our own advice are we are we quick to give in to what whatever Christ wants brothers are we quick to do that we ought to sisters are we quick to give in and I'll just okay that's fine I'll do it your way that's fine I had these plans and ideas but but you know I'm under you so I'm just going to trust the gods leaving you the right way that's where the rubber meets the road can I say like that that's where the rubber meets the road what's our attitude like remember Christ is either gonna praise you or rebuke you for your attitude amen hallelujah the proverbs 31 woman she modeled submission her mission is based upon his mission and she puts her mission under his mission which is submission right is that right sub mission the woman still has a mission but it fits into his mission hallelujah because it's under his mission so all these things the woman does later in this chapter training children you know maids and servants and all these things fields buying things purchase these things all she does she does them under the husband's mission so it hadn't been the husband's mission first and then to do him good she thinks oh I can do this I can do that and that will bless my husband praise god I really believe this will help our families don't you don't you believe that if we can express this kind of character remember Church this is rare now I hope I hope we have a church full of rare rubies this morning or you're so rare you can do you've done all these things in your life as far as sisters I'm talking about that would be beautiful but remember we don't have to do all this just like we could never do all the things Christ did but we've got a press and strive press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus we've got to do all that God's called us to do we've got to accomplish all that Christ wants to accomplish in our lives like brother BAM said I may not be a Billy Graham but Billy Graham can't be a William Branham right we've all got a purpose we've all got a place we've all got to come under the mission of Christ so the property one woman has two motivations I'm down to 10 minutes Wow all right got to protect myself so I don't bare wear myself out the proverbs 31 woman has two motivations she fears the Lord and she does good to her husband every day not to mistreat him not to make his life miserable not to make him upset but just to give in voluntarily just given his advice his preference she just gives in that voluntarily God's called me to serve you I'm your helpmate I know how to follow the will of Lord I fear God too much to go against my husband I say like that we fear God too much to go against Christ that's right that's right Oh glory see many women today have different motivations that's why their lives aren't a proverbs 31 woman they could care more about money that's why they got to go get a job before it maybe it's time right or maybe a 10 they've got to go dress a certain way or do something to get attention there they're not happy enough or they're not content with what God's called them to do or maybe they're after acceptance well I just want the world or these friends of mine to accept me so I'll go do this instead of what my husband wants me to do or maybe they're just motivated by fear well if I don't get outside the house I'm never gonna be anything valuable when the home is the very backbone of society it's the backbone of the church I mean know that your home my all our homes our church is only as strong as the home is that right so see the proverbs 31 woman is not motivated by any of these temptations her motivation is only the fear of the Lord and to do good to her husband all the days of her life now I have a quote for next time where bodiham said it's okay for women at times to work outside the home it's okay well Aram says that his main concern if you listen to the quotes actually from questions and answer 64 his main concern is that a godly woman will get around a bunch of filthy men if you listen that quote and they will kind of defile her good morals so he says if a woman wants to help him her husband get out of debt and can take care of that still take care of the children do all those things he said that's fine he said but he's concerned about the atmosphere that she's under because she has a sacred responsibility to her the word right and to her husband and her family she has a sacred responsibility just like the man has a sacred responsibility just like men must stay undefiled before God they must lead and walk in holiness glory that's right church love the Word of God don't you now I want to stop here and pause a note I'd mentioned this earlier the children must not be exalted above the husband's vision or mission or leading whatever you want to call I just call it the leadership of the Holy Ghost whatever he's lead led to do the children cannot be exalted above the husband's leadership so she does good of course both to the children the husband but he's still the head she doesn't make the children the head of the family and I think we've all seen that in different families right we're what the children want is more important than what God wants it so the easiest example is usually Wednesday night services or Sunday morning services people got to skip Wednesday to go to sports games or academic challenge or extra practice on their studies they'll put things above the Word of God is that right and the church said or they'll skip Sunday morning because we got a wrestling tournament or we've got out what you name it we've got a volleyball tournament and at that point the needs the natural needs or desires of the children have been exalted above the will of God now it's the father's fault if that happens because he's the head of the family but see even in the home the mother must love the husband and do him good all the days of his life and she must not put the children even above the husband now we know a godly woman will meet all the children's needs and the husband's needs but what I mean is that the children cannot become an idol she can't love the children more than she loves her husband and me be mistreating her husband she's got to love everybody prays to the heart see if the children and the children will feel this believe me they'll feel this because I've taught many children over the last 14 years and I've had parents tell me that their children run their houses and the church said they run that parents have told me they run the house we do whatever they have to do whatever they want to do that should not be so in the Church of the Living God we know them needs the needs must be met we know that but this proverbs 31 woman she does her husband good all the days of his life and the children never get exalted above the mission or leadership of the husband so I put this up there if the children feel they're the center of the family and they will how do you know because they'll demand their way and their way goes above the word that's how you know any breaking or compromising on the word not hating evil but compromising to evil now you know the children have been exalted that mother's life the children have been exalted above the husband that's the scripture so this is an example of idolatry and the children they will start thinking well my mom exists for me and that will alternate lead whoa God he's there for me and God becomes an errand boy God becomes a Santa Claus instead of a faithful corrective loving father are you with me Church if these children become more if their needs go above the husband they become more important than the word this is what happens idolatry occurs and like I said I've seen it in numerous homes but we should think we exist for God's purpose God doesn't exist to help me out I exist to glorify Him how many adults can say amen to that my life the purpose of my life is to glorify Jesus Christ and I'm bringing my wife and children along to follow me and help me lift up the name of Christ Jesus amen glory that's my leadership of the Lord and any hate anything that's evil I hate and I depart from that I do not leave my family and to compromise on God's Word the wife or children will feel it if the wife doesn't the right order and do her husband good and and not exalt the children she doesn't keep that order they'll know it they'll act like it they'll act like it's all about them we must act like it's all about Christ now this is the example you say where's that in the Bible I preached this over and over again Eli's bad example God sent a prophet to Samuel to tell sit little old Samuel that I'm getting rid of Eli because he honored his sons above the word praise God so in this case it was Eli the father all the responsibilities will ultimately go on the father he honored his sons more than God because he because he let his sons continue to be ministers in the house of God despite their adultery's despite their breaking of God's commands on offerings that member they would take the fat they would call up the fat and take it for themselves the pieces with the biggest fat they cut that off but all the fat was supposed to go to God and fat was that part that tastes the best I guess you the bottom and taught him a lesson to go give a a tan was it called a suntan yeah that's right a suntan should to give her a suntan and get them to obey or fear the Lord or get out of that position this is what happens the woman has to in the home she has to keep just to keep the mind of her husband I've got to love him I've got to do good for my husband every day if she keeps that headship she keeps the headship of husband above me wife then no doubt show that'll trickle down to the children and the children will start to understand the fear of the Lord mom why do you do this mom why did we got this why don't we go back to church or why we keep praying why do we keep doing all these things it's because we fear God and God's ways are best God is directing our path God is directing your father amen right the Holy Spirit is guiding your father that's what our mothers need to say and then the father's need to say the Holy Spirit's guiding me because I've asked and God has answered I've had a relationship and experience with Christ Jesus amen I got two minutes now remember this woman is a woman she is the embodiment of the full effect of wisdom in a person she is wisdom made flesh she is proverbs made flesh and may we'll look at this tonight by God's grace she is prob herbs made flesh how many be the bride will be the word made flesh Christ was the fullness of the Godhead the fullness of the word made flesh we are just supposed to manifest our portion of the word amen proverbs 31 now verse 11 you've got your Bible so that's good I can put it up here for you I'm sorry I do have it up here proverbs 31 verse 11 I think we'll close to this the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil interesting thought in it now I had to look up some of these commentaries to kind of get an idea so if if a woman really fears God if she hates evil and leaves evil it gets evil out of her house her husband will learn to trust her now he should have been trusting her before they got married right in best-case scenario he should have saw MA she really fears the Lord I can trust her she loves God she loves the house of God she loves the preaching the word she loves to pray she loves the things of God my she's filled with the spirit and if she lives like that then her husband even before they're married will I know I can trust her that means confidence she has confidence I'm sorry he has confidence in his wife so if she's a woman that fears the Lord and will do him good all the days of his life then he will safely trust in her the commentary now now this is the partner strange so that he shall have no need of spoil no need of spoil we usually think of spoils with wars don't we like after Abraham to feed the four kings he went out for the spoil and brought the spoil in david at Ziklag david's family was all taken away he prayed and God direct him okay go possess get everything back it'll be your spoil you'll gain everything back that's your spoils of war so this is interesting so this is what Clarke says I like it he says she is an unspotted wife the heart of her husband does safely trust in her he knows she will take care that a proper provision is paid for his household and will not waste anything so he knows she's gonna take care of everything in the home she's a good manager of the house praise God if he works hard makes money all week he knows she's not gonna go blow it on Amazon or something like that right or you name it Cavs tickets I don't know you name it movie tickets she's not gonna go blow it on some worldly lust he trusts her can trust your wife with your checkbook can't you brothers and what's more important than that your children's lives your children's souls yeah so this is what he says he has no need for spoil in other words he is not obligated to go out on predatory excursions or wars of conquest he doesn't have to make extra-extra wars in order to provide for the family at the expense of the neighboring tribes he doesn't have to kind like an untimely thing well I've got to go out get out a part-time job now if you need one that's different like if just it was a trial or something like that but if the wife's overspending and now the husband's got to go get another job now that's something we need to talk about can ever understand that by God's grace there's a difference here I'm not saying if our money runs out or the extra insurance or insurance went up I'm not talking about things that you can you know you can't predict I'm talking about a woman doing sinful things and he can't trust her with the management of the home this is what the scripture says so a godly proverbs 31 woman the husband can trust her with resources of the home how many sisters feel better now by God's grace amen he can trust her he Key's got to go and he's got to do his work he's gonna come home and he knows she's trustworthy he's got confidence she's gonna manage things at the house well that's what the word guide means to manage she's the manager remember Titus said guide the whole not rule the whole guide the home the man rules the home and the church said notice what harm to send our feet I'll stop right here I've already gone over an hour I'm going to our and five minutes to notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until he's seen of the father or the father showed him first this is spoken word original seed this is where he said pick up your pen and write the Holy Spirit told the Prophet harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he knows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for the Seabee planned the water will raise it up again brother Graham wrote a big hallelujah after that I mean Oh God's going to raise you up if the seed of God's been planning your soul gonna raise you up amen here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ

this woman takes care of all the resources he trusts her in the home and everything they have with the checkbook and the food and all the resources just as the natural husband can trust his natural life with all the resources so Christ wants to trust us with his word that we will not try to bring the word to pass ourselves or for something to happen but we will know the word so well and be so
