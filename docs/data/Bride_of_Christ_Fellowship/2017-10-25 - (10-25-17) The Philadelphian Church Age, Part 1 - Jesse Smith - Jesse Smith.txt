========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] today's got to meet House of Lords that well where our summers the prayer time I didn't get here early as I'd like to so I can pray a little bit there were some important needs I want you to keep it right here so Malachi if you could switch over Bank says this is HDMI three now there's a new connection let's see if this works okay I was reading up with this picture up here this is the little girl were praying for crews battle cancer three times you you great there'd be no more - absolutely I invited I would invite everybody to do some fasting on Saturday I think I'll fast probably two three meals if I can on Saturday just take that time then you know she's got all her hair back you know it used to be really long but that you know with each tumor with all the chemotherapy falls out she was pretty good now I got her little sister in my class this year also know some other ones up here so fasting for the other Saturday if you can you know I understand if you can't but it's a real good way to strip the Lord we're gonna talk about the car games down a little bit got to get it down one of the brothers their guests about the car games I mentioned on Sunday mixed up the car being so forgiving I guess solitaire is not a gambling game I don't know I thought it was that shows how much I know about cars I thought it was okay I never I never played it at all the game I thought it was gross pokers I know pokers again to me I know that much so the point I was making was that when people have poker games and cards right now it shows they have a spirit behind gambling is like lust covetousness is also pride you know I'm trying to take your money and it goes against all God's principles of patients with sowing and reaping right so your seed you work harder to job if you replay go see gambling is impatient selfish so I just wanted to see that the scriptures and some of the thoughts behind that I mixed up the gauge because I don't know any answer for you I would everybody know that I'm just so just having the deck of cards isn't evil it's what you do with the cards for example at my school we use decks of cards but we just use it to add and subtract there's no poker there's no Jack's on there there's no kings or queens but their cars about the game you know there's nothing evil on there it's just a carbine you know just a game when you start getting into gambling and taking people's money than really got some spirits so those are some good questions I appreciated the questions I just wanted to kind of clarify that and I'll say like this if you've got cards on your table you know at your house and that's the centerpiece of your house or like the Prophet said love story magazines romance novels there's definitely some problems you know in that house I would hope that they're not in our our homes my house grace dude we've heard it before I'm so I'm set yeah those of us who followed the message brother banner through the Bible I wouldn't expect those in our houses but just to clarify I just want to say that by God's grace so just let's pray for that one pray for all so I had a co-worker her dad passed away and she loves the Lord you know to whatever I think she's Baptist is Right Baptist and she said her mom's taking it really hard so let's pray for her mother then the

[Music] [Applause] [Music] okay relations reverse rested all week with which sermon to preach in those regions are here this morning I just kind of fun a poll to go here so that means I didn't get enough time to put all the clothes I'll be on the screen so reading some of the book here messenger to the nation and the Prophet said a lot about that which we've heard I like to go just through some of these sources like Britannica and to make a pedia the Methodists website I'd like to look at their lives I think it could be a real inspiration you know Susanna Weston was a godly woman had 19 kids night above died in infancy so she had 10 kids and there was a couple of times she looked at her house got burned down twice her husband left her a cup for a couple years and he was even a preacher as she raised all those kids all tent by herself for come here so our sisters can gain a lot of strength I've spoken our brothers that sometimes your husbands and dads who represents an encouragement I think anybody whether it's male or female if we can pull inspiration from them praise the Lord like for example I pull inspiration from Mary write the Virgin Mary she kept that word and didn't doubt she should just said be done to me ignored and I work that's how I would it be I want to hear the word I don't say be done to me according then and hope you had a good week up this is the best we could prayer had in a long time sermon on sudden they really did something follow you by God's grace really touch my heart the unsearchable riches of Christ let's uh pick up I was here at revelation three seven they're really for us or for me this is the last church age I've already preached all the other six by God's grace so this is coming down to the last without reference to the development they ever seen just to kind of refresh a little bit but we're all grateful big of course with age living so let's look at revelation three seven we'll just read that verse because I don't imagine up all right let's read this together if we can on three one two three and to the Angel of the Church and know that right Lee said true yeah here they Charlotte and Charlotte as far as a word prayer but you know in your heart just lives it under God and God will see your parents requests how many father we love you tonight and thank you again for your mercy and grace you are also efficient Oh God you are as the scripture says here Lord amen you have the key of David what your prophet said was the Millennium and also the key to responsibility for it over your bride the church thank you that you've opened these things to us no man can shut the Word of God to us because it was you Jesus who opened this word to us we thank you for that tonight Lord we just pray to speak to us help us to all inspiration from the lives of this these two individuals here John Wesley and his mother Susannah Lord as we look to you Lord look to these truths Lorna I just pray don't speak to us or it surely has already this week is not listening twice I think to this church age the church age Bokan knowing that a man preached 800 sermons in one year is never went out I would be encouraged by that and ought to encourage gain strength to know that Lord you could you're with me just as you were with it and your promises are just as true so help us all Lord God - to focus in more than with this beard saying here tonight I'm just a man of nothing but orders we heard on Sunday Lord if we can approach every gift Lord with respected reference will be benefited not be in your house tonight help us now it was strengthened grace Jesus Christ II know reset it god bless you didn't see the Great Scott alright this look at this here I can switch over back to the HDMI three that turn off the notifications on that phone that's gimme so yeah I'm going back to see here here's our you know usual screen we've been working on we're all the Philadelphia Church age it was from 1715 and ended in round 19 here's serving the law but actually I look at it he actually didn't start preaching under his message of two moves 35 so that was encouraging so I'm 36 praise the Lord he's never 35 worked 88 preaching as much as it could so you know this shows there was more light in the Philadelphia age than the 30 artists artists n Thyatira because Jesus caught this aged motive dork so this was the greatest missionary age the Prophet talked about with more men going further around the world that had the better technology to do it and so this was the age of the open door which Jesus told that in chapter 3 verse 8 but we didn't read that many ways okay that's this could not so tight daughters are texts we never read all protectively just right here seven here's the prophets summer if you listen the thief in church age the Philadelphia church age was the age of brotherly love the Great Commission age and the great missionary age the open door first connected to the foundation and that means that were faithful in our in our day were connected to the Apostles because we preach the same word and then he says reveal the names of God was to be during this age when it went around 1906 so the name of Jesus Christ as the name of God became a revelation towards the end of this church age alright so there's a picture nothing else get past that because I think I just somebody's not doubled it away so here we are right here now a lot a lot more little well a little more like the Wesleyan that less light for our day this is the day we're living in you know the revival for our each so in 1906 glad it's still going on right here in Akron Ohio because Church the revivals didn't eat the revivals that needed praise God yeah that's right because our lives are revived and on fire for Jesus at last the world can't put out this fire he doesn't started from head and he may know keep going it's been going this mommy's gonna keep going by the grace of the Lord so we're so thankful you know all the lights you know some light that might in this date you know they had so much light back there at Paul's day but we're thankful for the light we have today now here we are again just another view this age was 156 years long so it was the shortest two three the fourth shortest Church age and again I'm just want to show this here's where we are where this church age the throne up with church age and so you see they're still battling you know Luke Wesley these days still battle this this black horse rider there's still persecution it still meant death in different places the Roman Catholic Church is still ruling a lot right during this time they had a lot of power so that's the that's the battle they were overcoming but one thing they didn't have was the Holy Ghost annoying to amen as a man the wisdom of a man we'd say to overcome the black horse rider and the great battle was the synagogue of Satan they were really battling the denominations the Roman Catholic Church system they're really battling that whereas you know Luther battle living a name but we're dead the lot of people say in the organization but they literally come out but then they battle that synagogue the great way okay the city of Philadelphia let's read a little bit on this there's a little bit on this it was 75 miles south of Sardis the second largest city in Lydia it had a coin a ting the coins that they used at the head of Bacchus on one side which was the same person as Nimrod from the book of Genesis and then the figure of a woman priestess the population had Jews Christians and heathens there was frequent earthquakes in the city but he had lasted the longest of all the seven churches of Revelation and is still alive this is so existing today at least one this was written called Alice seer Alice here the City of God now the coins represented this but the Prophet said when you flip a coin he said either way it was wrong one side was the Roman system the Nimrod system and the other side was woman worship so he said that's what they battle that's what the coin represented in those days either side you flip the coin you're gonna get false doctrine that's that wreck that was that's what that symbolized now let's look at the age here there's not much on that the age again as we said was from 1750 to 1906 now here's the messenger of course we know John Wesley but we're gonna start with remember Martin Luther was the messenger to the Sardis age from 1520 to 1750 and here we have John Wesley's life so he was born at the end of the Sardis Church age and lived into the beginning of the Philadelphia churches and then of course we know William Branham was the messenger and that's where his life falls at the beginning of the church age all right someone leave that up there Malik I reckon up and she leave it up there now I'm going to look at the life of John Wesley how many ever studied on John Wesley's life what he studied on it all right okay there's supposed to be do have you read this chapter but okay praise the Lord so they'll have the background on that I'm sure but in Jose I have some background if anyone else is ready all right let's look a little bit of facts on John Wesley and as I read the Britannica it was strikingly familiar or almost sometimes exactly to the same words in the church age book so what for historical references the Prophet used with lavell they're extremely actor with the ones Britannica used so we found that to be interesting I'm going to go through John Wesley's life first then we'll end with Susan in the West it's okay you want to do it alright so I'm sorry John the messenger then we'll close with Susannah okay so John Wesley was born to Susannah and Samuel Wesley he was the second son and his dad was actually at the center of the Church of England he was a preacher so do you catch that his dad was like we'd say he was a religious you know person you know he left the false doctrine so see that was already kind of in his families they were familiar with that his dad knew what it was like to leave the church system and pretty soon John Leslie would leave the church system actually he get kicked out this is what happened so when he was when he was educated he went to Oxford University graduated four years later and became an ordained priest he was made a deacon a year later and then he started assisting his father at two different locations then got ordained I'm southern god ordained as a priest official priest in 1728 now while he was right after he got ordained it's pretty interesting he started a movement and they were called the Methodist and I just want to give you the background he wasn't even now what did his own testimony he wasn't even saved yet Church he had just gone through all the religious acts of the denomination that he was or the group that he was associated with okay he just gone through the act so he and his friends even his brother Charles were they were ministers they were all day long I went through school and everything and they started the group and they called them the Methodists I'm sorry the actual name was the holy club that was their name the holy club these are grown men they just graduated college Roman Holi club and here's what they did listen they did frequent communion services they keen union all the time they fasted two days a week doesn't that sound familiar the Pharisees I'm not saying they work I'm just saying like they were John Wesley wasn't saying yet and he thought this is how I'm gonna be say V thought well I'm saying I need to do this don't get me wrong we need to fast - we're gonna do that right but the point was you can be as religious as you want but you have to know Christ for yourself that's that's the bottom line now here's what they did next then they did they visited prisoners they talked prisoners to read as anybody ever done to a president visit any person I visited 2-butanol prison anybody else I've never taught him to read though he would sit there and teach prisoners to read the Bible imagine that they would pay the debts of the prisoners to get them out of jail and this is before he's even safe so he had a love for God - just not having a revelation then he would attempt to find jobs for them once they got out of jail so he had like a prison ministry like he'd said today that's John Wesley oh they actually more they had they had work houses for poor people they distributed food to the poor close to the for medicine and books while also running this school so John Wesley with August his brother Charles and all these other men did all this they have a school they have a close ministry food ministry prison ministry teaching ministry and this is all without being saved so does that help today people go to church today and not even be saved and just do good religious things right this is what John Wesley's testimony is this is history now look at this in 1735 so the column to this church moved last seven years 1735 John and Charles left and then the group just disintegrated so that shows that every ministry there's Oh there's always just a couple people who are in the real backbone right you probably seen it I give a pass to leave the church there's a church stay together they disband that shows you how many leaders there are if they stay together it shows they got some real good leadership and you know they're there for more than just to be see right you really believe there's a work for God like I don't know recently a couple churches where the pastor left but the people just stayed together they just stayed together waited on the Lord God sent her pastor talking about some of you his dad died in 1735 so that's maybe why they stopped those the holy club but then he was persuaded to go on a missionary trip to North America do you know that he traveled from England in North America and he he was trying to help out the Moravian immigrants immigrant I'm not sure what their background is like I start about did they call them Indians maybe Native Americans so Wesley went over there to minister to them and they failed they didn't it didn't make any converts but Wesley was so he was so moved by their dedication he came back to England this is his famous quote the Prophet accorded force here he said I went to America to convert the Indians but Oh who shall convert me so he went there to try to convert them and he saw how meek they were how much peace they had how much courage they had in difficult circumstances mr. Courtney history and he comes back he's already a priest and he comes back and says he was going to convert me I went to go make the converts and I need to learn all right let's see let's see what's next year back in London and he again met these same people of Moravia and then it was a man named Peter bowler who showed him the way to salvation and he was truly born again as a preacher Harvey he was born again as a preacher right Martin Luther's words about Jessica so this is beautiful he's not even safe he's living here in London somebody's reading the previous Church age messengers teachings and the next messenger gets same day man that's beautiful right there hallelujah he wasn't even saved and then he reads Martin Luther's ideas on justification then he gets justified that's beautiful he said from this point forward at the age of 35 Wesley viewed his mission in life as one proclaiming the good news of salvation by faith so see he was trying to earn salvation by works and he constantly fell far from God and we have to be careful that too that we are not trying to earn God's favor that might do more works but we're doing it because we love God or another reason we're doing it because we're trying to crucify this flesh we're trying to get out of the flesh and we're trying to get into the spirit yes do you want God's favor but we're not trying to work our way to be saved we know we're saved we realize we got to bring this body under subjection seized that's why that's why I think we need to fast like I'm saying not not because it will save us it does it we're already sitting but because it gets us thinking away from natural things onto supernatural things hallelujah amen praise God there you go and that's what I was asked today so they asked me what are you fast and I said well it's an Isaiah 56 you fast because the Bible said it breaks chains with officers it restores your health says it gives you strength and power in Isaiah 56 that's what happened you get so you just so filled with the things of God that you'd become stronger spiritually got the mind of Christ walk into the anointing you're more aware of spiritual things instead of oh what am I going to eat next what am I going to do for something I might do for practice yeah Wesley preached whenever a pulpit was offered to him but soon the congregation's closed their doors because of his enthusiasm before get every door open because he was just a regular denominational preacher but after he got saved and do it's not by works it's by grace and he started preaching that enthusiastic gospel everybody shut their doors that's true so next says he started traveling and going out into fields and preaching to large groups kinda like Christ him and he would preach the multitude it became that type of ministry and he was said to be one of the founders of the circuit writer preacher movement where you'd have a preacher who would ride his horse from town to town and he would just go in a circle he'd get back home rest a while and then he go back again alright and so looked like we what we would call evangelist today that's what we would call today I think Samuel is the first ones the Bible that I could see because the Bible said he went over all Israel t-top all Israel he went from each tribe and tall the children of Israel now next next he did it now this is interesting he did it develop religious clubs again but there was no organizational connection there was no connection any church it was just brothers who were banded together in Christ to live a holy life that's what this says here they were they all had to be the same sex that ought to be boys I'm sorry boys ought to be married men and they ought to sit having the same marital status so you couldn't be in one of these groups if one guys single another married you could they couldn't be the same groups they had to be in separate groups and that makes sense right because they if you're single you have the same battles this other single men and you can gain strength from other people that are in your same situation whereas if you're married you have different struggles when you're married and then you want to be a part of brews with married men right they can encourage you they can strengthen you oh I know God help me overcome this you can overcome this to take curved you know things like that and then it says next that he went to the unchurched masses and had many converts and societies they continue to develop and spiritual growth let me read now the moral of the prophets it he said John would come and preach in the fields where thousands would listen to the Word of God he saw the throgs and saw the working of the gospel on the part of the Spirit he turned a whole heartedly to open-air preaching now he says this year next I want to skip a little bit down here he said so powerful was John's preaching he said that people would have fall to the ground crime in great distress over their cities that's how powerful was I've been in a few meetings where that's happened I preached and people were all down and prayed for them and they fall down I had that a few times but this was a common theme in his life his ministry people so be addicted by the Holy Spirit now did you know he said this he said he never felt low in the spirit for even 15 minutes his whole life can you imagine think about how many times you feel discouraged or depressed and sometimes will go for a half hour hour maybe day we so people get hit yeah you might have a different battle right I have a hard battle he said he didn't remember struggling for 15 minutes praise God he was a man who was a star of God right never and the stars in Christ's hands he had to be a star for Jesus Christ did we miss he slept no more than six hours a day he rose and time to start preaching at 5 a.m. practically every day and preached sometimes up to four times a day in a year he would average over 800 sir 800 sermons remember this was the ancient open door people receiving everywhere people would receive the gospel imagine having baptisms every day and new believers every day that's what it was like for this man God opened great doors for he travels 4,500 miles every year by a horse so wonder how many horses he went through as time went along he formed groups of men called United societies and they had a strict set of rules to be self-disciplined for the good of their souls but he said Wesley recognized after his death the movement could be organized and the Spirit of God would leave them to a dead floor did you know Wesley have a favorite saying on money you know what his favorite abstain was on money as you remember that he said get all of the money you can then he said save all the money you can and then he said give all the money you can I like that yet all you can save all you can get now what does Jesus love a cheerful Giver see most Americans stop it get all you can it most don't even save and then most don't even give they don't even give 10% or you know they don't even give but that was that to get as much as you can but then save as much but then give as much as well all right okay I think I'm stop right there he looked to news 88 the Prophet said he died 288 having served God as few men would dare to even think they might serve God praise the Lord let me see there's anything else I'm here when the city never you understand his life a little bit he started off being raised in church you know raised a daddy was a preacher all these things he just got he was just going through the motions he knew the right thing to do but he never really had a real connection in his life to Christ I'm so glad that's how I was you know I was raised in the church but I never felt like I was one of them I always knew I was still a sinner I always do that until I finally repented gave my heart to Christ and then I could then I could sing for myself then I could praise God for myself I could raise my hands for myself so I can relate a lot to John West and I think all of us here can do that tonight as well there was a time when we tried to be a church member but there's a time when we became a Christian and now we do it from our souls we do it from our hearts okay praise the Lord all right let's see them I mean give me about a half hour and we'll try to finish my primer finished in less than that this might be another short nap but pretty simple in you know let's look at Susanna West a little bit now before I read that Susanna Wesley had to the most famous children during this time John which we went through and then Charles Charles wrote six more than 6,000 sins 6,000 I never wrote one song he's wrote a seizure over 6,000 songs now the reason I do these children - while it's good that we did these children first it's nice to see them to look at what kind of mother did they have what kind of mother would produce children like this that would preach 800 times in one year what kind of mother would it take to produce something a child that would write six thousand songs so I want to go through this a little bit yeah there's anything else I want to say about - Charles Lester I didn't get a whole lot of information here okay all right so your Susanna's life okay she's into Wesley she was the daughter of Samuel and Mary white and here's her personal life she was the 25th of 25 children her parents had 25 kids she was number 25 her dad also descended from the established Church of England Nexus II it was in John's it was in John's blood John's grandpa came out of the church and then John's dad came out of that church they were constantly leaving the established system to clean the truth glory at the age of 13 she stopped attending her father's Church oh and then she joined the official Church of England which I don't know that's a good thing or not I'm not sure they did enough reading on that okay she was married at 19 years old then she got married okay so that was her age at marriage she had 19 children nine of the children died his infants for the children who died were twins so she had two sets of twins that died then her maid accidentally smothered one of her children and that child died here's one little little little-known thing about Susanna Wesley brother Branham said she found at least an hour to pray every day and you know sometimes we think how in the world but church she had it made because the maid smothered her job she had can you imagine sisters having amazing job I can't yeah he imagined so you know Wow while she was a godly woman Wow you know brother Graham uses her as I always used to her a nice collie example we have to remember that she had a maid to take care of the children the ten children well she could have some time to pray just keep that in mind that's just for testing them there so yeah mate whatever children was one of the nine that passed away at her death only eight of her children were still lives than she outlived I'm sorry the tumors of her died before she died it's only a tit when were alive when she passed away okay no Susanna Wesley is known as the mother of Method Methodism in other words they say they really attribute all of John Wesley's efforts to his mother which there's some truth behind that like right like Timothy what did Paul say basta I saw the faith of your mother your mother ain't grandmother Lois and Timothy remember that from Scripture that member what made Moses such a godly man is his mouth jakka bed right jack Abed was such a wonderful trainer and teacher of Moses of course prayer warrior we know that too because the Bible says she didn't fear the threat of the king she took Moses down there and just knew God revealed to her he's going to be all right and God delivered on his promise amen so let's learn a little bit more about her life here Suzanne experienced many hardships throughout her life her husband left her and the children for over a year one time because of a minor dispute here's what was written in her letter while her husband had left her she said I have a woman but I've also the mistress of a large family and though the superior charge of the souls contained in it lies upon you I think she's writing your husband yet in your long absence I cannot my look upon every song you leave under my charge as a tailor committed to me under trust praise God you see that she considered every child was a talent given under her remember Jesus said some people have one Talent three talents five counts she said I've got ten talents in other words wow what a way to look at your children remember a talent I forgot how many thousand dollars of talent was in those days it was a tremendous amount of money she said each one of my children is a talent look what she says her husband left her so she says I am NOT a man nor a minister yet as a mother to mistress I feel I ought to do more than I had yet done now listen I resolved to begin with my own children that's a good way that's a good lesson all parents to live work and learn here tonight in which I observe the following method so she uses the word method and it produce Methodists okay so that means she just she had good habits that's what a method is a habit right he grabs this is something that my wife and I could talk about here it's not tuning it over so this is Miss Lydia meows miss I observed the following method I take a proportion of time as I can spare every night to talk or discourse with each child individually so she have ten kids I don't know there's not ten days during the weeks I'm not sure how she did that so she said on Monday I talked with Molly on Tuesday with Hedy Wednesday Nancy Thursday Jackie Friday patty Saturday with Charles so before the day would end she would call one at one side at a time and just talk with them now the industry says she didn't ignore them the rest of the week right parents can't ignore your children rusty but she just made sure she took some one-on-one time with each child throughout the week now isn't that a good lesson church honey was your parents would've done that I wish my parents would did that they never pulled me aside really to talk to me to say Jesse how are you doing are you serving the Lord any questions about the Bible what do you think you wouldn't be when you grow up my parents never did that they never said what do you think you would do with your life you know what do you think you wouldn't do they would lecture me you know her down a time but she pulled each one aside she said if my husband's not gonna be here I am gonna invest in each one of my children isn't that God is that a wonderful thing to do I thought you'd like that now her husband member and left her this is John's dad and John's dad Samuel spent time in jail twice due to his poor financial abilities so he got them dead remember those days if you got a debt too far and could pay her debts the lack of money was a continual struggle for Susannah missing church their home was burned down twice just by fire I don't know how it happened but burned down twice imagine your house being lost twice during one of the fires her son John Wesley nearly died and had to be rescued from the second-story window praise God amen look his say he trying to kill that all that star god oh are you a star got it younger than the young boy there someone came in to rescue God's God star oh that's beautiful praise God amen and she was the primary source of her child's education how many believe in a home school they don't believe in home school I'm a public school teacher I believe in public schooling as long as you got Christian teachers are good good people that don't teach evil things that was a product of public school you know my wife was a product of screws oh yeah good godly teachers there's nothing wrong with that brother man I made this quote he said and I can show to you on it he said my to Turner over at the high school he said I wish they were up in an Indian Reservation he said but it doesn't really matter where they were he says because whatever seeds inside of them it's going to come out so there's a quote where some people say oh no you can't send your kids to school brother Graham says it really doesn't matter I mean you have to you have to follow the leading of the Lord but whatever the leading the Lord will be will be righted it might be the public school or might be to home-school was I talking was it uh was it New York I was talking with somebody recently about their children okay and whatever the case was one of their children it was a little girl I think she was like a fourth grade and she believed the message and she only wore skirts and almost New York yeah I was when I was out there New York this happened in New York right in the Bronx that's right okay now so she's in the Bronx and this was a very liberal area right it's very liberal people dress crazy you know big city her daughter has long hair braids long skirts the guidance counselor pulled her in a room without Sun her parents and questioned her and said why he wears skirts your parents making wear skirts why don't you cut your hair she said she said don't you know you can cut your hair and you'll have you can wear pants and shorts like the other kids and she's like I don't want to I want to serve God and when the mother found out she was furious which I would be too and when it had a meeting and then the guidance counselor did it again and so that time the pastor went in and I know the pastor sent another preacher in and lay down lay down the law had I think they brought a lawyer with them one of those Christian lawyers and after that it stopped but then still the next year they took her out the whole square because they didn't take any chances which I thought was wisdom I know that was a good but like in our school no one ever does that you know it's just a good like tomorrow or next month we'll see God will see god Bless America with five hundred kids in the gym next month we'll see god bless the USA so our our district is very open for religious things so that's why I took an idea for me to work there if I saw some wrongs and I look for a new job somewhere else but anyway there's something considered you know God's will is not always up on the Indian Reservation brother Graham says you know you got to find that's we need to pray and ask God to show you where your we need to go okay so anyways Susanna Wesley was a good homemakers he's a good home school bus with ten kids plus a mate plus I made one time it says I'm sorry doing one of the times when the house burned down Susannah had to send her children to different homes friends and when they got back actually after the Hustlas rebuilt she said she was mortified because her children began to use the improper speech instead of talking and she got really upset she was Susanna Wesley was all about education she said as soon as her children turned five years old she said they were in school for six hours a day let me think about that you guys talk about our your home schools can't do it it's good to think about I gotta think about mine too it said right here that she expected our children to be in sitting in a desk for six hours every day so if you guys started at the same now kind you guys started at 10 a.m. you couldn't leave your chair to the floor peanut I'm pretty sure that's not she's 51 because with homeschool you go a lot faster because there's less kids they can go through a lot of work to earlier tasks because there's less kids but she was all about education Suzanne Weston really believes education a member a prayer warrior on top of all that she's a pretty woman he met next most up okay no all the daughters learned Latin and Greek that's how hard they worked in their books that in Greek and we're well tutored in the classical studies that were traditional in England at that time during a time when her husband was in London defending a friend against charges of heresy yet appointed a locum to bring them the man's sermons revolve solely around repaying debts the lack of diverse spiritual teaching cause Susannah to assembler her children Sunday afternoon her family services they would sing a song and then Susannah would read a sermon from either her husband's her father sermon file followed by another song instead when the preacher was a false preacher she bought her family after the sermon she pulled her family for a second service and she would read her husband's service because she knew they weren't getting spiritually fed that sound like a good mom making sure if they're not going to get fed there I'm gonna feed them at my house in other words for today be like this if you're not getting fed somewhere hopefully you're gonna fed here mercy if not let me know if you weren't getting fed the thing to do then is listen to more tapes at home right that's thing to do but she never stopped attending the church she gets supported to church but while her husband was gone hold them aside crate saying Psalms read The Book of Psalms to them and read her husband's sermons to make sure they got fed the Word of God the local people begin to ask if they can attend at one point there are over 200 people who attend Susanna's Sunday afternoon service we believe that over 200 people this is a woman that love the Lord my family is not getting fed I'm gonna make sure they get fed I'm gonna sing with them every Sunday praise God I'm gonna pray with them every Sunday and it produced the messenger of the age hallelujah and it produced the man who wrote six thousands of Giddings hallelujah all right susannah practice daily devotion throughout her life and in replied to her sons Charles letter she addressed her experience of the depravity of her human nature and the grace of God so this letter shows that she was awakened spiritually before her sons were awakened okay so that's that's what they prove my history she had a spiritual experience even before her sons did so I managed and you know she started following their teachings once they had it but she had a real walk with the Lord which is really nice to see that that's one more paragraph her husband Sandra spent his whole life and all the family's finances on his book about the book of Job however his work was not remembered and had little impact on his family other than the hardships they went through but it says in contrast Susanna wrote several pieces that would be fundamental in the education of her children along with letter she wrote meditations and scriptural commentaries for her own use in other words she journal about the Bible well this means this to me this means that to me this was a blessing here few journal about the Bible okay and let me close with one more day here my gosh let me close with one more thing do for Yotam okay good all right now let's go back and your bottom sink your Bible sure that's close I'm gonna get on a different thought as we close kind of goes with John Wesley now let's go to Revelation chapter 3 here still have thought the Prophet brings us up in the actual preaching of the total future change in the sermon from 1960 revelation 3 verse 1 let's read a few in here since we've got a little bit I'm sorry I'm really trying to control not a throat because it really hurts these program you my wife's making specialties for me and I'm sure I was trying that because here's the reality Church not the last year I've been preaching and singing at least three times a week two or three times a week every service and I just get so excited I just go too loud I can only go so far on that and then now I started well then we did a Bible Club when school starts so I'm singing and shouting they're trying to get the kids attention and then we started another ba because I would I'm doing the same thing they're so it's like having five services and I just haven't been taken care of and then I go to Taekwondo I've took the last month off but you have to shout there too supposed to punch and shout out so I throws didn't know and all day I teach at school I don't get any break talking I break from talking just have mercy on that have mercy on that side like that I don't want to leave the paupers but I just seem like I need a little break so hopefully I can send some helpers you know by God's grace well like I said I'm trying to bite people they keep turning me down okay a relation someone look at this last off of the name and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that had the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know that works that thou has a name that now liveth but our dead see they had a denominational name but they were dead to the things of God those are the people that were not a part of Luther's church be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die or I'd not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how the ice received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will call on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour come upon me now has a few names even as ours which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy okay now let stop right there just roamed now remember the Prophet said Sardis was the age where they lost the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember he said they actually lost around the fire to your church they they weren't using the name of the Lord they had their own names and then in the Sardis church age of verse 1 it says they have a name but they're dead so they have a name like well I'm a Baptist or I'm a Catholic or I'm this or on that they have a name but they're actually spiritually dead and the prophets that they didn't have the name of Jesus Christ and history says that in it they just said father son Holy Ghost like people do I don't even know what do they do I'm just this is I'm just trying to remember what they do something like this I don't know but they lost their yeah they lost they lost the name of Christ and that's what the problem with denominations who believe in three persons in three gods it's really three gods they have three separate titles three separate names it's wrong they shouldn't do that but this age Sardis had they just had the Father Son Holy Ghost most of them they didn't have the name of Jesus now it's interesting Church now now let's go to verse 5 and here's the thought that I thought the Lord brought to me this may have been a few weeks ago yeah scope weeks ago in the age when the name of Christ was not known and in the age when they had the wrong name the reward for the overcomer of that age was to be given the name of Christ is that in your Senate so this age Sardis age had a major focus on a name there's something important about a name because it represents Authority it represents you as an individual it represents your identity don't we all one identity right like me my identity so I'm Jesse Smith you know I'm a teacher I'm a father I'm a pastor my name is wrapped around my identity right and so in the age where they they didn't have the identity of Christ Jesus says if your face for me you'll have mine in Maine I'm gonna give you by name so they reversed five he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name on the book of life praise God so there's a great emphasis on the name in the Sardis Church age and that leads into the next often let's keep reading and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels now in this age now sort of Philadelphia verse where's that okay verse eight I know that works for you hold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name there it is brother Branham said this I like to truth according to be what my RAM said that father son Holy Ghost here he said the name of Jesus Christ was restored at the end of this age praise God so see here they had a name but they weren't living it they didn't know life so he's had a church name and he jesus promises I'll give you my name and then the very next age because of their faithfulness now this age restores or gets the restoration of the name of Jesus Christ back please God I think that's beautiful and now they've got the reward for Philadelphia so stand to our feet here our posters brother Branham in the sermon gonna help you church age said this is a three-fold name reward a three-fold name or word verse 12 either overcometh will i make a pillar that double my god and he should go no more out and i'll write upon him the name of my god he's the lord and the name of the city of my god propagate the new jerusalem bless you thank you which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god that all right upon him my praise God how did it go did you catch that the name of God was lost God was slowly restoring it and then now here now we get the name of Jesus Christ back and he said all those who have the literal name bring back the literal name of Jesus Christ he said I'm gonna write upon you the name of God so that's not gonna be the name of God the name of New Jerusalem and then my you name the name of Jesus Christ amen so see there's an importance of the name brother Brooks came here and preached on harm the name of Jesus Christ there's power in the name of Jesus Christ and church God was going to restore his name in this age so he could have chose no better man to use than John Wesley someone who would love the name so much he preached on that name 800 time TV and give him a mommy that would pray for him right and talked with him every week praise the Lord and pray our for their family every single day this is the kind of is the kind of family that the name of Christ gets honored in they may praise the Lord thank God there are some families doing that by God's grace we need a lot more of it though how many thankful for the word Lord Amen thank you for bearing with me I appreciate your patience and usually a little more you know energetic but they're just trying to try to control myself here tonight but it's the truth behind it that's not about my emotion or your it it's about the truth behind all these things so as we prepare to pray how many would say lord help me to take more advantage of my time hoping to be more faithful with my time help me to live the name of Jesus Christ Susanna Wesley 10 children she's all alone her husband wasn't around and yet she still said I'm gonna I'm gonna value this time I'm gonna redeem the time and I'm gonna put all my focus on my children to prepare the next generation and look what it produced John Wesley Charles Wesley praise God what a wonderful thought this is what a great look at history I'm so blessed by that you know I shared that about the sisters about the maid because you know sisters feel bad now talk to my wife and and other sisters they feel bad when they hear this Wesley prayed our day with 10 kids you know but people don't know she had a baby yeah they don't know that if you had help at your house for an hour day you could get a lot more done - but the point is she was committed to praying she was stay faithful to her husband she was committed to her children and the thing was she invested in the talents that God made man praise God so let's just pray let's ask God to help us to invest in the talents he gives us and perhaps this may be more pray that God will help you to see what's a tailor in your life that maybe were missing maybe I'm this helped us to see the resources our lives as talents as we seek to glorify His name father in heaven we love you tonight Lord God we thank you for your mercy thanks for giving us strength Lord to get through this sermon Lord God we're grateful more for this opportunity to be here tonight thank

faith had been written after the days of Wesley Susanna Wesley would have been in there John Wesley would have been in there Charles Wesley by faith he took the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of Hope 6000 his by faith John Wesley rose at 5 a.m. and preached sometimes four times a day preached 800 times a year by faith Susanna be poor yet order self into the educational spiritual growth of her children and devoted herself to prayer or we can all take courage tonight whether report or whether we're alone whether we feel overwhelmed how could how could any of us feel more overwhelmed than Susanna Wesley losing your home with ten children or none of us can really relate to [Music] yeah Lord we have all have our struggles and Lord each of our struggles is important to you you want to
