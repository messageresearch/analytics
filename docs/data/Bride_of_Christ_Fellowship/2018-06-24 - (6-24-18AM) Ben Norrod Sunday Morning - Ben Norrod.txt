========================================

said the Bible said brother man said the Bible said and then when you really start getting down to what does it mean they don't have a clue of what you're even talking about because it's by divine revelation and anywhere that you and I go in this walk with God it is not governed by how many times we come to church what kind of offering we put in you that sometimes God's got to reveal certain things to them and if God don't reveal it to you you just don't understand it I realize in the message we've become become legalists and we've got to the place to where we have our own gospel measuring sticks of how we thank people on a lineup and how they ought to live and I understand if a now sister I'm gonna pick on y'all I see Lisa would read on so troubled this morning I'm coming back to the read where I read sister got a little red shirt on but as I told you some time ago there's a preacher said to meet I'm a woman wearing that means a sign of adultery somebody said what do you think about that I said they need to get out of the Scarlet Letter and get in the Bible but it's legalism you see what they're trying to do is they're trying to increase Christianity by their own measuring stick by their own steam and their own stamina and even Jesus said about your physical person that you cannot add a hair of your head you cannot make yourself taller or shorter you can't make this way or that but you are what you are now you could lose weight but you're still the same old person late you could gain weight but it's still the same old bin nor out gaining weight as he would be losing weight and it's the same Christianity it's the same Christian all together but we must realize God is the one that adds to our faith all of these characteristics of Christianity and you realize friends that a lot of time like we got a thing down in the South systems I was picking on you I'm gonna take that for you hey man we got a thing down in the south that women can't wear open-toed shoes our poor sister Adam sandals on this morning they would throw in hell for having a pair of sandals on somebody one preacher told my pastor he said well you realize the reason women can't have their feet exposed he said what's that he's because it comes to have a sexual problem I said my God if that's the case you've got a bigger problem than the open feet a man I saw I said about people in churches have a prostitute walked in this back door and she was dressed very poor and come sat down here on the front every brother in the church he'd have a pile of quotes on top of her but I said the Church of God I said have brothers and got anymore victory in their life than to let a prostitute walk in here so that she can get deliverance from Almighty God and it bothers them so bad maybe they're the ones that should be at the altar instead of her amen I agree she should be there too but what's the bigger problem but you see friends we get in our minds as Christians we think Christianity equals a live affection and a does Christ's perfection will be always in our something we'll always be people that will have to live by God's grace and live by God's mercy at no time and I'll walk with God does he ever just hand us the reins and say alright boy you've learned enough I will let you take care of the rest the Bible said he that began this good work in me and you he will miss this work a man under the day of Jesus Christ I am looking forward to him completing the work in my life but I can't move it myself I can't make things greater myself I can't add one cubic of my spiritual stature by taking thought or reading the Bible or listening to a tape I think people have gotten minds to be spiritual they've got to print two hours they got a Bible all the way through every year they gotta listen to every tape brother Brett I've ever said what are we going to do with them poor people in jungles that don't even have a tape recorder what are we gonna do a folks got Bibles but they got to hold his spirit they've got the leadership of the Spirit of God amen I understand if we've got the message if we got Bibles if we got time to pray we should do all that we can give our very best to the Lord Jesus don't you think so I think we should do our very best for all my honey God again but God can see a little pygmy down in a jungle somewhere that ain't even got a preacher and not to bring that man into the body of Jesus Christ he knows how to handle everything I think sometimes as Americans we get in our brain we we know a little bit more than God sometimes we may not say that from our mouth but our actions prove we'll bit too dependent they make little amen we're a little bit too independent we like to do things our own way and there's only two ways that way God's Way in your way God's will is the right way and then our way is the wrong way he's the one in control of everything I want you to stop and think about the parallel now between you and I and the people that Paul is talking about here now you realize this is the book of Ephesians these are the Ephesian leaders these are the Ephesian Christians 12 people that's what this is 12 folks Paul took on time to write to 12 people but Jesse I guess there's hope for me and you brother a lot of people think well if it's not a big crowd than it ain't God God sometimes dwells in the little crowds too he dwells in the little things not not sometimes the big speier up on the hill and and all that he dwells in the little things God is hiding and revealing himself in simplistic things that many times folks overlook man will overlook at a hundred times out of a hundred and that's where God hides himself this ephesian church program tells us in the church age book is going to be the pattern for all the rest of these ages do you realize these people are the pattern for you and I today and here Paul's tell them put away lying be angry and sin not Oh God it was quiet I thought she was quiet now I know you're quiet everything these people he's talking to her born-again Christians you say they're not read verse 30 and tell me they're not he says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye well who's he talking to these very same people in the fusion church he's talking to the very same Krissy whereby ye are sealed that's past tense these people had the Holy Ghost but yet Paul is dealing with them get rid of all of these entire ways because these people were drug in off the street wasn't Jews yo they wasn't raised with the book in their hand come on now they wasn't raised with their oxen with the prayer tap and they wasn't raised with the trees and their borders these people were raised off the streets Amen they might have come out of Liberty center they might have come out of Accra they might have come out of defiance who knows where they come from but they wasn't raised in the message that's what these people called the message of the hour his words was the message of that day can you say a man that's Bible that's what the Bible said that these people were followers of Moses and Paul is writing to people who had never been raised in a message church could you imagine a preacher in this day preaching to people who ain't message people oh they throw you out nomination of mark of the beast and all of that that's true I realize that we got all of those elements in the world I realize we got denominational people I realize that not everybody's message the message people who ain't message people amen and I said many times being in a message church doesn't make you any more of a Christian than standing in a garage makes you a mobile room room being a Christian means you must be born again by the Holy Ghost amen the Spirit of God must change your life all things are passed away behold all things have become new amen God's gonna change our life if God don't change it it'll never be changed Amen that's right that's exactly right Paul telling these people lying all right now I want you to listen to this in the jinnee adoption series brother Branham said this church was the most mature Church in the age I want to have to sink into your little skulls there's the fins calls this morning I want to have to soak into that membrane up here for just a moment I want you to think for a moment about what we're talking about here here these people now these are the people that the prophet of God said or the mature church will surely this is the mature tried wise you have to tell a lie if they're mature why is he telling them be angry and sin not because they need to know and in order to be a Christian you got to know you can't guess at it because if you guess you don't have a firm foundation of where you stand the only place that a person can really stand on as a firm foundation come on you say man it ain't gonna hurt you hey many of you getting a good a man stuck in you might hurt you you get it out sometimes there now thank these people are the ones that Paul addressed that was sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm just gonna take my time Engel Russia now think about this group that it's not like I said this isn't just a book we read these are people that live lives these individuals are hearing the Apostle Paul say to them put away lying speak trip with every neighbor are you kidding me I thought these people were sitting in heavenly places they were they were and Paul was hoping to keep him there in order to keep him there he had to come to chapter 4 alright and I don't you to forget this in verse 25 that's where we started right verse 11 tells them God gave them apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors for the perfecting of the saints for the edifying of the work of God and the ministry and all these things he just gets through telling them God has send it on high gave gifts down to man just read them first three or four chapters until you hit verse 25 and see if you don't drop open and looking at it here are these men and women that are supposed to be the most mature of the age Paul is telling them things that nobody else is hurt and then spends all this time dealing with this in Chapter four it doesn't make any sense to me he doesn't make it he says I mean humanly speaking if these people are sitting in heavenly places why is he telling don't give place to the devil why is he telling them he stoled don't let him steal no more be ye kind one to another because mature people still need the gospel preached to them because no matter how mature you might be you're still a human being oh praise the Lord Amen that woke a few of you up this morning that's right that's right all but rather bit I'm a child of God's over these I've got the Holy Ghost so today I'm born again so do these people I believe the message so did these folks but all of this had to be preached amen get it again put away lying now this this word lying it see Greek words Studios which is where we get the English word pseudo you probably heard that in Psychological terms a pseudo sizz basically an intentional falsehood an intentional falsehood Paul Stang quit intention and lying and put that away from you same people he said you're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with this is the same body that he said that Christ Christ is in you the hope of glory same group so he tells them in Ephesians 1 he said after you heard the word of promise the word of truth he said you were sealed with the Holy Spirit he said Christ is on the inside he's not in heaven any more ease in you deity dwells in you Christ isn't in heaven friends he's in you oh you got it in your mind that crisis in heaven he's not he's on the earth than you what formed Jesus is in right now he's in the form of the elect so brother branham said there's no hands mature hands he has no ears mature ears no feet mature feet oh you're getting quiet but I just quoted you a bunch of quotes if you believe the message should be able say amen to that amen DD's not in heaven so a brother man said deity is in you Christ in you the hope of glory so did these people why preach such things to them because they still were human beings right notice from the English this word pseudo means not genuine a sham a bogus a phony Paul is telling mature spirit-filled people don't be a phony don't be bogus Laura to God amazing amazing that it even saves such things notice put away all lying speak every man truth with this neighbor now this is not necessarily the Word of God but this word truth is ilithyia which is the truth in any matter of consideration meaning anything true either pertaining to God or pertaining to the duties of man truth isn't considered personal excellence or the candor of mind anything that is the opposite of a falsehood or deceit so Paul saying be honest with your neighbors speak truth one to another now watch how pop identifying that these Christians speak to one another you know sometimes we have people in our ranks that have a tendency to put on what I like to call false humility in other words you know you ask them how they're doing and they'll give you a 47 page dissertation on glory to God the Lord been so good to me and angels fed me cereal this morning and hallelujah and I was I was communing with Gabriel and I was I was praying and Michael was there I friends you and I both know that's not what we call reality a meant more likely it wasn't gable that poured your Cheerios it was Lucifer forgive me Amen most the time for it ain't got nothin to do with all of these airs that we put on as message people we like to do that where do you go to church I believe in the seventh Malachi 4 or 5 Luke 17 30 I try the Prophet not the second one not the fifth one but the right one there I had you for the right age Lord my time you get done with all that people that doesn't falling asleep on you they know what you get that because friends people in the world do not identify with shams or phony or bogus or put on airs they identify with real people having real experiences somebody the lady at the motel asked me she said you're the visiting preacher I said yes ma'am I am she's what kind of church are y'all I said we're nondenominational she said what does that mean I said it means we're not a denomination I read she got to talking a little bit and she said well III don't understand that I said well ma'am I said it's real simple I said the denominational Church gets that orders and their cues from a headquarters somebody tells him what to preach somebody tells him what's in the you know in the program that day oh she said I've been to churches like a minutes for this and ten minutes for that 30 minutes for that I said yes ma'am I said a non-denominational like we are we just go where the this tells us to Amen I know some pastor's brother Jesse that would have had heart failure when I walked out that office and stood in the congregation and you ain't allowed out in the church you're supposed to stay back there until they sing only believe all things are impossible hey but listen that's the thing about being free born by the Holy Spirit we have the ability to move as the spirit leaves us and then to move in the auspice and the action of the Holy not to be governed by some man's idea governed by some traditional thing some man's theology of how things should be done Amen like I said about sister Lisa in the red shirt like I said sister and her sandals that's man's idea of things I don't understand where people get such ideas it when we worship God we're supposed to worship in a certain way and for instance and I believe in all the worship of God that that that comes with rejoicing and clapping our hands and saying amen and hallelujah but you look at the world today people have become programmed I'm not my message people and you listen at them in different conventions and meetings you'll be out there and and and when the preacher says something good Amen everybody will clap in unison that's a worldly thing friends that's not the Spirit of God leading people that's a worldly thing that's a worldly move amongst the people of this message to clap in unison any hypocrite can sit there in the church and clap his hands along with you any any deceiver can clap his hands along with you but it takes a real child of God amen full of the holy go to setting' service Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday after Sunday and I believe it is the truth amen but any more our churches have got into this clapping thing everybody claps in unison and what is it it's a worldly idea it's a traditional thing people have gotten himself in such a tradition that if the preacher preaches beyond 45 minutes oh god they go to the two tablets of stone that's the conduct order and doctrine if you didn't know it Moses had his two tablets we got ours Amen they go to the two tablets of stone and they pulled out every court that they can where the prophet of God said most effective sermon is 45 minutes I know that quotes in there as well but better better I'm also said that if you're in a room full of believers he said you could stay there all night long how come they don't quote that one amen you know what it is tradition friends people are getting so stooped in tradition and so steeped in their ideas that you couldn't change him if you had a rocket to blow him out of there out of a hat of orbit nearly back home in Manchester it's an open country town I'm not throwing off on him but they the country they just don't have any class some of them people out there they just don't have any class and I know it's my hometown but it's my hometown I can talk about it if I want to some of them just don't have any class and our people out there they're becoming known for gas stations banks we're becoming the interstate town and then people setting out there the other day they had an old building they've been trying to fix things up and they hired a lady from Nashville my wife and I spoke to the man whom wife had actually hired the lady to come paint this mural on the side of the building okay Manchester Tennessee and you know United States of America and the lady paints a flag on the side of this building sister Wendy with a Magnolia you know what magnolias don't you with a Magnolia leaf coming right out of the picture that's a beautiful side and the elders of the town got angry at her and said it doesn't represent Manchester Tennessee said horse-trading would have been a better representation I said we are in the United States of America with an American flag on the side of the building how in the name of God don't that represent Manchester Tennessee you know what it is I'll read some comments again and again and again and again the people are still holding on to their ideas they don't want the town to grow we're becoming a drug town be coming to this town be coming to that town but they'll bring Bonner your honor ruin every year if you don't know what Bonnaroo is we just come through that Bonnaroo is basically Woodstock in Manchester Tennessee all of the big names the Olsen twins mary-kate and Ashley Olsen and Jimmy Fallon and they had Eminem here this year I mean all of the big Hollywood stars will bus International and Chattanooga flying and in there their million-dollar things and this at the other and they'll set that out in the middle of a cow pasture friends account so an announcer the joining for their stuff that they'll have all of them people congregate out there amen and bring all of them people out like that and then they'll have a battle cry over somebody painting a flag on the side of a building now I said all that to give you a real world example of where we're living at in people's today's thank you it isn't so much just message people but offer has become type people they've got their ways of doing things and they don't want nobody to encroach upon their way of doing anything didn't Redman tell us what this is lady or sea of people's rights I've got my rights you've got yours and don't affect my rights and I won't affect yours step on my dog I'm gonna kick your cat that's the way people in the lady of C&H thank so rather than progress rather than innovation rather do something that will benefit mankind and benefit humankind and help people along and make things better for life make things nicer people will split hairs over the tiniest little bitty things that's a spirit upon the world that was a spirit upon the churches when Paul's preaching these things he's trying to keep these demons off the children of God because friends if we're not careful will become the same way now listen III don't I'm not a Republican or a Democrat but I thought mister done an excellent job down North Korea the other day he walked in there and and completely D armed the entire nation I mean he D armed them ain't no telling what they're gonna get in return but he's a businessman he walked in there and I mean how many newscast before the man could even get from the negotiating table Fox CNN all the rest of was already flat off on the president oh you ain't done this in the ain't done that why it don't support their liberal agenda it don't support their homosexuals kissing in the streets in front of our kids and all the rest I'm not a politician this isn't a political platform but when you see the devil the devil is the devil amen and that spirit out there comes amongst religious folk because you realize friends the highest form of demon power there is is religion not politics but religion you'll never meet any more higher form of devil power than you will in the ranks of religion and look at people in the churches they don't want nobody to tell them how to live nobody to tell them how to act to tell them how to clean their lives let me do what I want to do I've got the books and the tapes like you do you that maybe so but you don't have a gift and you might have the same message book I got but my gift will bring things out of it that you can't do because you ain't got a gift to do it amen brother Jesse brother kam brother Simon all these gifted men that you enjoy their ministries all of these different brothers that are gifted in Jesus say he gave gifts under man hallelujah amen and what was it all those gifts the prophet of God said was in the Lord Jesus he was the gift and that what st. John 3:16 said God so loved the world he gave it was a gift and all them gifts was inside the Lord Jesus he had all nine spiritual gifts in him yeah this ministry gifts in it and when he came on the day of Pentecost he bursted himself up in a million different pieces and all of them gifts went into the body of Christ some people are gifted and woodworking some people are gifted in art some people are gifted in preaching I won't tell you how to paint your canvas if you'll keep out of my pulpit a man you understand me but people's rights lay do see him brother John they've got these ideas in their mind all we have to do things in a certain way and then what happens they end up doing it the same old way they've always done expecting a different result getting deeper in the traditional sin and that's what it is traditional sin not getting him any closer to God it's getting them into a way to where they absolutely cannot recognize the presence of God amongst them unless he comes the way they want him to and you know the definition that is a Jezebel because that's exactly what Jezebel was all about she wanted God sure but she wanted him the way she wants I said to a group of people here just the other day some of you all that are kind of quiet type people I don't sound like I'm gonna pick on you I've been picking on people all morning brother hey man but if the Holy Spirit moved on you and made you feel like you want to shout are you willing to shout if you say man to that you're not a Jezebel but if you're a quiet person the Holy Spirit moved on you and you is resistant to it that's a Jezebel spirit other way around if you're an emotional person hold on a moment now it's time to really listen and lock in would you cry now oh no we gotta make the service has to be loud to have a service maybe not maybe God wants you to think for a little while I've been in church services sometimes friends where God just wants you to think a little while amen amen somebody right but if you can say Lord what you want to do I'll let you do it that's not a Jezebel spirit that's an anointing that comes from a man or a woman that's willing to let Jesus have the right okay right all of these things that Paul said be honest one with another friends I think one of the biggest problems we've got in churches is people just ain't honest with one another if somebody hurts your feelings you know how you do brother did I offend you oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no and they got so much involved when they say them knows it's like that little old thing in a story I read that one time he said me thank you stile protesteth too much you know something's wrong rather than say well brother but be honest back on the other side you know I did get a little offended about that but I don't know why maybe it's just the way you said things or maybe I just don't understand you or maybe it's me I know you understand that people could talk one another like that they'd solve problems so quickly husbands and wives if they be honest one with another they'd solve things so quickly that's exactly right they'd solve things very fast but a lot of times we don't want to speak the truth because our pride keeps us from saying things that will make us vulnerable and as Christians we don't want to be vulnerable anything but vulnerability we've got the power to speak words so we can't be vulnerable and wise preaching this way to the mature people set in heavenly places he's trying to show them how to be a real world Christian you see if we become disconnected from the people we're trying to the people were trying to live right in front of if we become disconnected from the human side of things do you realize you can't even understand Jesus right unless you're connected with the human side of things because you look at Jesus standing there crying at the grave of Lazarus and said I thought he was God he was but he was also human man in case y'all forgot it Jesus was God but he was also a human being and when he stood there crying at the grave of Lazarus he was crying because his friend was dead that was the human side maybe that woman came to read around that time as a program Jesus was just a man and I can prove it and she brought him out scripture where jesus wept he said lady you remember his works he said your argument is thinner than the broth made from the shadow of a chicken started here and people that Bob Jones are passing out what theological terminology he said that doesn't prove anything you said it proves he was a man yes he said but who was that glory to God and then the scratch shoulders back wiped his face off and Lazarus come forth amen he said if he had not had called the name Lazarus he said the giant action would have taken place right there hey man yes he was God yes he was the Holy Spirit even in a human body but he was also a human being that was the part that made me love who Jesus was as an Old Testament you couldn't identify with the cloud between the cherubims it was hard to identify with a God that was above us but when God became with us all praise the Lord when God came down to become us it made God personable that we could understand him you see Jesus sitting on our Rock groaning with a headache how many can understand that mm-hmm you see Jesus sick in his body you see Jesus being made fun of you see Jesus being lied on how many can identify with that come on let me kid over chickens I be Eagles raise your hand up even then if that type of life that's what God wanted to do he wanted to make himself personal to us hallelujah amen that we could identify we could connect our self with that kind of God to become personal to you and I he would make sense to us because the God of the Old Testament didn't make sense it still don't make sense to a lot of people but the Old Testament you filter him into the life of Jesus Christ and look how that word comes alive well if it's that way in the Old Testament wouldn't it be that way in the New Testament you could hand somebody a book you could hand somebody a tape you can tell them about the prophet of God but unless all of that revelation filters into somebody they can work with somebody they see in a restaurant somebody they meet on the street it doesn't make sense to what you're even talking about they could study skills and thunders all day but never understand the revelation that's right oh thank you Jesus what Paul goes on to tell him now he said let all bitterness I what a statement let out bitterness go away from you now I'm coming down into the latter part of these verses we read this verse 31 let all bitterness and wrath anger clamor evil speaking be put away from you my the word bitterness here pick areia it is the extreme wickedness in some cases it's known as a bitter root producing a bitter fruit and some definitions mara denoting that which is bitter could also be applied to bile or gall that is secreted from your liver and intense bitterness you know how it is after you've had a stomach virus and sick and mid vomiting you vomit or puke out here which one you all do I done forgot ohioans I forget I've been in Tennessee so many years I guess it's the same thing with your vomit your puke and either way in it but in the stomach you understand after so long it's empty now we're getting ready go eat at lunch I don't mean to make you sick before I get into all this but I'm trying to show you what what bitterness is all about don't think about this when I get done saying all this just put it out of your mind when I'm done and maybe I should save it for tonight I don't know we may eat again tonight who knows but that which is in your stuff when your stomach is empty after a while you you you you feel that gaggy type feeling we call it dry heaving used to say it's sick he's dry heaving the bile and the gah that's inside of your stomach you know that sick type feeling a taste that gets in your mouth that that's something that gurgles happen when you feel so sick and you don't have anything else to vomit out this is what Paul called bitterness this is how God looks at bitterness in the human heart if you picture in your mind I'm trying to give you a word picture if you can picture in your mind that old sick feeling dry heaving nothing but gall in your stomach this is what God called bitterness amongst the body what know what and what a nasty horrible thing it is to God what a horrible thing it is to the believer to have such things inside of their heart remember the prophet of God in His Word to the church in Christ the mystery he exhorted the believers of the Branham time and are not the outsiders but the believers of the Tabernacle to not let the root of bitterness take hold in their hearts because this is what God looks at as bitterness exactly in the book of Job at different pots for example job 16:13 in job 20 in verses 14 and 25 of that twentieth chapter there 14 and 25 it's also referred to as the poison of serpents I think of this the poison of serpents the ancients erroneously believed was a Serpent's gull or his poison was what they would say the Serpent's gull again from this commentary from Adam Clarke he says Ross which generally translates goal in the English bow rendered hemlock in hosea chapter 10 verse 4 in Deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 33 in job chapter 20 verse 16 so going from 14 down to verses 25 you'll see different spots rosh r OS h which denotes the poison or the venom from the serpent remember this is what the serpent shot or put into the heart of Eve when he stood there taking the word and turning that word around I believed that he had to put some kind of bitterness of some sort against God and His Word in order to get her mind opened up because why would she think God was hiding something from her because the prophet of God said she looked at the serpent and realized God wasn't telling her everything what was it it was bitterness in her heart a little small something raised up well God's trying to hide something from me and the serpent said well of course he is that's what I'm trying to tell you I've been talking to you all these months and years Eve trying to let you know look at your dainty hands look at your figure look at everything else after the mouth is a pretty one except for when it comes to you you know why God made you special and after a while maybe the little shot and I'm bitterness or gall was placed inside of her heart just enough of a manner to where she could say well if that's the way it be maybe this guy knows something that I could really use he said I make you a god can I ask you a question what was she before the devil got ahold of her she was a god but you see how how pathetic and how pitiful the devil is he'll promise you something he can't even deliver on we call it bluffing he backed her out of her position but he shot into her heart the venom of gall the venom of golf business placed it into her heart I just kindly believe that's part of it oh there might have been other elements but that had to be somehow associated in there because why would a woman turn against God why would she turn against her husband why something had to take place other riders also say that it might be some very some kind of a plant that would bear these types of either poppies or some sort of a type of berry on this end of this plant and the Bible said that whenever this was offered to Jesus at crucifixion the wine mingled with gall you remember the case when they took it put it up on the salt and put it to his Barry had a type of poison in it that would work like an anesthetic over the human body and diminished the sense of suffering but the Lord Jesus had us on his mind that he didn't want to diminish not one bit of suffering he wanted to take the full brunt of God's wrath so that we could be liberated down the road Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God what Allah loved what I love what I love our savior has for us amen he didn't want to diminish not any sense remember the Bible said took it in his mouth and instead out when he realized what it was hey man it would make like that poison would almost I don't know if any of y'all like to cook but in Asian cooking they have a type it's not kimchi but it's the type of a type of seed I'll think of it in a moment and it numbs your tongue when you get a hold of it ask me again next week I may remember God I'm over 40 I done told you I keep forgetting things walk through the house so today I have my glasses on my forehead went for 40 minutes looking for my glasses here I'm a crazy for a man but it's a certain type of little seed you put it in your mouth you season your food with it and it will make you kind of numb a little bit I was trying to think of the name of it but this is the same type of idea that kind of this berry kind of had like a numbing effect almost like you think used to take that old did you ever use this stuff rub it on their chest when they had to cold it's got that my mom called it camphor it ain't camphor I don't know what they call that stuff but anyhow it's got that real that real heavy smell to it opens up your sinuses and you know stuff I'm talking about it's got that numbing effect on and bengay and and and and I see hot and these type of things they got that numbing type effect that's that's what this berry that's what this girl does to the human body it numbs their senses numbs their senses where they can't feel that's what bitterness does to a person it numbs them to the sensitivity to their brother to the word to the Spirit of God to everybody around them you look around this world people don't have any feeling anymore why they have ingested so much of this gall berry that his nunim and Jesus said they would be so drunk on it that the love of many would wax cold in the last days they can feed me now how are we supposed to bear burning as if you're eat up with bitterness how can I bear your burden and teach you the things of God and share things with you in the word and all that how can I do that if I meet up with a bitterness that numbs my very spiritual senses Oh God I can't feel for the people you realize this what happened to brother Branham when he got locked up in that complex he got a hold of some gall berries he got ahold of some of these berries that was numbing he said I gotta realize they're not sawdust he said they're flesh and blood he said I can't help him unless I can feel for them you take them with Moses standing there with them children sitting out there it shouldn't the Israel children of Israel rather them them children of God that had called out in there they are they they've done idol worship they've they've they've carried out about Moses I'd like to do in a wrong way and - stood there in the gap between God and the people and God take them not me he didn't eat gall berries that's why he could do it there was nothing at him glory to God he had a feeling for his people and if you don't feel for your family like that your family's gone you don't feel for your church like that your church is gone I don't mean just the I mean you sitting right in here because remember the church is not the preacher the people or the church you are what makes up the body deacons don't control the church the pastor don't even control the church the Holy Spirit controls the church and all of us are subject to the Holy Spirit how can we be subject to a god that we've lost feeling in that we can't feel him when he moves we can't feel sensitive when he wants to speak to us and tell us things Amen have we got ahold of rosh have we got ahold of gall berries have we got ahold of spiritual hemlock that it's made us something to the things of God that a man can preach a holiness sermon we were got the door and say all that his idea of it that's goal that's bitterness Paul said let such things depart from you you see this is why this was a mature church because they could take into their hearts this understanding of the word and receive it Paul wouldn't have preached to him this way there couldn't it took it that's the reason I'm preaching it to you because you can take it you believe these things amen I believe it's right right now watches evil speaking the word he uses here for evil speaking is blasphemy ax which means to slander or speech interests to another's good name the prophet of God said you don't have to take a gun and shoot a man speak against his character and you've already killed him you blaspheme his name it's what Paul said let all blaspheme depart from now we would never want to blaspheme the name of God you're saying out there and you let somebody come in and and and sit down in a restaurant maybe they said old cuss word with the name of the Lord taking in vain are you jelly do you cut him a look out of your eyes don't you look at me that way I know you would I would - ha ha ha - ignore him yeah but in your you'd be thinking you rascal you you need to get saved come on church so much Sam so smut thing about the Lord which say you have a crutch you need to get the Holy Ghost sure we would we'd tell them some cases we probably reach out and take a mother do that you're getting quiet on me but it's the truth we would sure would but we blaspheme one another's name and not worry about that old so and so and so and so and such and such and let me tell you what the problem was so and so is and you know such and such and his we're blaspheming each other's names remember the prophet of God said your attitude towards your brother could determine their eternal destination your attitude toward one and your attitude toward the other is your attitude toward Jesus Christ as well sure somebody sat down with you a cigarette hanging out of him out and took the name of the Lord and bet he's a shot your mouth you filthy thing but we let it go on about each other in the churches one speak ill of another run and run down another's influence blaspheme their name and it doesn't even bother us wonder if we hold our berries god help us let me go just a bit further and listen let's close times getting away from us but be ye kind one to another I'm gonna pick some of this up again and out we got a whole lot more here to deal with but I'm just going to get the the foundation of this this morning but be kind ones another I like the meaning of this word it means fit for use to be useful to be virtuous or to be mild now you realize that Christians are supposed to be mild type people not rude not in jurists but mild type people how can a man who says he loves you say he loves you and then say something so hard and harsh and mean all the time I make you wonder sometimes even in marriages you take a man always putting his wife down a wife always putting her husband down but you're in the rubber meets the road oh I love him you might love him in principle but you don't love him in your actions to love him you got to have the type of attitude all the time that shows you love him right being kind one to another be useful to one another be vacuous to one another be mild to one another and you say why is this important because here's why the prophet of God if as I've tried courted to you if you said deity is in you and not in heaven if Christ is in your heart and you're a Holy Ghost field child of God if the Spirit of God is in me and the Spirit of God is in you then that means that life passes from one member to another do you realize if we've got the right attitude one to another when you walk up and shake out his hand you could pass virtue from you to that brother or sister in the message Messiah 1961 revenge said in divine healing they have proven that there's a light passes in divine healing they put a little tinfoil he said between he said a light passed from one hand to another in divine healing when the when the person was healed by the prayer of faith you have something inside of you that can pass one to another people said I to be nice to them but you do because we're not going to heaven with just you and Jesus we're going to heaven with one another so we have to learn to love one another that's what Paul's teaching the people here in barns notes you said be ye kind one to another which means to be mild courteous or polite back home some of the boys somebody was a critic one time to me and said why you like him boys do - and glorify God I said I'd like to get him just to open the door for the girls first I said we'll work on shot and repenting later if I can just get him to pull their seed out and offer to a sister that's happened to stand around be courteous be polite this is real Christianity people don't want to hear your brother random stuff but if you're nice to him they'll listen to you if you're nice to him they'll they'll respect you most people I know there's people in this world wouldn't respect God if he was standing right in front of them with a million dollars they would spit in the face of God of God offering eternal life on a silver platter I realized that I realized there are people in this world that I like yet I realize that no matter what you do you're gonna have the evil amongst you like the poor you'll always have the evil amongst our bodies are changed but as a Christian my responsibility is to be courteous to people to be nice to be polite to people oh my what do you think they're gonna see first how many quotes you have memorized or whether when a sister walks through the door they don't even have to be a sister just a woman you open up the door for I know brothers this is turning y'all upside down probably glory to God I got a lot to work on him but this is what being a Christian is all about they'll see your politeness and your courteousness before they'll see anything else do you also realize that one of the biggest complaints that people from the outside have about people in this message nobody's nice to him I've lost count of the times I've heard people leave a message search and their very words was nothing about doctrine nothing about disagreeing over revelation but people just went nice to me at that church they went on about their own business nobody would even talk to us nobody fellowship with us nobody her hand was in the hospital X amount of days nobody even called us come on somebody this is Christianity yeah you're getting quiet on me now hallelujah must be hitting the bull's eye praise the Lord Almighty this is Christianity we talk about Christianity but we put in parentheses to it all the great revelations that we believe put them on the bottom part and next to Christianity start putting in parentheses kindness courteousness politeness we raise our kids to say yes ma'am and no ma'am yes sir oh no sir not if I was to say hey Jesse what that's the day and age were living in a friend of Samantha's come over from Austin and we were sitting at the table and she looked at Sam she said you Americans the rudest people ever seen him ha ha she said how come she said ain't nobody ever says yes ma'am no ma'am sir ma'am what what huh but we raised our people to be polite to be courteous you're the prophet of God start a service when he says ma sure like that good singing I heard out there on up for some people that's far oh there are realms of Christianity but don't forget these are the who are the the ages that's who Paul was talking to be nice be polite courteous si goes to prove us deep people we need this too practical applications bender odd a man that's what this is glory because what do you think causes problems in the church between married folk I don't never down and talk to married people and the man said over in one corner the woman's and I said what's the matter since he got start on his fan of Godhead I've never had a man look at me and say that woman don't even understand their opening of the seventh seal but a hundred times out of a hundred you know it comes out of their mouth I can't even get him say I look pretty anymore I can't even get him to compliment my dress every time I do you huh on the other side sis you don't give him a chance to compliment it either oh god it getting quiet Jesse hallelujah hoping poor folks on the internet still holiday man when they get this come on now you think holds the glue that holds marriages and things together it's transparent Christian character it holds it together you know how many preachers I that have lost their families tremendous speakers charismatic speak to thousands at a time control their attention and put the ayats into a frenzy and lose their family because they were so concerned over their preaching that they didn't stop to be a father and stop to be a husband this is what Paul saying friends whether you can understand it or not be courteous be polite this is the foundation of what makes us the kind of people we are your rest of the world ain't going to operate this way and if they do they might be nice people but there's an end to that but for a Christian when they're bitter against you and they're mean against you in this macho on one cheek by the Holy Ghost baptism you still have the ability to turn your other cheek to these people you still have the ability to pray for them to despitefully use you and persecute you because it's a child of God Oh over to go its way inside of you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got a well you can draw from you got a source you can pull from hey first peter 3:8 there's a there's a version here and i'd like to read you from but look here first peter 3:8 read it in the King James and I want to read you this other in here I'm closing just a little bit I see the time I know we got lunch and then service again so I'm gonna try not to hold long I'll do my own preaching tonight but stay going just cuz I said that now finally be ye all of one Oh what oh my god you talk about miracles to get me in you in the same mind you like cherry pie and I like apple pie you like blue and I like green you're already scrunching your faces how how is God going to get us in this kind of condition it's gonna take the Holy Ghost to bring us into such a state of loving one another and kindness and politeness one to another that we are gonna be able to make this scripture live we may not all agree with our carnal thoughts our thoughts merged but if you practice this kind of idea a big kind one to another even if you bitterly disagree you can still be of one mind listen that's what God said he said if you can't better just agree with a man and still love him he said you need to go pray up I'm paraphrasing but that's the idea you ought to be able to love somebody that disagrees with you this is how we get in one mind having compassion one of another love is brethren be pitiful be my goodness I don't see any Seventh Seal in there brother Jesse I don't see any thunders but this this is Bible scriptures given uh huh wonder wonder why he's preaching this to converted people because how of the world gonna know you're converted if you lack hey that's just the rubber meets the road how are you gonna know you're converted if you don't have this right here if something and you don't change and you don't have this feelings were all humanity how do you even know you're converted just hide I love God I love you and not just love you when you're loving me but love you when you don't love me will preach brother V and I think I will right this is said the translation Christian will produce a true courteousness and politeness it does not make one rough crabbed or sour that's what I said all over the world I said man people want everybody's shot run speak in tongues see visions I said I just want to get him smiling first if I can get to church to the smilin stage I think we're in good shape principle the most unhappy message people are some of those that unhappy people ever met my life hey come to church even preach to Humber now and they don't smile once and the longer you go the worse that expression gets I don't know I couldn't get my face that long as long as I've seen some people get it but Christianity should produce joy hey man it should produce something our hearts go over to God that produced my face that the world sees our salvation hey man hey man how do I know that what you gots good for them if it's made you look like that lordy God I'm a Christian don't you want what I want good god no it might be contagious no wonder young people in this message have run from this message because they don't see the joy the politeness the courteousness they don't see those Christian qualities existing amongst the people that they call mom and dad if you don't see it they're friends I don't know where I don't know where else you could see it another writer said the secret of true politeness is benevolence a desire to make others happy amen well it's always made me happy but if you're a Christian you are concerned with the happiness of your brother not yourself but your brother there's no religion matthew henry says that is sad glory to god misanthropic temper how about a ten barrel wert not in rudeness stiffness repulsiveness and none violating the rules of good breeding ha ha Laurie that's what we need some good breeding around the message teach people how to be like ladies and gentlemen some of the most rude and arrogant people I've ever met were people that called William Branham the Elijah prophet of this hour hi because that's the kind of devil that will hide around the ranks of truth like this and if he gets the world so be it but if he can sour the whole apple bunch and a message that's got the biggest brightest apples that's ever been given well then he's accomplished something then I just did a we redid an interview I don't know how many saw the interview on YouTube Lilly Columbus her name you can't see it on the on the first take we did my wife is sitting right there next to looks like I'm in a room with this girl I told her I said we're gonna fix that Lilly but I did this she asked me a question and she told me she said I'm not gonna tell you what the question is we're just gonna go at it that's okay so we sat down and she asked me the question or women underestimated in this message anybody see the interview I use this this terminology I said matter of fact I said some people bully women in this message I've lost count of the people that have come to me and grabbed me by the hand men and women I like brother bin if there ever was truth that's it because it's true you come to the house of God us and some of you women have been sitting here all these years you haven't put a pair of scissors in your hand to cut your hair you wore pants and makeup and on and on and on but yet you come to the house of God and what's the first thing the preacher starts we'll hammering and beating on women cutting their hair as bullying friends it's bullying a woman wants to grow and develop in the character of Jesus Christ just like us men do I think we should respect our sisters and preach to them preach to them things that will bring them up in Christianity if a woman ain't got no more revelation to quit cutting her hair you beaten her heading Omega stop it a man the Holy Spirit has to make him stop it what good does it do to bring him to church every time they walk through the doors yeah yes and you put him in a place of submission sure but put him where God put him don't drive him down and make him a bunch of doormats I had a woman that left over the believe the sign move she wrote me after that interview she said brother band I just finished watching your interview about how we should respond to the believe the sign people you know my answer to was be nice to him don't I had message preachers look at me as a hot new are you talking about I said don't fight him don't be mean to him they left for a reason there's a reason they left a young one one young sister write me and she said brother Ben she said I don't agree with you and you don't agree with me she said I do not believe brother Brown was a prophet I said fine whatever they don't matter to me no skin off my teeth you'd you don't have to eat Paul was an apostle I don't care what you believe that's up to you I'm not called a God to make you believe nothing I'm called a God to preach you can believe it or not it's up to you she wrote me back and she said I've never met a message preacher like you she said all these other guys they tell me I'm going to hell that I blaspheme the Holy Ghost she said I watched your interview and you're actually saying be nice to us you're the first message preacher and this girl come from a prominent area that ever even made such a remark and I said to myself how sad that is when we should be the ones when we see people leaving the message and me and discouraged and we should be the ones to reach our hands out and say look brother you may you may have been mishandled you may have been mistreated we redid this interview on the boolean and I mean I went after a hundred miles an hour I said Lily we're gonna do this interview better my wife is gonna be in the picture this time and we redid this interview and I made this remark I said many of you people remember this to go on that youtuber to go around the world when she posted ain't no telling how many places will go and I made this remark I said a lot of the people have left this semester's they had in their mind it's because they were mistreated and there was nobody good and this sat in the other I said you people out there you ain't never come talk to me or talk to this little woman sitting here next to me I said because not all of us men in this message think our wives are dog meat in doormats I said there's some of us that respect real women a real one the prophet of God said a real lady he said well what man would give a drop of blood he's got to defend her honor a little woman but preaching like that it ain't gonna get me into big conventions but it's needed more now than has ever been needed before because nothing against revelation nothing against opening the word nothing against thunders and seals but what we need in the ranks of this message is we need an old-fashioned baptism of these principles right here how to be courteous how to be polite how to be nice one to another how to speak sweetly with people how to make everybody else happy instead of looking at ourself all the time right listen to this I've read to you some lot of these commentaries one reason I do that is III know people hear things in different ways and I like the different approaches but let's read from Elijah for just one full week before we quit for the afternoon flashing red light remember said one of the most miserable things Oh God now what he's getting ready to tell us is going to be worse than cancer because this is a man who's seen all kinds of enters of diseases you name it brother Branham says get ready tell us one of the most miserable things you won't know what it is a man or woman who's just lived an old Mossback church member never accepted Christ meaner than Satan himself setting out with some old crabs something on him he says this is a man's been up against witch doctors this is a man who has seen all kinds of crippling diseases from leprosy to you name it this is a man who has seen people's noses eat off because of cancer he saw their bodies wasted emaciated wait until they're just skeletons and he said the worst most miserable thing he's ever saw was somebody as a church member with a crabbed old spirit on them oh god I should have the altar right now that's the harmless crown that Satan can crown a life with think of this now this is June of 63 seals are open thunders have sounded and yet brother branham is still feeling the need to talk this way to people he said the horriblest crown satan could crown of life with he said a grouchy old woman about 60 or 70 years old fat hanging down underneath their arms in wrinkles all over her face her hair bobbed up four or five different colors strutting with a pair of little shorts on if that ain't the crowning of satan I've never seen it some old crab in man he said he said I've got to die said I hope that God never let Satan cram in with an old crab in different man my wife an old nagging woman or your wife that way I pray brethren let our lives be crowned with the fruits of the spirit love joy long-suffering gentleness patience truth faith in the Holy Spirit on a scale what's greater when you learn the revelation and you learn the seals you've learned them you don't go back over it once God revealed to me about the thunders that's always been a revelation to me once I understood the Seventh Seal I've understood it once I knew water baptism I was baptized that was the end of it once I understood the Godhead I never just struggle with trinitarianism but I do wrestle with bitterness I do wrestle with unhappiness I do wrestle with anger I do wrestle with these other things you understand what I'm saying these are the things that you'll deal with every day of your life so if you're going to put it on a scale which one's more valuable well I didn't come to yell at you but I come to get us somewhere if we're gonna get there if we just listen to the word the word will teach us uniting time inside remember said I don't say much about it you know who said around people complaining but I think one of the most horrible things is to see a man and woman constantly complaining I've always said God keep me that weakens faith all the time Wow complaining weakens faith he said you know each one of us is going to get older something's gonna happen he said sure little things are going to keep accumulating as you get older they've got to listen but I think one of the most horriblest things is for satan to crown some person's life a crabbit old man or woman I hope I don't get to that place I hope I can bear my burdens get to a spot I want my life crown with the glory of God long-suffering gentleness peace meekness filled with the Holy Spirit think about that that a person could come to a space time is going to render circumstances time is going to take us in a direction of experiences and the older we get the more we're gonna have so what Satan's greatest weapon gonna be against some of us not that secret website that starts talking about the trinitarianism or that text message from that former believer that's it have you seen the bridge that angle effect half-up have us won't even probably give it a second thought but say after about a year of one thing after another after another after another and the middle of the night the devil says some wrong view well you may not I'm a Christian yeah but views a Christian would but all this be happening to you look at some solitaire don't happen to them look at brother so-and-so but just as sudden the devil puts on me all the time because I preach the gospel holiness bare fisted look at something so how he's blessed so-and-so asked him to preach so-and-so invites him over to such and such in such place what about you I don't mean this arrogantly but by the time my pastor retired January 7th by January 8th my schedule is all the way out here - brother Jesse's right here I got String a meeting I'm working on the rest of the year I'll finish the year out in just a few weeks time and Satan come to me in the middle of the night and tell me he don't ever say to me you're doing a good work for the Lord God's really been blessing you boy you're helping people everywhere you go he don't ever tell me that but he always tells me about you know this may come to an end for you one day people get tired that kind of preaching you do I'm gonna want you back and their churches no more it's amazing that he don't come to me and say Jesus is really the second person of the Trinity I've never had the devil meet me in the middle of the night and say you baptized right but he works on that side of my mind wonder what so him so thinks about you wonder what so-and-so thought so-and-so talk to him you know they did and they said such and such and so and so and so and in the middle of the night you got all this working on your mind you know the devil is trying to do he's trying to offer you a boysenberry I know Disney misses at 90% of the time but that witch with the Apple in her hand she did have some truth give me right closing brother branham said in speak to the rock you said the Israelites cut off their spiritual supply through carnality that's what Paul was trying to keep him out of carnality what destroys a church carnality yes it ain't that God wouldn't come bless us in all of our mistakes and all of our misgivings listen I don't go to school to learn how to do what I'm doing right now if I do it wrong it's because I'm ignorant don't know how to do it right yet come on somebody and nobody teaches you how to be the right congregants either it about to go to school to be the right kind of message person anybody I think I'm thinking about seriously starting to school though I'll tell you that right now first place I'm all start as Amen classicist releasing worship 101 with Jesse and I'm hiring you and Sam to help me teach because your teachers but carnality what ruins it not not that you and I played this thing a thousand times and made 10,000 mistakes on it played it in the wrong key played it in their own tempo I made a bunch of mistakes playing this morning I get my eyes closed and get the worst but I'm not going to looking at my fingers and I'll hit every wrong key in the book and believe me I don't like doing that when you got a guy like him sitting in the congregation but that ain't what stopped the Holy Spirit from coming on me no he blessed me this morning while I was singing I hope you were blessed but I got blessed I felt his presence I know Sam was trying but she was doing her part sure but it didn't have nothing to do no no I me I sat down there and played with all my mistakes and I me not y'all me I got blessed sitting there playing this morning God didn't the blessing cuz I hit a wrong note every now and then but what would mess it up or analogy trying to outdo the next guy trying to be too perfect trying to do things for show carnality what ruins it if you got a guy up here leading singing so you walk out lord have mercy he was in twelve different keys god bless today how what ruins it carnality such-and-such church over there has got a real song leader Jessie I'm throwing off for you I'm just using examples they got a gather and he can sing in all twelve keys and he holds his pitch and he knows how to get her done but maybe God don't want that guy over here maybe God wants it just like it is I'll admit Samantha put a little thing on Facebook I got to laugh because people are so silly you'll have to forgive me if I'm stiff I ran a mile the other day my sore all over my body my girls have been laughing at me for three days I get hardly walk this whole thing this guy was trying to sing looking for a city Brian free they go up up up up up up and it is the god awful of Smiths you've ever heard in your life and it wouldn't have been a problem if the guy hadn't started bragging when he got started I took on mr. free and made him give up and I've been asked to sing his heart out of the country I just got to laughing I said people are silly and this boy he's a good kid he's got a sense of humor too he laughs at himself somebody wrote on a he's trying to do something for God and God's been blessed by it I thought how silly people can be its carnality it's obvious the kid can't sing it's obviously don't know how to sing he know and everybody listening to it knows it but just like elbows everybody's got an opinion and carnality starts tearing the church apart this is why Paul said keep that stuff out of these churches don't be Arnel like that if a man can't sing or a woman can't sing don't boast yourself like you can and if you can really really really really really really sing don't put down the ones that can be encouraging one to another uplift one another build people up be you kind one to another you stammer coming from somebody that's take it on mister free he's tough looks like a man sings like a girl that's what a tenor singer is I used to do it brother Jesse I could crack glass I could sing so high I loved it and I would get in that room of mine I had a little damp with a microphone and I turn on him gospel tapes mine I didn't know all them years he was listening to me but he was and I get it and sing with him tanners boy and let me tell you something it wasn't it was bad because there would be times I couldn't reach the note and I'm squealing and squawking and carrying on it's awful god-awful mess you ever heard in your life can't get it done but you I can't lost count of the times that I get a nurse singing like that and hold of spirit come in the room because I wasn't mean I'm trying to teach you something if you're listening close that's what kills our walk with God quicker than anything else carnality now if you go do something for God do the best you can you're gonna sing be the best thing you can go and play be the best player don't get in ruts move on break things up I tell people you worship God in church you raise your left hand all the time put the left now put your right one up every now and then if you come to church say Amen amen amen said glory glory glory next time then next time hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah me and Jesse we're hand clappers I like to clap my hands so but every now and then I get in a rut with head yes so you know what I do I don't just clap my hands I jump up my leg this thing to keep getting stuck in a rut because as people that have been freed by this Holy Spirit message we are not under bondage anymore we should not be under the bondage of carnality Amen listen this I'm closing brother Branham said that's what's the matter with the churches the wreaths a fuss the reach they quarrel the reason they stir so called Christians because they bypassed the land of blessing the fountain that never runs dry he said people come in carnal a bunch of holy rollers days of miracles has passed no such thing as those things he said but let him come to the water one time he says like an old plant he said there's anything I hate he says Arizona an old hot desert but he said on that cactus he said there's a sticker on it but that sticker at one time was a flower it just lacks water you know what it looks like when an old flower dries up it goes from being like this to being like this what happened to him carnality cut off the flow of the blessings let him get to the water one time it won't just open up their hands like this but it'll open up their attitude it'll open up their feeling it'll open up all these things that makes us Christians in the sight of God I know I know people my daddy my mama yeah a hundred miles night that's where I get it my daddy just sits and grins he don't hardly say two words I put all over the country of my dad going from one meeting to another to another he might say three words every time in the car I said y'all right you did okay yeah that's about all she wrote yeah I mean you did good out of it got a nature about him he's got a way about him and I realize that what we go to church not every time we went to church I didn't expect to see my daddy rollin in the floor or screaming amen and hallelujah but you know something interesting that quiet man he's 83 now I hope God gives him a lot of years I'd hate to lose him but it hadn't been good the last couple of years has health been bad but I remember when he would have flop in the floor like a fish after the Holy Ghost would strike him speaking in tongues shouting in the spirit something contrary to nature carnality will always allow you to go along with your own carnal ways but the Holy Spirit sometimes will call you to do things different I'm not talking about if you're a quiet person you're gonna start screaming tomorrow but I mean sometimes if you're an isolated type person more of an of an introvert the Holy Spirit might make you open up that hand just to shake hands and be friendly one to another because I sometimes friends we want to see the hands go this way but in churches I like to see them go this way too praise Lord I'm quitting I know I've done said it 40 times but I am quitting but this is what Paul is trying to tell him be ye kind one to another God help me Lord help me Jesus help me to be able to live what was pronounced in in words over 2,000 years ago help me make it live Lord let's pray together Lord Jesus father I want to thank you for the message this morning Lord it's been a really in-depth a lot of simple things in here but Lord at the same time a lot of important things I just pray you'll help us with this help us be able to receive everything you placed in this word this morning god help us to look at things in a certain light because Lord sometimes I think my mind I get so focused on one thing see it a certain way Lord if you'll change my view and let me see it in that certain light that right Holy Light and Lord the thing I've been looking at all these years becomes a complete different thing altogether Lord sometimes that ain't that we mean to be this way it's just we're just not seeing it right but God help us as your children help us to be courteous to be polite help us to examine our own ways our own attitudes our own behaviors and help us be able to reflect and say Lord am I the kind of person that's polite and my courteous and my nice and my friendly all right here brother Brett talk about Sumida she had type of nature he said that German nature is always a quiet type nature he talked about how the people who speak to her on the street she wouldn't even speak back he's a meaty speak to that woman talk to you what was it Lord as a nature it was just something built into that human probe hey Lord maybe I'm sure sister Minnie probably didn't mean to do it like that it's why brother BAM is telling about it Lord we look at our own selves do we do things just because it's what feels comfortable for us or God are we doing things because we just don't want to do it exact hey lord I pray that you'll help me not to let my own nature dictate how I live as a Christian let the nature of the Holy Spirit that it lived through a separate in Jesus name yes Oh God [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes Lori not false doctrine not an idea trinitarianism or false memories and whatever Pillai and my courteous is my attitude toward my neighbor right do I hide things do I am i acting like a phoney am i honest with my brothers with my sisters me three this power has just a moment let's just search our heart for just a minute now here I have singing and everything I've kept you here two hours god bless your honest hearts babies in your arms kids everywhere sitting here in this heat just take a

brother I want to speak in truth what I speak to my sister when speaking truth I don't want to be a phony I don't put a sham on it's false humility as the word says I am what I am by the grace of God I just want to be Ryan for just a moment I just examine your heart just before I'm not gonna ask any more of you you've already given so much this morning just to try to stick with the person this long let's just want you to take a moment I just ask the Lord God if there be anything in my heart like this at all Lord help me get it out Lord help me purge that amount of my life Lord any of these things that may be displeasing to you search my heart Jesus give me the right attitude the right spirit and my friend if you don't have the Holy Spirit today you haven't got started this way you need to be born again if you're backslidden you need the Lord Jesus to put his arms around you and bring you back so if you're a sinner this morning or to him and tell him Lord you see my heart I'm give him up you I'm asking you to take over and do things for me but I can't do for myself hallelujah we cannot be our own personal we cannot be our own private Savior we have to have a Savior and Redeemer father Lord just for the last few moments of this service we're just asking you to search our hearts Lord after a message like this God just scour us out as brother Brown would say clean us out my granny used to call it squeaky clean make it that way or take all these old gall berries out of our heart the Rasta hemlock the gall from the serpent take all that out of us lord help us have such a love such a feeling old God granite Lord I pray in Jesus name in Jesus name god bless you tonight brother Jesse comes the same again search me [Music] [Music] [Music] I enjoy the word today it's a beautiful message just simple Christianity the real key to that is charity the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] remember we preach on the statue firm and we're brotherly kindness is the last thing we have to have then God knows the Holy Ghost to make sure we treat the family of God the right way oh it's so important to be kind to one another courteous someone says God bless you say god bless you back someone doesn't say it's good to see in the house of Lord today be so kind be so sweet open the door you know it whatever you can to show somebody how much you love them jesus said you'll know my Christians because they can quote all the quotes now they'll know they're Christians because of your love for one another hey God is so good to us I'm not gonna it's already two o'clock but you know we would have stood outside talking anyway till 2:00 so don't okay that go get mad at anybody be kind be polite we all would have been fellowshiping out there anyhow let's get remember that last name brother Bram said to the church there the Christ in ministry he said he said Satan will let you stay a happy family used to try to anoint somebody with poison inject some bitterness into the church so we got to say God keep me free from all the gall keep me free from all the bitterness help me just to be above love I mean just to be a source of love and strength for everybody how many want to be a source of love not contention not fear bitterness anger but a source of divine love let's pray fathers were dismissed we raise our hands to say Lord I want to be one of those my hand defy gravity because I want to be one of those that our source of love a source of strength source of edification encouragement father use us all for that purpose nor that we might love one another Lord if we've been down lord help us so we can have a smile on our face if we've been discouraged or help us so we can thank you and start lifting our hands and say thank you for another day of life help us to count our blessings the Lord as we've seen that song one by one the greatest blessing we have is that you took our sins on a cross 2,000 years ago now you've invited us to the marriage supper the lamb of the Branson that's the greatest privilege we could have has to be invited to that supper thank you for the cleansing power in the blood of Jesus Christ wash this congregation or washes if there's anything we done wrong forgive us help us to make it right it was to be vessels of love vessels of Honor thank you Lord for the patience of the saints hearing the word of God patiently sitting in the or we're just so grateful to hear your word now let us would it do to you so God let us humble ourselves let us love one another in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless you were to sum is here by God's grace [Music]
