few prayer requests the amen said that uh some of the eviction for the people there's going to be a lot of evictions because of the some of the government regulations i guess with the covid uh covet situation some of the deadlines are running out so a lot of people are facing evictions let's pray for all those people if you know someone in that situation let me know i don't know anybody in that situation but we can pray praise god we can pray that's one thing we can do so thank you brother i didn't even know about that so thank you also they're actually i saw this week they're trying to get a stimulus build pass i don't know if that would help those people or not but let's just pray for mercy for those people struggling that need a home there's a lot of riots last night i didn't see all the article but i guess there's continual rides let's pray for those to end uh amen another request and pray for salvation for lost family and friends great requests there a few announcements uh today i'll give my testimony i'll try to keep it my sermon short and just give a little bit of my testimony my wife will give her testimony this evening next sunday my uh my oldest niece graduates i'm sure to graduate from high school but having a party next sunday so next sunday sunday only one am service i'm gonna cancel the pm service so i can go i haven't she's 18 i haven't been to any of her any of her events she just grew up like that that's how fast 18 years went so i got to make it to her graduation that's right you guys went to graduation a few weeks ago right that's right good thing such a good thing to do uh that may be my only time to really see her for a while because we don't see her much anyway but anyways next sunday one service only 11 a.m no 4 p.m um and also one request i've kind of had on my heart if anyone wants to help me out i've i have like 50 extra copies of my book that i ordered that are just laying in my my office if anybody wants to do like a mailing ministry let me know if you have any free time i like to just i want to get a list of all the message churches and just mail one piece of paper and just offer my book for free to them and just make people aware of it you know there's so many message churches they just don't know about it like all these books sitting there i don't want to charge anybody unless they want to support us but brother ramsey if they can't afford the book give it to him so that's my desire i try to operate my ministry the same way people can support praise god if not that's fine but if anybody i wouldn't be ready to do it this week but if anybody would want to start maybe next week let me know it would all it would involve just folding a piece of paper sealing an envelope putting a stamp on it and writing their address

bless your people bless this word glorify your name in our lives let's go to i believe ephesians chapter one i like to begin a just another mystery series here we finished uh the statue perfect man godliness restored to man we finished that on wednesday night what a wonderful lord bless praise god just looking forward to another time in his presence hearing his word ephesians one not just read one verse i want to kind of conserve the time and uh just so you know i'm trying out some new contacts you know so it's strange that's blurry for a long time and then it's clear for a long time so it's it kind of switches back and forth so if you see me blinking it's because i can't see you're around that's one of those times right now they're supposed to work better than this i know that anyways i haven't bought them yet so i'm saying i could try up here anyways if you see me blinking that's why i can't no everything's blurry ephesians 1 9. i wore contacts for all of high school and college and then i took 14 years off and i just thought i'd try them again since lydia liked them so much but this pair is not working out anyways uh we know we need 20 20 with god's word praise god that's what we need and i believe we are getting in this year as well it's becoming more and more clear to us uh the truth of god's word ephesians 1 9 let's read it together on three one two three having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself may god has blessings the rhema's word you may be seated praise god this is a great subject uh the mystery of god's will to be looking at this uh topic and i could have went numerous ways i was kind of praying beforehand i still need to preach to you the godhead revelation although that's very familiar israel's blindness the new testament church composed of jew and gentile uh the church is the bride and then the mystery of iniquity i still have those mysteries series left to preach and i trust they've been a blessing praise god hope you've enjoyed them i've really enjoyed them as well uh real quick i just got a text from brother steven his car broke down so can we just have a word of prayer for him let's pray for him that's why he's not here this morning so let's pray father we love you lord again we just bless your holy name father you said you're ever present help in time of trouble so lord be with our brother stephen his car broke down he couldn't be here today uh father send in help send him lord finances to take care of these bills that are going to come up lord god and lord he might return to church no doubt he enjoys the house of the lord and he's been a good faithful member here lord god we thank you for his love and his fellowship and his support father be with him i pray lord let all these uh obstacles be taken out of the way in jesus christ's name amen amen praise god so uh thank you for praying for him he sent me the memory verse for august so next sunday we'll read a memory verse for our brother okay so everything's blurry now so if you see me really leaning in now that's why okay so uh we kind of looked at this subject when we looked at the uh the purpose series how many remember that i was i kind of got inspired i read the book uh the purpose driven life by rick warren it's a fantastic book if you haven't read it i would encourage you to read it if you don't have nothing else to read it's a 40 chapter book i think it's 42 chapters now it's abuse a beautiful scripture reed he gives lots of stories there's only two mistakes he believes in the trinity so i found two mistakes in there but amen he said god was not alone because he had two other people to fellowship with oh my but if that's all he misses praise god you know so we're thankful for the revelation of this hour to know that god doesn't have two other people he can talk to amen he's the holy one of israel he said there's none beside me he said i only am the one of israel the holy one of israel so uh but it's a great book if you don't if you don't have a devotional it's a beautiful beautiful book okay it kind of goes through how you know you're called you're god's purpose for your life and then it comes down to like your home church as a chapter on that you know your home church and your gifts it's a really really nice book i think you'd like it if you don't have a devotional or anything purpose you're reading right now it would help you it really helped me um but some of these things as we get started here will be maybe a little review but i think they'll be a blessing to you uh how many people know god's will for your life amen brother branham said it's god's mystery is is i'm sorry god's will is a mystery and every man must search it out for his life you know as my children get older what do they love they love like dramas right uh we do kind of books that have christian themes you know uh and my kids are just all into the fictional stories they like adventures in odyssey the lamplighter theater you know christian good christian stories but why do they love them because there's adventure right there's mystery in church i say like that you know if our kids love so much if they love reading so much about all the mystery and the tension the struggle how much greater uh should we enjoy our lives and finding god's will for our lives in other words if people will flock to movie theaters and spend billions of dollars a year at movie theater for a story an adventure if that's so valuable to the world how much more valuable is it for you to search out your salvation with fear and trembling praise god because that's what you're doing church you're finding god's will for your life it's a mystery and i've said it before we'll get to it again in a little bit but uh brother vang it's from glory to glory you know god's will for your life is from one revelation to the next revelation amen and i showed you that with brother ramsey's ministry he went from one thus saith the lord the first pole to the second pole to the third pole praise god and his almost his entire life was based upon that remember the seven seal he said the thing i've wondered my whole life has now been revealed to me the third pole the seventh seal he wondered why am i attracted to the west he had to go out west to separate himself from his brethren the ones that worshipped him right many of them worshiped him and he had to separate himself to get the the inspiration to go back preach his seals and then come back out he had to separate himself from the people there in jeffersonville and now we can see why right we know a few years after uh jeffersonville kicked out brother neville because they didn't want a preacher they just wanted tapes only and that spirit's still alive today my church don't be discouraged mother graham said the fivefold ministry he said will remain preaching until jesus comes amen amen amen said the highest he said the uh the highest order or office in the world is to be a minister of the gospel a preacher of the gospel we don't magnify ourselves in that but we realize if god said it in that order it's got to remain there and so you can see brother man kept you know looking and searching and and when he found the will of god he rejoiced and and it was a glorious thing to find the will of god hallelujah now i want to just say this you know everybody all the churches if you went to any church today they would say oh we want to know god's will but the reality of it is god's will generally speaking is holiness right so uh pull up case you pull up second timothy 1 9. i just want to go back over a few of these it's been about a year since i've preached on the purpose series if i'm not mistaken i just want to drill this down into my heart i want the holy spirit to ride it upon your heart god's will is holiness generally speaking right it's more than just abstaining from idolatry right like the foolish virgin she will abstain from idols no no she'll have no idols in her life thank god for that uh but the the wise virgin goes a step further and she walks holy to the lord amen hallelujah holy h-o-l-y and holy w-h-o-l-l-y amen holy but also holy to the lord amen i forgot to set my own timer here forgive me everything's still blurry see it's just in and out you know maybe i got one of them backwards maybe that's it ii timothy 1 9 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose amen and grace amen so his great look at this church his grace called us to holiness amen grace his unmerited favor she calls you to be holy now what is holy the greek says sacred physically pure morally blameless amen see god's grace calls you to be morally pure his grace is asking you his grace is pleading with you to live a pure life amen make the right moral choices in other words build your character in christ's pattern praise god amen so nobody can ever say well god hasn't called me to holiness no he has he's called all of us to holiness and that's why there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment god's calling is holiness paul said as we just read it he made known to me the mystery of his will this is his will generally speaking is live a holy life amen see he loves you so much he gave you a purpose and it started before the world began uh ephesians 1 4 acacia still waiting for the blurriness to clear up ephesians 1 4 according as he has chosen us in him yes before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love well jesse how can i live a more moral life follow get back to your first love right because when when you're first saved you have all this love and you'll you throw out everything for jesus because you love him so much amen when i got saved part of my testimony i took down my jennifer lopez pictures i ripped them off the wall i hate to say that but that's just how it was uh kathy ireland some of you probably remember her swimsuit model they're all in the swimsuit i literally when i got home from that athlete's action conference i literally balled them up and threw them in the trash and then i took out my nirvana my snoop dogg and metallica and i put that in the trash literally and i did it because i love i love what god did for me at the conference amen amen what did he do i cast my burdens upon him and he took my sins and he threw him in the sea of forgetfulness see it's love love is what does this the bible says that chosen in love and then he by his grace he calls us to be holy remember there's only four conditions you can be in holy righteous unholy and unrighteous there's only four conditions a heart can be in because four is the number of earth four's an earthly number so there's only four conditions there's only four reactions to the gospel of christ praise god and so uh now we have it established god's purpose is love grace for us to be holy he's called us away from the world it's still blurry so forgive me all right uh now if you pull up first thessalonians 4 7 and 8. i brought my glasses too on purpose because i thought well if they don't work i'm going to get my glasses for second service first thessalonians 4 7 and 8 speaks of holiness and the will of god i love this he said we are not called to uncleanness but unto holiness for god has not called us to unclean this praise god amen amen he didn't cause to be sexually impure he didn't call us to be morally impure he called us to be holy praise god but unto holiness see he therefore that despises him if people despise me for preaching that they're not despising me brother amen they're despising god amen because it's god's the one who called us to this praise the lord amen who have also given to unto us his holy spirit thank the lord amen he's holy he calls us the holiness and he gives us his holy spirit to accomplish it but church whenever god does something we'll be just like peter remember peter he pulled the man the lame man up and the bible said all the people looked at peter like he was something he said he said don't look at me he said what i don't have any power or holiness to do this but brother amen was he filled with the holy ghost yes that means any person who's born again the holy ghost they're holy in god's sight but they don't take credit for it because they didn't pay for it christ paid for it amen amen he was filled with the holy ghost but peter said why what power he said it wasn't my power it wasn't my holiness it was god's holiness oh that's beautiful my it's a paradox sister wendy we are holy we possess holiness we're sealed with holiness but we don't get the credit for it praise god amen amen when god does something great or something wonderful we don't say it wasn't by our holiness it was by jesus oh my god i love the word of god it's so powerful praise god uh did we read eight as well honey okay thank you we did okay so see anyone that despises our church they despise god right just like i read this this week that's why samuel said he said don't upset or god told samuel don't be upset they didn't reject you they rejected me see when a person rejects our church brother bang and they're not rejecting us or mean they're rejecting god is that right and we have to look at it like that when they when they look down on us it's not really us it's the god that lives in us because they don't like the holiness they don't like the the righteousness that that the word of god says but we love it praise god amen we love it we love a holy calling amen we love we we're pressing on towards the higher calling in christ jesus amen eagles can just go higher than chickens right they could they can just go higher
