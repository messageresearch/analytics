[7:26] the bible says arise shine

[7:31] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[7:34] thee
[7:36] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[7:39] earth and gross darkness
[7:42] the people
[7:43] but the lord shall arise upon thee
[7:46] and his glory
[7:48] shall be seen upon thee
[7:51] and the gentiles shall come in thy light
[7:54] and kings to the brightness
[7:57] of thy rising
[7:59] amen let's go to john chapter 1 saint
[8:02] john
[8:03] chapter 1.
[8:13] saint john 1
[8:17] and 1.
[8:19] the bible says in the beginning was the
[8:21] word
[8:22] and the word was with god and the word
[8:25] was god
[8:27] the same was in the beginning with god
[8:30] all things were made by him and without
[8:34] him was not anything made
[8:37] that was was made
[8:39] in him was life
[8:42] and the life was the light of men
[8:45] and
[8:46] the light shineth in darkness
[8:50] and the darkness comprehended it not
[8:54] amen may the lord bless you love his
[8:55] word
[8:56] you can have your seats
[8:58] let's give the lord a handcuff of praise
[9:02] [Applause]
[9:12] if i can by the grace of god i want to
[9:14] use for a subject
[9:16] the light has come
[9:18] the light
[9:20] has come now uh before we get to going i
[9:24] want you to understand
[9:25] this light i'm talking about is not a
[9:27] light bulb
[9:29] you know but this light i'm talking
[9:31] about is a person
[9:33] amen and this person when he began to
[9:36] shine
[9:37] it illuminated the whole world
[9:40] and you know as the scripture says in in
[9:43] and this kind of stands out to me in
[9:46] in verse in chapter 60
[9:48] it says arise isaiah in 61 it says arise
[9:53] shine for the light is come
[9:55] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[9:58] me so if we're walking in the light
[10:01] we're walking in god's glory amen
[10:04] that means that right now if you're
[10:06] standing in the right presence of light
[10:09] you have the right light in your life
[10:11] that the glory of god walks with you
[10:14] daily amen
[10:15] there's no darkness around you there's
[10:18] no dark habits
[10:19] there's no trials in your life that'll
[10:22] produce darkness no there's light there
[10:25] there's light there shining the pathway
[10:27] amen
[10:29] you know let's look at it a little bit
[10:30] deeper by the grace of god amen when i
[10:32] say deeper let's just go with time i'm
[10:34] not a deep preacher amen so that's not
[10:37] what i'm saying but he says for behold
[10:39] the darkness shall cover the earth are
[10:41] we there
[10:43] are we in that time where darkness has
[10:45] covered the earth and if you don't
[10:47] believe me like we said last night we
[10:49] said last night that man's heart and his
[10:53] mind and the imagination of his heart
[10:55] was only evil continually he was so evil
[10:59] that god said he was going to destroy
[11:02] the earth because the whole earth was in
[11:05] gross darkness amen but then god when he
[11:07] first spoke to the earth first thing he
[11:10] said was let there be what light amen
[11:13] hallelujah so god's first words to the
[11:16] earth was let me shine
[11:19] hallelujah hallelujah because god is
[11:23] that light amen now the bible says for
[11:25] behold the darkness shall cover the
[11:27] earth we're here church we're in we're
[11:30] in a time where this scripture is being
[11:33] a reality amen this scripture is being
[11:36] manifest right before our eyes you say
[11:39] brother jesus what you talking about my
[11:40] gross darkness gross darkness upon the
[11:43] earth because what should be wrong is
[11:46] considered to be right
[11:47] and what's right is considered to be
[11:49] wrong you could never tell me when i was
[11:52] a young man that now they tell me it's
[11:55] all right to smoke marijuana in public
[12:00] we're in that day
[12:02] well wrong is right and right it's wrong
[12:06] now they say it's okay to be uh
[12:09] something you're not it's okay to be a
[12:11] homosexual it's okay to be a lesbian
[12:14] ghost darkness has covered the earth
[12:17] church if you go to the beach by god's
[12:20] grace you'll see a woman out there in a
[12:23] bikini
[12:25] right
[12:26] because seems to be all right
[12:28] but if i
[12:30] if somebody breaks into a house and
[12:32] she's cutting her underwear she'll say
[12:36] no same thing she has on then it's the
[12:38] same thing she wears at the beach
[12:42] gross darkness has covered the earth
[12:45] and men's and women's minds they can't
[12:48] even see that they're in a time where
[12:50] they're living in darkness
[12:52] but we need light
[12:55] but the light has come amen
[12:58] he says for behold the darkness shall
[13:00] cover the earth and gross darkness gross
[13:03] darkness means a whole lot
[13:05] amen
[13:06] growth darkness the people amen but the
[13:09] lord shall rise upon thee and his glory
[13:12] shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles
[13:16] shall come to the light
[13:18] hallelujah so what god has done in the
[13:22] midst of all his darkness he's seen
[13:24] something that will shine in our life
[13:27] what did he do he sent the word
[13:33] hallelujah
[13:34] he sent a word that was shining our
[13:37] souls where we wouldn't get caught up or
[13:39] we wouldn't remain in darkness now the
[13:42] bible said in the people gross darkness
[13:45] so god had a sin a word hallelujah that
[13:48] would be greater than the darkness upon
[13:50] the face of the earth
[13:54] and we said in simple terms god sent the
[13:57] message hallelujah
[13:59] god sent the man with a message
[14:00] hallelujah that came from the origins
[14:04] and the in the secret places of god's
[14:06] mind hallelujah that will show us how to
[14:09] live that will show us what it takes to
[14:12] get to heaven hallelujah and through
[14:14] this message god continues to rest his
[14:17] glory upon us amen
[14:19] because it says arise and shine the
[14:21] light has come and the glory of the lord
[14:23] is upon thee amen so if you are sitting
[14:26] in what we call the message of the hour
[14:29] you are sitting in the glory of god
[14:37] but you must receive the light
[14:42] let's look at life for a second if we
[14:44] sit in this room close all the blinds
[14:47] cut all the lights out we'll be sitting
[14:49] in darkness amen
[14:51] but when we hit the switch hallelujah
[14:53] darkness scatters amen
[14:56] so what i'm saying to you tonight if you
[14:58] have the right kind of light darkness
[15:01] will never overtake you
[15:03] it's not powerful enough amen you can
[15:06] take the darkest day on the face of the
[15:09] earth and walk out there with a
[15:11] flashlight and it'll always push through
[15:14] hallelujah
[15:16] it will always push through he'll push
[15:18] through in the strongest hurricane all
[15:21] you got to do is have the right kind of
[15:24] batteries cut it off and the light will
[15:26] begin to shine
[15:28] hallelujah it could be
[15:30] destruction everywhere but if you got
[15:32] the right kind of light it'll show you
[15:34] where to go it'll show you what to step
[15:37] over hallelujah you're gonna be
[15:45] what does life do
[15:48] light
[15:49] it uncovers amen
[15:51] hallelujah
[15:52] because you can go in your house
[15:54] you know you just take for for
[15:56] for um
[15:58] spring
[16:00] most of your sister spring time you say
[16:02] okay that's the time to clean up that's
[16:04] the time to get the house right time for
[16:05] spring cleaning and what do you do you
[16:08] go through the house sweeping you go
[16:09] through the house cleaning doing all
[16:11] these things but what about those areas
[16:13] of the house that are dark
[16:16] hey man what do you do you open the
[16:18] blinds you open the curtains let the
[16:20] light come through so you can see what
[16:22] needs to be distracted from the house
[16:24] hallelujah it might be sitting in a dark
[16:27] room been there getting got molded and
[16:30] got a smell on it but once you cut the
[16:32] light on shine it you get rid of it
[16:34] because you don't need it anymore amen
[16:37] and that's what the word of god has done
[16:39] in our life god has shined
[16:42] god has taken the mildew out god has
[16:45] taken the old stuff that we've been
[16:47] holding on for so long and gotten rid of
[16:50] it by his life
[16:56] light uncovers things that have been
[16:59] laying there in secret
[17:03] that's what the word of god does god has
[17:06] come and given us a word and he's shed
[17:08] light hallelujah on the places of the
[17:11] scriptures that we didn't know anything
[17:13] about
[17:14] it was always there but the light came
[17:18] hallelujah so you can see what you see
[17:25] light brings forth of an understanding
[17:28] amen now i'm from
[17:30] carolina took me about nine hours to get
[17:33] up here
[17:35] now just say for instance
[17:37] when i get ready to go back home
[17:40] i take highway 77
[17:42] straight back
[17:44] no i don't have to jump on 40 i don't
[17:47] have to jump on 26. 77 all the way there
[17:51] i got that bar
[17:53] i i i know i got to go through a search
[17:55] got to go through petersburg and and
[17:58] charleston west virginia and all these
[17:59] things you know go through charlotte and
[18:01] all that and i'm almost there
[18:03] so many miles i mean i know the way back
[18:06] but you know what hallelujah sister
[18:08] smith that will be a hard journey back
[18:11] with no light
[18:13] [Music]
[18:15] if i decide at the service tonight i'm
[18:17] driving back home it's going to be dark
[18:19] hallelujah no matter how much i think i
[18:21] know the way hallelujah that ride will
[18:24] be a very dangerous ride without any
[18:27] headlights
[18:29] so i need harley like hallelujah to show
[18:32] me where i'm going amen i might know
[18:35] intellectually uh
[18:39] i might know intellectually where i'm
[18:41] going but without the light i'll never
[18:44] get there safely
[18:46] hallelujah
[18:48] and we can ask people intellectually
[18:50] where you want to go heaven and hell
[18:52] everybody says heaven
[18:55] that's an intellectual saying
[18:57] intellectual thought nobody wants to go
[18:59] to hell hallelujah but let me explain
[19:01] something without the correct light you
[19:03] won't get there
[19:04] [Music]
[19:09] hallelujah because hell also projects a
[19:12] false light
[19:17] so we need light
[19:19] light shows that you're going the right
[19:21] way
[19:22] and you know coming and going hallelujah
[19:24] there are certain things there's there's
[19:27] certain landmarks there that the light
[19:29] shows me you're going the right way
[19:31] holly light is a knowledge of things
[19:35] amen
[19:36] and what god has done when he's come and
[19:38] opened up this bible through a messenger
[19:41] he's given us things that other
[19:43] generations didn't have
[19:45] hallelujah we have an understanding of
[19:48] what it means to walk by faith we have
[19:50] an understanding of what it means to
[19:52] have godly love
[19:54] hollywood godly peace amen hallelujah
[19:58] we're living in a day where the light in
[20:00] the glory of god is resting on us
[20:06] but why light why did god say let there
[20:08] be light amen let's go back to the
[20:10] beginning god created the heavens and
[20:12] the earth and all these things you know
[20:14] it was dark but then god said let there
[20:16] be light why because he knew when he
[20:19] created the earth that there was
[20:21] mysteries already laying there in the
[20:22] earth
[20:24] and the only thing that could bring it
[20:25] forth is the contact with the light
[20:28] amen
[20:30] amen
[20:31] church there's two things that you need
[20:35] to make it out of here
[20:38] two things you need to make it out here
[20:40] one thing uh let's take a let's take a
[20:42] seed
[20:43] there's two things that seed needs
[20:45] honey of course we know it has to be
[20:47] germatized
[20:48] but it can be germatized all at once i
[20:51] can take that seed place it up here on
[20:53] the pulpit an apple seed honey sweet
[20:56] apples
[20:57] red sweet apples i can have that seed
[21:00] place it here on the pulpit know that it
[21:02] comes from red sweet apples
[21:05] but it'll never be able to produce
[21:07] sitting up here
[21:09] you say brother it's in church is it a
[21:11] holy ghost atmosphere no it needs more
[21:19] it's a true apple seed but just bring it
[21:22] in the church ain't good enough
[21:24] there's some more things that it needs
[21:26] for that life to come forth hallelujah
[21:29] so one thing that it needs you just
[21:31] can't believe it
[21:32] you can't believe it but you know what
[21:34] every seed needs it needs some matter
[21:37] some form of dirt
[21:41] [Laughter]
[21:45] everybody in here got some dirt in their
[21:47] life hallelujah everybody here at one
[21:49] point or another you were covered in
[21:52] dirt hallelujah
[21:54] hey man you baby you have bad habits bad
[21:57] thoughts bad situations but you at one
[21:59] point were covered in dirt
[22:02] but let's get it right hallelujah we
[22:05] hungry the people of god we are good
[22:08] dirt
[22:12] hallelujah
[22:13] because don't you know a real seed it
[22:16] doesn't grow in any kind of dirt
[22:19] hallelujah it has to be good dirt
[22:21] hallelujah you don't you don't know you
[22:23] don't develop an apple orchard in clay
[22:28] honey but no it has to be dirt hernia
[22:31] that can give something back to the seed
[22:34] holy that's why you have trials and
[22:36] tribulations that's why you make
[22:38] mistakes and all these things because
[22:40] that dirt is there hurry up to pull
[22:43] things off of you
[22:50] so we all need some dirt
[22:53] but say it with me i'm
[22:55] good dirt
[22:58] honey
[22:59] and you know that when you die what
[23:00] happens to your body it goes back to the
[23:03] dust it goes back to the dirt amen but
[23:05] you know what church god allows certain
[23:08] failures and certain things to happen in
[23:11] our life hallelujah why because that's
[23:13] what you call cultivating the seed
[23:16] [Music]
[23:19] god allows certain things to happen so
[23:21] he could show how strong he is so he can
[23:23] show that he's stronger in the dirt
[23:29] now you keep in mind hallelujah you in a
[23:32] farmer's farming you don't know what
[23:34] he's planted unless he told you
[23:36] hulia is there below the dirt hallelujah
[23:40] but the dirt's not strong enough to
[23:42] change the life inside
[23:48] hallelujah all right
[23:51] no matter how deep it's buried
[23:53] hallelujah the surroundings of the dirt
[23:56] is not strong enough to change the life
[23:58] inside
[24:00] and no matter what you may have done no
[24:02] matter where you might come from if you
[24:04] got the seed of god your failures have
[24:06] never changed that
[24:10] hallelujah
[24:12] your mistakes will never change that
[24:14] because if god gave you the life he
[24:17] can't take the life back
[24:24] so we need some dirt
[24:26] but good dirt
[24:28] but you know what else that's he what
[24:29] happens why it's buried in dirt that
[24:32] dirt smothers it
[24:35] that dirt compacts it that dirt gathers
[24:37] it that dirt hardly suffocates it amen
[24:40] and what does it do it forces her
[24:43] the shell to let go of his insides
[24:49] hallelujah did y'all realize that when
[24:52] you bury that seed the life is not
[24:55] coming from the shell
[24:57] the life is coming from what's inside
[24:59] earlier
[25:00] but it takes dirt hallelujah to dry that
[25:03] shell out so he could break away and the
[25:06] life can begin to come forward
[25:09] but the only way listen church even in
[25:11] that moment holy that seed is not having
[25:14] contact with the light yet
[25:18] it's the dirt and the filth in his life
[25:20] here that's bringing it to another stage
[25:23] and i don't know about you but i got
[25:25] tired of living in sin
[25:30] i didn't even know who god was i didn't
[25:33] even know who a prophet was hallelujah
[25:35] but all i know is i got tired of the
[25:37] dirt
[25:43] and then god through his word start
[25:45] dealing with me
[25:48] amen and as god dealt with me the dirt
[25:51] hallelujah amen suffocated the shell and
[25:54] the shell began to break free hallelujah
[25:57] then the real me
[25:59] then the real you
[26:01] it began to come forward hallelujah and
[26:04] now it's just there's two things
[26:06] remember i said one was dirt hallelujah
[26:08] what was the other one light
[26:11] hallelujah even though that seed is
[26:14] covered by dirt it can still feel the
[26:16] warmth of the sun
[26:20] hallelujah he can still feel the
[26:22] presence of the light
[26:24] hollywood he can be covered and
[26:26] smothered in dirt but when his time
[26:29] comes it feels the warmth of another
[26:31] atmosphere hallelujah
[26:33] hey man and then it starts to feel some
[26:36] kind of a pool here that brings it out
[26:40] of the dirt
[26:41] and that's what the light of the world
[26:43] has done for you and i it pulled us out
[26:46] of the dirt it pulled us out of the
[26:47] nomination it pulled us out of the world
[26:57] and once
[26:59] that seed got above the dirt there was
[27:02] no going back
[27:07] listen
[27:09] listen the way a seed connects with the
[27:11] pool of the light
[27:13] it never says this is too much i'm going
[27:15] back down
[27:20] he never does that
[27:22] but the pool of the light
[27:24] is bringing out new stages in his life
[27:27] that has never experienced before
[27:32] so it was a seed then it turns into a
[27:34] plant
[27:36] and from a plant to a tree
[27:38] and trees puts out branches and then it
[27:40] begins to bear fruit
[27:42] and then the fruit did the same seed
[27:44] that originally was planted hallelujah
[27:47] oh that started with two connections
[27:50] dirt and light
[27:53] but the greatest of the two is light
[27:55] hallelujah because once you come above
[27:58] above the dirt light deals with you for
[28:00] the rest of your life
[28:04] in every season that tree bathing in the
[28:07] light brings forth fruit holiday year
[28:10] after year bring forth fruit year of the
[28:12] year bring forth fruit
[28:14] so once it gets in the presence of the
[28:16] light it experiences unlimited power
[28:27] remember
[28:29] brother branham said when that tree
[28:31] is this size
[28:33] every bushel that it will ever bear is
[28:35] already in it
[28:36] that's right
[28:40] think about that
[28:42] every bushel when that tree is just big
[28:44] this is you i like peaches
[28:46] you take a peach tree and get that bee
[28:48] holly
[28:49] every bushel of peaches is in it right
[28:51] then
[28:54] so i say to you when you come to god and
[28:56] you rededicate your life well you get
[28:59] the holy ghost holy every blessing is in
[29:01] you right now
[29:04] every victory is in you right now
[29:08] every promise is in you right now every
[29:12] connection every relationship everything
[29:14] you ever need is in you right now hell
[29:16] yeah i'm looking for a testimony because
[29:19] it's already in me
[29:28] there's just a certain time of season
[29:30] where it comes forward
[29:32] hallelujah
[29:35] amen
[29:36] the church
[29:38] listen
[29:39] one thing that i understand i ain't
[29:41] gonna be long y'all know about the
[29:42] clothes
[29:47] one thing you must understand
[29:50] the bible says
[29:52] in saint john
[29:54] it says in saint john like where we just
[29:56] read
[29:57] saint john the first chapter it says
[30:00] verse 5 it says and the light shineth in
[30:02] darkness
[30:03] and the darkness comprehended it not
[30:08] see
[30:09] people in denomination they can't
[30:11] understand why we live the way we live
[30:14] some of your unsaved family members
[30:16] can't understand why you live the way
[30:18] you live why you dress the way you dress
[30:21] why you do what you do they you know why
[30:24] it's because they don't understand the
[30:26] glory of god
[30:30] they're looking at the glory of god and
[30:33] they got a problem with it but but the
[30:36] scripture clearly says holy that the
[30:38] light shineth in darkness and darkness
[30:40] comprehended it not they don't
[30:42] understand why god will use a man
[30:45] hallelujah with a sixth grade education
[30:47] hallelujah why god hallelujah we used to
[30:50] use men in the bible like peter james
[30:52] and john they said peter couldn't even
[30:54] spell his name
[30:57] hallelujah but he was walking in so much
[31:00] light god said hey he got the keys to
[31:02] the kingdom
[31:04] [Applause]
[31:09] oh my and think about the church god is
[31:12] is all knowing holy when you step into
[31:14] this lightness glory hey man it's
[31:17] mind-boggling to the to the to the to
[31:19] the normal individual amen you think
[31:22] about it they thought they had an
[31:24] accusation against peter he denied the
[31:26] lord lord told me he was going to deny
[31:28] him denied him three times on the third
[31:30] time he was cussing but he still was in
[31:32] the light
[31:39] because jesus had already told him that
[31:41] the devil desires to sift you as weak
[31:43] but i have prayed for you hallelujah so
[31:46] before he got into anything
[31:49] that thing that he had to fight had to
[31:51] get through jesus prayers first
[31:55] so if you go through anything let's
[31:58] realize this god has to allow it because
[32:01] he's praying for you
[32:06] and you tell me what is it who is it
[32:09] that's struggling
[32:11] [Applause]
[32:14] foreign to give to you for it to give to
[32:17] you before i get to me god has to give
[32:19] him permission hallelujah because
[32:21] there's nothing stronger than his
[32:23] prayers
[32:26] remember jesus said i know the lord hear
[32:29] me always
[32:35] but he looked like he was walking in
[32:37] darkness when the man he cursed he swore
[32:39] he denied the lord and everything he
[32:42] looked at jesus looked like he was
[32:43] walking away hallelujah but even in that
[32:46] moment god didn't come back and say give
[32:48] me my keys back
[32:51] god knows hallelujah what you're going
[32:54] to do how you're going to do it and when
[32:56] you're going to do it
[32:59] that's how powerful this light is
[33:02] it shines in the midst of darkness
[33:06] in darkness
[33:07] comprehended it not
[33:10] they look at us all the time and they
[33:12] say you don't deserve it that's because
[33:14] darkness comprehended it not it ain't
[33:17] whether i deserve it or not is that
[33:19] we're elected to it
[33:22] hallelujah
[33:23] we've been elected we've been
[33:25] predestinated
[33:28] none of us deserve it hallelujah but
[33:30] we've been elected
[33:34] we've been chosen
[33:36] hallelujah hey man i love that pawn
[33:39] because you take a a a
[33:41] a prophet who had to stand before
[33:44] hundreds of men hallelujah who had uh
[33:47] lld's and cds and all these things and
[33:50] all these big degrees and they couldn't
[33:52] hold a table next to him
[33:55] why because he had true light
[33:59] see one thing about a prophet and i'm
[34:00] sure you notice whatever he gets he gets
[34:03] straight from god
[34:05] there's no mediator
[34:09] [Applause]
[34:11] so the light that was shining in our
[34:13] prophet's life it came straight from god
[34:16] so i want to say to you when you
[34:18] listening to the prophet the prophet is
[34:20] not your mediator
[34:23] amen
[34:24] you're getting the same treatment he got
[34:26] amen hallelujah amen we don't have to
[34:29] pray through a prophet so god can hear
[34:31] us no we go straight to god why because
[34:34] we're walking in the same light
[34:40] that's where people have made their
[34:42] mistake when i say darkness comprehended
[34:44] it not they say oh you're following a
[34:46] man and brother branham did this and
[34:48] brother branham did that we're not
[34:50] following brother branham we're
[34:51] following the lights
[34:58] we're walking in the light as he is in
[35:00] the light hallelujah and we have
[35:02] fellowship with christ
[35:04] [Music]
[35:10] one thing the white the light does it
[35:12] reveals
[35:14] it
[35:14] uncovers it gives direction amen that's
[35:18] what the light does and that's what this
[35:20] word i hope you understand what i'm
[35:22] saying when i say light i'm talking
[35:24] about the revelation of the word
[35:28] i'm not talking about led or whatever
[35:30] you call it
[35:31] hell yeah
[35:32] but just to just just to make it clear
[35:34] hallelujah you'd never get that light
[35:37] unless you got one instrument hello
[35:40] you got you need two instruments but you
[35:43] got to have a positive amen
[35:45] but you know what that light will never
[35:46] shine without a negative
[35:51] you need a negative hallelujah to see
[35:54] the expression of the positive amen
[35:56] just like driving your car your car
[35:58] would never crank without a negative
[36:00] ground
[36:04] you have the right gas the right spot
[36:06] plugs all the horsepower but without
[36:09] that negative ground it won't go nowhere
[36:14] and the sad part about it now they're
[36:15] making electric cars
[36:20] so everything about it all of you
[36:21] projects you need a negative and a
[36:22] positive in order for you to get good
[36:24] results amen and that's what god has
[36:27] allowed amen and what like i said in the
[36:29] beginning when he created the earth and
[36:31] the world and so forth god knew that
[36:34] there were mysteries laying there
[36:36] hallelujah laying there in the earth so
[36:38] he had to shine the light to pull out
[36:41] those mysteries hallelujah but what he
[36:43] did to get that light to shine he took
[36:45] each seed through a progress amen
[36:48] he took he took joseph hallelujah
[36:50] through a progress and it seemed like
[36:52] everything was negative but the light
[36:54] was always shining
[37:00] because in the time where it looked like
[37:01] everything was was negative he was still
[37:04] gaining ground amen oh
[37:09] listen church what you got to understand
[37:11] is every negative experience got him
[37:14] closer to his destiny
[37:20] look he had the fighting i'm talking
[37:21] about walking in light first he had to
[37:23] have a relationship with god amen he had
[37:26] dreams and god was giving him dreams and
[37:27] things and he go back and tell his
[37:29] brothers and told his mama so y'all told
[37:31] his dad say everybody you're gonna bow
[37:33] down to me
[37:34] they look at him man you crazy see
[37:37] darkness company that not
[37:42] they couldn't understand what he was
[37:43] talking about
[37:44] but then church hallelujah look at god
[37:47] we are not the question god sometimes
[37:50] what we got to do we just got to go with
[37:52] it
[37:54] you just got to go with it let me tell
[37:55] you how the person lord i don't know
[37:57] what you're doing but i surrender all
[38:00] right
[38:02] joseph joseph had to do that amen hey
[38:05] man he used his family hallelujah to get
[38:08] all these things going he used his
[38:10] father first hey man use his father
[38:12] first hallelujah to get the light to
[38:14] move in amen and darkness comprehended
[38:16] it not hallelujah you know he said that
[38:19] he had all those boys 11 boys say but he
[38:22] loved joseph the most
[38:24] holy
[38:24] and his brothers can feel that amen and
[38:27] they got really real jealous of him and
[38:29] then one day hallelujah he blew all
[38:32] these stacks on
[38:33] blew their minds they were so mad at
[38:35] this they just couldn't believe it one
[38:37] day hallelujah he gave joseph a coat a
[38:39] covenant coat hallelujah gave it to him
[38:42] in front of his brother and joseph put
[38:43] that coat on and you know what he did
[38:45] brother he spitting around that coat
[38:47] like he ric flair
[38:48] [Music]
[38:54] and his brothers looked at and said oh
[38:56] boy i i used to be jealous of you but i
[38:59] hate you now
[39:03] but you know what he was doing he was
[39:04] walking in the light
[39:08] darkness
[39:09] comprehended it not
[39:11] what was happening right there the glory
[39:13] of god was in that house
[39:16] hollywood because god knew hey his
[39:19] brothers had to go from jealousy to
[39:22] hatred to where they would sell him to
[39:24] slavery because the caravan was on the
[39:27] way
[39:28] [Music]
[39:37] but every negative experience got him
[39:40] closer to his destiny
[39:44] but you know what you we ought to
[39:46] rejoice
[39:47] if you're going through things that
[39:49] means there's you you're taking steps
[39:51] closer to your destiny

[40:02] fight that did he get into potiphar's
[40:04] house hallelujah now he has to fight

[40:10] lust and he has to fight a lion demon

[40:50] besides my lord won't let me do it
[40:57] see you continue in the light
[41:00] hallelujah
[41:02] even though hallelujah
[41:04] even though he was sold into slavery he
[41:06] kept his convictions of what was
[41:08] revealed to him
[41:11] hallelujah he continued to walk in the
[41:14] light and part of his wife is probably
[41:16] saying i can't understand you man if
[41:19] this was somebody else he would have
[41:20] been seized the opportunity
[41:23] but joseph walking in the light
[41:25] hallelujah he had to come through a lush
[41:27] demon then she comes and she lies on him
[41:29] and say look you brought this man in the
[41:30] house look what happened and she was
[41:32] lying now joseph goes into jail
[41:35] hallelujah but in the jailhouse his gift
[41:38] was still working he was still walking
[41:40] in the lights
[41:51] look
[41:52] he said rise shine the light has come
[41:54] from the glory of god is upon me
[41:56] look
[41:57] even though he was going through all
[41:58] that
[42:00] all the people around him could see that
[42:02] there was something different about it
[42:07] he's in jail and they're taking note of
[42:10] him that's right
[42:11] he's running the jailhouse
[42:15] oh my
[42:16] church should have played the buck the
[42:18] butler
[42:19] and the baker come down they have a
[42:21] dream
[42:22] and joseph begins to interpret their
[42:24] dreams in jail holly still walking in
[42:28] the
[42:30] but you know what happened to people
[42:31] different things happen in their life
[42:33] and they get discouraged
[42:34] they wanna i can't understand this why
[42:36] would people getting scared discouraged
[42:38] the first thing they do they say i'm
[42:40] leaving church
[42:42] i don't understand that
[42:44] church is the first place you should be
[42:46] trying to go because you can hear the
[42:47] word and be encouraged
[42:49] but if you stay home hallelujah if you
[42:52] stay home you're going to get weaker and
[42:54] weaker and weaker amen but if you come
[42:56] to church hallelujah you open yourself
[42:58] set up to be encouraged by the word of
[43:01] god
[43:03] amen
[43:04] but the first thing people do is when
[43:05] they have questions they go talk to
[43:07] somebody worldly or some unbeliever and
[43:09] the first thing they're going to do is
[43:10] give them some negative advice
[43:15] fellowship in the light hollywood amen
[43:18] and now you look at joseph joseph to the
[43:20] place
[43:20] hallelujah he didn't dream for two
[43:22] people harley butler he interpreted
[43:24] butler's dream in the baker's dream and
[43:27] he tells both of them verbatim what was
[43:29] going to happen and it happens why
[43:31] because the glory of god was upon him
[43:34] amen hallelujah
[43:36] he had hallelujah heard straight from
[43:38] god amen and now he tells them what
[43:41] happens one dies the other one's just
[43:43] restored and joseph tells them verbatim
[43:46] he says hey
[43:47] don't forget me down here
[43:51] so now the next thing he has to fight is
[43:53] being forgotten
[43:56] and you know when people feel like
[43:58] they're forgotten they get depressed
[44:01] and now all these spirits are coming
[44:03] towards joseph but he's getting stronger
[44:05] hallelujah even though he's been
[44:07] forgotten holly the butler's been
[44:09] restored and he's doing his job and
[44:11] everything is good but joseph know he
[44:13] wouldn't be there he wouldn't interpret
[44:15] his dream right hallelujah but now
[44:18] joseph has to be to a place where he can
[44:20] be treated wrong and still walk in the
[44:22] light
[44:23] holly but then his day came hallelujah
[44:26] where pharaoh had a dream
[44:28] hallelujah
[44:30] dream of all dreams
[44:32] biggest dream in the kingdom hallelujah
[44:35] hallelujah and the servant said i
[44:37] remember my mistake hallelujah there's a
[44:39] man hallelujah in the jailhouse who's
[44:42] walking in the light
[44:46] hallelujah and he can tell you exactly
[44:49] what your dream is because he did it to
[44:52] me hallelujah so now pharaoh comes down
[44:54] remember all the stuff he had to go
[44:56] through he had to fight jealousy hatred
[44:59] lust hallelujah lying how do you fight
[45:02] being
[45:03] depressed and forgotten and now he's to
[45:06] the stage hallelujah where pharaoh's
[45:08] coming to talk to him
[45:10] why because he stayed in the light
[45:14] in our church what i want to show you is
[45:15] by the grace of god he interprets his
[45:18] dream
[45:19] hollywood shows pharaoh tells pharaoh
[45:21] exactly what god's going to do now
[45:23] pharaoh says hey hey man hey there's so
[45:26] much light in your life i need you to
[45:28] run the kingdom
[45:35] see if you let the light shine your
[45:38] light will be a witness to unbelievers
[45:41] and unbelievable want to fellowship with
[45:43] you as you walk in the light
[45:49] pharaoh puts him to a place where he's
[45:52] running the whole kingdom now what i
[45:54] want you to understand because joseph
[45:56] walked in the light and the glory of god
[45:58] was resting upon him everybody that ever
[46:01] did him wrong was now in his hands
[46:06] wow
[46:06] his brothers
[46:08] potiphar his wife the caravan
[46:12] the the the the warden in the jailhouse
[46:17] everybody
[46:18] was in his hands now
[46:23] let me say let me share something with
[46:25] you god will never expose you to true
[46:27] light
[46:29] if you will not develop the character
[46:33] and that's what the light is all about
[46:36] god developing your character
[46:38] because that light pulls out the mystery
[46:41] of the seed
[46:42] hallelujah
[46:44] if you plant that seed in the dirt
[46:45] nobody knows what it is but as it makes
[46:48] contact with the light the revealing and
[46:50] the mystery of what it is it unfolds in
[46:52] the presence of the light
[46:56] and that's what the lord
[46:58] has been doing all this time hallelujah
[47:01] of course they know who the husband is
[47:03] but nobody knows who the bride is
[47:08] but she's revealed as she walks in the
[47:11] light
[47:20] so you can look right next to the person
[47:22] beside you you don't know if they ride
[47:23] or not
[47:25] but the only way you know hardly who
[47:27] they really are by how they walk in the
[47:29] light
[47:34] listen
[47:35] far close let's go to saint john the
[47:37] fourth chapter
[47:40] we'll show you how powerful the light is
[47:44] st john four
[47:49] oh
[47:50] my you know it's very important to be in
[47:53] a
[47:54] in a church that's preaching the word of
[47:56] god
[47:58] when you're walking in the true light me
[47:59] and a friend of mine was talking i was
[48:01] on the way up and
[48:03] my desire you know um
[48:04] my i'll tell you what my unsupported
[48:06] request is
[48:08] i'm praying about moving
[48:10] you know i'm looking for a house and
[48:11] different things like that
[48:13] you know and it definitely has to be a
[48:15] move of god
[48:17] because every move i've ever made
[48:18] concerning that area
[48:20] god had to open the door for me
[48:22] so i just pray about it and and allow
[48:25] the lord to work his thing hallelujah
[48:27] hey man but you know me and a friend of
[48:29] mine was talking he want me to move
[48:31] where he
[48:34] got a good church and all that stuff and
[48:35] this and that and i was out thinking
[48:37] about i say bro that's fine i said but
[48:40] what i want is to be in the will of god
[48:43] amen
[48:44] i don't want to be in a church just
[48:46] because my friend is dead
[48:48] or my family is dead holy i can move
[48:51] somewhere i can move somewhere uh
[48:53] because i got a good job it's a nice
[48:55] area and have no fellowship with god
[49:01] somebody asked me one time i was doing a
[49:03] time share it was like well what about
[49:05] this place has they been there
[49:07] what about this place been there
[49:10] what about that place been there
[49:13] and she's asking me you said what would
[49:14] you what one place would you that you
[49:16] haven't been would you like to go i said
[49:18] hawaii
[49:19] she said why have you been there yet i
[49:20] haven't got a church invitation
[49:28] hallelujah so before you make any
[49:30] decision think about your spirituality
[49:32] first
[49:34] hollywood whatever you got to do holly
[49:36] don't go somewhere where you separate
[49:38] yourself from god every other area in
[49:40] your life is good but the god area is
[49:43] suffering
[49:45] i've seen it happen church i've seen
[49:48] people make decisions based upon living
[49:50] down here in this world
[49:52] no when we live down here we want to
[49:54] live for god
[49:58] hey man you remember there was a there
[50:00] was a there was a uh
[50:02] a man who the lord was telling him and
[50:04] this is a white man he said he said if
[50:06] the law would tell him to move to africa
[50:08] and the man was like man you crazy one
[50:09] of his friends like man you crazy gonna
[50:11] move to africa you got young daughters
[50:13] he said look brother he said if it's the
[50:15] will of god for me to move to africa
[50:17] africa is the safest place for my family
[50:26] what we want is to stay in the light
[50:33] i ain't moving arizona just because
[50:35] brother branham had a lot of
[50:36] supernatural events out there
[50:39] no
[50:41] amen i'll go as he leads
[50:46] [Applause]
[50:50] listen saint john chapter four
[50:58] and we know this is the story of the
[51:00] woman at the well
[51:01] and jesus said he must needs go by
[51:03] samaria but let's look at this look at
[51:05] the story
[51:07] and look at how hello
[51:08] god already knew what kind of seed she
[51:11] had inside
[51:13] but she had to make contact with the
[51:15] light
[51:19] hallelujah not a mirage but the real
[51:22] light because in that day you had
[51:25] sadducees and pharisees hallelujah but
[51:27] they weren't good enough to unlock the
[51:29] mystery of her life
[51:31] hallelujah
[51:32] what they did they made her feel like an
[51:35] outcast they separated her but when the
[51:38] true light came he unlocked the mystery
[51:40] of a life
[51:45] that's what the true word of god will do
[51:47] it'll unlock the mystery of who you are
[51:55] coming to this time you had sadducees
[51:57] pharisees very powerful uh religious men
[52:01] hallelujah but they couldn't turn out
[52:03] who she really was
[52:05] to them she was just an ill-fated woman
[52:08] a prostitute
[52:09] woman he said look now let's look at the
[52:11] conversation
[52:12] uh
[52:13] let's start at verse seven
[52:18] well i'm just reading let's go to verse
[52:20] four say and he must needs go through
[52:22] samaria then come as he to the city of
[52:25] samaria which is called psycho near to
[52:29] the parcel of ground that jacob gave to
[52:31] his sons his son joseph verse six now
[52:34] jacob's well was was there jesus
[52:37] therefore being weary with his journey
[52:41] set thus
[52:42] on the well as it was about the sixth
[52:45] hour now look at this church this is the
[52:48] lord jesus christ
[52:49] we're always thinking about what can the
[52:52] lord do for me what can the lord do for
[52:54] me but let me tell you something there
[52:56] are times where god wants you to do
[52:58] something for him
[53:01] and the way he's going to start this
[53:02] conversation not by him doing something
[53:05] for her but her doing something for him
[53:14] hallelujah you know sometimes before you
[53:16] get down and ask god about what you need
[53:19] maybe you have to say well lord before i
[53:21] do this i know you need some praise
[53:28] before i express my need lord i know
[53:31] your name needs to be lifted up so i'm
[53:33] gonna get down here on my knees and i'm
[53:36] gonna worship you i'm gonna give you
[53:38] praise and honor and glory i'm gonna
[53:40] lift your name on i because you're a
[53:43] great god you're a wonderful god you're
[53:45] a mighty god
[53:51] before you get down there oh lord i need
[53:53] to oh lord oh lord the devil do oh lord
[53:57] the devil sometimes we talk more about
[53:59] the devil in our prayers than we do god
[54:04] you know god probably sitting there
[54:05] doing this
[54:15] because all you do is talking about the
[54:16] devil
[54:19] you know your trials and tribulations
[54:21] are for your good
[54:31] look
[54:32] let's read
[54:33] well i'm at verse six
[54:35] verse seven
[54:36] there comes a woman of samaria to draw
[54:39] water jesus says unto her give me to
[54:42] drink
[54:43] holly
[54:44] whoa but see in her mind she got a
[54:47] reason and spirit she looking at his
[54:48] color looking at her color and say of
[54:50] customs me and you ain't supposed to be
[54:52] having no dealing she didn't realize she
[54:54] tried he trying to give her some water
[54:56] where she never thirst again
[54:58] he's trying to bring her he's trying to
[55:00] bring her to the light hallelujah but
[55:02] she'll never be in darkness again
[55:11] he's as far as disciples were going away
[55:13] until the city to buy meat then said the
[55:15] woman of samaria unto him how is it how
[55:18] is it that thou being a jew asking drink
[55:21] of meat which was a woman of samaria for
[55:23] the jews have no dealings with the smear
[55:25] see
[55:26] jesus is oh he's not always politically
[55:29] correct
[55:30] he will do the complete opposite of what
[55:33] you're thinking
[55:34] hollywood because he wants you to
[55:36] understand when you get to this level
[55:38] you're trying to get to it wasn't on
[55:40] your own merits
[55:42] it was strictly by the grace of god
[55:49] hallelujah
[55:51] then jesus asked to say to her if thou
[55:53] knewest the gift of god and who it is
[55:55] that saved the deed give me to drink
[55:58] thou wouldn't have asked of him and
[56:00] would have given thee living water the
[56:02] woman said unto him sir thou has nothing
[56:04] to draw with see the visitation was
[56:07] already supernatural
[56:10] he said give me a drinking ain't got
[56:12] nothing to draw with hallelujah
[56:13] sometimes jesus will ask you of things
[56:16] that you know you're naturally not
[56:18] capable of that means he's trying to
[56:20] step you into the supernatural
[56:25] hallelujah when you get in situations
[56:27] and it's a tight situation you don't
[56:29] know how and the scripture comes to your
[56:32] mind god wants you to operate in that
[56:34] scripture
[56:38] hallelujah
[56:40] she worrying about what he got to draw
[56:42] with
[56:44] oh my
[56:45] verse 12
[56:48] are thou greater than our father jacob
[56:51] which gave us as well and drink thereof
[56:53] himself and his children and his his
[56:55] cattle jesus jesus answered and said
[56:58] unto her whosoever drinking of this
[57:00] water shall thirst again but whosoever
[57:02] drinking of the water that i shall give
[57:04] him shall never thirst but the water
[57:07] that i shall give him shall be in him a
[57:10] well of water springing up unto
[57:13] everlasting life that's why he didn't
[57:15] have anything to draw with
[57:17] because what he was dealing with he was
[57:19] dealing with the inside man see what he
[57:22] was doing he was shining light
[57:24] honey
[57:26] he was shining light with his
[57:28] conversation the word
[57:34] hey this is one of my favorite this is
[57:36] one of my favorite combos right here boy
[57:38] whoa
[57:39] the woman said to him sir
[57:41] give me this water that i made certain
[57:43] that i that i first died neither come
[57:46] here to draw now listen to jesus jesus
[57:48] said unto her go get thy husband and
[57:51] come in
[57:53] before hallelujah she can fully come to
[57:56] that place she supposed to be he got to
[57:57] deal with her sin
[57:59] and what is he doing he's shining light
[58:02] in the area of her life that's holding
[58:04] her back
[58:08] whoa
[58:09] let me read something to you church this
[58:11] is what the prophet of god says this is
[58:13] powerful when i read this he says now
[58:15] listen he says go get your husband
[58:18] that's the sin in her life that's
[58:19] stopping her from walking in the light
[58:21] but listen what he says this is what the
[58:22] part of god says he says and then when
[58:24] the holy spirit in him
[58:26] moved away her past and showed it to her
[58:29] that light struck it what was he doing
[58:32] by addressing her situation he was
[58:34] shining light on her sin that her sin
[58:37] could never condemn her again
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:48] when you're doing wrong and the word of
[58:50] god comes and addresses that role what
[58:53] is it god is setting you free
[58:57] cause he's exposing the devil hallelujah
[58:59] by shining light in that area
[59:04] hallelujah
[59:06] he said that life struck it she said i
[59:08] perceived out to be a prophet she said
[59:10] now we know i know it that that when
[59:14] messiah cometh that he is going to he's
[59:17] going to be and we ain't had a profit in
[59:20] hundreds of years we have never had a
[59:22] true problem for hundreds of years and
[59:24] she said how you tell me about my
[59:26] husband and told me how how many i have
[59:29] and so forth why say i don't understand
[59:32] what was it jesus was taking away her
[59:34] condemnation
[59:36] [Music]
[59:38] shining light
[59:41] on the areas that's been condemning her
[59:44] here and once he dealt with that she
[59:47] said i perceive you to be a prophet
[59:52] because the scripture says she says i
[59:54] got five hallelujah she said i got five
[59:57] in the one he said yeah you got five and
[59:59] the one you with ain't yours hallelujah
[1:00:01] why because it was the seventh one jesus
[1:00:03] that was gonna set her free
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:11] because seven is completion amen
[1:00:14] hallelujah
[1:00:16] and now she really met the true husband
[1:00:18] man amen and from that conversation now
[1:00:20] everybody else thought she was just a
[1:00:22] woman hallelujah that was trapped in all
[1:00:24] these bad relationships but christ knew
[1:00:27] she was bright
[1:00:28] [Applause]
[1:00:37] and before i closed
[1:00:39] although
[1:00:40] the disciples walked with him
[1:00:43] they didn't have the holy ghost yet
[1:00:45] so they couldn't understand
[1:00:47] what was taking place
[1:00:49] so what he did before he went dead he
[1:00:51] told him to go a different way
[1:00:53] hallelujah
[1:00:54] so he could deal with her and her
[1:00:56] conscience could be made clean without
[1:00:58] feeling the condemnation of those who
[1:01:00] walk with jesus
[1:01:06] and you know
[1:01:07] we do that in the message of the hour
[1:01:08] hallelujah because some some people live
[1:01:11] a little bit higher and some are on this
[1:01:13] area are struggling that don't mean this
[1:01:15] person is better hallelujah it just
[1:01:17] means that maybe they haven't gotten
[1:01:18] there yet
[1:01:21] because look once jesus introduced
[1:01:24] himself and shine the light in her life
[1:01:26] hallelujah disciples and her all of them
[1:01:30] was in the same boat then
[1:01:36] they were no better than her all of them
[1:01:38] was walking with jesus without the holy
[1:01:40] ghost
[1:01:47] experiencing the supernatural experience
[1:01:49] in the miracles walking with jesus could
[1:01:52] none of them brothers come up to her and
[1:01:54] say i'm better than you no she can say i
[1:01:56] understand who he is god just like you
[1:01:59] do
[1:02:02] because the bible says from that moment
[1:02:05] when he shined light on her sins and she
[1:02:07] didn't feel condemned anymore she ran
[1:02:09] down into the city saying come see a man
[1:02:12] hallelujah who's told me all things
[1:02:14] about myself and the bible says that the
[1:02:17] city came out upon her words
[1:02:21] to see christ
[1:02:23] now before that moment how many of the
[1:02:26] disciples ever did that
[1:02:43] and that's the way god has today
[1:02:46] his seed is already here
[1:02:48] his word
[1:02:50] the only thing it needs is light on it
[1:02:54] and he is that light
[1:02:56] for he is the word the word and the
[1:02:58] light is the same thing the life in
[1:03:03] there is the light of word she
[1:03:06] is the life
[1:03:08] the germ of life lays within the grain
[1:03:11] and the grain the life is what breaks
[1:03:13] forth and breaks forth out the life out
[1:03:16] of the grain
[1:03:17] that's the way
[1:03:19] that christ
[1:03:20] in the word makes the word do
[1:03:23] what it's supposed to do on you
[1:03:25] so while you're listening to the word
[1:03:28] what is it doing it's opening something
[1:03:30] up in your life
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:36] he's unlocking a mystery
[1:03:41] hallelujah it ain't that we're better
[1:03:44] than anybody else it's just that god has
[1:03:46] made us in such a way that we can
[1:03:49] comprehend the light
[1:03:51] we can understand what's taking place
[1:03:54] hallelujah
[1:03:55] and now church because it is light god
[1:03:57] is given through a vindicated prophet we
[1:04:00] live day to day with the glory of god
[1:04:04] resting upon us
[1:04:11] hallelujah
[1:04:15] so when the scripture says arise and
[1:04:16] shine the light has come it's talking
[1:04:19] about you
[1:04:23] hallelujah
[1:04:24] because if you have received the word
[1:04:26] for your daily word for your hour that
[1:04:28] means you're walking in the revealed
[1:04:30] light
[1:04:31] and that means that the glory of god is
[1:04:34] resting upon you
[1:04:40] hallelujah
[1:04:42] so what we have is not just a church
[1:04:44] doctrine
[1:04:45] what we have
[1:04:47] is the shadowing of god upon us
[1:04:50] because nobody knows where the moon is
[1:04:53] and what it's doing until the sun shines
[1:04:55] on it
[1:04:57] hallelujah
[1:04:58] and nobody knows who we are and what
[1:05:00] we're doing until we came into the light
[1:05:04] hallelujah
[1:05:05] and you know they call us this they call
[1:05:07] us that and all these things but just
[1:05:09] remember when you shine light on
[1:05:11] something it never tells a lie
[1:05:16] it always speaks the truth
[1:05:20] you know like i said you can cut this
[1:05:21] room make it dark uh
[1:05:24] close all the blinds and all of us can
[1:05:26] stand outside and we have a guessing
[1:05:28] contest about how many chairs are in
[1:05:30] here
[1:05:31] yes sir right
[1:05:33] jesse might know
[1:05:35] but we can come in i said well there's
[1:05:36] probably about 80 chairs in here
[1:05:39] and somebody else said no i think about
[1:05:40] 60.
[1:05:41] somebody else would say well i think i
[1:05:43] think it's about 50 and then you can
[1:05:44] start counting the people
[1:05:47] but it's still gonna give you the
[1:05:48] correct answer the only way to know how
[1:05:51] many chairs are in here we have to come
[1:05:53] back in cut the light on and the light
[1:05:56] will reveal the number
[1:06:00] the light takes away all the mystery
[1:06:03] because then you can go one two three
[1:06:07] four
[1:06:08] you can just go oh no why because the
[1:06:10] light is revealing every spot
[1:06:14] [Applause]
[1:06:16] wow
[1:06:18] in the light of god's word is revealing
[1:06:21] every spot of your life every journey
[1:06:24] every move everything you ought to do if
[1:06:26] you walk in the light hallelujah god
[1:06:28] will stay in control of things
[1:06:35] so that's what we want church we want to
[1:06:36] walk in the light of the revealed word
[1:06:42] listen don't follow these people up to
[1:06:44] my the messages and the message that and
[1:06:47] brother branham this and brother brown
[1:06:48] said listen i don't care
[1:06:52] you can say what you want to say about
[1:06:54] the prophet you can say what you want to
[1:06:55] say about jeffersonville all that stuff
[1:06:58] as far as i'm concerned brother branham
[1:06:59] did his job concerning me
[1:07:02] all right
[1:07:04] introduce me to the light
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:10] i ain't looking for a greater light
[1:07:12] hallelujah because this light hallelujah
[1:07:16] it shines so bright that it never goes
[1:07:18] dark
[1:07:20] hallelujah
[1:07:22] it took away the mystery of service
[1:07:24] now i know who i served amen
[1:07:29] i serve hallelujah
[1:07:30] and how to get back to him to serve
[1:07:32] again
[1:07:35] that's what this message has done
[1:07:37] the people who are walking in darkness
[1:07:38] and comprehend the night not the
[1:07:40] comprehensive not the light they're
[1:07:43] putting everything on brother branham
[1:07:44] when it was never about him
[1:07:47] it was always about the one who would
[1:07:49] shine here amen
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:53] and the one that is shining is christ
[1:07:57] it's like the trinitarians they believe
[1:07:59] in three gods
[1:08:01] right right the truth believe in three
[1:08:02] gods think about it you can tell they're
[1:08:04] walking in a false life
[1:08:05] because the scripture says god is a
[1:08:07] jealous god
[1:08:08] so if you get to heaven the trinity and
[1:08:11] doctrine are you going to worship
[1:08:13] because god is a jealous god
[1:08:15] you go to jesus the father gonna get
[1:08:17] jealous
[1:08:18] you go to the father god go get jealous
[1:08:21] if you go to you go to god the son gonna
[1:08:24] get jealous
[1:08:25] so which one is it
