[39:05] those hebrew names of god tonight
[39:09] as i've been as i've been beginning to
[39:10] study that subject it's a tremendous
[39:12] subject i'm getting a lot of notes you
[39:14] know from
[39:14] schofield like brother branham did so
[39:16] i'd like to preach on that tonight and
[39:18] so i did all my slides on that subject i
[39:20] don't really have any slides for you

[39:22] hope that's okay just just nice to have
[39:24] slides you can see when brother branham
[39:25] said it when the bible said it
[39:27] you know other other pictures and things
[39:30] joshua 7 verse 1
[39:37] joshua 7 verse 1.
[39:42] let's just read verse one together then
[39:44] we'll read isaiah 41
[39:46] 10.
[39:49] okay so let's begin on three one two
[39:51] three but the children of
[39:53] israel committed a trespass in the
[39:56] accursed thing
[39:58] for achan the son of kharmi the son of
[40:01] zabday the son of zerah of the tribe of
[40:05] judah
[40:06] took of the accursed thing and the anger
[40:09] of the lord was
[40:10] kindled against the children of israel
[40:13] praise god let's go to isaiah 41 this is
[40:16] a little memory verse just ask the lord
[40:18] to
[40:18] write this upon our hearts we just want
[40:21] to thank everybody that could come on
[40:22] wednesday night thank you naomi and the
[40:24] family and
[40:25] were you here wednesday night god bless
[40:27] you sister hua thanks everybody for
[40:29] showing up wednesday when brother simon
[40:30] ministered
[40:31] my family as i said was on vacation so
[40:33] we wrote in pennsylvania
[40:35] but thank you for your support for the
[40:37] things of god it's a joy to be a
[40:38] christian
[40:39] and i just appreciate everybody's love
[40:41] and support
[40:43] may god bless you richly isaiah 41
[40:47] verse 10.
[40:56] so this is a wonderful scripture just a
[40:57] real encouraging scripture god
[40:59] tells israel through the prophet isaiah
[41:02] so let's read verse
[41:03] verse 10. ready one two three fear thou
[41:06] not for i am with thee be not dismayed
[41:10] for i am thy god i will strengthen thee
[41:14] yea i will help thee yea i will uphold
[41:18] thee
[41:18] with the right hand of my righteousness
[41:21] may god has blessings the ring of his
[41:23] word may be seed if you like here
[41:37] so let's get right to the word of god
[41:39] last week we looked at we actually took
[41:41] both
[41:41] services last sunday on the book of
[41:43] joshua
[41:45] and so i'll just kind of rehearse a
[41:46] little bit you know we uh
[41:49] we looked at the conquest of jericho uh
[41:52] last week and then we looked at uh
[41:55] in the morning and then we looked at uh
[41:58] more scriptures on it in the evening
[42:02] so let me just flip over there
[42:06] you know i think this will tie together
[42:07] you know names of god very
[42:09] uh very uh nicely to help you understand
[42:13] how many know the name joshua means
[42:15] jehovah is our salvation
[42:17] so in the hebrew the name joshua is
[42:20] yeshua
[42:21] right which is
[42:24] jehovah is our salvation now the english
[42:27] translation is joshua right that's what
[42:29] that's how
[42:30] we say jehovah is salvation
[42:33] now the greek translation of that name
[42:35] joshua is
[42:36] jesus so it's a different than the
[42:39] translators when they had to
[42:40] differentiate between joshua and jesus
[42:43] they just use the greek form of joshua
[42:45] and so when we say
[42:46] jesus we're actually saying the greek
[42:48] word joshua because it'd be a little bit
[42:50] confusing right to have
[42:51] every time you talk about think about
[42:53] that if you open up your bible every
[42:55] time in the new testament said jesus
[42:57] what it is
[42:59] but to the translators one
[43:02] right and not to get any confusion uh so
[43:05] they
[43:07] greek word for joshua jesus
[43:10] and so we read jesus will save his
[43:12] people from his sins right in matthew
[43:14] chapter
[43:15] one right yeshua
[43:18] will save us from our sins and so
[43:21] joshua here as we look in the the book
[43:24] of joshua
[43:25] is a great figure of jesus christ right
[43:28] because joshua is salvation now we know
[43:32] there's many types of
[43:34] of the promised land right there's the
[43:36] type of going to heaven can be your
[43:37] promised land how are we looking forward
[43:38] to that promised land
[43:40] praise god uh there's also the type of
[43:43] the promised land of the baptism of the
[43:44] holy ghost
[43:45] that's what brother ram said he said i
[43:46] want all i want to see all my church
[43:48] cross over into that promised land amen
[43:52] that's a beautiful type to see that we
[43:55] got to come out of egypt through
[43:56] being saved be sanctified in the
[43:58] wilderness and then
[43:59] cross over into our promises our
[44:02] possessions
[44:03] that god has for us then you have
[44:05] another type brother brahm says his
[44:07] third pole
[44:08] he said i've got to leave this second
[44:09] pole i've got to go forward beyond
[44:11] jordan
[44:12] into the third pole the opening of the
[44:15] seals the speaking of the word right
[44:17] the revelations of marriage and divorce
[44:18] and all the all thus say the lord
[44:20] revelation so we have
[44:22] many good examples here many
[44:24] applications
[44:25] for the promised land but for you and i
[44:27] i like to stay on this one about
[44:29] us uh taking the promised land today
[44:32] because brother
[44:33] brother man teaches and the bible is
[44:34] clear about it we don't want to miss the
[44:36] promises for today
[44:38] we can all thank god for what god did
[44:40] for joshua we can all thank god for what
[44:42] god's going to do
[44:44] but we want to thank god for what he's
[44:46] doing right now and then also be a
[44:48] participant
[44:49] in what he's doing right now praise god
[44:51] because like the pharisees they thank
[44:53] god for what he was and
[44:54] what he would be but they missed jesus
[44:56] christ right there
[44:57] they missed the present word of god in
[45:00] their day
[45:00] and that's what we believe we are we
[45:02] believe we're packing the present
[45:04] revelation of the word of god praise god
[45:07] like i was sharing with you a few weeks
[45:08] ago the azusa street movement
[45:11] had a lot it started out perfect if you
[45:14] if you research it you'll see
[45:15] it started off with prayer fasting and
[45:17] then unknown tongues and interpretations
[45:20] were perfect
[45:21] but within less than 20 years by 1920
[45:25] a group had already organized and made
[45:28] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[45:30] speaking in tongues but that was wrong
[45:32] that
[45:33] speaking in tongues is not the evidence
[45:35] of the holy ghost right it's just one of
[45:36] the signs that you're born again
[45:39] right because the bible has says
[45:41] different people when
[45:42] people got filled they either magnified
[45:44] god you could prophesy
[45:46] right you could shout scream cry
[45:49] dance in the spirit there's a lot of
[45:51] things you could do when the holy ghost
[45:52] comes but one thing you'll do
[45:54] is magnify god amen one thing you'll do
[45:57] is have an experience
[45:58] where the bible says you can see it and
[46:00] hear it praise god
[46:03] and so and it was actually through
[46:05] charles parnum he was a
[46:06] pentecostal preacher he was the first
[46:09] one that actually started preaching the
[46:10] three works of grace
[46:12] right but his third work was speaking in
[46:14] tongues which that was true for
[46:16] the day of pentecost but that's not true
[46:18] for everybody
[46:20] right because there's a purpose god
[46:21] needed those tongues there because there
[46:23] were 17 different
[46:24] nations that needed to hear the gospel
[46:26] praise god
[46:28] and he had already prophesied in isaiah
[46:30] 800 years earlier
[46:31] with stammering lips and other tongues
[46:34] will i speak to this people
[46:35] and yet they would not hear praise god
[46:38] now look at that the prophecy said most
[46:40] wouldn't hear
[46:41] but thank god i've heard the word of god
[46:43] amen i think
[46:44] that's how it is today most people won't
[46:47] hear most people won't receive the open
[46:49] book
[46:50] of the seven seals praise god most
[46:53] people won't receive that but we are the
[46:54] ones
[46:55] that do receive it praise god we are the
[46:58] ones that take the book like john in
[47:00] revelation 10.
[47:01] eat it and then prophesy again to many
[47:04] nations
[47:05] peoples kindreds and tongues it's our
[47:08] job to eat the word of god
[47:10] it's our job to continually feast upon
[47:12] the word of god
[47:13] and tell somebody about it oh thank god
[47:17] amen
[47:18] so it's it's through this illustration i
[47:20] just want to background that a little
[47:21] bit
[47:22] but see and then they broke up into
[47:23] denominations you know you had the
[47:25] the pentecostal and then you had the
[47:27] oneness then you had the tunis
[47:29] and you have assemblies of god which i
[47:30] was raised in and thank god it was a
[47:32] very
[47:33] good group of people they were very
[47:34] loving but with their doctrine
[47:36] they hinder god they limit god
[47:40] right their doctrine limits god and
[47:43] and then when we see it we for example
[47:46] uh you know i went to the class when i
[47:48] was
[47:48] at the church and they said well you got
[47:50] to speak in tongues while i showed them
[47:51] well the bible says not all speak with
[47:53] tongues
[47:54] i showed the pastor that the bible said
[47:56] not all speak with tongues and his
[47:57] answer was
[47:58] that's just what we believe now to me
[48:00] that's not enough
[48:01] if there's a question i want a bible
[48:03] answer praise god
[48:05] the bible said not all have gifts of
[48:07] healing not all speak with tongues
[48:09] not all are apostles not all are
[48:10] missionaries but all those who have the
[48:12] holy ghost will be led into
[48:14] all truth all of god's truth praise god
[48:17] that's one way you know you see your
[48:19] life being brought
[48:21] further into the truth of god's word
[48:23] you're constantly growing
[48:25] feasting on the things of god you're
[48:27] becoming more like christ all the time
[48:29] amen hallelujah
[48:32] so the denomination just rose up and
[48:35] rose up and and right raising up but we
[48:37] believe we're in this group
[48:38] that has received the revelation peter
[48:40] calls it the present truth
[48:42] praise god and the present truth is that
[48:45] jesus christ
[48:46] is the same today yesterday today
[48:49] and forever and that jesus christ is
[48:52] going to restore
[48:53] all things before the end time
[48:56] so let's go to matthew 17 11 can you
[48:58] just put that up there i just want to
[48:59] show this
[48:59] the word of this day is jesus christ is
[49:02] the same
[49:03] and he's restoring all that the book of
[49:06] acts was
[49:08] man because many churches have lost that
[49:10] many churches have lost the power
[49:12] of healing the sick or speaking in
[49:15] tongues
[49:16] right or or living a holy life
[49:19] many muslim have lost have lost that
[49:21] they've lost the power of living a holy
[49:23] life
[49:24] and obeying every word of god that's the
[49:26] main thing that they've lost
[49:28] but look jesus answered said elias truly
[49:31] shall first come
[49:32] and restore all things so jesus said
[49:35] before the end time
[49:37] everything has to be restored like it
[49:39] was
[49:40] at the beginning praise god now go to
[49:42] acts 3 20 acts 3
[49:44] 20. i just thought i lay this foundation
[49:46] here
[49:47] acts 3 20.
[49:57] and he shall send jesus christ which was
[49:59] before
[50:00] i'm sorry before was preached unto you
[50:02] verse 21. acacia thank you
[50:04] whom the heaven must receive now look
[50:07] heaven's going to keep jesus
[50:09] until the times of restitution
[50:12] of all things now we know when jesus
[50:15] comes back at the rapture he leaves
[50:17] heaven
[50:18] and he comes down to the sky amen so
[50:21] before jesus comes down to the sky
[50:23] everything's got to be restored praise
[50:25] god and that don't mean
[50:27] uh the future whole and the new
[50:29] jerusalem that's what he's talking about
[50:30] he's talking about the faith of the
[50:32] fathers right
[50:33] the apostolic ministry from the day of
[50:36] pentecost
[50:36] that's got to be restored praise god the
[50:39] life that they live the full doctrine
[50:41] the power the love that they had for one
[50:44] another the discipleship that they had
[50:46] all that has to be restored until heaven
[50:49] allows
[50:50] come back and meet his bride in the air
[50:53] at the rapture
[50:56] it's since the world began praise god
[50:59] amen so that's that's what we can see
[51:02] now
[51:03] now here we are here we're we're in the
[51:05] restoring of all things i listed off
[51:08] some of them
[51:08] last time but you know people today have
[51:10] women preachers but that wasn't in the
[51:12] beginning
[51:13] so a church that has women preachers is
[51:15] not being restored back to the beginning
[51:18] because when jesus started he only had
[51:19] 12 men
[51:21] he didn't choose any sisters now he had
[51:23] sisters to feed and
[51:25] and clothe and help him out that was a
[51:26] great blessing but
[51:28] just men to preach praise god right and
[51:31] that's what god's doing he's restoring
[51:32] back all of those
[51:35] or you get a leading from the lord now
[51:37] today churches will just
[51:39] decide they'll guess and say well you
[51:41] have a they'll they try to impart gifts
[51:43] you ever seen that they just try to
[51:44] impart gifts to people
[51:45] but they probably never prayed and
[51:47] fasted beforehand
[51:50] trying to get people emotional but in
[51:53] the bible
[51:54] people said paul and barnabas serve god
[51:56] with prayer and fastings
[51:58] and they did that until the holy spirit
[52:00] spoke praise god
[52:02] now that's real devotion praise god
[52:04] that's really seeking god
[52:06] and that's what we want to see restored
[52:07] today praise god amen
[52:09] where saints like us will pray and fast
[52:11] until god gives an answer
[52:13] amen whatever they had to be getting
[52:16] it's going to be restored today
[52:18] before jesus comes back to meet us in
[52:20] the air amen
[52:22] everything they had is going to be
[52:24] restored
[52:25] and if it wasn't there at the book of
[52:26] acts in the beginning it's not going to
[52:27] be there with the true church at the end
[52:30] and i'm talking about the true church
[52:31] because jesus said there's two kinds of
[52:33] christians
[52:33] there's wise christians and foolish
[52:35] christians
[52:37] now this will help you so much before i
[52:39] knew this revelation i was so confused
[52:41] how can these people be christians and
[52:42] not act like other people
[52:44] it's because of this there's two
[52:46] different kinds just like you have sil
[52:48] or gold and silver they're both valuable
[52:51] but one's more valuable than the other
[52:53] praise god
[52:54] hallelujah and so in jesus eyes they're
[52:56] saints that have
[52:57] oil they've made preparation they spent
[53:00] more time
[53:01] praying amen they spent more time
[53:03] reading the word
[53:04] fasting seeking god they spent more time
[53:07] and prepared oil
[53:09] so they're wise they've redeemed the
[53:11] time
[53:12] but you also have other people that
[53:14] they're virgin to the word they don't
[53:15] have any idols in their life
[53:17] they just don't have the oil and they
[53:19] don't have the same type of life
[53:21] they haven't produced the oil in their
[53:23] life they didn't make the effort to get
[53:25] the oil
[53:26] i want to be one of those wise ones that
[53:28] spent my time storing up
[53:30] oil amen and having plenty of oil so
[53:33] that i'll have a light
[53:34] when the bridegroom comes amen i have a
[53:37] light to go out and meet the bridegroom
[53:39] i won't be saying where's the light
[53:40] where's the light where's the oil i need
[53:42] oil
[53:43] i'll say i've got oil praise god i know
[53:46] it because i made the time to go get it
[53:48] praise god
[53:48] and i'm going out to meet the bridegroom
[53:52] hallelujah and so that makes us we can
[53:55] be happy though still for foolish
[53:56] virgins because at least they're virgin
[53:58] right at least they're virgin but
[54:00] they've got to get the oil themselves
[54:02] praise god
[54:03] they've got to repent and be baptized in
[54:06] the name of jesus christ
[54:09] just like peter said you want the holy
[54:11] ghost repent and be baptized
[54:13] and in the name of jesus christ and you
[54:15] shall be filled with the gift of the
[54:17] holy ghost praise god
[54:19] see many people won't repent they won't
[54:21] repent of uh
[54:22] bitterness right they won't repent of
[54:24] lust or or greed or fear
[54:26] they won't repent of these things right
[54:28] anger and wrath and
[54:29] and malice and all these things they
[54:31] won't repent of that but a real
[54:32] christian says god
[54:33] clean out my entire vessel praise god
[54:36] anything that's within me that doesn't
[54:38] please you
[54:39] clean it out of my life wash me out so
[54:42] you can totally fill me praise god
[54:44] that's what a real christian prays
[54:46] that's what we pray today praise god
[54:48] and we continue to ask god to clean out
[54:51] our lives even if we're born again
[54:52] clean out our minds because our soul is
[54:54] born again but our mind needs
[54:56] transformed amen
[54:58] our mind needs refocus on the things of
[55:01] god
[55:02] and that's and that it's god letting the
[55:04] light shine into darkness praise god
[55:07] our minds sometimes get clouded in
[55:08] darkness but the light of god
[55:10] shines in our our minds and our minds
[55:13] get illuminated
[55:14] by the transformation of the word yes
[55:17] that's right
[55:18] now now let's get back to joshua now now
[55:21] in last week we went over joshua 6 and i
[55:24] didn't get a
[55:24] chance to hit some scriptures so let's
[55:27] go to uh james 4
[55:29] 3 please james 4 3 can you pull it up
[55:31] there
[55:33] i just wanted to remind us that remember
[55:35] the bible said that by
[55:37] faith the walls of jericho fell down
[55:41] by faith simple faith brought the walls
[55:44] down
[55:45] and i just want you to notice here let's
[55:47] look at a few scriptures as long as they
[55:49] just they just had to keep the word
[55:51] of the captain of the lord's host praise
[55:53] god
[55:54] just do what the captain says in this
[55:57] case it was six trips around right
[55:59] six rotations around and in the seventh
[56:01] day they did seven rotations for 13
[56:04] rotations
[56:06] see 13 is a good number yeah jesus plus
[56:08] 12 disciples
[56:09] that's a good number satan tries to say
[56:11] it's a bad number satan's a liar
[56:14] satan doesn't know the word like he
[56:15] thinks right now i'm not gonna
[56:17] i'm not gonna say much about that but
[56:20] see they just had to have faith praise
[56:22] god
[56:22] faith brought the walls down now here
[56:25] now look at this sometimes church we
[56:28] just have to simply obey the word of god
[56:31] sometimes you know god just wants us to
[56:33] sit back and trust in him
[56:36] and that's what we're going to see today
[56:37] as we get to jericho with an ai
[56:40] jericho is going to be a more passive
[56:42] victory
[56:43] right so there's times that we just have
[56:45] to obey the word
[56:46] just just keep going around and around
[56:48] the same thing just keep going around
[56:50] there's no we're not shooting we're not
[56:52] swiping anybody with our sword right
[56:54] we're not
[56:54] we're not cutting anything down we're
[56:56] just marching in position right
[56:58] we're just keeping the routine amen
[57:01] right sunday in wednesday in sunday in
[57:03] wednesday in
[57:04] sometime saturday in you know sometimes
[57:06] friday night in
[57:07] you just around and around you go and
[57:10] you're just walking you're just marching
[57:12] right but then there's other times where
[57:14] god calls you to go out
[57:16] and swing the sword praise god and shut
[57:18] down the enemy
[57:19] but in this case god was saying just
[57:22] trust me
[57:22] just obey just just be still and know
[57:26] that i'm god amen
[57:28] and this is going to be the first battle
[57:30] in the promised land
[57:32] the first battle after being born again
[57:34] can you remember yours i really can't
[57:36] remember mine but
[57:37] there you can remember what was your
[57:38] first great battle
[57:40] after you were born again i can tell you
[57:43] one i know for sure
[57:44] jesus christ his first battle was the
[57:47] wilderness fight with satan
[57:49] that was a jericho brother william jesus
[57:52] had to go up this jericho
[57:54] the spirit led him to face not a small
[57:56] enemy
[57:57] but the greatest enemy satan himself
[58:01] the the the son of the mourning himself
[58:04] right
[58:05] the light bearer himself that's what
[58:07] lucifer means in the hebrew
[58:08] lightbearer the light bear himself the
[58:11] brightest angel
[58:12] you know the we say the most beautiful
[58:14] angel of all of them
[58:16] god led jesus he's freshly born again
[58:19] brother said you would have thought
[58:20] that god would have led him you know to
[58:22] heal the sick
[58:24] but brother ahm said god was testing out
[58:27] his inoculation
[58:28] to see if it would work against the
[58:30] enemy praise god
[58:32] hallelujah in other words god inoculated
[58:35] jesus with his own spear
[58:37] and he said i want to test this spirit
[58:38] out and i'm going to test it out with
[58:40] the hardest one
[58:41] first god didn't try it out on some
[58:43] little enemy or some
[58:45] some lesser devil he's he tried
[58:49] yes he tried that
[58:53] had a modern jericho and we know how
[58:58] where they overcame in jericho just obey
[59:00] the word
[59:02] just stand behind the word jesus didn't
[59:04] do any miracles
[59:06] he just quoted the word all he had to do
[59:09] was stand just like paul said paul said
[59:11] having done all just stand on the word
[59:14] of god
[59:16] see something jesus wasn't you know uh
[59:18] doing miracles and trying to perform
[59:20] this and calling things and calling
[59:21] storms
[59:22] he was just speaking the word he was
[59:24] just standing there with the revelation
[59:27] god gave him
[59:28] and god gave him the victory praise god
[59:31] hallelujah now here's what i want to get
[59:34] to see in our times church
[59:37] if we're going through a past of victory
[59:39] we have to make sure we just pray the
[59:41] right way
[59:43] right you ask and receive not because
[59:45] you ask a miss that you may consume it
[59:47] upon your lusts
[59:49] see sometimes you know we may not be
[59:51] seeing the victory because we're praying
[59:53] the wrong thing
[59:55] right we wonder why is it why isn't the
[59:56] victory coming see because sometimes we
[59:58] want to see god
[59:59] answer our requests in our desire or in
[1:00:02] our way
[1:00:03] but james tells us don't ask what you
[1:00:06] want ask for the will of the lord praise
[1:00:08] god
[1:00:09] right now we make our request known unto
[1:00:12] god
[1:00:13] philippians says but we do it with
[1:00:14] thanksgiving amen
[1:00:16] and then after that then the peace of
[1:00:17] god comes upon us but we must ask
[1:00:20] the right thing praise god now go to
[1:00:22] first john 3
[1:00:23] 20 and 20 20 first john 3
[1:00:26] 20 21 22
[1:00:32] see joshua just had to keep the details
[1:00:35] of the word
[1:00:37] the simple details here
[1:00:41] and if he just kept the word and they
[1:00:43] just they just
[1:00:44] got into the routine of god's word god
[1:00:47] was going to fight for them how many
[1:00:48] seen that god fight for you praise god
[1:00:50] all she did was just obey the word you
[1:00:53] didn't have an all-night prayer meeting
[1:00:54] you didn't cast out a devil right you
[1:00:56] sometimes you have to do that right but
[1:00:59] you just kept the word of god you just
[1:01:00] did the same routine
[1:01:02] over and over just praying reading my
[1:01:04] bible going to church
[1:01:05] loving god listening to sermons singing
[1:01:07] to god i just got the same routine and
[1:01:10] the wall
[1:01:11] he fell down before me amen how did you
[1:01:14] do that
[1:01:14] by faith by faith just believing god's
[1:01:18] word
[1:01:18] just staying faithful praise god just
[1:01:20] keeping all the sin out
[1:01:22] and obeying the simple instruction of
[1:01:24] the word of god you'll get many
[1:01:26] victories
[1:01:26] just by being faithful praise god
[1:01:29] hallelujah
[1:01:31] first john 3 verse 20.
[1:01:35] can you pull that up there please
[1:01:36] sweetie first john 3 20.
[1:01:38] now yeah mj and i were talking about
[1:01:40] this a couple weeks ago right brother
[1:01:42] for if our heart condemn us god is
[1:01:44] greater than our heart and knoweth
[1:01:46] all things so see god knows when we've
[1:01:49] asked the wrong way
[1:01:50] okay now next verse beloved if our heart
[1:01:54] condemns us not then we have confidence
[1:01:55] toward god
[1:01:56] now that just directly applies to where
[1:01:58] we're going in joshua with achan right
[1:02:01] achan couldn't expect the blessings of
[1:02:03] god because he'd broken the word of god
[1:02:06] right he had a heart that condemned him
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:09] but see joshua and all the other people
[1:02:11] they had a pure heart
[1:02:13] so they knew god was with them and they
[1:02:15] should have got the victory
[1:02:17] they should have been able to overcome
[1:02:19] but but see there
[1:02:20] there's someone wrong in the camp
[1:02:22] remember brother and tells us joshua is
[1:02:24] a lesson to the church
[1:02:25] that it must be a perfect walk and the
[1:02:28] only way we can walk perfect
[1:02:29] is by jesus forgiveness through the
[1:02:31] blood
[1:02:33] each day saying god forgive me god help
[1:02:36] me
[1:02:36] god strengthen me god prepare me help me
[1:02:38] to be humble today
[1:02:40] help me to be obedient today help me to
[1:02:42] be about your business lord
[1:02:44] now verse 22 and whatsoever we ask we
[1:02:47] receive a hymn because we keep his
[1:02:48] commands there we go
[1:02:49] and do those things that are pleasing to
[1:02:50] sight and i'm sorry we talked about a
[1:02:52] different verse brother
[1:02:52] we talked about the one there's a sin
[1:02:54] that you don't pray for
[1:02:56] right and that was for blasphemy i'm
[1:02:57] sorry
[1:02:59] that's right thank you brother yes yes i
[1:03:01] got that mixed up forgive me
[1:03:03] yes we were talking about the there's a
[1:03:04] sin you don't pray for jesus said i pray
[1:03:06] not for the world
[1:03:08] so see there are some things like
[1:03:09] blasphemy of the holy ghost you don't
[1:03:10] pray for people like that
[1:03:12] right but if you're not certain you
[1:03:13] still pray for them praise god because
[1:03:15] bless those who persecute you
[1:03:17] and do good to them that hate you praise
[1:03:19] god right
[1:03:20] yeah that's right so what sir we ask we
[1:03:23] receive a hymn because we keep his
[1:03:24] commands and do those things that are
[1:03:26] pleasing so
[1:03:26] we see the same principle in joshua's
[1:03:28] day carrying over to the new testament
[1:03:31] you can expect god to answer your
[1:03:33] prayers if we keep his word
[1:03:35] because our heart doesn't condemn us
[1:03:37] that's why it's so important to get up
[1:03:38] and say god
[1:03:39] get up in the morning say god forgive me
[1:03:40] of anything wrong i did yesterday and of
[1:03:42] course we should go to bed saying that
[1:03:43] lord forgive me anything wrong i did
[1:03:45] today lord
[1:03:46] cleanse me because remember in the old
[1:03:47] testament they had morning sacrifice
[1:03:49] and evening sacrifice you should pray in
[1:03:52] the morning and pray in the evening and
[1:03:54] the church said
[1:03:55] you should have a time of sacrifice and
[1:03:57] family alter time or personal
[1:03:59] author time right so that all your sins
[1:04:02] are confessed and that way you know
[1:04:04] the power of god can move in your life
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:08] now go to mark one this scripture came
[1:04:11] back to me the other day
[1:04:14] mark 1 32 i want you to see how humble
[1:04:18] jesus christ was
[1:04:20] i want you to see how he humbled himself
[1:04:22] even after great victories
[1:04:32] i believe this is at capernaum if i'm
[1:04:34] not mistaken
[1:04:36] jesus heals simon's wife who laid with a
[1:04:38] fever just by raising her up
[1:04:40] he cast out uh the demons
[1:04:44] out of a man in the synagogue earlier in
[1:04:46] the chapter and look at verse 32
[1:04:48] and that even when the sun did set they
[1:04:50] brought unto him all that were diseased
[1:04:52] and then that were possessed
[1:04:54] of devils look all this is not a small
[1:04:55] it's not one person this is a lot of
[1:04:57] people
[1:04:58] and simon and they that were with him
[1:05:00] followed after him i'm sorry i skipped
[1:05:02] the verse verse 33
[1:05:03] and all the city was gathered together
[1:05:04] at the door and he healed many that were
[1:05:07] sick of diverse
[1:05:09] diseases and cast out many devils and
[1:05:11] suffered not the devils to speak
[1:05:13] because they knew him look at how
[1:05:15] powerful jesus invite
[1:05:16] the whole city comes out to see jesus
[1:05:19] what a revival this must have been
[1:05:22] and everybody sick in the city got
[1:05:24] healed praise god
[1:05:26] all the all the oppression all the
[1:05:29] torment
[1:05:30] left in one prayer meeting can i say it
[1:05:32] like that in one prayer line
[1:05:35] hallelujah jesus when he was there he
[1:05:38] healed
[1:05:39] everyone in the prayer line and it
[1:05:40] caused great joy in the city praise god
[1:05:43] oh that's beautiful look at verse 34.
[1:05:46] and i'm sorry you read that verse 34.
[1:05:49] no yeah yeah now verse 35
[1:05:52] look he has a great tremendous campaign
[1:05:55] he heals the whole city brothers
[1:05:58] now look at verse 35 in the morning did
[1:06:01] he sleep in
[1:06:03] no no it's okay to sleep in from time to
[1:06:05] time right i did it this last week
[1:06:07] because i'm on vacation
[1:06:09] but in the morning rising up a great
[1:06:10] while before day look he did all these
[1:06:12] miracles
[1:06:13] and look what he did he had to make sure
[1:06:15] he stayed humble
[1:06:18] he went out and departed into a solitary
[1:06:20] place
[1:06:21] and there prayed goodness gracious
[1:06:26] see look he spent all that energy
[1:06:28] casting out devils praying for the sick
[1:06:29] and he said if i'm going to get any time
[1:06:31] with my father it's got to be early in
[1:06:33] the morning
[1:06:34] because then peter follows him and said
[1:06:35] hey everybody's looking for you in the
[1:06:36] city
[1:06:38] see when even when you're doing the
[1:06:40] father's work the father still wants to
[1:06:42] talk personally with you
[1:06:44] is that right church you might be doing
[1:06:46] all the father wants you to do
[1:06:48] and and people are blessed and everybody
[1:06:50] loves you and it's a great
[1:06:51] victory and you're sitting in heavenly
[1:06:53] places gotta say like that
[1:06:55] everybody's in joy and worship and
[1:06:57] everything's happy
[1:06:59] but god still wants time with you
[1:07:02] amen and if jesus christ had to do it
[1:07:05] how much more do we have to do it
[1:07:07] he did not have sin in his members he
[1:07:09] had death in his members
[1:07:11] right he was the word made flesh but he
[1:07:13] still had death in his members right
[1:07:15] he didn't have the sin nature like we've
[1:07:17] got but we've got death
[1:07:18] and sin in our members but thank god we
[1:07:20] got the holy ghost in our souls amen
[1:07:23] and that's what we got to make sure we
[1:07:25] have that fellowship with god in the
[1:07:26] morning
[1:07:27] so god can strengthen our soul right
[1:07:29] renew our minds
[1:07:31] we got to have fellowship with father
[1:07:33] every day
[1:07:35] see great victories doesn't mean get
[1:07:38] hold on god great
[1:07:39] victories mean lord prepare me for the
[1:07:41] next day
[1:07:43] that i can be ready to do your will
[1:07:46] see jesus wasn't going to be prideful
[1:07:49] how many want to be humble before the
[1:07:50] lord
[1:07:51] no matter what great testimonies we have
[1:07:53] we want to remain humble that's one of
[1:07:54] the most important things to do
[1:07:56] we can't get lifted up in pride think
[1:07:58] we're better than somebody we're not
[1:08:00] better than anybody right
[1:08:02] we may have a higher calling like the
[1:08:03] gold and the silver we have a higher
[1:08:04] value because we're keeping more of the
[1:08:06] word
[1:08:06] right but we're still no better we're
[1:08:08] we're still sinners saved by grace
[1:08:11] and we don't want pride to come in and
[1:08:13] ruin our testimony
[1:08:15] because the bible said you can lose your
[1:08:17] rewards we don't want to lose any reward
[1:08:19] praise god
[1:08:20] we want to gain all the rewards for the
[1:08:23] glory of god
[1:08:24] almighty amen for god's glory remember
[1:08:26] jesus said the father
[1:08:28] is glorified when you bear much fruit
[1:08:30] praise god
[1:08:31] so our rewards are not for our glory
[1:08:34] they're for god's glory amen
[1:08:37] god gets more glory when when more
[1:08:39] things happen in our lives and
[1:08:40] there's more testimonies god is the one
[1:08:42] who's glorified
[1:08:44] because we look around ourselves and say
[1:08:45] i know she couldn't do it i know he
[1:08:46] couldn't do it
[1:08:47] i definitely know he couldn't do it
[1:08:49] right the only one that can do it was
[1:08:51] god so god gets all the glory
[1:08:53] praise god amen now back to
[1:08:57] joshua now if you got your bibles go
[1:09:00] back to joshua 7.
[1:09:04] so see we can see this jericho jesus had
[1:09:06] a jericho moment
[1:09:09] right he come against this mighty enemy
[1:09:11] he was already fasted and praying 40
[1:09:13] days right
[1:09:14] but he's able to overcome just by
[1:09:16] quoting the word
[1:09:18] quote the word quote the word believe
[1:09:20] the word believe the word
[1:09:23] so if you haven't been born again yet
[1:09:25] once you get born again
[1:09:26] get ready god's going to test out that
[1:09:28] inoculation you got
[1:09:30] you're going to be tested maybe your
[1:09:32] family will come against you right
[1:09:34] that's a great test maybe you have an
[1:09:35] accident that'd be a great test
[1:09:37] maybe you have a sickness maybe you have
[1:09:39] someone uh
[1:09:41] reproach you revile you you may have
[1:09:43] some great battle
[1:09:45] but god is gonna show you greater is he
[1:09:48] that's in you
[1:09:48] than he that's in the world amen there
[1:09:51] was no one greater than satan as far as
[1:09:53] power
[1:09:54] but jesus's inoculation jesus's
[1:09:56] anointing
[1:09:57] stood the test it overcame the enemy and
[1:10:00] that's what god's looking for today
[1:10:02] overcomers in fact that's what the book
[1:10:05] could be could be called if you could
[1:10:07] summon up
[1:10:08] overcoming and remember
[1:10:12] that's all they did every time they
[1:10:14] overcome god said set up a
[1:10:15] memorial right set up some stones
[1:10:18] go build an altar i just said don't
[1:10:21] forget this
[1:10:23] church that's why we can't forget of
[1:10:24] course please don't go to sleep if i
[1:10:27] start telling
[1:10:27] sister who is testimony about her dad
[1:10:30] how many times have i shared that but
[1:10:32] church the reason we do that
[1:10:33] is because it reminds us of how powerful
[1:10:36] god is
[1:10:37] if god did it there god can do it again
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:40] now he may do it a different way he
[1:10:42] doesn't do it always the same way
[1:10:44] but we know if he did it once he can do
[1:10:47] it again
[1:10:48] and if our god was faithful last year
[1:10:50] he's faithful this year amen
[1:10:52] hallelujah because remember when you
[1:10:55] forget
[1:10:56] you start backsliding
[1:10:59] right let's go ahead and go to it uh
[1:11:01] second peter one i might as well since
[1:11:03] i'm on the thought right now i
[1:11:04] didn't really have it on my notes second
[1:11:07] peter one
[1:11:10] church if we are not constantly adding
[1:11:12] testimonies can i say it like that
[1:11:14] if we're not constantly adding
[1:11:15] testimonies we're going to forget while
[1:11:17] the god is done
[1:11:20] second peter chapter one of course the
[1:11:22] statue of every man one of my favorite
[1:11:23] subjects i've preached
[1:11:24] many times which i love it and brother
[1:11:26] william i'm going to keep preaching it
[1:11:27] many more times
[1:11:29] because peter says in this chapter he
[1:11:31] said you know i'm going to die soon but
[1:11:33] i'm going to always keep you in
[1:11:34] remembrance of this
[1:11:35] he said if you don't keep adding to your
[1:11:37] stature you're going to forget you're
[1:11:39] forgiven
[1:11:41] right that's what he says now
[1:11:48] now look at verse nine now you know we
[1:11:50] have that we have that beautiful picture
[1:11:51] over there sister wendy
[1:11:52] faith virtue knowledge tempers see those
[1:11:54] are those are christian
[1:11:56] levels god wants to raise us up in i
[1:11:58] know the denominational world
[1:12:00] that you really use the word level and
[1:12:01] they say oh you're going to go up a
[1:12:02] level
[1:12:03] and they don't even know what they're
[1:12:04] talking about right right by the way
[1:12:06] they say you're gonna go up a level
[1:12:08] you're gonna make a million dollars
[1:12:09] instead of a hundred times
[1:12:10] god don't care about that level god
[1:12:12] wants you to get a level up there
[1:12:14] god wants you to be filled with his
[1:12:15] temperance amen god wants you to be
[1:12:18] both a level in patience hallelujah
[1:12:22] now that well i signed my contract with
[1:12:23] a 1 000 pen one time i saw a preacher
[1:12:25] woman say that i'm like are you kidding
[1:12:26] me
[1:12:27] like that makes you that makes you going
[1:12:29] up a level yeah with satan
[1:12:31] you know like with greed god's levels
[1:12:34] are right there peter says add to your
[1:12:36] faith
[1:12:36] virtue add to that knowledge tempers
[1:12:39] patience godless brother kindness
[1:12:40] let's add those levels amen that's the
[1:12:43] kind of levels we're going up praise god
[1:12:46] hallelujah they're so deceived
[1:12:50] by the lust of the eyes and the lust of
[1:12:51] the flesh and the pride of life
[1:12:53] so satan has so deceived them at the end
[1:12:57] of paul's ministry by the nj
[1:12:58] how many coats did paul have one
[1:13:02] remember paul told timothy he said bring
[1:13:04] my coat from troas
[1:13:06] because he's in prison that man was such
[1:13:08] a man of god
[1:13:09] and yet the end of his life he only had
[1:13:11] one coat now i got right now i counted a
[1:13:13] few weeks ago
[1:13:14] i have like 10 suits we're a blessed
[1:13:17] people
[1:13:18] but paul had one coat
[1:13:21] so see how much we have doesn't mean how
[1:13:23] close we are to god
[1:13:25] what we have naturally amen it's what we
[1:13:28] have
[1:13:29] character wise by the character of
[1:13:31] christ how much we live like christ and
[1:13:34] obey christ
[1:13:35] and keep all his commands amen
[1:13:40] that's what counts that's the levels
[1:13:42] church we need to go up but look at
[1:13:43] verse 9.
[1:13:44] if we don't add those levels to our
[1:13:47] lives
[1:13:48] but he that lack at these things is
[1:13:50] blind
[1:13:52] cannot see far off and hath forgotten
[1:13:56] that he was purged from his old sins
[1:13:59] see if you don't add god's nature you're
[1:14:02] adding
[1:14:03] worldly ideas satan's nature and then
[1:14:06] you forget about the cross
[1:14:08] you forget about the blood you forget
[1:14:10] about your foundation
[1:14:12] because faith is faith in what faith in
[1:14:14] the blood paul said in romans 5.
[1:14:16] he said our faith is in the blood of
[1:14:18] jesus christ if you don't constantly add
[1:14:20] to your character
[1:14:22] go up a level in the anointing of god
[1:14:24] you'll forget where you came from
[1:14:26] and that's why joshua was always told by
[1:14:28] god set up a memorial
[1:14:30] remember this day remember what god did
[1:14:32] you're going to need to remember it
[1:14:34] praise god
[1:14:35] because if not you'll forget that god is
[1:14:37] with you church god is not out there
[1:14:39] god is right in here praise god amen
[1:14:42] he's in you
[1:14:43] but all says anointing is out here to

[1:22:56] hallelujah
[1:23:01] it's actually quite simple to get the
[1:23:02] church stirred back up again just remind
[1:23:04] them of what god has done

[1:23:11] you remember that i can still picture it
[1:23:14] i'll never forget that praise god you

[1:23:23] i understand the word
[1:23:25] the temperance of god oh i remember when
[1:23:26] i got victory over those bodily passions
[1:23:29] i remember when god delivered me from
[1:23:30] those addictions and so you got
[1:23:32] temperance
[1:23:33] i remember what he did well how did i
[1:23:35] get there my heart
[1:23:36] doesn't condemn me right i was in a
[1:23:38] condition where my heart didn't condemn
[1:23:39] me
[1:23:40] i confess my sin well let me confess my
[1:23:42] sin now and that will get me back to my
[1:23:44] first love
[1:23:46] oh hallelujah it's not rocket science
[1:23:48] right it's just a bible truth where
[1:23:50] praise god
[1:23:52] some simple truth okay
[1:23:55] now give me about a little bit more time
[1:23:56] here like i said i look at the names of
[1:23:58] god tonight but i want to
[1:24:00] i just want to lay some of these in okay
[1:24:01] joshua said we only got to the text
[1:24:02] because i want the background
[1:24:04] on a few of those thoughts
[1:24:11] yes sir we're overcomer saints we're
[1:24:13] overcomers
[1:24:15] and we must remember what god has done
[1:24:18] never forget how the blood of jesus
[1:24:19] christ wash you from your sins
[1:24:22] because if you ever forget that that
[1:24:24] proves you're not adding
[1:24:26] more anointing to your life you must the
[1:24:28] bible said
[1:24:29] everyone has a measure of faith right
[1:24:32] romans 12.
[1:24:34] everyone has a portion of faith but then
[1:24:36] god wants to give you a portion of
[1:24:38] virtue
[1:24:38] knowledge he wants to delay all these
[1:24:40] portions pretty soon you got a pretty
[1:24:41] good portion
[1:24:43] right eight he got seven portions of
[1:24:45] something up pretty soon that's pretty
[1:24:46] good i mean
[1:24:47] now you got a full port now you're
[1:24:48] filled with the holy ghost praise god
[1:24:51] and that's the real question right there
[1:24:54] now
[1:24:55] let's look here just let's take a few
[1:24:56] thoughts on uh aiken you're very
[1:24:58] familiar with him
[1:25:02] aiken we read verse one so remember
[1:25:05] god had already told them if you touch
[1:25:08] something cursed
[1:25:09] you're gonna be cursed so ache in other
[1:25:12] words he knew the word
[1:25:14] but what do you commit iniquity remember
[1:25:15] we talked about that iniquity is when
[1:25:17] you purposely do lawlessness
[1:25:20] right so aiken is example of iniquity
[1:25:23] he know what's he knew what was right
[1:25:24] but he did wrong anyway
[1:25:27] and remember he's from the tribe of
[1:25:29] praise right he was a praised man
[1:25:33] i'm a praise man i love the praise but
[1:25:35] i'm gonna take the curse thing
[1:25:37] praise god jesus was from the tribe of
[1:25:40] judah too
[1:25:42] hallelujah praise god he's a praise man
[1:25:44] he really worshiped
[1:25:46] just like satan right satan was a leader
[1:25:47] in worship
[1:25:49] and joshua verse 2 sent men from jericho
[1:25:51] to ai now i'm going to skip some of
[1:25:53] these he said go up and view the country
[1:25:55] the country now they return
[1:25:58] and in verse three the men say oh we
[1:26:00] only need two or three thousand to
[1:26:02] defeat ai
[1:26:04] so in verse four they sent up three
[1:26:05] thousand and they fled
[1:26:08] verse 5 36 men died look there's 12
[1:26:11] tribes right 10 12
[1:26:12] 12 times 3 36 so three men from each
[1:26:15] tribe died
[1:26:16] god was giving a warning to the entire
[1:26:18] group
[1:26:20] warning warning something's wrong
[1:26:23] something's wrong
[1:26:24] the church what does joshua do verse 6
[1:26:26] he rent his clothes
[1:26:28] actually you know before that verse 5
[1:26:31] the bible said at the end of the verse
[1:26:33] the hearts of the people
[1:26:34] melted as became as water do you ever
[1:26:37] feel like that like your emotions
[1:26:38] you ever feel like your motion just
[1:26:39] dropped to the bottom of your stomach
[1:26:42] every time i think zion's going to fall
[1:26:43] down the stairs that happens
[1:26:45] like he's climbing by the stairs and
[1:26:47] he'll fall and somebody will catch him
[1:26:49] i'll say thank god
[1:26:50] thank you jesus you protected my son
[1:26:52] from falling down the stairs you know
[1:26:54] they like to play on the stairs well the
[1:26:57] bible said when they heard they lost the
[1:26:58] battle
[1:26:59] their hearts melted and ran like water
[1:27:02] so it's like their their stomachs hit
[1:27:04] the floor
[1:27:06] the church did you notice this did
[1:27:09] joshua
[1:27:10] ever see god about this first
[1:27:15] that's why i love that quote brother
[1:27:16] adam said he said read your bible every
[1:27:19] day
[1:27:20] he said pray every day he said before
[1:27:22] you make any decision say lord
[1:27:25] what would you have me to do about this
[1:27:29] did joshua seek god before going down
[1:27:31] the ai
[1:27:33] it was his own desire now church did he
[1:27:36] have a scripture
[1:27:37] yes the scripture said wherever you put
[1:27:39] your feet you'll get it
[1:27:41] right so do we all things are possible
[1:27:45] to them that believe jesus
[1:27:46] said right all things every we've
[1:27:49] been blessed with all spiritual
[1:27:50] blessings in christ jesus ephesians
[1:27:51] chapter one verse four
[1:27:53] we have all these blessings but there's
[1:27:54] conditions
[1:27:56] that go along with these promises
[1:27:59] and joshua forgot to seek god before the
[1:28:02] next battle
[1:28:04] he just let the men it's kind of like
[1:28:05] david right he kind of let the men kind
[1:28:07] of talking
[1:28:08] what do you think can we do this what
[1:28:11] how many do you think we should send
[1:28:12] see it was a council of men right
[1:28:15] men's ideas and what does it lead to
[1:28:19] death 36
[1:28:23] men died now church that's what i always
[1:28:25] want to do i want to
[1:28:26] it's okay to have thoughts church it's
[1:28:27] okay to even have godly thoughts right
[1:28:30] but we want to pray before we do
[1:28:32] anything
[1:28:34] now you know i preached this before but
[1:28:36] every time the bible said david inquired
[1:28:39] of the lord
[1:28:40] he whipped the enemy every time
[1:28:44] he just had to go ask you know either
[1:28:46] the urem thumb him or he had to go pray
[1:28:48] with himself every time he said god
[1:28:50] should i do this he got the victory
[1:28:53] the only times he lost was when he
[1:28:54] didn't do that
[1:28:56] like with uriah right and bathsheba
[1:29:00] and then the bible said the sword of the
[1:29:03] sword never left this house
[1:29:04] because of that iniquity that he did but
[1:29:07] every time he got down church every time
[1:29:09] we get down on our knees say god
[1:29:11] it looks like i should do this but i
[1:29:13] just want to take a little time and say
[1:29:14] lord
[1:29:15] should i do this may we humble ourselves
[1:29:18] to be like that
[1:29:19] we probably figure well yeah lord you
[1:29:21] probably want to heal brother so-and-so
[1:29:22] or sister so-and-so or yeah you probably
[1:29:24] want me to go preach with lord
[1:29:26] just out of respect amen just out of my
[1:29:29] respect for you
[1:29:30] just out of my humility i want to ask
[1:29:32] you about it first
[1:29:37] i'm not just going to assume we're going
[1:29:39] to get the victory
[1:29:40] i'm going to make sure i pray before i
[1:29:42] go into this battle
[1:29:44] church anytime you have a meeting with
[1:29:46] somebody with an important subject or a
[1:29:47] phone call
[1:29:48] something important pray every time
[1:29:51] pray every time because you never know
[1:29:54] what's going to happen
[1:29:55] people may have ambushed you right
[1:29:57] that's what we'll get through later
[1:29:58] that's how
[1:29:58] actually joshua gets the victory over ai
[1:30:00] he sets up an ambush but satan does
[1:30:02] ambushes too
[1:30:04] right
[1:30:07] so look at this all their emotions run
[1:30:11] down like water
[1:30:14] is that clock right okay
[1:30:18] felt like everything was running out
[1:30:21] what is gonna happen
[1:30:23] and look at verse six and joshua ran his
[1:30:24] clothes and fell to the earth on his
[1:30:26] face before the ark of the lord
[1:30:27] until the event tied so he spent hours
[1:30:30] crying unto the lord hours
[1:30:36] until they even died he and the elders
[1:30:37] of israel put dust on their heads and
[1:30:39] joshua said now look at this prayer
[1:30:40] church
[1:30:41] alas oh lord god wherefore hast thou
[1:30:45] at all brought this people over jordan
[1:30:47] deliver us in the hand of our amorites
[1:30:48] to destroy us
[1:30:49] would to god we had been content and
[1:30:52] dwelt on the other side of jordan
[1:30:54] he's now doubting the very promises
[1:30:59] god had done for him he's doubting
[1:31:01] everything god had done well maybe it
[1:31:02] wasn't god's will for me to cross
[1:31:04] jordan maybe it wasn't god's will to
[1:31:06] circumcise those men
[1:31:07] maybe it wasn't god's will to go up to
[1:31:09] gilgal maybe it wasn't god's will to do
[1:31:11] jericho
[1:31:13] see church our mistakes or our trials
[1:31:16] are are sent to show us what's still
[1:31:18] left in our hearts
[1:31:21] your battles and your trials many times
[1:31:24] is god letting you look in the mirror to
[1:31:26] see what's in your heart
[1:31:28] what are you going to say when you get
[1:31:29] sick right what are you going to say
[1:31:32] when you
[1:31:32] fail can you see that
[1:31:37] this is one of the this is one of the
[1:31:39] worst uh
[1:31:40] attributes of joshua's character that we
[1:31:42] see through the whole bible
[1:31:44] most of the time he's like warrior
[1:31:46] brother man said he was the greatest
[1:31:47] general there ever was
[1:31:49] amen because he represented jesus amen
[1:31:53] but here we get a look into joshua at
[1:31:55] one of his worst moments
[1:31:57] god why did you why didn't you just let
[1:32:00] us stay on the other side
[1:32:01] why didn't you let me stay in
[1:32:02] sanctification
[1:32:06] is that right why didn't you let me stay
[1:32:10] out there in the wilderness where
[1:32:11] i miss that angel food that light bread
[1:32:15] was it your will even to bring me over
[1:32:17] this this old corn of the land
[1:32:19] and the good things of god was this even
[1:32:21] your will did i miss you somehow
[1:32:23] and what is he doing he's kind of
[1:32:24] accusing god of doing wrong
[1:32:29] would to god we should have been content
[1:32:31] would to god
[1:32:32] we should have been content and dwelt on
[1:32:34] the other side of jordan see church
[1:32:36] every man as powerful anointing as you
[1:32:39] have
[1:32:39] you're still a man you're still a woman
[1:32:44] is that right this man had walked
[1:32:46] through a river brother mj
[1:32:48] he'd walked through a river they'd
[1:32:50] conquered the greatest city there ever
[1:32:52] was right there in the canyons
[1:32:54] he'd seen he'd seen the walls fall flat
[1:32:56] down and then he climbed over the walls
[1:32:59] and slew and saw this great victory and
[1:33:02] there now he's like well should we have
[1:33:03] even
[1:33:04] done this of course you should have
[1:33:07] that's what god would have said
[1:33:10] that's what god does say
[1:33:14] like if i have one mistake as a pastor
[1:33:15] lord i men i gave the person the wrong
[1:33:17] advice
[1:33:18] are you sure you call me the pastor are
[1:33:20] you sure you called me to preach
[1:33:22] are you sure you anointed me to do this
[1:33:26] of course he did every person make
[1:33:28] mistakes
[1:33:30] but man said the best part that joshua
[1:33:32] had was when god said
[1:33:33] as i was with moses so i'll be with you
[1:33:37] and moses made mistakes
[1:33:39] but god never left him because god
[1:33:41] honored his position praise god
[1:33:44] god honored the commission that moses
[1:33:46] had and that's how it is with us
[1:33:48] we may make mistakes but god will honor
[1:33:50] us god will bring us back to humility
[1:33:53] god has called us for a purpose we just
[1:33:55] must press on
[1:33:56] for getting those things that are in the
[1:33:58] past pressing on towards the high
[1:34:00] calling
[1:34:01] in christ jesus
[1:34:04] press on make right what's been made
[1:34:07] wrong
[1:34:08] make right and press on don't give up
[1:34:12] don't doubt what god has done in your
[1:34:16] life we should have stayed on the other
[1:34:19] side
[1:34:19] we should have just stayed with the
[1:34:21] methodists
[1:34:24] we should have just stayed at the
[1:34:25] baptist church
[1:34:27] can you imagine that we should have
[1:34:28] stayed at the cma sister
[1:34:32] i should have stayed at the presbyterian
[1:34:34] where i was
[1:34:35] why do i why did i come over here
[1:34:37] believe it i could kill giants
[1:34:39] because you can't because you've already
[1:34:42] seen them fall
[1:34:44] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:34:46] lord
[1:34:47] get that filth out of your life and then
[1:34:50] watch god
[1:34:51] move amen
[1:34:54] get that hidden sin out of your life and
[1:34:56] then watch the almighty move
[1:35:00] either move out there church or listen
[1:35:02] or he'll move in here
[1:35:06] right he'll either move one or the other
[1:35:08] in other words your attitude will either
[1:35:09] be moved to change i can deal with this
[1:35:11] or god will remove that obstacle out of
[1:35:14] your life
[1:35:15] one or the other
[1:35:20] many wrongs of joshua but i'm glad we do
[1:35:24] because of his love right god's love
[1:35:29] many times that shows god how god is
[1:35:31] showing you how much he loves you by
[1:35:33] correcting you
[1:35:35] satan just wants you to stay in your
[1:35:37] your guilt right
[1:35:38] he wants us you just isolated
[1:35:41] just don't come to church just stay away
[1:35:44] you're a loser
[1:35:45] there's nothing good in you but god
[1:35:47] wants to say just correct what's wrong
[1:35:49] and march on you're gonna get the
[1:35:52] victory they were just like a couple
[1:35:54] days away
[1:35:54] they were so close i mean they were so
[1:35:56] close to victory all they had to do was
[1:35:58] just
[1:35:59] just keep marching on clean out
[1:36:00] everything in our life keep marching on
[1:36:03] all these enemies will fall before you
[1:36:05] no man will stand before you
[1:36:07] all the days of your life amen that's
[1:36:10] what i saw last year brother william
[1:36:12] i had different men standing before me
[1:36:14] you know through emails and
[1:36:15] everything like that joseph branham
[1:36:17] billy paul brandon rod bergen from
[1:36:19] believe the sign
[1:36:20] last year i realized there's no man that
[1:36:21] can stand before me praise god
[1:36:25] see they're trying to bring down my
[1:36:27] faith in christ
[1:36:29] make me worship brother branham or make
[1:36:30] me doubt brother branham brother
[1:36:31] braham's a man
[1:36:33] my faith is in william branham my faith
[1:36:35] is in jesus christ
[1:36:37] if i got jesus christ i can rightly
[1:36:38] divide the word of truth
[1:36:40] i can tell who's telling the truth and
[1:36:42] who's not amen
[1:36:44] praise god you know the bible said the
[1:36:46] word is of no private interpretation
[1:36:48] but then paul tells timothy you rightly
[1:36:51] divide
[1:36:52] truth amen so in other words you're
[1:36:55] rightly dividing will be the
[1:36:57] interpretation of the holy ghost amen
[1:37:01] hallelujah i know a prophet interprets
[1:37:04] the word but then there's other
[1:37:05] questions the prophet can't do
[1:37:06] everything
[1:37:08] so that's why paul told timothy you need
[1:37:10] to still rightly divide the word of
[1:37:12] truth
[1:37:12] because satan's going to bring in more
[1:37:14] attacks but if you just stand with the
[1:37:16] holy ghost
[1:37:16] then no man as long as the captain's
[1:37:19] standing with you
[1:37:20] no man will stand before you all the
[1:37:22] days of your life amen
[1:37:23] hallelujah and brother
[1:37:26] william i asked for a meeting face to
[1:37:28] face they don't want it i asked for a
[1:37:30] phone call
[1:37:30] they don't want it but i like it that's
[1:37:33] right
[1:37:34] that's because they know they can't
[1:37:35] answer they're like the man that has no
[1:37:37] words right
[1:37:38] he comes in where's your garment
[1:37:41] i thought brother adam said billy paul
[1:37:43] was the promised joseph in 1951
[1:37:46] brother said the third person the
[1:37:48] trinity burns in our hearts in 1952.
[1:37:51] i don't know if it's about it but see we
[1:37:52] can rightly divide it we know what's
[1:37:54] true
[1:37:55] because the spirit is our comforter
[1:37:56] praise god and he shows us things that
[1:37:59] come amen
[1:38:00] hallelujah
[1:38:05] i believe that with all my heart we must
[1:38:08] rightly divide the word
[1:38:09] the private interpretation comes from
[1:38:11] the holy ghost and i'll say this it
[1:38:12] comes privately
[1:38:15] it comes in the prayer closet because
[1:38:16] paul said study yourself approve
[1:38:19] unto god see you study with god and god
[1:38:23] shows you the revelation
[1:38:24] and you preaching to god's people amen
[1:38:27] hallelujah
[1:38:29] then you stand there like a statue amen
[1:38:32] on the word of god and no man or woman
[1:38:34] can stand before you all the days of
[1:38:35] your life
[1:38:37] that's what i found out last year we're
[1:38:40] the joshuas
[1:38:41] nobody can stand before us and chop us
[1:38:44] down chop our faith down and try to
[1:38:45] discourage us
[1:38:46] no no no no we're more than conquerors
[1:38:50] in christ jesus
[1:38:51] amen hallelujah
[1:39:01] so we see joshua's worst parts
[1:39:05] did god say joshua i'm done with you
[1:39:09] you didn't think i was going to bring
[1:39:10] you i should bring you guys over here in
[1:39:11] the problem i'm done with you joshua
[1:39:14] no god didn't god didn't give up on his
[1:39:15] servant god won't give up on you
[1:39:19] god's not giving up on you right
[1:39:22] if god is for you who can be against you
[1:39:27] the only trouble is we got against god
[1:39:29] sometimes right aching god against god
[1:39:32] we get against god when we do selfish
[1:39:34] things sometimes
[1:39:35] or we blow up our temper explodes on
[1:39:38] somebody
[1:39:39] or we say the wrong thing or we
[1:39:40] disrespect the name of god
[1:39:44] all right we're all guilty at times god
[1:39:46] have mercy on us forgive us
[1:39:48] but see god is for us right
[1:39:51] he'll never leave us never forsake us
[1:39:54] josh says we should have stayed in the
[1:39:55] same vacation we should have stayed in
[1:39:58] denomination
[1:39:59] i said brother ram said moses
[1:40:00] represented denominations that's what
[1:40:01] brother ram said
[1:40:03] the old law the old way we should have
[1:40:05] stayed out there in the wilderness
[1:40:11] oh lord verse 8 what shall i say when
[1:40:13] israel turned at their backs
[1:40:14] before their enemies well you're going
[1:40:15] to say a lot of bad things right when
[1:40:18] you lose victories
[1:40:19] when things start going bad if you're
[1:40:20] not careful you're going to say a lot of
[1:40:21] bad things
[1:40:23] you start doubting if you're saved
[1:40:25] doubting if you're filled with the holy
[1:40:26] ghost doubting if you do anything right
[1:40:27] in life
[1:40:28] satan is such an accuser by loving jesus
[1:40:32] said get behind me
[1:40:33] satan in other words get your lies out
[1:40:36] of my face
[1:40:38] praise god get behind me i'm moving
[1:40:40] forward
[1:40:41] you get out of my way i'm marching
[1:40:43] forward in jesus name
[1:40:45] get your lies and your bluffs out of my
[1:40:48] face because i don't want to talk about
[1:40:49] it i don't want to hear
[1:40:50] get behind me he told those demons in
[1:40:52] legion go
[1:40:54] he just said go and satan had to move
[1:40:57] let's speak the name of jesus and the
[1:40:59] name of jesus will move mountains praise
[1:41:01] god
[1:41:02] amen
[1:41:08] verse 9 for the canaanites and all the
[1:41:11] inhabitants of the land shall hear of it
[1:41:13] and shall environ us around and cut off
[1:41:15] our name from the earth what without
[1:41:16] doing to thy great name
[1:41:18] god what are you going to do everybody's
[1:41:19] going to hear about my mistake
[1:41:20] everyone's going to
[1:41:21] hear about our mistakes verse 10 and the
[1:41:24] lord that's capital l-o-r-d
[1:41:27] that's jehovah which is the
[1:41:31] which is the uh it's the
[1:41:34] pseudo name for yahweh because yahweh is
[1:41:36] the most
[1:41:37] holy name of god so they wanted to
[1:41:40] protect yahweh so they made a a kind
[1:41:42] like a name a nickname to cover that
[1:41:44] we'll just call him jehovah so this is
[1:41:47] jehovah and jehovah means
[1:41:49] the self-existent one who reveals
[1:41:51] himself
[1:41:54] so here is the self-existence is this
[1:41:57] the one who reveals himself
[1:41:58] revealing himself to joshua joshua
[1:42:01] thinks why did i even come over here
[1:42:03] what
[1:42:04] what have we done we're just going to be
[1:42:05] defeated everybody's going to think
[1:42:06] we're
[1:42:07] oh we wasted our time and the revealing
[1:42:10] one reveals
[1:42:11] joshua get up
[1:42:15] stand come on church don't lay down
[1:42:18] there
[1:42:19] stand in the promise of god
[1:42:22] stop complaining down there on your face
[1:42:24] or or thinking oh
[1:42:25] stop walling around in the muck stand up
[1:42:28] and get ready to fight
[1:42:30] man the self-existent one who reveals
[1:42:34] himself
[1:42:35] reveals it's not my will that you lay
[1:42:37] there
[1:42:38] and complain about what's going on
[1:42:43] says so
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:46] defeat me because i feed myself the
[1:42:48] wrong things
[1:42:53] i need the plans i need i only exist
[1:42:55] it'll be their job
[1:42:57] i don't exist on my own but god exists
[1:43:00] on his own
[1:43:01] he don't need anything and the one who
[1:43:03] says i don't need anything
[1:43:04] says get up
[1:43:08] why are you lying on your face
[1:43:11] so he spends all these hours how many
[1:43:13] hours do we waste worrying about things
[1:43:16] he said all these hours word on facebook
[1:43:18] said get up why are you laying there
[1:43:19] like that
[1:43:21] you're a general the captain's with you
[1:43:26] you've already defeated jericho you've
[1:43:28] already come to a river
[1:43:30] you're and you already crossed the red
[1:43:32] sea
[1:43:34] why would you lie there remember when
[1:43:36] i'm done amen
[1:43:38] remember who i am remember whose side
[1:43:40] you're on break god
[1:43:43] don't lie there complaining
[1:43:48] this is just what israel did before they
[1:43:49] just complained all the time god said
[1:43:51] you're not coming in
[1:43:52] here he is complaining god said don't
[1:43:53] complain
[1:43:55] get up
[1:43:58] israel has sinned
[1:44:03] and they have also transgressed my
[1:44:05] covenant so see
[1:44:06] there's conditions every promise
[1:44:10] just like the brown bear brother ram
[1:44:12] didn't meet the conditions
[1:44:13] but the brown bear is still there you
[1:44:16] got to meet the conditions of the word
[1:44:19] praise god it was done saith the lord if
[1:44:22] you meet the conditions
[1:44:24] praise god does not say the lord i can
[1:44:28] defeat ai i can defeat jericho
[1:44:30] i can defeat every enemy as long as i
[1:44:32] keep the word of god
[1:44:33] if if i keep the word of god
[1:44:36] i can be healed if i obey the word
[1:44:41] i can be i can uh be used by god for
[1:44:43] miracles if i obey the word of god
[1:44:46] praise god i can overcome this addiction
[1:44:49] if i obey the word of god
[1:44:50] oh that great word if it's so small but
[1:44:52] it's so great
[1:44:54] if you must meet the conditions see
[1:44:57] you've sinned you've transgressed my
[1:44:58] covenant
[1:45:01] for they have even taken of the accursed
[1:45:03] thing and have also stolen
[1:45:05] and dissembled also and they have put it
[1:45:07] even among
[1:45:08] their own stuff therefore the children
[1:45:11] of israel could not stand before their
[1:45:12] enemies
[1:45:13] but turn their acts before their enemies
[1:45:15] because they were cursed
[1:45:16] neither will i be with you anymore
[1:45:18] except you destroy the accursed thing
[1:45:20] from among you
[1:45:21] wow so what's like one strike and there
[1:45:24] goes the anointing
[1:45:26] isn't that what it's like for us too we
[1:45:28] can be walking obedience one little bad
[1:45:30] joke
[1:45:31] one little gossip
[1:45:34] one little bad video one little bad text
[1:45:38] right there goes the anointing where
[1:45:41] up here not here this one cannot sin
[1:45:44] right
[1:45:45] he said john said you have a seed that
[1:45:47] cannot sin
[1:45:48] and then he says earlier he said he said
[1:45:50] any man that says he don't sin is a liar
[1:45:52] but then he says you've got a seed that
[1:45:53] cannot sin so your soul doesn't send but
[1:45:56] this guy appears sins
[1:46:01] that's why the bible said grieve not the
[1:46:02] holy spirit of god offend not the holy
[1:46:04] spirit of god
[1:46:05] whereby you're sealed even to the day of
[1:46:08] your redemption
[1:46:10] but just as quickly as it leaves church
[1:46:12] it can quickly come back amen
[1:46:14] hallelujah he said you aren't going to
[1:46:17] one more victory until you get this sin
[1:46:20] out of the camp
[1:46:22] that's why churches don't go on to
[1:46:23] victories that's many times why they're
[1:46:25] sick don't get healed
[1:46:26] because they still got sin laying there
[1:46:28] amongst the church i've always prayed
[1:46:30] this and i'm going to keep praying this
[1:46:31] lord if there's any sin in our church
[1:46:32] either help them confess or send them
[1:46:34] out of our church
[1:46:36] because i don't want to be a church that
[1:46:38] stays behind and gets no victories
[1:46:40] i want to be a church that marches
[1:46:42] forward and possesses the promises of
[1:46:44] god
[1:46:46] our finances go down big deal as long as
[1:46:48] i got jesus
[1:46:50] praise god as long as jesus is here
[1:46:52] that's the most important thing
[1:46:54] right that's the most important thing we
[1:46:56] just want jesus christ here
[1:46:58] we want him magnified we want to be
[1:47:00] overcomers we want to see the power of
[1:47:02] god
[1:47:03] we want to be faithful and we want to
[1:47:04] see him back up his covenant
[1:47:07] amen the new covenant the new covenant
[1:47:10] the new testament in my blood amen may
[1:47:13] the blood of christ always clean out our
[1:47:15] church amen
[1:47:17] that's right sin breaks the covenant
[1:47:20] power of victory
[1:47:24] they didn't ask god about it they had
[1:47:26] self-confidence
[1:47:28] oh we'll just go down to ai no problem
[1:47:33] i'll just easily overcome this person
[1:47:34] i'll just go rebuke them real quick you
[1:47:36] know
[1:47:38] and then they'll have something ready
[1:47:39] for you to rebuke you
[1:47:41] make you look bad make you look selfish
[1:47:44] because your pride
[1:47:46] i'll just easily go take care of this
[1:47:47] that's no problem
[1:47:49] no pray before you go pray before you
[1:47:52] make a decision
[1:47:56] see ai exposes joshua's attitude just
[1:47:58] like
[1:47:59] job's trials exposed his wrong attitudes
[1:48:04] i preach on that at the beginning of the
[1:48:05] year brother william i was so amazed i
[1:48:07] never seen all of job's faults
[1:48:09] he had so many good things but he also
[1:48:11] had so many bad things
[1:48:15] he was overcome with fear he said i was
[1:48:18] at ease he was laodicean
[1:48:20] at ease and there were so many other
[1:48:23] ones
[1:48:24] oh he thought he was equal with god he's
[1:48:27] like i'm righteous and god's unrighteous
[1:48:28] the bible actually says that
[1:48:30] he thought he was right and he thought
[1:48:32] god was wrong now that's big time pride
[1:48:34] right there
[1:48:36] but did god was god with him still did
[1:48:38] god forgive him absolutely
[1:48:39] after a great rebuke see
[1:48:43] our trials are testing us and they're
[1:48:45] showing us what's inside of us
[1:48:51] now you know the story i'll just hit a
[1:48:53] few highlights
[1:48:54] no more victories unless you get this
[1:48:56] sin out of your life
[1:48:58] that's why that's why brother brown says
[1:49:00] wherever you leave god you gotta go
[1:49:01] right back there
[1:49:03] gotta go right back there
[1:49:09] then joshua says up and i'm sorry god
[1:49:11] says in verse 13 up sanctify the people
[1:49:13] sanctify yourselves against tomorrow
[1:49:14] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:49:16] there is an accursed thing in the midst
[1:49:18] of the o israel thou canst not stand
[1:49:19] before thine enemies until they take
[1:49:21] away the cursing
[1:49:22] from among you now we know he brings the
[1:49:26] family of judah
[1:49:27] and then uh achan comes look at verse
[1:49:31] 20. and they can answer joshua said
[1:49:33] indeed i have sinned against the lord
[1:49:35] god of israel and thus and thus have i
[1:49:37] done when i saw look at what what got
[1:49:39] him the
[1:49:39] lust of the eyes he saw these things
[1:49:43] the spoils of a goodly babylonish
[1:49:46] garment
[1:49:47] and 200 shackles of silver and a wedge
[1:49:50] of gold
[1:49:51] of 50 shackles away and i covered them
[1:49:53] and took them so
[1:49:54] close coins and then a wedge of gold
[1:49:58] those three clothes is that worth it
[1:50:02] would that be worth it
[1:50:04] remember god said everything in
[1:50:06] jericho's mine
[1:50:08] he said but all the other places you can
[1:50:10] spoil all that but not this first one
[1:50:13] this was all mine so see aiken was doing
[1:50:16] the same thing
[1:50:17] that eli sons did they took god's fat
[1:50:20] god's portion
[1:50:21] no the fat was for god but eli and his
[1:50:23] sons are like no no we'll eat that
[1:50:24] that's ours and the people got them said
[1:50:26] like that's god's part you can't take
[1:50:27] god's part and what happened to those
[1:50:28] two boys they got killed
[1:50:30] just like aiken got killed so you never
[1:50:33] take god's part you don't take god's
[1:50:34] glory
[1:50:36] right you don't take credit for anything
[1:50:37] i was just the tool he i was just the
[1:50:39] glove he put his hand
[1:50:40] in the glove has no power of its own
[1:50:43] praise god
[1:50:44] i have no power of my own like jesus
[1:50:45] said the son can do nothing of himself
[1:50:47] but he doeth that which the father
[1:50:49] showeth him amen
[1:50:50] and that's what we do we do what the
[1:50:52] father shows us or puts in our hearts
[1:50:54] it's all glory to god amen
[1:50:58] we're the i'm sorry he's the potter
[1:51:00] we're the clay
[1:51:02] i'm just the clay see he saw it just
[1:51:05] like
[1:51:06] uh just like those sons of eli
[1:51:09] they saw something that was good that
[1:51:11] was god's and they took that to
[1:51:13] themselves
[1:51:14] and all three died
[1:51:20] it's important church that we watch our
[1:51:22] attitudes how many want to watch your
[1:51:23] attitude praise god
[1:51:25] bye so joshua didn't need that how many
[1:51:28] hour long prayer meeting
[1:51:30] which it wasn't much of a prayer
[1:51:33] he just needed to get the sin out of the
[1:51:34] camp
[1:51:36] right and may god give us grace when
[1:51:39] we've done wrong
[1:51:40] that we can just go get the sin out of
[1:51:41] our lives and get back to god
[1:51:43] right just get back to being right with
[1:51:46] god
[1:51:48] see aiken is just like
[1:51:52] ananias and sapphira in the new
[1:51:54] testament
[1:51:57] right what's the first battle that the
[1:51:58] saints have
[1:52:00] ananias and sapphira lying to god
[1:52:05] see they're freshly filled with the holy
[1:52:07] ghost they freshly crossed over jordan
[1:52:10] and they come to this first example
[1:52:12] where these oh i'm going to sell some of
[1:52:13] my land and give it so everybody's not
[1:52:15] poor and everybody can have something in
[1:52:16] the church
[1:52:17] and then and i send the fire come by and
[1:52:19] they lie and say well we sold it for
[1:52:20] this and that
[1:52:21] and peter said because you lied to the
[1:52:23] holy ghost these men are going to pack
[1:52:25] you out of here
[1:52:26] and he died right there right after
[1:52:28] freshly being a brand new church
[1:52:30] just after coming over jordan right
[1:52:32] crossing over jordan
[1:52:34] in the spiritual promised land
[1:52:38] so see how god deals with this church
[1:52:39] see how god he's so
[1:52:41] interested in our constant honesty
[1:52:45] he's interested in all the words we say
[1:52:47] remember the bible said all
[1:52:48] idol words will be judged then the only
[1:52:51] way to do that is to say
[1:52:53] lord i'm sorry for my idol words and
[1:52:54] then you won't be judged
[1:52:56] right because we all i we all uh utter
[1:52:59] idol words
[1:53:01] the only way to get rid of those is say
[1:53:02] jesus forgive me forgive me for saying
[1:53:04] such foolish things god forgive me
[1:53:06] and help me to say uh words season with
[1:53:09] grace next time
[1:53:12] let me not be a tail bearer tattletailer
[1:53:14] complainer
[1:53:15] prideful boaster let me not be a reviler
[1:53:18] god forgive me
[1:53:19] help me to speak the truth in love
[1:53:22] that don't cause someone to stumble in
[1:53:24] the church
[1:53:29] praise god
[1:53:34] now we know what happened look all this
[1:53:35] over some clothes
[1:53:37] some change and a and a big hunk of
[1:53:41] uh income for the futures a savings
[1:53:43] account we'd say
[1:53:45] he just did it all for some spending
[1:53:46] money with the shekels
[1:53:48] and this this long-term investment well
[1:53:50] here's my
[1:53:51] here's my retirement savings right here
[1:53:53] this big wedge of gone
[1:53:55] brother william they do the same thing
[1:53:56] today they sell out the message for a
[1:53:58] retirement fund
[1:54:01] fans are looking close better better
[1:54:03] looking church
[1:54:05] a little bit of extra spending money
[1:54:06] they sell out the word of god
[1:54:09] for these temporary things that don't
[1:54:11] mean nothing
[1:54:13] what is your babylonian garment what's
[1:54:15] your fancy clothes going to do on the
[1:54:16] day of judgment
[1:54:17] nothing they won't be there what's your
[1:54:19] money going to get you on the day of
[1:54:20] judgment
[1:54:21] nothing unless they're you're getting
[1:54:22] blessings from giving it to help
[1:54:24] out people provide for your family right
[1:54:27] all those things
[1:54:30] this was all so temporary but because of
[1:54:33] his eyes he didn't have his eyes
[1:54:34] strained
[1:54:35] to the word of god and his ears right
[1:54:38] don't take anything don't take anything
[1:54:40] oh it's just i gotta have it
[1:54:42] and where'd he bury it in his house
[1:54:46] he buried it in his house
[1:54:50] and church that's a lot of things let me
[1:54:51] just close with this you can stop the
[1:54:54] livestream i'm just going to say a few
[1:54:55] things here god bless the livestreamers
[1:54:59] church
