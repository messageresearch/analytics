Lord Jesus that you'd prepare Havens heart Lord God as she approaches the waters of Baptism Lord we ask father that you'd bless her life and Buster abundantly Lord for her desire to follow you Lord Lord I'm reminded of that little recording Lord on Teddy's button and how the pastor said one of your lambs is coming home Lord father thank you for bringing another lamb home Lord little haven let her serve you Lord faithfully reverently all the days of her life in Jesus Christ II never said amen praise the Lord let's take our let's stay in a little bit here let's stand here let's go to Acts chapter 2 we'll just read one scripture and then we'll go through the Word of God we have you know such a smaller crowd I just thought it'd be okay just to teach on water baptism we've talked to Haven a lot about water baptism but not going over some of the scriptures so maybe Lydia can be right there nakisha you having your Bible handy and Malachi you can pulp the Scriptures so Haven can see those scriptures and understand it a little better but we're thankful let's read verse 41 acts 2:41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers amen may God has busing the reading of his word you may be seated there by God's grace okay so we just want to start with that scripture Acts to about those who gladly received the Word of God were baptized by the grace of the Lord I like to go to Romans chapter 6 and let's make sure girls that we can have Haven look at these scriptures Romans 6:4 let's go right there to Romans 6:4 and I want to show again how when someone is baptized it represents the old nature the selfish sinful nature we could even say the selfish will of a person is dying going under the water and then a new creature is raised with a new will to want to serve God so Romans 6 verse 4 but actually why don't we read when we start at verse 1 we'll just read through a few verses here thank you me okay first one what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound verse 2 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein so as a Christian we should be dead to sin we should not want to serve sin any more verse 3 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death so when someone's baptized they're baptized into Christ death right he went and died here and died with all of our sins upon him and was raised right and when we die it shows that we're dying like Christ we're dying and the old nature sinful nature dies and new nature raised so verse four therefore we are buried and that's why we don't sprinkle we're actually supposed to be fully immersed in water were buried in water with him by baptism into death so we have to die to ourselves that's what it represents that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life and recently we've heard Haven talk about how you know her older siblings have been baptized and they're going to heaven and now she wants to go to heaven as well and she wants to serve the Lord to it Haven many times we'll talk about praying for her friends who haven't been baptized and one day we said well Haven you could be baptized to it and that kind of turned on the light in her heart you know that all I haven't been baptized I I want to be baptized and I want to serve the Lord so that we're very thankful for and that kind of struck her heart that she needs to be baptized so we're thankful for that and the scripture says that we walk in the newness of life verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection so that's why we're all that's why we're buried in water it's just like when Jesus died he was resurrected same thing for us when we die to ourselves were raised to new resurrection and we're promised just like the Bible says here if we're planted we'll be raised right we have that promise if we're plants in the name of Jesus Christ we'll be raised in the name of Jesus Christ sohave Annette when I'll have that promise when she is baptized today by God's grace she'll have that promise if she was planted like Christ was planted she'll raise just like Christ was raised what a promise verse 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him so it also is a sign that we've died right that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin verse 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him so that's what our the deadness to our will we've got to crucify the flesh and say I don't want to live selfishly anymore I want to live for Jesus Christ I'm gonna give him my whole life and that's what it represents verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead Dyess no more death hath no more dominion over him amen for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God praise the Lord praise God all right and I want to go to the story of the the eunuch I believe it's in Acts chapter 8 Philip in the eunuch so it's Act chapter 8 verse 26 we'll just go through this story here I like haven to see this one as well x8 26 so Philip a course is at Samaria they're having a tremendous revival of evangelism with devils being cast out and people being healed and saved and baptized but then the Holy Spirit called Philip away from the revival after James and I'm sorry Peter and John got their God called him away to meet this eunuch here this Ethiopian eunuch so verse 26 and the angel Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that go down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia and eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his chair at red Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understand this now what thou readest verse 31 and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his Shearer so open he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or of some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached unto Him Jesus now let's pause right there keep your spot there let's go to Isaiah 53 let's go to and read that so Haven can hear this here Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53 [Music] first one is a 53 verse 1 Isaiah 53 verse 1 now we'll read a few in here and I just want Haven to see this and I'm looking I had a picture I want to show her I can find it yeah this is pretty good one okay so Malachi if you can pull this up here you can switch over now it's a kind of a graphic one but it's not too graphic okay so as we read Isaiah 53 Haven think about this in the Old Testament God had animals died for our sins well Isaiah 53 what the prot what the eunuch was reading said that there was gonna come another one who was gonna die for us so we wouldn't need animals anymore we would need a savior someone else to die for us and all of our sins were placed upon this lamb Jesus Jesus says the lamb right he's the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world so as we read this this is what Philip I'm sorry this is what the eunuch was reading he's like what does this mean and we're gonna see that all of Jesse's sins were put on Christ olive vein all of Kristen all of Haven sins were put on Christ and he died for your sins that you don't have to that we don't have to be punished he took the punishment so Isaiah 53 that's called us a substitution he took he took our place so we don't have to pay for our sins let's go to verse 2 isaiah 53:2 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is this spies and rejected a men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not so Jesus wasn't a beautiful man he wasn't a handsome man we'd say he wouldn't attract any attention from anybody and when he died everybody forsook him in one way or another we know John was there and Mary his mother was there but everybody forsook him for to some extent because their sins verse 4 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted came out I go back over to the picture here for Haven so he bore our griefs so all of our griefs all of our pain and Haven knows - and our children if we've ever lied you know that's our fault right that's a grief but we've done to God but Jesus if we've sinned if we've stolen if we've done anything evil if we've cursed our parents or recursed a friend or anybody any of our griefs he born he poor he paid the price for all of our sins I'm gonna see if I can zoom in ok yeah that's even better ok so he took the price Heat he paid the penalty for all of our sins verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was wounded for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed amen we already are healed so we need Haven Haven needs to know that because today's her day all of your sins Haven that you already did or were already or do in the future Jesus already took all of them all of our sins were put upon him the Bible said and then he already healed us by taking all of our sins and all of our punishment he already offers us healing if we just believe that he took our place just like that Lamb if Israel bullit all of all of Israel's sins were transferred to that lamb when they would lay hands on that lamb all their sins left and now they were clean and so it is with Jesus when we believe in Jesus and when you say today you're gonna say I believe Jesus Christ the Son of God and when you say that spiritually all your sins have transferred to God's lamb and now you're clean and now you don't have to worry about being lost you have to worry about anything because Christ has paid the price for your sins he was God's lamb verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we all left Jesus at some point right all of us we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all that's why I said earlier Malachi's sins sister Naomi sins my sins all of our sins were placed upon the Lord Jesus Christ God knew it and God put all of our sins upon Jesus Christ he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his mouth alright and that's what the the eunuch read there so let's go back to Acts chapter two maokai you can usually just leave it up there for now let's go back to Acts chapter two I'm sorry actually after eight where were you reading parmie look at verse 35 acts 8:35 now just go a little bit further I want to go too long you know but just wanna go a little bit further then we'll take her to the waters and baptism praise God X 8:35 then Philip opened his mouth and began to preach at the same Scripture and preached on em Jesus so I imagine or something like this Haven imagine Philip said now the one we just read about was God's lamb the Messiah has come this is speaking of God's Messiah he was gonna come and he was gonna take all their sin upon him and I imagine Philip said God sent the prophet Jesus of Nazareth he came to earth and God anointed him with holy Oh some power needed many signs and wonders but then at the end of his ministry he was to be offered as God's lamb and Jesus in Jerusalem was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities everybody left him everybody forsook him the Bible said but on him God laid the iniquity of us all and then he died for our sins and rose for our justification and now with His stripes we are healed and he might have said you know 40-day or I'm sorry yeah fifty days after Jesus raised from the dead the Holy Ghost came and now the power that was on Jesus is here for us that's why when we pray for the sick they recovered amen when we cast out evil spirits that's why they leave amen it's because the power that was on Jesus is on us today hallelujah and so the eunuch didn't know this so Philip preached to him Jesus out of this one scripture he might said you know eunuch you know Jesus died for all your sins he is the god of the Old Testament but this is his manifestation in our day he's the Living Word today he came and died and your sins unit can be forgiven if you believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah look at verse 36 and as they went on their way they came into a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what does hinder me to be baptized so is there anything that's keeping me from being baptized Philip remember all she had done and this is still the same day so in one day he didn't know Isaiah 53 month was the Messiah but God sent Philip out there one man to preach to him Christ that Christ is the Messiah of Isaiah 53 he looks at the water so does anything hinder me from being baptized and what does Philip say and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mast so hey for Haven and for everybody else that's all you need to be baptized you need to recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah who died for your sins he raised for justification and if you do believe he's God's lamb with all your heart you may be baptized amen and the Bible said and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God so that's always the first question I ask people when I baptized them do you believe Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God if they say yes then you just met the same requirements as the eunuch a memorable Gramps had God's not a respecter of persons if God honored the eunuchs faith because he believed Jesus Christ is the son of God he's got to honor havens fate today amen he's got to honor our faith if we come by the same faith under the same conditions verse 38 he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he baptized them notice into the water not sprinkling but actually went into the water and when they were come up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip and the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing so we expect Haman to feel rejoicing after today right because after after the eunuch was baptized he was rejoicing God is real God is with us god is my Savior God Jesus Christ is the Messiah amen that's what we expect by the grace of the Lord so does that make sense Haven is that God placed all of your sin on Jesus even before we were born the Bible said God loved us while we were yet sinners he died for us before we even loved him so that's what this day is all about this day is all about recognizing that Haven doesn't have to die anymore for her sins you don't have to pay for any of your sins because Jesus already paid for them I don't have to pay for my sins because Jesus already paid the price for them he was wounded for my sins he was chastened because so I could have peace and that's the same thing for you that's a beautiful story praise God he was hurt so I don't have to be praise the Lord and then he went to hell so I don't have to go to hell I can go to heaven because he made the way for me and if I'm buried with him if I'm planted with him I'll raise like him that's another promise we already read that from Romans chapter 6 so when you're planted today it's promise every seat that's planned to ever see that God plants will raise up and God will plant you in the faith and you'll raise one day by God's grace okay so I was gonna show a few of these four I wanted to Haven to see a few of these so Haven there's five baptisms I'm sorry yeah five baptisms in the book of Acts let's just read over those and then we'll be done we'll just we'll just close with that and in each case Haven they either say Jesus Christ i baptize you name of Jesus Christ or they say Lord Jesus i baptize you name of Lord Jesus or they say i baptize you name of the Lord or they say I baptized Lord Jesus or Lord and if you put all those together it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that's what God does God hides it and God put incomplete things in here to hide his truth from the eyes of the wise and prudent but he reveals it unto babes and that's what you have to do by the scripture because jesus said go ye therefore and baptize them in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost so the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost because all of God came and dwelt in one man named the Lord Jesus Christ okay so Malachi let's switch over now let's go through these and then we'll be done then we'll have a word of Prayer over Haven and then we'll head off to the waters of baptism by the grace of the Lord you know I had I have it I just sermon ready to preach I was gonna preach on the Sardis church age park - I had that already go yesterday I've prepared two sermons and I was already go but seen we have a smaller group and you know just seem like we should just maybe minister to Haven here a little bit by God's grace hope that's okay the grace Lord but I was all ready to preach you know the the announcement and all that Jesus did there at the Sardis Church age I was all ready to do that but maybe Wednesday we'll see okay so let's go to Matthew 28 verse 19 we'll just go right in order right through the Scriptures so Haven could see that you have a Bible there in case you okay super thank you honey okay let's go up to verse eighteen twenty eight eighteen and Jesus came and spake of them saying all power is given to me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost let's stop right there is America one of the nations yeah so weird America we're missionaries in America how many understand that we're missionaries we're supposed to invite the Lost to come to our church and hear the Word of God so that's what we're doing we're teaching this nation here in Accra we're doing our little part in Akron we're teaching all nations verse nineteen oh yeah I already read verse nineteen okay verse twenty teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you so that's what happens after havens baptized and after we're all baptized then we need to learn to observe or obey all things commanded by Jesus in the Bible and lo I am with You alway even unto the end of the world amen so Haven has that promise and will have that promise that Christ is with us until the end all right acts 2:38 let's go there so ten days later ten days after Jesus said this Peter gets filled with the Holy Ghost and 120 get filled the Holy Ghost in acts 2:38 then Peter preaches this then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so Haven remission means sending away so Jesus has sent away your sins you don't have to you don't have to think about them anymore he sent them away that's what remit means to send away and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost Haven is power for you to serve God right it's power for service because jesus said when the Holy Ghost comes you'll be a new with power amen so the Holy Ghost will give you power to serve the Lord amen okay let's go to acts 816 we just kind of read that I'm sorry no we didn't read this one yet but we will read this X 8 16 here's where Philip baptizes in the name of the Lord Jesus so Peter baptized in Jesus Christ's name and now Philip baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus all right okay so could you read that for us verse 16 could you read eight sixteen for us so the Haven could hear amen thank you acacia so Seahaven they're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then you want the Holy Spirit to fall on you and that means he'll give you a blessing we'll give you a a worship and anointing something some power to love him more so yeah that's wonderful the Lord Jesus when we baptized and even Lord Jesus now we just saw the eunuch being baptized go to acts 1048 acts 1048 [Music] now you remember this story this is on this is the Centurion yeah I forget his name now Cornelius yeah this is on the top of Cornelius house the holy ghost Falls while Peter preaches the word and they received the Holy Ghost but they haven't been baptized yet so the Bible said and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days so here's another baptism and I want you to let's maokai jump up to verse 46 here's a time where the Holy Ghost falls in verse 46 for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God so Haven that's what we want to happen to you and everybody who's been baptized we want you to be so filled with God's love that you'll speak words you've never spoken before and you'll glorify God in a way you've never glorified him before that means it's a time of personal worship a time where you're free to worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen okay let's go to acts 19:5 two more scriptures then we'll be done here acts 19:5 we'll read five and six acts 19:5 and six Lydia can you read out that aloud sohaving can hear you amen so as soon as they're baptized Paul lays hands on them the Holy Ghost falls on them and they just start worshipping God through prophesying through speaking in tongues but remember there's other times in the Bible when they receive the Holy Ghost they just had boldness to talk about Jesus so that's what Helen Helen I told her we need to sit down new Bible study she was always taught that tongues were the evidence so I need I told her now they're actually not the evidence and so I need to sit down with her I need to make an appointment maybe Saturday to talk with her and show her that through the scripture but one thing's for sure when the Holy Ghost falls on you you'll either worship magnify God speak in tongues glorify God prophesy magnify God or do something you'll have some personal worship experience that's the experience of power power is coming on you to worship God amen all right and last one acts 22:16 here's Paul's baptism alright now notice when once we believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah we shouldn't we shouldn't put off our baptism but we should be baptized quickly look at verse 16 and now why tarriest thou why are you waiting Paul this is what Ananias is saying why are you waiting Paul don't wait arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling upon the name of the Lord and mommy remember when mommy explained it to you Haven before you get baptized your heart is like really dirty right it's got 13 s of sin the Bible also calls it a stony heart your hearts like a stone but once you repent and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior your dirty heart gets washed over and becomes white as snow or your stony heart turns into a really soft fleshly heart so instead of stone and soft like your skin your heart becomes really soft like that your spiritual heart because the Bible said see you wash away your sin so you can take that picture of a dirty heart like dirty laundry but then God takes this Holy Spirit and he washes all your sins away and now you're clean in Jesus name praise God was that helpful havens that helpful okay praise the Lord any questions Haven you have any questions or anyone else have any questions no okay wonderful let's we'll have a word of prayer and then I'll do is I think my wife and I just want to talk to Haven and you know say the sinner's prayer with her and she can officially invite the Lord into her heart here and then we'll get changed and then we'll head over to Portage Lakes now remember Portage Lakes we just go out let's see we go out this way take a right or left here take a right on Turkey foot road and take that for a while until ninety think it's 93 if I'm not mistaken so last time I was going the wrong way in the lab when we baptized acacia and Lydia I think we're driving all around I took the wrong road but I know the right road this time I haven't forgotten but let's just stand while we stand here we'll have a word of Prayer that's all let's all pray for Haven and the God will bless her and let's also pray for other souls in our families and Oh bang has people in his family I people my family I want to see my mom and my dad and others baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to see that with all my heart I'm so happy today you know to serve Haven her first communion by the God's grace and see my children take communion I was very thankful for that let's pray for her and also pray for the rest of our family that they can be saved father in heaven we love you today we thank you dear Jesus for this time we thank you Lord for the power of your word Lord well I think about how I would hear brother Branham preach about water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and people would shout and praise God and glorify God because that great revelation of the name of Jesus Christ in Baptism thank you for this revelation Lord it means that much to us Lord now it means that much to me I can baptize four of my children thus far in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the name above all names the family name of all the family of God in heaven and on earth where we pray a special blessing upon Haven thank you for opening her eyes Lord she's been talking for months about wanting to serve you wanting to become a Christian Lord you've taken the fear out of her heart she driven the fear out of her heart and now she's ready to be baptized she's ready to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Lord we just pray a special blessing upon her Lord as she's baptized may her sins be washed away she's not gonna tarry any longer Lord this is the day Lord by your grace that she'll have her sins washed away thank you that the Lamb of God took away those sins Lord God thank you that you died and Lord paid the price for these sins you took our place as a substitution and you were you were made sin that we might be made your righteousness you were made dirty that we might be clean Lord thank you for that Lord Lord let the Holy Ghost come upon her I pray dear Jesus she can give you glory and magnify you with boldness perhaps prophesy or speak in tongues or have boldness - to magnify you whatever may be Lord may the Holy Ghost come upon her Lord for thy glory that she can have power for service Lord Jesus and father I pray for the rest of our families I see our
