a part two on Wednesday's sermon Wednesday we looked at the headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace so I Look to look at part two so Zechariah we'll just go to chapter 4 verse 6 Zechariah 4 verse 6. thank you I'm just lean a little bit more I'm gonna bring out some former things I preach just regarding the temple of God then award-winning add a little more here by the grace of God I do apologize you know our sermon for Wednesday uh had an air uploading if you can turn this on occasion thank you so I apologize about that you know it just rarely happens but uh so I thought well since it didn't get posted I think I'll preach it again and add a little bit more into it by God's grace so I hope it's a blessing here today by the grace of God it's always a blessing to be in the house of the Lord praise God Amen Zechariah 4 verse 6 and 7. we could probably read both those verses together here so let's read that on three one two three then he answered and spanked unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who are thou o great Mountain before serumable Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it and may God add his Blessing to the reading his work you may be seated praise God you can switch over I have a few slides I'd like to show here so it's set on Wednesday you know we looked at this first part here and I think I'll just I want to back around a little bit on the temple of God so I found that picture there online I thought it was a pretty nice picture that must be zeroable because he's kind of given the directions here and Israel was trying to read rebuild the Temple of God it was the Temple of course that Solomon built and uh it was of course destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon because of their failure to obey the word of God God gave them hundreds of years of Mercy hundreds of years of Grace lots of long suffering how many leave God is long-suffering amen even with course with us as well you know he's so long-suffering he's so merciful but when it got to this part where the cup was filled up and then God poured out judgment upon Israel so we'll be looking at a little bit of historical uh facts here and just see how it relates um brother Branham calls the last stone that was laid on top of course you can see there's more stones but I'll show some other pictures brother Ram types that last Stone being laid on top to the rapture the coming of Jesus Christ to the church praise God so that's why we you know I felt led to preach on this it's been a while since I preached on it's been about 10 years actually according to my notes but uh it'd be just a good reminder here about the types in this and so the headstone is coming with shoutings of Grace Grace amen Hallelujah so if they shout in the Old Testament what about the New Testament praise God amen amen so we read our text and I just found this online too I'd like to just read this you know I don't agree with some of the dates in here but anyways the first temple that God had constructed other than we'd say the guardian Temple for Adam and Eve the garden Temple uh would bet would have been Moses's Tabernacle so we see Moses Tabernacle the Wilderness and then King David uh prepares Solomon to build Solomon's Temple they're around just around a thousand BC depending on who you listen to and of course this Temple was the first temple period then it got destroyed there by Nebuchadnezzar but then it's Aruba the one we're preaching on zero reconstructed it and so that's uh zerubel's time here not only the the date was later than that I don't believe it was 5 15. because brother Adam tells us the beginning of the date of Daniel 70 weeks he tells us that was 445 BC and so we I don't believe that's the right date I believe that's the wrong date which that wouldn't surprise anybody if the theologians got it wrong would that surprise anybody here at the theologians got things mixed up a little bit that wouldn't surprise us and so this Temple of course stood and and then uh Herod constructed a larger uh temple with more room for uh the people he was trying to win favor with the Jews and so Herod constructed that finished it about 19 BC I think it was 46 years in building and so he tore down zerubo's Temple and then he made a larger Temple and of course then this was destroyed in 70 A.D by Titus right the Roman Emperor Titus come in and remember that was about 40 years after Israel had rejected Christ so there's 40 years again as a warning date right 40 years is a probation period giving them 40 years to repent right but they failed to repent and so God brought judgment in so again we look at we see the long-suffering of God we see the mercy of God so there's a little background there on the temples and uh the first one of course was Moses I love this picture you know uh uh you know the the you know looking down from heaven God God God placed the Tabernacle here the place of worship God told Moses and Aaron I'll meet with you there praise God I'll meet with you Above The Mercy Seat Hallelujah and God would meet with them and he said I want I want to these tribes on the west these tribes on the North these tribes on the east and south and imagine God just got a big smile on his face when he looked down from heaven praise God and he's seen all his people in the in the shape of a cross hallelujah hallelujah and of course that would remind us of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world praise God in other words God knew this whole time man was going to fall yep Man was created in God's image but God had it all planned out God knew man would fall and struggled and he said he knew the law would be a a a a foreshadow the law would be a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ amen and here it is the law as a Schoolmaster the law was pointing us to the Cross hallelujah amen we couldn't live under law law would never work we could never complete it but it would take Grace for us to serve God so God looked down and of course this is what Balaam would have seen as well remember uh Bala to Balaam at the exalted position looked down and said oh how beautiful are thy tents oh Jacob amen hallelujah and of course it's beautiful Hallelujah the cross is beautiful amen amen it was awful for Jesus but beautiful for us hallelujah amen it's awful Friday for Christ but it was a good Friday for us hallelujah amen amen amen he suffered in our place he died in our place Hallelujah and he rose for our justification Hallelujah proving that we're forgiven the resurrection of Christ proves we are forgiven it proves that that our that we have a pure sacrifice all of our sins are washed away because Jesus Christ rose from the dead Hallelujah justification means declared righteous so because Jesus rose you are righteous this morning amen hallelujah praise God nothing to worry about don't worry about going to hell he's already went to hell for us he's already paid the price for us God already accepted our sacrifice amen hallelujah was accepted Hallelujah that means he has made us accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah I'm accepted because of my sacrifice you're accepted because of your sacrifice Jesus Christ makes every believer Rejoice to see the cross Hallelujah so like when they were we're on their necks amen Hallelujah and of course remember these four directions represented each one had a banner each one had a standard God placed his his people in groups and then you you had the West Side had the band or the ox the north side had the eagle Banner uh the East Side had the line Banner uh the lion l-i-o-n not Liars but lion lying anointing and the South had the anointing or the uh uh the the emblem of a man and each one of course was representing something in heaven so this this Camp setup was a representation of what God had already had in heaven praise God man remember God gave Moses this whole pattern he said you're going to lay it out like this all the details everything come from Heaven praise God and let me say like this this message from God gave to brother Adam it came from Heaven hallelujah amen it's restoring the pattern of the book of Acts Hallelujah restoring us we are a part of the book of Acts Church Hallelujah we're a continuance of the book of Acts we got the same baptism as the book of Acts amen we got the same gifts of the Spirit as the book of Acts the same Doctrine the same life the same love and care one for another praise God Amen that's the book of Acts Hallelujah and remember said these beasts when brother Adam preached them brother said these four beasts are also in heaven these four are in heaven the eagle anointings in heaven so there's an angel cherubim that has an eagle head in heaven a lion one that has a lion head in heaven one that has a man the one that has an oxen and they surround the Throne of God hallelujah so we see the same we see both four uh emblems here on Earth in Moses time as they are in heaven praise God and brother Adam said these are these are the four anoint things on the church and he said currently we're under the eagle anointing praise God and the eagle watches and he goes after prey Hallelujah and we watch and pray Hallelujah yes that's what we do we win of course Eagle represents a prophet ego represents God and we have the prophetic Revelation the mysteries of God have been finished in this hour Hallelujah another age had that we've got the mysteries of God finished Hallelujah yeah and what do they do they help us live a holy life hallelujah amen they help us live a Christian Life without it we want to live in Hallelujah but because we got the Revelation now we can live a Christian Life Hallelujah it's the anointing for this day and brother Adam says don't forget it these are the reformers when the Beast went forth in the form of a man to combat that now don't forget this class don't forget it remember all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus saith the Lord hallelujah so it's so important to remember the day you live in you're impacted by the anointing God has given out so we can't live off a lion anointing we can't live off the The Man anointing or the ox anointing we've got to live off the eagle anointing praise God Amen we've got to live up in Heavenly places we've got to be Kings and Priests unto God we have to live on that anointing because that's the anointing for our day hallelujah amen amen the prophetic revelation of this hour watching praying that's why we've got to be prayed up we got to constantly talk to God we got got to constantly uh watch things we gotta have to watch the the conditions of the world I said like this we got to watch the conditions of Our Lives as well praise God the Bible says we should examine ourselves make sure that we're in the face hallelujah amen amen that's what we're doing this morning amen now I want to get back to the temple here now here's about the size I showed this was a different one from Wednesday so here's an American football field that's about what it's like 120 yards there now Solomon's Temple was oh about five I mean I'm sorry about 60 of a football field okay so that's pretty big that's a pretty big Temple platform praise God see a football game isn't it something uh football field is a place to worship today isn't that something right of course Heathen worship but real true worship of God that's about what Solomon had about a football field and then Herod came and of course he knocked down his Temple was again about the same size at least the height 60 cubits from what I was reading it was at least the same height uh and then saw a Harry come around and make it larger so the women can get in the there's a place for the Gentiles as well so we had we have Harris Temple much larger now in Ezekiel 41 and 42 it lays out an even larger Temple for the Millennium praise God think about that all the saints down through the ages are going to be able to come into that Temple praise God we're going to go work we'll go to worship service with John amen and Pastor I'm sorry and Prophet Paul amen and brother imagine that brother Arnie we walk in here next to brother random and Saint Paul and Joshua and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob Hallelujah I'm going to church with Abraham today well at least I'm going to church with Abraham C today talk about this day September was it the 10th breaks God we're going to church with Abraham's seed this morning Hallelujah but one day we'll go to church with Abraham and Sarah hallelujah amen and Jesus will be in there Hallelujah Jesus the great son of David he'll be the great king over that Temple hallelujah oh I'm so glad we can come in we can come in all these different ways or different three different gates to get in this place Hallelujah and the Bible lays it out the size of it praise God and so we can imagine so how many football fields will fit in here think about that how many football players one two three maybe six or seven football fields and all the saints down Through the Ages oh my cerebruma will be there Hallelujah Daniel will be there all the saints will be there praise God oh I wouldn't want to stand by The Heroes of Faith one day amen well then let's be a hero today let's say it on the word of God today Hallelujah and our humble and our humble calling in life let us be a hero for Christ Hallelujah if others won't stand for the truth you and I will stand for the truth praise God now I found this one this morning again it's just a different visual of ezekiel's uh Temple of Ezekiel 41 and 42 maybe we'll preach on that next we'll kind of see how the Lord guides but again you see the three entrances you got your inner court now I like here it's starting to get closer to this last chapter of the Bible the River of Life flows right through this uh right through this Temple I like that praise God there's got to be a water source amen kind of reminds me of the Waterway the waterways water baptism hallelujah amen the way into Christ is through the name of Jesus Christ not father son Holy Ghost it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there's one River of Life there's one way to Salvation there's one Lord One Faith one baptism hallelujah amen and we have the altar there as well the altar outer core holy Place holiest of holies now imagine which which of us spiritual Kings and Priests get to go into the holiest I wonder for the Millennium or is it just Jesus that gets to go in there what a thought my goodness but this is the size this is says six football fields can fit in there Hallelujah and this is the temple this is uh this is uh this will be the uh the headquarters of all Earth worship during the millennium so for a thousand years the Bible said they'll come up and the Nations will flow into this house amen oh my God Nations all the nations and the Bible said some of us will rule over 10 Nations or ten cities Hallelujah will rule over them with the wrath of Ira in the Bible says at some point it'll be their time it's our time to go up to the house of God it's our turn to worship it's our turn to go sacrifice hallelujah amen amen it's our turn to go see Jesus amen ah no Nations will obey the word of God Hallelujah the Bible said a man won't need to teach his neighbor because the Bible said God will reveal that truth that that truth will already be in him Hallelujah because he's got a new body we've got to glorified bodies Hallelujah and the truth will be in us hallelujah amen and we'll still go up and worship our Lord Jesus Christ amen Amen in this Millennial Temple Hallelujah imagine that all the tribes of Israel be there remember those tribes I showed you all the tribes will flow into there as well praise God I say God likes families God loves a family of of ephraiman and you know eventually put Dan and Eve from back in is because he's so merciful praise God loves all the tribes Hallelujah and each one gets a turn to come in and worship their creator oh and we can say that's what I was born to do that's my whole purpose for being here is to worship my Creator praise God I was born to worship Jesus amen amen that's what I'm here for praise God to worship our Lord Jesus Christ now think about that that Millennial temple one side is 750 feet wide so let me go back there so this is 750 feet that's about 14 of one mile that's really small right no but the lab but our our future home though is going to be 1500 miles wide or 7 million 920 000 feet wide that's just how wide it is almost 8 million feet wide so there's no comparison this is just a tiny tiny little Temple for a thousand years until we go to our future home Hallelujah amen snuff this is small compared [Music] power and God's love and his Mercy it's just going to get greater as time goes on Hallelujah think about that we'll be happy with that for a thousand years we'll rejoice in this for a thousand years but God says I got something better for all eternity hallelujah amen eight million feet on just one side of this holy city praise God Amen amen and there's a picture uh like brother man said brother Adam said he studied Larkin and he said 1500 miles he said is from Florida to Maine that's one that's just one side of this Holy City that's just one one on the side there's four sides not just one side that's how great the side is remember there's uh there's three gates on each side right because there's four uh three times four is twelve and each gate is named after one of the 12 tribes of Israel one of those men they were predestined talk about predestination talk about God for knowing your name before the foundation of the world Simeon God spoke Simeon and that name is gonna be on the game praise God Hallelujah such an important name all these names Dan oh my so important God had to have the right name it's all speaking of God's mercy and Grace hallelujah oh my God that's how big this one is but remember the the the millennial one is about 14 of one mile yeah this one is 1500 square miles so when it comes down when when our final destination comes down this is what it's going to look like on the earth it's a pyramid and so the Bible said it's going to come down like a bride adorned for its husband praise God Amen so the the Earth is locking unto a a bride now remember there'll be no more seats this picture isn't exactly accurate you know there's there might there might be lakes and rivers but there'll be no more sea in the future home there'll be no great seas God's gonna need some room on there for his his people praise God it's a rule and Reign amen but that's what the Bible says we'll see at the end of the Millennium there after the white Throne judgment we'll see uh we'll see our future home coming down like a bride adorned for its groom like we all watch Lena come into the service there man at the wedding a couple weeks ago that's what it was like we're all gonna stand there and watch our Heavenly City come down and say hallelujah that's my home amen that's where I was spreading my eternity with Jesus Hallelujah it comes down like that now that's about the right location brother said he thought the very center of it would be right about where Israel is right now so that's the placing of our future home so I might be far from it right now but but that day I'll be right in it by God's grace amen hallelujah God's gonna make sure that there's a mansion like the Bible said I go to prepare a mansion for you praise God yes I go to prepare a place for you so that where I am you can be also Hallelujah I know there's one at least one room in there for me Hallelujah and my family amen hallelujah there's got to be at least one place in there that's got Jesse and Kristen Smith written on it by God's grace and that's got your name on Hallelujah it's all as well 1500 miles tall Hallelujah that's eight million feet high Hallelujah that's pretty high plenty of room for God's people hallelujah and I love Larkin's picture this is the picture Clarence Larkin Drew brother random uh like Clarence Larkin he think Clarence Larkin for a lot of his works so here we see uh I think that's Gad Reuben and Sybian and then oh yeah and then the apostles have their name in the foundation John James Peter I love this picture because it's got all these castles all these homes and just one of those is mine one of those is yours Spirit Hallelujah that's what we're living for we're living for here not to build up our our property here we're living to make sure we got a property there Hallelujah that's the real estate I'm investing in you got real estate Investments God bless you but this is the best real estate investment you can possibly make Hallelujah and how do you invest repent and believe God's word hallelujah amen amen State investment I'm doing one job and ask one time when you can do some real estate investing well maybe after I get the house paid off or something like that but I should have said I'm already doing real estate investment I already got life assurance [Applause] eternal life Assurance as brother random said amen hallelujah as long as I get out of the Grave that's the most important thing defy the grave as well because the living Saints will be translated in the moment and the twinkling of the eye praise God hey man look at that River just see just like the Millennials there's that river flowing up to the throne of God there it is again God likes that one River something about there's one water there's one way there's one water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen there's one way now if around southern city must be a pyramid he said he said now the walls and the foundation were equal that doesn't necessarily mean that's a cube or a square there's another geographical measure the dimensions are the same that is a pyramid Four Square line four square and the walls were the same the number then draws it we're going to get into something and sure as the world notice the dimensions of this angle is exactly the same all of them there's another measure the pyramid that proves it so if you go and look online most people think of the future home looks like this all right my brother said it can't be that and of course Larkin agreed it's got to be the pyramid and the reason was because he says see now you have got the city it's a holy mountain he said not a holy Cube he said a holy mountain s that help you nothing shall hurt or destroy in Isaiah as it says in all my holy mountains saith the Lord It's not a cube it's a mountain and the whip by the breath by the height they're equal 1500 miles this way man eight million miles Hallelujah I'm sorry 8 million feet rather eight million feet 1500 miles this way 1500 miles that way 1500 miles all the way around 1500 miles high so it's a great Mountain like a pyramid and the city is on the mountain the rest of the throne the throne cannot be seen if the walls are straight up and down like a cube so it has to be a pyramid [Music] who is everybody going to want to see who has eternal life who's the one person we want to see Jesus if he's at the top of a cube and he's only on one side of the cube only one group's gonna see him but Jesus wants to be seen by all his people praise God Amen he wants to be seen he doesn't want to be hidden yeah yeah Hallelujah right now he's hidden right and he reveals himself to those who are babes that would love to learn the gospel hallelujah amen he hides himself from the wash and prune it and he reveals himself a debate such as we learned Hallelujah if these walls were straight up and down the city could only be seen from the outside or from the inside the throne can only be seen from the inside Hallelujah so it can be a cube because then nobody can see the Throne of God right yes and brother Adam said the Pyramid of Giza in Egypt which we believe Enoch built is a witness of the pyramid-shaped new city that is to come to the Earth even its location because look how close it is to Israel look how close Egypt's so close to Israel well the ram said this being this way would answer exactly Enoch sign in Egypt remember the Bible said it would it would be a sign I don't have the scripture but it's in that it's in that servant I preached he said would it Enoch before the antelope and destruction when justification was coming in he brought forth a sign and this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber watch on that seventh step if you ever studied the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king watch those stations that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in in the pyramid so seven steps seven Church ages right now so there's the Pyramid of Giza right south of Cairo there Southwest of Cairo I've never been there anybody been there in here nope okay we're not we're not World Travelers but uh let me just show zoomed in pictures so look here's maybe man my high maybe he's six foot or something like that uh I believe Jason Demars just got back from there look how tall this is look how tall I mean look just look at the layers how many layers not good and then there but there was no Capstone and brother said this is a sign that one day God is going to have a pyramid Hallelujah that's right that God's gonna have a great Mountain a Holy Mountain Hallelujah this is a mountain that defies all scientific machine power all scientific of any exploration or Discovery this mountain defies all that and so will the mounts of the Lord it'll defy all the ways of man hallelujah amen glory praise God and this great mountain is a sign that one day Christ is going to come back because it has no headstone Glory Hallelujah just like cerebral it had no headstone so God has to send the headstone back and speaking of Jesus Christ returning to the church in other words this is a type of the body of Christ now wouldn't you like to see I would like to see this which one of those stones is the Cornerstone which is a [Music] Stone Stones I'm gonna put all them on this Stone I'll tell you that's a good looking Stone that's a perfectly shaped Stone and who is the stone stone Mason that placed that right in place and got the measurement exactly right so this thing doesn't fall over right so the stones don't move out of place and it stood there it withstood the flood it's where it's withstood Wars and storms and all these things it's wasted the test of time and so has God's Church wished us to test the time Hallelujah brought all things on it Roman persecution they brought on Holocaust World War One World War II and now they're bringing on this woke agenda and they're bringing this storms of demons on from every side but this church this Holy Mountain will continue praise God amen this Holy Mountain will receive the headstone Hallelujah it will withstand all the the trials of Lies the cares of this world all the fiery trials it has to because it needs a headstone Hallelujah amen Glory so this is a sign for us this is a sign of the church that we are the body we're the building of Christ as we showed on Sunday let's read that let's go back here to Ephesians 2 I want to read that again I ended it but I was going kind of quick I was trying to finish quickly let's take our time here it's not even 11 30 so got plenty of time Ephesians 2 19. let me just remind you here again let's go to verse 12. just I'm going to lay this in here just to help out all the saints here that at that time he or without Christ so before in the Old Testament Gentiles were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world so let's stop right there so before before let's say before this happened you know we had that we had uh we had the Tabernacle of Moses right we have Solomon's Temple and most most Gentiles were kept out of there right and the Bible said we were without Christ imagine that you were without Christ but Christ wanted to include you Christ wanted to build this over 2 000 years so I wonder if this might be the first church age second third fourth fifth sixth and there we are right at the top amen oh there's just a few stones at the top it's just a few Believers amen but they are found faithful hallelujah amen amen and so we are without Christ but God had this in his mind I'm going to build a church I'm going to build a dwelling place for my spirit Hallelujah Hallelujah because before you had to be around Moses as Tabernacle and you had to be around Solomon's Temple that's irumables and then Harris Temple you had to be physically around that but God said I'm going to do something greater I'm going to make a universal Temple praise God and the body of Christ no matter where they are whether they're in America or Africa or or Australia or Europe wherever they are they can still be a part of this pyramid Hallelujah it can still be a part of the temple of God hallelujah but now in Christ Jesus you sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ don't let anybody tell you that God is far from you the Bible said he he was far from you but because of the Cross now he's close to you I said that to Chris last night brother Chris I said are you I'm inviting you back to church brother but I said let me tell you you are not Jesus Christ draw an eye to Christ Hallelujah and He will draw an eye to you but the blood of Jesus Christ brings us closer to God how many believe in the crucifixion of Christ amen if you believe in that then the Bible said God has drawn has drawn near to you praise God Amen amen don't let the devil say you're far from God you're far from God the Bible says I'm near God hallelujah My Sacrifice Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ has brought me near to his son amen verse 15 he abolished the hatred The Entity between the law and and sinners God abolished that that curse of the law if you're guilty of one law then you're guilty of all 613 right that was a curse God abolished that curse that curse is no more thanks you're blessed hallelujah amen amen you're blessed you're not under the law of 613 laws or can I say this the Amish laws of of their pamphlets right brother we're not under those uh stack of man-made Creeds we're under the blood of Jesus Christ and that blood speaks better things Mercy it speaks the love of God hey the blood of Jesus Christ abolished legalism praise God and then God if he saves us he expects us to love him and then he said if you love me keep my Commandments and that's why we keep God's Commandments because we love him why because he first loved us amen oh nothing more beautiful than the gospel praise God Hallelujah verse 17 and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh that's Gentile and Jew for through him we both have access by one spear unto the father church is so easy for you to contact your heavenly father amen you have access through the blood of Jesus Christ amen So when you say Jesus maybe I'm struggling today or yesterday or whatever I had a tough week you said God forgive me my sins I'm coming to you now and if you truly confess those sins then you've already you already have access your heavenly father has already accepted you back in because you have access by one Spirit to God almighty amen through the blood of Christ Glory verse 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners think of that you're not a stranger to this this this by this this New Testament Church you're not a stranger you're a family member nobody can keep you out you're already brought in yeah I'm not a stranger this this is me this is what I was born for praise God Amen these are my people like you said these are my people amen the Christians Hallelujah the Believers but your fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone amen oh my God so Jesus is the Cornerstone in here so Paul Paul's got to be in the air John James all the saints Luke that's the foundation praise God and we are standing on top of their works we're standing on the work of Jesus Christ Hallelujah in other words we are on a firm foundation we're not going to fall we cannot be shaken because our foundation is sure God's already accepted his foundation amen the one that laid this Foundation Hallelujah I can't fall because I'm On Solid Rock Amen Christ the solid rock I stand amen all other girls is shaking sand the world sinks out here but you and I are not sinking down to hell we're being raised up to heaven hallelujah amen amen we have quite the foundation that's why I church every time every time you're struggling go back here go go inspect your foundation make sure no Waters get in your foundation if you own a home and you got a basement sometimes you gotta worry about water again I'll tell you this Foundation oh that's that's funny too yeah I didn't realize that or pipes break in your foundation right and they flood your your basement but you just if you ever feel like things are water's coming in or the enemy's coming in like a flood my goodness the spirit of God will raise up a standard against the enemy praise God go check your foundation you'll see your foundation never leaked amen that's right your foundation sure your foundation is steadfast it's got insurance it's got Eternal insurance the Bible you got such concerns the Bible said God could swear by no other so he swore by himself you know that God's Own Insurance God is his word is his insurance but he's the backing of that insurance praise God Amen in other words I'm backing up my word you can trust my word you can hang your soul on my word it's got Eternal Assurance Hallelujah I mean I closed my Bible and I lost my spot here or something I didn't say Ephesians 2 what a foundation we got verse 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy Temple of the Lord the Sea church where fitly frame to God doesn't look like every stone was placed in the right position don't you know you're in the right position you're right where God wants you yes now if you have a sin to confession yeah you might be out of position but confess that sin and then you're right back in God's position for you amen I don't gotta worry you know did God know I was going to be born in uh Northwest Ohio did God know I was going to live my whole life in Ohio absolutely God knew where every one of those stones is going to be yes Hallelujah and if that was made anything like Solomon's uh Temple they they took all those stones from all around the world and they were shipped there they were by ships and by sailing or by cars and they took all these stones from around the world and gathered them and build up this house of God God sent you here hallelujah God sent you to hear the word God sent you to love God's people you're right in position praise God God knew every one of those thumbs and God knew every one of your footsteps Hallelujah amen the stone let's say on that level it couldn't be for that level it's got to be for that level you couldn't have been born in Jesus day you could have been born in Martin Luther's day you had to be born in this day hallelujah amen your place exactly where God wanted you praise God in other words God knew you would overcome the laodicean conditions amen the world says I'm rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing so that's what the enemy says but God knew you'd you'd want spiritual riches and you would you want the eyes out of God you want the Raven of righteousness Hallelujah and you want to be on fire god knew that you'd want more of God hallelujah that's why God placed you as a stone right at the top Hallelujah now if I had my choice I might have lived in the days of Jesus I don't know I don't know I would have been powerful or maybe Saint Paul follow him around but God knew God had better ideas if I'd had my choice I would have chose the end time and look he was at the end time but not the very end see even that brother didn't live to see the Rapture without dying right so we don't always get what we always want right so we got to be humble how many want to be humble by God I'm just glad to be in this Holy Holy Temple praise God Amen I'm just glad to be framed into this house of God this house of worship verse 22 that's what that that's what this is that's why I'm reading this verse 22 last verse in whom he also are building together for inhabitation of God through the Holy Spirit like I was closing on Wednesday night I said we come to church and this is the house of God and these walls are just they're just here you think oh they're just light blue and you know that's nice thank God especially when when it when it rains or snows or hails I'm glad we got a building praise God but you know the building really doesn't do a whole lot for the service it's different with God's Temple and you're God's Temple the Bible said you are a habitation of God through the spirit amen amen in other words then the Bible says you're not just a stone you're a Lively Stone praise God so in the body of Christ each one of us are stoned and but each one of us are not dead each one of us are stopped standing there we're just not sitting there we are praising God Hallelujah the holy spirit is flowing through US imagine this is a this is a well imagine if each one of those stones could shout and praise God right one time Jesus said if they don't shout these stones are going to cry out that's right one time he said that praise God but in the spiritual this is the New Testament Church the New Testament Church everyone is a stone and every stone has a testimony amen every stone knows or praise God amen amen every stone loves to inhabit God don't you love having God inside of you praise God who says this aren't you glad that the spirit of God keeps you from living a sinful life so that the spirit of God can live inside [Applause] I'm glad Devils don't live in my life I'm glad the Holy Spirit cleans out my life amen amen that's what I want to be I want to be a place where God can live hallelujah amen thank God that's exactly what Paul says and Paul said every man will be judged by that right he said my gospel will judge every every secret of every man's heart on the day of judgment God to say you confess all your your secret thoughts you confess all your sins you are a habitation of God through the spirit yes when you preach the people felt the spirit of God my brother amen sang we felt the spirit of God right in other words you you know when Harley testified we stopped we felt the spirit of God Amen when Levi testified and built that church we felt the spirit of God amen amen pray the spirit of God will anoint that place Hallelujah to be finished this is what we're meant to be we're meant to be places that inhabit the spirit of God people can see God living in US amen now that's again where it'll be if you look at the Grand scale that that's again where that holy city where our future home is going to be right in that location now I found this the wall of Jerusalem is just about 200 or I'm sorry 20 stories tall so this Bank in Richmond Virginia is about 19 stories tall so you can see like here's a fence you know now that wall is going to have foundations right and then there's going to be three gates but that wall is going to be almost 8 million feet long just one side of it that's a lot of rock that's a lot of stone and there's four of those walls there's four sides that are eight million feet plus 20 stories tall and the bibles are the gems will be all placed in that Foundation the beauty Hallelujah don't you know the man said you're a gem in somebody's Crown praise God he said be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ Hallelujah gems will remind us of all the victories all the testimonies praise God all that God did see God God dug you out of the Maori clay God dug you out of the earth and he found this gem but he had to he had to smooth it off praise God he had to cut that diamond hey man yeah things out of your life amen and all those gems and diamonds speak of the glory of Christ in your life Hallelujah you and I will get to walk into that City praise God and by God's grace if the Bible's right then we are the royalty of that City if the Bible's right because the Bible said you're a peculiar people you're a holy priesthood you're just we're not I we went to uh we went to that core life restaurant on Friday and their shirt says not a spectator I thought that's exactly what we're going to be that's what we're going to wear in heaven I'm not a spectator that's looking around look at all these people praise God I'm going to be doing the praise and amen praise God Amen I'm not a spectator I'm an artist I'll praise your name amen [Applause] of God [Applause] all the gems can be the spectators right but I don't want to be a spectator I want to be a priest in that City a royal priesthood the Bible says amen hallelujah now I want to this one I read on uh Wednesday so I added that in the beginning there I'm just going to skip ahead in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia he led the first band of the Jews back to Jerusalem this is zerubim I believe there'll be a great reward for that there's I I forget the number I think it was hundreds of thousands of Jews were afraid and didn't leave Babylon they got comfortable in Babylon they got comfortable in laodicea and they wouldn't go back to the promised land and brother Adam said the promised land is the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] if you want to be a part of the kingdom of God you must be born again praise God Google will tax one of those up won the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God ah it's beautiful praise God so in the first year he brought those people back they got established in the second year though he built the Altar and laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar all right so we'll show a picture of this in just a moment here and remember he was up the sea line of David that's a beautiful type there Christ came out of the seed line of David Hallelujah beautiful type now remember church this was fulfilling prophecies when he came back the Bible said thus saith the Lord after seven years we accomplished at Babylon I'll visit you and perform my good word to you and causing you to return this place for I know the thoughts I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end what was their end their end was to leave Babylon and get back to the holy city that was their end and the church what is the end for you to be born again and be a fruitful Christian praise God Amen to have a good ground that brings forth much fruit praise God Amen that's your expected end praise God Amen now if you got anything other than that let's just cherry on top right that's just some other extra blessing but the main thing is be born again and that the fruit of the Holy Spirit flow out of your life praise God only four grounds Jesus said and the most fruitful was the one that glorified him amen it overcame the cares of the world and Jesus said that's a good and honest heart that's what we need the message Honest Hearts yes amen not Liars Honest Hearts amen that's what we need the message today he said then you should call upon me and then didn't they call upon him right and he shall go and pray unto me I will hearken unto you this is speaking of his room will came back he's the first one right that led this charge of 42 000 imagine a church of forty two thousand huh that'd be a real church right there I'll tell you that you need some deacons over thousands of that I need about 42 deacons oh a thousand per Deacon they can take care of the Saints there but this was fulfilled prophet I'm following the message of the hour amen amen the spirit of God is calling us back God has given us favor and we've got to rebuild the house of God that's all he did he just followed the message of the hour that's all we got to do praise God just do what the Bible says follow the message of the hour praise God let the word of God be written on the fleshy tables of your heart it's so simple you just have to see what is God doing is God doing anything in the Pentecostal church is God doing anything in the Amish Church is God doing anything in the Christian marriage Missionary Alliance Church or how about the Roman Catholic Church God's not doing nothing in them God has begged them to come out but you are the ones who heard the voice you're the ones that obey you're the ones that come out of her my people that should be not partakers of our sins and plagues so you are the Blessed hallelujah amen I know I was raising the domination I was Raising Pentecostal Church Assembly of God now when I was younger it felt like Revival but as I got older and I left I saw it go downhill and now downhill just about as down as you can go it's about as low as you can go it's all about just speaking in tongues speaking in tongues and if you don't speak in tongues you didn't have church well the fact is they never had Church to begin with praise God because you got to get the sin out before you can have church what does Church mean called out ones and so these people that speak in tongues they don't get called out of their sinful lives they continue to live in sin so they never even get called out they can't have church they can't be the called out ones if they don't get sin out of their lives right the church that's what I found this ministry a brother around to be it's a Ministry that calls us out of sin into obedience to the Bible amen hallelujah praise God I'll tell you you know and you know too I was raised in nomination it had been a lot easier to stay in the nomination because you can just go with the flow you can divorce and remarry as much as you want you can run out your money if you want it's a lot easier to stay in there it's the hard thing is to come to God the hard thing is is service after service to be cut by the the Diamond of the word as we said earlier it's harder you gotta live a whole new life you can't sit there and be complacent right right you know Christ is coming you got to make yourself ready praise God most people in denomination are making themselves ready to live uh the best retirement life they can live that's what they're they're living to retire that's what they're living for they want to go sit on the beach every day and drink uh is it pina coladas I don't know some some alcohol they want to sit on the beach sun tan and drink alcohol that's what they think retirement is Mercy retirement for me or retirement for any Christian uh should be retiring from sin praise God Amen I'm gonna retire from sinning praise God Amen you're not a living Holiness I want to be what Jesus called me to be I want to be in the service of the Lord praise God hmm amen or to retire from my sinful thoughts my sinful behaviors amen that's what I would retire from praise God so see he had to catch the Fulfillment he had to fulfill the prophecy of that hour and the prophecy for our hour is Elijah shall restore all things all the Bible is being restored how many believe that yeah the Bible is being restored in our lives not the book itself we've got the best Bible the King James Bible but it's we have to live the lives of the Apostles right that's got to be restored in our life amen and so brother Levi's doing the right thing if he feels that if God call the church to be there then God will ordain a pastor over that church because Paul said I'll ordain Elders in every city that's right Hallelujah that's that's the gospel God wants more Believers praise God yes Hallelujah there's no telling what don't answer there's no telling what God will do when he can get one man in this hand pastor of course and then the church you know they all in one Accord there's no telling what God will do praise God that's beautiful and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and I'll be found of you how do you want to find him praise God Amen save the Lord I believe we have and I'll turn away your captivity I'll bring you out of the slavery amen glory God brought you out of I'm a slavery brother Hallelujah God brought me out of a presbyterian and mega church slavery praise God slavery to their systems yes it is it was you got to be a part of this and you gotta find your place and you gotta uh what'd they say you got to be plugged in they said well it was plugged into a man-made Creed is what they wanted to plug into they didn't want to plug into Christ Hallelujah I'll gather you from the nation and from the places whether I've driven you saith the Lord and I'll bring you again in the place once I've caused you to be carried away captive I'm bringing you right back to Pentecost amen hallelujah you you started off in denomination you started off love it praise God also fulfills another prophecy the 70 weeks of Daniel we'll just read verse 25. know therefore to understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in trouble as times zero could say I'm fulfilling Jeremiah's word unfulfilling Daniel's word and church we can say we're fulfilling Malachi's word because he said Elijah shall turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers amen amen is your heart more in love with the book of Acts it should be that's what programs Ministry was to do to bring your heart back to the condition of the apostolic fathers Hallelujah that's what it's for we're fulfilling Malachi's prophecy Jesus said in Matthew 17 Elijah restore all things so we're fulfilling the prophecy of Christ all right so Cyrus issued this order to rebuild in 445 BC it was finished 49 years later by Nehemiah in 369. so that chart says 5 15. I don't know where they got that number that number's way off this number but that was cerebral Ezra Nehemiah fulfilling the first seven weeks of Daniel's 70th week Hallelujah could say this day this scripture is fulfilled just like Jesus could say this day this scriptures will fail praise God and church we gotta get to the spot where we can look at Acts chapter 2 and say this day this scripture is being fulfilled Hallelujah I restore say through all the years the denomination of worms ate up God has restored the real life of God back we got the anointing of the ego the anoint you the Holy Ghost this day this scripture is fulfilled Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] must have been 2012. I was preaching on this thought and a sister uh what's his name brother Rachel I can't remember his name a brother from that area his I was preaching on this and saying one of these days we'll say this day the scripture is fulfilled it'll be the book of Acts and his young daughter started speaking in tongues right there and it just went up in a row I said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen hallelujah in other words I say that this day this scripture is fulfilled amen I'm a part of the book of Acts Church it wasn't all roses and miracles for the book of Acts Church sometimes they're they're upset how come we're not giving these poor widows their food right other times it's like John John Barnes uh I'm sorry no Palms I'm not traveling with you I don't like that guy you're going with I don't trust that brother well fine you go your way I'll go my way of course but God bless you you know right other times it's like are these Gentiles really or not we got to have a conference we got to talk this thing out let's all go to Jerusalem Paul Barnabas let's go up there Peter let's go have a conference and figure this thing out are the Seven Seals open or are they not have the seven Thunders been revealed or not right we need some conferences praise God Hallelujah now remember those first seven weeks that was removable zerubo fulfilled that blue area that was 49 years and then it was 62 weeks until Jesus came on the scene his ministry started I'm sorry until Jesus died sorry that was this uh 69th week I'm sorry I still got the wrong thing on there and then God took a break after the 69th week and he insert the seven Church ages here's where he started building that Holy Mountain I was showing you praise God all right this is where I started again the the blood in Israel to build this Holy Mountain I should have put that mountain in there maybe next time I'll do that and then that last 70th week I don't believe that anymore I believe it's a full week but I'll skip past that now to give you a little bit of a background this is pretty intense here but just bear with me this is a timeline from about 1000 BC up until zervable right here think about this here's the profits to Northern Israel here's the pro there's the Kings of Israel uh the northern Kings these were all evil Kings here's the kings of Judah the southern part and look look how much Mercy Church I always love this here's 20 40 60 80 100 Years of Mercy because they tried to serve God they got a hundred years of Grace all because they didn't let Idols build up in their lives now may God help us not to build up Idols in our lives so we'll have Grace until either we go home in the Rapture or we go to the Grave whatever God's allowed us I think it's a beautiful image of that don't you and then God said of course prophets to Judah and these are the kings of Aram Damascus Syria we don't need to worry about that but anyways where was it here's yeah here's ruble so Israel the last king was zedekiah and they destroyed the temple right here all this time took place and then zero comes back right here he leads the return and he builds the Altar and the foundation and then they finish the house and then Ezra comes and teaches the people that Nehemiah builds the wall that's is that a helpful timeline now you have to say that for about an hour then you'd have a good understanding of that too I just wanted you to see it over the time I look at that timeline oh all Israel was dispersed to Babylon now they left a few poor people there remember and remember Turbo's Temple was much less Grand in decoration than Solomon's and it caused some people it caused the old-timers some sadness so again here's Solomon simple about the size Hera did about this size he did a lot bigger now I like this artist's idea this is what one artist thought was through bubble's uh Temple now look it's a lot smaller it's smaller than uh salma's and I understood why they only gave one measurement for his Gerber Temple it was 60 feet tall it didn't give the length of it it only said it's 60 feet tall so it was as tall as Solomons but we don't know if it's as big and of course it wouldn't have been as Grand because the elders cried they were weeping why can't why can't it be like it was under Solomon and God said why do you despise the day of small things can I say like this church this is a day of small things amen we're at the very top of the pyramid praise God yeah this is not the open door generation this is a day of small things small moves are gone Hallelujah not big groups of people small groups of people in other words let's not despise the day we live in let's be grateful let's Rejoice if it's a small Revival praise God Amen because at least we got a Revival Hallelujah if we're not denominations at least not we're at least we're not in cold uh worn out sinful churches thank God we got the Holy Ghost praise God hey man and so this room about first and all the people rejoiced that at least they have the burnt offering back at least we can sacrifice at least we can worship God again Hallelujah amen glory and then remember after this the government shut down building for 16 years so for 16 years they gave up and that's where the scripture came that we read here I'm gonna go back to Zechariah now this is where the scripture came first Zechariah 4 verse 6. then he answers speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord under this room will say not by might not but not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts so God has to encourage River you got the foundation the platform you got the alter he said but it's not going to be your might that finishes this work the holy spirit's going to finish this word and you know how the Holy Spirit did it he raised up two Prophets Zechariah and haggai I love this the Bible said they just didn't stand and watch and preach the Bible said they got in in the work as well that's not like a man of God where he's a preacher or whatever it is even if he's not preaching he'll say Amen to everywhere amen so I'm going to sit back and they're they're so stoked they're almost falling asleep but but if they're preaching they expect everybody to say Amen I don't like stuff like that yeah I like a prophet that gets right back in he gets right into the work like everybody else praise God he puts his nose in the grindstone just like everybody else Hallelujah that's a real prophet of God they had two Prophets and the Bible said they're prophesying calls them to prosper and finish the work quickly so as soon as those prophets started prophesying they said we're getting back to work I don't care if it's been 16 years since we put that last Stone on the phone Foundation we're going to put our past behind us amen church we can put our past behind us and let's see what God is speaking to us right now let's see if we can get some inspiration right now and let's go to finishing what God started in our lives maybe God hasn't answered a prayer for 16 years maybe it's been two years or five years or ten years let's trust God say God make me to prosper again prophesy to me speak to me I want your work to be finished in my life praise God Hallelujah I didn't get to this video I'll get this on Wednesday but when I preached on the Kings last week Kings must rely on the Lord you know it was ASA ASA served God so well that God gave him 10 years of peace not one war for 10 years I thought I was so blessed I'm like wow we had our last trial in 2018. with some some uh saints that really didn't like me spoke some awful things that made my life really hard really hard to preach but since then now I've had five years of Peace by God's grace but peace isn't just to sit back and do nothing the Bible said then ASA strengthened his kingdom he built walls around cities he put up Gates uh the Bible said he put up food and weapons in the garrisons in the cities in other words he got he strengthened himself in case there would be another War because there's always another War I don't like to say that I shouldn't smile about it either but there's good there comes more Wars right I like that God will give you times of peace and in those times of Peace you got to get strong in the Lord and the power of His might Hallelujah that's what God's done for us praise God that's right he's made us stronger these last five years we don't know less about the message we know more about the message praise God and all these attacks all these Winds of Doctrine now Bloom bod and we're just like okay keep blowing you're not blowing through this church Hallelujah it's exactly right because we're not babies the Bible said babies are tossed around by all these doctors is Tate playing right or not that's what a baby thinks about praise God but a real man of God knows the book of Acts he knows his foundation praise God he knows what the apostolic father is God he know where the real Homeland is hallelujah that's right Glory I always got to preach on at least once now there's Solomon's Temple look how much grander that is than that that's zero no wonder that some of those Old-Timers cried but God said don't despise small things right right I'm still in your midst I'm just doing a different thing Hallelujah in other words I'm only 400 years away I'm going to send the real temple of God Jesus stop worrying about the Natural Things the spiritual ones coming amen I'm coming myself after Prophet actor prophet and you receive him thank God for them he said but this time I'm coming myself Hallelujah so if you zoom in look it's all gold all gold top to bottom those wings in the terrible in the Holy place they reach up all the way to the ceiling it was so beautiful it filled it went from their wings went from the wall to the wall so much Glory so much Beauty look how tall this uh this labor is and they had 10 extra labors on the outside Moses just had one labor one real small labor this was grander in glory but God said don't despise small things Hallelujah the early church had 3 000 baptized on the day of Pentecost don't despise the damn small things when we get 17 baptized out in Junction City oh I thank God for what he's doing brother Levi because I didn't ask for it I didn't look for it God said it Hallelujah we got to see what God is doing right now praise God I think Simon's preaching for them this morning I'm not mistaken not mistaken he said Wayne can you come preach brother I said you just tell me when I'll come I said maybe we'll bring the whole church down that'd be a huge sacrifice now let me let me uh I'm gonna get to closing now in Zechariah 4 . person picture two he sees this picture at the beginning of the chapter two trees olive trees are feeding in to the oil so this lamp sand can give its light I love it two Prophets The Bible the Bible calls these anointed ones two prophets give inspiration to the church can receive the word of God and shine its light Hallelujah now in our day God only sent one brother Branham is that right but in this day they had Zechariah and haggian and through their preaching it brought the Saints to such a faith where they could believe the word of God and they could manifest the word of God to their age amen oh it's beautiful praise God what am I saying church I'm saying if you believe the Bible that I'm preaching you will be a light of Jesus Christ today amen this week you'll go to work this week you'll go home and you'll be a light of Jesus Christ wherever you are praise God I'm saying the anointing from this word the anointing from the Holy Spirit from the word of God will make you shine bright Hallelujah everybody will know you're a Christian praise God and that's what the Bible says what are these uh trees represented so the trees represent the Old Testament New Testament he said the Bible said they represent Hagia and Zechariah the candlesticks represent the seven Church ages and these also represent Moses and Elijah to come to Israel at the end time there's at least four types here Hallelujah now let's read Zechariah 4 6 again I thought I'd lay this in here I just had this thought this morning I thought that's a pretty good thought get down then the answer and speaking of me saying this is the word of Lord on this Ruble saying not by might uh nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts as he searched every believer God is going to ask them to trust in God like I said last Sunday to rely on the Lord can't rely on the world can't rely on your finances can't rely upon your education because I forgot it all anyway I paid all that money I forget everything I learned I can't rely on that it's nonsense but every believer Drew will had to recognize listen something's God's doing something here but I can't do it it's got to be the Holy Spirit I thought about all these types of the Rapture Sarah in her own might she said oh Abraham take Hagar we'll bring forth this promised son but God said Sarah not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts amen church we all try to figure it out sometimes how can this happen how will this person get saved how bring this to pass how I make it financially how I do this in my spiritual life how I know the gifts of God in my life let the Holy Spirit figure it out for you praise God seek God until God reveals it to you in other words don't try to bring it to pass see and what was it what was God's spirit God's spirit was God coming in a body Discerning Sarah's heart he said no sir you did lie but I'll visit you next year according to the time of life amen amen glory oh I made me shout this morning Rebecca it wasn't by her my or her power the Holy Spirit moved her to be an answer to that man of leisure's Prayer think about that when was the last time you're an answer to somebody's prayer hopefully not too long ago I was just yesterday I put that video out about marriage and divorce and the preacher said oh my that's exactly what I was studying on now I'm going to preach on marriage and divorce tomorrow that's an answer to my prayer glory amen gotta be led by the Holy Spirit praise God see God moved her God made her go up and say um can I serve you and your camels rather than saying what can you do for me look I was something from you no make yourself a servant praise God did it and then she wanted the camels that was going to Care to her brother and praise God not by might not by power but by the spirit of God hallelujah Hallelujah so see we see serving others is getting under the spirit of God watering 10 camels that's quite a how about like filling uh 10 cars with gas that's the kind of what it's like way harder than that too way harder you're going to sweat a lot more carrying the water to camels Rahab Rahab couldn't break down any walls it was wasn't by her apology do you think she's out there with that red cord smacking the Wall come on go down go down go down no she had to get she had to beg people come on in get under the token it's token time get on the token Joshua's coming Josh was coming but also Deliverance is coming for all God's people who are under the token praise God she couldn't Break Down The Walls the spirit of God had to do that but she could get her family under the token again witness to your family praise God you can pray with your family right right that's what I found lately like even with brother Chris last week he come I was looking for any type any spiritual thing I could do so in there he was talking about his sister I just said let's pray for her I'm just looking for any opportunity I can pray for somebody speak the word of God I share two scriptures with him last night I just want to get in the spirit of God and try to be a blessing and help and maybe God will hear that prayer for his sister right I just want to get people we're not going to get them on their token let's be inviting to church unless we pray for them let's be invited into Bible studies lest we invite our neighbors over for our meal today which we did I don't know the man said he might come he said the family's busy but hopefully there'll be another by God's grace Hallelujah yes sir couldn't be by her might or her power be by the Holy Spirit what the Holy Spirit say fast and pray for three days and then I'll give you favor to go into the king unannounced you should die but the spirit is pronounced life Hallelujah is by my spirit saith the Lord family mistreated me they gave me the worst jobs and then one day Solomon rides by and said whoa girl what's her name Brothers you go find her name she's she's the one only one of her mother the Bible said she's the one she's the one of a kind there's nobody like her saw me just riding by all of a sudden that that that's her Hallelujah and God rescued her it wasn't by her might or her power it wasn't my argument the family I don't want to be a Shepherd anymore she just did what her parents told her and then God pulled her out of the Maori clay Hallelujah amen Simon made her bride Hallelujah amen say You're beautiful head to toe praise God Spirit gave her favor in other words the Holy Ghost comes looking for you amen amen God's goodness is running after you brother sisters God's goodness is running after you praise God you can't make it happen yourself trust in the Holy Spirit now remember the couch song comes with shouties this reminds me of first Thessalonians 4 16. the Lord himself descends with the shout voice Trump and when drumable put that last Stone on imagine putting that stone on everybody was shouting Grace Grace isn't that something when a real believer who's fulfilling prophecy Sees God Hand go to work they don't say look what I've done they said it was Grace thank God for Grace Hallelujah look what we did it wasn't that look what God did Hallelujah so the whole time they're shouting God gave us favor you gave us favor you you let your face shine upon us you immersed with us you loved us despite our 16 years of absence from doing anything you're the one who loved us it was your grace it was your power they were giving God praise they were shouting because of God's faithfulness that's what we need to do praise God Glory God's faithfulness is going to bring us through Bill Graham said what is a shout he said it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's the show the message is going on Hallelujah the Mysteries are finished the hearts of the fathers are being turned back Glory be baptized in Jesus name praise God leave those denominations believe in a supernatural God God's the same yesterday today and forever praise God Amen amen that's what God's people feed on the Living Word of God hallelujah remember Church there's three brother said that Jesus does all three of these while he's descending so I don't know I don't know how to explain this and this is one area I need to grow and I was sharing this with the church somehow Jesus is doing this while he's descending that's all that's all I know that's what the Bible says the Lord himself shall descend with a shout so something something with the rashers already happened I don't know Hallelujah he's descending now because the shout is going forward get my bride ready praise God the marriage of the Lamb has come Hallelujah get the bride ready praise God amen and then there'll be a voice and the Bible says the voice of an archangel and Michael the Archangel rebuked Satan for trying to get the body of Moses in other words the Archangel protected the resurrected bodies Hallelujah and that's what he'll do to the Archangel here will not uh he'll not uh protect the glorified bodies he'll call the glorified bodies that's exactly right praise God the voice of the Archangel and then the Trump of God 's trumpet angel the Bible said it will be changed caught up in a moment in a twinkle or not to go to the marriage suffer the lamb I'm at an hour and a half hopefully I'm not wearing you out there but I said the voice he said the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught together and he said the Trump is the trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper the Lambs supper with the bride in the sky Glory now remember what does grace mean grace could mean the former letterings but I like this definition of grace for the grace of God that brings salvation at the pier to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly love we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present World in other words the people are shouting Grace thank God I could live holy Jesus helped me live holy before the the Capstone was placed down Hallelujah Jesus help me live a righteous life in the midst of laodicea in the midst of Satan's eating God's grace help me to live soberly so I wasn't joking my way through life but I was a sober sincere Christian looking for that glorious appearing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the church said he might redeem us from all iniquity I just want to remind you if there's iniquity in your life just keep serving God sometimes people will say well I can't get over this sin I'll stop coming to church or I'll stop reading my Bible because I can't get a victory and I'll stop contacting the Saints because I don't want to defile them that's the wrong attitude keep coming to the hospital yes right there's a lot of people that go to hospitals they don't get healed the first time they go right or the first day they're there right but if they really want to get well they'll probably stay at the hospital this is God's spiritual Hospital praise God don't let Satan try to discourage you well you're not as holy as Russell well of course you're not you're just a new believer you battled through other things maybe they didn't battle through the things you battled through just keep trusting God he promised to redeem you from all iniquity amen that's the word he remember he's already forgiven you he already paid for all your sins he's just got to help you to learn to overcome your sins because you got to be an overcomer [Music] as we try to get you to see not not all overcoming happens in one day that's right I wish every overcoming happened in one day that'd be awesome man I no longer struggle with that mind battle I no longer say those that words I no longer think that I only think pure thoughts all the time I wish that was true right but what is it it's going to be Grace Grace favor favor from God almighty the Bible says God gives more grace God resists us when we're proud but he gives us grace to the humble amen draw night to God he'll draw an eye to you ah I guess I'm going to go ahead and close I'm gonna skip all this I preach this Jesus of the Capstone I want to call it just goes with a simple thought we've seen all those temporals zero will finish that Temple the people shouted and said Grace Grace what a service that was my goodness Hallelujah we can worship again now we can go to the holiest of holies the whole thing is finished the temple of God is finished and one day God's Temple will be finished in that Holy City amen amen but when that temples finished the Bible said there will be no physical Temple therein that Holy City we saw that Larkin drawing there there'll be no Temple up there think about that most had a tabernacle Solomon's room of them Harris Temple Israel's gonna rebuild another during the tribulation and those are all fine but that's not what God is going to those are all symbols of what God is trying to get to get us to see God is trying to get us to see that there was only one Temple the Bible said the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it the father and son are the temple Hallelujah amen because the father's invisible Hallelujah but the son is visible the sun is the temple and the father comes to live in him and then the city had no need of the son neither the moon to shine for the glory of God to Enlighten it and the lamb is the light thereof the temple is the light Jesus is the temple Jesus is the light Jesus Jesus is everything for us listen to our feet musicians can come by God's grace we rejoice in zarubal's Temple we also Rejoice that one day this spiritual Temple is going to be finished that last soul is going to come in and Jesus is going to sweep down and Rapture up his church he's going to take this habitation this Temple the spiritual House of God he's going to Rapture this Temple off the Earth and then he's going to bring it back down for a thousand years of Peace amen glory now how many want to be on Temple in the Holy Spirit today amen that's what I want to be by the grace of God let's buy our heads Saints as we pray tell the Lord that say Lord I want to be your temple today I want to be your habitation Hallelujah I want your spirit to dwell in me Hallelujah Lord that's our prayer today Heavenly Father Lord God we thank you for today Lord Jesus Lord all these images help us so much we see what you've done and we see what you're going to do Lord God [Music] Hallelujah Grace Grace is going to be shouted out one day at the rapture imagine we'll be shouting that out as we're our bodies are swallowed up death is swallowed up in life and we're heading up to the meeting in the air where we're starting oh Grace Grace favor favor thank you Jesus for your grace in my life I sure didn't deserve it it wasn't by my might or my power or my spirit but it was by the Holy Spirit Lord we humble ourselves and recognize your spirit brought us to this church
