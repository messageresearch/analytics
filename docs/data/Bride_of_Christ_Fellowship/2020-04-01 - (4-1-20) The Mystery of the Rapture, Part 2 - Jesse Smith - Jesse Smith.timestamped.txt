[15:39] thank you praise God
[15:50] let's take a few prayer requests
[15:53] children just think if we have any new
[15:55] ones real quick
[15:56] as far as announcements Lord willing
[15:58] this Sunday we'll do the same schedule
[16:00] as the last two Sundays we'll have one
[16:03] Sunday morning service unless the
[16:06] governor changes something he may change
[16:10] something we'll see so it seems like
[16:12] right now we're allowed to have 10
[16:14] people in a service as long as we keep
[16:16] our distance or 6 feet so we'll keep
[16:20] doing that as long as God allows us you
[16:23] know through the laws of man and so
[16:24] forth I just want to encourage you know
[16:27] Church this is not the first time you
[16:30] know the bride of Jesus Christ has been
[16:32] told not to attend church you know we we
[16:35] know what happened during the Spanish
[16:36] Flu time you know what happened numerous
[16:39] times down through the history you know
[16:41] the days of Martin Luther the true Bride
[16:44] of Christ has always had to deal with
[16:45] these things
[16:46] it doesn't stop us from serving the Lord
[16:49] it's just a temporary thing we know or
[16:53] we believe by God's grace at at some
[16:54] point this virus will pass like all the
[16:56] other ones the Lord willing and then
[16:59] we'll be back gathering physically more
[17:01] as we see that day approaching but we
[17:03] can still gather often through
[17:05] livestream by God's grace so we're
[17:07] thankful for that so let's see if we

[29:03] god was here today let's go to the first
[29:07] thessalonians chapter 5 Lord willing
[29:20] tonight I'd like to teach on the mystery
[29:22] of the rapture part 2 maybe you remember
[29:24] part one who's back in February I think
[29:26] February 21st or 22nd I was having some
[29:33] good conversation with brother cam and
[29:35] brother Simon this week and had some
[29:37] other thoughts about the rapture we like
[29:40] to look at this mystery and of course
[29:43] I'm preaching from my notes from the
[29:45] forthcoming book whenever it finishes
[29:47] the Lord willing
[29:50] first thessalonians chapter 5 verse
[29:52] longer worried verses 1 and 2 and then
[30:14] we want to read our memory verse from
[30:15] Romans 12 oh it's a / ok so praise God
[30:20] to reach out to sister Naomi if you're
[30:24] on there if you're listening live stream
[30:26] after we reach out to you for a memory
[30:28] verse Lord willing by God's grace amen
[30:32] so let's read 1st Thessalonians 5 1 & 2
[30:37] together then we'll read our memory
[30:39] verse from sister Wendy Romans 12:1 and
[30:42] 2 so let's begin on three one two three
[30:47] but of the times and the seasons
[30:49] brethren you have no need that I write
[30:52] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[30:55] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[30:59] thief in the night
[31:01] praise God no that'll be our scripture
[31:03] for tonight but let's read I remember
[31:04] there's Romans 12 Romans 12:1 and 2
[31:32] Romans 12:1 and 2 to 3 that together on
[31:35] three one two three I beseech you
[31:39] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[31:42] that you present your bodies a living
[31:45] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[31:49] is your reasonable service and be not
[31:54] conformed to this world but be
[31:56] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[31:59] that ye may prove what is that good and
[32:03] acceptable and perfect will of God let's
[32:06] have a word of Prayer before we see it
[32:07] heavily father we've read your word we
[32:09] sang your songs I feel your presence or
[32:12] just anoint me to preach your word may
[32:13] that people receive it and bless us in
[32:15] your divine presence we love you Lord
[32:17] prepares for that coming of the eye
[32:19] rapture in Jesus Christ name the church
[32:21] said amen god bless you beans in the
[32:23] breeze go where do you why you're going
[32:27] to give me a tissue from my office I was
[32:29] in tissue so I like to just review just
[32:33] for five minutes real quick part one and
[32:39] I think you'll be rather familiar with
[32:42] it oh yeah but before we do the review I
[32:50] want to just give the update on the
[32:52] coronavirus you probably saw you've been
[32:55] paying a lot of attention to it
[33:00] really spreading in certain cities you
[33:04] know like New Orleans and Detroit as
[33:07] well as New York but I saw one article
[33:10] today that said in New York it's
[33:12] starting to kind of flatline a little
[33:13] bit so we're just continuing watching
[33:17] and praying for people the president
[33:21] yesterday said that in two weeks we'll
[33:23] probably see the biggest spike thank you
[33:30] and that may be because of the he said
[33:33] the the tests will be more available in
[33:37] about two weeks so just want to keep
[33:42] praying for people and we want to keep
[33:44] the same perspective I believe Church
[33:46] this is one of the Sorrows is probably
[33:49] one of them ending Sorrows because Jesus
[33:52] told us the beginning of Sorrows was
[33:53] 2000 years ago rather the beginning of
[33:58] Sorrows was during the time of the black
[34:01] horse rider under the third seal and
[34:05] that carries over now into the fourth
[34:06] seal cuz it's such a short seal and so
[34:09] the coronavirus is one of the continual
[34:12] Sorrows that this world has to endure
[34:15] because of Satan's wickedness but just
[34:18] to keep just keep it in perspective
[34:19] Church four thousand seven hundred fifty
[34:23] nine have lost their lives in America
[34:27] now keep in mind the president's the
[34:30] president and his department said this
[34:34] they are they're gonna they're gonna
[34:36] increase drug trafficking by the border
[34:39] and also in the in the waters the
[34:42] southern southern waters and their
[34:46] experts said seventy thousand people
[34:49] died a year from overdosing on drugs
[34:52] seventy thousand so just keep that in
[34:55] mind and remember over six hundred
[34:58] thousand died from abortions that's just
[35:00] the procedure
[35:01] there's millions more that died from the
[35:06] abortion pill just taking the pill so we
[35:12] are
[35:13] powerful about the krona buyers but
[35:15] we're also sorrowful about drug
[35:18] addiction and abortion whether it's
[35:21] through procedure or the the pill God
[35:25] may just God have mercy so churches
[35:27] continue to pray keep praying for the
[35:29] leaders of our government for the
[35:30] Supreme Court keep praying for sinners
[35:33] to be saved and of course use wisdom as
[35:36] we talked about always use wisdom so I
[35:40] just want to give update on that now
[35:43] let's review the last time we preach on
[35:45] the mystery of the rapture do you guys
[35:47] have battles greed will probably after
[35:50] we get done with the reviewers just take
[35:52] a few moments we'll have like a Bible
[35:54] study we'll go through some scriptures
[35:56] here we showed how the rapture is it's
[36:04] going to be the last mystery that is
[36:06] actually fulfilled in real time because
[36:09] it's the last event of the Gentile
[36:12] dispensation once Jesus has snatched
[36:14] away his Gentile bride he cuts off the
[36:17] Gentiles and he returns he grafts back
[36:20] in the Jews that's why it's my last
[36:24] chapter in the book it's defined as the
[36:27] literal day and hour of Jesus Christ
[36:29] returned to the air to resurrect the
[36:32] dead in Christ and then also to
[36:34] translate those that are alive and well
[36:37] that our Holy Ghost filled Christians he
[36:40] takes them then after the marriage in
[36:41] the sky takes them to the the wedding
[36:44] reception the marriage supper of the
[36:45] lamb and has the judgment seat of Christ
[36:49] where rewards are given out and have
[36:52] communion with his his people praise God
[36:57] Paul literally caused this rapture a
[36:59] mystery in first Corinthians 15 that was
[37:01] our text last time and God promised the
[37:05] mysteries would be finished in
[37:06] Revelation 10 7 then taken around the
[37:08] world verses 8 through 11 and then acts
[37:12] 3:21 Jesus will sit on the throne until
[37:16] the restitution or restoration of all
[37:18] things which must include doctrine must
[37:21] include teaching and power of the Holy
[37:23] Ghost which were a part of that by the
[37:26] grace of them
[37:27] Lord the word rapture is not in the New
[37:31] Testament I'm sorry it's not in the King
[37:33] James but we know the definition is so
[37:35] we still use it just as a word that
[37:37] helps us to understand all of our
[37:39] Christian friends and then we ended last
[37:42] time we enter the last service about the
[37:45] rapture with the six reasons the rapture
[37:47] is pre-tribulation I went really fast
[37:50] through those but again there's a
[37:51] youtube video on that I think our church
[37:53] understands that but I just wanted to
[37:56] lay down the general purposes as
[37:58] reminders in case anybody asks you about
[38:00] it I've had denominational friends even
[38:03] from Canada contact me about that video
[38:05] it was a great help to them and then
[38:07] they preached what I taught on the video
[38:09] and they gave me a shout-out in the
[38:11] video so I don't know if I still have
[38:14] that sermon saved it was a couple years
[38:15] ago but a Baptist brother he disagreed
[38:19] about brother Branham but he believed
[38:21] brother I'm talking about the
[38:22] pre-tribulation rapture so that was
[38:26] encouraging and then we closed by
[38:28] looking at the steps for the body change
[38:30] but the hos they asked me to preach that
[38:31] again so we looked at the steps and how
[38:34] the dead in Christ rise and so that
[38:38] would be the the dead in Christ come
[38:41] down within their theophanies to come
[38:43] down get their their glorified body
[38:47] their glorified corporal body and those
[38:50] three bodies unite and then Lord willing
[38:53] we would see them soon after that our
[38:57] rapture would take place our physical
[39:00] bodies would be swallowed up in a
[39:02] glorified body and then that glorified
[39:04] body would go to the air to meet Christ
[39:06] where we would combine with our
[39:09] theophany body or celestial body so that
[39:12] was the order of the body change by
[39:16] God's grace so now that's a quick review
[39:18] so let's look at tonight's thoughts by
[39:21] the grace of the Lord I just want to
[39:25] prove to you that anyone who teaches the
[39:30] rapture already happened is teaching
[39:33] false doctrine and a lot of people
[39:35] around the message do a lot of people
[39:37] say the rapture happened
[39:39] in 63 when the cloud came down and they
[39:43] take some quotes that brother Bram said
[39:44] you know Christ looking down upon his
[39:46] bride and they say Christ is here the
[39:49] rapture Artie took place now that's
[39:50] wrong that's a false doctrine anyone who
[39:53] holds that doctrine and believes it will
[39:55] ultimately go into some form of sin
[39:57] whether it's pride lust of the eyes or
[40:00] pride of life or I'm sorry lust of the
[40:02] flesh one of those and often we see it
[40:04] is the pride of life where believers
[40:07] around the message will think they're
[40:08] more holy or better than other people
[40:12] rather than remaining humble and being
[40:14] meek and being sweet they become
[40:17] hardened and prideful and they they fail
[40:20] to move on with God and so we want to
[40:23] avoid that but let's go to 2nd Timothy 2
[40:25] 17 and 18 2nd Timothy 2 17 and 18 so why
[40:43] don't my oldest Lydia won't you read
[40:45] that for me concerning the truth of
[40:57] Aaron saying that the resurrection is
[40:58] passed on ready and and overthrow the
[41:01] faith of son now look at this church I'm
[41:04] a Gnaeus and philetus were teaching that
[41:06] the rapture already happened and it
[41:08] caused a lot of people to lose their
[41:10] faith so see when when people say the
[41:14] Raps already happened
[41:15] it makes them lose their watching and
[41:19] praying attitude it makes them lose that
[41:22] desire to meet Christ in the air and so
[41:26] they lose they fall away from their
[41:28] faith they fall away from believing and
[41:31] then the Bible said a false doctrine
[41:34] like this is like a flesh-eating disease
[41:36] like gangrene like a canker so see false
[41:40] doctor will eat someone alive from the
[41:42] inside out causing many to lose their
[41:45] faith that's why we have burning hearts
[41:48] for people around the message that teach
[41:50] false doctrine and you see it in their
[41:53] lives that
[41:53] false doctrine spiritual you and I we're
[41:56] either growing in grace or growing this
[41:59] way with a false doctrine and it eats
[42:02] away our love for the Lord because we
[42:04] have to keep our first love if we don't
[42:06] keep our first love with the truth of
[42:08] the word of God that evil spirit will
[42:11] eat away our love for God our zeal our
[42:14] fruit of the Spirit and we become
[42:16] something that we shouldn't be we become
[42:18] a lukewarm Christian and we don't want
[42:20] to become that we want to be a non-fire
[42:22] Holy Ghost filled Christian growing in
[42:24] grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[42:27] Christ so I want to start by showing
[42:29] that a false teaching about the rapture
[42:32] saying I already took place it will lead
[42:35] to a addiction for a sin for a sin
[42:39] loving life whether it's loving pride
[42:41] exalting oneself or lust of the flesh or
[42:44] lust of the eyes okay so I want to make
[42:49] sure I say that and of course brother
[42:51] Ram didn't believe that why would he
[42:53] preach the rapture in December of 65 a
[42:55] few weeks before he died about the
[42:59] rapture and to get the people ready for
[43:01] the rapture why would he preach that if
[43:02] he believed the rapture already took
[43:04] place of course it didn't of course it
[43:06] didn't and of course in his book he
[43:08] talks about that in the church age book
[43:10] written right before he died about being
[43:13] ready for the rapture the rapture is in
[43:14] the future it hasn't happened yet but
[43:16] RAM said all the gifts remain in the
[43:18] church preachers will preach until the
[43:21] Lord returns but we still have gifts
[43:22] operating right people being healed
[43:24] people being saved discernments right
[43:27] with their sermons and our church words
[43:29] of the Lord all these things they they
[43:31] continue until the Lord returns alright
[43:35] now that's the first point I want to
[43:37] make and now I want to kind of move over
[43:38] to my notes again and preach from these
[43:42] thoughts that we've uh that the Lord has
[43:46] given me as I've meditated and and
[43:48] parade and written for the glory of God
[43:51] I guess I kind of feel like this in my
[43:54] own little primitive way the Holy Spirit
[43:56] said pick up your pen and write
[43:58] in a very humble simple way and that's
[44:03] what people have told me Church so I got
[44:05] some and you know it
[44:07] I got two testimonies back where people
[44:09] said when I read your book it was like
[44:11] the Lord Jesus was talking to me
[44:14] directly himself no that's not me that's
[44:17] people telling me that people saying
[44:19] that Christ wrote that book so I trust
[44:22] by the grace of the Lord that it was
[44:24] much of it was inspired and it helps
[44:26] people but in my own humble way I feel
[44:28] like that's what the Lord has called me
[44:29] to do and of course the evidence is on
[44:31] writing the YouTube scripts for the
[44:33] videos and then preaching those first
[44:35] preaching those to you where you receive
[44:37] it we receive it we rejoice in it sets
[44:39] us free keeps us free keeps just growing
[44:41] and Grace and knowledge of the Lord but
[44:43] RAM said the teaching the deep teaching
[44:44] of the word makes you more established
[44:46] in the faith we're not tossed by every
[44:49] wind of false doctrine and the Holy
[44:51] Spirit keeps our church clean praise God
[44:53] drives out the evil spirits so that we
[44:55] can rejoice and have peace and serve God
[44:58] with peace and love in our hearts praise
[45:00] the Lord now so the next part after in
[45:03] the in the chapter after the six reasons
[45:07] of the raptures pre-tribulation I felt
[45:09] led to go into the times and seasons of
[45:12] the rapture
[45:15] now Paul Paul clearly says you and I
[45:19] will know the times and seasons of the
[45:23] rapture jesus said we won't know the day
[45:25] or hour okay so that means but that
[45:29] could mean though we might know the week
[45:31] we might know it's the week we might
[45:33] know it's the month we might know it's
[45:36] the year right but we'll definitely know
[45:39] the season remember the Lord told Sarah
[45:44] glory
[45:45] the Lord said I'll visit you this time
[45:48] next year according to the time of life
[45:50] so she knew the time and season of this
[45:53] coming of a son praise God hallelujah
[45:56] there it is a minute I didn't have that
[45:57] a moment my notes I need to get that in
[46:00] there praise the Lord it's the time it's
[46:03] the season we'll see the son getting
[46:06] ready to be produced praise God amen
[46:09] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[46:12] let's see Paul is very bold right after
[46:15] saying you're gonna be caught up the
[46:17] moment wink of an eye a shot voice Trump
[46:19] he says brethren you know the times and
[46:22] seasons Christ is gonna come snatches
[46:24] his wife away okay now let's go back to
[46:29] 1st Thessalonians 5 I'm gonna read
[46:30] verses we start at verse 3 for when they
[46:34] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[46:36] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[46:40] upon a woman with child so that's what
[46:43] we're talking about with the coronavirus
[46:44] it's like birth pains right these
[46:45] sorrows and they're just gonna increase
[46:48] right that's just what this that's just
[46:50] what that's what the Bible says as a
[46:52] woman approaches the time to deliver a
[46:54] child the the pains increase and so
[46:58] that's what Paul says and they shall not
[47:01] escape but ye brethren are not in
[47:04] darkness that the day should overtake
[47:07] you as a thief so Paul gives this
[47:09] beautiful illustration calling
[47:12] unbelievers in darkness but calling
[47:15] believers as light we still got some
[47:17] light outside I'm not afraid to go out
[47:20] there right but one or two in the
[47:22] morning I might be little nervous to go
[47:24] outside without a light okay that's how
[47:27] that's how the rapture is we will see it
[47:29] plainly it just as I can see the I can
[47:33] see the house I can see the cars just as
[47:36] I can see that so plainly we'll see the
[47:38] rapture so plainly it'll be so plain and
[47:41] clear it won't overtake us as a
[47:43] nighttime surprise he said ye are the
[47:49] children of light and sugar in the day
[47:50] we are not of the night nor of the
[47:52] darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[47:54] others do let us watch it me sober for
[47:58] they that sleep sleep in the night and
[47:59] they that be drunken or drunk of the
[48:01] night but let us who are of the day be
[48:02] sober putting on the breastplate of
[48:04] faith and love and for an helmet the
[48:08] hope of salvation for God hath not
[48:11] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[48:13] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who
[48:16] died for us that whether we wake or
[48:18] sleep we should live together with him
[48:21] hallelujah
[48:22] many beautiful promises in this
[48:25] a portion but I I just bring out two
[48:28] points in this next chapter sinners are
[48:31] unaware of the rapture just like a
[48:34] drunken sleeping robbery victim is
[48:37] caught off guard by a nighttime thief
[48:42] Jesus teaches the same idea about the
[48:45] days of Noah because they were lost and
[48:49] they were eating drinking marrying right
[48:51] up until the flood came and took them
[48:54] away
[48:55] no idea Paul says they're like sin if
[49:00] the sinners are like sleeping drums so
[49:03] that's the first thing for the time and
[49:06] season sinners I just have no no clue
[49:09] just like the days of Noah and they'll
[49:13] be saying this they'll be sleeping and
[49:15] busy marrying giving in marriage and
[49:17] eating and drinking and getting drunk
[49:19] all that nonsense and then Paul says
[49:22] they're gonna be saying peace safety
[49:24] peace safety in other words they're not
[49:26] going to be ready they're not gonna be
[49:28] aware that judgments coming they're
[49:30] gonna say oh it's all gonna be peaceful
[49:31] it's alright we're just we won't need to
[49:33] be safe I got the whole time God is
[49:35] pressing to his little bride I'm gonna
[49:37] rapture you from the destruction I'm
[49:39] gonna take you from the destruction so
[49:41] the the bride is here and get ready get
[49:43] ready the bridegroom is coming out go
[49:47] you have to meet him destructions coming
[49:50] that's that's what the bride is hearing
[49:52] but the world's just ignored a saying
[49:53] all we're gonna be happy we're gonna
[49:55] have peace we're gonna be safe it shows
[49:58] that they're totally contrary to what
[50:01] the Holy Spirit is telling the bride
[50:02] today the Holy Spirit is saying watch
[50:04] pray trim your lamps make sure you have
[50:07] oil go out to meet the bridegroom
[50:09] because destruction is coming you don't
[50:10] want to be left out and they're saying
[50:12] oh we're gonna live here our whole lives
[50:14] and peace and safety all nice things now
[50:22] you can see
[50:23] ditions match the days of Noah as we
[50:26] just said there's other descriptions as
[50:29] well in the days of Noah scoffers Peter
[50:32] said they'll be scoffers mocking the
[50:35] second coming of Jesus Christ
[50:37] so we seen people do that all the time
[50:41] the conditions of Noah violence
[50:45] attractive women and sons of God falling
[50:49] for attractive women who are Christians
[50:51] because it's all right to be a pretty
[50:54] woman it's okay to be pretty as long as
[50:56] you dress modestly but it's wrong for a
[50:58] child of God a man to go after a woman
[51:02] just because she's good-looking and
[51:03] she's not a real Christian doesn't have
[51:06] a real heart to serve the Lord and
[51:07] they'll have continual evil thoughts all
[51:11] they want to think about is evil evil
[51:13] evil lovers pleasures lovers of
[51:16] pleasures more than lovers of God also
[51:18] they think about as pleasures what they
[51:19] can do to have more pleasure
[51:21] another condition Jesus said it will be
[51:24] like a sodomite condition as the days of
[51:26] lot we see that increasing all the time
[51:27] more sodomy and more LGBT rights for
[51:32] them next many churches will come in a
[51:35] great falling away 2nd Thessalonians 2 3
[51:38] next men will love themselves more than
[51:41] lovers of God to be covetous boasters
[51:43] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[51:46] unthankful unholy without natural
[51:49] affection trucebreakers breakers rather
[51:52] false accusers incontinent fierce
[51:54] despisers of them that are good traitors
[51:57] heady highminded having a form of
[51:59] godliness but denying the power thereof
[52:03] of the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[52:05] Holy Spirit 2nd Timothy 3:1 2:7 also the
[52:09] other condition the gospel must be
[52:11] preached to all in the world Jesus said
[52:13] in Matthew 24:14 and Israel will be
[52:17] getting ready to return to God and
[52:19] she'll be seeking to control the Temple
[52:21] Mount in order to rebuild the temple
[52:24] according to revelation 11 1 and 2 so
[52:28] Paul says our only hope is to be
[52:32] spiritually awake and sober watching for
[52:36] Christ
[52:37] returned by having on the armor of God
[52:39] praise the Lord now in our fusion series
[52:42] were at the armor of God so I'm gonna
[52:44] skip that today we'll preach on at the
[52:46] Lord winning maybe Sunday but he
[52:48] mentions two pieces a breastplate of
[52:50] faith and love and righteousness
[52:54] remember a breastplate protects your
[52:56] heart right so Satan's trying to attack
[52:59] your heart but your heart is defended by
[53:01] the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen
[53:04] not our righteousness but Christ's
[53:06] righteousness amen and then also the
[53:12] hope the helmet of salvation the hope of
[53:15] salvation Church we should be constantly
[53:18] being thankful and hoping and trusting
[53:21] God is going to deliver us from the
[53:23] tribulation we got to keep that armor on
[53:25] his love will defend us his love will
[53:28] defend our hope and we'll be able to say
[53:31] I love Jesus He loves me he's going to
[53:33] bring me salvation praise God he's
[53:36] already given in my soul and he's gonna
[53:38] good physically as well he's gonna
[53:39] deliver me from the tribulation period
[53:41] praise God
[53:47] now I want to make a good point here
[53:51] mark I've even go to Matthew 11:12
[53:53] Matthew 11:12 but as he's going there
[53:57] it's so fitting that Paul says we must
[54:02] be alert soldiers so Paul says if you
[54:06] want to escape the tribulation you've
[54:07] got to be a soldier
[54:09] you got to have on the armor of God now
[54:14] what's what's wonderful is that soldiers
[54:22] use force right soldiers enforce the law
[54:26] right they carry out commands and they
[54:30] don't have to ask you if they've got
[54:32] permission right they're just soldiers
[54:34] are gonna do what they're commanded to
[54:35] do and so Paul uses a great illustration
[54:40] as a soldier who uses force were to use
[54:44] force in order to overcome this world
[54:50] so in other words if you want to be
[54:52] ready for the rapture you must be
[54:54] willing to fight for this privilege
[54:57] because God's most successful soldier
[55:00] Jesus Christ his son says the kingdom of
[55:04] God is experienced when the spiritual
[55:07] soldiers take it by force for his gods
[55:10] Malachi read matthew 11:12 praise God so
[55:22] Jesus says the kingdom of God which is
[55:24] the Holy Ghost the violent take it by
[55:27] force now the words take it by force in
[55:30] the Greek are the same words that Paul
[55:33] use for caught up will be caught up in a
[55:37] moment of trinken and I so Jesus used
[55:40] that same word harp harp Azzo I believe
[55:42] it is are pazzo to snatch away so jesus
[55:46] said the violent snatch away the kingdom
[55:48] of God praise the Lord other words the
[55:51] Lord has laid out promises and if if God
[55:54] has revealed it to us we can take that
[55:57] promise but we've got to grab it with
[55:59] our strong hand of faith praise God
[56:01] we've got to come against the devil and
[56:04] fight against him use our armor knock
[56:07] off all the darts and we've got to take
[56:09] that the promise of God and snatch it
[56:11] away praise God that's what Jesus says
[56:14] take the kingdom of God by force
[56:17] hallelujah
[56:18] as spiritual soldiers in other words if
[56:23] you want a better prayer life you go
[56:25] take it
[56:26] praise God if you want to know the Word
[56:28] of God brother Branham says two things
[56:30] if you want to get closer to God read
[56:31] your Bible and pray if you want to be
[56:34] closer to God you go take that Bible
[56:36] reading make time go take the Bible
[56:38] reading spend more time in the word
[56:39] praise God and I would encourage you
[56:41] this I've been meaning to say this for
[56:42] weeks and months if you're having
[56:44] trouble just start a journal or start
[56:47] writing your own books or like I do I
[56:49] found that to be such a way to meditate
[56:52] upon the scripture just write out like
[56:55] think you're gonna write out your own
[56:57] commentary on the Bible just meditate on
[56:59] it just stay in that word just fill
[57:02] journals and as you write just
[57:04] just right as you read rather the Bible
[57:06] right about it
[57:07] keep your mind stayed upon it you'll be
[57:09] surprised how you just meditate all
[57:11] throughout the day all throughout the
[57:13] days I'm talking and quotes will just
[57:15] come to me that I just add I email to
[57:17] myself to put in the book it's just it
[57:19] just comes to me because as you as you
[57:22] meditate and talk about Jesus his
[57:24] presence comes around praise God amen so
[57:28] if you want if you want more love go
[57:31] take it by force go go to your prayer
[57:33] closet as soon as the service is over
[57:34] praise God
[57:36] take it by force don't sit back and let
[57:39] the devil keep you from it take it by
[57:40] force like the rapture Jesus gonna take
[57:43] his bride by force amen
[57:45] the same Greek word snatch you away the
[57:48] the violent take it by force they take
[57:51] the kingdom of God and you know I want
[57:55] to say this to a lot of preachers are
[57:56] are preaching many good things you know
[58:00] in the midst of this coronavirus but
[58:03] then then people will try to get people
[58:05] to you know a lot of them are like kind
[58:09] of making them scared to get closer to
[58:10] God like using fear you better go and
[58:12] closer to God the church we should if
[58:15] you're a Holy Ghost field st. you should
[58:17] be so in love with God all the time that
[58:19] your walk with God no one has to use
[58:21] fear to get you to walk closer to God
[58:23] you should be in the prayer closet every
[58:25] day you should be reading your Bible
[58:27] every day
[58:28] but I've seen this over the last 20
[58:30] years of being around the message I'm
[58:31] almost I think it's nineteen years you
[58:34] know first it was worm lord around 2005
[58:36] people are using worm Lord to try to
[58:38] scare people a meteor named worm was
[58:40] gonna come and hit the earth and people
[58:42] around people in this message told me
[58:44] the earth is gonna end soon and then
[58:47] it's all these other things and now that
[58:50] was 2012 the Mayan calendar right and
[58:54] then it was a knots coronavirus people
[58:56] using all these fear tactics saying you
[58:59] better get close to God we should be
[59:00] constantly close to God praise God you
[59:03] shouldn't have to adjust your life
[59:04] because you should be born again praise
[59:06] God
[59:06] you should be filled with the Holy
[59:08] Spirit seeking God in your prayer closet
[59:10] reading your Bible praying falling more
[59:12] in love with Jesus meditating upon the
[59:14] promises of
[59:15] but see Church it just shows a lot of
[59:16] people aren't born again because they
[59:18] need something outside they need the
[59:21] enemy to make them get closer to God but
[59:24] we should have God in us making us fall
[59:27] in love more with God amen hallelujah
[59:29] praise the Lord amen
[59:32] Christ should be in our hearts by the
[59:34] Holy Spirit poured out upon our hearts
[59:36] and Christ the Holy Spirit should be
[59:39] making us fall more in love with him
[59:41] draw more closer to him that's one thing
[59:44] I want to preach I want to make sure you
[59:46] see that we don't that's why none of
[59:48] these things move me the corona virus
[59:50] and the wormwood didn't move me
[59:54] remember the the blood moons a few years
[59:56] ago that stressed me out for a few
[59:58] months but then the Lord gave me peace
[59:59] through brother Craig you know that's
[1:00:01] another thing people just they're using
[1:00:03] that to get the body to get you to buy
[1:00:05] the books or to get you to use fear to
[1:00:08] try to trust in them if you got the Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost jesus said the Holy Ghost guide
[1:00:12] you into all truth praise God and then a
[1:00:16] Holy Spirit in you it longs for
[1:00:19] fellowship right along forth your soul
[1:00:21] and so you meditate upon the things of
[1:00:24] God remember the Bible said commune with
[1:00:27] your own soul praise the Lord amen
[1:00:29] oh yeah oh I think that's good I hope
[1:00:32] everybody's watching tonight praise God
[1:00:34] by God's grace I this today I just all
[1:00:37] felt like preaching real good I felt the
[1:00:39] presence of the Lord amen hallelujah so
[1:00:43] see it's violent soldiers that rapture
[1:00:46] way or snatch away the kingdom of God
[1:00:49] hallelujah the church I still get emails
[1:00:55] all this week from Congo I got an email
[1:00:56] from Congo I told you Romania last week
[1:00:59] other brothers Africa brothers that the
[1:01:02] Word of God that's being preached and
[1:01:04] spread is blessing people helping people
[1:01:07] strengthening them see it's because it's
[1:01:10] the word the word the Spirit when we
[1:01:13] hear the word the Spirit will quicken
[1:01:14] that word to us it will guide us into
[1:01:17] all truth praise God and it's it's it's
[1:01:19] it's it's going out it will not return
[1:01:23] void praise God when the Word of God is
[1:01:25] spread it will find where it needs to go
[1:01:27] praise God
[1:01:28] such an encouragement see Christians are
[1:01:32] gonna snatch away their victories from
[1:01:34] Satan just as Jesus example snatch away
[1:01:38] his bride from the Antichrist Amen
[1:01:40] hallelujah thank the Lord praise God so
[1:01:44] any promise that is for everybody any
[1:01:47] promise that's fair but you got to
[1:01:48] snatch you away because you know it's
[1:01:51] it's yours God's revealed it to you that
[1:01:54] a prayer life and read your Bible is
[1:01:56] yours it's it's Scripture there's no one
[1:02:00] that's denied that the Holy Ghost being
[1:02:01] born again that's for everybody who's so
[1:02:03] ever will you can take that promise and
[1:02:05] say I know it's mine
[1:02:06] and you can take a hold of that but you
[1:02:09] got to take it by force praise God you
[1:02:11] got to make the choice
[1:02:12] hallelujah got to die to self amen and
[1:02:15] submit your will to God's will praise
[1:02:18] the Lord see Satan as many traps the
[1:02:22] Bible said he has traps and snares all
[1:02:27] around us The Devil's angels have been
[1:02:30] and always will continually be at war
[1:02:32] against our cause they war against us
[1:02:34] the Bible says but we are fully equipped
[1:02:36] and more than conquerors fighting the
[1:02:39] good fight of faith with our divine
[1:02:41] armor amen look at that next time by
[1:02:43] God's grace we'll see glory praise God
[1:02:46] amen thank you Jesus we set a timer here
[1:02:51] so I don't where everybody out now
[1:02:54] the next I went times and seasoned the
[1:02:57] book and I go where will the rapture
[1:02:59] take pray will take place it's a
[1:03:01] universal event so there's not one
[1:03:03] physical place now a lot of people think
[1:03:06] is Jeffersonville right today a lot of
[1:03:08] people might think it's the biggest
[1:03:09] message Church in America are the
[1:03:12] biggest Church in the Congo or the
[1:03:15] biggest that's the biggest one message
[1:03:16] Church in the whole world
[1:03:17] maybe it's the brother in Canada who
[1:03:19] knew brother Branham people people think
[1:03:22] it's a physical place but it's not it is
[1:03:25] a spiritual place praise God
[1:03:29] jesus said his rapture will be fast as
[1:03:32] lightning the Bible says in a moment in
[1:03:35] a twinkling of an eye there's no need to
[1:03:38] get gather physically for the exact
[1:03:41] moment
[1:03:42] of the rapture there'll be no no need to
[1:03:44] do that because it won't make any
[1:03:47] difference
[1:03:47] it'll happen so fast that's why we have
[1:03:50] to be born again
[1:03:52] so the spear inside of us helps us to
[1:03:54] know and understand that times in the
[1:03:56] season of the rapture
[1:03:58] just like those Amish women you know we
[1:04:00] have our Midwife that comes and delivers
[1:04:03] our babies they work with Amish mothers
[1:04:06] well the Amish mothers they don't know
[1:04:08] when their due date is you know whether
[1:04:10] it's April 5th or whatever they just say
[1:04:13] well they say it's about summer or those
[1:04:15] they'll just tell you the season or it's
[1:04:18] fall or winter see cuz they just work
[1:04:22] with seasons why because they've got a
[1:04:24] birth they've got a a seed growing
[1:04:26] inside of them amen that's just like you
[1:04:28] and I when we're born again of the seed
[1:04:30] of God we'll know the season praise the
[1:04:32] Lord amen
[1:04:33] oh no it's just about this that season
[1:04:36] to get ready for the rapture praise God
[1:04:41] see at the precise moment Jesus said
[1:04:44] there's going to be some people working
[1:04:46] in a field or sleeping in a bed Luke 17
[1:04:50] 34 and 36 there'll be two men in a bed
[1:04:53] one should be taken the other shall be
[1:04:55] left these must be brothers right or
[1:04:58] maybe a father and son or grandpa and
[1:05:00] son or grandpa and grandson because they
[1:05:04] couldn't be homosexual that's the
[1:05:06] thought I'm trying to get there because
[1:05:07] that's such a rampant thing evil thing
[1:05:09] in this day it would be two brothers or
[1:05:13] maybe two believers - single brothers
[1:05:16] maybe something like that one is take
[1:05:21] one's left - woman's to be grinding
[1:05:24] together the one should be taken the
[1:05:26] other left - will be in the field one
[1:05:28] taken one left
[1:05:29] Jesus has a similar thing in Matthew 24
[1:05:31] 40 and 42 - in the field one taken one
[1:05:34] left two women grinding at the mill one
[1:05:37] taken he says watch therefore for you
[1:05:39] know not what hour your Lord doth come
[1:05:42] praise God Church
[1:05:44] he may come while we're sleeping oh my
[1:05:47] would that be glorious - go to sleep and
[1:05:49] then to wake up it is present so you
[1:05:52] praise God thank you Jesus all that be
[1:05:55] glorious amen oh now here's a good beers
[1:05:58] of a good point - none of these people
[1:06:02] are at war right or tribulation I don't
[1:06:06] know you know praise God they're at work
[1:06:07] they're sleeping they're grinding at the
[1:06:10] mill they're just doing the daily tasks
[1:06:12] right so it's a good scripture to prove
[1:06:14] that the rapture takes place before the
[1:06:16] Tribulation Period praise God see we
[1:06:21] better pray before we go to bed make
[1:06:22] sure we're born again we better pray
[1:06:25] before the workday begins right every
[1:06:27] morning because he's coming back as
[1:06:29] quick as lightning amen
[1:06:31] doesn't matter where we physically are
[1:06:33] long as we got the oil or the wedding
[1:06:35] garment that's what matters the one
[1:06:40] spiritual location is to be in Christ if
[1:06:42] you're in Christ and that location
[1:06:45] you'll be in the rapture Romans 8:1
[1:06:47] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:06:49] are in Christ Jesus
[1:06:52] believers are in Christ when Christ art
[1:06:55] is in them praise God let me say it
[1:06:57] again believers are in Christ when
[1:07:00] Christ is in them hallelujah that's
[1:07:02] Colossians 1:27 Christ in you and me the
[1:07:06] hope of glory praise God Galatians 3:27
[1:07:09] Christians have been baptized into
[1:07:12] Christ because Christ demanded or
[1:07:15] commanded them to be baptized with the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost in acts 1:5 acts 1:5 Linnea
[1:07:24] can get that acts 1:5 a lot of people
[1:07:27] don't know this but Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:29] one who started the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:07:32] terminology that wasn't a
[1:07:35] denomination that was Jesus Christ Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ said you got to be baptized with
[1:07:40] the Holy Ghost so did John the Baptist
[1:07:41] he said I'm not worthy even to lose his
[1:07:44] shoes i baptize you with water but Jesus
[1:07:46] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:55] praise God Jesus and you'll be baptized
[1:07:57] you'll be immersed with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:00] in your soul not many days hence a man
[1:08:03] what a promise that's where we need to
[1:08:05] be if we're going to be in the rapture
[1:08:07] in Christ because Christ is in us
[1:08:11] Malachi John 14 let's go to John 14
[1:08:16] Jesus tell told them over and over he
[1:08:19] wanted to dwell in them now that would
[1:08:21] have been such a paradox right if I said
[1:08:24] the Malachi I want to be in you I'm
[1:08:27] gonna be in you Lydia I'm gonna be in
[1:08:29] you can you imagine just somebody saying
[1:08:31] that like a you know Jesus to the
[1:08:33] disciples but he says that John's 1417
[1:08:38] and then John 14:27 17 and 20 not even
[1:08:48] know it but he knows every truth with
[1:08:50] you shall be in you that day he should
[1:08:53] know Wow Jesus is in the Father read
[1:09:00] that again and you need and I in you
[1:09:08] Jesus is in the Father Jesus is in the
[1:09:11] believer and the believers in Jesus how
[1:09:14] there you go what does it by it's by the
[1:09:15] Spirit amen through the spirit praise
[1:09:19] God
[1:09:19] God's Spirit dwells in us and right and
[1:09:23] we're and that portion of God that's in
[1:09:26] us is actually a part of Jesus's spirit
[1:09:28] so that's the oneness praise God oh it's
[1:09:31] beautiful praise the Lord
[1:09:33] see Jesus was revealing that those
[1:09:36] believers were already in him those
[1:09:38] predestinated believers in his mind and
[1:09:40] his plan before the foundation of the
[1:09:42] world right Paul says the same thing God
[1:09:47] has chosen us
[1:09:48] in Christ before the foundation of the
[1:09:50] world that we should be wholly without
[1:09:52] blame before him in love amen hallelujah
[1:09:56] praise God for the revelation we're need
[1:09:58] to be to go in the rapture in Christ
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:01] hallelujah thank the Lord thank you
[1:10:04] Jesus glory now we do have some clues
[1:10:10] physically where we might be right we
[1:10:12] might be at work we might be in the bed
[1:10:15] but one place we'll be gathering a lot
[1:10:17] is the local church because the Hebrews
[1:10:20] 10:25 says Gavin even more as you see
[1:10:24] that Day approaching and Lydia's gonna
[1:10:25] read Matthew 24 28 Jesus says there's a
[1:10:29] gathering place a physical gathering
[1:10:32] place where we'll be out we'll be there
[1:10:34] a lot the rapture might happen there or
[1:10:37] it might happen while we're sleeping or
[1:10:38] out of the field let's read that Matthew
[1:10:41] 24 28 jesus says wherever the carcass is
[1:10:49] the fresh kill the fresh meat of the
[1:10:52] word that's where the Eagles are
[1:10:54] gathered amen praise God and you take
[1:10:57] that with Hebrews 10:25 the word is
[1:10:59] preached
[1:11:00] they'll be at church all the time
[1:11:02] feasting on the Word of God amen now
[1:11:06] remember it's the fivefold ministry that
[1:11:07] does that
[1:11:09] let's read malachi read Exodus 19 poor
[1:11:12] Exodus 19 4 so you see how God says he's
[1:11:17] a eagle well if we were if we take Jesus
[1:11:20] words we just read we were in the Eagle
[1:11:22] right cuz he said I and you and you and
[1:11:25] me so here's where God said he's an
[1:11:28] eagle good nothing amen
[1:11:37] so jesus said I bore you on eagle's
[1:11:38] wings and brought you unto myself so God
[1:11:42] takes credit I brought you to myself I
[1:11:44] carried you on eagle's on my wings and
[1:11:48] brought you to myself so if he's the
[1:11:50] Papa or mama Eagle were the eaglets
[1:11:53] right and we're feasting on the meat of
[1:11:55] God's Word now what is meat Hebrews 5:14
[1:11:58] Lydia Hebrews 5:14
[1:12:02] and that's where this this that's where
[1:12:05] teaching of the word is so important
[1:12:07] preaching is also equally important but
[1:12:10] teaching is so important because it will
[1:12:12] discern lie from air like someone
[1:12:17] someone was kind of upset one of the
[1:12:19] videos I made about the seven problems
[1:12:21] with the Jeffersonville movement they
[1:12:22] said how does this win anyone to Christ
[1:12:24] and you know like a critical spear so in
[1:12:26] love I wrote dear brother there's people
[1:12:28] that are worshipping brother branham and
[1:12:30] they might not even know it their idol
[1:12:33] worshippers and so this this doctrine or
[1:12:36] this this Bible based deep teaching of
[1:12:38] the video if they receive it will set
[1:12:41] them free and then they'll be saved
[1:12:42] praise God because they will be an
[1:12:44] idolatry they can't be born again if
[1:12:46] they're in I doubt her so this video can
[1:12:48] help release them from my idolatry so at
[1:12:51] least they can get saved and sanctified
[1:12:52] and filled with the Holy Ghost spray so
[1:12:54] that's how it's winning souls one
[1:12:56] doctrine at a time praise God
[1:12:58] line upon line word upon word precept
[1:13:01] upon precept here a little very little
[1:13:03] thank you Jesus amen sorry
[1:13:06] praise God all right Lydia Hebrews 5:14
[1:13:15] my reason is have their senses exercised
[1:13:18] to discern both good and evil so a
[1:13:20] Christian eating the meat of God's Word
[1:13:23] has strong ability to recognize sin from
[1:13:27] holiness they can discern very well
[1:13:31] little things little areas of sin in
[1:13:34] their lives and they can judge the
[1:13:36] sinful things like and then I had
[1:13:38] another comment where the brother was
[1:13:40] kind of criticizing me for trying to
[1:13:43] correct Jeffersonville and I said
[1:13:46] brother he said we need to stand
[1:13:48] shoulder to shoulder and you're judging
[1:13:51] them I said I'm not judging them I said
[1:13:52] I'd say right in there it's brotherly
[1:13:54] kindness but what about the scripture
[1:13:55] prove all things fruit not some things
[1:13:59] prove all things what about that
[1:14:01] scripture see and so it discerns it
[1:14:05] discerns that idolatrous spirit that
[1:14:07] loves to worship a man but we remember
[1:14:10] Elijah must decrease and Christ must
[1:14:13] increase amen
[1:14:15] there should be an increased emphasis on
[1:14:17] the word on the Holy Spirit on what God
[1:14:20] is doing on the truth of God's Word
[1:14:21] there should be an increase on that and
[1:14:23] not just leaning upon well brother
[1:14:26] Branham brother Branham I believe it's
[1:14:28] true he looked at brother Ram he points
[1:14:30] us to the word but not every word and a
[1:14:33] lot of people fall away from that fall
[1:14:36] away from the truth of going back to the
[1:14:38] word thank the Lord for that and so
[1:14:43] that's what the Holy Spirit is to do
[1:14:44] today is to discern false doctrine and
[1:14:48] when they and the fivefold ministry when
[1:14:51] they make just profit brother Branham
[1:14:53] and and I've got quotes were that the
[1:14:55] leadership says brother Branham
[1:14:56] fulfilled all the fivefold ministry now
[1:14:59] what does that do that takes all five
[1:15:01] away from everybody nobody can have a
[1:15:03] fivefold ministry gift and they say and
[1:15:05] they say the fivefold ministry has to
[1:15:07] catch the vision they've got to play the
[1:15:09] tapes and sit down and stop preaching
[1:15:11] now that breaks the Word of God and just
[1:15:13] break in one word look what it did to
[1:15:15] Eve back in the Garden of Eden just
[1:15:17] break in one word and here they are
[1:15:19] breaking four or five words to see meat
[1:15:22] the meat of God's Word discerns any
[1:15:25] little any little lie any false doctrine
[1:15:28] any Antichrist little spirit no discern
[1:15:31] it and I'll get the leaven out of the
[1:15:33] church praise God amen so if your eagle
[1:15:38] you want to feast on those type of
[1:15:40] things praise God because you want to
[1:15:43] know the discernment of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:45] for this hour that we're living in you
[1:15:49] can't remain in milk and expect to go on
[1:15:51] the rapture right Paul said in your milk
[1:15:54] you got to teach you this the original
[1:15:56] things over like like this prove all
[1:15:58] things I got to teach you that it that
[1:16:00] means everything I'm gonna teach people
[1:16:02] church we need to teach message people
[1:16:04] that like you've got to take everything
[1:16:06] brother Branham says and I say and you
[1:16:09] name the preacher tune through it
[1:16:11] Donnie Reagan and Bissell you got to
[1:16:13] take everything back to the word and
[1:16:15] just be sure it's the Word of God just
[1:16:23] like a eagle I have this in the book
[1:16:24] here just like a eagle is not gonna soar
[1:16:26] unless they eat me right there how they
[1:16:28] gonna get up to the sky if they're not
[1:16:29] eating the diet our message believers
[1:16:32] gonna fly above sin when they're not
[1:16:34] even feasting on the Word of God that's
[1:16:36] presented to them they're not reading
[1:16:38] their Bible or pray like we said if not
[1:16:40] even more in love with Jesus they're far
[1:16:42] more with the love with the pleasures of
[1:16:44] the world how they gonna fly how they
[1:16:46] gonna fly above sin they're not going to
[1:16:48] they got to get off the meat or I got
[1:16:51] off the milk and get on to the meat all
[1:16:57] right I've got 15 more minutes the Lord
[1:16:59] willing by God's grace let me see where
[1:17:01] I'm at
[1:17:01] okay good okay now let me let me go a
[1:17:09] little bit further here and then I just
[1:17:10] want to do the update on the border here
[1:17:14] oh the order before the rapture I just
[1:17:16] want to give just a little update on
[1:17:18] that just a moment but first why will
[1:17:20] the rapture occur this is the next
[1:17:21] section most of us are familiar Christ
[1:17:24] is snatching away his wife off the earth
[1:17:27] to rescue her from the awful awful wrath
[1:17:30] of wrath of God and so shall we ever be
[1:17:32] with the Lord the one thing we've
[1:17:34] desired is to always be with the Lord
[1:17:36] right remember the rapture scripture
[1:17:39] from Psalms 27 where David said in the
[1:17:43] time of trouble he'll hide me in the
[1:17:44] cleft of the rock remember that he said
[1:17:47] one thing I desired all the days what
[1:17:50] was it to dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:17:52] praise God then to be one of those
[1:17:55] Eagles gathered around the fresh meat of
[1:17:57] the word amen and feasted on the word
[1:17:59] all the time
[1:17:59] I know yeah that's what we see here so
[1:18:04] God's so Christ and bride is so in love
[1:18:07] with him once more of the word they
[1:18:09] always want to be with the word I always
[1:18:11] want to be with Christ he's gonna take
[1:18:13] him off the earth the Lambs wife made
[1:18:18] herself ready now let's go back to John
[1:18:22] 14 Lydia John 14:1 1 2 and 3 this shows
[1:18:26] why Christ is gonna rapture the bride
[1:18:28] because he wants our fellowship he wants
[1:18:31] our fellowship to continue for eternity
[1:18:33] so let me go ahead John 14:1 through 3
[1:18:36] let not your heart be troubled you
[1:18:39] believe in God believe also in me
[1:18:41] and my father's house are many mansions
[1:18:42] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:18:45] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:18:48] go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:18:49] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:18:51] that where I am there ye may also you
[1:18:54] may be awesome
[1:18:55] Amen Jesus wants his bride to be right
[1:18:58] there with him praise God hallelujah we
[1:19:00] are Pilgrims and strangers on this earth
[1:19:03] we're seeking a city we're seeking a
[1:19:06] home praise God the New Jerusalem
[1:19:08] hallelujah and Christ is going to be
[1:19:11] gone to prepare us that place praise God
[1:19:14] that's why the rapture was gonna happen
[1:19:15] he's gonna finish that place and he's
[1:19:17] gonna take us to that place amen
[1:19:21] remember Paul was so in love with Jesus
[1:19:23] he desired to depart and to be with
[1:19:25] Christ that was in Philippians 1:23 but
[1:19:29] he said he said for your sakes though
[1:19:31] I'll stay and keep ministering and
[1:19:33] preaching but he desired to depart and
[1:19:37] to be with Jesus amen now Jesus says in
[1:19:46] Revelation 3:10 because Las kept the
[1:19:48] word of my patience I will keep I also
[1:19:51] will keep thee from the hour temptation
[1:19:53] that's the that's the worldwide laying
[1:19:55] down with a mark of the beast which
[1:19:57] shall come upon all the world to try
[1:20:00] them that dwell upon the earth and I
[1:20:01] agree the coronaviruses it's having a
[1:20:03] worldwide impact right more so even than
[1:20:06] the swine flu because remember it's got
[1:20:07] to get to get progressively worse
[1:20:09] progressively harder all the time as the
[1:20:12] birth pains as we lead up to the rapture
[1:20:14] we've never seen it like this before
[1:20:16] it's it's something that's a little bit
[1:20:18] more than last time
[1:20:20] it'll keep going that way they'll try to
[1:20:22] take the rights right and then though
[1:20:25] though though we'll get to that a little
[1:20:27] bit but though though we're gonna try to
[1:20:29] unite the the economical move with
[1:20:32] politics but he said if you keep my word
[1:20:39] I'll keep you from the rapture I'm sorry
[1:20:41] I'll keep you from the laying down of
[1:20:43] the mark of the beast parmi he said I'm
[1:20:44] gonna take you in the rapture
[1:20:46] amen see God gives everyone space to
[1:20:50] repent that's in revelation 221 and I
[1:20:53] gave her space to repent of her
[1:20:55] fornication and she repented not Church
[1:20:58] God is giving us time and space to
[1:21:01] repent from it whatever we need to
[1:21:02] repent from because he's merciful he did
[1:21:05] this four thousand years ago with the
[1:21:07] amorite s' number they possessed Canaan
[1:21:10] in Abraham's lifetime but the Lord told
[1:21:13] Abraham we give them four hundred more
[1:21:15] years maybe four thirty four forty came
[1:21:18] from the exact number to repent but if
[1:21:20] they didn't their iniquity would be full
[1:21:22] and that was in Genesis 15:13 two twenty
[1:21:26] one and you know the story God knew they
[1:21:29] wouldn't so God brought out Moses exodus
[1:21:33] out of Egypt and then you know Moses
[1:21:35] magnified himself glorified himself so
[1:21:38] God anointed Joshua to take them into
[1:21:41] the land and try to drive out the
[1:21:43] Canaanites because the space to repent
[1:21:47] that God gave the hammerites it wasn't
[1:21:50] heated - it wasn't obeyed god help us to
[1:21:52] obey we have a chance to escape wrath we
[1:21:56] have a chance to repent and obey God may
[1:21:57] God help us may we make the decision in
[1:22:00] this space to repent and may we be right
[1:22:02] with God all the days of our life praise
[1:22:05] God today God's grace is extending even
[1:22:10] to Mystery Babylon and even the Roman
[1:22:12] Catholic Church and her daughter
[1:22:14] churches because that's what the church
[1:22:16] days Scripture was saying in Revelation
[1:22:17] 221 he's giving her and her daughters
[1:22:20] space to repent these last two thousand
[1:22:23] years he's saying come out of those
[1:22:26] churches that Harbor every unclean and
[1:22:29] hateful evil spirit the Bible calls it
[1:22:33] but there will come a day when their
[1:22:35] iniquities full just like the am rights
[1:22:37] were but for right now you know
[1:22:39] revelation 18 come out of her my people
[1:22:43] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:22:45] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:22:46] her sins have reached unto heaven and
[1:22:49] God hath remembered her iniquities
[1:22:53] see if you are Christ's bride even if
[1:22:56] you're foolish version you'll come out
[1:22:58] of those sin loving churches that don't
[1:23:01] believe the whole truth of God's Word
[1:23:02] and you'll try to get into Christ by the
[1:23:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're
[1:23:08] foolish version you'll at least live a
[1:23:09] virgin life free from idolatry
[1:23:12] there's brother Branham we can't worship
[1:23:14] brother Branham right we thank God for
[1:23:16] him we honor him look to his teaching
[1:23:18] point it bring it back to the word but
[1:23:20] we don't worship Him in idolatry because
[1:23:23] a virgin doesn't have intercourse in
[1:23:26] this case the virgin Christian doesn't
[1:23:29] have intercourse with idols so we see we
[1:23:32] have to be true to all of God's Word now
[1:23:38] I want to read a quote because that I
[1:23:39] was listening to this sermon over and
[1:23:42] over again it's called God's provided
[1:23:44] place to worship and I guess this is a
[1:23:47] quote just to encourage us here if you
[1:23:50] know the the sermon it's a beautiful
[1:23:52] sermon brother Branham is showing how in
[1:23:54] the Old Testament God had one place
[1:23:56] where he met a believer and that was
[1:23:57] under his name buh-bam said where is
[1:23:59] that place today he says this in
[1:24:02] paragraph 71 my friends I don't want to
[1:24:04] hurt feelings but I am responsible for a
[1:24:07] message and that message is notice he
[1:24:11] doesn't say every word on the tapes is
[1:24:12] the state the Lord
[1:24:13] that's not his message you didn't say
[1:24:16] everybody follow me and every word I say
[1:24:18] and come to my church no he's saying
[1:24:20] follow the word he said my message has
[1:24:23] come out of this mess and if I asked you
[1:24:26] to come out where am I going to take you
[1:24:28] but I'm saying his messages they come
[1:24:30] out of her my people he says where will
[1:24:32] I take you he said when I take you to
[1:24:34] the brand tabernacle now notice what a
[1:24:37] man is trying to point the people not to
[1:24:39] a building but to a spirit the Holy
[1:24:43] Spirit buh-bam said the bram tabernacle
[1:24:46] it's as much as fall as any of the rest
[1:24:49] of them so but I met brother hams trying
[1:24:50] to get the people to see it's not about
[1:24:52] a physical building it's about a
[1:24:54] spiritual interaction with Jesus Christ
[1:24:56] he said but there's only one place I can
[1:25:00] take you to where you're safe and
[1:25:02] protected from death and that's in Jesus
[1:25:05] Christ brother Ram says God's place
[1:25:07] worship hey man that's the place I'm
[1:25:09] introducing to you tonight where God put
[1:25:12] his name where he promised he would meet
[1:25:15] every person that come in there he would
[1:25:17] worship with him and feast with him
[1:25:19] that's in Christ not in no church no
[1:25:22] Tabernacle hey man we're thankful for
[1:25:24] our local churches but the man but it's
[1:25:26] not the physical building that were
[1:25:29] interested in it's the word that's being
[1:25:31] preached it's the Holy Spirit that's
[1:25:33] wooing the hearts trying to get people
[1:25:35] to believe to repent of their sins get
[1:25:37] baptized justified it's sanctified press
[1:25:41] out all their bad habits feast on the
[1:25:43] word get spiritual discernment feast on
[1:25:45] the deep meat of God's Word and then get
[1:25:47] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost amen
[1:25:50] that's what we're trying to get people
[1:25:52] to do to get to God's provide a place of
[1:25:54] worship the Holy Spirit praise God amen
[1:25:58] now in closing let me close with this
[1:26:01] you know I just want to I was talking
[1:26:04] with the brothers Simon and cam and I
[1:26:05] just want to kind of just review the
[1:26:08] order of things before the rapture so I
[1:26:12] got like seven steps here now there
[1:26:14] could be eight or more
[1:26:15] I just put seven on here now this is my
[1:26:17] own understanding the first thing that
[1:26:20] has to happen is more sorrows and
[1:26:22] earthquakes that's what Jesus said in
[1:26:24] Matthew 27 or 24 seven eight because
[1:26:27] that's what we're seeing right now so to
[1:26:29] me as I was talking this week with the
[1:26:31] brothers that just kind of clicked as
[1:26:32] like a revelation that's right we'll see
[1:26:35] more earthquakes and more pestilences
[1:26:37] and more sorrows now here's the sec the
[1:26:43] second thing I think we'll see along
[1:26:45] with all these is the driverless cars I
[1:26:48] know there's quotes brother Adam said it
[1:26:50] already happened but then there's other
[1:26:51] quotes where he said they don't even
[1:26:52] have the highways yet we're still
[1:26:54] waiting on the highways get the balance
[1:26:56] those out so I believe we're still
[1:26:59] waiting for the highways we're still
[1:27:00] waiting for the cars right I know
[1:27:03] they've tested millions of miles but
[1:27:04] they're not law they're not they're not
[1:27:06] in law and we don't have where's all the
[1:27:09] beautiful big highways what his truck
[1:27:10] talking about he's all about
[1:27:11] infrastructure right he was trying to
[1:27:13] get a two trillion dollar infrastructure
[1:27:16] bill passed as well to work on the roads
[1:27:19] that could be wrong on that but that's
[1:27:21] what it looks like it looks like we're
[1:27:22] have to see those driverless cars
[1:27:24] it's the advancements in science we
[1:27:26] talked about the third thing we'll see
[1:27:29] is the binding of the tares Jesus said
[1:27:32] buying the tares first in Matthew 13
[1:27:35] let me quote Daniel 12:4 was the
[1:27:38] increasing of knowledge at the end times
[1:27:40] that's the driverless cars advancement
[1:27:43] in science now the binding of Tears
[1:27:45] Matthew 13 30 is an intense unity in the
[1:27:51] ecumenical move the churches are going
[1:27:53] to all come together we don't see that
[1:27:55] right now right you don't see like
[1:27:56] people pressuring us to be united with
[1:27:59] the Catholics and United with the
[1:28:01] Mormons or something like that or
[1:28:02] seventh-day Adventists you don't see any
[1:28:04] political pressure doing that but there
[1:28:08] will come a unity of churches and the
[1:28:11] political leaders will unite with those
[1:28:13] churches to change the laws and brother
[1:28:16] Graham said and pick up your pen and
[1:28:17] write force the bride to stop preaching
[1:28:19] worst a lot of breech braids God so it
[1:28:23] doesn't seem like that's what's we don't
[1:28:26] seem like it's the intensity of the
[1:28:28] binding of the tares just yet but once
[1:28:30] that happens then Matthew I'm certain
[1:28:32] the revelation 13:16 brother Graham says
[1:28:35] starts coming down we start getting so
[1:28:37] close to the mark of the beast and it's
[1:28:39] during that time I believe the next
[1:28:41] thing happens the latter rain will fall
[1:28:43] this is during the squeeze time or this
[1:28:46] political pressure time and that's Joel
[1:28:49] 2 23 to 26 in revelation 3:10 we keep
[1:28:53] the word of his patience the latter rain
[1:28:55] will fall because as we get more and
[1:28:57] more political pressure will get more
[1:28:58] and more desperate for God hungry for
[1:28:59] God all the time more and more growing
[1:29:02] in grace and knowledge of God till it
[1:29:03] will cry out for rain he'll send us the
[1:29:05] rain and then I believe after that we'll
[1:29:08] see the ship the shout I'm sorry I'm
[1:29:10] sorry the voice we've already seen the
[1:29:11] shout the voice of the resurrection the
[1:29:14] same voice that resurrected Lazarus
[1:29:15] Jesus will resurrect the dead in Christ
[1:29:18] and I believe will see him just like
[1:29:19] Matthew 27 53 says Jesus first coming
[1:29:24] then we'll see the dead in Christ at
[1:29:26] Jesus the second coming and then the
[1:29:30] sixth thing will be we which are alive
[1:29:33] remain will be caught up bodies
[1:29:35] transformed death is swallowed up in
[1:29:37] life and will meet the Lord in the air
[1:29:39] and the seventh the last thing the hour
[1:29:42] temptation the mark of the beast will be
[1:29:44] laid down in order to create peace and
[1:29:46] safety Rome will make her 7-year
[1:29:49] covenant with Israel and then three and
[1:29:51] a half years in tribulation they'll
[1:29:53] break that covenant and this is when the
[1:29:58] USA vows to the woman I believe I
[1:30:00] believe that woman is most likely going
[1:30:02] to be Rome it could be a woman president
[1:30:03] or vice president but I believe it will
[1:30:05] be wrong that's when she'll bow and take
[1:30:07] her leadership all the American churches
[1:30:09] will take the leadership of the Roman
[1:30:10] Catholic Church
[1:30:11] all right Church let's stay on our feet
[1:30:14] here god bless you yeah let me come here
[1:30:23] let's sing that listen I want to be
[1:30:25] burning the midnight oil praise God whoa
[1:30:29] George oh we can feel the the pulsation
[1:30:31] of the holy spirit tonight we should
[1:30:34] already be so close to God nobody should
[1:30:36] have to freshen us scaring us into a
[1:30:41] closer walk with God if we're born again

[1:30:48] our hearts closer for communion
[1:30:49] fellowship what a consolation praise
[1:30:54] good the mystery of the rapture revealed
[1:30:58] to us think about that other billions
