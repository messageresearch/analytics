remembered again as far as the East is from the West you know you think about that one thing the devil he's an accuser and he's there accusing and he can accuse me of something from the past of the Lord [Music] and if they're under the blood and what the Lord says I don't know a thing you're talking about hey man hey man amen amen hit it's good to be here the sport and we got a little message this morning and I changed my message this morning I wasn't satisfied all night I was a little bit restless and we're going to give you a little unauthorized history lesson it's not authorized necessarily by sanction by Ohio or the United States because some of this history has been lost about your great nation about Israel and different things so you pray for me this morning that I can just put this together I preached this to a very there was only two people in this congregation and I sat in a and a couch and preached it and so on up but I wrote these notes down so Hurley I'm Mike after will read my own notes and I still do have trouble read my own notes cause my handwriting I'm like a doctor you can't understand that you can't yeah I mean you can't if you look at my notes you probably couldn't do a thing with them you couldn't but I know what they are so I can do it I believe so I still believe in handwriting handy writing out all my notes you know bring in my Bible I believe in the old black book the Bible goes I like I like a black you can have a white Bible that's all right like a black Bob because black shows Authority did you know even these gold edges on your Bible silver on this has come for the voice of God represents deity that's right you realize there's 66 books in the Bible and there's 66 chapters and Isaiah Isaiah's from the beginning and to the new earth God's Word is perfect God's Word was without air and you can believe that you can stand upon this Bible and I still like the author eyes king james version of the bible give you over here for lesson before you sit down did you know queen elizabeth couldn't have any children they called her the Virgin Queen she never had no children so when she died there was the successor was from Scotland in his name was James and with James became king he had a burden for a new Bible because he wasn't satisfied with the old translation in the first nine years it took nine years but he got I believe Holy Ghost filled men and that King James Bible was translated and it came to pass because Queen Elizabeth couldn't have no children hey man and had to choose a Scot to become King and that wonderful God has a plan the devil can't stop God's plan amen let us pray Heavenly Father as we stand together in this place that has been sanctified and set aside for the service of God we thank you for it we think for each one that is here and we commit our lives to you and we place our gift on the altar of God because you said if our heart condemn if it's not then we have confidence towards God my confidence this morning is toward my god in my Savior we're believing Lord you'll give me the right words to say words of eternal life and then we leave here we can say it was good to be in the house of God we commit this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen turn your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 62 we'll begin reading in verse 1 I think we'll run down about 5 verses and hit a couple verses towards the end of the chapter for times sake we'll give you the title of our message then in Isaiah chapter 62 for Zions sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof is a lamp that burn it in the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings I glory and thou shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hepzibah in thy land Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee in thy land shall be married for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over thee and then in verse 11 and 12 behold the Lord had proclaimed unto the end of the world say you to the daughter of Zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called salt out a city not forsaken you may be seated may God add his blessings to the reading of the words I want to title this message New Jerusalem which is above New Jerusalem which is above now before we go any further I mentioned this last night about Abraham had three sons because we want to place this in here because we want to see some things but probably God said in the seed is not air with the shuckin galatians force 27 it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that trail is not for the desert has many more children that which or a hug has a husband now we brethren as Isaac we are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted that was born after the spirit so even it is now never let what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman her son for the son is of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free of guess script now the Lord brother Benson Lord and his blessings to this world word he said this is because God is unusual and those that really serve Him from their heart serve him an unusual way we're different you know the Texas called the seat is not ever the shuk Paul here is speaking of the literal seed of Abraham two sons Paul gladly is bringing himself into position of the birth by the free woman amen now we know that Abram had two sons by two different women God gave him a promise by Sarah through Sarah rather that there would be a son born and through this son the world would be blessed all nations were blessed of the Sun and his commonly believed especially among the Jews that this was Isaac but it wasn't this promise of Abraham is Jesus and he is the royal seed of the promise of Abraham a man now his Abba my delight is in thee was another name for Jerusalem and hero that in right around the world war one Jerusalem was controlled by the Turks this Empire I don't know if you ever saw the series beyond all odds about Israel two movies and during this time the great Jenner was general Allenby but there was another group of the English army that had mark to a certain point and that army I don't remember the the Colonel's name or the captain's name but right before battle this captain had the Bible open by himself in his tent and he was reading the scripture first samuel chapter 14 he was reading were jonathan when you know saul he was lifted up in a battle against the Philistines and Jonathan read in this this captain read in the scripture where Jonathan found a passageway and he would go up this passageway one side was bows as one side was seen I bow says was a thorny place see not was a shining shining and I believed myself we won't go into the Johnson was kind of blinded for a series of time and he saw that and he went to his commanding officer see what I saw in the scripture and they went the same way you know Jonathan and his little armored bear he said there's armored bear you know yeah you know nothing was going right and solved in one of the fight and Saul didn't want him to eat and and he said some body's gonna do something he said we'll go up if those Philistines says come on up to us we know they were God's given to us but if they stay back we know but they went up and the Bible says Jonathan was crawling all fours when he got up there and he said that they said well why don't you come up to us and John's that said to his arm but God has given to us and you know what there was 20 men they killed 20 men him and his armor-bearer a half acre of land and the whole arm the Philistines went crazy it said the earth quaked because they was going crazy and they was discontinuing this elf and they want and did you know Jonathan later on it was commanded that Jonathan they should not eat but Johnson did hear the commandments of Saul and Jonathan said that he took his staff and reached up and got some honey and he took that honey and the Bible says my eyes has been enlightened what do you mean is I I believe he had been partially blinded and it did everything he did for God and won the battle and then God enlightened his eyes and he can see clearly what was not and that captain convinced his commanding officer they go up and that was the same I don't think they even realized it that was the same pathway and they defeated the Turks and that was the beginning of the end of the Turkish Empire and the beginning of the end of Israel becoming beginning of the beginning of Israel becoming a nation God didn't do anything by accident but we know that Israel Israel was always backsliding so the Prophet bring him back to the Prophet bring about always backsliding even him you can read in Matthew chapter 27 where when Jesus stood before Pilate and his wife came to Pilate said I've suffered so much in dreams don't do anything to this man Jesus and Pilate said I cannot find no fault in him but the elders the chief priests they convinced the people to free Barabbas and crucify Jesus and they said crucify heal and let his blood be upon us and by children our children that's why the Holocaust happened that's why Israel was scattered out to every nation has suffered under the Russian Empire suffered under this Empire and has suffered under that Empire now we know they're coming back they have came back Israel became a nation in 1948 you know the prophet of God said here's where became a nation in 1946 the same day he got his commission from the Ange of the Lord you know he said that he already said history since 1948 is that a contradiction you know what Perry Greene said that man carried the papers in his pocket for two years brother Branham was not wrong men may think he was wrong I don't understand everything the mess he says but I believe every word of it I wouldn't deny it for nothing I would be denying my heritage as if I denied one word way man see but been said it was the loving hand of God sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer but it still it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his children we thank you Lord now Beulah means a married land married man I'm going to Maryland now it means to rule over or to possess now Israel the most important thing to the Jews is land do ever think about it's the land they're not going to give up any land for a pea not right now they're not going to but we know that Rome is going to make a treaty with the Jews with those Wall Street Jews they got the gold and they want the paper they want the paper money of stocks and bonds they're going to make a treaty with the Jews they'll probably give up some land then but that land is the most important thing God told Abraham what this land was and it was the most important thing to a Jew was the land now to a Bible believing Christian Holy Ghost field it's not land I've got a house with some land but that will perish it's not land but it's spiritual land it's what I gain spiritually that's why God told Joshua where your footsteps step that means possess it everywhere he went that land was theirs you possessed they had to fight forth they possessed that land and I believe today we're not possessing land but worse possessing spiritual land whether it's your children whether it's your husband whether it's your wife where it is you are possessing what God has given you and I think we did we need to go to Satan and demand that God let our love was loosed a man okay now Paul said in second Korean swear I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to Christ a spouse means to join together betrothed a pure marriage see now we read our script that let me go back and catch this for his a young man marries a virgin so thy sons shall marry thee but here we're seeing the natural seed and the spiritual seed and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over thee he still loves Jerusalem he placed her over to the side he's not finished with her if we're gonna see him in he's not finished with her now did you know did you know the history of the United States and the Revolutionary War did you know your great nation seventeen seventy something during the war against England all was lost they were broke they didn't have a penny but God placed it in the heart of a Jew I got his name here his name was headed Solomon a Polish Jew the son of a rabbi he was first in England and that he come to the United States and they enlisted him and he had a burden he raised he was a Philadelphia banker Jews always knew how to make money okay Jacob how he got those spotted cattle you know and raised $400,000 you imagine what $400,000 was in the 1700s what he'd be worth today not only did that he raised for he did this and he did that and that man died a pauper he didn't want any he didn't want any percentage of any money that he claimed because I believe that he believed United States would be a haven for Jews till they could go back to the homeland that's the reason why there's still so many here and George Warson and I've got it home somewhere an article he proclaimed that all the children of Abraham was welcomed into United States and did you know George Washington would not bow at the sacrament or kneel oh they said well here Oh something's wrong with that guy he religious but he said one place when he knelt was a slave he said the ground is always level at the cross but he would not kneel at the sacrum I because he did not believe he would not belong to any church that was government established Church like the Church of England now we've got the Episcopal Church your hope there's nobody at no Episcopal is here because my daddy used to call him whisk up a whiskey pelean we'd pull up next to a car I hate out there's no Catholics here was but there was little statues on the dash and my dad we look over and said there's another spook chaser he established something in me he was planting seed by those little things he was planted seed however my dad was tall broad-shouldered I remember one time but I got me a car my first car was a 1954 Chevrolet to tote green it was a stick shift and and I finally decided that I'm gonna he said go ahead and take it I never drove a stick just take it on and I was just going wrong on that stick shift and I went down and turned the corner and all of a sudden this drunk came and barreling down the road and come so close to hitting me and he got out like he would go to beat me about just sixteen years old and I turned around and looked there was my daddy standing like this looking at that drunk and that drunk I'm getting out of here I got a heavenly father when I get in trouble he bigger than any devil there is he's bigger into the stream he's bigger than all and he's always comes to me whenever I need him Amen hallelujah Amen see thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the handle award in a royal diadem in the hand of God the Bible says he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and there's no unrighteousness in him the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is and she will never be left by him she will never leave his side she will share his throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and we are the crowning of his glory the gildo prophet of God one day we're gonna sing that he said that Baccalaureate song will all hail the power in Jesus name let angels prostrate fall bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all hey he's at the back Lloyd song we're gonna bring it and we're gonna crown him but he not only said that he gonna put a crown on our heads that's what he said you're gonna put a crown on us I ain't worthy of that crap but one thing nobody gonna be able to take that crown away from me and no devil gonna take that crown because it's eternal and it's given to me I'm wearing it as though I've already got it in my heart a man I'm sharing the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ now a mahan joint heirs with Jesus Christ in heavenly places that's my position and think about it that's peace that's your position but you know let the peace of God rule and reign in your heart you know let it rain it'll keep your heart and mine Christ cheats I'm established but sometimes the devil tries to take my peace and he doesn't where I'm in turmoil and I don't know what to do and that's when sometimes we need each other we can't fight the battle alone because if you take oh my come here both of you right here stand up here I like to demonstrate okay may take your hand all right this is much stronger now by myself he can he can he can probably get me but I got this threefold strength right here he ain't going to hell he's he's he kind of defenseless then a man their strength and numbers their strength and when the brighter Jesus Christ will come together the pillar of fire will appear again in the service hey man hey man glory hallelujah now the Lord said to aid them I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make her name gray and you shall be an a blessing and I will bless those who bless you Genesis chapter 12 I believe this you may disagree but I voted for Donald Trump I was raised my daddy was a Democrat to start with but many years ago he converted to be a Republican the only time he back slid was with Jimmy Carter you ever know Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter claimed to be a Southern Baptist and we found out he was a wine drinking Southern Baptists you know that and I remember at my house and my dad was complaining about Jimmy Carter and my mother said well you bloated for him he Baxley had been but I was raised to vote and I voted for Trump and I think I think God will bless him because he put the American Embassy back in Jerusalem other presidents had claimed to do it Reagan did Clinton did Kennedy did Nixon did all of them claim to do it but he is the only one that did and he's not a politician he's a businessman he he ain't a perfect man but I like one but once somebody said he's a perfect man for the job but he ain't a perfect man we know that you can tell by his mouth a man I father talk like that my mother would she did more than Wharf my mouth out with soap she'd have beat the devil out of me amen amen [Music] oh my if I could just tell my mother how much I love her my daddy how much I love her hey man now she was a nation 1948 oh I've got so many quotes I forgot to read them oh my now now listen Jerusalem is from above we're going to read the scripture which is the mother of us all did you know brother Brendan said God is your mother he's my father it's my mother ain't my brother and he's my sister he's everything to me that's all one wrong see see New Jerusalem you know they got Methodist headquarters Catholics and all this different places we have our headquarters it's not in Jeffersonville Indiana it's not in Arizona no it may be this big church but Jews rule in but the Bible says Jerusalem is from above which is the mother of us all a man now Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem he said this in 864 this is God created the earth in six days made the earth in six days or six thousand years they said be not ignorant we didn't descriptions one thousand years as one day Christ has gone in preparing a place that's been on construction for many many thousands of years preparing a place and if I go to prepare a place I will come again and receive you that wherever I am there you may be also notice the Redeemer and the redeemed your body was justified under Noah's baptism and your flesh when it dropped over there and the earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you live the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a dwelling place for Christ and his bride the New Jerusalem but first first John chapter five it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and there's three that bear witness on earth the spirit water blood and these three agree and what do they agree in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen if you're going to dwell in New Jerusalem which is above you've got to have the baptism below you've got to have the token what we talked about last night you know I forgot to put this in last night I can add this can I got plenty of time you know when I was growing up my mother away only had one driver in the home my mother didn't drive at that time she finally got a driver's license later I was a little boy and the bus would come by in front of the house and we'd have to kiss that bus and I don't think my mother used she yours token and that token was only good for the bus and when I was in New York a few years ago I preached in several churches in New York and we rode the subway and the sister took us and she bought some tick she went to a little places and bought tokens to get on that subway that's the only way we could get on it it was only good for the subway my mother token was only good for the bus the Holy Ghost is God and it's good for you eternal life and it's not good for the world it's not good for anything else it's God in you the hope of glory amen you must have a baptism of holy go if you're going to dwell in the New Jerusalem which is above a man a man now oh I now my land shall no more be called desolate the land is blooming years ago it was a bunch of deserts now if you go they've irrigated it they say that it's a beautiful place when it was just a bunch of desert it was dying but see it would no longer be desolate it did you know in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War when the Israel when the Arab nations come against Israel again and go to Myer was prime minister at the time all was lost and then it was lost Israel was going to fall and she carried a cyanide pill around with her if she would be taken by the enemy she would kill herself she would not be so she decided to call the white house and she got ahold of Henry Kissinger Secretary of State under Nixon which was a Hungarian Jew and Henry Kissinger said let the Jews burn a while so she waited awhile and she called again and she got a hold of President Richard Nixon this was at the time of Watergate when he was in trouble and you know brother management said I met the man he said he's a lovely vice president and he said I like the man Richard Nixon was in the meetings when the deep call it too deep in Washington DC Richard Nick brother branham said I set next to Richard Nixon dinner prayer breakfast and we talked she got a hold of because when Richard Nixon was a little boy his mother was a fundamental Quaker see there's two types of Quakers even today she was a fundamental Quaker and she told her son Richard she said Richard one of these days you're going to be in a position and the Jews will be in trouble and when they're in trouble you help them and when go to Meyer begin to speak to Richard Nixon he said it was like my mother talking to me and you know what he did he wrote her and he Richard Nixon was supposed to be an anti semantics that was the pub that was for public saying that he wrote her a blank check sent this and sent that and Israel was saved because of a prophecy of a mother to her son and that Watergate and you know Watergate was not the reason he left for that water the reason he left because he knew when he did that everybody was against Israel at that time and he would be gone and that's the reason he had to leave the office truth is not always true that you hear in the news media most the time is a bunch of lies and I believe there's a place for Richard Nixon he saved the nation of Israel and I hear people would mock him and talk about Messi's people I don't do in front of me I know what the problem God said about he said the lovely vice president he knew something don't you think sitting there steaming up or breakfast communicating with president Nick don't you think he knew something that's history I'm gonna give you another history lesson how many has ever read the fifty years in the Church of Rome by Charles technically you read it you know why Abraham Lincoln was killed it was the Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic Church guilty why because he had a revelation of Jesus Christ and a revelation of that great cloud hanging over the United States was Rome he was warned by mr. Morse the Morse code and Charles technically that they were going to kill him but he said I know God has for God has spared my life many times but he won't always he said I had a dream and in that dream I guess he was in a casket and he was not allowed to go after the Civil War he was not allowed to go into the Promised Land when Nate United States would prosper he knew his life was going to be taken that's the history that's the history that's the history and did you know in Baltimore Maryland but they were already celebrating his death before he was even killed everyone that was everyone that was in a line of that that killed him Mary Stuart nan were Roman Catholic Jim Stewart of the Civil War was Roman Catholic did you know that the Roman Catholic Church supported the South in the Civil War read it all in the 50 years in the Church of Rome I say this other than the message the Bible and the message of the hour the greatest book I've ever read was fifty years in the Church of Rome while Charles generally that's history I'd like to tell history unauthorized this where you won't read in the history did you know George you won't read this I got the books did you all read that George Washington had visions but it was used to be it used to be in the public school system years ago that George Washington had visions and it was taken out spiritual man that's why brother BAM said I'm gonna have another Abraham Lincoln or George Washington hey man a man John Adams John Quincy Adams a man but it's beautiful and mother Bram said in Satan's Eden what was the first heaven it was the Millennium what was the first earth it will be renovated just like baptized by knowing the days of his preaching sanctified by Christ sprinkled his blood upon it and be removed renovated take all the germs and everything off of it and in the red of his renovation at the end was a fire baptism that will kill every germ every sickness every disease every feel that was here on there she will burst for it and come forth you know at the Mount of Olives and it's going to cleave to the left and cleave to the right and there's going to be a mountain come up a pyramid mountain and Jerusalem will descend from above he's got our homes finished he ain't finished mine yet he knows what I like a man he knows what you like a man and he's doing it right now I mean he's the great architecture he's the great builder they nobody can build like my Lord Jesus Christ can't see and I saw a new heaven first heaven and the first earth was passed away and there was no more seat ja I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem sending from God out of heaven in the heavens of the earth is husband and wife so is Christ in the church they all meet in one big glorious plan of redemption in his brought right into the bosom of God again I like that hey man and a new earth there is a new city we're not talking about the Millenium now we're talking about the newer that's when any in the Millenium there is time a thousand years but in the new earth there is no more time it's eternity amen see in my father's house as many mansions in my father's Kingdom as many palaces Christ is there under construction of the New Jerusalem now now listen don't move don't miss this Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem just as God created the earth in six days may the earth in six days of 6,000 years be not ignorant we read in the scripture one thousand years is one good and Christ is going and preparing that place and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you I finished it I feel like I'm in the Philippines right now okay amen when I'm in the Philippines I see brothers bro over there they got ties on and long-sleeve shirts I'd die with the tie on in the film in a long-sleeve shirt I wear a short sleeve shirt and it hangs out I found out the brothers told me it's cooler that way because I can't stand the heat but when I go up God's called me to the mountains let me tell you a little storm will flow that in there I ain't finished yet I'm gonna I'm gonna complete this did you know water freezes in tropical areas because there's a place called Nunn gawah way up in the mountains I've been there many times the pastor used to beat brother Gabriel he stepped down and brother Moses took over I mean what can you beat that a man and it was handed down from generation to generation just like Israel it was handed down from generation to generation what tribe they were from nobody knew because when Titus rim sacked and destroyed the city all the records was lost they don't know who they are but they go to that Wailing Wall and they cried crying cry looking for the Messiah that was the message that's going to preach this morning we won't better not get off on that but there was tradition that handed down now this brother is only about 38 that the water had froze in nan Gowen now I know this I preached outside in a crusade I had to have him a colon and I wear a jacket up there and it was tradition handed down well brother Moses said last winter around January there was water sitting out on the porch and he went out and the water was froze so that was just not hearsay it was something that come to pass and that's the reason I like the mountains but when I go down to the lowland and when I preach looks like I took a bath with my clothes and it ain't no fun either reckon you get finished when you sit down in you're dying it's the one of the worst feelings in the whole wide world a man now but those Jews under the fifth seal yes are there now crying how long Lord how long will you be avenge us he took this rested a little while and still you've got some more brethren that's going to have to give they're like 144,000 yes that's the natural seed that's not the bride he put it here weighs this was they were married to the land but were married to Jesus Christ so Beulah land is married land to us to Israel it was the land Beulah land it's what is ours nobody gonna take it away that's the way we need to do with our experience with God nobody gonna take my witness away I know men that's lost their witness I know preachers I'm just going to tell you I had a brother that I hadn't seen for a long time on Facebook so I come I send him a B and so on so place I used to travel with him I traveled with him one time to a military camp where the children were all diseased and dying and God stayed stop that brother Danner told me he believed that the Roman Catholic Church had poisoned the waters but he said well I'll be I'll come you never showed up never showed up I found out you know what happened he fell from grace by a woman it happens happens all the time I know places I've gone you will not believe that's the reason why I ain't never gonna be alone because some woman could say something about me then I was nearly innocent I am never alone I'm never alone my testimony his work is like gold to me its deity it's good in me it's Christ they're there waiting how long Lord how long a Bible says in Galatians 4:4 this is a gar and Mount Sinai in Arabia pertained it to Jerusalem which now is is an in bondage with her children but droolin which is above is free which is the mother of us all for as a young man Mary the Virgin show thy sons marry the land II we won't go into what Romans chapter 11 talks about that ollie branch the olive tree or Israel was taken out and we were grafted in we were grafted in because of grace because it was the mercy of God when they went when they said let his blood be upon us if they had and I have said that the gospel would not have came to us here was really the grace of God but the Bible says don't get puffed up don't think you're somebody because the same God that took her out can put her back in and take you out and that's going to happen it's going to happen there's going to be a foolish virgin go through the tribulation because she would not accept the full word of God because she would not believe God's Word and she'll have to go through the tribulation amen the Bible says in revelation 19:7 let us rejoice and be glad glad and rejoice and give honour to the king for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife I made herself ready I kind of long but I've got to read this excuse me I'm not been preaching even an hour yes it's a Philadelphian Church age he that hath the key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus likened the Moses was the prophet of God David a man after God's own heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater king king of kings and Lord of lords God very God now David was born of the tribe of Judah and out of the priests he was a great warrior coming overcoming the in him established and the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful top of Christ but now in Isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of David will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry and it's Church what the key of David signifies at the time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled and Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our Lord after after the resurrection not his earthly pilgrimage but what he does this key signify their answer lies and the position of the key I love this it is not his in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is placed in the hands of the key for a loan he opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it read Isaiah 9:6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder what does this mean the answer is this the phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the pride the bride is committed to the groom and takes off her veil and grooms shoulders signifies that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head and also that he bears a responsibility in the care that he alone and no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of David God being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him unto Him alone she is wholly committed to him and accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is a head of the church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that it he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight what does that hesitant means my delight is in her I want you to know the day that Jesus delight is in the bride of Jesus Christ it's not a denominational system it's not in the worldly system it's not in a Roman Church a Catholic Church or Lutheran Church or Pentecostal Church a Baptist Church pilgrim holier so whatever is delight it's not in four walls his delight is not in Creed's but it's as light isn't a personal relationship with you in man that is his delight that is what He desires if he's longing for anything he's longing to come to you he is longing to fellowship with you and fellowship with me as he came down in the cool of the day in the garden of he many times he would come but one time he came and they were here poor Sal Adam he came at Church time evening time and where they were here why they had sin but God in His mercy God is some bloody skins they had to leave the garden but they had those bloody skins and I like it Buller Brennan give the illustration it's Adam and Eve as walking out the garden and that blood is flapping on him and he turns around to Adam and says I'm sorry it's all my fault it's a quote I'm sorry it's all my fault I think that's what we need to do once in a while and say Lord I'm sorry it's all my fault it's all my fault I think we need I need I think we ever once why we need a a repentance and an altar to get rid of our own ideas in our own Creed's because we get so magnified with them that we think we know more than God sometimes God takes me through a valley I don't want to go that Valley I'll go this way you go that way you're in the permissive will of God and you are in big trouble like Balaam was amen amen I'm not ready to close amen another ha I'm gonna repeat it again in future honk why is God so thought and cared so much for that little place in Palestine but it's just a little spot but right in there is where the temple is set there's four New Jerusalem will break right there Mount of Ali's clean to the right and to the left and push up from beneath a nigel solid lards Jerusalem descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband amen are we adorned for our husband the righteous system not mine eyes like filthy rag adorned in his what what brother man God God has allowed me to clothe that ride in the clothes of his work man if he said that I'm gonna believe it a man I believe it I fought against it for 12 years 12 long years you ain't never been on the backside of the desert like I have i've been whipped i've been whipped and I've been triple whipped I've been quadruple whipped but he did all that to get me to a place I would surrender to him and you know what I didn't come a minute too late I came just on time we're we're convinced that a baby comes too early or comes too late I'm not sure sure that I believe it comes just on time even though it's premature it comes just on time hey man we got a lot of babies that's been born premature in the message that's right and they need to grow but I'm glad you got a pastor here but I'll help you grow I've been to some places where they can't get no growth and I leave though just satisfying so trouble when I get in my car
