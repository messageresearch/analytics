========================================

and worshiping the Lord God knows I need that help uh I I'm just going to be honest here a little bit here which I mean uh being I say gu transparent uh I've been singing the Praises of the Lord since uh literally became a Christian in 20 the spring of 2000 and I still cannot remember a lot of these songs I literally need I need a book or I need these uh the words putting up there I don't know why uh for those of you who know my mother and how my wife uh uh got to see some things last night we took my mom out to e for the New Year's there to and she just forgets this forgets that I'm like man Lord I know where it comes from I just we're just believing that maybe God will uh deliver me there with my dad's memory my dad has a really good memory uh brother Jesse's got a phenomenal memory brother Cam's got a memory uh I think all my brothers and sisters got memories but uh I'm I'm asking the Lord to bring maybe 2025 will the year of the memory for me amen I'd like to write that on my uh testimony list here so uh let's read a scripture here and then we will uh be seated in Matthew uh 26 let me get there myself by God's grace I don't have a lot tonight but we'll see how the Lord uses it thanks God every every time I get behind a Pulpit I say Lord God I want to yield more I want to let you speak and I want the things that you want me to say to come to my heart and then I can Usher them out and Lord God the things you don't want me to say Lord God give me that little check uh you know when uh brother B was preaching that seventh seal he got to a certain point it was in paragraph 261 he says go no further stop here and what he do he continued on he felt a check right there he says look I've got it written down he's a go no he stop right here but he continued on and the Holy Ghost made him record that very ending part of that so uh I want the Lord to stop me when I'm supposed to not say things and and of course may he utter things out when he needs to do them so in Matthew 26 verse uh let's jump to verse 26 Matthew 26 verse 26 thank you for standing he says and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is the blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom let's say a word of prayer let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord we thank you for tonight God lord and Lord Jesus Lord it uh it seemed fit Lord it seemed of your uh plan of uh predestination God lord lord that uh we would be here Lord

and Lord Jesus Lord knowing we must go on another year uh Lord I know as Paul St Paul said he said I would love to be in the this paraphrasing but Lord God we we know he said I'd like to be with you we want to be with you Lord Jesus Lord but Lord for our brothers and sisters sakes Lord God we must remain Lord another little bit here Lord Lord and Lord Jesus Lord give us strength Lord tonight Lord

asked to send his greetings to you here uh we're a little little small group as well just pushing on striving on uh trying to there's one thing we want to do we want to please the Lord Jesus Christ SS of God though uh we get hungry every day multiple times a day and when we eat those we eat that food it pleases us but SS of God we want to please the Lord Jesus Christ that is our great thing as Lord uh uh God knows our hearts we want to please him more than anything in the entire world we want to as a I like this as a husband I can I know that when my wife does certain things uh uh that I maybe I not even ask her to do or however but it really some things uh especially really really please me I'll say like this tonight my wife drove me all the way from home to here while I was studying we had a read a long I've been having a long three weeks of uh uh ministering teaching and preaching and uh then we do obviously working through the day physical labor and then we do little side jobs helped a brother this morning with his sub pump his sub pump went out his basement was full eight inches of water to the rescue right that's what plumbers do we're always on call so uh we're tired and I tried to get back to study in time and I really didn't get a thought and then about 5:07 I told my wife I I finally got a thought and then here we are she Faithfully drove God bless you my love I thank the Lord for her uh she's been faithful and uh you know sometimes um you're amazed that the Lord has someone that can actually handle you he anoints uh someone that can actually handle I mean man pray for my wife that God would continue to give her strength uh to be around me and to uh put up with my weakness is my faults and failures so amen uh to tonight by God's grace uh it's about 712 here we'll try to not keep you too long but I want to give you the very thought the lord gave me saints of God it's the new year it's it's this time where we start we reflect what does this what what does this time usually do to us it gives us a time to reflect back in what God has done in our lives where we've been before where we want to go you know they say um businessmen and people who want to accomplish great things they always said he said you've got to have a plan you've got to have a fiveyear you got to have where they always ask they ask someone new where do you want to be a year from now where do you want to be five years from now where do you want to be 10 years from now you got to have a plan you got to have a have goals you got to have an Outlook you got to have something you want to strive to do some kind of accomplishment you want to uh H move into something you want to say I I've worked and and and in those goals you set for the years and months and weeks you want to have something something an accomplishment something a reward something you can say look I started this thing right here and now look where I'm at right here and I've done exactly what I set out to do amen so the saints of God that's where we are uh uh and it doesn't necessarily be on uh on a new year but every day SS of God I'll say like this every day is a battle a battle that is uh as just Waring and raging in our minds and hearts and souls and our flesh obvious this thing has once nothing to do with God's will this body this flesh gets tired SS of God I wish uh I work with a gentleman uh his body wakes up at 3: a 3:30 or 3:00 a.m. every morning and I'm like and and then he goes to work at 7 and I'm like I'm just in awe I was like I wish I had that kind of free time where your my body doesn't shut down you know or he just wakes up and then you in that kind of a lifestyle you could get up and pray and study for hours before work would even start would that be awesome of course he goes to bed at 9 9:30 I have trouble I'm usually getting home about 10 10:30 whatever I'm doing right so uh I got a schedule things I I learned how to do these things here by God's grace and uh maybe a little bit of slow learner but uh uh tonight Saints I'd like to speak on a sign overlooked and with a subtopic of let's say a busy wife a sign overlooked with a sub topic uh or subtitle of a busy wife a sign overlooked now uh there's there's two really I'll say like this in your life or in lives as the young ones here would be growing up uh and I'll say for the young ones uh there are things you're looking forward to there there's going to be two major things that take place in your life um and one of them is number one usually is uh and should be of course is getting married that is one of the biggest days in your life that's the one of the most life-changing events you will have is number one getting married number two then after that for not necessarily even well even for the husband but mostly for a woman it would be having a child those two spots in life I think are the most life altering things that uh and greatest decision you could make for the outcome on the remainder of your life all right so when you get married young sisters young Brothers there uh depending on who you marry will determine the rest of your life okay and SS of God and then of course once you get married then of course uh Lord willing uh the children will start to come and this and that and however and you want those children to can of course and once those children start arriving your life takes a drastic turn a drastic change takes place and in fact some of the uh young men I'm working with they they're getting married they've had children and now they're like man brother Sai uh time uh I don't have time for myself I don't have time for my wife guess what I'm doing I'm watching over my children so their whole goal is literally uh their whole goal is uh going home and spending time with their children giving their wife a break and then spending time with the children Daddy's playing with the young boy Daddy's playing with the young girl and those sort of things and SS of God uh uh here we are at this this time Saints uh but now think about now that's the the natural what about the spiritual what about the spiritual things that God is that we're looking forward to do or to be with with Christ right we're looking forward to this Rapture we're looking forward to what the moving of God we're looking we're waiting for uh uh the coming of the Lord to to and the Bible says that he will come and descend with a shout voice and Trump SS of God that's how he's going to usher in this Rapture that's how he's going going to make move in our lives in such a way uh and those sort of things but uh you I I I'd like to read this scripture here in Matthew 25: 1-12 and saints of God just think on these things you've heard it a thousand times but remember what was today one day one day closer to the Rapture when I first heard this message at the end of 2001 I thought wow George Bush is present uh he's got big ears this could be this could be the guy and then 2005 2004 rolls around uh okay uh then then the next big one is 2012 and oh man everybody saying 2012 is it that's it it's over after that the the the Mayan calendars are pointing to this dat and sure enough 2012 Here Comes 2013 like wow Lord when is you when are you coming Lord God the prophet of God went off the scene in 65 here we are in 2025 60 years later right amazing I thought I thought Lea was supposed to be a short age quick Short age a quick short work the prophet himself could see passed 1977 1977 comes around all the message people quitting their jobs and this and that building all their money together and they're just like we're waiting on this place waiting for the Rapture 2 1977 goes on and they're like wow and what people started falling away but SS of God at this time this in fact in this age this is Le oia it's a time of Darkness but the Bible said in the evening time there would be light but SS of God in that time of Darkness we've got to have confidence that God has given us light I say like this this Bible if you have a question let's ask the author sometime well maybe brethen so and so or sister so so would Happ but SS of God if we get down on our knees and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal where we even are he can reveal right now where we are in this Bible and what he and and God what did he do God sent a prophet and then he said and he gave us these Clues he says watch Israel watch Israel and see exactly that's God's time piece right we see the battle raging over a year now with what Israel Israel is fighting her enemies has the devil increased in your life like it has in their life SS of God absolutely I've been to some Churches there and they and they come up to after service they said brother Simon I feel like I yesterday I felt like I was going to quit take my wife and just head out and go brother Sai I thought I was I I I I I thought I I I I'm having so many mind battles I don't even want to get up and work and go to work I don't want to do this I don't want to do that I'm just I'm just so tired and I and and the whole thing say to God this is where we've got now we've got to find the balance in life we we've got to prepare ourselves for the Rapture right we've got to prepare ourselves for these sort of things but we've also have to balance this life that God gave us amen we still have to plant our potatoes we still got to what do the things we need to do this sister right here sister Kaa she's got to prepare for what's coming in the next years if God sister uh Lydia's already taking college courses writing for my my my mother was writing telling me phenomenal things about your writings she's like Simon she said Simon you got to read some idious things they're amazing I can't even fathom how she gets these thoughts out of her mind and I'm like okay okay awesome sweet praise the Lord what she's preparing for her future she's what getting things ready depending on when God would anoint a man to come here sweep her off her feet which we're trusting is the Lord Jesus Christ but come may come sweeping off her feet what and take her and then uh change her have a name change right uh but God knows all these things than to God that's the part of the battle right this is this these are the things the the daily things the daily Necessities that we need right those things that we're trying to strive and trying to uh plan for this and plan for that why because uh uh God even though God is our provider he was he part of the curse that came in Genesis 3 was what Adam he says Adam you're going to have to work by the sweat of your BR brow right and of course with the E with with Eve you're you're going to have in childbearing you're going to have a sorrow and all those sort of things but SS of God we still have to battle we have to deal with what the effects of that first sin the original sin my goodness absolutely now sure we all have plans and have dreams oh if we could just do this and that and maybe God would you know but uh give us this and give us that but sints of God we've got to just continue on and give give God his space what is our plan for tonight when you go home say Lord what is your plan for my life Lord God make it plain because remember we don't know what's coming ahead we don't know we just hit 2000 we don't know what's coming tomorrow maybe God wants to turn a corner in your life maybe God wants to do something what well this is how it's always been we just do this we do this we do this every day it's the same thing every day but maybe in that that cycle that you're in there's danger up ahead and God says you know what today hey I want you to do this instead break that cycle to get you out of Harm's Way amen than God we're talking about serious things remember that was the point of the having all nine spiritual gifts in the church if we could get someone what someone so in the spirit of God to where what they would speak in tongues and then the interpretation come out and it be a mature gift and then what also something specific come out and say uh uh sister Toba uh tomorrow when when you're out chasing the chickens and you're all collecting eggs there's going to be a coyote coming and next time when you go out I want you to bring your big sisters with you instead of you because they would get eaten by that coyote right so so we want I'm justay I'm just making a story here so so what we need the leadership of the Holy Ghost we want God to lead and guide us what in our lives also not only in the spirit and truth but we want we want also in our lives protection what we want to hedge us about us to what the devil remember the devil knows us better than we the devil has been studying Humanity for 6,000 years one by one look in the Old Testament every major prophet in fact any Prophet Satan has got them to fall think about that remember that that the Bible doesn't give the name of the Prophet The Prophet said uh God told the prophet says go speak to the king he says don't say anything to anyone on the way there he says and any on your way back don't say nothing just head right back the exact same way you came and the prophet did that he said he's on his way someone said hey God he said no I got I got I got something to do he goes to the prophet or go go goes to the king says thus thus thus thus sayith the Lord blah blah blah and he's done says he does exactly that turns around starts heading out and then here comes a false lying Prophet what and brought a different word said oh the Lord spoke to me as well so you're supposed to come to my house right now notice one of the things see all these things in the Old Testament for what learning if God shows you something and someone around comes around says you something different then you better stick with the original Revelation but remember that Revelation has come to come to this now notice that that first prophet he had thus sayith the Lord that old lying Prophet did not have thus a lord say the Lord he was a liar and what it caused the young prophet's death because he listened to someone else amen just like Moses what the Moses uh the people worked him up for 40 years imagine complaining people for 40 years people thirsty people hungry more maybe your mother would know a little bit about that people hungry people thirsty maybe Big Sisters would know something about that maybe wives would know something about that I'm hungry I'm thirsty I'm cold I'm tired this and this and after 40 years Moses is just like he says Lord now finally at 4 years they said there're we're still thirsty Moses we're still thirsty give us something to drink Moses just grabs the staff and just [Music] like he goes and speaks to the Lord said Lord what would I do with this rebellious people the Lord said go speak to the Rock Moses is like alls I heard was Smite he grabs his he grabs his much like Babe Ruth grabs his Lumber there and just smites the Rock and by that Temptation who allow who made him do that the devil anointing the people to drive them completely insane who who who made them people like that shouldn't those people be so Glory so thankful to God to bring him out of Egypt shouldn't those people so be so thankful what that the Holy Ghost they left Egypt and they're just at the time here when now they were going northward they're ready to take the promised land but right before the promised land they got thirsty it was a dry time oh my aren't we here today s God aren't we at a dry time tonight oh my when's the last time the Holy Ghost came down in our lives in the prayer Closet in in the on the way to work or on the driving in the car when is the Holy Ghost come down it's a dry time Saints but don't get angry at anyone don't get angry at yourself don't get angry at anything but just ask the Lord Lord God send that rain send that fresh water to us amen and don't you don't have to Smite The Rock things of God you just got to speak to him God will get God will give you the very desires of your heart if you place him first that's a promise amen now let's continue here Matthew 251 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be liken of 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom man it's a little hot in here he says five of them were wise and five were foolish he says they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh but go ye out to meet him then all the virgins arose and trim their lamps saints of God that's going to happen even though that's a parable that's a real life event that is going to take place there's coming a Time Saints where we're going to hear a voice we're going to hear something supernaturally there's coming a time where we literally we're going to say we're going to hear go out to meet him Jesus is at that point ready to go what is what is this Parable what is Matthew 25 it is what the husband coming for the bride it is literally a marriage ceremony it's it's literally what it is he's coming to rescue his wife because what death lies ahead destruction lies ahead sure now in the W in the foolish son to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out amen now we all know the we all know that we've been through that ride what was the oil represent the oil represents the Holy Spirit what does the lamp represents according to what I'm seeing in the scripture uh is literally is the word of God but remember this is at dark time time they had the lamps they all had the lamps and what was that lamp that lamp was to light the path to direct so you could see where you're going saints of God but remember it's just not any lamp it can't be a denominational lamp you go you I like this uh if you if we could uh like I maybe I said this before however I've said this somewhere else but if we could take a little field trip right now if we get say hey let's let's go jump in the old landship right back out here right all of us just packing there me and brother sitting close and I could sit on his lap or however you we get all real tight we go in there and hey let's go to another church and we go to another church maybe a Catholic or Lutheran or Presbyterian or how whatever church is you're going to hear we go in there and listen we're going to hear they don't know exactly where what time it is right now they're bringing false ideas they're bringing false thoughts they still believe in this and believe in that and however there some uh uh you know uh think the bride goes through the tribulation something they they take the Rapture after the tribulation s of God they have no idea what's going on but that's why God has sent us a word that's God has sent us a revelation of Where We Are Tonight SS of God that Jesus said when you see that fig tree blooming he says he says the generation that see that shall not pass away till all these things be fulfilled we are in that time Israel I like this my pastor been hope back home been preaching on uh a little bit a couple weeks ago on the rebuilding of the temple you know who's supposed to be here Cyrus there's supposed to be a Cyrus a man anointed to help what rebuild the Third Temple now in f in Donald Trump's first four years Israel declared him as Osiris in fact I was in Thailand I was teaching that I was teaching there he is there's Cyrus there's he's going to rebuild the Third Temple and then boom he did not do it and then he get got shifted over we lost four years and then now come around here he is again and I wonder if he will rebuild this Temple let me just show you something here I me and my wife about three weeks ago we had read the book of Ezra and uh we were reading it and man there was some things that really was interesting Saints in Ezra 1 you know to in Ezra 1 King Cyrus says he says that God spoke to King Cyrus says go tell them Jews allow them Jews give them all the resources help them rebuild the Third Temple or a temple rebuild the Temple and the Jews with joy they went out and started Gathering material they asked for this this and they started building and then another group we see in chapter three or four another group rose up and said hey we don't want you to rebuild this thing and they sent a letter to the new king another king that had risen up at that time or another king and the King they said he say he says go back and look at Israel's history has Israel ever paid homage have they ever paid taxes or retributions to the kingdoms been over them and search it out in history so the king he went up he read he says no they've never done that and he said shut it down so notice we see the anointing of the Holy Ghost move towards what the rebuilding of the temple and then the devil what shuts it down but then another king Rises up and says uh uh in fact brother cam brought this out beautifully how God had to anoint two prophets to come two prophets to come and help them and force them to start rebuilding and then as they rebuilding another group said hey you're not supposed to be rebuilding and they said he said go search the history go search history and see if King Cyrus did not tell us to do this so notice and then they of course they went back in history and found out yes King Cyrus did tell us to go and rebuild these things amen so come back around to King Cyrus's word again what to rebuild that Temple amen now here's something I seen But as as and then they started rebuilding they rebuild it and at the time of the rebuilding uh at the time of the rebuilding they had to go back to the word of God that because remember they had rebuilt the entire Tabernacle or the the temple or however you want to say the Tabernacle the temple they had rebuilt it and now they wanted to go into worship but in order to be accepted by the Holy Ghost in order to be accepted by Jehovah or God they had to what they had to what get themselves clean they had to go back and receive the word now look what took place here and I want you to think spiritually in Ezra 91 after building this what Ezra said hey he was a teacher of the Old Testament he was a teacher of the word now notice in Ezra 9:1 now I use these scriptures in the original sin study but think spiritually about what needs to take place to be accepted he says now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of Israel notice the people of Israel and the priests and the levit notice they're all guilty what are they guilty of have not separated themselves from the L people of the lands doing according to their Abominations even of the Canaanites the Hittites the perizzites the je jebusites the ammonites the moabites the Egyptians and the amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of the lands yay the hand of the chief the hand of the princes and the rulers have been Chief in the trespasses so what they have to do what notice Hees say they have taken for themselves wise or women what and then married into them what was what was Revelation 17 what was the mystery of the great that she had daughters she had harlots so notice these people have what in in spiritual sense they've went to the false churches and in doing that and going to false churches notice this and so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands if you go back to Matthew 13 remember the parable the sewer he was sowing seed he was sewing what the word word of God but if you go to a wrong Church a false Church whatever it be because remember Jesus said I'll bind the tears first and then I'll take the weed up into the Garner he say into the barn air he says what notice what takes place after they join themselves in false church is what the holy seed or the word will be mingled saints of God the whole key of everything what was the what was what started the very Act of the original sin was what the serpent mingling the word with a woman with a church a false preacher comeing and mingle the word with the true church which is Eve right saints of God it's just like uh it's just like the New Testament Ephesian age amen sure now that's that that right there so that the holy seed have mingled themselves that's that's the part that we we've got to make sure that we're doing everything correctly amen now in this sort of thing now I'm G to move on here by God's grace I wanted to share that with you now in you know like this a sign overlooked a ready wife or sorry a busy wife right look at John 14 John 14:1 he says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God he says believe also in me he says for in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself and where I am there ye may also be uh may be also and whether I I go you know in the way you know so notice if we're a wife of Christ Christ said 2,000 years ago he's going to a place to prepare us something he's going over there to prepare us a house a mansion right we have a faithful husband trust me he's not just laying around there he's what interceding for our sins he's applying the blood and the mercy see what we are completely spotless according to what the Revelation brought to us in this day the the what he said the bride was deceived she was tricked into this thing there's no you're not guilty of anything now but here's our husband he's ready he's going to be ready when he comes that place is done when he comes well all things are ready now he says go what get people ready for the feast sure now now the beautiful thing about that is that we see now notice he's got a place prepared and in John 14:24 look at his prayer he says he says uh he says uh John 14:24 he says father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am see his one desire his one request to the father was what that he wanted to be with us he wanted us to be with him amen he wants his wife to be attached and join to the husband he wants us to be attached to what the Holy Ghost amen sure the saints of God so notice that's where we want to be we want to be where is the bride is going to be the bride is going to be in the perfect will of God and in what the anointing are under the anointing of the Holy Ghost we might not feel it all the time we might not think we're God's always with us but s of God he is always with us he's always near when we go off here we say something we shouldn't what brother said he said that little bird that little Dove flies does not the presence of the Holy Ghost does not leave us in our souls but the Holy Spirit then will lift off and go sit on a little branch we're waiting for us to repent so what he can come right on back with us amen absolutely and that's the promise we have tonight Saints is that what all we have to do is live right speak right talk right do the right things and what the Holy Ghost presence will be among us about three weeks ago I was at a service and I didn't I didn't know which way to go I was like Lord do you want me here you want me here so on the way there I was praying I said Lord God I want to know you I just had this weird prayer I said Lord I want to know that you're with me and then when I got to the service my wife had sit down I started praying on on the the Pew like this or the chair I said God God I said God I want to know if you're with me and then as before service a brother went up there he started speaking and he used the exact same scriptures I was going to use and I got up there I said saints of God this service is for you the word the sermon I have this this this this thought here from God is for you because I asked the Lord thus I said Lord God are you with me and there he brings it right out of the brother right before service and I continued on Amen yes I I think that's glorious I think that's marvelous amen sure now a busy wife in Luke 15:8 Luke 15:8 either what woman having 10 pieces of silver remember that silver represents R Redemption we're dealing with the wife now the husband's making everything ready we don't have to worry about Jesus Christ he's going to he if he said it he's gonna do it right he's never failed us one time he says but now we have to worry about ourselves the Bible says what the bride maketh herself ready either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle so notice it's at the dark time she had to light a candle to see why because somewhere and it must have been night time it must have been when she closed the door brought down the shades or whatever whatever she was doing it was dark and she had to light a candle again amen she had lost in the darkness about her ways whatever she was doing whatever she was doing in the dark she was doing this cleaning this getting this ready however whatever she was doing she checked and she found that one of her silver coins was missing and she had to light a candle she needed a little light to see what she was missing doth not he do not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it SS of God if there's something missing in your life you should notice she was able to detect that something was wrong she something in her mind said I better check this and she goes remember them tabs what were on her head they she wore those things as a sign that she was faithful to her husband and she just went like this she checked her headship again oh my goodness I'm missing one of my coins where's it at she had the light of the candle and there she was but notice something in her said something is wrong SS of God brother said when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said there's a little buzzer that goes off there's that little something inside you that says man there's something wrong remember time and time again the prophet be preaching and he'd be preaching he said and he went off and he said man there's something wrong what did I say something wrong and what the Holy Ghost will bring back to him says oh forgive me let me reread that scripture ah there it is that's it and he went taught it right amen sure he says when she found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me he says for I found the peace which I had lost likewise I say unto you that when there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when over one sinner that repented now notice this was a type of the Bride no notice the husband was not at home because if the husband would have came home and found one those things all lost she could have been stoned or divorced or kicked out however want to say it she could have been not been the wife anymore sure just like bashai right now what do those things mean what do those coins represent thank God we have a prophet he says in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet they call it a tablet they put it on their head it had 10 coins it around their head and it was a signed that they were a married woman and no man was to fool around with them no boys to flirt with them he say they were married each one of those coins he says if only had time but I haven't I'm going to try and keep my words as close as possible I could tell you what each one of those coins meant it first it was first placed in there that each coin meant a certain virtue of the woman the first meaning her love towards a husband second her pledged The Virtue to live clean him the third and fourth fifth n9th 10th right he says if you want to look it up he says look in Galatians 5 he gives us the clue what do those 10 coins represents he says look in Galatians 5 he says which is love joy peace right but if you go to Galatians 5 and22 we only find nine but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness and Temperance nine but the prophet said there's 10 the the parable says there're 10 he says against such there is no law but you know the Holy Ghost didn't stop there in Ephesians now notice what was the Ephesians the Ephesians was the mature bride the Ephesians was the mature word that church that came out of the book of Acts the one that uh the prophet of God the one the prophet God likened to Joshua coming up going what into the promised land taking the promised land they would have the 10th coin in a Ephesians 5 verse 8 now notice it's talking about Darkness as well for ye were sometimes Darkness but now you are light in the Lord walk as children of light there's that woman with that candle lit right there looking looking right see now she had Joy she had peace but there was one thing she was missing before the husband came home what was what was she missing what took place in this age he says he say for the fruit he says but the fruit of the spirit is all goodness and righteousness and truth SS of God that last that last coin that last silver coin of Salvation that we needed was what the truth of God the truth of the word of God that had to be what restored that was the one king that was the one coin that was lost all the way back in Ephesians but it's revealed what to the by the Holy Ghost revealed to the prophet these coins meant that and that was the truth of the word the truth what is the truth it's the revelation of the Bible what is the truth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what we need is the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's not word it's not word alone but it's Revelation what upon this church he says Upon This Rock he says I'll build my church upon the Revelation or the truth amen yeah that's exactly right he says now the fruit of the spirit is all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord he says have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather repr prove them amen SS of God everybody got their 10 coins right here absolutely let me check oh yeah we've got the truth we got Spirit we got joy we got all those sort of things and then you can walk up confidently when the when you see when you open your windows and you see the husband coming you can walk to the door and say I've got all 10 I've got all the fruits of the spirit and SS of God that one and it's like like husband husband thank God you're home but notice I had lost one but what it was restored and that was the truth amen now I know what as he come she could catch the revelation of Jesus Christ say yes that's him amen then you'll know is him Amen in fact like the hus the wife the wife will know the husband the wife should know the husband of the word amen now there's something that took place about a couple of Sundays ago and I I got online I started researching some of the secrets of the the Catholic church and the depths of that and how they come in a church and but defile and I seen a lot of things very similar uh but then with that came another testimony of a woman who is married to a uh of a Catholic priest and she did not even know that he was a priest they lived together for so many years 10 15 20 years and she had no idea until the very end that he was she was that he was a priest she obviously didn't know her husband that well that husband was a man of Deceit would you say a man of Bal right sure but what a true true wife of Christ the true wife of Jesus Christ would know him better than anyone else not by just word even though word's good but he'll know that she'll know the moving of the spirit she'll she'll know how he's trying to connect to her amen he'll know she'll know how he's trying to speak to her amen yes now look what the prophet God says here now dealing with Matthew 25 he says now You' got to keep that sleeping virgin that church nominal confessional see you've got to get to that church that's the Jew first the Jew first which is a blinded person waiting on the sideline you got to get up to the next step which is the sleeping virgin who was dilatory he calls the foolish virgin those that missed the Rapture those that were in the word that believe the true word that had the lamps they had the word for their hour but the Holy Ghost was lacking from their life he calls them the sleeping virgin and he calls them dilator right we know those things right now what does dilator mean dilator means literally draw out or extending in time uh uh tardy applied to things uh that you're not supposed to be applying to dor counsels and measures in other words you're late or tardy but remember we're dealing with the bride of Christ what is dilator what is dilator mean in Matthew 25 they failed to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they failed to receive they were failed to be born again they failed to receive the very life of their husband that came into them and sealed them until the day of the Redemption right that was the only that was the one thing that they were late to they did everything else because the Bible called them F virgins right they were clean Pure Living but they failed they were little late to receiving the receiving his life right now do you know of anyone else that's dilator in the in the in the message that brother called dilator let me jump here in fact Let me let me let me read you a quote here brother BR said about himself he says I'm guilty I'm guilty of not doing the job of God like I should do I'm confessing it that I'm wrong I'm asking God to be merciful to me I'm looking out here and seeing the opportunities I've missed you missed any my opportunities witnessing absolutely I have too I have missed because of the petty things little old insignificant things that didn't mean nothing I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel Minister before you I Repent before God and ask God to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of God so you can have the Holy Ghost but are you doing the work of God what is God's perfect will for your life you're going to see what he says here he says everyone telling you to do something to do you've got a program you've got something to do nonsense I know God's program it's written out here in the Bible Bible I'm ashamed to myself as a minister of the Gospel 1 million Souls I've won he says I ought to have won 10 million Souls I'm way behind how many Souls have we won say to God it is difficult there's one young man he just topped out two years ago he's pipe fitter I've been hitting him up with gospel for about two years since I've known him three years and finally we're going back and forth at a job he's like Simon the Greek Orthodox with the truth blah blah there's there's no other truth but Greek Orthodox that's who his wife is you know this and I said brother I want you to listen to one thing I told him I said the Catholic church is the root of the problem he's like brother I'm telling you I don't think I said listen to 50 years in a church of roow and I sent him that one quick by Micah pure I sent that one first one and I said all you have to do is hit play and one by one it'll come and you'll listen to the whole thing two weeks later I got a text from him he said brother he said actually called brother he said Simon thank you for recommending that he goes I had no idea how deep this was I said I didn't even know the depth of how far this thing is entangled in other words it's pretty much gone I said it was gone back in the 1850s it was gone so finally the God God opened his eyes to see that saints of God he opened his eyes to but now where's he at still I said he want the Bible stud let's go silence but at least he saw this now remember these are seeds we're planting we're supposed to be planting seeds what of Truth in the individuals that we know that we that we work around we're around those sort of things we're trying to work live the best kind of life we can right now he says he says I'm way behind he says now look what he says here how about you how many Souls have you won since you've been been in Christ Christianity goes from one to another see how it's supposed to Once once someone gets baptized in the name of Jesus Christ gets the filling of the Holy Ghost whether be whatever kind of time period once you receive the baptism of the ho ghost we should be what witnessing machines we should be living this the kind of life like I say this sometimes the sisters up here come and say say brother Simon come pray for my my friend I want Sav SS of God that's that's that's what I'm talking about what interceding for your loved ones for your friends for your lost people that you know s of God that's that's soul travail see now it's what I heard a brother say one time he says uh the shepherd does not produce sheep sheep produce sheep right it should go from one to another they should be able to look at your lives as a sister a sister's not called to preach but here she is living her life living dressing holy leaving her hair uncut living a clean kind of life and just by walking a certain kind of way acting and with Chase conversation just the way you handle you the the very words that come out of your mouth you can win souls just by the gentleness of your voice how many times it happen I don't know but the Bible says that's how it should be that's the power the sisters have is just that Meek quiet Spirit which is of great price the Bible says he says how many Souls have you won since you've been a Christian if you're not winning Souls you are guilty as you are Barren you have brought shame onto the church and the gospel God have mercy on me it's been a long time since I want a soul we're witnessing I just I in fact the last couple weeks I've hand out many baptism tracks and I said hey read this pray on this this is the way to get baptized one guy completely ignored me the other guy said oh I'll check that out all right check it out never hear from back from but saints were trying to not just and I'll say this a lot of people what what brother Ram say he said the hardest thing that ever to ever take place the hardest thing to take place on Earth is what for one person to believe another you know the thing is the Bible says that uh God uses the foolishness of the world to confound the wise and if there's a I'll like this if there's one that looks like foolish it's I'm the least Smart in my company I'm the smallest in my company they're like Simon I know you're a good plumber but uh really we supposed to do like that they don't have any confidence in me I was running a I was with a job and they put an apprentice to run this big job and I The Apprentice is like hey Sim what I do here I said me I would do this this this he goes I'll call somebody else and I'm like wait a second I've only got nine years to retire and you're going to ask someone else about what I do professionally okay but what it's so hard they won't even believe me in my Plumbing stuff let alone in the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is so difficult for someone to believe a Christian what does it come down to what does it it comes down to election as many as are ordained to life will receive it and that's it SS of God we we witness we teach you know how many times I've offered Bible studies hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds maybe a thousand thousands of times I said hey I'll come over your house do a Bible study no takers but you know just the Lord just brought something to me the other day what does the what does the spirit and the bride say I'll go to you I'll come to you I'll come to you I'll come to hey Bible Study Bible study night sister come on at your house I'll come to you I'll bring pizza no the spirit and the bride say come just give them the invitation just give them invit that's all you have to do come to church here he our pastor preach come to church hear our evangelist preach come to church hear this hear that yeah brother welcome to Club absolutely fantastic I can relate Welcome to My Life welcome that's how it works brother that's just it'll be one in a million very very few the Bible said Jesus said would be saved in this day very very few amen thank you brother for that that's that's an amen yep absolutely praise the Lord praise God that's exactly right now he says if you're not winning souls he says you're guilty he says are baren he you ought to have brought shame he brought shame to the church how many people did you get out here for a Wednesday night prayer meeting if you're not doing it you ought to be ashamed of yourself before Christ you're guilty in your place is at the altar I invite you to come with me for repentance amen saints of God let's get out there and invite people people in invite people to come to what hear the gospel sure now in Luke 10:38 now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain V Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard his word but Martha was cumed about with much serving and came to him and said Lord thust not now care that my sister came left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she come help me so here is a woman the Bible said that Jesus loved Mary Martha and Lazarus and Jesus came into the house they invited Jesus into the house and what did Jesus do Jesus automatic he starts preaching he starts teaching the word of God but here is Martha now remember there's two two separate churches here there's two different women here one was this Mary was like Jesus come in and her eyes were locked on Christ she washed her every Mo movement wased his every eye movement his the way he was walking and then finally found when Jesus found a seat she found a seat as close as she could get without messing with the brothers as close as she could get to him and just started listening while the other sister Martha was busy okay wow I've got Jesus here I've got Jesus here all right do you need a glass of water with with ice with was ice crushed okay just just warm look warm water uh wait no hot water you want some tea okay you guys hungry and all the time Jesus is preaching he's teaching these things and she's all about serving what the people in the house why because not because notice but remember her heart her heart was what Jesus is here but I want to be doing something for I want to be hospitable I want to do these sort of things right and finally she got the point where she's so fed up she's like well this is and she sees her sister there just sitting there doing nothing and she starts she stops what she's doing she's eyeing her sister going and finally says hold the service Jesus Lord I'm doing everything I can for the people around you please tell my sister to help and she says Martha Mary has chosen the better part that's what you're supposed to be doing he says but you are cumbered with so much serving you're overdoing yourself you're extend you're extending all your energy when PA I want you to do is sit here and listen to me speak and Martha was like oh okay now is is Martha a type of the foolish virgin what' Jesus say is Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her now I want to tell you something about Martha a lot of people say well she's foolish virgin she's the type of the foolish virgin she's this that man she's no good and D but if you look what brother Bram said about it Martha she was aware that he was in other words when Jesus entered the house she knew he was there she knew he was preaching and that was the most important thing she knew those things she was I'm sure she was listening because it was the word of God but she's so busy about doing this and that but look what the prophet says he says she was Dil she she he calls him dilator she was busy and things about keeping her house clean yes but when The Showdown came Martha when The Showdown came she showed her color yes sir Mary other what was a showdown when their brother died Lazarus died they gave a call out Jesus our brother Lazarus the one you love is sick he's dying and Jesus said I'll be there a little bit later give me some time and then as soon as Lazarus died they had the ceremony Mary Martha crying oh my brother Mary goes in the house just starts weeping and then about a day after four days Jesus comes walking down and who catches wind of Jesus first Mary or Martha who caught the the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ first it was Martha see so she had she knew what he could do she always was a Believer she was already believed that all things were possible right he says at the time of The Showdown she showed her color yes sir many was sitting weeping because their brother was dead Mary was he says but Martha went out and met the Living Word saints of God at that time before in that first situation looked like Martha was not going to make it but when Christ come on the scene when it was time for a miracle when God when he Supernatural intervention the one was ordained for that was Martha amen she showed that what she was not going to look at in other words Mary was consumed even though she heard the word she was consumed by a dead body by a dead corpse that was impossible there's nothing could be done right here but what Martha went out and thought all things were Possible only believe amen and look if you look at the way she approached him says Lord if you had been here my brother would have not died right but even now what soever thou sayth he says it will take place amen and Jesus said your brother will rise again she goes I know he's going to rise it'll it'll be right then and Jesus said he said I am the resurrection and the life see right there saints of God she approached him correctly there was nothing negative she says I believe I believe I believe in what God Said Lazarus rise up amen it prove Martha was a True Believer what that through Martha what the supernatural take place you know brother bam like in the scripture in uh in John I believe was John 12 or John 10 John 10 11 there with Marth when Lazarus RIS up he Likens that to the Rapture type if you listen to The Rapture Rapture message what and Martha was right in the Battle of it right in the heat of it now notice Martha went out and met the Living Word in the beginning was uh the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made was made was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us he he was the Living Word of God that's right God's word made manest in other words there's there's coming a time if you if you read John 14-17 Jesus is bringing forth Mysteries that was my pastor just preached on this about three four months ago Jesus was bringing forth his last message to the church without Judas and in this message he literally says he says there's coming a time there's coming an hour he say well I will be in the Father the father in me and I will be in you he says and you will know it see in this Darkness saints of God Jesus ordained this this thing to get so dark what's right what's true where are we at how much time do we have left he he he allowed this to be so dark that he's going he himself is going to rise up in us it's not going to be by Our Own Strength it's not going to be by your own intellect or wisdom it's not it never comes by man's Wisdom sints of God it comes by what the wisdom of the Holy Ghost amen but it takes a you have to be a yielded vessel to brother said he's you got to let all your desire your Wills your minds your thoughts your ideas die out and let the word of God come into you s what does that mean I don't know but he'll interpret it on that day we'll find out trust me when it comes to pass we'll say is this not that which was prophesied is this not that which was amen he said yes absolutely now let's continue on he says so Martha went up come up and she fell down at his feet said Lord Lord that's what he was he says if you'd have been here my father my brother would not have died see yes he says but even now whatsoever you ask God God will do it he says oh there we are and there you are no she had Faith but remember she was so busy at the beginning but remember by the time her H her brother died she had a little bit of resting time to think on these things she's watching her brother die praying Jehovah send Jesus way send a letter to Jesus Jesus come please come and she watched Lazarus take the last breath but in her mind what' she say the things that were in her mind she says man if only Jesus would have made it if only the Lord Would Have Made It If Only God would have made it if only he had been here Mary Mary's just crying just crying Marth was just like man if he only been here things would be different right now if he would just got here why because I believe I know if he'd have been here it been done just like that woman to Touch the Hem of His Garment all she do she all she said was I believe I have to touch that I'm going to going to get healed and what the faith in her reached out and touched that what that faith became manifest that Faith activated her hand and what it took place it took place now amen what is it she's acting she wanted to see a miracle so she's finding out what the word says she says I believe the word it's standing there in the form of the Son of God his words is not uh his words is not his not me that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in me he says whatsoever cometh out of thy your your little lips of yours that speaketh I'll have I'll believe it's the commission of of God oh my there we are the Messiah the anointed one he says you are God's anointed one he says you are God's anointed one all you have to do is ask God even though Jesus Is Not In the Flesh right now he's right here going through the service he's right here I'm not a prophet I can't see the the pillar of fire moving but I know this he is here work trying to work on our hearts work on our minds work on our Souls by the preaching of the word amen now let continue now notice a busy wife Matthew 221 Jesus answered and spake to them again many parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is liken to a King which made a marriage for his son and they sent forth his servants to call them that are bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth many servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner and my ox and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage and they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm and another to his merchandise notice Farm they were seemed like they were wealthy they had things there was more important saints of God let's not get too busy for Jesus you are the wife of Jesus Christ I just read a quote uh I'm sorry it was a scripture and the scripture said the evil in the the evil man in his thoughts are not all with God in other words God is not in all his thoughts so that's why as we wake up tomorrow morning as we go home tonight as we do go about our lives tomorrow Christ must be in every thought every one of us has challenges tomorrow what are we going to do for this what are we going to do for that Lord Make A Way Lord God what even in the little things he cares he is a big God but he cares about the little things as well and a lot of times that we can we can ask him for advice we can ask him for his way on the little things the big things the bigger tunnels the bigger roads will open up and say ah there it was but we've got to start on this small way first we can't there's one I like I I really think right now SS God I think the problem with the bride right now is she we are too busy the wife is too busy I'm not calling anyone I'm just saying in general I know this to be true because I watch it in my own life uh this takes I was like this plumbing plumbing has been Cur become a curse everyone wants to Plum it right he said they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them uh but when the king heard of it he was wroth and sent forth his armies and destroy those murderers that burn up their city and burn up their City then said he to the servants the wedding is ready but when but they which were bidden were not worthy so how do you become worthy put Jesus first and let's just start let me just say like this let me start with the simple things just normal Church attendance David by the Holy Ghost said better is one day in his courts than a thousand elsewhere better is one day in his courts than a thousand days elsewhere if you get that Revelation go either therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so those guests went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found both good both bad and good you see who's coming to this Rapture do you see who's coming to the Rapture someone is bad hey hey sister can you go witness that can you go witness that sister no she's pretty bad yeah that's the one that's the guy I mean that's the girl yeah that bad girl with all these you know half his arm tattooed and you know looking like Mike Tyson whatever that's the one God wants her a lot of times the Bible said that's the one that's going to come the ones that look unsavable the ones that look what that's impossible for God the ones that look like they have nothing to do with Christ but remember it's not the outward appearance God lookth at the heart amen God looks right down here who who are they really who are they really so the servants went out to the highways and gathered together all as many has been found both good and bad bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests you know why I say we're too busy not only am I too busy but a lot of times brother bram's talking he says I could just talk to you he says all night 20859 and when I return I will try to get a large place where everybody can be seated then stay for two to three weeks thank you and I'm sure the holy spirit will be more able to work around it you know his whole life his one of his dreams was to literally set aside to find a congregation to come back and literally have two to three weeks of services every night he says shut our businesses down stop going to work quit going to work and just come and seek the Lord why because the Bible said they were up in the eper room for 10 days and the only way the Holy Ghost is going to come is if you get in one place and one Accord that is literally what produced The Book of Acts one place in one Accord a un among all setting aside why because let's say you go on vacation your mind if you're a real vacationer your mind vacation is not about at home your mind you want to escape the things of the world and let's just go on vacation sure you have to pack food and buy food and those things but SS of God when you're on vacation what are you thinking about you're thinking about oh let's go over here let's go over here let's go to to the beach let's go over here and ride this ride wherever you go for vacation you're just there to what enjoy yourself and S of God we can get our set aside and come to church and that kind of way where all things out of your mind are out what God can operate what your minds on the preaching on the teaching what on on the prayer on the what getting in the spirit to getting in the worship the spirit of worship sints of God these things will take place amen it'll became a spiritual vacation from yesterday from today that's what we're that's what we're aiming for oh my goodness I left them right there now continue on here he says in 7 2659 and now tonight and I've been so tired I was up late last night and the vision had me up and then usually Visions work me pretty tired hard that's the reason these meetings I'm trying to maybe take a few nights off preach and then a few nights and have a healing service and then back and I'm trying to make myself adjusted to meetings he says where we're going to get a big tent and stay for three or four weeks at a time in a place he always wanted to do this 8 2265 he says but we've got one of the most Dreadful times to go through he's talking about this coming right before the squeeze right before the Great Tribulation comes he says there's a dreadful times are coming you know what we have right now here now here Golden Memories golden times you're at peace anybody worried about some guy coming here and and with his with a big gun and saying are you a Christian are you a Christian you worried about that right now no we're not worried about that but there's coming a time where that's going to strike that thing those those things are going to take place he says we've got one of the most Dreadful times to go through that ever laid before human beings and I'm just waiting for the hour when we can get everybody can take a chance we can get off from work and spend a few days where we can get up somewhere where I can speak on those plagues and things that's to fall in the last days and throw about two or three weeks together and bring it together if the Lord lets me live to do that inspire me to do those things that will drop in see he always wanted the people what to get away from their lives and come so the presence of God can move his in his way now in closing here I find this I found this so interesting when I was coming driving up my wife was driving and I was sitting there and I was just looking at this in Luke 24 and behold two of them 13 and behold two of them went from the same Day to a village called emus which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them you know why Jesus was able to draw near them they were not working they were just walking together they were traveling they had nothing on their minds something tremendous had just taken place there was nothing on their minds and what they were just walking together together and all their whole bodies their whole uh everything about them was consumed about this Jesus Christ all their heart their thoughts everything was like I thought he was supposed to be the one they were downtrodden they were sad they were all they were broken now look and it came to pass while they commune together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them see SS of God that's why we're supposed to to talk about him all the time we're supposed to be thinking about him all the time what He will draw nigh to you he will come around you and what dwell within you we've got to have our minds and thoughts set on him yeah but now notice he says but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said to him what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad look at Jesus he's an actor he is literally putting on a show but notice he this was all ordained he was waiting this was he knew this was going to take place when he died on the cross and resurrected he knew people were his children his sheep were going to be consumed by him his memory the thoughts of him and everything notice why were they cons why were they concerned about some man that just hang on the cross there was something special about him he was the Messiah he was a prophet something big he was supposed to bring something a change amen right show and then now notice as they began to talk with him Jesus in what in his uh however you say his new body however he drew near to him appeared to them and he asked them a question what an actor talk about an actor he says what manner of communications are these that have said wonder why you why you as you walk why are you so sad what was he doing he was drawing out their heart he's drawing out their affection towards him they're drawing out in other words he wants wants them to confess what he was to them he wanted to know what you thought about him and what he was supposed to do notice he was in fact I this deep down in his heart he was so happy that they were sad why because they wanted to know they wanted to know why why did he leave I tell this one time I got a filling of the Holy Ghost and I was depressed for probably six months why because when you're in that presence of the Holy Ghost and he comes down and he comes and fills you and joy and peace and just love and then all of a sudden you feel it leaving saints of God there's something oh I just we can't wait till we are fully in the presence of God for the rest of our lives for eternity to be stuck with him amen there's one place I want to be in his presence to live there daily all the time with him amen have you been there where the presence of God Amen where the Holy Ghost comes and it's joy unspeakable you shout you jump you praise God you can't even control it you can't stop all you say is I love you I love you love you amen yes and one of them whose name was Copus answered said to him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and H has th not noed the things which are come to pass in these days and he said look at him what things tell me more tell me more the husband says to the wife tell me about myself what do you expected me to do what do you think I was going to do absolutely I want to hear what your thoughts are how do you love me I thought well I know you heard about this and heard about that but what do you think about it amen and they said said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth oh my goodness when when they said his name what I mean when when I was like this when John the Baptist when the when the womb of Elizabeth and he heard Jesus's name is sprung up to life and I wonder how Christ felt when they said Jesus of Nazareth oh my goodness that reflection his name bouncing off him back to them oh my goodness think about it this had to be such a joy to Christ yeah he says what things they said concerning Jesus of Nazareth which is a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people they literally exalted him he says he was the man he say and how the chief priests and the rulers delivered and be condemned to death and crucified but we trusted that it would have been he who should have redeemed Israel look at that they thought this they literally thought this is it we're going to be free Saints we're going to be free there's no more the Romans going to be gone this is we're going to be free Israel is going to become a ation freed again and we're going to have our rulers sit on the throne what with a rod of iron this is Christ this is Jesus this is the Messiah right that's what they thought and they speak out and they speak out but now notice how but notice as they thought about these things look how we rebuke them you know I'll say like this do we have a distorted view of Christ is Jesus just someone who like that'll let you say whatever you want to say is Jesus someone that's going to let you think whatever you want to think if you look at Christ when he's dealing with his disciples he rebuked them every single time why because the word has to set them in order a true shepherd with the staff which represented the word or the name of Jesus Christ has to keep the sheep in line remember he can't lose one so he's got to keep if this sheep's off or this sheep's off he's got to hey hey hey hey hey hey remember the Bible says about how how he had to break the or or or that Pro the parable talk about breaking the leg of the Lamb what because it went off this one kept wandering this one kept wandering so he had to break the lamb and the brother said oh that's kind of cruel he says no it's not it shows the shepherd really loved them amen absolutely and SS God a lot of times when we get off the will of God God will absolutely spank us he will chastise us harder than we think we ought to be chastised in fact oh man that was was really tough but here we are I like this another thing I was on my with my wife two months ago walking and I was frustrated with certain things going on and I was just venting to my wife we walking a dog in the darkness I said bth I said this this this and all of a sudden I sprained my right ankle and I was like Oh and it was good it was a it was a it was a rough one and you know what I kept doing I kept venting and I was like and I sprayed my left I thought I broke both my ankles I'm like oh I got work tomorrow and I look at my wife I said Beth I'm not going to say anything more you know what it took a month for those to heal up that's how bad it was but you know what he was teaching me because you have to control your mouth you wanted you want to vent about something go to prayer he will SP in ways you don't want to get spanked and I need these ankles to work I had to go to work and walk on ladders and this this with my every step you almost feel like it's going to go again right saints of God keep your mouth be in prayer now notice here closing here and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures and the things concerning himself he started preaching to him he started doing Bible study with them he started breaking down the word of God he was what revealing the word he was teaching them that this was see this remember back here this was that remember this back here in David remember David 22 David 24 David 25 uh David 30 David all he remember these things that's what it was and they're going who is this and as they drew nigh into the village with he they went he made those as he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is towards evening he says and the day is far spent and he went to T with them so notice what's the thing now look at this brother says 41664 so he turned around and said all right I'll go in so he got inside he says now that's the main thing whenever you hear something about the word and you're just like H and it draws you just invite Christ in with you invite him in remember that what was remember what was Matthew what was the Leo's thing I behold I stand at the door and knock you've got to invite him into what have communion what are they doing they said H there's something he knows a little bit more than we know let's invite him in I want to hear Lord what you I want to hear what this man has to say though you couldn't understand the word you it's too deep or something other you don't understand it you're full of in other words I've seen this firsthand well brother so and so is too deep so and so is this this preacher is this this preacher sints of God why is why is it too deep for you why are you not understanding these things why is it you know why because the wife is too busy you're too busy if you come in here and your mind's over there if your man's mind's out here if you're thinking about later tonight think tomorrow you are too busy you're too consumed it show that proves you're too consumed for side that's hard I know because I battle too but that proves you're too busy if you can't come here and focus on the word of God because remember brother said he say if you can get in the spirit he said you would receive things he said that's part of the key is receiving the word of God you know brother said he said he says when you heard acts 238 he says the reason you received acts 238 he says because you were in the spirit of the word what everything nothing was nothing is more important except what hearing the word you can literally be in Martha and enter into a merry mode absolutely Martha can be do this then it's thought as soon as it time to listen to the word Martha's like let me hear it right absolutely he says though you couldn't understand the word yeah it's too deep or something other you can't understand it you're so full of different Creeds and this one said that and this one said that your poor mind so you don't think what to so don't think what to think I'll tell you what to do just like they they did say come in Lord and abide with me tonight will you just come in and stay with me now and as it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he he took the bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them you know what the prophet God said he say as these two are walking down the road to Emmas Here Comes Christ and joins them with and the Bible says God withhold the eyes but why couldn't they see him why couldn't they see him because he held his ey their eyes right but when they he was not fully revealed to them not even in the house did they reveal right then but he had to do something that he did before at the communion once he took that bread it was time to eat that it was time to Fellowship time for communion we'll say like that and he took that bread and they were watching they said there's something different about him and as Jesus went and grabbed that piece of bread and he blessed it the way he said things the way he moved and then he broke it in such a way they knew that it was Christ by the moving I'll say this just say by the moving of the spirit they could tell now notice he already preached to them and they still didn't know him SS of God why have where are we at yet we've been here for 20 plus years 2015 20 10 whatever how where you're at in in life we've heard preaching we've had sermon after sermon what the breaking of the word and yet we still haven't recognized that he's fully here if we knew he was here tonight we'd have more response what we'd have more what more hunger for him absolutely we would have all we would know he's here and we what get in the spirit and start worshiping why because he's here Christ is here right now absolutely he says and their eyes were open they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures so even though we sit here service after service and the word opens up wow wow there it is wow look at this Shadow watch watch this type wow look at it run all the way from here Genesis Revelations watch and look in the New Testament and Shadow right here in the old look at all these things but saints of God there's coming a time where we know he's going to be here he's going to reveal himself here because he did that back then but look at the condition of the people brother said he said there's one quote he says it's going to look like the message has failed remember that quote he says it looks like it's going to have failed Brothers we sit at this church no one's getting filled with the Holy Ghost and we're waiting for the Holy Ghost to come down and man I'm so tired I'm exhausted the Bible said they that wait on the Lord he says what God will renew their strength Like an Eagle wait on God don't try to produce it yourself don't try don't try to produce it but what wait on God and he will send the anointing amen let's stand here by God's grace I've been a little longer God let the people tonight though they don't understand the Scriptures it may be a riddle to them just let each one say then Lord Jesus you who are present come and abide with me I have need amen now this obviously wasn't a deep service but saints of God there's certain things we are still Lord God is this right is this right is this right Lord God continue to give us Revelation and understanding on the word of God there's confusion all around the message even complete all kinds of different ideas but what is the truth right we want to know the full truth and I believe the Holy Ghost will bring it at its time right I found a quote about a year and a half ago brother Ram said he says all these doctrinal disputes he says will be solved when p cost comes amen All Hearts Minds clear saints of God let me read more scripture you the the musicians when you come up play here a little bit softly in 2 Corinthians 3:6 who also ha made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life see the spirit giveth life when you sit in a service we should be so in tune with the preaching of the word by with what the spirit is saying that it becomes alive to us it gives us life it gives us strength he says how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious than the Old Testament thans of God in this day this word is powerful this Revelation that received is what life giving I taught in uh nvar on Sunday I said uh what did they say I said we have to ask for Revelation more than anything reality SS of God my mind goes back to that woman that I met that Japanese woman she prayed five hours a day for months and then she started hearing the voice of God and the voice of God told her what to do every day that's what we need we need more communion with him but what what do we have to do I don't know if I put this in here I didn't put the quote in here you know what he said brother Ram said he says we're too busy we're so filled with the cares and concerns of the life that literally we might start the day out right and finish the day out right but what about in between we're supposed to walk in the spirit not just wake up in the spirit and go to sleep in the spirit but we're supposed to walk in the spirit the holy spirit of God Amen how many want to walk in the spirit of God how many want his guidance and protection how many want his Revelation given us through every day what we have need of Amen praise the Lord let's just bow our heads dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and Lord God lord sorry Lord for a little cut up service Lord Lord Jesus Lord just one of your little ones here just trying to do you uh trying to yield to your spirit God the very thought you gave me but Lord God in my heart the dep of My Heart Lord I want to become less busy Lord I want Time Lord I want to take I want to make time to listen to a service every day to study your word thoroughly God not just read a chapter not just read two chapters but Lord study it every day Lord Jesus Lord in the Bible says the bereans were most more noble than than the rest for they uh studied the word with all ready Readiness of mind they were addicted to the ministry Lord Lord Jesus this we have to come up higher we have to come to a spot God lord where you are life and all the rest is death Lord Jesus Lord to where Lord we don't care about what takes place in our lives have we won a soul have we been pleasing to our husband Lord and I know you want us to do our little things but Lord God is not your business the the kingdom the father's business more important God than all things are not we supposed to be concerned about the house of God the spiritual House of God before even our natural house you know the scripture says Lord Jesus
