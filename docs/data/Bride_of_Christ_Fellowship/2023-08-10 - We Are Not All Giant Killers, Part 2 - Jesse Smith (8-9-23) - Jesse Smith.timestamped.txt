[0:00] Matthew chapter 11 verse 11.
[0:03] start there
[0:06] appreciate the feedback I got three or
[0:07] four people that said they really
[0:08] enjoyed that message including my
[0:10] brother
[0:11] so that was a real blessing by God's
[0:13] grace
[0:15] I want to thank Lydia uh
[0:18] Kirsten my wife for sharing a little
[0:20] thought with me for last Wednesday's
[0:22] service
[0:23] Matthew 11 verse 11. let's read that
[0:25] together
[0:26] on three one two three verily I say unto
[0:30] you among them that are born of women
[0:33] there have not risen a greater than John
[0:37] the Baptist
[0:38] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[0:41] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[0:44] amen may God add His blessings to the
[0:46] reading of his word may be seated
[0:55] we're trying to watch your time like I
[0:57] want to get back into school mode uh
[0:58] going to bed at midnight is not a good
[1:00] idea
[1:02] me
[1:04] many times God has given me strength but
[1:06] as I get older I don't want to attempt
[1:07] the Lord
[1:09] um so I gotta get back in kind of this
[1:11] oh I told me I used to preach like 45
[1:13] minutes I thought was is that is that
[1:15] true
[1:15] is that true you tell the truth
[1:20] I try to do less songs like I did four
[1:22] songs I don't know if you noticed that I
[1:23] used to do five songs sometimes six I'm
[1:25] trying to shorten the songs
[1:28] so praise the Lord let's look at uh
[1:30] we're not all giant Killers part two
[1:35] if you would I like to start in uh the
[1:37] book of First Samuel
[1:40] so if you go back there that's kind of
[1:41] where we started with
[1:44] David last week but if you go to First
[1:47] Samuel 13 13 and then just hold your
[1:49] place there I thought I would just go to
[1:51] uh I had this thought you know today
[1:52] about King Saul
[1:54] and he was he was not the Giant Killer
[1:58] although he could have been
[2:00] so Goliath was challenging the king
[2:04] no doubt right
[2:06] and he was bigger than everyone else
[2:09] so of all the people that you'd think
[2:11] would step up to the plate
[2:14] and defeat the giant he was afraid to
[2:19] and so this is a interesting part of the
[2:22] story that said
[2:23] the entire Army of Israel could have
[2:25] been giant Killers everybody had the
[2:28] opportunity
[2:30] right but God of course by this time he
[2:33] knew Saul's character
[2:34] right he knew Saul wouldn't have the
[2:36] character to do it so he had to raise up
[2:38] a ruddy beautiful handsome little boy
[2:41] their teenage boy named David to do it
[2:43] and remember brother brother random said
[2:45] and this had been the case David had a
[2:48] revelation he was going to win
[2:50] that's the only way you and I could ever
[2:52] defy some incredible mountain or Giant
[2:56] in our life
[2:58] right because we could we can give a
[3:01] positive confession let's say for a
[3:02] couple days
[3:04] right I really uh I admire people who
[3:07] can go weeks and months and years with
[3:10] positive confession yeah that takes a
[3:11] lot of Grace right it takes a lot of
[3:15] strength
[3:17] but David from what we know he must have
[3:19] got the vision or he must have gotten
[3:21] the word of the Lord that day
[3:23] it was a fresh revelation
[3:25] it would take a revelation to stand if
[3:28] you're four feet or maybe he was five
[3:29] feet tall
[3:31] it would take a revelation if he's nine
[3:34] or ten feet and you're five feet half
[3:35] his size it would take a revelation to
[3:38] know you're going to speak to him
[3:40] harshly and you're going to defeat him
[3:42] and you're going to cut his head off by
[3:43] the end of the battle
[3:45] it would take a revelation and so
[3:48] we know the Gates of Hell will not
[3:50] Prevail against the Revelation so since
[3:52] David prevailed David had a revelation
[3:54] praise God and of course David is called
[3:56] a prophet in the book of Acts if I'm not
[3:58] mistaken
[4:00] but here we see Saul had a chance to be
[4:02] a giant killer so did every single
[4:05] person in the Army but God knew there
[4:07] would be only one who would receive the
[4:09] Revelation to do it
[4:10] praise God Amen a church I believe
[4:12] according to the scripture
[4:15] I believe any one of those men could
[4:17] have stepped up to do it and God may
[4:19] have honored their faith I said may now
[4:21] why do I say that because in the Bible
[4:23] they asked Jesus Jesus uh who then can
[4:27] get married and what do you say he said
[4:28] some eunuchs were born to be eunuchs
[4:31] right
[4:32] he said some eunuchs are uh some eunuchs
[4:35] are made eunuchs by men other eunuchs
[4:38] just desire to be that way in other
[4:40] words
[4:41] they you know anyone they all had a
[4:43] chance they all could be eunuchs God
[4:45] could allow it God it could be their
[4:46] calling in Life or other people could
[4:48] influence them to be a eunuch and not be
[4:51] married or it could just be their desire
[4:53] to be a eunuch and God would make them
[4:55] their desire right praise God
[4:58] so see if God would allow that if God
[5:01] would honor just a person's desire to be
[5:03] a eunuch then I believe God would honor
[5:05] a person's desire to do a great work for
[5:07] him praise God because they all have
[5:09] their chance they all they all had the
[5:11] opportunity but of course God knew that
[5:14] the fear would set in on day one
[5:16] and then the fear got greater on day two
[5:18] day three four five ten fifteen twenty
[5:21] twenty five thirty and David gets there
[5:23] on day 40. and the whole Camp is
[5:26] paralyzed with fear
[5:28] and if anyone should have stepped up and
[5:31] should have been solved
[5:33] but Saul could not be a giant killer
[5:35] because of his previous sins
[5:38] and this shows a good lesson Had he got
[5:40] had he stayed true to God he could have
[5:42] been the Giant Killer I believe he would
[5:44] have because David because Samuel said
[5:46] that in first Samuel 13 13. you got that
[5:48] Lydia did you have that
[5:49] did you turn to it no did you turn to
[5:51] his Sisterhood
[5:52] could you read that voice please
[5:54] and Samuel said this song God has done
[6:02] empathy for now would the Lord have
[6:04] established thy kingdom upon Israel
[6:07] forever amen thank you Sister We're Not
[6:09] Gonna Give You two glasses but we would
[6:10] if it was Sunday night all right
[6:12] but this is the point I'm making here
[6:15] had Saul obeyed God's word he would have
[6:18] been King instead of David
[6:20] a church that you know if you listen to
[6:22] that Narnia Series right children what
[6:24] does Aslan always say he said you never
[6:25] get to know anyone else's story or what
[6:28] could have been but actually in the
[6:29] Bible we're told one time what could
[6:31] have been
[6:32] there might be more there's probably
[6:33] more I just never had that really
[6:35] thought till recently
[6:36] this is one of the few times we're told
[6:38] had you only done what was right you
[6:41] would have been even greater
[6:43] you would have been a great great man
[6:46] in other words you would have had great
[6:49] Eternal rewards in heaven but because of
[6:51] Disobedience you lost it all
[6:54] this is one of those few times right
[6:57] if you can think of another one uh raise
[6:58] your hand anybody could ever think yeah
[6:59] darling
[7:07] wow that's right we give you two claps
[7:11] if it was Sunday night so what's that
[7:12] say it again
[7:15] Saul and David yeah David
[7:19] right
[7:21] now just apply that to your life so for
[7:23] me you know my one of my greatest
[7:24] struggles is you know if I would do if
[7:26] I'd have done better would God give me a
[7:28] bigger Church
[7:29] thank you
[7:31] I think I've tried to be as faithful as
[7:32] I possibly can I you know just like any
[7:34] Pastor I make mistakes
[7:36] I know to this point I haven't made
[7:38] mistakes that other pastors have made in
[7:39] bigger churches thank God thank God it's
[7:41] only by God's grace
[7:43] but it makes us ask the question right
[7:45] it makes us and the good part about it
[7:47] it just makes us examine Our Lives
[7:49] we don't want to ever live in
[7:51] condemnation I'm gonna say that again
[7:53] there's no condemnation to you if you're
[7:56] in Christ
[7:57] right
[8:01] but God has called us a new works and if
[8:03] we're faithful then the Bible says that
[8:06] God will reward us based upon our
[8:08] obedience
[8:09] right Grace is what saved you but works
[8:12] is what you do out of appreciation for
[8:14] Grace
[8:16] so Saul wasn't very appreciative right
[8:18] he and we know why later because the
[8:20] Bible said Samuel said looked at him and
[8:21] said when you were little on your sight
[8:23] you were a faithful man
[8:26] that's what we got to watch out for
[8:28] right the message movement um we're the
[8:30] greatest of all time like the children
[8:31] just went to a I'm sorry my children
[8:33] children my teenagers
[8:35] 19 teenagers went to a meeting and the
[8:38] first thing the guy preaches is you're
[8:39] the greatest young people of all time
[8:40] now I wonder if he really thought about
[8:42] that that means they're greater than him
[8:46] right because he's a father with
[8:48] teenagers probably
[8:51] and what proof is there there's none
[8:54] there's none
[8:56] the only way I thought they could
[8:57] stretch it is uh if they said well John
[9:00] the Baptist physically was here when
[9:02] Jesus was here so that made him the
[9:04] greatest so whoever is physically here
[9:05] when Jesus here will be the greatest
[9:08] now that could be but we don't have an
[9:10] actual scripture for that
[9:11] that's just that's presuming that that
[9:14] type will repeat again in the New
[9:15] Testament
[9:17] but when brother Branham preached on
[9:19] this they don't see her he said Jesus
[9:21] didn't commend this age for nothing
[9:23] but the rest of Jesus didn't have one
[9:25] good word about this age but yet we know
[9:27] we can be hot and on fire right
[9:30] we're not lukewarm I know that I'm not
[9:32] I'm not lukewarm praise God that's
[9:34] lukewarm I would have stayed at home
[9:35] tonight and taking a shower and just
[9:37] live stream the service right got so hot
[9:39] and sweaty or whatever from the day's
[9:41] work
[9:42] but no we're on fire we want God's mind
[9:44] we want God's word in our minds praise
[9:46] God we want our minds transformed
[9:48] tonight we raise our hands we sing loud
[9:50] we clap we cried we shout we clap we're
[9:52] on fire for Jesus praise God Amen
[9:55] that's right I guess I gotta shout a
[9:58] little louder to prove I'm on fire
[9:59] hallelujah it's true our soul remains on
[10:03] fire
[10:05] Hallelujah
[10:09] amen now you can stay there uh first
[10:10] Samuel 13. actually you know what go to
[10:12] First Samuel 15 17.
[10:15] first Samuel 15 17 Lydia can you just
[10:17] hold that there don't read it yet I
[10:20] looked up in the Easterns Bible
[10:21] dictionary and I was shocked
[10:24] I was reading on Saul he had three signs
[10:28] God had called him to be king
[10:30] I think about you and I
[10:32] mean look at my life do I have three
[10:33] signs God called me to be a pastor not
[10:35] really I mean I got I got maybe two
[10:38] you know numerous people told me even
[10:40] before I was a Christian they knew I was
[10:42] going to be a leader one day
[10:44] and then uh brother Samuel's wife said
[10:46] as soon as she met me she knew I'd be a
[10:47] preacher
[10:48] that's kind of like a two witnesses
[10:51] um
[10:52] there was another one I can't remember
[10:55] I can't think of it now anyways
[10:58] you know some some people feel like oh
[10:59] you got to have a prophecy over your
[11:01] life to know what you're called to do
[11:02] well you might but you might not
[11:04] right
[11:06] so what you have to do is just seek the
[11:09] Lord trust in the Lord keep your heart
[11:11] keep your ground free from Weeds amen if
[11:15] you've got a good and honest heart you
[11:16] will be very fruitful praise God
[11:18] keep all the cares of the world out of
[11:21] your life we got I mean like like the
[11:22] brother said today when I was talking to
[11:23] Mike he's like yeah he said I got too
[11:25] Carefree I didn't even care if the
[11:27] mortgage got paid
[11:28] and he said that was a sin right
[11:31] he got so Carefree just thanking God he
[11:34] got he went overboard and I don't care
[11:35] if we pay the the car the car payment or
[11:38] not it's all good you know we're saved
[11:41] she got way over balanced
[11:44] so he can't be totally carefree and then
[11:46] he says you know caring is a good thing
[11:47] right
[11:48] pressure sometimes is a good thing
[11:51] you want to keep your car you want to
[11:52] keep your house it's those things are
[11:54] good Romeo tells us that there is some
[11:56] tension that's good tension
[11:59] but I just want to read to us here about
[12:01] Saul just you know Lee you know how he
[12:03] came to be like this
[12:08] okay so the first thing I want to read
[12:10] this here
[12:11] his father's she asked his head straight
[12:13] and Saul was sent with a servant to seek
[12:16] for them leaving his home at gibia which
[12:18] is the hill of the god
[12:20] Saul and his servant went toward the
[12:22] Northwest over Mount Ephraim and then
[12:25] turning Northeast they came to the land
[12:27] of shalicia
[12:29] and thence Eastward to the land of
[12:31] shalim and that length came to the
[12:34] district of zuff near Samuel's home at
[12:36] Rhema at this point Saul proposed to
[12:39] return from the three days fruitless
[12:41] search but his servants suggested that
[12:42] they first consult The Seer
[12:44] ing that he was about to offer sacrifice
[12:46] the two hasten and darama and behold
[12:49] Samuel came out against them on his way
[12:52] to the Obama or the height where
[12:55] sacrifice was to be offered and an
[12:57] answer to Saul's question tell me I pray
[12:59] thee where the Sears house is Samuel
[13:01] made himself known to him Samuel had
[13:03] been divinely prepared for his coming if
[13:05] you read that it's in first Samuel
[13:06] chapter nine we're not going to read it
[13:07] but God told Samuel about Saul coming
[13:11] right
[13:12] Samuel had been divinely prepared and
[13:15] received Saul as his guest he took with
[13:17] him
[13:18] Saul to the sacrifice and then after the
[13:20] feast commune with Saul upon the top of
[13:22] his house of all the things that was in
[13:25] his heart imagine that
[13:26] what would you give to be able to talk
[13:29] to brother Branham
[13:30] and tell him every desire in your heart
[13:32] what would you give
[13:34] that's what Saul had Saul got to sit
[13:37] with the prophet brother you know bro
[13:39] it's it's clear Brothers quotes people
[13:42] would wait years to talk to him years
[13:44] they'd be on a waiting list whenever you
[13:46] come back from overseas or whatever he'd
[13:48] come back to Jeffersonville they would
[13:50] wait years and they would get 15-minute
[13:52] interviews
[13:54] and sometimes the brother gave him the
[13:56] answers right away and it was just short
[13:57] it was just five one one two three or
[13:59] four five minutes then they'd be out
[14:01] he'd give them 15 minute imagine 15
[14:04] minutes with a prophet of God what would
[14:06] you say
[14:08] I would say Lord Jesus all right I'd say
[14:10] I would say uh Lord Jesus when I go
[14:12] before the prophet tell me how I can
[14:15] know beyond a shadow of a doubt we've
[14:16] got the Holy Ghost and we got rapturing
[14:18] faith
[14:20] give me that's what I want I mean what's
[14:22] more
[14:23] what's more to know that you're born
[14:25] again and if you're truly born again
[14:27] then you rapturing faith has to happen
[14:29] praise God
[14:30] because the resurrection is already in
[14:33] you everything that's in that seed of
[14:34] the Holy Ghost in you it's Arthur that
[14:36] means if you're born again the Rapture
[14:38] is already in you so what have you got
[14:39] to worry about the Rapture is already in
[14:41] US praise God
[14:43] goodness gracious right
[14:45] I take 15 minutes sister who I take 15.
[14:48] I might squeeze off 16. I say oh excuse
[14:50] me program one more please please turn
[14:53] one more question
[14:56] he got to ask the prophet everything
[14:58] that was on his heart and then Samuel
[15:00] took a viable oil and poured it on his
[15:03] head anointed saw his King over Israel
[15:05] giving him three signs in confirmation
[15:07] of his call to be king
[15:11] three signs talk about a vindication
[15:15] that's why that's why the Bible That's
[15:17] why Samuel said you would have been king
[15:18] forever because God had three signs for
[15:21] you
[15:23] right there's three signs you if you
[15:25] would just would have been a giant
[15:27] killer and church we know that what the
[15:29] real giant was Pride that he had to
[15:31] overcome that was the worst giant of all
[15:33] it wasn't Goliath so much it was his
[15:35] pride he used to be humble but then he
[15:37] got exalted and lifted up
[15:40] right especially when he disobeyed the
[15:43] word of the Lord the straight plain word
[15:45] of the Lord
[15:47] see people people don't realize Church
[15:49] when they stop coming to church they
[15:51] stop paying tithes or any simple any
[15:53] obedience or the women start cutting
[15:55] their hair they don't even realize God
[15:56] is going to make them uh chasten God is
[16:00] going to deal with them and God is going
[16:01] to cut off the blessings
[16:04] praise God
[16:06] just like Saul God is going to cut it
[16:08] off he may let you remain look like
[16:11] you're a good person like Saul got to
[16:13] remain King but he never was the same
[16:15] person because the pride pride got in
[16:17] there
[16:19] and that's why we want to live by every
[16:21] word of God not by fear now we yes we
[16:24] want fear of God not sinful fear we want
[16:27] the fear of the Lord right we want that
[16:28] healthy respect for God but Jesus said
[16:31] if you love me you'll keep my commands
[16:32] in other words we got to keep Jesus as
[16:34] our first love amen right
[16:38] that we can be assured
[16:40] that we will accomplish God's will for
[16:42] our lives
[16:45] I would just I would just be so sad to
[16:48] get to heaven and say well
[16:49] you know but Jesse if you've just been
[16:52] more faithful you could have done this
[16:54] and this and that and helped that many
[16:55] people Church what is our lives all
[16:57] about no man says what is our whole life
[16:58] about helping other people
[17:00] what's the greatest blessing I read it
[17:02] to you last week the greatest blessing
[17:04] is what helping others
[17:07] in other words being a servant
[17:10] I love that it's so simple it makes it
[17:12] makes the gospel so simple love Jesus
[17:15] Christ and love other people right
[17:17] the two greatest Commandments love the
[17:19] Lord thy God with all thy heart soul
[17:20] mind and strength and love thy neighbor
[17:22] as thyself
[17:25] that's what we're working on we're
[17:26] loving the neighbors children like
[17:27] ourselves the neighbors the neighbor
[17:29] girl come over and say can I have some
[17:30] pizza I said yeah I'll cut my pizza
[17:31] right in half here's yours
[17:34] she ran away she was so happy with that
[17:37] pizza that was the pizza that's her
[17:39] bought too right thank you sisters there
[17:41] see everybody plays A Part
[17:46] that's a good pizza too now
[17:49] um let's read first Samuel 15 17. Lydia
[17:51] got that
[18:01] Okay so
[18:02] we can see that when we're humble God
[18:05] will exalt us is that what the Bible
[18:06] says you humble yourself what would God
[18:08] do God will exalt you
[18:10] right humble yourself
[18:13] Saul used to be humble at the beginning
[18:15] he was humble
[18:16] I had a list of uh
[18:18] yeah look at this I guess you don't
[18:22] I'll just read it Saul won almost every
[18:26] battle he fought before he started
[18:28] compromising on God's word
[18:31] isn't that true are we Invincible armies
[18:33] as long as we're obeying God's word
[18:35] he defeated um
[18:37] the ammonites in first Samuel 11.
[18:41] Jonathan killed the Philistine Governor
[18:43] at gibia in first Samuel 13.
[18:47] the Philistines were defeated by
[18:49] Jonathan and Saul in first Samuel 14.
[18:53] I want to read this if you got your
[18:54] Bible go to First Samuel 14 47.
[19:03] first Samuel 14 47 and 48.
[19:07] I've forgotten about this you know I
[19:08] preached on this years ago I think it
[19:09] was back in 2014 or 2013.
[19:12] first Samuel 14 47.
[19:15] so Saul took the kingdom over Israel and
[19:17] fought against all his enemies on every
[19:19] side
[19:20] against Moab and against the children of
[19:22] Ammon against and against Edom and
[19:24] against the kings of zoba and against
[19:26] the Philistines and Withers ever I'm
[19:28] sorry withersoever he turned himself he
[19:30] vexed them look at that on every part of
[19:33] his life he was an Overcomers that sound
[19:35] familiar
[19:36] all right you're alive no matter what
[19:38] you're facing at work no matter what
[19:39] your face in school no matter the trials
[19:41] at church right no matter the trials you
[19:43] might face at Aldi or wherever you go
[19:45] Giant Eagle
[19:46] the trials you might face with your
[19:48] finances your family whatever it is God
[19:51] gives you the victory when you're humble
[19:53] praise God men
[19:55] and I like that he Becks them he
[19:57] tormented the Devils right Jesus the
[20:00] devil said don't torment us before your
[20:02] time
[20:03] see church when we overcome it torments
[20:06] devils
[20:08] Hallelujah it upsets the kingdom of
[20:10] heaven
[20:12] right now we know Satan gets Madness
[20:15] when there's a huge Supernatural miracle
[20:17] because on the day of Pentecost 3 000
[20:19] Souls got saved but they didn't start
[20:21] the persecution until the man of the
[20:23] gate of beautiful was healed the
[20:25] parallel paralytic was healed and then
[20:27] they took him off to jail
[20:29] see church that's when persecution will
[20:31] strike you and I when miracles happen
[20:34] right that's when the real persecution
[20:35] will start
[20:38] but look Saul everywhere he turned
[20:40] victory victory big victory victory
[20:42] everywhere he turned it was Victory all
[20:44] around as long
[20:46] as amen first God is with you when you
[20:49] humble yourself praise God
[20:52] you have nothing to fear Saul had
[20:54] nothing to fear as long as he was humble
[20:57] praise God
[20:58] it don't matter if it's Edom zoba
[21:01] Philistines it don't matter now for us
[21:03] whether it's depression or Pride right
[21:07] or lust or whatever isolation I was
[21:10] looking at I was like I preached five
[21:11] servants on that I forgot about that
[21:13] no matter what the the Temptation
[21:15] depression like I talked to your brother
[21:16] the brother Mike today
[21:18] no matter what it is as long as we're
[21:20] humble as long as we're trusting in
[21:22] Christ they cannot stand before us
[21:24] there's no enemy that can stand against
[21:26] us praise God if God's for me who can be
[21:29] against me praise God
[21:31] who convex you if you're humble and
[21:34] walking in obedience to Jesus Christ
[21:37] no one
[21:39] even Paul walking in the face of death
[21:42] said O Death where is your sting right
[21:45] oh great where is your victory
[21:48] even death staring death in the face
[21:50] church I hope that time goes on and I
[21:53] got to go to the Grave I hope that's the
[21:54] attitude I have when I'm facing death
[21:58] death where's your sting great where's
[22:01] your Victory and I hope by by God's
[22:03] grace if time goes on and we have to go
[22:04] beyond the current of time I hope I I
[22:06] hope you guys see me if I'm on my
[22:07] deathbed in the hospital I'm shaking
[22:09] people's hands like brother Bosworth or
[22:12] something like that I hope there's some
[22:13] Supernatural Vindication praise God
[22:15] hallelujah
[22:18] but look at that no matter where he went
[22:20] as long as he was humble
[22:22] he could have been a giant killer had he
[22:24] remained humble
[22:26] because that's what we got to do we have
[22:28] to remain humble
[22:30] right and then we'll be able to overcome
[22:31] the Giants that we Face whatever armies
[22:35] of the the armies of the devil that come
[22:37] against us will be able to overcome if
[22:40] we stay humble
[22:41] or go too long on that one remember
[22:43] David was better at obeying the word of
[22:46] God first Samuel 15 28 would you pull it
[22:48] up there first Samuel 15 28.
[22:51] let's just be honest Church there's
[22:52] people that are better at obeying the
[22:54] word of God than others
[22:57] right we're all saved by the same Grace
[22:59] but there are people who do a better job
[23:01] of showing appreciation and working for
[23:03] God right that's what we want to be
[23:07] amen and church you're not competing
[23:09] against other people you're competing
[23:10] against your worst enemy which is your
[23:12] sin nature
[23:16] I don't know does is there anyone in
[23:17] here a competitive person I am I am a
[23:19] sore loser I lose it in Scrabble I get
[23:22] mad
[23:23] I don't feel like going punch in a
[23:25] pillow or something like that
[23:28] a little bit
[23:30] wink wink
[23:34] but this is one way you can Channel your
[23:37] competitive nature that's what I do
[23:39] that's what my brother told me I I guess
[23:41] last Wednesday I said they tell me uh
[23:43] the devil come after me and say stop
[23:44] making videos who are you to uh who are
[23:47] you gonna share these quotes who are you
[23:48] to make this and I said if you don't
[23:49] like those I'll make
[23:51] I'll make against you devil
[23:53] I said that brother said you don't like
[23:56] the taste I'm gonna make more tape
[23:59] you can Channel competitive Spirit right
[24:02] does the Bible say we're supposed to run
[24:04] the race like we're the only one who's
[24:05] gonna win right I ran I ran a lot of
[24:08] races I won a lot of races in the
[24:09] natural I was very competitive so I
[24:12] wanted to be competitive I want to run
[24:13] the race for Christ so now
[24:16] now to overcome the devil and also my
[24:19] biggest enemy The Flesh of Jesse Smith
[24:20] that's the enemy I want to overcome
[24:22] right right I'll compete against him
[24:23] like I made him get up this morning at 5
[24:25] 30. get up you lazy bum
[24:28] just want to sleep in every day get up
[24:30] lazy bump
[24:32] s Hallelujah you'll sleep in tomorrow
[24:39] now we know the story of Saul he could
[24:41] have been a giant killer he could have
[24:43] been a king
[24:44] and everything went downhill when he
[24:46] didn't obey the word of God
[24:49] then he spent the think about that the
[24:51] golden years of his life he spent trying
[24:54] to kill David and he actually killed
[24:56] many of the priests
[24:58] he Mur he had them murdered the priests
[25:02] it'd be like it'd be like a Minister's
[25:04] meeting where he got like 50 ministers
[25:05] and Saul came in there and had him all
[25:07] killed just because they helped David
[25:08] and they didn't even know what was going
[25:10] on
[25:12] you talk about mental health issues you
[25:14] know that's a big
[25:17] saw at demonic mental health issues
[25:20] but Church the crazy thing is that the
[25:22] amazing thing is that by the end of his
[25:24] life he got free from it
[25:27] he got free he said David I'll hunt you
[25:29] no more he got free he forgave him right
[25:32] I'm sorry forgive him he repented he
[25:34] didn't have nothing to forgive sorry
[25:36] Saul repented of his sin his jealousy
[25:40] right because he heard the second saw
[25:42] his slaying his thousands and David and
[25:44] ten thousand and he got affect Spirit he
[25:46] got tormented by that
[25:48] Church it don't matter I want the
[25:51] churches to grow I want people to really
[25:53] get the Holy Ghost I don't care if I got
[25:54] a small church or a big church let's
[25:56] just be glad that Jesus saving Souls
[25:58] praise God
[25:59] Jesse saves one praise God the brother
[26:02] of preacher so-and-so saves a hundred
[26:03] Hallelujah
[26:05] brother answer just get if you can't get
[26:07] one say or he said if you can't get a
[26:09] lot saved just get one saved amen just
[26:11] try to get one Soul save praise God
[26:14] are you gonna try to do something for
[26:15] the kingdom of God
[26:19] and now let's see by the end you we know
[26:21] uh Samuel he thought he couldn't hear
[26:24] from God but the Bible makes it seem
[26:26] like he could have heard from God
[26:27] because the Bible says God killed him
[26:29] because he inquired of the witch of
[26:31] Endor
[26:33] and then remember Samuel came up and
[26:34] Samuel said you'll be with me tomorrow
[26:37] so he knew I got one more battle I'm
[26:39] gonna die in this battle
[26:40] but he's still amen he still fought the
[26:43] Lord's battles
[26:45] Hallelujah
[26:47] think about people that might have left
[26:48] the message or they're not they're not
[26:50] very strong in the message as long as
[26:52] they're fighting the Lord's battles
[26:54] that's what counts is that what Jesus
[26:56] some of that uh told his disciples oh
[26:59] they said we forbid this man to cast out
[27:01] devils and Jesus said let him go he said
[27:03] he's getting results let him let him
[27:05] cast out Devils if he's not against us
[27:07] he's for us if your family's not against
[27:09] you then they're for us praise God
[27:12] Hallelujah
[27:14] that encourages me go to second Samuel
[27:17] chapter one
[27:19] it's been a long time since I read this
[27:20] I read this today
[27:22] let's see what David sings by how many
[27:24] believe Dave was anointed with the Holy
[27:25] Ghost
[27:27] what did he say about
[27:30] Saul when Saul died remember this
[27:32] I love that song that that played how
[27:34] the Mighty Fall that's one of just a
[27:36] beautiful soul
[27:39] Saul was mighty when he was humble
[27:43] he couldn't be defeated
[27:46] Philistines
[27:49] soba they all fell before this man
[27:51] because he was humble he was anointed
[27:54] with the spirit of God hallelujah
[27:57] but then he thought he was better bigger
[27:59] stronger better than other people
[28:00] deserve more
[28:03] he wasted so many years
[28:05] guilty of murder
[28:10] verse 17 and David lamented with his
[28:13] lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
[28:15] his son
[28:16] also he made them teach the children of
[28:18] Judah the use of the bow behold it is
[28:21] written in the book of jasher
[28:25] so if they had such an influence they
[28:27] taught them about the bow and arrow look
[28:29] at that they taught him how to war now
[28:30] what's that a type of it's it's a type
[28:32] of us learning how to quote the
[28:33] scriptures praise God
[28:35] right the bow wasn't a Bow Shoot Out an
[28:37] arrow brother man uh says Satan had a
[28:39] bow but no arrows in other words Satan
[28:40] lied and then he's got nothing else
[28:42] right
[28:43] he tells us lie that's all he's got is
[28:45] lies
[28:47] but we've got the word of God brother
[28:49] said it's like a slingshot even it hurts
[28:50] like a bow hallelujah it's the word
[28:53] hallelujah
[28:54] it's a mighty weapon Church how many
[28:55] believe it's a mighty weapon
[28:58] it's an absolute Mighty weapon let me
[29:00] just since I'm on this let me just stop
[29:01] right here and before I read that next
[29:03] the idea of the bow
[29:06] this brother Mike I met today who wrote
[29:07] read my book
[29:09] he got depressed and he got so depressed
[29:12] he was just
[29:14] totally depressed he went on medication
[29:15] and only hurt him
[29:18] um and finally he went to work
[29:20] and he worked at a gym where there's big
[29:22] strong guys and this one strong guy used
[29:24] to be a Christian but he wasn't anymore
[29:26] and he said and he said Mike he said
[29:28] he said your family okay he said yeah
[29:30] your son's okay yeah
[29:33] is your car working okay yeah he said
[29:34] then why are you so depressed you're
[29:37] supposed to be a Christian
[29:38] and that was the turning point he's like
[29:41] I gotta get rid of this but it took him
[29:43] like a year to get over the depression
[29:46] he realized I'm not living a Christian
[29:47] Life
[29:48] if this guy's a former Christian
[29:51] and he's calling me out for my
[29:53] depression I've got to overcome so he
[29:55] got back into church see you're in
[29:57] church
[29:58] Hallelujah and then he slowly got weaned
[30:01] off the medication and he said that
[30:03] demonic Spirit of depression would come
[30:05] back on him every day and you know what
[30:07] he did he didn't get out his phone he
[30:08] got out the Bible
[30:10] and he read Philippians 4 verse 6 be
[30:14] anxious for nothing
[30:15] but in everything by prayer and
[30:17] supplication make your requests known
[30:19] unto God with Thanksgiving and the peace
[30:22] of God will rule your heart
[30:24] right the peace that passes all
[30:25] understanding will keep your hearts and
[30:27] Minds through Jesus Christ and he said
[30:29] he had to read that and once once he
[30:31] read it he said it the peace would come
[30:33] and it lasts for 15 minutes
[30:37] he said 15 minutes later that demon
[30:39] would come back on him and he had to go
[30:40] back and read the same verse until he
[30:43] felt peace
[30:45] he said he had to do that for like a
[30:46] week and then he could read the verse
[30:48] and it would last one hour
[30:51] and that lasted a few weeks
[30:53] and then he would read the verse and it
[30:55] would last all morning
[30:57] but then the demon would come back in
[30:58] the afternoon so you have to go back and
[31:01] pick up his Bible not his fellow Church
[31:02] his Bible
[31:04] I think that I thought that was an
[31:06] interesting thought
[31:08] and then it would just be once a day
[31:10] that demon would come on him to try to
[31:11] get him depressed and he would just go
[31:12] up and he said by that time I got the
[31:14] verses memorized right Hallelujah
[31:21] and then he said you know after a few
[31:22] months uh he said I'm doing this finally
[31:25] it was gone he said every now and then
[31:27] he'll come back on me but he said just
[31:28] go to my Bible in prayer I go to sing
[31:30] and I go to praising God look at that
[31:32] church you want to be free from a devil
[31:33] you want to be free from torment what do
[31:34] you got to do quote the word of God
[31:37] you really we really gotta mean it
[31:40] praise God if we want Victory there's
[31:41] victory for us
[31:43] Saul gave him bows Jonathan gave him
[31:45] bows brother random gave us both Amen
[31:48] brother and gave us powerful scriptures
[31:49] Hallelujah they're already in the Bible
[31:51] but he pointed them out let's use the
[31:53] Weaponry God has given to us praise God
[31:56] amen
[31:59] now let's finish what he said verse 19
[32:00] the beauty of Israel is slaying upon thy
[32:03] high places how are the mighty Fallen
[32:07] so Saul was a beautiful person in God's
[32:09] eyes when he was forgiven
[32:15] I'm skipping down
[32:20] he said don't tell the enemies like in
[32:21] verse 20 21 verse 20 uh two from the
[32:25] blood of the slain from the fat of the
[32:26] Mighty the bow of Jonathan turned out
[32:28] back and the sort of Soul return not
[32:30] empty so Saul did get some victories he
[32:33] didn't defeat some people in the battle
[32:35] but ultimately remember he even fell on
[32:37] his own sword
[32:38] I tried to commit suicide he even failed
[32:40] in that
[32:42] now look at this verse 23 Saul Jonathan
[32:44] were lovely and pleasant in their lives
[32:45] and in their death they were not divided
[32:48] they were swifter than eagles they were
[32:50] stronger than Lions now look at that
[32:51] Jonathan what was his heart his heart
[32:54] was knit to who
[32:56] Dave
[32:57] so Jonathan and David were in it
[32:59] together and then the Bible said
[33:00] Jonathan and Saul were knit together so
[33:03] see he had forgiven I'm sorry he had
[33:06] been forgiven he repented of his sins
[33:07] and now Saul Jonathan and David all
[33:10] their hearts were together as one
[33:15] so when he died he died with a honest
[33:18] heart he repented of his sins
[33:20] he was for Jonathan he wasn't going
[33:23] after David anymore
[33:25] praise God
[33:27] verse 24 you Daughters of Israel weep
[33:30] oversaw who clothed you in Scarlet with
[33:32] other Delights who put on ornaments of
[33:34] gold upon your power now look at this
[33:35] don't forget what the King has done for
[33:37] you no in other words God doesn't forget
[33:39] all your works of service church amen
[33:41] hallelujah
[33:43] David does I don't see one time David
[33:45] brings up he hunted me down and God pay
[33:47] him back for all the evil that he did
[33:49] for me
[33:50] he brings out all the good see what the
[33:52] Holy Spirit does Church the Holy Spirit
[33:55] forgives all of our trespasses
[33:59] that'll encourage us
[34:01] amen remember remember Abraham Abraham
[34:04] staggered not yet I could show you seven
[34:05] times he staggered
[34:07] but God said I've forgiven it all
[34:09] Abraham staggered not because of the
[34:11] Forgiveness of Christ
[34:17] so don't forget God's not going to
[34:19] forget what you've done for him verse 25
[34:21] how are the mighty fallen in the midst
[34:23] of the battle oh Jonathan that was slain
[34:25] in nine high places I am distressed with
[34:27] thee my brother Jonathan very pleasant
[34:28] as thou been unto me thy love to me was
[34:31] wonderful passing the love of women
[34:35] how are the mighty fallen and the
[34:37] weapons of war perished
[34:41] but see he could have been a giant
[34:43] killer but he couldn't even for many
[34:45] years he couldn't kill the giant of
[34:47] Pride within himself and disobeying the
[34:50] word of God
[34:52] he just thought well I don't have to
[34:53] obey all that
[34:55] I have to obey all the words that the
[34:57] pastor is preaching right for us
[35:01] do I really have to do all the commands
[35:03] of God to really have to do it all
[35:06] yes we want to because we want to show
[35:07] Jesus how much we love him
[35:10] praise God
[35:16] and now I'm going to get to my text now
[35:17] and I got 25 minutes while I'm an hour
[35:19] here
[35:21] okay
[35:22] so
[35:24] um we can see how Saul wasn't a giant
[35:26] killer but he wasn't Overcomer at the
[35:29] end of his life he wasn't overcomer
[35:31] he repented of his sins and the Holy
[35:35] Spirit records him as a Mighty Man
[35:38] is that right
[35:39] oh that reminds me that Mighty Man
[35:40] series I'm gonna have to go ahead go I
[35:42] can preach another sermon on that Saul
[35:44] was the mighty man I could go through
[35:45] all his battles
[35:47] he's a Mighty Man the mighty of Fallen
[35:49] Jonathan of course Mighty as well
[35:52] I want to I just want to close let me
[35:54] close with John the Baptist now brother
[35:56] man said this about John the Baptist he
[35:58] said why was he greater than all the
[35:59] prophets if you're a spiritual you'll
[36:01] catch something why was he the greatest
[36:03] all the other prophets had spoken of the
[36:05] Messiah but John introduced him he was
[36:08] the one that presented him
[36:12] now here's another good quote I just
[36:13] found this one today I hadn't heard this
[36:15] one before uh from that time 1961.
[36:19] of all that's ever been born of a woman
[36:21] there's not a greater man than John the
[36:23] Baptist yes sir what was it he received
[36:27] the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb
[36:29] right now look what he says next
[36:32] he met God in his mother's womb
[36:37] amen
[36:39] he was changed
[36:42] his before he was born he was already
[36:45] changed
[36:47] now that's in it that's a very
[36:50] scriptural thought because the Bible
[36:51] said he got the Holy Ghost in his
[36:53] mother's womb that means his mind right
[36:56] could have been his soul because Jesus
[36:57] had not died for his sins we've been
[36:58] over that John 7 37-39 that's one of
[37:02] those major verses you got to remember
[37:03] when thinking about the Holy Ghost
[37:07] so that means John was given a new
[37:10] spirit because Ezekiel said new heart
[37:12] new spirit my spirit well he could not
[37:15] have repented yet right because he's a
[37:17] baby
[37:20] I've had eight babies and I've never
[37:21] seen him repent yet
[37:26] before they come out
[37:28] so what God had to do he had to wait on
[37:31] the new heart and God had to let his
[37:33] anointing be on his mind that's what the
[37:35] Bible said he was filled with the holy
[37:36] ghost from his mother's womb mercy God
[37:40] had already changed him no wonder he was
[37:43] greater than David
[37:44] no wonder he was greater than Moses
[37:47] remember I said this before John the
[37:49] Baptist never murdered a man he never
[37:50] committed adultery
[37:53] he was a holy man why because he was
[37:56] changed from his mother's womb praise
[37:58] God
[38:01] this is what made him the greatest man
[38:03] in the Old Testament praise God
[38:05] no other man was like that as far as I
[38:07] know
[38:09] but see not only did it introduce Jesus
[38:12] but let me say this he also had the life
[38:14] to back it up in other words he lived a
[38:16] hold of your life than everybody else in
[38:18] the Old Testament and
[38:20] because he was the only one born with a
[38:23] new spirit
[38:26] the scripture is clear on this
[38:29] that was a fresh quote I never seen that
[38:31] before I can't wait to preach at other
[38:32] churches too they're really gonna like
[38:33] that one Luke chapter 1 verse 14.
[38:52] so I might have a part three on this
[38:54] we'll see I don't know I want to close
[38:56] about eight o'clock
[39:00] Luke 1 14.
[39:04] thank you for your patience sir
[39:09] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[39:11] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[39:13] should be great in the sight of the Lord
[39:14] now this great how's he going to be
[39:15] great in the side lord well he's already
[39:16] got the Holy Ghost in his mind
[39:19] think about that
[39:20] let's just stop for a moment when was
[39:22] the last time
[39:24] hopefully it was today
[39:26] when was the last time your mind was
[39:29] boiling
[39:30] with the things of God's word I mean
[39:32] it's all you can think about all day
[39:34] like that brother I was telling talking
[39:35] to you today
[39:36] he said when he got saved he read the
[39:39] Bible in one week
[39:41] a church I've never read it that fast
[39:44] talk about boiling
[39:47] that's a lot of verses in one week
[39:52] so whatever so think of the time when
[39:53] your mind was most boiling you couldn't
[39:55] get enough of the word you just want to
[39:57] talk and pray and read about the Bible
[39:59] all the time listen to the sermons
[40:01] and that's what John had when he was
[40:03] born
[40:05] Hallelujah in the church said
[40:07] it's a holy ghost mind your mind is
[40:09] Anointed with the Holy Ghost that's all
[40:11] you can think about word the word Jesus
[40:13] love him how they worship praise that
[40:15] sacrifice that's all you think about
[40:19] it that was John
[40:25] see you see what you see what is great
[40:26] in the sight of God now Church how many
[40:28] members did he have in his home Church
[40:31] not many
[40:34] Hallelujah
[40:36] he had a little bit of a following
[40:39] but how long how long did his church uh
[40:41] last six months
[40:44] the greatest it just proves church God
[40:46] can put greatness in small things right
[40:52] right Jesus only preached for three and
[40:54] a half years this world I could not feel
[40:57] this room with the books of all the
[40:58] things that he did let alone this world
[41:03] Simon one time Marvel he said I can't
[41:05] leave Jesse you on that troll mystery
[41:06] book you have all those thoughts in your
[41:07] mind
[41:08] I'm like that's nothing I mean I respect
[41:10] assignment I love Simon you know but I'm
[41:12] just saying like yeah compare that to
[41:15] Jesus he's so great we can't none of us
[41:17] can even touch you
[41:18] I mean
[41:20] this whole world all the books about all
[41:23] the works all the service he did for the
[41:25] father Hallelujah
[41:28] talk about greatness what's greatness in
[41:30] the sight of the Lord
[41:31] having your mind Anointed with the Holy
[41:33] Ghost
[41:36] he show I'm sorry and and shall drink
[41:38] neither wine nor strong drink so look at
[41:40] that physical
[41:41] consecration
[41:45] so for the Holy Ghost Toll Brothers
[41:46] don't you smoke drink or do anything
[41:48] like that right
[41:49] same type of Nazarite vow
[41:53] uh what's interesting too brother was
[41:55] allowed to drink wine at Communion
[41:57] right to obey the word of God in other
[42:00] words don't drink wine or alcohol in a
[42:03] sinful manner
[42:04] okay right
[42:06] and he should be filled with the Holy
[42:08] Ghost even from his mother's womb and
[42:09] many of the children Lord of Israel
[42:11] shall he turns the Lord their God look
[42:13] he's going to win many Souls look at
[42:14] this he's going to win many Souls
[42:17] why is he so great
[42:19] he had God's mind he had an anointing on
[42:22] his mind all the time he won many people
[42:25] to the Lord his life was consecrated he
[42:27] wasn't he wasn't living like other
[42:29] people
[42:34] right we don't see him ever lie the only
[42:37] bad thing we see is once he's in prison
[42:38] he doubts his vision right are you the
[42:42] Messiah or do we look for another
[42:44] right that's the only thing we can see
[42:46] about John anybody think of anything
[42:48] else is I missed something in the
[42:49] scripture have I probably forgot
[42:51] something right that's probably what it
[42:52] was
[42:58] verse 17 here remember this because he
[43:00] fulfilled the first part of the Malachi
[43:02] four five and six prophecy he should go
[43:04] before him in the spirit and power be
[43:06] lying us to turn the hearts of the
[43:07] fathers of the children and the
[43:09] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[43:10] make ready of people prepared for the
[43:12] Lord
[43:14] the church remember he never did one
[43:16] miracle
[43:18] sister who he never raised the Dead
[43:21] Elijah did Elisha did
[43:26] he never told a lame man to walk
[43:31] right
[43:33] but he was still greater in God's sight
[43:36] than all those Old Testament prophets
[43:40] so now we can have a better understand
[43:42] what is greatness
[43:46] what does it mean to be great in the
[43:47] sight of the Lord in 2023.
[43:51] what does that mean
[43:54] someone who's anointed by the Holy
[43:56] Spirit
[43:58] praise God
[44:00] you try to turn people's hearts to the
[44:03] Lord
[44:06] go down to verse 76.
[44:10] great chapter here
[44:13] and thou child shall be called the
[44:15] prophet of the highest for he should go
[44:16] before the face of the Lord to prepare
[44:19] his ways to give knowledge of Salvation
[44:20] unto his people by the remission of the
[44:22] sins so why was he so great he was so
[44:25] dedicated he had his body disciplined
[44:27] right
[44:29] his mind was always about the things of
[44:31] God and he gave the people the word of
[44:33] God so they could repent they could make
[44:34] their own decision repent get their sins
[44:36] forgiven and get ready for Jesus
[44:39] many people he turned to the Lord
[44:41] this made him great
[44:47] oh it's beautiful
[44:49] look at verse uh
[44:52] look at verse 80. and the child grew and
[44:54] whacked strong in spirit and was in the
[44:56] desert to the day of his showing unto
[44:58] Israel did you catch that what he
[45:00] whacked strong in his What Spirit his
[45:03] mind
[45:04] wife thought he already had the Holy
[45:06] Ghost in his mind
[45:08] church he grew in his anointing
[45:11] and the church said
[45:13] he got greater more scripture more
[45:16] understanding more preaching
[45:19] this is a man that looked people in the
[45:21] face and said Europe your father the
[45:23] devil you are a brood of devils
[45:27] you are a brood of serpents
[45:31] who's going to warn you from going to
[45:33] hell in other words
[45:35] plead the wrath of God
[45:37] this man was not a
[45:40] this was the greatest man in the Old
[45:44] Testament
[45:46] did he kill any Giants
[45:48] that's the point I want to bring out was
[45:51] he a giant killer
[45:53] well it depends what you mean right
[45:55] I'm not trying to trick you Saints
[45:58] I'm not trying to catch anybody
[46:03] I'll say like this through the power of
[46:05] God he killed all the Temptations the
[46:07] giant Temptations in his flesh he was
[46:09] able to kill all those
[46:10] so yes he was a giant killer in one way
[46:14] but he didn't have all the other
[46:15] Miracles like everybody else
[46:19] now I can see I'm not going to be able
[46:21] to finish this thought here tonight
[46:24] let's read a few more uh Luke 3 3 Luke 3
[46:27] 3 since we're already in the wooden Loop
[46:32] and he came into all the country about
[46:34] Jordan preaching the baptism of
[46:35] repentance for the remission of sins as
[46:37] is written the book of the words of
[46:38] Isaiah the prophet saying the voice of
[46:40] one crying the word is prepare you the
[46:42] way of the Lord make us pass straight
[46:45] so this is this must be a great thing
[46:47] you're crying out to Sinners repent come
[46:50] get baptized God will forgive your sins
[46:52] now we get to do in the church right
[46:55] but this man was out there in the public
[46:57] doing it he's out there in the
[46:59] wilderness doing it he lifted up his
[47:01] Voice Hallelujah
[47:03] this is a great man
[47:06] the greatest man
[47:08] in the Old Testament
[47:11] but in Mark chapter 1 verse 2 Matthew
[47:13] Mark Luke
[47:20] as is written the prophets behold I send
[47:22] my messenger before thy face which shall
[47:24] prepare thy way before Thee the voice of
[47:26] one crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[47:28] the way the Lord make his path straight
[47:30] Hallelujah
[47:33] prepare the way of the Lord make his
[47:36] past right Hallelujah
[47:38] be prepared messiah's coming
[47:42] can I say like this get your lamps
[47:44] trimmed and clear Hallelujah Glory
[47:48] the Midnight Cry the bridegroom cometh
[47:50] go yet to meet him rise and trim your
[47:52] lands praise God the Lord is coming
[47:55] Hallelujah right it's the spirit of
[47:56] Elijah The Same Spirit The Same Spirit
[47:58] that called out for through John the
[48:00] Baptist now calls out through brother
[48:02] Brandon praise God
[48:03] rise and trim your Lambs get ready the
[48:05] Messiah is coming Hallelujah so I'm glad
[48:08] I was saying that laser song on Sunday
[48:09] Hallelujah
[48:11] rise and turn your lamps Church
[48:16] let's go to uh Matthew 3 verse 7.
[48:20] Matthew chapter 3 verse 7. I'm almost
[48:22] done
[48:30] now just says a little testimony I felt
[48:32] led to preach on uh
[48:35] Sunday night on peer pressure and little
[48:38] did I know that night one of my children
[48:41] had to overcome peer pressure and she
[48:42] overcame
[48:44] so I'm looking at it right now so
[48:46] everybody knows
[48:48] one of our friends come over just like
[48:50] the Holy Spirit just my thinking I
[48:53] didn't know what's going to happen but
[48:55] the the the the friend brought over a
[48:57] phone and said we need to listen to this
[48:59] or watch this is that right something
[49:00] like that what would you say
[49:04] the show
[49:08] what'd you say
[49:13] we'll give you two claps on Sunday night
[49:17] but she said it was hard I said that's
[49:19] exactly right overcoming sin and
[49:21] Temptation peer pressure is always hard
[49:24] but the more she keeps her mind on the
[49:26] word of God
[49:27] the greater Victory she's going to have
[49:30] if John the Baptist grew in his Spirit
[49:32] don't you think we'll grow in our spirit
[49:34] too right
[49:36] is that right
[49:37] he had the Holy Ghost in his mother's
[49:39] womb but look that anointing could grow
[49:40] as he grew
[49:44] Hallelujah
[49:47] three seven did I read that when he saw
[49:49] the many of the Pharisees and said she's
[49:51] come to this baptism he said to them oh
[49:53] my dear precious Brothers my lovely
[49:55] Brothers is that what he said
[49:57] laughs no he didn't give it a nice
[50:00] little welcome to them oh Generation of
[50:03] Vipers who hath warned you to flee from
[50:05] the Wrath to come bring forth therefore
[50:08] fruits meat for repentance
[50:10] and think not to say within yourselves
[50:12] we have brother Brandon as our father
[50:13] and just make it just make a breakdown
[50:15] to our day
[50:18] for I send you that God is able to of
[50:20] these stones to raise up children to
[50:21] Abraham
[50:23] and now also the ax is laid to the root
[50:25] of the trees therefore every tree which
[50:26] bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
[50:29] down and cast in the fire think of that
[50:31] he was saying because you have crop root
[50:33] the ax is going to come and church when
[50:35] did it come 40 years later when Titus
[50:37] came
[50:39] the ax is going to be laid to the root
[50:42] of the tree they're going to be cut down
[50:44] they were all killed by Titus
[50:47] if they didn't die of a you know old age
[50:49] before that
[50:51] see God wasn't playing that this was an
[50:52] age this was a time I'm not God's not
[50:54] playing games
[50:58] but sea turtles again
[51:00] if God wants you to be like this like
[51:01] the brother and I were saying they've
[51:02] got you know sometimes Jesus got off the
[51:03] ropes you know when he peed out the
[51:04] temple other times he was so gentle
[51:08] when God wants you to be like that
[51:09] you'll be anointed to do it
[51:11] I did a video yesterday on the last
[51:13] Jeffersonville video and the brother
[51:14] texted me he said wow he said the fiery
[51:17] Indian nation of the Holy Ghost was on
[51:18] you and I said you're right it was I
[51:21] wasn't as nice on that video
[51:23] it just is indignation of the Holy
[51:25] Spirit I pray beforehand
[51:28] and sometimes when when God wants you to
[51:30] talk away he's going to have you
[51:32] praise God
[51:36] no
[51:41] I'm almost at clubs in here so let me uh
[51:43] try to find a place here to close
[51:49] uh let's close with this uh Matthew 23
[51:52] 11.
[51:55] foreign
[51:59] to where I wanted to get
[52:02] that's okay it was more of just like a
[52:03] Bible study here tonight
[52:05] at the 23 11 and 12. I hope you do 11
[52:08] and 12.
[52:10] now Jesus tells us plainly what is
[52:12] greatness in God's sight
[52:15] is it a big church
[52:17] is it a millionaire
[52:21] uh has been able to memorize the Bible
[52:25] does it be able to write books no
[52:29] what is the what is greatness in God's
[52:30] sight serving other people
[52:33] so let's apply that to John the Baptist
[52:36] why was John the greatest he was the
[52:39] greatest servant
[52:40] is that right camera
[52:46] not like David and Moses he didn't serve
[52:48] his flesh you know
[52:49] he only served God's purpose
[52:53] that's what made him great and he only
[52:55] had public service for six months David
[52:58] Raine Church 40 years
[53:05] what is the percentage of that like
[53:07] it's not even
[53:10] half of one year half of one year is
[53:13] greater than 40 years and that don't
[53:15] even count the time all those years he
[53:17] defeated Goliath and before he was King
[53:21] and David was a man after God's Own
[53:23] Heart praise God
[53:27] the Baptist man
[53:31] maybe a man Anointed with the heart of
[53:33] God I don't know
[53:35] because he had it he was changed from
[53:37] his mother's womb
[53:38] that's going to stick with me for a few
[53:40] days here I might preach it tomorrow
[53:43] Junction City he was a changed person
[53:46] from his mother's womb
[53:49] brother Ram said God loved that Spirit
[53:51] of Elijah because it was so obedient to
[53:53] the word of God that's why he uses it
[53:56] again and again
[53:57] praise God
[54:00] whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a
[54:02] base and he that shall humble himself
[54:04] shall be exalted
[54:07] praise God
[54:09] so we're not all giant Killers but we're
[54:12] all Overcomers
[54:15] so as I close tonight what is God asking
[54:19] you and I to overcome tonight
[54:23] or as I said last week is there
[54:25] something that's been a giant problem
[54:27] for you this week
[54:30] that God would like you to overcome
[54:35] it's very simple to see how it's going
[54:36] to happen like with Saul or anyone else
[54:38] we've got to repent and anything we've
[54:40] done wrong
[54:41] we've got to Humble ourselves
[54:45] it's humility defeats every enemy we see
[54:48] that in Saul's life
[54:50] because what is humility again it's not
[54:52] saying oh I'm nothing I'm so weak I'm
[54:54] nobody humility is saying God I'm taking
[54:55] your way not mine
[54:59] Satan loves that when we said oh I'm so
[55:00] weak I'm the weakest Christian I'm the
[55:02] uh I'm the weakest link in the church
[55:04] Satan just loves that
[55:07] that's not humility
[55:10] humility is saying Jesus forgive me now
[55:12] I'm going to obey your word
[55:14] that's the Simplicity of humility I'm
[55:17] taking your way instead of my way
[55:21] how many believe that
[55:23] it has to be so simple
[55:27] God hides himself in Simplicity praise
[55:31] God even a fool Isaiah 35 will not air
[55:35] in this way of the King's Highway of
[55:38] Holiness the way of holiness
[55:42] if John could do that
[55:44] in six months of ministry and he could
[55:46] be the greatest
[55:49] by being changed well then we can surely
[55:52] we can look up to God and say Lord
[55:53] change me tonight
[55:55] change me tonight musician's gonna come
[55:57] let's stay in the working
[55:59] it always comes out different than I
[56:01] thought I thought I'd get a lot further
[56:02] than that but
[56:04] I trust you were blessed tonight praise
[56:05] God
[56:10] church we want to be great fruit
[56:12] producing Christians
[56:15] we we don't want to argue and debate
[56:17] we're greater than whatever age we
[56:19] should care less about that but what we
[56:21] should desire is Lord I want to bring
[56:23] forth great fruit for your name
[56:26] right
[56:27] Jesus said the father is glorified more
[56:30] when we bring forth fruit unto God much
[56:33] fruit unto God
[56:35] well how do I get fruit I gotta weed out
[56:37] all the bad things in my life
[56:41] I gotta humble myself
[56:43] and be a servant to others let's buy our
[56:45] heads
[56:49] let's take a moment think about our
[56:50] lives here
[57:00] [Music]
[57:02] is there anything in our lives tonight
[57:05] that needs changed
[57:07] change made all the difference in John
[57:10] the Baptist life
[57:18] Saul's life as long as he was humble he
[57:22] vexed the enemy
[57:24] [Music]
[57:29] the church as long as we're humble
[57:31] as long as we're serving others we can
[57:34] overcome the kingdom of darkness
[57:40] as we walk in the Kingdom of Light the
[57:43] kingdom of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[57:55] we'll be thanking for these scriptures
[57:57] we've heard tonight Lord God
[57:59] [Music]
[58:03] starting to need to see all those
[58:04] scriptures about Saul could have been a
[58:06] giant killer
[58:08] could have and left fear get in the way
[58:11] you let pride get in the way he let
[58:13] Disobedience get in the way he let
