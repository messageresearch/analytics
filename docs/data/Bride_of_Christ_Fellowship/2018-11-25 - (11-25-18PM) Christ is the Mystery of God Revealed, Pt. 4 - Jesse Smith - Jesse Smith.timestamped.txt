[30:54] he's our piece that we know it's perfect
[30:56] peace
[30:57] praise God let's think about us tonight
[30:59] now the grace of Lord we like to just
[31:01] read a couple scriptures here let me
[31:07] turn this on I like to just read a
[31:10] familiar text the met the next main
[31:12] thought in Christ is the mystery brother
[31:15] Ram deals with his revelation so let's
[31:17] just go back to Matthew 16 a very
[31:18] familiar scripture on Revelation and
[31:23] that's where I want to end up I want to
[31:25] end this message with some thoughts on
[31:28] Revelation I appreciate the feedback
[31:32] from this morning I'm glad people were
[31:34] blessed by the Word of God it just you
[31:36] know just as I've been studying Christ
[31:38] as the mystery just it's meant more to
[31:39] me I've understood predestination
[31:41] election and foreknowledge better and
[31:45] like I said why why do we need to know
[31:47] better so it will encourage us to make
[31:49] the right choice because we know our
[31:51] choices have eternal consequences or
[31:54] rewards and we want the rewards praise
[31:57] God we don't want consequences and well
[32:00] we failed here we failed there we want
[32:03] rewards not to be selfish but to glorify
[32:06] Christ remember no matter what crown you
[32:08] get what are you gonna do with it what
[32:09] we're gonna throw down at his feet and
[32:11] then arm again he comes back and he's
[32:13] crowned with many crowns so any crown I
[32:16] get I already know it's going back to
[32:17] Jesus I don't want to keep her brother
[32:20] Bank I don't give my crown to Christ
[32:23] it's what good have I done nothing
[32:25] jesus said apart from me you can do
[32:27] nothing so so Christ gets all the glory
[32:31] praise God so let's look to the Word of
[32:35] God here Matthew 16 and I just want to
[32:39] read that I believe it 16 18 sorry I'm
[32:43] not there yet and I did post this on
[32:48] Facebook I've been trying to do one
[32:49] Facebook post a day the last three days
[32:51] I've been trying to get up early and do
[32:53] that and just try to get people to hear
[32:56] the word of God and hopefully catch some
[32:58] soul out there
[33:03] we're 17 and 18 Matthew 16 17 and 18 of
[33:07] course we were familiar with this
[33:09] brother man made some powerful
[33:11] statements in Christ the mystery and I
[33:13] want to get to those tonight by the end
[33:14] of the message verse 17 and jesus
[33:18] answered and said to him blessed art
[33:20] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[33:22] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[33:24] father which is in heaven and that's the
[33:28] point brother man's making Jesus did not
[33:31] give the revelation to Peter that's when
[33:37] brother Graham says when Jesus has flesh
[33:38] and blood but RAM said Jesus is saying I
[33:41] didn't give it to you my own human life
[33:44] my own human ability did not give you
[33:48] the revelation of Who I am
[33:49] it came from the Father that's quite a
[33:53] statement verse 18 and I say also unto
[33:57] thee thou that thou art Peter and upon
[33:59] this rock the revelation of who he was
[34:03] and is I will build my church and the
[34:06] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[34:09] it Amen let's take that before the Lord
[34:12] how many thankful for this revelation
[34:15] let's pray that the gates of hell if
[34:18] there is coming against you now that
[34:19] they'll be cast down by the revelation
[34:21] that God has given to you
[34:22] Heavenly Father Lord we know Lord you
[34:25] promised to be with us you said you
[34:27] never leave us or forsake us and you
[34:28] said when the enemy comes in like a
[34:30] flood the Spirit of God will raise up a
[34:32] standard against him and all we're
[34:34] grateful for that and we know that
[34:36] standard Lord is the Holy Spirit's
[34:38] anointing Lord God through the
[34:40] revelation of who you are in other words
[34:43] because you've revealed to us who you
[34:45] are Lord in the midst of the trial you
[34:48] anoint us to break every yoke Lord
[34:50] you'll anoint us to overcome for that's
[34:53] why we have the anointing Lord God is to
[34:56] be like you dear God to overcome the
[34:58] enemy for Lord Satan savourest not the
[35:01] things of God but Lord we do we savour
[35:04] we love the things of God speak to us
[35:07] and our Lord God again in your divine
[35:09] presence Heavenly Father were fully
[35:11] trusting in you we want more of you Lord
[35:13] God Laodicea
[35:15] they say we have need of nothing but
[35:17] lower we come here as as as soldiers
[35:20] tired soldiers or wounded or weary war
[35:24] war experienced soldiers throughout the
[35:27] week and we say Lord we need more
[35:28] strength today encourage our strengthen
[35:31] us on this day of rest I mean we might
[35:33] be encouraged and edified and prepared
[35:35] for the battles ahead in Jesus Christ's
[35:38] name and the church said Amen god bless
[35:40] you - bein seated praise God so this
[35:45] message of course you know Christ a
[35:46] mystery God revealed his meaning more to
[35:48] me all the time I hope I hope to you as
[35:50] well I want to focus on the revelation
[35:53] tonight but before we get there let me I
[35:55] want to just preach an hour by God's
[35:57] grace I preach the hour and a half this
[35:59] morning it felt like that but I want to
[36:03] just try to be at an hour tonight by
[36:04] God's grace and then we'll of course you
[36:08] know go our ways and so forth Lord
[36:10] willin I want to start with this thought
[36:12] brother Graham after he preaches on the
[36:14] thoughts from this morning like
[36:15] predestination we looked at he starts
[36:18] looking at Adam and Eve typing Christ
[36:21] and the church and he says this he says
[36:24] when Eve went away from the word she
[36:27] went away from her mate and when the
[36:30] church goes away from the word to a
[36:32] denomination she rejects and commits
[36:35] fornication with the world of man's
[36:38] wisdom rejecting the authority of God's
[36:40] Word and the Bible said committing
[36:45] spiritual fornications so any word in
[36:48] the Bible that's rejected or is any self
[36:51] interpretation put to it
[36:53] it's absolutely rejecting and committing
[36:56] adultery against the God that is your
[36:59] husband now that's a mouthful so that's
[37:02] what that's what denominations do sister
[37:04] Tonya they write up they write up as you
[37:06] know it probably sister Tonya they write
[37:08] up their beliefs and then they put a
[37:09] period and they say that's all God can
[37:11] do and that and that's what makes that
[37:14] denomination different from another
[37:16] denomination but the real church doesn't
[37:19] have a Creed book the Bible is their
[37:21] Creed book now we have a statement of
[37:23] faith on our website but I wrote it in a
[37:26] made sure that it says you know anything
[37:28] else
[37:28] reveal we're gonna believe that because
[37:31] we don't have a Creed we have life
[37:34] because the word is life the word is
[37:37] spirit and the word is life so when a
[37:40] denomination puts a period what they've
[37:42] done is they've limited what God can do
[37:44] they say this is all that God can do God
[37:47] can do nothing else but we're supposed
[37:49] to be a people of faith that said God
[37:51] will do all that's in this word and he
[37:53] can even do more outside this word but
[37:56] we know and we're safe because we know
[37:58] he's going to do things according to us
[37:59] we heard he could do things outside his
[38:02] word but we're just comfortable with
[38:03] what do you know what he's gonna do in
[38:05] the Word of God we know he'll always do
[38:07] something that lines up with the word so
[38:10] we don't want to be an adulterous Church
[38:13] we don't want to add to the Word of God
[38:15] or take away from the Word of God and
[38:17] that's what denominations do so that's
[38:22] what brother Barron likens Eve unto Eve
[38:24] of course believe Satan's lie and what
[38:27] did Satan do Satan took away from the
[38:29] word and said oh the word doesn't mean
[38:30] that it's okay you can eat of the tree
[38:33] of knowledge good evil it's not gonna
[38:34] hurt your walk with God because you'll
[38:36] be like God you'll be more spiritual
[38:38] actually if you break God's Word a
[38:40] little bit and compromise you're
[38:41] actually more spiritual you be more like
[38:44] God that's nonsense and look at the
[38:46] effects and all the effects we have
[38:48] today is sin death destruction pain
[38:50] suffering all because she believes
[38:53] Satan's lie and took the consequences
[38:56] away from God's Word now remember
[38:58] program said don't get down on the Adam
[38:59] and Eve he said you would have done the
[39:01] same thing I would have the same thing
[39:03] if we're in the Garden of Eden because
[39:05] we're human and God wanted Express in
[39:08] order God wanted to be a savior so in
[39:10] order for God to be a savior somebody
[39:11] had to be saved somebody had to be lost
[39:14] aren't you glad you're lost but now
[39:16] you're found amen
[39:17] I didn't like me lost like that sheep we
[39:19] saw this morning but thank God he found
[39:21] me amen and he found me in the nick of
[39:24] time praise God
[39:25] now Birmingham says this you see nice
[39:27] and now you see God's threefold purpose
[39:29] to express himself the world's lost now
[39:33] he has to express himself in a man to
[39:35] become a savior through the
[39:36] reconciliation of blood from the cross
[39:38] now he had to become that to die in
[39:42] to save and bring himself back into the
[39:44] church to have preeminence in his church
[39:46] amen hallelujah now remember it cannot
[39:52] will not and never will never has been a
[39:54] denomination he has to have the
[39:56] preeminence and he is the word and how
[39:59] can any be any Creed be injected in
[40:01] there
[40:02] it turns the church into a prostitute to
[40:05] take any man's word or any Creed or any
[40:08] denomination it can be quickly as marked
[40:12] in revelation 17 as a and harlots
[40:16] is that right now think about this
[40:21] I've been studying and I've been writing
[40:23] another book now my waiting the the the
[40:26] the one who's supposed to work on my
[40:27] book now her dad's passing away so it's
[40:29] getting my books getting delayed even
[40:31] further but that's okay cuz God is
[40:32] teaching me patience
[40:34] I've got 42,000 words I'm just waiting
[40:37] for her to fit you know get everything
[40:38] lined up but in the mid afternoon the
[40:41] twelve New Testament mysteries well in
[40:43] the fourth parable Jesus tells us in
[40:45] Matthew 13 he talks about a woman who
[40:48] hid leaven in three measures of barley
[40:52] measures of wheat right and bro Graham
[40:55] said that that is the the root that's
[40:57] the the Father Son Holy Ghost live the
[41:00] Trinity and notice when she when did she
[41:03] hide in there she hided that in there at
[41:05] the beginning before the bread was baked
[41:07] right she had to hide it in there before
[41:09] and that's what this Roman Catholic
[41:12] Church has done back there the word
[41:14] Trinity was turned in 180
[41:17] oh yeah 180 ad let me know that so John
[41:21] John the Revelator was on the Isle of
[41:23] Patmos in 80 90 so 90 years later that
[41:28] Trinity doctrine was hatched and so see
[41:32] that that that leaven was hid by the
[41:34] woman which woman hid leaven in the meal
[41:36] the Roman Catholic Church and look today
[41:40] how all of her doctrine is leavened over
[41:44] and looked today at all the abuse claims
[41:47] on the Roman Catholic Church one
[41:50] thousand children that were reported in
[41:53] Pennsylvania were abused by Roman
[41:55] the priests in Pennsylvania alone 1,000
[41:58] and there was abortions and deaths and
[42:01] suicides and all these kind of things
[42:02] that come about from this in church
[42:06] that's that that's the mother church and
[42:10] Christ does not have preeminence in that
[42:12] church in that denomination because
[42:14] they've said this is all that we have
[42:16] and then they add to the word they take
[42:18] the word away but see brother have said
[42:22] anything that joins itself with a Creed
[42:24] outside the Bible is a on the side
[42:26] of God and we've got to make sure we
[42:29] don't limit God either we've got to make
[42:32] sure we don't add to the word of God
[42:34] because it's easy to do pressure with
[42:37] brother Branham people can add all kinds
[42:38] of things like oh he's gonna resurrect
[42:39] and come back and he's gonna have to fly
[42:41] around the world you know I don't know
[42:43] plane or something like that or though
[42:46] we need to oh they'll say the name of
[42:48] God is William Branham or something some
[42:50] evil sins like that and we got to make
[42:53] sure we don't add even one word or take
[42:56] one word away I emailed those brothers
[42:58] back at voice of God this week and they
[43:00] said well Jesse we watched a little bit
[43:02] of your sermons we liked how you said
[43:05] you don't want to argue about it and
[43:06] they said and they said well we don't
[43:08] want to talk about every word brother
[43:10] Branham said thus saith the Lord because
[43:11] we don't want to argue and so I wrote
[43:13] back I said well brothers I don't want
[43:15] to argue either I said I just want to
[43:18] point out the fact that brother Branham
[43:19] said to make him infallible his tommyrot
[43:23] and it's awful and I said that's I said
[43:26] I just want to keep you from idolatry I
[43:28] can show you the email because look how
[43:31] easy it is you know we think all we got
[43:33] the message we're baptized in Jesus
[43:34] Christ's name well that's more because
[43:36] you got the truth that's more reason
[43:38] Satan wants to target us because we've
[43:41] got the truth brother Ram said all of
[43:43] Hell is against this revelation why do
[43:48] we have so many struggles right if so
[43:49] many people get battling and struggling
[43:51] because all of Hell is against the name
[43:54] of Jesus Christ oh but we don't but what
[43:58] we do is we don't add to the word we
[44:00] don't take from the word we run into the
[44:02] name of Lord it's our strong tower amen
[44:05] when there's a struggle when there's a
[44:07] dispute or there's a doctrinal problem
[44:09] we don't run away from the word we run
[44:11] to the word oh yes so of course that's
[44:17] what we're supposed to see around the
[44:18] message we're gonna see a lot of
[44:21] fanatics we're going to see a lot of
[44:22] people carrying around and things like
[44:24] that like I was talking with a pastor
[44:25] last night there's churches I've been to
[44:27] they let women they let women pray for
[44:31] the pray for the prayer requests they'll
[44:33] just call our women to pray for the
[44:34] prayer requests and that's giving a
[44:37] woman a place of authority that woman
[44:40] has the we'd say that woman has the
[44:41] floor oh my
[44:45] and there's other churches you know that
[44:46] that let women be deacons and sir in the
[44:48] message that serve Communion and see
[44:53] what are they doing they're making
[44:53] little compromises and then you watch
[44:57] and and I've start with the pastor and
[44:59] we watch their lives and people that
[45:00] we've known people that have come to
[45:02] this church and call me their pastor
[45:04] I've done these things I'm gonna get to
[45:07] that by the end of this message
[45:08] Lord willing allow their they allow
[45:11] these things or believe these things and
[45:13] then you watch their live search and
[45:16] their spiritual instability they can't
[45:19] stick they can't be faithful and stable
[45:23] and serve God with stability because
[45:26] they get off on little things and and
[45:28] they they make doctrinal excuses and
[45:31] they they preach false doctrine and and
[45:34] because of that they can't be stable and
[45:36] faithful and solid the Bible says when
[45:40] there's a false doctrine you're tossed
[45:41] like a wave to and fro back and forth in
[45:44] and out that's what they are in and out
[45:45] of churches in and out back and forth
[45:47] all over the place but you when you find
[45:49] out real solid Christian they're like a
[45:51] solid rock the Bible said they're like a
[45:53] pillar in the house of God amen
[45:56] hallelujah but who else do we think
[45:59] Satan's gonna attack he's going to
[46:00] attack this message but thank God God
[46:03] will raise up a standard against him
[46:05] haha hallelujah thank God that we have
[46:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ for the
[46:10] gates of hell can't prevail against this
[46:12] revelation and what is revelation again
[46:15] it's the will of God revelation is the
[46:19] faith in the will of God that's what it
[46:21] is revelation
[46:23] the will of God amen now I just want to
[46:26] say that that we are the programs
[46:28] preaching about denominations but we've
[46:30] got to make sure the word has
[46:31] preeminence and that we don't become a
[46:34] denomination and I'll get to some things
[46:39] at the end too now brother having said
[46:42] he fusions one which we read this
[46:43] morning Ephesians one about chosen and
[46:46] predestination proves the threefold
[46:48] manifestation of Jesus Christ remember
[46:51] what was the threefold manifestation for
[46:54] God to reveal himself and have
[46:55] preeminence in Jesus Christ second was
[46:57] for Jesus to have preeminence in the
[46:59] church by the Holy Ghost and the third
[47:02] full purpose of God was to take that
[47:04] Holy Ghost filled bride and take her
[47:05] back to Eden the future home the New
[47:08] Jerusalem hallelujah amen that's the
[47:11] three-fold purpose of God and brother
[47:13] have said so see were predestinated to
[47:16] the adoption in a Hobbesian chapter 1
[47:20] now brother have says see what he's
[47:23] doing
[47:23] Jesus is restoring the fallen Eve so Eve
[47:27] fell in the beginning but God is
[47:29] bringing back a woman at the end because
[47:31] Eve a woman fell at the beginning God's
[47:34] bringing back the woman at the end which
[47:36] he calls the second Eve and that's who
[47:39] you are
[47:40] amen you're not the first thing you're
[47:42] not falling in to sin but you know it
[47:45] disgracefully but God is raising you up
[47:48] out of sin amen
[47:50] you're not falling to send in an
[47:53] organization and following the light and
[47:55] taking away from the scripture what
[47:57] you're actually doing is being raised up
[47:59] on the miry clay and being seated in
[48:02] heavenly places in Christ Jesus where
[48:05] the second Eve he says now look what he
[48:09] says here notice as God opened up the
[48:12] side of Adam and took out Eve by his own
[48:15] flesh and blood and divided his spirit
[48:18] from masculine and feminine to feminine
[48:20] and put it in Eve he took the rib from
[48:25] under his side and made eat our Eve out
[48:27] of it huh me know that God put Adam to
[48:29] sleep and he opened him up and pulled
[48:31] out a rib and he not only the rib but he
[48:34] pulled out the spirit as
[48:36] the feminist spirit that was in him and
[48:38] then he took that ribbon that spirit and
[48:40] he formed a body of a woman and now Adam
[48:43] had a wife Eve out from his very being
[48:46] praise God his wife came out of him amen
[48:51] and brother may have said God did the
[48:53] same thing he said are in Christ when
[48:58] the blood and the water came out and he
[49:01] said Jesus Christ is the word and taking
[49:04] the word of making up his church
[49:06] Eve's he back to himself again redeemed
[49:10] by the blood that was come from his own
[49:13] body so I want to read this here the
[49:16] type was Adam was opened up to bring
[49:18] forth the bride and brother man said
[49:21] Jesus was pierced and opened up to bring
[49:25] forth the blood that would bring forth
[49:28] his bride amen huh thank you Lord you
[49:32] got yet just as Adam had to be opened up
[49:36] God had to open up Christ so his blood
[49:38] would come down and be poured out and
[49:41] that blood shed member without remission
[49:44] of sin I'm sorry without shedding of
[49:45] blood there's no remission of sin so
[49:48] Jesus by being opened up and pierced by
[49:51] that Roman soldier it let out the blood
[49:54] that redeemed us and brought us forth
[49:57] amen
[49:59] hallelujah that's a beautiful type there
[50:02] so butter him so said so see see the
[50:06] prefigure he opened up Adams side and
[50:08] took a part of his flesh to make Eve the
[50:11] bride now has to be the word for he is
[50:15] the word she cannot stand on Crete she
[50:18] cannot stand on denomination she kept
[50:20] not staying on good behavior she has to
[50:23] stand alone on the word because she's a
[50:25] part of it she was taken from Christ hey
[50:29] man now where were we taken from Christ
[50:31] from his mind remember that now some
[50:34] people make it sound like when Jesus was
[50:36] pierced we were that water in the blood
[50:38] now I can't see that by scripture my
[50:41] personally myself I can't see that
[50:42] because all that blood eventually dried
[50:45] up on the ground and then too
[50:49] make that you'd have to make that blood
[50:50] you know somehow get dirt and then all
[50:52] of our bodies come with a dead I don't
[50:54] see how that works myself what I see is
[50:56] that he's Pierce and that blood brought
[50:59] us forth because that blood allowed us
[51:02] to be forgiven by the Holy Spirit and
[51:04] then we can come forth by the baptism of
[51:06] the Holy Spirit and we can be sons and
[51:09] daughters unto God that's the way I can
[51:11] see it by the word of god so church we
[51:15] are standing on the word because we were
[51:18] taken out of the mind of Christ like we
[51:21] saw this morning we went from thought to
[51:24] flesh then theophany and then glorified
[51:26] body right now we're in the flesh we're
[51:28] in the second stage of manifestation
[51:32] hallelujah some of our friends that have
[51:34] passed on James browning in different
[51:35] ones they're in that third stage already
[51:37] in the theophany amen
[51:39] oh mercy thank you Jesus now I want to
[51:46] move on this down brother Branham said
[51:48] each Old Testament prophet expressed
[51:51] part of the word but Christ was the
[51:54] fullness of the word so program starts
[51:56] with Moses and then he goes to Joseph
[51:58] and David and he shows how all their
[52:01] types in their life were prefiguring
[52:03] Jesus Christ he said but all men typed
[52:06] out Christ but God was holding back the
[52:09] great revelation until the last days
[52:12] amen
[52:15] so I want to now move on to this thought
[52:18] now program cuts into the New Testament
[52:20] age and he said now the mystery is his
[52:25] coming so God brought forth Christ and
[52:28] that was the first fold of the mystery
[52:29] and now the rapture of course is the
[52:32] second fold of the mystery as well and
[52:35] he said he hid all these mysteries and
[52:39] saved them for the last days and now
[52:44] brother Branham says you know he speaks
[52:45] of his ministry in Revelation 10 7 with
[52:48] the cloud and I remember I preached that
[52:50] message and that was the message that
[52:52] took one person out of our church that
[52:55] was though that was the the one message
[52:57] that drove them away was when I preached
[52:59] clothed with the cloud and
[53:02] you know my wife and I were talking you
[53:04] know we were like well I wonder why I
[53:05] was led to preach that and then now I
[53:07] see why God was bringing forth the truth
[53:09] to drive out any unbelief like I said
[53:13] this morning it's hard when you're the
[53:14] reason people leave it's hard to deal
[53:16] with that but I can rest because I know
[53:18] I appreciate with a sincere heart and I
[53:20] preach what the Word of God says amen
[53:22] because we know the cloud has come in
[53:25] this hour we know that by God's grace
[53:28] but brother MCs he's saying how the
[53:31] Ministry of Revelation 10 1 to 7 has
[53:34] been revealing in this day this second
[53:37] full purpose because remember the
[53:39] mysteries of God must be finished how
[53:42] many understand that the mystery of God
[53:44] must be finished and bowed and said
[53:46] through the cloud God was showing he was
[53:49] going to bring together his body to
[53:52] reveal and tied together the loose ends
[53:55] and finish the mystery so brother have
[53:58] said Luther preached justification he
[54:01] just pounded justification he just
[54:03] pounded it week after week year after
[54:05] year you're justified by the blood
[54:07] you're justified by faith but that
[54:10] wasn't the end of it and then Wesley
[54:12] come and preach save the case you guys
[54:13] live a sanctified life you got in Rome
[54:16] and said he pounded that in and then the
[54:17] Xu's just rebounded there are gifts of
[54:19] the Holy Spirit we have faith for gifts
[54:21] to the Holy Spirit he said but the
[54:23] revelations had 1 to 7 is to reveal
[54:26] everything what it's all about and what
[54:29] was all this about what was
[54:30] justification sanctification restoration
[54:33] gifts Church what was it all about it
[54:35] was about finishing the mystery of God
[54:37] so that the bride will be complete
[54:39] she'll be finished should have the full
[54:41] life of Christ and Christ can rapture
[54:43] her off the earth hey man like I heard a
[54:48] brother dramatized he said can you
[54:50] imagine you were Martin Luther was your
[54:54] pastor and you say well I need to get
[54:56] some I need to get some counseling from
[54:58] Martin Luther you go over to his house
[55:01] you walk into Martin come on in you walk
[55:04] into his office how you ambassador and
[55:07] he's smoking a cigar and he's got a
[55:10] cement big beer can there because he
[55:12] drank beer right
[55:16] while he had justification something was
[55:20] still lacking he had he had a
[55:22] supernatural power to write letters and
[55:24] fight against the Roman Catholic Church
[55:27] II to protest the Roman Catholic Church
[55:29] in the Pope he had power do that but God
[55:31] couldn't rapture the church at that
[55:33] point because she wasn't sanctified amen
[55:36] hallelujah
[55:37] that's why God had a new justification
[55:39] st. vacation and John Wesley there was
[55:41] some some truth where he had some really
[55:43] close intimate friends that were women
[55:45] other than his wife and there was rumors
[55:47] you know for some reason now I don't
[55:50] think he did anything in it any any
[55:53] infidelity or anything like that but
[55:55] there was just whispers around and his
[55:56] wife even wrote about it about how he
[55:59] would maybe got too close to some women
[56:01] and so there was concerns there and then
[56:05] the sujin street was good the gifts was
[56:07] good but then a few years later they had
[56:09] denominated and said everybody's got to
[56:11] speak in tongues now not the true
[56:12] believers but so see God couldn't
[56:15] rapture that God one of the people who
[56:18] lived all over that were justified
[56:20] sanctified believed in the power of God
[56:22] and now know God and the mysteries of
[56:25] God are finished and they're conformed
[56:28] to the image of Christ they're just like
[56:30] that original church amen
[56:31] hallelujah that twenty years remember
[56:35] Church there was twenty years from the
[56:36] time the Holy Ghost fell in a t-33 to
[56:40] the Ephesians Age beginning in AD 53 how
[56:44] many remember that the church ages
[56:46] didn't begin to eighty fifty three so
[56:48] what was that twenty year period that
[56:49] was a church without spot wrinkle or
[56:51] blemish praise God
[56:54] there's a 20-year period in there
[56:56] because remember the ephesian church age
[56:58] it started in 1853 and pretty soon they
[57:01] have left their first love how many
[57:02] understand what I'm talking about that's
[57:06] why we got to make sure we keep our
[57:07] first love to Jesus all the time and
[57:09] that proved it there twenty year period
[57:12] from 33 to 53
[57:15] it was the church was on fire and for
[57:18] the Amen they didn't have any Bibles did
[57:19] you know that they didn't have a New
[57:21] Testament during that time so what they
[57:23] leaned upon they leaned upon the Old
[57:25] Testament and the unction of the Holy
[57:27] Spirit just in their relate their prayer
[57:29] car
[57:30] you know that's what they lead upon and
[57:32] here we've got a Bible at church age
[57:34] milk we got all these message books all
[57:36] these things like that we're saying god
[57:37] help us because it's a darker hour but
[57:41] he's able to help us we just got to cry
[57:43] out to him amen so see he couldn't
[57:46] rapture a Luther Wesley or Azusa he had
[57:49] to get all this together and brother man
[57:52] who said it he says that Ezekiel dry
[57:55] bones there was four steps to that right
[57:58] getting the bones together and then I
[58:02] can forget the second one then this your
[58:04] sinews then the skin and on the four
[58:06] step life came in and that's what we
[58:09] have today the Holy Spirit gives us the
[58:11] full life if you come to my office
[58:13] you're not going to see cigarette butts
[58:15] in there you're not going to see beer
[58:17] cans in there you're gonna see a life I
[58:20] try to live honestly in godly and holy
[58:24] before Jesus Christ amen
[58:27] praise God does everybody understand
[58:30] that program said then comes the
[58:34] revelation after Sousa Street then comes
[58:36] the revelation to reveal what it's all
[58:38] about he said then he comes back in the
[58:41] last days and picks up all the mysteries
[58:43] and clearly explains it oh I'm so glad
[58:45] we clearly understand predestination
[58:47] I like this morning reveal it it's all
[58:52] the last days when this great mystery
[58:54] that God had in his heart is being
[58:56] revealed so this is God's heart brother
[58:59] beg God's heart is this message being
[59:01] revealed to me being revealed to you
[59:04] it's God's heart this is what he wants
[59:07] the church to be a church that believes
[59:09] the word and the word only program said
[59:13] remember he said do you get it if you
[59:14] fail come back to this tape again I
[59:16] don't know how much longer I'll be with
[59:18] you remember this is the truth of thus
[59:20] saith the Lord it's the truth it's the
[59:22] scripture so revelation 10 7 is thus
[59:25] saith the Lord God has finished the
[59:28] mystery of God and here we are we're
[59:31] waiting to the Great Commission is
[59:32] fulfilled were prophesying again to
[59:34] Nations we're sending missionaries to
[59:36] send every nation to so they can hear
[59:38] the word of God
[59:39] it's thus saith the Lord
[59:43] and now here's I want to get to this
[59:46] talk and oh my god playing I got 36
[59:48] minutes okay praise the Lord let's all
[59:50] take a deep breath brother man can you
[59:52] hit that fan there I'm kind of getting
[59:53] hot in here can you hit that forgive me
[59:56] I was really hot this morning
[59:59] McGriff says now in the Webster's
[1:00:02] dictionary reveal its look at revelation
[1:00:04] now is to make known especially in
[1:00:07] divine truth he said that's what
[1:00:09] revelation is he says revelation is
[1:00:12] Christ's way of making himself known to
[1:00:15] his church
[1:00:19] mmmm said now notice he made himself
[1:00:22] known to Peter when he said well who
[1:00:25] does man think I am and program says
[1:00:27] today all Jesus was a philosopher a
[1:00:30] social religion he's a good man we
[1:00:32] believe his teachings okay it's a
[1:00:34] subject to live by I think it all make
[1:00:36] us better if we did well that's a Santa
[1:00:39] Claus story oh well you know Jesus makes
[1:00:44] everybody better that's Santa Claus
[1:00:45] story he says it's not the expressions
[1:00:49] of some church we should express
[1:00:51] something it's a life that you don't
[1:00:54] live yourself but he comes in and lives
[1:00:57] by himself and you become a prisoner to
[1:01:00] any human intellectual being at all
[1:01:02] you're led by the Spirit amen
[1:01:05] he says you have the mind of Christ
[1:01:08] Christ expresses himself through you
[1:01:10] shows you that it's him and not you how
[1:01:14] many can honestly look at your lives and
[1:01:16] see when you obey the Word of God it's
[1:01:18] not you it's him now because you you
[1:01:21] used to fall into these things used to
[1:01:24] fall into temptation but now you do
[1:01:26] because it's Christ in you now his
[1:01:30] spirit leading you his spirit guiding
[1:01:32] you that's what program says you don't
[1:01:34] live the life by yourself it's God's
[1:01:36] anointing in you now program says this
[1:01:43] he talks about how very very small the
[1:01:49] true revelation are the number of people
[1:01:51] who receive the revelation is it's so
[1:01:53] small and we read that this morning it's
[1:01:55] the narrow path Jesus
[1:01:57] said few there be that find it now he
[1:02:00] says men in the millions of the days of
[1:02:02] Noah
[1:02:03] he asked eight to be saved
[1:02:06] eight eight actually received the
[1:02:09] revelation to going to Noah's Ark eight
[1:02:11] in the millions and program says are the
[1:02:14] millions of Jesus day he asked twelve to
[1:02:17] be his disciples twelve out of millions
[1:02:20] twelve the boat man said I will say
[1:02:24] there'll be eight save now don't don't
[1:02:26] get that all wrong I never said that he
[1:02:29] says but it'll be a small group I tell
[1:02:32] you that first rate as the gay and
[1:02:33] narrows the way and few there be that
[1:02:35] find it and let me just say this church
[1:02:39] I wrote this down at my notes I want to
[1:02:41] make sure I say everyone that wants to
[1:02:44] be in the rapture will be in the rapture
[1:02:48] there will not be one foolish virgin who
[1:02:51] will be on the earth and say boy I
[1:02:53] really wanted to be in the rapture no
[1:02:56] everyone who wants to be in the rapture
[1:02:58] will be in the rapture because the Bible
[1:03:01] said God will give you the desires of
[1:03:04] your heart
[1:03:05] amen there's no doubt there'll be a lot
[1:03:11] of people that say oh that would have
[1:03:12] been nice not enough to go through the
[1:03:13] tribulation and give my life and be
[1:03:15] hunted down or whatever's going to
[1:03:16] happen the Tribulation Period but
[1:03:19] everyone that listen everybody the days
[1:03:21] of Noah that wanted to be in the ark was
[1:03:23] in the ark right everybody that one to
[1:03:29] follow Jesus in his day was following
[1:03:32] Jesus everybody that wanted to do it and
[1:03:36] remember God before knew who would want
[1:03:38] to be there so God ordained that all
[1:03:41] those who want to be saved God planned
[1:03:44] and elected and chose and predestinated
[1:03:46] the events so that all that really
[1:03:48] wanted to be there would be there
[1:03:50] that's right church I hope you catch
[1:03:54] that if you really want if you and I are
[1:03:57] really wanting to be in a rapture more
[1:03:59] than anything else
[1:03:59] we'll get it because what we'll do is
[1:04:02] we'll do what Jesus set we'll lay aside
[1:04:04] everything that does easily beset us and
[1:04:06] we'll run the race with perseverance
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] our cross daily and we'll follow those
[1:04:12] bloody footprints wherever it leads us
[1:04:14] we'll just keep following those because
[1:04:15] we'll gladly lay aside anything that
[1:04:18] stumbles us we'll lay it aside and we'll
[1:04:20] say God give me my heart's desire
[1:04:22] my heart's desires be born again to go
[1:04:24] to the meeting in the air and God said
[1:04:26] I'll give it to you I'll give you a
[1:04:28] heart's desire that's right
[1:04:32] mine because if you really wanted to it
[1:04:35] then you say on the day of judgment you
[1:04:36] say God we know there's no lying here
[1:04:39] because zero how's your spirits holy I
[1:04:40] wanted to be in the rapture more than
[1:04:42] anything and you wouldn't let me and
[1:04:43] what would God say he's well you're
[1:04:45] right I'm wrong God wouldn't say that to
[1:04:50] see everybody that once wanted to be a
[1:04:53] Noah's Ark would be in Noah's Ark
[1:04:55] everybody that wanted to be out of Sodom
[1:04:57] would be that's why when when mrs. lot
[1:05:00] to hurt she really wanted to be there so
[1:05:02] God smote her right there with salt
[1:05:05] because her heart was she was someone
[1:05:08] was trying to convince her to be in the
[1:05:10] wreck I just say like that just has a
[1:05:11] type so they were trying to convince her
[1:05:13] to escape Sodom and to convince her to
[1:05:16] go in the rapture but it wasn't her own
[1:05:17] desire amen it's got to be your desire
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:22] it can't be my desire you can't live off
[1:05:25] of my desire to serve God you've got to
[1:05:27] have that desire or else you'll turn
[1:05:31] around and say mine I really miss those
[1:05:33] days in the world I don't miss none of
[1:05:37] that amen
[1:05:38] I don't miss anything I'm looking
[1:05:40] forward they have an amen like I said I
[1:05:45] finally feel like I am Who I am I
[1:05:47] finally feel like I can really express
[1:05:49] Who I am a Christian a Christ lover a
[1:05:52] word lover a believer someone who loves
[1:05:55] Jesus Christ with all their hearts amen
[1:05:59] praise the Lord now I hope that's
[1:06:03] helpful by the grace of Lord God will
[1:06:07] give you your heart's desire he promised
[1:06:10] - he said whatever you ask in my name
[1:06:13] I'll give it to you he said ask seek and
[1:06:15] knock and God will open right he'll open
[1:06:17] he'll he'll answer he'll do everything
[1:06:20] he said just ask seek and knock
[1:06:24] but the ramps another church the whole
[1:06:27] thing is the revelation of God to take
[1:06:29] Eve 2nd Eve back to her rightful
[1:06:31] position again with her husband notice
[1:06:34] God is the husband of the church in
[1:06:36] Christ I'm sorry in church is his bride
[1:06:40] now I want to read this now it's
[1:06:43] breaking the Peter and and Jesus here I
[1:06:46] want to read this here let me tell me
[1:06:50] let me uh skip onto that here now Peter
[1:06:56] had seen Jesus in flesh brother Ram said
[1:06:59] but he didn't know him by flesh cuz
[1:07:03] Jesus said so flesh and blood didn't
[1:07:06] reveal it to you now listen what brother
[1:07:08] Ram says he said even my own life didn't
[1:07:12] reveal it to you and this proves in bro
[1:07:18] Graham says it later
[1:07:20] there's no preacher that can give you
[1:07:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:07:25] there's no dad there's no mom there's no
[1:07:28] spouse husband or wife
[1:07:30] there's no district presbyter there's no
[1:07:33] message preacher there's no message
[1:07:35] missionary there's no one that can give
[1:07:39] you a revelation of who Christ is other
[1:07:42] than the Holy Spirit program said Peter
[1:07:47] even my own life didn't reveal it to you
[1:07:50] can you imagine that church Peter had
[1:07:53] seen him walk on the water and look like
[1:07:55] a ghost
[1:07:56] Peter had seen him raised up his own
[1:07:59] wife his wife's dying words that had
[1:08:03] that temperature their fever he lays his
[1:08:07] hands she rises right up even that
[1:08:11] couldn't reveal that Jesus was the
[1:08:12] Messiah because the lot of people saw
[1:08:14] miracles and that didn't reveal it it
[1:08:17] had to be given from heaven amen
[1:08:19] hallelujah all right you see that proves
[1:08:23] no and this is where I struggle little
[1:08:25] bit sometimes I tell my wife like how
[1:08:28] come people can't get the revelation
[1:08:29] like you know people that leave the
[1:08:31] church and things like that like what am
[1:08:32] I doing wrong and I've got to remember I
[1:08:34] cannot give it
[1:08:36] no matter I mean it's this don't get me
[1:08:38] wrong it's the sphere like this morning
[1:08:40] it's a spirit teaching on predestination
[1:08:42] but even though the spirit leads me to
[1:08:45] present it the person still has to
[1:08:47] receive it from God Amen they got to be
[1:08:51] in the same spirit that I got that gave
[1:08:54] it to me and then if they get into that
[1:08:56] spirit that spirit will reveal it to the
[1:08:58] end praise God
[1:09:00] so even Jesus his holy life he never he
[1:09:05] never cussed like Peter Wright he never
[1:09:07] did even his own life couldn't reveal
[1:09:10] this to Peter it had to be given by the
[1:09:13] father
[1:09:16] liber have said Peter did not know him
[1:09:18] by the flesh the man walked handled him
[1:09:21] and everything else so I want to make
[1:09:27] sure you see that now this is most
[1:09:30] encouraging here so hope you're
[1:09:32] encouraged revelation does not come by
[1:09:36] physically being with that's why we've
[1:09:38] seen people walk away from every church
[1:09:40] you name it at mystical Church we've
[1:09:42] seen people walk away the man knew
[1:09:44] brother Branham Donny Reagan we've seen
[1:09:46] people walk away from his church evening
[1:09:48] like Tabernacle we've seen people leave
[1:09:50] this church Samuel Browning's church you
[1:09:54] name it I've seen people brother
[1:09:56] Brooks's church people walked away paula
[1:09:58] Fontaine's people walk away from his
[1:09:59] church it doesn't matter who your
[1:10:02] fleshly pastor is because that pastor
[1:10:05] cannot give you revelation it has to
[1:10:07] come from God Almighty amen
[1:10:14] now this is
[1:10:16] to home now see I want to bring it down
[1:10:18] to home now look what brother have says
[1:10:23] next Paul I know he's comparing Peter
[1:10:27] and Paul he says Paul had something
[1:10:30] greater than any of the Apostles did
[1:10:36] program says in present stage of my
[1:10:38] ministry 1962 brother Ram said Paul's
[1:10:41] ministry was greater than all the
[1:10:44] Apostles combined and that scriptural
[1:10:49] because Paul says I labored more
[1:10:51] abundantly than you all but see Church
[1:10:55] look how humble he was with it
[1:10:57] he says but because I persecuted the
[1:11:00] church he said I consider myself to be
[1:11:03] the least of the Saints and that's how
[1:11:05] you know somebody's really humble even
[1:11:07] though their works
[1:11:09] Paul's works out shined all of them he
[1:11:11] left his he left his hometown he left
[1:11:13] everything he traveled on three
[1:11:15] missionary trips was almost sunk in the
[1:11:17] ships five times I think it was her
[1:11:19] three times beaten four times 39 stripes
[1:11:22] and all these things he suffered more
[1:11:24] than all of them he worked more than all
[1:11:26] of them but when it was brought down to
[1:11:28] it he said I'm the least because I used
[1:11:30] to persecute Christians although his
[1:11:35] works were the greatest he considered
[1:11:37] himself the least brother Brahim said
[1:11:43] Paul had something greater than any of
[1:11:44] the Apostles did but man said the
[1:11:47] Apostle said well I've got more left
[1:11:49] revelation than you paw because you know
[1:11:51] I walked with him I went fishing with
[1:11:52] him one day I heard him talk he sat me
[1:11:56] in a boat and actually told me let's go
[1:11:58] here and fish in a place and we get more
[1:11:59] fish and we did see we seen him do
[1:12:01] things now isn't that familiar people
[1:12:08] that went fishing or hunting with
[1:12:10] brother branham claimed to have more
[1:12:12] revelation than you and I now church
[1:12:15] we're not in the revelation battle like
[1:12:17] I don't need I've got more revelation
[1:12:19] than you I gotta warn you that's not
[1:12:21] what we're trying to do but we're
[1:12:23] looking at whose life is manifesting
[1:12:26] Jesus Christ
[1:12:29] chabela have said the Apostles could
[1:12:31] have said well we went fishing with him
[1:12:33] we have more revelation we actually walk
[1:12:35] with him physically but brother bran
[1:12:37] catches the revelation said because Paul
[1:12:40] knew him by the Holy Spirit the pillar
[1:12:42] of fire amen the Holy Spirit met with
[1:12:47] him in Arabia and taught him the Word of
[1:12:49] God amen for all those years personal
[1:12:53] revelation because he learned it from
[1:12:56] the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ because he
[1:12:59] learned it from there he had a greater
[1:13:01] revelation than all of them put together
[1:13:03] amen so it didn't matter if he went
[1:13:09] fishing with Jesus and church let me say
[1:13:10] it like this humbly today it doesn't
[1:13:12] matter that we didn't see brother
[1:13:14] Branham preach because we know the God
[1:13:16] of William Branham amen
[1:13:21] you know there's one brother I really
[1:13:23] appreciate from Albion what's his name
[1:13:25] that 90 year old brother and the first
[1:13:29] time I appreciate I can't remember me he
[1:13:30] was in one of our arms meetings the
[1:13:32] first time I preached that he heard me
[1:13:33] preach at Albion he comes up crying
[1:13:35] after service and I'm like well praise
[1:13:37] the Lord you know and he said he shook
[1:13:41] my head he said brother Jesse I want to
[1:13:42] tell you something I said okay what what
[1:13:44] do you want to tell me and he said he
[1:13:48] said even though I saw brother Brandon
[1:13:49] preach even though I was in brother
[1:13:50] Anna's meetings he said you're greater
[1:13:52] than I am and I said no brother I said
[1:13:54] no he said he said you and your brother
[1:13:58] cam he said you guys are preaching the
[1:13:59] revelation the message he said in
[1:14:01] impurity it's so pure and he said you're
[1:14:04] better
[1:14:05] he said you're greater than I but I said
[1:14:07] no sir I said that's not right I said I
[1:14:09] said we're nobody and he said no I've
[1:14:11] got scripture to prove it because Jesus
[1:14:13] told Thomas and all the saints he said
[1:14:17] blessed are your eyes
[1:14:19] he said because you've seen he said
[1:14:22] Thomas blessed are your eyes because
[1:14:23] you've seen but greater is he who has
[1:14:26] believed and not seen Amen and I thought
[1:14:30] well I tried to downplay by Thayer I
[1:14:33] thought well that's right that's right
[1:14:37] now that was from his
[1:14:39] I didn't try to tell him to say that but
[1:14:41] he saw the message of the hour preached
[1:14:44] in his pure form and said you are
[1:14:48] greater because you believe the message
[1:14:50] without seeing the Prophet amen
[1:14:52] and that's in church that's the reality
[1:14:55] of what we have today we believe the
[1:14:57] message even though we haven't seen the
[1:14:59] Mahdi prophet of God and all of us gifts
[1:15:01] that we can hear it on tape we can watch
[1:15:02] it on the video but see what we need
[1:15:05] though is not to not to rest in that but
[1:15:08] it's the rest in the revelation the Holy
[1:15:10] Spirit is to say God reveal yourself to
[1:15:13] me become a reality to me amen and so
[1:15:21] that's why brother Ram can say this Paul
[1:15:24] was greater than all the eleven apostles
[1:15:27] and of course he was numbered with them
[1:15:29] we know later but man tells us that
[1:15:33] because of our have said here he is he
[1:15:36] manifests himself in the pillar of fire
[1:15:38] and he said he said now we have the same
[1:15:42] thing today the pillar fire expressing
[1:15:44] himself in vindicating himself revealing
[1:15:47] the mystery of God that's been hid since
[1:15:48] the foundation of the world he said Paul
[1:15:51] knew him by revelation and Peter noon by
[1:15:54] revelation so see it comes down to
[1:16:02] revelation it comes down to faith in the
[1:16:08] revealed will of God that's what it
[1:16:11] comes down to because you can sit in
[1:16:14] someone's under someone's ministry and
[1:16:17] that person in their own flesh they
[1:16:19] cannot give you a revelation they can
[1:16:22] preach it they can point to it they can
[1:16:24] pray for it it's until that heart opens
[1:16:27] up and receives the revelation because
[1:16:31] God wants to give it but the people have
[1:16:34] to receive it alright now let me close
[1:16:38] here I got fit what I got 15 minutes
[1:16:40] here yeah I got 19 minutes okay let me
[1:16:43] close I'm gonna try to bring it down I'm
[1:16:45] gonna close in 20 minutes okay I'm gonna
[1:16:47] try to bring it down because by God's
[1:16:49] grace
[1:16:51] now what I want to do is I want to just
[1:16:53] close with a few thoughts here I kind of
[1:16:57] want look at this Paul and Pete and
[1:16:58] Peter and the revelation here I want to
[1:17:01] remind our hearts of a few things let's
[1:17:04] take our Bibles let's read a few let's
[1:17:05] go to acts 22 here verse 4 now I
[1:17:17] mentioned this this morning church and I
[1:17:18] let me say it again tonight I'm gonna
[1:17:21] say it more clearly tonight we have to
[1:17:23] use our past failures as motivation to
[1:17:28] do more for the kingdom of God because
[1:17:31] that's what Paul did and pause the
[1:17:36] example right Paul says that in first
[1:17:39] Timothy chapter 1 he said God showed his
[1:17:41] grace and me he's a time the pattern God
[1:17:43] showed his grace in me first for all
[1:17:45] those that should follow so even in your
[1:17:49] Christian life you know what sister
[1:17:50] Naomi and I were talking about you know
[1:17:52] after service the grace of God but yet
[1:17:54] sometimes we still fail even in our
[1:17:56] failures this is what I need to do I
[1:17:58] need to look at my failures and use that
[1:18:01] as motivation to say although I failed
[1:18:04] there I'm not gonna fail again I'm gonna
[1:18:06] redeem the time that I'm gonna do better
[1:18:08] next time by the grace of God that's
[1:18:11] what Paul did look at John I'm sorry
[1:18:13] acts 24 for I'm sorry acts 22 for
[1:18:16] forgive me mercy now look he says and I
[1:18:21] persecuted this way into death binding
[1:18:24] and delivering into prisons both men and
[1:18:26] women look at that he persecuted them so
[1:18:28] much what do you mean you believe in
[1:18:30] Jesus the Messiah we're gonna kill you
[1:18:31] we're gonna put you in prison that was
[1:18:33] Paul Paul was persecuting unto death we
[1:18:40] want to kill you you deserve to die
[1:18:42] because you believe in Jesus and it
[1:18:47] wasn't just men Church it was your God
[1:18:49] the old mom or your golly old grandma
[1:18:54] can you imagine it and this is why God
[1:18:58] used him to do great things because he
[1:19:00] realized I'm nothing look what I used to
[1:19:03] be
[1:19:04] I used to consent unto your grandmas and
[1:19:07] grandpas being killed being put to death
[1:19:09] I used to think that was okay
[1:19:12] so Paul God never let Paul get exalted
[1:19:15] although he was used in such a
[1:19:17] tremendous way because Paul could never
[1:19:20] forget I used to persecute Christians go
[1:19:26] to acts 26 verse 11 you know I just
[1:19:30] typed in I persecuted and these these
[1:19:32] four scriptures came up Paul saying I
[1:19:36] persecuted he never forgot what he did
[1:19:41] he never forgot that past life and it
[1:19:43] served as motivation to keep him humble
[1:19:46] but also to do the will of God look he
[1:19:50] said verse 26 11 and I punished them off
[1:19:53] in every synagogue and compelled them to
[1:19:55] blaspheme and being exceedingly mad
[1:19:58] against them I persecuted them unto
[1:20:00] strange cities he would drive you sister
[1:20:03] Wendy from Brian to Toledo he would
[1:20:05] drive you out of Brian sister Naomi he
[1:20:09] would drive your family out of Akron to
[1:20:11] wherever Greene is that what the Bible
[1:20:14] said I did he would he would so bother
[1:20:18] them and get out of here you Christians
[1:20:20] he was just knocking on their doors and
[1:20:22] persecute them until they left and drive
[1:20:25] them to strange cities that's what this
[1:20:28] man did now Church before this we'd say
[1:20:31] oh I'm gonna be like Paul we'd all say
[1:20:33] yeah yeah let me be that great apostle
[1:20:35] who wrote two-thirds of the New
[1:20:36] Testament yeah no no we we don't we
[1:20:44] don't because this is what he did this
[1:20:49] is why God
[1:20:50] could use him this is why he was so
[1:20:51] surrendered to Christ because he was so
[1:20:54] disobedient to Christ at first imagine
[1:20:59] malachi lydia someone come into our door
[1:21:01] and just persecuting us until we have to
[1:21:04] move to Grandma's house he imagine that
[1:21:08] this is what he did and it wasn't once
[1:21:11] in awhile it was oft constant constant
[1:21:16] just the demon spirit driving him he
[1:21:19] just hated message believers he just
[1:21:21] hated it he just hated that and it drove
[1:21:24] him to persecute oh but look at the
[1:21:28] power of Revelation once it's five
[1:21:31] seconds - from the pillar of fire he was
[1:21:33] a changed man amen I didn't any huh all
[1:21:37] these years of persecuted all these
[1:21:39] months we'd say of persecuting
[1:21:40] Christians all the took was five seconds
[1:21:42] in the presence of the Holy Ghost and he
[1:21:44] said Lord what would you have me to do
[1:21:46] praise God it's hard for you to kick
[1:21:49] against those bricks what did it
[1:21:55] revelation of Jesus Christ praise God
[1:22:02] first Corinthians 15 9 Lydia Paul was
[1:22:08] used in the greatest way but in his mind
[1:22:11] he really believed he was the least of
[1:22:14] all the saints because of his past life
[1:22:18] for I am the least of the Apostles and
[1:22:21] that am NOT meet to be called an apostle
[1:22:24] because I persecuted the Church of God
[1:22:29] now he would write letters and say Paul
[1:22:31] an apostle of Jesus Christ but Church
[1:22:33] there was times he was so he felt so
[1:22:36] sorry for his past life he said I'm in a
[1:22:38] pot I'm right he has an apostle but I'm
[1:22:40] really not even worthy to be called one
[1:22:44] because he never forgot what he used to
[1:22:48] do he never forgot what his flesh used
[1:22:51] to do because he persecuted the Church
[1:22:55] of God that's why
[1:22:59] Cam's testimony because he persecuted us
[1:23:01] not with this but with arguments for a
[1:23:04] whole year and then the pillar of fire
[1:23:06] came to him God revealed to him that
[1:23:10] there's one name to the Father Son Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ and now the
[1:23:16] gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[1:23:18] this revelation a mad glory Galatians
[1:23:24] 1:13 Galatians 1 13 for you have heard
[1:23:38] of my conversation times past in the
[1:23:40] Jews religion how that beyond measure I
[1:23:42] persecuted the Church of God and wasted
[1:23:45] it beyond measure so he was the most
[1:23:52] destructive force against Christianity
[1:23:54] and God took the most destructive force
[1:23:57] against Christianity and turned it
[1:24:00] around and put it on God's side and he
[1:24:02] started destroying the kingdoms of
[1:24:03] darkness it's just like David David
[1:24:08] killed Goliath Goliath own sword amen
[1:24:11] hallelujah that big force that God used
[1:24:15] to have God took that tool down that
[1:24:17] sword down and from putting David's hand
[1:24:19] and and killed Goliath with it and
[1:24:21] that's the same thing but Jesus that
[1:24:24] Jesus took Paul the one who's
[1:24:25] persecuting the church took him and slew
[1:24:27] Satan by their Amen hallelujah that's
[1:24:30] exactly right so see Church he
[1:24:34] persecuted the church now go back to 1st
[1:24:37] Corinthians 15:10 first gurney
[1:24:45] 18:10 I'll try to bring this down I got
[1:24:48] 11 minutes I just want to bring this
[1:24:52] thought out about the power of
[1:24:54] Revelation the gates of hell could not
[1:24:59] prevail against Paul after he got the
[1:25:02] revelation of who Jesus Christ was amen
[1:25:06] same thing for Peter of course he didn't
[1:25:08] have Holy Ghost but he almost fell away
[1:25:09] but it got God captain because he had a
[1:25:11] revelation of Jesus God kept him from
[1:25:13] backside and totally out into the world
[1:25:15] and he eventually repented three times
[1:25:18] you know Jesus then he got the Holy
[1:25:19] Ghost 10 days later he meant after Jesus
[1:25:23] left but by the grace of God I am what I
[1:25:27] am and His grace which was bestowed upon
[1:25:29] me was not in vain but I laboured more
[1:25:31] abundantly than they all yet not i but
[1:25:34] the grace of God which was given unto me
[1:25:38] now I preached on this last year at
[1:25:42] Thanksgiving I preached a thought called
[1:25:45] forsaken by man but not by God remember
[1:25:48] that I appreciate I think over in the
[1:25:50] other bill others so would have been
[1:25:51] what two years ago two years ago yeah
[1:25:54] 2016 and brother Branham in the sermon
[1:25:59] President stage of my ministry he showed
[1:26:02] how Paul was forsaken at the end of his
[1:26:04] ministry by Dimas I remember that Dimas
[1:26:08] forsook Paul because he loved the things
[1:26:10] of the world and brother BAM showed how
[1:26:13] Jesus was forsaken at the end of his
[1:26:15] ministry and brother BAM said Paul Jesus
[1:26:18] and brother Branham was forsaken than of
[1:26:20] his ministry he said Paul was
[1:26:24] misunderstood people accused him of
[1:26:26] being a wine-bibber he was telling
[1:26:28] Timothy Timothy to be a wine-bibber they
[1:26:30] misunderstood that then Paul himself was
[1:26:34] in prison and then Paul would not allow
[1:26:36] women preachers so demas forsook Paul
[1:26:41] the one who led him to the Lord because
[1:26:43] he only had one coat where's all the
[1:26:46] prosperity in this man's life but
[1:26:50] brother
[1:26:51] Jesus had no place to lay his head and
[1:26:54] then brother Aaron said Paul had a
[1:26:55] greater ministry than all the other
[1:26:57] apostles because money isn't God no
[1:26:59] matter how big your ministry it's not
[1:27:01] about money it's about the purity of the
[1:27:04] word in acts 19 a silversmith stopped
[1:27:09] what seemed to be a revival in Ephesus
[1:27:12] remember that and they had to take Paul
[1:27:14] out of the city and brother Branham said
[1:27:18] demas must have said something like this
[1:27:20] well Paul Paul made one man blind why
[1:27:24] didn't he make the silversmith blind how
[1:27:29] if Paul such a man of God
[1:27:31] why is he in prison and how come these
[1:27:33] Devils are stopping his revival and
[1:27:35] Ephesus and so Dimas said God must have
[1:27:43] taken his anointing from Paul but
[1:27:45] brother have said God is not an Indian
[1:27:48] giver Amen if God gave you a gift if God
[1:27:52] gave your ministry God will not take
[1:27:55] that away God's not an Indian giver the
[1:27:57] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:27:59] repentance that's exactly right
[1:28:06] Dimas said oh he's all washed up he's
[1:28:09] lost his lost his gift of smite people
[1:28:11] blind but brother ham said see Paul is
[1:28:14] and all men are just an agent of the
[1:28:18] will of God you only work as God leads
[1:28:21] you to work Jesus only did the works
[1:28:23] that God showed him and God's servants
[1:28:26] can only do the work that God calls them
[1:28:28] to do I wonder that too I'm sure sister
[1:28:32] Wendy and Naomi I'm sure we wondered how
[1:28:33] come I can go to other churches and cast
[1:28:35] out Devils and we don't see it here as
[1:28:39] much as we like to maybe maybe it's
[1:28:42] happened I can't remember I couldn't
[1:28:44] remember any but hot why is that or how
[1:28:47] come I look back and we had I remember
[1:28:48] John Graham and I used to count the the
[1:28:50] miracles you know we seem like a lot of
[1:28:52] miracles in 2010 11 12 13 but then it
[1:28:56] seemed like to be a dip or drop off what
[1:29:00] is it you enter in and out of seasons of
[1:29:03] God
[1:29:04] and you we are agents of God and we can
[1:29:08] only do the will of God let me say like
[1:29:12] this I would cast out more Devils that
[1:29:15] people really want to be free from the
[1:29:17] devils is that right we would baptize
[1:29:22] more people in Jesus Christ name if more
[1:29:25] people wanted to be baptized in Jesus
[1:29:27] Christ's name
[1:29:28] are you with me so it's seasons that we
[1:29:32] go through it's not what brother Jesse's
[1:29:33] lost his anointing or I've lost my
[1:29:36] anointing now you may have if you sin
[1:29:37] but I searched my life every day Church
[1:29:39] I know about you
[1:29:40] every morning I fasted Sunday morning as
[1:29:42] some pray I don't need anything I just
[1:29:44] drink water and coffee and pray and see
[1:29:46] God and try to preach God's Word I'm
[1:29:48] trying to say under the anointing of the
[1:29:50] Holy Ghost and I'm ready many times I'll
[1:29:52] announce it on a Sunday I'll say well I
[1:29:54] haven't I haven't eaten if you need to
[1:29:56] be prayed for I can pray for you because
[1:29:58] Jesus said these kind only go out by
[1:30:00] prayer and fasting so see we gotta use
[1:30:07] it and especially me and all of us we
[1:30:09] got to use the wisdom of God we can only
[1:30:11] work as God leads us to work brother
[1:30:18] have said see why is Paul they were they
[1:30:21] were criticizing Paul why is Paul
[1:30:22] warning Timothy of Alexander the
[1:30:24] coppersmith I thought Christians were
[1:30:26] feeling it fearless brother Graham said
[1:30:28] but at the end of his letter Paul's
[1:30:29] warning Timothy be careful with that cop
[1:30:32] Alexander the coppersmith well I thought
[1:30:34] Christians are fearless
[1:30:35] I thought Christian could just speak the
[1:30:37] word speak the word speak the word
[1:30:39] well apparently Church their seasons we
[1:30:41] do speak the word and their seasons we
[1:30:43] don't because you and I know this we
[1:30:47] cannot speak the word though if we try
[1:30:49] to speak the word it's not God's will
[1:30:51] nothing's gonna happen but when we speak
[1:30:55] the way is God's will something's going
[1:30:57] to happen hey hallelujah and we don't
[1:31:01] want to play Church and I gotta be I've
[1:31:02] always got to be careful that when
[1:31:04] people ask me to pray I got to search my
[1:31:06] heart and say Lord is this the anointing
[1:31:08] and you know and usually if I'm like
[1:31:10] like that it's probably not the
[1:31:12] anointing it's me trying to work myself
[1:31:14] up into it but I noticed when I've
[1:31:15] spoken the word like with Tom Atkins and
[1:31:17] these women
[1:31:18] they're babies when I've spoken like
[1:31:20] that it just came out
[1:31:21] I was just anointed and I just did it I
[1:31:24] didn't even think about it it was just a
[1:31:25] leadership of the Lord and that's what I
[1:31:27] like I like to be led of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:29] don't you acts 19 Lydia keep hold it up
[1:31:39] here verse 15 and 16 I got about five
[1:31:50] minutes the power of Revelation Paul
[1:31:56] never lost his revelation Church what
[1:31:59] God was God was making him be rejected
[1:32:02] at the end of his ministry for this sake
[1:32:05] I'm sorry I've said the wrong one that's
[1:32:07] not the right one it's acts 9 I'm sorry
[1:32:10] 9:15 my fault honey my fault acts 9:15
[1:32:14] not 19 I'm sorry mercy
[1:32:17] in order for Paul to be like Christ the
[1:32:23] Lord sent him go that way he's a chosen
[1:32:25] vessel unto me to bear my name before
[1:32:26] the Gentiles the king is Jordan Israel
[1:32:28] now that sounds good doesn't it Church
[1:32:29] but look at the next verse 16 for I will
[1:32:34] show him how great things he must suffer
[1:32:37] that's the part we don't like we want to
[1:32:42] see we want to see the miracles like
[1:32:44] Paul saw you wouldn't have somebody late
[1:32:47] you know a handkerchief and go lay it on
[1:32:49] while I'm preaching I'll wear a
[1:32:50] handkerchief I'll give it to you and see
[1:32:52] somebody heal we want to see that but we
[1:32:54] don't we don't often think about this
[1:32:56] the other side that comes with it there
[1:33:00] are times of glory and great anointing
[1:33:02] but in order to reign huh me know you
[1:33:05] have to suffer in order to reign to be
[1:33:10] like Christ you have to learn how to
[1:33:11] suffer as a Christian brother
[1:33:18] the scripture in Christ and Mister of
[1:33:19] God revealed God's that I've chosen him
[1:33:22] yeah and I'm going to show him what
[1:33:23] great things he'll suffer for my name's
[1:33:25] sake I'll send to the Gentiles and
[1:33:27] disgrace him in every way that he can be
[1:33:30] disgraced but yet he'll bear my name so
[1:33:36] long remember Church ha ha me know Paul
[1:33:39] had the greatest revelation of the New
[1:33:41] Testament he was caught up in the third
[1:33:43] heaven he said I saw things I'm not even
[1:33:45] allowed to utter he said because God
[1:33:48] showed me these great revelations he
[1:33:50] allowed a messenger to buff at me from
[1:33:53] Satan a thorn in my flesh he had the
[1:33:57] greatest revelation he worked harder
[1:33:59] than any other parcels but yet he
[1:34:00] suffered more than all the apostles so
[1:34:07] did you catch the understanding the more
[1:34:09] revelation you have the more suffering
[1:34:11] you have to balance that out because
[1:34:15] search we can't live on the mountaintop
[1:34:17] can we because then we get exalted we
[1:34:20] think we're better than everybody so
[1:34:21] God's got a humble us the more
[1:34:24] revelation we have the more suffering to
[1:34:27] keep us balanced in the Word of God so
[1:34:31] see we have a great revelation to today
[1:34:33] don't we this revelation goes beyond the
[1:34:35] CMA it goes beyond the Assemblies of God
[1:34:39] that I was right I've heard things of
[1:34:41] this message I never dreamed of right
[1:34:44] brother
[1:34:45] but to do that God in order to keep us
[1:34:48] humble he's got to raise the suffering a
[1:34:50] little bit too so we don't get exalted
[1:34:54] and yet in the midst of the suffering we
[1:34:58] never quit we never give up on God the
[1:35:01] gates of hell never overcome us
[1:35:04] hallelujah we never go back in the
[1:35:07] things of the world we don't go crawling
[1:35:08] back to our cigarettes and drugs and
[1:35:10] alcohol and sexual promiscuity and all
[1:35:13] these things like that we never go
[1:35:14] crawling back there we say faithful and
[1:35:16] loyal to God because we know God has
[1:35:20] called us to suffer for his name's sake
[1:35:24] let's stand to our feet here mat Lydia
[1:35:30] the livestream I want to say a few
[1:35:31] personal things here tonight
