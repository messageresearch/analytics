the rock of Jesus Christ let's take our Bibles tonight I'd like to preach out in Revelation chapter 5 again this will be part 2 last week was part 1 just like to look at that thought so let's go to Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 the prophet called this the diamond hitch between the church ages and the seven seals the diamond hitch and I had to look that up what is a diamond hitch it's a tie it's something you when you're riding a horse it's something likes like a knot you do with the rope and it ties your saddlebag on to your saddle or something like that that's at least what Wikipedia said so chapter 5 is the diamond hitch or the tie between the church ages and the seven seals amen so interesting thought there Revelation chapter 5 please verse 1 I have to read verse one and then we'll skip down to verse nine I'll read verse one and then we can all read verse nine together verse 1 oh just be me and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals let's read verse nine if we can on three one two three and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation amen praise God let's have a word of Prayer let's just bow our heads unto our Lord here tonight father in heaven we thank you Lord for your mercy we thank you for your grace truly you have brought us out of the miry clay Lord you said in Ezekiel 16 that you found Israel lying in her own blood but then you pulled her out washed her off cleaned her up put on bracelets put on diamonds put a ring on her finger and she became your beautiful bride Lord if you do that visits more you did with the rod Lord who's not been blinded who would not reject the gospel would not reject the holy ghost' covenant but Lord your Bible says Lord that she's made herself ready she's washed in the blood of God's own son thank you Lord for these promises thank you Lord for making our robes pure and white like fine clean linen dear God thank you for what you've done for us Oh God help us that's happened to that thought tonight of this great Redeemer Lord God that we might be more thankful that we might rejoice and knowing what you've done here tonight Oh God we love you bless every heart and soul that pressed our way out to the house of God may you give them the bread of life tonight and father speak to us we pray O God in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen god bless you me Nancy the praise the Lord so we like to look nation chapter 5 here part 2 and you know remember last week when I was preaching on Revelation chapter 1 and remember how is preaching on Abba Father last week does anyone remember that well I got an email the next morning so last Thursday morning and this brother said oh praise the Lord he was live streaming us from down and I think it was Georgia or Alabama I'm not sure and he said praise the Lord he said you preach exactly what I heard or what I needed he said I thought I was past mercy and I and I thought I could not be forgiven he said for all that I've done in the past he was in jail and all the years telling me all this testimony you know things I pry shouldn't I should stop repeating it there but thank God he said I thought I was past forgiveness he said but then when you started preaching on how the Holy Spirit makes us groan for our Father he said he connected with that and he said that's why I groan for God is because I'm a part of God amen I was so fake I was wondering why I was preaching this because you know everybody seem kind of quiet during that time maybe I was quiet too but God knew that person that little old soul down there just you there's a groaning within us and we cry father we cry Abba we cry daddy we need you we love you and we're groaning to be like him how many groaning to be like Jesus tonight Eamon I just thought I'd share that little testimony there that meant a lot to me when I was wondering well I know brother branham preach it the church probably knows all about it they probably heard it before but I just feel led to preach this it's nice to get confirmation on the other end praise the Lord amen so let's look at Revelation chapter 5 and I just put that five on there because I can see it better on my iPad because it's not this big on my iPad but just so you know it's just chapter five so part two this of Revelation chapter five this is part 80 of the revelation series by God's grace now just remember in verse 1 the Bible said in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals now we spent last week a big portion of last week going through the importance of a seal the Spirit of God crying Abba Father and then we looked at the confusion about this word backside so some people looked at that backside and I said oh there must be something on the backside that's not in the Bible and people have gone off on tangents on that on little doctrines here and there and whenever they do that with every false doctrine it always ends up in sin because it's the wrong seat of false doctrine is a wrong seat it's a demonic spirit it's a demonic influence and that seat if it keeps watered if they stay in that false doctrine it has to produce fruit corrupt fruit and that corrupt fruit produces death amen and so they've gone the wrong side to that but we've seen that we saw a showed you the quotes how brother Branham he said men would walk up to brother Branham and they'd say brother BAM there's God's gonna give us some revelation that's not even in the Bible and it'll give us a stronger faith to go in the rapture brother Branham said that's impossible because the Bible said we do not add one word or take one word away from the Bible and my man said the thing is we've just overlooked what's already written and so we need to look again at the Bible how many looking at the Bible tonight let me let me look at the Bible all week praise God you read a chapters every day hope you're reading more chapter amen as time goes on but that's what we looked at last week and we saw how this book was a seven sealed book and we showed the revelation that we showed how each seal has three parts to it it has a symbol form a reality form and a revelation form we looked at that last week and we showed how the seventh seal we we know all the seventh seal the seventh seal has been revealed to us we know what it is it's the day in the hour of the coming of Jesus Christ but it hasn't been open yet or it hasn't come to the reality form because we're still waiting for the rapture amen and we'll keep waiting will you wait patiently Church are you willing to wait patient come in your life will you still serve in the rest of your life or we get tired and maybe you know fall back in the world we know we won't do that if we've been sealed because we're sealed to the day of our redemption and the day of redemption is either when we get in the rapture or when we go to the grave and the angels of pack our souls to the next dimension praise God the sixth dimension amen that's our Redemption praise the Lord when we get to our theophany or we get swallowed up in life with the glorified body at the rapture amen now I want to look at this thought here tonight so I'm done reviewing let's look at this thought brother man over and over if you look it up in the message from 1961 on he keeps using this phrase the book of Redemption the book of Redemption the book of Redemption and so today I spent yesterday I spent most of my time looking at Revelation chapter 5 from 61 and the breach today I spent a lot of time on the breach from 1963 it's the Sunday night sermon before he preached the first seal so in verse 9 they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation now I just want to read verse 10 I don't have it here as I was listening I forgot to write this thought down but look at verse 10 everybody everybody got your Bible verse 10 and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth so the Bible says that all these when they see Jesus they're saying ma you've redeemed us by your blood we're out of every nation we're out of every tongue and and every kindred you you've redeemed us out of all these nations and then they say you redeemed us so much that you've made us kings and priests and we we will rule on the earth honey no that's the reward for the real overcomer I think it was in the Sardis Church age where God told that God Jesus said if you overcome you'll rule over the nation's hey man so the overcomer of every age will give it will be given dominion over a nation on the earth during the millennium and perhaps also during the future home we'll see about that but I know for sure during the Millennium now the reason I say maybe not future home is because mother man talks about how the bride will never leave his side and so if Jesus is in the future home I imagine we would just stay in the future home with him because the bride would be ever at his side that's what I would imagine but I could be wrong but I want to bring this point out in from verse 10 he's made us kings of priests and we shall reign on the earth so they're saying here we are in heaven we see Jesus he's the Redeemer this is a book of redemption and so after all this is over Jesus is going to make us or rain on the earth he's going to let us rain on the earth and brother and brother ham says the Bible says right now right now we do not rain on the earth unless you want to try to go down to the the local government in Akron and you want to try to take over you can try to do that if you want but I imagine they'll call the cops within about 10 minutes of you saying I'm a king of this country I'm a priest of this country I imagine they might call you crazy but you see you and I are not raining now naturally that natural run train will come later praise God but I stand here I believe tonight has the redeemed of son of God and I believe that I'm ruling now I'm ruling over a territory now and it's this territory of my body this this corporal body this is the territory I'm ruling over now I'm a king over this body and I'm ruling over the sin that tries to live in this body and tempt me amen in this body amen and if I can rule over this this this clay if I can rule over this dirt this calcium and potash in a trump if I can rule over this now Jesus will trust me to rule over all the other clay amen during the Millennium amen but I first got to prove to the devil that I'm a king and priests right now and I'm happy to do that by His grace by the grace of God amen now I want to read a few quotes here I have some quotes out here I want you to catch what's happening in Chapter five now it can be a little confusing so towards the middle of the the sermon here I've got some notes about why this chapter can be confusing I'll be very honest it was confusing to me for many years and there's still some things I don't really understand but I want to bring out everything that I can clearly teach from the Word of God and from the thus saith the Lord's brother Adam said I want to teach those clearly by God's grace now Barrera says now we see that something was lost here because the Bible said so in the book here that has redeemed us what are we redeemed from something must have been lost because remember in verse 9 they say you've redeemed us so brother man says if we were redeemed we must have lost something are you with me so far we need redeemed because we had something lost from us or something was taken from us and so Jesus had to redeem and bring us back and this redeem means here to the whole creation the whole creation of mankind the whole creation of mankind needed redeemed praise the Lord something must have been lost before you can be redeemed there must be something that redeemed us back and all the inheritance that we had has been redeemed back then we must have something one time that we do not have now but this Lamb come to redeem see we had something we was lost from now notice what did we lose now brother man tells us what we lost he said it was given to him to have eternal life how many know he started off with eternal life he had an anointing on him of eternal life and purity and complete since by the Holy Spirit he had an anointing but it was temporary so it wasn't down in the soul but it was a temporary anointing it must have been on his flesh and on his mind because if it was in the soul brother you're sealed to the day of your redemption in this soul so you can't lose that seal in your soul are you with me so see that's why I got into a New Testament because he wouldn't write the Holy Ghost seal in your soul praise God and the Old Testament wasn't upon the soul it was just an anointing on the flesh and the mind but now in the New Testament we get a seal we get a permanent brand we get a permanent mark and Christ is sealed in and the devil sealed out hey man but see Adam had eternal life and as long as he ate from the tree of life which member it was not a literal tree he could go there and eat off the fruit it was the presence of God it was Jesus Christ's spirit that was the tree of life in the garden amen because if you do that if you make it a literal tree of life now then now you have two ways to eternal life you have the Holy Ghost and you have a natural tree and there's not two ways to turn alive there's only one way I did Jesus say I am one of the ways he said I am the way and that's why the the normal idea of the tree of knowledge he will be an apple tree that's why that's a bunch of nonsense because if you do that now you've got two ways to turn alive right you've got a natural out got an apple tree or our Tree of Life fruit or a banana or orange or apricot whatever you want to make it now you've got two ways to turn alive but we know that's not the truth we know there's only one way and God has given us that way and as long as Adam obeyed the Holy Spirit he had this anointing on him the same is true for us today as long as we obey the Word of God the anointing rests on us amen and even when we sin we don't lose the anointing in our soul and the church said if you're seeing with the Holy Ghost then the Bible said God dwells in you it's Christ in you and then no matter what you do up here no matter what you do out here you'll still God's anointing in your soul but yes if you sin and it you'll feel checked in here this guy will tell you that little dove will say you sinned you sin that will leave you in your soul it may leave your flesh and may leave your spirit but it cannot leave your soul because it's a seal unto the day of your Redemption just want to make that clear now Adam here he had eternal life and notice that he inherit the earth he was like an amateur God over the earth the earth who says everything was given under his hand he could do it ever he wanted to he named it and called it and done whatever he wanted he was truly a son of God so there's two things Adam lost well they may go together so it may be just one thing I just listed them separately so it could be just two I had him lost the anointing and Dominion but it could be one in the same maybe obviously the the Dominion went along with the anointing I just listed it so you knew okay because the Bible we'll get to the bible scriptures in just a moment now in the fall adam forfeit the title deed to that he fell free to Satan Satan took the title deed Adam was very slothful now look at this Adam was very slothful and he did not redeem his rights for he could not redeem his rights now that's interesting because you always wondered well what happened how did he get seduced by the serpent and where was Adam well it's interesting when Adam said Adam was very slothful so I don't know what I don't know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna inject something all I know is that in Matthew 13 Jesus said while men slept the enemy came and planted the tares amongst the wheat so perhaps Adam was sleeping or perhaps Adam was you know just napping I don't know I'm just saying brother BAM calls him slothful so at some point he was not keeping his post of duty like he ought to but Satan which does not rightfully own it but he possesses that he is the god of this earth the Bible said so not because he rightfully gets it but he possesses it now to get it Satan possesses that he holds it in his hand death is in his hand the earth is in his hand the world belongs to him every nation belongs to him he governs and controls that's Dominion the whole world and everything in the world Satan does now here's what the word Dominion means it means rule or domination so God said have dominion over the fish of the scene over all the air and every other living thing that moveth upon the earth so Adam was given Dominion or rule or domination now here's a scripture I don't know if you ever caught this but this ties in with the law of the kinsman redeemer while they promise them Liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption four of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage now did you catch this Adam forfeited dominion over the earth and then because he forfeit it he was then in bondage to the sin nature and who was in charge of the sin nature the devil who is the father of lies the devil so when Adam was overcome by his own slothfulness he became a slave to the devil or the devil sin nature are you with me so that is a beautiful scripture there no passing notes okay okay thank you yeah if you guys yeah please no capacity notes okay gentlemen thank you and now look at this here the Bible tells us Adam now here's Adam right after he was slothful and the Bible said unto Adam he said because thou has hearken unto the voice of thy wife so here's here's how he is slothful in at least in one way there could have been others like I said he may have been sleeping I don't know but here's at least one way now is hearken unto the voice of that wife and has eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life amen so what was one of Adams slothful acts he listened to his wife instead of the Word of God now that's the that's the that's the part of it that we see in the Bible the the sin part but often were we need to remember that Adam knew what he was doing Adam chose to take on Eve's sin because he loved her amen and that's the part you got to read between the lines - church amen the Bible said in verse Timothy - that knew what he was doing Adam was not deceived so this is what he did he listened to the voice of his wife above God because he thought well God's greater than I God can save my wife and God can save me God is so great and in doing that he became just like Jesus Christ amen he was a pre figure of Jesus Christ because Adam took on the sin it is it one took on the sin of his guilty wife that's what Jesus did although all of our curse was placed upon Christ amen and so the ground was cursed because of what Adam did we know that now here's the bond in Scripture the Bible said because there's the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the churn of God how many feel that bondage of corruption you're there's just something they're just sending your members how many hate that bondage I hate it there I hate it and only the head but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it that is - it means that is that is waiting for the fourth of the adoption we cover that last week the redemption of our body amen so we are slaves we're slaves to corruption if time goes on we're all going to have a funeral right because we're under the bondage of corruption but there's something within us groaning for perfection waiting for a perfect body we know there's a perfect body there's something inside you that wants to control nature there's something inside you that wants to correct everything that's wrong there's something inside of you that wants the real and have dominion over this world what is it it's the Spirit of God it's that that real body that you have waiting it's that redemptive body it's the same thing that Adam had and Adam lost it for all of us but Jesus gives it back to us amen all glory there's something about me every time something bad happens I just want to be like a creator and break in there and destroy it and fix it how many feel that way every time somebody gets sick I did it every time I see a person in wheelchair I just want to go lay hands on them and raise them up don't you I just hate this bondage of corruption you just want to see everything back and in perfect order the way it should be that's because there's a part of inside of side of you something groaning inside of you if the Spirit of God waiting for everything to be back in order like it was for Adam oh yes Amen now here's the scripture better be included but if our gospel be hid remember we looked at that I went on Sunday night how the Bible said only Jesus friends will understand the mysteries of God only as friends if you're not a friend of Jesus you won't understand the mysteries of the New Testament and so here it is if our gospel be hid so if people do not understand those 12 mysteries it is hid to them that are lost it's because they're lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them oh I'm glad Jesus asked me to be his friend hey I'm glad I can understand the secrets of God the mysteries of God and not just understand them but I can actually apply them to my life and I can be born again because member you can understand all the mysteries and still not be born again well that's right but see many of the mystery most people have the mysteries hint to them they don't understand water baptism they don't understand the Godhead they don't understand the laughter they don't understand all of the seven stars the seven church age is the statue Birdman they don't understand these mysteries and that's because Satan has blinded them from the glorious gospel because he's given them the lust of the flesh the pride of life and the lust of the eyes and because they love that more than they love God that's right but thank God brother have said we're not in the world see there you are now look I don't mean the church Satan don't control the church he just controls the world oh saint doesn't control me tonight he wants to because of that bondage of corruption but what happens whenever that comes up and whenever it disagrees with the Word of God this word of God inside of me that's dumb inside of me it brings this body in the in the subjection of the word this spirit inside of me this life inside of me makes my body obey the Word of God you don't think there are times I don't want to go smoke a cigarette now my flesh you don't think there's times I don't want to go have a drink it and take off the pressure am I the only one I'm talking about my flesh my flesh will smell cigarettes and it likes it and I've got to say no and it's and the power of God has anchored me away from that for the last 17 years amen but it doesn't mean that my flesh my flesh is still slave to that it's drawn to that it wants to go by that but the the life inside of me it cruises crucifies that that a desire again and again and it has to be and it crucified it yesterday it crucified it today and it's gonna have to crucify tomorrow amen jesus said you cannot be my disciple unless you take up your cross daily and follow me that means every day you've got to crucify the lust of the flesh hey man you don't think there's times my eyes get all googly I like oh I like to have that new house or oh ma I like to get a new car you don't think my eyes get like that you don't think so we're all human we've all got to overcome this so what see Satan cannot control us because we are choosing to be controlled by Jesus amen hallelujah Debra his he Satan's a godless world jesus said he was he's the God of heaven and now you rightly don't own this he does not own him he fought for Adam for the title deed to it but all this stuff that we own eternal life and inherited of the earth and Jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth now we don't have it now to see we don't have the earth now but if we are meek which means we we are so meek we put ourselves always below Jesus Christ that's what meekness is humility it's putting all your needs below Christ desires if you do that then you'll inherit the earth I don't even care what part of Earth I in here I don't care if I'm a ruler over Akron I don't care if it's Mozambique I don't I don't care if it's Canada I don't know I'm not sure what's in Canada or Greenland there's not much in Greenland I don't care of us Greenland but one thing I would I want to be meek I want to be like Christ I on him to have his way me praise God he's my Creator he has a plan he has a destiny for me he has a assignment for me to do and I want to submit to that I don't when they rebelled against that I want to obey his calling for my life and if he do if I do it reward me as a ruler and overcomer and he'll give me that dominion back that Adam lost and then I can be a true son of God a fall son of God with the full adoption of Jesus Christ hey man nah but we don't have it now oh but we will have it later by God's grace if we can just be meek if we can just control this body now during this lifetime if we can control this earth he'll make us ruler over this earth but man said Satan possesses it but he does not rightfully own it when the rightful owner lost it there's only one way it can be redeemed that's by near kinsman is the only one who can rightfully redeem it now of course we have this in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ so notice Satan possesses Dominion but it actually belongs to God Jesus Christ redeemed back this Dominion with his blood and we are enjoying a portion of that inheritance today are we not right like brother Ram would speak to the storm I could leave I never spoke to something and it happened right how many ever laid their hands on the sick and they recovered I never spoke in tongues or interpreter prophesy what you have is you have a portion of that that Dominion coming back but we're good we're promised the fullness as well amen glory now Bob Arum said I want to say something here and he goes to the Levitical loss of redemption I'm gonna skip right to it because of times sake I'm really not getting as far as I wanted to get tonight I'd like to you know further now I said the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine see your property is really not yours yeah for your strangers and sojourners with me God says and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land so every land must be have this ability to be redeemed if thy brother be waxed and poor and I sold away some of this possession if any of us can come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which is brother's soul so let's say I had some land I sold some of it because I was getting down in the dumps I had some bad financial seasons my son Malachi could come back and buy that land because he's near kinsman my brother if it wasn't Malachi my brother Simon could come by and buy that land because he's kinsman to me and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it they let him count the years of the sale they're up and restored the over plus under the man to whom he sold it that he may return it under special so I could go back and I could go back and I could well I sold you that land but the law says I can buy back from you so I have to pay you the overplus or whatever was above and beyond from those years that you had it I have to pay that back to you but I can buy it back because it's actually mine God said so but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which his soul shall remain in the hand of him that have bought it until the year of Jubilee and the Jubilee it should go out and he shall return on his possession so if I can't buy it until the year of Jubilee then he that that man that I sold to will keep it until the year of Jubilee and the year of Jubilee he'd have to walk over there and say okay that's mine it's been 49 years but now it's mine I want it back and he had to give it back because God gave me that land that was my promise inheritance and God wants all children to have their inheritance amen first there's something God wants you to do on this earth there's some some job you're supposed to do some special assignment some position God wants you to rule over on this earth God has an inheritance and it's foreshadowed of course he has inherited to the future home but it's foreshadowed now we must look at our lives and see what does God want me to rule over help me to rule over all that God has given me it might be a father might be a mother it might be a farmer might be a doctor might be a pastor about whatever they're God's called you to be whatever whatever job he's called you to do you must rule over that now and it's your inheritance it'll bless you for that amen he will burn I've said Oh hallelujah hmm I hope you Christians see it I hope you saw it while we read that he said we are the saw the earth God gave this to his sons he gave us the jurisdiction over all nature all animals all life everywhere but Adam our Father forfeited to Satan but where does it fall back to the rightful owner God who made it hey man so see we read all that to show we read it out of the laviticus 25 to show that that's a natural a type of the spiritual amen that God is going to give us back all those spiritual rights and Dominion that Adam had God's going to give it back to the bride amen and of course all the saints of the Old Testament okay now I think we can go to verse 2 now revelation 5 verse 2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth nor under this earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open read the book neither to look thereon and we'll stop right there here's a brother who says about these verses okay I already read that well the man said but John wept here's what I think he went for and now I've switched to the breach all the previous quotes were from Revelation chapter 5 part 2 of 1961 I believe was June 11 that I'm not mistaken he said here's where I think John went for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost here's the book here's the title deed and it will be offered to the kinsman redeemer that can meet the qualifications that's God's own law and he can to follow his law I can't defy his law rather see God required a kinsman redeemer who was worthy who was able to do it who had the substance to do it and the angel said now let that kinsman redeemer step forward and John looked and he looked all over the earth he looked beneath her look at this John looks under the earth dad looks around me if he must have been pulled out he must had some real eagle eyes he can look all around the the sphere of the earth he can look inside the earth anything in there he looked everywhere and there is nobody worthy the creation everything was lost of course John what everything was lost he imagined how sad he was John knew all the Adam had Adam had all the power to control heaven and earth he had all that power and John and John knew if that book doesn't get opened if all the truth in that book of God's title deed there of redemption if that book doesn't get open we're lost we're going to forever remain like this where we're never going to be able to go back and be like Adam so there must have been something in John that was longing to be a ruler there must have been something John that was longing to be a king that was longing to be a priest that was longing to be a ruler how come all the good movies and we've you know and all the good books they're always so popular because they they make the main character become king or queen isn't that the goal of all the books and movies like the children like line which in the wardrobe what's the whole point of that these four children become kings and queens and they get the rule over all of Narnia and and the Christian man wrote that series you know he wrote that series and it was a filled with a lot of good types like the death and burial resurrection of Jesus Christ but what are all these stories about I can't remember some of the worldly movies like The Matrix I don't actually I saw up I don't remember it you know I was a sinner but you know like just any movie they're trying to get somebody to be a ruler somebody to be exalted why is that because it's a reality God is going to bring all of his children back to being miniature atoms on this other thing then they're not going to be full gods but they're going to be amateur gods are going to be just like Adam and they're gonna have creative power and God's gonna be able to trust them with that power hey man how do you and if you want to go create a world to live on it better I'm sayin you killin I imagine we'll all say on the earth because I really I want to be apart from you brothers I really would miss you if you know I know I got eternity but I might miss you you have the power you have all this power but God first has to put godly character in you first so he can trust you with that power so it's not satanic 9si everything was lost so jobs crying he said I will never I'll never get out of this state I'll never get back to me no I want to be like Adam was I want to be in the perfect condition I want to be a ruler I wanna have dominion on the earth and we'll never get back or unless this book gets open ha ha ha and it made him so sad he started crying he wept much the Bible says if you knew you were never going to get all those powers of Adam back would you cry I would because I feel like I was meant for more than this I was meant to be more than just a tired man you know it gets tired and headaches and gets you know I get sore and makes mistakes when I don't want to sister Connie I don't want to make mistakes but sometimes I make mistakes I would cry and weep I'll be so sad if I knew I had to remain like this forever but thank God John cried because he felt that same way he didn't want to remain in this farm condition he wanted to be fully adopted he were the full blessings of God he wouldn't be fully a child of God just like Adam started off oh that's how I feel to church and I cry many thro many times I've cropped assaulter I'm sure you cried in your prayer Clause as well I've cried groaning just wanting to be more like God wanting to be perfect wanting to be like Jesus wanting to see Jesus it'll make every true Christian cry praise God amen and church the longer I live the more I get disappointed in my flesh the more I feel my goodness help me Lord I need to live higher than this I can live higher than this but the body keeps getting more tired all the time Oh help me Jesus so the angel said I want a man that's able to do it I want a man that can redeem and he wasn't found so John broke out Oh everything was lost he wept bitterly he was so sad because everything the whole creation everything was gone if they couldn't find somebody imagine that all the creation would be gone all the animals that you loved all the mountains and all the Seas and all the trees in the forest all that would not be restored back because this book was not open this book had all the promises of God in it amen it'll all the names of the on the Lamb's Book of Life it had all these details it had everything of God's plan and if this doesn't get open if this doesn't get a release it won't happen and so John starts weeping bitterly he said they couldn't find somebody that could meet that requirement that every human being in the whole world in creation was gone so that means Satan would have kept that dominion and and we never would have got it back can you imagine if we had to keep living like this for eternity and Satan was always the god of this earth can you imagine that what an awful world that would be what a horrible awful evil world that would be with the Satan possessing those powers right that Dominion he said Oh everything had fallen the rites of redemption the rites of eternal life Elijah or all these rights have been for for there was nobody who could pay the price to get them back oh my verses five and six and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne who the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now brother Ram said those seven eyes are the seven spirits he said on the seven church age messengers just so you know I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this because I don't think it's really important to spend a lot of time on that because we've already covered it now who knows what the seven horns are brother Bram said it's the Church of each church age so Ephesus the the Holy Ghost anointed Church in Ephesus was like a horn on Jesus's head that's his power that's his weapon who's Jesus gave the keys to Jesus gave the keys to Peter right and now we have the Dominion or we have the power so each of the horns represents the bride in each church age because that was the power of Jesus Christ on the earth do you realize that you're the power of Christ tonight amen I am you are we're believers and we have faith in the Word of God we become the horror we become the power of Christ on the earth today amen how do you know because it's been powerful my life I drove all the demons out of my life hallelujah it drove all the addictions and the lusts and the evil thoughts and all the evil things in my life it drove them out by the power of the horn amen the power of the church in the church members they men the bride members so just so you know he says that in chapter or part 2 of Revelation chapter 5 and 61 now back to the breach his crying didn't last but just a minute though isn't God so merciful you know we you know we we might have to we feel like sometimes we cry or we wait so long but look how merciful God is to John he not the crime very long Jesus just gave a little bit of drama not too much drama you don't feel like that God will give you just a little bit of drama just enough trials to make you look up to heaven The Crying did it last but a minute though and troubles don't last always out of that song troubles don't last always all right they'll come and go right he says but someone said don't weep John his crying it lasts a minute John thought oh my where's the man brother branham said look he said there stands the prophets remember he could see all around the earth he could look in heaven oh there's Abraham there's joke he said there stands the prophets there was born like I was there stands the sages there's a Zeki oh there's Enoch which one's going to prevail it was none of those guys hey and it wasn't the Virgin Mary either or Joseph hey then he said so many vermin who prevailed oh he's ain't there nobody here that can prevail and get that church often failed Elijah took a rapture Moses got raptured went to the grave we got raptured Enoch took a rapture and none of them were worthy so see just in the rapture doesn't make us worthy it doesn't make us somebody Jesus is the only somebody praise God very men in fact where they said he taught he was no different than anybody else he was just called to the rapture and that's like you and I we still sit and fall short and there's nothing really special about us other than God has chosen us and we are just called to go in the rapture amen we must not worship the broad we must not worship ourselves all worship must go to Jesus Christ hey man a little later in the sermon you're gonna say brother that bromances is my name on that book and brother have said I hope so he doesn't brag like all my name's on there oh you better get your name on there because look at me I'm the prof of the hour he was never arrogant like that and God help us not to be arrogant like that help us to be humble so they all stood there in John's cycle which one is it one if it's going to be one of these guys and they're capable as for one of the elder standing in the midst of the four B's don't weep John oh my the grace of God don't be brokenhearted John don't weep for the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Rudolph's spring of David has prevailed and Berlin said prevail means to wrestle with and overcome so when did Jesus prevail grogram said in the Garden of Gethsemane uh the prevailing didn't take place in heaven the prevailing took place on earth and he had to prevail over his flesh that didn't want to do the win of God and he prevailed in prayer church amen god help us to understand how important is that you go to your prayer closet and pray when you go through trials because that's where you actually overcome amen Jesus didn't have a clause in the in the Garden of Gethsemane so he went off and prayed by himself and made his own spiritual closet and God rewarded him openly if you go in the closet God will reward you openly and the church said let's not be remembered brother have said the angel told him the technician the technician was going into the closet and praying and then all these sick people came out well see prayer changes you and you come out like a new Christian hey man that's exactly right the said don't you know the scripture and my man says see the angels always scriptural the little tent represents the prayer closet going and pray and you'll find healing by Jesus Christ to see when his blood dropped from his face he was overcoming still where to this lie and where this line overcome he overcome in prayer hallelujah now back to Revelation chapter 5 part 1 just then he said the elder came forth our strong angel we'd not he said he's conquered in other words he's worthy to take the book remember he hadn't seen him up to this time remember John looked in inside the earth he looked on top of the earth he looked up in heaven and he still hadn't seen Jesus he said no man is worthy he's looking he said seeing Jesus and all of a sudden the voice says hey there's the Lion of the tribe of Judah he's revealed and why sitting there see done I said why he was sitting there seated on a throne there in God's throne so for some reason he could see in heaven but he couldn't see the throne of God he was on the inside of the sanctuary he hadn't seen him too this time so John was expecting to see a lion but he saw a lamb the boy said a lion he turned to look and expect to see this ferocious creature and he sees a meek little lamb oh I hope that's how you are I hope there's a part of you that's bold and fierce and strong like I love it but I open people see you they see you as humble as a little lamb amen that God called me a line but I hope all of you see me as a humble little lamb and that's Scripture because the Bible says were like lambs delivered to the slaughter all the day long and the church said so in God's eyes we should be strong spiritually prayed up like lions but when someone offends us were like a little lamb I know you didn't mean that right oh I forgive you brother or forgive me sister I didn't mean to say that against you we should be so humble like the land and the reason I'm saying that is because that's what brother Graham says next look what he says he said here comes a land look a brother says there you are brothers so that's all of us through meekness through sweetness through the Holy Spirit that we conquer he look to see a line a mighty conquer and he sees a lamb how do we conquer the devil through the sweetness of the Holy Spirit oh Jesus I love you Oh forgive me Lord I didn't mean it or forgive me brother sister help me to hunt lord help me to humble myself I'm just gonna obey the Word of God now you're overcoming instead of splitting the church and getting upset and cursing your brother and sister and saying they're just a Surrency they're just a devil that's a wolf spirit not a lamb spirit hello Church how did Jesus overcome me that's like it he said he's alive he looked at him and he's a slain lamb like a slain lamb like he just got freshly cut he's bloody and bleeding where is this mighty conker he's a bloody bleeding lamb bloody brother Ram said like he just got slain and brother Brahim said that's a lesson for us not some great mighty intellectual giant but he that can humble himself the intellectual Giants inherit the earth is that what Jesus said he said the meek inherit the earth is the man who conquers the man who can be kicked around and still be a servant of Christ well I'm leaving this church because this is sister so-and-so brother to treat mistreated me I won't be kicked around like this and brother branham said no the real sermon is the one who gets kicked around like a humble little lamb in that something doesn't that go against our thinking church didn't David it's better to be the doorkeeper and be in the house of God than being the tents of the wicked I would rather just keep the door alright Saints come on I remember when I first became a deacon over in Lima I was so thrilled brother William people just walk in the door I could open the door say come on in god bless you I was happy as a lark I just loved open the door now I miss I missed here in the preaching because I had to open the door for the kids using the bathroom you know the adults and the moms nursing I kind of missed the certain the preaching but I thought well at the beginning I loved it I just wanted to be serving God's people who else would I want to be around other than the Holy Ghost field sinks and David said that rather be a doormat or I'd rather be a doorkeeper and be in the house of god than to dwell with the wicked sinners well fine I'm leaving the church and I ain't even coming back to church you need to get born again because the born to get lamb doesn't mind getting kicked around a little bit it kicked it around a bit well they're just kicking me around today oh they just kicked me around last Sunday that's okay as long as I'm in the house of God that's all that matters Jesus had to be kicked around by his own disciples he drove him since he got kicked around and he said get behind me Satan right he's got to get kicked around oh don't you believe don't you know what the unleavened bread that means it's not bread it's me or the leavened bread it's the doctrine of the Pharisees don't you understand that they said master don't you know who touched you all these people out there don't you know who touched you sometimes you got to get kicked around Church sometimes you got to take the wrong sometimes people got to mistreat you and if you stay and humble yourself and just be a sweet Christian you just overcame but the world wants are they gonna find out go I'll take my membership else well well if you're believing in membership then you need to join a denomination we're not members of a church we're born in the church God don't have spiritual grandchildren children and if you're in the place where you need to be there's no other place you'll fit in is other than the place where God meant you to be praise God it's a man who can kicked around and still be a servant of Christ that's the conquer now he's prevailed he's worthy to take the book and open it and loose the seals thereof so what's programs lesson he looks to see a lion he sees the lamb what's real Rams lesson we got to be humble if we're gonna conquer the devil be strong like a lion would be humble like a lamb be sweet like a lamb may God help us to be like that how many want to be sweet like a lamb sweet that means you don't get bitter you don't have roots of bitterness build up in you boy if I had Jose add them I put him between a rock and a hard place and I'd squeeze and I take brother William I think Malik God I'd squeeze him like this you know that's how some people think brother William you probably seen it in churches homes that you probably seen in churches if I could just give that guy a real little girl if I could just straighten out her mind a little bit that's not very meek that looks like a wolf and not a lamb as we said see we have to see and understand that this is how Christ lived Christ lived like a lamb he could just be beat around most of time there's times we know yeah he took those he took the cords and he whipped him in the in the temple there's time see that but most the time he's getting kicked around so we understand that most of time he was getting kicked around but man said John had it notices lamb before you know here he had he mentioned him before nowhere had it been mentioned John didn't see it all over the heavens is he looking but here come forth where to come from it come from the Father's throne where he'd been seated since he'd been slain and raised again he raised up and sat in the right hand of God ever living to make intercession so program says that he came forth from the throne which was a sanctuary and other courts he says he came from the mediatorial box kinda like the holiest of holies was like a small room like a box like the holy place and the holiest source was like a box but rare so there must have been a box in heaven because John didn't see Jesus right away oh I love this he says every living to make intercession amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercessions upon the ignorance of the people upon my ignorance oh now that's the one I'm depending on he's still covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin are you depending on Christ tonight are you depending on his blood to be bleached to your sins are you depending on that I am to that that's if brother Branham depended on him when he was 55 years old I'll defend him when I'm 37 amen now I'll keep depending on him all the days of my life to be my bleach but RAM said isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place he saw the lamb he proceeded out John had a saw him because he'd been way back into the eternities even making intercession and showing those who had come to God under the offering of blood of bulls and goats a substitutionary offering them who have believed it pointed it to him and the blood and not yet been shed yet so there he was to clear them he was there to clear you and I oh god I hope he's there tonight for every sinner the lamb has been slain oh oh so he brother answered way back in the eternity 'he's see because there's no time in heaven and the church said god keeps track of it down on earth but internally you lose track of time now here's why this chapter can be a little confusing here's a quo some people misunderstand now this quote puts revelation 10-6 in the future like it hasn't happened yet but member brother Bram said in what is a traction on the mountain he said revelation ten one to seven was history and now listen it's not brother branham's fault if people get mixed up and get a false doctrine it's not their fault it's their fault because they're not born again because if you're born again the Holy Ghost leads you into all truth that way program makes a mistake it's okay the Holy Ghost will make you look over that and find the truth well program was just such a Kentuckian he confuses me all the time no you need to lean on the Holy Ghost a little more he may make mistakes he yes he was a Kentuckian he wasn't perfect but if we get confused it's not our fault it's because we need to ask the Holy Spirit for the answer because no man is perfect you can't make brother branham God you can't make me God you can't make any pastor God you've got to make God God amen you've got to lean upon the Holy Ghost to understand the Word of God so here's a quote they misunderstood then it is he the land that takes his kingly position when the saints come to crown him Lord and Lord and King of Kings see time has run out revelation ten six then there's time I'm sure then there's no more time so see this makes it look like it's future when Jesus has already taken his position after the rapture then time is no more so that would place revelation 10 1 to 7 as future after the rapture but brother Graham said it's already history so see people would misunderstand this one here's another one they misunderstand this one makes it seems like when the seals are broken there's no more mercy and this is why we have a lot of false doctrines about this one people say well the seals are Jesus left the mercy seat so there's no more mercy Jesus took the book he opened the seal so there's no more mercy no more people can be saved that's an awful false doctrine so see they misunderstand this but RAM said when the lamb was slain he walked forward from his eternity out of the Father's throne and took his rights it was judgment seat so people will read revelation 5 and they'll say Jesus took the book and they'll take this and say okay well if the books open now it's the judgment-seat no more people can be saved and that's an awful awful false doctor to see they need to pray about that a little longer they misunderstood brother Branham or maybe my brother Brad miss said it or he's had some words the wrong way either way the Holy Ghost won't lead you to make a false doctrine that becomes heresy in the church now here's my opinion revelation 5 took place some time I believe revelation 5 is history - I could be wrong brothers I could be wrong but I believe its history I believe it took place sometime around 1963 since brother Graham said thus saith the Lord that the church ages and the seals are already been preached so if that means that if the if they are thus saith the Lord and the seals have been revealed and the seals have been loosed then to me revelation 5 has already taken place but I could be wrong Church I'm not trying to exalt with look at me I'm so revel a 'td I'll tell you I'll be more Revelator when I'm more humble so were you is that right Church because Paul got so much revelation God had to give him I trouble to humble him and I don't want I trouble I'd rather be humble without that trouble but you know Paul needed that and you know God might God knows we might need it too sometimes he heard program said today he has to make you sick to make you appreciate mean well sometimes this does get sick to Humble us because God has revealed so much to us he wants us to remain humble and not get prideful also I believe this church if revelation 5 took place then I believe this then the lamb after he loose the seals must have went back and sat down after the opening of the seals in order to do more mediatorial work that not just my opinion then at the time of the rapture I'll stand up again and claim all the names in the book of life he will then descend and meet his wife in the air that's just my thought I I could be wrong but if you place that in the future if you place revelation five like it hasn't happened yet what do you got you then the seals aren't open yet and brother Ram Jonah's already in the symbol form the reality form and the revelation form on for them are already fulfilled right and now the fifth sixth and seventh we're still waiting for a few of those forms to be fulfilled does everybody understand if it's confusing program said time and time again and I do the same thing Church if it's confusing I got to go back and listen to it again so this is confusing pray go back and listen this sermon again I may preach it again so you know it may not have to go back and listen to it again alright now let me show you mercy is over brother Han tells us mercy is over at the reality opening of the Seventh Seal let me prove that to you so in other words when revelation 8:1 happens and there's silence in heaven for the space half hour there's lightning thunderings proceeding out of the throne in Revelation chapter 8 that's when the judgment seat is that's when the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat here's where he says this is in the breech remember he'd been on the mediator work back there but remember these seals are ready to be open and the lamb come from the sanctuary of God advance forward wait till we get that over there one hour and take that 1/2 hour that is silent that's revelation 8:1 and the church said this is revelation 8 what right here yeah the sanctuary smoking I'm going to show it to you it's Revelation chapter 8 there's no more intercession the sacrifice has left because they hit down the rapturous bride amen it's a judgment see there's no blood in it anymore for the blood covered lamb has walked away wait till you get to that time here's where it is revelation 8:1 there's silence in heaven the space half hour and then a sensor and then what happens with the sensor where is it yeah smoke but that said that altar smoky there it is this revelation 8 is when the throne becomes a judgment scene not revelation 5 revelation 8 and the church said I prove it to you right there with a quote and the scripture and now our seven angels begin to sound the seven trumpets which brother Graham said all seven trumpets sound from the two prophets of the revelation chapter eleven under the sixth seal praise God after the raptures are taking place amen and so brother branham the way he preached this I believe God was still revealing to him some of these things brother Graham had to come back over a year and three months later and tell everybody that mercy is still available even though the seals are open they're still mercy today aren't so glad aren't you glad for questions and answers oh my those were some of the most helpful sermons when I first come in the message so if you should have questions about things he developed into all four since 1964 they will bless your soul I just used to listen to him over and over and they clear up so much confusion in my life they say brother branham some say mercy is over and no one can be saved is that true he said I'm glad I got this one we watch them pray we watch the paralyzed and it seems some are still finding mercy how many former see when you got saved oh oh I'm so glad that mercy rewrote my life brother brother owes them so bad God saved a wretch like me oh thank you Jesus I found mercy in my life program so that's the first question his mercy over don't never think that see you would never think it because when Mercy's over you're gone as long as you're here Mercy's here amen but when you're gone Mercy's gone hey man that's my program said don't you never think that as long as you're here because for you to be here the blood of Christ still has to be available in heaven because you need the blood of Christ you love the blood of Jesus Christ and you live for the blood of Jesus Christ amen so as long as you're here there's mercy I don't like you hiding the mercy every day I never got to a day yet by the way where I didn't need God's mercy to forgive me of something I did wrong something I thought or said that was foolish I should not have said it because I need God's mercy every hour he said don't think that just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away I love this he says we noticed the prayer lines some finds mercy sure mercy the doors are open he said I think where you got this the thought lay between I don't have time to give each of these scriptures right their place but each of these things their right place in the prayer line if I'm mercy now look at this if I know Jesus was coming this afternoon I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing right now just continuing right on Mercy is always open do you remember in the seals brother Ram said if I knew the rapture was this week he said I would be in church right now preaching to the God's elect praise the Lord do you think church is important then to God hey bro grant knew the rapture was this week he would not skip Church to try to save souls he'd be at his post of duty right where God wants him feeding God's sheep God wouldn't want his sheep to miss one meal on the Word of God ha ha ha amen because we had to promise all that the father's give me will come to me so if God calls us the faithful church attendance brother man have said every Christian should have a home Church and he said if the love of God is in you he said you'll be in church every time the doors open amen he said you can't wait to get to the house of God if you got the Holy Ghost inside of you because it's fellowship you get the worship your Creator I know Jesus was coming tonight I'd be preaching tonight oh the blood of Jesus Christ the mediator he's redeemed us back and in a moment we'll be gone would that be glorious amen if we knew he was coming back tonight hmm that's how much God thinks of your post of duty Church that's how much God thinks of us being in the house of God worshiping him I'd say it doesn't look like much but in God's eyes it's a beautiful thing it's God's children gathering around his word gathering at his table how many parents like when your children maybe they get older moved away I wonder how William felt when he first got to the table and had his first meal and years with his daughter Naomi how'd you feel brother that must have been the great feeling just to sit down and enjoy some fellowship reach across the table hold hands eat some food laugh together and that's what the Bible that's what it is when you come to church you gather on your father's throat and he feeds you all the good foods that children you like this is this good preach and you like the Word of God because remember there's only one preacher that's Christ I'm no preacher I can't help anybody but if you love God God will feed you every time you come to the house of God amen and now where I get is the finishing of the seven church ages in the seven seals being lived so see brother Aaron tells us why people thought mercy was over they misunderstood the church ages in the seals the seven seals it's manifested what takes place has what is took place the seven church age were at the end of the seven churches when I say the end that doesn't mean at this very hour this very minute oh thank you brother Rams but see if you had the Holy Ghost you would not have been confused on that because the Holy Ghost will answer your question he'll lead and guide you into all truth you remember the Bible said back in the days Lord Jesus Paul said for the time is at hand Peter said that over and over again be ready the time is at hand you know what kind of life should we live becoming a lord is soon and it's been 2,000 years since Peter said that you realize how long that was in God's time that was just yesterday because one day with God is as a thousand years with man it's just been dude two days since Paul was preaching on the earth it's just been two days what God calls at hand is not what we call it hand so just keep on believing brothers sisters keep on praying God still got mercy open just keep flowing into it as fast as you can God will do the stopping when it's time to stop how many want to flow into God's mercy I want mercy to flow into me do amen okay I didn't get this one but there's a quote from questions and answers they asked brother Branham is the latest in church over he says no he said the letter saying the latest in church age does not end until the rapture takes place some people say oh we're not in the lair to see it we're in the bride age well yeah yes and no yeah you're in the bride age when you have the baptism Holy Ghost but your body is still in Laodicea let me follow you around the whole day if you say I'm in the marriage let me follow you're on the whole day and I'll point out and show you how you're still living in labor to see it because you'll eventually sin amen Church eventually I'll point I'll just be that little angel on your shoulder and pretty soon I'll see where you say something wrong or you do something wrong you look at something you should not look at oh yes you are stood so you can't send the bride age see you're still it you're still able to see yeah I wonder how many wood bouncer yeah follow me around mo just follow me around all day show me where I'm wrong I don't think I'd move Allen to you for that now this is beautiful look what brother BAM says maybe I can close after this I didn't get to all of it but I better close up this brother BAM tells us what Jesus actually means when he steps forward and takes the book he goes through this list of what Jesus is actually saying with his words although he's not saying it this is what his actions mean when he comes forth and takes the book out of the right hand of him who sat upon it in other words the eternal spirit Jesus comes out looking all bloody he's like a lamb he's all bloody he comes and takes the book it must be floating there I don't know who must be floating there by the throne of the rainbow or something or by the four beasts or something like that before cherubims and he comes and takes the book here's what bro Graham said Jesus would would actually have said if he could have been talking to this moment notice he's not an animal so he wasn't a literal lamb he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne who was it the owner of the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what is it brother this is the most sublime in the scripture a act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that said upon the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen did you catch that chapter 5 is the most sublime act in all of Scripture Wow that's pretty powerful isn't it church John's crying like oh we're a sentence gonna rule over us and he's gonna have the Rees gonna be god of this world forever if nobody takes that book we're never gonna come to our full maturity everything's lost it's all just been a waste he's weeping and all of a sudden he sees Jesus and this is the most sublime thing in all the Bible Oh hallelujah he says God's law required he's the one that holds it God's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out boldly so now he walks out boldly like a lion and a lamb and Jesus said I am their kinsman I am their Redeemer I now made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them he said amen amen I come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and I paid the price he said old brother woo don't it make you feel religious not by good words which we have done but by His mercy oh wait a minute and then elders and everything else began to throw out their crowns that didn't it tears begin to get on the ground amen this was such a beautiful moment that they followed their faces and they throw their crowns down this was so sublime this was so beautiful if no one takes this book we're all gonna be under Satan's Dominion we're lost it's all been in vain our lives have been in vain but when Jesus come and takes the book they get so happy they throw their crowns out and they fall on their faces at the foot of Jesus ah now wonder what other scripture we might think was pretty sublime I'm sure you thought 1st Thessalonians 4 was pretty sublime about the rapture the shout voice Trump how many thought that was sublime well brother have said revelation 5 is the most sublime scripture no one no one can do it and he walks right up to the right hand of God and the book out of his right hand and claim his rights here's here's the one I want to read Jesus when he does he's saying I have died for Bride of Christ fellowship I am their kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become a man and I did this in order to get that church back again the word I Forrest's foresaw before the foundation ward I purposed it I spoke that it would be there and nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am their kinsman I become their kinfolks this is the most sublime thing in scripture because brother bran doesn't get credit for salvation Elijah doesn't get credit for salvation Mary the Virgin doesn't get credit for salvation no one can get any help no one getting credit all the credit falls on our Lord Jesus Christ no one can glory in God's presence that's why this is the most sublime there's only one conquer there's only one I am Amen sublime means lofty if you look it up in Merriman's Webster's lofty grand exalted tending to inspire awe so maybe by the end of this some of your jaws will drop open and you like this done preaching well if it's the most sublime thing in scripture I might expect somebody to be that look like that no I'm just joking you understand what I'm saying but if we really think about this church john was a spirit-filled man he's weeping because no one could take this book there were such promises there was such power within that book the power of the the word in that book if no one took it they'd be lost forever we never get back to what Adam was in the Garden of Eden supreme transcendent excellent so just beyond excellent here's excellent and this sublime is beyond excellent Oh who's waiting for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there what else could wait there for you but that can fin Redeemer oh my what a sublime statement or act I better stop right there on a stay on our feet I'm just preach till ten o'clock tonight I better stop I appreciate this bard but I stand to our feet by God's good I'll have to appreciate next time maybe next into Wednesdays we'll see by God's grace you love the Lord tonight why is this so symbolize revelation five so sublime because it proves all of our righteousness is as filthy rags there's only one who is truly righteous there's only one who's a real mighty Conqueror you know we we hear it all the time well we're the bride or we're the bride or you're a mature god I even said that and that's true but you and I could not do that without Jesus Christ we must remember where all the blessings come from we must if our if we get hit on the Apple dropping underneath the apple tree like a man tells that story about the pig he doesn't even look up but if we get hit with the blessing of God we need to look up and say thank you we need to be that leper that one that tithe of the leper the one-tenth of the leper we need to be the one Oh Lord look what you've done I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna thank the Lord for all that he's done for me because I could not have this without the grace of my Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the most sublime thing the most excellent thing in scripture is Jesus taking the book and now he can give back to us what Adam lost for all these 6,000 years oh don't you love Church now how much you come here let's bow our heads and word of Prayer here praise the Lord how many thankful for Jesus Christ's Redemption power how many want to see more of that power tomorrow in your life brother Branham said thank God that mediators there tonight for me hallelujah thank you Jesus oh and I think about it Lord it just makes me want to cry like John except this time is not tears of weeping of sadness because we already know what John was going to see the lamb come forth and we read the store and we know that you've come forth and taken the book we thank you Lord God this is the most sublime thing inscription all creation was a little bit lost Satan would keep having Dominion the squatter would keep possessing that inheritance but jesus paid the price as the kids been Redeemer has the boys to the Ruth of the pride he stands there in the mediatorial gate and he says I've bought they owe me and I get Ruth and Jesus you did that for us you brought the Jew and you got the Gentile bride thank you Lord you purchased me you purchased us with your own blood dear God oh you overcame you prevail not in heaven you prevailed in the Garden of Gethsemane Oh God I literally oh Jesus thank you thought thank you for prevailing in prayer Lord God for us Oh God Alleluia [Music] thank you lord thank you Jesus for prevailing for me Oh God [Music] while I was in a sinner you died the righteous for the unrighteous Oh God hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord God oh the mighty conquered the great damned the great lion [Music] you prevail for me Jesus thank you Lord oh it's so sublime Lord God in your presence here tonight Lord God what a great thing you've done John's weeping Enoch can't step up to the plate Moses can't step up to the plate the Virgin Mary can we know brother branham cannot I stepped up and took that book only Jesus only you Lord could have taken that book so we reserved all the praise since you're the only one who could do it you're the only one who gets our praise or not very bad we don't worship a prophet we don't worship a virgin we don't worship anyone we just worship the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah what a sublime thing Lord God or the even the 24 elders throw their crowds [Music] your presents so great they put their faces on the ground in happy Alleluia that's how he feel tonight Lord you're so great we just bow our heads Oh God in your presence thank you Lord God but I pray for your people Lord as I mentioned earlier just a moment ago Lord all these rights and powers and dominions and authority you brought back I pray Lord the people and I could experience more of them tomorrow more of them this week we know the fullness won't come to the rapture or another time Lord but Lord let us experience part of our inheritance more and more dear God because you bought it back you purchased it back to organize you want us to enjoy our inheritance what is to enjoy our land the year of Jubilee I already come out of a mint you're inviting us to come back and take our inheritance lord help us to be so humble Lord strong like a lion in prayer but is Alea to be just like our Lord Jesus the Lord perhaps this week some of us have to be kicked around by sinners maybe by people the church perhaps this week we got to be kicked around by our families help us to be able to do that as a land help us not to be a goat or a donkey that would kick back that would try to get revenge but help us to be meek like a lamb sweet like the sweet Holy Spirit dove granted Jesus we know you'll do it your God Father we thank you for all that you've done this sublime act that you did tonight move be forever be grateful Lord God and Lord I'm looking forward to the day when I have my crown on and I could be like these 24 years and I can just throw it down and said you're the one who got it for me in the first place I could not have done this without your grace hunters without your redemption I cannot overcome lust I cannot overcome greed or hatred I cannot overcome that only by the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] so you're the reason Lord Jesus that I've been over covering the first place I guess my crowd at your feet I couldn't do without you I was lost without you but you became a kids new to me you became flesh took my curse upon you and you empowered me to be an overcomer thank you lord help each person here to rule over their bodies dear God help them to bring their bodies to crucify the temptations and desires and lusts thereof of them the rule over their bodies and desires as a king of them to offer praises as a priest in their mortal bodies so that one day Lord you have us rule over this earth Lord that's not why we do it we do it because we

Lord I'll certainly cast at your feet I realize I'm a wretch as Paul said all wretched man that I am push and deliver me from this body of death but thanks be to God that gives me the victory through my Lord Jesus Christ amen hey canard for prevailing in prayer so I can prevail now thank you Jesus it is the most sublime thing Lord in scripture when all hope is lost when man and women have come to the end of their abilities and the whole creation looks like it's lost look like everything was wasted everything was done for naught then here comes our great Redeemer at the very last second here comes our great Savior to save the day like a hero who takes the stage but we're all on the edge of our seats amen Lord you're the great Savior the great rescuer Jesus we thank you Lord would be at
