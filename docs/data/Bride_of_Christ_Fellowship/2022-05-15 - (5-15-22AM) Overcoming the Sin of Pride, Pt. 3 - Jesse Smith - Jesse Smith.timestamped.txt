[2:59] the first john again chapter 2 verse 15.
[3:02] i'd like to continue on
[3:03] looking at this thought of overcoming
[3:06] pride
[3:07] overcoming pride
[3:13] first john 2.
[3:18] 15-17
[3:21] [Music]
[3:38] first john 2 15
[3:40] through 17.
[3:46] imagine we can read all three verses of
[3:48] those together here this morning
[3:50] by the grace of god
[4:04] let's begin on three for kids one two
[4:06] three love not the world neither the
[4:10] things that are in the world
[4:12] if any man love the world the love of
[4:14] the father is not in him for all that is
[4:18] in the world the lust of the flesh and
[4:20] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[4:23] life is not of the father but is on the
[4:26] world and the world passeth away and the
[4:29] lusts are out and he that doeth the will
[4:32] of god and the light of the bread how
[4:35] many will do the will of god
[4:37] may god has blessings
[4:45] we have some uh
[4:47] scriptures and quotes to show here
[4:55] as i said i want to use the same text
[4:57] look at pride here
[5:00] overcoming the sin of pride we want to
[5:02] overcome the sin of pride
[5:08] you know we looked at you know the last
[5:10] few times we've been gathered here
[5:11] looking at pride we looked at how jesus
[5:13] taught us about pride and jesus said if
[5:16] we humble ourselves
[5:18] uh from pride he would exalt us but he
[5:20] said if we exalt ourselves he would
[5:22] bring us down to humbleness
[5:25] and we saw you know of course the first
[5:27] person that ever sinned was
[5:29] an angel was lucifer
[5:31] and he was so beautiful he was so
[5:35] so
[5:36] wise that he thought well i should i
[5:39] should have a better position i should
[5:41] have a better place and
[5:43] and i thought it was interesting that
[5:44] you know he was so beautiful he had he
[5:46] had the most beauty and the most wisdom
[5:48] but he wasn't the strongest
[5:51] there's a stronger one than lucifer and
[5:53] that was michael praise god
[5:55] the sea church you know god gives us all
[5:57] different measures and different
[5:58] portions of gifts
[6:00] but there's always going to be someone
[6:01] that is better that's better than us at
[6:04] something praise god
[6:05] and that's what lucifer found out he
[6:06] thought well i'm so beautiful i've got
[6:08] all these gifts i'm so wise
[6:11] i i think i can exalt myself to a higher
[6:13] place and
[6:14] i deserve i deserve a better position
[6:17] but he found out there's someone
[6:19] stronger than him praise god he wasn't
[6:21] the strongest of the angels and so god
[6:23] always has a way to humble us praise god
[6:26] and uh of course we know we know pride
[6:29] will never become something to us that
[6:31] will cause us to lose our salvation but
[6:33] it is something we're always going to
[6:35] have to battle praise god as we saw in
[6:37] our text today and as we've been
[6:38] rehearsing the last few times
[6:40] we're always going to have to battle
[6:42] pride it is one of the three
[6:44] areas where we'll be tempted in
[6:46] throughout our life but i just want to
[6:48] read a few quotes here what brother
[6:49] graham said i was listening to you know
[6:51] there's one sermon that has the word
[6:52] pride in it it's called pride
[6:54] from 1955 and brother random he takes a
[6:58] text out of the book of luke where simon
[7:00] the pharisee invited jesus over and he
[7:02] was and he came in and they didn't wash
[7:05] jesus feet
[7:06] you know the story they didn't they
[7:08] didn't anoint his head
[7:10] and then so then a woman comes in and
[7:12] does all that she
[7:13] she cries you know she weeps tears on
[7:16] jesus feet
[7:17] and it's just a beautiful picture
[7:20] of how
[7:21] religious people religious pride will
[7:24] not welcome jesus
[7:26] but a humble person who's humble and
[7:29] knows they're a sinner knows they need
[7:30] salvation they'll welcome jesus amen
[7:33] amen aren't you glad we welcome jesus
[7:35] this morning praise god amen hallelujah
[7:37] with our worship amen with our prayers
[7:39] amen
[7:40] with our devotion to god we worship him
[7:43] and we recognize his presence is here
[7:45] praise god but we must be very careful
[7:48] when we invite jesus to then recognize
[7:50] his presence once he comes
[7:52] and he says how do we know his presence
[7:54] people will repent
[7:57] [Applause]
[8:02] that's how you know his presence amen
[8:03] because that's what the woman did she
[8:05] was weeping there
[8:06] seeking forgiveness and jesus said her
[8:09] sins which are many are forgiven
[8:11] hallelujah amen amen
[8:14] so that's the one sermon where brother
[8:15] brown used the word pride in the title
[8:17] right there's over there's almost 1200
[8:19] sermons and that's the only one where he
[8:21] used the word pride in the sermon
[8:23] but brother ham says pride is a cursed
[8:25] thing
[8:27] he said it's an awful thing to be a
[8:30] slave to it's an evil thing it's a
[8:33] horrible thing and the church said amen
[8:35] now here's what he says in that sermon
[8:36] he says my subject would be pride oh
[8:40] pride such a cursive thing
[8:42] so awful so evil
[8:45] he says is pride
[8:47] and that he goes in this story of jesus
[8:49] life
[8:50] i just want to remind us of that
[8:52] churchill it is so awful if we get a
[8:55] higher estimation of ourselves than what
[8:57] we really are
[8:58] that is an awful thing to be in that's a
[9:00] that's an awful state to be in
[9:03] if we start having confidence like i can
[9:06] do this without god i can do this
[9:08] without seeking god i don't really need
[9:10] to pray about this i can just do this
[9:12] because i've always done this i don't
[9:15] have this ability god has blessed me
[9:16] before so i can just do this without
[9:18] praying that is a cursive thing that is
[9:22] an awful thing
[9:23] when we get so confident that we feel
[9:25] like we don't need god's direction
[9:27] anymore that is an awful hindrance to
[9:29] our walk with god thank god that god
[9:32] humbles us and brings us down and makes
[9:34] us remember where every good blessing
[9:36] comes from amen
[9:38] hallelujah it's such an awful thing
[9:41] when we get prideful and think
[9:43] uh we can do something without god's
[9:45] help
[9:46] just consider that you know think i
[9:48] think i was awful for satan and we'll
[9:50] get to some other examples think how
[9:52] awful pride can become to people if they
[9:54] don't quickly repent of it and humble
[9:56] themselves
[9:58] and get themselves back in a more uh
[10:02] lower position than what we actually
[10:04] should be in
[10:06] so brother man now preaches again on the
[10:08] unwelcome christ he said that big
[10:10] pharisee asked my lord to come and let
[10:12] and let him sit over there with that
[10:13] dung on his feet wouldn't give him any
[10:15] oil let him sit there stinking
[10:17] unattended unrefreshed unwelcome and all
[10:20] of them look on saying oh look at him
[10:22] oh god have mercy on this sinful world
[10:24] what a horrible curse pride is now look
[10:28] at that jesus was in a rich man's house
[10:30] but brother adam said he was cursed
[10:33] see money is not the answer to being
[10:35] that doesn't mean you're blessed if you
[10:37] have money
[10:39] he was actually rich and had servants
[10:41] none of us here have any servants do we
[10:43] we have helpers our children thank god
[10:46] for them but they could be gone soon and
[10:47] so they're not servants
[10:49] they're helpers
[10:51] but he was so rich he had servants so
[10:53] much money but at the same time he was
[10:55] cursed with a demon of pride
[10:59] all because he wouldn't go over and wash
[11:01] jesus feet and make him feel welcome i
[11:03] want you to feel welcome i want you to
[11:04] uh we're all going to recognize you
[11:06] we're all going to thank you for your
[11:07] healing ministry of your preaching is
[11:09] changing this world and you're just
[11:10] doing such a wonderful we're so thankful
[11:12] god has sent you you know
[11:15] he wouldn't even give him any uh
[11:18] any any compliments they wouldn't give
[11:20] him any respect
[11:22] he said what a curse that was
[11:25] he says you're too good
[11:27] he said they thought they were too good
[11:29] we're sure we go to church and that
[11:30] knows better than that we don't believe
[11:32] in divine healing all we have nothing to
[11:33] do with that pharisee
[11:36] jesus is in your town amen entertain him
[11:39] love him embrace him worship him amen
[11:43] that's why we're here praise god we're
[11:45] here to worship jesus entertain him to
[11:48] love him to tell him how thankful we are
[11:50] for all that he's done for us amen amen
[11:53] that's why we're here praise god
[11:55] we're here to forget about our worldly
[11:57] trials and and all the awful things in
[11:59] the world
[12:00] how it keeps getting worse and worse and
[12:02] worse right the birth things keep coming
[12:04] as we said last week they keep coming it
[12:06] gets worse and worse but here is the
[12:09] place where jesus is welcome amen
[12:12] they will welcome him in the government
[12:14] they will welcome him in the societies
[12:16] and and all the events in the theaters
[12:19] they won't welcome him there but we'll
[12:21] welcome him here hallelujah
[12:23] and we're blessed with humility praise
[12:25] god we're blessed to know that our life
[12:28] is but a vapor
[12:30] we're blessed to know that god can take
[12:31] our life at any time and still be a
[12:34] blessing to be able to say that we knew
[12:36] jesus christ and this side on this life
[12:39] in the power of his resurrection and the
[12:41] fellowship of a suffering it was a
[12:43] blessing to give our lives as a
[12:45] sacrifice unto christ
[12:50] amen ram said he said only had one
[12:53] regret in his life
[12:54] he wished he would have given his heart
[12:55] to jesus sooner
[12:58] how many have that regret praise god
[13:00] amen
[13:02] i wish i would have surrendered sooner
[13:03] praise god
[13:05] instead of being prideful and
[13:07] trying to live life my way with
[13:10] with my with my ideas and and my my
[13:13] decision making rather than holding
[13:15] myself and letting jesus guide me
[13:20] hallelujah remember church as i said
[13:22] temporary curses still exist remember in
[13:24] the corinthian church many were sickened
[13:26] weakly among them because they didn't
[13:28] discern the body of the lord
[13:30] they didn't know how to treat one
[13:31] another didn't know how to repent to one
[13:33] another they didn't know how to
[13:34] apologize to one another
[13:37] they didn't know how to speak good about
[13:38] your brother or sister brother says if
[13:40] you want somebody to say something good
[13:41] about you say something good about them
[13:43] first
[13:44] right
[13:45] just think about all the good things
[13:48] that people have done for you and say
[13:50] good things about other people it'll
[13:52] come back to you praise god amen
[13:55] that's exactly right amen
[13:57] but what a horrible curse
[13:59] pride
[14:00] is
[14:02] thinking highly of yourself
[14:04] right thinking you know something
[14:06] thinking that you have some special
[14:09] uh
[14:10] special place that's above everybody
[14:12] else
[14:14] we know that's not the case praise god
[14:16] and because we know the bible says also
[14:18] we're saved by grace he said not by
[14:21] works thus any man can boast
[14:24] so anyone who's saved now or at the
[14:25] white throne judgment you're going to be
[14:27] saved by grace david that answers the
[14:28] question from a few weeks ago
[14:30] right because if you if you can boast
[14:32] about it
[14:34] then you've done it then you didn't need
[14:35] it you could do it yourself you could
[14:37] earn your own salvation so if god saves
[14:39] any man it'll be by the grace of god
[14:41] amen
[14:43] i just i think i told meg about that
[14:44] last week by god's grace
[14:47] if it's my works now the bible says
[14:49] he'll judge by works right
[14:51] he'll judge by works but it's still
[14:53] salvation by grace amen because they did
[14:57] the bible says they did something good
[14:58] hallelujah they were good
[15:01] there's a third one he says the first
[15:03] thing you know that old pharisee said
[15:04] see i told you he wasn't no prophet he
[15:06] would have known see look at that woman
[15:08] will even ruin his reputation oh how
[15:10] blind
[15:11] see that harlot woman washing his feet
[15:13] they said oh she's gonna ruin his
[15:14] reputation he said oh pride is such an
[15:17] evil thing
[15:19] they thought simon thought the woman
[15:21] would ruin his reputation why brother
[15:24] jesus reputation was made
[15:26] in the presence of sinners amen
[15:29] this harlot washing his feet made his
[15:31] reputation amen
[15:33] this made him the king of kings and lord
[15:36] of lords amen
[15:37] i knew that he would forgive
[15:40] a prostitute that he would forgive an
[15:42] adulteress amen that made his reputation
[15:45] that he was the god of grace that he was
[15:47] the god of mercy he was rich and mercy
[15:49] amen amen
[15:52] so church when sinners like us are when
[15:54] humble people like us worship god it
[15:56] doesn't hurt god's reputation it proves
[15:59] his reputation
[16:03] that's where his reputation is made not
[16:05] amongst the starch instead but among
[16:08] sinners who's willing to repent praise
[16:10] god
[16:11] that's where jesus jesus reputation was
[16:13] made
[16:14] when sinners will come to him
[16:16] hallelujah
[16:18] so see that's when you know jesus is
[16:20] working humility in your life when you
[16:22] can look at your sins and say lord
[16:24] forgive me i repent of those
[16:27] right at every stage of our life whether
[16:29] we're just a new christian whether we're
[16:31] in justification sanctification baptism
[16:33] holy ghost no matter where we are when
[16:35] we can look at our lives and say jesus
[16:36] forgive me i should not have did this
[16:39] help me to move past this give me
[16:40] overcoming grace that's when you're in a
[16:42] place of humility and that's where god
[16:44] can use you
[16:46] that reminds me of moses
[16:48] when moses was prideful and he killed
[16:49] one egyptian
[16:51] god couldn't use him
[16:53] yeah but when he humbled himself and
[16:55] said i can't do it god gave him three uh
[16:58] sorry two signs god gave me aaron to
[17:00] talk and in humility he delivered two
[17:02] million people out of egypt
[17:06] but then when he smote the rock and he
[17:07] he hit the rock and his pride god
[17:10] wouldn't let him go into the promised
[17:11] land
[17:12] so in humility he could take two million
[17:14] people out but in pride he wasn't
[17:16] allowed to go in
[17:19] see so which is the right choice the
[17:21] right choice is always pride i'm sorry
[17:24] i'm sorry humility and overcoming pride
[17:27] amen
[17:28] forgive me
[17:29] the right choice is always humanity
[17:32] humbling yourself pride will always lead
[17:34] to a fall amen
[17:36] like i heard a preacher derek prince
[17:38] he's like he was a pentecostal preacher
[17:39] good preacher
[17:41] he did a lot of things right
[17:43] of course he's wrong on the godhead but
[17:44] he had divine healing right and a lot of
[17:45] other things about fasting and praying
[17:48] i love what he said he said when you
[17:50] break the law of pride because remember
[17:52] jesus said pride and humility is a law
[17:55] when you break that law there's
[17:57] consequences
[17:59] if you break that law god will break you
[18:03] right and he gave the example when you
[18:05] break the law of gravity if you go up on
[18:07] top of the uh of a
[18:09] ten-story building and if you break the
[18:11] law of gravity you just say well i'll
[18:12] see if i can step out there where
[18:13] there's where there's no
[18:15] uh there's no there's no place to step
[18:17] let me just see if i can step out of
[18:18] here what's gonna happen
[18:20] if you break the law the law is gonna
[18:22] break you amen you're gonna have some
[18:23] broken bones if you even survive
[18:26] praise god and that's how pride and
[18:28] humility is
[18:30] if you break this this law of god it's
[18:32] like this spiritual eternal law like
[18:34] reaping and sowing right if you exhaust
[18:36] we exalt ourselves god is going to break
[18:39] you he's going to humble you he's going
[18:40] to bring you to the spot where you
[18:42] realize it's not gonna turn out like you
[18:44] thought it was or if we're boasting
[18:45] about something or or if we're thinking
[18:47] something's gonna happen or something
[18:49] like that if we exalt ourselves like
[18:51] that god is gonna humble us and we'll
[18:52] have to look up to him and say god
[18:54] forgive me you were right i was wrong i
[18:56] humbled myself in your presence
[18:58] amen
[19:00] i'm broken
[19:04] how many would rather repent right away
[19:05] rather than be broken by god's uh name
[19:08] god's
[19:08] chastisement amen
[19:10] i'd rather
[19:11] catch you by the holy spirit that still
[19:14] small voice is whispering in my heart
[19:16] you should not have said that
[19:17] yeah should not have did that
[19:20] until i want that to happen quickly
[19:22] before it gets to an awful spot
[19:24] where where i can't even hear the voice
[19:26] of god anymore and i i don't even have
[19:28] to seek god or i i don't feel like i
[19:30] need to seek god anymore
[19:34] now church we left off a couple weeks
[19:36] ago
[19:38] with jesus disciples arguing about who
[19:41] was the greatest
[19:42] right
[19:44] and then we saw message preachers not
[19:46] arguing but actually taking turns
[19:48] exalting them
[19:50] which one's greater yeah
[19:53] and not a sad thing
[19:55] it's still the same spirit
[19:57] in both cases they both want to be the
[19:58] greatest
[20:00] but in the modern case they're just
[20:03] inviting the next one to come to their
[20:04] church just they can tell everybody how
[20:06] great they are
[20:09] that's wrong
[20:10] that's pride
[20:12] now the live streamers can't see that
[20:13] can they
[20:16] i don't think so i'll just string it
[20:17] just in case i've noticed church in most
[20:19] of these cases we went over a lot of
[20:21] these gentlemen were elderly
[20:23] two of them were 67 years old
[20:26] 161 and one in the 60s
[20:30] i just thought that was so interesting
[20:32] now do young people show pride as well
[20:35] yes of course
[20:37] but i thought amongst message believers
[20:39] and people that have faith like us i
[20:41] thought it's so interesting that these
[20:43] orderly these elderly brothers
[20:46] are the ones who are prideful
[20:50] but i've come to learn as i told you
[20:51] even with brother brown's battle with
[20:52] the critical spirit right and his
[20:54] complex at the end of his life i've come
[20:56] to realize it's not if you're going to
[20:58] battle pride it's when you're going to
[21:00] battle pride
[21:03] in other words
[21:05] we can't relax and say well i don't i'm
[21:07] always going to be humble
[21:09] that's prideful
[21:10] i've always hug i'm just the most humble
[21:12] person there ever was like moses was the
[21:14] meekest man
[21:16] it's not well maybe i'll battle pride
[21:18] someday no it's absolutely guaranteed
[21:20] you're going to battle pride
[21:22] it's guaranteed
[21:24] you are going to battle pride and the
[21:26] older you get the more you're going to
[21:28] battle it
[21:30] right so brother jose sister bertha uh
[21:33] sister beatrice
[21:34] no doubt they battled pride
[21:36] it'd be interesting if we could give
[21:38] them some time to think about it they
[21:39] could maybe share some testimonies
[21:41] all right now we battle in our younger
[21:43] days well i'm so strong i can do it or i
[21:44] need to pray about it i can do it you
[21:46] know
[21:47] we have our our battles when we're
[21:48] younger
[21:49] but clearly in the scripture we can see
[21:52] the older ones battle pride as well
[21:55] remember with with white hair comes
[21:57] wisdom the bible says
[21:58] but also if they're not careful they can
[22:00] be deceived into thinking they're more
[22:02] wise or more and they can become more
[22:04] prideful than the younger ones as well
[22:08] praise god
[22:10] now it's also my observation that pride
[22:13] is a great battle all saints fight but
[22:16] undoubtedly towards the end of our lives
[22:18] think about moses when did moses smite
[22:19] the rock right at the end of his life
[22:21] right when he was ready to see the land
[22:23] he'd been he'd been preaching about for
[22:24] 40 years
[22:26] right at the end
[22:28] right around the time he's 120 that's
[22:31] when pride rose up in him he said you
[22:33] bunch of rebels
[22:35] and he'd already how many times did he
[22:36] rebel against the word of god you know
[22:38] if he's honest if we're honest we rebel
[22:40] every single day
[22:41] right we sin every single day
[22:44] but he called these people a bunch of
[22:45] rebels he let the other people's
[22:47] attitude influence them
[22:49] so church let's be uh let's be convicted
[22:52] in our hearts we're not gonna let other
[22:54] people's bad attitudes bring us down
[22:55] amen
[22:57] we're not gonna be influenced by the
[22:58] crowd let the crowd or those people say
[23:01] whatever they want i'm gonna stand with
[23:02] jesus amen amen
[23:04] i'm gonna keep my heart pure i'm gonna
[23:06] have faith like a child amen amen
[23:10] i'm not gonna be influenced by the
[23:12] prideful people
[23:13] when did it happen end of his life
[23:18] david when did he number the people when
[23:20] he when did he do that with bathsheba
[23:22] towards the end of his life i think his
[23:23] 50s when he when he uh had the bathsheba
[23:26] affair and then uh i think 60s or 70s
[23:29] was when he actually did the numbering
[23:30] of the people
[23:33] all that ride the bible said the bible
[23:34] said david's heart smote him as soon as
[23:36] he as soon as he sent the the word to
[23:38] number the people he knew was wrong it
[23:40] was a work of pride i want to see how
[23:42] great my kingdom is now you see it on
[23:44] instagram or facebook all the time hey i
[23:47] got a net worth you ever seen that video
[23:49] i see i've seen all these rich i see
[23:50] some of these guys used to play football
[23:51] with together oh i've got a net worth
[23:53] and they they've got like a ring on and
[23:55] some jewelry on i'm like
[23:57] that's pride
[23:59] yeah
[24:00] i've got to work too it was the blood of
[24:02] jesus christ amen hallelujah that's what
[24:05] bought me with the prize amen that's
[24:06] what paid my price amen that's what i
[24:08] was worth i was worth the blood of jesus
[24:10] christ god said
[24:12] amen
[24:14] but bragging on
[24:16] social media look at my net worth i've
[24:17] got these jobs and they they hold up
[24:20] that's what they do they hold up their
[24:21] money my friends have done that my old
[24:23] friends from college
[24:25] hold up dollars and look at all this
[24:27] money i've got they'll put the hunters
[24:28] all in a row that's probably all the
[24:30] money they got
[24:32] right
[24:35] but david he did this after he'd all had
[24:38] all these victories he always saw god
[24:40] saw god but he didn't see god on
[24:42] bathsheba
[24:44] he despised the command
[24:46] when he could have went and and
[24:48] let his passions go with one of the 500
[24:51] but he had to have another one
[24:54] he should have the number of the people
[24:56] he should have to see how great have i
[24:57] become how great is my kingdom now he
[25:00] should have known this is not my kingdom
[25:02] it's god's kingdom amen
[25:04] god's the one that called me this i was
[25:06] the least of my brothers i was a
[25:08] shepherder there's no way i should be in
[25:10] there he might have been grateful he had
[25:11] a house to worship amen you're then
[25:14] grateful that god let him have a king's
[25:15] house amen amen but instead of dog look
[25:18] what i've done look at the great work
[25:20] i've done
[25:22] solomon you know when the bible said we
[25:24] got old all this all of his wives turned
[25:26] his heart away
[25:28] see church if we're not careful all of
[25:30] our successes all of our testimonies can
[25:32] turn our hearts away if we don't own
[25:34] ourselves and give the credit where the
[25:36] credit is due
[25:37] [Music]
[25:39] remember john 15 5 my life burst
[25:41] probably over my first team
[25:43] he said without me you can do nothing
[25:45] amen our life amounts to nothing except
[25:48] we yield ourselves we humble ourselves
[25:50] and jesus can work through us praise god
[25:53] amen
[25:54] when it happened at the end of solomon's
[25:56] life
[25:59] in church he just left the stain on his
[26:01] life right it still leaves a state on
[26:02] his life
[26:04] people talk about sovereign they rejoice
[26:05] in what he did in the beginning but
[26:08] at the end god was upset with him yeah
[26:10] he had gained the anger of the lord
[26:12] against him
[26:14] uzziah we'll get to that in a little bit
[26:15] we saw gideon remember getting on
[26:17] wednesday night when that is just
[26:18] beautiful the scripture shows how we can
[26:21] learn from him he was anointed for all
[26:22] these miracles with twelve thousand
[26:24] lords as soon as he got to victory
[26:27] he fell because of pride and flattery
[26:32] he flatters the uh i think it was the
[26:34] tribe of manasseh if i'm not mistaken or
[26:35] ephraim he traveled
[26:37] he says well you're the greater they
[26:39] said why didn't you call us in the
[26:40] battle
[26:41] instead of saying well god didn't want
[26:43] you there
[26:44] he said well you're just so much greater
[26:45] than we are that you're
[26:47] pridefully exalting them
[26:50] see you would think you would think by
[26:52] then the other had a hold of humility
[26:54] but church we all got to be careful
[26:57] we are all suspect of fall
[27:00] because satan's like a roaring lion he's
[27:03] like a lion
[27:05] him whom he may devour yeah praise god
[27:09] you see we're not going to be swallowed
[27:10] up by a satan we won't be slaughtered by
[27:14] satan but the bible says if we go in the
[27:16] rapture we're swallowed up in life amen
[27:19] death is swallowed up in victory
[27:21] hallelujah that's what we're going to be
[27:23] swatted up by
[27:24] i don't know you're the rapture amen
[27:27] a brand new body a theophany a glorified
[27:29] body that's what swallows us up
[27:31] hallelujah
[27:34] remember paul i see i like paul's
[27:36] example better we're not told of him
[27:39] falling in the sin we he just says you
[27:41] know i do some things i hate that i do
[27:45] but to keep him humble god set a
[27:47] buffeting demon on him to give him eye
[27:49] trouble
[27:51] lord take it away lord take it away lord
[27:53] take it away he said my grace is
[27:54] sufficient for you i've given you this
[27:57] to you so you remain humble because of
[27:59] all the revelations you received
[28:02] praise god
[28:04] that's
[28:07] that's our attitude we should have lord
[28:08] whatever it takes to keep me humble keep
[28:11] me humble amen hallelujah
[28:13] whatever it takes keep me humble help me
[28:17] be a humble servant not to be exalted
[28:20] and not to be prideful not to have the
[28:22] curse of pride in my life
[28:24] lord i don't want to be cursed with
[28:25] pride i want to be blessed with humility
[28:27] amen amen hallelujah
[28:30] and you know i noticed how uh
[28:33] pride always battles people towards the
[28:35] end of their life and then i thought
[28:36] about these books that we listen to i
[28:38] don't know most of you like lamplighter
[28:39] i love lamplighter you know
[28:41] i've heard them so many times i kind of
[28:44] uh
[28:45] hopefully put out some new ones you know
[28:48] but my favorite is certainly this by the
[28:49] way that is absolutely my favorite i
[28:51] love that one but two of them came to my
[28:53] mind and in both stories written in the
[28:55] 1800s in both stories there's a knight
[28:58] there's a hero a christian and he's a
[29:00] type of a christian
[29:02] and the last battle they face in both of
[29:04] them was a giant was it the giant pride
[29:08] i thought wow these people had some
[29:09] wisdom it was the mayonnaise that's
[29:10] right okay now i got it
[29:12] amen
[29:13] then the wisdom of god
[29:16] so in this story the giant killer i'd
[29:18] recommend anybody listen to it you can
[29:19] just buy it on their website
[29:22] he fights five giants in his lifetime he
[29:25] battles the giant sloth which is
[29:27] laziness
[29:29] anybody ever be tough to be lazy
[29:33] then he fights the giant of selfishness
[29:37] okay
[29:39] and then he battles the giant of untruth
[29:41] or the giant of like a lie
[29:44] then he battles the giant of hatred
[29:48] and then the last one he battles is the
[29:50] giant pride and as the as the hero is
[29:53] trying to figure out are you are you
[29:55] with me or against me
[29:57] he says i'm going to put you to the test
[29:59] he said i'm going to write something in
[30:00] the sand here
[30:01] and he says i want you to say it
[30:05] i went in this this giant you know
[30:07] he's disguised as a good guy and he said
[30:09] okay read this and he's like i were i
[30:11] think it was like
[30:13] [Music]
[30:14] he said try it again try to try to speak
[30:16] what i wrote on the ground i
[30:20] and so
[30:21] as the story goes on the the hero
[30:23] realizes this is an enemy because he
[30:26] can't say the following words he can't
[30:28] say i repent and i am thankful
[30:32] satan will never repent of his
[30:34] wickedness amen he'll never repent he'll
[30:37] never be thankful to god in church and
[30:39] and then he finally gets the victory i
[30:41] think he gets the victory on his knees
[30:42] if i'm not mistaken the giant can't
[30:44] defeat him while he's on his knees
[30:45] praying and interceding and humbling
[30:48] himself in the sight of god that's
[30:50] exactly a perfect time of our lives amen
[30:55] if we're not careful we'll get to the
[30:56] spot where we won't say sorry to anybody
[30:59] we'll think we're right all the time and
[31:01] these demons won't repent
[31:04] amen you can't convince a demon the
[31:06] person inside has to recognize it repent
[31:09] get the demon off of them and then they
[31:11] can say sorry
[31:13] that's right
[31:14] so now you know anyone in your family if
[31:16] they can't say sorry it's because they
[31:17] got a demon of pride on them it's a
[31:19] cursed thing it's awful it's a wicked
[31:21] it's a horrible thing
[31:26] like i told amen this story yesterday i
[31:27] think about i think it might well bear
[31:29] the bear telling right now
[31:32] about two months ago i had a brother a
[31:34] lovely brother who were great we were
[31:37] great friends
[31:38] but kind of out of nowhere he just said
[31:39] i'm done with our your friendship i
[31:41] don't want to hear from you anymore
[31:43] i was like
[31:45] i was really shocked
[31:46] i didn't know what to do i was so
[31:47] shocked i didn't even know what to do
[31:50] so brother denis mcbride came in here
[31:52] that guy's got a gift that's why i'm
[31:54] telling you guys
[31:55] and he got up here and he started
[31:57] preaching and he said sometimes friends
[31:59] will just leave you behind
[32:01] he said he said don't do nothing about
[32:03] it he said don't contact him he said
[32:05] just let god take care of it
[32:08] and i come up crying to the altar
[32:10] because brother man god was talking to
[32:11] me
[32:12] and i love when god talks to me amen
[32:14] don't you love when god talks to you
[32:16] hallelujah
[32:17] well i just waited on it
[32:19] i'm like okay i'm not going to text the
[32:20] brother back i don't even know what's i
[32:21] didn't know what to say i didn't see it
[32:23] i didn't see this coming at all
[32:26] talk to my wife about it
[32:27] or give me wisdom did you say something
[32:29] to my wife my wife gave me a lot of good
[32:30] wisdom too
[32:33] but finally just this week i got a text
[32:34] back saying
[32:36] brother i'm sorry i said those harsh
[32:38] words
[32:39] that's been a month and a half
[32:41] think about six weeks i went there for
[32:43] six weeks wondering what did i do what
[32:44] in the world is it me i was asking
[32:46] myself lord did i do something wrong
[32:48] lord show me if i sinned against this
[32:49] person i couldn't think of anything i
[32:50] did the holy spirit never brought
[32:52] anything to me
[32:53] but then this week the brother says i'm
[32:54] so sorry i had an evil spirit on me i
[32:56] got delivered will you forgive me
[32:59] amen and i said of course i'll forgive
[33:01] you i said i may be a little nervous
[33:02] around you next time i see you
[33:05] right because of the harsh things that
[33:06] were said
[33:09] but it was a beautiful example of how we
[33:11] wait on the lord
[33:13] and how we must put things in the hand
[33:14] of god seek we must ask god lord have i
[33:17] done wrong we must be humble enough to
[33:19] admit lord did i do something wrong
[33:21] we must seek the face of god this is my
[33:23] love god will always send the word in
[33:25] due season hallelujah hey
[33:28] that proved to me brother amen that
[33:29] proved when i come to church and i want
[33:31] to hear from god i just got to pull on
[33:33] the word and god will talk to me
[33:35] hallelujah
[33:36] now you prove it to me again of course
[33:38] i've heard i've had that lesson many
[33:39] times over the years but austin
[33:41] many times over the years has god spoken
[33:43] something directly through the preaching
[33:44] of the word
[33:46] if i can recognize his presence and
[33:48] humble myself then god will speak so now
[33:51] i haven't lost a friend now i've gained
[33:52] a friend like god's grace
[33:54] now brother amen i was talking about
[33:55] amen i was tempted to type something
[33:57] back like you know what let me tell you
[33:58] something
[34:01] right right we all get in the flesh
[34:03] austin i talk about that you know
[34:05] sometimes we just want to i want the
[34:06] last word
[34:08] but see i was willing to not have the
[34:10] last word yeah
[34:12] i was just trying to be i was trying to
[34:14] say god help me to be humble yes amen it
[34:17] took a lot i mean it takes a lot right
[34:22] but see those the spirit so that that
[34:23] really proved me this brother is a real
[34:25] he's really that of the holy spirit
[34:27] now
[34:29] now what may happen to church we may get
[34:30] an evil spirit on us sometimes
[34:34] and we may say something so harsh like
[34:36] how did that come out of my mouth and we
[34:38] won't even realize it till later when
[34:39] the holy spirit deals with us
[34:42] so that's why the bible says when you
[34:43] repent you must go to the person you
[34:45] offended yes
[34:46] you must go right the wrongs you have
[34:49] done and the church said amen
[34:51] what a great lesson that was for me this
[34:53] week
[34:54] six weeks i weigh down the world what do
[34:56] i do what do i do what do i do
[35:04] and so these writers were so inspired to
[35:06] check out i'm sorry to understand that
[35:10] we have giants that we face in every
[35:12] stage of our life
[35:16] so you know the young people they're
[35:17] going to face vagina am i going to get
[35:19] married
[35:22] right
[35:23] who do i marry is this the right person
[35:25] or not
[35:26] am i going to get married before the
[35:27] rapture
[35:29] that's what i was that's about what i
[35:31] was facing too
[35:34] just giants you know temptation you're
[35:36] tempted because of that fear you're
[35:38] tempted to do something without prayer
[35:45] so in each stage of our life we're going
[35:46] to battle different giants
[35:49] praise god
[35:51] like david at 50 he would he battle that
[35:52] giant of lust lust of the eyes lust of
[35:55] the flesh
[35:56] end of his life when he battled the
[35:57] giant of pride
[36:00] different giants that we face
[36:02] praise god
[36:04] march are glad all giants fall
[36:06] in the name of the lord of hosts the god
[36:08] of israel
[36:10] and we know his name now his name is the
[36:12] lord jesus christ amen
[36:14] david said i come to you in the name of
[36:16] the lord of hosts hallelujah
[36:18] and jesus said i come in my father's
[36:21] name amen
[36:22] jehovah jehovah rapha amen jehovah's
[36:26] canoe hallelujah
[36:28] jehoshaphem
[36:29] i come in my father's name jehovah is
[36:32] salvation hallelujah
[36:35] glory
[36:36] now this is my favorite book of all time
[36:38] of the lamplighters you don't got this
[36:40] one you guys need to listen to this one
[36:41] this is awesome of course you might not
[36:43] agree with me but
[36:44] that's my humble opinion
[36:47] he fights at least one two three four
[36:49] five six seven eight battles
[36:52] the first one is a temptation to turn
[36:53] back before he even starts on his
[36:55] journey
[36:56] but he's already had experience with god
[36:58] so god helps him to leave the chapel and
[36:59] he gets victory over there and says i
[37:01] know what happened to me i know i god
[37:03] delivered me god i saw the light amen
[37:06] and then the second test is the
[37:08] deception to not fight at all
[37:11] to just no oh there's no battle going on
[37:14] instead of and we'll just we'll just
[37:16] frolic we'll just eat drink and be
[37:17] married
[37:19] right like some there are some national
[37:21] believers not many but some message
[37:22] believers believe we're in the
[37:23] millennium
[37:24] if that's the case we're in the 38th
[37:26] year of the millennium
[37:28] right that's the case my brother said
[37:30] when in the millennium there's no sin
[37:31] all i see is sin when i go outside right
[37:33] yeah this can't be the money
[37:35] any person with common sense would know
[37:37] that but that shows how deceived they
[37:38] are yeah but see that's the spirit
[37:40] that's got them there's no reason to
[37:41] battle there's no reason to fight we're
[37:43] in the millennium
[37:47] the third one he fought was jealousy of
[37:48] a brother all the other brothers were
[37:50] propping up that brother what's his name
[37:53] sir felix it's her felix
[37:56] and he kind of got jealous everybody
[37:57] said oh felix he's fought greater
[37:59] barrels than you and he got jealous and
[38:01] he and he went away
[38:03] and he would have died except the holy
[38:05] spirit told felix to go save him
[38:07] he was saved by the man that he was even
[38:09] condemning amen talk about humility
[38:13] and the fourth one was the death of one
[38:15] of his closest loved ones ardent sir
[38:17] ardent
[38:19] he lost one of his companions and that
[38:20] was a great giant a great battle he had
[38:22] to face
[38:24] right when we lose people with some of
[38:26] the hardest battles thank god our church
[38:28] has been very blessed in that in this
[38:30] case
[38:31] very much god's spirit brother jose
[38:33] thank you amen
[38:36] amen
[38:38] hallelujah
[38:39] jesus kept our brother
[38:41] here with us praise god
[38:46] the fifth battle was the
[38:49] uh the veiled sisters which are called
[38:51] sorrow and pain
[38:53] so other deep sorrows and pains
[38:56] you know you'd say like depression or
[38:58] you know again like losing a loved one
[39:01] anything that would be extremely
[39:03] difficult to handle
[39:06] the next one was one of my favorites the
[39:08] praises of men
[39:11] i love that one
[39:13] because the the hero here is he's he's
[39:16] tempted to cause a a pastor who they
[39:18] call sir nameless and that's why that's
[39:20] my name it's her name listen
[39:22] he's been he's been standing at his post
[39:24] for 40 years and the enemy tries to
[39:26] trick him to convince this
[39:28] this uh veteran preacher to leave your
[39:30] post and go down there and have a feast
[39:32] unto you to uh to to celebrate you
[39:37] and of course the the hero uh sir sir
[39:42] sir what is it
[39:43] that fight is it sir uh
[39:46] consonants so constant thank you sir
[39:48] constant gets deceived and he he tries
[39:51] to get this old preacher to leave his
[39:52] post his home church
[39:54] and then the preacher dies and it's his
[39:56] fault and he has a choice you know
[39:58] either am i going to quit or rise again
[39:59] and he chooses to rise even though he he
[40:01] tried to exalt his brother and praise
[40:03] him to get his brother to take the
[40:05] praises of men more than the praise of
[40:07] god he learns his lesson and he goes on
[40:10] and this is the next one is the battle
[40:12] with the questioner is there even an
[40:13] eternal city
[40:15] is there even a rapture are you sure
[40:17] there's a rapture are you sure god said
[40:19] brother randomly yeah i'm sure amen it's
[40:21] gotta save the lord behind it amen amen
[40:24] hallelujah questions
[40:26] are you sure there's a heaven are you
[40:27] sure you're saved are you sure you're
[40:29] filled with the holy ghost but a man
[40:30] said how do you know you're safe he said
[40:32] he said just like a doctor how do you
[40:34] know you're well the doctor looks at his
[40:35] all of his instruments he looks at his
[40:37] book and if all the instruments in the
[40:38] book agree then you're well praise god
[40:41] and that's how it is for us how do we
[40:43] know we're saved the bible says repent
[40:44] and be baptized that's how i know i say
[40:47] i've taken the doctor's opinion i've
[40:49] obeyed the doctor's book and i know i'm
[40:51] saying because the bible says so amen
[40:53] hey
[40:54] yeah i got answers for your questions
[40:56] satan they're right here acts 2 38 amen
[40:58] amen that's the answer to your question
[41:01] hallelujah
[41:03] and the last battle
[41:05] that uh
[41:06] concert concept based
[41:08] was temptation to retire take an easy
[41:12] way to the
[41:13] eternal city
[41:16] and not help another man's burden so
[41:18] there's an old man hearing this huge
[41:20] bird he's sweating
[41:22] and so the enemy is there to tempt him
[41:23] well you can't help this guy because
[41:25] you've got to go you got to quickly go
[41:27] on to your reward
[41:29] and that and satan whispered he said you
[41:32] can't help him save yourself
[41:35] and then he remembers and that's pride
[41:36] i've got to take care of me
[41:39] this is all about me i've got to save
[41:41] myself
[41:42] and he recognized he says i have heard
[41:44] this voice before
[41:47] that's the first thing satan told him at
[41:48] the beginning save yourself
[41:51] that's prideful
[41:53] we're not here to save ourselves jesus
[41:55] already saved us amen
[41:57] because say like this we're here like
[41:59] paul said we're here to spend and be
[42:02] spent for other people amen amen you are
[42:05] like my wife she's here to take care of
[42:06] these eight babies by god's grace
[42:09] she is she spends and is spent for our
[42:12] family and god blesses her because of
[42:13] that amen
[42:15] hallelujahs we see it every day when we
[42:17] go up into our kitchen amen
[42:18] god blesses her for that hallelujah
[42:21] and so are you you and i we're each one
[42:23] here to spend and be spent for one
[42:26] another another way in other words god
[42:28] used me for the purpose that i'm
[42:30] supposed to be here don't let me uh uh
[42:32] don't let me frolick around let me be
[42:34] put in the service let me serve your
[42:36] purpose
[42:38] hallelujah
[42:41] so we learn these great lessons
[42:46] hallelujah
[42:49] now i was just wondering hey brother god
[42:51] bless you sir
[42:52] hallelujah where might these message
[42:54] preachers be getting these greatest
[42:56] thoughts i can think of a couple of
[42:58] quotes
[43:01] now i've always loved the church age but
[43:03] but i realize also brother level added
[43:06] some of his own grammar to it
[43:08] and he added some statements in the
[43:09] church book that we're not in the 1960
[43:12] series of the seven church ages
[43:14] but i still think the church age book is
[43:16] my second favorite book in the entire
[43:17] world
[43:18] outside of the bible
[43:20] hallelujah
[43:23] now it seems like to me that perhaps
[43:26] brother vale exalted brother branham
[43:29] maybe intentionally or unintentionally
[43:30] he's not here for me to ask him
[43:33] or else i would i would
[43:36] so let me show you what i'm talking
[43:37] about now this we're going to get down
[43:39] to here
[43:42] so brother
[43:43] in the church book
[43:44] is uh placing this in here now paul said
[43:46] the word came in power as well as voice
[43:48] that's true the word preach actually
[43:50] demonstrate itself like a flaming
[43:52] cutting sword and went to the
[43:53] consciences of men and like a surgeon's
[43:55] knife had cut off the disease and set
[43:57] the captives free everywhere those early
[43:59] believers went they went preaching the
[44:01] gospel the word and god confirmed that
[44:03] word that that word was signs following
[44:06] the sick were healed devils were cast
[44:08] out and they spoke in new tongues that
[44:10] was the word in action
[44:12] that word has never failed in the mouse
[44:15] of believing christians
[44:17] now let's stop right there
[44:20] the word of god cannot fail in a
[44:22] believer's mouth
[44:25] but we've got to balance that statement
[44:26] out
[44:27] because we've all quoted the word and
[44:28] maybe didn't come to pass
[44:31] like remember the example i showed you a
[44:32] few weeks ago with the brother in the
[44:33] message he said god's going to heal the
[44:35] sister from cancer and she died
[44:38] well what about that
[44:39] did the word fail in the mouth of
[44:40] believing christians
[44:42] well that wasn't god's word that was his
[44:43] human opinion
[44:45] he thought he knew god's will for that
[44:47] person's uh healing but he didn't
[44:50] if you speak god's word according to
[44:52] god's will god will back it up
[44:55] amen
[44:56] but if you speak your thoughts and your
[44:58] timing than what you think god does he's
[45:00] not obligated to back that up
[45:04] does everybody understand this is true
[45:06] when you're really speaking thus saith
[45:08] the lord
[45:09] but most times for us we're not prophets
[45:11] most time we won't say thus saith the
[45:12] lord
[45:13] we'll just speak the promise that's
[45:15] burning on our hearts does everybody
[45:16] understand
[45:21] now here's the
[45:22] the here's the statement i think that uh
[45:26] perhaps either brother bale made a
[45:28] mistake on or didn't know what he was
[45:30] saying or maybe just maybe people just
[45:32] misinterpreted this statement
[45:34] and in this last age the word is here
[45:37] stronger and greater than in
[45:40] than ever in the true word bride now
[45:42] think about that statement
[45:46] oh little flock you little minority hold
[45:48] on to the word fill your mouth and heart
[45:50] with it someday god will give you the
[45:51] key now that's true that's not true
[45:53] but when you say it's greater than ever
[45:55] in the word bride that means it's
[45:56] greater than this day than paul's
[45:59] now that's a statement right there
[46:03] paul labored more than peter james john
[46:06] all those men
[46:09] so are we to believe preachers today
[46:11] labor more than
[46:12] peter james john thomas who went all the
[46:15] way to india to spread the gospel died
[46:17] as a martyr
[46:18] crucified upside down
[46:20] see we got to be very careful
[46:22] with what we say
[46:25] because we're battling a spirit of pride
[46:26] here brother baby said by the way i read
[46:28] some quotes brother brandon said pride
[46:30] is a wicked thing
[46:32] he said pride is a horrible curse to be
[46:33] prideful it's a curse to be prideful
[46:38] now does he mean in brother evans
[46:40] ministry well perhaps
[46:42] but he doesn't say that
[46:43] he says in the true word bride
[46:46] so where do these preachers today get
[46:48] get these statements well we're the
[46:49] greatest christians there ever was and
[46:51] program was the greatest christian of
[46:52] all time and all these things where do
[46:54] they get these statements i don't know
[46:56] but this could be one of them
[46:58] this could be one of them
[47:02] see church we really got to humble
[47:03] ourselves
[47:05] we really have to rightly divide the
[47:07] word of god
[47:16] no i just i just
[47:18] cut out this these last few sentences
[47:19] now here down here i have two points
[47:21] about this quote that in this quote
[47:23] there's no scripture given and there's
[47:24] no thus saith the lord from brother
[47:26] branham
[47:27] so was his brother vail or brother
[47:28] branham i don't know
[47:29] but i know later in this book brother
[47:31] and gives us a thus saith the lord he
[47:33] says the fullness of pentecost will be
[47:35] in the bride
[47:36] but that's the same fullness that was
[47:38] already in the early church
[47:42] right right
[47:43] brother man came to restore jesus and
[47:45] elijah will restore all things
[47:48] he didn't say it would do greater than
[47:49] the beginning
[47:52] it's the restoration of the same power
[47:54] right there but it says over and over
[47:56] again same signs same wonders same
[47:58] manifestation same doctrine
[48:00] i preached what paul preached amen amen
[48:03] where do we get this idea where now
[48:05] we're all greater than all the other
[48:07] christians
[48:09] i don't think it's from the bible
[48:11] i can't find the bible
[48:13] right like that we i showed you when the
[48:15] brother said the young people they are
[48:16] the greatest young people there ever was
[48:20] they're driving around bmws and
[48:22] bentley's and you know
[48:24] they never had to they never missed one
[48:25] meal
[48:27] what about sister beatrice who she's
[48:29] probably missed some meals have you ever
[48:30] missed a meal sister because you were
[48:31] poor
[48:32] never okay but you had to pray for every
[48:34] meal didn't you there were some times
[48:36] you told me you there were some times
[48:37] you didn't know if you'd have a meal
[48:40] and all these young people they have new
[48:41] shoes and new clothes
[48:43] air conditioning
[48:46] they can fly in plains and what about
[48:48] those soldiers like stephen who gave
[48:50] their life as a martyr as a young man
[48:53] hallelujah
[48:56] see i think just sometimes people make
[48:57] statements and they don't take it back
[48:59] to the word what is that that's pride
[49:01] but we have to humble ourselves and take
[49:03] everything we believe back to the bible
[49:06] amen
[49:08] i can't find where the brotherhood said
[49:09] it's greater
[49:11] where he said thus say the lord we're
[49:13] greater than everybody else i just can't
[49:14] find that i think that's a product of
[49:17] pride anointing preachers
[49:20] hallelujah
[49:22] now the second thing is there's less
[49:24] believers today than there ever was
[49:28] because jesus said i have to shorten the
[49:30] days that some might be saved
[49:33] remember that in scripture
[49:35] and brother brother tells us it's a
[49:37] pyramid thing
[49:38] right
[49:39] there's fewer fewer people being saved
[49:41] all the time but then the capstone is
[49:43] going to come down it's going to sit
[49:44] perfectly on the word bride amen
[49:47] hallelujah
[49:49] so it doesn't mean more speaking of the
[49:51] word
[49:53] it can't mean more
[49:55] well then it would have to mean greater
[49:57] that have to mean the the the miracles
[49:59] of today are greater than the miracles
[50:01] of the bible
[50:03] now that's up for debate i don't know
[50:04] about that
[50:05] but just read the book of acts see what
[50:06] you think
[50:10] peter out of prison
[50:12] with an angel escort
[50:15] hallelujah
[50:17] amen
[50:20] paul on the island of melita everybody's
[50:22] healed on the island molina praise god
[50:24] everybody
[50:26] churches start up every city he goes to
[50:28] amen my goodness
[50:30] hallelujah
[50:34] god shakes an entire prison and all the
[50:37] prisoners are free
[50:40] but then the the jailer gets saved and
[50:42] this whole house gets baptized amen
[50:47] most of these message preachers they
[50:48] never even went to a jail not even to
[50:49] visit somebody
[50:51] right let alone be arrested for
[50:53] preaching the gospel
[50:55] i'm talking about american preachers
[50:57] and they're the ones saying they're the
[50:59] greatest ones
[51:01] that doesn't match to me i can't see
[51:02] that in the scripture
[51:04] nor do i see the same character of jesus
[51:06] christ
[51:07] the humility of jesus christ in today's
[51:09] preachers that exalt themselves as the
[51:10] greatest ever
[51:12] and i showed it to you this was this
[51:13] year this year
[51:15] and other years they're saying they're
[51:16] the greatest christians there was the
[51:18] greatest preachers thereof
[51:21] we ought to be saying how little we are
[51:23] brother said the way to be great is to
[51:25] humble yourself amen
[51:27] doesn't the bible say that yeah
[51:30] the greatest among you are not the ones
[51:32] that call themselves the greatest the
[51:34] greatest among you are the servants
[51:36] the ones that won't say they're the
[51:38] greatest ones
[51:39] hallelujah amen
[51:45] see i think they're using human
[51:46] reasoning to say if it's the darkest
[51:49] hour then the light must be the
[51:50] brightest well now that's true light
[51:51] does shine the brightness and darkness
[51:53] but it's the same light from the same
[51:55] candlesticks in revelation chapter one
[51:59] it's not a different light brother man
[52:00] tells us that plainly amen all seven of
[52:03] those wicks go back to one fountain one
[52:06] vessel one reservoir one reservoir of
[52:08] the same oil amen amen
[52:10] hallelujah now we're getting some church
[52:12] aid doctrine here
[52:13] hallelujah it's not a different license
[52:16] of interest it's the same light
[52:18] hallelujah
[52:22] and just to help these people
[52:23] why aren't they saying what the tapes
[52:25] say the tapes say third tier was the
[52:27] darkest not our day
[52:31] all right so i'm just going to put it
[52:32] out there the tapes say third tier was
[52:34] the darkest of any age because it was
[52:36] called the dark age
[52:40] why are we saying what the tapes say oh
[52:42] because we've got our own agenda
[52:44] we want everyone to think we're the
[52:46] greatest of all time see you get god god
[52:49] knows this when god will bless so many
[52:51] people with so many great miracles and
[52:52] signs but if they're not careful pride
[52:54] will jump on them right away if they
[52:55] don't humble themselves
[52:56] we saw that with gideon
[52:58] if people don't humble themselves right
[53:00] after a great miracle they'll get
[53:02] exalted and they'll start exalting
[53:03] themselves
[53:05] and that's when they're on their they're
[53:06] wrote down brother random says
[53:08] to a fall not to being lost i'm not i'm
[53:11] not saying these brothers are lost
[53:12] but i'm saying they're going to fall if
[53:14] you exalt yourself the bible says if you
[53:16] humble yourself you'll be amazed i'm
[53:18] sorry you exalt you i'm sorry if you
[53:20] exalted yourself you'll be obeyed sorry
[53:21] keep switching sometimes
[53:25] now i want to say this to it i think i
[53:26] was talking about ray about this it's
[53:28] possible brother van was the greatest
[53:29] new testament prophet outside of christ
[53:34] since john the baptist was the greatest
[53:35] old testament
[53:37] but again
[53:38] jesus never told us who was the greatest
[53:42] and only jesus will say that
[53:45] when the father tells them
[53:48] so people today are saying brother
[53:49] adam's the greatest well then they're
[53:50] either saying the father told them
[53:52] or they're lying about it
[53:55] if the father told them then they got
[53:56] thus said the lord then they better say
[53:57] they'll say to the lord about it
[54:00] because even jesus wouldn't say who's
[54:01] sitting on his right and left hand
[54:04] is that right
[54:08] and remember church paul's gospel is the
[54:10] judgment standard for all believers
[54:12] including brother brandon
[54:14] including martin luther john wesley
[54:16] peter james john all the saints amen
[54:19] whose standard is it pulse is the
[54:21] standard of judgment
[54:26] remember brother graham's son joseph
[54:28] even said brother graham was the
[54:29] greatest prophet of all time and he
[54:31] never said except for jesus i'll bring
[54:33] it to you right here here's the exact
[54:34] it's a screen shot
[54:36] on august of 21 august 1st of 2020 god
[54:40] has always provided a way for each age
[54:41] this is still on their website you just
[54:42] gotta go type it in you can search their
[54:43] entire website all of his blog posts he
[54:46] never says except for jesus
[54:51] why do you say except for jesus
[54:52] because he's blinded by his spirit
[54:56] he's blinded
[54:58] church when i read this the first time i
[55:00] read it it's like i got cut to the heart
[55:01] like
[55:02] what
[55:03] he didn't say except for jesus
[55:09] he says he never changed his program or
[55:11] his way of doing things for he's the
[55:12] same yesterday today and forever god has
[55:14] always been a prophet lead his people
[55:15] and today he said the greatest prophet
[55:17] of all time william branham to lead his
[55:19] bride
[55:21] the greatest prophet of all time
[55:27] the greatest of all time he didn't say
[55:30] outside of jesus
[55:31] so you got to watch people's words
[55:34] listen to what they really say i i read
[55:36] that whole article he never said except
[55:38] for jesus throughout the whole article
[55:40] it's brother brandon brother branham
[55:41] it's that statue daniel it's a statue of
[55:43] daniel in the days of it shadrach
[55:46] meshach and abednego amen trying to make
[55:48] a holy man god
[55:52] now we love brother brad we believe he
[55:53] was a prophet of god malachi 4 5-6 luke
[55:56] 17 30. but now they're saying what's not
[55:59] on the tape the people that say say what
[56:00] the tax say are not saying what the
[56:02] tapes say
[56:03] hallelujah know what the bible says
[56:06] that's right amen
[56:09] the program said you got the holy ghost
[56:10] it will point you everywhere wherever
[56:12] points you he said every time it will
[56:14] point you to the scripture
[56:16] it won't point you to branham tabernacle
[56:18] no don't we thank god for tabernacle
[56:20] what it meant you know for us
[56:22] don't point you to me it won't point you
[56:24] to anyone except jesus christ hallelujah
[56:27] amen
[56:30] that's right
[56:36] and i'm not a tape person
[56:40] i'm a holy ghost filled christian
[56:42] i listen to the tapes i listened to the
[56:43] pride yesterday i listen tapes but i'm
[56:45] not a tape person
[56:46] i'm a holy ghost-filled saint
[56:49] you can call me a bible person you can
[56:51] call me a holy ghost person but i'm not
[56:52] a gay person i don't i do not worship
[56:55] tapes
[56:56] hallelujah call me a holy ghostbuild
[56:57] saint
[56:58] amen
[57:00] see they're identifying themselves with
[57:02] tapes
[57:04] yes
[57:05] remember that brother even said the
[57:06] tapes are the token
[57:09] he said if you go to the tape church you
[57:10] automatically got the token that's a lie
[57:12] from hell
[57:14] the tapes are not the token the holy
[57:16] spirit is the token it's always been it
[57:19] forever will be the token the seal the
[57:21] sign the mark that you are sealed to the
[57:24] day of your redemption hallelujah
[57:27] show me where that's on the tape it's
[57:28] not on the tape they're pridefully
[57:30] exalting they're on false interpretation
[57:32] of the tapes
[57:37] now church the reason i'm preaching this
[57:38] so hard is because in laodicea it's
[57:40] really easy i can i could show you all
[57:42] through the bible the time when people
[57:44] get prideful is when they're so blessed
[57:45] and they have so many blessings
[57:47] maybe that's why god's letting inflation
[57:48] hit so hard so it keeps us humble
[57:51] and the church said
[57:56] god's not letting us get too comfortable
[57:58] is he
[58:01] but see if we're not careful we'll get
[58:03] so prideful
[58:04] remember like we talked about yesterday
[58:06] obviously you can understand all
[58:07] mysteries
[58:08] and not have charity
[58:10] yeah you can you can intellectually
[58:11] understand okay i see these scriptures
[58:13] point to the godhead as one person i can
[58:14] see these scriptures shot bush trump
[58:16] point to the rapture pre-tribulation
[58:18] rapture you can see these mysteries
[58:20] revealed
[58:21] but if you don't have charity
[58:24] hallelujah the bible says charity
[58:27] rejoices in the truth
[58:29] charity does not rejoice in iniquity
[58:31] praise god what is this that's iniquity
[58:33] amen you know better but you still do it
[58:37] you still exhaust a man above jesus
[58:38] christ
[58:39] because he didn't say yeah except for
[58:41] jesus christ
[58:44] it says every word on the tape is thus
[58:46] said lord i've got emails back i've got
[58:47] letters to prove it i can joke if you
[58:49] want
[58:53] now here's where bob ramos says we are
[58:55] the children of light but the world is
[58:56] in darkness now the church has been
[58:57] through the darkest age it went through
[59:00] the dark ages
[59:01] so according to brother brown the
[59:03] darkest age ever was was already passed
[59:07] why aren't you saying what the tapes say
[59:09] you love the tape so much
[59:10] oh because that doesn't fit my false
[59:12] doctrines
[59:14] of course
[59:16] the same people that say what the tapes
[59:17] say don't say what the tapes say
[59:19] right
[59:21] the same people that say you can't
[59:22] correct the prophet are the ones
[59:23] correcting the prophet
[59:26] hallelujah
[59:27] amen
[59:29] but they can't see it because they're
[59:30] blind
[59:31] and the spirit of pride will not say i
[59:34] repent
[59:35] amen right
[59:40] even the church age book he said now
[59:41] we've already said this is called the
[59:42] dark age because it was indeed the
[59:44] darkest spirit of all not some all
[59:47] history
[59:48] and he gives the reasons the pope the
[59:50] rise of the pope the inquisition uh the
[59:52] poor the pornocracy of the rule of
[59:54] harlots with the papacy
[59:57] they had thousands of harlots following
[1:00:00] the catholic churches in those days
[1:00:03] it's a document
[1:00:05] i've wrote it i've read about it in my
[1:00:06] book it's documented
[1:00:10] now what's true is our age is the most
[1:00:13] deceptive of all time
[1:00:15] so that means church we need a real holy
[1:00:16] ghost spirit of discernment
[1:00:18] in this day to judge right from wrong
[1:00:22] we need a strong anointing of the holy
[1:00:24] ghost for discernment and thank god we
[1:00:27] got it it's the word of god
[1:00:30] because the word of god is the sword
[1:00:31] it's a discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:00:33] intents of the heart amen
[1:00:37] god this evil age he said matthew 24 is
[1:00:39] the most deceiving age of all ages
[1:00:41] so it's not the darkest now
[1:00:44] but it is the most deceiving of all ages
[1:00:49] there's never been an age so deceptive
[1:00:50] as this age false prophets will rise and
[1:00:52] show signs and winners if it possible to
[1:00:54] deceive the very elective or possible
[1:00:57] now is this scriptural yes the bible
[1:00:59] does say paul said evil seducers will
[1:01:01] last worse and worse and worse they only
[1:01:05] get more deceptive as time goes on
[1:01:09] and they are deceiving others while they
[1:01:10] themselves are deceived
[1:01:15] but as far as i can find by the
[1:01:16] scripture
[1:01:17] we are receiving the restoration of the
[1:01:19] same revelation
[1:01:21] amen praise god
[1:01:26] i don't see how it's greater but i see
[1:01:28] how it's the same restoration amen
[1:01:31] hallelujah
[1:01:33] now what about this jesus talk about the
[1:01:34] enzyme what about this they're saying
[1:01:36] we're the greatest we got the most word
[1:01:38] in our mouth we got we got the most
[1:01:39] power than ever jesus says am i going to
[1:01:41] find faith over the earth when i return
[1:01:43] right
[1:01:44] they're bragging about how great we are
[1:01:46] how great we are and jesus says when i
[1:01:48] return
[1:01:49] he says shall i find faith it'll be such
[1:01:51] a small number
[1:01:53] the believers will be so small it'll be
[1:01:55] so hard to find real faith real
[1:01:57] revelation of the will of god
[1:01:59] real assurance in the churches and this
[1:02:01] is about prayer amen this is about
[1:02:03] prayer and a church that will keep
[1:02:04] asking and knocking and won't give up
[1:02:07] and will have an abrahamic faith and
[1:02:08] keep praying for year after year after
[1:02:11] year and will not stagger at the promise
[1:02:13] of god through unbelief amen
[1:02:19] let's preach hallelujah the mic falls
[1:02:20] off
[1:02:27] now there has to be few because god
[1:02:28] jesus has to know when there's no more
[1:02:30] gentiles that will take the baptism the
[1:02:32] holy ghost then he'll it'll cut off that
[1:02:34] holy branch rapture him up to heaven and
[1:02:36] he'll graft back in uh i'm sorry the
[1:02:38] wild it'll cut off the wild branch and
[1:02:40] grab back in that jewish branch that
[1:02:42] holy branch
[1:02:43] praise god
[1:02:46] there's gotta be fewer fewer fewer fewer
[1:02:48] fewer
[1:02:50] and remember church have you listened
[1:02:51] have you listened to leo i've been
[1:02:52] listening to it for a while but i
[1:02:53] remember i listened to a couple quotes
[1:02:54] somewhere uh from let the the laodicean
[1:02:57] church age 1960 brother says jesus did
[1:02:59] not say one good thing about this church
[1:03:01] age that's right
[1:03:04] he didn't say you have the greatest
[1:03:05] power
[1:03:06] you'll be the greatest mothers ever
[1:03:08] you'll be the greatest preachers of all
[1:03:10] time
[1:03:12] he didn't say that
[1:03:16] he said the brother man says the burden
[1:03:18] of this age is repent
[1:03:21] repent
[1:03:22] and get on fire for jesus amen
[1:03:27] it's true see
[1:03:31] we started at 10 right now okay i'm
[1:03:33] doing good by god's grace here's another
[1:03:35] one on church i feel some of these
[1:03:36] things are right but i feel like down
[1:03:38] here i'll show you why i feel like this
[1:03:40] may have been uh brother vale's
[1:03:42] conviction
[1:03:45] now on the he's talking about the seven
[1:03:47] church age messenger on the basis of
[1:03:49] human behavior alone anyone knows that
[1:03:51] where there are many people there's even
[1:03:53] divided
[1:03:55] opinion on lesser points of a major
[1:03:56] doctrine than that which they all hold
[1:03:58] together who then will have the power of
[1:04:00] infallibility which is to be restored in
[1:04:03] this last age for this age is going to
[1:04:05] go back to manifesting the pure word
[1:04:07] bride okay so he says there's going to
[1:04:08] be all these
[1:04:10] believers or all these doctrines who has
[1:04:12] the power of infallibility
[1:04:14] now church
[1:04:16] jeffersonville used this to say brother
[1:04:17] graham's every word was infallible
[1:04:21] did you know that this is the quote
[1:04:23] brother joseph sent to me
[1:04:25] he's in he's infallible he has the power
[1:04:28] of infallibility but this you
[1:04:30] misunderstood the quote
[1:04:32] a prophet is only infallible when they
[1:04:33] say thus save the lord right amen praise
[1:04:36] god
[1:04:38] hallelujah
[1:04:41] so see how
[1:04:43] maybe brother mayor and i look i looked
[1:04:45] oh i'll get that eventually
[1:04:48] now he says
[1:04:48] he says i'll tell you will have the
[1:04:50] power of infallibility it'll be a
[1:04:52] prophet as thoroughly vindicated now
[1:04:53] listen or even more thoroughly
[1:04:55] vindicated that was any prophet in all
[1:04:57] ages
[1:04:58] from enoch to this day that again
[1:04:59] includes jesus and the church said
[1:05:02] i mean can you believe what i mean
[1:05:04] was brother vale missing something here
[1:05:06] i don't know
[1:05:08] all ages
[1:05:13] i love the church book but this is a
[1:05:14] quote i think
[1:05:16] i don't think it was very clear
[1:05:19] and this is why some people can exalt
[1:05:20] brother branham so high
[1:05:23] he's the power of infallibility he's
[1:05:25] greatest in all ages and all ages
[1:05:26] includes jesus age
[1:05:29] i just can't hardly i can already stop
[1:05:31] this stuff like the way people interpret
[1:05:33] some of these things
[1:05:35] true
[1:05:38] where's jesus in on this where is the
[1:05:40] the man who paid for all of our sins
[1:05:41] amen and it gives us any hope for the
[1:05:43] future amen where where is that holy
[1:05:45] land amen he's just forgotten about see
[1:05:48] it's just like the pharisees amen they
[1:05:50] don't welcome jesus they don't exalt
[1:05:52] jesus they don't put jesus first they
[1:05:54] don't wash jesus face but we should
[1:05:55] worship and love jesus put it first
[1:05:57] entertainment man
[1:05:59] hallelujah there's no one there's no one
[1:06:02] like jesus
[1:06:07] he should be at the forefront of every
[1:06:09] one of our thoughts hallelujah
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:13] how can they forget about this because
[1:06:15] jesus is not on their mind that's right
[1:06:17] but the rams not on their mind that's
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:20] that's true
[1:06:24] because this man will be of necessity
[1:06:26] have the capstone i believe that i
[1:06:28] believe have the ministry uh that's
[1:06:30] pointing us to jesus brother said i may
[1:06:32] not do it but this message will
[1:06:33] introduce jesus christ to the world i
[1:06:35] believe that all right it's the
[1:06:36] revelation amen the revelation but who's
[1:06:39] going to be preaching the bible ministry
[1:06:41] right who's going to be limited the
[1:06:42] saints the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:46] it just depends how you how you explain
[1:06:49] that but it has to be explained by the
[1:06:51] word the bible says the bible ministry
[1:06:53] brings us to perfection amen it brings
[1:06:56] us to a unity of the faith hallelujah
[1:06:58] and what is that you need to face that's
[1:07:00] the former ladder rain that's the
[1:07:01] rapture that's the time when we're all
[1:07:03] unified we're all purchased we're all
[1:07:05] caught up in the air at the last trump
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] oh my god thank god amen
[1:07:15] he won't need to speak for himself god
[1:07:16] will speak for him by the voice of the
[1:07:17] siren i believe that
[1:07:19] that part
[1:07:20] now what i don't agree with again
[1:07:21] brother
[1:07:22] the brother veil
[1:07:23] it seems like uses no scripture there's
[1:07:25] no thus saith the lord there's no
[1:07:26] matching quote for this in the church
[1:07:28] age series
[1:07:29] when brother graham preached in 1960
[1:07:32] like i when i preached years ago when i
[1:07:35] preached on the
[1:07:36] seven church ages i preached 120 sermons
[1:07:38] on the book of revelation right
[1:07:40] i would i would look at the sermon and
[1:07:41] then the church age book and i could
[1:07:42] follow okay i can see that thought i can
[1:07:44] see that thought here well here's a
[1:07:46] thought we don't see
[1:07:48] this is a thought that's not in his
[1:07:49] sermons from 1960.
[1:07:53] now here's what i think i think brother
[1:07:55] vale thought the rapture was going to
[1:07:56] happen
[1:07:57] because enoch didn't have to die
[1:08:00] enoch got to be raptured
[1:08:02] and i think brother bale thought brother
[1:08:04] branham was going to be raptured
[1:08:06] you know 7 church age messenger 7 from
[1:08:08] enoch right
[1:08:11] elijah right elijah elijah on the
[1:08:13] rapture
[1:08:14] brother have the spirit of elijah that's
[1:08:16] what i think i could be wrong
[1:08:20] what's he
[1:08:26] more thoroughly vindicated this i mean
[1:08:27] who could be more vindicated than enoch
[1:08:29] you know i said there's going to be a
[1:08:30] rapture there's going to be rapture and
[1:08:31] he went up in the rapture
[1:08:33] that's the best vindication that you
[1:08:34] were right amen
[1:08:36] he said you got rashford hallelujah
[1:08:39] so whether i preached about the rapture
[1:08:41] preached about the rapture it seems like
[1:08:42] brother vale thought well he's going to
[1:08:44] be more vindicated because the rapture
[1:08:45] is going to happen in his day
[1:08:46] before 77
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:51] which i just put that video out this
[1:08:52] week it's actually been a pretty uh
[1:08:54] pretty welsh worship well-shared videos
[1:08:56] which is encouraging
[1:08:58] i got numerous comments back thank you
[1:08:59] for clearing that up i needed light on
[1:09:01] this i've been enlightened by the holy
[1:09:02] spirit so thank god for that
[1:09:07] brother and said the word infallible one
[1:09:09] time in the church age series in 1960
[1:09:11] and he said the true church never
[1:09:12] changes attitude not to be ruled by some
[1:09:14] board of i don't know what you call them
[1:09:16] either cardinals bishops or popes
[1:09:17] invalid ones we believe there's only one
[1:09:21] infallible one he is our king
[1:09:24] did it say he's our tapes
[1:09:26] didn't say that
[1:09:27] he said he's our king he's jesus christ
[1:09:29] with us now in the form of the tapes
[1:09:32] in the form of the holy spirit god
[1:09:34] where's the end god in us amen
[1:09:37] living among us leading us and guiding
[1:09:39] us under the waters of life making
[1:09:40] himself known
[1:09:42] yes hallelujah
[1:09:44] showing as he did among those early
[1:09:46] saints and martyrs that he was the lord
[1:09:47] god of creation healing is sick raising
[1:09:49] that showing visions casting out devils
[1:09:51] it's true the only time you use the word
[1:09:53] invaluable when you're talking about the
[1:09:54] infallible one amen jesus christ
[1:09:58] hallelujah
[1:10:01] thank you lord
[1:10:02] glory to god
[1:10:03] here he plainly says
[1:10:06] that people were in michigan saying that
[1:10:08] they were set by brother branham that
[1:10:10] they should leave their wives and offer
[1:10:11] their spiritual mate in other words
[1:10:12] adultery and that brother graham was
[1:10:14] perfectly infallible he says that's what
[1:10:16] some of the awfulest things you've ever
[1:10:19] heard
[1:10:20] now how come
[1:10:21] everybody looks up to jeffersonville now
[1:10:23] and they're saying some of the awfulest
[1:10:25] things we've ever heard the tapes are
[1:10:27] infallible yes every word is thus saith
[1:10:29] the lord
[1:10:30] how come everybody admires them and
[1:10:32] adores them it's because they don't have
[1:10:33] the holy spirit all right because if you
[1:10:35] have the holy spirit it guides you into
[1:10:37] all truth
[1:10:39] and you'll have a little buzzer that
[1:10:40] will protect your life from
[1:10:43] that little idolatry buzzes off amen
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:46] i won't worship brother brown i won't
[1:10:48] worship joseph i won't worship him to
[1:10:49] have an uncle i will worship my pastor
[1:10:52] i won't worship anybody i only worship
[1:10:54] the infallible one the lord jesus
[1:10:56] christ that's right
[1:10:59] then he's called it tommy rod you know
[1:11:01] this church don't stand for tommy rot
[1:11:02] like that why do they stand for now

[1:11:09] stand for that
[1:11:11] i might as well say it tommy rob them
[1:11:13] call themselves the greatest of all time
[1:11:15] with no authority from heaven
[1:11:17] with no thus saith the lord
[1:11:19] how can they know but yet jesus didn't
[1:11:20] know
[1:11:22] that they're the greatest of all time
[1:11:29] church we got to know where we stand
[1:11:30] remember i was telling you it's going to
[1:11:32] be so close
[1:11:33] it might deceive the very elective or
[1:11:34] apostle yeah but it won't deceive us by
[1:11:36] god's grace amen amen
[1:11:39] because when we when we have when we
[1:11:40] have an issue when we have a question
[1:11:41] what do we do we go down to pray

[1:11:51] person this group help me to see their
[1:11:52] fruits are they corrupt fruits or good
[1:11:54] fruits amen
[1:11:56] and then you wait on the lord like i
[1:11:58] told you you might wait six weeks buddy
[1:12:00] you've been waiting on the lord until
[1:12:01] god answers and when god answers you'll
[1:12:03] know it'll be vindicated god will speak
[1:12:06] and you'll know it and the truth will
[1:12:07] prevail
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:12] glory
[1:12:13] now what i found is that people eat now
[1:12:15] now grandchildren won't they won't they
[1:12:17] won't write me back
[1:12:18] and these ones that were attacking me on
[1:12:20] youtube now they uh they delete all
[1:12:22] their comments and they don't contact me
[1:12:23] anymore
[1:12:24] they just leave me alone well that's
[1:12:25] fine i'd rather be alone with jesus
[1:12:27] praise god
[1:12:28] then all these uh all these uh i don't
[1:12:31] know i don't know what to say i don't
[1:12:32] know i should say doubters let me just
[1:12:33] say that
[1:12:34] doubting the true word of god
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:38] that's fine as long as i got fellowship
[1:12:40] with jesus just like brother braham as
[1:12:41] long as the never failing friends of
[1:12:43] jesus christ is always with me i'll be
[1:12:45] happy praise god
[1:12:46] we'll be happy with the presence of
[1:12:48] jesus christ but we don't want to be
[1:12:51] deceived thinking we have christ's
[1:12:52] presence when we when it's a spirit of
[1:12:53] pride in all reality
[1:12:56] we don't want to be deceived with a
[1:12:57] cursed spirit of pride
[1:13:00] thinking where something went actually
[1:13:02] were nothing
[1:13:06] here in the church book brother says it
[1:13:08] plain he's talking about the last day
[1:13:09] prophet messenger that's his ministry
[1:13:12] there's going to be many people mistake
[1:13:13] him for the lord
[1:13:16] jesus there'll be a spirit in the world
[1:13:19] that will seduce some and make them
[1:13:20] believe this that brother brahma is
[1:13:21] equal to jesus that's exactly what
[1:13:23] they're doing
[1:13:24] every word on the table is thus of the
[1:13:25] lord
[1:13:26] but don't you believe it he's not jesus
[1:13:28] christ he's not the son of god he's one
[1:13:30] of the brethren a prophet a messenger a
[1:13:32] servant of god he needs no greater honor
[1:13:34] bestowed upon him than that which john
[1:13:36] received when he was the voice that
[1:13:37] cried i am not he who's coming after me
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:41] so it's clear people exalt brother to
[1:13:43] infallibility i've got the i got the
[1:13:45] letters i've got the emails
[1:13:47] i got the websites i got the screen
[1:13:49] shots from their website yeah
[1:13:52] i've got videos copies of it too
[1:13:55] see jesus honored john the baptist so
[1:13:58] only jesus must honor the one who is the
[1:14:00] greatest in the new testament all right
[1:14:02] not another man who's adding to the word
[1:14:04] of god
[1:14:06] taking away from ephesians chapter four
[1:14:09] that's not who's going to do it it's
[1:14:10] going to be god amen
[1:14:14] because if god did it the first time let
[1:14:16] me tell you guys the second time amen
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] it's true
[1:14:22] hallelujah
[1:14:25] now let's get back to us here okay
[1:14:28] praise god
[1:14:29] now church that's helpful for us though
[1:14:30] too because that's the spirit sweeping
[1:14:32] the message like i told you not only is
[1:14:34] it on jeffersonville it's getting on the
[1:14:35] five fold preachers because now they're
[1:14:36] saying they're the greatest of all time
[1:14:38] and that influences you
[1:14:40] right sometimes if we listen to them i
[1:14:42] enjoy some of their ministries too but
[1:14:43] something's got wrong when they start
[1:14:44] calling themselves the greatest of all
[1:14:46] time
[1:14:47] something's wrong with that
[1:14:49] i showed you the videos last or two two
[1:14:50] weeks ago i'll show you the videos
[1:14:53] i told cam i'll share to his i'll show
[1:14:55] it to his church if he wants to see it
[1:14:57] so when we go down there lord willing we
[1:14:58] may we we may show it there i don't know
[1:15:01] the lord in this summer i'm going to
[1:15:02] write letters to each of those preachers
[1:15:04] and try to humbly ask
[1:15:07] is this right do you feel this is the
[1:15:08] holy spirit
[1:15:13] praise god
[1:15:14] amen church should we fear any man or
[1:15:16] should we fear god
[1:15:18] fear god
[1:15:21] doesn't the bible say if someone's if
[1:15:22] you see your brother overtaking a fault
[1:15:24] you that are what spiritual
[1:15:27] should go to them with pride no go to
[1:15:29] them in meekness
[1:15:31] so that spirit doesn't get on you amen
[1:15:35] see that
[1:15:36] galatians chapter six verse one and two
[1:15:38] yeah
[1:15:39] now church now here's where it comes
[1:15:41] down to us
[1:15:42] pride will happen
[1:15:44] when we do not see the need to pray and
[1:15:46] see god anymore that's why church you
[1:15:48] know you hear me in different preachers
[1:15:49] we hammer on you gotta have a prayer
[1:15:50] life you've got to read your bible
[1:15:52] you've got to keep seeking god
[1:15:55] because these people have got to the
[1:15:56] spot they don't see god anymore
[1:15:59] they don't
[1:16:00] the bible says the wickedness pride does
[1:16:02] persecute the poor they don't care about
[1:16:04] the poor they just want to get more
[1:16:05] money they want to stay in their little
[1:16:06] bubble
[1:16:07] they want their ties
[1:16:09] that's what they want
[1:16:12] let them be taking the devices that they
[1:16:13] have imagined for the wicked boasts of
[1:16:15] his heart's desire and blesseth the
[1:16:18] covetous whom the lord abhorred
[1:16:22] the wicked through the pride of his
[1:16:24] covenants will not seek after god god is
[1:16:27] not in all his thoughts that's why i
[1:16:29] showed those quotes these people will
[1:16:30] say quotes and god jesus ain't even in
[1:16:32] there how can jesus not be in there
[1:16:34] because the bible said god is not in all
[1:16:36] the thoughts of the prideful
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:40] this should remind us of king uzziah for
[1:16:42] 62 years he was faithful to god
[1:16:45] by the end of his life he got so
[1:16:46] prideful in his great kingdom what did
[1:16:48] he do he stopped seeking god yeah he
[1:16:51] stopped asking for god's will
[1:16:53] see he prospered as long as he sought
[1:16:56] the lord
[1:16:58] see church like i said when you feel
[1:17:00] like i don't need to come to church to
[1:17:01] pray anymore i don't need to seek god i
[1:17:03] don't need to study my bible anymore i
[1:17:05] don't even listen to tapes anymore when
[1:17:06] you get to that spot that's a sad spot
[1:17:08] to be in
[1:17:10] that's a spot of pride
[1:17:11] thinking you know it all we don't know
[1:17:14] it all right and gotta let things happen
[1:17:16] opposite to what we say just to prove we
[1:17:18] don't know it all
[1:17:20] like he's doing now
[1:17:21] yeah like i showed you that brother said
[1:17:23] in march he said the rapture is just
[1:17:24] days away and then he said it's just
[1:17:26] hours away here we are two months later
[1:17:28] we're more than two months later where's
[1:17:29] the rapture
[1:17:31] and that message preacher influences
[1:17:33] thousands of preachers
[1:17:35] where is it
[1:17:37] it's just hours away
[1:17:40] see
[1:17:42] at some point they stop seeking the real
[1:17:44] mind of god
[1:17:46] and they just i'll say like this they
[1:17:47] just study to pump the crowd up
[1:17:50] i listen to some of these guys it's all
[1:17:52] about miracles it's all about americans
[1:17:53] because they want to see the power of
[1:17:54] god it's all about the anointing but we
[1:17:56] know there's more than anointing praise
[1:17:58] god
[1:17:59] we need to well we need anointing for
[1:18:00] miracles we also need anointing for true
[1:18:02] doctrine praise god amen
[1:18:06] there's a real christian that's both you
[1:18:07] could have the right spirit and the
[1:18:09] right doctrine that's right amen
[1:18:12] but see when uzziah was what strong his
[1:18:14] heart was lifted up to his destruction
[1:18:17] and he tried to go into the role of a
[1:18:19] priest
[1:18:21] when did it happen when he was strong
[1:18:23] when it happened when i had everything i
[1:18:25] need yeah yeah
[1:18:28] can i say this sometimes church is a
[1:18:29] blessing you don't have enough money
[1:18:31] right amen
[1:18:33] sometimes it's a blessing you don't have
[1:18:34] everything you want that's
[1:18:39] not because i know it's right to say but
[1:18:40] it's true
[1:18:41] it's a blessing amen
[1:18:44] to have needs in our lives yes
[1:18:48] true because then we just get oh look
[1:18:49] what i've done look oh look where i am
[1:18:51] look look how far i've come it's the
[1:18:54] only god that brought you this far right
[1:18:56] that's right
[1:18:57] that's true
[1:18:59] god always changes the prideful and i'm
[1:19:01] just going to use joe biden as an
[1:19:02] example
[1:19:03] the bible says
[1:19:05] oh love the lord all you sayings for the
[1:19:06] lord preserveth the faithful oh
[1:19:08] plentiful and plentifully rewardeth the
[1:19:10] proud doer
[1:19:13] just look at the president he's got a
[1:19:14] laptop scandal with his son
[1:19:17] his record low approval
[1:19:20] even catholics are preaching against him
[1:19:21] i've got videos of catholics preaching
[1:19:23] against a catholic president yeah
[1:19:26] he's got worldwide embarrassment due to
[1:19:27] dementia
[1:19:29] obama visited the white house a few
[1:19:30] weeks ago and everybody was gathering
[1:19:32] around him or
[1:19:33] obama and the president is standing
[1:19:35] there wandering around he just kind of
[1:19:36] wandered around wanting to be a part of
[1:19:38] that
[1:19:41] he's just being he's just being rejected
[1:19:42] by everybody
[1:19:44] all these democrats don't want him to
[1:19:46] come
[1:19:47] to their campaigns
[1:19:51] right and this this man even said years
[1:19:52] ago he was a prostitute for the
[1:19:54] businesses of america
[1:19:56] yeah i've got the video i've got it
[1:19:59] even says that
[1:20:02] he fought against roe v wade in the 80s
[1:20:04] and now he's for all the death of these
[1:20:06] children
[1:20:07] see anyone that exalts himself god will
[1:20:10] humble them praise god
[1:20:13] that's just one example i just gave you
[1:20:14] some other bible examples too moses
[1:20:17] go in the promised land he didn't get to
[1:20:19] go because he exalted himself
[1:20:23] so what was what must we be i'll try to
[1:20:25] close to this one okay we must be
[1:20:26] clothed in humility
[1:20:33] the lexicon says the word clothed is was
[1:20:36] a slave garment
[1:20:39] there was nobody lower than a slave
[1:20:43] in jesus day
[1:20:44] no one was low except i say like this
[1:20:47] except jesus
[1:20:50] jesus became the lowest of the lord
[1:20:53] nobody humbled themselves like jesus
[1:20:56] peter said submit yourselves unto the
[1:20:58] elder yay all you be subject one to
[1:20:59] another and be clothed with humility for
[1:21:02] god resists the proud
[1:21:04] but gives grace to the humble
[1:21:08] now church your exaltation i think i
[1:21:10] said this
[1:21:11] said this last week it might come in
[1:21:13] this life or might come in the next
[1:21:15] yeah but either way it's going to come
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:18] the woman who humbered himself or
[1:21:20] humbled herself and prepared jesus for
[1:21:22] burial burial
[1:21:23] jesus said preachers would always
[1:21:25] mention her and they do her exaltation
[1:21:28] came later
[1:21:30] yeah
[1:21:31] for two thousand years preachers have
[1:21:32] preached about this woman that washed
[1:21:34] jesus fear anointed jesus speaking
[1:21:35] before it's burial
[1:21:37] what a testimony what is what an
[1:21:39] exaltation that she has
[1:21:42] stephen's exaltation took place right at
[1:21:44] his death because he saw a vision amen
[1:21:46] he saw he said lord jesus received my
[1:21:48] spirit praise god
[1:21:51] and now of course he has the martyr's
[1:21:52] crown brother graham tells us the
[1:21:54] martyrs crowned in heaven forever
[1:21:55] exalted as a saint of god
[1:22:00] jesus was not exalted during life he was
[1:22:02] exalted after death
[1:22:04] when he was raised from the dead
[1:22:06] and now he's exhausted so high
[1:22:08] hallelujah he went to the lower steps of
[1:22:09] the hell and god he humbled himself and
[1:22:11] god exalted him to the highest place so
[1:22:13] brother ed said even heaven's gotta look
[1:22:15] up to jesus amen
[1:22:17] praise god amen
[1:22:19] that great exaltation of the son of god
[1:22:22] amen what about mordecai
[1:22:24] he was exalted in this life but also in
[1:22:27] the next life
[1:22:30] see church we don't know when our
[1:22:31] exaltation is going to come but the main
[1:22:33] thing is do is humble yourself
[1:22:36] humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[1:22:38] of god
[1:22:39] and he'll exalt us in due season amen
[1:22:45] what does clothe mean it's a
[1:22:48] white scarf or apron of slaves which was
[1:22:50] fastened to the belt of the best and
[1:22:52] distinguished slaves
[1:22:54] from free men
[1:22:57] the belt of the vest
[1:23:00] hence peter says gird yourselves with
[1:23:02] humility
[1:23:03] with your servile garb
[1:23:06] put on your slave clothes in other words
[1:23:10] also this refers to the overalls which
[1:23:11] slave war to keep clean while working
[1:23:13] and exceeding humble reward so church

[1:25:43] with me he's going to wash all of me
[1:25:44] jesus what's going on man
[1:25:46] because i don't want to part with you
[1:25:47] even though he's going to deny it if you

[1:25:51] on his last night on earth he humbled
[1:25:53] himself

[1:25:58] those that have followed me how can i
[1:26:00] inspire them one last time
[1:26:03] before i'm taken away from them
[1:26:05] what do you do you put on garments of a
[1:26:07] circle
