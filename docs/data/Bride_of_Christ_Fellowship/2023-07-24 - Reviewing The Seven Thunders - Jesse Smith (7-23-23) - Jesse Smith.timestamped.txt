[0:01] and the Lord shall be safe
[0:13] [Music]
[0:41] my soul
[0:49] [Applause]
[0:53] Hallelujah It Is Well with our Souls
[0:55] praise God let's take our Bibles and
[0:56] we'll stand let's go to Revelation
[0:58] chapter 8. as I said I'd like to preach
[1:01] on the seven Thunders
[1:04] teach on it by God's grace
[1:07] and we're not doing this live today I'm
[1:09] just recording the audio and then I will
[1:12] post it either tonight or tomorrow
[1:15] on the YouTube channel
[1:17] as I said on Wednesday you know
[1:19] I forgot how much static is on there and
[1:22] so bag and I need to meet at some point
[1:24] and we'll do that by God's grace and try
[1:26] to get the static off there
[1:29] um I feel like this might be the best
[1:31] recording we can get by God's grace
[1:34] Revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:39] of course we'll start with the seventh
[1:40] seal and then look at the seven Thunders
[1:44] by the grace of the Lord
[1:46] so I had two questions on it this week
[1:48] and I appreciate the questions and I
[1:50] thought it was uh you know also inspired
[1:51] I put out a video last week about the
[1:54] supernatural cloud from Arizona in 1963
[1:57] so I just kind of felt it was kind of
[2:00] Timely
[2:01] I had a different few sermons kind of
[2:04] preparing and yesterday like I said with
[2:07] music and other things but I thought I
[2:08] would just go ahead and preach this
[2:09] today
[2:10] uh since we had Emma back and
[2:14] um
[2:15] I thought it'd be a help To Us by God's
[2:17] grace it's kind of like a review from
[2:18] when I preached it back in March 2022 so
[2:21] I'll just kind of review some of that
[2:23] and added a couple new visuals so
[2:25] Revelation chapter 8 verse one
[2:29] of course this is the only verse on the
[2:31] seventh seal brother Brown tells us
[2:32] there's no symbols
[2:34] and there are no symbols there's no
[2:35] horse riders there's no beasts or
[2:38] anything like that all's we're told is
[2:40] that there's silence
[2:43] in heaven
[2:44] and of course we know the only reason
[2:45] that could be is if Jesus left heaven
[2:48] because all the cherubim constantly
[2:51] saying holy holy holy to Jesus and then
[2:53] all this heavenly worship stops the only
[2:56] reason it would stop is if Jesus left
[2:59] so let's read verse one together ready
[3:01] one two three and when he had opened the
[3:04] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[3:07] about the space of half an hour let's go
[3:11] to Revelation chapter 10.
[3:14] we'll read verse
[3:17] three
[3:19] I'm just going to try to conserve time
[3:20] here by God's grace
[3:24] let's read verse three Revelation 10
[3:26] verse three let's read that on three one
[3:28] two three and cried with a loud voice as
[3:31] when a lion roarth and when he had cried
[3:35] seven Thunders uttered their voices amen
[3:38] let's have a one more word of prayer
[3:40] here I just I need God's grace I'm sure
[3:42] you do too I'd like to present this as
[3:45] simple as possible
[3:46] and I for those who have questions I
[3:48] love the questions those are wonderful
[3:49] questions and I just would pray that the
[3:52] Holy Spirit would dissolve all doubts
[3:53] and just give us understanding I know
[3:56] some of these things Saints took me
[3:58] years to understand
[4:00] um and that's fine because that's the
[4:01] that's the timing of God
[4:03] so let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[4:05] you again for today Lord God and we're
[4:07] humble to be in your presence It Is Well
[4:08] with our souls today Lord God hallelujah
[4:12] how we look forward to that one day Lord
[4:13] when our faith will become sight
[4:16] I believe Peter said that in the
[4:18] scripture
[4:18] he said having not seen but you love and
[4:22] Lord that's how it is Lord we haven't
[4:24] seen your physical body in a glorified
[4:25] condition but we love you
[4:28] we felt your spirit Lord God hallelujah
[4:30] we've seen your spirit with spiritual
[4:33] eyes do wonderful things in our lives
[4:35] Lord God so we're aware of your presence
[4:37] today Lord God I ask that the great Holy
[4:39] Spirit Lord God would just take control
[4:41] Lord God and just give understanding
[4:43] Lord and I pray Lord I could be used as
[4:46] your vessel Lord again to look at this
[4:48] topic lord it's an important topic it's
[4:50] a it's a it's a modern event Lord that
[4:53] we look at fulfilled by prophecy in this
[4:56] day Lord God so we thank you for your
[4:58] blessings we thank you what for what
[5:00] you've done Lord and what you are doing
[5:02] Lord God and what you're going to do so
[5:04] father we thank you for every blessing
[5:06] guide this message today in Jesus
[5:09] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[5:12] God bless you as your BNC to praise God
[5:18] and I apologize you know Wednesday uh
[5:20] I preached on music more in depth and
[5:24] then the live stream cut off so I'm
[5:25] sorry what happened was I was using the
[5:28] church's Wi-Fi
[5:29] and that's why we've had all the sermons
[5:31] drop over the years is because the Wi-Fi
[5:34] signal goes in and out
[5:37] and that's why we ran that line to give
[5:39] the laptop direct Wi-Fi
[5:42] and I think it's only dropped one I
[5:44] think in the all these months we've done
[5:45] that so I do apologize about amen or
[5:47] whoever was listening I don't know if
[5:48] bang has a chance to listen at work or
[5:49] not but
[5:50] I do apologize and then I tried to
[5:53] record the rest but then when I switched
[5:55] over and played those songs I was there
[5:56] when the spirit came on my iPad it
[5:57] stopped recording because it had to play
[5:59] the audio so I didn't even get the
[6:00] second half recorded so uh
[6:03] so as much as I like technology I'm not
[6:05] very good at technology so but anyways
[6:07] let's uh let's look at this thought here
[6:09] by God's grace so um I just want to you
[6:12] know preach this I have some slides here
[6:14] as simply as I can by the grace of the
[6:17] Lord and again we had a couple questions
[6:19] about
[6:20] the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders
[6:28] um and I just want to encourage
[6:29] everybody too you know I was praying up
[6:30] here and the thought just came to me you
[6:32] know I was praying for Chris you know I
[6:34] was looking for I was at Walmart
[6:35] yesterday I was looking for Chris I
[6:36] didn't see him you know I was looking
[6:38] for him to invite him back to church
[6:41] um you know Kyle Steve Shelby and member
[6:43] jakori Paul's son he came on that
[6:45] Wednesday night and it just struck me
[6:47] all
[6:49] five of those people were here when we
[6:50] were dancing around the church and
[6:52] praising God
[6:54] I thought wow I thought these five you
[6:57] know will continue to pray for them but
[6:58] these five visit us at a time when the
[7:01] spirit of Joy was here
[7:03] in other words they couldn't say and
[7:04] come in and say oh that was a dead
[7:05] service in fact they all said the
[7:07] opposite
[7:08] uh brother Steve or yes brother Steve
[7:11] said I love the energy but we know it's
[7:13] not energy it's the Holy Ghost you know
[7:14] yeah he calls it energy but
[7:17] like we used to say oh that was fun but
[7:18] it's not fun the word is Joy God's not
[7:21] fun God's full of joy
[7:23] I just was so blessed by that you know
[7:25] that God sent us these visitors in these
[7:26] last you know six months or whatever and
[7:29] each one has been able to feel the joy
[7:31] of the Lord now what's sad is that
[7:33] they've left the joy for things of the
[7:36] world that's why they're not here
[7:38] but we can have peace in our hearts that
[7:41] the joy was here the love of God was
[7:43] here
[7:44] and hopefully it'll they'll be reminded
[7:46] of that and they'll be attracted back to
[7:48] hear the word of God hallelujah think
[7:51] about I mean all those think about all
[7:52] those people in Jesus Ministry for three
[7:53] and a half years they saw him heal
[7:54] Miracles and then they all shouted
[7:56] crucifer not all but many of them
[7:58] shouted crucify him
[7:59] what happened just a week earlier they
[8:01] were saying Hosanna Hosanna
[8:03] it's just the spirit that people fall
[8:05] under how important it is for us to stay
[8:07] under the spirit of God
[8:10] right as we said with music on on
[8:12] Wednesday you know these people from uh
[8:15] Hillsong Bethel or you name it uh you
[8:18] name any of them you know I like Phil
[8:20] you know I like Shane and Shane
[8:21] you know but when they when they're in
[8:23] the channel of the Holy Spirit they get
[8:25] the right words but when they add rock
[8:27] and roll or any worldly beats then they
[8:29] get under the wrong spirit
[8:31] but how important for us it is to stay
[8:33] under the right spirit of God and I
[8:35] believe we're doing that by the grace of
[8:37] God it's just like Balaam as we said
[8:39] Balaam could get under the spirit of God
[8:40] but then there was other times he'd be
[8:42] under the wrong Spirit right I say the
[8:44] most the time he was under the wrong
[8:45] spirit
[8:46] so I just thought I'd share that you
[8:48] know I wrote that on my notes here and I
[8:49] just want to encourage you you know
[8:51] these visitors have seen our best Joy
[8:53] they've seen our our best worship
[8:55] Hallelujah and uh our best songs you
[8:58] know our best praise and so we'll just
[9:01] trust that God will draw them back
[9:03] you know all that the father has given
[9:05] me will come to me praise God so we have
[9:07] that great promise that God uh if these
[9:10] people you know really want to serve God
[9:12] then we're right here praise God we're
[9:13] not going anywhere we're right here and
[9:14] we'd be happy to have them uh by the
[9:16] grace of God so Saints I just want to
[9:18] make this as simple as possible you know
[9:21] what so here's where I preach I preach
[9:22] it back in March of 2022.
[9:26] now for me this is like going viral 280
[9:28] views on my on my sermon that's you know
[9:31] most of my sermons get 20 views you know
[9:33] something like that
[9:34] um you know it just shows people are
[9:36] just you know it's okay but people are
[9:37] interested in some of the controversial
[9:38] topics which is okay
[9:41] um
[9:42] and then I preached a part two I think
[9:43] the next service I don't know I didn't
[9:45] look that one up but uh if you'd like a
[9:48] uh review of this topic I was listening
[9:49] to it on the way here you know uh just
[9:52] to see was there anything I could leave
[9:53] out or anything I left out there I'd
[9:54] like to include
[9:56] um and it was a pretty anointed service
[9:57] by God's grace I felt the presence of
[9:59] God and
[10:00] um but anyways just if you like a review
[10:02] that's a good sermon to go listen to
[10:05] um
[10:06] and just think it's been 60 years since
[10:09] God opened the seals 60 years 1963 to
[10:13] 2023.
[10:15] and I'll say like this very few people
[10:16] have the right understanding of the
[10:18] seals
[10:20] uh or the seven Thunders
[10:22] and that's okay that's what Jesus said
[10:24] he said very few will find the narrow
[10:25] road
[10:27] um
[10:28] and to me you know uh
[10:31] to me I feel like uh like brother bam
[10:34] said he said take these tapes and go
[10:35] listen to them and the in the quietness
[10:37] of your home and he said see what the
[10:39] Holy Ghost will reveal to you
[10:41] Hallelujah and so that's what I've done
[10:43] you know that's what uh real Holy Ghost
[10:45] filled Saints do they go home and they
[10:46] listen to brother Branham and they
[10:48] meditate on those things Hallelujah and
[10:50] then God can show them revelations in
[10:52] there Hallelujah and so that's what I've
[10:55] done like I said I preach over 125
[10:57] sermons just on the Book of Revelation
[10:58] and if we put these in here now I'm
[11:00] getting close to 130 but it's just
[11:03] important to Remember You know here 60
[11:05] years later and we can look back and
[11:07] clearly see what God was doing by the
[11:10] grace of God
[11:11] and this all plays into uh the prophecy
[11:14] like last time Simon was here when I was
[11:16] here
[11:17] um
[11:18] you know I I said I come up here and I
[11:21] said the order remember the order of the
[11:22] Rapture what's left
[11:24] you know we have uh uh we have birth
[11:26] pains left that's what's happening now
[11:29] I mean you see the flooding you see the
[11:30] earthquakes you see all these uh natural
[11:32] disasters around the world
[11:34] that's birth pains
[11:36] uh covid-19 was the birth pain so we
[11:38] have birth pains left we I also at the
[11:41] same time we have the uniting of church
[11:42] and state
[11:44] right we have the brother Brown calls it
[11:46] The Binding of the tares
[11:48] so there there's numerous scriptures
[11:50] that need to be fulfilled
[11:52] and then to me as I said when Simon was
[11:54] here uh to me the biggest sign that the
[11:57] raptures here will been will be when the
[11:59] United States begins to lay down the
[12:01] mark
[12:02] now we believe will be raptured right
[12:05] before the Mark is laid down amen
[12:08] but laws first have to be passed where
[12:10] they where the United States because the
[12:12] United States is the beast in Revelation
[12:14] 13 verses 11 to 18 the beasts out of the
[12:17] land not the Beast out of the sea that
[12:19] was that was Pagan Rome turning into
[12:21] imperial Rome right but in verses 11 to
[12:25] 18 we have the Beast rising up out of
[12:27] the land that was the United States of
[12:29] America brother Brown tells us right
[12:31] they have power to make fire come down
[12:32] from heaven that's the atomic bomb
[12:34] uh from 1945 the two bombs that they
[12:36] dropped in Japan
[12:38] but to me that will be the greatest sign
[12:40] that the Rapture is here so until then
[12:43] what do we keep doing keep drawing
[12:44] closer to Jesus all the time Hallelujah
[12:46] watching watching and praying watching
[12:49] the signs praying and staying close to
[12:51] God not letting little things you know
[12:53] divide us and not let little things
[12:56] distract us from the presence of God and
[12:59] growing in Grace and knowledge of the
[13:00] Lord
[13:03] so you know we've seen at church you
[13:04] know I'm just going to kind of fly off
[13:06] the the cuff here I'm just going to
[13:07] shoot from the hip they say you know
[13:10] since brother left the scene look at all
[13:11] these people that follow brother random
[13:13] very few of them actually stayed in the
[13:14] middle of the road
[13:16] I'm going to name a few names here
[13:18] Joseph Coleman
[13:20] he took the seven Thunders and he said
[13:22] those seven Thunders were the Seven
[13:24] Virtues Of The Statue of perfect man so
[13:26] he said the first Thunder was Faith the
[13:28] second was virtue the third was
[13:29] knowledge and he made that a dogma and
[13:32] the fruits of his ministry have now
[13:34] proven he was wrong
[13:35] and he was saying the only way to be
[13:37] raptured would be to be in his church
[13:40] well that's so convenient you know
[13:41] that's well it's my church and you I'll
[13:43] be in the Rapture because I'm in my
[13:44] church you know it's and he excludes
[13:46] everybody else
[13:48] and so now and then he had for all those
[13:49] years he had people following him around
[13:51] the world now how did his life end
[13:54] his life ended where he got so sick that
[13:56] he let new preachers come up and they
[13:58] were actually alcoholics and drug
[14:00] addicts and adulterers they were
[14:02] sleeping with women in the church and
[14:03] they falsely prophesied that he'd get
[14:05] well and
[14:06] how do I know because I heard this
[14:07] person's podcast about it oh yeah and I
[14:09] met the brother who was in the church uh
[14:11] the brother from Pennsylvania uh brother
[14:15] I can't remember his last name now okay
[14:17] it'll probably come to me a little bit
[14:18] but I just preached for him a couple
[14:19] weeks ago when I was out in Pennsylvania
[14:22] um
[14:24] I'm ashamed of myself I can't think of
[14:25] his name but he left that church for
[14:27] those very reasons
[14:29] and they also prophesied that Coleman
[14:32] would rise from the dead after he died
[14:34] and of course he's still in the grave
[14:36] and then Coleman's Sons were caught in
[14:39] money laundering they money laundered
[14:41] and stole millions of dollars from the
[14:42] people they tried to get the people in
[14:44] this pyramid scheme so always watch your
[14:47] money chair see who's after your money
[14:48] the devil's after your money
[14:51] right trying to do Shady deals on the
[14:53] side and all kinds of bad Investments
[14:57] and they went to jail
[14:59] Joseph Coleman's Sons went to jail
[15:01] and so see you know and think about Lee
[15:04] Van leevel he was a good guy at the
[15:06] beginning but after a while he preached
[15:08] and he got to the spot brother value
[15:10] before he passed away there was no
[15:11] shouting in the church but you there was
[15:14] no rejoicing no dancing no Holy Ghost no
[15:17] emotion at all because he said it's the
[15:18] Holy Ghost without sensation
[15:21] and it became what they they crucified
[15:23] the Holy Ghost
[15:25] and not those people can't get born
[15:26] again because they can't get free
[15:28] right and now there's forms of that too
[15:30] right there's extremes where people go
[15:32] on that that was in Ohio levale was from
[15:34] Ohio
[15:35] it's it's Saint Paris right it's right
[15:37] south of Lima
[15:39] um
[15:40] you know uh
[15:42] there's so few people now Perry green
[15:44] was one of the few men that stayed with
[15:45] the word of God
[15:47] Eddie bisco for the most part stay with
[15:49] the word of God now he had a really bad
[15:50] mistake I told you about haven't called
[15:52] his name but he had a really bad mistake
[15:54] in the 90s
[15:55] now church I'm saying some plain things
[15:57] here this morning
[15:58] so you can see the love of Jesus Christ
[16:01] should produce honesty
[16:03] the love of Jesus Christ yes it'll have
[16:05] Miracles yes it'll have uh uh Joy
[16:08] Hallelujah and I'm dancing and have all
[16:10] these things
[16:11] it's got to have the whole word of God
[16:12] though
[16:13] it's got to have Christian character
[16:15] if it doesn't then the persons aren't
[16:17] born again
[16:20] so I'm just you know um here I'm here am
[16:22] I you know here are we we're standing UH
[16:25] 60 62 years after brother Brown's off
[16:27] the scene
[16:28] now what has brother Adams Ministry
[16:30] produced in our lives is produced the
[16:31] fruit of the Holy Spirit praise God
[16:34] that's why I like when William comes and
[16:36] uh these people come the preachers come
[16:38] in and say you have a wonderful worship
[16:40] service I say thank God for brother amen
[16:43] uh or brother William will say I I feel
[16:46] Divine love when uh I come to this
[16:49] church and sister Elizabeth will say I
[16:51] go to mega church but I don't feel loved
[16:52] there but I feel love when I come to
[16:53] your church I can say thank God this is
[16:55] what the Holy Ghost produces praise God
[16:57] Amen
[16:59] amen it's not maybe not big in number
[17:00] but it don't have to be big a number
[17:02] it's got to have the character of Christ
[17:04] Hallelujah and Jesus said few there be
[17:06] that find it Hallelujah if we can't love
[17:09] our enemies we're not Christians
[17:11] Hallelujah if we can't love one another
[17:13] we're not Christians
[17:16] so
[17:18] you know this is like I said this is
[17:19] like a sermon like modern events made
[17:21] clear by prophecy
[17:23] so we'll look at some of these events
[17:25] now
[17:26] um I do want to read Daniel 12 4 before
[17:28] I forget I just made these notes before
[17:29] I come out here Daniel 12 verse 4. I
[17:32] don't have it on my slides that's why I
[17:33] wrote it there
[17:38] so I'll make a point about Daniel as
[17:40] well
[17:41] um Daniel 12.
[17:44] I'll just read verse one because we got
[17:46] time I don't really have a whole lot of
[17:47] slides because it's a kind of a review
[17:50] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[17:52] the great Prince which standeth for the
[17:53] children of thy people he's talking to
[17:55] Daniel so Jews Michael will stand up for
[17:57] the Jews in the tribulation period and
[18:00] there shall be a time of trouble that's
[18:02] a tribulation such as never was since
[18:04] there was a nation even to the same time
[18:06] remember there's going to be demons that
[18:08] are going to be tormenting people for
[18:09] five months
[18:10] they look like scorpions they got hair
[18:12] like women uh they look like horses as
[18:15] well
[18:16] this is a time of trouble the world's
[18:18] never seen
[18:19] anyone who goes against the Catholic
[18:21] Church will be killed
[18:23] right but we'll be gone by God's grace
[18:25] before that happens that's what we
[18:27] believe that's what we believe the Bible
[18:28] teaches that
[18:30] at that time thy people shall be
[18:31] delivered that has to be the hundred and
[18:33] forty four thousand that's God's people
[18:35] Everyone that should be found written in
[18:37] the book now what a promise amen as long
[18:39] as your name's in The Book of Life
[18:40] hallelujah amen God will deliver you
[18:43] praise God God will not have wrath upon
[18:45] his people praise God
[18:47] verse two and many of them that sleep in
[18:50] the dust of the Earth shall awake some
[18:51] to everlasting life and some to shame
[18:53] and everlasting contempt
[18:56] now that seems to be the white Throne
[18:58] judgment but it could be something else
[18:59] verse three and they that be wise shall
[19:01] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[19:03] and they that turn many to righteousness
[19:05] as the Stars forever and ever
[19:09] verse 4 but thou o Daniel shut up the
[19:12] words and seal the book even to the time
[19:15] of the end many shall run to and fro and
[19:18] knowledge shall be increased okay so we
[19:21] can clearly see that's our day knowledge
[19:23] is increased right we know that with
[19:26] technology how it's so increased
[19:29] um and so in other words the what I want
[19:30] to bring out is see he says seal the
[19:32] book so the mysteries of the book were
[19:34] sealed until the end
[19:36] right and then we know Revelation 10 7
[19:37] but in the days of the voice of the
[19:39] seventh angel when he shall begin the
[19:41] sound the mystery of God will be
[19:43] finished as he hath declared to his
[19:44] servants the prophets
[19:46] so there has to come a time when the
[19:48] mystery of God is open and is finished
[19:49] and that's according to Revelation uh
[19:52] chapter 10 verse 7.
[19:54] now before I get to the the order I want
[19:57] to just go through these slides so I
[19:59] want to start with the seven Church ages
[20:00] brother Adam said the revelations not
[20:03] every word
[20:04] but the revelations in the church ages
[20:06] and the seals was thus saith the Lord
[20:09] as I've proven I've tried to prove
[20:11] through my videos
[20:12] um
[20:14] you know brother Brown used a lot of
[20:15] Larkin's information
[20:17] but Larkin didn't say everything brother
[20:19] Brandon said brother Brown said many
[20:21] more additional things that Larkin
[20:22] didn't say
[20:23] Hallelujah
[20:26] um and brother random said you know
[20:27] bring all your books when we preach the
[20:28] church ages and over 20 times he said
[20:31] we're going to use historians
[20:32] informations he he was being transparent
[20:36] but the revelations brother random gave
[20:37] were different than anybody else right
[20:40] right all the revelations in those uh
[20:43] seven Church ages and of course the
[20:45] Seven Seals
[20:47] so here's what he says he finished he's
[20:49] finishing the seventh seal
[20:50] now the vision now that's the vision
[20:52] he's speaking of of the cloud
[20:54] which he called the seven angels the
[20:56] constellation of seven angels The Vision
[20:58] Plus the word plus the history plus the
[21:01] church ages all blend together so I
[21:04] could truly say that to the best of my
[21:05] understanding and according to the word
[21:06] of God and the vision and the Revelation
[21:09] the interpretation therefore or thereof
[21:11] is thus saith the Lord hallelujah
[21:14] now you're all familiar with this so I'm
[21:16] going to try to just go slow with this
[21:17] here's the seven Church ages now these
[21:19] dates are very similar to Larkin
[21:22] but Brothers changed two of them I can't
[21:24] remember which ones they are now I know
[21:25] he changed laodicea and I think I can't
[21:27] remember which other one he changed
[21:30] um
[21:31] but brother man got the idea of the
[21:33] dates from Larkin he just changed two of
[21:35] them
[21:36] okay now Larkin didn't do Messengers
[21:39] it was Charles Tay's Russell that did
[21:41] Messengers but Charles Tays Russell
[21:43] makes him himself the seventh messenger
[21:45] and we know he wasn't he predicted the
[21:47] Rapture I think it was 1819 he said
[21:49] that's the year of the Rapture and it
[21:51] came and passed and you know he was he
[21:53] was no prophet
[21:55] um and then uh Charles days Russell had
[21:58] Saint John was the first church age
[21:59] messenger and brother Branham chose
[22:01] Saint Paul
[22:03] so see what what's happening church is
[22:06] that these men were drawing close to God
[22:08] and they had gifts to teach and preach
[22:10] but they weren't Prophets
[22:12] right and even the ones that said thou
[22:14] saith the Lord like Charles says Russell
[22:15] we're wrong they were proven to be wrong
[22:18] uh Clarence Larkin never said thus saith
[22:20] the Lord because he was just that he was
[22:21] just a teacher he was a pastor thank God
[22:22] he was a faithful he's a wonderful
[22:24] teacher of the word of God but he didn't
[22:26] have everything right
[22:27] it took a seventh Church age Messenger
[22:30] to finish the mysteries of God
[22:32] Hallelujah
[22:33] now I'm going to go through these a
[22:35] little faster you might remember these
[22:36] so
[22:37] now we're getting into the Seven Seals
[22:39] the Seven Seals show that God sent the
[22:41] first anointing on the church was as a
[22:43] lion okay and to combat that Satan sent
[22:46] out a white horse a deceptive teaching
[22:48] Antichrist spirit
[22:50] okay that's a white horse
[22:52] and uh that was the first seal and it
[22:54] was in innocent deception on the part of
[22:57] Satan but Church the elect cannot be
[22:59] deceived
[23:01] it's impossible
[23:02] for us to be deceived someone was
[23:04] texting me yesterday overseas and said
[23:05] you know what he's looking at my music
[23:07] videos and he said I really appreciate
[23:08] that
[23:09] uh he said but yeah he said but we got
[23:11] to be so careful with music I'm like yes
[23:13] exactly right we must be so careful but
[23:15] I sense a little bit of fear on him and
[23:17] so I said friend we're not going to be
[23:18] deceived
[23:20] I don't walk around saying oh is God
[23:22] going to strike me down here is God
[23:24] going to strike me down here I walk in
[23:25] the love of God hallelujah now I am a
[23:28] Son of God hallelujah now I'm a Child of
[23:30] God but yes yes I'm aware I want to be
[23:32] very aware
[23:33] but I've served God long enough to know
[23:35] if I walk and
[23:36] Joy walk and be
[23:38] in those moments when I might make a
[23:39] mistake the Holy Ghost is there to
[23:41] correct me praise God
[23:43] he'll show me he'll correct me just like
[23:44] he did brother Brandon praise God
[23:46] remember that still small voice
[23:48] Hallelujah one thing's quiet down in
[23:51] your home or at night time or morning
[23:52] time whenever time you get quiet time
[23:55] that's that's so small voice will start
[23:57] saying Jesse or Zer or Beatrice or
[24:00] acacia
[24:02] check this area of your life
[24:05] study this further
[24:07] it's a still Small Voice right
[24:11] or sometimes there may be preachers and
[24:13] they'll just blast exactly what you
[24:14] needed right it won't be a still Small
[24:16] Voice they'll be shout when you're
[24:17] screaming or jumping around or pouting
[24:20] on the wall like brother Diggs or
[24:21] something like that you you'll know it's
[24:22] God praise God
[24:24] there's just something about the
[24:25] Christian they know God is speaking
[24:27] praise God because their ears can hear
[24:29] what the spirit says in the church
[24:30] Hallelujah
[24:33] right they've got they have ice out they
[24:35] can see God moving to their midst praise
[24:37] God they're not blinded to the things of
[24:39] the world you know they're not blinded
[24:41] by Leo to see them they're not blinded
[24:43] by the goddess evil age praise God
[24:46] but the true God of this age the Lord
[24:48] Jesus Christ has given them ice out and
[24:50] they can see Hallelujah they've got
[24:52] spiritual sight
[24:53] now this white represents the number of
[24:55] years so the first seal was it was the
[24:58] beasts working on both Vines but it was
[25:01] also a time period
[25:05] okay so it lasted almost two Church ages
[25:07] all right well then brother Adam said
[25:09] after that the Antichrist jumped off his
[25:11] White Horse and got on a bloody red one
[25:13] and that's when he got power to kill
[25:16] right so that's Satan it's death it's
[25:18] the death rider the whole time we just
[25:19] find out his name under the fourth seal
[25:23] okay so then he's going to come and so
[25:25] the Saints have to have the anointing of
[25:27] the ox to make themselves a sacrifice to
[25:30] die as martyrs
[25:32] okay that's the second
[25:34] now Satan's got United powers to kill
[25:36] United church and state
[25:39] okay and this last uh over parts of
[25:43] three Church ages
[25:45] okay and then brother Brown said then
[25:47] he's now that he's got power of church
[25:49] and stay and power to kill
[25:51] uh now he he can take control uh as the
[25:55] Black Horse he's got power to control
[25:57] the food and the spiritual food he's got
[25:59] power almost of all the uh the known
[26:02] world right
[26:03] and uh brother Brown said that's the
[26:05] black horse or the Dark Ages he's
[26:07] capturing the wealth of the world that's
[26:09] where you have your Crusades you know
[26:10] the Catholic Church would go on crusades
[26:13] and they would promise you know every
[26:14] person every man that died they promised
[26:17] them eternal life and all their sins
[26:18] forgiven and they get to get out of
[26:20] purgatory for free
[26:22] that's the same thing the Muslims do
[26:23] right they know if they die in a Jihad
[26:25] then they get they automatically go to
[26:27] heaven Allah will let them go to heaven
[26:29] they'll have like a hundred wives or
[26:30] something like that they promise them
[26:31] all these lies
[26:32] they can't handle one wife how are you
[26:34] going to handle 100 wives right they
[26:36] don't have the character to handle one
[26:37] wife
[26:40] and them in that age there'll be no
[26:41] marriage like it is here right it won't
[26:43] be a physical thing it'll be a spiritual
[26:45] thing right a spiritual Unity
[26:48] but they always tempt them with those
[26:49] type of worldly lies and so forth now
[26:52] the longest seal was the third seal was
[26:54] over 900 years
[26:55] this lasted
[26:58] okay and so that that black horse rode
[27:02] for a long time
[27:03] right he was capturing the wealth of the
[27:05] world but slowly though at the end the
[27:07] pope lost his power and influence over
[27:09] the Nations
[27:11] and it's all it's all laid out in my
[27:12] book where's my book it's all laid out
[27:14] in there I just had brother Brian he's
[27:16] like you texted me yesterday he said you
[27:18] wrote this book I'm like yeah I wrote it
[27:19] two years ago he's like I'm just finding
[27:21] out about it today I thought that's a
[27:23] good sign I'm not bragging about my book
[27:24] or anything like that
[27:26] it's just uh it's just and I told him I
[27:29] said he said oh brother I'm so far
[27:30] behind I said no brother I said God's
[27:32] put your God's foot God has ordered your
[27:34] footsteps to the Lord forgive me trying
[27:36] to go too fast the footsteps of the
[27:38] righteous are order the Lord and you and
[27:41] I will find everything we need in the
[27:42] right season of Our Lives praise God if
[27:44] we make a mistake God will forgive us
[27:46] and God will bring us back in the
[27:47] perfect will
[27:48] but you'll find exactly what you need at
[27:51] the right time
[27:52] God is faithful
[27:54] Hallelujah
[27:56] and so write about the laodicean church
[27:58] age now we need an ego anointing we need
[28:01] a prophetic Ministry to finish the
[28:04] mystery of God to turn our hearts back
[28:05] to the apostolic fathers
[28:07] but also spiritual death is here
[28:10] okay so this rides it wrote from about
[28:12] 1906 it's not my brother man's birth
[28:15] and right out to the end time this ego
[28:17] anointing will last that long
[28:19] now some people may say it may go in the
[28:21] two Israel prophets well I'll give you
[28:23] that because they're prophets I'll give
[28:26] you that brother man said you know the
[28:28] gospel rent from the Jews to the
[28:29] Gentiles right through through Paul
[28:31] Barnabas and all those Saints and then
[28:34] he says it's got to go back from the
[28:36] Gentiles back to the Jews that that
[28:38] seems like it's true
[28:40] okay and so that rides out now
[28:43] um we go up in the Rapture but of course
[28:45] I said that anointing might stay on
[28:47] those two prophets I'm just giving you a
[28:49] visual and brothers said the pale horse
[28:51] rider makes his ride all the way down to
[28:54] the battle of Armageddon
[28:55] okay because that's where the Antichrist
[28:57] is defeated
[28:58] and the Antichrist is cast in the Lake
[29:01] of Fire right there at the end of
[29:02] Armageddon that's his final ride
[29:06] okay now I'm going to give a better
[29:07] illustration of this later but the
[29:09] seventh seal is the rapture I'm going to
[29:12] get um it starts it starts the seventh
[29:14] seal is the beginning of the end
[29:18] right because once once the Rapture goes
[29:20] it's all it's all bad after that yeah
[29:22] it's all bad it's all judgments and
[29:25] Wrath
[29:26] and time is beginning to run out now
[29:29] time is going to start running out this
[29:31] is the last mystery this is the last set
[29:34] of events before
[29:35] eternity sets in
[29:37] and God ends time
[29:40] so also right after you know the Rapture
[29:42] in the fifth sea almost happened at the
[29:44] same time the Rapture happens and then
[29:45] the Jews you know saying how long O Lord
[29:47] now the Raptors happen how long Lord and
[29:49] and the Lord says I've got more Jewish
[29:51] Martyrs that have to be fulfilled okay
[29:54] and that's during the tribulation period
[29:56] okay and then the sixth C of course is
[29:58] the Tribulation seal it's the
[30:00] interruption of nature it's two prophets
[30:02] that can control nature right they can
[30:04] turn the Waters of blood they can make
[30:05] it not rain for three and a half years
[30:08] right and then after they leave then you
[30:10] have another half last week of the
[30:12] tribulation period where the trumpets
[30:14] are blown the vows are pouring out the
[30:15] woes are pouring out and then it all
[30:18] ends up with the battle of Armageddon
[30:20] all right praise God now this is a lot
[30:22] of review now here this one might help
[30:23] you so this one brand new I made this
[30:25] one this morning so hopefully it helps
[30:27] you by God's grace
[30:29] okay so the church ages and the Seven
[30:31] Seals now see I didn't I didn't break up
[30:32] so I didn't have time I didn't break up
[30:34] this into seven pieces okay it's just
[30:35] one Church age so it's two thousand
[30:37] years it's all the church ages and just
[30:39] in one little small little group there
[30:41] okay
[30:42] so hopefully this will help somebody by
[30:43] God's grace
[30:45] so that was the first seal the first
[30:47] seal lasted that time
[30:49] okay the second seal lasted a little bit
[30:51] longer
[30:53] the third seal was the longest right of
[30:56] the time periods of the first four seals
[30:58] and now the fourth seal is going to last
[31:00] a little while too it lasted from the
[31:02] start of the seven Church age and it's
[31:04] going to last all the way down to the
[31:05] battle of Armageddon
[31:07] because the four seal has the fourth
[31:09] Rider death
[31:10] and death makes his final ride we can
[31:13] you can read about it in Revelation
[31:14] chapter six he makes his final ride and
[31:16] he deceives uh I believe a fourth part
[31:19] of the earth the Bible says or the the
[31:21] four corners of the earth and he
[31:23] deceives them and brings them to the
[31:24] battle of Armageddon
[31:26] so that's the four seal now here watch
[31:28] this one we're here by God's grace
[31:30] here's the seven seal the seven seal is
[31:33] a time period
[31:34] I hope that helps you by God's grace let
[31:36] me do let me go back can I go back all
[31:38] right I gotta run them all back again
[31:39] all right I wish I could go back one at
[31:41] a time
[31:42] the Rapture starts the seventh seal or
[31:44] the final mystery here of these Seven
[31:46] Seals It's the final time period before
[31:48] time ends
[31:51] okay so watch this one here's a seven
[31:53] seal the seven seal is all it's from the
[31:56] time of the the end of the Gentile
[31:57] Church ages all the way to the New
[31:59] Jerusalem I'll show the New Jerusalem a
[32:00] little bit so once the Rapture happens
[32:02] the Seven Seals open
[32:05] okay and then uh here's the next one
[32:09] there it is okay there's official the
[32:11] fifth seal is just a short time after
[32:13] the Rapture the Jews cry out how much
[32:14] longer how much longer and he says more
[32:16] of your brethren more Jews have to die
[32:18] in the tribulation period
[32:19] that's official
[32:21] okay now the Sixth Seal is just that uh
[32:25] tribulation period The Seven Year Great
[32:26] Tribulation period the Jew the two
[32:29] Jewish prophets preach it for the first
[32:30] three and a half years
[32:32] and then they go they go home in the
[32:34] Rapture praise God and then uh God pours
[32:37] out his wrath that's the Sixth Seal
[32:39] okay
[32:41] and then brother Adam said the seventh
[32:43] seal
[32:44] he says the end of time he said it's the
[32:46] end of the seals it's the end of the uh
[32:48] it's under the vials it's under the
[32:50] trumpets end of he said it's the end of
[32:51] everything amen send them everything
[32:56] and so once the white Throne judgment
[32:58] happens and and then once there's you
[33:00] know all the Sinners have been casting
[33:02] Lake of Fire all the demons thank God
[33:04] they've been casting Lake of Fire no
[33:06] more torment Hallelujah once it's all
[33:08] done and the New Jerusalem comes down
[33:10] then time shall be no more praise God no
[33:13] more there's no more seals praise God
[33:15] Hallelujah
[33:17] it's just this glorious time the
[33:19] honeymoon's over now we're entering into
[33:21] our home life with Jesus
[33:24] hallelujah praise God
[33:26] the honeymoon somewhere in here
[33:27] honeymoon's right the honeymoon's a big
[33:29] spot in here praise God it's in your
[33:30] honeymoon
[33:32] Gloria
[33:34] but I hope that helps by God's grace
[33:36] does that help can anybody say Amen is
[33:37] it anybody raise a hand if that helps or
[33:39] anything okay good okay so
[33:41] now
[33:42] what would be more beneficial is if I
[33:45] could zoom this in so make this smaller
[33:47] and I could put Daniel 70 weeks on top
[33:50] of that
[33:52] and you see it even better
[33:54] right
[33:55] so if I had room over here
[34:01] all the way for
[34:03] way for Babylon all the way to
[34:05] the feet
[34:07] right and then God blinded the Jews he
[34:10] stopped Daniel 70 weeks and then he's
[34:11] going to pick it up and then I'll put
[34:13] the feet right here right after the
[34:14] Rapture
[34:15] everybody understand yes
[34:18] because God because that that image has
[34:20] to be
[34:21] this is what I want to say Church
[34:24] it's okay if you're going in Grace and
[34:26] knowledge of God Daniel was in Babylon
[34:28] all those years at the end of his life
[34:30] he fasted for 21 days to know what God
[34:32] was doing and he kept reading Jeremiah's
[34:35] words and we're reading the Bible today
[34:36] praise God
[34:38] he was still trying to understand
[34:39] prophecy in other words and after 21
[34:41] days God showed him that vision of the
[34:44] statue praise God and but it took a lot
[34:46] of time it took a lot of waiting on God
[34:49] it took seeking God so what I'm saying
[34:51] is keep seeking God God will reveal all
[34:53] he wants you to know in his season
[34:54] praise God Amen
[34:56] 21 days and then Gabriel comes to him
[34:59] and says you're greatly beloved in
[35:01] heaven praise God and the Bible says
[35:04] we're God's beloved Hallelujah
[35:12] so we have we have the grace to know
[35:14] where God's beloved so we got to live
[35:15] like it praise God let's keep living
[35:17] like how many one living like it by
[35:18] God's grace I want to live like I'm
[35:21] God's beloved
[35:24] you know I had a Canadian gentleman text
[35:26] me yesterday and he said I just want to
[35:27] tell you brother Jesse every time I
[35:28] listen to you preach and make all your
[35:30] videos he said I fall more in love with
[35:32] this message
[35:33] and I wrote him back I said brother from
[35:34] the bottom of my heart you make me want
[35:36] to cry you're such a blessing to me
[35:39] praise God that's what I want to do
[35:40] praise God I want to just show the truth
[35:43] of the revelation of the Bible I want to
[35:45] believe the Bible live the Bible uh
[35:47] believe in brother Branham honey is
[35:49] God's Prophet just like all the other
[35:50] six Church age Messengers I want to
[35:52] manifest Jesus Christ to my generation
[35:54] praise God
[35:55] let me read that now
[35:58] here's brother Adam's prayer it's on the
[35:59] inside of this this Bible
[36:01] what was brother man's prayer dear God
[36:03] help me to be thy true servant I promise
[36:05] to teach this thy holy word praise God
[36:08] and to live it
[36:10] as thou will help me to do
[36:13] I do believe everywhere in this Bible
[36:15] how many kids say Amen to Be Thy word
[36:18] help me to live and prove it so to my
[36:21] generation how do you say that's my
[36:23] prayer too that's fine and I like this
[36:26] Bible because it says now write your
[36:27] prayer to God but I never wrote it
[36:28] because I said that's my prayer I'm just
[36:30] going to use the same prayer
[36:32] Reverend he says I he said in Jesus
[36:35] Christ's name I pray a man Reverend
[36:37] William Branham Tucson Arizona his
[36:39] unworthy humble servant
[36:42] that's what I want to be
[36:44] I'm an unworthy but I want to be a homo
[36:47] servant to Jesus Christ
[36:49] and make this real to as many people as
[36:51] I possibly can
[36:52] now you gotta be careful you buy this
[36:53] Bible
[36:54] because at the bottom Joseph put in here
[36:56] he said
[36:57] may your understanding of the words
[36:59] written in this holy book agree line for
[37:02] line word for word and Dot for DOT with
[37:03] the message of the hour in other words
[37:05] may you agree with every word on the
[37:07] tape now see you got good and you got
[37:10] bad that's okay I love the brother
[37:12] I was emailing him yesterday
[37:15] I always mentioned that every service
[37:18] it's not a complex I'm just trying to
[37:19] help him I said when are you going to
[37:21] say what the tapes say
[37:23] the tapes say Billy Paul's a promise
[37:24] Joseph when are you going to say that I
[37:26] said when are you going to put that on
[37:27] your blog I'm probably gonna get no
[37:29] response that's okay that's okay I'm not
[37:32] trying to be a smart alec I'm just
[37:33] saying when you have the truth you're
[37:35] not you're not afraid of questions
[37:37] you don't avoid hard questions you pray
[37:39] and let God reveal it to you praise God
[37:42] so I'm trying to be as kind as possible
[37:45] now let me go over this here
[37:49] you know to understand the seals and the
[37:52] Thunders you have to know the seals have
[37:54] three forms
[37:55] okay brother Ram said there's symbol
[37:57] form
[37:58] uh there's reality form and there's
[38:00] Revelation form there's three forms to
[38:02] the Seven Seals that's where it gets
[38:04] confusing especially with the seventh
[38:05] seal because Brothers will say the Seven
[38:07] Seals open and then he says the seven
[38:09] seal has been open to us
[38:11] well it is open right and some of the in
[38:14] a couple of the forms but it's not open
[38:16] in some of the other forms
[38:18] okay so you just have to listen to the
[38:20] first seal and I'm not going to read
[38:21] through all this because you can go back
[38:23] and listen to the um
[38:25] the sermon I just want to uh go through
[38:28] these quickly here by God's grace
[38:30] so
[38:32] uh where's Acacia okay she had a good
[38:33] question all right
[38:35] she she had one of the questions which
[38:36] was a great question
[38:38] okay so the first seal
[38:40] the symbol was given to John in 90 A.D
[38:43] the reality form happened that's that
[38:45] white time space period I put on the
[38:47] time timeline and the Revelation was
[38:49] given to brother Branham on March 18
[38:51] 1963. uh that was a Monday right yeah
[38:54] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday 60
[38:56] years ago
[38:58] second seal oh yeah I'm sorry in the
[39:01] first seal when brother man preached
[39:02] that and he got done preaching when he
[39:03] was preaching the Revelation that he saw
[39:05] in the vision that was God's voice
[39:07] thundering out to the people
[39:09] it didn't sound like thunder on Earth
[39:11] but it sounded like thunder in heaven
[39:13] praise God Amen the Bible said it was
[39:16] Thunder hallelujah amen
[39:18] right
[39:22] so what when brother and preaches what
[39:24] was happening it was Jesus bringing an
[39:26] open book down to brother Branham it was
[39:29] fulfilling Revelation chapter 10 1-7
[39:32] Hallelujah
[39:33] and then now that the book's opened but
[39:35] Ram can preach exactly what it what what
[39:37] the the vision saw with and it lines up
[39:39] with the word word for word line for
[39:41] line in the Bible praise God and then he
[39:43] can say that thus save the Lord praise
[39:45] God
[39:46] that's a lie that's a line roaring
[39:50] let's read that if you got your Bible
[39:51] I'll go to Amos 3 7.
[39:54] do you want to read that for me
[39:58] you're always going to be my official
[40:00] first reader all right no I don't have
[40:03] the official Imo's three seven we never
[40:05] got down
[40:13] your unto his servant to the prophets
[40:15] amen now I can read verse six I think I
[40:16] left out six
[40:24] okay now read verse eight
[40:31] okay praise God so that scripture says
[40:34] God will do nothing except he reveals a
[40:36] secret to His prophets and it's like a
[40:38] lion roaring right okay now if you got
[40:41] your Bible go to Revelation chapter 10.
[40:44] now some of these symbols are a little
[40:46] difficult to see and I don't claim to
[40:48] have a good understanding of all of them
[40:51] um but we can clearly see uh lots of
[40:54] similarities here now we know verse
[40:57] Revelation 10 verse 7 is brother Ram's
[40:59] Ministry
[41:00] where the mystery of God is finished now
[41:02] how does it get finished
[41:03] it's got to be finished uh by the mighty
[41:06] Angel Christ in other words the Holy
[41:08] Spirit coming down and bringing the
[41:10] revelations to a man on the Earth
[41:13] okay verse one and I saw another Mighty
[41:14] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[41:17] a cloud and with the rainbow I'm sorry a
[41:19] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[41:22] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[41:24] pillars of Fire
[41:26] now we know the cloud uh look like this
[41:29] I'm gonna
[41:30] skip ahead so this is a video I put out
[41:32] last week I think yeah 11 days I'm sorry
[41:34] two almost a week and a half ago
[41:36] so this is what we believe this this
[41:38] cloud in uh taken in Arizona February 19
[41:41] I'm sorry February 1963 was was Jesus
[41:45] clothed in the cloud that may seem
[41:47] strange but if you read the Bible many
[41:49] times God came down in the cloud he came
[41:52] down to Moses in the cloud
[41:54] I mean numerous times he overshadowed
[41:57] Solomon's Tabernacle in a cloud amen
[42:00] in the cloud
[42:02] so cloud is something God would often do
[42:04] he'd often put himself in a cloud
[42:07] okay
[42:09] now we know it's Jesus uh because the
[42:12] Rainbow on his head and his face as the
[42:14] sun and feed his pillars now there's no
[42:15] there's no face feet or rainbow here but
[42:18] these are descriptions of Jesus in
[42:19] heaven in Revelation chapter one
[42:23] so you see it's Jesus coming down and a
[42:26] rainbow means a covenant anyway praise
[42:27] God
[42:28] now
[42:30] I want to show this too this cloud of
[42:33] course was was taken
[42:35] I think brother Jose's not here but I
[42:37] want to thank him for
[42:40] so here's the picture of that cloud in
[42:41] this 1963 now a lot of people think it's
[42:44] awesome that there's a rainbow
[42:47] on the other side so if you could
[42:48] actually look through this through the
[42:49] light you would see a rainbow on top of
[42:51] the cloud now some people I can see it
[42:53] now I can see a rainbow on top of the
[42:55] cloud so some people say
[42:57] that's the Fulfillment of Revelation 10
[42:59] 1 I don't know
[43:01] um I just think it's very fitting though
[43:02] I think it's very fitting I think it's a
[43:05] great it's a great uh
[43:07] it's a great sign that that was God
[43:10] along with all the other proofs okay
[43:14] okay and he had in his hand a little
[43:16] white book open now just so you know
[43:20] Jesus can't come back he can't set his
[43:22] foot on this Earth until the millennium
[43:25] so that so if this Mighty Angel comes
[43:28] down and he's got his foot on the sea in
[43:29] the land it's got to be the Holy Ghost
[43:30] because he will not touch this Earth
[43:32] until it's burned over with fire
[43:34] Hallelujah
[43:35] and we walk on the ashes of the wicked
[43:37] so this has to be a holy ghost coming
[43:39] and not a physical angel coming or like
[43:42] a spiritual angel coming visible like
[43:43] we'd see Gabriel we'd see Michael or
[43:45] we'd see wormwood or we'd see any other
[43:47] Angel like the angel of the Lord
[43:51] okay so these are all spiritual things
[43:53] now look at verse uh three and cry with
[43:56] a loud voice as when a lion roar now I
[43:58] read I read Amos three
[44:02] uh six seven eight to show that when God
[44:05] does a mystery it's like a lion roaring
[44:07] so here the Holy Ghost comes down he's
[44:09] clothed in a cloud
[44:11] and he Roars like a lion in other words
[44:13] a prophet is going to preach amen
[44:15] hallelujah
[44:16] the prophet's going to preach
[44:18] as when a lion roared and when he cried
[44:21] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[44:24] okay seven Thunders so when Jesus comes
[44:27] down he brings an Open Bible
[44:29] glory amen no more Mysteries Hallelujah
[44:32] as far as the bible-defined Mysteries
[44:33] are finished
[44:35] right
[44:36] and he makes he a lion roar so Christ
[44:38] Roars through the ministry brother
[44:40] random
[44:41] and what he does when that book comes
[44:43] down seven Thunders under their voices
[44:46] okay and like I showed you now let's go
[44:48] back
[44:49] so in case you this one I want to show
[44:51] this to you hon
[44:52] when when brother Brown preached the
[44:54] first seal
[44:55] that was the first thunder in other
[44:57] words all the truths of God that was the
[44:59] first Thunder they thundered out
[45:01] because a thunder is God speaking to his
[45:05] people whether through a prophet or
[45:07] rather or whether out loud too it could
[45:09] be out loud you could hear a thunder
[45:10] like in John chapter 12.
[45:12] okay so the first seal was the first
[45:14] Thunder
[45:15] because remember when this book was
[45:16] brought down seven Thunders utter their
[45:18] voices and the church said
[45:21] amen they've got to be uttered in other
[45:22] words if Revelation 10 7 is fulfilled
[45:25] then the seven Thunders had to smoke
[45:26] already right they hadn't been spoken
[45:30] because that's the order Christ comes
[45:32] down he's got the book open that's the
[45:34] revelation of the Bible
[45:35] and seven Thunder speak
[45:38] and then the mystery of God is finished
[45:39] praise God
[45:41] and then you and I are supposed to eat
[45:42] the book and go share it with the world
[45:44] share with everybody after that we can
[45:46] praise God
[45:47] is that right
[45:51] I love it praise God I love to know
[45:53] we're doing our part
[45:55] we're standing here saying all who want
[45:57] to hear from the open book can come hear
[45:59] the open book praise God I love that
[46:01] God's given Austin so many opportunities
[46:02] to share the about the open book invite
[46:05] people to church we all want to invite
[46:07] people to church but we got to wait for
[46:08] God's opportunities to do it
[46:10] right I love that
[46:12] Hallelujah
[46:14] so when so on March 18th the first
[46:17] Thunder sounded his voice
[46:20] the white horse rider uh the lion
[46:22] anointing
[46:24] Tuesday brother preached the second seal
[46:26] that was the second Thunder uh the red
[46:29] horse right
[46:30] and then the ox anointing all those
[46:32] Revelations was God thundering a second
[46:34] time Wednesday was the third seal that
[46:37] was the third Thunder Hallelujah
[46:39] amen money Tuesday was it Thursday was
[46:42] the fourth seal that was the four
[46:44] Thunder
[46:45] Hallelujah
[46:47] Friday was the fifth seal
[46:50] that was the fifth Thunder March 22nd
[46:52] 1963. Saturday was The Sixth Seal that
[46:56] was the sixth Thunder praise God
[46:59] and I'm just gonna go through these
[47:00] quickly because by now I'm sure some of
[47:02] you are more familiar with it how many
[47:04] know you sometimes you need repetition
[47:05] to understand things
[47:08] because I don't think anybody in here
[47:09] catches everything the first time right
[47:11] I know I didn't and you know as I get
[47:14] older I realize how much more I forget
[47:16] things
[47:17] I used to remember those quotes but now
[47:18] they've left my mind because I've
[47:19] studied different things and so I got to
[47:21] go back and review those quotes
[47:24] and then on Sunday
[47:26] March 24th brother man preached the
[47:28] seventh seal and that was the seventh
[47:30] Thunder
[47:31] God was telling us what we would know
[47:33] about the seventh seal
[47:35] as much as we could know
[47:37] now here's here's here's what I'm saying
[47:39] uh about the seventh seal
[47:42] the seventh seal had no symbol but it
[47:44] didn't have a description there's
[47:45] silence in heaven that must mean Jesus
[47:47] left Heaven that must mean it's the
[47:48] rapture
[47:50] now the reality form of the seven seal
[47:52] is the day in hours Matthew 24 I think
[47:55] it's 13. the day and hour no man knoweth
[47:58] except God only not the son not the
[48:00] Angels but God only right
[48:03] that's that's the reality form of the
[48:06] seven seal that day and hour when no man
[48:08] knows it
[48:10] but the revelation of it oh these two
[48:13] things this was the Revelation the
[48:15] Revelation was known to us on March 24th
[48:17] 1963.
[48:19] that's what we got the understanding
[48:20] about no sounds in heaven no symbol and
[48:23] the Rowdy form is the day and hour of
[48:25] the rapture
[48:27] okay
[48:29] now here's a more here's a more fun or
[48:32] more detailed or maybe more difficult to
[48:34] understand timeline
[48:35] hopefully not more confusing but it
[48:37] could be all I did was add the reality
[48:40] forms so here's where John got the
[48:42] symbol form of the Seven Seals in 80 90
[48:45] or 180 it doesn't matter the actual year
[48:48] right the reality form is when all these
[48:50] time periods happened and those Spirits
[48:53] actually bowed each other
[48:54] so right now we're in the reality form
[48:56] of the Pale Horse
[48:58] the Revelation form came 60 years ago
[49:00] praise God in 1963.
[49:04] Hallelujah
[49:09] so a symbol form was 80 90 around that
[49:11] time the reality form was all those
[49:13] timelines and the Revelation form was in
[49:15] 1963.
[49:17] okay now at the end of this I will take
[49:19] questions okay because it probably a
[49:21] little shorter sermon than usual I
[49:23] forgot to set a timer how long has that
[49:24] been how long have I been preaching oh I
[49:26] would know okay I've been preaching 15
[49:28] minutes okay so let me do a 15-minute
[49:30] timer let's see if we can do an hour and
[49:31] five minutes or something
[49:32] like that let's see if it's possible
[49:35] so
[49:36] um
[49:37] because I believe the seven Thunders
[49:39] already happened
[49:41] they believe their future
[49:43] okay
[49:44] but my quote for this was from Brother
[49:46] Branham brother Branham said all this
[49:48] was he said the seven Thunders were
[49:50] already in the past
[49:53] so let me read that here um
[49:55] brother Adam said Revelation 10 1-7 was
[49:58] history it's already happened
[50:00] meaning the open book has already been
[50:02] brought to the earth and the Seven
[50:03] Thunders already uttered their voices
[50:06] they've already given the revelation of
[50:07] the Seven Seals
[50:09] so Brother Band preached those seven
[50:10] nights that was God thundering out amen
[50:13] like a lion Hallelujah
[50:15] oh my thank God
[50:18] now here's where he says it brother says
[50:20] it five months before he passes away
[50:21] what's happened upon Mount Sunset now
[50:24] Mount Sunset was where he got this the
[50:26] sword of the king
[50:28] which he called the third pole which was
[50:29] going to be the opening of the word
[50:31] right also could include preaching the
[50:34] souls that were lost right we only
[50:35] preach one sermon on that so hold it in
[50:37] prison now I wanna I wanna preach more
[50:38] on that I just can feeling led to go
[50:40] other places
[50:41] I feel kind of burned to get those also
[50:43] Mount Sunset was where uh he said he
[50:46] said he was caught up in that
[50:47] consolation of angels that's that cloud
[50:50] he said he was caught up into that
[50:53] you know there's two thoughts on that
[50:56] now when when on February 28th brother
[50:59] Branham was not in Arizona where the
[51:01] cloud was he was in Texas pleading for
[51:03] the life of a of a young uh young man
[51:06] who was sentenced to die and then God
[51:08] the judge heard him
[51:10] uh brother Hammond it was Joel Osteen's
[51:12] Father John Osteen
[51:14] Joel Osteen's father was with brother
[51:16] Branham pleading for the judge to spare
[51:19] this young boy's life he was a murderer
[51:21] he was all but he was the boy one of
[51:22] these guys one of the preachers sons so
[51:25] Joel Osteen's dad and brother Brian
[51:28] pleaded for the boy's life and the judge
[51:30] gave him just life in prison
[51:32] okay but anyways on February 28th
[51:34] whether man was in Texas sorry have I
[51:36] got these backwards
[51:39] now there's two possibilities
[51:42] Brother Brad said he was caught up in
[51:43] that cloud well either he was
[51:44] transported like Ezekiel on February
[51:46] 28th
[51:48] or seven days later when he got there
[51:50] and he saw it that's when he was
[51:53] transported up into it
[51:55] but either one it doesn't matter yeah
[51:57] okay so people criticize brother Brown
[51:59] they'll say well he wasn't there he was
[52:01] in Texas well that's true he wasn't
[52:02] there but he might have been there by
[52:04] mission right right if we believe the
[52:06] Bible it could have happened praise God
[52:08] Ezekiel was carried a hundred miles in a
[52:11] vision from chaudia he was carried from
[52:14] was it modern day Iraq or was Saudi
[52:16] Arabia
[52:17] I think it's all right zika was carried
[52:19] from Iraq back to Jerusalem 100 miles
[52:21] the Bible said God picked him up by his
[52:23] hair by Vision how does that happen
[52:26] and then he saw those uh he saw all the
[52:29] sun worshipers in Israel's Temple and
[52:32] yet his body is laying over there
[52:34] in chaudia
[52:37] and people make fun people preachers
[52:38] made fun of me on the internet because I
[52:40] believe that's possible
[52:41] well they can make fun of whatever they
[52:43] want I've got thus save the Lord praise
[52:45] God on marriage and divorce the church
[52:47] ages the Seven Seals hair and Holiness I
[52:50] got dust saved the Lord I'm standing
[52:51] with the Bible praise God
[52:53] and anyone who lives Godly in Christ
[52:55] Jesus shall suffer some form of
[52:57] persecution
[53:00] I don't care if anybody digital viral or
[53:02] not I just know that God will save the
[53:04] elect praise God and I'll do my part to
[53:06] get the elect to Heaven Hallelujah
[53:09] okay so it's either one either I was
[53:11] caught up by Vision on February 28th or
[53:14] seven days later no seven would be a
[53:15] good day
[53:16] it would have been March 7th or seven
[53:19] days later when he was there he was
[53:20] caught up now why is seven a good day
[53:22] because in ezek or in Exodus the cloud
[53:24] came down on Saturday night and seven
[53:26] days later Moses went up into the cloud
[53:28] so that's why March 7th might have been
[53:30] a good time when brother and went up in
[53:32] the cloud but it doesn't really matter
[53:34] okay and I'll share the reasons why
[53:38] what happened on Sunset mountain in
[53:40] Arizona it was God confirming his word
[53:42] what's all this noise about notice it's
[53:44] God fulfilling his promised word again
[53:45] of Revelation 10 1-7 and the days of the
[53:49] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[53:50] the mystery of God should be finished
[53:51] the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7
[53:54] the last message to the last Church age
[53:56] fulfills exactly in this age Saint Luke
[53:59] 17 30 the day when the son of man shall
[54:01] be revealed and then brother M goes
[54:03] through this Life Magazine here he goes
[54:05] to This Life magazine in that cloud
[54:06] picture
[54:07] talks about it for two paragraphs I sent
[54:09] to Emma yesterday that's why I know we
[54:11] were talking about it
[54:13] and the god of Heaven promised that
[54:15] evening time would have evening lights
[54:16] three years ago this ministry the
[54:19] mystery of Revelation 10 1-7
[54:21] he says was a was a prophecy what time
[54:24] is it sir brother man preached that on
[54:25] December 30th 1962. but now it's history
[54:29] it's past the promise is fulfilled what
[54:32] time is it sir and what's this
[54:34] attraction it's God fulfilling his word
[54:36] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:39] forever
[54:40] okay so brother random says Revelation
[54:43] 10 1-7 is fulfilled
[54:45] now let me show you that yeah here's the
[54:47] prophecies
[54:49] so here here's the date December 30th
[54:51] 1962. so this is two months before the
[54:54] cloud came down and brothers telling his
[54:56] church God is sending me out west amen
[54:59] now you know I got I had to send him out
[55:01] west because the other prophets had to
[55:03] be sent out to the desert
[55:05] Moses was sent out to the desert you
[55:07] were sent to the desert too buddy you
[55:09] got a good time for your life brother
[55:13] you were sent out to the desert to find
[55:15] God and then God sent you back east
[55:21] and then Paul
[55:24] had Christ and come back
[55:26] see so Brothers says sorry
[55:30] I'm so excited
[55:33] slow down
[55:35] Moses was sent to the desert to get the
[55:37] Commandments and Brogan said he wrote an
[55:39] Old Testament
[55:40] Paul was sent out to the desert met
[55:42] Jesus wrote A New Testament and brother
[55:44] Adam said his ministry as a prophet as
[55:47] the seven Church age messenger he says
[55:48] this is what house will you build me
[55:50] 1965. he said wouldn't it make sense if
[55:53] God's gonna finish all those Mysteries
[55:55] God would have to send a prophet out
[55:56] west and then send him back to give the
[55:58] revelation of the Seven Seals ah it's
[56:01] beautiful praise God Amen it's beautiful
[56:03] it fits the pattern praise God
[56:06] if it's the baron
[56:09] so brother Austin I was also telling
[56:10] brother Brooks he had numerous things
[56:11] like brother Branham he was almost beat
[56:13] up no brother Brooks was beat up by a
[56:16] group of guys and wanted to kill him
[56:18] but God stopped brother Brooks from
[56:19] doing that
[56:20] same thing with brother Brandon brother
[56:22] brand was beat up by Boys he took the
[56:23] shotgun out to shoot him and none of
[56:24] them none of the shells would go off
[56:26] right and then as soon as they leave
[56:27] then they all go off
[56:30] um there's other things brother Brooks
[56:31] was telling me I was like brother your
[56:32] life's just like brother Brandon
[56:35] Hallelujah sorry keep looking my hands
[56:38] anyways here so here's a prophecy
[56:41] bro I was talking about that cloud he
[56:43] said I
[56:45] like wings traveling faster than sound
[56:47] could travel they come from eternity
[56:49] doesn't that sound like Revelation
[56:50] chapter 10. the mighty Angel comes down
[56:55] in a split like a 20 of an eye not
[56:57] enough to batch your eye just a twinkle
[56:59] they were there I didn't have time to
[57:01] count I didn't have time no more than
[57:03] just a look mighty ones great powerful
[57:05] angels snow white wing set and heads and
[57:09] they were woo-woo and when it did I was
[57:11] caught up into this pyramid of
[57:12] constellations
[57:14] okay so that's what that cloud is it
[57:16] looks like a pyramid right looks like a
[57:18] pyramid
[57:19] and it's snow white it's a white cloud
[57:22] so he says that yeah he says that
[57:25] now and then at the end of the sermon
[57:27] he's this is like a three hour four hour
[57:28] sermon
[57:29] and he calls this the seven Thunder
[57:31] sermon as a second name
[57:33] because he's talking about Revelation 10
[57:36] 1-7 he's talking about God commissioning
[57:38] him to preach the seven church I'm sorry
[57:40] the Seven Seals
[57:42] right
[57:44] now look what he says church I'm
[57:45] standing in an awful place but if but if
[57:47] you knew it remember I tell you in the
[57:49] name of the Lord I've told you the truth
[57:51] and something is fixing to happen
[57:53] so it's thus saith the Lord this vision
[57:57] he called it Snow White pyramid see
[57:59] brother man's critics will say he didn't
[58:00] say cloud well he said a snow white
[58:02] pyramid
[58:03] isn't that what it was doesn't God come
[58:06] down in clouds of course
[58:10] no this is January is this is a month
[58:12] later this is uh 15 days later
[58:15] January 14 1963.
[58:18] um here in Phoenix tonight in the name
[58:19] of the Lord now how many preachers have
[58:21] you heard say that
[58:22] I come here in the name of the Lord
[58:25] brother Brown said he always waited on
[58:27] God to send him to places because when
[58:29] he got to the pulpit he could say I'm
[58:30] here in the name of the Lord no that's
[58:33] that's a different kind of message right
[58:34] there
[58:35] Hallelujah now I can say like this I
[58:37] believe I'm here in Akron In The Name Of
[58:39] The Lord
[58:40] because I'm feeding God's sheep the word
[58:42] of God
[58:43] Hallelujah
[58:45] I didn't send myself here God sent me
[58:47] here hallelujah
[58:48] he said I would not try to explain
[58:49] what's happened many of you people that
[58:50] take the tapes be sure to get that one
[58:52] what time is it sir that was just before
[58:54] I left home a vision sent me here yes I
[58:56] don't know I don't I'm not a tape
[58:58] salesman I'm not I don't stress those
[59:00] things like me I'm not a book salesman
[59:01] even though I write books I'm not a book
[59:02] salesman I don't stress it
[59:04] we get them and we got to take business
[59:06] around the world wait until the jungles
[59:07] everywhere they had the little something
[59:09] put up in their ears they got they can
[59:10] tape into the tape and stand there and
[59:12] translate that right into the language
[59:14] and it goes around the world
[59:16] now the photograph of that cloud was
[59:19] photographed let's see 14. a month and
[59:22] uh two six weeks later
[59:25] so he gives two prophecies right twice
[59:28] he says in the name of the Lord
[59:29] something's going to happen Snow White
[59:31] pyramids seven angels God's gonna do
[59:34] something and it happened praise God
[59:37] okay now on the video it's only 14
[59:40] minutes
[59:42] here's four reasons I believe this Cloud
[59:43] was Supernatural brother branham's
[59:45] reputation as a faithful Bible teacher
[59:49] let me just put my two cents in right
[59:50] here
[59:51] I wrote this book on purpose and
[1:00:01] I purposely put less a brother and
[1:00:04] quotes in it so I could prove to
[1:00:05] everyone brother's message was the Bible
[1:00:07] praise God
[1:00:10] and um on my personal website I have I
[1:00:12] have a a PDF for every chapter with all
[1:00:15] the brother and quotes in it that back
[1:00:17] up the Bible truths that are in this
[1:00:19] book praise God
[1:00:21] because the guy told me I can't write a
[1:00:22] the book gets too thick if I put all
[1:00:24] programs quotes in here this book would
[1:00:26] be like this thing
[1:00:28] too thick
[1:00:30] so he said you gotta shorten it I said
[1:00:31] okay I'll take some things happen
[1:00:33] but I purposely Wonder just like my
[1:00:35] modesty book I purposely wanted everyone
[1:00:37] to see that modesty is a Bible teaching
[1:00:41] and God just used brother random to show
[1:00:43] it to us praise God
[1:00:46] and I still this day challenge all those
[1:00:48] haters out questions and haters all
[1:00:50] those accusers about around somebody
[1:00:52] read my my books and show me where I'm
[1:00:54] wrong
[1:00:55] and to this day none of them will do it
[1:00:57] now who's right and who's wrong
[1:00:58] I'll listen to their stuff brother
[1:01:00] Austin they won't hear anything I say
[1:01:02] who's right and who's wrong I think I'm
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:04] because I'm not afraid of their things
[1:01:05] they're afraid of my stuff
[1:01:07] because it's all the Bible
[1:01:10] okay
[1:01:11] and like I said I said
[1:01:14] when was the last time they listened to
[1:01:15] Brothers sermons he will weep and cry
[1:01:17] for 15 minutes or 30 minutes and plea
[1:01:20] with people to repent and get right with
[1:01:21] Christ where do you see these people
[1:01:22] doing it that have left the message
[1:01:25] where do you see you don't see them
[1:01:26] doing that
[1:01:27] they laugh and make jokes and they're
[1:01:29] they make they make fun of brother Brown
[1:01:31] they call them names they mock him all
[1:01:32] these kind of things where's the real
[1:01:33] love for Jesus Christ
[1:01:35] the second reason I believe it was
[1:01:37] Supernatural
[1:01:38] I just showed you those two quotes there
[1:01:40] was prophecy
[1:01:41] the third reason is if you have six
[1:01:43] extra hours of time
[1:01:46] you can listen to this guys I think he
[1:01:48] preaches three sermons on it
[1:01:50] he works in water so he knows all about
[1:01:52] clouds and water he heats water I guess
[1:01:55] he's a message believer in South
[1:01:57] Carolina
[1:01:58] and he showed how the cloud was too high
[1:02:00] it was too wide it was too dense all
[1:02:03] these things there's no clouds that can
[1:02:04] be formed at 28 miles high you can't no
[1:02:08] there's no clouds that high none
[1:02:10] he said man don't even have the power to
[1:02:12] get him up there
[1:02:14] he said you can't get up there he said
[1:02:16] it has to be a supernatural cloud
[1:02:19] and as one proof
[1:02:21] all the haters of brother Rams started
[1:02:23] making comments mocking him and church I
[1:02:26] was a witness he wrote back in love to
[1:02:28] every one of them and say oh well may
[1:02:30] God forgive you of that and I said well
[1:02:31] who's got the real fruit of Christ
[1:02:35] their comments were well well NASA and
[1:02:37] the Army proved it was a Thor rocket
[1:02:41] and he's like I he said that that's
[1:02:43] their that's just data he said I work
[1:02:45] with water here's all the facts he said
[1:02:47] you do the facts and he said God bless
[1:02:50] you at the end
[1:02:51] I like that he's got the real character
[1:02:54] of Christ
[1:02:57] and he's got all that scientific
[1:02:58] evidence it's way over my head I'm not
[1:03:01] that smart
[1:03:02] but if you want to watch it that's the
[1:03:03] thing to go watch
[1:03:05] oh yeah I had people this week watching
[1:03:06] my video uh they watched my video on it
[1:03:09] and they said wow I went back and
[1:03:11] watched that whole thing all my doubts
[1:03:12] are dissolved about the cloud whether it
[1:03:14] was from God or not I said praise God
[1:03:16] that's what I'm here for
[1:03:17] I'm here to point people to the truth
[1:03:22] now the fourth reason
[1:03:24] and I've dedicated the last two years of
[1:03:26] my life to this
[1:03:28] the fourth reason I believe the cloud
[1:03:29] was Supernatural because God gave
[1:03:31] brother Ram a supernatural revelation of
[1:03:33] the Seven Seals
[1:03:35] there's at least 38 differences between
[1:03:37] brother Branham and Clarence Larkin
[1:03:39] Charles Hayes Russell and Uriah Smith on
[1:03:41] the Seven Seals
[1:03:43] okay
[1:03:44] and there's way more than that because
[1:03:46] with each seal uh brother Ram's accusers
[1:03:48] only use one of those preachers not all
[1:03:51] three but one of them so that means on
[1:03:53] each seal that we I could compare
[1:03:55] brother Brown to the two other ones and
[1:03:56] that'd be even more differences
[1:03:58] there's probably 50 or 60 differences
[1:04:02] Hallelujah
[1:04:04] there's my uh hour and five minutes okay
[1:04:07] let me do another 15 minute loop I think
[1:04:09] I'll be done by that time
[1:04:10] now I put four additional points on
[1:04:12] there
[1:04:13] this case is ultimately the accuser's
[1:04:16] words versus brother Branham and brother
[1:04:17] Ram is not here to defend himself
[1:04:20] and government data and records are not
[1:04:22] infallible right the government said if
[1:04:24] you get the coveted shot you won't get
[1:04:26] coveted well guess what
[1:04:28] they all found out the government was
[1:04:30] lying
[1:04:31] what about the JFK assassination they
[1:04:33] still won't tell us all the details on
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:35] the September 11th attacks they still
[1:04:37] won't give us the details on that but
[1:04:38] you can watch the bombs that that those
[1:04:40] buildings bombs went off all the way
[1:04:42] down it wasn't just a plane knocked down
[1:04:45] the wall the building it'd be impossible
[1:04:47] they had fortified steel it's bombs it
[1:04:50] was an inside job it was a job done by
[1:04:52] the US government
[1:04:53] they lie about that
[1:04:55] how about the hunter Biden laptop they
[1:04:57] said also that was a lie now they say
[1:04:59] it's all real
[1:05:04] I'll Trust the government when the
[1:05:05] government comes in in the millennium
[1:05:07] Hallelujah that's what I'm gonna trust
[1:05:09] the government
[1:05:10] Hallelujah
[1:05:12] a righteous Governor Hallelujah he's got
[1:05:14] a ride of iron ruling all the nations
[1:05:16] hallelujah amen
[1:05:19] and and people say the second thing
[1:05:22] people say well brother man said he was
[1:05:23] under the cloud and he wasn't even there
[1:05:25] I said well maybe but he never said thus
[1:05:27] said the Lord I was under the cloud so
[1:05:29] it doesn't even matter at some point he
[1:05:31] was under the cloud but he didn't say
[1:05:33] when
[1:05:34] with thou saith the Lord he'll say now
[1:05:36] saith the Lord on February 28th I was
[1:05:37] under there he just said I was under it
[1:05:40] and church you all know this
[1:05:42] try to remember something happened last
[1:05:44] week and tell me all the details that
[1:05:45] happened last week
[1:05:47] I can't remember what happened yesterday
[1:05:49] what did we eat yesterday where'd you
[1:05:50] buy Walmart
[1:05:53] like my wife tells me all the time I I
[1:05:55] forget details of stories I'll say my
[1:05:57] mom was healed of I can now I would say
[1:05:59] my mom was here to lung cancer but it's
[1:06:01] not lung cancer it's liver cancer I do
[1:06:03] it all the time
[1:06:04] I can't get all my stories right
[1:06:07] if he was in Visions all the time I give
[1:06:09] him credit for all that he remembered
[1:06:11] praise God because he remembered a lot
[1:06:14] he's got a way better memory than me
[1:06:17] but they criticized and like I told you
[1:06:19] Church they're in this day Satan's
[1:06:21] trying to get our eyes off the Bible and
[1:06:22] get our eyes on brother has mistakes
[1:06:27] right who's the accused of the brother
[1:06:29] Satan is the accuser the Brethren yeah
[1:06:31] right they ought to be thankful for what
[1:06:32] brother random did
[1:06:34] preach and reveal the word of God showed
[1:06:36] us the right water baptism the right
[1:06:37] godhead showed us how to defy the
[1:06:39] Antichrist spirit amen showed us how to
[1:06:41] worship praise God Amen
[1:06:43] showed us how to live a Godly holy life
[1:06:45] a life of modesty and Holiness thank God
[1:06:47] Hallelujah for brothers Ministry
[1:06:51] and again brother man could have been
[1:06:52] under the cloud like Ezekiel 8 15.
[1:06:55] and they say well brother Adam didn't
[1:06:56] say cloud before the event but he said a
[1:06:58] snow white pyramid which looks just like
[1:07:00] a cloud
[1:07:01] now just so you know and here's I'm
[1:07:02] gonna try to bring this down here
[1:07:04] the reason you know I differ with you
[1:07:06] know I'll just say precious brother and
[1:07:08] not just in this state around the world
[1:07:10] the reason I disagree is because there's
[1:07:12] 52 quotes on the Thunders
[1:07:15] and brothers says lots of different
[1:07:16] things about the Thunders
[1:07:18] I remember when I preached on the latter
[1:07:20] rain last year remember I showed all the
[1:07:22] quotes on the latter ring
[1:07:24] and brother Adam said in some places the
[1:07:27] latter rain's already poured out and in
[1:07:29] some places the brother said Lord pour
[1:07:30] us around Atlanta rain tonight and then
[1:07:32] the church age book he said the latter
[1:07:33] rain is rapturing Phase rise to end time
[1:07:35] well you have quotes all over the place
[1:07:37] so what do you got to do go back to the
[1:07:39] word
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:41] so I I I've done the same thing when I
[1:07:44] preached this last time a year ago I
[1:07:46] went through all the 52 quotes and I
[1:07:48] just showed the highlights of them okay
[1:07:52] and so today I'm just going to re
[1:07:53] rehearse and then just show you a couple
[1:07:55] of ones that people have questions on
[1:07:57] or that uh
[1:07:58] that I've just respectfully disagreed
[1:08:00] with other people on
[1:08:02] so here's the here's the first there's
[1:08:04] two there's two quotes people most
[1:08:06] understand and the reason they
[1:08:07] misunderstand it is because Brothers
[1:08:09] connecting the seven Thunders to
[1:08:11] rapturing Faith
[1:08:13] in other words brother brother I'm
[1:08:15] saying we'll have rapturing faith when
[1:08:17] the seven Thunders are revealed
[1:08:20] that's why they say we're still waiting
[1:08:22] for the seven Thunders
[1:08:23] now these are real quotes
[1:08:26] but you got to see what did Brother
[1:08:27] random also say about the seven Thunders
[1:08:29] right okay
[1:08:31] so this is that same message where look
[1:08:33] he gives the vision he gave the vision
[1:08:35] of the pyramid the cloud
[1:08:37] with in the name of the Lord in the same
[1:08:39] sermon he says but this one didn't come
[1:08:41] from Earth he come down from heaven
[1:08:42] because the mystery is finished he's
[1:08:43] talking about the mighty angel of
[1:08:45] Revelation 10. and when the Mysteries
[1:08:47] finished the angel said time shall be no
[1:08:48] more and seven Thunders throw their
[1:08:50] voices out what now what if now this is
[1:08:53] not they'll say the Lord he said what if
[1:08:55] it is something to let us know how to
[1:08:56] enter into the rapturing faith
[1:09:01] what if the seven Thunders are something
[1:09:02] to help us know to enter the raspberry
[1:09:04] page what if they are we'll receive them
[1:09:05] because I'm praying every day for them
[1:09:07] I'm praying for Jesus Christ to guide me
[1:09:09] to all true so I know I'll get it praise
[1:09:11] God
[1:09:12] if their future but I believe they're
[1:09:13] already fast
[1:09:17] is it he said is it will we run and leap
[1:09:19] over walls he's quoting Joel
[1:09:22] now Church there's never been a time
[1:09:24] where Saints have leaped over walls
[1:09:26] men have Samson picked up Gates
[1:09:31] they've been given superhuman strength
[1:09:32] they've killed lions and bears but I
[1:09:35] don't remember anybody ever jumping over
[1:09:36] walls with super jumping power like
[1:09:38] Mario
[1:09:41] we might get it by the way
[1:09:44] you and I can jump over the walls
[1:09:46] we might but he but so I I believe Joel
[1:09:49] is actually a spiritual thing we'll jump
[1:09:52] over the walls of the obstacles in our
[1:09:53] lives you know like before the Rapture
[1:09:55] we'll have to
[1:09:57] I don't know if it's natural or not
[1:09:58] nobody knows that's why brother Ram
[1:10:00] didn't give us the save the Lord he
[1:10:01] didn't know
[1:10:03] but he's saying what if what if it is is
[1:10:05] it
[1:10:06] is it I don't know
[1:10:09] will we run leap over walls and is there
[1:10:11] something fixing to happen these all
[1:10:12] marred vile bodies are going to be
[1:10:14] changed can I live to see it oh Lord is
[1:10:16] it so close that I'll see it is this
[1:10:18] generation serves my brother what time
[1:10:19] is it another church was was Jeff what
[1:10:21] was brother Adam's Generation The
[1:10:23] Generation that saw the Rapture no
[1:10:25] no
[1:10:27] but he was hoping it was is it okay if
[1:10:29] you hope it is yes
[1:10:31] is it okay if I hope it is yes I hope
[1:10:33] it's in my generation but if it's not I
[1:10:36] hope it's in your generation
[1:10:38] right I hope it is now I hope I live
[1:10:41] long into your generation
[1:10:42] [Laughter]
[1:10:45] hope I get to 120 can you imagine me
[1:10:46] being 120.
[1:10:50] here's now here's one people really
[1:10:52] major on because it's in the seals
[1:10:54] sermons
[1:10:55] so this was four months later or three
[1:10:57] months later
[1:11:00] and then there's coming for seven
[1:11:01] mysterious Thunders that's not even
[1:11:03] written at all remember remember the
[1:11:05] Holy Ghost told John don't write what
[1:11:07] those Thunders were about
[1:11:13] he says I believe that through those
[1:11:15] seven Thunders will be revealed in the
[1:11:16] last days in order to get the bride
[1:11:18] together for rapturing faith because
[1:11:20] what we got right now we wouldn't be
[1:11:22] able to do it there's something we got
[1:11:23] to step further we can't have enough
[1:11:25] faith for Divine Healing Harley we got
[1:11:27] to have enough Faith to be changed in a
[1:11:29] moment and be swept out of this Earth
[1:11:30] and we'll find that after a while the
[1:11:31] Lord willing find where it's written
[1:11:34] okay so this is the quote different
[1:11:35] people will say well see
[1:11:37] you know we don't see a lot of Miracles
[1:11:38] so the seven Thunders must not be
[1:11:40] revealed
[1:11:42] well there's there's certain things that
[1:11:44] are keeping keep in mind here uh by
[1:11:46] God's grace
[1:11:48] you know we can't have enough faith for
[1:11:50] divine healing well when has God not
[1:11:52] healed our sick
[1:11:54] who's sick that hasn't been healed
[1:11:57] right now brother amen's battling right
[1:11:59] but he's a lot better by God's grace
[1:12:01] but remember God let Paul be sick a long
[1:12:03] time yeah
[1:12:04] yeah God let Timothy get often
[1:12:07] infirmities
[1:12:09] in his stomach
[1:12:11] I don't know if that relates to you
[1:12:12] brother but I just thought that it just
[1:12:13] came in right now that thine Austin
[1:12:15] infirmities
[1:12:17] right
[1:12:19] and yet is Jesus Christ the same
[1:12:20] yesterday today and forever absolutely
[1:12:27] regarding we got to have enough Faith to
[1:12:29] be changed in a moment now we got to
[1:12:31] balance this out because I showed I
[1:12:32] showed the church a quote
[1:12:34] um was it Wednesday night the Rapture
[1:12:35] will be an easy thing
[1:12:37] did I share that Wednesday night
[1:12:39] for the rest of the rash would be
[1:12:41] everything easy
[1:12:44] it'll be an easy thing so you got quotes
[1:12:46] on both sides so what do we do today we
[1:12:49] go back to the word of God gotta go back
[1:12:51] to the word we might leap over walls
[1:12:53] that might be part of it I don't know
[1:12:55] we don't know
[1:12:57] is it is it going to be in our
[1:12:58] generation I don't know
[1:13:00] but it could be tomorrow we gotta live
[1:13:02] like it's tomorrow praise God
[1:13:06] now
[1:13:07] look at that March 63.
[1:13:10] so these are the quotes some people use
[1:13:16] but there's two quotes after the seals
[1:13:19] that say the seven Thunders were the
[1:13:21] revelations already contained in the
[1:13:23] Seven Seals
[1:13:25] so that that's that's where I take a lot
[1:13:28] of Peace in that that and also brother
[1:13:30] said Revelation 10 1-7 is history
[1:13:32] so I've got two quotes plus another
[1:13:34] quote saying it's already in the past
[1:13:36] and the Seven Thunders already spoke in
[1:13:39] the Seven Seals
[1:13:41] so that's why I stand where I stand
[1:13:46] now I wanted to play this but I didn't
[1:13:48] get it recorded on my uh
[1:13:50] on my iPad they asked brother and you
[1:13:52] can hear Brothers says have the seven
[1:13:53] Thunders which equals seven Mysteries
[1:13:55] already been revealed
[1:13:56] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:13:58] but yet are not yet known to us as the
[1:14:01] Thunders yet
[1:14:03] now it's hard to know what it's hard to
[1:14:05] understand what this no means because
[1:14:07] there's numerous questions in here
[1:14:09] no but look what he says they were
[1:14:12] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[1:14:14] the Thunders was about
[1:14:17] okay
[1:14:19] and this is a year and what five months
[1:14:24] 17 months after he said the seven
[1:14:26] Thunders aren't known yet they're going
[1:14:28] to give us rapturing Faith 17 months
[1:14:30] later he said
[1:14:31] the seven Thunders were about the
[1:14:32] revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:14:35] they wish to reveal the seven Thunders
[1:14:37] out of their voices and no one could
[1:14:38] make out what it was John knew what it
[1:14:40] was but he's forbidden to write it he
[1:14:41] said but the seventh angel Hebrews of
[1:14:43] Revelation 10 7. and the seventh angel
[1:14:45] is a messenger to the seven Church ages
[1:14:47] see
[1:14:49] now church I wish you would have kept
[1:14:51] talking at that point
[1:14:53] do you you wish that dude
[1:14:55] yeah I wish you would have
[1:14:57] uh can you give a civil war program
[1:15:01] but when I read that I don't see him
[1:15:02] saying like oh they're gonna give us
[1:15:04] rapturing faith and you gotta
[1:15:06] you got to enter in that rapturing Faith
[1:15:08] through the seven Thunders I don't see
[1:15:09] him saying that
[1:15:12] okay remember Revelation 10 1-7 is
[1:15:14] history right seven Thunders have
[1:15:16] already sounded
[1:15:19] and then the church age book which I
[1:15:21] have quotes for brother says I read it
[1:15:22] through a couple times and then his
[1:15:25] daughter Rebecca Smith wrote a magazine
[1:15:26] article I think it was in 1990 and said
[1:15:29] she would read the church age book to
[1:15:30] him while they drove around the country
[1:15:32] and he would make comments and make
[1:15:34] Corrections and I think she said they
[1:15:36] did it five times all the way through
[1:15:37] that's a lot of reading now who's read
[1:15:39] the church age book five times don't
[1:15:40] raise your hands
[1:15:42] who's ready five times
[1:15:44] sister Rebecca said she read it through
[1:15:46] five times
[1:15:48] that's his daughter
[1:15:50] so brother man had to know what was in
[1:15:52] the book right he had to know it was in
[1:15:54] the church age book
[1:15:57] and so levale put the grammar on brother
[1:15:59] random sermons
[1:16:01] right
[1:16:02] levielle just took out all he he had he
[1:16:05] had all them typed out a sister it's on
[1:16:07] it's on the tapes a sister typed out the
[1:16:08] church ages and then levale took out all
[1:16:10] the duplicate stuff and he organized it
[1:16:13] and put it all together with good
[1:16:14] grammar brother Brown said
[1:16:17] LeBron said now this messenger of
[1:16:19] Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 is going to do
[1:16:21] two things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:16:24] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:16:25] the fathers how many hearts been turned
[1:16:27] to the apostolic fathers
[1:16:28] my heart has
[1:16:30] in every question I don't say oh uh what
[1:16:33] does uh what does my denomination say
[1:16:35] what does my grandpa say what does my
[1:16:37] grandma say I said what does the Bible
[1:16:39] say praise God
[1:16:41] that's how you know your heart's been
[1:16:43] turned back you go to the Bible for all
[1:16:44] your answers
[1:16:46] and number two what will the seven
[1:16:49] Church age messenger do he will reveal
[1:16:51] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:16:53] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:16:56] contained in the Seven Seals
[1:16:59] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:17:01] mystery truths that will literally turn
[1:17:04] the hearts of the children to the
[1:17:06] Pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:17:09] all right
[1:17:10] is that where I was going to stop
[1:17:13] I was going to stop about right there
[1:17:17] now in my past sermon let me say a
[1:17:18] couple more things here
[1:17:23] how do the Seven Seals turn our hearts
[1:17:25] back to the fathers so the Seven Seals
[1:17:28] do that because we can see we're under
[1:17:29] the force seal we have the Flying Eagle
[1:17:32] anointing and that helps us fly up
[1:17:34] Church into Heavenly places
[1:17:37] we Fly Above The Temptations of laodicea
[1:17:40] in other words you're not lukewarm
[1:17:42] you're on fire praise God Amen
[1:17:45] amen that's what that's the whole point
[1:17:48] you're an overcomer I thought your heart
[1:17:50] has turned back you believe the the
[1:17:52] prophet of this day brother random
[1:17:54] pointing us to the Bible and you believe
[1:17:55] the Bible revelations and it makes you
[1:17:57] spiritually on a higher plane than you
[1:17:59] used to be it makes you in a higher
[1:18:01] place than all the other churches praise
[1:18:03] God Amen it does
[1:18:06] and not to brag on ourselves or not to
[1:18:08] boast but because we've got thus saith
[1:18:10] the Lord it puts us on a higher plane
[1:18:12] than trinitarians
[1:18:13] right we're flying above the things of
[1:18:16] the world
[1:18:17] my trinitarian friends would go to
[1:18:19] church and my wife talked about it too
[1:18:21] when she hung around in the youth groups
[1:18:22] and those College youth groups they
[1:18:24] would talk about God and they'd go home
[1:18:25] and watch filthy movies
[1:18:27] dirty movies laugh and cuss and
[1:18:30] immorality but when we met Craig Booher
[1:18:32] and Dave Llewellyn and Simon Smith
[1:18:35] Hallelujah of course I knew my whole
[1:18:37] life but I met a new Simon after The Sea
[1:18:40] of
[1:18:40] they lived a real life praise God when I
[1:18:43] met Isaiah Brooks it was a different
[1:18:44] kind of person praise God that's why I
[1:18:46] told the Saints over there I never met a
[1:18:47] man like brother Isaiah Brooks talk of
[1:18:49] this message
[1:18:50] he was different than all the other
[1:18:52] preachers because all the other
[1:18:52] preachers were mainly motivated by what
[1:18:54] money and popularity yeah yeah and
[1:18:56] brother Brooks would stand there and
[1:18:58] rebuke us he rebuked the women for
[1:18:59] wearing uh uh I don't I don't know sexy
[1:19:02] clothes
[1:19:03] he sometimes he had brother Craig rebuke
[1:19:05] him for wearing high heels and
[1:19:06] everything like that Hallelujah
[1:19:10] I never heard that before
[1:19:12] I never heard a man preach like that but
[1:19:14] where do you find that you find that in
[1:19:15] the Bible praise God
[1:19:17] and all the other sins that men do and
[1:19:19] adultery and pornography I never heard a
[1:19:21] man preach like that
[1:19:23] it was God
[1:19:25] so that's how our hearts get turned we
[1:19:28] get the anointing of the Flying Eagle We
[1:19:31] Believe thus saith the Lord because we
[1:19:32] can find it in the Bible
[1:19:34] remember Church once again there's 31
[1:19:37] thus saith the Lords in this last
[1:19:39] chapter 31.
[1:19:41] how many does the Catholic Church have
[1:19:44] how many does the Pentecost have zero
[1:19:48] how many does the Baptist have with
[1:19:49] Austin zero
[1:19:51] we've got 31 Church a line has roared
[1:19:54] Hallelujah the lion is roared we've
[1:19:57] heard the voice of Christ the book is
[1:19:59] open to us today praise God
[1:20:01] like I said they'll say I asked my
[1:20:03] pastor uh can uh this was a good time a
[1:20:06] good example I said pastor can I get a
[1:20:08] tattoo he said talk to my wife that was
[1:20:10] a bad answer
[1:20:11] but anyway she pointed me to Leviticus
[1:20:13] 19.
[1:20:14] that was a good answer
[1:20:16] and either fear of God I didn't get a
[1:20:18] tattoo but any other Church oh yeah I
[1:20:20] went to the chapel because Austin I said
[1:20:21] can I get a tattoo they said sure that's
[1:20:22] just old legalistic requirement
[1:20:25] they didn't even consult the Bible they
[1:20:27] didn't even look in the Bible
[1:20:28] right but we look in the Bible why
[1:20:30] because our hearts have been turned back
[1:20:32] right now because the Bible's open to us
[1:20:34] praise God
[1:20:35] the Bible's open
[1:20:37] we can see the truth of God
[1:20:40] like people go to the church today and
[1:20:42] say can I marry a third time can I marry
[1:20:43] a fourth time they'll be back of course
[1:20:46] can I'm a man can I become a woman of
[1:20:47] course just come to church where our
[1:20:49] name is transformation so we can have
[1:20:51] trans trans is in our name so we can
[1:20:52] have trans people here that's what they
[1:20:54] say
[1:20:55] but what does the Bible say all right
[1:20:57] brother I'm saying on anointed ones the
[1:20:59] end time he said look at these young
[1:21:00] boys they're letting their hair grow
[1:21:01] like girls they're turning into girls
[1:21:03] and look where we are today
[1:21:06] look very hard today
[1:21:09] so hair was what the first step in
[1:21:12] becoming a man for a woman and a man
[1:21:14] becoming a woman hair was the first step
[1:21:17] changing the clothes was the first step
[1:21:19] to give a woman pass
[1:21:21] right then you cut her hair and she acts
[1:21:24] like a man and then she wants to
[1:21:25] transition and get surgery to become a
[1:21:27] man it's the first step these things
[1:21:29] happen slowly
[1:21:32] like the Bible said they have sowed they
[1:21:34] planted two of the wind and they're
[1:21:36] reaping the Whirlwind but we sow to the
[1:21:40] spirit and church what do we reap
[1:21:42] eternal life Hallelujah
[1:21:45] in Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:21:47] now you're all waiting for me to close
[1:21:48] I'm trying to close here by God's grace
[1:21:50] anything else I want to say
[1:21:55] the old questions yeah let me take
[1:21:57] questions
[1:21:58] this would be a great time for questions
