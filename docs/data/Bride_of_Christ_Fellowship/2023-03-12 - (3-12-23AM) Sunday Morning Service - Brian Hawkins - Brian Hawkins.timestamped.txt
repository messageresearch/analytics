[7:17] one more time
[7:19] uh God bless you
[7:21] and uh we'll just open up with a little
[7:24] word of prayer this morning
[7:28] Heavenly Father
[7:30] Lord assist with the thankful heart that
[7:32] we're here once again to be able to be
[7:34] here to minister your word O Father
[7:38] and the Lord and just
[7:41] think of all the things that you've done
[7:43] for us and who just want to tell you
[7:45] that we appreciate everything that you
[7:47] provide for us you've given us safe
[7:48] travel once again today and we ask the
[7:50] same for brother Jesse as he also
[7:52] returns to his home help us to do the
[7:54] same as we return to our home this
[7:57] evening but father until then we just
[8:00] pray that you would be with us through
[8:01] the day help us in through these
[8:03] services
[8:04] May the people be blessed and and may
[8:07] you be glorified
[8:09] father we just want to look unto you the
[8:10] author and finisher of our faith Lord we
[8:13] just call upon you that you would come
[8:14] and help us this morning to speak the
[8:17] Oracles of God and uh just there's
[8:20] nothing good in me now Lord I'm just the
[8:23] least of the least but Lord here I am
[8:25] and uh just to give my all this morning
[8:29] so father I just pray that you would
[8:31] help me to get out of the way that your
[8:33] spirit will speak to your people oh God
[8:35] father we ask all this in your precious
[8:37] name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[8:41] if you would turn with me to Genesis
[8:43] chapter 2
[8:47] .
[8:49] verse 18.
[8:56] Genesis 2 18.
[9:03] it says and the Lord God said
[9:08] it is not good that the man should be
[9:10] alone
[9:11] I will make him and help me for him
[9:15] and in verse 21
[9:17] it says and the Lord God caused a deep
[9:19] sleep to fall upon Adam
[9:22] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[9:25] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[9:30] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[9:32] from man made he a woman
[9:34] and brought her unto the man
[9:38] and Adam said this is now a bone of my
[9:40] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[9:42] called woman because she was taken out
[9:45] of man
[9:46] therefore shall a man leave his father
[9:48] and his mother as shall cleave unto his
[9:51] wife and they shall be one flesh
[9:54] you see
[9:57] the last time I was here
[9:59] uh
[10:03] I was going to speak on isolation and I
[10:07] guess brother Jesse
[10:08] preached at the the Wednesday before
[10:11] and I made a comment maybe I'll speak on
[10:13] that the next time I come out so uh I'd
[10:17] like to speak on isolation
[10:20] but not just isolation just a particular
[10:22] part of isolation I don't know exactly
[10:25] what brother Jesse had preached but uh
[10:28] what I'd what I'd like to really speak
[10:30] on is better is fellowship than solitude
[10:36] so we see in the opening scripture that
[10:39] that it's uh that it's not good that man
[10:41] should be alone right
[10:43] see we had the we know all the animals
[10:45] were in the garden and all the animals
[10:47] they were they were male and female the
[10:49] only one that didn't have a a companion
[10:52] or a partner was was the man correct
[10:55] so
[10:56] even the Lord said that man should not
[10:59] dwell alone but I'm going to make him a
[11:02] help meet I'm going to make him a
[11:03] partner I'm going to make him a
[11:05] companion
[11:09] so
[11:11] he needed some help he was all by
[11:13] himself
[11:16] but also the companionship is what he
[11:18] was missing
[11:21] in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 and verse 9.
[11:29] it says two are better than one
[11:31] because they have a good reward for
[11:33] their labor
[11:35] for if they fall the one will lift up
[11:37] his fellow but woe to him that is alone
[11:39] when he falleth
[11:41] for he hath not another to help him up
[11:44] again if two lie together then they have
[11:47] heat
[11:48] but how can one be warm alone
[11:51] and if one Prevail against him
[11:53] two shall withstand him and a three-fold
[11:56] cord is not quickly broken so we see
[11:59] that it's that it's important to not be
[12:02] by yourself but it's important to have
[12:05] somebody with you it's it's it's uh
[12:07] a statement that's popular that's
[12:10] probably reached probably all across the
[12:12] United States now but it's a very
[12:14] popular statement that many hands make
[12:16] light work so if if you if you're into a
[12:20] hard job if let's say we do wood so we
[12:24] we heat our house with wood so uh we'll
[12:27] cut wood we'll split wood we'll stack
[12:29] wood well to take on that responsibility
[12:32] by yourself as a as a daunting task so
[12:35] it's it's nice when you have help so it
[12:38] goes faster it goes easier and many
[12:41] hands make light work so it's it's good
[12:43] for a man not to to be alone because if
[12:45] something happened if you're if you're
[12:47] out in the woods if you're cutting wood
[12:48] something something like that cutting
[12:50] trees down if you're by yourself
[12:53] if you're by yourself and you get hurt
[12:56] there's nobody to call for help but if
[12:58] there's somebody with you there's
[12:59] somebody to give you Aid so that's
[13:01] that's kind of what that's talking about
[13:02] for if they fall uh one will lift up his
[13:05] fellow but woe to him that is alone when
[13:07] he falleth for Heath not another to help
[13:09] him up now you could attribute that as
[13:12] well to uh the spiritual realm so it's
[13:15] good to have an accountability partner
[13:16] somebody that you trust in because when
[13:19] you get into these situations if you
[13:21] fall into a Temptation it's good to have
[13:23] somebody get in your face and say hey
[13:25] knock it off uh there was uh there was a
[13:29] brother
[13:30] years ago he was in he was in some
[13:33] trouble and uh he kept doing things that
[13:36] uh
[13:38] that kept getting him in in further
[13:41] trouble and there was a time that I had
[13:43] to I had to get in his face pretty much
[13:45] and and I don't like confrontation
[13:46] believe it or not I don't like
[13:48] confrontation but uh I had to tell him I
[13:51] said brother you gotta stop doing this I
[13:53] didn't say it in such a calm voice but
[13:55] uh but I was concerned about his
[13:58] well-being and you know when you see
[14:01] somebody keep doing something to get
[14:03] themselves into trouble and then they
[14:04] you try to help them out and they still
[14:06] get themselves in trouble that's a time
[14:08] where you feel like you just got to get
[14:09] him a whole uh by the shirt collar and
[14:12] say hey wake up
[14:14] you know stop doing what you're doing
[14:16] and get right you know if you if you
[14:19] stop doing things that are that are
[14:21] wrong like this you're not going to be
[14:22] in trouble
[14:24] so it's good to have the the
[14:26] accountability partner it's it's good to
[14:29] not be in solitude
[14:30] so that's what teamwork is you know I've
[14:34] heard the saying and we've all heard it
[14:36] there's no I in team but a popular thing
[14:39] now no but there's an me so there's a
[14:41] mean team yeah but you have to rearrange
[14:43] the letters to to to make that a me you
[14:46] know you have to you have to go out on a
[14:49] far stretch to call it me now see a team
[14:52] works together as one even though one
[14:54] has uh one might have uh one strength
[14:58] another one might take for instance
[15:00] where I work somebody might be good at
[15:01] electrical somebody might be good at
[15:03] welding somebody might be good in the
[15:05] plc's somebody might be good at dealing
[15:08] with the people so is anyone better than
[15:12] the other one no but when you come
[15:14] together it makes a great team and then
[15:16] you're and then you're successful then
[15:19] you're prosperous
[15:20] see it's when you come together as one
[15:23] not one having something in their mind
[15:25] well I'm going to be successful in this
[15:27] and I don't care what everybody else is
[15:28] doing now see what what good would that
[15:30] do in a church body what good would that
[15:32] do in a church body if if one person is
[15:34] successful see if one person is
[15:36] successful then everybody else is is
[15:38] Left Behind
[15:40] see that's where it works to to uh each
[15:43] person be in their place as a team and
[15:45] you mesh together as a team and then you
[15:47] you have further progress as one body
[15:52] I've kind of got a little ahead of
[15:53] myself but that's okay
[15:55] let's turn to uh Proverbs chapter 18.
[15:59] now see that there's we're talking about
[16:01] isolation so uh
[16:03] there's a way that uh you could have
[16:06] willful isolation
[16:09] and it's
[16:11] from others and isolating from the body
[16:14] so Proverbs 18 and verse 1 it says
[16:18] through desire
[16:20] a man
[16:21] having separated himself see it's a
[16:24] man's desire and that's where it comes
[16:26] into that that's where it comes into the
[16:28] fault it's through a man's desire that's
[16:31] where the fall comes because the desire
[16:33] is left
[16:34] to serve God so through desire a man
[16:38] having separated himself seeketh an
[16:40] inner medalist with all wisdom see
[16:43] through desire seeketh that that's
[16:45] seeking self-gratification see that's
[16:48] selfishness but see an intermedolith
[16:52] with wisdom it means to to rush on to
[16:55] Russia uh to be against all wisdom and
[16:58] what is valuable
[17:01] see interfering with others others uh
[17:03] other people's Affairs you know which
[17:06] starts a lot of fights
[17:08] see intermittent being a busybody
[17:10] you know you have somebody that that
[17:12] goes and Chit Chats with this one and
[17:14] gossips with this one it does this one
[17:15] here and it's just inserting
[17:19] an isolation from each other it's
[17:21] breaking up the team
[17:23] see that's what that's what this is
[17:25] talking about see self-gratification
[17:26] will eventually come against wisdom and
[17:29] viciously if you spend your time looking
[17:31] at what unbelievers think of this word
[17:33] you will more than likely Fall prey to
[17:36] their ungodly philosophical ways
[17:39] now see if in another translation of
[17:42] Proverbs 18 and 1 and it's in the Bible
[17:45] in basic English it says he who keeps
[17:48] himself separate for his private purpose
[17:51] goes against all good sense
[17:55] see it's self-serving
[17:58] now if we go to Hebrews chapter 10 and
[18:00] verse 24 it says and let us consider one
[18:03] another to provoke unto love and the
[18:06] good works that's what we ought to be
[18:08] doing not not provoking one another to
[18:10] anger
[18:11] not reviling back when reviled but
[18:14] provoking one another unto love and to
[18:16] good works and not forsaking the
[18:19] assembling of ourselves together as the
[18:21] manner of some is but exhorting one
[18:24] another and so much the more as we see
[18:26] the day approaching so do we not see the
[18:29] day approaching of the Rapture time it's
[18:31] got to be coming soon
[18:33] I believe it you know just seeing
[18:36] everything that's happening in this day
[18:37] something's got to give sooner or later
[18:39] it's got to be coming soon but are we
[18:42] ready
[18:42] are we ready are we forsaking ourselves
[18:45] uh from this from the body of Christ are
[18:48] we drawing closer to one another
[18:51] saying hey we've got to get right we've
[18:54] got to stay right stay into the word
[18:55] stay into the prayer
[18:58] stay in the seeking lost souls amen
[19:03] Romans chapter 12.
[19:11] and verse 3 it says for I say through
[19:15] the grace given unto me to every man
[19:18] that is among you not to think of
[19:20] himself more highly
[19:22] than he ought to think
[19:25] but to think soberly according as God
[19:28] had dealt to every man The Measure of
[19:30] Faith for as we have many members and
[19:33] one body
[19:34] and all members have not the same office
[19:36] so we being many are one body in Christ
[19:39] and everyone members of one another see
[19:43] one body many members see it's like what
[19:48] I was talking about it's a team right
[19:49] it's a family we work together as a
[19:52] family
[19:53] but we work as one like I said we we all
[19:56] have different functions see your foot
[19:57] your foot carries the body
[20:00] the hand will reach down and get some
[20:02] food to feed the body the elbow works at
[20:05] a different different function right so
[20:07] every part of our body works a different
[20:10] function they all aren't called to do
[20:12] the same thing if we are if it was all
[20:15] called to do the same thing we'd
[20:16] probably just be like this
[20:19] not doing anything you're not going
[20:21] anywhere you just be set there like a
[20:23] lump
[20:24] but every thank you brother but every
[20:28] person
[20:29] we have all these different callings we
[20:31] have the five-fold ministry right we
[20:33] have Apostles we have pastors we have
[20:35] teachers we have evangelists we have all
[20:37] these different things but they all work
[20:40] they they all do something different but
[20:42] they all work for the same purpose see
[20:44] all the all these members of one body
[20:46] it's it's one body this is my body these
[20:49] are my fingers they're not Lydia's
[20:50] fingers they're not Malachi's fingers
[20:52] these are my fingers this is one body
[20:54] that's a second body that's a third body
[20:56] so they're all different
[20:59] but we all work for the same purpose for
[21:02] the benefit of the body right we have to
[21:04] eat so then we have to work to get the
[21:06] food to eat
[21:08] see it works for a purpose
[21:12] now see that there was another way of of
[21:14] isolation and that was for to quarantine
[21:17] right
[21:18] I'm just going through different
[21:19] different types of isolation
[21:21] so to place into quarantine in Leviticus
[21:25] chapter 13 and 46
[21:33] am I going too fast
[21:37] Leviticus 13 and 46 it says all the days
[21:40] wherein the plague shall be in him
[21:43] he shall be defiled he is unclean he
[21:47] shall dwell alone see being isolated
[21:50] without the camp showers habitation be
[21:53] see how many like how many like being
[21:55] isolated during during coven you know
[21:58] you couldn't go anywhere
[22:00] you couldn't do anything you couldn't go
[22:02] meet up with with people or at least you
[22:04] weren't supposed to there were some that
[22:06] didn't pay attention to it but oh but I
[22:09] I I wonder how many marriages
[22:12] were broken because they actually had to
[22:14] spend time together
[22:16] I wonder how many uh how many families
[22:19] were broken
[22:21] because I had to spend time together
[22:23] but on the other on the flip side of
[22:26] that how many marriages were brought
[22:28] together closer because they had to
[22:30] spend more time with each other
[22:32] how many families were brought together
[22:34] closer
[22:35] see it's all on what we value what we
[22:38] place our value on
[22:40] do we love our family or do we love our
[22:42] job or do we love God do we love what is
[22:45] our value
[22:48] or what do we place our value in but see
[22:51] isolate
[22:53] everybody I don't know brother Jesse has
[22:56] preached but uh isolate it means to to
[22:59] be alone or apart as in being
[23:02] inaccessible or unable to move about
[23:11] see that's talking about blocking off
[23:13] like a a a a crime scene or a fire a car
[23:16] accident that's that's blocking it
[23:18] making it unaccessible
[23:20] now see we as men and women we do the
[23:22] same thing we get a little hurt we get a
[23:25] little offended and then we draw off
[23:26] from other people and then you become
[23:28] unaccessible nobody could talk to you
[23:31] nobody can encourage you uh you become
[23:34] uh what's the word I'm looking for uh
[23:37] you get you become prickly you know uh
[23:40] because you've you've drawn withdrawn
[23:42] yourself from everything
[23:45] so
[23:47] it also means to like we just read to
[23:49] place a new quarantine that's also
[23:51] isolation uh to cause to become socially
[23:55] or politically
[23:57] unengaged or ostracized
[24:01] ostracizes anybody know what Austin does
[24:03] everybody know what ostracizer ostrich
[24:06] push us head in the ground anyway
[24:08] and he thinks he's isil he evidently he
[24:11] thinks that nobody could see him because
[24:12] he's got his head in the ground but
[24:15] never mind I'll skip that one
[24:19] to be free from external influence uh
[24:24] talking about government issue there uh
[24:27] communist a dictatorship things like
[24:30] that that uh I I think of uh the one
[24:34] Korea I want to say is South Korea to
[24:37] where they they kind of shut them off
[24:39] from the whole world they don't allow
[24:42] any they don't allow anything uh any
[24:44] news any uh outside internet they won't
[24:47] let them see anything because that's
[24:49] it's a whole control they're trying to
[24:51] isolate that one certain group and then
[24:53] they put forth their own propaganda
[24:55] to get them to believe what they want
[24:57] them to believe
[24:58] because they want to have the control
[25:00] over the people
[25:04] excuse me
[25:06] to identify or distinguish as a separate
[25:10] entity or group now we know with Abraham
[25:13] that the Lord told him look separate
[25:16] yourself you know from lot right so
[25:18] there was a separation there there was
[25:19] an isolation but that's another Avenue
[25:21] that we have to go is we have to isolate
[25:24] ourselves from Evil right so
[25:27] uh let us turn to first Thessalonians
[25:29] chapter five
[25:31] and and verse 18.
[25:37] it says in everything give thanks which
[25:41] we should do that
[25:42] as Believers we should give them thanks
[25:44] in everything for this is the will of
[25:46] God in Christ Jesus concerning you
[25:48] quench not the spirit despise not
[25:51] prophesying prove all things and hold
[25:54] fast that which is good abstain from all
[25:58] appearance of evil anything that looks
[26:01] like it's evil or anything that looks
[26:03] like you shouldn't be doing stay away
[26:05] from it brother Brandon said if there's
[26:06] any doubt don't do it stay away from it
[26:10] if it doesn't look like a Godly thing
[26:13] then abstain from it stay away from it
[26:16] isolate yourself from the thing we have
[26:18] to be separators from unbelief amen see
[26:22] uh doing what I do we isolate uh fluid
[26:26] power that could be air that could be
[26:29] water that could be oil that could be
[26:31] Hydraulics that could be different
[26:33] things anything that that pertains to
[26:35] fluid see what and and to be able to
[26:37] isolate uh certain things
[26:40] uh we isolate because
[26:43] we try to prevent uh
[26:45] harm personal injury
[26:49] or worldly influence we isolate these
[26:52] things for a purpose so we don't get
[26:54] into those things uh I'm just going to
[26:56] reference work because that's what I
[26:58] deal with so we shut off these a ball
[27:02] valve a gate valve or whatever power is
[27:05] driving that that particular piece of
[27:07] equipment you shut everything off
[27:10] that's called isolation
[27:12] and it's shutting the power off
[27:15] so it doesn't inadvertently uh become
[27:18] energized and squish you dismember you
[27:22] anything causing any kind of a harm to
[27:25] you these things must be done
[27:27] are you going to get hurt
[27:29] or killed see that's how important an
[27:32] isolation could be
[27:34] see we might set somebody aside uh in in
[27:37] isolation maybe they were uh in a prison
[27:41] uh they might have been bad in prison
[27:44] you ever hear a solitary solitary
[27:46] confinement see we put people or they
[27:48] put people in solitary confinement
[27:50] because they were uncontrollable
[27:53] they were doing something that they
[27:54] shouldn't have been doing so they're put
[27:56] in solitary confinement which is
[27:57] actually a punishment
[27:59] now some people might say
[28:01] oh man that would be good just to be
[28:03] away from everybody but after a while if
[28:06] you don't have contact with somebody
[28:09] you become stir crazy
[28:11] see 30 days in the hole might seem like
[28:13] a good idea
[28:17] but it's actually
[28:18] making them think kind of like how
[28:20] parents send you to your room all by
[28:22] yourself right to think about what
[28:23] you've done you know that's never
[28:25] happened to any children in here right
[28:29] but what do you do if you're in that if
[28:32] you're in that room by yourself and you
[28:34] can't have anything that you like you
[28:36] know things are taken away from you so
[28:39] you're thinking about what you did hmm
[28:41] if they if I did that and their course
[28:45] of action was that I don't think I want
[28:47] to do that again
[28:49] now some people now see that's a that's
[28:51] a type of a correction act action uh but
[28:55] some people just think of a clever more
[28:57] clever way to get away with something
[29:02] now see
[29:03] when we're free from the blood of Christ
[29:05] take Barabbas for instance if when he
[29:07] was released if he was and he was free
[29:09] because we know that him and Christ
[29:11] swapped roles right because Barabbas was
[29:15] set to die
[29:16] right he was in prison he was going to
[29:18] go under capital punishment but he was
[29:20] set free
[29:22] so being set free we know that he was a
[29:25] murderer and a thief he was just an evil
[29:27] man so being set free he might have said
[29:30] to himself wow I'm free I'm going to go
[29:33] kill again I'm going to go steal again
[29:36] I'll see there was nothing that changed
[29:38] I see
[29:40] same thing with the with our Christian
[29:41] wall we say we receive the Holy Spirit
[29:44] but then we go right back like a hog to
[29:47] a swallowing the dog to his vomit
[29:49] now see what took place
[29:51] did the Holy Spirit really come amen
[29:55] yeah
[29:56] but see that that's the isolation
[29:58] putting people in isolation as far as a
[30:00] prison because they they were not uh
[30:03] profitable for the community you know
[30:06] they they broke the law so now they're
[30:07] going in they're isolated from general
[30:09] population from the communities and into
[30:12] the prison right
[30:13] so that was to uh protect the people of
[30:16] the community
[30:18] now so kind of going back with the fluid
[30:20] power uh we have to do the same thing
[30:22] with electricity we work with 480 volts
[30:25] uh which is a lot of voltage you think
[30:27] your power outlet hurts when it shocks
[30:29] you if you get shocked with 480 you
[30:31] probably won't lift to tell how bad it
[30:33] hurt
[30:34] so you have to shut off that that as
[30:38] well and just kind of an experience that
[30:41] we had that we had a a gentleman there
[30:44] uh doing some things that he wasn't he
[30:47] shouldn't have been doing uh
[30:51] so he was he was we have these wire
[30:53] trays and they've got all kinds of
[30:55] electrical wires in it they uh it's you
[30:57] can run the trade so you don't really
[30:59] have to run conduit you don't have to
[31:00] put it through a pipe but through these
[31:03] wire trays he he was going through uh
[31:06] one particular wire tray and he didn't
[31:10] shut off the power he couldn't shut off
[31:12] the power because we're running and our
[31:15] process can't shut down we I work at the
[31:17] glass I work at a glass factory so our
[31:19] process can't shut down if we shut down
[31:20] that that means millions of dollars that
[31:22] we're we're losing
[31:24] so this this gentleman he decided to get
[31:28] he was mining is what he was doing is he
[31:30] was getting copper Wired from wires that
[31:34] were no longer used so he was going to
[31:37] take it in and scrap it while this is
[31:39] not a way for for a person to do it
[31:42] so he was reaching into the wire tray
[31:44] and he was using a grinder to cut
[31:46] through and uh very very very very bad
[31:49] idea to do
[31:51] uh he didn't get hurt but he ended up
[31:53] nicking one of the wires that were that
[31:55] was active and like I said that's 480
[31:58] volts going through there
[32:00] but he is very fortunate that he is
[32:03] alive today he doesn't have a job there
[32:06] anymore but he's he's alive
[32:09] so because he was doing something that
[32:11] he he shouldn't have been doing
[32:13] so what happened was when you when you
[32:16] break that continuity
[32:18] you lose power so it's like somebody
[32:21] going through and just cutting the wire
[32:23] to the switch it's like turning the
[32:25] switch off because you have no more
[32:26] power so
[32:28] he almost shut us down
[32:31] so that that's how very important uh an
[32:34] isolation an important isolation can be
[32:37] because he could have got hurt and he
[32:40] almost shut us down which which would
[32:41] have been very very bad
[32:48] y'all ever hear of Alcatraz
[32:51] say Alcatraz is a is a prison that they
[32:54] that they had years ago
[32:56] but it was off of the Mainland it was
[32:58] just it's just an island right so it's
[33:00] just an island and that's all that was
[33:01] there was a prison that's all that was
[33:03] there so there's another there's another
[33:05] type of isolation now see and as we read
[33:08] in the scripture we know that John uh
[33:11] was sent to the he was isolated from
[33:13] people because they thought that he was
[33:14] preaching blasphemy but uh but we know
[33:17] that he was preaching truth so they put
[33:19] him on the island of Patmos right so
[33:20] it's the same kind of a deal
[33:23] uh
[33:26] I'll see when when uh when I'm talking
[33:28] about the the shutting off the the flow
[33:30] kind of getting back I know I'm jumping
[33:32] all over so my apologies but kind of
[33:35] getting back to that uh when you shut
[33:37] off the flow uh you're controlling that
[33:40] so you can control the flow
[33:43] of God
[33:45] or you can control the flow of Satan
[33:49] but we are the ones who do that we are
[33:51] the ones in control of that because we
[33:53] either disbelieve God and separate us
[33:56] ourselves from God
[33:59] or we fight against Satan which one are
[34:02] we shutting off which one are we
[34:04] allowing to have control over our lives
[34:07] see we control that flow
[34:10] it's not somebody else
[34:12] yeah
[34:20] everybody okay this morning
[34:23] so when we
[34:24] we want that flow of God we want that
[34:27] channel we want that continuity to be
[34:30] maintained right we want to keep that
[34:32] flow coming
[34:33] you know in the scripture talked about
[34:35] they addicted themselves so we must
[34:38] addict ourselves to God right so
[34:41] it doesn't mean that we uh like we're
[34:44] taught in in the scripture that we
[34:46] should get alone and and pray with God
[34:48] right
[34:49] so
[34:51] 40 days Moses and Jesus got got alone
[34:54] with God
[34:55] so there there's a type of isolation
[34:58] there which is a good type of isolation
[35:00] they weren't uh withdrawing themselves
[35:02] socially or from the rest of the
[35:04] brothers and sisters because they were
[35:06] mad or or they were upset or something
[35:07] happened but they were withdrawing
[35:09] themselves to get into the presence of
[35:11] God you know they weren't forsaking the
[35:13] assembly the assembling of one another
[35:15] but they were getting alone with God and
[35:18] in Matthew chapter 6 of verse 18
[35:22] it is saying that that thou appear not
[35:25] unto men to fast but unto thy father
[35:28] which is in secret see we got we have to
[35:30] get away from people we have to get away
[35:33] from the things of the world we rub
[35:34] shoulders with the world every day if
[35:36] you go to work you're rubbing shoulders
[35:38] with the world every day you come home
[35:41] you know we need we need to get we need
[35:43] to have that little break
[35:45] but it's getting with the Father which
[35:47] is in secret and thy father which seeth
[35:50] uh which seeth in secret shall reward
[35:53] thee openly
[35:55] but it's good to be alone with God
[35:57] so
[36:00] sometimes we need to get a loan uh we
[36:02] need to draw ourselves away from from
[36:04] other people because we just need that
[36:06] that time to reset we need we need that
[36:08] time to have a refocus if you get into
[36:11] that uh that position where you're where
[36:14] you're kind of getting into that oh I
[36:16] feel like I'm backsliding and you're
[36:18] saying well I don't want to go there I
[36:20] know that's wrong I don't want to go
[36:21] there so what's happening in my life
[36:23] what what is going on why do I keep
[36:25] doing this why why does this keep
[36:27] happening that's a time that you need to
[36:29] separate yourself take a step back and
[36:32] hit reset
[36:34] you know it's a time to to refocus and
[36:37] get back to the basics right I think
[36:39] brother Brandon taught at his uh ABC you
[36:42] know getting back to the ABCs always
[36:43] believe Christ
[36:46] but it's it's not appearing unto men to
[36:49] fast or to pray you know we're not out
[36:51] there broadening our phylacteries and
[36:53] and things like that and and making a
[36:55] show of our walk with Christ but it's
[36:58] going and and speaking to somebody about
[37:01] Christ testifying and you don't have to
[37:03] force your way through but you could
[37:04] just you it's it's uh
[37:08] they'll see it more in the life that you
[37:10] live because they're going to notice
[37:11] something a little bit different I know
[37:13] I'm not telling you something that you
[37:15] don't know
[37:16] but in Galatians chapter 1
[37:21] I'm going to talk about Paul
[37:29] Galatians chapter 1 and verse 11.
[37:32] everybody okay this morning
[37:34] praise the Lord
[37:37] it says but I certify you brethren
[37:40] that the gospel which was preached of me
[37:42] is not after man
[37:44] for I neither received it of man neither
[37:46] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[37:49] Jesus Christ
[37:51] for ye have heard of my conversation in
[37:53] time past with in the Jews religion how
[37:55] that beyond measure I persecuted the
[37:58] Church of God and wasted it
[38:01] and profited in the Jews religion above
[38:04] many my equals and my known Nation being
[38:07] more exceedingly zealous of the
[38:09] traditions of my fathers
[38:12] but when it pleased God who separated me
[38:15] from my mother's womb and called me by
[38:17] his grace
[38:20] to reveal his son and me that I might
[38:23] preach him among the heathen
[38:25] I'll catch this part here he says
[38:27] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[38:30] and blood
[38:31] and neither went I up to Jerusalem to
[38:34] them which were Apostles before me but I
[38:37] went into Arabia and returned again unto
[38:39] Damascus then after three years I went
[38:42] up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode
[38:44] with him 15 days
[38:46] but other other of the Apostles saw a
[38:49] nun save James the Lord's brother
[38:52] now the things which I write unto you
[38:53] behold before God I lie not he's saying
[38:56] I'm telling you the truth but when I had
[38:58] heard this word when I heard this truth
[39:00] something struck something on the inside
[39:04] it struck something inside of there but
[39:06] I didn't confer with flesh and blood I
[39:08] didn't confer with man but I got alone
[39:10] with God and he was alone with God for
[39:13] three years
[39:15] and we have a hard time for three
[39:17] minutes
[39:18] and he was alone for three years he
[39:20] didn't he didn't talk to any of the
[39:22] Apostles he didn't talk to anybody uh
[39:24] Elsa was walking with with Christ while
[39:26] he was on on this Earth but he he
[39:28] learned of the holy spirit because he
[39:31] said it was of uh but by the revelation
[39:33] of Jesus Christ he got alone with God
[39:37] now see the Holy Ghost is our teacher
[39:39] now see uh brother Brandon told a story
[39:43] about a man that had a problem with
[39:45] smoking and he's saying well I gotta I
[39:47] gotta quit this before I can give my
[39:48] life to God
[39:49] he said not so
[39:52] you give your life to God the rest will
[39:54] take care of itself amen see we're so
[39:56] worried about getting people cleaned up
[39:57] before they come to church but you have
[39:59] to Come As You Are
[40:01] see when you come as you are that's what
[40:03] you really are and it's not a put on of
[40:05] something else and then you recognize
[40:07] that something is wrong
[40:09] it's not us that's saying that's telling
[40:11] somebody that uh that they're wrong but
[40:13] it's something on the inside that gets
[40:15] struck that that just convicts them so
[40:18] much that's what does the changing
[40:21] see we could try to encourage people to
[40:24] come to church
[40:26] and we should encourage people to come
[40:28] to church
[40:29] but it takes the Holy Spirit to get them
[40:31] to Christ and he also talked about
[40:35] the the Pentecostal days of how they be
[40:37] at the altar and people would be
[40:39] slapping people on the back that's not
[40:41] the way he gets saved it's not speaking
[40:43] in tongues it's not jumping up and down
[40:45] or shouting in the in the Holy Ghost
[40:47] amen that's not how you become saved but
[40:51] it's by the Holy Ghost
[40:53] that does the work on the inside
[40:56] that's what does the changing
[40:59] but see we want to hurry it along so
[41:01] much well I don't really like my brother
[41:03] so-and-so said
[41:05] well that's good we'll go meditate on
[41:07] what brothers so-and-so said
[41:10] go meditate upon those things and check
[41:12] it with the word to see if it's truth or
[41:14] not
[41:15] don't confer with other flesh yeah it's
[41:17] good to have Godly counsel but don't let
[41:19] that be your absolute
[41:21] your absolute is in Christ
[41:27] but he said then after three years I
[41:29] went into Jerusalem to see Peter and
[41:31] Abode within 15 days
[41:34] now see just keep it himself because he
[41:37] didn't want to hear how a man muddles
[41:39] things up because he was already a
[41:42] righteous man beforehand but he needed
[41:45] to know what was different about what he
[41:48] did
[41:49] and what Jesus followers did
[41:53] it's an individual Affair it's an
[41:55] individual relationship
[41:58] amen it's between you and God
[42:01] it's not between mother father
[42:03] grandmother grandfather is not between
[42:05] that Aunt Uncle I don't care what it is
[42:07] it's between you and God
[42:10] you have to settle it out
[42:15] now Jesus Jesus made the statement if
[42:17] you had known me you should have known
[42:19] my father also this shows an active
[42:22] relationship it's learning about
[42:24] somebody because there's there's
[42:27] something happening there's a
[42:28] relationship going on there's time being
[42:30] spent see Adam didn't have Eve right so
[42:34] who did he have to to commune with
[42:37] who did he have companionship with
[42:42] but when he had Eve he didn't know
[42:44] everything about Eve he had to get with
[42:46] Eve and learn Eve
[42:49] he had to learn about it see
[42:52] people want to rush into relationships
[42:54] I'm talking boyfriend girlfriend
[42:56] marriages but they don't take the time
[42:58] that they should
[43:00] one to pray about it that should be the
[43:02] first thing that we do the other thing
[43:04] is you you got to get to know the other
[43:06] person
[43:07] if you get in a relationship then you
[43:09] get into a marriage and you don't really
[43:11] know the person
[43:12] you just done you just made a mistake
[43:18] that's my encouragement is to get to
[43:20] know the other person before you before
[43:22] you get into that serious relationship
[43:24] but it's you need to know their ways you
[43:26] see we're told we're told not to be
[43:28] unequally yoked right so we must be
[43:30] yoked with Believers so you might want
[43:32] to see how they believe with one uh as
[43:35] far as under the scripture
[43:36] comparing with what you believe
[43:39] because if it's something that's
[43:41] completely opposite you're going to have
[43:42] a hard relationship
[43:45] see not just an acquaintance saying
[43:46] hello when you pass by or giving a
[43:49] greeting in in their presence see when
[43:51] you know the word you could typically
[43:52] see its signs right for we know that the
[43:55] signs will follow the believer
[43:58] kind of moving on to something else
[43:59] where brother Branham said that this
[44:02] message will not denominate right
[44:08] he didn't say that the organization
[44:10] called the message would not uh would
[44:13] not denominate because
[44:17] people carry ideas of their own into
[44:21] what we call the message right
[44:23] so
[44:25] if it doesn't fit God's program they try
[44:28] to make it fit
[44:30] and then what happens they that it
[44:32] becomes so much of their pet doctrine
[44:34] that they leave everything else out they
[44:36] leave God out of it he's knocking on the
[44:39] door but you won't let him in because
[44:41] you've got a preconceived idea you've
[44:43] got a preconceived notion that what you
[44:45] believe is right
[44:47] but the truth is trying to come in and
[44:49] you won't let it
[44:51] see you're isolating yourself
[44:53] from the Holy Spirit
[44:56] now we know what denominates dies right
[44:59] now see the message is Jesus Christ and
[45:02] Christ cannot die right so I think
[45:04] that's what brother Brandon was talking
[45:06] about when he said this message will not
[45:07] denominate Christ will not denominate
[45:10] because what denominates dies so just
[45:13] because you attend a message church that
[45:15] does not mean that you're saved amen not
[45:17] by any means but don't cleave to that
[45:19] notion that just because you said it in
[45:21] a message pew
[45:23] that you're going on to the rapture
[45:28] it doesn't matter what the the type of
[45:31] church that you go to the church that
[45:33] you go to now forgive me for for saying
[45:36] please understand what I'm saying it
[45:38] doesn't matter what church you go to as
[45:40] far as you say that you're saved because
[45:42] I go to so-and-so's church that's not
[45:44] that's not true
[45:46] it's if you are in Christ
[45:48] that's where it is
[45:50] I can't emphasize that enough you know
[45:52] the the the the
[45:54] eagle the eagle will only eat fresh meat
[45:57] right fresh man it won't eat something
[45:59] that's that's uh long dead I've heard
[46:02] people say you know uh I was told that
[46:04] eagles only ate fresh meat I've seen
[46:06] I've seen them eat roadkill okay but you
[46:09] won't see him eat roadkill that's a week
[46:11] old
[46:13] you won't see that
[46:17] one or two days that that's still fresh
[46:19] meat
[46:23] but see we get into our in our little
[46:25] spots of who are is we're not saved by
[46:28] our pastor we're not saved by our
[46:29] favorite evangelist we're not even saved
[46:31] because of the Prophet right see the
[46:34] bride will heed her husband
[46:37] the bride
[46:39] will only look to her husband and no one
[46:41] else
[46:43] oh he says this he says Israel coming
[46:45] out of Egypt then was a type this is the
[46:48] anti-type of the church coming out of
[46:50] the denominations now not all denominate
[46:54] pay attention here he says I mean the
[46:57] bride
[46:58] see some people there are some of the
[47:00] independence just as bad as the
[47:02] denominationals
[47:04] sometimes worse than
[47:08] oh my here he was he was coming out
[47:11] against the denominations well what
[47:13] about those that are independent
[47:17] he says some of them are even worse than
[47:20] than the denominations see he's talking
[47:23] about and he says I'm talking about the
[47:26] applied token this is where it's got to
[47:28] be this is where it really comes down to
[47:29] he says I'm talking about the applied
[47:31] token he's not talking about uh some
[47:34] church down the road in an independent
[47:36] church he's not talking about a church a
[47:37] denominational Church down the other
[47:39] direction he's not talking about that
[47:41] but he's saying I'm talking about the
[47:43] applied token the token agrees with
[47:45] every word the token do you have that
[47:49] token today
[47:50] see the token agrees with every word see
[47:52] it's got to because it is the word it's
[47:55] the life that was in the word my words
[47:57] are Spirit they are life said Jesus now
[48:01] see this is a time where the world is
[48:03] uniting together to come against the
[48:04] message right see just as the Jews
[48:06] United to come against and rejected
[48:08] Jesus the messenger of the hour so are
[48:11] those that have left the message ranks
[48:14] see it's not a it's not new news to to
[48:16] know uh that those are created believe
[48:18] the sign they've come against this
[48:21] message so hard
[48:23] of something that they used to testify
[48:25] of
[48:26] but see when people leave an
[48:28] organization with animosity in their
[48:30] heart they fight hard against it and
[48:33] then they try to discredit
[48:35] just like Proverbs 18 1.
[48:37] it's self-serving
[48:41] they try to discredit truth that they
[48:44] can't see see they destroyed the word of
[48:46] God by making it of none effect they try
[48:49] to get people to believe their claims
[48:50] that that much of the prophecies that
[48:52] were prophesied are absolutely wrong and
[48:54] never did come to pass they are coming
[48:56] against us so hard they say that none of
[48:59] the prophecies that brother Brandon
[49:00] prophesied came true
[49:03] see the internet is is full of these
[49:05] things against uh negativity against
[49:07] brother Branham but it's because they
[49:10] misinterpret they misunderstand what
[49:13] they what was being said
[49:15] see they have uh
[49:17] uh
[49:19] let's see
[49:21] several of the people are are former
[49:23] preachers
[49:24] a lot of the people that come against
[49:26] the message are former preachers
[49:29] see it's the same thing as in the day of
[49:31] the Pharisees and the Sadducees they
[49:34] have eyes to see and they have ears to
[49:36] hear but they can't see and they can't
[49:39] hear truth right but they are deaf and
[49:42] they were blind and they don't know it
[49:44] it's that same
[49:46] spirit
[49:50] I see there was we learned of the
[49:52] Jubilee I think it was back in Leviticus
[49:54] or I can't remember if it talks about it
[49:55] in Exodus I think it does in Exodus as
[49:57] well but a couple places in the Old
[49:59] Testament it talks about the Jubilee how
[50:01] uh in six years uh the people will serve
[50:04] but in that seventh year
[50:06] they have the option to go to go free
[50:09] and the one that bought them has to let
[50:11] them go but if they decide to stay then
[50:15] the master marched them in the ear
[50:18] the same thing is happening in this day
[50:19] these people want to continue to serve
[50:21] the Devils well God is marking them in
[50:23] their ears to where they can't hear the
[50:25] word of God anymore amen see they've
[50:27] isolated themselves from the Holy Spirit
[50:29] they've isolated themselves from the
[50:31] word of God so they could no longer hear
[50:33] the truth
[50:36] see God is uniting his bride with his
[50:38] word see heavens and earth will pass
[50:39] away but my word shall never pass away
[50:41] why for the Rapture amen see it's a
[50:45] Rapture time we've got to get ready for
[50:47] that Rapture she's uniting herself with
[50:49] thus saith the Lord no matter what
[50:51] anybody has to say about it she's
[50:53] getting ready to you to unite with her
[50:55] bridegroom see the Saints of old those
[50:58] that are asleep and those that are alive
[50:59] and remain will unite to become one with
[51:03] who
[51:04] the bride room
[51:10] see communism has to rise romanism has
[51:13] to rise the Council of churches has to
[51:15] rise the New World Order has to rise
[51:17] tensions will have to rise persecutions
[51:19] will rise so too the bread of Christ has
[51:22] to rise up and unite under the word of
[51:24] God bringing back the faith that was
[51:26] once delivered up to the Saints amen
[51:29] praise the Lord
[51:31] see all these other other things are
[51:33] coming up they're all rising up it's a
[51:35] slow process but they're coming they're
[51:37] here
[51:38] so too must we rise up
[51:41] to a different standard not well not I
[51:44] can't say it that way not to a different
[51:46] standard but to a higher standard it's
[51:48] maintaining the same standard of old but
[51:50] coming a little bit higher amen
[51:52] not being satisfied see we're all
[51:55] members of one body but we all must be
[51:58] able to move
[51:59] perform our function
[52:01] not be separate from one another but
[52:03] come together as a team come together as
[52:07] that one body of Christ
[52:10] he says oh brother
[52:15] when you isolate yourself from the rest
[52:17] of the Believers
[52:19] God will move away you've got to love
[52:22] one another this will all men know that
[52:24] you were my disciples when you have love
[52:27] one for the other one
[52:29] when the Methodist and the Baptist and
[52:32] the Lutheran and the Pentecostal can
[52:33] stand arm and arm and March forward
[52:35] you'll see one of the mightiest
[52:37] outpourings of the spirit of God that
[52:39] you have ever seen
[52:41] he says oh my
[52:43] god listen close he says the devil don't
[52:46] care as long as we're shooting at one
[52:49] another
[52:50] the devil don't care as long as we're
[52:52] shooting at one another he says oh go
[52:55] ahead you just fight you just kill
[52:57] yourselves but let us let us unite in
[53:00] one big front and watch what happens
[53:02] then see as long as we're bickering and
[53:05] fighting and just coming Against One
[53:07] Another We're isolating ourselves from
[53:09] one another and then it begins to become
[53:11] one big fight
[53:13] and then what happens the enemy comes in
[53:16] like a flood
[53:18] and then we wonder why we can't get
[53:20] anywhere
[53:22] because we've turned against another
[53:24] brother or a sister or another group
[53:26] whatever it might be
[53:31] but he says the devil don't care as long
[53:32] as we're shooting at one another
[53:36] see if we could just set our differences
[53:38] aside think of what we could accomplish
[53:41] but no we could offend it and have to
[53:43] isolate ourselves from one another well
[53:45] fine if that's the way they want it I
[53:47] just won't talk to them
[53:49] it says I'll just ignore them I'll only
[53:52] answer if I have to so you ever been in
[53:55] a relationship and then somebody upset
[53:57] you and then they call that the silent
[54:00] treatment
[54:02] well I'm just not going to talk to that
[54:04] I'm just not going to talk to my wife
[54:06] her husband boyfriend girlfriend
[54:07] whatever it might be my best friend
[54:09] they've offended me so I'm I'm not going
[54:12] to talk to them
[54:14] that's how people get that's all
[54:16] churches get they said something that I
[54:18] didn't like well I'm not going to go
[54:20] there well I might show up there I'm
[54:22] just not going to talk to anybody
[54:25] see how these things come in but you
[54:27] better watch out
[54:29] because that that Devil's just looking
[54:31] for that little tiny window to get in
[54:36] see fighting disputing in its cause and
[54:39] division all the while the enemy sits
[54:42] back and watches the people tear
[54:43] themselves apart making his job that
[54:46] much easier
[54:49] I've gotta I won't be much longer just
[54:52] bear with me for a few more minutes
[54:57] see the Jews
[54:59] we're in a civil war at the time when
[55:00] the second temple was was burned down
[55:03] I encourage you to go back and and study
[55:06] what happened at this time so uh this
[55:09] was back around 70 A.D you know a few
[55:12] years before a few years after
[55:14] uh the enemy had then surrounded and
[55:17] moved in with their tactics I can't
[55:19] remember the article that I had I had
[55:21] looked at I looked at a lot so I don't
[55:23] have a reference to to give you so my
[55:26] apologies I forgot to write it down
[55:29] apparently
[55:30] I'd like to give credit where I get
[55:32] where I get information
[55:33] but the enemy uh had them surrounded and
[55:37] moved in with their tactics see one of
[55:39] the tactics tactics was the use use of
[55:42] the Jews fighting amongst themselves
[55:45] see Titus was asked if he was going to
[55:47] move in he replied with a no for the
[55:49] people were taking themselves out for
[55:51] him
[55:52] and and it made his job that much easier
[55:56] see they made it easy for him because of
[55:58] all the backbiting and the fighting see
[56:01] the Jewish Revolt of 66 to 74 A.D
[56:05] it says the fall of Galilee to
[56:08] vespasians or Titus to titus's
[56:12] legionnaires prompted more internal
[56:14] strife among the Jewish fractions
[56:18] see because because of who Titus was and
[56:21] hearing things and what he did
[56:23] it caused the Jews
[56:25] to fight amongst themselves
[56:27] but let us not be like that
[56:30] we see the end don't be like that you're
[56:33] one body here you're a church group here
[56:34] stay together love one another
[56:38] if something hurts if somebody's
[56:40] offended then come according to Matthew
[56:41] 18 if if a brother offends you go to him
[56:45] and go to him alone or sister if there's
[56:47] a sister that offends you go to her and
[56:48] go to her alone
[56:51] see do it according to the scripture
[56:53] it's it should be we should be able to
[56:56] talk to one another hey I didn't like
[56:57] how you said such and such hey I didn't
[56:59] like this it could be me I'm sorry I'm
[57:01] having a bad day but I just didn't like
[57:03] this well I didn't mean it that way
[57:06] oh you meant it this way
[57:09] I completely took you the wrong way
[57:12] see misunderstanding is is the biggest
[57:14] culprit of many fights because we think
[57:17] we know what the other person was was
[57:19] saying
[57:21] but we jump to conclusions a lot of
[57:23] times you know a lot most times the
[57:25] conversation we we listen more for to uh
[57:29] respond to somebody than actually
[57:30] listening to what the other person has
[57:32] to say
[57:34] we're so caught up in in our response
[57:37] and and trying to think of something to
[57:39] say in return instead of just listening
[57:42] you know some people just need somebody
[57:44] to listen to
[57:48] anyhow
[57:52] but as the campaigning season of 68
[57:56] A.D began Vespasian was in no hurry to
[58:00] intervene stating that since our enemies
[58:02] are Busy Dying by their own hands the
[58:05] best course of action would be to stay
[58:07] as Spectators
[58:09] instead of taking on Fanatics who
[58:12] welcome death
[58:13] and are already busy murdering each
[58:17] other
[58:18] see they isolated themselves from each
[58:20] other they were divided
[58:23] foreign
[58:25] old saying divided or uh United We Stand
[58:29] but divided we fall so that's that's
[58:31] exactly what was happening here they
[58:32] were divided so therefore they fell but
[58:35] don't be divided amongst one another be
[58:37] United with each other amen
[58:40] see if they would have United they would
[58:42] have been a more formal formidable army
[58:44] under pressure and under Roman Siege
[58:47] they finally United to attack the Romans
[58:49] but at that time by the time they
[58:51] finally United it was much too late
[58:54] all of this all of that destruction came
[58:57] because they rejected Jesus as the
[58:59] Messiah they rejected the word that they
[59:02] claimed to be followers of now he's
[59:04] talking about the Jews because they
[59:06] rejected Christ at the time you know 33
[59:09] A.D which I think that was a time that
[59:11] that Christ was crucified and they
[59:12] rejected and all that stuff took place
[59:14] but because of that
[59:17] that's how they that's how they uh
[59:20] came to the fall
[59:22] is because they rejected Christ
[59:28] amen
[59:32] I see there again there's a there's a
[59:35] difference between isolating from from
[59:38] evil
[59:39] for we were taught in in the scripture
[59:41] Galatians 1 to abstain from all evil
[59:43] that we should isolate from those things
[59:45] we should uh
[59:48] just be separate from from all unbelief
[59:50] or any the the very appearance of evil
[59:52] if it looks evil stay away from it amen
[59:54] so but there's a difference between that
[59:57] and isolating yourselves to get in the
[1:00:00] presence of God
[1:00:02] now say we don't want to forsake the
[1:00:03] assembling of ourselves together but we
[1:00:05] want to draw that much closer as we see
[1:00:07] the day approaching amen
[1:00:09] uh I'm just going to close with this
[1:00:13] with this quote here
[1:00:15] it's going to be a couple minutes so
[1:00:17] that it's it's fairly lengthy lengthy so
[1:00:19] bear with me for a minute
[1:00:22] he says
[1:00:23] but to you it isn't nonsense to you
[1:00:27] you're United with the word and here it
[1:00:29] is then it's absolutely light when you
[1:00:32] see the this sign Unite with the
[1:00:34] believer and that's who I'm addressing
[1:00:36] this to is the believer for the
[1:00:38] unbeliever never sees it
[1:00:41] and what a rebuke it would be if he was
[1:00:43] on Earth today to many of our clergy
[1:00:45] today who cannot read this this sign the
[1:00:48] signs that we're reading uh daily here
[1:00:50] at the Tabernacle and seeing things
[1:00:53] excuse me and others are reading it and
[1:00:56] seeing the handwriting on the wall
[1:00:58] sorry excuse me and yet many just ignore
[1:01:02] it
[1:01:02] and don't even see it at all see it's
[1:01:05] nothing to them at all they don't notice
[1:01:07] it
[1:01:08] now notice that in this that he pointed
[1:01:10] out National signs
[1:01:12] now when they asked him about this they
[1:01:14] wanted signs and he gave them signs that
[1:01:17] happened
[1:01:18] and they wanted to know when would the
[1:01:20] end of the world be
[1:01:21] what would what would be the sign at the
[1:01:24] end and he pointed them many places
[1:01:26] through the scripture about National
[1:01:27] signs about Heavenly sign in the heavens
[1:01:30] and Earthly signs he gave them signs
[1:01:33] signs signs and Justice constantly a
[1:01:36] sign and he told them there in one place
[1:01:38] about a national sign he said when you
[1:01:40] see the Nations
[1:01:42] see begin to gather around Jerusalem see
[1:01:45] then we know that the time of their
[1:01:47] trouble was at hand when you see
[1:01:49] Jerusalem compassed about with army
[1:01:53] see now before that they could do this
[1:01:56] excuse me before that they could do this
[1:01:58] the world had to unite Titus this great
[1:02:01] Roman general had to unite his armies
[1:02:04] together and come around after these
[1:02:06] Jews had rejected the god-given sign of
[1:02:08] the time to them
[1:02:09] that's the time that Titus United his
[1:02:12] armies together and come to take the
[1:02:14] city first there had to be a uniting of
[1:02:17] God's people so-called against the word
[1:02:20] of God
[1:02:21] before that the nation can unite itself
[1:02:23] against God's people
[1:02:26] see the unity the uniting uniting
[1:02:29] together
[1:02:31] I believe that's where we're we're
[1:02:33] living in a great uniting time I am
[1:02:35] taking these these red lights down he's
[1:02:38] talking about all these things happening
[1:02:39] in in his day he's taking note of all
[1:02:42] these the the red lights uh he says I am
[1:02:45] taking these these red lights down and
[1:02:46] Flash signals and everything of the
[1:02:48] women of how they do and the men of how
[1:02:51] they do and the churches of how they do
[1:02:52] showing to this little group with all my
[1:02:55] heart that I believe that we are lining
[1:02:58] in the line of God's word
[1:03:01] in this great prophetic hour just before
[1:03:03] the coming of the Lord Jesus uniting
[1:03:06] together and getting ready
[1:03:08] now you see before Titus United his
[1:03:11] armies together Israel United themselves
[1:03:13] together and abandoned themselves that
[1:03:15] they would not believe Jesus to be the
[1:03:18] Messiah
[1:03:19] they rejected him and turned him out and
[1:03:21] crucified him and then when they
[1:03:24] rejected the Salvation that was sent to
[1:03:26] them they United themselves together to
[1:03:28] do it now hold that in mind uniting
[1:03:31] themselves together to reject the
[1:03:34] message of the hour
[1:03:36] they had to do that and then when they
[1:03:39] did that then the national sign come in
[1:03:42] the Nations begin to unite themselves
[1:03:45] together and Titus brought this great
[1:03:47] Army of Romans and Greeks and compassed
[1:03:49] the walls of Jerusalem penned those
[1:03:51] people in there now and they starved to
[1:03:54] death
[1:03:55] they eat the bark from the trees
[1:03:57] Josephus the great historian tells us
[1:03:59] and they eat the grass off the ground
[1:04:04] see when you get in desperation
[1:04:06] you know and you reject the word you'll
[1:04:08] just eat anything
[1:04:10] you'll eat anything because you're
[1:04:11] starving to death
[1:04:14] see they even they even boiled one
[1:04:16] another's children and eat it
[1:04:18] that's disgusting but they were
[1:04:20] desperate
[1:04:22] see as they were mad people
[1:04:24] and then when finally Titus he was
[1:04:27] setting back upon the hills and around
[1:04:29] Jerusalem there and those people in
[1:04:31] there thought they were they were doing
[1:04:32] the will of God
[1:04:34] when they saw these armies Marching In
[1:04:36] they had refused to hear that great
[1:04:39] Master Lord Jesus to tell them that
[1:04:43] there wasn't one of them Christians
[1:04:45] caught in there
[1:04:46] for they saw the sign and moved did you
[1:04:49] catch that
[1:04:50] there wasn't one Christian in there
[1:04:54] he said there wasn't one of them
[1:04:56] Christians caught in there for they saw
[1:04:58] the sign and moved see they said let
[1:05:01] them that's on the housetop come not
[1:05:03] down or him that's in the field go back
[1:05:06] take not his coat but flee into Judea
[1:05:09] and pray that your flight be not in the
[1:05:12] winter time or on the Sabbath because in
[1:05:15] the winter time the hills would be full
[1:05:17] of snow and on the Sabbath day the doors
[1:05:20] were closed the gate and they'd be cut
[1:05:22] in that condition
[1:05:26] says notice now they prayed that it
[1:05:28] would not be that way Jesus told them to
[1:05:32] pray for that
[1:05:33] and they never caught one of them in
[1:05:36] there they were going they were gone
[1:05:38] because they looked at the sign and they
[1:05:40] were gone
[1:05:41] that's all there was to it
[1:05:44] says oh and how the the churches today
[1:05:47] ought to see the sign of the time that
[1:05:48] we're living in fleeing as hard as you
[1:05:50] can to Calvary for life not to some
[1:05:54] church but to Jesus Christ
[1:05:58] wait to some church
[1:06:00] or not to some church but to Jesus
[1:06:02] Christ so we know that Christ is the
[1:06:04] important thing I know I'm not telling
[1:06:05] you something that you that you don't
[1:06:07] know I know you know that already but
[1:06:09] just to stress that
[1:06:11] he says unite yourself with him and not
[1:06:14] with some organization or some church
[1:06:16] Creed I see the the
[1:06:20] press play Church the the tape Church
[1:06:23] they're an organization kind of Unto
[1:06:25] themselves
[1:06:27] and their Creed is push play
[1:06:29] that's that's what their Creed is but
[1:06:31] he's saying don't uh Unite
[1:06:35] unite yourself with him and not with
[1:06:37] some organization or some church Creed
[1:06:41] but Unite with Christ and be sure that
[1:06:44] it's him you can't just take anything
[1:06:46] you got to you got to be positive that
[1:06:49] it's him what a time of Union
[1:06:53] now see no we find out that they
[1:06:55] rejected the Messiah and then United
[1:06:57] themselves together and made themselves
[1:06:59] a league
[1:07:01] and made emotion among them that of any
[1:07:04] any persons received Jesus as a prophet
[1:07:06] that they would be excommunicated from
[1:07:09] the church
[1:07:10] so you remember the blind boy that was
[1:07:12] set with blinded eyes and the disciples
[1:07:14] said who sinned him or his father or his
[1:07:17] mother
[1:07:18] he says now
[1:07:22] excuse me
[1:07:24] we see this uniting time coming see now
[1:07:27] watch and then the church has United
[1:07:30] itself against the message
[1:07:32] and then when it does that the nations
[1:07:35] are uniting themselves in communism to
[1:07:37] destroy the church again
[1:07:40] just exactly what it did in the first
[1:07:42] place see it repeats itself right back
[1:07:44] again
[1:07:46] now see we're seeing this this uh
[1:07:50] we're seeing that in this day that
[1:07:52] they're coming against the church right
[1:07:53] they're trying to shut the church out
[1:07:55] they're trying to to shut the church off
[1:07:56] from from being what the church is
[1:07:59] they're saying
[1:08:01] the church needs to accept everybody
[1:08:03] else we need to be that we need to
[1:08:05] tolerate you need to be more tolerant
[1:08:07] but on the other hand they're not
[1:08:10] tolerant of the church they won't let
[1:08:11] the church be to themselves now see they
[1:08:14] want everybody to to be yourself Let
[1:08:17] Yourself Go
[1:08:19] but they don't let others be themselves
[1:08:21] now see that's kind of hypocritical
[1:08:23] now see we see uh we see these these
[1:08:26] things happen in this day you know why
[1:08:27] don't they
[1:08:28] why are they coming against Christians
[1:08:31] so much in this day
[1:08:32] why aren't they fighting against the
[1:08:34] Muslims why don't you see things
[1:08:36] happening uh nobody's coming against the
[1:08:39] Muslims that I see
[1:08:41] I guess nobody dares to come against the
[1:08:43] Muslims because they won't put up with
[1:08:44] it
[1:08:46] but see
[1:08:48] and I'm going to go out so far to say
[1:08:52] the persecution has to come against the
[1:08:53] true church
[1:08:55] the true church
[1:08:57] God's people
[1:08:59] God's true people
[1:09:02] so why don't we see more of that
[1:09:03] happening in this day why why isn't the
[1:09:06] the the the society coming against more
[1:09:10] uh against the uh the Muslims how come
[1:09:14] they're not coming against uh those up
[1:09:17] practice witchcraft
[1:09:21] they're condoning the Witchcraft which
[1:09:24] years ago they used to burn people that
[1:09:26] they thought were witches at the stake
[1:09:29] but now
[1:09:31] they're harboring it they're actually
[1:09:32] wanting to distribute take Harry Potter
[1:09:34] for instance boy he got that got so
[1:09:37] popular it's even in Christian people
[1:09:39] that claim to be Christians it's even in
[1:09:42] their homes
[1:09:43] that's hogwash
[1:09:45] they talk about Hogwarts I'm talking
[1:09:47] about hogwash
[1:09:50] that shouldn't be in a Christian's home
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:57] but they're trying to destroy the church
[1:09:59] now they're trying to shut the doors
[1:10:01] they tried to do it during coven they
[1:10:03] tried to shut the doors but we know that
[1:10:05] that is going to come we know that one
[1:10:07] day it's going to be coming
[1:10:12] excuse me
[1:10:13] continuing on he says Israel had to turn
[1:10:16] down the message first
[1:10:19] and when they turned down the message
[1:10:20] then the military the National Life
[1:10:24] United itself together of other nations
[1:10:27] and come in and destroyed the church
[1:10:30] and today they have turned down the
[1:10:32] message of the Lord Jesus and they've
[1:10:34] turned it down and now the time has come
[1:10:36] to where communism is uniting the world
[1:10:39] together against the church see it has
[1:10:42] to be that way now it's hard to say that
[1:10:44] but see like we see all these things
[1:10:47] happening and it's under the cloak of
[1:10:48] socialism now see socialism eventually I
[1:10:51] think will turn into the communism
[1:10:53] so it's going to start off in one way
[1:10:55] and it's cloaked
[1:10:58] they want one thing for all
[1:11:02] such silliness
[1:11:03] you know as history repeats itself if
[1:11:06] you know the history but if they take
[1:11:07] that out of the history books and they
[1:11:09] don't teach the history then they're
[1:11:10] doomed to repeat the same thing
[1:11:13] because there was no government under
[1:11:15] socialism that has ever stood
[1:11:18] for a long period of time they've all
[1:11:21] Fallen
[1:11:25] uh
[1:11:26] it says it was hard for them them Jews
[1:11:29] to believe they said now come brethren
[1:11:31] we see that our God is with us and so
[1:11:33] we'll go into the temple
[1:11:38] and now we will pray
[1:11:40] and let the Holy Father so and so
[1:11:43] and Holy Father so and so lead in prayer
[1:11:45] close the gate
[1:11:47] and Titus took his stand and stood right
[1:11:49] there for about a year or more
[1:11:51] see right on guard and starve them right
[1:11:54] out there couldn't be a one of them even
[1:11:57] get outside the city and they died
[1:11:59] starved and when he went in there and
[1:12:02] tore the walls down the blood gussed out
[1:12:05] and run like Rivers down there
[1:12:08] where he slaughtered everything that was
[1:12:09] in there
[1:12:10] now the angel of the Lord prophesied
[1:12:12] that back in the Old Testament and told
[1:12:15] that what told that that would happen
[1:12:16] and then ministers who was clergy was
[1:12:19] supposed to be posted on that and to
[1:12:21] tell the people that instead of that
[1:12:23] when Jesus stood among them they didn't
[1:12:25] even know him and try to make some kind
[1:12:28] of a rabbit foot do us a trick let us
[1:12:30] see how it's done show us a sign see
[1:12:33] and he said I'd uh
[1:12:36] well he's done so many things and yet
[1:12:38] they couldn't see it
[1:12:39] and then when they rejected him as their
[1:12:42] Messiah the message of that day they
[1:12:44] rejected the message of that day I know
[1:12:47] that was lengthy but uh I'll go ahead
[1:12:50] and close
[1:12:51] if you'd stand to your feet
[1:12:53] see he was talking about of how the Jews
[1:12:57] about that article that I was referring
[1:13:00] to about the Jews they rejected the
[1:13:02] Messiah so then it was prophesied that
[1:13:05] all nations would surround them uh with
[1:13:07] the with the Army and because they they
[1:13:10] were coming against one another they
[1:13:13] were back fighting they were they were
[1:13:14] fighting and just from Winston Wars and
[1:13:17] Stripes come among you is it not because
[1:13:19] people reject Christ
[1:13:22] and they were warring with uh amongst
[1:13:25] each other instead of being united
[1:13:26] together they were warring against each
[1:13:28] other and that's what made it so easy
[1:13:30] for Titus to to take them out he was a
[1:13:33] patient uh he was a patient man and he
[1:13:36] just waited and just surrounded them
[1:13:38] nobody could leave and if they did they
[1:13:40] would die when they stayed they died
[1:13:44] because they were not United
[1:13:47] so better is fellowship
[1:13:49] than solitude
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:53] second Corinthians I'll close with this
[1:13:55] scripture here
[1:13:56] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:13:59] and verse 14.
[1:14:02] it says be ye not unequally yoked
[1:14:04] together with unbelievers for what
[1:14:06] Fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:14:08] unrighteousness and what communion hath
[1:14:10] light with darkness and what Concord
[1:14:13] hath Christ with Belial
[1:14:15] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:14:18] an infidel
[1:14:19] and what agreement
[1:14:21] at the temple of God with Idols for ye
[1:14:25] are the Temple of the Living God
[1:14:27] as God hath said I will dwell in them
[1:14:29] and walk in them and I will be their God
[1:14:32] and they shall be my people
[1:14:34] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:14:36] be ye separate saith the Lord and touch
[1:14:39] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[1:14:41] you
[1:14:43] it will be a father unto you and you
[1:14:45] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
