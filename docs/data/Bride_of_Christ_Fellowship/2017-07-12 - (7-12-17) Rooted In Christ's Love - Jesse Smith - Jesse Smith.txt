ask it in Jesus Christ's name where we know that's the name to receive all blessings and we ask nothing darling Lord full confidence Lord God you will minister that need or be of any other unspoken question though the people's hearts I didn't ask them to raise their hand but you know the needs of our God a pretty neat everything tonight lord thank you for the saints coming out to the houses Lord I'll give you honor and praise and glory and worship you know Jesus Christ amen I did that one test alone they're going with me on Sunday remember when we had a visitor sister Donna a few weeks ago when she came up for prayer for the Holy Ghost and remember that do you remember how many remember see an 8 a man Earth's Arcia and then came up for prayer sorry with Lily that came up from her and after she went back to her seat her mind went back she I guess she was whispered over into the toll brother Bank she's brother bang or did you hear all that was hallelujah course nobody was singing a lot of holler really of course and we were not singing hallelujah song for that time and Maggie even said she heard it out of her bad year and so that was a testimony because it reminds us that it might have been angels of God said a woman here poured out her heart to the Lord and there see here's a song that we say there was a lot of course like a choir of hallelujah right but to know that as angels gather around true believers that's why I wanted to share I knew that was it by God's grace then I encourage you nothing carriages me you know to know that those things happen I believe see I don't think she's had any mobile training where she was not raising the message so she I don't know about that so we're very thankful for that let's see one more song here's our vcomplex almost time our usual time to preach God's Word let's stay on our feet messing up well it will be worked at all we just seen the course for that then we want to get to the Word of God here I try to keep it he worked at all when we see Jesus and let's not forget this song it's good old song I used to sing growing up we have it be worth it all [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] which was us being rooted in Christ bless Sunday when we preach that message and there was numerous hands and went up so to me that's a little confirmation for me that it was the leadership of the Lord so very thankful for that you want a pure heart with no weeds in it praise God nothing growing up that would hinder those brophy by in our lives praise the Lord is so crucial to our Christian walk with the Lord tonight we'll start off a little bit with we're going to finish up a little more on the our hearts as the ground but then we want to finish with how we rooted in Christ and where the plant is planted in the Christ so let's start with that let's go to Ephesians 3:17 3:17 verse 17 the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints this is something all Saints should be able to proceed comprehend what is the breadth the length and depth and height the love of Christ which passes knowledge and you might be filled so we'll bet you get to that thought I want to get to that thought of All Saints need to comprehend what is the breadth the length the depth and the height of the love of God anyone be able to understand that I think we do I just want to bring the Scriptures out so you can be refreshed with understanding how much God loves us we often preach it hard against sin like you all the time sometimes we just look back how much God loves me that's a nice I thought we could do that as targets the word of Prayer getting on your heart just make it known unto God how many follow you love you tonight thank you for your mercy and your grace Lord God we ask that you minister not to us by before the spirit Lord take my thoughts in order to put them to the side that's what my own thoughts aside and mainly preach your word through me dear God by your spirit there's the foolishness of preaching to save or deliver them that believe Lord so deliver us from any doubt or fear or frustration of bitterness Lord anything at all that's might be rooted in our hearts Lord God or just pray Lord God for your mercy to rest upon us the Holy Spirit direct us we need you Lord I need you tonight Lord God be with us in a special way in Jesus Christ loving it sure said Amen god bless you didn't see the praise the Lord let's look at this talk here about God you can switch over I have some quotes share one look at rooted in Christ tonight how many believe they're rooted in Christ the Christ is the ground he's got all the minerals you need he's got all the water you need and you're just planted in Christ he met will look at that thought tonight rooted in Christ so we read our text now our four illustrations on Sunday and we looked at Christ as the root these the room at the offspring of David we know that and then our hearts as the ground and we looked at that we just briefly looked at the churches the branch I'm not going to I'm not gonna spend much time on that we look at that briefly we saw how in the bride tree we're at the very top the bride of Jesus Christ in this day is not a denomination those are all those were all good moves during their day but I heard what I have to say this week in the Czar's church age it's the second generation that messes it up God will send a revival it's not the first generation it's the second generation so don't we have to be careful had to be careful mother grams/day his initial people were in the revival but is the next generation has to be careful that falls in us we might even be a third generation I would imagine because you looking at like brother Joseph Branham was the son of brother Brandon well he's got children that are my age he's got grandchildren you know so we're almost like the third generation but spiritually if you're born begin tonight you're not a grandchild a great grandchild you're a child of God because God doesn't have grandchildren you must be a real child of God amen and so like I said much time this but we're going to finish tonight with this we are rooting the love of Christ and if we're rooted in him then we need to understand and comprehend with that with all the saints what the love of God is what that means for us so let's I want to finish though with this that our hearts are ground for roots either good seed right or bad seed and on Sunday I said that I hadn't been doing a lot of weeding that's true and children have been doing a lot of weeding I haven't I took some time off but then last week I finally got in there did some weeding you know that our natural Gardens but I would make sure I sent that the right way I didn't mean to make it look like nobody was working because they worked really hard I just took some time off from weeding you know cuz I was just tired and focus on other things but our hearts are like a ground that's receiving the word and tonight Christ is going to try to show some more seat on your heart praise God and you want that go and receive that and you want the promises of God to be received on good grounds so we want to make sure there's nothing that would hinder the word that's falling to our hearts tonight now I said this on Sunday by never reading the quote so I want you to see it because I don't know if I read this before here if we have a unconfessed sin in our lives it's a great hindrance to God moving in our lives he can still move like man preach that message unbelief doesn't hinder God if someone's going to sit and disbelieve God God will move on to somebody else it won't hinder the plan of God it'll just move God to just hinder God's move in that person's life right like with the example when cherish his daughter remember Jairus daughter died and everybody's cried and then laughing in Jesus in Jerez house saying Jesus said oh she just sleep there everybody's laughing so what Jesus have to do kick them out right he said you have to leave excuse us you need to leave right so that unbelief of that group didn't end there God God just dismiss them and then God did the miracle and that's how as far as today praise the Lord but anyone confessing left in a group of believers if not taken care of if it's not prayed for it will spread and to file the whole church because it's caught it's another simple as 11 just like if you let a garden bed go without eating it the weeds are gonna take over praise God they're just gonna take over so we've got to keep all the sin out of our hearts and lives that's why every service is so crucial that's why weeding every day and our weeding it all the time is so crucial praise God how many have a garden somebody have a garden here just Jose thus okay so when you guys get in the garden you know or you haven't met your own house I've ever had the babies the old houses and art if you never had one you maybe not one understand but if you want those plants to grow healthy you gotta meet all the time you gotta be constant looking for where's the bad part where's the bad part where's the bad part and that's what the Holy Ghost does for us if there's any bad part pick it out well we need out get rid of it because the true seeds need to grow into fruition now here's where I mentioned this on Sunday it's from adoption I think I said 1960 but our 61 is actually 1960s so forgive me if I said the wrong here and my dad said there's where the church is failing today on the walk do you know that even your own behavior could knock somebody else out of getting healed yes your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you not sinners believers can cause this church to bitterly fail yeah he's talking at his home church how many one on search to succeed and it will and the wait for it to succeed is to have the Holy Ghost visit us have angels visit us to have God do mighty things among us saving souls send to fire heart's filling know what the Holy Ghost doing miracles as he's led as he leads us to do right but it's not if the Holy Spirit is grieved then the church can fail and at the end of the judgement he said you'll be responsible for every bit of it the church will be responsive yes oh you say now wait a minute program he said that's the truth think of it who's he use Joshua Joshua after he crossed over the land God gave him the promise that just think to fight an entire campaign without losing the man without even getting a scratch without having to have a nurse or a first aid or beta amen God said the land yours go fight baby fighting the campaign and there's no Red Cross around at all there's nobody going to get hurt and they slayed the amorite through the Hittites but there wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin came in the camp and when a took the Babylonian garment and that gold edge and hid it under under his camp then the next day they lost 16 million I think was 60 Joshua sent stops not wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call seven days of facts God made us a promise there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall on our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong here because we got sixteen dead men laying here there is alive brothers and they're dead why do they die in a set men because one man stepped out of line you see reason this needs to be taught the church lining up lining up the Word of God might help with God and lighting up with the juggler walking perfectly upright soberly before a man fearing God because one man's solar garment does something that he should not have done took the life of 16 men I think it was 1690 Marley was 1609 Joshua called and said there's something wrong God made the promise there's something wrong and when we bring the sick up before us and they failed to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call of assembly something thrown somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it now the last time I did that was last year I called it fast and we have one other person come I caught a fast for Christopher and Samuel I caught a fast for that we and some people said they were fasting was gonna cover the church but we had two people coming to church with me thank God for that and they were helped within a few months I'm not mistaken we afraid afraid of praise and it's nothing to burden me like what something's wrong I think I just preached this I think I preached on the Sunday night one done and so we call the fast and God brought relief to Samuel and Christopher for least for a while by the grace of God so I've tried to put this in action how many think we should put in action just like with somebody that sins and won't repent we should put them out of the church now I've never had that with the time when we first are in the church we haven't had it recently so everybody I went to is sin either leaves or they make your right for that but if somebody will come to the church and commit fornication or adultery and won't repent on that and won't leave that we've got to first order than one on one if they won't repent take somebody else the third thing bringing before the church but they still won't repent me back to count that person as a heathen how many believe that's the true gospel yes some people go overboard with it every little thing you know they'll nitpick but larsa's only by the church does not seems to do that they go overboard and any little thing that puts you out from under the blood well God God will deal with them with that that road I don't hold them accountable but we've got to be accountable for our church we don't have to answer for any other Church Lima Lorraine Sheffield I'll be edited we all have to answer we just have to answer for Akron Ohio so we've tried I put this into action one time by God's grace God brought relief and he called him fast Joshua called fast they found it they cast the Lots and they can confessed it and they kill they can family at all and burnt their ashes and left it there for memorial and Joshua write off through the battles taking everything without a scratch or wound there you are if the brother okay now that's the story that's exactly gave now I'm using this go I used a few Wednesday's ago I should say few products been two months ago but these services all seen them just go together for me so forgive me you know how you if a brother if you think he's a little wrong or a sister and say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness no remember we push on through the bitterness on Sunday don't let me never go root a bitter spring up because it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life so let's that hold something between heaven well Adam did this to me never called me back and then he said this thing about me and if I don't go to him now that's never happy but I could use anybody my son Malik got you know if we don't go and address that it causes a root of bitterness growth and that will kill the Spirit of God in our lives you don't kill your love for God it'll kill your sweetness by matter what use the word sweet the word won't be so sweet your prayers won't be so sweet the preached you won't be so sweet because the doubler that always causes sweet duh I've tendered of you your heart will be very tender Juanita's be with God right levin exhale take the christ right out of your life if you don't go talk to a brother sister program says the poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred remember brother had said jealousy is what caused the first war between Cain and Abel remember Cain was jealous and that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run it in from the Tabernacle in here it will kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt you're faster it'll do everything don't you do that does that help by God's grace just I'm just bringing that to remind us because I don't know what who was here when I preached the one about unconfessed sin will cause the church severely fail is this on a Sunday night but it's true and it's right from the Bible is from Joshua is also from you know ladarius it's also from other times remember Jesus could not do many mighty works in Nazareth because of unbelief so they shut down the blue of the Holy Spirit now I want to move on that was how your your your heart is in ground and now let's get to how you are playing the cry just want to take them up take about 40 minutes on this okay by God's grace that's a good 40 minutes now go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 1 let's go there now I might need some help reading tonight by God's grace Colossians 2 verse 1 there's two times Paul says that we are rooted in Christ we're actually planted in Christ I think about that were planted in the Holy Spirit we're planted in the love of God we're planet and the Holy One we're planted in The Anointed One sorry I got a position where I haven't planted my location or my residence is in the Holy One amen and when I my flesh or my mind all the time but my soul praise God my soul is in Christ Oh because crisis in me and in my soul right same thing for you the way here in Christ is Christ is in you that's what the Bible explained so let's go to cautions chapter 2 verses 1 to 10 I got quite a few scriptures there how about um neither just such yeah I think we have I think we have time can we start with malachite malachite even read verses 1 to 4 I would that you didn't think he knew what great conflict I have for you and Fedele Laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh but their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches the fruit of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ amen thank you do you like that how they're knitted together University everything about the church as you know something that's knit together like a scarf what are some other things like a blanket it would be knitted together you ever seen a woman knit something that's how the church is supposed to be someone called me yesterday out of the blue I haven't seen them for eight years and there's one of the bank's former friends used to come to church here and he said he said you ever see brother van getting lower you said you ever seen a Devon and these other guys I said I see Megan every week he's there every Sunday twice a week is I used to what most faithful brothers in the church staring he's like oh okay that's wonderful you just said I was on his heart so he called me you know how an actor anymore but he's one of these friends I met him when he first I remember when he come to Bible says when he's doing John's house at my house he would come right in my house and be teaching the word of course you don't follow the message like we do but I just think that's a great example how we're linked together as Christians he want to know if I ever seen them but they and I are knitted together as a family any men whoever you bang goes on Church you're gonna see me right whoever I go yourseif a wide because our lives are gathered together our lives are intertwined don't you like that that's what Paul says our lives the love of God makes our lives intertwined I love you know we had some pictures on the floor a few weeks ago Adams wedding you know with Boeing and often the pictures are on just all bar family with attitude mode I and we could we could retell the story of our lives and the major events of our lives you know get married on January 1st this year the story of our lives should be knit together we don't maybe spend a lot of every day together you know maybe we're together two or three days out of the week but our lives should be knitted together they should be connected we should care about one another's lives we should know what's going on in our to each other's lives right that's what love does I care about how a men's feeling I care about how joses the other men care about how work how's work going you know we want to we want to be connected with one another it's not enough to come to church because anybody can come to church but we must have love that connects our lives together that's what we feel that's why I want to have fellowships and sit down with you and looking across the table and talk with you you know and be and be in fellowship I got it straight to love that now verse three Lydia if you read verses three three four five there come all although I'm not with you at your church I'm there with you in spirit people say that I'll be there in spirit and they joke around about it but it's a reality why because your spirit is one with the Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit's there that church guess what get your spirit you're there with them because it's the same Holy Spirit's not a different spirit it's the same spirit and you're a part of that spirit that's exactly right Amen I like that hallelujah so why not you know if I lead to preach summer you guys go visit another church somewhere or something like that you can say well I was there with you in spirit I was I was I was preaching alive above I was here with you and accurate in the Holy Spirit because we won the Holy Ghost to move we were worshiping we're all worshipping Him so we work together oh I like this now six we don't have to read six and seven sister bow thank you this is what somebody's like looks like that's a Christian there planted in Christ and they're growing in Christ they're not going anywhere right you know sometimes you can transplant plants right but normally the Sun is out it's part not a good idea to do that very often I don't know you might get the roots made up if I hurt the roots what's that roots gotta come out yeah it's usually not a good thing to do and so the Bible said we're rooted and built up we're supposed to grow in Christ in other words I should see my life becoming more like Jesus Christ we use the example on Sunday the little white button Oh Graham says when you get the Holy Ghost look like a white button and as you get more roots out of your life that grows in you and you share more eternal light in your body amen so it's shining out from your soul it's trying to spread out into your human spirit right and try to spread out and control all your thoughts on your thinking on your plans all your words is trying to sprint up and then you should have bound I have a little bit of Thanksgiving even have a lot of things spinning amen thank you for this Lord thank you with that thank you for all the blessings you about with these that's fruit you're producing now I don't know if you remember I appreciate last year but one of the sacrifices of the Odessa was a bank offering and I use that as a type of a spiritual offering like sometimes we're priests right were priests sometimes all God wants at the end of a service is for you to thank you because that is a sacrifice of praise in the Old Testament that was one of the offerings thank offering you can do sit off free meat offering peace offering but one of those offerings was just a thank offering do you realize how important is sometimes of maybe you didn't hear a whole lot of things doing whatever but God is trying to bring something to your heart and maybe God just wants you to lift your hands in a real heart of Thanksgiving real gratitude not just going through the motions but the real gratitude and Thanksgiving for the crosses United eyes for the Holy Spirit or calling them out of sin or for your most recent healing or for saving this person's soul he just wants to receive some real Thanksgiving because church he's not get that not he's not getting much real Thanksgiving from churches because they're not really thankful they're greedy or the love of the world has entered it they're not really thankful for just Calvary for forgiveness for the walk that they have with the Lord amen so if we're built up and rooted in Christ you should have lots of Thanksgiving we should always be thankful now verse eight beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ so you've got to be careful when things get preached we got to make sure it's actually the Word of God is preached yeah if a preacher comes in here or if I come in here and hopefully everything you know I preaches the Word of God if not you you need to ask me if I let's say I started reading some books that aren't brother Graner I start getting into some psychology of dr. sons though and I sell bring in psychology and there's no scripture for what should you do you should come to me and talk to me about it because that could spoil your faith for example something like oh you don't have to believe for healing you can remain this and this and you have to that's just how your made up now don't get me wrong there's certain things you know we can talk about we can talk about things but I'm just saying let's say I paint you a picture there's no hope for deliverance but yet the Bible says all things are possible to them who believed that would be baby philosophy there's no hope and that's just the way it's gonna be you've never you're gonna get delivered you couldn't be forgiven that's insane that's philosophy and that's got to be rooted out and only Christ must be preached so he must filter as we know filter everything for the Word of God everything well Graham said take everything I say back to the word and that's what I say to you take everything back to Christ we don't want traditions of Jesse we don't want traditions of Simon traditions of Craig pernicious traditions of any preacher we traditions of the word because the genes that keep my traditions that's actually especially eye cancer that there are good traditions right but we don't want tradition to men you want traditions of Christ might be Boston that's a tradition of Christ right water baptism that's a tradition of Christ those are all good traditions now verse 9 for in and drove all forces of good got it bottled up worse than others and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality topic praise God so that's a good it's a good review if you're planted in Christ and really drawing as a Christian your bounden Thanksgiving you have a life full of Thanksgiving thank you for my children or thank you for the job thank you for the whole I think right all the time I say Lord thank you for our food shelter clothing and our church that we have when I got back from God I was thanking God for a hot shower because we'd have any hot shower I was thinking God for paved roads because there are going a lot of dirt roads with holes about six feet long and two feet deep it's all as awful conditions I came back thanking God for everything that we have I don't want to forget that we need to thank God for what we have just everything we thank will always give God things that shows you're really rooted your roots are really dumb gone down to Christ because there's nothing good about complaining the roots of Christ so grow in a root of the seat of complain don't shouldn't grow in a Christians heart and I say like the head the seed of complaining shouldn't take root in our lives and for rooted in crisis no room he'll weed out the complaining no root out the pity party I got the worst life or I've got it so hard I've got harder than everybody else well there's somebody that's got it harder than you some way right so let's battle them with Thanksgiving now he brews I'm sorry ninety Ephesians three let's go back to Ephesians three thirteen so alright it's two letters to different churches and he both talks about being rooted in Christ we've gone through how your heart is up ground must you keep your heart rooted I'm sorry I'm sorry you must keep Sid up rooted out of your heart but now we're looking at how you must be planet you and I must be planted in Christ and if we are this is what our lives will produce amen how the new visions 3:13 I said Hebrews 3:13 now one resistance I want to go a bit slower o wherefore I desire that you faint not have my tribulations for you which is your glory okay so Paul's suffering in order to bring the Ephesians the Word of God somehow he's suffering I think at this point you've been arrested if I'm not mistaken cuz he was writing letters he already left Ephesus I mean he was writing letters back to them so he was already a prisoner of the Lord remember he went before Felix and Festus and different ones like that he was a prisoner for quite a long time with it she'd say years of his life so he's writing them he was a prisoner for their sake verse 14 for this cause I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven earth is named that he meant that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in innovating how many one of how many not just want to think about how many wanna feel God's strength inside man I like I like going about my day feeling God's strength inside of me that should be a real treasure for Christians in it you can leave your prayer closet you can leave your knees you can leave your house get the car and you can feel the strength in your life in other words I'm ready for those temptations are ready to cast them down I'm ready to share my faith with somebody I'm ready to tell I'm ready to pray for somebody I was go stirred up for Christ yesterday after Taekwondo when the fighting our boy was leaving that said that why is he crying he was crying and he's holding his bless I said why is he crying he said he got a bad headache and I was on fire for Christ I was praying the whole practice our bachelors talking about God the whole time I'm like glory I love this class I get the workout and think about God the whole time and if you've got me just all my heart the first thing I thought was can I pray for your son do you believe in prayer and I don't know what happened that word but I just went up to him I laid my hands up and said yes we believe in prayer I said the name of Jesus Christ that come against this headache and I'm just ready why because I was strengthened in the inner man they have to say well would he be I'd be embarrassed if he said no I don't know if I can share my faith I wasn't weak in the inner man I was strong I was bald I said therefore now I've heard about God I was working out it was good it was good to mr. Valentine he was saying how and I'll just very like the message he was saying something just exactly like the message he was saying how those people in power write history the way they want to and if there are corrupt people in power when they write their history books they'll leave things out there that should have been in there and if she said so that leaves a star on the people they don't get the truth and he said it's kinda like a Bible if you get a Bible and you don't get a part of the preach to you and I said I look back on you can see me mouthing that's the message they have a Bible but it's like they're not even here in whole entire chapters they're not hearing about Malachi 4 they're not hearing about revelation 10 or you can hear the book of Revelation that's just stuff cause some type of misspell what you can't understand this but we've got the save the Lord on my shirt up he's like he's like you were put on earth to share what you know I'm so stirred up it sounds ready and we're gonna have strength don't you that we're all gonna get weak Church what do you gotta do to feed that white dog so you feel strong again like you you're ready to fight the devil not not an arrogant way to say I won't bring on the devil but I'm ready for you singing I'm gonna cash it out never temptation whatever device comes my way we're to recognize it and pass it down to move forward in Christ's plan appreciate that was not mine Oakland now he says this verse seventeen yep now I got in something up that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith so he draws has a substance of pain that you such you and I have been rooted and grounded in love so what are we planted in church the love of God aren't you glad not the anger of God we're not going to anger God we're playing the love of God is love directed you better believe now this practice but we're not in the anger and indignation and judgment of God we're planted in God's love amen so that's where we should stand isn't the love of God and if your love are they then that you and I may be able to comprehend that means to obtain or proceed we should be able to perceive or understand with all saints so brothers and sisters you understand and we're planning to God's love we should be able to understand what is the breath which is the wick of God's love how why does God's love to see where this is going how do I use God though we sing that song so why you can't get around it Oh wonderful love that's the length of God's love how long is God's love hello mrs. know how wide is it how long is it what is the death of deep this God's love go and how high does God's love see the picture there Paul say all saints seem to understand that love at least Apollo has four dimensions to it right now that chair in front of you the chair sitting on it's got three dimensions it's got a length or width and height right but the Bible says that God's love has the fourth dimension it's gonna be safe I hope I don't lose it people exist I'm not a very smart person unemployment I teach first grade these are all basic stuff but the Bible said that we if we have this will know the love of God if we can see there's four parts to God's love we can know his love and understand it to a degree now now I'm not talking about you eternally understand everything about God's love that's not what I'm saying but you can understand God's love to a great a fourth degree or fourth dimension a fourth measure there's four descriptions to it that we can all understand and I believe you do but let's go through the scriptures on so we can see it because this will pass all your knowledge to understand the breadth the width the length and the height and the depth that he might be filled with all the force of God so if we really love this if we really get to know God's love will be filled with God's love if we're planning God's love what does the roots do it bringe what's already in the ground up into the plant how are you and if your planet in Christ and Christ is love then to all that will come into you will be past love it so simple if we're rooted in love then the fullness of love is going to fill us because we're planted in Christ now last week I'm not mistaken or maybe it was too even and I'm gonna spend two weeks ago forgetting we preach on the death of Satan versus the depth of God remember this it was the last church aid or the last time to your message I preached you you must bend to mensies we're going to talk about how the fire to your church age the churches that were off the word has a depth of Satan which turned out to be what murders and created murders lies abuse neglect all kinds of evil that was the depth of Satan and yet they joined church and they went to church every Sunday so see there was a false Christian life that is the death of Satan but memorable and said was the death of Christ was the man said it's very simple to know what the depth of God is and what did you read he read the verses I just read to you what is the death of God he says you're rooted and grounded in love well Graham said if you want to be deep and if you wouldn't be somebody see how humble you can be and trying to love everybody if you want to be everyone to be deeper in God how many want to be a real deep in Christ and grow deeper in love love more people especially your enemies especially those who say evil things against you that's the person to love I know it's hard truth but if we're rooting right of love we'll pull up that love right into our lives I gotta go see the home no I gotta come to church gotta hear the word of God you two get up watching the matrix you're gonna get a box Despicable Me part 3 you're not gonna get Christ's love that way yeah that's what you're planning on you let me play the Christ amen look if he says no one has a record of these verses then he's was three sixteen seventeen eighteen when a man experienced the death of God is life it's an actual personal experience of the Spirit of God in dwelling at him and noticed so this is your soul and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom I want to stop right there because we could go on I'm not gonna go not going to go the debts of safety so I've already preached on that it produces killing it's a church 20 spirit that they gathered announcer another interest in the launcher so what I want to focus on tonight in the last twenty two minutes we're really it's your mind how many appreciate you how God give you a spirit and you can have the right thinking amen how many dogs the greatest I love the phone someone look again at the mind because this is what the Bible teaches All Saints should be able to understand that Jose Livia all of us I complained all of us should understand the love of God and we understand the love of God in these four ways then we should be filled with all the fullness of God which is God's love right that's a paul says if you're really planted in Christ should be full of God's love so and I think this is what happened I think we forget about what God's love means to us and we get discouraged we stop beating ourselves up for own worst critic I know at least that's my life many times I've battled that beat my own worst critic I feel like I've done wrong and I think I've hurt somebody and really in all reality I never had you know I just jump to the wrong conclusion like I did something wrong I've got to go talk to the person you know because I always beat myself up you know like I did some pro my own worst critic now let's get that no let me let's go to this in the next 20 minutes we must use our minds that's a program said the personal experience with Christ is more of a reality when our minds are illuminated to the love of God so we must use our minds and remember the love of God this will transform our lives the numbers you'll think a transform fault life your thought to be transformed if you think about it remember the love of God you never think about go ahead to be different right you'll be able to think about work different I'll be able to think about work with a better attitude right cuz I got the love of God oh I've actually a missionary to my own school right I'm a missionary to my job I'm a missionary to my neighbors see you're getting your mug it's transformed to the love of God that's what the Bible says we're not conformed we're not being shaped more like the world we're being conformed and transformed by the renewing of our mind that's what the preaching is supposed to do I don't want to wear you out and preach but I want to preach long enough so that you start thinking about God and me too I think of this I'll take this servant with me tomorrow when I go where I go but I don't have I'll have strength within me someone that evil comes I'll strength to withstand it and how does that happen I read your mind and remember renew means to renovate yeah I remember when we renovated this room this is awful dirty I remember running through Anthony Bennett made this whole place forgive me stumble over my work there's a lot of renovation that need to be done filled on a drywall paint in scrap sanded down the walls tearing out all the carpet characters old nasty moldy carpet out of here there's a lot of renovations that need to be done but what do we got now well I got a place that's a little bit better you are not originally doing down with us a little bit better it's renovated it looks clean listen ooh you should be able to smell the carpet for a while and people should smell the sweetness of God in your life and appearances like a garden when you praise I going to garden and you should smell and we seen that song that dew is still on the roses we should smell the roses people should smell the sweetness of Christ on your life so we want to renovate your mind and when we renovate your mind what I mean is you change your thinking habits so you only think good about your enemies oh how can I love this person this teacher always in the streets mean how can I love them I had to do that last year I teach you to like me and wouldn't even talk to me I walk in the hallway you wouldn't even look at me I kept saying lord help me Lord and pretty soon they drop something and I'd be able to pick it up and say here you go and they'd have to recognize me there I'd say lord help you up help me up you know just show me love how it is there's nothing to show a lot you know because we have to change something at all this person hates me I'll never be able to instead think of that show love change your thought that's renewing your mind and that if you can change your habits of how do you think that will transform your life do it and then I guess then you can find the perfect will of God this is why people can never find the purple rule of God what am i doing in my life what's my purpose in life they don't get their minds renewed by the word they let their minds be unrung on unrenovated they don't thing on their minds they do something new with their thinking they always think the same thoughts instead of thinking what the word says now let's go this I got the 17 minutes here here with me now you saw it right you saw the Bible love's got four dimensions right it's got four dimensions now if you notice the future home only has three dimensions so if you look at revelation 21 16 we're out of time but the revelations 21 16 says there's thirteen thousand furlongs that I forgot many was it has the same number of furlongs for the breath as the length and the height but it doesn't have a depth I'm just pointing something out I'm not gonna be able to explain this the missing of depth I'm not really gonna explain that because I don't know I I don't know I'm not gonna try to make something up but I know the future home has three measurements a length a width and a height in Sioux pyramid right number but God's love has another dimension it has depth praise God that's the Word of God you can look it up yeah future only has three dimensions but love as it's worth them now you probably know this book value is measured like times width times height right but a volume of a pyramid so the future home you got in length times width times height times 1/3 because it's missing a third of them the value because it's not a cutie it's a triangle triangle point to it so volume is the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object as measured in cubic units okay so that's just become a scientific definition so the future home has value right but it's only got three dimensions now the Britannica says that dimension is a measurement of an object but it says three dimensional three dimensions measure spaces so like the chair or this open this hat this is three dimensional has length width height and it measures the space that this Pope it occupies right in space but a fourth dimension gets into time so when you have a four dimensions now you start measuring time right where four numbers are needed to characterize a point three to fix a point in space and one to fix the time right so I can't explain this very well like I said I'm not a man I'm not a doctorate of science I had very little science training in school but I've done a three dimensional figure who's got a three dimension has length width height but a fourth dimension now places the time so this pulpit in time is right here in 2017 if you went back to 2001 in the time and the fourth dimension this would have been in Florida Ohio Craig and days house though so if you measure the fourth dimension this would have been western Ohio now we take the fourth dimension today now it's in Akron Ohio in 2017 because we're measuring a different measurement we're measuring time so length width height right here it's occupying this but where does it were when is it what is it being measured it's being measured right now so that's just one example of a four dimensional measurement right you never understand that is okay you also mention the time not just the length width height but that's time when did it happen okay now I want to just lay this in here and hope this doesn't go over your head but I believe these four tie in perfectly with the four powers got be must because the powers of power what the Holy Ghost and what does the Holy Ghost love so I believe these four powers type perfectly with the four descriptions of God love it's easiest to start here which of these anointings goes the highest mutters there's a lion ox with Mary go go higher are you with me and flying eagle goes higher than all of them man you're heavy now when we get to the depth of God's love this that actually means is thank you so the of these 3 remaining anointings which one is the deepest man has the deepest intelligence yeah that's why you still alive in the dinosaurs aren't right there's some other reasons what I do or the what are some extinct animals the dodo bird right yeah what's that other five dog one what's that dog when we talked about me okay how's me that's a mean tiger yeah little dog looks like a tiger has broke beautiful beautiful animal but it succeed now but it didn't survive because the man was smarter right my man had more understanding to kill him right now late this long which of these animals can labor the longest the ice he'll work all day just God said just get one day off on Sunday all right get your animals and they are us he can labor in how long enema now breath is the widest which man's which these has the widest Dominion a lion has the widest Dominion he rules the entire kingdom amen that's rad pipe down this is the one that maybe I got a little bit I could fix this a little bit but these three can clearly be see I'm just gonna lay that in there God's love has four aspects to it four elements that we're supposed to understand can we see that so to comprehend the love of Christ that we are planted in we must think God's love has breadth or width God's love is wide God's love is long right God's love is deep or this case deep in God's mind and also God's love has height grace God it's got four dimensions to it so let's just quickly go for this I got about 12 minutes so let's go to this oh this is okay enjoying this hi God's grace I just want you to know that this is inspired God's Word is inspired if God love has four parts there's got to be four parts to it somewhere it has to have another dimension other than just length width height range it's got something greater dimension there's just something natural because it's supernatural now God's love as Rebecca or we'd say with and Psalms 103 12 tells us that God's love has the wit to it God's love is so wide here's what it says as far as the east is from the west so far we have removed our transgressions from us memory see that God steps it in his love and he moves my Sid and completely as far as the East is from the West as far wide as that could possibly be measured God's love separates me from my sin in such a wit that I can't even comprehend him they met in church if you know science scientists can't even measure how big the universes they can't even measure they have no way to measure and it's constantly expanding to do I side into what he didn't he didn't publish that at first he thought it was a fixed system he thought the universe was a fixed system he'd never expanded but it was in his notes yet in his notes and then later after he died it got his nose and they found out hey he didn't believe this he just didn't publish you because even I'm not proof for it the universe is constantly expanding so what does that mean what does it mean for us if you look at this it means our sins are so far we can't even we don't have to worry about they're so far from us crisis love was totally stepped in and it separate us as far as East is from the West from our sins that make you love the Lord if you really believe that then you should be like this woman jesus said her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much this means forgiveness of this multitude should make you love Christ if Christ love is so wide that it separates you so far from all your awful sins that should produce a great love inside of your heart hey then it's God's love white church you better believe it it's so wide it separates all your sins from you amen and this is one of the elements of God's love we must remember remember Cain said where they live right at the door where are your sins why farmers and East is from the West that's exactly right church that's the Word of God degree then how many believe that Scripture right there it's so far you can't it's just like the end of the universe you can't even see it so your sins are that far gone as well alright let's see the next one God's love has length not love lasts a long time so I'm 23 6 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me what all the days of my life it's so long brother amen it lasts all my days God's mercy for me it's not going to quit when I turn 40 which I'm getting closer it's not going to quit when I turn 50 it's not going to quit it lasts so long it's all of my days hallelujah the Bible says I will seen the mercy Lord forever with my mouth why make known by faithfulness to all generations Christ and mercy shall be build up for how long this mercy lasts forever amen beyond my generation if there's another generation they met which is now title insurance if there's another generation we go off the scene God's mercy said to that generation that's how long it is it's wide enough to separate us from our sins and it's long enough to extend for all of your life and then all generations amen now you're getting though the love of God now a church you should feel the love of God because that's what's planted in the ground that's what's in Christ and that should be building you up to know God's love for man hey remember that don't see what God's love to love other people same idea the length of God's love for the Lord is good as mercy as what never lasts it's so long it'll last forever his truth endureth to up all generations this message truth and we preach will go to every generation again I'm just glad I'm just glad to stand for my generation church I'm just happy to be one of those that will stand in this generation but this truth will keep going to every generation God will never leave himself without a witness why this is love is so long in the last average information look at God told Israel I love Israel without the baptism Holy Ghost without his sealing them how much more wouldn't love us because the Lord what did God hate Israel know he loved them and because he would he would keep the oath which he had sworn on your father's house the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you are the house of diamonds from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore that the LORD thy God He is God the faithful God hurry that again he is God the faithful God which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that loveth honey love them and heat Commandments - how many a thousand generation and glory this is just our generation right this and this scriptures true and he loved me in my generation he's all of 900 but night Leonard there's a thousand five hundred ninety-nine right 999 more generations what does he say he say my love will never fail my love is so long it will not feel any generation that's glorious church it might seem like God's love is failure you know we don't see God's love look to the believer they enjoy it every day they thank God for it every day because they're abounding with Thanksgiving they met in the promises of God so you see how this is very simple anybody see that the four parts of God's love it's why it's different so wide it separates us from all of our sin before you it's so long it goes to all of my life and a thousand generations and now it's so deep that it goes back into the deep parts of God's mind before the foundation of the world the Bible said all of the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are judgments and his ways past finding out who have known the what mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor so what are the depths of God me the depths of God meet the plan of God that was in his mind way before we even got here that was God's love that means he was thinking loving thoughts to you and I don't appreciate his life hey visions too far but God who is rich in mercy for his not just love but great love amen where it wherewith he loved us aren't you glad he loved you in a great way even when we were dead in sins even when I was living in the sinner smoking drinking and all kinds of evil even when I was dead in my sins he quickened us together with Christ by grace he are saving man and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus did you catch that church the Bible said he quickened us with Christ praise the Lord when you were dead and sin before you came to Christ he already quickened you with Christ why did he quit in Christ well when he filled with the Holy Ghost but then he quickened his body you'd raise him up from the dead praise the Lord so when he quicken Christ he actually quicken you why because you were already in him praise God because the Spirit of God was in him and you've got a part of God's Spirit amen hi there yeah did the Bible say the fullness of the Godhead but he was in Christ all that God was was a somebody understand that so God's all God's Spirit powers in Christ right so you are part of Christ you're a seat of is your pardon so when he raised up Christ you read him a part of you was it in him amen oh and also before knew you in his night and he had raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places so you know we don't they live in the we rather live in the dump Church we can live in heavenly areas praise God we can live in a heavenly realm of Jesus aren't you glad you could do that whoever wants to live here depression and fear their whole life who wants to live a life of depression and drudgery and hopelessness does anybody want to do that here no he raised us up so we would sit in heavenly places spiritual things spiritual promises hold joy love a future that's what God promised us we should live in heavenly place man for when you and I were yet without strength in due time Christ died for us the ungodly but God commended or meaning validated his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than now being justified by his blood we should be saved from wrath through Eden honey justified today if you repented and got baptized you're justified how many God how he justifies today man that means you're righteous he declares your exits that means you didn't says never sit in the first place praise God that's a justification means you're declared he calls you you're righteous your sins went upon him but now you're righteous gonna be happy tonight my god so we ought to be happy in here about the love of God this is what it means my sin well here I kind of issue it on him and his holiness is on me because I'm planted in him I planted the garden of the perfect love of God amen glory house not going to condemn me when I'm playing it is the love of God and the Spirit of Christ when I'm in Christ how can he get me can't because I'm in Christ born this is one of the most lovely scriptures in the Bible according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world how deep is God's love brother and sister it's so deep he chose us before the world was ever was and he knew well in 2017 I'll need a bride there she'll have to be a certain type of person chapters to love God and I'll I'll arranged it i'll predestinate them to be conformed to the image of jesus and they'll just be waiting to hear my word they might not even know if somebody really hungry for more and others might just be on the road but I'll make myself known to them and when I make myself notice them this spirit of the word the water will fall on that seat in their soul and it'll spring forth and then we're screwed and they'll be rooted and grounded gonna be planted in living water let me plant it in Christ amen hallelujah where'd he chooses in his mind in the depths of his mind imagine we have a hard enough time just keeping our schedules can you imagine God's schedule then he had his mind think of 1999 and 2000 we gotta think of all these events and he had all this planned is where the depths of his mind the breadth the length and the depth of gun how many see God's love so far in those three Oh glory go is my love it's long love his deep love in the parts of his mind oh my what I'm time I got to finish here time run over but if you read that whole first chapter it's one of most mortgage hackers in the Bible that was not just read lesson that we should be walk to the praise of his glory we should live our lives to praise Him because he loved us first and chose us to be his children last one so I'm almost done by God's grace I appreciate your patience you've been very good audience and I appreciate your love and there's my here's my hour so I'm gonna finish it here let me let me set another timer so between all the kids sometimes I forget about my our God's love has hiked let me know that now the Bible says in Psalm 139 that his thoughts are so high but I don't look at this don't look at another phone this God's love is high God's love extends to the so I'm thirty six five nine mercy O Lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reaches unto the clouds you ever flowed through the clouds at airplane you can imagine I'm flying amongst God's faithfulness this is how high God's faithfulness reaches to me okay so this is how faithful guidance to me as high as I am I'm thirty thousand feet on the 787 Boeing planet Austria the country and this is how high God's faithfulness will reach to me Hey Psalms 103 ten money he has knocked out with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities how many can say matter that gozman we're better team than you deserve for as the heaviness high above the earth so great is his mercy for them appeared we just said that the heavens right in space the heavens the atmospheres they're so high above and that is a figure for us to see how great God's mercy is for us if you everything God's done with you all you have to do the Bible says it look at the clouds I want you to just look at the heavens look at space but look at space look at the Stars one time if you ever think God's mercy love is ran out for you God set those things with the bottom st. for signs and seasons for a sign to show you how much mercy he has for you Psalms 108 for for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reaches unto the clouds I said this on Sunday were you getting which hope we have as an anchor of the soul so our souls are anchored in the hope of Christ well sure in fact said fast and which enters into within the mail so our hope enters into the heavenly temple the seventh dimension whither the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made after a knock made and high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek let's review our wedding we must use our minds and remember the love of God All Saints you're trying to remember this we try to do in church and try to remember how wide God's love is for you how long does God's love last how deep this God's love go how high is God's love to you I would say it's very high I would say it's very great then if we if we thought about God's love like that all the time we the Bible said will be filled with all the fullness of God this is how much God loves me it's not much god bless you Christ love put a wide distance between us and our sins the length of Christ's love is unending forever the depth of Christ's love prepared for and planned for our part even crucified Jesus in his mind before the foundation of the world in perfect plan for our quickening and our acceptance in the beloved and that's before the foundation of the world that's the best answer just a lot easier than writing it all out that's what God's love did for you and I it has a whole plan I'm gonna plan out I'm gonna make sure everything goes the planet sometimes our plans fail right but you better believe God's plan for you my man you submit and humble yourself to God's love this plan for you will be perfect it might not be without paying sorrows with etiquette the Bible said of Christ supper we have to suffer how many want to reign with Christ every little throne with Christ the Bible said if you want to reign with him you have to suffer with him so part of my story part of the plan God has for me is going to involve some suffering but I'm willing to endure it so I can sit by him and I can partake the but he partook so I understand what he went through in a little measure and that's how I show my love to is by saying yes Lord I hope I'll suffer but I'll do it for your glory because I know you love me ultimately above all finished I know you loved and I don't want to forget that that you love me Jesus the love of Christ is so high that it reaches to the heavens even to the very throne Christ that's how great he just loved this posture how can how can I show my love to God if God loves me that much in four dimensions if God loves me that much how can I show my love brother it tells us he says the cloudy skies and storms a lot let's hit our feet here the cloudy skies in storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval see when you go through a trial that doesn't mean nouns disapproving with your life neither our bright skies and still other signs of God love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved which is headed his love is elected which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes but how should we know there's two ways my mansion will know God's love he should know because he said so if the Word of God says he loves us he died for us before we can even love him and the second thing the second way we know he loved us is that he gave us his spirit placing us his sons with the baptism of the Holy Ghost how should I prove my love back to if he's done all this for the atom invade the planets in the universe how hide why if he's done all this to show me how much he loves me and how much he'll be faithful to me how should I love him brother grant says this just believe what he said okay men and then conduct myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his depth of his wisdom now see the depth of his wisdom allow us to come to pass I think about the Hosea my God allow certain things different trials to go through but you know what for the hose ain't promised God allowed that to happen we lose it thank God was for the hose a God wants me in my trials to stand there and conduct myself with joy because I know God's love allowed this to happen this is gonna draw me closer to Christ a man as hard as it may be as awful as it may seem this hardship is gonna draw me closer to Christ huh we only say oh how can I love God more Lord I wanna do something for you you forget about this sometimes just be joyful in your trial just understand that God's love brought you to it like that sign says if he brought you to it I'll bring it through like our our dry cleaner always have different signs about God and that was one of the signs I said I love your side if Christ brings you to it they'll bring you through it so we have to overcome right we have said overcome how do you overcome by taking the word the promise in humility humbly walking with God accepting what has happened if God allowed this his love about this the depths of God's love allowed this trial to happen and I would trust him in the midst of the trial I'm gonna close with that by God's grace I had two songs on my heart anybody remember that song your love O Lord a third day saying everybody remember that sup okay and then the love of God reaches to the highest mountain the thing those songs before we close here now how many want to sing it to Jesus a lot of a thankful heart I mean a man if we're rooted if weren't really planning
