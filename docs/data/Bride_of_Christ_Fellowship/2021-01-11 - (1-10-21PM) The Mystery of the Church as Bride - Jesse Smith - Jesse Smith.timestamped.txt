[27:26] special thank you

[27:29] appreciate that

[27:42] i really appreciate that beautiful thank
[27:44] you wonderful songs brother really
[27:45] enjoyed that by god's grace beautiful
[27:48] praise god ephesians chapter 5 verse 32
[27:54] i'd like to start this next chapter here
[27:56] this is chapter 4
[27:57] of the upcoming book by god's grace
[28:00] it's called the mystery of the new
[28:02] testament church as the bride of christ
[28:05] so this is uh we finished lord willing
[28:07] wednesday night if you didn't listen
[28:08] that that was on daniel's 70 weeks we
[28:10] kind of finished with that
[28:11] uh and i just got an email about that
[28:13] today from a brother overseas i thought
[28:14] that was really uh
[28:16] interesting i don't know if he listened
[28:17] to it or not but if it's not then that
[28:19] would be really interesting like
[28:20] perhaps god's working on both ends to
[28:23] help people out but
[28:24] um we finished chapter three up and then
[28:26] we're looking at chapter four
[28:28] here today by god's grace
[28:35] can you just real quick switch over to
[28:37] my phone just for a moment before we
[28:39] read the text i just want to show the
[28:40] progress we got
[28:41] so far on the book
[28:45] um so i'm actually 57 percent done
[28:50] because yesterday i finished the rapture
[28:51] so it's
[28:52] i did the rough draft was that was all
[28:53] done september
[28:55] um and then i was waiting for all the
[28:57] edits from my one editor but
[28:59] she kind of stopped editing i don't know
[29:01] why but lydia started to help me back up
[29:02] so lydia thank you
[29:04] so uh i just got one two three four
[29:06] lydia is currently editing the seven
[29:08] church age chapter
[29:10] uh but the final ones this one's now
[29:12] done too so i'm 57
[29:14] done and uh i just thought you know
[29:17] you know with my other editor not
[29:19] helping out it's kind of slowed me back
[29:20] a little bit but
[29:21] i'm not quitting praise god i'm not a
[29:23] quitter i think it's going to help
[29:24] people
[29:25] and anyways that's just kind of my
[29:26] progress there by god's grace i just i'm
[29:28] really sharing it to you to encourage me
[29:30] not to quit
[29:31] okay because i know it gets uh
[29:34] anytime you do a long project or
[29:35] something like that you gotta just gotta
[29:37] keep yourself encouraged like david you
[29:38] just got to
[29:39] encourage yourself in the lord so i just
[29:42] thought i'd
[29:43] kind of show that for my sake i don't
[29:45] give up and quit
[29:46] got to stay focused here so ephesians 5
[29:50] 32 we'll look at the church
[29:53] as the bride of christ it's a great
[29:55] mystery paul says not a small one not a
[29:57] sin not a
[29:58] not an easy mystery or something like
[30:00] that it's a great mystery
[30:03] ephesians 5 32.
[30:14] all right let's just read that together
[30:15] on three one two
[30:17] three this is a great mystery but i
[30:20] speak concerning christ and the church
[30:23] let's have one more word of prayer here
[30:25] ask the lord to minister to us heavenly
[30:27] father good lord our hands are up our
[30:29] hearts are up lord we're humbled here in
[30:31] your presence lord we're grateful for
[30:33] the
[30:33] service this morning the worship and the
[30:35] word and the fellowship in between lord
[30:37] we're just so happy
[30:39] we're so thankful for all that you've
[30:41] done lord and
[30:42] oh lord you're you're moving us you're
[30:44] driving us into
[30:45] a preparation for your coming and we're
[30:48] excited lord
[30:49] as your prophet said if if the lord
[30:51] would have asked him
[30:52] any time to live he would have chose
[30:54] this time and so lord although the
[30:56] pressures seem to be mounting lord god
[30:58] yet we know we have peace with you
[31:00] lord god and you'll you'll deliver us
[31:02] from this lord god you promise not to
[31:04] let your bride go through the wrath
[31:06] of god so we thank you for that lord god
[31:09] and we ask here tonight god you'll
[31:10] minister to us by the word of god
[31:13] through the holy spirit i do pray lord
[31:15] for jose god and for his daughter jolene
[31:17] god that you'll open up the way that she
[31:19] can get home
[31:20] this is her third try to go home please
[31:22] open up the way
[31:24] let her have a negative covet test dear
[31:26] god and
[31:27] please bring healing to brother jose
[31:29] lord in jesus name
[31:30] lord i pray for stephen as well or he uh
[31:32] there's a question about his job
[31:34] situation lord we just pray
[31:36] lord you provide him a secure job lord
[31:38] god just guide him lord god and
[31:40] uh either restore this company's ability
[31:43] to
[31:44] to have employees or lord open up a
[31:46] better job for him lord god and bless
[31:47] him
[31:48] as he labors for you lord god as he
[31:50] works on his schoolwork
[31:52] and father lastly for sister naomi lord

[31:55] rest there lord god
[31:57] minister to them here even in the home
[31:59] lord god minister to nature and virtue
[32:01] and eden and
[32:02] sister beatrice and all the saints dear
[32:04] god bless them
[32:05] god let them get rested up tonight here
[32:07] and father we're just so grateful
[32:09] lord for all the sacrifices lord the
[32:11] saints in the house of god receive our
[32:13] worship receipt receive our praise
[32:14] tonight lord
[32:15] anoint me to speak anointing us all to
[32:17] hear in jesus christ's name
[32:19] the church said amen god bless you as
[32:21] you're being seated praise the lord
[32:24] i don't have any quotes really to show
[32:25] tonight i'm just going to be preaching
[32:26] kind of off my notes
[32:28] here for this uh
[32:31] chapter here
[32:34] yeah if you can just remember brother
[32:36] stephen in prayer he said their company
[32:37] is
[32:38] getting rid of their machines a little
[32:39] bit so he's not sure about the future of
[32:42] that company and everybody needs
[32:43] employment so let's remember him
[32:46] by the grace of the lord jose's daughter
[32:49] i guess this is her third chance to try
[32:50] to fly out to nicaragua
[32:52] he said and they're not refunding her
[32:54] ticket money either
[32:56] because she they didn't get the covent
[32:57] test or something like that so it's not
[32:59] a very good situation let's just
[33:00] remember them in prayer
[33:02] that this week they'll be able to get
[33:04] that out
[33:06] uh let's pray for that here okay i think
[33:08] that's it all right
[33:10] okay so let's look to the word of god
[33:12] here tonight
[33:14] uh here's what i like to do i like to
[33:15] just look at uh the text here
[33:18] uh the confusion surrounding this why is
[33:21] this such a great mystery
[33:22] or what is the mystery of this topic and
[33:25] then uh
[33:26] i want to show how jesus defines this as
[33:28] a mystery
[33:30] uh and jesus defines that the church is
[33:32] the bride
[33:33] because it really doesn't matter what
[33:34] any denomination says it matters what
[33:36] jesus said
[33:37] praise god and jesus calls a certain
[33:40] group
[33:40] as his bride and he calls himself the
[33:42] bridegroom
[33:44] and then lord willing i think i'll just
[33:46] close with astor so give me i'll set a
[33:47] 45 minute timer again here i'll try not
[33:49] to wear you out or wear myself out i
[33:51] hope you enjoyed the word of god this
[33:52] morning was it a blessing
[33:54] praise god i hope so and i apologize you
[33:56] know bang and see it couldn't be here
[33:57] but uh
[33:58] uh we do have do we do we do the
[34:00] audacity on that one
[34:02] okay that's right because we stopped
[34:03] because we're out of okay yep
[34:05] so i he and i could just talk about that
[34:07] in this there's really nothing that too
[34:08] deep in there
[34:10] but anyways lord bless them and good to
[34:11] see them in the house of lord tonight
[34:13] praise the lord so uh we start with
[34:16] ephesians 5 32 paul he's just laid out
[34:21] from verse
[34:21] 22 to 32
[34:24] how a man and woman are to treat one
[34:28] another in the christian
[34:30] home and this is totally different to
[34:32] any roman culture
[34:34] right as we looked at that last year uh
[34:36] roman culture a woman was just a piece
[34:38] of property just like a a table or a
[34:41] chair
[34:42] and a man could have her you know beaten
[34:45] or
[34:46] you know divorced and all anything just
[34:48] like the children the man had total
[34:50] control
[34:51] he could have bad things happen to the
[34:52] women children um
[34:54] and they didn't really have any respect
[34:56] one to another
[34:58] right um
[35:01] but then the christian way of life that
[35:02] paul was introducing was totally
[35:04] it was like 180 it was upside down
[35:07] literally or spiritually it turned their
[35:08] lives upside down praise god
[35:10] because it didn't make the man the
[35:12] know-it-all it made the man the servant
[35:15] right he's not the
[35:16] he's not the arrogant lord or he's a
[35:19] know-it-all it actually made him the
[35:20] servant and turn the total upset
[35:22] upside down because jesus christ came
[35:24] not to be served
[35:26] but to be the servant and so that's why
[35:28] i look at my life as a husband
[35:30] i'm a servant how can i serve my family
[35:32] uh my selfishness gets in the way
[35:34] but the holy spirit gives me more grace
[35:36] praise god
[35:38] amen that's i hope that hope everybody
[35:40] can relate to that you know
[35:41] we all need to uh overcome our
[35:43] selfishness
[35:44] but paul uh paul lays it out in 22-20
[35:49] i'm sorry 22-32 the bulk of this chapter
[35:51] deals with
[35:52] these verses and i'm not going to go
[35:54] through this tonight but there's five
[35:55] instructions he gives
[35:57] to married couples there's five
[35:58] instructions and he says this is a great
[36:01] mystery
[36:02] so see sisters your life is a mystery to
[36:05] the world
[36:06] brothers when you're a real man your
[36:08] life is a mystery not
[36:09] a small one it's a great mystery how our
[36:12] families can operate with such unity
[36:15] how there can be such love in a home
[36:17] praise god
[36:19] because my wife and i surely grew up in
[36:20] a home where there was no message
[36:22] believers there right and
[36:23] we know the hurt we know the pain caused
[36:26] in a home like that
[36:28] and and people come now and they talk
[36:29] about the love they feel in our
[36:31] house you know and they talk about the
[36:33] spirit of god you know
[36:34] one time my mom came and visited for a
[36:36] few days and she left weeping she's
[36:38] saying this is
[36:39] she said this is amazing this family she
[36:41] said i just
[36:42] i think she called it the picture
[36:43] perfect family and i'm not boasting or
[36:44] anything like that
[36:45] we can only boast in christ but when you
[36:47] apply god's word to your house you get
[36:49] results from it
[36:51] and so i remember one time she left
[36:52] weeping and crying saying this is just
[36:54] such a blessing and
[36:55] so that was vindication to me that we're
[36:57] on the right road where
[36:59] jesus is the way i'm on the way he's the
[37:02] truth he's the life right
[37:04] uh and so this is a great mystery it's a
[37:07] great thing to try to grasp and
[37:09] understand
[37:10] that two people can be so uh dedicated
[37:12] to one another
[37:14] in service to one another praise god
[37:17] and so paul uses a marriage relationship
[37:20] uh to express this mystery
[37:23] praise god now i'm going to get right to
[37:26] it like i said i'm going to try to watch
[37:27] my time here tonight
[37:30] uh so the confusion that i've found at
[37:32] least in the people i have talked with
[37:34] is who is the bride which group is the
[37:37] bride
[37:38] now there's a small group uh there's a
[37:41] small group
[37:41] that doesn't even think there's a bride
[37:44] now the reason i say that's because when
[37:45] we first started this church we put up a
[37:47] website in 2008 or 2009.
[37:49] you know bride of christ fellowship at
[37:51] the top and i started getting numerous
[37:52] emails like what do you mean you're the
[37:54] bride there's no such thing as a bride
[37:55] and i'm like
[37:56] i typed in these verses like from john
[37:58] chapter three like jesus says there's a
[38:00] bride and
[38:01] i can't remember what their
[38:03] justification was for that
[38:05] but it didn't move me at all because i
[38:06] know the bible says that there's a bride
[38:09] amen so there's a small group that
[38:11] doesn't really believe the bride is a
[38:13] physician
[38:14] but most churches recognize jesus has a
[38:17] bride
[38:19] but the question is who is she and
[38:22] uh what which group is she now some
[38:25] people say like the universalist they'll
[38:27] say everybody's the bride right every
[38:29] but we know that's not true right
[38:32] we know uh there's a group that's the
[38:34] wise virgin that's the bride
[38:36] there's a foolish virgin she's the
[38:38] rejected bride and then there's the
[38:39] imposter bride
[38:41] right the roman catholic church so
[38:43] there's really if you look at scripture
[38:45] there's three brides
[38:47] right if you look at the scripture
[38:48] there's the wise the virgin they're both
[38:50] saved
[38:51] one's the true bride uh one's rejected
[38:54] and then the third is the imposter who
[38:56] has the abominations on her foreheads
[38:58] right
[38:59] mother harlot mystery babylon and her
[39:02] daughters
[39:03] and she's got daughters so
[39:06] the evidence is not in what the groups
[39:08] claim the evidence is in the way they
[39:10] live
[39:11] praise god that proves they are the
[39:14] bride of christ
[39:15] like brother adam said the beauty of a
[39:16] church is the character of the people
[39:20] right it's it's judged in how obedient
[39:23] they
[39:24] are to jesus's commands so here's the
[39:27] revelation i just
[39:28] remember i try to summarize these in one
[39:29] sentence the revelation is the true
[39:31] church
[39:32] submits to all of jesus's commands now
[39:35] with the promises of being raptured and
[39:38] then ruling and reigning with her
[39:40] husband
[39:40] in the millennium praise god so that's
[39:43] what i found
[39:44] because jesus said uh when you're born
[39:46] of god
[39:47] you are guided into all truth by the
[39:49] holy spirit amen
[39:50] praise god so uh this is
[39:53] uh all devoted to that this next
[39:56] teaching so get your bibles ready let's
[39:58] go through i'm going to get lydia
[39:59] malachi anybody else want to read let me
[40:00] know i
[40:01] i'll i'll take all the reasons elizabeth
[40:02] you want to read all right i saw her
[40:04] raise your hand thank you appreciate
[40:05] that
[40:06] so we'll have we'll go lydia malachi and
[40:08] elizabeth for readers
[40:10] okay lydia mark 2 19-20
[40:15] uh malachi
[40:18] john 3 28 malachi
[40:23] and then elizabeth revelation 22
[40:26] 17. let's do those three i'll be
[40:29] preaching a little bit in between here
[40:30] just to kind of give my
[40:31] thoughts okay what i thought were
[40:34] inspirations from the holy spirit
[40:36] okay so let me go ahead mark 2 19 and
[40:50] 20.
[40:55] amen okay so jesus here calls himself
[40:58] the bridegroom
[40:59] what a strange thing he's a young rabbi
[41:02] preacher
[41:03] right a lot of people like him at the
[41:05] beginning he's healing everybody
[41:07] after a while he starts bringing out the
[41:09] correction he starts bringing out the
[41:11] doctrine and the prophecy and then they
[41:12] hate him but he calls himself
[41:15] the bridegroom i'm the bridegroom
[41:18] beautiful now twice in two parables
[41:21] we're not going to read these but you're
[41:22] familiar
[41:23] in the king sun parable in matthew 22
[41:25] verses 1 to 14
[41:27] jesus places himself he's the engaged
[41:30] son
[41:31] who's awaiting believers who will accept
[41:33] the father's invitation
[41:35] to come to his wedding and wear the
[41:37] right garments praise god
[41:38] he places himself as the son getting
[41:41] married praise god
[41:42] amen praise the lord and then you know
[41:44] the ten versions the parable of the ten
[41:46] versions
[41:47] he likens him himself unto the the
[41:49] bridegroom who comes at an unknown hour
[41:52] and those that are ready got to go out
[41:54] to meet him praise god
[41:56] amen they got to get their oil they got
[41:58] to get all all the oil they got stored
[41:59] up they got to clear off
[42:00] their wicks and get it all prepared and
[42:02] go out to meet the bridegroom and then
[42:04] the bridegroom says
[42:05] tells that the foolish version no you
[42:08] can't come in
[42:09] right i never knew you so what what a
[42:12] picture there what a picture
[42:14] so you have a group that's the trooper
[42:15] that goes in as part with the bride and
[42:17] then a group that's kept out she's
[42:18] rejected
[42:20] so it's perfection in three we can see
[42:22] it again
[42:24] what a picture now this is beautiful
[42:27] john the baptist how many believe was a
[42:28] prophet
[42:30] cause jesus the bridegroom and us the
[42:32] bride
[42:33] so malachi can you read that john 3
[42:36] 28-31
[42:43] christ please but that i have set before
[42:45] him
[42:46] he that has to write a surprise to the
[42:48] friend of the bridegroom which stands
[42:49] for here's him
[42:51] greatly because with the brightest voice
[42:53] this is my
[42:54] this might be their first fulfill he
[43:00] amen he read the next verse he that
[43:02] cometh from god or from above all
[43:11] amen so that shows john is speaking of
[43:13] heavenly things praise god
[43:15] he's talking about a heavenly bridegroom
[43:17] a heavenly bride praise god
[43:19] i love that see a real prophet of god
[43:21] who's got the spirit of elijah
[43:23] he just rejoices hearing the voice of
[43:25] god
[43:26] he doesn't call i'm the voice of god
[43:28] like they're saying today
[43:30] you know what they're saying today
[43:31] brother man is the voice of god no no
[43:33] he's the friend of the bridegroom praise
[43:35] god he rejoices in the voice of jesus
[43:37] praise god
[43:38] what a difference my that's a good
[43:39] scripture to use for that group i never
[43:41] thought about that till now
[43:43] he said i'm not the christ john says he
[43:45] said he that hath the bride see we're
[43:47] not married to brother branham we're
[43:49] married to jesus christ amen
[43:51] brother pointed us to jesus christ
[43:53] hallelujah
[43:54] oh thank the lord praise god and he
[43:57] stands there rejoicing
[43:58] because of jesus's voice amen hallelujah
[44:02] so brother
[44:03] had to rejoice in what jesus was saying
[44:05] the word of god
[44:06] praise god and that made his joy
[44:08] fulfilled i love this now
[44:10] listen he must increase i must just
[44:13] decrease boy but a lot of people don't
[44:14] like that one around the message
[44:16] john the spirit of elijah has to
[44:18] decrease
[44:19] that christ may increase amen
[44:23] now it's interesting a lot of people say
[44:24] we have the spirit of elijah now
[44:26] and left brother branham and comes on us
[44:27] i don't know about that
[44:29] i can't find that in the scripture uh
[44:31] myself unless you use the type of elijah
[44:34] and elisha
[44:35] but then we've got to find like where
[44:36] brother am taught that so that could be
[44:38] a whole nother subject i have to study
[44:39] on that
[44:40] but see the idea is the the man the one
[44:43] who's pointing to the messiah has to
[44:45] decrease
[44:46] so that jesus may be emphasized
[44:49] right and and uh you know we've all been
[44:51] to churches where they say brother and
[44:52] brother brandon brother
[44:53] and it's just it's too much right it's
[44:55] too much emphasis on brother branham
[44:57] right there's times we need to mention
[44:59] the prophet of god just like you would
[45:00] uh you know john or paul or any of those
[45:03] so to us it's the same thing right
[45:05] uh because brother adam is pointing back
[45:07] to the word right like martin luther
[45:09] pointed back to the word
[45:10] but there's this idea where church we
[45:12] have to have in other words we have to
[45:13] have our own testimony
[45:15] we're not getting to heaven on brother
[45:16] branham's testimony
[45:18] right brother didn't fight your battles
[45:20] with our bridegroom praise god
[45:22] amen and i know that gets you know some
[45:25] people's feathers ruffled but
[45:27] if you really understand it you'll see
[45:28] it's true our emphasis has to be on the
[45:31] holy spirit
[45:32] uh interacting hearing his voice and
[45:35] seeing him live in our lives
[45:36] amen okay elizabeth you want to try
[45:39] revelation 22 17.
[45:58] whoever
[46:05] amen praise god beautiful you have the
[46:07] bride
[46:08] and jesus speaking together at the end
[46:10] time
[46:11] praise god so right here before the end
[46:14] time the spirit that's the holy spirit
[46:16] that's jesus and the bride are saying
[46:19] come praise god amen both are hearing
[46:22] both are speaking right she's speaking
[46:25] with him she's saying what he said
[46:27] praise god they're giving it out and
[46:29] they're inviting anyone to come and see
[46:31] praise god
[46:32] now let me just lay this in here i
[46:34] didn't really plan to preach this but go
[46:35] to john 17 verse 9. i don't have this in
[46:37] the book
[46:38] but go to john 17 verse 9.
[46:43] you know i've heard people say oh don't
[46:44] pray for the world because
[46:46] jesus didn't pray for the world well
[46:48] it's kind of different you know
[46:50] jesus god would have given him
[46:52] understanding on who to pray for and who
[46:54] not to
[46:55] right but look the bible just said
[46:57] whosoever will let him come that's
[46:59] everybody right
[47:00] so the bible just said the holy spirit
[47:02] and the bride invite everybody to come
[47:06] so we would do the same thing we invite
[47:08] everybody to come
[47:10] but we know not everybody will come
[47:12] right but it has to go to all nations i
[47:14] have to go to
[47:15] every people group right um but now
[47:18] jesus he had god gave him special
[47:21] knowledge so if you read
[47:23] john 17 9
[47:27] i pray for them i pray not for the world
[47:31] but for them which thou hast given me
[47:34] for they
[47:34] are thine so it's interesting
[47:38] here jesus says i don't pray for the
[47:40] world but did you catch us
[47:41] after you resurrected he said go into
[47:43] all the world
[47:44] and preach the gospel praise god see
[47:47] that
[47:48] so jesus he had only had a short time on
[47:50] earth 33 years
[47:52] he couldn't spend his time praying for
[47:53] this the world
[47:55] right before this is this isn't right
[47:57] before he goes to gethsemane
[47:58] many many scholars say this is on the
[48:00] way to gethsemane he's talking about the
[48:02] holy spirit's going to come and he's
[48:04] praying
[48:05] and he says i'm not praying for the
[48:07] world i'm praying for those
[48:09] that you've given me that will hear the
[48:11] word of god
[48:13] so jesus directly prayed for the elect
[48:16] amen for you and i
[48:17] praise god in fact i wrote that my book
[48:19] brother amen i choked to bang too but
[48:21] he's a little bit further away
[48:22] i said jesus prayed for me neither pray
[48:25] i for these alone but for them also
[48:27] which shall believe on me through their
[48:28] word
[48:29] jesus prayed for me he prayed for you he
[48:32] prayed for all those that would
[48:34] hear the gospel through all the
[48:36] preachers ordained all down through the
[48:38] age that's you and i
[48:40] amen and if you pray for peter brother
[48:42] banging it hell it'll it'll
[48:43] it'll hold for us as well because he
[48:45] prayed for us amen
[48:47] hallelujah thank the lord i said i'll
[48:50] tell you what it's held for about these
[48:51] 20 years serving god amen
[48:53] it's been holding strong by god's grace
[48:55] the anchor holds
[48:56] amen though the ship gets battered the
[48:58] anchor holds
[49:00] i just want to lay that out he says i'm
[49:02] not praying for the world he said but go
[49:04] into all the world
[49:05] and he said bride he said the spirit of
[49:07] the bride say whoever wants to come
[49:09] let him come praise god that's why we
[49:11] still pray for sinners right that's why
[49:12] we
[49:13] that's why we still pray for uh anyone
[49:16] to come to be saved because we don't
[49:17] know
[49:19] all right so does that help by god's
[49:20] grace so be encouraged you know if the
[49:22] holy spirit tells you not to pray for
[49:23] somebody don't pray for
[49:25] but if the holy spirit don't tell you to
[49:26] pray for them pray for them pray for
[49:28] mercy right pray for grace
[49:30] okay because the voice of jesus will be
[49:33] in the bride the bride will be saying
[49:35] the same thing
[49:36] according to the scripture thank you now
[49:39] lydia uh revelation uh
[49:43] well you know i'm going to skip that one
[49:44] because that yeah i'm going to skip that
[49:45] okay
[49:47] i would do it on time okay good uh let's
[49:50] show your church how god uh how long is
[49:53] this section here let's see
[49:56] that one's kind of a long one um yeah
[49:59] let me just lay it in here real quick
[50:03] well sorry i'm trying to decide this
[50:07] looks like a long one i guess we'll have
[50:08] to read all this
[50:09] yeah so let me just show you how god uh
[50:12] i'll just refresh your memory
[50:13] how god searched for a bride out of
[50:16] israel
[50:17] but then she turned him down right so
[50:19] god had divorced him so let's look at
[50:20] those scriptures here tonight
[50:22] just so you have an idea now let's start
[50:24] with the good part how god
[50:27] because of his love he called israel he
[50:30] basically
[50:30] espoused himself to israel married
[50:32] israel
[50:33] but because of her unfaithfulness he had
[50:35] to put her away let's start with that
[50:37] to show you it's all based upon love
[50:39] amen
[50:40] god started saving israel because he
[50:42] loved them
[50:44] god saved you because he loved you
[50:45] praise god amen i love reaching out the
[50:48] love of god i just
[50:49] it makes me happy i think that god would
[50:50] love me amen
[50:52] a sinner but god could make me a saint
[50:54] praise god
[50:55] so deuteronomy 4 37 these are scriptures
[50:58] i found recently
[50:59] last year reading the word of god so
[51:01] lydia deuteronomy 4 37
[51:03] malachi deuteronomy 7 verse 8.
[51:08] and then elizabeth you could go to
[51:11] ezekiel 16
[51:12] verse 60.
[51:19] all right so lydia deuteronomy 4 37
[51:22] malachi deuteronomy 7
[51:24] verse 8. see god's plan has always been
[51:28] to make a a human group his wife
[51:32] that's always been his plan right that's
[51:34] what was in the garden
[51:35] he made a man a man and woman in his own
[51:37] image right
[51:38] what'd he do he created a marriage a
[51:40] marriage praise god a man and a woman
[51:42] if i'm gonna if he was gonna represent
[51:44] himself in any way he could have used
[51:45] anything right could he's rocks he could
[51:47] use mountains
[51:48] i'm gonna represent myself as a man and
[51:50] a woman
[51:52] because that was his plan all down
[51:53] through the age
[51:55] all right so malachi do you remember me
[51:56] i'm sorry lydia drew army force 37
[52:07] amen because he hated their fathers no
[52:11] he loved their fathers he loved abraham
[52:13] he loved isaac he loved jacob praise god
[52:16] he loved those faithful men and women of
[52:18] god you believe that amen amen malachi
[52:21] deuteronomy 7 verse 8.
[52:35] amen so the mouth of two or three
[52:36] witnesses let every word be established
[52:39] god called israel because he loved them
[52:42] god calls you the bible says
[52:43] for his great love wherewith he loved
[52:45] you the bible said
[52:46] it's a ephesians 2 4 but god who is rich
[52:50] in mercy
[52:50] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[52:54] god's love is running after you god's
[52:57] love is
[52:58] constantly pursuing you praise god it's
[53:01] all about god's love amen
[53:03] okay now let's go to elizabeth there in
[53:08] ezekiel 1660. whenever you're ready hon
[53:23] [Music]
[53:31] [Music]
[53:38] amen now i had to read the end of it
[53:41] because
[53:42] in the beginning it's very descriptive i
[53:44] don't know if you remember this chapter
[53:46] but god finds israel he says in a in a
[53:49] pool of blood
[53:50] and he said he rescues her uh
[53:54] she's a neglected baby in a field and he
[53:57] saves her nurtures her until she's of
[53:59] marrying age
[54:00] and then he enters into a marriage
[54:02] covenant with her
[54:03] she became his and he clothed her and
[54:06] doctor in beauty
[54:07] and worldwide renown praise god
[54:10] it's because of love right he loved this
[54:12] woman he loved israel
[54:14] sadly her pride just like just like
[54:16] lucifer
[54:17] her pride caused her to find other
[54:20] lovers
[54:21] she became a harlot with every nation
[54:24] and i doubt her
[54:25] and guilty of abortion the bible says
[54:28] that
[54:29] israel forgot god's grace in rescuing
[54:31] her from her
[54:32] humble beginnings i'll say it like that
[54:34] her polluted beginning
[54:36] but god would ultimately forgive her
[54:38] like elizabeth read praise god
[54:40] nevertheless
[54:40] i'll remember my covenant with thee amen
[54:43] see even though she doesn't keep the
[54:44] covenant god said i'm keeping the
[54:46] covenant praise god
[54:47] because no man was was strong enough to
[54:49] keep the covenant
[54:50] only god who makes the covenant praise
[54:52] god amen
[54:54] god was going to forgive them now let's
[54:57] look in the scripture where you can see
[54:59] how they god had to put her away so
[55:02] lydia jeremiah 3 verse 8.
[55:09] uh yeah three verse eight
[55:12] so whenever you're ready
[55:28] okay this is jeremiah let me check the
[55:31] year on that
[55:33] jeremiah 3 8. okay that's 600 years bc
[55:37] wow
[55:39] yeah 629 bc
[55:43] okay
[55:46] so god already tells him he's going to
[55:48] give him a a
[55:50] divorce bill over there sorry i was
[55:52] looking at malcolm like where's your
[55:53] bible and he's holding zion
[55:55] that's okay buddy keep holding that i
[55:57] just was caught off guard there
[55:59] okay so uh jeremiah 3
[56:03] now jeremiah 3 verse 14. let me read
[56:06] that because it says
[56:08] turn o backsiding children saith the

[56:16] but then still begging her turn and come
[56:19] back to me
[56:20] because i'm married to you right
[56:24] and then israel leaving her husband is
[56:26] in verse 20 jeremiah 3 20.
[56:28] surely as a wife treacherously departed
[56:30] from her husband
[56:31] so have he dealt treacherously with me o
[56:34] house of israel
[56:36] saith the lord see god was a faithful
[56:38] husband praise god
[56:40] god was a faithful husband it was the
[56:41] wife right it was unfaithful israel
[56:44] who uh was unfaithful
[56:48] now in verse 22 yet god will offer
[56:50] divine forgiveness
[56:52] return ye backsliding children and i
[56:54] will heal your backslidings
[56:56] behold we come unto thee for thou art
[56:59] the lord

[57:02] thing is true today
[57:03] anybody that backslides they can come
[57:05] back to god if they want to praise god
[57:07] that's why we pray for them praise god
[57:08] especially our family members right
[57:10] those even the mind that have been in
[57:12] church backs in and out
[57:14] uh no longer serve god we know god's
[57:16] still there god wants to heal god wants
[57:19] to bring restoration
[57:20] god wants them to do the first works if
[57:22] they'll just accept it
[57:24] this is how great of love our god has a
[57:27] faithful
[57:28] covenant keeping god amen
[57:31] praise god now i think i'll stop there
[57:34] just uh because there's a whole lot more
[57:36] on that one let's get to esther i got
[57:39] about 21
[57:40] minutes there to hit 45 minutes so
[57:42] everybody feeling good tonight
[57:44] okay praise god i just like to stop and
[57:46] make sure everybody's happy and
[57:47] everybody's doing good by god's grace
[57:48] okay let's just go to esther um if
[57:51] you've got your bibles let's turn to
[57:52] esther
[57:53] now in the book i got eight women who
[57:55] specifically typed the bride of christ
[57:57] the gentile bride uh it could be jude
[58:00] i guess yeah i'm sorry it's jew gentile
[58:02] bride because jews are grafted all
[58:04] nations are grafted into the bride
[58:06] all nations there's a small remnant the
[58:08] bible says of jews in the bride
[58:11] okay so sarah rebecca azinath
[58:14] rahab samson's bride from timnath
[58:18] esther i'm sorry ruth esther and
[58:21] solomon's wife the shulamite so in the
[58:23] book i got those
[58:24] eight women you can all see how they
[58:26] type the gentile
[58:28] the jew gentile bride of christ i gotta
[58:29] have to say that because it's not just
[58:31] gentiles it's youtube
[58:34] okay let's go down here you've got your
[58:37] bibles let's look at uh
[58:38] esther just a beautiful picture here
[58:41] it's been a while since i preached on
[58:42] this
[58:43] um so we'll just go over what i got here
[58:45] in the the scripture
[58:47] now esther is a jewish queen of the
[58:50] persian king xerxes
[58:52] during 6th century bc this is not long
[58:56] after
[58:56] jeremiah okay
[58:59] and she types the new testament bride
[59:02] church
[59:04] so xerxes must type christ then
[59:07] xerxes previous queen vashti
[59:10] whom he put away now this is maybe
[59:12] different for some people i believe she
[59:13] types israel
[59:15] because he was already married to her
[59:18] right
[59:19] if we were saying with the scripture the
[59:21] foolish virgin was never married
[59:23] because she'd never been born again
[59:24] right she never
[59:26] never received the covenant right
[59:30] so that's different than some preachers
[59:32] preach it i can't see it the other way i
[59:33] can only see it this way
[59:34] i believe vashti types israel
[59:38] because he has to put israel away or
[59:40] blind her
[59:42] right you gotta put her away uh like a
[59:45] bill of divorcement just like isaiah 51
[59:47] verse i'm sorry isaiah 50 verse 1 says
[59:50] let me read that
[59:51] isaiah 50 verse 1.
[59:56] isaiah 51
[1:00:00] thus saith the lord where is the bill of
[1:00:02] your mother's divorcement
[1:00:03] whom i have put away or which of my
[1:00:06] creditors is
[1:00:07] is two i'm sorry is it two whom i have
[1:00:10] sold you
[1:00:11] behold for your iniquities have you sold
[1:00:13] yourselves
[1:00:14] and for your transgression is your
[1:00:16] mother put away
[1:00:18] okay so the god explains iniquity is
[1:00:21] what drives someone away from god
[1:00:24] they sell out to iniquity they sell out
[1:00:26] righteousness right they sell that out
[1:00:28] so they can have iniquity i can do
[1:00:30] whatever i want
[1:00:32] and so because of that because they take
[1:00:33] a a lifestyle a habit of iniquity
[1:00:36] god puts them away he's forced to put
[1:00:38] him away in divorcement
[1:00:40] because they're not living true to the
[1:00:41] covenant okay
[1:00:44] so vashti has to represent israel as far
[1:00:47] as i understand
[1:00:48] praise god now next in the story
[1:00:53] christ has to go looking for a virgin
[1:00:56] bride
[1:00:56] amen esther 2 verse 2 says the king
[1:01:00] servants that ministered unto him said
[1:01:02] let there be a fair young virgins sought
[1:01:05] for the king praise god
[1:01:06] amen hallelujah so it was a requirement
[1:01:10] that the wife be pure praise god
[1:01:14] speaking of the gentile or the jew
[1:01:16] gentile bride of christ
[1:01:19] this type is awesome praise the lord
[1:01:21] mordecai
[1:01:22] esther's cousin urges her to enter the
[1:01:25] contest
[1:01:26] to become xerxes new wife mordecai the
[1:01:29] elder staunch jew
[1:01:31] seems to type the law of moses as a
[1:01:33] school master
[1:01:34] pointing us to jesus christ so he seemed
[1:01:36] because he said
[1:01:37] go go enter go enter the wedding contest
[1:01:39] right see if you can win the beauty
[1:01:41] contest how many people would like that
[1:01:42] today
[1:01:43] i would like that that wouldn't be very
[1:01:44] good would it but he's like go
[1:01:46] point he's pointing point to xerxes amen
[1:01:49] point to christ hallelujah
[1:01:51] that related that related uncle or
[1:01:53] loretta related cousin rather
[1:01:55] pointing this pure girl pointing her to
[1:01:58] the husband christ
[1:02:00] see if you can be the true bride amen
[1:02:03] see if you could be the one
[1:02:04] the king delights in amen hallelujah the
[1:02:08] bride that jesus delights in that's you
[1:02:09] and i amen
[1:02:12] out of all the other like brother
[1:02:13] brother said brides and brides and
[1:02:15] churches and churches
[1:02:16] there will be one bride who's the chosen
[1:02:17] bride amen
[1:02:22] so uh this spiritual type
[1:02:25] is second corinthians 11 2 for i'm
[1:02:27] jealous over you with godly jealousy for
[1:02:29] i've espoused you to one husband
[1:02:31] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:02:33] virgin to christ
[1:02:35] so this is the type esther wins the
[1:02:37] beauty contest
[1:02:38] by adorning herself according to hegei's
[1:02:40] requirements
[1:02:42] and nothing more let's read that praise
[1:02:44] god
[1:02:45] that's esther 2 15. lydia can you get
[1:02:47] that one for me
[1:02:49] esther 215
[1:03:09] amen praise god now haggai represents
[1:03:13] the holy spirit's work of
[1:03:15] sanctification it's the second work of
[1:03:16] grace the first work
[1:03:18] is she's she's called she's justified to
[1:03:21] join that group right
[1:03:22] she's and that's what justification does
[1:03:24] it separates us from our past life right
[1:03:26] just like we're saying about tonight the
[1:03:27] red sea
[1:03:28] are you guys thinking about that that
[1:03:30] red sea types justification oops sorry
[1:03:32] get too close to that see that brings
[1:03:35] you out of your past life into a new
[1:03:37] life
[1:03:38] so did esther being chosen that was
[1:03:40] justification
[1:03:41] the second stage is sanctification amen
[1:03:45] keep do everything haggai says that's
[1:03:47] the second work of grace
[1:03:49] do everything in and then perhaps you'll
[1:03:51] get the seed life from the king right
[1:03:53] all right i know we're kind of being
[1:03:54] straight here but that's that's that's
[1:03:56] the story god gives us right i mean it's
[1:03:57] kind of
[1:03:58] kind of out there but this is the story
[1:04:01] if you if you're going to become the
[1:04:02] wife of the king and receive a seed life
[1:04:05] you got to go through this work of grace
[1:04:07] amen and he doesn't add
[1:04:08] any she doesn't do anything outside just
[1:04:10] what the bible says praise god
[1:04:13] and read that if you read that there's
[1:04:14] no makeup in there yeah
[1:04:16] they try to tell me that all the time
[1:04:18] there's oils and spices but there's no
[1:04:20] makeup in there the bible calls it paint
[1:04:22] ah these people add that's why they get
[1:04:25] their they get in trouble with those
[1:04:26] bible versions right
[1:04:27] the bible versions might not make up the
[1:04:29] false ones but not the true word of god
[1:04:32] just what haggai commands
[1:04:35] see she lives by every word that
[1:04:38] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:04:40] now um elizabeth can you get
[1:04:44] romans 2 29
[1:04:47] now i'm going to say a few things before
[1:04:49] you get there so take your time romans 2
[1:04:51] 29 let me get back to this as she's
[1:04:54] going to romans 2 29
[1:04:56] esther's wedding night types the
[1:04:58] christians born again experience
[1:05:01] because new birth is likened under
[1:05:03] receiving seed
[1:05:05] in first peter 1 23 and i know that's
[1:05:07] graphic but
[1:05:08] this is the wedding night is typical
[1:05:10] being born again it's a type of the
[1:05:11] born-again experience
[1:05:13] according to first peter 1 23 i'll read
[1:05:15] that
[1:05:17] because it's a reception of life
[1:05:20] first peter 1 23. oh there we go hebrews
[1:05:24] james first and second peter okay sorry
[1:05:28] first peter 1 23
[1:05:31] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:05:34] but in
[1:05:35] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:05:38] which liveth and abideth forever praise
[1:05:40] god
[1:05:41] so when a person's born again the the
[1:05:43] seed they receive is a
[1:05:45] a seed of life and he says we don't have
[1:05:48] incorruptible seed like a natural man
[1:05:50] right but we've got incorruptible seed
[1:05:52] the life of god amen
[1:05:54] amen so when esther goes in there on
[1:05:55] that wedding night and receives the life
[1:05:57] of the king
[1:05:58] it types the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:00] praise god
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] all right now here's though here's the
[1:06:08] the most glorious parts of this
[1:06:09] revelation outwardly
[1:06:11] everybody thinks esther is a gentile but
[1:06:14] inwardly
[1:06:15] she's a jew elizabeth go ahead romans
[1:06:18] 229 this is the beauty beautiful part of
[1:06:21] the type
[1:06:27] inwardly yep
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:42] hey man that beautiful paul's got to
[1:06:45] tell him who's the real jews here
[1:06:46] the one the real jew are the one who
[1:06:48] serves god with a pure heart
[1:06:51] their hearts have been circumcised in
[1:06:52] other words the
[1:06:54] extra fleshly desires have been
[1:06:56] separated from them
[1:06:57] can i say like this permanently praise
[1:06:59] god amen
[1:07:01] i'm permanently separated from most of
[1:07:03] my sins can i say it like that
[1:07:04] everybody understand i'm permanently
[1:07:06] separate i'm never going to go back to
[1:07:08] them again
[1:07:09] i can't you can't it's dead
[1:07:12] praise god it's dead amen you can't live
[1:07:16] you can't connect something dead to
[1:07:17] something alive praise god
[1:07:19] i wish i had the intelligence to say it
[1:07:21] i've got education but no intelligence
[1:07:23] that's the bad part
[1:07:25] oh see although she was jewish her real
[1:07:28] identity was unknown to the king
[1:07:30] and everyone and all shushen right
[1:07:34] in other words everybody considered her
[1:07:36] a virgin gentile
[1:07:39] she never even lived the day church this
[1:07:41] is that she never even lived one day in
[1:07:43] jerusalem
[1:07:45] so really i mean her whole life speaks
[1:07:46] of gentile gentile gender
[1:07:50] and it types she's an inwardly
[1:07:53] spiritual jew right what does that
[1:07:55] represent represents you're a child of
[1:07:57] abraham
[1:07:58] amen the bible said by faith you're a
[1:08:01] child of abraham he's the one that
[1:08:02] started the jewish
[1:08:03] or the hebrew race that's the one god
[1:08:05] chose to start it praise god
[1:08:07] that people because eventually come out
[1:08:09] of him abraham isaac jacob out of jacob
[1:08:11] come the 12 sons one of them was judah
[1:08:13] jew praise god amen
[1:08:17] glory now here's where we are i'm going
[1:08:19] to try to finish with this i got 10
[1:08:20] minutes if
[1:08:21] i go 45. thank you for your patience
[1:08:23] everybody thank you
[1:08:26] haman's plot to kill the jews including
[1:08:30] mordecai and esther types the very end
[1:08:33] of the times the gentiles
[1:08:35] because remember revelation 12 who's
[1:08:37] that dragon kind trying to kill
[1:08:39] the jews remember that let's let's go
[1:08:41] there we got time romans 12.

[1:08:46] oh goodness revelation 12.
[1:08:48] goodness gracious talking too fast now
[1:08:53] revelation 12.
[1:09:02] see because satan still knows that that
[1:09:04] brought i'm sorry that jewish people is
[1:09:06] covenanted to god
[1:09:08] and satan's always against that covenant
[1:09:10] he's against anything god
[1:09:13] okay revelation 12 13 and when the
[1:09:15] dragon saw that he was cast under the
[1:09:16] earth
[1:09:17] he persecuted the woman which brought
[1:09:19] forth the man child that jewish people
[1:09:21] man child was christ see
[1:09:25] and to the woman were given two wings of
[1:09:27] a great eagle
[1:09:28] amen god likens israel to the eagle
[1:09:31] the woman's given two eagles i'm sorry
[1:09:33] two wings like an eagle
[1:09:35] that she might fly into the wilderness
[1:09:37] into her place where she's nourished for
[1:09:38] a time
[1:09:39] that's a year times two years and a half
[1:09:42] time
[1:09:43] half year that's three and a half years
[1:09:47] so after amen rapture she's got eagle
[1:09:49] wings oh glory two wings prophet amen
[1:09:52] moses and elijah amen and through their
[1:09:55] power
[1:09:56] they're kept secret praise god for a
[1:09:58] time a year
[1:09:59] times and a half a time three and a half
[1:10:02] years praise god
[1:10:03] amen that's beautiful glory
[1:10:08] how she nourished out there in the
[1:10:10] wilderness verse 15
[1:10:11] and the serpent cast out of his mouth
[1:10:13] waters of flood after the woman that he
[1:10:15] might cause her to be carried away the
[1:10:16] flood that's the and
[1:10:17] the tribulation period and the earth
[1:10:19] helped the woman and the earth
[1:10:21] opened her mouth and swallowed up the
[1:10:22] flood which a dragon cast
[1:10:24] out of his mouth and the dragon was
[1:10:27] wrath with the woman jew
[1:10:28] and went to make war with the remnant of
[1:10:30] her seed that's 144 thousand
[1:10:32] which keep the commandments of god and
[1:10:34] have the testimony of jesus christ oh no
[1:10:37] longer blinded praise god
[1:10:39] no longer wondering who's the messiah
[1:10:41] jesus is the messiah oh
[1:10:43] what a happy people they're gonna be
[1:10:45] when those blinders come off
[1:10:47] this whole time they missed it but now
[1:10:49] they can see jesus
[1:10:50] was that suffering servant of isaiah 53
[1:10:53] praise god
[1:10:54] amen oh that's beautiful
[1:10:58] so see who's that dragon after the
[1:11:00] dragon is after
[1:11:02] the sun right jesus the man child but
[1:11:04] anyone connected the people the man
[1:11:06] child as well
[1:11:08] so see so haman's plot to kill the jews
[1:11:12] even mordecai is typed to the times the
[1:11:15] gentiles
[1:11:16] so really satan hates all jews and all
[1:11:18] gentiles all
[1:11:20] christians right christian jews and even
[1:11:22] blind jews
[1:11:23] and gentiles he hates all them that are
[1:11:25] connected to god
[1:11:28] now so haman's plot to kill
[1:11:31] all them is like when the beast out of
[1:11:34] the earth raises up in revelation 13
[1:11:36] 11 through 18 because
[1:11:40] the beast has the plot to kill all
[1:11:43] both small and great rich and poor bond
[1:11:45] and free
[1:11:46] six descriptions there who will not take
[1:11:49] his antichrist mark
[1:11:52] right gonna kill everybody that won't
[1:11:55] take
[1:11:56] their mark remember what was the image
[1:11:58] of the beast the world council of
[1:11:59] churches
[1:12:00] and church their their website literally
[1:12:02] says we are to be the image of the
[1:12:04] church
[1:12:04] it literally says that i've seen it i've
[1:12:07] got i got a picture on it on my
[1:12:08] slideshow
[1:12:09] their whole goal is to be the image of
[1:12:11] the church
[1:12:12] and then and the bible says the image of
[1:12:14] the beast is going to want to be the
[1:12:15] ones that
[1:12:16] uh that uh share forth the mark of the
[1:12:19] beast so the churches are going to be
[1:12:20] for that oh shut down any church
[1:12:22] that won't join us oh it's plainly told
[1:12:25] in the scripture
[1:12:27] now he says now the bible says
[1:12:30] his theme the beast theme is going to be
[1:12:32] peace and safety right we read that this
[1:12:34] morning
[1:12:34] peace and safety peace and safety yeah
[1:12:37] while they're saying that they're going
[1:12:38] to outlaw

[1:13:12] same thing's going to be about churches
[1:13:13] right you got to sign the paperwork you
[1:13:15] got to join the union in order to have a
[1:13:17] church
[1:13:20] okay so the same thing is with haman's
[1:13:22] plot now just as haman's plot was foiled
[1:13:25] by esther's prayer
[1:13:28] glory i'm looking forward to more prayer
[1:13:31] in the years to come
[1:13:32] if the type is right we've got to be a
[1:13:35] church that's into prayer amen
[1:13:37] not just prayer but a special kind
[1:13:39] intercessory prayer
[1:13:41] we've got to be praying for all of god's
[1:13:43] people to be delivered praise god
[1:13:47] she is able to uh foil his plot of
[1:13:50] killing all the believers all the holy
[1:13:53] people
[1:13:54] amen aren't you glad you're holy praise
[1:13:56] god he's trying to
[1:13:58] kill all the holy people remember all
[1:14:00] the people that won't bow down to haman
[1:14:02] remember he wouldn't
[1:14:02] mordecai would have bound out bow down
[1:14:05] to haman
[1:14:06] satan hates that when you won't bow down
[1:14:07] oh but let's not bow to anything but
[1:14:09] christ
[1:14:10] amen amen satan hates that so he wants
[1:14:13] to destroy
[1:14:14] them and it's only going to be foiled
[1:14:17] through the bride's prayer and
[1:14:19] intercession
[1:14:20] to the king oh glory
[1:14:24] remember they fasted three days before
[1:14:26] the queen put on her royal
[1:14:28] apparel and stood before the king
[1:14:31] remember it could have cost her life it
[1:14:32] was a life or death situation
[1:14:35] right but she was willing to die
[1:14:40] to save her people because she knew she
[1:14:43] was ordained to be queen
[1:14:44] for such a time as this amen right
[1:14:47] church
[1:14:48] god has called us why were we born in
[1:14:50] this time why why couldn't we be born a
[1:14:52] time when jesus was on the earth
[1:14:53] well because god had us ordained for
[1:14:55] such a time as this
[1:14:57] we're to manifest a real grind to christ
[1:15:01] that's why i was saying if you remember
[1:15:02] was was it last weekend mother uh
[1:15:05] the bang i was saying i might not be a
[1:15:07] prayer warrior yet but i'm gonna be a
[1:15:08] prayer warrior
[1:15:10] esther we don't see her as a prayer
[1:15:12] warrior until the end
[1:15:15] i'm not discouraging anybody from
[1:15:16] praying we need to pray every day i pray
[1:15:17] in the closet this morning and you
[1:15:19] we all we need to pray to god but her
[1:15:22] prayers really become powerful at the
[1:15:24] end of time when the pressure's on
[1:15:27] amen she becomes a prayer warrior
[1:15:30] can you imagine that three days of
[1:15:31] fasting i've never fasted that long
[1:15:34] three days of fasting before she goes
[1:15:37] into the queen i'm sorry the king rather
[1:15:40] willing to die but she knew this is why
[1:15:43] i won the beauty contest this is the
[1:15:45] this is why jesus showed me the message
[1:15:48] amen praise god because i'm supposed to
[1:15:50] pray for the church
[1:15:52] i'm supposed to pray for the family god
[1:15:54] knew i could be a prayer warrior praise
[1:15:56] god
[1:15:57] for such a time like this
[1:16:01] how many women if you had now think
[1:16:03] about a queen now
[1:16:05] think about if everybody was serving our
[1:16:07] think about if everybody was serving you
[1:16:09] and they brought your food to you when
[1:16:11] you went like this your food was brought
[1:16:13] to you
[1:16:14] that's what esther could have done right
[1:16:15] she's queen but she turned that down for
[1:16:17] three days of not eating
[1:16:19] think about that but she had the
[1:16:21] character see
[1:16:22] she was burdened so that her her people
[1:16:25] weren't destroyed
[1:16:26] she wanted to see them saved amen
[1:16:30] so see she had a fast she was so
[1:16:31] burdened for her people she would turn
[1:16:33] down
[1:16:34] luxuries and necessities in order to see
[1:16:37] life
[1:16:37] saved amen that's got to be our desire
[1:16:41] to church
[1:16:42] right we got to sign cry for the
[1:16:44] abominations
[1:16:45] we've got we've got to pray against that
[1:16:47] we have to pray god deliver your people
[1:16:49] save the bride uh save us from evil to
[1:16:52] come don't worry god will bring us down
[1:16:53] there
[1:16:54] don't worry just like god brought the
[1:16:56] pressure around esther he's going to
[1:16:57] bring the pressure on us too
[1:17:00] we can't escape it but then god is slow
[1:17:02] that's what i just said then god is slow
[1:17:04] like birth pains
[1:17:06] praise the lord now i gotta laugh but
[1:17:08] it's uh it's gonna be a serious thing
[1:17:11] see the pressure's gonna come on slowly
[1:17:12] like the birth pains a little bit hard a
[1:17:14] little bit harder
[1:17:14] a little bit harder but god is going to
[1:17:17] bring us to that place i believe that's
[1:17:19] the word of god
[1:17:22] all right now
[1:17:25] she gets clothed in the holy spirit's
[1:17:27] anointing
[1:17:29] and she becomes a king and priest
[1:17:32] unto god right because the king is the
[1:17:36] scepter she gets the
[1:17:37] the the king points a separator she gets
[1:17:40] the approval of the
[1:17:40] the king but she's a priest because she
[1:17:43] was praying
[1:17:44] and interceding for god's people see
[1:17:46] that
[1:17:47] she has the royal authority she gets the
[1:17:48] authority of her husband
[1:17:50] and she's interceding
[1:17:54] and i like this uh she had access to the
[1:17:58] highest authority and she took advantage
[1:18:00] of it
[1:18:01] at church that's what we got we got
[1:18:02] access to the highest king of kings
[1:18:04] to the great the only great president of
[1:18:06] this of this world amen
[1:18:08] we have access she went to the act the
[1:18:11] highest access
[1:18:12] of the land the highest authority and so
[1:18:14] do we the bible said
[1:18:16] we have access by faith into this grace
[1:18:19] wherein we stand praise god see she had
[1:18:23] access
[1:18:24] to the grace in which she was standing
[1:18:25] in
[1:18:27] she was what she was chosen by grace to
[1:18:29] be the queen
[1:18:31] and but that that that queenship gave
[1:18:33] her access
[1:18:34] to authority and that's what it does for
[1:18:36] us praise god
[1:18:37] it gives us authority before the throne
[1:18:39] of god
[1:18:41] how did there's about 45 minutes okay
[1:18:44] i'm almost done here
[1:18:48] okay so bear with me or let me set up a
[1:18:50] five minute timer here hopefully i can
[1:18:51] get that in five minutes
[1:18:52] thank you for your patience church thank
[1:18:53] you uh almost done here
[1:18:55] now just as esther had political
[1:18:58] pressure
[1:18:59] there's coming a time for us of
[1:19:01] political pressure a squeeze time
[1:19:03] upon the bride church at some point the
[1:19:06] false churches are going to unite with
[1:19:07] the political leaders it's more obvious
[1:19:09] than ever right now
[1:19:11] right they're just going to give in
[1:19:12] whatever they want oh it wasn't that
[1:19:14] georgia guy wasn't he a former preacher
[1:19:15] that georgia senator who
[1:19:17] won i think he was a preacher he's got a
[1:19:19] history of
[1:19:20] sexual abuse and all kinds of abuse
[1:19:23] i'll probably get censored for that
[1:19:25] anyway
[1:19:29] so the false churches are going tonight
[1:19:30] with the political system and change the
[1:19:32] laws
[1:19:34] we're going gonna feel the pressure of
[1:19:36] the movement but we're trusting that
[1:19:38] jesus
[1:19:39] will spare us from the hour the mark is
[1:19:41] laid down
[1:19:42] according to revelation 3 10 because
[1:19:44] thou has kept the word of my patience i
[1:19:46] also keep thee from the our temptation
[1:19:48] which shall come upon all the world to
[1:19:50] try them that dwell
[1:19:52] upon the earth oh that's a promise i'm
[1:19:53] holding on to praise god
[1:19:55] lord i'm keeping you i'm keeping your
[1:19:57] word lord keep me
[1:19:58] from that moment when the mark of the
[1:20:00] beast is laid down that's what he said
[1:20:02] praise god
[1:20:03] that's what he told the philadelphia
[1:20:04] church age right
[1:20:06] if you keep my word i'll keep you from
[1:20:09] the temptation that comes upon the whole
[1:20:11] world
[1:20:11] amen
[1:20:14] praise god so what does esther do
[1:20:17] in that time of the squeeze she prays
[1:20:20] and fast
[1:20:21] then she wants to hold a want two wine
[1:20:23] banquets for the king
[1:20:25] wine represents joy and the boldness of
[1:20:29] god's spirit
[1:20:31] right as taught in acts chapter 2 acts
[1:20:35] chapter 4
[1:20:36] and psalm 16 verse 11 and your presence
[1:20:40] is fullness of joy
[1:20:41] so instead of choosing fear in her time
[1:20:44] of trouble she chooses to honor her king
[1:20:46] with praise
[1:20:48] joy rejoicing magnifying his name
[1:20:52] yeah so see as that time nears we got to
[1:20:55] have
[1:20:55] services where we're purposely remember
[1:20:57] we did a couple weeks ago when canvas
[1:20:59] here we prayed for the latter rain
[1:21:00] remember that
[1:21:01] wasn't that a wonderful time see so we
[1:21:03] got to keep doing
[1:21:04] you know as it comes down that's the
[1:21:06] reality it's going to come to that we
[1:21:08] have to pray
[1:21:08] lord come to our banquet amen
[1:21:12] come to this first banquet send us that
[1:21:14] ladder or that former rain
[1:21:16] and then he says what do you want come
[1:21:17] to the latter rain praise god send us
[1:21:20] send us the latter and send us another
[1:21:22] wine banquet amen
[1:21:24] hallelujah this is so beautiful praise
[1:21:26] god
[1:21:27] because brother adam says thus saith the
[1:21:28] lord out of joel chapter 2.
[1:21:33] so we'll battle fear right we'll battle
[1:21:35] fear
[1:21:36] but we've got to hold wine banquets
[1:21:39] we've got to host the king in his glory
[1:21:42] and his beauty
[1:21:43] and worship him amen praise god we've
[1:21:46] got to do that we have to keep gathering
[1:21:48] to magnify his name so these two
[1:21:50] banquets speak of the former and latter
[1:21:52] reign from
[1:21:53] joel 2 23. also church let's read this
[1:21:56] lydia isaiah 25
[1:22:00] verses 6 through 8 and malcolm got your
[1:22:02] bible now okay
[1:22:03] malachi first corinthians
[1:22:06] 15 51-54 now
[1:22:10] listen these two verses go together
[1:22:12] isaiah 25
[1:22:14] speaks about swallowing death up in
[1:22:16] victory what does that remind you of
[1:22:18] the rapture paul says death is swallowed
[1:22:21] up in victory
[1:22:22] but look where this scripture comes from
[1:22:24] it comes from isaiah 25
[1:22:25] and it talks about having a wine banquet
[1:22:29] at the time of the swallowing up of
[1:22:31] death
[1:22:34] praise god see we're going to be so
[1:22:35] drunk on the holy spirit that life
[1:22:37] is gonna swallow up death amen we won't
[1:22:40] even fear death
[1:22:41] because life is present praise god we'll
[1:22:43] be drunk on the holy spirit praise god
[1:22:45] right
[1:22:46] we won't even consider these other
[1:22:48] things we'll be totally under the
[1:22:49] influence of the holy spirit praise god
[1:22:51] oh my i'm
[1:22:52] under tonight praise god lord i feel
[1:22:55] like dancing or something
[1:22:57] praise the lord amen bye see because
[1:22:59] it's god's spirit we'll take the fear
[1:23:01] out of it praise god
[1:23:02] amen isaiah 25
[1:23:06] 6 through 8 please lydia
[1:23:32] shalom
[1:23:36] interesting it kind of sounds like
[1:23:37] israel right and it may be it may be a
[1:23:39] compound prophecy
[1:23:40] but look he will swallow up death
[1:23:43] in victory that's the rapture scripture
[1:23:47] so lydia or malcolm read that first
[1:23:49] corinthians 15 51-54
[1:24:22] amen praise god so when this
[1:24:25] this old pest house gets swallowed up in
[1:24:28] a brand new body
[1:24:30] then that saying is fulfilled death is
[1:24:32] swallowed up
[1:24:33] in victory praise god if i feel this
[1:24:35] good in death right now
[1:24:37] what am i going to feel like when i get
[1:24:38] a brand new body praise god
[1:24:40] amen look at that now go back to isaiah
[1:24:43] 25
[1:24:43] in this mountain i wonder if that's the
[1:24:45] mount zion showdown
[1:24:47] in this mountain the lord will make a
[1:24:49] feast of wines on the leaves
[1:24:52] well refined that means it's going to be
[1:24:54] really good wine raise god
[1:24:57] hallelujah he's in this mountain he'll
[1:25:00] destroy the face of the covering cast
[1:25:03] over all the people
[1:25:04] praise god so there'll be no nothing
[1:25:05] will be hidden anymore praise god
[1:25:07] he'll swallow up death and victory and
[1:25:09] the lord will wipe away all tears from
[1:25:10] off their faces
[1:25:12] oh my what a day of victory praise god
[1:25:15] so former rain
[1:25:16] ladder rain that's what i can see now
[1:25:19] esther
[1:25:20] sitting at a table with her husband her
[1:25:22] greatest enemy haman
[1:25:23] it's like psalm 23 5. so elizabeth want
[1:25:27] to get that one psalm 23
[1:25:28] 5. thank you i should have told you
[1:25:30] earlier sorry
[1:25:32] but uh this is what it reminded me of as
[1:25:34] i was reading through the scripture this
[1:25:35] summer
[1:25:36] i thought wow there's esther at a table
[1:25:38] heyman her greatest enemy
[1:25:40] there's her her lord her husband you
[1:25:43] have all three at the table
[1:25:46] you got nothing to fear praise god
[1:25:49] because you're
[1:25:50] uh your head's there your husband's
[1:25:51] there so yeah i uh psalm 23 5.
[1:26:04] you know this scripture always i was
[1:26:07] confused what does that
[1:26:08] mean in the presence of my enemies how
[1:26:10] could i have a dinner in the presence of
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:20] enemies
[1:26:25] amen see though there's pressure look
[1:26:28] the pressure is sitting with her at the
[1:26:30] table
[1:26:30] the man who's gonna kill her but while
[1:26:33] she's there she has nothing to fear
[1:26:35] because her husband's there thou art
[1:26:37] with me praise god amen
[1:26:39] and thou anoint this you've anointed me
[1:26:42] and not just a little anointing
[1:26:44] my cup runs over praise god right
[1:26:47] here i am i got my worst enemy but i got
[1:26:49] my husband right here praise god
[1:26:52] see though the pressure's mounting even
[1:26:54] shutting her doors
[1:26:55] this anointing will ensure her
[1:26:57] deliverance
[1:26:59] praise god david knew his victory didn't
[1:27:02] come by his power
[1:27:03] but it came by god's anointing amen
[1:27:07] same thing for you and i we don't
[1:27:08] overcome by our ability it's god's
[1:27:10] anointing that helps us overcome
[1:27:12] amen praise god amen
[1:27:16] it was on the day of the second wine
[1:27:17] banquet esther finally revealed her
[1:27:19] petition
[1:27:20] to her husband right and he saved her
[1:27:23] from her accuser
[1:27:25] haman she never had to suffer through
[1:27:27] the hour of death
[1:27:29] haman had planned because xerxes did
[1:27:31] away with him
[1:27:32] right so will the bride church be saved
[1:27:35] from living through the great
[1:27:36] tribulation when the mark of the beast
[1:27:38] is laid down
[1:27:39] christ will remove his church from off
[1:27:41] the earth before the tribulation
[1:27:45] praise god now there's types afterwards
[1:27:48] of the hundred forty four thousand uh
[1:27:51] but i'll stop right there by god's grace

[1:28:05] putting all these types together you get
[1:28:07] a pretty good picture of what's going to
[1:28:08] happen
[1:28:09] and that's why i want to put all
[1:28:10] together it'll give us a great
[1:28:12] understanding and now
[1:28:14] even today helps us understand with you
[1:28:16] know banning uh
[1:28:17] uh freedom of speech and everything it
[1:28:19] gives us a good understanding
[1:28:20] of how this is all gonna play out by the
[1:28:22] grace of god amen
