TRANSCRIPT
========================================
gracious taste let's open up our bibles here this morning let me take a little break on the normal services like so for example i may preach the joshua message tonight we'll kind of see how that goes i like to preach on that thought about lukewarmness again i just preached a short little a few thoughts on it a couple wednesdays ago but i want to preach a full sermon on it today to kind of anchor the church in the truth of god's word praise god let's go to revelation 3 14. revelation 3 14. so it's revelation 3 16 rather pardon me revelation 3 16. i'd like to read in just three small portions of scripture here revelation 3 i'll just read this myself verse 16 says so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth so there's hot lukewarm and cold they go to luke 3 16. so these are both 3 16 right revelation 3 16 luke 3 16. here's john the baptist speaking here remember he got the holy ghost on his human spirit while in the womb praise god hallelujah so if anybody knew about the fire of god under the old testament it was john the baptist praise god john 3 16. i'm sorry no it's luke's at 3 16 sorry luke 3 16 john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchette of whose shoes i am not worthy to loose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire fire so jesus christ baptizes you he immerses your soul with the holy ghost and at the end of the church jesus says you got to be hot on fire so what how is he going to do how are you going to do that by the baptism of the holy ghost okay acts 2 verse 3 acts 2 verse 3 last scripture will read this one together acts two verse three let's read verse three and four together here acts 2 verse 3 and 4. let's begin on three one two three and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so here's what john was talking about he said he's going to baptize you with the holy ghost and fire and it happened praise god and every believer ever since who's got baptized with the holy ghost whether you saw the fire or not the fire went deep down past your forehead past your mind and down into your soul praise god let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known to god today heavenly father we just love you we give you thanks and praise it's a joy to sing to you lord oh we magnify you today oh we've tasted and seen that the lord is good the lord we want a fresh taste lord we want to a freshly lord partake of your spiritual food today give us a fresh outpouring lord god just a special anointing today by the power of the holy ghost thank you for these songs thank you for the saints that can be in your house for guiding us here you protected us lord god and we give you thanks and praise now lord we read your word take these words lord break them to us that you might be glorified that we might leave here stronger than when we came in lord god for the glory of god make us mold for the kingdom of god we pray in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you being seated praise god i do have some slides here some quotes to show in some scriptures so that will be helpful for you i believe like i said i just want to take a normal break i uh from the regular joshua series although i do have a sermon ready i did study on that yesterday i have a sermon ready on that chapter 13 in joshua but i kind of felt like this was such an important issue i guess i was i was kind of inspired by brother william when he was uh we were talking on wednesday and and uh he was saying over the years he's been the message for what 40 years maybe longer he said over the years you know he's seen uh people go up for prayer and uh and and sometimes the preachers will say they're lukewarm or something like that right i think we were talking about that and how our church that can be that can be such a hard thing to hear right because if you if you look at the context of lukewarm the word lukewarm is only used one time in the bible and that's right there in revelation 3 and the lukewarm person is actually spit out of the mouth of christ so when he said that it just struck me like wow i wonder how many people were maybe they were they were truly born again but they were going through a difficult season right where they were struggling in their mind but yet a preacher or maybe a friend could say oh you're just lukewarm and how that could be such a a a tactic of satan to discourage the saints right and get them to doubt because i don't know about you but almost every morning i wake up feeling lukewarm i don't know about you maybe when i was younger now i had a lot more fire and zeal now getting getting older i wake up tired now all the time and i wake up i don't want to read my bible you know i don't want to pray i'm just tired and worn out you know and so you know we all feel lukewarm in our flesh in fact the bible says our flesh is enmity against the spirit he said paul said it's enmity uh the flesh fights against the holy spirit and so we've got to we got to war against the flesh we have to put on a war and say okay it's time to go to battle right a few minutes after you wake up right here it's time to go to battle it's time to cast down this dead man right it's time to cast down this body of death the bible calls it and so if i had a title i'd say lukewarm never describes a holy ghost-filled christian soul and i want to put the word soul in there but lukewarm never describes your soul i could just shorten it like that a born-again christian is never lukewarm in their soul and and god never used that word for your mind so for me i just take it out out of my vocabulary for me totally and i've studied most of brother ham's quotes not all of them but i got through most of the lukewarm quotes and he never applies it to himself either lukewarm church member who's not born again he never applies it to himself okay so i want you to put that word lukewarm i want you to put a little uh marker on there and say not me not applied to me that's like saying well i'm blind i'm spiritually blind no you're not you can see the word of god amen right and even the sleeping virgin i'm not sleeping like i never apply that to me i'm never the sleeping virgin i'm never the blind person i'm never the lukewarm person i'm never them i'm battling in my mind because my mind gets weird my mind gets tired but i never place myself in that foolish virgin or judas iscariot group i'm always in that wise virgin group that's hot for jesus amen of course i don't always act like it paul didn't always act like it peter for sure didn't always act like it right because we have an example of him discriminating against gentiles wouldn't even eat with them right so we have examples of peter that's why i can say peter specifically because we have specific examples where he fell short of the glory of god yet he had the baptism of the holy ghost and fire amen yet church yes somebody can look at peter and say i saw the fire of god on your forehead and yet the fire wasn't in his mind at that moment fear was in his mind at that moment see that church so i want to just want you to notice if the fire of god is entered into you you'll never be lukewarm in the sight of god because that's a condition where someone is lukewarm where god can never speak through them oh let our desire be god always speak through me amen even in my weak conditions speak through me when i'm when i'm really on fire speak through me when i'm encouraged when i'm when i'm bold speak through me let me be your voice to this generation now let's preach through it i've already preached the majority thoughts of the sermon so let me go ahead and preach through it here now look at those are just beautiful texts jesus says or paul or john the baptist said jesus is going to give you fire right and then the fire came on the day of pentecost and it's been this fire has been burning in every believer's heart ever since let me set a timer here i'm going to try to spare uh myself and you here we'll see how the holy spirit leads so from these two texts jesus sent the baptism of the holy ghost so his fire would abide in our souls forever making us his mouthpiece he would not speak through the lukewarm group so if you look at the context of revelation 3 it's the laodicean age it's the age of the rights of the people that's what laodicea means justice of the people right so the rights of the people everybody wants rights okay so uh in this age in this seventh church age there's going to be three groups hot lukewarm cold but jesus says specifically i'm not speaking out of the lukewarm the church just look just think about the people you witness to if god's ever had you witnessed to somebody and spoke through you or prayed for somebody and healed through you you were god's mouthpiece praise god you were you were god's mouthpiece amen right so we have to look at this and realize the bride of christ will always be the mouthpiece of christ she will not be spewed out we'll get to that a little bit because the old testament gives us more clues about why they're spewed out okay of course we have a lot of them too but we have to place this let's place this lukewarm group among the bible groups because brother and taught us that there's groups in the bible and so did jesus of course uh so here's the verse because you're lukewarm i'll spew you spew the out so three conditions hot lukewarm cold the lukewarm never speak for jesus and of course the cold wouldn't so there's only one group on this earth that speaks for jesus aren't you glad to be a part of that group amen you have the fire of god burning in you you may not be perfect all the time but there's times where you know the fire of god is burned up in you and you've said exactly what god wanted you to say hallelujah you spoke for god hallelujah you were god's mouthpiece to this generation whether they accept it or not amen whether they want to or not if you tell them the truth you are god's mouthpiece and they'll answer church they'll answer for that on the day of judgment now look go to isaiah 28 because i i didn't put the whole verses just the same time in isaiah 28 we see the same condition of a spewed out church now think about that how think about the condition of most churches today they're in a condition of sickness they're spiritually sick and god's not there right because jesus is not going to hang around a house that's filthy right that's got vomit in it he's not going to hang around a church that's got spiritual vomit in it right he says out of my mouth you are out of the body you're not in the body of christ you're not my mouthpiece he and then he said he's knocking on the doors trying to get back in there clean it up let me in but you got to clean it up right right you got to get saved sanctified holy ghost then i'll come in with the holy ghost if you get cleaned up look at the condition of the church and see church we ought to be thankful uh all those small numbers we ought to be thankful we got a and span church we're cleaned out there's no vomit here there's fresh bread here there's wine here and oil amen hallelujah praise god because christ himself walks up and down these pews his angels protect you and guide you and bring you here christ is with us amen hallelujah i've been to other churches i know he's not in the other churches hallelujah i know christ is here amen because he backs up his word praise god he gives us what we have need of like when we're sick he heals us hallelujah when we need revelation he strengthens us when we need direction he shows us the way praise god when we need teaching he teaches us when we need rebuked he rebukes us when we need love he loves us hallelujah he pours out his love amen and his kindness and his mercy his goodness is poured out in the house of god amen everything i needed in my earthly journey i found it through the house of god that's why god never intended you to go to a certain convention to get the holy ghost god never intended you had to go to mecca like the islam god never intended you've got to go to jerusalem he said whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved it's to you to your children them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call praise god he said where to our three are gathered there i am in the midst of you amen but see denominational people got in my way i got to go this i got to go there you got to go on your knees is where you need to go praise god you got to get on your knees and confess your filthiness amen confess your sins he'll wipe it away he'll cleanse it better than bleach amen he'll cleanse it better than clorox hallelujah and then his presence will come in and fill you with joy amen power faith amen he'll fill you with his attributes his character his grace amen hallelujah thank god for the house of the lord amen i've needed nothing else but to sit under the presence of the holy ghost hearing the real word of god hearing the mouthpiece of christ that's all i needed praise god now look at chapter 28 here's another church in a vomit condition as gross as it is and it's one of the worst things i hate at our house you know somebody gets sick but in verses verse six this is a sphere of judgment has come upon israel remember isaiah is about 700 years before christ so they're they're not going to have a real another prophet until malachi right he's about 400 years before christ there's going to be a big break between isaiah and malachi but the spirit of judgment and god is going to god is going to there there's there it is god's going to spew them out of the land the bible says he's going to spew him out so their church is already in a vomit condition and so god said because of that i'm going to spew you out of the land see they're no longer going to be his light no longer be as this grace covenant people his light to the world right he's going to spew them out of the land so they're under judgment in verse 6 verse 6 says for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment all right now israelis now look their crown what are they crowned with what is the authority on their lives pride a crown represents authority so what authority do they have in this life not the authority of christ not the authority of the holy ghost their authority comes by pride i'm better than you i know more about it than you i know more than the prophets right i i know more than the bible i know more than jesus it's pride right there the bible said they're crowned with pride and they're also drunken with natural drink right that's what verse 1 and verse 3 says so because they're so prideful they feel like they can give into the flesh that's just like churches today you know churches today have wine tasting parties did you know that there's churches that they go have wine tasting now they don't do it at the church now i know your church the church you used to go to has beer in the in the basement remember that he went and visited a couple years ago they're drinking beer in the basement now if that isn't isaiah 28 i don't know what it is spewed on the mouth of god aren't you glad you don't go there anymore brother praise god oh man may god be merciful to them because they're uh they're polluting the very holiness of god amen aren't you glad god he he come fly by as an eagle and said come out of her brother amen come out of her my people be not a partaker of her sins and her pledge and like an eagle you heard your mama eagle and you flew up and you met with mama eagle and you followed mama eagle home glory so glad he called me out of that uh that vomit-filled church see there they got pride they think they know it all see church we gotta humble ourselves they always say lord i can learn more i want to learn more i'm thirsty for more i'm hungry for more of you now look they're preaching now look at verse 7 says he's speaking to the priests they've earned through strong wine the priest and prophet have earned now who are the priests and prophets they're the mouthpieces in this beautiful they are the mouthpieces of israel but they're the ones that are prideful and drunken on natural drink in other words the preachers are backslid so the people they're going to leave the people backslidden i'm so glad to tell you i'm not backslid today amen i came in here i had a good prayer brother mj we had a good prayer before church on fire crying out crying to god pleading for souls leading for spiritual blessings amen that's what we need today we have all the natural blessings we need spiritual blessings amen we need spiritual help today we need spiritual benefits we need spiritual blessings we need the holy ghost today amen we have all the food all the clothes and all the cars we can what we have all these things what we need is holiness amen hallelujah we need a holy desire amen a burden a leaning a word we need something from the holy ghost amen we've got enough natural things to last us for a long time right so who is perverted here the mouthpieces are the prophet and the priest see their worship is like the vomit look at verse eight for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so there's no place clean anywhere you go in the old testament tabernacle was unclean outer court inner court always of holies in god's sight it was just vomit everywhere how are you going to have any worship how is god ever going to come on the scene he's not going to come on the scene right in my two years of going to denominational churches i'm sorry i was 18 years in assemblies of god which i'm thankful for some of the people there but overall there's a lot of vomit hanging around just laying around people women dressing sexy men cussing one preach my one pastor when i was a boy he uh he called all the people's uh a cuss word right from the pulpit i mean what kind of what kind of manners is that what kind of church manners is that is that the spirit of god is that the spirit of the satan look at that you know that this is look at the condition of the churches we don't want a mess we don't want uncleanness we want holiness praise god we want god feeling free to visit our church where everything's cleaned out everything's in order everything's holy so the holy one can come but god can't come in a church like that and there's not just a little bit of vomit the bible said they're full now i don't want to get your minds going too far because that they'll probably get your stomach going but i'm saying you know it's full of uncleanness it's full of false doctrine like we said on wednesday that woman put the leaven in there and it was fully leavened see these so denominations get fully leavened their doctrine gets fully corrupted by sin and man-made ideas and man-made traditions till the whole thing is a bunch of trash right brother bang we can take that cma uh bylaws and we can just throw it in the trash because it's all infiltrated with sin right just like my assemblies of god you can take their their bylaws and just toss them in the trash well i'm glad to say our bylaws never change amen our by law is written up and printed up king james version praise god hallelujah it's the law of the holy spirit thank god but we see we're raising those things and we we can see the effects of sin and it causes a spiritual sick condition where the people know it's unclean but they do nothing about it church if we ever get unclean may god help us to repent and do something about it amen every no church is perfect right real peter fell short of the glory of god we're going to make mistakes at some point but the thing to do is clean up the mess clean up go to cleaning this is a cleaning out service maybe you don't understand you got to have a cleaning out service get all the trash out so that the holy one can come back in because he said i will not speak through a group where it's full of vomit where the tables are unclean whereas a spiritual dirty church a prideful church i will not speak in hallelujah that's verse 8 and this foretold pharisees because look at verse 11 verse 11 is the word for the day of pentecost for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people this was prophetic so these same conditions were going to be at the time of jesus when the holy ghost fell right and the pharisees would again turn it off that's why jesus looked at him and said you are twofold the child of hell i'm sorry you make your converse twofold the children of hell than you are he says you have the keys to the kingdom but you shut up yourself from going in and you keep others from going in as well therefore the greater condemnation is to you right he said it'll be more tolerable on the day of judgment for sodom and gomorrah a bunch of sodomite gang bangers it'll be more tolerable on the day of judgment for those immoral wicked people than it is for the pharisees and sadducees because they could have been the mouthpiece of god but instead they perverted the house of god they made waste the house of god they ruined the house of god but we're not ruiners amen we're cleaners amen we're those that build up the house of god we're those that are faithful to the word of god we're ushering in people into the presence of god they're keeping people out of the friends of god but we're saying come on in come on into christ come on into the word come on into revelation come on into the holy ghost and power amen i know it's small no it's humble god's church has always been that way praise god but see we've got to look beyond god does that to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent then reveal it to babe such as we learn hallelujah go to first corinthians 14 21 i'm going to prove it to you many people don't understand this scripture but it's a beautiful scripture god hath those saints speak in stammering lips now gives us an example of it he says they were so on fire with the holy ghost that they were stammering and that was a sign to these pharisees to repent but they hardened their hearts if they would have received it they would they would they would have done like everybody else they would have got baptized and they would have sent apostles and feet as they teach you the word of god let's have let's have bible study teach me the word we'll continue in fellowship and doctrine and breaking of bread and prayers that's what a real child of god does he comes to god and says feed me train me build me up i want to be a part of the kingdom of god but the pharisees stood there in their pride with their crown of pride on and their spiritual drunkenness and refuse those speakers and tongues we say let them in praise god hallelujah let the freedom of the holy ghost in here let the power of the holy ghost let the life of god in here amen we welcome it praise god first corinthians 14 21 but the battle is very few will be that find it right we're at the end time we're at the feast of weeks the gathering of the last few grains right the last few sheaves we're gleaning first corinthians 14 21. in the law it's written with men of other tongues and other lips while i speak of these people yet for all that they will not hear me sayeth the lord god sent peter paul mary mary other wonderful works of god oh no thank you jesus hallelujah jesus as a sign to those prideful devils and they said no fanaticism fanaticism and and god was pouring out this blessing and god said for all that all that 120 they won't receive it so because of that they're full of vomit uh their tables are unclean i don't care how clean they were i don't care how much ties they gave they were children of satan because they strained that in that and swallowed a camel right that's exactly right that's why many churches are legalistic like that same thing message pharisee if they don't have the holy ghost if they've if they've introduced all false doctrines many false doctrines in there with with less of the flesh and lust of the eyes and the pride of life pride in messenger churches we're better than other people see when pride goes in there what happens it's a place of vomit i don't care what name's on the door it don't matter what name's on the door it matters what name's on the soul is the name of the lord jesus christ on that soul has he marked that soul or not if he's marked that all you're god's then you'll live like he wants you to live hallelujah amen so we see the same condition at the end of the church age and the beginning of it basically the end of the old testament age vomit-filled churches not being cleaned up so god said i won't i won't and it was god's vomit right that was god jesus spewed them out of their mouth god was sick with them god tried it but he was sick with their decisions oh may god may we may we be obedient to christ church may we be humble so god so we remain in the body of christ right now i want to just give you a few visuals i think it'll help you out so there's three conditions right one speaks for god the other is rejected and this the code has no connection to god none at all but see can't you see how which one we are to me it's so plain i'm speaking for jesus today i got the same baptism as peter we've got some of the same miracles as them praise god i mean hallelujah we're not perfect you know but but only christ is but we're we're striving to be perfect amen we're pressing on with all that we have we're pressing with all the effort we're searching our salvation with fear and trembling amen hallelujah not playing games in church we're here with fear and trembling we're pressing on we're forgetting those things in the past and pressing on for the high calling in christ jesus amen we're speaking for god i'm not speaking for denomination i'm not speaking for a woman or man i'm speaking for jesus praise god i'm letting him preach today by the grace of god amen i'm doing everything i can to let him preach today yielding to the holy spirit now church this should remind us of the three kinds of believers which is true in brother branham's context but remember the church ages and other sermons brotherhood spoke of the another class of believers so four and then he says there was four crosses when jesus died all right there was jesus the same thief the lost thief and judas hung himself on a tree four people died that night so now we have the number four so see it has to fit inside here now here's where brother adam says it's phase 279 he says the word bride is the first group the second group is the foolish virgin of matthew 25. so this is the church age book you have the first group bride second group bush version third group are the borderline christians like judas where is his name judas so they come up real close but then they fall away from the holy ghost and they're lost right now people can come up close and be saved but judas sold out jesus and he betrayed jesus for money so we know he was lost right so the foolish virgin will come up to the promised land but not come in but they're still saved right but then judas came up and walked away and said i'm for selling this out i'd rather have the money okay so that's the third group judas is the third group the pretenders right the make believers so foolish virgins are believers but they're foolish to the holy ghost and the last group are those that have never been on the books of life so judas's name was on there because he had faith in christ but jesus said he blotted out so yes people can lose their salvation once saved always saved isn't always true it's not true because judas was saved he had a confession his name was on the book but then jesus said i'll blot it out the real saying is once sealed always sealed that's the real saying see they got it confused once you're sealed with the holy ghost that seal lasts not to the next revival not to next week but it's to the day of your redemption amen today we meet christ in the air amen the seal lasts until the day i get a redeemed body praise god amen the fire inside the holy ghost and fire in our souls that hotness lasts unto the day of redemption that's what it was for they didn't have that in the old testament we had that today in the new testament that's what it's for so now now we got four groups so see now we still have three kinds of levers one two three but they're in four classes and brother ram taught both of them church so they got a fit right they have to fit so the heart speaks for god still they're saved and peter is the example once he got the holy ghost he's really hot the lukewarm they're rejected they don't speak for god like the saved they're saved it's like the same thief on the cross did the same people on the cross go preaching and winning souls do you speak for god with us say the lord no he just pleaded for mercy and god gave it to him the lukewarm they spurn god's mercy they're rejected from speaking from for god like then they're lost like judas iscariot or the pharisees right because they say i speak for god but they didn't god left them then you have the cold they have no connection to god they're lost that's like pilate he never had any connection to god right he's known as a heathen now does that help by god's grace you still have the three kinds like jesus said you have hot lukewarm cold but you have two kinds of lukewarm you got the lukewarm foolish virgins they never get the holy ghost they don't really speak for god right they're just trying to be saved like lot but then you have lukewarm that get close like judas and then sell it out now to me it's perfect to me that makes perfect sense to me that makes me appreciate my bible more that makes the bible more clear to me not less clear more clear because i'm being led into all truth that's one evidence i know i got the holy ghost the holy ghost will lead me into more truth in other words my questions get answered brother william hey amen if i got a bible question there's got to be a bible answer amen hallelujah because the holy ghost will direct us to the word amen now let's do some bible teaching here now i just put a few notes here's some notes lukewarm is only used one time the greek word for hot is only used those three times okay and we'll go to the definition of that so in other words when jesus spoke to laodicean church age he was using words that just weren't used by paul they weren't used by john okay they're just used by jesus because it's an end time condition now the definition of hot though gives us some clues we've got to be spiritual clues we've got these spiritual sleuths amen we've got to rightly divide the word of truth if you look at the definition of heart where jesus used it it gives clues to what kind of condition we should be in and it's all about this church it's all about having enthusiasm what did brother say never lose your well that means you can lose it right but then can you get it back yeah so jesus definition there deals with your enthusiasm your zeal your desire okay and then peter says stir up your minds which means bringing them to a boil he didn't say stir up your soul your soul's already stirred up you just gotta stop thinking like a human because i'm thinking about it like a christian right so the human spirit or mind is where you say your lukewarm now see if we ever if we ever said we're lukewarm that's what we're talking about the human's mind my mind is just thinking worldly thoughts right now which we're all guilty of but see i'm not even going to use that word ever i'm not going to use the word lukewarm i'm just going to use the word the bible word is weary i'm weary in my mind i've got a weary mind if jesus didn't use that lukewarm word for me i'm not using it for me now you can you can do whatever you want i mean you can however you want to do it but i'm not going to connect that word to me because it's nothing about me right there's nothing about me i don't preach here and then go off and get drunk and smoke tomorrow no i'm hot for jesus i'm hot for jesus on monday just like i am sunday hey man hallelujah praise god i stay hot for him on monday tuesday when you see me on wednesday i'm still hot for him you'll see me on thursday i'm still hot bang saw me yesterday i was hot for jesus so was he he was doing work for the church amen no i don't care what day you see me on i would be hot for jesus amen might be a little weary in my mind that's different i'm always hot for jesus see so that bible language doesn't belong to a holy ghost-filled christian now if someone's not born again then yes we would say yeah you might be lukewarm you gotta you gotta break out of that condition how do you break out of that heat it up right if you're lukewarm what do you just gotta add some heat how do you get hot you gotta get start praying you gotta get in the presence of god you gotta confess all your sin right get out all this clean out all the trash they can really heat it up praise god right if you were to start a fire you got to make you got to make a place for right you got to make got to get fresh wood on there you got to clean it up you got to clean up the situation right you got to organize the situation same thing here you want a fire you got to clean up your life amen you got to set your life in order if you set everything in order if you fast and pray clean out everything then you brother you sister you better believe the fire's coming how do i know because it fell on me and i was there when it happened amen i was there when it happened i ought to know praise god i ought to know because i went from not being on fire to burning with fire anyone that's born again could say the same there's a time you weren't burning there's a time i started burning and i was there when it happened i ought to know i didn't hear your church hallelujah now let's go through this now if you want to say it like this believers have all three conditions if you want to say it like that but again i'm not going to use the word lukewarm for me i'm just saying if you wanna if you wanna look at those three conditions you could say you have all three in your body soul spirit okay so look at this and your soul your heart because god's holy ghost is a fire baptism and the soul cannot sin brother william i don't care what you did all week your soul right in there it didn't sin all week no charges no condemnation the soul can never sin because god is a consuming fire god's fire has burned out the unbelief he's burned out the desire to live for the world or live for satan or live for the flesh the less of the flesh the only desire in there is god amen and i don't care how bad your week was if you're born again your soul never said jesus dropped the charges already amen hallelujah it can't sin if you sinned it was out here or out here but these two work really closely together unfortunately right so it's both of them are sitting so you might say you're lukewarm and you're thinking but i'm not going to use that word i could but i'm not going to use that word i'm using the word weary because that's what the bible says hebrews 12 3 says you're weird now look at this that greek word brother means sick paul says you're weary and faint in your mind so that that sick kind of relates to lukewarm right so i could see how somebody could say well i'm lukewarm in my mind well that's fine say whatever you want to say but i'm saying do not let the devil beat you down if you know you're born again don't ever let the devil tell you or not and don't let him ever tell you it's not for you jesus said if any man hunger and then the spirit and the bride say whosoever will praise god it's for everybody praise god in other words anybody who wants the holy ghost can have it praise god don't let the devil tell you it's not for you it is for me i am a man i am a woman and jesus said any man any woman i never let him tell me i'm lukewarm i am not a lukewarm denominational christian i used to be i used to be but i'm not what i once was praise god i'm not what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be praise god i know i'm not one of those denominational cold-hearted uh vomit-filled church members i know i'm not i got the life of god in me i got the life of jesus in me i just tell my testimony brother amen on on youtube and people start having babies amen we just started talking about jesus and people get their prayers answered amen we've got the life of god in us amen we got the words of life church god help us just to speak the word amen there's life in the power of the tongue to share testimony watch what it does like i shared bang testimony and who is about their dad my brother craig said wow i'm so blessed it was on email he said wow what that brother has such great faith you know it's like people and he's in connecticut now he's two years been a pastor connecticut and he's like wow you guys are you said 15 years you've already been in church he's like that seems impossible i said exactly right but it's just like the bible the bible said they would hear of the faith of the romans or they'd heard of the faith of the corinthians right and it blessed paul he said i've heard of the faith of the festival and the thessalonicans right and so the saints in connecticut are hearing about the faith of the akron saints amen praise god oh it's bible days today praise god now see your mind can be lukewarm if you want to call it that that's fine i'm just not going to use that lyric that vocabulary with my life i used to be lukewarm i know what it is i just get sick minded sometimes or i get tired in my mind and i need transform paul said he hated the things he did he was wretched which means he's an afflicted man see church we're all victorious in our souls but everywhere else we're afflicted we're afflicted with that sin nature right it's an affliction right it's just a it's a sick it's a sin disease that lives inside of our bodies but god knew you would overcome it so he sent you a fire to overcome it amen he sent you fire to burn up those desires when they rise from time to time don't they oh yeah my desires rise up from time to time too what does it take a good old bonfire praise god it takes a good hold on fire throw some dead confessions in there get rid of everything dead burn it up and let the fire grow praise god and that fire catches the same fire as a soul and then once i got these two on fire this guy's gonna come into obedience to it paul said the carnal mind is hatred or enmity against god that's what i was saying i wake up and i don't even feel like reading my bible the thoughts are like you're too tired go back to bed that's hatred against god's word but yeah i love the bible why would it do that because i got a i got a a sick mind i've got i got a mind that needs transformed i got a problem in my mind i've got hatred in my mind so i've got to fight against that the soul's got to make a decision say no no you're not winning today you hateful mind got it god's spirit defies you right every day we got to have that battle we're going to see god or not right i don't feel like it so you got to have the battle you got to get that sword out the devil says you don't need to read your bible but i say man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god [Applause] i don't need my breakfast first i need my bible first amen i've got to choose to pull that sword out and fight with that double-edged sword oh you know the devil's afraid of that thing amen oh it's gonna cut it up it's sharp it's so effective it'll cause him to flee he'll run you just start waving that church and you'll get the victory but we've got to be willing to fight that's where we see people get fallen away luke and luke warm right if they're not born again it's because they're not willing to fight but paul says i fought a good fight i love what he says there he says i have finished the course i have accomplished everything god has called me to do ah now we sound like joshua he possessed all the land that god gave him now he sounded like caleb caleb was a man the bible said he followed god with his whole heart he didn't leave part of his heart with the world like you know david did part of his heart with the with the bathsheba and uriah you know no no no caleb followed the lord with his whole heart and that's how he's known now as a wholehearted follower of christ i don't want to be a caleb i want to follow god with all my heart paul says i have fought the fight i finished my course in other words all that god called me to do all those that god sent me to i finished it i completed it that's my other message for tonight so now what's in your body your body's always cold unless it gets a sharp anointing of the holy ghost paul says it's the body of death body of death right because we know we die slowly right we're dying slowly but it's also it's death to the spirit of god it doesn't want the spirit of god to reign over it let me just tell a quick testimony my doctor told me this we got my physical this week he told me out of all the 40 year old men i see he said you're the healthiest one one of the healthiest of all i said that's from preaching doctor right because my body don't want to obey but i get up here i start sweating i start exercising it don't look like it but i'm actually exercising your punching and everything like that walking around here we're walking around we're looking all around we're turning all around we're keeping our bodies alive for the word of god i thought that was a good testimony my body is the body of death but i'm pumping in as much life as i can to it and even the doctors got to witness that he said you got some good blood work for a 40 year old man i said thank the lord jesus keeping me healthy i thank god for his mercy and his grace i got a little my cholesterol is a little high so i gotta eat more salads that's one thing i gotta do i gotta eat more salads this year now look at this quote bro church look at this quote from brother brown 57. listen brother you're not you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation now god might have given you a sensation to show you what he was doing in your soul but the sensation itself the crying the tongues the shouting whatever that didn't save you itself that was just a reaction to what happened in your soul god's spirit dropped down from heaven it got poured out and it ignited your soul amen it lit it on fire and because of the fire you started shouting or crying or jumping or like that or speaking in tongues because the fire is what started it amen the sensation didn't save you the sensation happened because of the fire amen the fire that saved you hallelujah you are saved when you meet god's condition of his word and nothing else that's right god's word has way you're not sick because you feel like you're saved like i said as i get older i don't even feel safe when i wake up in the morning right i don't even feel like it and brother graham said the same thing i'm not saying because i feel like i'm safe because a lot of times i don't feel sometimes just on mondays i don't feel safe because i'm tired no a lot of the times i don't even feel saved oh church god is teaching us to live from the soul we have to stop living from the flesh we need constant reminders we need constant reminders don't live from the flesh don't don't don't focus on what you feel focus on the word of god don't think about what you feel we all feel bad things right we all feel things that we shouldn't feel don't trust your feelings trust the word i'm not saying because god gave he says but i'm saved because god gave the promise i met god's conditions and upon god's holy word i can defeat say take it seven days a week because it's god's word so seven mornings i defeat him and seven nights i defeat him praise god amen by the promise of god he that hears my word believes on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but pass from death unto life that's what the king of kings said what do you believe who are you going to believe your feelings your body that gets sick and lets you down all the time are you going to believe your lying mind when you think evil thoughts are you you want to you want to do what are you going to believe your line mind or your lying body will believe neither of them and we won't believe satan either because he's the one that gave us those evil thoughts so satan take your lies back to hell with you we're not trusting in our feelings we're not trusting in anything other than the promise of god and how god backed up his promise amen he backed it up by living inside of me amen hallelujah but amen i don't feel safe a lot of the times right but i feel born again i feel born again in my soul praise god because my body gets tired the body of death my mind is tempted to think about you know worry about finances or or worry about uh problems you know or worry about the future especially the future right i've always been a warrior you know but god's given me great victories over the years but before i got married did kristen i always tell her i i didn't want to ruin her life before we get before i proposed to her brother bang i didn't want to ruin her life so i'd sit up in my uh room at akron and i would just i would just sit there and just stare at the ceiling for hours i wouldn't go to bed i tried to go to bed like midnight wouldn't go to bed to like three in the morning should i marry her or not i want to ruin her life what's your idea i'm such a warrior and after i heard brother abraham say this he said he said only marry her if you can't live with god after i heard brother ram say that i said it's finished no more worried i don't want to live my life without her i don't want to be alone and she's so much that i wish i was praise god and once that came all the worry left praise god but i've got to make sure satan don't bring that feeling back inside me worry about the church worry about my job worry about covered shots am i going to lose my job because i don't get the covenant shot i've already been inoculated from heaven why do they want me to get why they want me to get another inoculation i've already got a shot from heaven praise god all right and i've already had coleman too why don't i need another shot i mean i've already had enough praise god i got enough of what they want to give me but see i can worry about that but i've gotta cast down i gotta go back to the fire and warm the holy ghost amen and warm up my thoughts and stir up my thoughts by way of remembrance so the king of kings says you're saved by the promise so what do you say by feelings of promise trust the promise don't trust your feelings first we're going to find out one of our best friends in this day is right here we got voices we got voices right here on our phones we got voices right here all these things we hear we got voices outside all these things we're gonna find out one of our best voices is right here the best voice because you can't trust your feeling can't trust sometimes what people say but you can trust this you can rest your soul on this on the savior the king of kings rest your soul on jesus church don't trust your feelings you can't do it you must believe the word or the revelation in your soul and then say god stir up my mind today if you can't do it if you're not if you don't have the strength to do it say god stir me up today he will oh yeah like for me sometimes he'll just bring opposition if i'm tired and weary i'll bring an email where someone's really mean to me and that will stir me right up by the way or a youtube comment or something like that i'm like you want to fight me devil okay that's fine now i'm awake right or sometimes i'll get like a testimony i can put on a song and that'll stir me right up that's right praise god he's my portion amen jesus my portion i've been touched by a fire so let the world come and watch me burn amen so many times adversity stirs me up but church we're also commanded by the bible to stir ourselves up by remembrance so see church for you and i if we are born again if we have god's fire right in here in the soul then our goal is to have both the soul and the human spirit hot that's what we find from the scriptures it's our job to keep the mind hot now here's what jesus says you must be lukewarm cold or he said i wish you were zestus i wish you were hot he said i want everybody to be hot right he says better be lukewarm then coal i'm sorry it's very cold and lukewarm lukewarm is the awfulest condition you can be right the pharisees judas awfulest condition you can be in but here's hot hot is that stones jesus said i want you to be zestos in laodicea what's that mean boiling boiling hot fervor of mind and zeal so you're zealous right you've got a desire you have a fervent you have a burning desire that's what jesus said i need people with desire praise god now we know the soul is always going to have that but we need to get our minds to be that way all the time and that's what the bible says when they were all filled with the holy ghost in that prayer meeting they spoke the word of god with zestos hot their minds not only were their souls hot their minds were i've seen it at my live church too one time i preached on hell a few years ago i preached on hell and i was so hot the next monday i was so hot even after school i was at the gas station it was like 4 30 i was pumping gas i was so hot for for jesus by the way i there's a guy across the the pumps there i said sir are you a christian are you going to heaven this is just a couple years ago he said yeah yeah yeah i'm saved i said well here's my card here's my card if you need to know if you know and it was like 2018 or something if you need anything you let me know sir i was so burning with him going to hell i didn't want to see him lost i did that for the next person that like couple days in a row now i want to be that way more often right but sometimes brother my my mind is on the book right it's been on the book so see my mind's not really on witnessing as much but remember the bible said there's a time and season for everything that's how i tell mother amen before church brother bam wrote that book in 65. guess what i didn't read it till 2002 37 years later i just sat there that book brother must have sat at voice of god for all those years well maybe some of those maybe like 10 years or something then all of a sudden jesse smith put an order in church and 37 years after i'm reading it like this was fresh off the printer this is fresh from the mind of god right and it stirred up my mind and see that that's what communion with god is it boils your mind like wow i i never had this before i never knew this before look this is alive this is powerful let me be born with this truth boils you up it's always boiling something's bubbling right there's life there's movement always moved by the holy spirit see there was a time for that book to really impact my life then paul says one of his last letters pray for me that i may open my mouth boldly here's a man if anybody had the fire of god it was just man because the fire met him on the road to damascus hallelujah and he said pray for me that i'll be able to speak holy zestos hot pray for me that i can speak it on fire seek what the mystery the mysteries of god right that i may speak boldly as i so in other words this message this bible is meant to be spoken boldly amen praise god amen it's meant to be spoken with power authority and courage and strength and confidence if you look up fervor though that was a greek word intense some other uh synonyms passionate intensity zeal emotion warmth sincerity earnestness i'm eager eagerness see if we're hot we're going to be eager about the things of god i'm eager to make that right right i'm eager to read my bible now i'm eager to pray now i'm eager to witness now i've got passion to do it because my mind is filled with god's boldness the fire of god has reached out into my mind and i'm going to speak the word with boldness oh that's that we could use that bride of christ stuff i don't have to ask i'm gonna take anybody's hands i know we can use some more boneless in our minds hello church hello don't have to ask because your words whether it shows the condition of your your mind if you're bold oh brother amen let's believe let's pray brother see we're bold instead of like oh i'm sorry i can't help you god bless you see you next week right i mean we either got to be bold for the word of god or we'll be sick right the bible says sick uh that's not the word uh faith weird that's it weird that's right thank you man we're in our minds fainting in our minds we want to have boldness to step right up and say god is here god can do this god can answer your prayer god's gonna help you praise the lord amen paul says they're all prophets no all apostles no all people know do all gifts healing no you all speak with tongues no don't interpret no but covet earnestly see that's why when we come to church we want to pray god pour out gifts in the church see that's having a hot mind if not then we get we get uh we get weary in our minds and we don't we don't expect god to move we should expect god to move right we're told to do that we're told to be bold in our minds amen that's how you know your your your your your whole body your whole being is yielded to god because your soul's got fire and then in your mind you want to see more people have the fire of god remember paul prayed he said i could impart some gift to you let me let me look it up bang you're on the the wallpaper my phone though you and jose when we pray for your dad oh he's not even in there okay remember paul said he said my whole desire is to impart a gift to you yeah romans 1 11. see church this is what we should feel too and i know you feel this like when you're with your unsaved family members right you just want god to use you and just show them how real you are right but many times they rejected god and they don't no matter what you do they won't come right sometimes but look paul said i long to see you that i may impart unto you some that's what i i don't care what god gives you i just want god to give you something amen some gift some knowledge some wisdom some tongue some interpretation some prophecy some miracle some divine healing god just impart something to your people i don't care what it is give them a gift god amen bless them with some spiritual gift gift is a charisma right it's a gift it's a freely given blessing it's favor god give mj favor today god give brother stephen and brother amen favor today give them some form of your favor amen that's what paul said that's what a real prophet would say we got to come to church like that lord give brother jesse some favorite today give brother william some favor today right give him some blessing some gift so he can be used for your glory thank god did you see that bang you're on my phone you're well you and the lord jesus and brother william no no who is right here amen and then there's lydia and malachi right there that's just a joke i always want to think about the things of god you know paul said follow after charity see if you've got to follow after the fire and desire spiritual gifts to keep your mind saying god send us gifts send us gifts i got the fire i want to see more fire but rather that you may prophecy god give us a prophecy for tell us what's going to happen wherefore brethren covet same thing desire desire prophesy prophecy and forbid not to speak or tell you but i'm jealous that's the same word that hot boiling i'm boiling over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband in other words i don't want them to be become uh flirters with the world i don't want them to make love with the world i've got a real burden for the church of god that's what paul's saying i'm boiling for the church of god galatians says it is good to be boiling always in a good thing see church that's why brother ann would say if you if you start an orphanage he said that's a great thing to do because you're boiling with helping the poor children and the bible said pure religion visits the fatherless see so always always be zealous for some good things that's why church i used to i wasn't always zealous for book writing but now i'm really zealous for it because i think this will be a good thing i think it's going to show people that the message is backed up by the bible that's what the message is the bible right it's the revelation of the bible see we must be always boiling for some good thing for music for about amen right he he just got he's gotta be faithful right you gotta you gotta always make me boil for more music and he may have other gifts than that right but we could see that or like i was talking to his brother um i don't think he'll mind how many know brother mike mccloskey i talked to him two days ago on the phone he's in a wheelchair right and god still hasn't healed him from his paralyzed state because he got shot right in the middle of the back right there but he said this on the phone we're talking he's like brother jesse he said i just want to find my gifts in the body of christ i'm like brother that has been the desire of my heart for my church for like ever and i said brother tell me some of these testimonies he was in lowe's lows where you buy home decorations you buy uh tools right loads you know what loses like a home depot it's like a whole maintenance store right he was in lowe's there's a woman who had what was her problem i think it was like some type of a disease like some type of disease like in her back or something like that this brother's in a wheelchair he believes the message right so he he goes up and they're just talking and she said oh i've got this i got this i don't know if there's like a cyst or something and he said can i pray for you now this is a man that he asked god to heal him and let him walk but god won't answer his prayer he said can i pray for your cysts on your back he said he just laid his hand on this woman had short hair she cut her hair too that's just honoring her husband he's in a wheelchair he just laid his hands on her back and prayed and she started jumping and screaming and shouting and lows he said she started jumping she said it's gone it's gone she said your hand is so hot your hand is so hot thank you thank you he's like don't thank me thank christ and he said the holy spirit put out his heart leave right away because she was gonna like just thank him instead of christ so he just scooted on his wheelchair down the road and he said that it happened numerous times a man that god won't heal but using him to heal others now that's fake church i said brother you have the faith of give the gift of faith get the miracles that's a miracle and definitely divine healing too as i listen to all these testimonies see and then church now once you know your gift right invest in those right god help me to be ready to pray for sick people praise god amen you understand and i said brother i said brother that's chapter 11. i said i said uh i mailed him a book and he said yeah i got the book right here i said open up chapter 11 he said he opened it was exactly on chapter 11. he said look at that the lord wanted me to see that i said i teach on all the nine gifts of the holy spirit in chapter 11. proving what it is without a man without a shadow of doubt now church if that's and you know what he said he said brother jesse i'm not a scholar like you preachers i can't memorize things i can't i can't even remember all these scriptures he said but i have a burning passion to witness and to pray for sick people oh and i said brother let that let that fire burn let that desire burn let that mind boil up just give yourself to your gifts and your tales and god will bless you praise god that's what i want to see bride of christ fellowship everybody knows what gifts you got but then also you can say i'm always zealous for all good things anything that's a good thing i'm going to be zealous for i want to be i want to send money to prison right if that's a good thing brother william i want to be zealous and i want to do it i always want to be boiling with a good thing for god's kingdom praise god apollos was fervent boiling in the spirit and now he wasn't even born again right because they in ephesus they didn't know the holy ghost right so he was just boiling in the human spirit until paul said until paul came then they got the real fire paul said we should be kind to one another fervent boiling in the spirit not lazy in our work but we should be hard workers lydia's picking berries out there all summer in the hot sun she's she knows what it's like to be fervent in spirit you got to be real real zealous to work in that kind of heat 90 degrees picking blueberries i used to shovel i used to shovel mulch in 90 degrees one time i passed out i worked too hard that day i didn't drink enough water too fervent corinthians says remember we saw this last week where he's comforted by titus remember that last week god may send me to comfort you or vice versa you may come for me he said but your fervent mind toward me he was blessed by his boiling mind toward paul there's my hour give me let me close the 50 minutes here let me quote i won't be able to finish this man my goodness i have so many quotes so see church we should have a we should have a boiling mind we should we should want to talk to the preachers right we should want to talk to everybody in the church we should have a boiling mind how can i help brother so-and-so how can i help sister so-and-so we want to be boiling about good things in other words we always want to be focused and meditated on good things in our minds epiphanes was always laboring fervently in prayers for the colossal he always had on his mind i need to pray for the saint i need to pray for the sin the bible said confession falls to another the fervent prayer the boiling prayer of a righteous man avails much oh let my prayer boil for my soul hallelujah see that you love one another with a pure heart boiling a boiling heart you really love people right you really love them and he says how you're born and he says you're born again by uncomfortable seed and he said above all things have boiling charity see if we look down in our minds and we see the water's not boiling god stir up my water stir me up stir me up help me to have a boiling mindset to do something good boiling to to be a blessing to somebody boil me up help me to be eager to do something for the kingdom of god this is a a normal problem for a holy ghost christian because paul and peter are both saying this be fervent don't be lazy be fervent right always do something good be fervent for any good thing see because it's something that happens to all of us it's this battle it's this land it's full of giants it's full of uh squatters but we've got to conquer the land we've got to be the joshua army we've got to show boiling fervent love for the people of god this is the battle we're all called to listen church you're going to be boiling for the world or boiling for christ let's be boiling for the son of god the one who died for us the one who uh came to save us the one who took the cross for us the one who bled for us let's be boiling for jesus christ don't worry about things because jesus will work it out right let him worry about it right jesus will work it out if we let him now there's so many more i have this is slide 35 over 2 almost 30 quotes just on brother barron's quotes he net okay one time yeah let me show you but here's the one time he says lukewarm christian so this can only be foolish virgin i'm not saying this is scary i'm saying this sanely as i know how to stand near the pulpit and say it but my heart's been stirred for a time and i know that we're ready for something now come on in and you christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore so see that's the foolish version because a holy ghost to a christian he's not lukewarm he can't be he's got eternal life he's already passed from death luke warmness is death it's death it's spewed out it's sickness a real christian those already passed from death unto life now i'll go to my favorite one so look see i studied all this up for you i don't have time to preach all these i wear you out um so i'm just gonna hit my favorite yeah so lot is the most often person chose to express lukewarmness now church look at that lot live right next to all those sodomite homosexual men that were violent gang bangers violent men that beat down doors just to get more men he lived right amongst that the bible said he was tormented day and night but he was a believer but there was a better believer there was abraham who said i'm not i don't care how much money they offer me i'm not buying property inside of i'm going to live away from those sinners and i'm going to train my family and friends to honor god so which one are you are you the one living close to sinners and being tormented by it every day because you're too close to it when you could just move out and enjoy the peace of god and live with the promises of god and have the son of man visit you amen hallelujah by an oak tree amen i don't know which one are you brother random always uses a lot and look church look at this he wasn't the mouthpiece lot was not the mouthpiece of god because he went to his son-in-laws and said you got to come out and the bible said they laughed at him yeah you're an old fool father-in-law yeah like like we're going to burn inside him see he wasn't the mouthpiece anymore but abraham was the mouthpiece abraham was the mouthpiece of god hallelujah him and his wife sarah up there so because god went to them and god said i'm not going down to sodom my mouth amen i'm saying with abraham's seed i'm saying with the royal seed of abraham praise god i'm saying with my mouthpiece in other words and brother man said billy graham is a modern day lot he called him by name remember billy graham taught you got the holy ghost as soon as you say a sinner's prayer oh lord forgive me i'm all my sins come into my heart amen i'm filled with the holy ghost and they act like a bunch of dead church members don't they they're going to smoke and drink and cuss and watch dirty filthy things and living homosexuality and living adultery that's what most of them do live in adultery right there and say they got the holy ghost they're far from it because my god's holy praise god he cleans out the church before he comes in amen he cleans it up it's not a sick church it's a healthy church it's a vibrant on fire church that's the kind of church he visits like ours amen hallelujah praise god you don't visit those billy graham denominations but bless his heart but he don't visit kind of those they're no longer the mouthpiece of god they can't even figure out do i get the holy ghost when i say a sinner's prayer or when i got real boldness to speak the word of god i can't figure out they can't forget this does a woman preach the bible or not the bible says she shouldn't but my pastor says she can i mean are you serious that's not an on-fire church right and on fire church is a saint paul fire baptized that's some of their names holy ghostfield church holy ghost and fire baptism in the church if paul said it i believe it that settles it i'll be judged by that praise god amen fearless with the word of god not these well i don't know i guess i'll let my wife paint her nails and wear high heels and show off her her body to the whole church and wear skin tie i guess it's okay if you wear skin tight clothes in the church you compromiser you lukewarm lot church member is that right that's what mrs lot was she must have been that because god turned her into salt god turned her into a piece of salt so she must have been some backslidden make-believe like like you this is scary she was lost but sarah wasn't anything like that she was a woman of promise she saw the son of man coming to cern standing behind her in the thoughts and tense of the heart she saw the sign of the son of man and we've seen it too it's thus saith the lord the last sign of the gentiles thank god we've received the sign and billy graham went like okay that's a fine sign and he walked away right no and he knew the man he knew the sign he knew that man and turned down the son of man that's foolish that's a lot experience well we like brother ram's gift but when he starts preaching the bible well maybe you should read the bible remember i saw that i told you i saw that article i saw the interview with billy graham they said what's one regret you have he said i wish i would have studied my bible more why wish you would have too you found out that brother branham wasn't he wasn't off his rocker he was right on the word he was right with the word and he had the signs to back it up which you didn't have right and then and the same said now it's easy to preach on the ground let's bring it down to us right are we boiling for jesus it's good to preach on that but let's check ourselves there was lot that lukewarm church member half backslidden see kirk you're not a lukewarm church member if you're praying for the i'm talking about if you're born again if you're praying for people if you come here worship god with all your heart give god your tithes give god your offerings anything the church is into you're into it you're not lukewarm you're a lukewarm church remember that god spewed out your mouth if god's ever witnessed you use you to witness to people and do those things you're god's mouthpiece you might be humble but you're still god's he still brought you with his own blood amen hallelujah and don't trust your feelings trust the king of kings amen trust the promise maker hallelujah he's the promised keeper too amen i'm sure lay there until you get the holy ghost until something happens then you can go on with your life you know i'm not a lukewarm church member anymore right look at that a modern billy graham he calls him my name to this prophet by this point brother william he took off the point he he took off the the punching gloves he took off the boxing gloves it's a bare fisted match by this point he said i'm not playing around in 1961 he comes out i'm not playing around anymore with the trinity it's thus saith the lord it's of the devil he took off his his gloves there so this is gonna be a real fight now and that's when they said get rid of away from another brand away from other brands away from the word are you serious away from the gifts that can tell everybody the secret to their heart brother mj i got a video brother ram told a woman 15 secrets 5 10 15 in one prayer line told her her name her address her doctor's name just like jesus at the woman at the well he said go get your husband he said i don't have him he says you're right you had five and the one you're living with now not your husband she said i perceive you're a prophet amen that's who's visiting our church amen the son of man amen that's a modern billy graham but the son of man jesus christ has visited this generation giving us stuff saith the lord that's what we stand on that's what we have that brings us to boiling i hope you're getting close to boiling by now after an hour and 15 minutes of preaching here if you weren't already i was already after that good prayer meeting i was already boiling when i got up here that was like a fever pitch here now look now look a loop what is a lukewarm church member to be scott he makes fun of the church you never i hope you don't make fun of me i hope you don't make fun of brother random lukewarm church members make fun of the holy ghost they deny the power of the holy spirit luke 1. see if you ever study the quotes on lukewarm brother graham never calls it himself he never calls it into his church let me get to my favorite one out close i said that 15 minutes ago look at all the spiritual food i brought you guys today yeah i'm an audience also you're cutting it short look at that where is it how's it going where is this uh this might be the best quote god's provided a place to worship now we're already resurrected oh i'm gonna say it again i don't think you heard that now we're already resurrected that's better that's it church i was dead in sin i was dead and said brother mj i was dead in sin when i heard this message i rose up and i'm alive now praise god i've got life i've got the holy ghost i got fire amen i was dead in sin but now i'm alive in holiness praise god jesus said rise up jesse rise up here's life and he breathed on me receive you the holy ghost i'm alive now praise god i've been preaching 17 years i don't have any plans on stopping i'm alive in christ hallelujah that's my wife i was dead in christ for a while i was dead and sin for a long time oh but now i'm alive nobody can tell me different and the dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work quickened us and we're quickened up into the prince of god where his spirit is that's where you are right now church anybody thinking about work right now anybody can't wait to get to work tomorrow oh no no what are you thinking about the things of god well here you are you're right up in heavenly places i sure wish i could get to that computer and type out some more of those spreadsheets boy that'd be great we wish i could grind some of more of those tools you know i wish i could go teach some more kids how to read i'm not thinking about that i'm in heavenly places right now praise god we're in the mind of christ amen we're seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus sitting there the great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead i'm already fired up we're a part of it if you're part of the bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know we find out it's the same thing you should do exactly what's predicted for her to this day she won't be a laodicea not by no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for god shall be moving on in the spirit of god i'm going to more truth i'm being guided to more truth i'm learning how to please god more i'm learning how to surrender now i'm always affected i'm always boiling with something good to do for the kingdom of god amen she won't be a lukewarm she'll be an on fire because the fire is already inside of her yep lots of quotes less than our feet i better stop right there i could keep going and going i so again this is in the book figure
