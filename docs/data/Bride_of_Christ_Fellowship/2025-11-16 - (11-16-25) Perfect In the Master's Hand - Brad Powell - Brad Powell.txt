So it's going to be quite a quite a powerhouse of ministers. And but the more important thing is is the powerhouse of God &gt;&gt; and that that's in that's in his people and that's a worldwide ministry. So uh but you are all invited. If you need a place to stay, please let us know. Contact Brother Tommy, uh brother Troy, myself. We will we'll definitely find a place uh for you for you to stay and enjoy the fellowship. We'd love to have you. So um if you would let's just go ahead and stand. We'll get into the word. And is it okay if I take this coat off? Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, here we are. Right here. Can't fight with a coat on. If you would turn with me, if you would in the scriptures to the book of Job, the book of Job. And while you're turning there into the to the book of Job, I want to just read you something that the prophet says. And he he's quoting Revelations 1:6. And he says, "He hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever." &gt;&gt; And he goes into the quote in the church age book and he says, "He hath made us." He says, "Oh, there's certain truths that we need to emphasize." And this is one of them. He He made us. Salvation is his doing. Salvation is of the Lord. all of grace. He redeemed us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He bought us &gt;&gt; for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Your life is for a purpose. You're not here by chance. There is a reason that you're sitting in this building tonight under this ministry, under this city. It's for a purpose. He says, "But now we are spiritual kings." Now, I want you to grab a hold of this. You are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom. He says, "Right now, we reign with Christ, &gt;&gt; having dominion, &gt;&gt; over sin." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have dominion over sin. That means you own it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You have dominion over sin over the world, over the flesh, &gt;&gt; and over the devil. &gt;&gt; He says, "Showing forth his praise and glory, showing forth himself, for it is Christ in us." Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't say it was just Christ in the preachers. It was just Christ in the ministry or it's Christ in this. It's five in the five. He said it's CHRIST IN US, ALL of us. &gt;&gt; And it's Christ moving in us. And he said he's showing forth himself, willing, doing his good pleasure. Yes, indeed. Even now, we are seted seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So brothers and sisters, we think about this and we see that God in this age that we're living in, this hour that WE'RE LIVING IN, GOD is moving. &gt;&gt; God is moving IN HIS PEOPLE. GOD is delivering his people. God is healing his people. God is restoring his people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve. Now, let's look at let's go into this and let's look at now Job for if we could for just a minute. There was a man in the land of Oz. His name was Job. And that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and a skewed evil. &gt;&gt; Now we look at that word is skewed evil. Now I'm sure you've been taught this. You've got a very very good biblical solid teacher as your pastor. &gt;&gt; So I'm a little intimidated to be preaching up here just to be honest. But he we look at that word is skewed evil and it means to deliberately avoid or abstain from. &gt;&gt; So we see that Job in his mind in his heart he deliberately stayed away from the evil things. &gt;&gt; He deliberately stayed away from things that would hinder him from walking in the life of of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deliberately. &gt;&gt; There were born unto him seven sons, three daughters. His substance was 7,000 sheep. 3,000 camels, 500 oak yolk of oxen, 500 sheasses, a very great household. So that this man was the greatest of all men in the east. His sons and went his sons went and feasted. Now I want you to grasp this. His sons went and feasted in their house, everyone his day, and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and drink with them. Now watch what Job does. Job. It says, "And it was so that in the days of their feasting were gone about that Job sent and sanctified them. He rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." What was Job doing? Think about this. What was Job doing? Job was taken in the mind of his of his own self and he was thinking of his children &gt;&gt; and he says, "Look, my children has have went. I know that they had a get together. I know they had a little party. I know that they done this. So, I'm going to go give them a burnt offering. I'm going to make a sacrifice so that my kids are covered under the blood." &gt;&gt; Job was being the Holy Ghost to his children until they got the Holy Ghost. Listen, young listen listen people. We've got to be as adults. We've got to be the Holy Ghost to our children &gt;&gt; if they don't have it. &gt;&gt; And Job is DISPLAYING THIS RIGHT HERE. I'M going to make a sacrifice for them. So Job was being the Holy Ghost. Let's go on down. Now, this is where it gets interesting. And this is where we're going to go. &gt;&gt; Now, there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also amongst them. We're here today, sons and daughters of God, assembling to come before the Lord to hear what the Lord's got to say. Where do you think Satan's at today? &gt;&gt; Yeah. He come in the door, too. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's not on any anybody here, not a flesh. We're not we're not pointing fingers. But we got to realize that there's atmospheres. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's anointings. There's atmospheres. There's spirits. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" And Satan answered the Lord and said,"Well, from going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down it." Where you Why are you here, Satan? &gt;&gt; This is a conversation that's going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU HERE, SATAN? WELL, let me tell you, God, I've been traveling the earth. I've been going to this church and I've been going to that church and I visited this this person's home &gt;&gt; and I visited that person's home and and I went to that young person's school and I went to over here. You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; AND SO NOW GOD AND this conversation is taking place. Now Job has no idea that this conversation is taking place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of times God is petitioning for our benefit &gt;&gt; and we have no idea what is taking place. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" Oh, what a glorious statement. &gt;&gt; "Hast thou considered my bride? &gt;&gt; Hath thou considered my church in Ohio? &gt;&gt; Have thou considered Malachi? Have thou considered the different ones sitting here? Have they has have you considered these young people? &gt;&gt; The conversation taking place. &gt;&gt; There is none like him in earth. A perfect and upright man. One that fearth God and escueth evil. I want to title my message today perfect in the master's hand. &gt;&gt; Perfect in the master's hand. Let's just bow our heads and pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with grateful hearts. Thankful Lord for the opportunity to be here and how we've been so blessed over the last day and a half here and now the opportunity to come and just to minister the word. We've had fellowship and we've had beautiful singing and testimony and but now we come to the most important part and that's the preaching of the word where the word goes forth. The word that that changes our lives. The word that delivers us from from habits. The word that heals our bodies. It's based upon this word, the heavenly word. the words of Jesus Christ. Father, we ask that you would come down this morning and you would just move and as we set aside this time just to to worship you and serve you and and hear what you would have in store for us. You know, we're needy people and you know the needs of your people. &gt;&gt; So God, we ask that you would just sweep in our presence as we feel the presence already. that you would just go in and out of the aisles and up and down the aisles of our hearts this morning and open our hearts, Lord Jesus, that as the word goes forth that the the anointing and the and and as the word goes forth, it would be received deep down into our hearts a lifechanging word of God this morning. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We give you honor, praise, and glory. And we lift your name on high. In your precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can have your seat. Sorry to keep you standing so long. Now, Brother Tommy preached last night or he ministered and ministered through testimony and I don't believe he broke a sweat. Well, that ain't me. I'm going to sweat. I'm going to spit. I'm going and I'm not hollering at you, but it's just the way it comes out. &gt;&gt; So, just just pray for us. Pull. You pull. I'll preach. I'll preach as long as you pull. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; There's no limitations on what God can do. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're looking here at Job and we begin to look at the life of Job. And and and many of us, we would begin to look at this and we would say immediately we think about Job and we would say, "Oh, this poor pitiful Job. This poor pitiful man named Job. Look at all he's going through. Look, look at all that that that that he's going to be going through." Because we know the story, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we look at the story and our mind goes to a place of trials. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Our mind goes to a place of trials. And it goes to a place of hardship. It goes to heartache and pain and remorse and agony. BUT WHAT WE'VE got to realize is that things aren't always as they seem to be. &gt;&gt; Things aren't always as they seem to be. Because those words that I just said, agony and distress and pain and heartache. Those are just descriptive words describing the circumstance that Job was going through. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; It in no way describes the man Job. It doesn't say anything about the character of Job, &gt;&gt; but it is descriptive words that our mind goes to and we think of and we begin to look at those. Now, I want you to listen to what the prophet says about Job. The prophet says Job was a great man. &gt;&gt; He says there was nobody like him in all the days. Job was a prophet. He said people would come from far and near to hear Job. &gt;&gt; He said here they were. they would come and and God blessed him. He prospered. He was rich. He had thousands of cattle and sheep and things that he had. He said people, now I want you to watch the way God looks at Job versus the way we think about Job. &gt;&gt; The prophet says this. He says people, he would go out into the streets and young princes from the east, the magi, the wise astronomers, they would bow before him to ask for a word of his wisdom. &gt;&gt; Now, that is describing the character &gt;&gt; of Job. &gt;&gt; That's describing the man Job, who Job was as a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, Satan may use a lot of different words to describe what you're going through. He may use a lot of different words to describe what you are going through in your life. If you lose your job, he may say you're a failure. &gt;&gt; Think about this. &gt;&gt; I If things are not going just like you want it to and life's not going well, he'll call you depressed. &gt;&gt; He'll call you stressed. He'll call you anxious. &gt;&gt; He'll say that you're fear. &gt;&gt; You know what fear is? False evidence appearing real. &gt;&gt; It's not descriptive of who you are. &gt;&gt; It's descriptive of a circumstance that you're going through. &gt;&gt; So here we look at this. We look at this and we see that sometimes things are not going well and he may look at you young people and he'll say, "You're lost. You don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Has he ever said Has he has he ever spoke to any of us? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure he has. He speaks. He'll say, "Are you you're lost? Your life is hopeless." These are the things he says. But brothers AND SISTERS, WHEN GOD SPOKE ABOUT JOB, HE DIDN'T use any of these words of negativity. He didn't use any of these words of doubt. But the Lord says there is none like him. So when Satan comes knocking on your door, it's up to us to say THERE IS NOBODY LIKE ME. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MY GOD SAYS. &gt;&gt; There is none like me in the land. And and he says he was a perfect and upright man, one that fearth God and is skewest evil. So brothers and sisters, the devil may call you a lot of things in this life, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD [screaming] SAYS YOU'RE MY SON, &gt;&gt; you're my daughter. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY SWEETHEART. YOU'RE MY LOVE. YOU'RE MY BRIDE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY GOD SEES YOU. &gt;&gt; NOT AS DEFEATED, NOT AS DEPRESSED, NOT AS STRESSED, NOT as anxious. &gt;&gt; He sees you as bride. &gt;&gt; So don't ever let the circumstances. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the circumstances describe who you are. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we all have circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We all have circumstances. &gt;&gt; That's the reality of this thing we call life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But the bride don't quit. &gt;&gt; The bride don't don't give up. &gt;&gt; The bride don't throw IN THE TOWEL. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE GOING gets hard, she gets she rises up to the occasion. &gt;&gt; When the pressure BEGINS TO BUILD UP, SHE SAYS, "I KNOW WHO MY redeemer is. I KNOW WHO MY GOD IS. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; you see, our minds think the way uh don't always think the way that God thinks. &gt;&gt; And us as human beings, we get into a place that we see things in a bubble, might we say. Well, let's say it this way, and I preached it this way before. Just imagine if I were to stretch a string across this wall all the way through the building and it went all the way through the building and right in the center of it we tie a knot in this nylon string. &gt;&gt; Now you can't see the beginning of it &gt;&gt; and you can't see the end of it &gt;&gt; but all you see is a knot. &gt;&gt; And that's the way our life is. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Our life is just a knot on a big long string that you can't see the beginning from the end because it was in God's mind from the foundation of the world and it runs all the way through eternity. But we see a lifespan &gt;&gt; three score and 10. Ain't that about right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking at. And it looks so big and so magnificent, but in God's mind, it's just a dot on a string. &gt;&gt; But yet, we get bombarded. We get to thinking these are look at what we're going through. Look at the stress. Look at the look at the things that Satan's doing. Look at how he's affected our church. Look how he's affected our youth. Look how he's affected my home. Look how he's affected my career. &gt;&gt; And it's all in that knot. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the knot. Look at THE FINISH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD says it this way. He said, "My thoughts are not your thoughts. &gt;&gt; My thoughts are not your thoughts. Neither are your ways my ways." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's why we GOT TO GET OURSEL OUT OF THE way in any decision we make in life and say God what is your will? &gt;&gt; What is your way? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAY. MY WAYS ARE HEAVENLY. &gt;&gt; My ways are higher than your ways. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T THINK EARTHLY. &gt;&gt; We think earthly. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job was a perfect and upright man. And we think about the word perfect and we know that that word means it means without thought, without defect. And we think about perfection. I I got to thinking about the a diamond. And you know, brother Brandham, he talked about he was down there in the Kimberly mines of South Africa, one of the greatest diamond mines where they produce all the diamonds and a lot of the major diamonds of the world. And he said the guy told him he looked over there and he seen a he seen a pile of diamonds. And the prophet said he was looking at and there was nothing for it. There was nothing to look at. But there sat this pile of diamonds and he asked why are these worth so much? There is nothing to look at. And the guy goes back and he responds to him. He says what you're looking at is the unfinished product. &gt;&gt; These stones have to be cut. &gt;&gt; They have to be cut to show what's on the inside of them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Perfect in the master's hand. &gt;&gt; The word diamond comes from the Greek word Adamus. Now, I want you to look and know what the word Adamus means. When you look at a diamond and you take that Greek word Adamus, it means unconquerable or indestructible. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. GOD LOOKS AT [screaming] HIS BRIDE AND SAYS, "LOOK, THIS IS MY BRIDE. SHE'S JUST LIKE A DIAMOND. SHE'S BUILT HARD. She's built tough. She's built resilient. She's indestructible. She's uncorruptible. She's undestructible. &gt;&gt; That is God's bride. &gt;&gt; How do we get there? We look at this. We think, "HOW IN THE WORLD DO WE EVER GET THERE? How do these diamonds, we look at them in and a diamond we know is so beautiful? It sparkles. It glistens. It's beautiful. It radiates light." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some of us as Christians sometimes we're not radiating the light we should be radiating. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "I'm a Christian. I go to church about once a month." &gt;&gt; And a lot of light shining. &gt;&gt; Hey, I I I told I preached the other night at home. I said, "It's Wednesday night. We we we running about twothirds. Where's the other third? What's so important? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes, brother Jesse. &gt;&gt; That's good, sir. &gt;&gt; But where's the other third? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What's so important? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to be in the house of God. WHY? BECAUSE THE HOUSE OF GOD is the house of correction. THE HOUSE OF GOD is where we get cut. It's where we get molded. It's where God shapes us and shows us who we are. &gt;&gt; He begins to bring out the brilliance. How? Through the word of God. &gt;&gt; Through the preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Diamonds. You see, they are some of the most remarkable creations that God has. &gt;&gt; But these diamonds, they don't come easy. When a diamond for it to be built, for it to be formed, it has to go under intense amounts of pressure. &gt;&gt; Heavy, heavy, heavy pressure. 90 to 100 miles down deep into the earth. and it goes under the pressure of about 725,000 pounds per square inch. To give you an illustration of what that would be like, they said the illustration would be like taking the Eiffel Tower, turning it up on its top, and balancing it on a sugar cube. We're built for pressure. &gt;&gt; We're built for challenges. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we are. This this diamond here is under the ground and and in the earth's mantle and all this pressure and this heat 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. We don't like it as humans. We don't like it when the heat gets turned up. &gt;&gt; We don't like it when the challenges come. &gt;&gt; We don't like it when the devil knocks. We don't like it when we don't have food to eat or the cupboards bare or or we don't know how to make the next payment or or the the kids get sick or the you know what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; But that is heat that's being put on the diamond &gt;&gt; and it is making something special out of you. Why? Because you don't retreat. &gt;&gt; Every day your feet HIT THE FLOOR. YOU'RE IN A WAR. YOU'RE IN A BATTLE. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And deep down inside the earth, these diamonds are sitting down there where it's dark and it's hot and the pressure's on. &gt;&gt; But it's right there where the magic begins to happen. &gt;&gt; It's right there where the magic begins to happen. &gt;&gt; Circumstances. &gt;&gt; Circumstances. LIFE. LIFE IS WHAT transforms the ordinary carbon into an extraordinary piece of work. &gt;&gt; It's the life challenges that create that perfect diamond. &gt;&gt; The earth begins to quake. Challenges begin to come. You ever had your life shaken, brother? Sure. WE HAVE YOUR LIFE. SOMETIMES YOU GO THROUGH LIFE AND life begins to shake you and it quakes you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; But what it's doing is it's building. It's it's beginning to bring something up to the top of the surface. &gt;&gt; That diamond lays there under that pressure, under that heat, and the volcanic begins to erupt and it begins to push up what's down deep down inside &gt;&gt; and it brings it to the surface. And if we were to reach and grab it, we would say, "Look at this old rock." You see, the work's not done. &gt;&gt; The work's not done. There takes more than that. A and I got to watching and and I kind of get get hung up and I told the church at home, I said, you know, I get to watching this guy on YouTube. Forgive me, but he's a diamond specialist &gt;&gt; in New York. And they bring him these diamonds and he he begins to grade them and he'll scale them out and he looks at them and he examines them and he he takes and he looks at them and they'll bring him I'm talking 250 $300,000 diamonds. One diamond. not not a bunch, one. And they bring it to him and he begins to look at it and and he says, "You know what? There's four things that determine the quality of this diamond. One is cut, one is color, one is clarity, and one is carrot weight." And he gets his little scope and he begins to look at that diamond and and he says, "You know what? I liked the cut of this diamond." He said, "It's it's cut just like I like it." You see how they cut diamonds is they take a wheel and it's it's cut it's covered with little pieces of diamond because a diamond is the strongest material on the face of the earth. So a diamond has to cut a diamond. &gt;&gt; So God has to cut. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? But that that master cutter, he'll take that stone and he glues it onto a onto a rod and it goes into this machine and he'll take and he'll take and he'll set it down on that grinding wheel and he'll hold it down there and he picks it up and he looks at it. I like that. But the work's not done. &gt;&gt; He takes and he takes that machine and it's got little dial on it. He'll move it one degree and he'll set that stone back down and he begins to hone on it again. And this goes on and on and on and he'll change this degree and that degree. What's he doing? He's cutting out all the imperfections. He's cutting out all the impurities. He's cutting out everything that would keep that diamond from being exactly what he wants it to be. &gt;&gt; So when God comes cutting in our life, &gt;&gt; and God begins to grind us on the wheel, &gt;&gt; what's he doing? He's saying, "I'm getting rid of this. I'm getting rid of tobacco. I'm getting rid of pornography. I'm getting rid of lust. I'm getting rid of doubt. I'm getting rid of fear." WHY DO WE LET FEAR CONTROL OUR LIVES WHEN THE Bible says fear not? &gt;&gt; So God, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE those fears, those anxieties, those doubts and depressions &gt;&gt; and go to GOD AND SAY, "GOD, CUT me and hone me into the image of you. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost hone down the Holy Ghost bride." And &gt;&gt; that inspector, he looks at that stone and he begins to look at it and he says, "You know what? I like the cut. It's cut perfect, &gt;&gt; but now we got to look at the color." And he takes a stone and he puts it in this in this piece of paper. It's folded up like this. And he sticks that stone in that crease. And it's a solid white sheet of paper. Do we have any diamond inspectors here? Works for GIA. I I'll make sure I'm on the right track here. No. Okay. So he puts that diamond in that paper and he looks at it. He says, "Ah. Ah, that's clear. That's a good diamond. That's clear. &gt;&gt; The master cutter knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; He knew how to cut that stone SO PERFECT THAT NOW WHEN the light hits it, &gt;&gt; it's reflecting exactly back where it came from. &gt;&gt; There is NO SMUD IN THAT DIAMOND. There's no fog in it. It's clear. It's crystal clear. &gt;&gt; That's the way God is working on us in our lives. &gt;&gt; He's clarifying us. &gt;&gt; The cut, the the the color, the clarity. He's clarifying us to be what he wants us to be. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the one that I really like, and it's carrot. You see, carrot is is important. Women, you like that big diamond, don't you? Look at you smiling. All of you is thinking, "Man, one of these days Mr. Wright comes along. I'm gonna get me one of them big old diamonds. You too young ladies. Y'all y'all be patient." &gt;&gt; But he say, "I I look at this diamond. I want this big giant diamond." Well, that ain't always what you're looking for &gt;&gt; because you can take a the the good thing about the way God's economy works is you don't have to be some big somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm just who I am. &gt;&gt; Like I told you last night, I'm country as cornbread. &gt;&gt; I have a farm. I work. I fish. I hunt. I I got a job. I'm just an everyday normal guy. Just like Tommy, just like Troy. We're just everyday normal people just like you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm nobody big. &gt;&gt; But it's not how big you are. &gt;&gt; It's how well you've been cut. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Give him praise. &gt;&gt; It's the challenges you've been through in your life that makes you who you are. You see, a half karat diamond that is cut appropriately &gt;&gt; is worth way more than some big somebody over here that hadn't been through nothing. [applause] &gt;&gt; That little diamond sparkles and shines so much brighter &gt;&gt; because why? It's been through things. It's been through hardships. God has been molding. God has been making. God has been building. And God has been perfecting you into the image he sees from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, this immense amount of pressure that Job endured, what was it doing? It wasn't God wanting to break him down. It wasn't God trying to humiliate Job. It wasn't God trying to make Job think, "Oh, your life is the pits." That wasn't what he was doing. But he looked at Job and he said, "This immense amount of pressure I'm putting you under is going to make you love me. It's going to bring you closer to me than you've ever been before." &gt;&gt; Just like that raw diamond, Job had value from the beginning. Like that pile of diamonds, they were valuable. &gt;&gt; Job had value, but his trials were necessity &gt;&gt; to bring out the brilliance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Crushing experiences. &gt;&gt; I've been through crushing experiences in my life. &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy has been through crushing experiences in his life. Brother Troy, &gt;&gt; you know, we could spend days sitting here telling our story. We've all got one. &gt;&gt; Betrayed. &gt;&gt; Lied about. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Made fun of. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; For the stand you take for the standing on the word. &gt;&gt; These look like to our flesh crushing. Family can hurt you. &gt;&gt; Friends can hurt you. &gt;&gt; But it begins to get build this transformation on the inside. This transformation that happens on the inside. And when God puts us through those things, &gt;&gt; it's not to punish you, &gt;&gt; but it's because he trusts you. &gt;&gt; Think about this. When Job was sitting there and the Lord said to Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; And he says that to him, Brother Brandham said, "God had confidence in Job?" &gt;&gt; He said he had confidence. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAD FELLOWSHIP with him. &gt;&gt; So when you're in your trials, go to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When troubles come, stay before God. Fellowship in the light of God. He said God knew Job trusted him and so he trusted God. He said Satan, he told Satan, now listen this conversation, Job still has no recollection of this conversation. &gt;&gt; You think you think Satan don't talk to God about you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure he does. Sure he does. And so now here's this conversation going on and and and and God says, "All right, Satan, you go on. He's at your hands, but don't take his life. You can do anything else to him." And the prophet says that that that he says, "And Satan is good as his office and away he goes." &gt;&gt; So let the torment begin. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We're not going to spend too much more time on Job, but I want you to realize a lot of times we don't look at Job through the through the exact thing we hear about Job and and his boils, right? That's the big thing. Well, let me tell you a little bit about that those BS. You see, I I'm a nurse by trade, so I look into things probably different than some of you do. So, I thought, what is this? WHAT IS THIS BOILS? What is this disease that Job had? &gt;&gt; Remember now, Job is sitting on an ash heap. &gt;&gt; Do you know what an ash heap is? An ash heap is where they take all the garbage in the town in the community and they put it in there and burn it. That's trash. It's it's broken pieces of material. It it's it's dung from the septic and they take it there and burn it. And now Job is sitting there on this ash heap covered in bulls. It's actually a syndrome that the medical field has named Job's syndrome. And we hear about the bulls. You often wonder why did he take a piece of broken vessel and was scraping? Because he was in a garbage pile. He found a piece of broken glass and he's itching so bad. This Job syndrome causes you to have bulls on the outside from head to toe and you itch so bad that you just want to claw. So he picks up a piece of garbage, a piece of broken vessel and he is scraping his bowls and we think we got life hard. &gt;&gt; And he's scraping his bowls. And these bowls don't just stop on the outside. They go down onto the inside and he begins to get bulls on his lungs. It becomes even worse as the pestule begin to come out of the gums of the teeth. Staff infection, MRSA, these are major major bacterias. So here Job is up here on this ash heap and he's going through all of this. So all of this looks like that he is in a place that there is no recovery. Sometimes we feel that way. &gt;&gt; God, I don't know if I'll ever GET THROUGH THIS. GOD, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN EVER COME out on the other side of this. &gt;&gt; But here, Job sits there and brothers and sisters, Job, God knew that Job had the fight in him that he was going to overcome the temptation to throw in the towel. &gt;&gt; How many times have we said, "I just want to quit." &gt;&gt; Brother Jesse, 20 years, pastor, and there's times, I'm sure you've said, "I just want to quit." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why do we do this? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But God &gt;&gt; has the confidence. &gt;&gt; God has the confidence in the man of the hour and the man of the scene. There was no quit IN HIM. NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, no matter the hardship, no matter Job believed that God could fix it. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I hope this is hitting home. When sickness came, Job knew that God could make him well. &gt;&gt; When this fortune was taken, everything that he owned, HIS CHILDREN GONE. EVERYTHING he owned taken, Job trusted God could restore. &gt;&gt; And when death came to take his children, Job trusted God. &gt;&gt; And that's hard. &gt;&gt; That's hard. We need such a trust in God that circumstances don't matter. &gt;&gt; And we're here. I I hope this this will build your faith. I'm going to give you some testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our God is a miracle working God who's doing miraculous things. Not in just our church, not in just that church over there or this church or this church, but worldwide. God is doing things. And it's the hour that we're living in. We're living in an hour where we see Mark 16:17 coming into action. Signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Now, somebody told me, they said, "Let you you preaching signs and wonders awful hard. Is everybody going to look to signs and wonders?" &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brown said, "You have to be careful preaching signs and wonders." &gt;&gt; He said, "Because people will look for an an emotion or or something like that." We're not looking for a dance. We're not looking for a shout. We're not looking for that. But what we're looking for is for God to move in his people and to follow the believers like the word says. &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders shall follow who? &gt;&gt; The believers. &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have? &gt;&gt; I told somebody the other day, I said, "Listen, we're going to pray for this situation and we're going to believe God is going to move in in the way that we're that we're asking." &gt;&gt; Now, we want his perfect will in everything, &gt;&gt; but we're going to believe. &gt;&gt; Why? because I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Why would I doubt? &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I DOUBT WHAT GOD SAYS CAN BE? &gt;&gt; It's up to him. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about Cody. How long have I been up here? I I usually look at the clock. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about Cody. So, Cody Cody is my nephew. Cody as a as a young child. Cody as a young child was one of the most tender, sweetest young young men you had ever as a young child growing up. Satan come into his mother and father's marriage. My sister-in-law and this is okay. I I promise I'm not I've talked to him. I can share this because it helps people. Satan come into there and separated the home. Cody couldn't handle it. Cody at the time didn't have the Holy Ghost. He'd been in church his whole life, been raised in the message, been raised to know right and wrong, to been underneath good leadership, good teaching, good good uh good uh spiritual leadership, but it was more than he could handle when that pressure came on. A young man, so he turns to drugs. He turns to hatred. Hatred. Hatred is a is a evil evil enemy. &gt;&gt; And he became so he he became addicted to these drugs that he just couldn't get enough. And and his life was just going downhill downhill downhill in shambles. &gt;&gt; And I would pray and I and the Lord just would I just couldn't go say nothing to him. He he he knew where I stood and I it just the Lord wouldn't lead me to go to him yet. His mom calls and says, "Cody's really going through it." And I said, "Okay, I'm gonna pray." So, he don't like to talk to nobody about it. You know how that you know how that spirit is &gt;&gt; when that spirit gets on somebody. Don't talk to me. You don't know. So, one day I Lord laid it on my heart. I said, "Sarah," I said, "I'm going to go talk to Cody." She said, "He won't talk to you." I said, "I'm going anyway." I said, "Now's the right time." So I go and he's at his house alone and I I knock on the door and he Uncle Brad come on in real nice. I said and we talked a little bit and I said, "Cody, you know this this road you're going down, it it's not a good road. I know." I said, "Well, I just want you to know I love you. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; No matter what you're going through, I'm here for you. I love you." &gt;&gt; We talked for a few minutes. I I didn't say nothing to nor about church, nothing. We just small talked. I left. Few weeks later, he calls and he he's decided, I need Christ. I need God back in my life. &gt;&gt; Now he's facing the biggest challenge because he has an addiction. So now he's facing a challenge that he he's never had to face before and that's coming off of that addiction. &gt;&gt; So he his mom calls. It's before a service on a Sunday. She calls and and says, "I need to bring Cody there. When you can you you and brother Ber pray for him before service." I said, "Yeah, come on. Bring him here." Well, he he don't want to come and he's in his pajamas, but he said he'll come. I said, "I don't care what he's wearing. Bring him." &gt;&gt; She brings him into the back door into the side door of the study. And me and Brother Ber are talking and and Brother Cadre Diggs was there that morning. Y'all know Brother Cadre. &gt;&gt; So, he was there that morning and I said, "Cody, what's going on?" on. He said, "I'm tired of living this way. I can't do this no more. I cannot do this anymore." And I said, "You believe God?" He said, "I don't believe in your God." And the next words broke my heart and his mother's heart. He said, "I hate your God." I said, "You don't mean that. You don't mean that. You know better, Cody. He said, "What's he ever done for me? He my my home's ruined. My my my dad's over here. My my home What has God ever done for me?" I said, "Cody, you don't mean that. God's been good to you." And I said, "Those circumstances, there's nothing in your control. That has nothing to do with you. There was decisions made, choices made that led down that road. &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE LET MY DAD go that way, the decisions he made, it wasn't God done it, &gt;&gt; it was the decisions he made. &gt;&gt; I said, "Listen here, Cody. You got two choices." And and forgive me for being just blunt if that's okay, if I can just put it that way, but this, you know, sometimes people just need to hear where the rubber meets the road. &gt;&gt; And I said, you got two choices today. You got choices to make. &gt;&gt; I said, Cody, you can go back and you can find God and you can go right back to where where that sweetness was, where that tenderness was, where that Holy Ghost was at, and you can find yourself back in church and turn your life around or you can just be the butthole. Forgive me. That's what I told him. That's that's as honest as I knew how to be because he was so mean, so angry. I mean, you could not stand to be around. Nobody wanted wanted him at the We didn't want him at Thanksgiving. Didn't want him at We didn't want him nowhere around because he was miserable and he wanted everybody around him to be miserable. We prayed and I'd like to say that instantly it changed. But it didn't. It didn't. Brother Jesse, we prayed and he said, "Take me home. Mama, take me home. I'm leaving." I said, "No, Cody, you said if that you said if if if Kaye, that was his sister, she was in town. You said if Kaylee would come and bring you here, you would come here and you'd stay for the service. You're not going home. Take me home, mom." mom. I said, "Listen, your mama's not taking you home." I said, "You're going to be a man of your word. You're going to listen to the service. You're going to stay here. You're going to listen to the service. I'm not going out there." I said, "You don't have to go out there. Stay right here. I'll stay right here with you." He stayed there. God began to move. God began to work. God began to to do something in his mind that began to change the way he was thinking. He began to realize this is not the life that I want to keep living. This is a life of destruction. This is a life of death. &gt;&gt; He checked himself into rehab. Now, we know that rehab is is just rehab. It takes God to do the work. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with those programs. He needed to get away. He needed rehab. &gt;&gt; So, he over time, couple weeks go by and I'm getting reports from from his mom and he's having a hard time and he's withdrawing and he's got the shakes and it it was so bad and and it was so bad that that people were almost willing to give him the drugs he needed because he was in such a detox before he went. It was bad fentinel. And so here he is now and he's he's in this detox state and things are not going. But all of a sudden once he got rid of the the spirit that was the addictive spirit. &gt;&gt; Now he's beginning to realize, hey, God can do something for me. &gt;&gt; God can make a difference in my life. &gt;&gt; And he he he he I caught him. I you had to wait two weeks before he could talk to anybody. You know how it is. They lock you up like a prison and you ain't talking to nobody because you got to be under their their control. So, two weeks go by and I call him. I said, ' Cody, how's it doing? He said, 'Uncle Brad, he said, 'I just want to say thank you.' &gt;&gt; And I said, 'What do you mean? What? Thank Thank me for what? What did I do? I said, "What? What? What? What? What did I do?" He said, "Thank you for talking to me the way you did." He said, "If you had not talked to me and if you had not told me what I needed to hear and that God loved me and you love me," he said, "I couldn't have done this." About six months ago, he celebrated one year of complete sobriety, serving the Lord, &gt;&gt; going to church, &gt;&gt; serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he's asked to God to give him a a Holy Ghost filled uh uh uh girlfriend, might we say. So, he's talking to somebody now in the church. And it it gets better than that. Let me share this with you. We'll go on to something else. They told Cody that he he got to going to church and he got to going. Well, he started going on not only Sundays, not Sunday afternoon, but he started going on Wednesdays. &gt;&gt; Well, he's locked into this house. They won't let him, you know, you got to be here. You got to be there. You got to go to your job. Come here. You got to report. They come to him one day after he'd been going to church for about two or three months. Every Wednesday, every Sunday, every Wednesday, every Sunday, and they said, "We've got a new rule." Now, listen to how Satan is. We got a new rule. Everybody living here has to be here for our service on Wednesday. We've got a Catholic priest going to come in and preach to y'all on Wednesdays. He said, "Uh, I go to church." They said, "It don't matter. The rules are rules. You have to follow the rules. If you're going to live here, you got to follow the rules." He said, "You'll have to kick me out because I've got a church." And we don't believe the doctrines of the Catholic Church. We believe the God of a Holy Ghost fil God. I go to church. I'm coming in. I'm reporting. So, either you kick me out or I go to church. He's still going to church. They said, they told him, they said, we have seen such a change in you. &gt;&gt; Whatever you're doing, keep doing it. &gt;&gt; You have our permission. You one out of however many people was there. You got my permission to break the rules. &gt;&gt; God is a miracle working God. my brother-in-law come up and we got our church has a lot of a lot of family. A lot of Tommy's family, a lot of Troy's family, a lot of my family. We're just a big family church, okay? But different families, just a bunch of us. My brother-in-law comes up and he can't hardly walk. He's coming down the aisle and he's almost in tears. Now, my brother-in-law is what, six, 63, 6'4, 200, John 6'4 or 6'2, 63, 200, whatever pounds. Big guy. sawmill logger. Big guy, strong. I I I seen him and his brother pick up a motor one day out of a Detroit engine and take off and walk with it. Big guy. And he's coming down the aisle and he's almost in tears, just barely moving, barely walking. And he don't he don't come up a whole lot. I said, "What's the matter? What's the matter, John?" He said, "My back." He said, "I can't hardly walk. I can't understand this. He said, "They they're saying I need surgery. They're saying all this." I said, "You believe God can heal you?" He said, "I do. I that's why I'm here." I said, "We're going to pray that God just heal you." &gt;&gt; So, we began to pray. We anointed him with oil. We prayed. And after the end of the service, I went back into the study and something just said, "Sign that handkerchief and put a date on it and say, "Healed from sciatica." So I found a magic marker and I took that handkerchief that I had I preached with and I wrote on there John Ler healed of sciatica and the date and I took it to him. I said you put this in your pocket and you just keep claiming that healing. &gt;&gt; You keep believing it. You keep believing it. &gt;&gt; Time goes on. Time goes on. Time goes on. And I finally one day I thought I said, "How's your back?" He said, "I'm fine." &gt;&gt; About a year passed, he pulled out of his pocket. And he said, "You remember this?" I said, "I do. I remember it very well." He said, "Never been a problem since &gt;&gt; that's God. That's not man. I can't do that. Brother Jesse can't do that. That's God moving on the scene." &gt;&gt; Sister come down to the down to the prayer line one day. She says, "I'm having tremendous pain in my back." And she said, 'Ive been to the doctor and they said that that that there is a nerve that that's being pinched in my back. I said, 'I got an answer for you, sister. That morning, when I was out doing my my morning exercise, I had my headphones on and I was listening and Brother Brandham was talking and he was preaching and a sister had come up down to the prayer line and she said, "I he looked at her. He said, "You're blind, aren't you, sis?" And she said, "Yes, I am." And he says, "What it is is a Satan, a spirit has got in there and has grabbed a hold of the nerves behind your eyes." He said, "We'll pray that it will be released." So I told her, I said, "You know what? It's not that you got a pinched nerve by your bones. Satan has come in and grabbed a hold of your nerves." I said, "But God said &gt;&gt; through a messenger &gt;&gt; that that we could pray and that Satan would have to release his grip on your body." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in that message, he he prayed for that woman. He said, "Now you can see me, can't you?" He said, "Look at my finger. How many am I holding up?" She said, "One, brother." &gt;&gt; I pray we prayed for her and I said, "Satan, release your grip off of our sister. There is no peach nerve in her back, but Satan has got a hold of her. release the release this grip you've got on her and let her be well. &gt;&gt; And of course, me being medical, that's not always a good thing. I'm a nurse by trade. Being medical, I called her a couple days later. I said, I said, "Hey, how's your back doing?" I said, "Are you getting any better? You feeling any better?" "Uh uh yeah. You feeling any better? Is it getting better?" She said, "Why would you ask such as that?" She said, "I'm healed. I've had no more problems. I'm still trying to see the symptoms. &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy comes up for prayer. He you heard a little bit about it last night, but you got to realize he didn't tell all the story. He told a little bit about his condition that he had. This aorta that he has or had, we'll say, &gt;&gt; let's put it in the right tense. &gt;&gt; This aortic dissection. I'm a nurse. I know how tremendous this is. My grandfather died in 30 seconds of an aortic dissection. Most people never make it to the ambulance. Most people never make it out of the driveway. When this thing tears, blood rushes out of the bottom of the aorta, the biggest val the biggest vessel in the heart. So, you've got seconds to live. He comes up to me and he says, "I believe I'm healed." I said, "Praise the Lord, Tommy." tell what I said, "Praise the Lord, Tommy." He said, "But they want me on medicine." He said, "I'm not taking any more medicine. I want you to pray that I don't need medicine." And I'm thinking, "Oh my Lord, [sighs] oh God, how could you ask me such as that?" &gt;&gt; Cuz I know I know how important it is that his blood pressure stays perfect. &gt;&gt; I know how important it is that blood flow stays perfect in his body. He's got a wife. He's got a child. He needs to be there for him. &gt;&gt; We can't just be going out here and just willy-nilly throwing things around and praying and believing. So, we can't. And I'm thinking, hold up. You're looking at it through the eyes of medicine. &gt;&gt; And as he's standing there, they come to my thought, it come to my mind. If he believes it, who are you to doubt it? I said, "Let's pray." How many medicines you on now? &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; That's his faith. That's his belief. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. We got a young couple in the church. Can I give a couple more, Brother Jesse? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We got a young couple in the church. She'd been wanting they've been wanting to have children for some time. Maybe a year maybe. I think maybe a year. Brother Troy couldn't couldn't couldn't conceive. Couldn't conceive. Couldn't conceive. We had meetings and and we had a prayer line and and and brother Andrew Spencer was there and brother Timothy and several of us ministers were up there and she come through and just tears and you knew exactly you knew immediately what what she wanted, what her desire was. She said, "We want a child. We want a child. So we prayed. The other day she brought the ultrasound to church. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God moving in his people. God moving in his people. On the scene in his people. &gt;&gt; One more and then we're going to move on. Our pastor's wife, my sister Donna, many of you may have heard. I don't know if you know her, but she comes and she she come into the study one day and man, Brother Ber's back there and she's just in tears and she says, "My back and hips are just they're just killing me. They're hurting me so bad. I can't I can't stand I can't get no relief." So, we began to pray and we prayed and she got a little bit of relief, but but come to find out, she had had a she had had a wound and and she'd kind of kept that secret. It was it was private. It was it was a wound on her breast. It's okay to say. and she thought maybe it was a maybe a spider bite. And this wound just wouldn't heal. It wouldn't heal. So, they end up they talk her into going to the doctor and and I'm sitting at home and and my phone rings and I say it's my pastor. I answer the phone and there's a pause and then I can hear in his voice the the tears and the trembling. I said, "What's the matter?" He said, "It's not good." And he's just he's just in tears. I said he said, "It's not good." I said, "What what's going on?" He said, "We went to the doctor and they say she's got cancer and it's it's in her hips. It's in her back. It's in her lungs. It's in her lymph nodes. Where else?" It it was they said, and this doctor looks at her and says, "You got three months to live. You're going to die. You're going to die from this cancer." Now, how would you like that to be your doctor? &gt;&gt; How would you like that to be your doctor? you're going to die from this cancer. So, he calls and we get together, me and my wife and and and another sister in a church is a nurse and we're trying to help and lead and guide him. I said, "First of all, we got to get to somebody who believes different than you're going to die." &gt;&gt; So, so they go into see another doctor was a local doctor, just a primary doctor in town. And the doctor looks at him and says, "You're not going to die from this. &gt;&gt; You're not going to die from this. Now, which one you going to listen to? &gt;&gt; I'm going to listen to the one that says, "You're not going to die from this." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we begin to take it to the Lord. We begin to take it to the Lord. And and on a Wednesday night, we had a all night. We well, not all night, but we had an immediate emergent prayer meeting &gt;&gt; and we begin to commit this to God and we begin to to bind our church. Now, let me tell you, we come together and she said, "I will not let this control me." Amen. &gt;&gt; A diagnosis is just an opinion. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; A diagnosis is just an opinion. &gt;&gt; She began to she continued to teach her her grandchildren in homeschool. She kept she kept the house clean. They told her to get hospice ready. They said, "Get your affairs in order. Call it get ready to call in hospice." How long ago was that? year and a half. She just got a report the other day. Things are still going good. &gt;&gt; Scans are clearing up. &gt;&gt; The wound is closed up. &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith. &gt;&gt; We need these kinds of stories. &gt;&gt; We need these kinds of things. Let me tell you what that done. It made something happen in our church that we hadn't seen in 30 years. It created a It created a a bond and a unity within our within our church. &gt;&gt; It it caused us to have a different kind of desperation. &gt;&gt; It caused us to believe in a way we've never believed before. &gt;&gt; Sister Donna told us, she said, "I I know. I don't know why I had to go through this, but what I do know is it changed Brother Thomas's ministry and it changed your ministry &gt;&gt; and it's grew our church. Yes. &gt;&gt; Our church used to be a little bit separated, a little bit standoffish from one another, but now, no, it's brother and brothers and sisters are are are all coming into one big unity and and and we we're having fellowship and we're getting in the word of God and we're watching God move on the scene. See, it's about what God does through the circumstances. &gt;&gt; God is in control. Let's go to another masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy, be honest with me. How long have I been up here? &gt;&gt; Is this okay, brother? &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Let's get back now. Let's look at another masterpiece. The prophet tells us, he says, God has been again making him a masterpiece. He said, "Because he struck Adam to get a piece off of him, a part of him, a rib to make him a wife. &gt;&gt; He struck him." Now, remember, we're talking about Job. We've been talking about diamonds. We've been talking about cutting. But he says, "Now, here was Adam in the garden, and God struck him and pulled a rib out of him." Why? WHAT DID HE WHAT WAS HE DOING? It was God trying to get the very image out of his mind into the creation in the Garden of Eden. He said, "Here is a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. Let there be Let there be light. Let there be water. Let there be Let there be cows. Let there be fish. &gt;&gt; Let's make man in our own image." &gt;&gt; And out of that man, he pulled out a rib. And he said he struck him and he got that rib and he said, "But next thing we see is the masterpiece that he struck on Calvary." So now we've got Jesus up here on the cross. And he said he got a piece of him. &gt;&gt; He was smitten, struck on the side. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What was he doing?" He said, "That was the the New Testament fulfilling the Old Testament." He said, "What it was?" He said, "It was the Jehovah, the Old foreshadowing the New. It was Christ, the masterpiece that was TO BE FULFILLED." NOW on Calvary, &gt;&gt; he pulls out a bride. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's been washed, that's been redeemed, that's been justified, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost by the blood on Calvary. &gt;&gt; And he said, now what is he doing? He's got his bride fulfilling everything that is in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Another masterpiece in the making. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your life is not ordinary. &gt;&gt; Your life is not ordinary. He said it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece and now another 2,000 years in making this masterpiece. A bride for Christ, another masterpiece. &gt;&gt; He said in doing so, he does it with his neverchanging method. The same way he made his masterpiece, the word. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not a big secret. It's the word. It's the word. So that's why it's so important that we're identified back with the word. &gt;&gt; When you're identified with something, that means that there's something there that you're relating with. &gt;&gt; It's something that you're going back to. You're recognized. And we have to recognize that the word in this hour is what identifies us with Christ. So when we look and we see Mark 16 in action, &gt;&gt; it's nothing more than the word of God manifesting itself in an identified bride of Jesus Christ. You see, by their fruits you shall know them. &gt;&gt; Now, listen. There's thousands, 44,000 denominations that are having a church service somewhere today. &gt;&gt; Think about this. &gt;&gt; They worship God. &gt;&gt; They're praising a God. &gt;&gt; They're singing songs that that and we sounded beautiful. You guys sounded just beautiful this morning. But they've got stage productions. They've got smoke. They got lights. They got mirrors. They got people coming down from the ceilings. &gt;&gt; But by their fruits, &gt;&gt; where is the power? &gt;&gt; Where is the demonstration? Because the word says by their fruits. So when we see these cancers being healed, when we see the lost being saved, when we see loved ones who's been astray and going out into the world PULLED BACK IN, &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUR FRUITS. There is your Mark 16 in action. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not because we dance and we shout. We don't dance to try to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We don't sing to try to get it. We sing and dance and shout because we've got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's why we do it. IT'S BECAUSE GOD is moving in our midst and he's working in our lives and he's transforming people. &gt;&gt; I got to try to find somewhere to get off. Brother Jesse, I know. I've been up here. But you see, who we identify with tells us a lot about who we are. &gt;&gt; You know, when you identify with someone, you become what's called an associate. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; An associate. So, if if I if if I'm doing the things of Christ, I'm an associate of Jesus Christ. Why? Because I'm associated with him. I'm associated with him on the basis of the blood that was shed on Calvary that there was a blood that says I have been redeemed made perfect &gt;&gt; and when you let me tell you when you throw that word perfect out there people will kind of look at you and like be careful be careful sir &gt;&gt; but let me tell you what the prophet said he said God was looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner &gt;&gt; oh he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you as redeemed. He says you're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ. That's the reason we can be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we can be perfect. Not in the respect in the sense that we're uh uh perfect as sinners, but we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, WE WE TALKED A MINUTE AGO about a conversation above us, &gt;&gt; a conversation between God and Satan. And in that conversation, there's decisions to be made. &gt;&gt; And so now we look and we say, "What do we identify with?" You see, it goes both ways. You can identify with Christ or you can identify with sin and unbelief. &gt;&gt; And if you identify with sin and unbelief, you're going to act like a sinner. &gt;&gt; Right? If you identify wi with with with with unbelief, it's going to lead you down roads that take you down tobacco use, &gt;&gt; alcoholism, &gt;&gt; adultery, fornication, pornography. &gt;&gt; This is the road that unbelief takes you down. &gt;&gt; So you don't want to be associated with the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; You want to be associated with the Holy Spirit. The truth is numerous people around the w world and around the country don't know a thing about Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy witnesses. He he's a is a a tremendous witness. Brother Troy, tremendous witness. &gt;&gt; But you know, if they go out and they ask people about Christ, how many of them really know him? &gt;&gt; He's shaking his head. No, we live where we live. Let me tell you, we live in the Bible, but I don't know how it is up here in Akran, Ohio. But we got a church on every corner, on every street. &gt;&gt; We got a church that that may be called the First Baptist, and this one across the street may be the second Baptist, and the one beside it may be the First Baptist. Repeat. &gt;&gt; We live in the Bible belt. So around us, this sound this sounds this sounds like that this is a foolish statement to make, but people around the world don't know Jesus Christ. That's why it's so important that they see the life lived through God's people, through God's bride, that somebody can look at you and say, "That person's different. &gt;&gt; There's something about them that's different. They live different. They act different. They treat me different. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says talking about the Isuza Street." Now when we talk about Isuza Street, we immediately our minds go to Pentecostal, Holy Ghost, falling of the spirit and then we we think Pentecost, we think dancing, shouting, running. We think of all those things. But the Isuza street was different than what that was. Brother Brandham talks about that Isuza Street. He said that's where the first falling of the Holy Spirit was when it pulled the people together. Now watch what he says. He said when Christ came down amongst those people, they were I want you to notice the spirit about them. They were gentle. He didn't say they were ripping and running. They were gentle. They were peaceful. They lived godly lives. They lived sacrificial lives. He said they were willing to give in. They were willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. How many this morning would say, "God, I'm willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. I'm willing to allow you to move in my life, to work in my life." He said, they didn't care what people said. They didn't care if they called him oldfashioned, crazy, or whatever. They wanted to be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; identified by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, we live in a world where identity has become prominent. If you're a woman, you identify as a woman. If you're a man, you identify as a man. Some men are now identifying as women, so they act like what? Women. &gt;&gt; Some women identify as men, so they act like what? Men. They build themselves up. They they they look all burly and and like a brute. So if you identify whatever you identify with, that's what you'll become. &gt;&gt; So if you want to identify as a a as a as an outlaw, you're going to break the law. when he identified as an outlaw, &gt;&gt; he broke the law. &gt;&gt; The same goes true for any of us. But if you identify as a believer, &gt;&gt; you're going to speak like a believer. You're going to act like a believer. You're going to quote like a believer. YOU'RE GOING TO BE able to do the things and have the faith that believers have. Why? Because you are a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he said, "You know, when I was a kid, he said about 12 years old." He said, "I went to the library and they had a book." And he said, "I got that book and I read about the Lone Ranger." He said, "I rode my mama's broom till it wrote it to death around the house being the Lone Ranger." &gt;&gt; He said, "And then after that," he said, "I read about a man called Tarzan of the apes." He said, 'I took my mama's rug off the floor, cut it up, made me a cloth, and he said, I slept out in the trees to be Tarzan of the apes. He said, 'But the greatest thing that I ever found when I found something real and I found something and I found God. He said, that's when I found out that that's what I wanted to identify with was the real living word of Jesus Christ. That's where we need to be in this hour, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God moving in our midst. We're going to get to the end here. Brother Brandon was talking about he said he got sent down to meet with the Pentecostals in California. And he said he went down there to the talk to the Pentecostals and meet with them down in California. And they they took him to the burial place of Amy Simple McFerson. And he said he was there and he was looking and he was going all around there and he was looking around and paying his respects. And he said all of a sudden he turned the corner and he said there stood a statue of Moses and he said Michelangelo made that statue of Moses and he said he was a great sculptor and he said there he was. This was the masterpiece his capstone work of his life. This masterpiece of Moses and he said he sat there and he noticed and he looked at it that this statue looked perfect. It looked smooth. Stand up for me brother. Come on up here. You're the center of attention. Now turn around there. Look at this strapping young man. Hold your tablets. Moses. There stood Moses, a statue of perfection. Brother Brandham said he stood there with his beard. He had the tablets of Ten Commandments in his hand. He said you could, as Michelangelo looked and he felt, he's smooth. Wasn't a flaw in him. Michelangelo looked at it. walked around him. Wow. Look at this perfection perfection. And he said, "Michael Angelo, he got SO INSPIRED by looking at the perfection of the work that he had done, the vision of his mind that had now come into reality. years and years of chipping and chiseling and working and breaking off this piece of stone, breaking off this doubt, this fear, this anxiety, breaking off ALL THESE PIECES. NOW, here's a smooth, polished, perfect specimen, the vision in his mind. And he said, "IT IS SO INSPIRED, MICHELANGELO, THAT HE TOOK THE hammer and he struck his right knee and said, "Speak." You can have your seat. Thank you. And he said, "Speak." What was that? It was so such a perfect thing that it looked like it WAS BECOME SO LIFELIKE THAT HE WANTED TO hear it speak. And brother Brandham said people that people said that Michelangelo almost ruined the statue. But he said, "No, that's not the way I saw it." He said, "I saw where he struck the leg and put a mar on it and marked it." He said, "That's what made him perfect." &gt;&gt; And he said, "There was Jesus up on Calvary. Come on. &gt;&gt; There was Jesus up on Calvary and he said there he was perfect and God had placed Jesus in a perfect position for the entire world to see what perfection look like. &gt;&gt; So here is Jesus perfection. Never doubted, never had fear. &gt;&gt; Never never give in to Satan. Sinless. &gt;&gt; He said there he sits up there. Perfect. He said, "There he was sitting there to fulfill all of God's handiwork down through the ages." Now, think about this. DOWN THROUGH THE AGES, STARTING back in the Garden of Eden, there was Adam. He took out of his side to make a bride for Adam. &gt;&gt; She was what? Imperfect. We hear the stories about Moses. And we think about how great Moses was. But down through time, what did Moses do? He gave in to temper. &gt;&gt; We look and we see Abraham. We think, man, what a great man Abraham was. Look at all he did. But he became a liar. &gt;&gt; Oh, she's my sister. You know the story &gt;&gt; twice. &gt;&gt; David, what a great man he was. What a what a great story. We hear ABOUT DAVID AND DAVID out there doing all these wonderful things until murder, adultery, lust came in on the scene. &gt;&gt; But now down through God's handiwork, down through time, finally he says, "This is my Jehovah." &gt;&gt; The perfect picture of what I've been trying to get through all of these years. Absolutely perfect. And he said, "Now that perfect masterpiece up on Calvary, God had to smoke it." Just like Michelangelo's statue of Moses was so perfect, not a flaw in it, &gt;&gt; he had to hit it. AND NOW CHRIST SETS UP ON Calvary the perfect image of what what what what the world needs, what the world deserves. Listen to me. And the prophet said there he stood. Marred. I said what the world deserves. &gt;&gt; Marred, bruised, bloody, striped. He said he sat there and he just looked like a big pile of blood and bones walking together. That's perfection. A big pile of blood and bones walking together. He didn't even look like a human being. So marred. Why? As he was smitten in his side, God said, "I got to make a bride." &gt;&gt; I got to make a bride. &gt;&gt; Perfection became imperfection &gt;&gt; so that imperfection can become perfection. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. As we close the service here, I want to share one more quote with you just to encourage you and build you build your faith through the weeks to come. You say, "How do I overcome? How do I do this? If I if I've got this bad idea or these bad thoughts or or whatever, you know, we're still flesh. &gt;&gt; We're flesh. We battle. Every day we get up, we battle. &gt;&gt; How do I overcome this?" Brother Brandham said, "How if you want to overcome it, here's the way you do it." He said, "Just become a lamb again. &gt;&gt; Just go back to Calvary." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just go back and get under that blood. Get under that cleansing blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And and and confess what you have need of. He says Jesus is the high priest of our confession. It's that simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He says, "When you accept that you're not saved, you're not in a good place." &gt;&gt; Right? But if you'll just accept that you're saved and and you say, "I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm saved." He says, "You, I'm saved because God, I've met every requirement that God required of me. I'm saved according to the Bible, &gt;&gt; not because you feel saved, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of days I think, oh Lord, where am I at?" &gt;&gt; But if I go on my feelings, I'll never make it on my feelings. &gt;&gt; You'll never make it on your feelings. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet says that he makes it very clear. He said, "Satan can whoop you around the stump time after time on your feelings." But it's when you use thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; How many do we have saved today? &gt;&gt; Let's say it. I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. He says people, he says people may look at you and say there's no difference in you. &gt;&gt; But you keep with your confession. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. He says, "And before you know it, your neighbors will know you're saved." &gt;&gt; Everybody will know you're saved. Why? Because you're confessing it. And he is the high priest of your confession. And he's making good on what's your confession. Amen. &gt;&gt; I need the Holy Ghost. I GOT THE Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Keep saying it. &gt;&gt; Keep believing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep living it. Keep surrounding yourself around that environment. &gt;&gt; Young people, be in church. &gt;&gt; Older people, be in church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Bride, be in church. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a young man and and and there's a young man that was having a desire for the Holy Ghost. He he he just just had lived just just a good life and and just a just a fine young man. He had a desire for the Holy Ghost. He was in some meetings where Brother Ron Spencer was and he went up in there and he went up to brother Ron and he said, "Brother Ron, I just want the Holy Ghost and he was getting discouraged because he could see other people getting the Holy Ghost and he could see other things moving." And you know what brother Ron's wisdom was to him? He said, "You just stay in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will grant your desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; God will grant your desire. &gt;&gt; Weeks go by, he still has a desire. More discouragement. He goes to another meeting. Yeah. Are you with me? He's staying in the environment. &gt;&gt; He goes to another meeting. Brother Ron's preaching at that meeting. He goes up again and you know what he says to Brother Ron? Brother Ron, I want the Holy Ghost. He said, "I'm going to pray for you again." Stay in that environment. &gt;&gt; Stay in that environment. &gt;&gt; They pray. He says, "God's going to grant your desire. Stay in the Stay in the environment. &gt;&gt; If you want to be Christlike, stay in the environment." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Couple weeks go by, this young man's out mowing yards. He's mowing yards. Are you with me? He had his headphones on. He was listening to a service. He was listening to a service. And all of a sudden, the Holy Ghost comes down &gt;&gt; mowing a yard. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost comes down and falls upon him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He shuts the mower off and lays face down in the customer's yard for an hour and a half &gt;&gt; as he's receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He calls me and he says, "I know that I KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN." I SAID, "That's the plan all along." &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE stayed in the environment. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, when life looks tough, when things look discouraging, stay in the environment. Amen. &gt;&gt; This last one and we're going to we're going to close it down. Brother Brandham says the same thing about healing. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you accept him as your healer, renounce your feelings." &gt;&gt; Don't look at the symptoms. Don't look at the diagnosis. Don't look at the pain, the hurt. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the the the things that's going on in your mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But look to your healer. It's not by feelings. It's by faith. If you're healed, believe you're healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And act like you're healed." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch what this next one he says. Associate with those who believe in healing. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's who you identify with, what you associate with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want healing, believe and associate those who believe in healing, and God will bring you right out to perfect soundness of health. And he finishes that statement with it will not fail. &gt;&gt; How many believes the words of the prophet? &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the five-fold ministry? &gt;&gt; The words of a prophet in this hour that we have. Praise the Lord. Brother Jesse, won't you come? Musicians, won't you come? Won't we just bow our heads and have a word of prayer? You got just place something softly there for the Malachi. Lord, we're so thankful, Lord, and for this service. Lord, I just want to say how how much I appreciate you coming today. I I just felt your presence from the moment we arrived and such a sweet [music] spirit on the church here, the ministry, the people. [music] We just thank you for visiting us today, Lord. Lord, I I I [music] feel like it was just a broken up message, Father. But Lord, I [music] trust it spoke to somebody. I know it spoke to my heart, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, &gt;&gt; that Lord, no matter what we're going through, no matter what challenges we face, no matter the circumstances, just like Job had circumstance [music] after circumstance after circumstance, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you delivered. You restored two-fold of whatever he had before, you gave [music] back to him. And Lord, we stand before you this morning declaring who we are, the bride of Jesus Christ. And Lord, what a masterpiece as we looked at Calvary and how much you cared for us, Lord, that you sent your perfect son, [music] the sinless one, the perfect one, to a place called Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And your word tells us that it pleased you, oh Lord. It pleased you. It didn't please you because you had to hurt him. It didn't please you because there there had to be a smitten side, but it pleased you because you could see the perfection. And in that perfection, you was able to pull out a perfect [music] bride hidden and tucked away under the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, thank you for calling us in this [music] hour, for moving in our lives, for being our healer, for being our deliverer, for being our burden bearer, for taking all the fears and all the doubts and all the anguish and worry and helping us to realize that you're in control. It's not me. It's not man. When man gets into ideas in the way, it's just that in the way. So Lord, we just dedicate ourselves. We rededicate ourselves today and ask Lord that you would just have preeminence [music] in our lives. If there's somebody here that needs healing, we ask that you heal them. If there's somebody here that needs deliverance from from the from from from some habit or some form of wickedness, Lord, we ask that you deliver them. If there's somebody here that just needs redemption, we ask that you redeem redeem them this morning. [music] If there's a lost soul here, just continue to work and pull them into your fold. Father, &gt;&gt; if there's somebody here with a desire for the Holy Ghost, grant [music] their desire, Lord. Bless this church, we pray. Bless bless Brother Jesse and his efforts here, Lord. Such a sweet, sweet group people. Lord, move in their way in their midst in a mighty way in the weeks to come, in the years to come. May they may may [music] they see May they see growth.

So Lord, we dedicate ourselves to you today, Lord, and we give you praise and honor and [music] glory as our savior Jesus Christ.
