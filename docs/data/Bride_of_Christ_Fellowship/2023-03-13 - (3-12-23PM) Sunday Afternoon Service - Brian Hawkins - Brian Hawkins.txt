========================================

hold on hold on let me sing that song yeah he who started a good work [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] you would turn the second chronicles of chapter 7. starting in the 14th verse it's one it's all my family I apologize I know you just heard this recently I've preached most of the messages more than once but I've found they don't they're not the same even though it might be the same subject matter they're not they're not they don't turn out to be the same so may the Lord bless us let's see good to see you brother Bank happy belated birthday Second Chronicles chapter 7 and verse 14 it says If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal heal their land turn to Psalms chapter 27 and verse 8. it says when thou said seek ye my face is what we just read at the second chronicles 7. you mentioned that in there if you're so humble that if they shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face so when thou said seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I see in Matthew chapter 18 and verse 20. it says for where two or three are gathered together in my name there are mine in the midst of them most gracious Heavenly Father this again that's with Thanksgiving in our hearts to to have this privilege to come and Minister your word one more time father we pray that you would bless us Service Guard my lips I wouldn't say anything contrary to that word or to the teaching father again we just ask that the people would be blessed help us to go away from here with a a newfound desire to to want to to serve you and to seek your anointing Lord we ask all these things in your precious name of Jesus Christ amen if you would turn to uh Exodus 25 in the first verse it says then the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart you shall take by offering yeah so this is a willful they're talking about he's saying that it's a willful offering something that's not held back but something that uh somebody really wants to give it it's not a it's not a requirement but uh but he's he's asking for the for the people to bring an offering and uh so if every man that giveth it willfully with his heart ye shall take my offering and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and RAM skins died red and Badger skins and them would oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense Onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate also known as the urmathama so and let them make a let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it if you take note this is the first Tabernacle that's being built so how could he say that after the pattern of the Tabernacle in order for there to be a pattern those that those that might sow things that might have made dresses shirts whatever it might be you have a pattern that you follow after now some people are able to have a vision in their mind and they're able to produce the material just through that Vision just like artists that they're able to paint something just by looking at something and they have that in their memory and they can they can put that thought on paper so for there to be a pattern there has to be something existing already right so uh and so according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle so that there we know that there's an an Earthen Tabernacle but there is also a Heavenly Tabernacle so after that pattern of all the uh of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it and then we'll skip down to the 41st verse excuse me Exodus 29 sorry a different chapter Exodus 29 and verse 41. it says and the other lamb Thou shalt offer at even and shalt do there too according to the meat offering of the morning and according to the drink offering thereof for a sweet saver an offering made by fire unto unto the Lord this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your Generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory which is also his presence uh verse 44 it says and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to me and the priest's office and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God and they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell among them I am the Lord their God amen so you could think of we're not from Egypt I've never been to Egypt has anybody ever been to Egypt I've never been to Egypt so uh you could you could pretty much type Egypt is a type of our struggles our trials our our Temptations the old man Egypt that that's where we've been brought from unto a new creation unto a new land so you could think of it of either way but I've like I said I've never been to the Natural Egypt so either way he's still God right and and I'm still his child so I am his people you are his people so he's speaking to us right so as we read in second Chronicles chapter 7 and verse 14 If my people are you his people amen so if my people which are called by my name whose name are we called by God's name through the Lord Jesus Christ if we so humble ourselves and pray and seek his face and turn from our Wicked Ways then will we hear from heaven right so and he will forgive our sin and he will heal our land now I know brother Branham somebody had asked me the last time I ministered this uh I guess it was last week somebody had asked me well how do you how do you feel about the other other side of that uh have you thought about that on uh in another way about uh healing the land now I know brother Branham mentioned that you know there won't there won't be any more revivals as far as the U.S is concerned because the U.S is the United States they they've turned they've turned their back on God so they've they've rejected him so there's a small Remnant that still served him and that's us uh so if I kind of think of that my answer to him was uh when it where it says that I will heal your land I'm thinking in my body because my body is the Tabernacle and this is the land and where he dwells there is a difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament uh but you know there are some some differences as uh you know it doesn't apply some things don't apply to us because we're not the children of Israel and you know that he's talking to the the uh to Israel and certain things but I still put my name in there I still put it in as a personalized letter to me because it's a history and brother uh brother Branham had taught us about you know uh the representation about George Washington when he went through the things that he did Abraham Lincoln uh the different things that he did we as Americans are identified through that so whether it's New Testament or Old Testament I still believe that I maintain that same representation because Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that what he did back then is it is the same thing that he could do now so uh that's kind of how I I view that as as far as uh healing our land and uh I've I've had uh several experiences of of being healed sister Kristen I understand she had the testimony of being healed in her knee and many others anybody else experienced the healing of the Lord is uh you know we're just thankful for that so that's kind of how I see that uh I try to view it differently not so much the United States but if I can humble myself and I can get myself right with him that he will heal me he will heal my spirit but as we read uh in in Exodus about the Tabernacle and in the sanctuary he said to build me a sanctuary now what is a sanctuary a sanctuary is a place where we get away from from the things of the world we get it we we like we were speaking this morning that we isolate ourselves uh not not so much from each other's presence but for a temporary time to get alone with God so uh a sanctuary is a place to where uh we could go without anybody uh uh bothering us we can get away from the problems uh if there's in the Old Testament a place of sanctuary if a man slayed another man he can go into the sanctuary City and nobody could touch him as long as he stayed within the the lines of the sanctuary City but if he stepped out of that Sanctuary he was free game so we want to come into the sanctuary What did the what did it say that the Lord Sanctified he Sanctified the sanctuary he Sanctified the the sacrifice he Sanctified the priests he Sanctified the people everything that he was in in his presence was sanctified so uh what I'd like to to speak on this evening is uh I will meet you there I will meet you there and as we read through those scriptures we we saw that he was he was saying that I will meet you there I will speak to you there and in the one once body said uh you go into this certain spot and I'll talk to the priests but we'll go into the sanctuary and I won't only talk to the priests but I also talk to the children of Israel or to the people of Israel so he could he could speak to the priests and he could speak to the people of Israel that's where that's this is where we come for the learning and for the uh the learning of the word of God this is where we come as into the sanctuary we're in a sanctuary so it's the Tabernacle where the presence of God comes and it's where it's a place of cleansing it's a place of sacrifice see we sacrifice our time from something else we've come here to Worship the Lord see the Tabernacle is also a place of worship but in order for that that worship to take place and uh there has to be a cleansing right so we have to be clean all sin every anything everything ought to be cleansed from us right so we can't come as a dirty vessel because we know that God can't dwell the Holy Spirit can't dwell with sin sin or the holy spirit is the one that we've that is one or the other that prevails in our life whichever one that we give over unto like we were talking this morning about the flow you could shut the flow of God off where you could set the flow of Satan off it's it's totally in your control which one you are going to uh accept the one that you were going to entertain uh the one that you're going to open up to so you you set the atmosphere and uh we're taught that even brother Branham said that we are the creators of our atmosphere if we get into an atmosphere that we don't like whether it be vulgarity we can change that atmosphere or Escape that atmosphere we don't have to sit there in an atmosphere of vulgarity unless you're on an airplane you know something like that you can't really go anywhere but you can go somewhere else in your mind you see you don't really have to pay attention to that because you can go somewhere else in your mind and your spirit because you could just start praying within you can ignore what's going on but he he said he said to see Kim see and uh I like how David said the Lord said unto me to to seek my face and something inside of him it's something something was struck on the inside of him that it was the desire because he was a man after God's Own Heart so we should be the same type of people that we should be people after God's Own Heart so when the when the when the word came to seeking my face uh David had said Lord thy face will I seek see there was an effort on David's part that he had to put forth right so we're not just going to be laying on the side of the street and just waiting for for God to come and to just move on our behalf but there's something that we also have to do amen but see uh but and with the with the priests it was a it was a certain called out people that could only be the priests uh not all Levites were were priests but all priests were Levites but see uh so there were special certain people that had to meet certain criteria uh they they couldn't have any broken bones they couldn't have uh they I can't remember all the stipulations but there are different things you couldn't have a crooked finger or something like that you couldn't have a crooked nose you know just different things like that the the priest had to be and meet the certain criteria to be in a perfect shape if you will and the same thing with the sacrifice as the sacrifice couldn't be second best it couldn't be a second-rate sacrifice it had to be the choice sheep or whatever it is it had to be the choice item that was being sacrificed out of a flock or whatever it was it had to be the best it had to be there had to be there couldn't be any blemish within that sacrifice but see we have we don't have Levites in this day you know when I first got uh when I first felt that I was called to the ministry uh there was I I met some resistance uh whether I should be a minister or not because I didn't meet certain criteria according to what the what the Levites were I guess but then I heard the the message one day I think uh hear ye him where he said the levitical priesthood has ceased and you want to talk about jumping and shouting I was running around in my living room I said well there's my release you know there's there's the there's my confirmation right there because we don't we cannot in this day there's there's no way that almost nobody would be able to be a minister if we had to come to the same criteria as a as a levitical priest especially when I was younger you know I've had a few broken bones so that would that would dis discredit me right there but uh and and so there's been a lot of people that's that's broken bones and different things like that but uh but I just thank God that there was one perfect high priest that doesn't have to he's already met all that and not only was he not only is he he the high priest but he's he is the life he is the blood he is the he is the sacrifice he's everything of what was required for the Tabernacle he is everything being put into one and he is a high priest of it all amen so today Jesus is our high priest he is the holiest of holies he is the Lamb he is our sacrifice and his word is the urma thumb right so for we come to the word for righteous Judgment of truth right we this this is where we judge things it's not our opinions it's not our man-made opinions that that judge things if it's right or not but it has to be according to the word so therefore this is the year of thumb and you remember uh the urima thumb of what it was it was the breastplate of righteousness and when somebody would come forth if they had a prophecy or or a word of Truth or something they had to speak it in the presence of the year my thumb and if it was truth the the breastplate would light up right but if it was false it would just sit there so that was the Judgment back then but now we have the whole word of God they didn't have this they didn't have a whole written bible back then but it uh this word is urim a thumbem so before we come to this word for righteous Judgment of truth and the stones in the ephod again would light up so if it doesn't line up with the word of God is there won't be any light right because it's not Christ because he said I am the light of the world so if it doesn't light up if it's not lined up with Christ it's not going to light up so it's just going to be nothing so let's turn to Hebrews 4 and 14. it says seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God see you don't have to take my word for it it says it right there let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities and I thank God for that but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin now see a lot of the Levites I guess you could say they probably wouldn't have so much compassion because they're man you know understandably they they might know some of our problems because they can only understand so far of what they've gone through what they've experienced that's the only thing that they could share with you but I thank God that there's Jesus Christ the high priest that has been tempted like all men he suffered under all those temptations that we go through amen so understandably he can understand everything that we're going through foreign so let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help to find Grace to help in time of need now see I can't get away from this thought here but uh I I just think so many people when you talk to when you talk to people about the word and and and you try to talk to them of how there's a a better place in Christ Jesus than the condition that they're in they say well I'm damaged goods I can't tell you we were all damaged goods because we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies so things were already against us so people say well God won't have me because I'm damaged goods I've I've gone too far I've sinned my day away not so that is not so and they they trick themselves because they have that kind of a mindset not realizing that that's just like Johnny Crowe that was that was tied up for so long and then when he was released he was freed he couldn't even understand what Freedom was he couldn't go he didn't understand the freedom so it's the same thing as people they don't see the freedom that they can attain if they would just come and humble themselves and give themselves over to the Lord Jesus Christ see they're they're hidden behind that because uh they can't see that because they just think they're looking at themselves and their condition we will never ever ever be good enough we didn't earn any of it but that's where Amazing Grace comes in amen so I just thank God for that see we're told in the word to draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto thee see there's an effort that we have to put forward amen so we have to be able to take a step forward if we just stand there and don't move how do we expect God to move on our behalf see he he said if you meet these certain conditions I will meet you there do you build this Sanctuary you do this you bring the sacrifice you do all these things according to my instructions and I will meet you there see in your troubles he will meet you there in your heartache he will meet you there in your weakness he will meet you there when you need comfort he will meet you there if you need healing he will meet you there as long as you meet the right criteria the same conditions of what he is requesting so uh when you're faced with tough decisions he will beat you there too see when you feel all alone he will meet you there he will not leave you alone see when you feel so much despair where you feel like you want to take your own life he will meet you there he will meet you there in any condition you try to you just name it if you've got a need you just you just laid out to Christ and he will meet you there as long as you meet the the conditions of his instructions amen see even if you're backslid he will meet you there if you humble yourself and get right with him right that's the first part just humble yourself that is so hard for some people they can't say I am wrong they have a hard time saying I'm sorry I'm wrong it's hard for some people why because pride gets in the way Pride becomes the issue that holds so many people back oh you might say well I'm a tough guy nothing will hurt me I can handle anything that comes my way oh you jellyfish let me tell you something you get so emotionally hurt when somebody calls you out on something or or points something out in your life you get so emotionally hurt that you know something that you don't like as being said I gotta I gotta choke myself here ha and you get mad when somebody when somebody calls you out on something but see there was there was uh there was a woman in the Bible that she didn't think too much of herself see that's the problem is uh when I first came into the message there was a Brother Bruce Faust he used to make a comment uh if you're offended I'll tell you why because you think too much of yourself and that's where we get that's a good position that we get a lot is we think too much of ourselves and that's that's where we get hurt in our pride but there was a woman one time uh that Jesus uh Jesus was coming along the way walking along the way and she was crying out Jesus Jesus have mercy on me thou son of David and we know that reading through the scripture that she had no right to call him thus the son of David you know for she was a gentile right so and what did he say he called her dog it's not meat to give dog the the crunch to the dogs at the table right or it's not it's not meat to give the the children's bread to to dogs but she came along and said but I'll just take the crumbs you know I'll take the Overflow because if these dudes aren't going to take it I'm here to step in to take it amen but see it just shows that she had the desire she had a need and she was going to take any point necessary to get what she uh to get the remedy that she needed amen and even though he called her a dog talk about emotional damage you know I said this last week I said man could you imagine somebody calling you a dog how offended but then there are some people that are identify as cats nowadays that they got litter boxes in school so it might be right down their alley but back then at that time that that was that was quite the insult you know I wouldn't want to be referred to as a dog you know or somebody that doesn't belong because we all want to feel included in something we don't want to be excluded for from anything right if there's something that we want we don't want to feel excluded you know how it feels when you try to go play on the playground a game with all the other kids and ah we we don't want you with us you know you kind of feel shame you feel embarrassed because you're not included do you imagine how this woman might have felt that day uh you can't have the children's bread but she had persistence she stayed with it just like that woman with the unjust judge judge I'm here avenge me in my adversaries avenge me judge I'm here so it's a persistence to seek after God see he said seek my face but what do we say no I don't feel like it today or is there something on the inside Lord yes I will seek your face I will seek you but there is an effort that has to come forth from us right we can't just lay around and just expect things to happen amen well praise the Lord so like I said we can't expect God to do everything for us right so there's something that we have to do if he makes a promise it's up to us to go after right see a slugger to somebody who expects somebody else to sustain them because it you know it's so much effort to put their hand to their mouth to feed themselves they they want somebody else to do something for them they're looking for a head now hey somebody else you've got so much why don't you give unto me well why don't you go work for it well I don't feel like working I've got this I've got that so people make so many excuses why I can't go to work a lot of problems a lot of the problems in this day is it's oh I make too much on unemployment to go get a job that's what it is and people aren't going to get a job we've got a hiring crisis because people aren't going to work why because they're making more staying at home living off of the system but we know as Christians you know if we don't work we don't eat right so that's kind of our our Mantra if you will I shouldn't say Mantra but that's kind of the way that we live because we do everything under Christ Jesus if we do anything we do it all unto the Lord we don't we don't work for Amazon I mean we might get paid by Amazon I don't work for I work for vitro but I don't do my work for vitro I do my work as unto the Lord and whatever vitro gets that's that's the benefit for them right because I I give my best not just because I work for vitro yeah my paycheck comes from vitro but I give my best to the Lord and then He blesses from there amen so that's what we're taught in the scriptures we will do our best because we want to do it we're not going to bring some second-rate uh work ethic to work right we're going to come and we're going to bring our best and we're going to do the best that we can every day all day until our shift is over right so that's our work ethic is Christ Jesus so so you can't have faith if you're slaughtered right because see faith is a revelation we understand that faith is a revelation but faith is also action Faith puts into action Faith does something about it amen but see faith faith is an action for faith without works is dead so let us like Paul said you you show me your your faith uh you show me your works I'll show you my faith by my works so you think it's all these works that you're that you're earning all this stuff but I say unto you it's Grace that I earned all this stuff and through my faith I'm going to do these works and you see how that works it's going to be a whole different and I'm going to perform differently through faith instead of just works see if you have faith you're already automatically going to do the works of faith amen nobody has to prompt you to do it see there was a woman with a blood issue one time so did she just lay in the street and just Jesus come to me she wasn't just laying there just waiting for something to happen what does she do oh if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment so she got closer and closer and there were people all around and there she touched she took the Hem of His Garment and then she was healed well what did Jesus feel who touched it who touched me he said well Lord what are you what are you talking about who touched you you see all these people around and you're going to say who touched me but it was a different touch it was a touch of faith because what did he say I perceived virtue has gone from me oh my see in our weakness we are made strong through him see through her weakness and through her ailment reaching out and touching him she received his strength amen see it's not in US it's not in us we can't do it but it was the effort that she put forth to go meet him amen now see uh the queen of the South which is also Queen of Sheba right she put a step forward and she'll put the put the put the shame I'll just read the scripture in Luke 11 and 31. it says the queen of the South again that's that's the uh the Queen of Sheba shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here so if if she came from the utmost parts of the earth through desert with no air conditioning it's and she brought gifts she didn't just bring a couple coins she brought Lots she brought a lot with her because she wanted to give see she gave willingly nobody told her hey give all this stuff but it was something that was within her that she wanted to give so she's going to have judgment upon men of this generation because back then she was just going to hear the wisdom of Solomon that was great that Solomon had all that wisdom but in today's the hour we've got somebody that's much better and much higher than Solomon if people aren't willing to go people just want to sit at home well I could I could worship God here I could worship God at home I could sit on my porch and drink my cup of tea and worship god well I can go to work and I can worship god well I could go to a baseball game and worship God while you're worshiping God all right but it's just not the god of the Bible see God is an object of worship right oh my you're worshiping some God just not the true God okay I give I'll give you that that yeah you can worship God at home but home is not that that's forsaking the assembling of of of of each other right that's forsaking the assembly with uh Saints of leg presses Faith the people that you need to be around I must not be talking to you all must be talking to whoever's listening so because you're here you're not at home and now I understand that there's a difference between streaming at home if you're not feeling feeling very well or something you know once or every now and then that you can't make it to church that you're going to listen from home but it's still your church right so and you're still worshiping God but you're not sitting home watching I love Susie as brother Branham calling or you're not watching Sue Thomas or or something like that you're not staying at home watching TV or some ungodly show but you're coming for you're coming and putting forth the effort to hear something to receive something from God right now we all know I'm not God I'm I'm the least of the least but hey if there's something that I could say that somebody could get more power to you so and that's what I'm here for is I'm a minister I like what brother Jesse has on on his wall in there uh about brother Brandon talking about being a public servant you know as a minister and uh what's what's the ending it says something that uh in the face if you can't take all the knocks and you know and people doing the ridicule because that's what a public servant endures even you look at your law enforcement this day and uh people in a public office wherever it might be it could be the license place and they take a lot of stuff from a lot of people so just thinking of a minister of what he had hanging on the wall if you can't do that then I would go and research your calling again yo so the same thing as a Christian if you can't take the persecution I would question your calling or go research it go to make sure that you're being called to be a Christian see this is a day that that we've got to be serious about all this we we can't be playing church anymore but if we want to receive something something from God we've got to go and attain it so if we come according to his instructions he will meet us there right I wholeheartedly believe that talking about that woman with the blood issue of how of of how she she saw Jesus in the midst and and all she needed to do was just Touch the Hem of His Garment was it the Hem of the Garment that that healed her no but it was the faith that she had in him if she could just get close enough now all I could I I can't help but think of that that woman uh that Mexican woman when she lost her baby when her baby died those deacons are nobody else that that tried to keep her down you couldn't you can't keep a mother down when she's desperate for a child she's going to find a way and she did she was so desperate that she had to get the brother Branham to get prayed for oh my but she knew where to go she wasn't sitting on the sideline you know Fido kicked up well he'll come to me waiting for something to happen but she went and met him there amen let's turn to Luke chapter 7 and verse 36. this okay this evening he's the Lord I don't plan on being too much longer listen I was feeling tired this afternoon too so I matter of fact I kind of fell asleep in there for a little bit let's see it's amazing what 10 or 15 minutes will do for you you know it almost does what eight hours will do for you it's amazing now don't go trying to live off of 15 minutes of sleep well brother Brian said no I didn't but no just just take it a rest just take it a rest every now and then just get refreshed we weren't Built To Go 24 hours a day seven days a week you know even the Lord rested from his word so and if we're Made In His Image now don't take that over don't go overboard with that one and resting too much to where you become slothful amen uh Luke chapter 7 and verse 36 it says in one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went in into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner catch that which was a sinner was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and we learned from the other uh the other gospels that this was a very costly I mean I think she spent all her her life savings on this Alabaster Box so this was very valuable to her because she spent everything that she had on this box verse 38 says and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment I'll say I'm the type of person when I read I get very visual in my head it's almost like watching a movie I don't is anybody else like that so when I read through this stuff it's like a drama being played out in my mind so could you imagine her washing somebody's feet with just tears yo if you have a little bit of water in a basin you have a hard time getting all that water on some on somebody's foot to to wash it so could you imagine how much how many tears she was shedding how much was coming from her the sincerity that this woman had knowing of what type of person she was in the presence of knowing what type of person he was and you want to talk about damaged goods these people want to say well I'm too damaged think of this woman and what she did think of what he could have done is exactly what what Simon is getting ready to say here what we're getting ready to read let's read 38 again and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now in the Pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man now notice it was within himself he wasn't talking to anybody else he said he spake within himself saying and this is what makes a prophet here or this is part of it this man if he if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner see he's saying that she is a sinner but just before that it shows that she was a sinner and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith Master say On and Here Comes the rebuke there is a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence of the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon see us out this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest be no water for my feet see that was a custom back then if you invite somebody in you take care of that person you take care of that guest but this this special guest that they didn't realize who was in their midst he didn't do anything for him he brought no water so he says you gave us me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head now you tell me which one of you is more sincere which one of you wants to see me the most which one of you has more need of me oh my see thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in had not ceased to kiss my feet my head with all doubt it's not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment with everything that she had she spent all of her money on me just to anoint me see wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little see she loved him so much she gave everything for him see there was an action that see that was Faith by her works oh my see that's something that's a whole lot different from somebody sitting on the sidelines waiting for something to happen she went and made something happen amen see there must have been something on the inside that told her to go do this kind of a thing because she probably didn't have any instruction besides if she went in there knowing who she was she probably figured well if I go in there they're going to kick me out they won't let me in here because they know what kind of a woman I am they know what kind of a person we are so if somebody came through these doors and you know what kind of person they are are you going to kick them out I sure hope not I sure hope that you would extend your arms and wrap them around them and draw them in amen see that's what loving Christians will do amen see we're not looking at somebody's present uh condition we're looking at what can be amen we're looking at an investment see if somebody came through there that's exactly what it is it's an investment amen and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven now see this confounded them because they said and they that sat at me with them began to say within themselves who is this that forgive his sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace thy faith has saved thee now they see there's something about faith amen faith can move a mountain right Faith puts into action Faith doesn't sit around sitting and stewing and whining and complaining about somebody's condition Faith does something about it now see back in back in the times of Egypt what did they do they murmured and they complained they murmured and can complain but then there was a time as the years went by they started figuring out let us cry out unto our God so there must have been something inside of them that said if we just turn our hearts back to God that he will heal us and he will heal our land and he will give us Deliverance amen there must have been something within them to come forth see they didn't have an instruction book to go by but it's by the revelation we know faith is revelation right so we know we could kind of assume that in their conditioning we could do better than this Our God can do we know that he could take care of us better than what we've got here oh my they wanted out not to say that they weren't complaining to murdering about the release later see it just seems like you can't make anybody happy they cry that they want one thing they get it and they and then they cry because they didn't get it the way they expected to get it oh well thank you for the new car but I was kind of I wasn't expecting a Volkswagen Little Beetle I was expecting a Lamborghini can't you be happy with something that you could actually drive and afford to fix oh I want a beamer I want a BMW I'm not a mechanic but that's one of the most expensive cars not just a buy just a fix Mercedes-Benz those are for Rich folks because they can afford to fix it that's not for poor people because the parts cost oh my parts cost a lot this is I had to change the alternator at our the Honda Pilot at one time this was about a year ago I think David drives it now now see mind you I did I didn't change an alternator for a long time so I think the last alternator I bought I don't know how many years ago it was like 40 bucks if it went to 50 bucks you'd have heard somebody crying and complaining actually they were just 40. let's see when I went and bought this alternator I'm glad I was sitting down because it was 120 bucks what happened to 40. inflation hit not only did it hit but it hit hard so everybody's kind of feeling that in this day I mean just everybody's struggling because everything costs more than what it used to except McDonald's food because it's not real food that's like plastic that's made edible for people to eat I don't know I don't like McDonald's food okay I do like their fries but that's about it I can't stand their burgers I can't stand that food I'd just rather stay away from McDonald's sorry McDonald's I'm not promoting your company but now Burger King no you can pay me later no oh but yeah just I can't even remember what I was saying I don't know why I went where I went but uh but anyways oh kind of finishing up in in the in the Luke chapter 7 of verse 50. he says and and he said to this woman thy faith had made has saved thee and he says go in peace now in Matthew and Mark Jesus says this about the woman married uh both of them kind of say that I think they say the same thing they're just in different different gospels so I'm only going to read one of them this is out of Matthew 26 and 13. he says verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also excuse me there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her see he thought of her so much because of what she did see if you honor God he will honor you now see kind of and I believe it would be in this same type of a manner that if we give him honor he will also honor us amen see he said be ye holy for I am Holy so you come into these the same condition of what he requires you give him honor not coming wow you're making me do this you're making me do that but it's I don't think the bride has that kind of an attitude the bride says whatsoever you want I want to give I want to come according to your way that's a bride coming his way according to the husband right amen but see this woman that that anointed his feet and and washed his feet with her tears dried her dried his feet with her hair oh my knowing that she was a sinner knowing that he was believing that he was the Messiah I want to I'll go as far as to say that I think she believed that he was the Messiah at least she believed that he was somebody important but see she came and she got something right she came and she gave him honor and that's where he met her see through this honor when she honored him and he honored her as well see what happened is when those people when Simon was ridiculing him or excuse me ridiculing her and his mind Jesus perceived that and he came to her defense so he'll do that for that he'll do that for us too when we need him he will meet us there if we need him at our defense he'll meet us there amen so if he'll meet us there if he'll defend us then what weapon formed against was shall prosper amen no matter what the accuser of the Brethren will bring forth those are old things I've repented of those things you can't use that anymore that's old news pal see when we come to the Lord we give him everything we repent we've humbled ourselves we've made things right what weapon formed against us shall prosper what accusation will the enemy have against us amen Jeremiah 29 11. he says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart not just halfway not just a half step but it's a whole step with a determination With a Purpose with your whole heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again into the place once I caused you to be carried away captive amen if you stand to your feet I'll go ahead and close yeah see faith is the substance of things hoped for see faith is good right it's great to have faith for the just shall live by faith right that's how we live for that we read that that woman was saved by her faith right but the problem is is that most people are stuck at Hope see faith is a substance of things hoped for hope is just a desire for something to happen a strong desire if you will because hope hope has a lot of power behind it but see the difference is Faith is possession hope is you're almost there but faith is attained faith is is a tangible thing I guess you could say the the distinguishing Factor faith is possession let's see there was one time that that Jesus uh called Peter or bid Peter to step out under the water Peter didn't stay in the boat right all the other disciples stayed in the boat but Peter was the one who stepped out Peter did something about it when he was called he answered the call and he stepped out but yet did he doubt when he got before he got to Jesus yeah he started to die but the point is is he at least stepped out under the water he was the only one who took Jesus at his word he was the only one in a million if you might say to take a step out amen see he gave he gave others instructions right Gideon Samson Joshua you know all these Heroes of the faith he gave instructions but you know if they didn't follow those instructions they wouldn't have made it anywhere they wouldn't have succeeded so we know that uh we know with Samson because he didn't give God his whole heart that it seemed like he kind of failed in certain areas but Gideon he was saying well if God before us where are all the Miracles but see he got to that point where Faith kicked in and he obeyed the Lord he obeyed the angel of the Lord's instructions right so we have certain instructions and if we follow these instructions what should hinder us amen see if you have a need he will meet you there Naaman in the Bible when the prophet told him to go Washington and the River Jordan seven times he looked at them you want me to wash in there yeah go wash in there for that's that was the instruction but he was too prideful at first and then then a servant said name it if he told you to go do some great thing you wouldn't hesitate to go do that great thing but he's asking you this small thing just to wash in Jordan seven times so if you would do the great things why can't you why wouldn't you do the small things amen amen say and that's where I think people get they get too embarrassed so if you want the Holy Spirit what does what is this the Seal of God the Seal of God is the holy spirit right so we know that that Holy Spirit is the token how important is that it's it's the it's the token that seals you until the day of your Redemption that's how important it is amen so what are what are people willing to give up to receive the Holy Ghost you know brother Brandon talked about MOS uh I I think it was Moe's and uh about his boss I think it was his boss he said you know if you want the Holy Spirit then why don't you come in here this is where to go get it in the in the in the mud of the pigsty they said well I'm not going to go in there well if you want it you're going to have to come in here how bad do you want it how bad do we need to how bad do we want the touch from God today amen are we willing to take that stuff forward amen see the problem is people can't humble themselves see people want to say what's that scripture uh resist the devil and he will flee from you everybody wants to quote that part of it but they forget the beginning where it says submit yourselves unto God that's a hard thing for people is they can't submit themselves because they don't want to be controlled by another entity they want to be the ones in control they have a trust issue because they can't trust anybody else especially into a being that they can't see yeah you know just like Thomas he said well I'm not going to believe that it's the Lord until I see the nails and the the nail prints in his hand but see more blessed are we if we're not offended at him and that we don't have to see those kind of things but we have that faith in him already we have that faith in the one that we can't see amen and how much stronger that Faith would be to not being able to see physically see God amen amen let's look to the Lord in prayer see the scripture says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he cares for you so let us do that this evening that we will cast all of our cares upon Him o gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just thank you for what you've done for us I thank you for meeting us here this evening I thank you for the word that has come forth and I pray that it is it's made an impact on somebody here this evening oh Father Lord I Thank of our young sister that came up for prayer this morning and uh Lord I just pray that that she would meet meet you according to the instructions that an old father Lord is she comes according to your word according to James where if anybody has has any need of healing that to call the Elders of the church and pray the prayer of faith the anointing with oil and that they shall be healed father I pray to that and not look back oh God that the Lord may she have her May her faith be unto you the author and the finisher of our faith father may she hold on to them leave unto not just her only but everybody within earshot of me speaking of the Sea Lord if there's pray that they would hold out to you or the call out to you Lord I have this situation I have this certain need in my life Lord and I will humble myself whatever it takes I will come to you according to your provided way I will come to you this evening Lord God I just pray that you just needs as they reach out to you tonight father Lord the unspoken request that might have been uh somebody might have raised her hand earlier today having a need upon their hearts but may they bring it unto you casting all of their cares upon them upon you humbling themselves before you are God and I pray that you would just move upon those those needs here tonight going on for I believe it's a promise that you said that if we would come in these certain conditions that you will meet us there oh father so Lord we're just taking you at your word tonight and we know that you are not a breaker who promises but Lord you are a promise keeper oh God and Lord we just we just cling on that knowing that that's a a promise that we're we're holding on to in Jesus Christ's name we ask it father amen [Music] amen praise the Lord I read this this song at the home church last week um not that I want to say because I don't know it I had just uh seen it for the first time last week it's called kneel at the cross anybody hear that anybody hear that song I never heard it until I sold the lyrics and then I've heard it through song one or two times online I really like the words to it again this is Neil at the cross it says kneel at the cross Christ will meet you there come while he waits for you listen to listen to his voice leave with him no care and begin life at noon and the courses kneel at the cross leave every character we'll meet you there and then the only other verse that I found or that I saw kneel at the cross there is one for all so we don't hold anybody back Come As You Are you are never the Holy Spirit do the changing but if you meet him at the cross he will meet you there for all who would his glory share bless their awaits harm can never be formed those who are anchored beautiful words um you might say Amazing Grace thank you foreign foreign foreign [Music] to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came and touched the touched the beer and they that bear him Stood Still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother now take no she didn't ask for this I know that pretty much for this whole message [Music] but we have to meet him but there was a need that he saw and he had compassion but he still there even though she didn't ask there was something that moved Upon Jesus name to where he had compassion honored and then in verse 16 it says and there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that God hath visited his people amen and this rumor of him went forth throughout all to give and throughout all the region round about and The Disciples of John showed him of all these things and then the next the next new verses talks about going to John the Baptist so then he was kind of acquainted this one that we're going to look for yeah but uh where it says in verse 14 it says that he can he came I guess you could say that your attributes a gurney in this day or a deathman um you see according to the customers of Jews but something was going to have to take place because if he was going to touch that beer or that Gurney whatever each stretcher whatever you might want to call it see they couldn't touch anything dead or they would be defiled so Jesus touched that that death bed now see if something wouldn't have happened he would have been defined but that man would have had to raise up the life for him not to be defined [Music] see there's a crater that Solomon here but there's a greater than all of them here because he's better than what the high priest said he's better than all the Jews in the Old Testament and he's better than any in the New Testament there's none like amen praise the Lord [Music] let's go to verse 30 real quick and then I know I'll be done I almost promise verse 30 says but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the Council of God against themselves being not baptized see the Pharisees of the lawyers these people they rejected the counsel of God and then and the Lord said where to then shall I like him the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have pint unto you and you have not danced but we have warned to you and yet you have not wept for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath the devil the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine River a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of all her children see at one point that kind of goes back to what I was talking about people can't be satisfied even if you give them a new card they say that for John the Baptist came neither eating eating bread or drinking wine and you say as a devil but the [Music] these people couldn't be satisfied either way but if we could just humble ourselves and accept them for who he is he will where we need him amen there any further needs a savior again if you need prayer be happy thank you [Music] sister Naomi what's one of your favorite songs like it's almost [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] he said yes blessings all right now [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
