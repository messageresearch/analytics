[0:00] he's doing here but over in the point
[0:02] ohio
[0:03] everyone's getting tested
[0:05] battles are raging
[0:09] why because there's a great something
[0:11] coming
[0:13] good and bad
[0:15] yes sir so
[0:18] we're literally coming back to the
[0:19] garden of eden once again
[0:21] there's two trees
[0:23] there's the tree of life
[0:25] yes and there's a tree of knowledge of
[0:27] good
[0:28] and evil so we want to be
[0:31] he found eating off the correct tree
[0:39] this has been a rough week for me
[0:42] all right i'll just share just a brief
[0:45] just pretty much let your pastor put
[0:47] jesse there to know uh
[0:49] i had a major trial this week
[0:52] and i failed
[0:58] you know my pastor he had a major child
[1:00] this week and uh he pushed through it
[1:02] and you know what i'm doing and pushing
[1:03] through it
[1:04] amen these trials but jesse told me just
[1:07] preached on the trials of your faith
[1:10] are more precious
[1:19] if you watch your life if you watch the
[1:22] little trials that are coming
[1:24] the devil's going to set you up okay
[1:27] he is going to burn this trial
[1:30] he's going to bring this thing it's
[1:31] going to the same thing he's going to
[1:32] bring another another trial the exact
[1:34] same thing he's going to bring this same
[1:36] thing and if you yield if you yield if
[1:38] you yield then once he brings this big
[1:40] trial down which is the exact same thing
[1:43] you have found in these trials before
[1:46] you're going to yield to it and he said
[1:48] he's the devil he's a mastermind that's
[1:51] right he works the same so he gives you
[1:53] a little little little little little
[1:55] boom here comes the big one and you're
[1:56] already in you're already in the motion
[1:58] of it
[2:00] it's almost like he programmed you for
[2:02] it
[2:05] right
[2:06] but we know that god is
[2:08] a keeper
[2:11] amen do you keep yourselves through the
[2:13] week
[2:14] are we depending on ourselves
[2:17] you better not be dependent on any part
[2:19] of your flesh your intellect your memory
[2:21] there is nothing sound in this vessel of
[2:24] yours
[2:24] right
[2:27] because if we couldn't choose to bring
[2:28] ourselves forward
[2:31] right certainly you can't keep yourself
[2:34] right we're all here
[2:36] uh on a journey as pilgrims strangers
[2:40] hallelujah
[2:41] waiting for an inheritance here
[2:44] when you go outside and you're looking
[2:45] to see the nice trees
[2:47] every once in a while maybe god will
[2:49] give us a chance to
[2:50] go on to a trip or
[2:52] see something nice and you see oh a
[2:53] mountain or man i'd like to live there
[2:55] one day or maybe you'll find this little
[2:57] cabin in the woods man that sure would
[2:59] be a great place and those things are
[3:01] promised for us
[3:16] i fail every day
[3:18] that's right
[3:20] saints of god i've never like i said our
[3:22] church i never met a perfect man that's
[3:24] right and you never will until you meet
[3:26] them yes amen amen
[3:31] hallelujah hey man so
[3:35] i thought about doing a powerpoint got a
[3:37] lot of reading and
[3:38] tonight i got a different
[3:42] thought already i woke up this morning
[3:45] early kind of having a little bit of
[3:46] something to go thoughts i thought all
[3:48] week
[3:49] just pulled things that would come in my
[3:50] mind
[3:52] uh just a couple hours before we got
[3:54] here maybe uh
[3:56] i kind of felt the
[3:58] pinpoint kind of which way to go there
[4:00] like that's grace
[4:03] so um
[4:05] if you'd like to stand for the reading
[4:06] of the word
[4:09] we'll read a very
[4:12] very important set of scriptures here
[4:15] i believe the last time your pastor go
[4:17] jesse

[4:21] everyone would get some of that
[4:25] yes i can't even express the
[4:29] gratitude to the lord for those things

[5:30] into the promised land
[5:34] verse one
[5:37] and it came to pass
[5:38] when all the the kings which were on the
[5:40] this side jordan in the hills and in the
[5:42] valleys and all the coasts of the great
[5:44] sea over against lebanon
[5:47] and the hittite and the amorite and the
[5:48] canaanite the perizzite and the hitbike
[5:50] and the jebusite you heard
[5:52] thereof what they've already conquered
[5:54] two cities
[5:56] word was getting around
[5:58] these guys ain't playing games
[6:00] they have a power they have a living god
[6:02] with them
[6:03] yes
[6:04] verse two
[6:05] they that they gathered themselves
[6:08] together to fight with joshua and with
[6:10] israel with one accord
[6:13] now they were gathering together to
[6:15] fight
[6:16] they were farming they're bringing in a
[6:18] big army a one-world army together
[6:22] right but notice this little inhabitants
[6:26] here in verse three
[6:27] and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard
[6:29] that joshua
[6:30] heard what joshua had done unto jericho
[6:33] to ai
[6:34] let's read this
[6:37] all
[6:38] premeditated
[6:40] yes
[6:41] joshua at the time of this verse verse 4
[6:44] joshua in the israelites they were just
[6:49] back at home they were eating they're
[6:50] living their lives waiting on the word
[6:52] of god and where to go next and what to
[6:56] conquer next
[6:58] and you're preparing for the next war
[7:00] yes
[7:01] but the devil
[7:02] was at war as well
[7:05] verse 4 they did work
[7:07] by lily
[7:09] that means very deceptively
[7:12] and went and made as if they had been
[7:14] ambassadors
[7:17] and took old
[7:19] so they're they're going to deceive so
[7:21] they they picked the very things they
[7:23] would need to tell a story and to prove
[7:26] a story
[7:28] and they took old sacks upon their asses
[7:30] and line bottles
[7:32] old and rent and bound up they picked
[7:35] the good stuff
[7:37] they take the new stuff
[7:39] they took the old stuff versus five
[7:42] and old shoes and clouted
[7:45] upon their feet
[7:48] and old garments upon them
[7:50] and all the bread
[7:52] and of their provision was dry and moldy
[7:56] they were actors
[8:00] actors deceivers right
[8:04] there six
[8:05] and they went to joshua why because they
[8:07] had to put on a performance
[8:10] and they went to joshua to the camp of
[8:12] gilgal and said unto him and to the men
[8:14] of israel we come from a far city now
[8:17] notice they had all this preparation
[8:20] but now they have to tell their story
[8:22] they've got to sell the
[8:24] story right
[8:29] we have come from a far country and now
[8:33] therefore make we a league
[8:38] now that was the first thing but now
[8:40] notice joshua being a little suspicious
[8:43] and the men of israel sit in the hibites
[8:47] pre-adventure we dwell among you
[8:52] pre-eventually you dwell among us and
[8:53] how shall we make a league with you in
[8:55] other words he goes how do we know you
[8:56] don't live here we're supposed to
[8:57] actually wipe you out
[8:59] now we're going to make a big league
[9:00] with you or commission of god to take
[9:02] this land and drive you out of here
[9:05] and they said unto joshua
[9:07] we're your servants notice how they
[9:09] humbled themselves
[9:10] right
[9:11] and josh joshua said unto them
[9:13] who are ye and from whence come ye
[9:17] and they sent him from a very far
[9:20] country so so far away
[9:23] my legs are tired
[9:25] i haven't had a haircut in weeks
[9:28] my beard looks like brother jose's
[9:31] lovely by the way
[9:35] he says we've come from a far country
[9:37] your servants because the name of the
[9:38] lord your god we have heard of the fame
[9:40] of him and all that he did in egypt and
[9:43] all that you did to the two kings of the
[9:44] amorites that were were beyond jordan to
[9:47] the
[9:48] sihan king of uh
[9:49] beshbon and to all king of bashan which
[9:52] was in
[9:53] ashtaroth
[9:55] wherefore our elders and our inhabitants
[9:57] of our country spake to us saying take
[10:01] victims with you for the journey and go
[10:04] to meet them and say unto them
[10:07] we are your servants
[10:09] therefore now make ye a league with us
[10:13] and now they had the story now this is
[10:15] the story they brought forth the story
[10:18] and now they said hey
[10:20] this is our bread
[10:21] we took hot for provision out of our
[10:23] houses on the day we came forth to go
[10:26] unto you but now behold
[10:28] it is dry and it is moldy
[10:31] and these wine bottles which were filled
[10:33] which were new and behold they are rent
[10:36] and these our garments and our shoes
[10:38] are become old by reason of a very
[10:41] long
[10:42] journey
[10:43] the saints of god
[10:45] we're dealing with the ones these are
[10:47] this is joshua
[10:49] and you know what his commission was
[10:51] and would god tell him as i was with
[10:54] moses so shall i be with you
[10:58] yes so we just saw the entire skit
[11:02] and where did joshua where did they make
[11:05] their mistake
[11:06] in verse 14
[11:10] and the men took
[11:11] of their rituals
[11:13] they took those gifts
[11:16] and asked not counsel
[11:19] at the mouth of the lord that's right
[11:22] let's say the word of prayer
[11:25] is jesus christ
[11:29] dear heavenly father lord jesus lord
[11:32] you know i've experienced this very same
[11:34] thing
[11:35] just this week lord
[11:39] oh god you know my failure
[11:44] how i bought that thing book lion sinker
[11:49] the lord jesus lord
[11:51] these trials are for
[11:53] future tasks god yes
[11:56] oh god we ask god you would speak the
[11:58] lord to your bride here today yes
[12:01] lord i don't want any of my thoughts
[12:04] lord
[12:05] but all we want you to say what you
[12:07] would add what i give myself to your
[12:09] lord yes and oh may your will be done
[12:12] lord among this lovely congregation god
[12:16] they have instead stood on the word of
[12:19] god
[12:21] the pastor teaches lord
[12:23] brings things that very few even touch
[12:25] or will even
[12:26] examine in this message glory
[12:30] though we ask for if we're lasting upon
[12:32] the service we'll bless the ears lord of
[12:34] the word yes lord so we pray lord this
[12:36] will be edified to your bride something
[12:39] god that will not be taken lightly
[12:42] yes lord something that we will need in
[12:44] our
[12:45] arsenal
[12:47] we love you and bless the people god you
[12:49] will bring your saints
[12:51] standing now or reverend slow to your
[12:53] word
[12:54] but we certainly love you bless the
[12:56] servants of the name jesus christ
[13:16] well thanks again you have
[13:18] a it was quite a
[13:22] drama there that unfolded
[13:25] in the book of joshua yes
[13:31] and if that was the one thing
[13:35] that kept the promised land polluted
[13:39] that was the one thing that kept the
[13:41] promised land polluted
[13:44] in the book of joshua
[13:46] they were not able to fulfill the full
[13:49] word of god
[13:51] because the great commission was to
[13:53] drive out all the inhabitants of the
[13:56] land
[14:00] and then when they drove them out of the
[14:02] land that would be their
[14:04] land
[14:06] and the prophet of god he says he says
[14:08] that book of ephesus he says is just
[14:10] like the book of joshua and that what
[14:13] those are pointed back to what the holy
[14:15] ghost filled land
[14:18] right now the holy ghost what is that
[14:20] that is our life
[14:22] that is the source of life source of all
[14:24] authority source of all power yes is
[14:27] that baptism of the holy ghost if that
[14:30] life that holy spirit god himself is
[14:33] dwelling in you you'll have to feed it
[14:35] you'll have to speak to him you're going
[14:36] to have to do all those things but to
[14:38] keep him alive and well
[14:40] in what lord him dwelling with you
[14:48] and we want those things we want to get
[14:50] back to those things
[14:54] now i want to just get a couple
[14:56] scriptures here in matthew 7 and 21
[15:00] he says not everyone that sayeth unto me
[15:02] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[15:04] heaven
[15:06] right man we know god had uh brother
[15:08] amen can probably even teach godhead and
[15:10] brother jose can teach it to his uh uh
[15:13] his grandbabies and this and that and
[15:15] show you exactly how it's not three
[15:17] persons but it's one person and they can
[15:19] bring down baptism and show you baptism
[15:21] in the name of jesus christ they can
[15:22] teach those things
[15:26] and they knew him lord lord he says but
[15:28] he that doeth
[15:31] yes the will of my father which is in
[15:33] heaven amen yes
[15:38] it's a very interesting statement
[15:41] we can have all kinds of signs and
[15:42] wonders and miracles
[15:44] all kinds of revelation
[15:47] saints of god if there's a day this is
[15:49] the one of the greatest days of
[15:51] revelation that has ever come in all of
[15:54] history is this day the amount of
[15:55] revelation the amount of understanding
[15:58] of the true word of god amen is given to
[16:01] you america yes
[16:04] because the bible said if they if those
[16:06] leaders and generals or whoever that
[16:09] killed christ in that day would have
[16:11] known that that was him they would have
[16:13] not done it that's right amen because
[16:15] they lack the revelation oh my yes
[16:22] they lack the revelation
[16:26] in john 8 and 28 it says then said
[16:29] jesus unto them
[16:31] when ye have
[16:32] lifted up the son of man then shall you
[16:34] know that i am he and that i do
[16:37] i do nothing of myself
[16:40] but as my father hath taught me i speak
[16:42] these things
[16:44] and he said and he that sent me is with
[16:46] me
[16:47] the father hath not left me alone he
[16:49] says for i do always those things that
[16:52] please amen
[16:55] amen amen
[17:02] i kind of think
[17:04] each one of us has a nature
[17:10] brother amen is built a certain way
[17:15] and every time i see brother amen guess
[17:18] what he displays the same kind of person
[17:21] that he is and guess what he acts
[17:23] different than brother austin
[17:25] and when i see brother often i talk with
[17:27] brother austin his mannerisms are
[17:29] exactly the same as brother often come
[17:31] on
[17:36] each one of you are built different yeah
[17:39] yes you all have different gifts yes
[17:43] get different strengths amen different
[17:46] weaknesses
[17:47] yes sir
[17:51] and you all have a different kind of
[17:53] nature one from another yes that's right
[17:56] that's what makes you unique and
[17:58] individual yep
[18:00] yes sir
[18:02] but you know we're not called and not
[18:04] chosen to live the way who we are
[18:08] that's right right
[18:11] amen
[18:14] let me give you an example here
[18:17] of myself
[18:20] you know what i like to do you know what
[18:21] i you know you know what i really like
[18:23] to do it wears me out but you know what
[18:24] i like to do i like to help
[18:26] people
[18:28] i don't know why
[18:33] it's exhausting
[18:34] right right
[18:38] but when i help someone in anything that
[18:40] i can do when i help them
[18:43] i feel good about that
[18:45] that's right that i was able to do
[18:48] something special or do something that
[18:51] no one else could do for them at maybe
[18:53] that particular time
[18:54] or in a certain area that they needed
[18:56] help
[19:00] but that is how i'm built
[19:03] right and it's it's time now for us to
[19:06] get beyond how we are
[19:08] built because what are we supposed to
[19:11] have
[19:12] we are supposed to have the nature of
[19:14] jesus christ that's right
[19:17] amen and you know what has been taught
[19:20] through many many churches through all
[19:22] over the world as jesus christ is a
[19:24] loving god
[19:26] that's right
[19:27] and he's like oh oh
[19:29] dear sister oh you can do whatever you
[19:31] want and still go to heaven
[19:33] and you can do this and you can do that
[19:36] you know do whatever you want as maybe
[19:38] like the pope would say in 2000 but just
[19:40] get that article he says
[19:42] anyone living a just life will be saved
[19:45] whether they know jesus christ or not
[19:50] so they make out who this jesus is
[19:53] as just some guy who's just as easy and
[19:57] carefree and easy to go and it just does
[19:59] whatever you know and just it's okay and
[20:02] how he just
[20:03] he'll look at my sin and just oh just
[20:05] made me do a giggle and that poor boy
[20:06] you know he just doesn't he just doesn't
[20:08] get it yet
[20:15] what is the nature of god
[20:20] before the sacrifice of jesus christ
[20:22] came the nature of god was
[20:25] you sin you died
[20:27] that's right right
[20:29] that sounds like a very
[20:32] very hard man
[20:35] but now
[20:37] that the sacrifice that he sent his son
[20:39] and now that blood is upon the earth
[20:44] now
[20:45] now that the now that we're watching
[20:47] this we're in a dispensation of grace
[20:50] yes if this was an old testament law i
[20:52] wouldn't be standing right here because
[20:53] i was disappearing to my parents
[20:56] i probably wouldn't stone
[20:58] right
[20:59] right
[21:02] but because we're in a dispensation of
[21:03] grace and we're gentiles god gave us a
[21:06] little something special and it's like
[21:07] this other gentiles can do whatever they
[21:09] want and the judgments of god hardly
[21:11] ever strike them
[21:13] many times it does on this side but says
[21:15] the bible says sometimes they don't get
[21:17] it to the other side that's right
[21:19] what a wake-up call there god have mercy
[21:21] thanks to god we want everything under
[21:23] the blood right now
[21:26] yes
[21:26] [Applause]
[21:28] thank about it
[21:29] even though when we fall and falter we
[21:32] do sin god sees nothing but what we've
[21:35] got to still make it right amen amen
[21:37] absolutely because what that holy ghost
[21:39] should be leading and guiding you to
[21:41] make things right amen
[21:44] but the nature of jesus christ was what
[21:48] to do only
[21:50] solely
[21:52] what the spirit what his father that was
[21:54] in him was leading him to do
[21:59] amen
[22:03] jesus was a man a one man
[22:05] and he had a ministry one to come to
[22:07] earth
[22:09] he was the greatest man he was the only
[22:12] man perfect
[22:13] he's the only one that packed that power
[22:16] in authority like he did
[22:18] amen
[22:20] what if jesus getting baptized filling
[22:23] the holy ghost in his own flesh
[22:26] i'm taking this baby worldwide
[22:28] starts traveling to rome start traveling
[22:30] uh uh uk travel up to to russia this is
[22:33] this no he didn't unity he didn't do
[22:34] that
[22:35] he knew his office he knew his
[22:39] commission for his life
[22:41] and his commission was what to the lost
[22:43] sheep of the house of israel
[22:45] all right amen amen
[22:49] question did jesus heal every single
[22:51] person
[22:52] in jerusalem and in israel at this day
[22:56] absolutely not
[22:58] he only
[22:59] did what he was supposed to do and he
[23:02] did that by the leading of the holy
[23:04] ghost amen amen amen
[23:07] [Music]
[23:09] yes
[23:11] you're not commissioned to help every
[23:14] single person on the earth
[23:18] all right brother right
[23:19] you're not commissioned to save every
[23:22] single soul
[23:24] on the earth
[23:25] that's right brother right even the ones
[23:27] that are sent to you
[23:31] you'd better make sure
[23:34] who sent them to you
[23:37] yes yes
[23:38] who sent those gibby knights to joshua
[23:41] did god
[23:43] or was it the devil
[23:46] now first of all the devil but the devil
[23:48] had to ask permission
[23:50] because he had to set the type correct
[23:53] so this morning i know it's a little
[23:54] slow here this morning i like to teach
[23:57] the tool needed to do god's will
[24:01] the tool needed
[24:04] to do god's will
[24:06] amen
[24:08] i want to start here
[24:11] now we know we everybody everybody
[24:13] we've been taught over and over we know
[24:16] the story in genesis 3
[24:18] we just got a newcomer coming our
[24:20] assembly here we're doing bible studies
[24:21] with him he just he saw that original
[24:23] sin he's just like
[24:25] what
[24:26] praise god and he's very careful in his
[24:28] mouth he's just like
[24:30] you know i'm just keeping myself then i
[24:31] don't see another thing
[24:34] yeah he doesn't say much he tries to
[24:36] keep his mouth keeps his mouth from
[24:38] saying too much but he's seeing the
[24:40] revelation of it
[24:42] now we know the bible sets everything up
[24:44] god
[24:45] god allowed things in the scripture to
[24:46] take place a certain kind of way and but
[24:49] remember every god has to have a trap
[24:51] okay
[24:52] it's a two-way trap if you look at
[24:54] genesis three and one he says uh now the
[24:56] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[24:58] of the field which the lord god had made
[25:00] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[25:02] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[25:03] the garden right so here the serpent
[25:06] said he says are you supposed to eat
[25:07] them every tree says aren't we allowed
[25:08] to eat and retreat and what the woman
[25:10] said we may eat of the fruit of the
[25:11] trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[25:12] the tree which is in the midst of the
[25:14] garden god has said ye shall not eat of
[25:16] it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[25:19] so he she gave what the word of god to
[25:21] the serpent right right she pretty much
[25:23] said he says you don't understand he
[25:24] says he said we this tree she says what
[25:26] we're going to die and now notice what
[25:28] is then rebuttal directly after this
[25:30] verse 4 he says and the serpent said
[25:33] unto the woman ye shall not
[25:36] surely die
[25:39] what did the serpent
[25:40] do he added to the word of god that's
[25:44] right amen amen
[25:48] he added to the word of god
[25:51] now let me ask you a question why
[25:53] couldn't he take away from the word of
[25:54] god
[25:57] godhead says trap
[26:00] he could not take away from the word of
[26:02] god because his name was not on the
[26:04] lamb's book of life
[26:07] so the only way that god could bring
[26:09] judgment to the serpent was have him add
[26:11] to the word and therefore him not
[26:14] knowing the scripture
[26:17] revealed what all the way back in
[26:19] revelation 22 says if you add to the
[26:21] word of god he says these plagues should
[26:23] be added to
[26:24] you
[26:25] right right yes
[26:28] why do you think the devil was inside
[26:29] that serpent he could not take away from
[26:32] the word because satan's name was not on
[26:34] the lamb's book of life it had to be
[26:36] what he had all satan could do for
[26:39] judgment was to add to the word
[26:42] and what the judgments of god would then
[26:44] strike him
[26:46] absolutely
[26:47] now now what was uh
[26:49] let me let me let me read a little
[26:53] i want to read you a quote actually i
[26:55] probably misplaced this way down
[26:59] here
[27:10] now notice here i want i want to read a
[27:12] couple quotes here for you guys
[27:15] he says now i'm not trying to build a
[27:18] doctrine upon a dream and that's been
[27:20] green with the with the woman the man
[27:22] with the three three uh edge
[27:25] uh uh club or whatever beating this
[27:27] woman down with this three-edged plug
[27:28] machine which the holy ghost revealed
[27:30] that was the that was the trinity
[27:32] doctrine upon the baptism right
[27:35] he says i'm not trying to build a
[27:36] doctrine upon a dream nor am i trying to
[27:38] vindicate any doctrine i stand by a
[27:41] dream
[27:42] uh he says i stand for by a dream one is
[27:45] to the godhead is all the way from
[27:46] genesis 1 to revelations 22 and 21 he
[27:50] says but the people have been so blinded
[27:52] by unscriptural dogma of the trinity so
[27:55] notice the first thing the first thing
[27:57] that satan did was blind the people by a
[28:00] false doctrine by a false belief by
[28:03] something by a false revelation okay
[28:06] he says but the people have been so
[28:08] blinded by the unscriptural dogma of the
[28:10] traitor that that that dogma is so
[28:12] universally accepted and to try to see a
[28:14] one god head person is all but
[28:16] impossible
[28:18] it's been so
[28:20] pumped into the religious rankings
[28:22] trinity
[28:23] trinity right god in three persons god
[28:26] and three persons and when i say this
[28:29] when you hear something as is brought
[28:31] out to you and it enters into your ears
[28:33] you're you imma you and instantly
[28:34] imagine you start thinking about it
[28:37] and then that word goes into now what
[28:39] your spirit realm and now your spirit
[28:41] around those three inlets start working
[28:43] with it
[28:44] and one of the imagination you start
[28:46] thinking oh
[28:47] it goes three up and down absolutely
[28:48] okay three people one god and that's how
[28:50] they do it by what injecting it what
[28:52] into the natural comes out of a natural
[28:54] mouth into another realm here which
[28:56] travels what by sound and then into what
[28:58] the natural ears and then what into the
[29:00] spiritual that's how it works
[29:02] right he says that people can't see the
[29:04] truth of godhead but find it he says
[29:06] they can't ever see the rest of the
[29:08] truth
[29:12] so once satan gets you deceived by one
[29:15] doctrine
[29:16] and blinds you you'll never go any
[29:19] further
[29:23] until you break down that
[29:24] wall until you break down that doctrine
[29:27] amen
[29:28] he says they can't ever see the rest of
[29:30] the truth because the revelation is
[29:33] jesus christ in his church and in his
[29:35] works in the midst of the church for the
[29:37] seven ages do you get that now i'm sure
[29:39] you understand
[29:42] so if you're if you're a trinitarian and
[29:44] you start reading the book of
[29:45] revelations that's right why is jesus in
[29:48] them churches
[29:49] if the holy ghost was sent back and
[29:51] jesus is in heaven
[29:53] doesn't make any sense
[29:54] because they have a trinity idea a
[29:56] trinity idea a man-made doctrine of
[29:59] trinity right and they think they're
[30:01] separate people but yet they're one in
[30:02] the same amen jesus is what the father
[30:05] he is the son he is the holy ghost
[30:07] absolutely all right we know these
[30:09] things and that's what one of the
[30:10] greatest mysteries to be revealed to us
[30:12] today amen that we don't have to pray to
[30:14] the father separately at noon or however
[30:17] to pray to the son there is sunset and
[30:19] the holy ghost in the morning or how no
[30:21] when you speak to one you speak to one
[30:23] amen
[30:25] right because what we are built in the
[30:27] image of god amen amen amen
[30:31] your pastor with jesse
[30:32] he's a son to who
[30:34] snooki ray
[30:36] he is a father what
[30:38] america
[30:42] and in him is what a ray of light amen
[30:45] the holy ghost hey man absolutely sure
[30:48] right
[30:51] and we are in the image and likeness of
[30:52] god
[30:53] right one person amen absolutely now
[30:58] sorry i had to jump there now uh
[31:01] thinking on those things
[31:03] oh you know i wasn't done reading
[31:05] themselves sort of
[31:08] he's trying to
[31:10] but if you notice here in this quote
[31:11] he's talking about genesis to
[31:13] revelations and there's something about
[31:15] that there's something about those two
[31:16] books right yes
[31:18] notice
[31:20] in this revelation
[31:22] he tells us what the end of the devil is
[31:24] he tells us how he's going to deal with
[31:26] the devil and cast him in the lake of
[31:28] fire glory
[31:29] he reveals the end of the wicked once
[31:31] you follow satan and hate satan hates
[31:33] them
[31:35] and notice what the prophet of god said
[31:37] he says have you ever noticed how satan
[31:39] hates two books of the bible more than
[31:42] all the others
[31:45] why does he hate the book of genesis in
[31:48] the book of revelations is constantly
[31:50] attacked
[31:51] if you go to second peter three it says
[31:53] second peter said they're gonna be
[31:55] willingly ignorant of three things yes
[31:58] he said what the creation which is what
[32:00] in genesis the flood which is the
[32:02] genesis and the coming judgment
[32:05] amen
[32:06] oh both all three of those are genesis
[32:11] praise god
[32:14] he says have you ever noticed how satan
[32:16] hates two books of the bible or the
[32:18] others others all the others
[32:21] through liberal theologians
[32:23] and pseudoscientists how much
[32:25] pseudoscientist is going on right now
[32:27] right brother thanks god
[32:29] if you watch tv
[32:31] you might just call it the lie the light

[32:55] houses who knows what he's got
[32:57] and he's going to steal these documents

[33:01] he's going to steal his diamonds and
[33:02] leave him in his garage
[33:04] really
[33:08] really hey
[33:11] i had to totally disagree with this
[33:13] gentleman
[33:15] i said guys quit watching tv

[33:30] [Applause]
[33:34] that's right amen

[33:38] a drama
[33:40] what is television what is it it's a
[33:42] drama
[33:43] all right brother there's no difference
[33:44] from the news
[33:46] then when i was in the world i watched
[33:48] star wars no difference
[33:52] nothing
[33:53] real about it right man it's a worldwide
[33:58] drama stage
[34:00] yes sir with actors and players getting
[34:03] paid very well that's right brother
[34:05] right benefits
[34:08] they're getting it all what what is what
[34:10] is the whole thing is to deceive
[34:12] everything is what satan is trying to
[34:14] deceive the very elected
[34:17] right
[34:19] and if you get your mind caught up into
[34:21] what's going on over there
[34:23] you're going to miss it
[34:25] yes sir right
[34:27] now why does he hate those he says no
[34:29] notice he says he says the liberal
[34:31] theologian the super scientist is always
[34:33] attacking the book of genesis and the
[34:35] book of revelations
[34:37] millions and millions of years ago this
[34:40] dance flow that i found digging in the
[34:42] backyard
[34:44] no
[34:45] was not millions and millions of years
[34:47] ago right right
[34:50] i still can't figure out why these
[34:52] fossils of shells were on this
[34:53] mountaintop
[34:56] how did that happen
[35:13] do you realize how ridiculous that is
[35:16] they'll write resumes and
[35:18] and lengthy papers
[35:20] these
[35:22] thesis on how those shells got up on
[35:24] that mountain how are these bones get up
[35:27] on that mountain that are that are
[35:28] aquatic but not terrestrial
[35:33] there must have been a cataclysmic
[35:35] change in the environment yes it's
[35:36] called the worldwide flood that's right
[35:39] amen
[35:41] you know all of us were taught that
[35:42] we're in the public school
[35:45] public schoolers no
[35:47] you heard the truth
[35:49] how many was this we were lied to from
[35:51] day one that's right
[35:53] right brother
[35:54] and i'll tell you like this i'll teach
[35:55] that on tomorrow tonight here yes he
[35:58] says through these liberal theologians i
[36:01] just did i just did a study from my
[36:03] sunday school class
[36:04] six months ago and you know what they're
[36:06] teaching
[36:07] what these liberal theologians i'm
[36:08] talking christians
[36:10] and you know how they're teaching they
[36:12] are teaching by the scripture
[36:16] on the greek side
[36:18] using the greek to teach a local flood
[36:23] and they're not even pulling from
[36:24] anything but the greek interpretation of
[36:26] the bible and it proves it's a local
[36:28] flood
[36:32] thanks to god the devil is
[36:34] man
[36:36] right and we
[36:38] are not stopping
[36:39] amen to expose lies
[36:42] jesus so through these liberal
[36:43] theologians the super scientists he's
[36:45] always attacking the book of genesis and
[36:47] the book of revelations now why
[36:50] he says in both of these books we find
[36:53] satan's origin
[36:58] his awful ways and his destruction what
[37:01] was his origin in genesis he was what a
[37:03] fallen angel incarnated into a serpent
[37:06] that's right what is the bible says he
[37:08] says and i'll put evidence between thy
[37:09] seed and her seed and it shall bruise
[37:12] his head amen absolutely all right the
[37:14] judgment of satan was what the god the
[37:17] these seed of seeds would what come and
[37:19] destroy the devil's kingdom take all his
[37:22] power strip and take the keys of death
[37:24] down the grave up with them that's right
[37:27] amen so in genesis god said i'm going to
[37:29] destroy your kingdom i'm going to take
[37:31] all you've got
[37:34] identify you in there
[37:38] what about revelations what does
[37:40] revelations reveal
[37:42] revelations reveals
[37:45] what took place in the new testament
[37:50] revelation reveals what took place in
[37:52] the new testament church
[37:54] how it fell
[37:58] right
[38:00] and you know the revelation about 99
[38:01] percent of pastor's message
[38:04] i can ask two questions
[38:07] we'll see how deep they are
[38:09] see how studied up they are
[38:12] 1963
[38:14] god speaks to the prophet says i'm going
[38:16] to reveal the seven seals go preach the
[38:18] seven seals
[38:21] one by one every night after night god
[38:23] reveals it
[38:25] and i was just teaching and just just
[38:27] just touched this on bible study last
[38:29] friday night
[38:30] two nights two minutes
[38:32] i said what's that a white horse rider
[38:34] and he said that's jesus
[38:36] what are you saying in the book of
[38:38] revelations that white horse rider was
[38:39] given a bow
[38:41] with no heroes
[38:42] and to conquer and to conquer war
[38:45] that was jesus
[38:47] i said no brother
[38:49] that was the antichrist spirit that was
[38:51] the devil himself that's right
[38:54] and he goes what i said i can prove it
[38:56] to you
[38:57] in the new testament so what was the
[38:59] revelation
[39:01] of the first seal
[39:03] that it was the devil riding that horse
[39:07] right right notice he came in white he'd
[39:10] look like a believer that's right
[39:13] he dressed in white
[39:14] full white
[39:16] and he was riding a horse
[39:17] which looks just like revelations 19.
[39:20] that's right brother right amen
[39:22] yes sir
[39:24] and what the prophet god said he said
[39:26] that was that nicolaitan spirit that was
[39:29] that nicholas in words
[39:31] yes
[39:34] so literally
[39:35] you can ask the ministers so who is the
[39:37] white horse
[39:38] right right horse rider oh that's the
[39:40] devil
[39:41] okay and that's the antichrist right
[39:43] they said yep
[39:44] what are his deeds
[39:47] and none of them
[39:49] know
[39:53] their revelation has not grown
[39:57] right any further than knowing that
[40:00] first horse writer was the antichrist
[40:02] spirit bore the devil right right in the
[40:05] first true change their revelation has
[40:07] went no further
[40:08] that's right
[40:10] in 60 years in almost 70 years
[40:17] yes sir that alarm goes yes
[40:19] yes sir
[40:21] is that an alarm
[40:25] and i've asked many many ministers
[40:27] and they don't know even what three
[40:29] deeds are where the three deeds are
[40:31] i don't know i couldn't tell you
[40:34] so literally they cannot
[40:36] they will not
[40:39] be able to discern
[40:41] the spirit within the framework of the
[40:44] church
[40:45] all right right brother
[40:47] that's right they'll not be able
[40:50] to do it yes sir
[40:55] this is alarming
[40:57] absolutely
[40:59] red light flashing
[41:02] he says he he says in both books we find
[41:04] satan's origin his awful ways and his
[41:06] destruction
[41:08] this is why he attacks them now notice
[41:10] in the book of revelations what not only
[41:12] is satan the one that caused the first
[41:14] church age to fall or the or the book of
[41:16] acts to fall to go into ephesus
[41:19] but later in the book of revelations in
[41:21] revelation 12 the bible says what that
[41:22] old serpent the devil
[41:25] it says what he was that serpent in the
[41:27] beginning of ju in the big the beginning
[41:30] yep of the new testament
[41:32] yes absolutely
[41:35] jesus said about the devil he has no
[41:37] pardon me and i have no pardon him the
[41:39] devil would like to prove that different
[41:41] but he cannot so he does all he can to
[41:43] destroy the confidence in the word of
[41:45] god but when the church disbelieves
[41:47] satan and believes the spiritual
[41:49] revelation of the word hallelujah he
[41:52] says the gates of hell cannot protest
[41:54] amen
[41:57] glory but remember there's twins in
[42:01] every revival there's twins right
[42:05] and think about eve
[42:08] eve
[42:10] now
[42:11] brings forth her first child
[42:15] and she still could not understand
[42:18] who that was from
[42:21] but she had what what came out of her a
[42:22] life
[42:24] a life came out of her and she says look
[42:27] this is a god
[42:31] just because it has life in it you've
[42:33] got to test where what kind of life it
[42:36] is
[42:37] that's right
[42:39] yes
[42:40] that's exactly exactly right
[42:42] amen amen now
[42:46] let's continue on here by god's grace
[42:49] might be a little simple study here but
[42:51] i think it's very very important amen
[42:57] in first samuel 28.
[43:01] saul has been rejected now he's been
[43:04] disobedient to the spirit of god
[43:10] and
[43:14] the lord would not talk to him anymore
[43:16] by god's provided way
[43:18] which was through the urem or by dreams
[43:20] or by the prophets god would not even
[43:21] speak to this man
[43:24] in verse 7 that said saul unto his
[43:26] servant seek me a woman that hath a
[43:28] familiar spirit that i may go unto her
[43:29] and inquire
[43:31] of her and his
[43:32] servants said unto him behold there is a
[43:34] woman that had the familiar spirit and
[43:35] endor and saul disguised himself
[43:40] notice he had to disguise himself what
[43:42] because if she would have came into the
[43:44] presence of that woman she would have
[43:46] never been able to do what she had to do
[43:48] in front of him because why it was
[43:50] search and death
[43:51] and he had to disguise himself to get a
[43:54] certain kind of results
[43:55] and now this is what a backslid son of
[43:58] god that's right
[43:59] yes
[44:01] but notice once he started getting into
[44:03] a spirit i'll say like that
[44:05] it was revealed to her that that was
[44:08] saul and she screamed out said you are
[44:12] saw
[44:13] right
[44:14] but she could not have that kind of
[44:16] discernment until she got in a spirit
[44:19] i'll say it like that
[44:21] now for whatever reason she knew however
[44:23] she knew she knew
[44:28] and of course samuel appeared and they
[44:30] had their conversation and this this
[44:32] but his disguise was blown because she
[44:35] was in a spirit or a different channel a
[44:38] different realm and she could pass that
[44:40] physical disguise and see exactly who he
[44:43] was right
[44:47] absolutely
[44:48] now i want you i want to i want to read
[44:50] this here um
[44:52] uh just to
[44:53] uh in second corinthians 11 the bible
[44:56] says he says what to god you should
[44:58] could bear with me a little my father
[44:59] indeed be able to bear with me he says
[45:01] for i'm jealous over you as with the god
[45:03] of jealousy for his spouse you're the
[45:04] one husband so here saint paul is saying
[45:06] he says he says i've worked with you and
[45:08] i've told you the truth he's now if
[45:09] there's someone coming he says it
[45:11] teaches you anything any other thing he
[45:13] says don't believe it right
[45:16] but then here in verse five says for i
[45:18] suppose i
[45:20] was not with uh was not a wit behind the
[45:22] very chiefest uh apostles
[45:25] he says but though i
[45:27] i'd be rude in speech
[45:29] not in knowledge but we have been
[45:31] thoroughly made manifest among you in
[45:32] all things
[45:34] now notice in verse 7
[45:36] have i committed an offense and i'm
[45:38] basing myself that you might be exalted
[45:41] look at a true man of god
[45:45] he says i have never once lifted myself
[45:48] up
[45:50] right
[45:52] and he kept himself so
[45:54] humble and so poor that while he would
[45:57] not even take offering he would at night
[45:59] he would after preaching however he
[46:01] would go and work making tents
[46:03] and he provided for himself
[46:06] and he said what he said why he said i
[46:07] rob churches to help you
[46:12] out i have committed have i committed an
[46:16] offense in a basing myself that you
[46:18] might be exalted
[46:19] because i have preached you the gospel
[46:21] of god freely
[46:23] never even charged never took an
[46:25] offering
[46:27] because i made sure i had absolutely
[46:30] what i came with is what was i left not
[46:32] anymore nothing less
[46:36] he says i rob other church is taking
[46:38] ways to them to do your service and when
[46:40] i was presented with you and wanted i
[46:43] was chargeable to no man
[46:45] he said he lives he did this on purpose
[46:48] yes so if anyone would try and point a
[46:50] finger at him
[46:52] he could say
[46:53] what if i have i ever exalted myself
[46:55] have i ever taken any offering from you
[46:59] right absolutely not because what the
[47:00] devil is going to be watching him
[47:02] absolutely he was the man of god for the
[47:05] hour and he knew it but what the spirit
[47:07] of god led him to live this kind of life
[47:10] amen so horrible and so i was outside of
[47:12] this what is revelation 3
[47:16] he said if you overcome he will
[47:19] allow you to sit with him in his
[47:21] father's throne that's right and the
[47:24] prophet god said that was the greatest
[47:26] compliment
[47:27] ever given to
[47:30] a
[47:31] humble
[47:32] threat
[47:34] amen
[47:38] if it starts out with humility
[47:41] it must end with amen that's right amen
[47:44] amen
[47:45] hallelujah because it will bring forth
[47:48] of its kind amen
[47:50] whatever's within a man will come out
[47:52] absolutely all right hallelujah goodness
[47:57] he says uh
[47:59] he says now why have i done this why he
[48:01] says am i guilty of exalting myself he
[48:03] says all i've done is abandon myself
[48:07] he says as in the verse 10 and then the
[48:08] true the truth of christ and me no man
[48:10] shall stop me of this boasting and the
[48:12] reason of the okay i
[48:14] wherefore because i love you not god
[48:16] knoweth
[48:18] but what i do
[48:21] but what i do that i
[48:23] that i will do
[48:25] in other words the way i live he says is
[48:27] the way i'm going to continue
[48:30] the way god showed me to live the way i
[48:32] want to keep myself just as low he says
[48:34] i will continue to do this
[48:36] what that i may cut off occasion from
[48:39] them that would desire occasion
[48:42] all eyes were on paul
[48:45] a true modified minister of god all eyes
[48:48] were on him
[48:50] signs were his powers and miracles and
[48:51] he had to live a certain kind of life
[48:53] because everyone was watching him and he
[48:55] kept himself
[48:57] homeless amen amen
[49:00] he says that wherein they glory they may
[49:02] be found even as we in other words jesus
[49:04] you're going to point fingers at me
[49:05] jesus live like this
[49:07] live so humble absolutely
[49:09] yes now notice these who are trying to
[49:12] bring occasion
[49:13] for such our false apostles deceitful
[49:16] workers transforming themselves into the
[49:18] apostles of christ and no marvel for
[49:20] satan himself is transformed into the
[49:22] into an angel of light
[49:25] therefore is no great thing if his
[49:26] ministers also be transformed into as
[49:29] the minister of the righteous whose end
[49:30] shall be according to their works or
[49:33] let's just say deeds
[49:35] right sure that's right
[49:40] so what do we really
[49:42] really
[49:42] need i'm going to tell you a story right
[49:45] now
[49:47] and i'm going to tell you how far this
[49:49] is going
[49:50] i'm going to tell you i'm going to tell
[49:52] you the mindset
[49:54] that i've seen in this message just a
[49:56] couple months ago
[49:58] i went and preached at a certain church
[50:03] and of course they
[50:04] went and took me and my wife up to eat
[50:06] afterwards and i don't say this with any
[50:07] anger or any anything
[50:10] but i'm going to tell you i'm trying to
[50:11] tell you what is coming what what the
[50:13] mindset is here amen right
[50:18] and we started talking about
[50:21] the absolute
[50:22] and i said brother
[50:24] the prophet of god said the holy ghost
[50:27] and the bible were the absolutes
[50:30] amen that's right
[50:31] and the holy ghost will get the absolute
[50:34] revelation of the scripture
[50:36] that's right right
[50:37] and this brother disagreed with me which
[50:39] is okay
[50:40] he said brother he said
[50:42] the message is the absolute
[50:44] he said you give you give this another
[50:46] generation
[50:48] all those messages are going to be
[50:50] canonized
[50:51] and put into the bible
[50:56] thanks to god
[50:57] we have between better
[51:00] check our revelation
[51:02] amen
[51:06] saints of god that's
[51:08] attacking what
[51:10] the book of genesis and the book of
[51:11] revelations what does the book of
[51:12] revelation say
[51:14] you cannot add or take away
[51:18] let me say like this
[51:20] what has always
[51:24] and i'm going to touch this tonight what
[51:26] has satan always tried to do
[51:29] make something else or someone the
[51:33] absolute light
[51:36] amen amen
[51:39] now you know i believe this word this
[51:40] message right
[51:42] so listen you read read the search book
[51:44] for the fourth time now not much but
[51:46] for the major i've been but i'm reading
[51:48] it again amen
[51:52] but now there's they have made the
[51:54] message equal to this
[51:57] saints of god
[52:00] this thing has been under attack for so
[52:03] long that's right brother
[52:05] in the dark ages
[52:07] the catholics taught this in latin so
[52:09] you and i could not understand it right
[52:11] that's right
[52:14] and what in 1500 they showed you last a
[52:16] while back they built this saint peter's
[52:18] basilica which is in the form of a snake
[52:20] and in 10 years god brings us to martin
[52:22] luther says that's it i'm done
[52:24] and martin luther calls him the
[52:26] antichrist that's right martin luther
[52:28] says what he said let's start
[52:29] translating this amen
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:50] all you have to do is open up your bible
[52:52] at home and let the words these words in
[52:54] our spirit and life strike into your
[52:56] mind
[52:57] read it to yourselves to what means
[52:59] coming by here amen
[53:03] hallelujah
[53:07] canonize
[53:09] the message
[53:13] and your lovely pastor is just making
[53:15] videos of
[53:16] probably a hundred things wrong that
[53:18] were
[53:19] misquoted that was not correct
[53:25] i love this problem
[53:27] because look
[53:29] look
[53:30] and you know what the phenomenal thing
[53:32] he says well brother he goes
[53:34] how can you if i have the holy ghost you
[53:36] have the holy ghost
[53:37] how come we're disagreeing on this i
[53:39] said he
[53:40] said that's right brother all right
[53:43] how come we are disappearing
[53:50] i said all right brother we both can't
[53:51] be right that's right that's right
[53:55] amen
[54:01] in 70 years
[54:06] they've convinced the people in the
[54:08] truth
[54:10] right right now this isn't all of it
[54:13] oh my goodness
[54:16] that you can add now to it
[54:20] do you see the condition ah lance
[54:24] yes
[54:25] now
[54:26] let's continue on here i want to hit
[54:27] these couple things here don't want to
[54:29] hold me too long now in john 3 and 16
[54:33] yes
[54:35] for god so love the world
[54:39] everybody gets ah that's when i first
[54:41] got saved
[54:43] oh that's what i was that's what my
[54:44] sunday school teacher taught me
[54:47] in this church for that church god so
[54:50] loved the world we see uh uh what's it
[54:53] what's that football guy tim tebow john
[54:55] 3 16.
[54:58] i play football with my shirt off
[55:01] john john 3 16 god loves the world with
[55:04] his flesh being displayed
[55:07] right and god bless him
[55:11] hey if he's not against god if he's not
[55:14] he's for him you might not hey
[55:17] there were disciples following jesus
[55:19] that jesus called into the truth of his
[55:22] day and disciples are traveling in this
[55:24] and they look lo and behold there's a
[55:26] man casting out devils
[55:28] healing is sick raising death
[55:30] the disciples say hey you need to be
[55:31] with us the guy's like no man i'm good
[55:34] i got the lord he said you ain't got the
[55:36] lord
[55:37] lord right here
[55:39] and they went to the lord the lord tell
[55:41] this guy to follow us he says
[55:43] if he's not against me
[55:46] amen amen
[55:48] remember there's an economy of god
[55:50] yes yes sir
[55:52] there is an economy of god
[56:00] who's in this economy of god
[56:02] all right
[56:03] praise be to god he has chosen us to
[56:05] hear this word thank you jesus for god
[56:07] so loved the world that he began his
[56:08] only uh that he gave his only begotten
[56:10] son that whosoever believeth in him we
[56:11] should not perish but everlasting god or
[56:13] everlasting life for god said not his
[56:15] son into the world to condemn the world
[56:17] but that the world through him might be
[56:18] saved
[56:21] and that's where they usually stop now
[56:22] verse 18.
[56:23] he that believeth on him is not
[56:25] condemned he that believeth him not is
[56:26] condemned already because he believeth
[56:28] not in the name of the only begotten son
[56:32] see the danger of possibly ghost baptism
[56:34] that's right right they don't even know
[56:37] that what the name of the only begotten
[56:38] son is to get baptized
[56:40] amen yes right this is the condemnation
[56:44] that light is come into the world and it
[56:47] says and men love darkness rather than
[56:50] light because their deeds were evil
[56:52] notice he says this right before
[56:54] the start of the book of acts church
[56:57] for everyone to do with evil hated the
[56:59] light neither cometh to the light lest
[57:01] his deed should be reproved why doesn't
[57:04] anyone look at these deeds in nicholases
[57:06] right good but he that do it true
[57:12] do it truth it says doeth truth
[57:14] cometh to the light
[57:18] if they see that they're doing wrong
[57:22] they change their ways
[57:24] and they'll come to the light
[57:26] that his deeds may be manifested they
[57:28] are wrought of
[57:30] god things of god we want the truth
[57:32] right amen in john 4 he says what he
[57:35] says god is a spirit that worship him
[57:37] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[57:39] he says and john 17 14 says i have given
[57:42] them thy word and thy word the world and
[57:44] the world has hated them because they
[57:46] were not of the world even as i am not
[57:47] of the world i praise they should just
[57:49] take them from other words they
[57:50] shouldn't as i keep them uh that they uh
[57:53] but that they should keep them from evil
[57:56] they are not of the world even as i am
[57:58] now the world sanctifying through thy
[58:00] truth thy word is truth amen amen
[58:05] he says as thou has sent me into the
[58:06] world even so have i sent them into the
[58:09] world and for their sakes i sang them by
[58:11] myself that they also might be
[58:13] sanctified through the truth saying to
[58:15] god the only way
[58:17] you can fully be free
[58:20] is to know the truth the bible says and
[58:23] the truth will make you free
[58:25] amen amen
[58:29] so what is the greatest what is the one
[58:31] tool we need more than anything else
[58:34] for truth
[58:36] now we have this
[58:39] and we have this
[58:41] we have the word of god
[58:43] and we can die we can go right in the
[58:44] holy place and break down every doctrine
[58:46] every mystery everything all that yes
[58:48] and we can even pray
[58:51] but there's one tool we need coming into
[58:53] this book of acts survival
[58:58] now let me show you here
[59:00] uh this is in
[59:02] i believe this is the introduction to
[59:04] the churches book
[59:06] he says now let me read this to you this
[59:08] is this is part of the reason why
[59:12] they failed in somewhere
[59:14] though this value will concern itself
[59:17] with various major doctrines such as
[59:19] godhead water baptism etc
[59:22] found in revelations chapter one to
[59:23] three its main theme is the setting
[59:25] forth of the detailed study of the seven
[59:27] church ages
[59:29] this is necessary in order to study and
[59:31] understand the rest of the revelation
[59:34] so we don't study the church ages
[59:37] right never gonna understand the rest of
[59:39] the revelation
[59:40] amen and so forth
[59:43] this is necessary in order to study it
[59:45] and understand the book of revelation
[59:46] for out of the ages come the seals
[59:49] and out of the seals come
[59:51] the trumpets and now the trumpets come
[59:52] the viles
[59:54] like the first burst of a roman candle
[59:58] the church ages could come forth the
[1:00:00] mighty initial illumination
[1:00:03] without which there could be no further
[1:00:06] light
[1:00:12] but once the brilliance of the seven
[1:00:14] church ages is given by divine
[1:00:15] revelation light upon light follows amen
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] are we walking in the light hallelujah
[1:00:26] he said what was the first initial
[1:00:27] revelation given to john what these
[1:00:29] seven church ages yes hallelujah but do
[1:00:33] they have have they went into the light
[1:00:35] and studied the initial things of it
[1:00:38] which is revealed by what the seals if
[1:00:42] they went to the church ages and can't
[1:00:43] see what that seal is have they went
[1:00:45] through the church ages
[1:00:47] right
[1:00:48] they have missed
[1:00:50] a turn
[1:00:51] right they have went up so far and said
[1:00:54] we're good
[1:00:56] and the light continues on but they've
[1:00:57] stayed right here
[1:01:00] yes
[1:01:02] because remember saints of god there's
[1:01:03] only two in this war
[1:01:05] the lord jesus christ and the devil
[1:01:08] that's right
[1:01:09] without this last tool you'll never
[1:01:11] catch this
[1:01:14] devil in manifestations
[1:01:17] now notice here what's this tool
[1:01:20] in
[1:01:24] i didn't write this from this stone
[1:01:26] brother graham says let's turn to the
[1:01:27] first book of corinthians chapter 11 and
[1:01:30] he starts reading
[1:01:32] to communion
[1:01:34] scriptures
[1:01:36] right and he gets here now and he says
[1:01:39] now i want to read my text out of the
[1:01:41] 29th verse for he the east and drinketh
[1:01:44] the unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:01:46] body of the lord
[1:01:48] now wait i have read that wrong
[1:01:50] for he that he doesn't drink it unworthy
[1:01:52] not discerning the body of the lord now
[1:01:55] notice he was reading it and he read it
[1:01:56] wrong he says hold on
[1:01:58] i read this wrong
[1:02:00] shall drink unto him self-damnation not
[1:02:02] discerning the body lord he says i have
[1:02:04] wept over this bible
[1:02:06] and it's got some faded places in it
[1:02:09] amen amen
[1:02:11] as he's read as that once he caught this
[1:02:13] revelation
[1:02:14] of communion he started weeping
[1:02:18] because saints of god communion is about
[1:02:21] discerning the body of the lord yes
[1:02:25] hallelujah which is what how you treat
[1:02:28] one another and the prophet of god
[1:02:30] starts weeping
[1:02:33] realizing what's going on in the
[1:02:35] assemblies and the churches with one
[1:02:37] another yes hallelujah
[1:02:41] now the most profound thing he says
[1:02:42] after this directly after this
[1:02:45] now our eternal destination
[1:02:48] he says after reading this scripture our
[1:02:51] eternal destination
[1:02:53] is not altogether determined by what we
[1:02:55] see or we hear
[1:02:58] but it's determined on what we discern
[1:03:01] yes
[1:03:02] we have
[1:03:04] what discernment we have on what we see
[1:03:06] and we hear amen what's this last tool
[1:03:09] really in these things god is
[1:03:10] discernment
[1:03:13] yes what is one of the things in the
[1:03:16] book of acts that sets everything else
[1:03:18] apart
[1:03:20] if you read acts 4 write it to acts
[1:03:22] right at the end of acts 4
[1:03:24] the holy ghost they had 3 000 baptisms
[1:03:26] and a revival starts and everybody's
[1:03:28] caught up in the moment people you're
[1:03:29] receiving the holy ghost and some water
[1:03:32] and everybody's all excited and this and
[1:03:34] that was having a revival look what
[1:03:35] god's done jesus christ has arisen from
[1:03:37] the dead and they get all excited and
[1:03:39] everything
[1:03:40] pumped up
[1:03:42] and then a movement starts which i
[1:03:44] believe was led to the holy ghost
[1:03:46] the bible said that all those who had
[1:03:48] lands plural and houses
[1:03:51] plural more than one house more than one
[1:03:54] land they started selling them
[1:03:56] and they distributed
[1:03:58] all the money around each other and the
[1:04:01] bible says no one was lacking
[1:04:05] that's right
[1:04:06] everybody was
[1:04:08] okay
[1:04:09] everybody had food for tomorrow
[1:04:11] the next day and the next day
[1:04:14] and that was the leadership of the holy
[1:04:16] ghost at that time
[1:04:18] and then a couple in that revival caught
[1:04:22] wind of it
[1:04:23] we got extra hands
[1:04:25] but in their heart
[1:04:28] in their heart
[1:04:31] they went and sold
[1:04:33] their land or however
[1:04:35] and they got all this money and they
[1:04:37] said
[1:04:38] well we're just going to keep half of it
[1:04:40] back or part of it back
[1:04:43] and we're going to bring the rest and
[1:04:44] give it to peter as the other brothers
[1:04:46] have been doing
[1:04:48] that's right and this man
[1:04:51] obviously baptized
[1:04:54] never received the holy ghost had this
[1:04:57] money and he comes before peter
[1:04:59] and because of lack of discernment
[1:05:04] on
[1:05:05] ananias party
[1:05:07] he did not realize he was dealing with a
[1:05:10] man who was just recently filled with
[1:05:12] the holy ghost that's right amen amen
[1:05:16] glory this was an experience that peter
[1:05:18] had 10 years ago 20 years ago it was a
[1:05:20] fresh anointing of god hallelujah
[1:05:23] and peter knew what he was doing
[1:05:26] peter knew he had sold out to christ he
[1:05:28] was no longer scared he was born as a
[1:05:30] lion under the united states
[1:05:34] and peter's sitting there
[1:05:36] and this man comes up
[1:05:38] with all this money
[1:05:40] here's peter this is the money from my
[1:05:41] land
[1:05:43] peter says that's all the money from the
[1:05:45] land the guy's like yeah
[1:05:48] he said you're a liar how are you
[1:05:50] tempting the holy ghost today
[1:05:53] you will go the young man that will
[1:05:54] stand beside you're going to carry out
[1:05:56] right now that's right and he dies right
[1:05:58] there
[1:06:00] notice
[1:06:01] one lack discernment
[1:06:04] and it cost him everything
[1:06:07] one had discernment amen and he kept the
[1:06:10] church pure amen hallelujah
[1:06:14] what if peter was not in the condition
[1:06:17] to catch the discernment of that person
[1:06:20] they would have been a person that would
[1:06:21] have been now remember
[1:06:23] he if he started out with one little lie
[1:06:26] how that would have what what would his
[1:06:28] life been in another year or two years
[1:06:35] yes
[1:06:36] but because peter was able to what bring
[1:06:39] have that discernment glory
[1:06:42] by what oh yeah stay mad
[1:06:45] this he did ananias
[1:06:48] did not change his clothing
[1:06:50] he did not come in with
[1:06:52] any other he just came in like who he
[1:06:54] was right
[1:06:55] right looks like just the rest of guys
[1:06:58] no acting here it was just a single line
[1:07:03] but god was so nervous god was so
[1:07:06] concerned about his bride at that time
[1:07:09] he did not want one now remember
[1:07:12] peter the holy ghost could have left it
[1:07:14] just like that
[1:07:16] i forgive him
[1:07:21] but what is the spirit of god
[1:07:25] god knew his church was just started his
[1:07:27] move was starting and he was not going
[1:07:29] to let anything who taught that man and
[1:07:31] doing that that was the devil
[1:07:33] right
[1:07:34] the devil discerned him
[1:07:36] the devil entered him the name of mine
[1:07:37] does that and the holy ghost kept his
[1:07:40] church clean
[1:07:42] and by that one example
[1:07:44] they put fear into all the rest of
[1:07:47] believers yes yes
[1:07:52] saints of god we have to come to a point
[1:07:54] where we have some discernment oh yeah
[1:07:57] experience hallelujah what was more
[1:07:59] deceiving the gibby knights or analyzes
[1:08:01] the fire
[1:08:04] ananias and spyro
[1:08:06] they didn't change anything they just
[1:08:23] to represent christ his obligations he
[1:08:26] must meet those obligations
[1:08:28] but keep him in prayer he's going into
[1:08:30] work now
[1:08:32] everyone knows likes what works like the
[1:08:34] kind of people that work at work
[1:08:46] right now is the time
[1:08:48] really
[1:08:49] i'm being i'm teaching this because of
[1:08:52] my
[1:08:55] lack i was lacking discernment at a time
[1:09:00] and it will cost you
[1:09:02] tremendously
[1:09:05] and the story was good
[1:09:08] the actions were good
[1:09:10] it was all planned out
[1:09:14] but my nature is
[1:09:16] sure i'll help you
[1:09:18] i'll help you
[1:09:20] but god's nature is to help and take
[1:09:23] care of his own
[1:09:26] now god is good the bible says god is
[1:09:28] good to the evil
[1:09:30] and to the just he's good to both
[1:09:34] and now i have to choose i've picked
[1:09:36] something here
[1:09:39] i texted him
[1:09:41] this gentleman i said i forgive you
[1:09:43] and i said
[1:09:44] you've gotta repent
[1:09:46] you gotta
[1:09:47] get saved
[1:09:48] answer back then that's right
[1:09:50] unless the lord
[1:09:52] let him know
[1:09:54] now remember
[1:09:55] brother graham talked to told a story
[1:09:58] there's a couple
[1:09:59] there's a couple ministers who
[1:10:01] bought some land
[1:10:03] and
[1:10:04] they went into court because they were
[1:10:05] some people were trying to take it
[1:10:07] and they had religious reasons to keep
[1:10:09] this land
[1:10:10] and they went up a great against the
[1:10:12] great attorney general
[1:10:13] and the great attorney general tore
[1:10:15] these boys up as ministers
[1:10:18] in fact they lost the case
[1:10:20] because
[1:10:21] this guy was so smooth with his words
[1:10:24] so eloquent so good and pinpointed this
[1:10:28] fall and that fault this this and those
[1:10:29] ministers lost that land
[1:10:32] and bro graham says he says picking up
[1:10:34] he says he said if that attorney general
[1:10:37] would have known would have discerned
[1:10:39] who he was talking to
[1:10:41] because he was just months later that
[1:10:43] same attorney general was in a plane
[1:10:45] crash
[1:10:46] into a water and he was drowning and
[1:10:48] dying and immigrants said he was i bet
[1:10:50] you wish he would have had discernment
[1:10:51] yeah
[1:10:53] right absolutely
[1:10:55] now that gentleman that took me for a
[1:10:57] ride there
[1:10:59] he did not know he was
[1:11:01] deceiving the son of god here
[1:11:03] that's right
[1:11:06] that's a scary thing but the main thing
[1:11:08] what i'm trying to say is
[1:11:10] that trick of the devil is coming in
[1:11:12] religious form
[1:11:15] you know what brother can't preach that
[1:11:16] wednesday night
[1:11:17] judas
[1:11:19] preached honestly that's right that's
[1:11:21] right because i told my wife i didn't
[1:11:22] talk about it
[1:11:24] i told my wife i said i want to see what
[1:11:26] i can't preach about tomorrow night and
[1:11:28] out of nowhere he comes and preaches
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] judas and the betrayal which is what a
[1:11:33] set up
[1:11:34] the bible says what
[1:11:36] judas from that time on look for
[1:11:38] convenience to betray him to sell him
[1:11:41] out that's right to deceive
[1:11:44] thanks god we're coming to it this is
[1:11:45] really it's just
[1:11:47] the lord's showing me here just in my
[1:11:48] life i need that holy ghost
[1:11:51] wisdom
[1:11:52] yes
[1:11:55] and the guy played the part
[1:11:57] and it was he was a natural he's very
[1:11:59] good
[1:12:03] so now when this message
[1:12:05] be careful you listen to yes
[1:12:10] what do they say when they say that we
[1:12:11] got the word what do they mean
[1:12:13] that's right
[1:12:17] because what they mean and what they say
[1:12:19] is two different things
[1:12:27] dearly father lord jesus lord we
[1:12:29] certainly love you
[1:12:30] although god may be a sobering little
[1:12:32] study here god

[1:12:36] certainly

[1:12:56] the revelation here of these deeds lord
[1:12:58] which few can even see god

[1:13:04] actions god
[1:13:06] i say that's not scripture
[1:13:09] but lord we gotta come up higher now
[1:13:10] lord to someone who looks like they're
[1:13:12] doing the will of god that has no our
[1:13:15] deeds look bad
[1:13:17] our lord's got to come down to
[1:13:18] discerning of the spirit
[1:13:22] and lord jesus lord we know the next
[1:13:24] step the next light we must come into
[1:13:26] god

[1:16:03] i've caught other lies people trying to
[1:16:05] deceive me i've caught other lies
[1:16:09] i'll be honest i i was dealing with a
[1:16:11] gentleman and he kept telling me to come
[1:16:13] over to his house come on his house for
[1:16:15] bible study i said are you working he's
[1:16:16] like no i said you come to church

[1:16:41] and they're his neighbor
[1:16:45] and they know
[1:16:46] this is him and his family they said
[1:16:48] simon
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] because there was that
[1:16:54] much there was that much evil going off
[1:16:59] that house
[1:17:00] that's right they looked at my face both
[1:17:01] the brothers i talked to them separately
[1:17:03] they would have done something to me he
[1:17:05] would have done something him and his
[1:17:06] mom
[1:17:07] would have done something to it
[1:17:11] but before i went to that house i didn't
[1:17:13] go but before i said lord i was just
[1:17:15] ready to go listen lord
