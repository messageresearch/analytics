========================================

I'd like to continue to minister on praise Jesus's name and the dance here tonight I'd like to go a little bit further as I told you last Wednesday I didn't get the chance to finish all the the texts on Dancing so I like to continue on that we'll just see where the Lord directs us here tonight by his grace as you turning there to Psalms 149 verse 3 uh just want to remind you the schedule you know Lord willing Saturday night we'll try to keep it a short two-hour service I'll really try to do that because we have two services on Sunday I want to get back to the two services on Sunday you know we kind of we lost that service last you know Friday because of the weather and so I kind of want to get back to that by God's grace and um and I'd like to say this for Saturday if you can let's make it a song and testimony service on Saturday night it's our New Year's Eve service so bring a testimony might be interesting too if you go back on YouTube you can listen to last year's testimonies New Year service and kind of see what you said or see what we sang and just kind of reflect on the year I've been doing that I've been I've been making a list of all the testimonies from each month you know I don't have a testimony for every month but I've got like eight or nine testimonies from this year and I think I'll share some of those you know just remind us of some of the testimonies God's done and uh and you know we didn't get to do our dance service really on Christmas because it was just a strange day you know it's been a strange strange moment but we're willing maybe we could do that Saturday too by God's grace and just so you know brother Simon will be coming January 15th he'll preach both services for us I'm going to reschedule with brother Matt Leitner by God's grace but we have brother Simon coming January 15th and I believe that's it I asked brother Brian Hawkins to come in March again so he hasn't got back to me but I asked brother and Brian to come and March so that's the update there on the events by God's grace okay so let's go to our text here we'll go to Psalm 149 verse 3. all right let's read this if we can on three ready one two three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and heart may God bless his word tonight you may be seated praise God so I have some quotes I'd like to share and um you know we'll just kind of see how it's seven o'clock okay so I'll try to preach an hour we'll kind of see how that goes sure brother yeah yeah um let's see uh but amen we didn't crack that window there buddy by God's grace so you got to pull up the blind there yes I and then there's a lock on the right side the window so there's you got to unlock it yeah um I'll do it thank you yes sir so we're looking at part four here and we'll kind of pick up where we left off last Wednesday you know I've gotten numerous emails and um you know comments on YouTube how this this Series has been a blessing to people you know some people have said it the series has helped renew their worship with the Lord and so hopefully it's helped you as well by God's grace I know it's brought a lot of Liberty and freedom to me and you know to see the children dance and all of us dance together I know it's been a real blessing for me uh and I know there's a time and season for everything praise God so just rejoice in that and um so I'm very thankful for what God is doing praise God oh yeah and I had Brother Ray come up uh last Wednesday night after everybody left you know he stayed tell me some testimonies he left and then he come back and he said he just said the Holy Spirit told me brother Jesse to come tell you you're preaching exactly what he wants he said because these children get to rejoice in the presence of the Lord he said I just want to tell you he said I was in my car and the voice of the Lord said go tell brother Jesse he's preaching the right thing so I said well thank you I felt like that but it's nice to have a confirmation uh he said the children he said the children need to learn how to praise the Lord and uh and he said just as a second testimony with the voice he said he heard he said he was just talking to somebody of that I think the Sunday before about the freedom to worship and the dancing and the shouting and the praising of God and I said well praise God that's just another confirmation to me praise God the Bible says you study and I always point to the study room you know the Bible says you study yourself approved unto God so you've got to study long enough until you feel like God has given you that message right and then you go preach to the people like I was talking about amen last week you know there's some Services that's just hard they start out hard but then you get right into the prince of the Lord you know but you just got to push through as a minister you got to just push through sometimes you start off and man everybody's in one Accord and you just start real awesome and then it kind of Fades off to the end maybe I wear the people out or something um but you never know how it's going to go so what we must do is just be faithful we just got to be faithful the Bible said a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and so you know we just rejoice in what God has done and of course what God is doing and we're so grateful for God's love and his Mercy praise God you want to make sure I got a few thoughts there okay all right so you know with this series we just want to remember that what we're doing is we're yielding our body to Jesus you know I think I think the uh the the battle many times is you know we we think we only have to yield the soul to Jesus you know we just got to get born again you know and uh then no matter what happens after that you know we're okay which that's true in one sense but uh if if that's if that's our attitude then we're only getting victory in one third of the battle praise God but the battle is three fronts praise God right it's it's Soul spirit and body praise God and so we want to have victory in all three Realms praise God I don't know about you but I don't want my body to get such sicknesses that my body can't praise the Lord I want to keep my I want to keep my body healthy by God's grace right I want to keep it healthy so that my body can praise the Lord right I don't want to get so sick and and weak and tired that uh mistreat my body like the like the brother James told me brother James Browning he said my only regret is that I didn't eat healthy all those years he said because now I got heart trouble and I didn't exercise and I didn't take care of myself and so I said well ever ever since I heard that I said that and it's going to encourage me to keep working out because I want to serve God as long as I possibly can until the Rapture praise God or until I go to the Grave my body goes there but my soul goes to heaven praise God and so I want to yield all three parts I don't want to give God 33 percent of me I want to give God 100 of me praise God Hallelujah by God's grace I'll do that you will too by God's grace we've got to learn to do that and so the Bible you know makes it plain you know what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own this is a great verse to remind us ourselves our body doesn't even belong to us you know the world tells you it's your body your choice like that's the women right they can have abortions because it's your body your choice it's not your body is God's he he purchased our bodies with his own blood praise God the blood of God and so we have to remember our body is a church building and I know about I'm pretty sure you would agree if God has a church building he wants it full of Praise Hallelujah he don't want it full of you know depression and he don't want it full of anger and wrath and he don't want it full of that God wants his house full of worship praise God he doesn't want a silent church he wants a church that is ready to give God praise amen I'm going to prove it to you tonight praise God it's in the Psalms that the Bible said we should praise God from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same amen amen God deserves praise all the time Hallelujah from the time you wake up to the time you lay your head he deserves all the praise hallelujah amen he's reminding us what don't you know don't you remember that your body is a temple the Holy Ghost you are bought with a price a heavy price was paid to buy your body Hallelujah therefore because such a high price was paid glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods now think of this church I paid a heavy price for my van out there I knew it when I was going into it I paid a heavy price so that's why I take care of it right Hallelujah like I think nature asked me last time why do you keep these mats there and I'm like well if there's any permanent spill I can keep off those carpets I'm going to keep it off there because I want this thing to last forever well not forever but as long as I can at least all the kids are moved out or whatever happens you know actually I can load grandkids in there by God's grace but a heavy price was paid for so I take care of it now that's just the natural if that's a natural what about the spiritual praise God if Jesus is blood and he died to to purchase my body it was such a heavy price how much how much greater is that there for therefore I'm gonna take care of my body and therefore I'm gonna take care of my mind praise God I'm going to make sure I meditate on the right things and not the wrong things I'm going to make sure I take care of my body praise God that I have Temperance of the Holy Ghost I get up there amen amen I'm not going to give in the fleshly all the fleshly passions praise God right I don't have to be a legalist or I could have sugar every now and then but sugar is going to cause cancer too much sugar is going to cause cancer praise God we should know that right and we should take care of our body right make your heart strong unless you're going to have heart disease right you gotta exercise you got to take care of your heart praise God but we should glorify God whatever brings God glory we should do it in our body and our spirit and of course our soul which is God's Hallelujah and remember this verse of course of course again it's just a beautiful reminder you'd your body mind and soul to Holiness not to unrighteousness Hallelujah I'm going to skip down here for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity to iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness okay so you know when I was a sinner I would go from from cigarette pack to cigarette pack or from uh it may be hard to imagine now you know but or from chewing tobacco 10 to the next 10. I go from 10 to 10. right I've got to have a fresh anointing each time I've got to have a fresh taste each day that's how it is with God I gotta have a fresh rejoicing with Jesus every single day praise God I'm yielding my body to that I'm uniting my mind to that I need a fresh experience every day praise God see we're uniting that I've gotta in other words I had to make time to go buy the tin I had to make time to to chew it I had to make time to do that I've got to make time to spend with Jesus amen amen I've got to make time to be in the presence of God I've got to make time to do that because my Tempo needs to be worshipful praise God I don't want a quiet church right and the church said I said like this we don't want this quiet Church right natural but also the physical too we don't want our bodies to not give God praise we want our bodies to sing the Praises amen we want the world to know that this house is a house of Praise hallelujah thank God it's let's give God his his right his his right away praise God let's give God the option to to sing praises to us let's yield to God and let God work in us the way he wants to work in US amen Hallelujah no I want to remind us also that brother Brandon says use your intellect right like there's a move in the tape Church movement there's a and I don't want to go deep in that but there's a move in there where the the Pastor said just relax and don't think of anything you can just say Amen to every word that's opening themselves up to Demons intellectual demons right Demons of idolatry the Bible never taught us that the Bible said prove all things and so the prophet said the same thing amen hallelujah but we come here we got to use our mind right but then it also you know if we get our mind right then the joy and the Victory sure flow out to our bodies Hallelujah right we can just open up those five channels just open them up praise God right you know you want you want the channel like like of water right water we didn't have water the channel of water was closed up on Sunday so we had to go to my house because the channels were open right yeah and you want your channels flowing with God's spirit praise God glory amen you want your channels open oh my what a type a Frozen a Frozen channels I mean what a beautiful there's a stiff cold Icy starchy he said a church service where their chat where the temperature is spiritually below zero and there's no shouting there's no rejoicing there's no happiness there's no gladness there's no fire but we should have fire in our lives we should have channels open the fire should be burning amen God should be producing heat in our lives and and and and and burn up anything that's frozen unthought praise God so the Tails can flow the waters can flow Living Waters can flow praise God ah hallelujah amen open up those channels praise God where we can have like we said testimonies where if people come in here discouraged they can be encouraged by the time they leave and it don't have to be the pastor all the time it can be one of you praise God as you know right each one of us must be open to the leading of the Holy Spirit praise God flowing through our intellect because remember we don't want to give any of these places brother Chris these are all rooms in your mind there's a room in your mind called the conscience there's one called the memory your reason your affection your imagination and if we're not careful we'll give Satan like here here's like let's say I hold this evil memory against brother Chris or hold a memory against that that sister or that brother see we can't do that we can't give any place to the devil right we're all going to have struggles we're all going to battle but the best part is we can cast all of our cares on the Lord my wife get honey what's that good meme you told me worrying is talking to yourself about your problems but praying is talking to God with your problems something like that go ahead and say it for us try your best yes amen so worry is a conversation you have with yourself but you can take those same words and talk them to Jesus and that is not word anymore it's Lord I gotta I gotta talk with you praise God the Bible said commune with your heart to the Lord amen hallelujah thank you honey I appreciate that sweetie thanks for being on the spot I knew you remember because you got a good memory you're really yeah that's really you gotta you give your place to the Lord there amen hallelujah my memory's not so great it's probably because I don't sleep enough but anyways uh you know we don't want to yield any of these places to Satan but if there's a stronghold the Bible says we have weapons to tear it down praise God ah each one of us need those weapons amen the weapons of the word amen we're all going to have strongholds we're all going to have problems we're all gonna have mind battles it's just it's just part of living but we all have access to Greater Powers we all have access to a greater stronghold a greater Fortress A Mighty Fortress Is Our God Amen if I can quote Martin Luther there praise God the fifth Church Ace messenger Hallelujah A Mighty Fortress Is Our God in other words God's got a bigger Tower than that one so God's kingdom Reigns God's kingdom rules Hallelujah Glory now somebody says review but remember so affections brother Chris is your emotions right the Bible said if you're risen with Christ seek those things which are above now it's a balance right because we have to seek things here I gotta have food shelter clothing out of all these things but while we're doing that our affection should be on Heaven Lord I just got to have this this is only temporary I just need this for a little while but my main point is to glorify you in what I need and the money and everything the main thing is I want to glorify you while I'm on this Earth praise God so if your resume is with Christ seek those things where Christ sits on the right hand of God set your affection on things above set your emotions right now that's anger too Church set your anger on the devil that's in heaven right right the Bible says that Bob said you can have a spirit of Revenge if you fall in sin you repent and then you have Revenge I'm not going back to that again when the enemy comes I'm turning him down amen you can be angry and said not Hallelujah right set your affection it's okay all those emotions God wants you have all those emotions but when it's directed the right way it'll always glorify God it'll make you more than a conqueror praise God in Christ Jesus so you don't set your emotions on uh you know you know temporary things you know uh you know we we must not set our emotions on things that are temporary like we know these things are going to pass away so they should not have the most emotion in our hearts and Minds like our jobs right or like like any temporary thing we should not get too emotionally attached because we found with job sometimes God just takes him away and I've always prayed that prayer Lord let me have job Faith so no matter what happens I can say the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord now God forbid we'd have to go through what job would went through as a as a man of God that he went through who was tested to the utmost but I loved how he still had his affection on things above he was still able to acknowledge God and give him praise Hallelujah for you are dead how many dead tonight and your life is in with Christ in God Amen where's your life it's in Christ which is in God Amen so God is my life other than my life is done I don't live for Jesse Smith I live for Jesus Christ amen my life is in Christ and that life is in God hallelujah it all goes back Amen to God I just want to read this here see a road is built a good road is built the highest part is in the center and I've read this so if you maybe last year because it lets all the trash wash off both sides that's it when a man really comes to Christ he's got his eyes centered on Christ if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a little cold he'll get on the other side and just be a cucumber over on that side right now we can all think of people who they when they're right when they get saved they're either too emotional or too cold now Church those of us who are experienced shouldn't be either one those of us who are experienced should be right in the middle of the road Hallelujah because we ain't babies anymore we're not just brother Branham calls them fresh recruits we're not fresh recruits we've been serving God a while now praise God oh amen right Hallelujah I'm not just some fresh recruit I've been serving God for 20 some years now 20 almost 23 years now Hallelujah I'm not I mean someone who's been in the military 23 years they're not a they're not a brand new person in there saying stay in that boot camp anymore they're they're in position uh thank God Amen thank God we can be in possession Hallelujah now be careful you don't want to sit there like a cucumber during service I don't want to preach like a cucumber we don't want cucumber preachers we want Eagle preachers right we don't or whatever you would say whatever you call a firecracker preacher that's what Barbara said Peter was a Firebrand amen hallelujah thank God Amen we don't want a cucumber preacher see the main thing is right in the middle of the road I'm sorry yeah yeah the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you keep you warm and moving on amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit see knowing knowing enough see to move just as the spirit moves I'm so glad I moved in the channel of this dance series because people have been blessed Hallelujah and that God's given us some indication it was the right direction praise God see just under just obey the Lord obey the Lord every day obey the Lord and God will move you in the right channels Hallelujah not till or not after but just as the spirit moves and now look what the church has done it's got off on a bunch of fanaticism and went either went real starchy and stiff and take none of it but brother there's a middle of the road where the true real true gospel is preached and the real true Bible signs and wonders following a Sweet Holy Spirit that leads the church that's the kind of a church to go to an intellectual Church preaching the word standing on the word with a real Full Gospel sermon real spirit of God everything in the spirit everything is decent everybody in order everything in love that's the kind of church we want how many wants to belong to that kind of church raise your hands why sure we all do well God wants us to what made the difference we just started getting a little arrogant and different in our churches and the dove flew away now Church most churches are on the stiff and starches I think of Luther think of Baptist think of Presbyterian right Catholic we went to Catholic church with brother William two years ago or last year I mean most churches are on this stiff cold side stiff and starchy just sit up or kneel down to Catholic at least the Catholics kneel down some Churches don't even kneel right at least they kneel now of course their way off the word but we don't want to be stiff and starchy and can't be moved by the Holy Spirit but we don't want to be it's all emotion if I don't sing or if I don't shout or if somebody doesn't cry somebody doesn't scream we didn't have church I want to be right in the middle of the road praise God I don't want to be a cucumber but I don't want to be a distraction praise God Hallelujah as far as I know there's very few distractions in our church just so you know in other words most people aren't on that fanatical side we've had some before right where the people shout too loud or shout too much right we've had some like that over the years just a couple you have some of that where it seems like the person is drawing attention to themselves rather than giving the glory to Christ right and of course we know later because by their fruits there are known right eventually they leave the word of God right see the what happens is when we become cucumbers we let the dove fly away rather than say Lord keep me sweet keep my life sweet with you help me to have a balance of love and and understanding and wisdom and a decent uh a real Bible sermon give me the real Bible signs wonders and miracles praise God oh it's beautiful now brother Brown says now we've got to have order but what he means here when he says got out of order you got to get out of the Cucumber state Hallelujah if you want to get saved you got to stop being a cucumber and what's a what's a food that would hop around uh jalapeno because they're so hot maybe I know it makes some people real real hot makes all of us right what kind of I guess I have to be a food on a stove or something like that but romance saying you got to get out of just the routine of setting up going to church setting up going to church and sit down and go to church and shut up go to church you got to get out of that and you got to get out of that long enough just to get saved praise God that's right good yes I like that five corn jumps all over right when it gets hot enough amen don't worry I like that brother the thing was not how now this is the woman that washed Jesus feet remember she had to push through the crowd right remember he said was not how she was going to get there was she gone to make an effort to get there I can see her elbowing her way through the crowd no matter what said or who said she was on a road to meet Jesus do you do that how many did that tonight where things come up yet you still press your way to the house of God see would you elbow your way through the differences in the world today could you elbow your way over the vulgarity over the picture shows and the dancing and carrying on that that they do calling yourself a Christian to get to Jesus could you lay aside all your worldly social entertainment on social media how about that cell phones to come to the Lord Jesus to be entertained by him God have mercy she elbowed right on through she was going to get there regardless of how vile she was in their eyes see it wasn't vowed to God it was vile to the religious people and let our testimony be that we'll always be vile to Catholics and lutherans and Baptists let me always be vile to them but I know it'll be pleasing in the sight of my Lord praise God Let My Worship always be worshiped where the Lord is pleased where the Lord is glorified people would call me a fanatic let them cucumbers call me a fanatic I'm popcorn amen fresh popcorn not sailbob going fresh popcorn Hallelujah I just been popping off revelation after Revelation Joy after Joy Victory after Victory blessing after a blessing she was going to get there regardless of how vile she was oh I know it was out of order oh sure God help us to get out of order once in a while the trouble is you got too much order get out of order I hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved I love this I love this quote praise God see that woman had to press through just to wash his feet just to hear him save your sins are forgiven Hallelujah amen glory and so see if you feel like Satan's condemning you of sins and you feel condemned you've got to press through until you can feel Jesus say you're forgiven amen amen hallelujah tonight I'm talking about you got to pray longer you got to sing longer do something until you stop feeling that way and you feel different because I promise you when you get to Jesus he'll touch you you'll feel different praise God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost don't let you remain in condemnation he come to set you free from condemnation he don't want to remain a victim he was going to be a Victor amen hallelujah he don't want you to be like a liability he wants you to be an asset praise God Hallelujah he wants you you don't you don't want to be the weakness in the church he wants you to be the strong in the church praise God a church is only as strong as his weakest link Joshua found that out with Aiken our church is only as strong as our weakest Christian now I'll say like this we're all week sometimes but while we're here let's let's album our way to Jesus let's get out of order if we got to get ordered get out of your cucumber and get into some popcorn Sage amen Glory we all got to do it like I told you when guest ministers come in that's usually when I'm struggling and that's usually when I got to come up for prayer but I got to recognize I can push through the I can push through the condemnation I can get to Jesus I just got to Elbow my way through or I got to pray through until I can get some victory praise God same thing we all got to do why would you stay the same let's not leave your Works off let's leave her better off I hope bride of Christ Fellowship gets out of order long enough to get saved thank God if you've been saved Hallelujah now let's get out of order long enough so we can have revivals Hallelujah yes sir amen I love this program continues I remember when Jesus saved me oh my God I never forget it and the church said this little old Kentucky Heart of Mine this little old Ohio heart of mine was jumping 90 miles an hour I wept I cried I shouted I don't care who was standing around I wasn't paying attention to order I was in the prayers of Jesus and I love him praise God see when you get out of the Cucumber stage you don't care who's sitting around all you care is that Jesus is here the Great Master Chef is here the great Creator is here the one who purchased me is here I care what he thinks about me praise God he's the only one that can help me anyway praise God Hallelujah you're not here for your neighbor you're here for Jesus praise God oh hallelujah thank God Amen see Church those are special moments when your heart's beating that hard and you know the prince of the Lord is there you cry You Weep you give God glory you never forget it Hallelujah when you're in God's presence you never forget it oh Hallelujah remember Brothers said he want God wants to fill every fiber of your being so that includes your body right plus to the top of your head to the soles of your feet now he's talking about going on a three days meeting and uh he was preaching in his little church Jeffersonville teaching about the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues signs and wonders to follow the Believers and so forth of the people that's around in there I believe in all the spiritual gifts how many believe that I believe in all the Bible I'm Pentecost from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet inside outside all around through I'm Pentecostal yes sir they say you're a Baptist you said I'm a Pentecostal Baptist Hallelujah I'm a Baptist they got the Pentecostal blessing so I'm I love the Lord Jesus amen thank God amen glory I love that quote what is it you've got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking and he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God to his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life my words are life said Jesus he's placed with them teachers believe in the Bible prophets that say the truth that say show the same prophecy that they've always did down through the age what's he done he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word his word the kingdom of God is God's word made Power Church like I tell these guys struggle with pornography I said quote the word of God to the devil and say I'm not doing it and you watch the word of God will back up Satan Hallelujah you can't quote the word and then not have it active if you're quoting like that you don't even believe it but the word has power in any situation just quote the word believe it stand behind the word and you watch the word it'll drive back Satan Hallelujah Hallelujah like I told those guys I said some of those guys said you stare in that mirror and you tell and you preach it to yourself say I you like even science knows it you you can't look at yours you can't say like I'm not a healthy person if you want to become healthy even science says you got to say you have to you have to be identified with what you want to be like it they say if you want to overcome cigarettes you got to say well I'm not a cigarette smoker and that will help you overcome cigarettes you have to change your identity and if anybody ever changed your identity it was Jesus Hallelujah because you're you're dead your life is dead right your old life is dead but now you're alive in Christ you have a new identity you are not your own you're born with a price you belong to God Amen like if you have trouble exercising you got to have the mindset well I'm a healthy person that's why I gotta go exercise when you've changed your identity then it's easier to do what those type of people do because that's your identity so then you say well I'm a holy ghost he'll say I'm a worshiper amen I am meant to worship God I'm not a cucumber praise God let's keep going back to cucumber praise God I'm not a cucumber I'm not an icicle praise God I'm a Firebrand I'm a pop and popcorn amen I'm a Child of God I'm in Acts 2 38 tongue-speaking young and praise God I'm the only speak in English but I'm speaking the holy spirit's words amen amen God Amen oh it's beautiful gotta change your identity always when the power of God comes in the walls that you build around you fall remember that isolation sermon sometimes we let Satan build us in we isolate ourselves when the power of God comes it breaks down those walls of isolation it's no longer just me and myself and my pity party and the devil right because he's the one who's giving you the pity party the holy and the power of God comes in he breaks down the Walls brother Adam said that you built around you that you built in your mind how can I go on how in the world could I ever make it how could I be made well how could I ever get Revival right all these things we build up I can never have peace with this person I can never be friends again with that person I can never face that person you built your own walls but when the power of God comes in he breaks down the Walls amen I say like this is better than Domino's it's easier than dominoes for God to break down you think dominoes are easy I think I mean you think that my God can do greater than that praise God God just has to blow I mean God I mean he's so powerful praise God nothing is too hard for God in other words God help us to stop building walls and let the power of God come in and break down all those walls Hallelujah see your denomination walls will crush and God will be known again he's the same yesterday to name forever his every fiber filling with the Holy Ghost every muscle field he's talking about Samson now look at this he went from having all these walls of of sexual immorality right and all these walls have I lost my eyes and woe is me I'm a slave the rest of my life I can never do anything for God he let the Holy Ghost break down all those walls and even now I can do something for God and it turned out as brother Adam said it was Samson's greatest Victory Hallelujah in his darkest moment when he let the Holy Ghost pour into his life amen oh I love this it filled every fiber of his being praise God not just his soul well I'm saved now Hallelujah now I can die Samson no he said fill every fiber oh my fill my mind fill my fill my soul and fill my body praise God so I can get a great victory for Jehovah let me die with the Philistines that prophecy might be fulfilled praise God let me die to myself that prophecy might be fulfilled in The Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see every fiber talk about muscles filled with creatine right or you talk about muscles filled with protein how about muscles filled with the Holy Ghost now now we're on to something praise God hallelujah but really the main thing is the mind right that's the main thing oh Church the Living God I'm going to omit the rest of my notes to say this one thing why don't we are you ready Assemblies of God are you ready United Church are you ready one is sanitary whatever you are you ready Church of God are you ready right of Christ Fellowship to let God fill every fiber of your being praise God just flow through me Lord Jesus whatever you want to do tonight just flow through me praise God and do what only you can do praise God Hallelujah like we've seen I'm just going to go back to some of these examples sometimes all it takes is somebody else's prayer or a word of wisdom from somebody and you are set free we've seen it we've been doing podcasts right we've seen it sometimes it just takes a hand laid on somebody and they're instantly healed in the night time hallelujah amen praise God sometimes it just takes a group of sisters to talk to somebody and they're instantly set free the burn is gone Hallelujah sometimes that's all it takes sometimes all it takes is somebody to come up for prayer and you feel the fire of God burning up in your bosom remember brother the first time you're here last year Hallelujah sometimes it's all it is but see we got to yield to the holy spirit so the spirit of God fills every part of our being is it already 40 minutes preaching unbelievable unbelievable I don't know how this happens something wrong with that clock now this beautiful quote I may preach a whole series on this sermon this sermon is so powerful so brother I'm talking about there's four there's four bugs that kill the Holy Ghost anointing in unbelievers lives so God has four steps to restore it right he has the four anointings right with the church ages brother RAM does it like this he types it as a tree right a tree Jesus or yeah the Bible said I'll restore saith Lord hallelujah glory to God praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring the forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pope so Brothers using a tree as the the whole bride of Christ so the tree had started dying on the inside the inside would be the pulp of the tree right but but Martin Luther brought back the pulp the just shall live by faith live amen but just shall live Hallelujah live by faith First Step it's another tree it's dead it's dead uh any any anything else on the tree is dead otherwise there's trees that except now the trees got life in the pulp it looks on the outside looks like it's dead no signs of life but now Luther brought pulp back to the tree he said but sanctification through Wesley brought back the bark the doctrine of holiness so see when women start cutting their hair or wearing makeup or Men start wearing shorts it's like the tree is naked there's no bark on the tree right so the bark is the covering that's why then God sisters got your bark on tonight praise God Hallelujah thank God Amen if not we'd have a naked tree there's no bark on the street something's wrong with that it might have the pulp inside think of how many churches brother have trees that are naked naked churches and naked trees in the church but yet there's a little pulp on the inside right but thank God we've been restored we're not naked trees I've got bark amen the children can rip the bark off you know they can they can see oh it's a healthy tree I got signs I've got life praise God can I say this I've got signs I'm living a holy life praise God now remember this is what Satan does in the opposite order though we'll we'll see that what brought back the leaf the Pentecostal so zuza Street Pentecost those leaves clap their hand Joy rejoicing Pentecostal hallelujah what was the fourth was the word itself in other words the Seven Seals the mysteries of God the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the fruits there it is proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ is finally after justification has been planted sanctification has been planted baptism the Holy Ghost organizations night out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap on the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap amen isn't that beautiful I thought now see George when we're healthy Christians all the we're producing all these fruits right people can feel your love people can feel your long suffering Hallelujah people can see the fruit of faith in your life come on they still got faith after all these tests and proud Hallelujah they're still patient after all these trials they're still patient in the midst of this but see Satan comes around he tries to eat away all of our fruits well now we lost all the fruits well we might have a little clapping still right we still got the leaves right we might have a little clapping I'll clap a little bit at church but you gotta lost your patience well then pretty soon it gets you so cold you can't even clap anymore you have to wait to the preacher or the song there says let's give God a praise praise the Lord let's clap for Jesus oh you cucumber let's not be a cucumber charger come on let's not let the bug eat away all of our leaves amen all of our fruits let's manifest fruits for the glory of God hallelujah see they leave they these people people let Satan eat away their leaves They Don't Clap anymore they don't sing and praise anymore they don't got any leaves can't shout Amen to the word of God there's no noise it's just dead like brother answer those moaning trees [Music] ooh this moment we don't want to be that church we want to be living trees amen we want Pope praise God Amen we will burn we want leaves we want fruit we want to be the bride tree praise God I want to be a healthy Christian not a dying one Hallelujah I want to be planted by rivers of Living Water Lord Jesus I know you never do it but may I never plant myself out in the desert isolating myself out Jesus won't do that church we do that to ourselves Hallelujah Lord I know Lord you'll plant Me by rivers of Living Water I can always get a fresh drink anytime I want one is that right Church see so we've got to watch that in our lives Satan will eat away first at the fruit you're no longer patient no longer loving you can't love your enemies anymore you're upset at everybody where's the fruits of the spirit and then you come to church maybe it's not even that maybe just hang your head the whole time the bugs and the spiritually church God can see the bugs crawling all over here think about that all your all your leaves they're being eaten up right and then as we've seen then sometimes the sisters come with cut hair or man come uh in immoral clothes or men come and they're just disinterested they we've had Brothers come here that wouldn't even say we had a brother come here for seven years and never said amen to one word I said God help me I miss it all those years I I missed it that that brother had the bugs crawling all over him he had no leaves but the first time I met with him in a counselor I said you have the Holy Ghost and he said I don't know I should have called it right there but he could play music to make me cry and I thought well that's God he's got to have the Holy Ghost if he's making me cry I found out he didn't have the Holy Ghost I finally just had a gift right and when you operate the gift you get the you get the anointing going but Church the whole time in all those years never came up for prayer one time what was it the bugs are eating away and last time I talked to him he said I don't know if it's father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ how could you not know that the name of Jesus Christ is the name above all names and church bugs have been eating on him for 40 years probably so let's learn from that church I don't do that to bad mouth people I do that so we get a warning because Jesus said remember a Lot's wife remember the brother who had no leaves right remember the brother who had no fruit let my life be a fruitful healthy Christian experience praise God please God don't let me be a cucumber let me be a real living epistle a real living tree where people can come enjoy the fruits of my life amen they know they can walk up to brother Jesse and they're going to get some fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God I'm not going to say I don't have time to talk to you I don't want to hear your voice we got time for you may God give us Grace that we can always show the fruits of the Holy Spirit I thought that's a beautiful quote so now you know church when you start losing your clap now you know what the bug the bug's trying to eat your leaves now Hallelujah that's what you know now you know he's trying to eat away at your worship that's why it's good to dance every now and then because you got some victory in your life Hallelujah and your dancing don't have to be like mine now everybody dancing had to be like David Hallelujah but you gotta do something for the Lord you got to feel every fiber you got to feel the spirit of God in your feet amen you got to command your feet to praise the Lord amen as far as you can do is stump stomp your way to Victory praise God Glory so see brother bear said I'd rather have Wildfire which is uncontrollable emotion or rather have somebody who's so uncontrollable than a dead cucumber because at least they're in touch with their emotions right someone who's dead they have shut off just like just like this this building had to shut off the water whoops I almost tripped off there they had to shut off the water to make sure that because the pipe some of the pipes froze this this weekend right but a cucumber shuts off all access God can't get any of their emotions and yet they'll Shout at the football game right they'll cry at the movie right they'll show all this excitement watching porn or some sex scene on a movie they'll show all this excitement I can't wait for this they've shut it off to God but the devil's got it all clogged up they're not setting their affections on things above we have to we have to make a point I'm only going to give God my emotions Hallelujah I'm going to reserve all my praise to God Hallelujah like you can you can you can ask Malachi Malachi's my witness when my nephew last year was in the playoffs I was praying for him to have a good game okay that was the first game I went to in like 15 or 10 years something like that I don't go to games just for go to games I believe it's sinful to go to games just for fun but I went to support my nephew and I prayed before you can ask maokai when he scored a second third touchdown I said I said praise the Lord and everybody's like looking at me well these little group was looking at me I said Hallelujah to turn around and look at people staring at me because it's what I prayed for and now he's got a scholarship to go to Toledo so I said Hallelujah Hallelujah like I was like praise God that's just what I prayed for you know it was I wasn't rejoicing the natural I was rejoicing because God heard my prayer Hallelujah the Wildfire maybe at the football game Hallelujah he said this is Brother uh Reed had brother Brandon I'm here today to ask this I've seen the Pentecost listen kick the seats out in the floor has anyone ever done that that's good timing Malachi has anybody ever kicked the seat like anybody ever got so emotional they kicked the seat out this preacher had seen the Pentecostals kick the seats out in the floor and break up the furniture has anyone ever broken Furniture here no he said but have they got anything Reid has was it was a Baptist yes brother Reid had they have he said they have the Holy Ghost yes sir when you're praising God and you might I'm not going to do it you might bump this over you might break them if you're praising God and you break this guess what that can be replaced but at least you're not a dead cucumber Hallelujah Church I can buy you another guitar hopefully I can buy you another stand but man said these people had the Holy Ghost because they were praising God to a measure right it depends how much Holy Ghost they had based upon their reaction to the word of God because if you've got the word if you've got the Holy Ghost you can say Amen to every word of God ah hallelujah amen I said yes sir what kicking over furniture and breaking Furniture in the church you can have the Holy Ghost doing that yes sir well we about to have it too I said if you did you got it after you believe not when you believe they believe you get it when you believe Paulson Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost did you believed I said I can stand a little wildfire and kicking over Furniture over before I could sit in an old church so cold to the spiritual thermometer go 40 below zero we just saw 30 below zero this past weekend with the wind chill I was out there and I think you might have heard me say it on Christmas I was out there just 15 minutes shoveling snow and I had a permanent crease in my my lips like this I looked like the Joker If You Ever Seen The Joker I'd like I couldn't I was so my face was frozen so solid and come in yeah I was losing uh I'd come in because I was losing feeling in my fingers see it just puts this Frozen it puts you in this dead state it gets you stuck here so you don't you're not free anymore Hallelujah you're not warm anymore That's what Satan tries to do cool us off so he can't be moved by the Holy Spirit we can't give God praise we're not free to worship God Satan's trying to freeze us up but God's trying to thaw us out give us life and make us free give us Liberty praise God see Robert said I'd rather have that people kicking over the chairs and knocking over the chairs and and just you know knocking over things and kicking them I'd rather have that than dead church members dead cucumbers Hallelujah and the church said see because these people when they're cold they grieve the holy spirit so much they don't even know what the Holy Spirit feels like well at least somebody with a little emotion knows what the Holy Spirit feels like just got to ask for more wisdom control it Hallelujah Hallelujah when Dave was dancing the Bible never said he knocked over the ark and the church said that's a good thought that's a good thought that's right when brother Just Dances all over and I'm praising God I'm never knocked over the pulpit see because I'm under control I've got to control the Holy Ghost but I've been in Services where Saints haven't almost knocked over the entire uh they they've moved that there's a wooden Buick Camp search and I saw a sister get so in the spirit she she bumped this until it was like uneven it was way out here and she prayed that night for three hours straight after that we were just singing that was the night I was dancing I wrote it down I looked at my notes I was dancing two hours I danced around that church two hours came upstairs that was back in 2011. I got the notes on it too I got the sermon I saved too on that one but this whole row I saw I saw her knock this whole row and she come up screaming and crying and prayed there for three hours she said she woke up at midnight and she was starting at nine at nine PM praying there and woke up at midnight and where where have I been I've been in the spirit now a church we'd rather have that than dead cucumbers and the church said Hallelujah now that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost as far as the soul but it is evidence you got in the spirit praise God hallelujah praise God see so see I've seen pews almost knocked over and God's in that oh yeah absolutely yeah that mother was seeking uh victory for her children she was seeking all kinds of things and she had testimonies after that service God answered some of her prayers she was so filled with God every five of her being amen she's just a little girl she's just a little old woman little mother but she sure moved that bench right there Hallelujah I got a lot of quotes on here how many quotes I have I'm sure going heavy quotes tonight here I'm trying okay I'm almost there I'm almost at the end here bye just flop then just keep on weather going up or you're down whichever way you're doing okay he's talking about how if you're an eagle a baby eaglet the mother will come find you right how many know that mothers will look out for their children praise God mother animals go searching for their babies mother's standing right out there soaring right around his eyes on the sparrow I know he watches in and out of his church to see if you got out topsy-turvy something will happen the big wings the word of God will bring you right back up somebody said that's Wildfire I'd rather have a little Wildfire than no fire at all you know all right we could take those big wings and bear it back up to the right is that right Brothers just think if it's just a little out of order why we'll just catch them on the wings see just exactly what it is and bring them back up into Grace again if he said if they just let them flop yes sir just let them go ahead and shout and praise the Lord and holler Hallelujah dance in the spirit whatever they want to do they get out of order we got something here The Wings God will never let you drop if you're an eagle Hallelujah in other words if you're worshiping God and freedom God will always protect you Hallelujah and I believe but I believe like this if God if you're willing the spirit God will keep you under control and I believe that is in order I believe that's the order or the command of the holy spirit for that service amen the girls ask me are we going to dance tonight I said if the Holy Spirit leads us Who Am I who am I to say when we're going to have it like I tried to set the dates but it don't really matter we actually had it before we actually had dance Services before my scheduled dance service amen but at least I was in the right season praise God oh yeah I had the wrong date brother but I had the right season hallelujah thank God Amen see God does it on his time not ours now if you're a buzzard you're failing anyhow you're falling down so you just splash out on the ground but if you're a real Eagle you'll listen the word of God you know that Mother's Wing will bring you right back to Grace again so I've had that I've I'll just give an example I'll have it where I'm almost falling off and I feel like God will catch me from falling on my face and hurt maybe hurting myself there's been times I've almost fallen off this pulpit or I'm like off balance and I almost go through that window I could go glass could break I could cut myself but so many times I've just been worshiping like that God has always caught me and the church said what would you think if your pastor fell through the back window that makes me think I should probably put a board up here actually just to be on the safe side bye but see every time I almost got out of order God is always gracious to us mother Eagles watching over I want to make sure my baby don't get too much out of order wherever they hurt themselves or something like that Mama Eagles watching over you girls how many believe that Mama Eagle's watching you and God if I really love God God won't let me get in the flesh too far to where his spirit will say you're a little out of order now you bring it right back how many believe that oh you got to believe that church because you'll be you'll you'll be so excited sometimes and then you'll say something flesh and you'll say oops I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that how many how many can relate to that if God helps you catch it there God will help you catch it in worship too Glory now this one I read to you a while ago or a couple weeks ago when I started this series he said I know there's a lot of fanaticism of people carry it on I know sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything and I know that goes I believe that too I've seen people in that day as long as the music's playing everybody's jumping and screaming when the Music Stops they stop see well that's still all right as far as I'm concerned as long as a people lives right but now you start bringing that word that's a thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on Pentecost when the word was Vindicated now that's what I found when we've had our dance services this month it was the word that brought me life and then I wanted to dance afterwards I had to save some of my dancing for afterwards right and even you if you feel like dancing you got to save it it's got to be in the right time and season right because you don't want to be a distraction but I'll say like this if you want to dance you go ahead and dance praise God I'll just keep preaching preaching the word of God Amen somebody's enjoyed it hallelujah amen see there's freedom the main thing is live right and let God flow through you and let's try to avoid being pickle Christians or cucumber Christians which sometimes I wonder are they even Christians uh right because Robert said you got to get out of order just to get saved you got to get out of the Cucumber experience just to get saved Hallelujah that's right now finally where I want this is kind of where I wanted to go I want to finish all the verses that talked about dancing now I don't want to let the cat out of the bag here too quick but go to proverbs 31 here proverbs 31 verse 25. I got two more sections that speak specifically of dancing and that Hebrew word is rejoicing remember whirling around rejoicing Joy spiraling uh Proverbs 31 25. now we ended last time remember in Isaiah remember Isaiah said God will make you to dance again you remember that God will build you up when you're weak when you're when your Castle is broken down God will build you back up so you can dance again your walls are servation our Salvation your gates are praise amen oh in other words God wants you to dance again amen God wants you to shout again God wants you to Rejoice again amen God wants you to scream again Hallelujah ah thank God Amen he's going to build you back up proverbs 31. I'll hear a few mothers say Amen on this one here pretty soon proverbs 31 here no pressure though of course 31.25 this is the portion on the Proverbs 31 Woman remember she has two things she always does she's good to her husband all the days of her of her life and second she has the fear of the Lord that's a Proverbs 31 Woman verse 25. well actually let's go to yeah 25. strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come that's where is the Rejoice is the same one for dance now if you read this chapter this woman ain't busy dancing all the time she's up at night making sure the candle's on making sure the kids got food making sure everybody's got clothes on the church said she's making purchases she's making business deals she's sewing she's making food now remember it's interesting the Bible says women in the Bible most often women are dancing not men when it comes to this Proverbs 131 31 Woman the Bible shows all that she does and the Bible says there's times here her rejoicing her dancing will be in the future because she's so busy now she don't got a lot of time to dance thought I'd get some amens on that one amen her rejoicing is in the time to come because the Bible says there's no Greater Joy Hallelujah than to see your children walk in the truth amen so when these women these mothers finally see their children dancing or sorry yeah dancing too when they finally see their children praising God serving God with all their hearts it might cause her to dance a little bit and praise the Lord I cause her to glorify the Lord and sing God's Praises but her rejoicing is in time to come when she sees the fruits of all her labors she might be too tired to dance right now while she's putting the clothes together sewing the clothes or making the purchases or doing all these or staying up all night with the sick ones it's hard to dance when you guys throw up all over you I know because I caught throw up this week with my bare hands well thanks to a rag actually I had the rag in my bare hands and caught all of it it was like a I don't get too descriptive here but I'm gonna cause anybody to throw up in the surface not here I don't want to catch it again I guess but I know it's like and I didn't really feel like dancing in that moment just just like the mother the rejoicing wasn't a time to come there's a there's a season to mourn and there's a season to dance thank God but the reality is God's gonna make us Dance Again Hallelujah he's going to make us a Rejoice Hallelujah he's going to give us a reason to praise amen Hallelujah I still got a reason to praise amen Glory so look at this mama this Mama's got to have a dance right there's no Greater Joy I want to bring that brother Branham told Marilyn Hickey thus saith the Lord You're gonna have a baby she had to wait 10 years for it think her her rejoicing was in time to come now of course she's a woman preacher we don't agree with women preachers but she honored the prophet of God and God blessed her right now she could have said no I don't believe that and when she had a baby I don't know it could have been a conditional promise but she waited 10 years now Church think about that are we how long have we waited for our promise let this be an encouragement let's go back to Abraham where there's 10 years or 25 years you're the children of Abraham praise God keep waiting on the Lord keep believing God you're rejoicing could be now or in time to come praise God I would say like this I'm rejoicing now and I'm gonna rejoice in time to come I ain't gonna let the devil steal my rejoicing I'm going to give God praise while I'm in the land of the living Hallelujah amen because I yield my vessel my body's not my own it's God's body Hallelujah so I glorify God in my body and my mind which are gods it ain't mine it's God's like I was praying before service out here like I normally do Lord just use my body tonight For Your Glory it ain't mine it's yours now Lord I don't know why you make a body like this ugly like this and forget I don't know why you'd make a bite like this but part of it's my fault all of us my fault forgive me Lord forgive me Jesus oh it's my fault praise God any wrong in me so look this woman her dancing will come later after all these years of toil all these years of Toyota think about that one of these days we're gonna see sister Beatrice dance around here where's he sister Naomi sister Kristen all you sisters we're gonna see all these mothers Hallelujah and all the mothers to me praise God where's they're all going to be dancing it's some time to come that's what the Bible says praise God some of our fathers need to dance to and thank God and praise God Look What the Lord Has Done amen hallelujah praise God like I told you I made that promise to God over there in that Sanctuary Lord I said let my children be filled with the Holy Ghost as proof before this other family that that we're going the right way and God's given me desire in my heart that's why I can dance around here and praise God that's why I can love the Lord praise God Hallelujah Look what Jesus has done praise God so Jesus specializes in changing our emotions bringing us out of these valleys bringing us out of our difficulties our seasons of slumps our winter seasons anybody ever anybody ever had a winter season check it out right there kind of nice if you like spring now though hallelujah it's gonna be 48 tomorrow thank God so he gives us a little sign the Spring's coming Church your spring is coming amen amen hallelujah keep believing God's word keep trusting God you'll dance again Hallelujah amen but you'll dance again it might be in time to come but you'll dance again Jesus quoted these first two verses in Luke chapter four when he read the scroll the spirit Lord of God is upon me because he anointed me to preach Good Tidings under the meek what's annoying to me tonight is this Satan or is this Jesus he has sent me to bind of the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are around you don't have to be a prisoner to sin you can be free tonight in Jesus Christ's name I'm preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ tonight hallelujah oh it's done so much for me amen I cannot tell the law amen thank God Hallelujah to proclaim the acceptably the year of the Lord and Jesus stop right there because the next part is the Armageddon the day of Vengeance of our God to come for all that more now that's what we can have we can have comfort today you're gonna have comfort through all that more look at that oh look at that oh all but more to a point unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for ashes in the Bible Whenever there was bad news they would get in sackcloth and Ashes they would take off their their fancy clothes and they would put on sackcloth clothes and Ashes and just sit around in the ashes the outside matched the inside but Jesus Promised when the spirit of God comes I'm going to take away the ashes and I'm going to give I'm going to restore your beauty back because the spirit of the Lord is on me Hallelujah I'm going to give you the oil of Joy instead of mourning oil makes you shine right every night my wife puts on these oils wow her face is shining like a like a light bulb or like a son or something like that so I'm pretty like the sun I'd say like it something she puts on there though what is it it's not oil it's oil okay all right all right it's oil instead of morning right ashes all over your face sad disfigure faces Jesus is going to give you oil instead of mourning Hallelujah he's going to give you a Garment of Praise to see you've got to put praise on you've got to make a choice you got to go into your spiritual closet and you got to take praise off and say I'm going to praise God right now everybody's going to see me I got it on I'm going to praise God this is my praise clothes this is how I look when I praise God hallelujah like it or not I come here to give God the praise amen Hallelujah God wants you to take off the mourner's clothes and put on the praiser's clothes I come to praise God this is what he specializes this is why I sent the Holy Ghost I'm going to give you the Garment of Praise instead of Heaven that's depression instead of being depressed I'm going to make you to rejoice I'll say like this instead of being you being depressed you're going to depress the devil thought I could keep her about I thought I could keep her about I thought my trap was good enough your trap can never match the wisdom of God hallelujah amen you can't set a trap good enough to outmatch our Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah there's no bait devil you can put in front of me that I would ever give in to you because I see greater riches than that I see spiritual reasons I see the Millennium praise God I want to Reign the Millennium I want to go to the Future home I want to eat from the Tree of Life Hallelujah not the tree of knowledge and Good and Evil Netflix ain't gonna take me porn ain't gonna take me Facebook ain't gonna take me Instagram ain't gonna take me praise God I will not Feast on that I will Feast on the street of Life Hallelujah there's no bait that will take me praise God there's nothing he can lay in front of me that I want more than Jesus thank God Hallelujah like they say Satan don't have enough you don't have enough he could wave a million dollars that ain't enough to shout out Jesus I'm with Jesus all the way praise God hallelujah I'm going with Jesus I'm sorry with Jesus and I'm going through praise God that the Saints the bride of Christ might be called trees of there it is treat fried tree I didn't even see that the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified your whole life is the glorified Christ Jesus now I took this verse I thought well where are some examples in the Bible of this the Bible literally said job and Mordecai were laying in ashes but then the spirit of God came but then I love those words ah they're laying there feeling sorry David your job's complaining against God where are you God where are you God and God comes down and gives him the word praise God humbled him Mordecai said who's going to yes sir if you don't deliver us Gods they're going to deliver us and then afterwards God exalts Mordecai gives him new garments new position job gets a new life praise God more children he gets twice as much money he's ever had God Hunter took away their their ashes and gave them Beauty praise God Glory just hang on church just don't bow to Haman just don't bow to Satan and Leo to say I praise God only bow to the Lord Jesus Christ amen don't give up don't don't worship Satan don't worship the world worship Christ only and he'll take your beauty I'll say he'll take your ashes and he'll give you beauty praise God I'll say this I'll give you your beauty back Hallelujah amen how about Hannah Hannah mourned so hard for a child she mourned so hard uh Eli thought she was drunk and really she was just drunk with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Jesus try to cry out to God just drunk with the Holy Ghost woman get up you're drunk she said no I'm just pouring out my soul in other words my soul is in contact with God I'm asking God for something and he said you'll have it then praise God and she'd come back after Samuel's weaned and said praise the Lord and God's been so good to me I forget all the exact quotes she said it's in first Samuel chapter two you can read everyone she started praising God glorifying God

Hallelujah I'm gonna have faith tonight praise God let's read this whole chapter this is a beautiful chapter Psalms 130. oh boy it's hard to shut down this preacher sometimes all right it's a short chapter verse one Praise You the Lord Praise O ye Servants of the Lord praise the name of the three times I said praise praise praise that's your Victory right there praise there's power and praise verse two blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for Evermore in other words you got to start praising God right now I'm going to praise God starting tonight even in my situation I'm looking at God's word tonight from this time forth and all forevermore like I was praying last week God give us a 2023 where we can dance all over the church where we see prayers finally answered years of waiting years of crying now but now God's taking away our our garments of mourning and giving us garments of praise amen granted Jesus amen did I get to verse 4. nope verse three yeah here it is now here's a command church we want to be real children of God look at this verse 3 from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the shame the lord's name is to be praised that's why I put on instrumental music right away when I wake up in the morning I get the praise on sometimes I'll get on Joy in the hospital or right away in the morning you gotta think of Eden and virtue and nature shouting that song out yeah I think of them too or my girls hey Haven and Victoria shouting it out so now they just need that uplift I got to get it I got to get in the praise mode Hallelujah verse 4 the Lord is high above all nations and it's glory above the heavens who is liking the Lord Our God who dwelt on high look at this who humbled himself remember little Jehovah on Sunday who humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth God is so far above Earth but he humbles himself and he comes out and he shows you how much he cares about you that's humility God's so far above this he comes out and humbles himself and interacts with each of Our Lives see humility is a good thing right because God humbles himself verse 7 he raises up the poor Out of the Dust now that's what he did to my family now we weren't dirt poor but we were pretty poor look at my family now look at my brothers now look at my mom now like I showed you that testimony look at my mom now Look What the Lord Has Done praise God hallelujah I just talked to her this morning she's doing great she's like I don't need that money she would tell me like they got this testimony of somebody gave Simon uh some money and Simon tried to give it to my mom I was like I don't need that money because Look What the Lord Has Done and the church said I just have such an encouragement to me my mom's all alone and God God has been her husband praise God even in her condition he raised the poor Out of the Dust and lift the needy out of the dungeon I think about Joseph Joseph was in a pit maybe not dung in there but how much lower can you get than a pit and then Paul said I count all these things as dumb see we were in some of us were in denominations of dunghills and God brought us out of the dunghill ah thank God Amen thank God he didn't forget about me and leave me in the dung Hill of the Presbyterian Church or Assembly of God church thank God he didn't leave me the dung Hill he cleaned me off with amen he rushed off all the Dungy he took off that old garment and he gave me a new one now you're not covered in Doug now you're covered in cleanliness and Holiness praise God got some Pope got some bark got some leaves got some fruit praise God thank God sometimes I wonder why I'm so happy I guess it's the prince of the Lord I hear myself preaching my why is he laughing so much he must be the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength verse 8 that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people is that what God did to Joseph he was in a pit and raised him up to be a prince Moses was out in the desert murder God raised him up to be a prince of his people he maketh the bear woman to keep house to be a joyful mother of children Praise You the Lord look God says praise praise praise he gives all these examples God always takes the opposite the bad and turns it into good praise God oh it's so beautiful is that what Mary said Mary said my soul magnifies the Lord my spirit hath rejoicing God my savior free is guarded the lowest state of his handmade look up in the Greek low means really really low like depressed and uh Mary was in a really low spot she was in she was a she was a teenage Jew you know just a low women were not very appreciating those days you know the Romans could have their wives and children killed at that in those days and when when God showed her she was going to bring forth the Christ child she changes from a low estate and now she's praising God magnifying God giving God all the glory ah let it be a picture of Our Lives Church oh that Christ could be born in our soul praise God let the word be born in you and me Church Hallelujah from for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed all generations will say you're the bride out of laodicea you made it out of laodicea praise God and I'll say you made it out of fire terror how are that possible how did you make it out of Sardis Luther my goodness see each one will look at each other in admiration how did you look it out of there and each one will say by the blood of the Lamb and the word of Our Testimony I didn't make it by my might or by my power but by his Spirit saith the Lord I made it because the spirit of God was anointed me he took away my morning and gave me dancing the servant and he hath Lifted Me Up he that is mighty hath done to me great things holy is his name I was low but the great one condescended down to my level and Raised Me Up and has done great things to me how many can say Amen to that you know I was thinking about Austin Lee and Chris let's go to Luke 15 the last one Luke 15 25 this was the last verse I found worth dancing in a good way there are some bad dancing in there in the scripture but I focus on the good ones this is a beautiful chapter if you want to read Jesus thoughts about saving Sinners that's a good chapter to read right here the Pharisees murmur in verses one and two this man sits with Sinners he eats with Sinners so Jesus tells a parable of the lost sheep they tell us the parable the Lost coin then he tells the parable of the lost son which this one is the prodigal now church one thing I want to bring out if you go to verse where is it verse 31 go to verse 31. this elder son was not a Pharisee this was a believer because look what 31 says read 31 Lydia the Pharisees didn't get all of Heaven they were children of Hell According To Jesus so in the parable the two sons these are both message believers but one message believer goes way out into the world right that's what the story is he disrespects his father so much he leaves the message right disrespects he goes to the spot where he's the lowest any Jew could go with a pig these pigs were unclean he went to the very depths of sin but finally at the very Rock Bottom the Bible said finally he came out of that lustful Spirit he came out of that that rebellious spirit and he came to himself see sometimes it takes the very lowest spot we can get to until we can finally get a victory if anybody needed a change of garments it was this guy this guy was sleeping with pigs I mean he's eating with pigs and he said I come to myself and said I know my father's house if I just ask and go back I know he'll make me a servant because my father loves me my father's full of grace and church the Bible said the father was waiting as soon as he saw him he said That's my boy and he ran out to meet him and he didn't care what he was dressing he wasn't looking at his natural garments he was looking at a spiritual garments praise God he's come back a repentant heart and he said go say the say the fighting calf give him a ring put some shoes on give him a change of clothes my son was dead and now he's alive and the Bible said pretty soon after that the old son came back and he come back the faithful son and he heard people dancing and praising God he says where's all this dancing because someone that was lost is found amen see it makes us dance when people come back to the word of God hallelujah ah this is the last time I think here that I can preach here tonight this is the last time where we see dancing and it's when Souls return when people that have wandered away come back in real sincerity and weep their way and get right with God it makes the people Rejoice God help it to happen more to us praise God man let's stand to our feet and we Rejoice with uh Chris before he even got baptized we Rejoice musicians can come do you have a song in your heart with him I'ma stop right there Hallelujah how many thank God for the word of God tonight I preach my voice now I preach my heart out tonight I said Lord don't let it be me I said Lord you preached through me tonight I've tried to yield myself in every way I know how the spirit of the Lord is upon me Hallelujah we all should want to say that Hallelujah and he's taken away by garments a Mourning and he's given me a Garment of Praise Church wherever we find ourselves today if we find ourselves discouraged then we need to get away we need to find a way to get out of that praise God and the way out is repentance just like the prodigal just like the prodigal the way out is to repent and really mean business with God how many believe that Hallelujah you got a song Malachi you want to play see when he played when he ran to me would you do that one it's a beautiful story Chris I didn't have time to preach the whole thing but if you want to read a good chapter buddy that's a great chapter Luke 15. God gives Jesus gives all these examples of this is what it's like to be saved Hallelujah he said he said I lost I had 100 sheep I lost one I left the 99 to go get the one he said I had all these coins I lost one I swept the whole house till I found that and I let the neighbors know come on over and celebrate [Music] son comes home he throws a party this this rebellious son will not have the same rewards as the faithful son but at least he's got eternal life gonna say like that at least he's got eternal life and God help us not to have the attitude like we're better than somebody let's rejoice when a saint comes back praise God Hallelujah let's rejoice in what Jesus is doing I know he's moving here praise God oh yeah it's a season God's of the season are doing something praise God is setting people free in our church he's also sending people free as they listen around this nation I know at least two examples they've reached out and told me that God has restored their worship through these preaching services God help me to restore all of our worship praise God Hallelujah let's bar heads and if anyone needs prayer more than welcome to come up here let's buy our heads here today Heavenly Father we love the real Gospel of Jesus Christ there's so much power in this word Satan has to move back Hallelujah because the spirit Lord is upon us dear God thank you Jesus now Lord forgive us if there's anything we've done wrong God just forgive uses we all fall short on the glory of God but yet you said if we confess our sins you're faithful and just to forgive us and help us to walk in the light as you're in the light of your God so forgive me Lord anything I've said and done or thought that's wrong Lord Jesus forgive me dear Lord Jesus just want to be right in your eyes just want to be used by you I just want the anointing of God to be here Lord God thank you Jesus Lord bless the people they've been patient thank you for the songs we heard thank you for the word of God that's been preached here I know it's life-changing Lord God it's changed my life Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus proceedings of rejoicing you specialize in changing our emotions lifting our Spirits giving us a reason to praise as we give you thanks Lord May each person here Lord have all their channels open so their Temple is filled with your praise and not feel it filled with doubt and discouragement or fear or anger or lust or bitterness or Pride oh God an awful thing Pride [Music] be so free of Pride will be like David a man a woman after the heart of God thank you Jesus the Lord thank you God for giving us an indication this is the right direction I've got it from Brother Ray like I said the numerous people contacted me thank you Jesus that's your people free amen House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah all that the father has given me shall come to me Hallelujah and you will not lose one sheep Lord do what only you can do start with the course [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music]
