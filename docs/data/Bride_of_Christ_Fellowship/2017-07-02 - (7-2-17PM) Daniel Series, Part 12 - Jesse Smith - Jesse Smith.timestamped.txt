[22:44] sin or p12 we're willing to dice will
[22:48] finish Book of Daniel that's great
[22:52] Daniel 12 was really short I can't
[22:54] promise very long sermon children have
[22:58] been pretty surprised how short I've
[22:59] been preaching on Sunday night yeah he
[23:02] only preached 32 minutes
[23:04] no I had an in each other one day we
[23:09] finally having us the Word of God and my
[23:13] voice does feel a lot better so I don't
[23:14] know if you can tell I know I know my
[23:16] voice out for these last two years he's
[23:18] like a Scottie wisdom to get it back
[23:21] it'll be like it's coming back it's no
[23:23] injuries I'm thankful for that
[23:25] Creason
[23:26] so Daniel chapter 12 were just
[23:27] rehearsing one again like we said on
[23:31] Wednesday we did chapter 11 on Wednesday
[23:33] when we came up after the service and
[23:35] said that wasn't this was an amazing
[23:37] message village St I was shocked so
[23:40] thankful you know I mean OTT I always
[23:42] enjoy the word but people are really
[23:44] blessed that God would open his word you
[23:48] know and really speak even then we're
[23:50] just teaching on Daniel but they got to
[23:52] able to minister to individual needs
[23:53] there so we're just laying off grace the
[23:56] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[23:57] intents of the heart thankful God spirit
[24:04] [Music]
[24:08] Daniel chapter 12 verse 1 I'm actually
[24:13] commonly got 18 slides on this others
[24:16] there's a very short message you need
[24:19] something to pull it out this time shall
[24:37] Michael stand up the Great Prince which
[24:39] standeth for the children of thy people
[24:40] and there should be a time of trouble
[24:43] such as never was since there was a
[24:45] nation even to that same time at that
[24:49] time thy people shall be delivered every
[24:51] one that shall be problem let's our
[24:56] heads worth bear ask God to administer
[24:59] one more time come with ourselves
[25:01] Heavenly Father Lord we humble ourselves
[25:03] Lord and exalt you Lord God you know
[25:07] your promise if we humble ourselves you
[25:08] exalt us a new season
[25:10] all we want Lord is exalted with more of
[25:13] your love more of a beating heart Lord
[25:16] in obedience your knowledge Jesus just
[25:18] to be or not with you more faithful to
[25:21] you nor some humble ourselves we put
[25:22] ourselves and our plans and our ideas
[25:25] and I are thought secret we wait for
[25:27] though yours have the preeminence dear
[25:29] God hey we just pull on the word I'm
[25:32] pulling myself
[25:36] tonight Lord Jesus we're just grateful
[25:39] Lord for what you've done here Lord
[25:41] today thank you for the fellowship
[25:42] that's the papal States nor all the
[25:44] states that came out this morning and
[25:46] tonight we're grateful to be in the
[25:48] house the Lord you know there's no
[25:49] greater place to be your profits that
[25:51] you've never regretted coming to church
[25:53] one time nor wheel or gods are so
[25:55] grateful to be here or we were happy
[25:58] when they said let us go to the house of
[26:00] the Lord so speak my lord let us be
[26:02] quick to answer the Lord we look to hear
[26:04] we're here tonight in Jesus Christ
[26:06] Church said Amen me to see their praise
[26:10] God they got to start with the review
[26:12] you know of all the chapters so far so
[26:14] note that when you're anybody again
[26:15] switch over to put like I said from this
[26:20] morning I got one question and answer
[26:22] back so if I get a couple more questions
[26:24] and answers we'll have this question
[26:25] answer service on anything that's been
[26:27] preached what they've got anything but
[26:30] I'll save that one just maybe week or
[26:32] two if we get any other questions
[26:36] let's look at chapter 12 it's only 13
[26:39] short verses so we'll do a quick summary
[26:41] here and again if anybody needs any
[26:44] notes or close I can just you know share
[26:46] this I think I've email this to one
[26:47] person so far Daniel chapter one was
[26:54] Daniel his friends they'll kind of place
[26:56] positionally you know find them in
[26:58] Babylon and programs that's a perfect
[27:00] title to hit on one Babylon midst of
[27:04] Babylon yet we're in the bride age at
[27:05] the same time because the bride age is a
[27:07] spiritual condition and it's a spiritual
[27:09] condition is the baptism of the Holy
[27:11] Ghost amen
[27:12] we are in label to see it but that label
[27:15] to see them just living in it but ramps
[27:16] fixed exact questions and answers the
[27:18] souk seaport tells them they go to see a
[27:20] church age has not ended it ends at the
[27:23] rapture but we're living in the word age
[27:27] we know that the bride age you don't we
[27:28] know that that's the baptismal holy
[27:30] ghost chapter two is very prophetic it
[27:32] is very prophetic brother Graham gave it
[27:34] with rough state the Lord so it's
[27:35] extremely important about
[27:37] Nebuchadnezzar's dream because it's the
[27:39] times of the Gentiles and we went so
[27:41] awesome
[27:42] we went over some of those quotes on
[27:44] Wednesday night from chapter 11 if you
[27:46] think a chance listen to that we want
[27:48] some
[27:49] well or more of those quotes Rome and
[27:52] America the churches in America have to
[27:55] gain strength politically in order to
[27:58] start getting rich spot where they could
[28:00] possibly persecute the true bride but
[28:02] then Christ comes raptures her before
[28:04] the plot of the Antichrist could be
[28:06] carried out so that's what we're seeing
[28:08] now you know wishing evangelicals rally
[28:10] around Trump partly and every time I'm
[28:12] on Facebook that's easy
[28:13] you got a Jellico's you know like I said
[28:15] the Billy Graham Sun different ones all
[28:17] packing on the back like I said like you
[28:20] saw Wednesday he might be anointed of
[28:21] God just like Cyrus was nobody nicer but
[28:24] it's not anointing in the soul if you
[28:27] can continue you know doing and sanding
[28:29] some of the things that they do so
[28:32] that's just no we just gotta stay safe
[28:35] state it straight you don't got me
[28:36] straight but with love not against the
[28:39] people were just against the system
[28:40] behind them chapter three of course was
[28:43] prophetic as well brother Graham liking
[28:45] that one to the end time with a
[28:48] three-wheeler children the Prophet
[28:50] wasn't there brother grant upset and so
[28:53] they made an image to the Prophet and
[28:54] bowing down to the Prophet and of course
[28:56] we see that around different ranks
[28:58] people almost worshiping brother Graham
[29:01] saying every word he said was infallible
[29:04] and things like that that some of some
[29:06] have said some awful things like that
[29:08] making it babbles off for the awfulest
[29:10] doctors she said now everything you said
[29:13] was gonna save the Lord that's
[29:14] infallible right that's a metal but not
[29:17] every single word so chapter 4 of course
[29:19] Nebuchadnezzar getting the heart of the
[29:22] beast and then not humbling in through
[29:25] there was a great message on humility
[29:28] stay humble before God because God's put
[29:31] you in whatever position here and we saw
[29:32] that this morning from victory hitting
[29:34] whatever position you're in
[29:35] well the Graham said don't despise that
[29:36] he said serve God in it any bed chapter
[29:40] five was a handwriting on the wall the
[29:42] follow-up about shazar so went from the
[29:44] gold head right my bad line down to the
[29:46] chest and arms of silver the Medes and
[29:49] Persians so we saw that chapter 5
[29:51] chapter 6 Daniel the lion's den very
[29:54] familiar story to us there
[29:57] chapter 7 very prophetic chapter the
[30:00] vision of the form
[30:01] we see those same four beasts all rolled
[30:04] up into one beast in Revelation 13 so go
[30:08] grab so there's all those demon spirits
[30:10] and Babylon needs the furnaces in
[30:11] ancient Greece and ancient Rome all
[30:13] rolled in to the Roman Catholic Church
[30:15] and Holy Roman Empire then we saw the
[30:17] white throne judgment and that's of
[30:19] course very prophetic and then the
[30:21] fourth beast we see another picture of
[30:23] the Antichrist in fact that's not even
[30:25] first picture the Antichrist in Daniel
[30:27] chapter 7
[30:28] remember that the chapter 8 we see the
[30:32] RAM and the he-goat Moran was mean to
[30:35] Persia the he-goat was the Grecian
[30:37] Empire we see how exactly the great in
[30:39] there a lot of great prophetic things in
[30:41] chapter 8 and then we show you the
[30:43] little horn at the end a little horn on
[30:45] the fourth beast that's the Antichrist
[30:48] we see as we preach on that a lot of it
[30:50] it showed all the quotes I could find
[30:51] for brother Branham on that little
[30:53] and on the Antichrist and it just lines
[30:56] up exactly what the church age book says
[30:58] it's going after the government going
[30:59] after politics aren't you glad to be a
[31:01] part of our sorrow away from that not
[31:03] only might be a part not a part of a
[31:05] part I'm far from that one word apart
[31:11] far from that I'm not in we're not
[31:13] involved with that we don't we don't
[31:15] feel like Oh as a church used to try to
[31:16] influence the government our greatest
[31:18] influence is in influencing the
[31:20] government of happening and prayers and
[31:22] petitions to God that's our greatest
[31:24] weapon that we have not to rally around
[31:27] politics and politicians because program
[31:30] said every man he knew that when the
[31:32] politics got corrupted every single one
[31:34] he says I'm as close as President
[31:36] Jefferson felt I think I preached other
[31:38] last year if I'm not mistaken he said
[31:40] everyone when I was a crunch and that's
[31:42] why we stayed a million miles away from
[31:44] politics
[31:45] chapter 9 was Daniel 7 weeks very
[31:48] prophetic chapter no mother man gave us
[31:49] that 1961
[31:52] 6 full purpose of Gabriel's visit
[31:54] calling there we appreciate in chapter
[31:56] 10 to visit the age of the great
[31:58] interpretations remember that was the
[31:59] valley said I do make 21 days and it
[32:01] just reminded us of God's faithfulness
[32:03] and prayer amen
[32:04] that the into the answer will come
[32:07] Daniel right the answer will come when
[32:09] you pray when you set your face to see
[32:11] God God will answer it
[32:13] we met so we were very encouraged by
[32:16] that we just keep waiting on the
[32:17] promises of God and Wednesday we looked
[32:21] at the fall of the Persian and Greek
[32:23] empires that's what that was all about
[32:25] at the beginning of the chapter the king
[32:27] of the north was ancient Greece and the
[32:30] King of the South was Egypt but then
[32:33] later on we know the keel nor turns into
[32:35] Russia so there's a transition I believe
[32:37] it's around verse 35 I'm not mistaken
[32:39] and then the king of the north and not
[32:41] becomes prophetic of Russia
[32:43] Boban told us the North is Russia
[32:47] because once it's the once it starts
[32:49] with a bow purse I think that's verse 21
[32:51] you start transitioning into the type of
[32:53] Antiochus the form as the Antichrist and
[32:56] then the chapter ends as we saw one
[32:59] tonight on the invasion of Israel the
[33:00] Antichrist literally invades Israel he
[33:03] stands the temple of God saying that
[33:05] he's God something himself above all
[33:07] that is called God and he stops the
[33:11] daily sacrifice we saw that as well
[33:12] there's a little more on that tonight
[33:13] that's a little bit over Daniel chapter
[33:15] 12 as well for three and a half years
[33:18] the Jews don't have their temple rebuilt
[33:19] and they'll have at the end be
[33:21] sacrificed or the Ministry of the three
[33:23] net are the two prophets of three half
[33:24] years but then in the midst of that
[33:26] covenant I believe it's going to be a
[33:27] 7-year covenant but in the midst of that
[33:30] covenant the last half of Daniels 70
[33:33] week gets fulfilled right and then he
[33:35] breaks the Covenant and then he stops
[33:38] the daily sacrifice but then the Jews
[33:40] receive Christ amen 144,000 program said
[33:43] receive the same Pentecostal message
[33:45] that the two Hebrew that the two
[33:47] prophets are preaching or hate men he
[33:51] said that in numerous places the profits
[33:53] of that and then chapter 12 tonight very
[33:55] simple it's just too few topics it deals
[33:57] with the tribulation and the Jewish
[33:59] remnant and then there's time there's
[34:01] over two months of time after that three
[34:04] and a half years ends after the free
[34:06] have your tribulation ends there's still
[34:07] two months and 15 days after that where
[34:10] all these other things happen probably
[34:12] probably before the millennium if I'm
[34:13] not mistaken I could be wrong about me
[34:15] that's the next step after the
[34:18] tribulation comes the millennium alright
[34:20] so there's the review is that a good
[34:22] review
[34:22] we reviewed a little bit I do go back
[34:23] and check
[34:25] I forgot some of the chapters what they
[34:27] were aren't you dying the books over to
[34:28] you a memo BAM said it would be open to
[34:31] the last days so let me go up here I
[34:33] will just preach all the way right
[34:35] through this book it will probably be
[34:36] very brief here make it to buy about me
[34:38] surprised so they're very thankful by
[34:42] God's grace art 12 and you know part of
[34:45] that is futures because there's very few
[34:46] quotes you know on these things I tried
[34:49] looking up these quotes that are looking
[34:50] up this the phrases and they're just not
[34:52] a lot in there remember program was
[34:54] tying the loose ends together anytime
[34:56] the loose ends the message together hit
[34:58] the highlights and then the things that
[34:59] he gave us thus saith the Lord on we
[35:01] just tie everything together and it
[35:03] helps us interpret the whole book
[35:05] there's not a whole lot that's too
[35:07] mysterious
[35:09] okay so this is Daniel chapter 12 the
[35:11] background is that this jogger takes
[35:13] place in the same year at the same time
[35:15] as chapters 10 and 11 because it's all
[35:18] the same visit from the angel that broke
[35:20] through after 21 days he hasn't left yet
[35:22] he's still there stating telling Daniel
[35:24] what's going to happen so it's by a 36
[35:26] BC and he's 84 years olds here's an
[35:29] older man and he's still putting his
[35:32] face setting his face to see God's face
[35:36] verse 1 a very important verse program
[35:39] let me just read the quote first so you
[35:41] got this I don't remember when I
[35:42] preached it some of it I went through
[35:44] all the times with random reference
[35:46] Daniel in the church age book I believe
[35:47] there were six if I'm not mistaken okay
[35:49] so he connects he says revelation 7 part
[35:53] 8 is the same scene as Daniel 12:1 he
[35:56] said now that with this that with see
[36:00] Daniel 12:1 which refers to these
[36:03] 144,000 being sealed during the sixth
[36:06] seal and the time of the great
[36:08] tribulation or Jacob's trouble so we
[36:11] know prophetically exactly where Daniel
[36:13] 12 verse 1 is that's the Tribulation
[36:15] Period and the sealing of 144,000 so as
[36:19] we go back there verse 1 at that time
[36:21] shall Michael stand up now at that time
[36:23] her first
[36:24] it's carrying on the word and of course
[36:27] it always has this is a conjunction time
[36:29] he senses together so he's referring to
[36:32] the time of the Antichrist there in
[36:33] Israel at that time the time with
[36:36] Antichrist in history
[36:37] Michael the Great Prince who stands for
[36:40] the turn of Israel he said stand in for
[36:44] turn of thy people and there she
[36:47] entitled trouble such as never was since
[36:48] there was a nation even to that same
[36:50] time at that time thy people shall be
[36:53] delivered every one that shall be found
[36:55] written in the book so Michaels the
[36:58] Great Prince right he's the Archangel
[37:00] Bible causing the Archangel and Jude one
[37:02] night and there's something special
[37:03] about Michael he's always connected to
[37:05] body changes right he always connected
[37:07] the body change and the Holy Ghost
[37:10] because when Moses his body was lost
[37:12] Satan came to Michael Michael member
[37:15] beyou give me my mom I'm sorry Michael
[37:16] did bring an accusation against it he
[37:18] just rebuked him it's at the heart of
[37:19] Law Review thing so somehow Michael had
[37:22] a connection to the body change and of
[37:25] course we know after 144,000 um are
[37:27] sealed
[37:28] we know shortly after that they have to
[37:30] get a body change because the Lydians
[37:31] gonna set it they gotta have a brand new
[37:33] body at some point so Michael has some
[37:36] great connection as a heart angel time
[37:40] of trouble bro man just told us was the
[37:41] Great Tribulation Period the ievo
[37:43] course is 144,000 and they're delivered
[37:47] because their names are on the Lamb's
[37:49] Book of Life so this is the ceiling so I
[37:52] really this is a spiritual deliverance
[37:53] although I do have quotes it I don't
[37:55] have money here by you to have a quote
[37:56] about program says 144,000 won't die but
[38:00] then there's other quotes where he says
[38:01] they will die so I don't know it's like
[38:03] that I know I can tell you my opinion
[38:05] but I don't know for sure as far as what
[38:07] he said so will they perish you know in
[38:10] the number of the fifth seal he said
[38:12] they would perish remember that's that's
[38:14] a 1963 series of the seven seals
[38:17] he said because they're the martyrs that
[38:19] the soul some of the officer crying out
[38:22] and they said we'll just wait your
[38:23] brethren have to give their lives as
[38:25] well
[38:25] program said that was the 144,000 but
[38:28] then later he says they don't so you
[38:30] know we just got a different thought so
[38:32] just for me the word deliverance there
[38:34] at least means the baptism of Holy Ghost
[38:36] they're delivered for you all I brought
[38:38] into the grave see so that's first one
[38:41] now that's all if you said Provenza
[38:43] that's all tribulation we know we know
[38:45] where this is by people it's Israel
[38:47] Daniels people now verse two
[38:50] Daniel's informed of the white throne
[38:52] judgment which is really striking what a
[38:54] jump that is you know it goes from right
[38:55] there to the tribulation right to the
[38:57] white throne judgment upon each other
[38:59] and many of them that sleep so it may
[39:02] seem they're skipping a thousand years
[39:04] so between verse 1 and 2 the Angels
[39:06] gifts a thousand years and many of them
[39:09] had sleep in the dust of the earth shall
[39:11] awake some to everlasting life and some
[39:13] to shame and everlasting contempt that
[39:16] has to be the white throne judgment it
[39:18] has to be because Jesus said in John
[39:22] 5:28 all those in the grave will hear
[39:25] his voice right and they all come forth
[39:27] because that's the bottom said if
[39:28] they're sleeping in the dust I was
[39:30] sleeping in the dust so this is speaking
[39:32] of the white throne judgment and then
[39:34] Jesus call this in that b25 Jesus call
[39:37] this the resurrection unto life or the
[39:40] resurrection of the condemnation or
[39:42] contempt so that's that's what the word
[39:44] is it's content there so quite a jump
[39:47] right for Marcelin diversity have a jump
[39:48] over thousand years but in God's idea
[39:51] one day with the Lord as a thousand
[39:53] years with made notices it's no great
[39:55] time in God's eyes because he's had a
[39:57] type now verse 3 I mentioned this a
[40:00] little bit when we preach a few weeks
[40:02] ago on the Stars the reward of the
[40:04] Morningstar verse 3 says and they that
[40:08] be wise shall shine as the brightness of
[40:11] the Harmony and they that turn many to
[40:14] righteousness as the stars for ever and
[40:18] ever amen
[40:20] so the Bible said this is what the wise
[40:22] doing speaking of Daniels people so the
[40:24] wives of Daniels people with those who
[40:26] receive the prophets they receive the
[40:29] Pentecostal prophets and they get sealed
[40:31] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh
[40:33] there we go they mourn for a whole day
[40:36] right they go from house to house door
[40:38] to door oh how could we crucify our
[40:40] Messiah but that the Bible said the
[40:41] nation will be born in one day and I
[40:43] seen a 66 they met that nation will be
[40:46] born in one day and they're called the
[40:48] wise to see how their wives virgin Rexie
[40:50] that they're going to be wise because
[40:51] they're born again so we need to be amen
[40:53] wise with the Holy Spirit hallelujah and
[40:57] then he says and also they that turn
[41:00] many to righteousness
[41:01] we'll shine the stars forever amen so
[41:05] kind of gives us the illustration of
[41:06] romance in with you in the soul your
[41:07] name is wrapped around that crowd
[41:09] forever right it kind of gives the
[41:10] illustration of a shiny crowd some type
[41:13] of life you know the eternal life of a
[41:14] brand-new body you know if it out fyodor
[41:17] find body so soul wedding is so crucial
[41:20] even for the Jews right but also for us
[41:22] God honors it he said I give you the
[41:25] Morningstar even in other words the
[41:27] light the light of God Himself you have
[41:30] the light of God you become the light of
[41:31] God you're a shining star amen all right
[41:36] first forward but the how Daniel shut up
[41:39] the words and seal the book even to the
[41:41] time of the end many shall run to and
[41:44] fro and knowledge shall be increased
[41:47] now you said seal it up which Daniel
[41:49] didn't know but it's gonna be over 2,500
[41:51] years sealed up Daniel
[41:54] you almost got three thousand years so
[41:56] this is a people are you to understand
[41:57] this can you imagine why this has been
[42:00] the juice that lighted this book for
[42:02] almost 3,000 years but we understand it
[42:05] amen why because that branch was cut off
[42:07] but we were grafted in the root be holy
[42:12] so the branch ain't so because we have
[42:15] the holy spirit and God sent His Prophet
[42:17] now we understand the holy book thank
[42:22] God first mercy and he said is that the
[42:25] time when many shall run to and fro so
[42:28] see that's got to be the modern
[42:29] transportation people running across the
[42:31] oceans you know fly it across the ocean
[42:34] of the six hundred miles per hour in the
[42:36] air all kinds of speed and of course
[42:39] knowledge shall be increased the digital
[42:41] age where we have everything right at
[42:42] our head I love Malachi that when we go
[42:44] back and forth it's just a simple
[42:45] example but we go before we have our
[42:47] conversation that wasn't then I said oh
[42:49] no let me ask Google you know then I got
[42:51] all the knowledge right there he's
[42:52] hearing with this meter what what does
[42:53] that mean we just got that all the
[42:55] knowledge of our hand we don't take that
[42:58] for granted
[42:58] we don't want to look Syria ham all
[43:00] knowledge we want to grow in the
[43:01] knowledge of God ourselves amen
[43:03] but the knowledge you've got to be
[43:04] written up on our hearts because that's
[43:06] the most important knowledge the Word of
[43:08] God that's why I don't feel that I don't
[43:09] know everything about anything else
[43:11] that's fine but I want to know about the
[43:12] Word of God
[43:13] I want to know the master chain then I
[43:15] would know guys I don't know the book
[43:16] good day never know the whole Bible amen
[43:18] yes that's the true ecology now verse 5
[43:25] then I Daniel looked and behold there
[43:28] stood other two so he's already got one
[43:29] danger there but now there's two more
[43:31] and the one on this side of the bank of
[43:33] the river and the other on the side of
[43:35] the bank of the river verse 6 and one
[43:40] said to the man clothed in linen which
[43:42] was upon the waters of the ribs look
[43:44] he's hovering over the water what a
[43:45] picture there I'm gonna fix you the
[43:46] angel hovered one block how long shall
[43:49] it be to the end of these wonders see
[43:52] these are all wonders right the
[43:55] tribulation and the sealing of 144,000
[44:00] lynnium all these things white throne
[44:02] judgment the wise shining the stars
[44:04] these are all wonders he said what is
[44:06] the end of these wonders and verse 6
[44:09] verse 7 I heard the man clothed in linen
[44:11] which was upon the waters of the river
[44:13] when he held up his right hand and his
[44:15] left hand unto heaven and swear by him
[44:17] that liveth forever that should be four
[44:19] time times and a half and we and when he
[44:23] shall have accomplished to scatter the
[44:25] power of the holy people all these
[44:27] things shall be finished that's there's
[44:28] a lot of us right there so let's just go
[44:30] through that a little slowly slowly by
[44:32] God's grace and that's that angel stuff
[44:35] a lot like Revelation 2:10 he raised his
[44:38] hand and swear by him to live forever
[44:39] and ever night this sounds a lot like
[44:41] that how the angel with the angel brings
[44:44] the Word of God and gives you the oath
[44:46] this is thus saith the Lord
[44:48] you know it he's standing there brother
[44:49] have said this was this angel is the
[44:51] same thing in John chapter 10 milligram
[44:52] said that wasn't Christ
[44:54] he said this was just the Ange of the
[44:56] Lord because this angel couldn't defeat
[44:59] the Prince of Persia remember that and
[45:01] tell me what could you wanted to believe
[45:03] Christ hood and defeat of Prince of
[45:05] Persia but Nieman this can't be Christ
[45:07] but he does very similar things so they
[45:09] need to a revelation 10 he needed help
[45:12] from Michael right
[45:14] I'm sorry game was a game room game room
[45:15] I think his game he doesn't gain roughly
[45:18] to overcome now verse 7 the first thing
[45:21] I thought of there is the time times and
[45:24] a half soon
[45:26] right now something struck me yes I've
[45:28] read that before and the Holy Spirit
[45:29] programs that will always point you back
[45:31] to the word so that means the time times
[45:34] and a half means the Tribulation Period
[45:36] because the immediately hell that in the
[45:38] book of Revelation is revelation 12:14
[45:41] and the woman and to the woman were
[45:43] given two wings of a great Eagle that
[45:44] she might fly into the wilderness into
[45:46] her place where she is nourished for a
[45:47] time times and a half a time from the
[45:51] face of the surface almost the exact
[45:54] same words right America Revelation 12
[45:57] he said this is exact quote Revelation
[46:00] chapter 12 does not pertain to the bride
[46:01] this is Israel and this is after the
[46:04] manchild is grown up and he's been
[46:06] exhausted to the throne right goes right
[46:07] ahead him father
[46:08] and then the the woman has to flee for a
[46:11] time times and a half time
[46:13] that's the Tribulation Period so in
[46:15] other words that Ange would ask well how
[46:17] long to the east and he says I swear
[46:19] it'll be a time times and half the times
[46:21] you see all these things Daniels
[46:22] preaching about the Jews they don't
[46:24] happen to the Tribulation Period because
[46:26] they're cut off right but God is not
[46:29] going to forsake Israel they'll say I
[46:30] was did all the call call the name of
[46:32] Lord shall be saying hey man God's not
[46:34] gonna forsake his people how they live
[46:35] here either really forsake us amen glory
[46:39] let me go back there so the angel tells
[46:42] it it has to be for the Tribulation
[46:44] Period for us that's how we understand
[46:45] these things will happen then so all
[46:48] these things will be finished when he
[46:49] know then he gets into that next part
[46:51] here this is important to all they seem
[46:53] to be finished when he's the Antichrist
[46:55] shall have accomplished to scatter the
[46:58] power the holy people so in other words
[47:01] got the weights out of the three half
[47:03] years then the Antichrist breaks the
[47:05] Covenant and he has to scatter the
[47:07] powers of the holy people and program
[47:09] said that was to take away the daily
[47:11] sacrifice I'm showing you right here you
[47:13] see there's a lot in here in their light
[47:15] it's pretty vo3 deep in here so let me
[47:17] know here's there's two quotes we have
[47:19] both are from the 1961 series on Daniel
[47:22] he appreciates two weekends in a row
[47:24] programs reading this scripture he's
[47:26] actually reading Daniel 12 seven in 1961
[47:29] he says and when he
[47:30] personal pronoun now the Antichrist
[47:32] shall accomplish to scatter the part of
[47:36] the people that's when he breaks his
[47:38] covenant in the
[47:39] the week so somehow they have power
[47:42] right until the Covenant is broken he
[47:45] scatters their power and all these
[47:47] things shall be fulfilled
[47:49] amen he says that the next Sunday so the
[47:52] next time he says this beast this prince
[47:54] that shall scatter the power of the holy
[47:57] people what will he do he will break his
[48:00] covenant with them amen three and half
[48:05] years so Houston after a between a year
[48:07] so awesome now people think that's
[48:09] economy doesn't fear of God as he said
[48:11] if you think that the Spirit of God
[48:12] hasn't dealt with you yet look at that
[48:14] all right he said the Holy Spirit is not
[48:16] working you haven't dealt with yet if
[48:18] you still think the Antichrist is
[48:19] communism it's wrong the Bible says be
[48:23] so close though the seeds of bear legend
[48:25] if we're possible
[48:25] jesus said it so we're in the last day
[48:28] alright now think that's everything in
[48:30] there the time time to have tribulation
[48:31] and scatter the power people is where he
[48:34] breaks to cover it at the end of the
[48:35] trip at the end of the 390 years I'm
[48:37] starting it at the last half of Daniels
[48:39] 70th week everybody get this by God's
[48:41] grace is this okay all right amen I
[48:44] don't want you my love to understand the
[48:45] Bible you might have an answer somebody
[48:47] asked what Disney we like to know what
[48:49] it exactly says amen verse 8 now 8 9 and
[48:54] 10 are kind of straightforward you're
[48:55] not allowed
[48:56] we're almost done here magazine I might
[48:57] have three more slides alright verse 8
[49:00] you believe it
[49:01] how many minutes I got me okay so far
[49:04] I'm here you got six three hundred
[49:09] thirty minutes today mercy but it does
[49:11] help my voice let those out and plus we
[49:13] learn the words of God verse eight and I
[49:19] heard but understood not not Church
[49:21] understand this right this is only God's
[49:24] grace no wonder Danny that understand
[49:25] God had to reveal it to him it and the
[49:28] mysteries hadn't finished yet right so
[49:29] we would have been the same situation so
[49:31] humbly you don't think it doesn't
[49:33] understand I said oh my lord what shall
[49:35] be the end of these things they see he
[49:38] was thunders dead isn't that like every
[49:40] Christian you want to understand the
[49:41] word of that you and I would understand
[49:43] although there's prophecies I don't
[49:44] understand all the messages I want to
[49:46] understand but he asks and God has to
[49:49] turn it down verse 9 and he said go
[49:53] he's asking I was some more time with
[49:55] the angel tell me about these thing he
[49:57] said go you're waiting for the words are
[50:01] closed up and sealed to the time of the
[50:03] end but you know one thing is that
[50:04] wonderful about God he can't give it to
[50:07] you it's wonderful when he tells you I
[50:09] can't understand why it's not for right
[50:12] now in church even if he doesn't tell us
[50:14] why certain things have in our life we
[50:16] know they'll tell us better will
[50:17] understand it better by and by we know
[50:20] perhaps that that's part of the reward
[50:21] of believer he'll be letting us know all
[50:23] of our questions and answers for all
[50:25] eternity if he's an eternal being it
[50:27] takes an eternity to know again but we
[50:34] love how God saw at your mercy it's not
[50:37] time to reveal it it's not gonna reveal
[50:39] it it'll tell us just not for right now
[50:41] he said these are closed and sealed up
[50:44] so see how I have to be the breaking of
[50:46] the seven seals and Lucido the seals
[50:49] need to be broken in that morgue amen
[50:54] other than until the time of the end
[50:56] which he told us was running to and fro
[50:58] and knowledge increased you know that
[51:00] end time verse 10 a good person many
[51:04] shall be purified to the end time they
[51:05] shall be purified and made white and
[51:08] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[51:12] and none of the wicked shall understand
[51:15] but the wise shall understand in that
[51:19] blessing you and I can understand God's
[51:20] Word why his we're spiritually wise by
[51:23] his Spirit right the simplicity of God
[51:26] mask on the view yourself dose and your
[51:28] simplicity and God always knives himself
[51:30] in simplicity it's the honor and glory
[51:32] of kings to search out a man or praise
[51:34] God that's the glory of Kings to fight
[51:37] it amen because we're kings of reefs
[51:39] spiritual kings and future kings
[51:41] physically we know in the future home
[51:43] Lord willing by God's grace
[51:45] we'd be privileged to be a part of that
[51:47] she's one of the rewards was rule over
[51:50] nations remember that being a king
[51:52] ruling over nation that's one of the
[51:53] were the amazing rewards to the believer
[51:56] so again we see how important your works
[51:58] are whenever we're talking to preach on
[52:00] that lately well I know that works the
[52:02] wicked will do wickedly the righteous do
[52:05] righteously
[52:06] the lies will be wise with God's Word
[52:08] amen now we're so thankful to understand
[52:11] the words of Daniels book by the opening
[52:13] of the Seventh Seal so you can only come
[52:15] that way by God's grace verse 11 is the
[52:19] last well the last verse talks about the
[52:23] daily sacrifice so let's look at verse
[52:26] and I am I put all the quotes on the
[52:30] daily sacrifice in Wednesday's sermons
[52:32] so if you don't watch that there's I
[52:34] think there's three or four quotes on
[52:36] that that I read how the Antichrist
[52:37] breaks the Covenant and takes away the
[52:39] daily sacrifice so I didn't put them on
[52:41] here but they were on their own
[52:42] Wednesday we went over that Outlands day
[52:44] so wherever you go she could read those
[52:46] one was from the first seal I don't know
[52:48] it's for the Daniel series another
[52:51] question answer 64k alright verse 11 and
[52:55] from that time that the daily sacrifice
[52:58] shall be taken away and the abomination
[53:00] that maketh desolate set up program said
[53:04] that's Rome over spreading and taking
[53:06] over the temple but man said it's the
[53:07] overspreading of the Roman abomination
[53:10] so he breaks the covenant takes away
[53:13] their sacrifice and then he fills the
[53:15] temple and he sits in the temple and
[53:17] says that he is God program so that's
[53:18] the role in overspreading of
[53:20] abominations they meant Rome taking over
[53:23] the house of God high striking
[53:27] he says from the time from that time the
[53:30] other sacrifice to the foundation making
[53:32] desolation set up there shall be a
[53:34] thousand two hundred and ninety days now
[53:40] this would be a thousand PMS three half
[53:43] years plus 30 days so 1290 is three and
[53:48] half years plus another month okay my
[53:51] math is right 30 days in a month so this
[53:56] tells us that after for three and a half
[53:58] years there's still a month
[54:01] gonna happen with Rome with the
[54:02] Antichrist there's still a month in that
[54:04] space you haven't finished the last half
[54:07] of the 70th week then there's a month
[54:09] where the overspreading of abominations
[54:11] perhaps the war you know with Israel
[54:14] Rome there and Russia a lot of things
[54:16] going on there's another month for that
[54:18] time there's a lot to happen in a month
[54:21] you know that now verse 12 blessed is he
[54:25] that waiteth and cometh to the thousand
[54:27] three hundred and five and thirty days
[54:30] so beyond this we're given 1335 days so
[54:35] even so beyond the three half years into
[54:37] two months which one of the months is
[54:39] mentioned right here 1290 days so beyond
[54:43] so once the once God finishes a 70th
[54:46] week there's still two months and 15
[54:48] days for things to happen plenty of time
[54:51] right to claim time for things that
[54:52] happen this wouldn't be a reveal or this
[54:54] would involve things with the Antichrist
[54:56] Rome Russia the destruction of Babylon
[54:59] in Revelation 18 there's a lot of things
[55:01] that happen so there's you know 45 days
[55:03] there I'm sorry 60 75 days there for
[55:07] lots of things to happen after the
[55:09] prophets are raptured up right is after
[55:11] their ministries over 3 up here's they
[55:12] die the raptured up and then there's
[55:14] still 75 days for things to happen after
[55:17] the two prophets go off the scene
[55:18] Israel's got to be born and as a as a
[55:20] nation you'll got to receive the Holy
[55:22] Ghost so the Bible Lots that extra time
[55:25] that's for 75 days after the three and a
[55:28] half years of series last verse but go
[55:33] that way until the end be for thou shalt
[55:35] rest and stand in thy lot at the end of
[55:39] the days
[55:40] so Daniels told he said go their way
[55:43] it's sealed up not guilty now he said go
[55:46] your way you're gonna rest you're gonna
[55:47] have to go to the grave right and then
[55:49] you're gonna stand in your lives he's
[55:51] gonna stand at the white throne judgment
[55:53] right as a believer he'll stand there in
[55:55] his portion and just like you and I are
[55:57] going to stand in our portion right
[55:58] we'll stand the Laodicea gonna have said
[56:01] every messenger will stand with his age
[56:03] and God will judge the church age first
[56:06] by the messenger right because Paul said
[56:10] I'm gonna present you as a chaste virgin
[56:12] to Christ how many glad that will
[56:15] standing right there my brother branham
[56:16] you glad about that did he preach the
[56:18] wall breaks they're arresting on that
[56:20] they even had we're resting on that
[56:22] whilst in an r-la are later see a lot
[56:25] and there's brother Brennan as the
[56:27] messenger the seven star car age and
[56:29] he'll say I preach exactly what Paul
[56:31] preached day many and will stand there
[56:33] and answer the beer awards given out of
[56:35] course you know then the marriage supper
[56:37] and then the millennial reign and then
[56:40] the white throne judgment and then the
[56:42] future home how many bring folks with a
[56:44] lot God has given you photograph said
[56:46] it's God would ask me anytime to preach
[56:48] what you would have preached he said I
[56:50] would appreciate this time this lot
[56:52] because this is the fulfillment and the
[56:55] conclusion of all of the prophets spoke
[56:57] of that they really been right now what
[57:00] amazing time to live it right a glorious
[57:01] time for the believer it's the most
[57:03] awful time for the sinner what's the
[57:05] most glorious time for the believer
[57:07] let's in our feet praise God
[57:17] so how do you feel on the Book of Daniel
[57:19] ready feel good about it by God's grace

[58:32] all human history the second coming of
[58:35] Jesus Christ Lord we're not just one man
[58:39] like II neither Elijah would have a body

[1:04:40] tonight you have time for a quick test
[1:04:42] okay nice rhetoric that's when I got an
[1:04:46] email the other day on one of the videos
[1:04:48] we put there on Facebook or on YouTube
[1:04:50] and just so you know also I've got the
[1:04:54] serpent see part one done and I've
[1:04:57] already got a little bit good feedback
[1:04:58] on that this week I should get parts two
[1:05:00] and three done already got a hundred
[1:05:02] views that's pretty encouraging and but
[1:05:05] the testimony we do pretty good almost
[1:05:07] have a hundred fifty thousand views on
[1:05:09] all those message videos don't you like
[1:05:11] that I'm just really so here's the
[1:05:15] testimony a woman named Amy said she
[1:05:19] watched our modest clothing in the Bible
[1:05:21] videos and she was completely convicted
[1:05:23] I want to change her entire wardrobe she
[1:05:25] said she'd have any money I said we'll
[1:05:26] have you tried Goodwill and here's her
[1:05:28] testimony she sent this morning at 1
[1:05:30] a.m. out of the baby she lives 3 hours
[1:05:32] of the other but God's amazing she
[1:05:34] forgot she had a 25 dollar income tax
[1:05:37] check come in and then she unexpectedly
[1:05:39] got 500 and her deposit so she went to
[1:05:42] Goodwill and found seven skirts and
[1:05:44] seven shirts and she sent me a picture
[1:05:46] her old wardrobes changed and now she's
[1:05:49] dressed like a saint this want to share
[1:05:52] that with you you know I hope we never
[1:05:54] asked for testimonies but it sure is
[1:05:55] good when God backs up his wording that
[1:05:58] you see lives change
[1:05:59] remember go read the Bible Jesus said
[1:06:01] programs the same thing a woman the
[1:06:03] dress immodestly
[1:06:04] and presents herself like that should be
[1:06:07] guilty of adultery on the day of
[1:06:09] judgment so Church of this thankful
[1:06:12] they're good to see God changing lives I
[1:06:14] couldn't go preach to her but God use
