[0:00] purpose again is to increase our faith
[0:02] now today's not going to be so much
[0:04] rah-rah amen amen you know
[0:06] that's a that's one kind of mighty
[0:08] the other kind of mighty is getting
[0:10] through sufferings that's kind of mighty
[0:11] i'm going to deal with tonight
[0:13] because you are you need the same
[0:15] mightiness to get because is that even a
[0:16] word uh we need the same mighty power to
[0:19] get through trials just like we need the
[0:21] same mighty trial to take down giants
[0:22] that's right
[0:24] the same holy spirit can be mightiness
[0:26] both ways that's right
[0:28] okay so i want to just increase our
[0:30] faith that we can uh
[0:33] serve god miley if you have your bibles
[0:34] go to second corinthians 11. i'm going
[0:36] to just read through this whole chapter
[0:37] it's not too long
[0:38] i want you to look at how god's power
[0:41] worked through paul
[0:43] mightily
[0:46] and i spelled mightily wrong there i
[0:48] don't mean that why
[0:49] i'm a first grade teacher nature so i'm
[0:51] always great in spelling test
[0:54] ah i miss my own spelling so i get a b
[0:56] minus on this one
[0:59] if you want to grade me give me a b okay
[1:01] i didn't earn it hey this time
[1:04] uh second ordean is 11 please
[1:09] again this week i had a guy from
[1:10] overseas make a video about me
[1:13] bashing me you know because i don't i
[1:14] don't i only believe three out of the
[1:16] seven major visions are fulfilled
[1:19] so he made a whole video an hour-long
[1:20] sermon bashing me the whole time i
[1:22] didn't even listen to it oh my god i
[1:23] don't care
[1:24] let them say what they love
[1:26] i explained it perfectly i explained not
[1:28] perfectly i've explained it the best
[1:29] that i know on there
[1:31] if the first three visions were uh you
[1:34] no one around the world could doubt the
[1:35] first three visions fulfillment
[1:37] if the first reader like that i believe
[1:39] the rest will be like that
[1:41] and there's still no one there's still
[1:43] no driverless car where there's no
[1:44] steering wheel and families driving
[1:46] around
[1:47] that cannot be proved around the world
[1:49] same thing with the fifth the leaf dress
[1:51] the leaf dressed the fig leaf dress
[1:55] and then uh
[1:56] the woman ruling america with absolute
[1:59] power and the nation is bowed to this
[2:01] woman that has not happened yet
[2:03] that's my opinion so just let's share
[2:05] with you you know you stand for
[2:06] something you're gonna be criticized but
[2:08] you know what you're gonna get
[2:08] criticized whether you stand or not
[2:10] right so you should stand on your
[2:12] convictions as they go back to the word
[2:14] and then stand above the criticism with
[2:16] love
[2:17] they'll draw me out of the circle i'll
[2:18] draw them back in the message right they
[2:20] draw me out
[2:22] because i got the love of jesus
[2:24] i don't know what they got but i got the
[2:25] love of jesus christ
[2:29] now um so we see paul says
[2:33] even in
[2:34] the warning of men
[2:36] and even in his teaching it was god's
[2:39] spirit working in him mightily
[2:42] so what are we saying in every detail of
[2:43] your life god wants to work in us
[2:45] mightily
[2:48] there's not a day where he doesn't want
[2:50] to show his power in us
[2:52] now we and we're not to expect you know
[2:54] the debt being raised every day like i
[2:55] said it's a generational thing you know
[2:58] uh
[3:00] but we can still see god's power
[3:02] working in us changing us changing
[3:04] situations changing our thoughts about
[3:06] things right making us more forgiving
[3:08] more loving praise god giving us
[3:10] warnings praise god
[3:12] not to go a certain direction
[3:14] okay but it works in us as we labor for
[3:17] christ and we strive against the flesh
[3:21] it's the holy spirit working in us
[3:23] mightily praise god
[3:25] we've got to keep fighting we've got to
[3:27] keep striving praise god
[3:30] no second corinthians 11.
[3:32] verse one now this is an interesting
[3:34] chapter paul uses sarcasm in the sket in
[3:36] this chapter if you haven't read it for
[3:38] a while i've read it listen to it read
[3:39] it today
[3:41] he's trying to correct the corinthians
[3:43] they have accepted these false apostles
[3:47] and as you read the text they're
[3:49] exalting themselves they're prideful
[3:50] preachers like we've been dealing with
[3:52] right
[3:52] i thought wow this is so similar to what
[3:54] we're dealing with today
[3:55] they were exalting themselves and their
[3:58] credentials but paul says they were
[4:00] false apostles
[4:02] would to god he could uh
[4:04] bear with me a little my folly and
[4:07] indeed bear with me
[4:08] you're going to see his folly as he's
[4:10] going to start boasting about himself
[4:12] because that's what they were doing they
[4:14] were the false and he was trying to
[4:15] prove to the church that he started
[4:17] the false apostles are boasting now i'm
[4:19] going to boast if you want some boasting
[4:21] i'm going to give you a boast
[4:23] right because
[4:25] he's saying it seems like you only want
[4:27] boasting you're so immature you're so
[4:29] carnal you just want people to boast so
[4:31] he said i'm going to boast
[4:34] for i'm jealous over you with godly
[4:36] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[4:37] husband that i may present you as a
[4:39] chaste virgin to christ so paul says i
[4:41] started the church in holiness but now
[4:43] it's gotten off the mark and i'm jealous
[4:45] over it the church remember a few months
[4:47] ago
[4:48] when i preached those 24 heirs that
[4:50] preacher preached at a church that i
[4:51] love remember that
[4:54] what was that that was godly jealousy
[4:56] i spent hours and hours going over that
[4:58] man's sermon 24 heirs brother william on
[5:01] one sermon there's probably more
[5:03] i wrote to him i called him on the phone
[5:06] i sent the letter he wouldn't budge on
[5:08] one of them that show me had the wrong
[5:10] spirit
[5:11] and then god vindicated months later
[5:13] that i was right and he was wrong
[5:15] god vindicated god always backs up his
[5:16] word
[5:18] so that's an example where i had
[5:20] jealousy over a church amen godly
[5:22] jealousy praise god god used me to move
[5:25] in that church and start that church i'm
[5:27] standing up for that church by god's
[5:28] grace
[5:29] but i fear lest by any means as the
[5:31] serpent begotten he through his
[5:32] subtility so your mind should be
[5:34] corrupted from the simplicity that's in
[5:36] christ
[5:38] so paul said the church got deceived
[5:40] just like eve got deceived with a little
[5:41] lie
[5:42] just a little lie through the whole
[5:44] church off
[5:45] that's why church when they make
[5:46] statements about brother branham and
[5:48] exalt brother brandon or exalt
[5:49] themselves even a little bit that's
[5:50] wrong the holy ghost will not do that
[5:55] not even a little bit
[5:56] he will not share his glory with another
[5:58] amen
[5:59] verse 4 fred he if he that cometh
[6:01] preaches another jesus whom we have not
[6:03] preached or if he received another
[6:05] spirit when we've not received an or
[6:06] another gospel which he have not
[6:08] accepted he might bear with him look
[6:10] he's saying when when people preach
[6:11] false doctrines you bear with them
[6:13] you shouldn't bear with them
[6:15] right
[6:17] for i suppose i was now look at this i
[6:19] was not a whip behind the very cheapest
[6:21] apostles
[6:23] now look he's starting to boast nice
[6:25] not not in the evil way but he's
[6:26] starting to tell them the real things
[6:28] about his ministry
[6:29] i am not at least wit i'm nothing behind
[6:33] the very cheapest apostles which would
[6:35] be peter
[6:36] right
[6:37] james john
[6:39] bartholomew
[6:41] all these mighty men of god he said i'm
[6:42] not even the least behind them now later
[6:45] he says i labored more than all but
[6:46] earlier in the other level he said i
[6:47] labored more than all
[6:49] but these people are so blind to see if
[6:50] he said i've got if you're they're going
[6:52] to accept braggers i've got to tell you
[6:53] exactly what god's had me do in my life
[6:55] i'm going to testify here for a minute
[6:58] now look at verse 6 though i be rude in
[7:01] speech
[7:02] so see he wasn't a simple person in
[7:04] speech the other guys were way more
[7:06] eloquent
[7:07] eloquent there it is
[7:10] i forgot
[7:12] i feel like paul i'm on paul's side how
[7:14] they do
[7:16] so the other guys the false apostles
[7:18] were they talked way better they
[7:20] preached way better
[7:22] but he said i'm not i'm just simple in
[7:23] my life am i preaching
[7:25] i'm just simple
[7:28] yet not in knowledge yeah i know the
[7:30] word of god
[7:31] i preach simple but i know the word of
[7:33] god amen
[7:35] but we have been thoroughly made
[7:36] manifest among you in all things have i
[7:39] committed an offense and abasing myself
[7:40] that ye might be
[7:42] exalted see because i preached to you
[7:45] the gospel of god freely
[7:47] so he asked them is the reason you're
[7:49] against me is because i don't take money
[7:50] from you
[7:53] because they're used to these preachers
[7:54] pulling on them for money
[7:56] look at that
[7:59] verse eight he said i robbed other
[8:01] churches taking ways to them to do you
[8:03] service of course it doesn't mean robbed
[8:05] but what he means is that the other
[8:07] church who gave me the blessings they
[8:09] were already poor to begin with so it
[8:11] was like robbing them
[8:12] they were already poor
[8:15] it was the it was the philippian church
[8:17] because he says it later the macedonian
[8:18] church we preached on that you know
[8:19] years ago a couple years ago
[8:24] and when i was present with you and
[8:25] wanted i was charged with no man paul
[8:27] would not take anything from any man
[8:31] see
[8:32] he wouldn't tell him i'm hungry he
[8:33] wouldn't tell him i'm thirsty he
[8:34] wouldn't tell him i need new clothes he
[8:36] was chargeable to no
[8:38] man for that which was lacking to me the
[8:41] brother which came from macedonia
[8:43] supplied so in other words if you really
[8:45] remain humble and trusting god god will
[8:47] provide for you amen you might just
[8:49] suffer you might have to wait but god
[8:50] will provide amen
[8:54] and in all these things i have kept
[8:56] myself from being burdensome unto you so
[8:58] i will keep myself see a real christian
[9:00] doesn't want to be a burden on other
[9:01] people a real christian wants to serve
[9:03] other people amen
[9:06] see verse 10 as the truth of christ is
[9:10] in me no man shall stop me of this
[9:11] boasting in the regions of my chao
[9:13] wherefore because i love you not god
[9:15] knoweth
[9:16] no because i love you
[9:18] he said i did all this i love you and
[9:19] show you what a real apostle a real
[9:21] preacher is
[9:25] verse 12 but what i do that i will do
[9:28] that i may cut off occasion from them
[9:30] that desire occasion
[9:32] so i'm just going to start listing
[9:33] things so they can say nothing against
[9:35] me
[9:36] right no occasion against me that where
[9:39] in their glory they may be found even as
[9:41] we
[9:43] for such are no look what he calls these
[9:44] scriptures that are receiving false
[9:46] apostles deceitful workers transforming
[9:48] themselves and the apostles of christ
[9:50] and no marvel for satan himself is
[9:52] transformed into an angel of light
[9:55] so anyone that would speak against paul
[9:57] he says was a
[9:59] uh was a satanic preacher right was a
[10:02] false apostle and anyone who changes the
[10:05] gospel of paul today is a false preacher
[10:07] that's right unless they're ignorant
[10:10] or they got a complex let me give a let
[10:11] me give some more grace
[10:13] because i'm not perfect i make mistakes
[10:16] so either a false apostle or they
[10:18] they're ignorant they don't know about
[10:20] scriptures or quotes yet
[10:22] uh
[10:24] or they got a complex yep that's the
[10:25] third one
[10:30] verse 15. there therefore it is no great
[10:32] thing if his ministers also be
[10:34] transformed as the ministers of
[10:35] righteousness whose end should be
[10:37] according to their work so watch their
[10:38] works watch their doctrines
[10:42] verse 16. i say again let no man think
[10:44] me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool
[10:47] receive me then i may boast myself a
[10:48] little so you see i'm being sarcastic
[10:51] i'm bragging here just so you under
[10:53] you'll listen to me
[10:55] he's the one that started the church
[10:56] that which i speak i speak it not after
[10:58] the lord but as it were foolishly in
[11:00] this confidence of boasting so see the
[11:02] lord didn't tell me do this i'm just
[11:03] trying to boast so you'll listen to me
[11:06] because that's what you always receive
[11:07] you receive boasting and you receive
[11:08] other gospels
[11:10] and i'm jealous over you that you left
[11:12] the simplicity that is in christ
[11:16] verse
[11:17] 18 seeing that many glory after the
[11:19] flesh i will glory also so these false
[11:21] preachers were preaching fleshly lust
[11:25] so money easy living right prosperity
[11:28] they were preaching fleshly things
[11:31] fleshly blessings all the time
[11:36] verse 19 for ye suffer fools gladly
[11:39] seeing you receive seeing you you
[11:41] yourselves your wives at church that's
[11:43] what i've seen when when when these some
[11:45] of these false preachers they go to
[11:46] churches and i hear people amen like i
[11:47] just get really some holy indignation
[11:51] right the spirit of god stirs up with me
[11:52] how can these people receive it
[11:55] the lies
[11:57] but you know what jesus christ is the
[11:58] same yesterday today and forever the
[12:00] same spirits that were in paul's day are
[12:02] here today amen
[12:03] people love to have their ears tickled
[12:05] yes
[12:07] now i want to raise your faith too i
[12:08] don't appreciate how to raise your faith
[12:10] at the same time if there's sin in the
[12:11] camp we gotta cut it out praise god
[12:14] it's not to exalt our flesh but they
[12:17] gladly receive false preachers
[12:20] anything that makes them feel good
[12:21] they'll receive
[12:22] it for ye suffer if a man bring you into
[12:25] bondage
[12:26] they won't suffer they will allow a man
[12:28] to bring them into bondage to sins if a
[12:30] man devour you if a man take you if a
[12:32] man exalt himself if a man smite you on
[12:34] the face
[12:35] they'll allow preachers to bat the
[12:37] preachers to bash the congregation just
[12:39] disrespect the congregation and they'll
[12:42] gladly receive it
[12:44] it's true
[12:46] it's true i mean you see the the the
[12:47] million dollar million televangelists
[12:49] they do that all the time they bash the
[12:50] people they mock the people
[12:52] like oh you didn't hear me i'm going to
[12:54] say that again
[12:56] maybe they're just praying about it
[13:00] maybe you said something wrong
[13:02] see they exalt themselves and the but
[13:04] the false people they love to have it so
[13:06] they love lies
[13:08] just give me the fleshy desires that i
[13:09] desire just
[13:10] tell me that's okay to have those fleshy
[13:12] desires
[13:15] i speak as concerning reproach as though
[13:17] we had been weak
[13:18] how be it wherever and he is bold i
[13:21] speak foolishly i am bold also so he's
[13:23] making himself foolish he's boasting on
[13:25] himself to prove a point
[13:29] now look verse 22 here's what they were
[13:30] bragging on are they hebrews so am i
[13:32] they were oh we're jews so now we know
[13:35] so they were claiming oh we're closer to
[13:37] jesus because we're jews they're playing
[13:39] the race card
[13:41] now today be oh i'm better because i'm
[13:43] an american i'm from brother branham's
[13:44] uh
[13:45] home country
[13:47] or i'm in brother and his family or i
[13:49] met brother branham
[13:50] yeah something like that to exalt
[13:52] themselves as greater than you just by
[13:54] something carnal something fleshly
[13:58] see
[13:59] are they israelites so am i are they the
[14:01] seed of abraham so am i see they were
[14:03] bragging all these things look i'm a jew
[14:05] i'm a seed of abraham mother see you
[14:07] should listen to me not paul
[14:09] are they ministers of christ i speak as
[14:11] a fool i am more in labor's more
[14:13] abundant in prisons above measure i'm
[14:17] sorry stripes above measure in prisons
[14:19] more frequently and deaths off
[14:23] i'm going to put a picture up here
[14:25] this was a man during the 1800s for
[14:27] slavery
[14:29] this i've seen this picture in high
[14:30] school
[14:32] over 20 years ago and this picture has
[14:33] never left my mind whenever i think of
[14:35] slavery my mind goes right there
[14:37] this is what the masters would do to
[14:38] them now with this in mind read the
[14:40] scripture verse 24 of the jews five
[14:44] times received by 40 stripes save one
[14:48] that's 195 lashes
[14:52] jesus got 39.
[14:55] in the church said
[14:59] paul though got 195. now i read i was
[15:02] listening to preachers and historians
[15:04] they were saying many people many uh uh
[15:07] many prisoners died on the first
[15:09] whipping because they lost so much blood
[15:13] so paul's skin must have been so hard or
[15:15] whatever that he got with the first time
[15:17] it looked like that or maybe worse
[15:20] because remember again you put your
[15:20] hands up like that and they would whip
[15:22] you from the side so the uh the cat of
[15:25] nine tails would
[15:26] would would dig into your skin and then
[15:28] they would rip it
[15:30] five times
[15:32] most people would die the first time but
[15:34] he would get one he'd heal can you
[15:36] imagine going back what would the scars
[15:38] i mean those are awful scars but i would
[15:40] imagine that's probably something like
[15:42] paul had
[15:43] if not more paul probably had it
[15:45] everywhere shoulders arms he probably
[15:47] had this whole thing
[15:48] i think that's branding i'm not sure
[15:51] five times
[15:53] and paul's trying to he's trying to get
[15:55] them to see i'm a real minister of
[15:56] christ
[15:58] i'm not preaching the desires of the
[15:59] flesh
[16:00] i'm preaching the desires of the holy
[16:02] spirit amen
[16:03] i'm a true apostle a true preacher
[16:10] he went to prison often he said these
[16:12] guys never go to prison
[16:14] right these guys don't suffer these guys
[16:16] are accepted by everybody i'm not
[16:20] see thrice i was beaten with rods three
[16:23] times being with rods
[16:28] once i was stoned now the preacher had a
[16:30] good point jobs isn't a preacher preach
[16:32] on this
[16:33] jews stone people often
[16:35] if you blasphemed as a child you could
[16:37] be stoned
[16:39] if you disrespected your parents you
[16:40] could be stoned remember they came to
[16:42] jesus let's stone this woman call it
[16:43] adultery but they didn't bring the man
[16:45] so he discerned their spirit there's a
[16:47] wicked spirit right
[16:48] they knew how to stone people they
[16:50] stoned paul and lystra if i'm not
[16:52] mistaken
[16:53] they thought he was dead they left he
[16:55] was lying they're dead what seemed to be
[16:57] dead and then all of a sudden he gets up
[16:58] out of the stones
[17:00] can you imagine bashing someone
[17:02] watching someone bash with a stone
[17:04] they lying there still and all of a
[17:06] sudden get up and they're fine
[17:08] god was protecting this man
[17:10] he's trying to let these corinthians
[17:12] know i'm not a false preacher i'm a
[17:13] genuine preacher
[17:17] in other words god's power is working
[17:19] mighty in me
[17:20] amen
[17:24] thrice i was shipwrecked now and then
[17:27] this according to history this wasn't
[17:28] the one in acts 28. so now he's
[17:31] shipwrecked four times
[17:34] and he spent a whole day and night
[17:35] floating on a piece of wood waiting for
[17:37] someone to rescue him
[17:39] that's courage church that's courage
[17:43] a night the day i've been in the deep
[17:45] there it is verse 26 in journeys often
[17:47] in perils and waters
[17:48] in perils of robbers
[17:51] in perils by my own countrymen in perils
[17:52] by the heathen and perils in the city
[17:54] and perils in the wilderness and perils
[17:56] in the sea and perils among false
[17:57] brethren in weariness and painfulness
[17:59] and watching is often in hunger and
[18:01] thirst and fastings often in cold and
[18:03] nakedness
[18:04] beside those things that are without
[18:07] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[18:09] of all the churches so not only do i
[18:11] have all these problems but then i worry
[18:13] and i'm always burdened about all the
[18:14] churches and all their needs that they
[18:15] have
[18:18] so i'm suffering physically but i also
[18:20] have this spiritual
[18:22] burden for all the needs that i know are
[18:24] in other churches hungry sick afflicted
[18:27] persecuted that's right just like me in
[18:29] prison
[18:30] whipped
[18:32] there's a real man of god with the
[18:33] mighty power of god he said it works in
[18:35] me mightily yes yes yes see when god's
[18:38] word power is working in you you can
[18:40] fast you can pray
[18:42] praise god
[18:44] you can have burdens on your heart for
[18:45] other people amen amen that's why i had
[18:48] to repent today church and
[18:49] say lord i'm sorry when i saw this and i
[18:51] saw this 195 times i said lord forgive
[18:54] me for complaining about inflation
[18:57] forgive me for
[18:59] complaining
[19:01] i have no hardships compared to this
[19:06] my life is a cakewalk compared to this
[19:08] so i said god forgive me
[19:10] i shouldn't i shouldn't
[19:18] verse 29 who is weak and i am not weak
[19:20] see these brothers are all strong they
[19:22] talk about how strong they are who's the
[19:24] weak one i am
[19:26] who is offended and i burn not
[19:29] see they don't get offended
[19:31] everybody loves them everybody receives
[19:33] them but i'm the one who offends all the
[19:34] time and i get offended
[19:38] if i must needs glory i will glory of
[19:40] the things which concern my infirmities
[19:42] so it's a great difference
[19:44] the true preachers have suffering
[19:46] infirmity trials
[19:47] the false preachers did not
[19:50] everybody loved them
[19:52] they easily deceived people they they
[19:54] smote them on the face you know they
[19:57] they gave them fleshly desires it was
[19:59] clear to paul who was the real preacher
[20:08] he said i'll glory in my infirmities
[20:11] verse 31 the god and father of our lord
[20:13] jesus christ which is blessed by mark
[20:15] knoweth that i lie not
[20:17] he didn't lie about 195 whips he didn't
[20:20] live up
[20:22] and that's why glory that's why i can
[20:23] say later i bear in my body the marks of
[20:25] jesus christ
[20:28] he can take the shirt off for the
[20:29] brothers and say i have the marks
[20:33] jesus has branded me on his i'm his
[20:37] i've suffered for his name's sake
[20:39] i'm a chosen vessel glory to go to the
[20:41] gentiles hallelujah
[20:43] and he works in me mightily praise god
[20:46] may god work in us mightily
[20:49] i know it's a different age this is not
[20:50] the light age this is not the ox age
[20:53] this is the eagle age but we should
[20:54] still have the same spirit we should
[20:56] still have a feeling for the body of
[20:57] christ that's right
[20:59] and christians are being killed today in
[21:00] nigeria
[21:01] iraq iran uh
[21:04] some of the other ones
[21:05] china
[21:07] saudi arabia christians are being killed
[21:10] persecuted
[21:13] what's the other one i'm trying to think
[21:14] of you know they could get it
[21:17] pakistan
[21:18] pakistan
[21:19] nigeria oh yeah nigeria is awful it's
[21:21] probably the worst place in the world
[21:22] right now to be a christian
[21:24] bombing killing just
[21:26] mobs killing christians catholic anybody
[21:28] anybody in church we know god sees them
[21:32] we know god sees the martyrs
[21:34] whether wise or foolish virgin god sees
[21:36] them
[21:40] look in verse 32 look how he embarrasses
[21:42] himself in damascus the governor under
[21:45] eretas the king kept the city of
[21:47] damascus
[21:48] damascenes with a garrison desires to
[21:51] apprehend me so they set up a garrison
[21:53] they set up like an outpost in order to
[21:55] capture me
[21:56] they wanted to get me so bad
[21:58] verse 33 and through a window in a
[22:00] basket i was let down a wall like a baby
[22:03] right you put a baby in a basket you put
[22:06] groceries in a basket paul said i'm
[22:07] embarrassing myself i was i didn't go
[22:10] out and fight the garrison i didn't go
[22:12] uh i didn't make the garrison fall down
[22:13] their faces with a miracle i was let
[22:15] down like a little child in the basket i
[22:18] in other words i jumped out the back
[22:19] window
[22:21] this is a proof that i'm a real minister
[22:23] of christ
[22:24] not the guys that everybody accepts and
[22:26] claps for and stands up the guys that
[22:28] get rich and tell you you can live in
[22:29] the flesh you desires he said those are
[22:31] ministers of the devil
[22:34] what about today church
[22:35] yeah we know the ones outside the
[22:37] message we know them
[22:38] they're clearly ministers of the devil
[22:40] preaching the prosperity gospel
[22:43] but doesn't it work in the message ranks
[22:44] as well it sure does
[22:46] sure does
[22:50] i was let down by the wall and escaped
[22:53] his hands
[22:55] remember i read this on sunday we are
[22:57] troubled on every side
[23:00] yet we're not distressed so despite
[23:02] being whipped like that he would not be
[23:04] he would not feel forsaken can you
[23:06] imagine
[23:06] that he said we're perplexed but not in
[23:09] despair i've been with i've been whipped
[23:11] five times but i'm still not in despair
[23:14] i haven't given up my goodness
[23:17] i'm persecuted but i'm not forsaken
[23:21] i wonder if the angel lord would come
[23:22] and minister to paul after his whippings
[23:25] like jesus like the angel came to
[23:26] minister to jesus after his prayers
[23:29] i wonder
[23:30] how could you withstand a fifth time
[23:33] how could you withstand the second time
[23:34] the third time the fourth time the fifth
[23:36] time how could you withstand that
[23:38] except the power of god was with you
[23:41] i was persecuted but not forsaken i was
[23:43] cast down but not destroyed praise god
[23:46] hollywood so church no matter what we go
[23:48] through no matter the troubles that we
[23:49] go through we're not destroyed we're not
[23:52] forsaken he's still with us it's god
[23:54] working in us mightily to produce a
[23:57] character that christ is looking for
[24:00] hallelujah
[24:03] let me go to david here i'm not going to
[24:04] go too long here tonight i don't think
[24:05] so
[24:10] now we looked at these uh remember the
[24:12] mighty man scriptures on sunday you had
[24:13] a couple people listening to the sermons
[24:14] that they really liked among us i was
[24:15] like well praise the lord hallelujah
[24:19] yeah that's what i was embarrassed i was
[24:20] freaked out being a mighty man the next
[24:21] day i'm complaining about inflation a
[24:23] mighty man don't complain about
[24:25] inflation
[24:26] right
[24:27] i laugh but i'm ashamed of myself i'm
[24:29] not gonna complain about it
[24:31] i'm going to face it like a man
[24:33] right you know what a man i'm supposed
[24:34] to do
[24:36] if i get off maokai you remind me okay
[24:38] you hear me complaining
[24:40] remind me
[24:43] mighty men do not complain they stand up
[24:46] and fight
[24:48] remember the scripture you read watchy
[24:50] stand fast in the faith quit you like
[24:52] men be strong
[24:54] let all things be done with charity
[24:57] now i want to apply this to david's life
[24:58] because i want to just go back to david
[25:00] for a few moments here
[25:02] i was thinking about mighty men and
[25:03] what's going through my notes today
[25:05] which direction should i go should i go
[25:06] to the colossians and i just kind of got
[25:08] in this thought i really like this
[25:08] thought i want to just go through this
[25:10] here
[25:11] so david i want i want to show you this
[25:14] thought david was mighty
[25:16] before he even slew goliath
[25:18] church you can be mighty we can be
[25:20] mighty before the giant even comes down
[25:25] way before
[25:27] you can be mighty before this great
[25:29] obstacle your life that you were born to
[25:30] do you're born to overcome this trial
[25:33] born to defeat that uh the addictions or
[25:35] whatever more
[25:36] whatever you were born to do
[25:38] you can be mighty way before that
[25:41] as a teenager
[25:43] as a little child
[25:45] you can write letters to adults
[25:48] that's mighty in the scriptures praise
[25:50] god
[25:52] help them to overcome their addictions
[25:53] and the demons in their life you can do
[25:55] that as a child that's right
[25:58] i can pray to the walls come down
[26:01] until there's healing all around that's
[26:03] something i can do
[26:05] that's something we all can do
[26:07] so how did david become mighty as a
[26:10] teenager
[26:11] or as a boy
[26:13] he had to watch didn't paul say watch
[26:15] watchy
[26:17] now that he means everybody watch ye
[26:20] so everybody needs to watch
[26:22] everybody needs to watch
[26:23] but david would watch and protect the
[26:25] sheep
[26:27] okay so he was being a man he was
[26:29] learning how to be a mighty man a mighty
[26:31] man doesn't get your eyes off the value
[26:34] of the treasure a mighty man watches the
[26:36] treasure that's right
[26:39] right
[26:40] that's why jesus said i am not a hiring
[26:42] preacher
[26:44] i'm not a hiring
[26:45] shepherd i care about the sheep
[26:48] i stay with the sheep
[26:51] i'm not with the sheep just for money
[26:53] i'm with the sheep because i love them
[26:54] praise god
[26:57] that's what david had to learn a real
[26:58] man a mighty man watches over and
[27:01] protects his sheep
[27:04] that's what a real man does
[27:05] right
[27:06] [Music]
[27:07] david had to stand fast he had to be
[27:09] faithful
[27:10] he had to stand there now we know the
[27:12] story brother said some shepherds they
[27:14] actually slept in the gate of the
[27:16] sheepfold they became the gate they
[27:18] became the door and jesus said i am the
[27:20] door praise god
[27:22] they had to stand fast and then lay down
[27:24] you know at the night time to keep it
[27:25] all the sheep and the sheep fold
[27:27] and i've never seen that myself my
[27:28] brother makes it alluding to it he's
[27:31] seen it when he went overseas
[27:33] but you have to stand fast you have to
[27:34] watch and stand now what if you stand
[27:36] and close your eyes and try to fall
[27:37] asleep leaning up against
[27:39] a building
[27:40] you haven't done all right
[27:42] to do all you've got to watch and you've
[27:44] got to stand that's right
[27:46] stan means you're alert ready to go
[27:49] sitting down means you're resting or
[27:50] relaxing when america means you're
[27:51] working at a desk
[27:53] right
[27:54] on a computer
[27:56] but real work is standing and watching
[27:58] amen
[27:59] according to the bible with faithful
[28:00] shepherds like a shepherd work
[28:03] he said be brave he was brave because he
[28:06] would go rescue the sheep
[28:08] right
[28:09] he was strolling because he would not
[28:11] only be brave enough to go after them
[28:14] but he was strong enough to fight and
[28:16] win praise god amen
[28:18] hallelujah
[28:21] strong enough to slay a lion and a bear
[28:26] and the bible said do all things in love
[28:27] so that's when he would love his express
[28:29] his love to god by playing the heart
[28:31] amen
[28:33] hallelujah praise god the mighty man
[28:36] that all that trained all the other
[28:38] mighty man praise god this is how he
[28:40] became mighty all by himself watching
[28:42] the sheep
[28:44] look church he didn't have his dad to
[28:46] help him there right right
[28:47] it's nice to have your dad in church
[28:49] today
[28:51] but i don't have my dad here
[28:53] so we can all we can all be mighty
[28:54] praise god it's an extra blessing for
[28:56] you guys
[28:58] he didn't have his dad there
[29:00] all alone
[29:01] but he did have his dad there from
[29:02] heaven
[29:05] he did have his heavenly father with him
[29:06] praise god
[29:08] so where'd he get all of his might from
[29:10] his heavenly father
[29:13] trusting in god
[29:15] that's how you become a mighty man
[29:18] you watch you stand you're brave you're
[29:20] strong
[29:20] you do everything in love
[29:23] that's how a man becomes mighty
[29:28] he became mighty as a humble shepherd
[29:31] so no matter how humble your life is
[29:35] no matter how humble your job is
[29:37] no matter how humble your home is no
[29:40] matter how humble your car is or humble
[29:42] your bank account is
[29:44] it doesn't matter how humble
[29:46] or we say worthless your life seems god
[29:49] can still make you mighty
[29:52] you can still learn the spiritual
[29:54] lessons you need to learn to be strong
[29:56] in the lord
[29:58] and what he knew he went from glory to
[30:00] glory
[30:01] he went from mighty to being more mighty
[30:05] i wonder which one came first the lion
[30:07] or the bear
[30:10] barbados he was real nervous that first
[30:12] time right the first time he saw a line
[30:15] carry away to bite one of those sheep
[30:17] and carried away
[30:19] to go chase after a running lion
[30:22] but why do it because he did all things
[30:24] in love he loved that little sheep
[30:25] praise god
[30:27] hallelujah
[30:29] he'd do it
[30:30] but then after that victory the
[30:32] anointing was on him you know he was
[30:35] oh and this whole time he's already
[30:36] anointed king praise god part of this
[30:38] time he's anointed king yeah
[30:41] he he could he could he could have
[30:42] complained and said i'm the forgotten
[30:43] king
[30:45] i was anointed but now they forgot about
[30:47] me i thought i was supposed to be king
[30:50] well not when you want to be when god
[30:51] wants you to be
[30:54] i thought god was going to do miracles
[30:55] in the message he is but not when you
[30:56] want to do it when he wants to do it
[30:58] right
[30:59] praise god hey if i could do it like my
[31:01] man said if i could heal him i would
[31:03] if i could do a miracle i would but i'm
[31:05] not the one who does them you're not the
[31:06] one who does them it's jesus christ that
[31:08] doesn't matter
[31:11] we have all these promises but it's in
[31:13] god's good time hallelujah that's right
[31:17] but each day we can still go from glory
[31:18] to glory by doing our regular duties
[31:22] that god has called us to do and be
[31:23] faithful in them that's right
[31:26] faithful though
[31:28] different kind of mighty it's not the ra
[31:29] rat come on james come on you can slay
[31:31] giants
[31:33] oh this is how i get mighty and oh i can
[31:35] be mighty when i suffer yeah that's
[31:37] exactly right
[31:38] that's exactly right
[31:40] be mighty as we suffer mighty in the
[31:42] lord's strength like paul said um
[31:47] like he said i'm misquoting this but he
[31:49] says i die daily no that's a scripture
[31:50] but
[31:51] uh he said i and i always show the dying
[31:53] of the death of the lord in my body
[31:56] that the life of christ might be
[31:57] manifest in
[31:58] me every day where you die to yourself
[32:01] every day where you rest the lord i
[32:02] don't want to give this up but help me
[32:04] to give it up and then when you finally
[32:05] give it up that's god's mighty power
[32:07] praise god hallelujah amen
[32:11] you go from glory to glory from might to
[32:13] mormont
[32:15] just to hum your humble life
[32:18] first we should all be able to raise
[32:19] your hand and say i got a humble life so
[32:20] i know god can make me mighty amen
[32:24] which one of us are great ones which one
[32:26] of us are ceos with
[32:28] 10 billion or million people following
[32:30] us on instagram
[32:31] or twitter
[32:33] right none of us
[32:35] we're just humble people and so we are
[32:37] the candidates amen we're the ones god
[32:39] can use praise god if we'll let him
[32:42] teach us daily how to humble ourselves
[32:45] overcome our trials overcome our battles
[32:48] let him work in us mightily and
[32:50] accomplish all he wants to accomplish in
[32:52] this generation
[32:54] praise god
[32:59] he might call you to a hole in the wall
[33:01] church but you still have people come up
[33:03] and get repent and weep their way to
[33:05] calvary there
[33:07] he might call you to a nice bigger
[33:08] church he might call you to
[33:10] ren out of baptist church
[33:12] he might call you to lots of different
[33:13] things by going back to the home church
[33:15] amen
[33:17] have a church in somebody's house he
[33:18] might call you that
[33:20] it's so humble
[33:22] but yet god is in the midst of that
[33:24] praise god amen
[33:25] god was rejecting glory while dave was
[33:28] out there uh of feeding the sheep god
[33:30] was rejected by all those strong
[33:32] brothers that he had out there in the
[33:33] army they were all fearful but dave was
[33:36] getting faith built into him in his
[33:38] humble life praise god so can we praise
[33:40] god in our humble lives god can raise
[33:42] faith in our lives for to do great days
[33:44] praise god when everybody else is afraid
[33:46] amen
[33:51] glory
[33:53] now we see this idea here
[33:55] eliab the oldest of david's brothers
[33:58] number one he was number eight but his
[34:00] number one
[34:01] heard he spake under the man and eliav's
[34:04] anger was kind of against david said why
[34:06] came us down hither and with whom hast
[34:08] thou left those few sheep in the
[34:10] wilderness
[34:11] he rebukes him for his humble lifestyle
[34:14] but that was this but he'd already been
[34:16] anointed king
[34:18] see david had to remember i'm already
[34:19] anoint the king
[34:21] i'm already anointed
[34:23] he don't recognize it
[34:24] he was there he must have forgotten it
[34:26] praise god
[34:27] but he was there when i was annoyed
[34:28] today man yeah
[34:30] and then look he's badgering him oh you
[34:32] just got a few sheep little did he know
[34:34] he god was going to make him ruler over
[34:36] millions of people
[34:39] at that moment he just had a few but god
[34:41] said i see a heart in him i see a man
[34:43] after my own heart praise god
[34:45] and i'm going to take those few that
[34:46] he's favored with and i'm gonna make him
[34:48] ruler over millions of people that's
[34:50] right but elia couldn't see he was so so
[34:52] tall and handsome and so strong and
[34:54] taller than all the other men he
[34:56] couldn't see it he was so exalted in
[34:58] pride
[35:01] i know that pride and the naughtiness of
[35:03] that heart so the prideful one is
[35:05] accusing him of being prideful see that
[35:06] turtle
[35:07] that's why i know when these preachers
[35:08] accuse me
[35:10] i know that's actually the spirit on
[35:12] them that's right man right
[35:14] yeah yeah
[35:16] whatever they accuse me of that's
[35:17] exactly what exactly what their guilt is
[35:20] right
[35:24] they accused me of not believing the
[35:25] prophet they're the ones who don't
[35:26] believe the prophet
[35:28] because the prophet said the greatest
[35:29] preachers were the philadelphian
[35:30] preachers
[35:31] that's what the prophet said if you want
[35:33] to say what the tapes say i don't want
[35:34] to get into my my trials okay
[35:36] i know your pride noises are come down
[35:39] to the mighty see the battle oh you just
[35:41] want to be a big shot

[35:44] god amen
[35:49] i love what john gill says he's a
[35:50] preacher from the 1800 from the man age
[35:53] the best preachers the raps are the best
[35:55] writers
[35:57] i know that pride hardiness of heart
[36:00] he was too proud to keep the sheep
[36:02] that's what he was being accused of and
[36:04] wanted to advance himself in the army
[36:05] and make a figure there and thereby
[36:07] gratify his vanity which was the reverse
[36:10] of actually david's character so that's
[36:12] what satan will always do he'll always
[36:14] tell you well your real character is
[36:15] like this and it's a total lie
[36:17] right
[36:19] eliat was totally lying he was totally
[36:21] misjudging your character amen

[36:26] true character praise god man

[36:34] else is listening nobody's there it's
[36:36] just god and i i know my real character
[36:38] praise god the devil's trying to tell me
[36:40] i don't have a good character but i know
[36:42] my character i was there when i got
[36:43] saved i was there i got the holy ghost
[36:45] and god is with me at all times and god
[36:47] sees how i act when i'm all alone praise
[36:49] god
[36:50] amen same thing with david though
[36:52] somebody accuse you of something well i
[36:54] know how i live i'm i'm not here for my
[36:56] own glory
[36:58] we have to we have to so know god's
[37:00] heart and our character that we can
[37:01] overcome criticism about our character
[37:04] amen
[37:07] like i'll get back to me i know i don't
[37:09] take money on youtube i could monetize
[37:11] my videos and make a few thousand
[37:15] i've never asked for one life you always
[37:17] say give me a like subscribe i've never
[37:19] asked for one subscriber
[37:22] i know my character brother william
[37:24] amen i don't want their money
[37:26] i've only said share it if you feel led
[37:28] of the lord that's right that's all i've
[37:29] said
[37:31] hallelujah i know my character let the
[37:33] devil say whatever he wants yeah i love
[37:35] jesus amen i'm not just for money i'm in
[37:37] this anointing or to annoy other people
[37:39] yeah with the holy spirit praise god
[37:41] that god would anoint them
[37:42] see the devil will tell you that
[37:44] actually the opposite of your real
[37:45] character
[37:48] for such was his humility that though he
[37:50] was anointed look at this he was already
[37:52] anointed king he'd been for he was
[37:54] preferred and saw score saw love when
[37:56] david come to the the castle the palace
[37:59] because he get on the harp he started
[38:00] playing he sing like austin you know he
[38:02] sing like us
[38:03] standing in the fire
[38:05] and the holy and the holy spirit would
[38:07] anoint saul and the evil spirit would
[38:08] leave
[38:10] he was loved by the king
[38:13] rejected by his dad right
[38:16] he was anointed by the prophet that's
[38:18] right
[38:18] but yet
[38:20] when he wasn't needed he would just
[38:21] condescend go back to his humble
[38:23] lifestyle
[38:25] this is how you become mighty church
[38:26] right here
[38:29] whatever people need you you help them
[38:32] and afterwards you go right back to
[38:34] doing your regular
[38:36] routine
[38:38] i don't care how much anointing is on
[38:39] you dave if anybody's anointed more than
[38:41] us friday
[38:42] now i'm not talking about the soul now
[38:43] i'm not about the body the human spirit
[38:45] he had literal oil poured out and praise
[38:47] god to represent the holy ghost that was
[38:49] on him that's right to slay a lion in a
[38:51] bear which of us have done that none of
[38:53] us have done that right
[38:56] so you gotta get more anointing on his
[38:57] flesh than we have
[39:01] yeah that's how you know real character
[39:03] whenever someone wants to use me sure
[39:05] i'll help you out praise god
[39:07] and then when they're done god bless you

[41:56] blessed me somebody
[42:00] tens of thousands of free dollars in
[42:03] labor
[42:04] how can i not
[42:05] give thanks to god for it
[42:08] and try to take care of it a little bit
[42:12] see he had now purpose now that he was
[42:14] not
[42:15] it was it was not any bad principle in
[42:17] his heart to go against goliath but
[42:18] purely for the glory of god how can this
[42:21] man defy the armies of the living god
[42:25] and the honor of the people of israel
[42:27] who were both reproached they were being
[42:28] cursed at every day 40 days straight
[42:30] curse you i curse you he's like who's

[45:09] uh
[45:11] assignments that god gives us
[45:13] praise god

[45:23] have green pastures back in springtime
[45:26] early summer
[45:27] once fall hits
[45:30] trees start changing colors
[45:34] but he would sing about oh you leave me
[45:35] by still waters
[45:38] you leave me by my green pastures you
[45:40] restore my soul
[45:43] the lord is my shepherd i shall not lack
[45:46] i have everything that i need praise god
[45:49] out there and i look at yours he's got
[45:50] no friends other than animals
[45:52] and yet he says i don't lack any friends
[45:54] and the church said amen hallelujah
[45:58] like the the meetings that i had with
[46:00] the minister he's like hey i heard you
[46:02] he said you do dates with your wife he
[46:04] said can we join you and have a double
[46:05] date
[46:07] he said because we don't have any
[46:08] friends
[46:10] isn't that something
[46:11] i said sure brother you can join us man
[46:14] sometimes i feel like that too you know
[46:16] when i'm out but i'm not a church
[46:17] sometimes i feel like i don't have any
[46:18] friends you know it's okay i got my
[46:20] family
[46:22] but you know sometimes you just want to
[46:23] sit down across the table from somebody
[46:25] and
[46:26] how's your life going you know
[46:28] you just don't want any distractions
[46:29] like you just wish you could have some
[46:30] fellowship now david didn't have that
[46:32] benefit of that i don't know we don't
[46:33] know how long he come in home we don't
[46:35] know how where he slept all the time but
[46:37] most of his time was spent alone with
[46:39] god
[46:42] and this is how he grew mighty
[46:44] beside your mighty
[46:48] saul said you're not able to go against
[46:50] this philistine fighter for thou art but
[46:52] a youth
[46:54] and a man of and he a man of war from
[46:56] his youth and david said saul thy
[46:58] servant kept his father's sheep and
[47:00] there came a lion a bear and took a lamb
[47:02] out of the flock and i went after him
[47:05] and smote him and delivered it out of
[47:07] his mouth and when he rose against me i
[47:09] caught him by his beard and smote him
[47:11] and slew him
[47:14] there must be a certain spot you can hit
[47:16] on the line when you got him by the main
[47:18] i don't know brother there must be a
[47:19] certain spot you can hit to knock him
[47:20] out
[47:21] maybe it's poking him in the eye i don't
[47:23] know
[47:24] there must be something you can do
[47:25] because he was able to grab him
[47:27] smite him hit him and then kill him
[47:31] he said i'm not afraid of that i've
[47:33] i've defeated beasts i'm not afraid of
[47:35] this man
[47:40] thy servants through both the lion and
[47:42] the bear this uncircumcised philistine
[47:44] shall be as one of them singing at the
[47:46] five the army's living god now made a
[47:48] big difference he was a prophet so god
[47:50] showed him he was already gonna smile
[47:51] and praise god that makes a big
[47:52] difference
[47:55] like jesus said uh lord i know you hear
[47:57] me always and jesus and god show jesus
[48:00] that lazarus was coming out praise god
[48:02] amen
[48:03] it makes a big difference when you got
[48:04] that when you got a revelation but yours
[48:06] that's what we need we need to pray to
[48:07] god so we get a revelation amen amen do
[48:10] we know we're going to get the victory
[48:12] or i just feel god's going to answer
[48:14] this prayer that's when we can have
[48:15] confidence that's when faith drops down
[48:17] that's when faith moves mountains praise
[48:22] when it drops down
[48:23] hallelujah
[48:25] and we know god's going to move amen
[48:27] amen on our behalf
[48:31] david said moreover the lord that
[48:32] delivered over the self-existent one
[48:34] right there the self-existent one that
[48:36] delivered me out of the paul of the lion
[48:38] and the other paul the bear he would
[48:40] deliver me out of the hand of the
[48:41] philistine
[48:42] and saul said david go the lord be with
[48:44] thee amen and dave was like the lord's
[48:46] been with me since i got anointed all
[48:48] right
[48:49] he's been with me praise god
[48:51] he's not with me because you blessed me
[48:53] he's with me because god called me
[48:55] praise god
[48:56] he anointed me years ago
[48:58] now remember church after he defeated
[49:00] him saul said who is this ruddy guy
[49:02] he forgot that this was the guy that
[49:04] played the harp and got and cast devils
[49:07] off him he forgot the real preachers
[49:09] right
[49:10] he forgot the real man of god
[49:13] he got so caught up in things so high
[49:15] mighty he forgot god's deliverer that
[49:17] had already been sent to him
[49:20] he was so he was there it is he's so bad
[49:22] he was so bound by fear of goliath
[49:24] he was so bound by fear he's in other
[49:27] words he's in bondage again there it is
[49:28] he got free of bondage and then he went
[49:30] back into bondage
[49:32] and he forgot that god was a deliverer
[49:35] he forgot this guy's already delivered
[49:37] this guy's already oh deliver me from my
[49:38] evil spirit
[49:41] ma
[49:42] go and the lord be with thee
[49:45] now one thing i just thought of this is
[49:47] just my thought but
[49:48] david knew israel's history
[49:51] david would have known shamgar one of
[49:53] the judges
[49:54] took an ox goad
[49:56] and defeated 600 philistines well god
[49:59] was with that guy and god has anointed
[50:02] me to be king and i'm going to be king
[50:04] and this one not 600 one is standing in
[50:07] my life surely god will help me to beat
[50:09] this law and praise god if god
[50:19] [Applause]
[50:25] have already been slain
[50:26] what about yeah i even forgot about
[50:28] samson
[50:29] hallelujah
[50:31] samson got a thousand at one time praise
[50:33] god
[50:34] sixteen hundred if god can defeat
[50:36] sixteen hundred by two surely he can
[50:38] defeat one giant by a little humble
[50:41] shepherd because god loves to receive
[50:43] all the glory and god is the man of war
[50:45] praise god
[50:47] amen amen
[50:50] he just needs people surrendered in the
[50:51] battle
[50:52] that's right surrender to his holy
[50:54] spirit
[50:55] how many feel my more bodies we go on
[50:57] here
[50:58] amen
[51:00] god's grace
[51:03] he remembered joshua's words joshua said
[51:06] i'm going to skip because for a time he
[51:08] said cleave unto the lord these are
[51:09] joshua's second to last words his last
[51:11] words are in joshua 24.
[51:14] he said be courageous do all the word of
[51:16] god don't turn the left or the right i'm
[51:18] just breezing over these we're hitting
[51:20] the highlights
[51:21] do not be among the nations that remain
[51:23] among you
[51:24] don't make mention of their god see
[51:27] goliath was cursing him
[51:29] by his god
[51:30] and the bible said don't even mention
[51:32] their gods
[51:33] right and that's exactly what david did
[51:35] david said i don't come to you with sort
[51:37] of spirit i come in the name of the lord
[51:38] of hosts
[51:40] hallelujah
[51:43] don't bow down to them but cleave unto
[51:45] the lord your god as you've done this
[51:47] day for the lord i've driven out from
[51:49] before you these great nations and
[51:50] strong
[51:51] no man has been able to stand before you
[51:53] this day one man of you shall call will
[51:55] chase a thousand
[51:56] for the lord your god he it is that
[51:58] fighteth for you as he has promised you
[52:01] take good he therefore unto yourselves
[52:03] that you love the lord your god amen

[52:09] everything in love you strong men and
[52:11] women praise god amen

[52:23] just keep his commandments and love the
[52:25] lord your god and god will do a mighty
[52:26] work in our ministry

[52:52] all right you hear the year the good
[52:53] things you just go right back to your
[52:54] humble life just keep serving god

[53:01] the daily mess just keep serving god
[53:04] love god in the midst of your daily
[53:06] trials amen
[53:08] the bible said cleave to him
[53:10] be glued to his word praise god like
[53:12] that sword glue it to your hand amen
[53:14] don't let nothing take the sword out of
[53:15] your hand praise god
[53:17] one of you should have chased a thousand
[53:18] so david even had this scripture right
[53:20] there
[53:21] there you go
[53:22] one will whip a thousand
[53:24] surely i want one on one what are my
[53:26] odds with one on one
[53:28] if i can whip a thousand yeah i can whip
[53:30] one
[53:33] according to the bible all the odds were
[53:35] on david's side but that's not what man
[53:37] saw man saw what man sees david saw what
[53:41] god sees praise god david saw the
[53:43] promise of god the other soldiers just
[53:45] saw the actual numbers they saw the
[53:47] natural things david was looking at
[53:49] spiritual things praise god
[53:52] may god help us look at spiritual things
[53:53] amen
[53:54] look at the spiritual battles going on
[53:57] that's right
[53:58] what's the spiritual odds for us praise
[54:00] god
[54:01] i think they're pretty good don't you
[54:03] i think we've got good spiritual odds by
[54:04] god's grace we're more than conquerors
[54:06] in christ jesus
[54:08] be zealous therefore and repent and the
[54:10] bible says the church at laodicea if
[54:12] you're zealous and repent you'll be
[54:14] overcomers and then you'll sit with
[54:16] jesus on his throat as jesus sits on his
[54:19] father's throne praise god in other
[54:20] words god is finding character today
[54:22] that can judge right wrong praise god
[54:24] yes amen that's what he's looking for
[54:26] let us see as someone who can repent
[54:28] constantly and then judge the right
[54:30] decision keep their testimony hot and on
[54:32] fire for jesus and if they do that if
[54:34] they reign in this life he'll make them
[54:36] reign in the next life amen
[54:39] amen
[54:40] as he has promised you amen that's god's
[54:42] promise those are red letter words
[54:44] churches that right yeah
[54:46] red letter words
[54:49] i'm going to close this
[54:51] he that's faithful with the few sheep
[54:54] will be faithful with many millions of
[54:55] seconds that's right amen just be
[54:57] faithful with a few sheep
[54:59] amen
[55:00] you know what jesus said
[55:02] he that's faithful in that which is
[55:04] least what could be any lower than a
[55:06] shepherd nothing could be lower than a
[55:07] shepherd other than like a sinful thing
[55:09] like a
[55:10] harlot or a beggar or you know something
[55:13] some type of evil man like a murderer
[55:15] you know some type of evil thing like
[55:16] that
[55:18] but just as the regular jobs nothing
[55:19] could be lower than a show
[55:22] there's no fame in that
[55:24] because your only congregation is sheep
[55:27] your only fans are sheep and they don't
[55:28] give thumbs up on instagram
[55:31] right they don't give likes on youtube
[55:35] they're just sheep
[55:37] but you're if you're faithful in the
[55:38] least of things of life
[55:41] then he'll make you
[55:43] as the bible says he'll make you he will
[55:45] commit to you the true riches
[55:49] the world has it all wrong about what's
[55:50] true riches it's not money right it's
[55:53] not your riches
[55:54] it's not
[55:56] it's far from it
[55:58] because that's what that's what they
[55:59] want they want unread unrighteous mammon
[56:01] which means money
[56:03] if therefore you have not been faithful
[56:04] in the unrighteous money who will commit
[56:07] to you trust the true witches so he's
[56:09] telling us we should be faithful with
[56:10] our money
[56:11] right
[56:14] but if you're faithful with the little
[56:15] god has given you he will trust you with
[56:17] true riches
[56:20] and if you have not been faithful which
[56:22] is another man so if you can't work for
[56:23] a boss and you can't be faithful who
[56:25] shall give you that which is your own
[56:27] how are you going to get any blessings
[56:28] if you can't even handle somebody else's
[56:30] blessings
[56:32] that's what joseph had to do josh had to
[56:33] serve under potiphar right and then
[56:35] pharaoh and then he got exhausted right
[56:37] potiphar then he was faithful to prison
[56:39] to the butler baker
[56:40] he's exalted praise god amen
[56:44] god help us to be faithful in the least
[56:47] and then he'll come he'll accomplish let
[56:48] me say true riches in his time and
[56:50] season amen joseph true riches were
[56:53] saving the entire world from starvation
[56:56] east was sent to egypt to save life
[56:58] praise god that's right amen amen
[57:01] david got true riches not just feet and
[57:02] sheep come on here see there's some good
[57:04] water there's some good uh there's a
[57:06] good good grass and waters over here but
[57:08] now he's actually leading israel into
[57:10] battle
[57:10] and helping them conquer their enemies
[57:12] making them free they're no longer
[57:14] slaves to the philistines amen he's
[57:16] setting people free that's true riches
[57:19] amen freedom in the natural freedom and
[57:21] the spiritual and god said i'm giving
[57:23] you true riches david praise god amen
[57:25] because you are faithful with a few
[57:26] sheep i'm giving you true riches making
[57:29] free the souls of men
[57:31] amen
[57:34] can be fake with a few soulless sheep
[57:38] you'll be ruler over millions of souls
[57:40] that are worth ten thousand worlds
[57:41] apiece right because david's souls were
[57:44] ten thousand of the jew of the israelite
[57:46] souls that one soul was worth that many
[57:48] other ones
[57:50] because he was a man after god's own
[57:51] heart amen
[57:54] how many want to be faithful
[57:56] in church the beautiful thing about this
[57:59] anybody can do it
[58:00] that's the love about the gospel
[58:03] anybody can be faithful with a little
[58:06] and then any everybody they could have
[58:08] true riches in heaven
[58:10] and even true riches on this earth
[58:14] you know the rich young ruler came
[58:16] running to jesus he said i've kept all
[58:17] these commandments
[58:20] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[58:22] said one thing thou lackest go thy way
[58:24] sell whatsoever thou hast give to the
[58:26] poor and thou shalt have treasure
[58:29] in heaven
[58:30] in other words forsake your worldly job
[58:32] and come be a full-time preacher with me
[58:35] come be an apostle with me amen and i
[58:37] don't have a place to lay my head you're
[58:39] not going to have one you're not going
[58:40] to have the same pillow every night it's
[58:42] going to be a different pillow and some
[58:42] nights you won't have pillows
[58:45] he said foxes have holes birds have
[58:47] nests the son of man has no place to lay
[58:49] his head come follow me then you'll have
[58:51] great treasure in heaven
[58:53] i'm not asking you to sell your home
[58:56] i would never do that you got to have a
[58:57] home god bless you with a home yeah but
[58:59] i i am asking you to consider
[59:01] how can i give and how can i live for
[59:04] others to inherit true treasure in
[59:06] heaven that's right yeah that's right
[59:09] how can i do that
[59:13] i love the word of god it makes me happy
[59:15] i'm just happy i'm smiling
[59:17] amen because i i in my humble life i can
[59:20] still become mighty
[59:21] because i don't have to be a great
[59:23] person i can just be a humble person
[59:26] and each day god can teach me to humble
[59:28] myself
[59:31] build up my faith as we said last
[59:32] weekend build up that those tension
[59:34] moves as the tension builds up the power
[59:36] builds up right
[59:39] so i hope the tension has been building
[59:40] up for a few months here so when cam
[59:41] comes here we can have a
[59:43] the power can be
[59:44] released god amen i'm thankful for the
[59:47] time you know i know the holy spirit's
[59:48] been poured out on us numerous times
[59:49] when i've been preaching i love it god
[59:51] answers prayer we feel the presence of
[59:52] god we weep or we shout or something
[59:54] like that cry
[59:56] but i feel like we've been you know this
[59:58] tension's been building up and so it's
[59:59] time to release the power of god to
[1:00:01] release upon us praise god amen hey
[1:00:03] that's what i'm asking god for praise
[1:00:04] god
[1:00:06] see i'm asking us to look at what is
[1:00:08] true with riches
[1:00:10] in this case he was called not
[1:00:12] everybody's called to do it he was
[1:00:14] called to sell all his great possessions
[1:00:16] help the poor and then become a
[1:00:18] full-time missionary
[1:00:21] but then the bible said he turned
[1:00:23] and walked away sad
[1:00:24] because he had great possessions
[1:00:27] he wanted mammon more than true riches
[1:00:32] true riches would have been walking next
[1:00:34] to the son of god imagine
[1:00:36] watching the son of god be miracle after
[1:00:38] miracle
[1:00:40] watch this on a man
[1:00:42] teach the people watch the son of man
[1:00:45] put children on his left
[1:00:47] and teach the adult this is how you come
[1:00:48] in the kingdom of god
[1:00:50] walk on water
[1:00:52] but my goodness
[1:00:54] curse fig trees
[1:00:56] raise the dead praise god
[1:00:59] money was greater
[1:01:01] than following the son of god
[1:01:04] he missed out on true riches
[1:01:07] let's not miss out on true riches amen
[1:01:09] we have service after service year thank
[1:01:11] god thank god month after month year
[1:01:13] after year we have all this time to
[1:01:16] really understand what true riches are
[1:01:19] it's giving up your worldly desires and
[1:01:22] accepting the life the humble life that
[1:01:25] god has for you amen
[1:01:32] god reminded david where he brought him
[1:01:34] from
[1:01:37] and that's what god is doing tonight
[1:01:39] god's remembering god's reminding us
[1:01:41] where we came from
[1:01:45] so go to second uh samuel 7 verse 8.
[1:01:49] remember the
[1:01:50] story david starts he's king now both of
[1:01:55] uh judah and northern israel
[1:01:57] he starts whipping all his enemies
[1:02:01] nathan goes and says do all that's in
[1:02:02] your heart david
[1:02:05] and the prophet made a mistake
[1:02:06] because few prophets make mistakes yeah
[1:02:09] not with us say the lord but they make
[1:02:10] human mistakes
[1:02:12] which jeffersonville says prophets make
[1:02:14] no mistakes which they're taking quotes
[1:02:16] out of context there's a quote that says
[1:02:17] that but they're taken out of context it
[1:02:19] means they'll say the lord's statements
[1:02:26] they only like the quotes they like but
[1:02:28] i like all the quotes
[1:02:29] because we can rightly divide it by the
[1:02:30] holy spirit that's true and they can't
[1:02:32] they'll just say well i don't know i
[1:02:33] just leave everything on the team
[1:02:36] no you don't
[1:02:37] and i got a quote brother says that he
[1:02:39] said your actions prove you don't
[1:02:40] believe me amen he said you believe
[1:02:43] everything on the tape your actions
[1:02:44] prove you don't i want my actions to
[1:02:46] prove that i believe the tapes amen
[1:02:49] not just my words i just press play i
[1:02:51] don't know i just press play i believe
[1:02:52] everything on that's a lie
[1:02:54] my actions prove i believe because i'm
[1:02:56] able to labor in the word and take it
[1:02:57] back to the word of god amen
[1:02:59] search the scriptures daily whether
[1:03:01] those things are so that the prophet
[1:03:03] said that's right that's right that's
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:06] most people can't do that because
[1:03:07] they're lazy or whatever uh what riches
[1:03:09] of the world they want popularity fame
[1:03:11] that's fine they can do whatever they
[1:03:12] want i'm gonna accept god's humble life
[1:03:14] that he gave me amen second samuel 7
[1:03:17] verse 8
[1:03:18] remember the story
[1:03:21] now therefore
[1:03:23] so shalt thou say to my servant david
[1:03:24] thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee
[1:03:26] from the sheep co i took you from that
[1:03:28] humble smelly
[1:03:30] bloody and church you know with animals
[1:03:32] it's constant trouble
[1:03:35] constant trouble
[1:03:36] like we went to that
[1:03:38] that pennsylvania farm this summer and
[1:03:40] every day something bad happened with
[1:03:42] those animals
[1:03:43] some would get out
[1:03:45] someone headbutt us
[1:03:47] right i mean every day something happens
[1:03:50] so dave was in constant trials
[1:03:52] oh man we just had peace for five
[1:03:54] minutes and now the sheep are confusing
[1:03:56] again you know constant trials
[1:03:59] he said thus saith the lord remind david
[1:04:01] i took you from that humble place of
[1:04:02] being a shepherd
[1:04:05] from following the sheep you were
[1:04:06] they're supposed to be following you but
[1:04:08] you said you found them
[1:04:10] look at that to be ruler over my people
[1:04:12] israel and i was with you i love that
[1:04:14] church god is with you whatever thou
[1:04:16] went
[1:04:17] and have called all thy enemies out of
[1:04:19] thy sight and have made thee a great
[1:04:20] name like under the name of the great
[1:04:22] men that are in the earth
[1:04:28] that church what does david do i just
[1:04:30] want to close with this
[1:04:32] if you go down to verse
[1:04:35] uh i didn't really write that one down i
[1:04:36] was planning on reading this whole
[1:04:37] chapter but i didn't get time to do that
[1:04:49] yeah verse 26
[1:04:50] he says now that you kept your word he
[1:04:52] said and let thy name be magnified
[1:04:54] forever saying the lord of hosts is the
[1:04:56] god over israel and let the house of thy
[1:04:57] servant david be established forever
[1:05:01] for thou o lord of hosts god of israel
[1:05:03] has revealed to thy servant saying i
[1:05:04] will build thee in the house therefore
[1:05:05] have thy servant found in his heart to
[1:05:08] pray this prayer unto thee
[1:05:10] and now o lord god thou art that god and
[1:05:14] thy words be true and now has promised
[1:05:16] this goodness unto thy sermon
[1:05:18] let there
[1:05:19] i'm sorry therefore now let it please
[1:05:21] thee to bless the house of thy sermon
[1:05:22] that they may continue forever before
[1:05:24] thee for thou o lord god has spoken it
[1:05:27] and with thy blessing let the house of
[1:05:28] thy servant be blessed forever
[1:05:32] praise god
[1:05:34] so after god reminds him of his humble
[1:05:36] beginning this is i mean
[1:05:37] he'd been out of the sheets the
[1:05:38] sheepfold for a long time but god
[1:05:40] reminds him you i brought you from the
[1:05:42] sheepfold in other words he returns back
[1:05:44] to god and said praise god your name is
[1:05:46] magnified amen i remember where i came
[1:05:49] from i remember my humble be beginnings
[1:05:51] and i'm bringing praise and mag and
[1:05:53] magnifying your name i'm bringing praise
[1:05:55] back to your great name and he said do
[1:05:57] what you promised bless my house
[1:06:00] and then with all this anointing goes
[1:06:01] and whips the philistines the moabites
[1:06:04] and the syrians and then he says let me
[1:06:05] find someone someone from jonathan's
[1:06:07] family let me bless them and he blesses
[1:06:09] mephibosheth praise god in other words
[1:06:11] when god reminds you of where he brought
[1:06:14] you and you see all the blessings and
[1:06:15] you see how god has made you a believer
[1:06:17] a real believer you'll go and you'll
[1:06:19] find the battles greater you'll have
[1:06:21] more strength when you remember god's
[1:06:23] grace you'll praise god more when you
[1:06:25] remember where god brought you from
[1:06:26] church amen
[1:06:28] and you want to bless other people who
[1:06:29] can i bless who can i be a a help to
[1:06:32] because god has blessed me so much god's
[1:06:34] taken me from the lowest of the low and
[1:06:36] he's raised me up on high just as he
[1:06:37] promised if i humble myself i'll be
[1:06:40] exalted praise god amen amen let's take
[1:06:42] our feet praise god
[1:06:45] hallelujah
[1:06:48] thank you jesus
