Wednesday I'm just gonna need some time here we'll bring at least one service break a toxic 24 verse 35 says heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and here on the father Lord Jesus we study though we thank you for your grace mercy or God nor jesus lord thank you for blessing oh my god Lord with another child God yes Lord or Jesus Lord thank you Lord for allowing us go to speak this today God Lord no just enter into the minds of the people God or the suffering overseas cops yes where I live day by day god no we're just waiting reading waiting for the living how the week on you God reading for both the persecution or these these things Lord they can be trouble very very quickly God when we have a space free time and every single more give us a revelation is real last our work a quick short work revelation testifying everyone yes you know they were just the bestest those services you might have not taught this yet though it's no pressure we got just real simple thought a couple things Jesus Christ he prophesied as in the days of Noah so shall that is a son can be man as in the days of lot so shall the Son of man be and the last you know we've been the message now 1415 years and we've seen a lot of the same things that we see it know as they SC in the last day amen but I like what says Jesus said there he said heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away Genesis 1:1 where the where God created the heavens of the earth and the Bible says the word the God started speaking and one of his first sentences was let there be light and as that like my fourth the logos came forth out of the Father and now he is a father and now the son is standing before them and the father come down then and dwelt within the son and through the son of through that logos all of creation came through amen and through the logos the voice of God would speak right through that light to be create the Sun in the moon the heavens all of creation came out of this and uh as it was spoken behind those wordsworth faith it would have the faith of a man it was not a face of Karl face is not a face them or even a hope but it was a faith it was the face of the creature the faith of God himself so it was a faith of Jesus Christ amen and if there is a man that we could call faith it would be Jesus Christ a lot of my men in the world leading girls faith but the amen but he says my words shall never pass away so when he speaks something the word goes sport those vibrations however they come out of a spirit the God is God the spirit God the Father however those words comes forth out of his his spirit self through migration they always accomplish what they go war to what they're spoken to they accomplish amen Isaiah 45 chapter 45 22 says look unto me and be saved all the ends of the earth he says for I am God and there is none else she says I have swore by myself he says the word has gone out of my mouth he says he says in righteous and shall not return what return bad boy they might even nobody speaks will take place yes then powerful things about prophecy is that God knows he's the author and finisher of our faith he knows the end from the beginning is the out the Omega the first and the last he's all those things and what he knows it's going to take place he speaks it and and when it comes the past then we know that God has spoken they meant to do that it's all my man it's all by teaching us write her back in the day when I was a big Larry Bird fan brother Jesse was the Magic Johnson's Pantheon right only between us he's all magical all birds I was big into Larry Bird and Lady Bird was title on the court and he saw Xavier McDaniel it was a last-second shot and he had two or three seconds left for beating for five and living for him walk down and told these Avery says you're gonna guard me and I'm going to get the ball right here and I might hit this shot and I'm gonna win this game Xavier is like bring it and I love that about it I just love this area C is dysphasia the south-facing zone abilities thanks eliminated and he said that in his memoirs he says I get a charge from say from tell some I'm gonna do something he said then I do it I sure not really they had the involved pass the bird because the cocoa mask goose write that same location turns around a jumper and that's right as I Amen but that's one thing I like about proxy is when God says something he doesn't know everything must be just right absolutely yeah sure he says now that Isaiah 46 verse 8 he says remember this and show yourselves bad he says bring it again to my know he's transgressors remember the former things of all he says he says for god there's miles I am God as there is none like me amen he says declaring what his remembers I declare the in from the beginning he says and the ancient times the things that are not yet done he's the same my house or so stand and I shall do all my that he says remember these things I'm speaking to you he says because of the future you're going to see him come to pass his word and the word is just as good as the man's words only as good as himself absolutely then sometimes I make promises to do this to do that I come off short when they don't call access loot because I'm not God but when God's peace you can bet on a mentally amen now Isaiah 55 verse 8 now how could he do this he says from my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my are your ways my ways so the way we think something how to take place is totally contrary to the way that God sees some this thoughts are so much hotter absolutely yes he says he says say the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so my ways are higher than yours of my austin you were so he compares it from natural to spiritual he says look he says this natural earth that short boss he's looked up because you can't even tell her out of him he said then that's how I back off so that's it he's this love is all sir wavy I we could even imagine it will not understand you only until we receive that body and that isospeed with our husband we can embrace him and talk with him and be with it for all eternity that's we will start to know all the wonderful things of truth and facts about Jesus Christ and sometimes we get a little boys how are you here if we hear it or a little something in our heart or a billion all it goes but when we actually get to know him that's what whew that's that's what I'm talking about right there there's you got to spend time my ass he says glory that's who I cannot wait for that hallelujah he says for as the rain comes down the snow from Havanese and return not bitter but water the earth making it bring forth of the bud then it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth he says it shall not return unto me void they might be a man everything he says will take place he says but he shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it yes absolutely so when he speaks the very word and nowaday was this type for nowadays they have heat-seeking or computer guided missiles they sent forward this thing is they said I went right here they should order that beacons then pulls that missile right to an absolutely and then the same way as the Word of God we speak something about this something for that person or this place when he's speaking about it because goes out forever and in circles and it hits absolutely my hand yes but it must is the right time the right time again that's right now he's you know accomplish that which I please in a press so shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it a man that's right yes but now look what he says here in front of the stage of the ministry Jesus now when we come here and all remember that we live here in three dimensions now we're going to cover these dimensions that you went over them before mum just in truth right has he says we live hearing these three dimensions he's I don't know whether I came to them or not one of them is like he says the other is matter Tommy do you remember what the third is a little bit of tongue here he says whoa he's is Adam time he that's right he's now we have a nice manner and time that's the first three dimensions that we lived in more than her out there like matter in time he says and those cut and our five senses contact them dimensions and our sites contact the light and our feelings matter and so forth he says he says but we had contact through five science now to what the fourth dimension right he says as it was because they're coming right through this building right now comes pictures and voices Arabia a television he's in our senses do not pick that up so he's breaking this down for the first time when I come to the message I understand these dimensions sure I've heard of I size dimension I heard of other dimensions of this dimension but here now when he comes in truth I would understand exactly what these dimensions are amen he says he says so that's the radio waves of the pictures all these other things when we speak to one another we see our we see our mouths move we see we hear each other but do we see those words know that Edison said it two dimension and then now we're able to pick those up in a zoo because that's within the three dimensions yes he said now the fifth dimension is where the sinner unbeliever dies and goes to the fifth dimension is what kinda he's a horrible dimension and that's he types that dimension with a man falls asleep he's in between there and it goes into a nightmare he says he entered into the fifth dimension absolutely he says now when a christian died as he goes into the sixth dimension is what the altar right underneath the throne of golf correct he says I think God is in the seventh dimension eighth man that's right no he says you know that the infinite God I said to the Phoenix oh they coming down he's just like television is coming he's coming he says it's coming Christ is right here in the building now so he say he says the dimensions are here right now that word got into an egg and forth exist in human Jesus Christ is right here right now the area and another quote of Ingary later he says he says when we get to the other side of the millennium and start to under they understand these things in this great a movie of our lives is paid out before Jesus and he's I wonder off all the dimensions will be opened up and we'll be able to see that Jesus Christ was there the entire crazy one that I'm dealing with these dimensions remember when the word comes for let me read this here he says Jesus and now you know he says the voice never dies it never dies nicely in 20 years if they can progressively have now they probably have that they'll be able to the literal voice of Jesus Christ when he was on the earth in 20 years from them so they might be able to make tithing devices that could pick up all these voices he says because the voice has never died the Word of God never will always stand Shores whoa you cannot you cannot die this is because God and the word are the same he says the seeker he says then because it's drop it's like dropping a petal in the pond he says and the little waves they finally fade away out of your sight but science claims they go back for one bank the bank to bank across the seats with others back in 40s if they never died neither does the world that you speak he says no beats when the day of judgment and no idea where safety on you nobody's gonna wait from a minute laure man order seems for the very word of God that we speak is now caught in one Pope he says he's caught in the ether so it's caught in this little round here that we live in and these words bounce off these walls of how many servers are not bouncing off these walls of apprecia this congregation and those sermon on cries off on the day of judgment and condemn and you say yes I await Amen or you say look you heard that's enough to say well I did not hear hearken to the moans come on all right all right so all these things are going forth and all these things and as I was coming up with this kind of thought I read a quote that this thought came to me and I was thinking on it and I was thinking on it I was thinking on it and I thought about all the things that God has spoken in this day how everything must come to pass yeah and I thought about the importance of his word and we read that member in John 6 3063 said he says and these words have life that is what Jesus Christ spoke what God spoke from Genesis 1 all the way and the words of God of speeding they entered into this ether into this realm yes and they have life they have through the spirit and they are quickening power within them yeah Carrie they must carry an anointing with it if says something something has to happen but it has to write for wait for the right person timing it has those things coming to play literally but now I was thinking about to see how far this year I was thinking about this quote here he says now notice modern a current happenings that we have notice modern happenings that we have we look at the scientific age that we live in push what age yes Jesus and yet people have less time to pray than they ever did you know all these modern times they used to set all night and listen to a sermon now we just can't do it we haven't got the time you do do you see it he says you see it's just in your head we think we haven't got time to do it but we have and as I was moving on he says but modern Japanese happenings in the forerunner of spiritual habits so we sing as God's word went forth and the end times must be like this ten times wispy like this the end times are like that that these modern happenings are our effects of what was spoken about the spiritual right remember what does Christ's word cop aside it's always about the spiritual thing here in his bride yeah but the church is about the rapture it prophesized mostly of those good things but he does add in the horrible things yes sir yes sir he says it's a forerunner of spiritual happenings and remember by that happens our modern happenings are he says he says they're warnings of forerunners of spiritual happenings so every thing we see take place must there must for run a supernatural hey baby yes absolutely the modern and the natural and spiritual exactly is happening accompany the other only improved over the other each thing has happened in the natural and the next thing that happens is an equipment and he likened us to uh Luther Wesley and to the street yes and he was bringing these things in how no there was a horse-and-buggy age right and then when Weston come on and he happens the Wesleyan aged the manatees what strength Lawrence was now the car we had in the beginning of horse and buggy what horse knows what horsepower he said but then what he comes out to the this age of Wordsworth a the car and I was brought in which he said was Wesley's eight he says that we have a car is about the same size a little bit bigger but there's more horses and absolute have been educated sixteen horses he says over sixteen pounds he says then that sixteen horses were mixed more horses than that he's continually getting better better not at the end of that age he says we moved all amount of the Wright brothers brought in airplanes right right he said now that's is it he said and that's the same kind of vehicle but now Waco he can go even faster and farther and has even more horsepower than all those brackets shoot all the way up and think about the horsepower behind that yes to lift the one day it's fun machine absolutely we're Space Shuttle he said how he likened that to us the just an earthly momentum and then getting stronger he's a Luthor Wesley and the Pentecost she says and the Pentecostal Jewish treaties and that's when they took flight in the spirit yes he says and all those ties he says they represent the the conditions of the people in the churches someone a state earthbound just barely gone all right those whirling in the spirit eases don't these be Pentecostal that leaves me somewhat spiritually airplanes not good enough anymore he's as we got to go up into space absolutely right breakthrough in the atmosphere actually goats we're guys it's a minute he's s for the prize like that now here's the quote I hit that ugly oh he says when anything when anything happens on earth it is a worry to us that something is fixing that happen from heaven yes when anything look at your newspapers don't weather look at your heads Ivy's right look at the things that taking place and three of them caught my attention that I've been looking at and I want to hit those today Lord women by God's grace he says he said when that happened to you something is fixing to happen what man does on earth fight but man does on earth fighting his achievement he says is something that God is fixing to do by his achievement to the church oh hi there's three times I popped in my head right away he said now we look when we see we come from horse and buggy to automobile airplane he's at the church the church God has been able in the spiritual line to achieve from justification you lose the second occasion Wesley Matthews oligos now he says he is a tight shadow achievement what God has been able to do he says he allows the natural to do it first that's right so he shows us naturally something first before happened spiritually praise God but it's because spiritually it's already done and it's coming it was what a word of God spoken and when it's spoken is the annoying thing of that word is affecting this earth so it's all about this I say that 7:14 the greatest thing to ever strike the earth the greatest prophecy Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign right behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel and I was thinking what naturally took place before this their history has to record something or somebody to forerun this yes who who could live that kind of life who had this kind of testimony who was recorded in history to live like this right oh my I'm a real story I followed one man 100 he was born in July 13 Leo 100 BC before Christ I hate to tell you what he died now this is this person here breezed this to similarities in the story form and you'll be able to pick him up once upon a time a great man living who his initials were JC Jesus Christ he was born quite poor and lived among the common people even though he was a descendent from the great foundation of foundational King Romulus 14 days he says his aunt his mother my mother's man in Jesus was named Maria or Mary some claimed him for a miraculous birth by cesarean section just like Christ envisioned mysterious birth when he was still young he was almost killed by the tire sulla and Christ was almost killed by hearing his D is DS gaining significant fame during the early part of his public career when he was operating in the province just north called Delaney and cry started in Galilee everywhere he went he was accompanied by his faithful 12 lick doors for lectures or disciples he all he spoke in Proverbs often for example he said I came I saw I conquered he was also close to permiss us woman named Cleopatra Jesus was close to Mary Magdalene and a righteous and probably man named Nicodemus of myth Nia what Christ was close to Nicodemus son Ben Bethany eventually in his faith forced him to take a momentous decision and cross the Rubicon or the Jordan River on the way he was tested at and perform miraculous deeds and a city called Court of corneum for corneum well Christ was cat for Capernaum yes he says then he was operational in the capital Rome in crisis operation temple jerusalem there had been a similar man who he was close to with and had a similar problem a career eventually though Papa or John the Baptist was beheaded by an Egyptian and the head presented to him the exact isaiah 14 was a most powerful scripture that hung for 800 for how many years it was around the earth waiting yeah but God said he says I'm gonna bring a natural man to live it so close he was kind to the Cecilia or the blind the Claudia the lame or the metalia the disfigured just like Christ he was so righteous that the common people started calling by the Greek name Christo's after operating in the capital while his popularity was noticed by a jealous governing body the Senate or the saint he was accused of having ambitions on becoming the key he was betrayed by someone very close to him Decimus or judas right Decimus was a longtime supporter friend and fellow diner the night before who literally led him by the hand to the Senate because he told him brother you're gonna be the king we're gonna make you the king hmm the crowd is forced to choose between this will give away Brutus or Barabbas and him a powerful name named populist Letta puss-puss pilot Washington hands clean to the matter he knows kill on March 15 wearing the crown of grass as he went into the Senate Christ toward the crown of thorns right before it killed he is stabbed between the ribs by someone named Cassius long Gnaeus stand Grady between the ribs just like Christ on the cross right there in blood and water flowed his blood his body was displayed to the people on a crucifix Christ's right his followers were devastated he says as predictions from all around the world had said that a savior and a king of the world when he bore around this time so he ascended into heaven became a God he took the place in pantheon and the son of god the son of Uecker this was none other julius caesar who was the one man that caught the anointing or the Effects of the anointing of that prophecy and had to live it like Christ this is the closest one of your fine Wow there's many other things in addition when Julius Caesar was assassinated the story was that the Scot the sky darkened Josephus records Marc Anthony sang of the murder for the sake of which we suppose that it was the son turned away his night from us as unwilling to view the horde crying they the assassins were guilty as in the case of Caesar we need the elder forty Gnaeus and protracted eclipses of the Sun occurred such as one after the murder of Cesar the dictator and during the anti warmest follows almost the whole the whole world whole years continuous gloom we talk the brightness of the Sun was darkened which all through the year grows very pale and shined not whereby a day but little heat this natural sign followed that natural sign where of the air was rather cloudy and dark by reason of the heat and they could not bring forth calling her earth to bring forth but raw and unripe fruit which Ronald afford could be frightened think about think about the indictment of this generation it has the second crucifixion of Christ I a nice day a man has not the rapture taking place because the fruits not there why because there's a second crucifixion and the Sun went down yes sir yes sir Maggie bandulus even the god Caesar fell to the seen unspeakable wearing in of the world probies brought darkness and forsook the earth he even thought it was a god up in there for took took the Sun from the earth the light Virgil the Sun to pity Rome when Caesar died his shining face and dim dusty red and that impious and pious generation feared eternal night they thought it would never go away because they killed see they thought he was going to be the Messiah the great one notice not even in Israel not even in Jewish time that was that was Gentile that was Rome expecting a world leader of great when to arrives same anointing that the Jews are looking for the whole time right where is this Messiah amen I tried to fight others in history and I thought about Martin Luther because who would be the next great one Martin Luther he changed everything by one man that was close to Martin this man was spiritual - his name was John Wycliff giant Wycliffe was born in the 1300s he was raised up let's see here in the column of the world that says what the waters would soon be stirred by Wycliffe which and they would G would join the fray England must plunged into a hundred years war with France this struggle was waged because some Englishmen were tired of the outrageous taxes had to pay the church because the Englishman lived on church property at that time the banking on one third of all the property in that area and the people were so tired of paying taxes living on his working that wife slit rose up and started publishing thesis is and papers against the Catholic Church saying let this profit and free give it back to the people this and that set us free from these businesses right but then as Martin Luther T Wycliffe freed what he wanted to property God's property 312 loser what he had the God's people through the doors let us freeze if you're not able to have it's tiresome a man hangs one of the first people call the Pope Antichrist they make sure I dad that's right that's what I'm saving that for runner-ups now he's got the Martin Luther was born almost 200 years later than 1400 now what about our day surely who's the next great one after that would be our prophet yes yes sir there had to be unnatural and I'll show you there was another person ater as well it was called the year of miracles and March 1905 Einstein came up with all his popular science theories all his popular science facts that he put together or other common theories actually there were theories and they still hold up so hold today someone disprove some this neck but he's had this popular quantum theory of light that was in 1905 we know the 1906 1909 Azusa Street revival the pillar of fire a fire was seen the light was seen above their buildings they met and then in 1909 well there's a little man born on April 60s and there's a little light came through that window there tumble over the crib of that cabin absolutely it's right and that was what he was showing what I said was gonna see life open up to understanding and what the light came now even the lowest absolutely rather to this the real Elijah had to have a forerunner that was faith yes now his name was John Alexander Dowie born March I'm sorry May 25th 1847 died March 9th 1907 see how close everything just mingled in right there he was a he attacked churches and he believed that he was the newest spiritual leader what and he called his church he went out to we Illinois's just 40 miles south of us Chicago there and set up a church called Bloods I am absolutely mom's liner something like that he says he was drawing people by the thousands but there's some major cracks in the spiritual foundation as of now his personality and of his family he began to envision a new church similar to the Catholic Church where he was the Pope he says at night in 1896 he organizes the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in Zion my goodness went back to that and 1901 he founded the Zion city about 40 miles from Chicago he was owner of all the property and the tenants leased the land they built their houses on their savings went into design thing my goodness the same yes he said that things began to crumble and now we get cleared himself Elisha the restorer or Elijah the third first Elijah then John the Baptist and himself he walked around dressed in an Old Testament light priest outfit and him 9 in 1907 here was the false right before the truth was born I caught the same anointing about zion.t talked about that setting up the church he he would be what the spiritual spokesman absolutely but now that was this that was the spiritual false right who is the natural just like Christ just like Christ and Julius Caesar yes who was who was the natural this man was born in 1809 the dream was born in 1909 he was born in a log cabin yeah just like our prophet he was born Kentucky just like I promised membership it's earnings he was elected to Congress in nineteen eighteen forty six he says well what do you brand was commissioned by an angel like this our prophet died in 1965 Lincoln was assassinated by a group of Jesuit followers Catholics the kind of struck for the random pieces that killed him had three Catholic voices he says both these men had their faces carved in mountains well rush for a sunset mountain baby bear and as me and sister Wendy we didn't fight together we flew there separate to that meeting a couple years ago and we're in some BTO canyon and we're looking at the white sword and the rock and looked at the Eagles on Eagle Rock and looking down where the heater was look directly across the canyon and there's a face that brother branham right there in the rocks I thought that was more graphically and he's looking at that away in his mouth open like he's preaching the gospel that there has to be so and lived the exact same light you live that flute yeah click guard Opie Jesus Christ McDonald I live this kind of life and no one else did dad and the same type like he'd had enough someone yes amen and what it was Abe Lincoln what freed the slaves he said the campus [Applause] [Applause] praise God you want to see that picture of that face that rock aye I have a go huntin here oh that was so powerful yes sir it's amazing the first Christ and the crucifixion and when this God Himself come down in now in a prophet and what a crucifixion had to follow again yes he said that today we're taking some man's word which is a lie he is what he is what do they do they cook Morales a murder and said the son of God as the day of the first crucifixion he says any type marabous to what he's taking some man's word which is a lie and the way of death a murder which is a false word a false not he says he says and refusing to take the way I would like God's Word I condemn this generation he's a Zion diet in the world or that they're wrong he's they're guilty of crucifixion he said they're trying to crucify the spirit they call for revival everywhere here you're how are you going to everybody when the word self can't work through the people I'd like someone to answer that but what are they crucified they could not crucify the spirit so what does the price they take the denominations and their Creed's and instead of the word and that crucified his word and makes his word of no effect of the people so what was crucified was the effects of the word yes yes that's why we see a lot of religious don't even have any healing because that healing portion of the scripture that was given was crucified all right they can't enter into it because it was already dead they kill it that church comes it right brother right and when they kill the influence of what just natural or spiritual revelation there's no work there's no more of this work that's coming and they kill revelation right there right I remember it came that away the crucifixion of Christ that did that affect of the disciples of our own absolutely it'll affect us the same way it has a thickness right but remember as a crucifixion came they those people had to wait on God and get in one Accord and then what the word came for the yes amen where is our book of Acts where is it it's coming we have to get in one core raised up man amen how are those thinking about our modern times the Prophet SAW is the Anointed One the end times why would there be anointed ones at the untyped because the word said their Creflo Dollar keen ejects all these false anointed ones are riding up but that's not the true one they're getting in the way they're for murders and false forward I was really coming a maybe bad idea and as I'm reading the headlines today or not stable in this last year or so and program studies of these natural things show surge things coming that's right at the end of this year is going to take place something phenomenal it is the world's first human head transplant the 1st Corinthians 2:16 is for we have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ what is it the anointing that was that were so that we have the mind of Christ with heaven in the first days it has the heaven in this last and God is showing now there are these are science men they're tuning the science things and when the word says that what we must catch the light of God the more time know what that word is affecting them and now they was a transplant head and that's the carnal personation of God giving back to church the might of all right yeah absolutely and another thing I start seeing me rise up is all this talk of cannibalism through television and movies they're pushing cannibalism so hard right it is unreal if you just don't run and just look at some of these trailers they're putting out it's all about cameras what is this Genesis 9:3 it says every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even the green herb have I given you all things but flesh to the lights are up he says wishes the blood that he shall not eat so he says man you're not eating blood because what we know from the biggest 1711 the knife is in the bride a baby oh now why would this Noren team be hitting them about eating people eating this eating that blood and flesh and all that stuff remember the four beasts around the throne yes the lion the Ox the man and the eagle yes in numbers 23 24 it says behold the people shall rise up like a great lion and so lift up himself as a young knight he shall not lie down until he eats the prey and drink the blood of the slain so that lion anointing can eat the blood that's why Christ said he says eat of my flesh drink in my blood because what that first church hymns that pure church that book of Acts church could eat the literal blood of Christ a food which is what tonight they have direct communion and the pure blood or the Spirit of God Oh Joe 40 15 songs 106 20 it says the axe would eat grass the Ox always eats grass yes and it solves one of 450 knees and why the biggest glad the heart of man he says and they could order making his face to shine and a heart and that's right and bread which strengthens the man's heart in the scriptures man he shall live by that shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God man eats what the bread in the oil I'm sorry the wine yes but then we get the job 39 verse 27 he says dusty Eagle bound up at thy command and make her nest on high heat Wells the device on the rock upon the crazy larog in the strong place from whence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold far off and her young ones sucked up the blood all those four feasts that surround and protect the what the Holy Ghost church only the first in the last can drink the blood or the literal life of Christ the Holy Ghost yes rise gonna freakin it shows what that this age the anointing of that is affecting this games because the Bible said of us in Luke 17 35 says where crews body is there the yes sir Truman and then of course in the last five years this has been always control transgenderism did this take place and last day I can't imagine right actually mutilate only did that technology to mutilate themselves and may in chemicals and this is going beyond that transgender what does that represent what anointing from God is is that similar to second Corinthians 3:17 he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty verse 18 but we all with open face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as the Spirit of the Lord amen and then the first John 3 once and behold what manner of love the father has bestowed unto us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth not because it knew not him behold now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him and then we shall see him as he is what is this transgender movement sense of God we are going to be moving into such a state just like John the Baptist just like Christ himself they will be confusing you as someone else amen amen there's actually what the fullness of what the masculine side God will be made manifest one more time through the bride a man is speaking one of the body teams absolutely oh yeah speaking out and it is the rising of Sun 65 you've all heard this quote he says and as he the being the groom the bride has to come forward because as part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fullness of the revelation any other he spoke up of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone he's his life he says of his life he's a power of his power he is him something like humans affected now the loss and they're trying to switch over because but it's they're only a carnal personation absolutely and that goes all the way back to John 17:11 he said now I'm no more in the Lord and these are in the world I come to the Holy Father keep through thine own name those who know it's given me that they may be one as we are one he's living he says that they all may be one the Father are in me and I indeed that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me amen other than him and glory and the glory which thou gavest me I gave them the day may be one even as we are one God so we're seeing these things these natural types thanks God the rapture is going to happen this age because why we're seeing these things transgender we've seen the head transplants were seen and there's probably 10 or 15 more things I'm trying to study out but man these things are pointing directly they've only been getting in I mean recently ever yes study what's going to take place in the stars I think it's next month or the month after that there's a headship switchover is taking place absolutely he's coming this is the season this is the hour now but now how do we how do we get from being a cannibal how did we get from one of the scientists guys we had November what was God a beginning and Genesis 1:1 he was gone he was it was the Creator he was the source or the power or the voice of everything everything came from him but when his word went forth there must be someone to receive him we have to help absolutely and the only way you can actually receive of the transmitters you have to be ready getting to that channel that's your day yeah we find ourselves in 2017 how did you know you're gonna be born we didn't know we were before here we're still going to be alive at this time absolutely right so why do you just have to view ourselves this thing of them as a receiver get into the spirit and catch the word that was not supposed to be performed in this day yeah he said I would not come back boy we just have to be able now to receive it great job baby Matthew 13 uses that crowd sees both receive the right seat into the right round it receives in there that's right even now he says always remember except the voice that followed me that said follow me you always come out right I believe you I got competency just always remember that Jesus that voice is alive in the earth tonight just the same as every voice in every word we we spoke is still alive got em mercy he says when the boy shows out onto that Etherwave in the air he says he says you got a transmitter here that picks it up he says you are the transmitter that sends it out I'll take the station he doesn't pick it up hey men talk about the word God he says that Jesus was the transmitter of God's Word he was the triune God manifested in one man he was complete God complete man yes and the transmitter said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life so all of you have two moons saints of God is perceived the Word of God hey man just a couple scriptures it'll be done first that's only 2:13 for this cause also thank me God without ceasing because when you receive the Word of God she heard of us you received it not as the word of men he says but it is but as it is that's true the Word of God which effectually worketh anew in all that the after so how how do you say always you have to do is be the receiver of that word of God that one fourth hey man absolutely execute 41 then they gladly received his word david word that gladly received his word were baptized the same day whereas them about three thousand souls hey that yeah hey man john seventeen six through eight last year said i have manifested thy name unto the men which they'll give us me out of the world vide they were and now give us them me they have kept your word now they have known all things what sort of out of giving me of me now I have given unto them the words which thou gave me and they have received them the very words of Christ spoke they what were able to receive him right there yes and God just did to speak that stuff before the foundation world he actually came down for three and a half years and spoke directly to his receivers I'm gonna make sure these guys get right into the phrase and now just original arteries if you had to hear the words that they gave us me and they have received them and look what they produce sakes right right Jesus said it they have received thanks to god we've been receiving as well and will produce the same thing yeah and I know it's truly that they came out of thee and that they I believe that I did is send me a Amen praise the Lord plus power gets raised your father Jesus Bobby lord thank you for this day lord thank you for thanks God being attentive lord get through second service toward I don't I'm out there Lord it's always a rough floor you know that we love you Lord so much unless the hearers got an order no one mainly be able to receive Lord God what you brought forth in this day lord over his son our prophet God Lord he spoke the words of life Lord even it was so bold to say that she is him nor God Lord maybe we open or clean our receivers out God Lord or whatever you have to do God made that be planted into her heart stop that we can let it grow in or God and mature and bring forth God Lord exactly what that word went out to accomplish okay we don't want to be the accomplishing word we want to be the accomplishing thought God made manifest we love you Lord blessed to hear his Lord we did our best God and or just strengthened each one to protect the doors from John and all the saints and they were able to make it back for them no nor strengthen each pot and then Jesus Christ praise Lord Saints hope it was all right one little thought of you uh

Paul something is taking place right now we're watching it on the earth nations are breaking everything's falling apart craziness and now science the healing people are picking up and doing things that have never been done before on face the earth or even try or your thought about and that shows something's about ready to place a man a madam spiritual or the little bride yet but because it's such a powerful move and there's so much of God in it that it affects all the surroundings just the presence of that word about ready to take place is affecting the world that's right Oh remember once the bride is sealed and the bride goes up the Holy Ghost anointing the word is actually now off the earth that's right that's now why the judgment comes right yes sir because there's no part of God there anymore right right over the spirit bone was born in freshman splash yes yes sir and now the presence of God you're going see you can have it right anyhow just come up thank God it was all right give the Lord of politics and all these things are trying to do and perform great miracles and accomplishments now they're shooting to them to Mars and Beyond trying to get people there or whatever
