========================================

if we're honest and sincere and humble that god will bless us little by little praise god it's a great uh promise from the lord jesus christ we thank god for that proverbs 13 verse 11 let's read that together if we came here one two three well god didn't buy by abandoning shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase amen let's have one more word of prayer if we can't hear about god's grace i surely need god's help i know you do too we all stay in need of the lord jesus today heavenly father we just come reverently thank you for amazing grace how sweet the sound that save the reds like me before god we were once lost but now we're fine we were blind but now we see it lord i just love how that song says uh lord your love is unending unending love and amazing grace lord god hallelujah we know by eternity eternity lord and eternal prophet prospects and principles lord you can't love us any more than you already do lord god your love is the same yesterday today and forever so we're so grateful the same love that saved us is the same love today that's with us today father god strengthening us when we're on the mountaintop being with us when we're in the valley lord god hallelujah thank you that's it's it's unending it's eternal love lord god and we rest in that today father god i don't know you forgive us of any sin lord god as we come into your presence today lord just anoint us god to do thy will to speak your truth lord god and just make your presence be felt strongly today lord god that's your people can feel close to you lord god and in the closest fellowship we've ever felt so granted lord god for each day we should lord gather more as we see the day approaching and each day we know you're coming as sooner lord and each day lord we know the the two unions have to take place lord the worlds of the mark of the beast but the believer to the seal of god hallelujah becoming that mature weak grain that the lord your rapture lord god hallelujah that you'll gather them together in your garden so lord grant it lord mature us today as we as we gather here physically lord and spiritually anoint us here by the holy spirit and we'll give you all the thanks and praise in jesus christ's name the church said amen god bless you as you mentioned praise the lord all right i just got a text though this is kind of like an announcement i got a question about the samuel browning uh there's a youth event on september 11th sunday evening i just took the kids to a youth event on was it friday night you drove three hours over to michigan and i gotta see brother brooks it's really nice this is a real great deal but then they have another one on november six they have two so our youth group here but it's all god's hands for god's protection maybe they'll let all of us come since we're such a small church maybe by samuel let us all come because we normally have sunday night services so we'll see how that works out so we're really i just want to preach about hours i really am because brother austin has has to work today um we rejoiced uh a couple weeks ago he got a full-time uh position there uh as supervisor so we rejoice in that such a great blessing there but then part of that is having to work sunday nights just like i told him you know he was concerned at first by total just like you know brother bang and amen they miss you every wednesday so they're here two out of three services and i said you can do the same i say you just gotta make sure like these brothers probably do make sure you listen to the service that you missed feed on that word you know and uh and you'll see your strength prevail by god's goodness just gotta and you know the the reality of it is though every day feed on the word praise god that's the real uh that's the real feeding uh habits of a child of god praise god just to stay in community that constant prayer concept fellowship with the lord uh but that's the way to do it by god's grace so i told brothers and i said just give it a three month trial you know go through my trial see how you see how it goes and see what the lord does by god's grace very thankful so i will try to preach an hour today my guys gonna say how do you have my uh my pledge okay not my promise but my plans okay if not he's got to get an uber but i'd rather take him up there by god's face so part three you know we look we looked at uh money topics you know and i got some good feedback on wednesday so i appreciate everybody sharing that feedback and i tried to be more personal to kind of share what's on my heart you know and things i've learned i try to share all my mistakes i've shared some victories but i also try to share some of my mistakes i think i feel like because of the way i was raised i was not taught how to handle money right my mom did paycheck to paycheck and sometimes she didn't have a paycheck except food stamps that was the only paycheck she had sometimes and so i felt you know in high school you didn't learn really nothing about money they really didn't teach you how to manage money uh i felt like once i got to college you know god poured out these blessings but then i wasted a lot of it and i'll share more about that later you know but i feel like i wasted a lot but god has helped me to try to be more diligent praise god so i'm thankful you know uh and today you know we're looking really at how god's plan for your life may include having less money or more money it's all about god's plan for your life praise god just like jesus said no man can add one cubit to his stature so if your physical size if your physical weight and your build or whatever more your hair color and your smile whatever if that was predetermined by god and you can't change that it's the same way naturally praise god same way with money same way with spiritual gifts right spiritual gifts you can't add one spiritual gift that you know that god didn't give you right you can't say lord make me a prophet make me a prophet make me speak in tongues or make me prophesy you ain't gonna do it the devil might have you impersonate it but it ain't gonna be real except the gifts that god placed in your life how many just want the gifts god placed in your life now i want all to praise god amen how they do i just don't want i just want all god's gifts to be manifested in my life and i know you do too by god's grace so let's take about uh an hour here lord willing and we'll try to look at this here by god's grace so our text here was a great word of wisdom wealth by vanity so there there's all kinds of get rich quick schemes out there right there always has been there will be i was listening to a preacher yesterday and he was going through all the list of all the uh get rich quick schemes down through the last hundred or 200 years and they these slickers they just see that they uh they're just really deceptive you know uh what they'll do is like recently uh like when the when the housing market crashed these guys would would get money from investors and say they're going to invest it right and then they would say i'm going to give you your yields you know next week so they would take all this money and they'd give them a little bit to make them think it was actually working right so they're so sly they're so slippery like snakes you know and then but when it come down to the big payout that's when they skip down you know there's so there's always these get rich quick schemes like i told you the one about uh send everybody on this list one dollar and you'll get a hundred or a thousand back or something like that it never works and the bible says don't try to do it through vanity try to uh increase your income by hard work that's what the bible says by labor so this is by steady labor okay so uh another translation i don't believe in other translations and as far as like uh i don't believe they're right but when you look at other translations they call it little by little so i don't know if they're looking at different hebrew texts or not but that actually still fits uh the bible says he that gathereth by labor shall increase so if you go back to the bible days they had to gather at harvest time that's right of course they had three different harvests right they had the early the barley harvest and they had the uh then the wheat harvest and they had the fruit harvest they had three harvests so as long as you were gathering which would have whichever field you were in if you were in fruits or if you were at all three as long as you were gathering every day a little at a time then it would come down to you know uh you come down to july august the harvest time and that's when you go to the house of god and you would give your tithes and give your offerings and remember church if you owned if you owned a field you couldn't harvest the corners you had to round off you couldn't get you couldn't harvest every single apple in your order in the church you had to leave some for the poor and the stranger you couldn't just take everything you know you couldn't harvest it all i got all i got every every olive off that olive tree no you're supposed to leave so far and god was testing you to see if you'd honor his word how did there you go just as uh i i love it god's uh god's idea uh hard work and and building wealth i just love it you know god just wants you to work hard every day to slowly increase it if you use wisdom and then remember the poor never forget the poor every harvest time uh remember the poor as well praise god take what you need make sure you live a leave a little bit for the the poor the afflicted uh so i'm just gonna briefly just review real real real real quick part one we looked at uh monies to be in god's way not through man's way through humility fear of the lord hard work and honest financial decisions yield good results and we found david said all money comes from god that's why this sermon is called stewardship over god's money amen because god god kind of like lends it to us right he kind of gives us a load right temporary loan and we got to be faithful with it um get rich quick seekers will lose their riches the bible says that's what we just read and evil hearts want quick riches he that hates this to be rich have an evil eye i was listening this guy yesterday uh he's a good preacher on money and he was saying every time one of these get-rich-quick schemes comes around he says you can just hear uh the pride in people's voices oh if you just do this man you're gonna be rich right you and he actually said you can actually look them in the eye and see like their deception they're so uh possessed with this idea of getting rich you can hear it in their voice and you can see in their eye and that is interesting the bible said he that hates us to be rich have the evil eye like they just have a look about them like you know they're gonna they're quickly gonna get rich by this certain scheme nobody knows about this the bible says no you just gather every day you work hard every single day if you're faithful then god will god will bless you now wednesday we looked at the beginning how contentment is a great spiritual level to gain godliness when contentment is a great game the bible says uh a faithful man shall bound with blessing so see faithful hard work work every day little by little praise god build it up little by little like you know we're seeing our kids now starting to work and and uh i don't make them pay rent you know of course not but it's it's nice for me to see their bank bank accounts rise slowly you know and don't spend money save as much as you can you don't save his money you only gotta only buy when you really got to you know i know but no one ever told me that i wish somebody would have told me that you know that's just different different things in life you know what i mean just gotta it's my battle to overcome you know i've got to overcome that you know we just got different things uh but then paul says if riches do come snare snares and temptations will follow so we have to be very careful and we must not love money at all we just must see it as god's tool for us and then we saw solomon's prayer the middle class prayer don't make me so poor that i won't have to steal but don't make me so rich that i trust in my money make me middle of the road now let's look at this here now god has a plan and it may include less money that's hard to hear but you know we know that's true in the scripture well there's obviously some some real wonderful bible examples here god made job abraham solomon david rich man no doubt but then also god made others poor like the beggar lazarus paul even jesus himself right was a poor man and the widow woman with two mice so you have uh there's just four on both sides right uh you have them on both sides so you have to see well lord which one am i now i told you as far as the whole world we're on the richer side amen but even in this richer side we might be on the poor side right which is okay it's all according to god's plan you know but we don't know we don't know so the main way to know is just be faithful every day just be faithful little by little keep working hard uh laboring and then if god wants you to have a great increase well surely you know he's gonna bring it praise god because god's faithful hallelujah now let's look at a few scriptures here uh proverbs 22 verse 2. if you can pull it up there america i'm not ready for the slides yet i want to see how many scriptures i got i got quite a few on here i want to show again i want to review again brother branham's uh financial state just with some quotes with the inflation calculator to kind of have you see an idea about how he manages money proverbs 22 verse 2 the poor i'm sorry the rich and the poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all right just like david said uh all the wealth is in god's hands right so god will say i'll give you some i'll give you a little more i'll give you a little lesson i'll give you a little more you know god's the one who's giving out all these resources now next proverbs 10 verse 4 he that becometh poor that deals with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich so of course we know the balance you know uh you know uh we know the balance here of the scripture i want you to see though the word diligent here means a strict decision the hand of the strict make rich so with money you've got to be very strict with money in other words you got to know where all your money's going people are making lots of money now just making apps that tell you how many subscriptions you got and how you can break free from those like some people just they just going so far in debt it's really sad but they go so far they don't know how many subscriptions they have their money's just flying everywhere they don't even know where their money's going they forgot they're paying for that every year right they forget about these things and so people make apps to help you find out where all your money's going and they make money off that app it's a good app it's a good ad but the idea is we uh if we don't deal with money the right way if we're lazy with our money we'll become poor right that's what the bible says deal with the slack hand but the hand of the diligent so those who are strict with their money eventually become more wealthy right and so this verse god is rebuking lazy spenders and he's honoring the strict saviors that's right all right so we can see it playing through the scripture now here's what i want to brought out a while ago james 2 verse 5 hearken ye my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised to them to love him so james wrote this 2000 years ago this is way before laodicea right but there was no doubt those rich people in those days but in other words the majority of christians are going to be poor people because the gospel attracts them it gives them spiritual goods they uh they know in many cases they won't have natural goods right because those are reserved just for uh the higher class in society think about china think about you know some of the leaders in china they have to go meet out in the woods just to have church you know uh all these nigeria i mean you name it different places where christians are persecuted they're the poor people they don't agree with the communist and government so they're not a part of that so they're poor they're living out and living off the land agriculture the majority of christians are poor now god over the world has made us rich so we we must be more disciplined we must be more faithful more strict with our money praise god that's right so god often chooses the poor because the rich have already chosen to love the world more than god right lovers of pleasures right lovers of selves more than more than lovers of god right that's one reason god can't choose many rich people to be saved and then jesus says those notable words it's easier for a camel to get through an eye of a needle than a rich man to get to heaven so church we really need god's grace in america amen amen that's why we really need god's mercy in america amen amen that's why we really got to remember the poor we really got to remember those who are hurting in america we've got to be generous people praise god now proverbs 23 verse 23 23 23. now this is very similar to what uh proverbs said earlier the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and up i think this is hannah's prayer if i'm not mistaken right after she'd gotten the news uh or actually had samuel if i'm not mistaken by god's grace the lord makes poor the lord makes rich he brings love and he lifts up praise god in other words god's the author of every season of our life i've had seasons where i've been poor i've had seasons where i've had a lot more extra praise god but god's the author of it all praise god amen and he brings me low sometimes but other times he raises me up amen oh thank god amen hallelujah every in every mountain every valley we find god's mercy we find the gracious one the tenor savior we find in whatever valley whatever uh whatever mountain we're all whatever victory whatever test we're going through we find jesus carrying us through amen wherever we are that's where we know jesus is praise god does he promise to never leave us or forsake us now i just want again to say because because most christians are poor isaiah 55 verse 1 is crucial it says ho everyone that thirsts come to the waters and he that hath no money come ye by and eat come ye by wine and milk without money in price see because most christians are poor this is why the gospel is attractive you can gain spiritual riches or spiritual food hallelujah or spiritual drink you can gain it just by coming to jesus amen amen hallelujah amen you can look past your your your physical circumstances and look at the spiritual and know that god has promised you spiritual drink spiritual food a home in heaven a mansion in heaven praise god amen i don't know you the poor can see this hallelujah he promised you wine and milk wine simulation and milk is the elementary truce that's right right because there's milk and meat christians hallelujah so it's beautiful these great promises now church don't just remind yourself jesus said in three verse 18 revelation 3 18 i counseling divide me go i believe investing in gold and silver but this is the best goal to invest in this is gold this is time tested faith amen amen hallelujah that's what gold is peter said to try your faith more precious than go so we should go to jesus and say lord i want to invest in some gold praise god in other words help my faith to be strong when i go through trials bring me through the trials so i can trust you the next time i go through a tribe me real faith that's why i'm thankful you never that's why i often say the number of years that i've been preaching or serving god because it encouraged me wow if i got through 16 years of preaching i can get through 16 more that's right because god has god has blessed my faith and he's taking me through the tests and trials that we all must go through amen amen it encourages me i don't encourage you praise god i've stood this long i can stand longer right now as long as god's grace stays with me it's grace that was with me it's grace that it brought me through and it's grace that will leave me home amen amen that's why i like to tally up the numbers that encourages me you know that's that works in the natural too you tally up your savings you're going to you're going to like saving pretty soon yeah i invested in a a 401k kind of thing it's actually a 403b but it's the same idea i haven't checked it for years i went back and checked i was like my thank god for a compound interest it's a blessed surprise i just kind of forgot about it uh it's investing and each service we're investing in the kingdom of god amen each time we pray each time we worship praise god we're investing we're saying lord i want to purchase uh your i'm going to purchase the truth amen i want to purchase some gold he said i want to buy some white raiment that i may be clothed in your righteousness amen amen not my righteousness but the holiness of jesus amen i exchanged my sin and my guilt i exchange those for your righteousness praise god wash me hallelujah and i know i'll be clean hallelujah so god so god has a continuum right of rich we're in the top one percent of the world we're over here if this is poverty over here like we would think you know living in the desert or living someplace awful or living in a famine we're over here on the one percent the rich side of all the world so church god has put us on this continuum on the rich side so that means he's called us for good works like broadband said i couldn't i didn't find the quote but i found other quotes i'll share with you little man said whatever you do for yourself doesn't have any eternal reward but whatever you do for others deals with eternal rewards praise god only what we do for others is what will count on that day praise god as far as rewards now abraham's on the wealthy side uh uh genesis 13 verse 2 and abraham was very rich in cali he wasn't just he wasn't middle class he was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold abraham was a wealthy man but look look at his love for god look at his love for god remember genesis 18 he was what was he doing he was sitting outside his tent waiting for jehovah to come amen and visit him amen hallelujah you know no doubt his servants were out there working with the sheep and and all the cattle and probably probably protecting this gold and silver too they're probably out there but what was he doing he was i i got this time i'm gonna wait on the lord and then who comes three men come and he said my lord he didn't say my lords he said my lord amen he knew one of those was god two of them were angels one was god and then the bible said he bowed down and he said can i wash your feet and sarah go prepare the fatty calf you know go go prepare uh for god in other words he was waiting for that fellowship and when jesus come there when the lord the holy spirit comes he had communion with him that's what we do praise god we come to the house of god for communion with god amen amen but look at him very wealthy god saw abraham's love for truth and he know or he knew he would train faithfully his family and servants to obey the words of god put up genesis 18 19 would you so we look at abraham well he's a rich man what what do you spend his time doing he had all these servants he spent his time teaching them the word of god so what would you do if you were rich well here's what abraham did when he was rich the bible said he commands his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abram that which he has spoken of so if we ever get rich where we can retire and we have servants or today they call them personal assistants that's what they call today uh my personal assistants take care of that for me send them an email if you ever get a personal assistant and you're freed up because of all your wealth then you would spend your time training up your children and your household now the reality of this church we still gotta do it anyway right i still do that you still buy one time last night you know i still took all the questions of the kids good questions every morning you know except sunday we do bible time my wife does bible time i do bible time in the evening we still got to do that but if you were freed up and had all this money like rich man abraham then you spend all that extra time training your children to obey the word of god training your servants to obey the word of god amen everyone can ever see that by god's grace and that's why god blessed him so much remember his sermons were so brave church that they rescued the people and goods of sodom and gomorrah from four heathen kings in genesis 14. this is how much faith talk about mighty men there we go talk about mighty men and women praise god he was rich but he also had trained them up and they were able to overcome four kings so it was just god's anointing on them it was god's anointing to defeat four kings how can how can one man who's not even a king how can his 400 servants defeat four kings by the power of god god gave him favor hallelujah now uh i want to add this in here i want to add in the definition of wealth you know one time a a financial guru said wealth is how much money you have that you could live off in case you lost all your income it's kind of like on wednesday night we're talking about how many how many months of income would you have saved up right so some people define that as wealth okay now i believe there's wisdom in that from proverbs 21 verse 20. i'm going to read that again since i'm there 21 20. there is oh yeah there's treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spent it up can you put that one up there proverbs 21 20. this is why i said if the holy spirit was here he'd say save your money save your resources don't spend it on luxurious things right because the bible says the wise why is it foolish just like why isn't virgins right the wise have treasure and their treasure is oil right so they have plenty of oil saved up for the winter now another verse we'll get to later was the ant right simon says let me show you somebody wise this little ant down here and boy we hate them when they get into our house don't we like how did they get in here and trap but the bible actually says the bible is honored look at that ant he's going out there to get what he needs and get ready for the winter time so the holy spirit says save up and foolish men spend up all their money so when the winner time comes pockets are empty there's a lot of lit in there today you know so that's why i said you know when we start out as and finances we might have paycheck to paycheck but as you're faithful and as the holy spirit is working our lives uh we have the ability as the the rich percent or the richer people in the world we have the ability to really increase our wealth that we can help other people and we should have it we shouldn't spend all of our money right we shouldn't do that unless we're at the very beginning point all right you can see that now now but jesus gave us the true definition of wealth in uh matthew 19 21 so malcolm matthew 19 21. proverbs gives us that one look there of course you can use that spiritually but jesus said uh jesus saith unto the rich young ruler if thou be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me so the one time jesus says you know you're going to have treasure in heaven for this man was to sell all your riches give to the poor and come and follow me so here we see real treasure comes when you follow jesus christ amen hallelujah praise god amen follow jesus not all he was he was getting called to be a missionary that's why jesus said sell everything you have just like when elijah remember when elisha really sold out he killed the oxen he was he was yo he was a farmer he was he was he was burdened you know he was a agricultural man a farmer but when he decided to follow the message of the hour he slayed that ox and he fed his family and said see you later in other words he cut all ties amen amen he was so uh devoted he was so decided on cutting any ties i'm gonna go i'm gonna go where god sends me praise god amen so see the idea is to follow christ and make sure we remember the poor hallelujah so we got two on the wealthy side abraham was rich he was able to manage it now he still had a lying problem and the church said amen right a prophet with a line problem okay we're all human praise god solomon was the other one that he was extremely rich and prosperous but he fell because of his many wives the bible said his wives turned his heart away from serving god because look at that it wasn't even the money it was the women and those altars that he built in the buildings of uh whoredom and uh idolatry where they had idols and statues no doubt they did awful works and sinful acts that those houses uh they're like bravo houses many of them that's what you do with idols that's what they do they get you drugged up and then they uh let last shivers flow that's what they do in those houses that's true anybody knows that if you if you've seen if you study the idolatry you would know that so that's a good thing to study but see solomon without this and so so the conclusion is it's not a sin to be rich but riches will bring temptations that ensnare many in their sins so christians can be rich i think i got i got asked that question last week that was a good question yes they can and if not church then we better sell everything we have you know we better become beggars because we're the richest christians in the world probably america right but then see we got to go back to the scripture that's why we always go back to the scripture and rich christians must be uh rich in good works paul says in 1st timothy chapter 6. now on the poor side we find paul at the end of his life he asked timothy to bring his one cloak to him in prison when paul when he comes to see paul and this heavy coat in the greek is called a heavy coat for protection against stormy weather so he just needed like we said like this a poncho or like a park if we say parker him something like a parker right now church you and i can get on our phones wait a minute in four clicks i can have a parking here in two days with four please i gotta tuck amazon i gotta click this i'm gonna click that yeah click it two days it'll be here and paul let's look how rich we are that's that's the point i'm making look how rich we are paul although he was the messenger of the age and the prophet at the end of his life he's asking can you send me my one coat can you bring it hundreds of miles or however many miles can you make sure you don't forget my used coat he couldn't even afford a new one church no doubt there was coke shops in that city where he was in prison no doubt no doubt there was merchants who sold coats but he's like i can't even afford a coat make sure you bring my coke when you come at church each one of us we can walk right over to target right now and you can buy code if you want each one of us look at this and i believe he was the greatest christian there ever was that's just my humble opinion because all that he suffered for christ and so how where did god choose him on the continuum well he started off rich at the beginning but once he got to christ it all went downhill after that all went downhill he couldn't even afford a brand new coat now i'm going to preach later on paul's work life in most cases i don't have the scriptures right today in most cases paul would go into a city and what would he do he started making texts right away he was a tet maker now there's all kinds of different tents i was studying it there's leather tents uh there's cotton tanks there's all kinds there's all kinds of special designs if you want to make an intent for a rich person but it was all it was all handwork it just you work with your hands all day long and the bible said he'd make tents and then on saturday that was the day off he'd go preach in the churches he'd work six days a week making tents but on the sabbath day you go preach and try to persuade them now look imagine all the rich guys walking past them six days a week you make me a tent yeah yeah i'll get on i'm trying to get this one done by next week because i'm working on two other tents for these other groups and then on saturday he's the one standing up trying to persuade jesus christ is the son of god he's done miracles in my life and the bible said some believe something didn't just a humble man amen look at that none of his life i can't even afford a new coat you know the story of the rich man in lazarus god made one rich and one poor praise god that reminds us of jesus words he said uh matthew 19 23 malachi then jesus said his disciples very lasting to you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven church let's let's not put that on somebody else let's put that on ourselves that's right that's right in other words i'm gonna need god's supernatural power in this rich nation i am still gonna need god's supernatural power to be remember the poor so i can be saved hey man no no no no don't get me wrong we're already saying by grace through faith i'm just saying take wisdom take heed to a warning praise god that's right and it's a it's a red letter word praise or whether that is jesus christ warning us we're the age of riches so god help us to remember the poor praise god in later ones on these i'm going to show how if we're really diligent we can really do compound interest and within 20 30 years you can do i mean you can really a cure a lot of wealth but you got to start saving now that's what i'm always saying like i'm going to start tomorrow i'm going to start next week or once i get this paid off so i'm going to share some more of my testimonies on there too by god's grace there are steps you want to follow so that's what i'm praying for now i'm just you know i'm praying for one specific area financially and then if once if once i get victory in that area like i said that actually open up many more opportunities to be generous so jesus said the rich are hardly saved let's apply this to laodicea so we have prophetically and statistically fewer and fewer people are going to be saved right jesus said fewer and fewer are saved the the pyramid comes up brothers are at the very top of the pyramid waiting for the capstone the rapture he said and our ministry has to be flat right our ministry has to be totally flat so it can receive the pyramid in other words our ministry must look just like jesus christ's ministry amen amen so may god help us praise god god help us to have the character of jesus christ i remember this psalm 37 25 i have been young and now i'm old yet i've not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed bacon bread now we know this is just probability this is a this is a wisdom scripture right because lazarus was saved the poor beggar lazarus and he was begging bread david never seen it it's like he lived in a time of uh prosperity i said he he lived in like a lameness in time a lot of prosperity he never seen a righteous man begging but here jesus gives an example of a righteous man begging the dogs were licking sores the dogs i was telling austin about my mom you know when she had cancer she had black swords i forgot about that all over her back and people say oh she wasn't healed or like like people might die oh i don't believe in miracles my mom's my mom and dad's salt there's black bruises everywhere and then a prayer and just soon after that week later they're all gone because jesus is the healer praise god hallelujah so see david lived in a time there was a time of well all the righteous people never had to beg but then in jesus time a thousand years later there were some righteous that were begging bread okay so see god has ordained uh god may ordain your life for more wealth or for less wealth now right now church if we look at our state we can kind of see where god's taking us like i'm 41. i mean retirement's only 20 23 years away for me i've already put 18 years in i mean i'm towards the middle i can kind of see the trajectory you know unless something happens right kind of see where we're going now the younger you are of course the more you want to invest and the more things can happen okay but remember we all want to we all want god's plan for our life the lord is the maker of us all he's got a spiritual portion for you to uh deal with to be faith over and he's got a natural monetary portion you're supposed to be faithful over as well okay now i'm going to switch over to some brother brown quotes here so i just want to get that thought across so you can switch over here i'm going to uh show a few quotes here about god's place now here's a little look at remember brother ramses when i went over this years ago remember when kevin simon were here that when they were coming to our church i preached on finances i remember cam saying even when he preached on money it was anointed and i'm like well lord annoy me for today because i i don't feel it all the time yeah you preach all money it's like oh it's gonna be a hard sermon everybody's gonna be you know thinking about money and i don't wanna be a failure lord i need money you know things like that you think about all the trials that are associated with money right financial trials but i trust the lord will bless you here even more i said we'll try to finish up here in a little bit by god's grace you're at 12 30 right man yeah dory now here let's look at a few thoughts here about brother graham's financial testimony here now of course um i shared with this with you on wednesday brother ram in the church age book uh wrote about john wesley i don't know if lee vale did this research or not i actually couldn't find it in the actual sermon but anyways he was talking about john wesley's a church age messenger his favorite saying on the subject of money was get all you can save all you can and give all you can now brother bam said he wesley was not a rich man on purpose he could have been a rich man but he was not a rich man and he chose that on purpose okay now like i told you with with me i have two incomes my wife has income so that's something you want to pray about but don't let those incomes take you away from the house of god and especially your personal time with the lord don't let us your income now you think well brother jessica what do you mean you work well for my i got to prepare a sermon so every saturday morning i'm here i'm usually here at the church or studying by 5 30 a.m until like 12 or 1 or 2. that's my second job that's when i'm working you know that's where i make that's where i make that extra income you know that's work like i said during school year i work seven days a week i don't get any days off so that that's just god's calling for my life you know so that that's how you get all you can like i was telling austin you know you find hours and you're weak oh i could put do a little side job here i can do a little i see little errors here if i can just increase that uh you know i can let's say you could get 200 extra dollars a month you could put that down on your debt you know put that down in the house or put that down and pay off the debt whatever it would be so john wesley says get all you can save all you can and then give all you can as well praise god i just love that beautiful uh beautiful quote there from john wesley something to keep in mind there by god's grace now uh you remember this the man was doing church order uh right after christmas in 1963. brother branham said he kept books of his money at his house and he said people would come by his house and say i'm reverend so-and-so i had some trouble down the road i need a new set of tires and i know that i just come from the meeting and had an offer now look at this look at this look at how god arranges this brother i just got a love offering from a church he comes home and the first thing is uh preacher yes i need some new tires do you have any money and like he can't lie right he just got back from the meeting he just got a love offering he's like well sure i want to help another preacher i'll get you some tires at church how much would tires cost today if you get good ones it's over four hundred or five hundred dollars unless they got some savings you know buy three get one free like that like that's a real reality they probably jack up the price anyway just tried to save you but look and look i he said i'd give him a set of tires and look in the minutes there was never such a minister that never lived in such a place so he knew he was he knew he was being deceived right but he just wanted to give and there is 10 or 20 000 so some range 10 or 20 000 on the books from these years that i give out like that never know nothing about them where they was so it's people that come by and say hey sister or they say uh pastor can i borrow a hundred bucks sure and then you never see him again hey oh brother can i borrow 500 what's your name oh okay i'll text you you text him you never hear back from you ever had that before i've had that oh i'll text you and yeah we come to church or you want to go in a book or something like that come to find out other ministers say why he got me for so so much money con artist [Laughter] i said the church now is not responsible only for their own see that's the only time i'll give out money to usually uh i give out money to other people right out of my ties is when i know everybody's got what they need here you got food shelter we got all things in god see that's what a church is a church i'm responsible for your well-being amen praise god that's why i told you let me know if you're struggling i want to help you out by god's grace right that's why we're here i want to take care of my own i want to take care of my my season right and i'm a machine too you know we're all she praise god he says that's right that's their own responsibility so 10 to 20 000 over the years sometimes a scam artist not always but sometimes a scam artist now i showed us a brother austin did you know bill graham he went out to eat every sunday between services when he was in jeopardy now this even a brother he uh emailed me this week overseas he's from india he's like can i go take a test on sunday or is it a sin to miss church well if it's a sin to miss church and work on sunday then brother graham was helping these people sin because they were working at a restaurant and the church said hello see we all know not everybody's gonna be saved right but the same time do we believe everybody should worship on sunday yeah is everybody going to worship on sunday no very few are going to actually that's why i tell people when you used to go to giant eagle place i said thanks for working on the sunday i appreciate you working today because you helped out my family i used to tell that when you go to chipotle i said hey thanks for working today i really appreciate that that gives my wife a day off now things are different now that's okay that's just it there's times and seasons for everything but look at that last sunday i was going into the blueboard cafeteria it's still there today if you want to go you can go to the blueboard eat there it's a buffet now i heard some guys talking about it where i think about 80 percent of the congregation gathers on the sunday afternoon does that sound like that's how we all used to go to chipotle on sunday you got your chipotle back i got mine you got your we all got your bullet back that's how churches are right eighty percent of the brown tabernacle would after first service they go eat the blue bar eat out and they all come back for the evening service that's just humans right that's just human nature it's nice to get a meal isn't it nice to get a meal that you have to cook right but you got to balance that when things get tight when inflation comes up you got a good got to cut some costs somewhere right like for me i could have cut costs other places and still going on to eat but to me the best fix was just to stop eating out right and i've been through this before like i said i we used to do this we used to eat peanut butter and jelly with baby lydia okay well everybody went out to eat we'd be eating peanut butter and jelly now how much money did brother brandon have saved three years before he passed away how much do you have in his bank account he told us he told us i said where in the world would i ever get forty thousand dollars so brother graham had the irs investigate him because he would go to meetings and uh people would write donations and he would just sign him william branham and then put him in the church bank account well that was that was wrong he should not have taken any money in his name because if he does that then he has to pay taxes on that right so whoever these must be devil possessed finance guys right these irs guys they went back through all of his records and found he owed forty thousand dollars on taxes now he really didn't but because he signed them he had yeah he had to take responsibility for the taxes and so they said you gotta pay back forty thousand dollars that's a lot of money i'm gonna show you how much that money that is today with inflation you think 40 000 is a lot now you should have been there in 1962. he said i said you know my bank account here is said about a hundred dollars or maybe less he had three kids this time three kids right sarah rebecca joseph billy paul's already married out of the house with his second wife you know that's wrong but made a mistake where would i get 40 some thousand dollars and i said i've got nothing for collateral i haven't got it that's all i love this because if you're serving god and you have some something come up god will make a way to help you out amen when you have nothing you can trust the the god who owns a cattle on a thousand idols praise god amen i thought i like this church i found in most cases god always sends me the relief right before the big cost comes right i share that on wednesday i didn't know all these all these things were going to break one after another cars fridges i didn't know they're going to break god knew they're going to break and so god said it right before they all broke because god has a sense of humor praise god and god is a faithful father amen amen hallelujah glory just like joseph that prayed lord you know the integrity of my heart praise god amen we can say the same thing financially lord you know i've been i've used integrity i've been honest i paid my tithes give offerings lord you know the integrity of my heart just send some blessing i need your help i need some financial assistance say it lord and heavenly father says yes i will praise god at least that time i don't know about these future times right we don't know he may let us go through struggles especially before the rapture who knows the squeeze they're going to have control over all finances that's where this is digital currency is going to right that's the only way they can stop all all spending and buy is to make everything digital likely likely so let's look at these costs so how much did brother graham have in his bank account less than 981 dollars that's today's money so he didn't even have that emergency a thousand like i was telling you about like you like all of us could do it's his bank account if you want to look at it today we've been about 900 900 850 bucks something something like that but he gave away somewhere between 10 or 20 000 he gave away nearly 98 to 196 thousand dollars today's money now how much did he owe church to the irs he owed almost 400 000 in today's money almost half a million dollars church that's how much you do but i love this story because it has a happy ending god provides first children praise god now here's where he tells where how he paid off that forty thousand dollars anybody remember how he paid it out we went down to the bank i got brothers right here in this church that stood on my note and i put a note in and got the forty thousand dollars and paid it off so numerous brothers come together hey you give five thousand you give ten you give four thousand three thousand these brothers come together and gave brother brandon forty thousand dollars to get out of debt oh hallelujah amen see how god had to send some rich people to his church to take care of the poor preacher see that amen hallelujah so see you know for our day which one are you gonna be are you the poor one that people got to help out you might be or give me the one that has more wealth and you can help out somebody else you see it's still the same body of christ right so god has to have some more wealthy to help out those who are not and god found it fit that his prophet was not very wealthy so god had actually at least one millionaire in the church that's right at least one millionaire in the church to help out brother brandon and look what he says i put i went and put my arm around my wife i said honey i'm free what a feeling to be free and so now i can pay it back now no i don't know if he ever did church i don't know if you ever paid those brothers they lived from this this was 19 basically 1963 two three only lived three more years now look what he says i can pay it back at four thousand dollars a year now i can't loaf anymore now look he caught himself low now of course he wasn't a loafer but he just felt bad because all the other brothers are working and he just preaches and goes from convec convention to venture he called himself a loafer but he was really doing the work of jesus christ amen isn't that so humble i just love our progress i'm i'm done loafing i'm gonna go work hard now like praying for the sick is hard preaching is hard that is hard work he said i can't loaf anymore folks i got to go out and go to work it takes me 10 years to pay it back if jesus doesn't come and when that when he does all that so be all settled down anyhow i already believe that god's got a poor preacher that's okay i've got a couple of millionaires in there to pay off the preachers then praise god i love it god is god is so faithful oh yes so who was the millionaire this guy was a millionaire bill dowd those out there on tape many times brother baptized him when he was older than 90 and he was the father of sister marilyn we saw her a couple years ago she's still alive her husband brother tom passed away but we stayed at their house one time because they go to they used to go to bible believers i think she still goes to bible university in lima ohio so the millionaire was billed out i forget how he got his money um but just to give an idea so god knew the irs was going to attack brother branham he's going to have almost a 400 000 debt as far as today's money so god had to have an old man millionaire going to brother brother brother god's church and say i want to get saved i don't know i want to serve jesus christ that's the brother i'm baptizing at 90 years old praise god and then there he was and because he was retired a millionaire he followed over the red you can hear it on tape he fouled around all around the nation just driving he and his old wife 90 years old driving at every meeting there's brother and sister dab you can hear him say it on tape god had to raise up a millionaire to take care of their debts i said god you can still do it today amen is that right amen now look he paid it off three years before he died it wasn't like oh now my debts are free now i can become a millionaire that that wasn't my favorite idea he was just thankful to have this debt off him and his family you see god knows what you need god knows what you need he went through years of suffering i think it was like five or six years forty thousand dollars all these years of suffering and then finally got send somebody who can pay off his debt now also just so you know this church we school we used to go to church that was where i was ordained to preach that's where lydia was dedicated and that's where i was married at their church uh and by believers of lyman this guy at when he died he was a mater he let all the money uh be inherited to them and then they set up a foundation to build the church there now a foundation is when you have a lot of money you invested okay so let's say it was a million dollars well they put that in stock market right they invest in stocks and bonds and other things roth iras and it makes investments and they get more money well because of this man and their dedication they still have a school there all this guy's investments is reaching down one generation two generation it's like three his his millionaire money is still benefiting the children of god like three or four generations later that's what if god makes you wealthy that's what you want to do crazy and now they don't have to send those school those kids to those some of those bad things we got some good public schools here we're thankful for that everyone has you guys go too i don't know if you know that there was that air heads but they don't have those parents they're alive they don't have to send their kids to the public school where there might be questionable teachers things like that they can send them to the christian school all because one man and his wife were burdened right and god knew they'd have a need and that this wealth now this this million dollars or maybe it was multi-million is now blessing the children of god three or four generations later that's called influence praise god what's the word i was looking forward for a different word that's called legacy that's what that means that's called what's another word for legacy yeah you got one with the tip of your tongue a second brain legacy destiny destiny legacy something like that you know you leave a legacy like this is a legacy that's impacting thousands of people right and so also yeah i don't know how many brothers in the church this man hired he had a uh business remember this brother uh he had a cleaning business or a cleaning supplies business so like all the paper towels in there in our bathroom paper towels toilet paper sprays pinging sprays rags you know gloves he had a million dollar business too and i don't know how many brothers he employs right now still it's called brown uh brown supply company his name's tom brown he pays the salaries of like numerous brothers in the message and so they you know they they get a good income they never work sundays they never work wednesday nights see when you're the boss you can determine the work schedule hey you praise god amen she makes me want to be a business owner but i'm just not that smooth at least that was well you never know you never said you never know what's going to happen some of you guys might have a good idea somebody might start a good business center we'll see it's the lord terrorists with more terrorism sure see how see how being faithful with money can help you bless thousands of people and especially god's people if you're just faithful but god is putting your hands i don't want to be faithful i'm almost done here i'm almost done he said now when they rebuilt webster when they renovated the bram tabernacle they made it about a third larger and if you've ever visited there you can see where it used to be smaller and then they expanded it by like a third other women i've been there and many great donors in the church that helped do it such as our brother dial and sister dao sitting here and many others that's donated heavy to this cause so why did god have to send millionaires there to get his profit out of debt away from the government attacking him and to make the church larger because they were overflowing they have enough seats we don't have but see god had descendants of millionaires in order to meet the needs so what am i saying god will always meet our needs if we continue to humble ourselves and seek him and work hard little by little god will bless us if we labor and sow and reap god will bless us and then we can do god's will praise god amen we can influence this generation of the lord there is more generations praise god isn't that something because of one man's faithfulness all these generations are benefiting and blessed it's just a beautiful it's a beautiful thing what god can do uh with finances little random said i could have had it in other words to pay for his his 40 000 debt i could have took the money people would give me i'd be more than a millionaire i could have had stray of buildings you wouldn't have to rent this so i guess they offered motherboard buildings maybe i'd say come on in take over see you don't have to run a building but my i've tried to think that make jesus christ my pattern this is what he did now we can't all do this right what if brother dow didn't what if brother dial made jesus this battered brother ramsey would have that debt to see some people are called to really give everything away but then others are called to be really successful handling money so they can help others get out of debt don't you think the same god who gets you out of debt or if you're poor or helps you get somebody like that don't you think the same guy's going to risk the reward both of them yes absolutely god's going to reward both of them because one was focused on preaching right he didn't want to work out there he wanted to spend all this time preaching and praying for the sick but the other was businessman good deals buy sell margin profit but find sell expand build one guy was like that the other guy i'm just preaching i don't know i don't want i don't want the money i don't want the big don't give me the millions don't give me the buildings i just want to preach stay just like jesus christ and yet jesus anointed him to make millions today to help out the one who didn't have me he said look i've tried to make jesus my power look jesus could have created fish right he could have created money he could make water from wine or wine for water he could feed with thousands of two fishes and a loaf of two of bread but yet he didn't have a place to lay his head he was our example not something to shine but something that glows the gospel but yet god has millionaires right who seem like they can make one deal and man they can it's almost like they can make money up here they can sell this sell that that's how tim myers was brother he can just do a deal man and just make all that money like how do you do that man he just built that wage financially you see the effects of it i remember when he called me up he said oh man i'm at a quarter million dollars in sales for the year he said my goal for next year is half a million and they said my goal for next year is a million and he reached all those goals you see some people are built that way now those of us that are better be rich in the good works or else those riches will ensnare you'll get trapped in something with with money and sin right the other man makes jesus example it's like bill dao made solomon his example or david right or some wise investor but both were led by the holy spirit praise god now did you remember this brother graham got tempted remember this the denominations a brother named brother pope i don't know if you remember this on tape just from this sermon a denominational brother named brother pope come to program and say brother it's a shame by what you do look what are you you can hardly afford buy yourself a meal he's trying to get him to leave his the truth and come over and denominations i said look at oral roberts and i'm stepped in and look look out there 100th of the ministry you got look at what they do i said yeah that's right oral roberts has not even 100 percent of my ministry he said my group will take you and we'll take you right in you'll be one of the nomination brothers we'll give you the right hand of fellowship and we'll charter a plane and give you wages of five hundred dollars a week he was making a hundred a week at that time so times five he said i'll i'll times five your income now think about your income right now what if somebody offered you five times that to leave the message would you do it what means more to you money or the gospel amen or more if you want it and we'll send you to every major city in the country this happened right in phoenix and brother and says now what what are the conditions i don't know the quote up here i don't have the next quote but i said what are the conditions he said well you're gonna have to get you have to let off on the women preachers and the initial evidence and the baptism in the name of jesus he said brother pope i'm so ashamed he said a man that would call me a prophet and ask me to compromise on the things that mean more to life than me amen praise god more than life is the word of god that's right i'll give you five times what you make somebody gave me five times i mean it'll be a lot of money but it wouldn't be worth nothing if we compromise on god's word make it rich real quick but rich in the wrong type of riches you want to be rich in faith hey man hallelujah yeah i'm going to finish this and we'll close by so they offered brother branham today five thousand dollars a week that's a long way or a cool over a quarter million dollars a year that's weird it's five times more than he was making if you'll just compromise on these things we can make you rich oh and then we'll fly you around too you don't have to drive he would drive that forward that four you see the sports station wagon it's a station wagon brother this long skinny thing you got a station lagging around the country god's prophet we could fly you around you're just compromising the truth but god's prophets never compromised [Applause] no matter what you're throwing from me no matter all the benefits all these things i'm not going to compromise remember hattie wright remember hattie wright she she said i'm gonna i'm gonna pledge fifty dollars to the tabernacle when this other guy's given hundreds of thousands program says she gave us 20 bucks to begin with he was going to give her 20 bucks back and the holy spirit said don't give it to him and he said why lord and he said the lord put it on his heart and said it's just like jesus when jesus let the widow give the two mighties now look how much did she make a year church their farm that she worked on made less than 200 a year on that little old farm 200 today is about 2 000. can you imagine having two thousand dollars to live on this year i know someone who's pretty close to them because they're on government assistance right so brother brother i was making 100 a week right so brother man was making this and that's what the person made that's what sister heidi wright made per year brother i made this per week almost half my brother i was going to go give the 20 back and jesus the holy spirit said don't give it back she's just like the widow in the bible all right and brother anderson specifically said this the holy spirit told me before we went over there and the third poll operated that's right you see god was going to bless her in a different way that so what's more valuable now see this also church proves god has a call for your life whether it be more poor or middle or higher god has a call for your life because god gave brother dao with us saith the lord as well she got to thus saith the lord the poor woman didn't but also the millionaire god blessed him see because god is not a uh god's not a favorite god doesn't have favorites there it is he's not a respecter of persons sorry the scripture's slipped by mine god's not a respecter of persons and god has a certain place and now remember with the widow woman you can give actually more than the rich people if you give more of your percentage of your income you can actually have greater rewards in heaven than the millionaire right because you know the millionaire is going to keep five million for himself in case of that happens right right i'm a millionaire i'm going to keep this so much i always have a safety net but the widow was like i got no safety net all i got is the safety net in heaven that's all i got two fifths two two-fifths of a penny not even half a penny she gave i looked it up two-fifths of a penny and jesus said she gave more than all the others because she gave out of her need not out of her excess that's a picture of sister hattie and the boys he's got a good testimony uh he was going to go out to war and he said brother ma'am i don't want to die should i go to war he said go right right before brother died he said go you'll be protected and so he went over to korea or vietnam was it i can't remember which one it was and he said he had he had the safest job in the entire place he was just a gas truck driver and brother man told him you'll be safe so you come back i don't know what happened to him but he's got a little testimony in the book their sister had two thousand dollars a year income but god gave her both her sons be saved see thus say the lord operated in both of their lives brother dao and sister wright the ram said that humble little woman had you right the first time this ever happened the third pole was upon a human being was on a little humble one who's the first one oh just like the resurrection who did jesus show the first resurrection to a former prostitute with seven devils amen mary magdalene praise god but see god was rewarding her for her faithfulness praise god god was lifting her up out of her humble despised condition she gained spiritual riches instead of natural riches amen amen and so god did he said i'll do the same thing with the third pole i'll operate it first i'll open up the word the power of the word the spoken word i'll open that up on a widow woman but it's two kids and farms on a hill and makes two thousand dollars a year i'll i'll operate on her first that's what god does here's where brother dao was dying this is brother dallas testimony he said brother that was a trophy of god's grace when shaking his hand under the tent oxygen teddy was under i said brother thou you'll be all right i'll see you in the church again that's thus saith the lord see here he sits in the church right here brother died so the man was dying in a tent they had to have oxygen intense and he said thus saith the lord i'll see you in church again 90 year old man and thus saith the lord came to pass see god does not respect your persons god has the calling for your life if you'll accept it how many one accepted by god's name let's stand to our feet as we stand musicians can come remember a brother said god had something for that widow who gave the two minds he was going to give that money back to sister hattie we said oh no sister don't do that no because we got plenty here we don't need that but jesus never told her not to do it he let her go ahead and do it because he knowed he had something for her down the road little something better you see so he just let her god love a cheerful gift like i was telling lena i had a good question god needs a poor person who's a cheerful giver just like he needs a rich person who's a cheerleader god needs someone who's going to overcome cancer or die with cancer or die in a car accident still holy ghost for a
