father at the conclusion will give you the glory bless this reading of our Lord as we learn from the in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise God let's say on our feet here let's take our Bibles here to go to Revelation chapter 19 let's continue on this revelation series kind of feeling led to do that so we'll look to the Lord here Revelation chapter 19 this ibly this is part 100 I think of this series we're kind of hitting a milestone there but let's ask the Lord to help us here as we read his word revelation 19 I just want to choose a scripture later in the chapter to kind of build off of this thought as we look at revelation 19 revelation 19 I like to just read verse 20 I want to start this chapter by looking at teaching on the beast and the mark of the beast I want to start there and then we'll look at the different topics and key revelations in this chapter so revelation 19 verse 20 there's numerous themes in this chapter but let's look at verse 20 I like to look at the mark of the beast here to begin with tonight by God's grace first 20 let's read it together it's a long one but let's read it everybody gives a chance to read the Word of God verse twenty on three one two three and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped His image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone quite a sobering scripture but it's in the scripture nonetheless and God's a God of justice God's a serious God God's a loving God but he's also a judge as well praise God so may God has blessing the reading of word you may be tonight we're beginning revelation 19 tonight we'll see how many sermons looks like maybe two or three we'll get from this as you probably noticed we spent the majority of the sermons on Revelation chapters 1 2 3 4 5 afters and of course we had a lot we had numerous Bert or sermons I think we had five or six verse or sermons rather on revelation 17 and 18 so now we're getting toward the end hard to believe we're almost at the end of the book already preaching every verse but let's look at a few themes here now the themes in order are the first theme is heavens praise to God at the judgment of the great so we see that at the begin of the chapter verses 1 to 6 and then verses 7 to 10 is the second theme which is the marriage supper of the Lamb praise God how many want to be there how many know you've been invited there praise God thank God all you have to do church is receive the invitation receive the gift of the Holy Ghost praise God that's the invitation then you've got to see that that table praise God there's a lot of banquets going on a lot of parties going on this weekend especially tomorrow there's parties in Washington DC there's parties all over the place but the one main celebration I want to be a part of is the marriage supper of the Lamb praise God that's the one I do I'll give up everything to make sure I'm at that party but we know it's not a party we know it's it's a supper praise the Lord and then verses 11 to 21 is Christ's return to the earth a white horse at the Battle of Armageddon that's a sobering portion of Scripture and if we're real Holy Ghost field Christians will be there but we won't be on the earth we'll be with him in the sky praise God and so that's a great promise that we're given and we want to make sure we make ourselves ready for that which is of course is in this chapter where the bride makes herself ready but I would like to now look at the mark of the beast and in verse 20 of Revelation 19 the Bible says that the the whole world was deceived by the miracles of the false prophet and the beast and they deceived them on the earth to receive the mark of the beast and to worship His image and be the consequence of taking the mark and worship the image was being cast alive in the lake of fire so there's few things that could be as serious as this topic here tonight my because the punishment for is being tossed in the lake of fire where the Bible said you'll burn forever now not eternally because you can't burn eternally unless you have eternal life and God is too merciful to let sinners burn eternally God is too merciful for that picture let's say someone's a 16 year old you know a 16 year old high school student and they let's say they hear the gospel they're raised in church and all those years let's say you know they get to the age of accountability whether it's 8 or 12 or 10 you know the role or the the Mormon Church has it's I believe I believe they say that's what their prophet revealed to them that 8 is the age of accountability well we don't really understand year-old teenager was raised in church all those years and kept turning down the gospel turning around the gospel let's say they go out one night they get drunk they get in a car accident and they die and let's say they only lived you know eight years in disobedience or four years or six years in disobedience to the Holy Spirit and let's say they blaspheme the Holy Spirit and they made fun of people who spoke in tongues at church or prophesied or dancing the Holy Spirit of church or they made fun of them and their soul is lost now God as a merciful God is not going to let that person burn eternally because he's too merciful praise God now someone like Hitler who ordered you know the death of over six million Jews now of course we know he'll have the Bible set a greater condemnation he may burn for let's say 20 million years or he may burn to me tormented for let's say 15 million years he'll Brees gonna burn a long time he's gonna burn a lot longer than that 16 year-old teenager who turned down the Holy Ghost and made fun of the Holy Ghost so we know that God is not going to let them burn eternally because God is too merciful for that in church we saw last week that the mark of the beast and the mark of God is available and it has been available ever since the Garden of Eden amen oh yeah we're able was marked with a mark of God amen and because he had the mark of God he gave the right sacrifice and it made Cain so upset that Cain of course had the mark of the beast and he slew his brother because his brother was righteous and his works were not righteous amen and Cain proved he had the mark of the beast because God offered him the perfect will of God and he turned it down he got upset with God and he didn't want to obey God's Word proving he had the mark of the beast but Church we know today the marks available today to us amen and we the way were marked is by obeying the Word of God hey man that's why we're here tonight t here's word and obey the word and leave out of here better Christians more obedient Christians and when we came in praise God amen that's why we're here tonight now if you have your Bibles let's go to Revelation 13 17 and let's see there's going to be three ways people will take the mark of the beast after the rapture after Jesus snatches away his New Testament Holy Ghost filled Church because that's what the word caught up means in the Greek is snatch away to seize away quickly Jesus gonna quickly seize away the church in the rapture take them away like a thief in the night praise God and those that remain will the entire Earth will be forced to take the mark of the beast at one particular time and there's three ways they can take it now like we said it may culminate in a computer chip or something in their palm or in their hand or their forehead but we know it has to start with something spiritual because the same spiritual mark has always been here right the choice has always been here to take the mark of God the spiritual mark of God or the spiritual mark of the devil right so revelation 13 17 says this it says and that no man might buy or sell save that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name so after the rapture of the church Satan is going to have such a power politically and such a power ecclesiastically over the church that he's going to be able to force everyone to take a mark to buy or sell so he will have control over the bank system he will have control over every nation that we know there'll be one where there will be one world church there'll be one world government in other words all the governments will agree to work together financially right so it's going to come to pass where everyone is going to have to either take them the mark or the name or the number of his name so each one is fully proven in the scripture so let's look at the first one the first one is that a mark and the Bible said it can be in the right hand or in the forehead so the right hand symbolized in the Bible one who has a promise or makes an oath of allegiance to do the works of the beasts under the disguise of peace and safety so after the rapture that the government's are going to say let's all have peace and safety that's all peace and safety everyone needs to take this mark if you don't take this mark you're terrorists right that's what they're going to say because they're going to be saying peace and safety and and forcing people to take this mark so they're going to call everyone who doesn't agree with their system they're gonna call them a terrorist and say oh you want to start Wars and you want to go against the world Church in the world government and so they'll force them to try to take a mark now if you have your Bibles this is quite a good thought here let's go to a scriptures go to Psalms 144 maybe you never seen this but it's kind of been opening up here recently as you look to the scripture now remember we set on Sunday with rightly dividing the word of truth that the way to interpret the Bible is by the Bible right you take one scripture the way you understand that scripture is by looking what all the other scriptures say so if you look up the word right hand in the Bible this scripture in Psalms 144 helps you understand what the mark and the right hand means so Psalms 144 verses 8 to 11 whose mouth speaketh vanity in their right hand is the right hand of falsehood see that so what is the right hand represent a reprehensive so if they take a mark in the right hand it means they're taking an oath a false oath they're making a promise to be a part of this one world Church this one will govern they're making a promise to do the works of the Beast it's a right hand of falsehood honey remember the book of Galatians where Paul said when he came to Jerusalem he gave Peter and James the right hand of fellowship amen so see that in the right hand of their gonna obey the Word of God they're gonna have an oath a promise we're all going to keep God's Word but with the mark beasts they're taking a right hand of falsehood it's a false covenant right it's a false promise they promise all we're gonna you're going to have peace you're going to have safety but little do they know that those trumpets are going to begin sounding aim ahead huh little do they know a man named Moses and Elijah are gonna step out in Jerusalem and start interrupting nature amen hahaha and the peace and safety is going to be taken from the world so see it's a false false Union it's a false promise according to the scripture the right hand of falsehood and they'll be deceived that way now I'm gonna skip down to verse 11 rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is the right hand of falsehood so see it again it's in two portions of Scripture and that beautiful how the Bible interprets itself praise God it's a false covenant it's a false promise they say oh if you just worship on our world Church we're gonna take care of you financially we're gonna take care of you physically and they'll have no ability to do it because the wrath of God is going to be poured out on them that's right so the right hand represents a right hand of falsehood these works of these promises to do the works of the church in falsehood the the claim that they will take care of them but it's false it's not true right now the mark now also yeah let's read another scripture let's read Deuteronomy 16 5 because hand represents works so see this is where they will promise yes I'll do the works of your church system yes I'll do the works of the government so see they're there they're promising to please man and please churches rather than please Christ the word Amen but it look good it'll look like it is a Christian Church love the name of Christian churches but it'll be a right hand of falsehood so Deuteronomy 16 15 is what I said Deuteronomy 16 15 Deuteronomy 16 15 7 days shalt thou keep a solemn feast and the LORD thy God and the place which the Lord shall choose because the LORD thy God shall bless thee and all thine increase and in the works of thine hands therefore I'm sorry thou therefore thou shalt surely rejoice so hand represents the works of your hands if you're obedient got to bless the works of your hands so this is a mark in the right hand so it's a lying promise it's a lying safety it's a lying promise through the works of the wrong system they're making a lie and they're promising to do the works of the Beast now let's look at the forehead now the forehead is the bone of course that protects the area of the brain known as the frontal lobe and that's where decisions are made right behind this bone right here that's where you make all your decisions so if somebody says you got a real hard head what's that mean it means you made up your mind you're persuaded and there's no way you can change your mind so the Bible said that the these sinners that worship The Devil's church and The Devil's government will take a mark in the right hand the works or in their forehead now of course we know what this means let's go to another scripture let's go to Ezekiel 3-1 just to have some some backing here because the again the Bible has to interpret itself the Bible will not contradict itself praise God hallelujah now he's speaking to the house of Israel in Ezekiel 3 verse 1 I'm sorry did I say that if I didn't forgive me has he killed 3 verse 1 he said moreover he said unto me son a man eat that now finest eat this roll and go speak under the house of Israel isn't it awesome God always likens believing the word as eating his word he told he told his ikki I'll eat this scroll praise God and he didn't mean literally eat it he meant believe it he meant make it a part of you make this your heart's desire and that's what God told John eat the roll and then go prophesy again to every people nation and tongue and kindred amen see that's what God wants us to do eat the word believe it make it a part of us and then speak it to other people we can't be a Christian and withhold the truth from other people we've got to believe it make it a part of us and then share it with somebody else Amen hallelujah so he said eat the rule now verse 8 Ezekiel 3 verse 8 behold I have made that very strong against their faces and I for had strong against their foreheads so Godzilla tqo I'm gonna make your forehead strong because your forehead is gonna smash against their forehead you ever have a you ever have a disagreement like that you just disagree so hard with somebody it's like your foreheads are smashing against one another like they say go beat your head up against the wall right you everybody say that I was trying to talk to brother Jesse but it was like beating my head up against the wall see what that means we don't agree we don't see how we have no agreement right look at verse the next verse verse 9 3 9 as an admin it harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house amen everything Ezekiel was going to be saying there to say we don't like this preaching we're not believing that and God didn't say well it's okay Ezekiel for you to be afraid and he said no I'm gonna make you strong I'm gonna make your forehead hard as well I'm gonna make you a real solid believer Amen just that's what we need we need to be so firm we need fully persuaded that we're going to serve Jesus Christ live a holy life we're not going to live the things in the world we're only gonna love the things of God we have to be such so convinced of that that's it's as if our foreheads are smashing against the devil's forehead like the rams light like those rams got the big horns and they smash together well that's what's happening tonight praise God that's what's happening tonight except you're battling evil spirits you're wrestling against spiritual principalities and powers and the powers of the air but the Bible said you can overcome by praying and prayer and all kinds of Prayer praying for everyone and the Bible said you'll stand with the armour of God amen finally mud be strong in the Lord and the power of is my amen where's the power the powers in your mind you've made it up in your mind I'm going through with Jesus and I'm not turning back praise God see God told his Buffy I'm making your forehead firm like stone the hardest stone because their foreheads are going to be strong like stone as well so see a forehead represents your bold and unashamed and that's in the scripture too let's go let's go to Jeremiah three verse three Jeremiah three verse three Isaiah Jeremiah lamentations Ezekiel Jeremiah three verse three oho glory see when you when you are really marked in your forehead what that means is you're unashamed of the gospel of Christ you're unashamed zekiel is God so don't be ashamed you don't don't be moved by their faces if the people give you mean looks while you're preaching don't be ashamed just preach the word amen and most you give me smiles tonight I appreciate that I don't feel like I'm beating up against anybody's for it because you're all believers thank God for that but there's been a few services in the past where I felt like I've been beaten my forehead against other people's foreheads but that's the way it has to be Church because God's Word God's people have to stand they have to pass the test amen and then if you pass the test that Bible said your faith will be more precious than gold amen hallelujah and it's done through a forehead in other words a mine that's so convinced that Christ is them are your Lord and your Messiah that you're not turning back Jeremiah 3 verse 3 therefore the showers have been with Holden and there have been no latter rain now hats off a horse for head now refuses to be ashamed so just like the prostitute on the street that refuses to be ashamed of her immoral life that's how Israel was they were refused to be ashamed no matter what the preachers preach no matter what the Word of God said they didn't care they were unashamed they just lived however they wanted so you and I ought to thank God if we feel ashamed when we sin we ought to say praise the Lord right because Israel's had a spot where they didn't even feel ashamed if you put something on Facebook that wasn't right you ought to be ashamed you ought to take it down if you text somebody the wrong thing you ought to be ashamed to yourself and say please forgive me right you and I need to feel the shame of the Holy Spirit in other words the Holy Spirit Jesus said we'll can when the Holy Spirit comes in your life he'll convict you of sin aim ahead you'll be convicted of sin when if you're really sensitive to the Holy Spirit so see the mark in the hand is a false it's a false works that you're gonna agree to do the work of the Swart world church system the mark in the forehead is you believe all of their doctrine unashamedly right so instead of crying out against all the sins in the world they just go along with it and say it's okay we're all going to be saved anyway right that universalism lie over - the Bible says in Ezekiel 9 the Bible says he tells that writer with the ink court he says go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those inside cry against the abominations done in the city have praised God Amen God said take holy spirits and take that mark a Matt and Mark it on their forehead of those who are so brother William they were they were so then they tried everything they could to try to get people to stop sitting so their last hope was to come to church and cry out to God and say God have mercy it makes me cry makes me weep my favorite fans and family keep sitting they keep living in sin and they won't repent and so God said those people that are so burden for sin that they'll come to church and cry and plead with God one-on-one in prayer he said I love that so much put a mark in their forehead that they're unashamed of cry out to God Amen oh that's what we need to be tonight praise God unashamed of the gospel that we cry out when when people won't receive the word we still cry and pray that's God to forgive them see both God followers and beast followers are going to be marked one way or another right you're going to be marked one way or another now I just that just remind me I believe this is a little bit inspiration the Holy Spirit but if you have your Bibles go to Acts chapter three just for a moment I read the scripture today and it really inspired me I'll property a full sermon at some point I'm just gonna bring it out because it's fresh inspired me go to x3 let's go to verse 18 see both sides are gonna be marked God's followers and then Satan's followers they're both going to be marked we've got the mark of God they have the mark of the devil verse 18 but those things which God before has shown by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled right Christ died on the cross he suffered he bought sins not verse 19 swear I want to get to repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord amen now since we're here let me 2021 and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you now look at verse 21 Jesus Christ cannot come back in the rapture until all things are restored so everything in this Bible that Satan is taking away down through the two thousand years all the teaching that's been lost it all has to be brought back and then Jesus will come back amen look that's what the scripture says whom the heaven must receive see heaven has got to keep Jesus until the times of restitution which means restoration of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets in the world began amen so see all the truth that Satan is stole from the church God is going to give it back to the true church and once she's got all of it and once she's living on it then Jesus will come back and take her away he's going to come snatch away it say it's time for our marriage supper darling it's time for our wedding reception now well both have said the meeting in the air will be the wedding and it'll take his rod to the wedding reception amen oh yeah and then the Millennium they go their honeymoon for a thousand years amen oh that's right church praise God but the thought I wanted to pull out of there was verse 19 Revelation I'm sorry acts 3:19 repent that your sins and be converted that your sins may be blotted out look at this it's beautiful it's not just struck me today but the bang God's gonna brought out one of two things either he's gonna blot out our sins or he's gonna blot our name off the book of life he's gonna do he's got that power that blood he's got them and that blood blots things out right that blood erases sin or if that blood is not appreciated it races names off the book of life praise God so let's read that Revelation chapter 2 that's a new thought that struck me I never knew this brother William till today God Christ is gonna blot blot something with you one way or another he's gonna blot your name off or he's gonna brought your sins off all blood off my sins Jesus a let have a normal name Amen let my name not be missing in heaven let the Angels confess my name amen hallelujah Revelation chapter 2 if I'm not mistaken was in the second church aid your third see it just kind of came to me today I'll have to find it maybe it's a Thyer your church age let me look it up real quick I thought I would find it easier than that yep I'm sorry around we're looking the wrong chapter sorry yeah Thank You Lydia revelation 3:5 appreciate that honey he's it overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels eh hey Matt hi glory he's either gonna blot out one or the other the Bible said you have a list like a paper of ordinances that you I'm sorry of sins you've done against the ordinance of God and Jesus either gonna blot out all that sin against you so you have you have no sin on your account or he's gonna go the book of life and blot out the people's names who don't repent of their sins see the power of repentance when you say I'm no longer gonna cuss I'm no longer gonna hate my mother or father an order to fornicate or commit adultery I'm no longer gonna steal I'm gonna change I'm going to repent there's so much power in that that Jesus takes his blood and he blacks out all the sins that are against him amen it's so powerful praise God but if people won't do that if they won't repent Jesus will take his blood and he'll brought their name off the book of life so he's going to block something that pertains to us one way or the other praise God see that was kind of fresh to me today I didn't realize that but he's broadening out something pertaining to you and I amen he's only gonna do it if you overcome praise God he only does it for the overcomers praise God she must overcome all the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life if we overcome that he said I'm not brought your name I'll let your name remain on the book of life oh thank you lord raise god thank you Jesus and then he said I'll confess your name before my father oh hi Lou you know Graham said there's nothing sweeter than for you to hear your own name Jesus will say Malachi Smith I confess your name you were not ashamed of me you overcame the B system on up so I'm not ashamed to call you son hey there's nothing better than hearing your name right who doesn't like to see your name in the newspaper anywhere not like that now for good reasons right you like to hear your name on the on the news I like that oh that's me well MA thank the Lord well there's nothing sweeter than hearing your name and there could be nothing sweeter than seeing the Son of God with the nail scars in his hands and the nail scars on his feet confess your name before his invisible father amen nothing sweeter than that where he said well done Lydia Smith good and faithful servant amen and turn the Joy's the Lord you were not ashamed of me so I'm not ashamed to call you friend Illya I took a quite a little while there but I just want to show you now you know so once the rapture goes they'll either take a mark in the hand they'll promise through the works of the church and the government or they'll be unashamed of the church or government and they'll take all their beliefs in their mind and so I'm not I almost I'm on the shame of this I I believe what this one world church is teaching and they'll be marked in their mind either marked in their mind or marked by their works now next second the Bible said that they'll take the the name of the beast now this could be twofold let's go to Revelation 13 let's go back there revelation 13 17 I don't mean to hurt anyone's feeling he was a Catholic who's either live streaming or here but the name of the beast is the Vicar of Christ that's the name of the beast that's right so I you know what I think I may be in a moment I'll put up here I'm not quite ready for yet but let's read revelation 13 17 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or than the name of the beast so we went over the mark the marks on the right hand oh that forehead or the name of the beast or the number of his name okay so let me show this so we got it Lydia can you switch over here I'm gonna try to go into this here so everybody can see if you don't know it the name of the beast is the Vicar of Christ the other it is okay so in the in Latin Vic eres filet de means The Vicar of the son of God and so the name of the beast is the Vicar of Christ or the vicar of the son of God and who has that title the Pope of Rome and the Bible in verse revelation 13:18 that his number is three hundred threescore and six 666 so Latin is the alphanumeric language if you take the number of the letter if you add them all up at 666 and it can be no one else because number we already preached there's eleven proofs that this woman is the Roman Catholic Church those eleven proofs and it can be no one else it can't be New York it can't be Jerusalem it can't be Istanbul Turkey it can't be any of those it can only be the Vatican in Rome there can only be that one so the name of the beast the name of the Antichrist will be the Vicar of Christ now look what it says in the Catholic Encyclopedia it says that Pope has full supreme universal power over the whole church a power which he can always exercise unhindered vicar means substitute that means substitute he's the substitute for the Son of God right now look here's some other official titles you probably didn't know the Pope as Bishop of Rome Vicar of Jesus Christ listen this one successor of the Prince of the Apostles they call him that supreme pontiff of the universal church patriarch of the West primate of Italy metropolitan Archbishop of the province of Rome sovereign of the state of Vatican City and servant of the servants of God he's the servant of the servants ah what is the name of the Beast it has to be the Vicar of the son of God he takes all these names and he exalts himself where the Bible said in them in the tribulation he'll exalt himself as God because he'll sit in the temple of God showing himself that He is God no one else on earth can take all these titles no one else even dares to take all these titles like the Pope of Rome so see they'll either take the name of the beast either the mark in the forehand I'm sorry forehead or right hand or they'll take the name so anyone that says yes dear Vicar of Christ and they call the Pope anyone that boughs to that name takes the mark of the beast and not only that church we go to revelation 17:3 let's say someone isn't really you know really big on the Pope they can still take the name of the beast another way because the Bible said the Beast is full of names of blasphemy sin other words she has many blasphemous names she revelation 17:3 see how sly Satan is he can either get you to take the muck in the hand the works the forehead where you're unashamed over there their doctrine their teachings and their ways or you could just say the Pope is the Vicar he's the son of God he's this mighty and he's gonna be a mighty miracle worker he's a great man I submit to him how I believe he's a man of God you could take the mark that way or you can take the mark by another name of the beast which is the names of blasphemy revelation 17:3 so he carried me in the way in the spirit and the weirdness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns see anytime a person is trusting in the name of a church rather than the name of Jesus Christ for salvation they've already taken a name of blasphemy for example if somebody says oh you're a Christian what are you if you say if you're proud of the fact I'm a Catholic I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal I'm a Presbyterian I'm a message I'm of this or that if we take any credit to the name outside the name of Jesus Christ we're getting close to blasphemy because this woman is full of blasphemous names right so she takes all these blasphemous names which can be Catholic Lutheran Methodist Baptist Presbyterian you any any name someone's trusting in rather than Jesus Christ is a blasphemous name because we all know church members who cuss and they blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ they'll literally say I've heard people say they go to church yet they'll say they will say the name of Jesus Christ as a cuss word see they've taken a blasphemous name right they're more loyal to their church name than they are to the name of Christ because they'll cost in the name of Christ they'll get drunk though they belong to church drunken drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of God yet they claim while I'm a good Luther I'm a good Baptist yet I get drunk at a wedding reception well you might be good Baptist but you know it's not a good Christian right and you could go with many many more sins but see these are names of blasphemy you can either take the mark in the you can either take the mark in the forehead or the hand or you can take the name of the beast in order buy or sell so as long as you you express a loyalty in a church rather than a loyalty to Christ Jesus the word you can still take the mark of the beast all right now let me move on from that one wait I'm sorry let me go to one more now this will prove it right here Church this will prove it Maya this is good revelation three verse one go to revelation three and liddy you can now switch off this and I think I don't have any more slides of the show I just want everybody to see that case they never saw that before revelation three verse one all right wherever I'm looking up another scripture because I'm gonna find a scripture here there it is yeah sorry I was looking up another one while you're turning this one sorry revelation 3 verse 1 and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works that thou has a name that thou livest see so Jesus recognized there's people and churches that are trying to live a name but they're dead spiritually amen see people say well I'm a Lutheran but yet they don't obey what Luther said so they're dead right people say well um I'm a Baptist but they don't live what the Bible says they should live right so they have a name they live but they're dead and this is common that's why the zombie movement is so popular right now brother William because that's what's it's like in the spiritual people are saying they're alive but they're really dead and that's Scripture anyone who claims to be a follower of Christ but is not born again is dead right that's what Jesus said you have a name that you live but you're dead I know this is pretty harsh preaching but it's nothing about the truth amen go to first Timothy 5 verse 6 I'll prove it to you now in this case Paul's talking about widowed women that when their husbands died he tells Timothy they should have just stayed true to the to God but instead they went and married some sinner just for sexual pleasure he said they should have remained widows 1st Timothy 5 lega verse 3 what's first Timothy 5-3 honor widows and are widows indeed but if any window have children or nephews let them learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable in before God verse 5 but she there's a widow indeed in desolate trust in God and continue with in supplications and prayers day at night and day but she that liveth in pleasure is what dead while she liveth to see that's why zombies are so popular because that's what's happening now we got a lot of spiritual zombies they're dead but they say they're alive they're living in the flesh but they don't have the life of Jesus Christ well how do you know you got the life of Jesus Christ you live by every word in the Bible amen hallelujah the Holy Spirit's living in your life you obey the word you speak the word God has pot God has given you power in your life to overcome the wicked one amen hallelujah a church and that beautiful memory see that now either take his mark or his name and that beast has many names names of blasphemy the Pope has one name the Vicar of Christ that's the name of the Antichrist so they either say okay I'll obey the Catholic teaching room I'll be the Lutheran teacher as long as I can buy and sell as long as long as I can buy or sell yep I will I'll be a good Baptist I'll be a good Methodist and don't even know they're taking the mark of the beast see Satan has all these options people could take can do the works of the church take the doctrines of the church unashamed of their doctrine take the name of the Pope they can bow to the Pope's name you can bow to a church name and the Bible said they'll be dead claiming that they're alive does everybody understand my mercy so these are what these are unconverted sin loving church members but we got to be converted holiness loving church members amen holiness loving we have to hate sin but love the holiness of God amen thank the Lord because the Bible said if any man is in Christ he's a new creature amen how many know the the joy of a new life amen all things are passed away behold all things are become new amen hi they're coming to church is new because now you got a new heart you're a new creature amen when I was a teenager I dreaded coming to church but lift up my blanket and squirt me with vinegar to get me up to go to church she take a little plastic bat and hit me until I got to go to church but now I get up at 5:00 a.m. to go to church because I'm a new creature and my mom and my wife done that to squirt squirt me in the face he got me to go to church why cuz I love coming to church what cuz jesus is my Lord amen so a new creature oh you passed away the custom the dirty movies the sports that's all passed away praise God I'm a new creature in Christ but see that'll be the one way to tart to take the the mark of the beast now the last one is what I already showed you in fact yeah I already hit two while I was there sorry but back to Revelation 13 they can take them the mark of the number of his name now that yeah his name that was the name of the Pope okay can take the number of his name or I'm sorry you take his name or the number of his name so revelation 13 17 and that and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name and that was that 666 so people can either take the Pope's name or your godly Oh Holy Father right brought Barack Obama says that Trump says they all said a holy father that's a lie he's not a holy father he's an unholy father as what he is because of his doctrine his false doctrine so you can either take that name of the Pope the Holy Father or a name of a church oh blessed Baptist and blessed Church of the Brethren or you can take the works of the hand or you can take the unashamed lies of their doctrine up here I'll just I'll just believe everything they say just so I can buy or sell I'll do whatever they say that's fine I'm unashamed of it because I need to buy or sell and that's the same thing Esau did right Church he sold out his birthright for food see so in an East halls day he took the mark of the beast but Jacob took the mark of God amen he wrestled with God until he got a new Rock amen so we need to rest them with God and three change the walk and help the walk holding holiness into the Lord haha thank the Lord now the image so go to Revelation 13 14 revelation 13 14 I'm gonna look something up again here just give me a moment okay Lydia switch well yeah let's read this then we'll switch over here just a moment but let's read this first alright revelation 13 thanks for your patience I'm there now 13 14 and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell the earth that they should make an image of the Beast which had the wound by the sword and did live now look at verse 15 and he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that an image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast to be killed okay now switch over here Lydia what is the image of the Beast the image of the Beast is a visible unity of false Christian churches and the name of it is the World Council of Churches now this is no joke this is their website now look we just read that they said let's make an image to the church and they said this is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in the one faith one Eucharistic the other uniting with the Catholics fellowship and right now Church they represent over 500 million is that on this page yes they represent Oh over half a billion Christians and at the right time the Bible said the Beast will give power to make this image speak and live and then if you speak against this image you die so this is the one world church it's going to be the World Council of Churches because they all want to be a part of this unity to unify with the Eucharist of the Catholic Church and what is the eucharist eucharist is the bread that they say turns in the literal body of christ and the wine that literally turns to the blood of Christ that's a lie that's not the literal blood that's not the literal body it's a symbol of it the literal life of Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey hey I praise God that's what we had got amen hallelujah but see this is the image see they can take the image of the beast as well they worship and bow down and say okay I'm part of this church where all the other churches are joining it for peace and safety I might as well join it for peace and safety listen you hurt you heard it here if you have order yet you heard her you heard it here first do not be a part of the World Council of Churches hey man because it's a compromise it's not the unity that God wants us to have praise God the unity that we have with Christ is the unity of obedience through the word this is a false unity they unify unify around the facts well we believe in having communion but it doesn't matter what what you what it means oh it does matter it does matter it does matter because one little sin one little piece of leaven leavens the whole lump if they get you to compromise on one little thing about communion they'll make you swallow the rest of their false doctrine pretty soon you be worshipping Mary and praying to dead Saints and all these things like that and giving Mary more honor than Christ right I'm pretty soon there'll be sexual sins like all this sexual sin in the Catholic Church pretty soon that will sweep into that church in the family and all that if you just if you compromise oh one little thing but the Bride of Christ will not compromise on anything she's washed by the water of the word amen she's got pure garments on she's washed right she's a real Christian no real believer Amen hallelujah now I want to read a scripture here let's go to 2nd John 1 now Lydia we can switch off again there 2nd John 1 verse 9 2nd John 1:9 11 we'll put up here thank you honey well I'm really putting your work tonight and you're even finding scriptures for me bless your heart honey 2nd John 1:9 so see if someone says oh we just want to be one you know Jesus prayed that we should be one with every church he didn't mean that kind of oneness he didn't mean compromise in oneness that's a false oneness those are called doctrines of devils and seducing spirits oh we're all children of God well yeah we're all created by God but we're not all children of God until we're born again of the Holy Ghost now look look at John says about unity so Christian unity oh that's all let's all have a supper together oh just come over to my house we're all Christians are we whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ so doctrine is instruction or teaching something does it live or abide in the instruction of Christ they do not have God they're not born again but he that abides in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and son ha ha ha see how doctrine is so closely associated with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you've got the back if you've got the person of Christ you'll have the person's doctored amen oh yeah you can't have one without the other this scripture proves it if you are born again and you got the Holy Ghost as the seal of God the baptism only goes your doctrine will be right hey Laurie in other words if you've got the person of Christ you'll have that person's doctrine you'll believe exactly like Jesus Bible tells you to believe oh he had both the father the invisible spirit and the son the quick earner of the word well thank the Lord and the next verse now let's let's see one of your friends once you have a dinner all let's just talk about it you know you believe the communions just the symbol let's just talk about let's just have dinner about it look at the Bible says if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him Godspeed don't bless him so if you know somebody's purposely perpetrating false doctrine you don't even say God bless you Oh God blesses your efforts you don't even say that that's something we all need help on I need help on that because I just I want to so I want to see so many people saved you know the Bible said bless those who persecute you do good to those who despise you pray for them who despitefully use you so I've got to be more careful on this I do I have to make sure that I only bless those who I know are doing it with the pure heart but if the Bible says if you know they're purposely transgressing the doctrine of Christ don't let them come in your house and don't even give him Godspeed next verse verse for he that biddeth him God speed is a partaker of his evil deeds that serious is it not church remember all those who take any of these forms of the mark where they all going to go to the lake of fire very serious thing see so this is the unity the unity is the true doctrine of Christ that's what we all must have now let's go back to revelation 19:20 where we started and now if we read that again we'll have a lot better understanding won't we was this helpful tonight Church was that good to go over all that see it was for me but man when I was studying because I didn't realize the mark can come in so many different forms everybody just thinks oh it's either the right hand or the forward but it actually you can take the name of the Beast right or just the Beast right itself I mean there's there's different ways you can take it because Satan is so sly he's so deceptive Satan knows that God's people are gonna read the Bible and they're gonna say don't take in the right hand and the he knows that so he's got to have more ways to deceive so back to our opening scripture and I'll go if you let me go a few more minutes here let me said time here and the Beast was taken it with him the false prophet so the Beast is that spirit of Rome brother Bram tells us the false prophet is the Pope and that wrought the miracles before him with which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast okay we know what the mark is now right hand for it and then that worshipped His image the images that world counsel churches it's a visible form of false unity that's the image and it speaks in other words the image is the false church system it's all the Protestants right it's all this basically the dissipation of the power Protestant churches when the Protestants unite that's the image unto the Beast these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone that's very serious Maya now let me find a place to close here by God's grace and with the can I end with the Antichrist let me end with the Antichrist here if that's okay let's go I guess the main scripture right now second Thessalonians 2 verse 3 so liddy can you pull it up here this is the main one now as I'm writing this book my next book though you'll also find the Antichrist in Daniel 8 Daniel 9 and Daniel 11 so as I've studied by the William it seems like those are the portions that have the most information on the person of the Antichrist yeah it looks like revelation I'm sorry 2nd 2nd Thessalonians and then a little bit of Revelation and then a lot in Daniel so 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3 to 13 now let me give you an example the Bible calls the Pope were the false prophet right remember that we read that the false prophet what does the Pope prophesy or what did the prophet what did the Pope speak in the name of the Lord well here is something from 1915 brother Brandon mentioned this in 1950 Pope Pius the 12th announced that Mary the mother of Jesus was taken or assumed into heaven bodies and soul following the end of her life on earth there's absolutely no historical or New Testament proof of this and this is called the Assumption of Mary how many ever heard of that anyone ever heard that look it up it was it's a new dogma well fairly new now it's what almost 70 years old but for history that's pretty fair that's fairly recent for history concerning the Catholic churches all over almost 2,000 old so in 1950 Pope Pius the 12th said I'm gonna I'm gonna prophesy I'm gonna make a word in the name of the Lord right he made a new Dogma we believe Mary was taken up after death and her body and soul were completely preserved and she was taken straight to heaven now there's not even one fact of that in the Bible but see she's making a false assumption she's making a false declaration in the name of the Lord in other words she's lying she's a false prophet or kinda the Pope was a false prophet see that's called the Assumption of Mary you can look it up it's well-known 1950 see falsely saying things in the name of the Lord and it's a lie so the false prophet in the book of Revelation is another name for the person of the Antichrist that we just generally called the Antichrist now let's go to 2nd Thessalonians 2:3 2:13 he's got a lot of detail on this one and we'll close with this I set my timer will close to this here and then maybe Lord willing next Wednesday we'll pick up actually I'm sorry next Wednesday we got brother Diggs coming back he's free he's going through up here at Noir in northern Ohio preaching so why brother Diggs next Wednesday night if we have to tell you that so praise the Lord so we'll enjoy that hallelujah love those evangelist amen so maybe in to Wednesdays we'll pick up Daniel now remember Daniel 8 9 and 11 but for now let's close the second Thessalonians 2 verse 3 now let me turn there so I can read it myself thank you for your patience okay two three let no man deceive you by any means now listen Church don't even let me deceive you I'm not I don't believe I'm a deceiver but let's say I was don't let don't be to see by me don't take everything I say make sure it goes back to the Word of God now a lot of things you know and if you not already know it's in the Bible and of course believe your pastor I've been here for 13 years you should trust me but what I'm saying is if I say something you don't know you better go look it up in the Word of God if I don't live the life of Christ let's say God will using me as a - of something then don't follow me after that but if I live a godly life the Bible says follow them who have ruled over you and follow their faith if I live a godly life of faith and follow my faith that's what the Bible says but if I say something that you've never heard before not sure about it don't take my word for it don't let any man deceive you go search the scripture for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition I remember Judas was called the son of perdition so before before the endtime there's going to another Judas rise up right another son of perdition and Judas was full of Satan so this man of sin is going to be full of Satan just like Judas was yet he's going to be a false prophet with lying wonders and miracles now a falling away and I remember we lived to this a few weeks ago remember someone can genuinely come to God but that fall away from that experience just like Judas and just like Hebrews 10 said the Bible said he and Eber said that someone can be sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ but then cast it down and tried it down and smash it out under their foot someone can genuinely wash my by the the Spirit of God but then leave that washing and go back into a dirty filthy life that's quite a that's quite a teaching that's true the only way someone can fall away from the truth is that they're in the truth right that's the only way they can fall away so this Antichrist is called the son of perdition and the man of sin look at verse 4 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that's worship so that he as God sits in the temple of God showing himself that He is God so the temple of God is the Jerusalem Temple right there's no Christian Church that says we're the temple of God the only Church in the Bible the only place in the Bible that calls itself the temple of God is the Jewish temple so the Pope is going to sit in the temple they're going to build a temple right in Isreal gonna rebuild that corner of revelation 11 they're gonna rebuild it he's gonna sit in the temple of God showing himself that He is God because he's gonna make a covenant with the Jews and then he's going to exalt himself above all that is called God he's gonna held himself above the buck ball he's going to be worshipped as God because he has these lying signs and wonders he didn't deceive everyone on the earth but not us because we're already gone amen ha ha if the Lord tarries right if we've if the Lord comes our lifetime will be raptured up and we'll escape the Tribulation Period by God's grace the Bible says that verse 5 remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might revealed in his time so god's withholding this because there's a certain time the Antichrist is going to be revealed verse 7 for the Ministry of iniquity does only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so God is letting everything go on until the Holy Spirit is is is taken away from the earth right that's what that means so the Antichrist will not be revealed until he the Holy Spirit is taken away from the earth at the rapture so see teachers what is Satan Satan is the mystery of iniquity it's so innocent right the Catholic Church look it's so aren't they're building so beautiful they're the most I just saw on a friend of mine posted on Facebook yesterday they went to Catholic Church and Barberton or something Cleveland it was so beautiful and Church it is beautiful but it's a cage of unclean and hateful bird zey men because of all their false doctrine all their sexual sin and all their sex abuse it's a cage of unclean and hateful bird it's true it's a mister of iniquity it starts off small but they know they know by the Bible that what they're doing is wrong they know it's wrong it's iniquity they shouldn't be doing the things they're doing verse 8 and then so once he's taking all the way once the Holy Ghost is the other way and then should that wicked be revealed so now the Antichrist is called that wicked whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming amen glory verse 9 even him whose coming is after the working of Satan says he Satan fills the Antichrist himself it's Satan working a man the man of sin the son of perdition just like Judas with all powers and sides and look lying wonders they're gonna be light their merit they're gonna say see me all over CNN it's gonna be all over Fox News but it's gonna be lying miracles they're a lie they're not real they're lies in order to deceive verse 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness see they're going to deceive them into living a sinful life what is righteousness righteous is doing what's right what is unrighteous is doing what's wrong but they're deceived into doing wrong in other words they love the sin and the churches are going to give them a license to sin it's okay to smoke cigarettes it's okay to do drugs it's okay to be addicted to pornography that's okay God understands you're a sinner well no God gives you something to clean yourself from those type of things amen God gives you what's called salvation deliverance amen but see they deceive people with their unrighteousness it's okay to live a sinful life it's okay to enjoy those sins it's all right that's right that's right amen brother Yeah right yeah that's right that's good they confess it in their confessional box rather than to Christ hey glory and when you confess it to
