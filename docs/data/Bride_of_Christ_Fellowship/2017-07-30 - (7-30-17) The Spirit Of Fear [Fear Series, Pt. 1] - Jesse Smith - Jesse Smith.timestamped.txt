[22:48] bringing so much joy to the home Lord
[22:51] God let the joy of the Holy Spirit or
[23:01] you
[23:11] yeah maybe a song too
[23:20] [Music]
[23:24] so as as you all know John I have a
[23:29] mismatch in our platelets it's kind of
[23:31] like the the the red blood cell disorder
[23:36] where they have to give the rhogam shot
[23:37] so with our platelets mismatching
[23:41] whenever our children are conceived if
[23:43] they are have John's blood my body
[23:45] rejects it and thinks it's like a
[23:47] foreign cancer and tries to kill off the
[23:49] platelets so thankfully before two
[23:54] months before Hannah I had needed to
[23:57] receive treatment with Hannah
[23:58] so she was 18 18 weeks in the womb they
[24:04] came out with our treatment protocol
[24:06] from New York and they said that what I
[24:09] needed to do was go through transfusions
[24:10] starting at 20 weeks clear until 37
[24:14] weeks and then I would deliver by
[24:16] c-section so Hannah okay and I didn't
[24:19] know what to expect about God was
[24:21] gracious and helped us to get through
[24:22] that whenever we then were pregnant with
[24:26] Ava I knew what to expect and honestly I
[24:29] had severe anxiety knowing what was
[24:32] coming and what hard things I was going
[24:39] to have to endure so being pregnant for
[24:43] me is not really a joy um I can kind of
[24:45] say that kind of humbly I wish it was
[24:48] but it's really really hard and the life
[24:52] is a joy but going through it is not I
[24:56] wish it was so when I see many moms so
[24:59] happy it's hard for me because I don't
[25:02] feel I think joy a lot because the
[25:04] suffering that you have to go through
[25:05] and just to put it in perspective just
[25:07] imagine if all week long you felt awful
[25:10] like as terrible headache and aching all
[25:12] throughout your body
[25:13] and then you feel good for one day and
[25:15] then you go back to that that's how the
[25:17] pregnancy is many times I couldn't get
[25:21] out of bed right directly because
[25:24] the varicose veins that I have I'd have
[25:27] to get a bed and actually just fall to
[25:28] the ground and crawl because the pain in
[25:30] my legs would be so bit unbearable
[25:33] but God was gracious with the I didn't
[25:35] have so much of that and I was I had
[25:38] more wisdom to and was able to do some
[25:41] supplements and hose and that would
[25:44] compress my legs and help me quite a bit
[25:46] so he's very thing for that but when I
[25:48] was having the hardest time with Ava
[25:51] and I was just crying on the way to
[25:54] treatment and I'm like Laura I don't
[25:55] want go through this again
[25:56] and I had like I don't know like seven
[25:58] or eight weeks left and just crying in
[26:00] the car because I'd have to leave my
[26:02] family like at 3 p.m. in the afternoon I
[26:04] wouldn't see them till the next day
[26:06] because I had good treatments overnight
[26:07] was like 15 hours of treatment the Lord
[26:12] brought a song to me over the radio and
[26:15] it was by a carry job and it says I am
[26:18] NOT alone and that just became my song
[26:20] for Ava that I don't I was starting to
[26:23] feel very very overwhelmed I just
[26:25] started seeing that song I am NOT alone
[26:27] you will go before me and you will never
[26:29] leave me and I would just sing that song
[26:31] because that kind of became my song with
[26:33] with Eve I would just sing that whenever
[26:36] I feel very overwhelmed very overcome
[26:39] with grief at the pain I'm just gonna
[26:42] have to go through of course they
[26:44] wouldn't even she was just such a joy
[26:45] and pleasantly just Pleasant so I knew
[26:49] what with Leah the same thing would
[26:50] happen and so though my prayer for this
[26:56] pregnant for her and for that pregnancy
[26:57] was that I wouldn't have to go to the
[26:58] transfusions again he saw it fit that I
[27:01] would I would go through that again and
[27:04] he also gave me another song with her I
[27:08] just kind of praise the Lord other song
[27:09] I need something else to encourage me in
[27:11] this battle because it's really hard
[27:13] when there's no other believers that you
[27:15] know that I've gone through this you
[27:16] can't relate and talk to many people
[27:18] because there's no believers that I know
[27:20] who has had to go through this like
[27:21] we've had and I said Lord I know I'm not
[27:24] alone no you're with me I know that
[27:25] you're gonna bring me through this like
[27:27] you brought me through it with everyone
[27:28] I wish you would take this pain away I
[27:31] wish I would have to go through it and
[27:32] the Lord gave me this song and I just I
[27:35] feel I feel like I need to sing it
[27:38] it's by Natalie grant it says it's more
[27:40] than anything so you can look it up and
[27:43] listen to it read it yourself I know if
[27:51] you want to you could wave your hand
[27:55] spare me this heartache and change your
[27:59] plan I know when you said that you
[28:05] could take my pain away but even if you
[28:11] don't pray tell me what the healer more
[28:17] than healing help me want to save you're
[28:23] more than saving tell me what the giver
[28:29] more than giving Oh help me want you

[28:50] remedy I'll ask a thousand more times to
[28:56] set me free to day hey but even if you
[29:02] don't I pray he help me want the healer

[32:44] man prays now let's take our Bibles this
[32:47] morning and ascend our feet I just want
[32:50] to read one scripture sort of 2nd
[32:52] Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 I like to take
[32:56] a different thought this morning we've
[32:59] been dealing with the church ages would
[33:00] like to take a different dot and look at
[33:01] the spirit of fear this morning the
[33:03] spirit of fear 2nd Timothy 1 verse 7
[33:06] kind of had this thought on my heart for
[33:09] a while I'm just kind of waiting on the
[33:11] Lord and I just feel like I should
[33:12] preach it this morning praise the Lord
[33:15] 2nd Timothy 1:7 2nd Timothy 1:7 let's
[33:33] read this if we can together 1 2 3 for
[33:37] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[33:40] but of power and of love and of a sound
[33:43] mind you ever need on your heart let's
[33:45] make it known to Lord let's bow our
[33:46] heads as we pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[33:49] love you Jesus we give ourselves away
[33:51] Lord God take our lives our plans our
[33:54] dreams our ambitions Lord let us be a
[33:56] living sacrifice Lord God unto thee
[33:59] thank you for the songs Lord from the
[34:01] saints the testimonies we appreciate
[34:03] that

[34:06] wonderful you are how real you are to us
[34:08] Lord God and we thank you for your
[34:10] constant presence in our lives Lord you

[34:15] age and you've kept your promise Lord

[34:20] Lord God how we can sing your praises
[34:22] Lord God with a pure heart with the
[34:24] thankful heart Lord bless this reading
[34:27] of thy word Lord as we look at the
[34:29] spirit of fear and dear God I just pray
[34:31] you give us grace to get out of your way
[34:33] completely that you might be completely
[34:35] glorified and Lord you're accomplished
[34:38] or your purpose this morning would be
[34:39] completely accomplished Lord God as we
[34:42] want to yield to thy spirit Lord we
[34:44] thank you for your love and mercy and
[34:45] your grace and thy sweet presence we
[34:48] give you glory in Jesus Christ's name
[34:50] the church said Amen god bless use me
[34:52] and see you there praise the Lord I want
[35:01] to thank the Lord again for our visitors
[35:02] we have sister Helen with us and brother
[35:05] Johnny and sister Sarah and their family
[35:07] [Applause]
[35:09] it's great to have fellowship with the
[35:11] Saints and look forward to our
[35:12] fellowship afterwards by the grace of
[35:16] the Lord I've had this thought of the
[35:20] spirit of fear on my heart for a few
[35:21] weeks now and just kind of waiting on
[35:24] the Lord for the right timing and
[35:26] yesterday's I studied I just kind of
[35:27] felt like I got into a little channel
[35:29] this is a huge subject as you know fear
[35:33] has over 700 scriptures in the Bible on
[35:35] fear and afraid so I didn't touch the
[35:39] surface of those what I did is I spent
[35:41] most of my time going through quotes
[35:42] about fear and faith and perfect love
[35:45] casting out all fear and scriptures
[35:47] about fear I'm sorry in quotes about
[35:50] fear and the greatness of the challenge
[35:52] of fear so I want to look at those this
[35:56] morning and just ask God to guide me and
[35:59] as you know your faith will determine
[36:02] the direction of the service amen how
[36:04] many know that by God's grace no one
[36:06] ever leaves here disappointed when they
[36:08] pull on the Lord you know so we don't
[36:10] pull on a man we pulled on the Lord the
[36:12] Holy Spirit as the Holy Spirit works
[36:14] through the man amen so we like to look
[36:17] at this thought here that God gives not
[36:19] the spirit of fear the word fear and
[36:25] Webster's means frighten it means to
[36:31] expect with alarm fear to expect alarm
[36:37] to be timid so that's what fear means
[36:41] it's a frightening it's afraid to expect
[36:46] an alarm to expect something bad to
[36:49] happen that's fear in the in the
[36:53] Webster's now the definition we
[36:55] appreciate is to have a reverential awe
[36:58] of God that's the definition that we
[37:01] live by
[37:02] because the whole duty of man is to what
[37:04] fear God and keep his commands that's
[37:07] the whole duty of man but the RAM says
[37:08] that and the book of Ecclesiastes says
[37:10] that Solomon says that in chapter 12
[37:12] that's the whole duty of man is to fear
[37:14] God and keep his Commandments we must
[37:17] have a reverence toward the Lord Jesus
[37:20] Christ amen and God and so we know
[37:23] there's many kinds of fear if you do a
[37:24] google search and look up phobias one
[37:28] article said there's 322 phobias that
[37:31] are medically listed one of them is a
[37:34] fear of preaching which I thought was
[37:36] kind of funny
[37:37] number the fifth top fear is
[37:39] claustrophobia you know being in a tight
[37:42] space the number one fear did you know
[37:46] anybody know it is arachnophobia the
[37:49] fear of spiders they know that that is
[37:52] the number one fear at least medically
[37:54] proven clinically you know arachnophobia
[37:59] interesting but there's many kinds of
[38:02] fears and we all can relate to fear
[38:04] whether it's the good fear of God or the
[38:08] bad fear battling fear and so we want to
[38:12] take a few scriptures and look at this
[38:15] thought I'm just going to hit the top of
[38:16] it and I felt led to go down one vein I
[38:18] kind of found a quote some series of
[38:20] quotes I kind of liked I think I'll just
[38:21] go down that vein by the grace of the
[38:24] Lord with godly fear we know it's
[38:28] comanded right and we know it has great
[38:31] advantages advantages because the fear
[38:33] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[38:35] a person can't even have any wisdom in
[38:41] God until they first have a reverential
[38:44] awe of God in his power and that's why
[38:46] God created nature that's what the Bible
[38:48] says God created nature for signs and
[38:51] seasons and that people would stand in
[38:54] awe of his creation and his majesty
[38:56] and they'd have to realize there's
[38:58] something greater than me there's
[39:00] something greater than humanity and
[39:03] reverential fear is a great advantage
[39:05] and I would go as far as saying that our
[39:09] fear many times should make us tremble
[39:11] before God because the Bible says we
[39:13] should
[39:14] work out our own salvation with fear and
[39:17] trembling I believe there is a spiritual
[39:21] holy fear that when it comes to the
[39:24] believer
[39:25] it's a reverent fear of God's holiness
[39:28] and it causes us to fear God and also
[39:34] tremble at his presence we've all heard
[39:38] I've seen people tremble at
[39:39] rock-and-roll stars or actors and
[39:41] actresses and people shake when they get
[39:43] to meet their most famous athlete or
[39:45] something like that that's the wrong
[39:46] kind of fear Amen s it's they ought to
[39:49] have that kind of Revere and respect for
[39:51] God Almighty that's a perverted fear but
[39:55] we ought to have that fear because the
[39:57] Bible said even demons believe and
[39:59] tremble at God's Word so sinners and
[40:03] unbelievers and make believers that have
[40:07] this perverted fear that that fear
[40:09] things a man more than God have a
[40:12] perverted fear and they need to
[40:14] understand the fear of the Lord aren't
[40:17] you glad you have the fear of the Lord
[40:18] aren't you glad when you came to Christ
[40:20] you respected him you had great
[40:23] reverence toward him you you knew that
[40:26] he has power as Jesus said don't fear a
[40:29] man that has can take away your body but
[40:32] jesus said fear God who has power over
[40:34] the body and soul and can destroy the
[40:37] body and soul in hell I mean you know
[40:38] that scripture in Matthew chapter 10
[40:40] thank God that we had that fear that we
[40:43] know God is my Creator and and God is
[40:46] ultimately in control my life all of my
[40:48] steps are ordered of the Lord and God
[40:51] brought me in my life to this situation
[40:54] for a purpose God is not the author of
[40:56] confusion God didn't bring a event in
[40:58] your life to confuse you he brought an
[41:01] event in your life to perfect.you amen
[41:03] glory to get you to need him as I was
[41:06] thinking on the drive over here I was
[41:08] thinking of how the Bible said Jesus had
[41:09] a need to go by Samaria he had a need to
[41:12] go by and bring freedom to the woman at
[41:15] the well but she needed to go through
[41:17] five husbands and living with one she
[41:19] needed to go through this immoral life
[41:21] in order to see her need for a savior
[41:24] amen there's something about her life
[41:26] that she had to go through that we
[41:28] No maybe all the reasons God will
[41:30] explain it and we're sure that God will
[41:32] explain it one day in heaven amen
[41:34] for program said that's what the hidden
[41:36] manna is brother Branham said that the
[41:38] hidden manna he said is Jesus answering
[41:40] all of our unanswered questions for ages
[41:43] an attorney to come he said that's the
[41:45] hidden manna he reveals it to us in a
[41:48] private personal way just like the manna
[41:50] was hidden in the Ark of the Covenant
[41:52] praise God under the mercy seat so one
[41:55] day he'll show us all the reasons but we
[41:58] trust God and we know that God is in
[42:00] control and we fear God he's so great
[42:03] and we reverence his power in his glory
[42:06] amen
[42:06] and we want to look at just real quickly
[42:09] first John 4:18 we read 2nd Timothy 1:7
[42:15] how God does not give the spirit of fear
[42:18] God doesn't send the spirit of fear to
[42:21] anyone God doesn't want anyone to live
[42:23] in fear and as our sister said anxiety
[42:25] that's another good word no we wouldn't
[42:26] hear more common today you don't say
[42:28] well I have a fear attack I have a
[42:30] anxiety attack and and if people battle
[42:33] anxiety that's no different than
[42:34] somebody struggling with cigarettes or
[42:36] any other thing it's a it's a battle
[42:38] they must overcome we that's what we are
[42:43] ultimately at the end what are we Church
[42:45] we are overcomers
[42:47] we're conquerors that's all Christ asked
[42:49] us to be is overcome and conquer
[42:52] whatever trials he and his wisdom allows
[42:55] to come into our lives that's all we
[42:57] have to do is overcome what he's placed
[42:59] in my life he never allowed homelessness
[43:01] or to come into my life or he never
[43:03] allowed different things to come into my
[43:05] life but what he has allowed to come
[43:07] into my life he's asked me to take his
[43:09] grace and his power and overcome that
[43:12] amen and so that's how it is for your
[43:14] life God has orchestrated those events
[43:17] in your life and allowed you the grace
[43:20] to be an overcomer and the Bible said in
[43:22] Revelation 21 that if you overcome you
[43:25] inherit all things praise God you
[43:27] inherit all the rewards for all the
[43:29] church ages how great how merciful is
[43:31] God to give us a Sevenfold reward just
[43:34] by overcoming the age that we live in
[43:36] amen
[43:37] how merciful is God and we say complete
[43:40] reward amen
[43:41] now first John 4:18 there's no fear in
[43:45] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[43:51] because fear hath torment he that
[43:57] feareth is not made perfect in love and
[44:01] I just want to I'm not gonna spend a
[44:02] whole lot of time on this one I just
[44:03] want to drop this thought we can usually
[44:05] tell the difference between reverential
[44:08] fear and unholy fear because unfold
[44:13] unholy fear has torment I mean oh it's
[44:15] like to be tormented to just go through
[44:19] constant torment constant pain or
[44:22] constant trials are constant accusation
[44:26] or or constant guilt is they might know
[44:27] what we're talking about this morning a
[44:29] torment something that you just can't
[44:33] seem to to overcome and and get the
[44:36] victory but the Bible said the spirit of
[44:39] fear always brings torment and God does
[44:45] not give the spirit of fear God may
[44:48] allow torment but that's not directly
[44:50] from God amen he Allah he may allow it
[44:53] to come and God as little creators as we
[44:57] are little craters God lets us choose
[44:59] many times the atmosphere that we live
[45:01] in because he wants us to be the right
[45:03] kind of creator he wants us to be
[45:05] children of his fatherhood and he wants
[45:09] to see us take his word live his word
[45:11] and live above all the temptations of
[45:14] the world remember 2nd Peter chapter 2
[45:17] says that lot was vexed daily by what he
[45:20] saw and what he heard the word vex means
[45:23] torment let me know that lot chose lot
[45:27] could have lived out you know in the
[45:29] wilderness but he chose to live in a
[45:31] more rich area for the sake of physical
[45:34] blessings but yet the place he chose to
[45:37] live in it daily tormented him because
[45:40] of the things that he saw and things
[45:42] that he heard I'm convinced in this hour
[45:44] later sia
[45:44] most people's torment comes from there
[45:47] compromising on God's Word and allowing
[45:50] themselves to see the wrong thing and to
[45:52] hear the wrong thing I'm convinced
[45:56] we saw a Wednesday night the just shall
[45:59] live by faith
[45:59] but there'll be very few who are even
[46:02] saved because jesus said few there be
[46:04] that find it
[46:04] church we're some of the most blessed
[46:06] people in the world amen to know what we
[46:08] know as we said on Wednesday how can I
[46:10] know what I know and not be happy all
[46:13] right how can we know the Word of God
[46:14] and the revelations of the Bible
[46:17] revealed to us today through God's
[46:19] prophet how can we not be happy knowing
[46:22] what we know praise God but I'm
[46:24] convinced in this hour as you talk with
[46:27] others and your fellowship and you see
[46:29] different people from different churches
[46:30] and you meet people and different things
[46:32] you see many times the very tormenting
[46:35] or the very trouble they're going
[46:37] through is self-inflicted
[46:39] now maybe like the what's different is
[46:41] the man who was born blind
[46:43] remember Jesus sciples asked him is this
[46:45] because he his sin as parents and Jesus
[46:46] said neither this is not upon them but
[46:49] I've allowed this God has allowed this
[46:51] for God's glory but charts in most cases
[46:54] you know we know it's people you know
[46:57] when they get torment and they get in a
[46:58] real rut we'd say or they get in a real
[47:01] bad situation many times is because of
[47:04] their own mistakes because the Bible
[47:05] said lot the lust of the man carries his
[47:09] own lust carries them away in James
[47:10] chapter one right when a man is in sins
[47:14] he's drawn away by his own lust
[47:16] so it's something inside the man or a
[47:19] woman that's lusting and and lust means
[47:21] of forbidden craving so they have a
[47:23] forbidden craving that they should have
[47:25] they should have crucified that desire
[47:28] or that craving they should have starved
[47:31] that desire but instead they keep
[47:32] feeding that desire I mean know what
[47:34] we're talking about and so lot was like
[47:37] that lot could have lived you know we
[47:40] know he couldn't live by Abraham because
[47:42] they couldn't have enough room for their
[47:43] their cattle but he could have lived
[47:46] outside of Sodom but he chose he chose
[47:50] to live in Sodom and because of that
[47:51] everything he saw and heard every day
[47:54] tormented him daily and I think
[47:57] sometimes technology goes a long way of
[47:59] hurting us if we can't handle it people
[48:02] daily tormented by the things they see
[48:04] in here but they're the one allowing it
[48:07] we must not forget we're kings
[48:09] on this earth we are supposed to reign
[48:12] over sin we should tell sin where to go
[48:16] we should tell sin that if not now it's
[48:19] not gonna happen it's not ever gonna
[48:21] happen
[48:21] amen lorry we should have bonus how many
[48:25] what bonus but fear has torment and
[48:30] compromise and sin is from their own
[48:34] lusts and it brings upon the person
[48:37] constant torment by their own mistakes
[48:41] by their own submission to sin rather
[48:45] than submitting to Christ and being a
[48:47] living sacrifice amen
[48:49] presenting their body as a living
[48:50] sacrifice how many living sacrifice
[48:52] how many woke up this morning and maybe
[48:54] your flesh want to do something but you
[48:56] brought it under subjection amen or you
[48:58] wanted to give somebody a piece of your
[49:00] mind or something are you wanting to say
[49:02] something or do something but you had to
[49:04] crucify that it's a constant battle but
[49:07] we're glad to do it because we're just
[49:08] taking up a cross like our Savior took
[49:10] up amen we're happy to do it because no
[49:13] man can even follow Christ unless they
[49:15] take up their cross daily and follow him
[49:18] Christian's don't take any days off amen
[49:20] glory from taking up their cross they
[49:22] constantly crucify the lusts of the
[49:25] flesh
[49:25] and the affections thereof they will not
[49:28] live lives in torment God will give them
[49:30] a way out if they desire way out the
[49:32] Bible said God has to make a way out
[49:33] amen in fact the Bible says there's no
[49:37] situation where God will not give you a
[49:39] victory or a way out from your
[49:41] temptation amen or a way out from your
[49:44] fear or a way out from your torment in
[49:46] every case God has an open door amen
[49:49] hallelujah God has a door cracked open
[49:51] err God has a window cracked err God has
[49:53] some form of escape hallelujah he's got
[49:56] some route to escape he's got a safety
[49:58] plan for every temptation at school
[50:01] yours got have safety plans and we plan
[50:03] for fires and tornadoes and floods and
[50:05] now active shooters and every time we
[50:07] got to have a plan and and now our new
[50:10] strategy we've gone through so many
[50:12] strategy since I've been teaching 13
[50:13] years about dealing with our new
[50:15] strategy is called sheep and Shepherds
[50:17] so if an active shooter comes in I like
[50:20] this one this is my favorite one so far
[50:22] I can really relate to this one
[50:23] paster the newest one is sheep and
[50:26] Shepherd so then the last year I had to
[50:27] teach the children I'm like the shepherd
[50:31] and you're like the Sheep and wolves can
[50:33] come in with guns and knives and you
[50:35] have to kind of say these things kind of
[50:37] broad you know they're six years old and
[50:38] then the kindergarten teachers have to
[50:39] give it to the fire row but that's the
[50:40] society we live in
[50:41] it's just like the days of Noah violence
[50:43] filled the earth but that's the new
[50:46] approach we have a safety plan and the
[50:49] plan is the Sheep must follow the voice
[50:51] of the shepherd and I'm happy to say
[50:53] Christ is the great Shepherd amen but
[50:56] you're Danes natural pastures and so
[50:58] forth but that's this fivefold ministry
[51:00] but we tell them in every situation
[51:03] there's not a cut and dry answer for
[51:05] example if an intruder comes by the
[51:07] window well then you don't go to the
[51:08] window you go out the door if it shooter
[51:10] goes to the door then you don't go to
[51:12] the door you go out the window
[51:13] if you're surrounded there's a different
[51:15] you know you got to fight back that's
[51:16] the new one you got to fight back fight
[51:18] the devil you got to fight the devil
[51:19] with all you got amen you got a kickin
[51:22] car and gum him to death you have to do
[51:24] everything you can to overcome the devil
[51:26] but the ideas now you follow the voice
[51:28] of your Shepherd and you do whatever it
[51:30] takes to stay alive amen there's not a
[51:33] cut and dry
[51:33] you have to use wisdom and find the way
[51:35] out isn't that just like God's mercy in
[51:38] this hour the same temptation let's say
[51:41] lust or greed or let's say anger or in
[51:43] this case fear it may come in a
[51:45] different channel one day comes by your
[51:47] phone a fearful video or a fearful
[51:49] report of a news report and maybe the
[51:52] next time they come by your neighbor did
[51:53] you hear this about so and so it comes a
[51:55] different channel but God's grace
[51:57] promise there always be a way of escape
[51:59] amen listen to the voice of the shepherd
[52:02] listen to what he's saying use wisdom of
[52:04] the Holy Spirit there's a way out if
[52:06] you're willing to look for it don't give
[52:08] in be strong amen
[52:10] be very courageous amen for the Lord thy
[52:12] God is with thee whether so ever thou
[52:14] goest a man like Joshua Haven brother
[52:17] have said Josh - it could be fearless
[52:19] because he said as I was with Moses so
[52:22] shall I be with you amen now I would
[52:25] have reached us later by the one time
[52:26] today but brother have said Joshua's job
[52:28] was harder than Moses is even the
[52:31] placing the people in the land so
[52:33] doesn't that help us out a little bit
[52:34] coming out of Egypt coming out of the
[52:36] world is that's
[52:37] wonderful job but actually positionally
[52:40] placing the people in the promised land
[52:42] but RAM said was a harder job so Joshua
[52:45] really had to stay true to the promise
[52:46] of God how many understand what we're
[52:48] talking about you and I need to be
[52:50] placed positionally today in the
[52:51] promised land
[52:52] some people were right we might wonder
[52:54] what's our position or what are we
[52:55] called to do don't worry there's a God
[52:57] that will position you amen
[52:59] there's a God that will place you you're
[53:01] already supposed to be seen in heavenly
[53:03] places but then for another position
[53:05] we'd say what's your will what's God's
[53:07] will for your life and so forth God will
[53:09] show it to you
[53:10] but this is a harder work it's gonna
[53:12] take more consecration but God's grace
[53:15] is there for us the Spirit of God will
[53:16] raise a standard against the enemy that
[53:19] comes in like a flood we just got a call
[53:21] out for mercy we've got to ask God for
[53:23] His wisdom amen hallelujah now I want to
[53:30] look at a few more things here God does
[53:33] not give the spirit of fear so God will
[53:36] not torment he'll allow a sinner to go
[53:38] through torment or he may allow some
[53:40] trials to draw the person back to
[53:42] repentance but God does not give the
[53:44] spirit of fear I want them to be scared
[53:46] I want Kevin to be scared I want I don't
[53:49] Jose to have an anxiety attack
[53:50] that's not God's desire we allow it by
[53:53] the things we see in here we allow it by
[53:56] the things we believe we allow it by sin
[53:58] and compromise but God does not give the
[54:02] spirit of fear what God gives is the
[54:06] spirit of boldness can I say like that
[54:08] that's what God gives now I want to go
[54:11] back to 2nd Timothy 1 though I want to
[54:13] read some of these scriptures because
[54:14] they were just such a blessing to me
[54:15] this morning our text was 2nd Timothy
[54:19] 1:7 but I want to read right before that
[54:25] Timothy was crying to see Paul that's
[54:29] how bad he wanted to see him
[54:30] you everson want to see us ain't that
[54:32] bad that's the real book that's the real
[54:34] Christian love that's what verse 4 says
[54:36] mindful of thy tears now verse 5
[54:41] when I call it to remembrance the
[54:43] unfeigned faith that is in the which 12
[54:45] first and my grandmother Lois and my
[54:46] mother Eunice and I'm also persuaded
[54:48] that in the awesome Paul recognizes that
[54:51] Timothy got his faith handed down to him
[54:55] from his grandmother mother and then he
[54:58] got it he's a third generation believer
[55:01] but they're also children of God they're
[55:03] not grandchildren but they're children
[55:05] of God amen
[55:06] so who does Paul give credit for
[55:08] Timothy's faith his grandmother his
[55:12] mother mother's you see how important
[55:14] your labor is for God I heard a preacher
[55:17] was it a preacher or YouTube video this
[55:19] week I was listening to a sermon I
[55:20] forget which one it was but they were
[55:23] just saying that as mothers and fathers
[55:25] we need to see children we have to have
[55:28] a vision because without a vision of the
[55:30] people perish so as parents and I have
[55:32] six children I understand we can all
[55:35] have discouragement in parenting but I
[55:37] heard this preacher say he said you've
[55:39] got to see your children the vision has
[55:41] to be that when they grow up that's how
[55:44] you see them as you go daily life I'm
[55:46] raising this child in one day she's
[55:49] gonna be this she's gonna be that
[55:50] they're gonna be solid they're gonna be
[55:52] able to be a believer you always got to
[55:53] have the vision before you how many
[55:55] believe in having a vision amen you got
[55:57] to keep that vision or else you'll be
[55:59] discouraged and so Paul's recognizing
[56:02] you have great faith Timothy you're my
[56:04] son in the gospel but that faith was
[56:07] first and your grandmother and mother
[56:09] thank God for a godly grandmother thank
[56:11] God for a godly mother honey thankful
[56:13] for a godly father and grandfather
[56:15] hey man I'm thankful you know my grandpa
[56:18] gars used to sit us down and he would
[56:20] preach to us about what God did in his
[56:22] life his wife died in a hospital in
[56:25] Wauseon Oh Ohio the same one Hospital my
[56:27] mom was healed of cancer and the wife
[56:30] died they took her down to the bottom
[56:31] level he told me this he sat me down he
[56:33] tells us numerous times he said he
[56:35] called their pastor and told them the
[56:38] doctors don't embalmer they brought the
[56:40] pastor and they prayed for her cold body
[56:42] and within five minutes she started
[56:44] getting warm
[56:44] they kept praying and then she come back
[56:46] to life and lived about 20 more years
[56:49] after that by the grace of the Lord and
[56:51] he would sit down and make sure he told
[56:53] us this and
[56:55] this these type of things are to be
[56:59] passed down member God told Joshua and
[57:01] judges in the days of judges remember
[57:04] the days the judges they didn't pass
[57:05] down the testimonies of faith that were
[57:08] in their lives I remember that they
[57:10] weren't a generation they forgot to tell
[57:12] the testimonies of the previous
[57:14] generation you and I must continue to
[57:16] keep the testimonies of God on our lips
[57:19] we must pass them on to the next
[57:21] generation we must have a vision that
[57:23] the Lord tarries the next generation
[57:25] will know about Christ in my life amen
[57:27] they must know that and we must have a
[57:30] vision of the next faith the next
[57:32] generation that's coming up who would
[57:34] have thought we saw brother branham's
[57:36] sons on Wednesday we just waved at him
[57:38] Billy Paul and Joseph we just waved at
[57:40] him on Wednesday I was too scared to
[57:42] want to stop them I'm just seven there's
[57:44] fear again there's there fear I'm
[57:46] preaching on fear today because I was
[57:48] ashamed not like scared like what are
[57:50] they gonna say to me but I'm just a
[57:51] shame like Here I am
[57:52] I'm nobody and here's brother BAM sense
[57:54] but I heard them say I heard them or
[57:57] another brother talking about it and we
[57:59] met brother Mark who knows well Joseph
[58:02] and he's talking about Joseph's sons and
[58:04] grandchildren the prophets son already
[58:07] has grandchildren look at these how
[58:10] generations are just passing church we
[58:12] might be here a while we better make
[58:14] sure we keep the testimonies of Christ
[58:16] upon our lips we must make sure we pass
[58:18] it down to the next generation look at
[58:20] Timothy's faith it came from his
[58:22] grandmother his mother it went into him
[58:24] you got to believe that your faith will
[58:26] go into your son your daughter and your
[58:28] grandchildren if God tears that's the
[58:30] kind of faith I have amen that's the
[58:32] kind of faith that we need to have by
[58:33] the grace of the Lord
[58:35] Paul's recognizing this in Timothy this
[58:38] was first in your grandmother member in
[58:40] the second Timothy in chapter 2 he tells
[58:44] them that your grandmother and mother is
[58:45] the one that taught you the Holy
[58:46] Scriptures and taught you to a salvation
[58:49] see how important your Bible studies are
[58:51] at home mother's you see how important
[58:52] that is your morning Bible study you're
[58:54] eating in Bible study mothers that's so
[58:57] important because Timothy was taught the
[58:58] Holy Scriptures by his mother and
[59:00] grandmother
[59:01] can we read that real quick just a
[59:03] minute here I think it's chapter 2 at
[59:05] the end of the chapter no chapter 3
[59:09] verse 15 yeah that's right in verse 13
[59:14] he said they're gonna have more and more
[59:16] deceivers but Paul thanks God that
[59:19] Timothy was taught the scriptures from a
[59:20] child bring them to Sunday School bring
[59:22] them when do you screw up now Wednesday
[59:24] night bring them to youth group bring
[59:26] them to the house of God let them sit
[59:27] here and hear the Word of God
[59:29] let the next generation hear the
[59:30] promises of God I've had people tell me
[59:33] well I'm too scared to have more
[59:35] children because they're gonna grow up
[59:36] and Laodicea
[59:37] that's fear talking that's not faith
[59:39] talking that's fear if you take that
[59:42] mindset well then people might want to
[59:44] leave the earth altogether and their
[59:46] lives are something like if you're
[59:48] scared for them overcoming are you even
[59:50] overcoming but I'm overcoming amen
[59:54] I'm more than a conqueror there's no
[59:56] fear in faith and the just shall live by
[59:58] faith amen glory look at verse 15 and
[1:00:04] that from a child how did Timothy know
[1:00:06] the scriptures from a child the faith of
[1:00:09] his grandmother and the faith of his
[1:00:11] mother now it's known the Holy
[1:00:14] Scriptures which are able to make thee
[1:00:16] wise unto salvation through faith which
[1:00:18] is in Christ Jesus
[1:00:20] how many appreciate that by God's grace
[1:00:22] let's go back to chapter 1 I just want
[1:00:24] to make sure I lay that in there that
[1:00:24] was kind of stirring on my heart this
[1:00:26] morning it's not my notes I just kind of
[1:00:28] read that I thought I like this preached
[1:00:29] on that a little bit by God's grace so
[1:00:32] you can see the power of faith the power
[1:00:35] of daily prayers the power of a vision
[1:00:37] for your family and the vision for your
[1:00:39] children and grandchildren you have to
[1:00:41] have a godly vision verse 6 wherefore I
[1:00:46] put the in remembrance that I'll stir up
[1:00:48] the gift of God which is in thee by the
[1:00:50] putting on of my hands so Paul saw
[1:00:52] gifting Timothy's life and he laid hands
[1:00:54] and he's we prayed for that gift in his
[1:00:56] life and he's saying stir up that gift
[1:00:59] I'm gonna stir that gift that's up
[1:01:00] inside of thee for God has not given us
[1:01:03] the spirit of fear but of power and of
[1:01:06] love and of sound mind so apparently
[1:01:08] Paul's riding this letter saying Timothy
[1:01:09] don't be fearful stir your gift up in
[1:01:12] other words make your gift operate how
[1:01:14] many want to see their faith operate
[1:01:15] more but Rand says like a muscle if you
[1:01:18] don't exercise you're gonna get weak in
[1:01:20] faith he said the problem is in America
[1:01:22] and
[1:01:22] I can find the quotes I don't have in
[1:01:23] front of me he said the problem is we
[1:01:25] eat do we get off that and we don't
[1:01:27] exercise our faith he said whenever you
[1:01:29] hear preach you should try to exercise
[1:01:31] your faith and speak that faith out that
[1:01:33] night or the next morning don't just
[1:01:35] come in here and here and get bigger and
[1:01:36] bigger and bigger but start exercise and
[1:01:39] use that strength and speak the word
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:41] hurry hallelujah we got to be
[1:01:44] spiritually strong and exercise and pray
[1:01:47] for this thing if you don't feel I could
[1:01:48] pray anyway if you don't be like a read
[1:01:50] your Bible if you don't think it'll
[1:01:51] happen just pray anyway amen exercise
[1:01:54] your faith if you don't you'll get
[1:01:55] weaker in faith and then what takes over
[1:01:58] fear because fear is the opposite of
[1:02:00] faith they cannot exist at the same time
[1:02:03] perfect love casts out all fear amen the
[1:02:09] disciples had some faith on that boat
[1:02:10] when they're crossing the lake a Jenner
[1:02:13] Sarah I believe it if you say like that
[1:02:14] because Jesus said why do you doubt why
[1:02:16] you're fearful o ye of little faith
[1:02:18] they had enough glory they had enough
[1:02:21] faith to go wake up Christ amen they had
[1:02:24] enough faith to recognize there's
[1:02:26] somebody on this boat I might not have
[1:02:27] the faith but there's somebody on this
[1:02:29] boat that has faith to do it amen
[1:02:31] and if you're at the faith to do it they
[1:02:33] call it brother so-and-so call up sister
[1:02:35] so and so that shows you do have faith
[1:02:37] to call somebody and pray and contact
[1:02:40] God and ask God to come on the scene
[1:02:43] amen they had enough faith out of the
[1:02:45] ouya oh ye of little faith they had
[1:02:48] enough faith to recognize Christ and we
[1:02:51] should have that much faith we can
[1:02:52] recognize Christ in our myths bringing
[1:02:54] the songs bringing the the worship
[1:02:56] bringing the preaching we should
[1:02:57] recognize Christ in our myths amen
[1:03:00] now I'm not done with that I want to
[1:03:02] keep going so Paul says stir up your
[1:03:05] gift and then God didn't give you the
[1:03:08] spirit of fear Timothy now look the
[1:03:09] profits no longer with them the profit
[1:03:11] is going to die this is the profits last
[1:03:13] letter
[1:03:13] second Timothy the Prophet is going to
[1:03:16] die he said I fought a good fight and
[1:03:17] now what is he saying you're the next
[1:03:19] generation Timothy you're the next
[1:03:22] generation stir up the gift of God in
[1:03:24] you have faith be strong have the spirit
[1:03:27] have a sound mind power and love oh I
[1:03:30] want to be full of power I want to be
[1:03:32] full of love I want my mind to be sound
[1:03:34] right on the Word of God this is not
[1:03:35] some unsound doctrine we went our mind
[1:03:38] centered on sound doctrine amen
[1:03:40] right out of the Word of God for heaven
[1:03:41] earth shall pass away but my word will
[1:03:43] never pass away
[1:03:44] amen glory he says beaver say I love
[1:03:49] this this is always reminds me brother
[1:03:50] branham be not thou therefore ashamed of
[1:03:53] the testimony of our Lord nor of me his
[1:03:55] prisoner so Paul said don't be ashamed
[1:03:57] of the prophet of the hour not ashamed a
[1:04:00] brother Brennan he's a true prophet of
[1:04:01] God amen
[1:04:02] nor of our Lord Jesus of course he's our
[1:04:04] Savior our God but be thou partaker of
[1:04:07] the afflictions of the Gospel according
[1:04:08] the power of God so Paul's telling him
[1:04:10] you have to in order to endure the
[1:04:12] afflictions of the righteous you have to
[1:04:14] have the power of God so can we just say
[1:04:16] it can we just say that you're gonna
[1:04:18] have afflictions can you just say that
[1:04:19] pair you're gonna you're going to have
[1:04:20] afflictions you're gonna have
[1:04:22] tribulations but he said be strong and
[1:04:25] let the power of God it be in your life
[1:04:29] so that you can overcome the afflictions
[1:04:31] and tribulations remember Jesus told the
[1:04:34] thyroids here in church age fear not
[1:04:35] none of those things that will come upon
[1:04:37] you they'll cast you into prison and all
[1:04:39] those things and brother Mannis said
[1:04:40] it's like a mother that before she lays
[1:04:44] down her child for bed and before she
[1:04:46] leaves the room at night times she
[1:04:47] whispers this way brother man said this
[1:04:49] is his illustration of Christ's love she
[1:04:52] whispers little Johnny or Timmy was this
[1:04:54] case Timothy little Timothy I'm gonna
[1:04:57] shut the lights off now don't be scared
[1:04:59] I'm just in the other room
[1:05:01] I've got it like I heard a joke one time
[1:05:04] it's kind of a funny joke I think but a
[1:05:08] boy was asking a mother you know a boy
[1:05:10] was asking his mom mom can you stay with
[1:05:12] me - I fall asleep and he just wouldn't
[1:05:14] fall asleep and the mother is left and
[1:05:16] said I got to go to sleep
[1:05:17] I gotta go sleep with Daddy so I gotta
[1:05:19] leave you here and the boy said why is
[1:05:21] daddy's such a scaredy cat she's like I
[1:05:25] gotta leave you I gotta sleep with Daddy
[1:05:26] well why is daddy such a scaredy cat I
[1:05:29] thought that was kind of funny and
[1:05:33] that's not why the mom you know that's
[1:05:35] like the story buddy I'm told that's not
[1:05:37] why the mom left but the mom knows the
[1:05:39] child has to get victory over fear
[1:05:41] there's nothing to fear when the child
[1:05:43] is full of love amen you give that child
[1:05:46] a good kiss on the cheek and a hug
[1:05:48] prayer right there in their bed then
[1:05:50] they feel they should feel the love of
[1:05:51] God amen
[1:05:52] how many times did my children said
[1:05:54] daddy I feel the spirit of fear I'm
[1:05:55] scared of this can you pray with me
[1:05:57] before bed we've done it so many times
[1:05:58] and I just rebuke that spirit of fear in
[1:06:01] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:02] there's nothing be afraid other nothing
[1:06:04] like this we actually haven't had it in
[1:06:05] a few months now by God's grace Oh Mary
[1:06:07] thank you know sometimes children see
[1:06:08] things they shouldn't see or know where
[1:06:09] they you know just how it is that
[1:06:11] they're you know out here in Laodicea
[1:06:13] but we have power over that he said you
[1:06:16] have the power of love and a sound mind
[1:06:19] amen glory verse 9 who has saved us and
[1:06:24] called us with an holy calling that's
[1:06:26] how I teaching the the kids the other
[1:06:27] night you have a holy colony everyone's
[1:06:29] called to holiness that's your calling
[1:06:31] live holy the Bible second Peter ones
[1:06:33] that you're called to virtue I'd only
[1:06:35] want to be strong for Christ you
[1:06:36] actually called to be strong you can't
[1:06:38] say well I can't be as strong as brother
[1:06:40] so-and-so or sister Sohn so you can be
[1:06:42] as strong as God made you to be strong
[1:06:44] don't limit yourself by comparing
[1:06:46] yourself to somebody else let me be as
[1:06:47] strong as Christ wants me to be praise
[1:06:49] God let me be strong in the faith that
[1:06:52] may be a testimony to others let me be a
[1:06:54] source of strength a source of virtue
[1:06:56] because Christ has called me to virtue
[1:06:58] let me be a brave testimony let me be a
[1:07:00] brave Christian for Christ Jesus amen
[1:07:02] hey man
[1:07:03] glory hi we're not called according to
[1:07:08] our works but according to his own
[1:07:11] purpose and grace which he has given us
[1:07:12] in Christ Jesus before the world began
[1:07:14] then I'll encourage you God had a
[1:07:16] purpose for your life before the world
[1:07:18] ever began now don't be scared of it now
[1:07:20] don't be scared of it but just trust him
[1:07:22] he has a purpose for your life it was
[1:07:25] written before the foundation world I'm
[1:07:28] trying to get down to okay let's keep on
[1:07:30] but now is made manifest by the
[1:07:32] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who
[1:07:33] hath abolished death and has brought
[1:07:35] life and immortality to light through
[1:07:36] the gospel where and who I'm appointed a
[1:07:38] preacher an apostle and a teacher of the
[1:07:40] Gentiles see that's where a a preacher
[1:07:42] could have more than one gift teacher
[1:07:43] apostle and we know he was a pastor in
[1:07:46] Ephesus so Paul a preacher could have
[1:07:48] more than one gift in the fivefold
[1:07:49] ministry that's your scripture right
[1:07:50] there that's the blessing verse 12 for
[1:07:53] the the which cause I also suffer these
[1:07:56] things nevertheless I am not ashamed for
[1:07:58] I know whom I believed and I'm persuaded
[1:08:01] that he's able to
[1:08:02] keep that which is which I have
[1:08:03] committed unto him against that day let
[1:08:07] me just stop their moment here Paul said
[1:08:11] it's because of Christ that I will
[1:08:13] suffer what's he gonna do he's gonna
[1:08:14] suffer martyred him he's gonna suffer
[1:08:17] death he's gonna have his head chopped
[1:08:18] off in a few days or weeks or whatever
[1:08:20] this is the last letter and his words
[1:08:23] are I'm suffering for these things for
[1:08:27] the gospel nevertheless I'm not ashamed
[1:08:30] to die for Christ for I know whom I have
[1:08:33] believed Paul met Christ face-to-face
[1:08:39] can I say it like that he met him as a
[1:08:41] light on the road to Damascus and then
[1:08:43] he went to Arabia and the Bible said
[1:08:46] Jesus Christ Himself gave me the
[1:08:48] revelation of the gospel if anybody
[1:08:50] changes their curse he had vision after
[1:08:52] vision after vision meeting after
[1:08:55] meeting with that pillar of fire Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ so he tells Paul don't be scared
[1:09:00] don't be scared and I'm not scared to
[1:09:02] die because I know who I am
[1:09:05] I know where I got the revelation from I
[1:09:07] know where I've heard from I've heard
[1:09:09] from God himself amen and Paul tells
[1:09:11] Timothy that's what you must remember
[1:09:13] remember who you've heard from you've
[1:09:15] not heard from a man you've not heard
[1:09:17] from a church you've heard from the
[1:09:19] throne of God a man you've heard thus
[1:09:21] saith the Lord you've heard from God's
[1:09:23] Word and that's what our souls must
[1:09:24] anchor in amen you know who you believe
[1:09:27] you know who you heard the Word of God
[1:09:29] from amen that's right that's what Paul
[1:09:32] says what is this is where it all comes
[1:09:33] down to I'm going to die and don't let
[1:09:36] fear come upon you and I'm fine with my
[1:09:39] destiny I'm fine with God's plan for my
[1:09:42] life to die as a martyr
[1:09:43] because I know who I believed amen
[1:09:45] hallelujah
[1:09:47] I know who made me the promise and I
[1:09:49] knows tell me these things it's got all
[1:09:51] mighty it's God's plan for my life amen
[1:09:54] for I know whom I have believed and I am
[1:09:58] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[1:10:00] which I've committed unto him against
[1:10:02] that day Christ has persuaded me that
[1:10:05] all my hopes and dreams and everything
[1:10:08] that I've wondered about that he he will
[1:10:11] hold it that he will take care of it
[1:10:13] I've committed to his hand
[1:10:15] should I do am I called to do more
[1:10:17] missionary work am I called to do this
[1:10:18] or that all the questions anything that
[1:10:20] was a question in his mind he committed
[1:10:22] all that to Christ I am in Christ's
[1:10:25] hands and Christ will take care of me
[1:10:27] hey man now I want to watch this look at
[1:10:30] here's where the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:10:32] is so important look at verse 13 and 14
[1:10:34] this is why we got to be born again if
[1:10:35] you're not born again you don't have
[1:10:37] stability like you need to have
[1:10:39] that's why brother man preach that
[1:10:41] message why are the people at church
[1:10:42] people so tossed about he stay because
[1:10:44] they don't live in the holiest of Holies
[1:10:46] that means they're not born again right
[1:10:48] they live out in the outer court they
[1:10:50] serve God just in the flesh they just
[1:10:51] made me go to church but they're not
[1:10:52] really committed in their mind their
[1:10:54] minds may be little transformed but
[1:10:56] they're not fully born-again the soul so
[1:10:58] they're kind of tossed all the time but
[1:11:01] Paul is gonna die he's telling Timothy
[1:11:03] be sound and verse 13 hold fast the form
[1:11:06] of sound words which thou has heard of
[1:11:08] me in faith and love which is in Christ
[1:11:12] Jesus so you have to hold the word
[1:11:14] you've heard from the prophet of God in
[1:11:16] faith and in love not in fear you catch
[1:11:19] that
[1:11:20] he just said God doesn't give you the
[1:11:21] spirit of fear hold the word I've said
[1:11:23] unto you in faith and in love
[1:11:26] glory remember my words in faith in love
[1:11:31] verse 14 that good thing which was
[1:11:33] committed unto thee what the gospel keep
[1:11:36] by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us
[1:11:39] amen how is Paul gonna keep how is Paul
[1:11:42] gonna help the next generation to see
[1:11:45] the gospel and power of Christ he's got
[1:11:47] to keep it by the power of the baptism
[1:11:49] of the Holy Ghost in his heart hey man
[1:11:51] the Prophet won't be there before he can
[1:11:54] go ask questions or go visit Paul
[1:11:56] anymore the prophets going off the scene
[1:11:57] he's got to hold fast the truth of the
[1:12:00] gospel with power and love and a sound
[1:12:03] mind by the Holy Ghost in his soul
[1:12:05] that's the only way he'll hold fast the
[1:12:07] Word of God
[1:12:08] hey man and then you know the chapter he
[1:12:13] ends the chapter by saying everybody's
[1:12:14] left me you're one of the few preachers
[1:12:16] actually believe the message all of
[1:12:19] asia's turned away and he names those
[1:12:21] people that have fallen away he name he
[1:12:22] calls them out by name in the letter now
[1:12:27] see
[1:12:27] Paul's not telling Timothy to be a
[1:12:29] pushover he's saying hold these things
[1:12:32] with power don't be fearful you're gonna
[1:12:36] be all alone with no more profit you're
[1:12:37] me all by yourself but he said remember
[1:12:39] what you heard and hold fast this by
[1:12:41] faith and love I think we can all see
[1:12:45] that by the grace of Lord go to uh let's
[1:12:49] go to acts 4:31 I think you familiar
[1:12:52] with this one I preached on this
[1:12:53] numerous times I think when the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost fell the second time in the book
[1:12:57] of Acts member there in a prayer meeting
[1:12:58] up in upper room and the Bible said God
[1:13:01] shook the place and bowed and said Lord
[1:13:03] you know if they shake this place but
[1:13:04] shake us shake our lives shake our lives
[1:13:08] up so we can have more yielding to the
[1:13:11] Holy Spirit right shake our lives ups
[1:13:13] our lives can get back in order show us
[1:13:15] your power show us your love right oh my
[1:13:18] lord shake up my life so my only desire
[1:13:20] is to please you praise the Lord x4 31
[1:13:24] and when they had prayed the place was
[1:13:26] shaken where they were assembled
[1:13:27] together and they were all filled with
[1:13:28] the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word
[1:13:30] of God with boldness Paul told Timothy
[1:13:34] don't be ashamed of me don't be ashamed
[1:13:36] of the Lord don't be ashamed of the
[1:13:38] message right hold they'll hold that in
[1:13:41] your heart with faith and love by the
[1:13:43] power of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:13:46] aren't you glad for the anchoring power
[1:13:47] of Christ you got to have that if not
[1:13:50] you'll be tossed to and fro the Bible
[1:13:52] said you'll be a like a man who's
[1:13:53] unstable in all his ways double minded
[1:13:55] well one day it's right one day it's
[1:13:57] wrong one day it's back and forth we
[1:13:59] need faith and love and a holding fast
[1:14:01] by the seal of God in our souls in other
[1:14:04] words say Lord plan it so deep it goes
[1:14:06] down to my soul amen let it go past the
[1:14:09] flesh let it go past my mind let it go
[1:14:11] into the soul where I can't explain it
[1:14:12] but I know it's a presence I know it's a
[1:14:15] substance in my soul amen
[1:14:18] it's part of my nature my nature is the
[1:14:21] Holy Spirit my nature has faith my
[1:14:23] nature has hope and love and that's my
[1:14:25] nature let it go all the way down to the
[1:14:27] soul praise God hey man where I'm
[1:14:30] anchored in Christ Hebrews 13:5 let your
[1:14:35] conversation be without covetousness
[1:14:38] never say oh I wish I had this
[1:14:40] wish I did like this so it's like
[1:14:42] somebody else and be content with such
[1:14:45] things as you have for he has set who's
[1:14:47] he God for God has said for the reason
[1:14:51] we can be content and not covet things
[1:14:53] of the world is for he has said I will
[1:14:55] never leave thee nor forsake thee I
[1:14:59] don't have this we say oh I don't have
[1:15:01] this I need this I need this and God
[1:15:03] saying you have me praise God I mean
[1:15:06] that's just a simple the simple gospel
[1:15:08] so remember many times we just make it
[1:15:11] too difficult sometimes we make it too
[1:15:13] difficult seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:15:16] God and what's the promise everything
[1:15:18] else to be added unto you
[1:15:20] that's why we put God's Word his house
[1:15:23] the message we put God's word above
[1:15:26] everything else and then everything else
[1:15:28] we need will be added how many witness
[1:15:29] to that I'm an absolute witness of that
[1:15:32] by the grace of God I've tried to put
[1:15:34] God first and everything no compromise
[1:15:35] with the word first and everything I've
[1:15:37] needed God has provided by His grace
[1:15:40] verse six so that we say so when we
[1:15:43] remember I'll never leave there forsake
[1:15:45] thee we may say how boldly now with fear
[1:15:50] so that we may say boldly the Lord is my
[1:15:53] helper and I will not fear what man
[1:15:57] shall do unto me aim God does not give
[1:16:01] the spirit of fear being anxious and and
[1:16:04] nervous and frightened and expecting
[1:16:06] wrong all the time God does not give
[1:16:08] that spirit and what's the problem we
[1:16:10] sometimes covet or we're discontented I
[1:16:12] wish I need that it's got to happen it's
[1:16:14] God we're so discontented but we got to
[1:16:16] be content that Christ is with us amen
[1:16:19] we must be content that he said I will
[1:16:22] never leave thee I will never forsake
[1:16:23] thee how many believe that boldly and
[1:16:27] boldly say it not like well I'm just
[1:16:29] saying it because the preacher said it
[1:16:30] I'm just saying it because the Bible
[1:16:31] said but having a conviction it's
[1:16:33] something I believe it's from my heart
[1:16:35] it's from my soul and you can say the
[1:16:37] Lord is my helpful I will not fear what
[1:16:40] man shall do unto me Amen I will not
[1:16:43] fear if I lose my job I will not fear if
[1:16:46] this family forsakes me I will not fear
[1:16:48] if this doesn't come through like it's
[1:16:50] supposed to come through I will trust in
[1:16:52] God because God said I will
[1:16:54] leave thee nor forsake thee hey man so
[1:16:58] again it's gotta be opposites faith and
[1:17:00] fear how to be opposites because love
[1:17:03] casts out all fear
[1:17:04] and herein fear the Bible said you have
[1:17:06] not fear man but the boldly say the Lord
[1:17:09] is with me how many really think this is
[1:17:13] an important message I do because we go
[1:17:16] through trials all the time and Satan
[1:17:18] tries to con constantly bombard us with
[1:17:21] fear constantly there are so many
[1:17:25] examples you when I go for a run a dog
[1:17:27] will bark at me and I get all nervous
[1:17:28] I'm fearful I must be a for a fearful
[1:17:30] person I'm not really proud of that
[1:17:34] but a little dog a Bart get me out of
[1:17:36] that I'm in my zone I'm trying to pray
[1:17:38] and trying to sing you know it happens
[1:17:42] in everything like when Haven got cut on
[1:17:44] the on the the cheek there you know she
[1:17:46] fell had to go the ER in that moment as
[1:17:51] a father I'm watching I'm holding my
[1:17:54] daughter's cheek and had a major
[1:17:55] puncture wound in it which had required
[1:17:57] six stitches and I'm seeing you know
[1:17:59] just to be a little bit graphic but
[1:18:01] feeling the blood pour out in that
[1:18:04] moment that's the moment where we need
[1:18:06] to have faith and I caught myself just I
[1:18:10] honestly God knows how I caught myself
[1:18:12] like all nervous like honey honey honey
[1:18:14] cuz I don't like blood I don't I'm not
[1:18:18] doctored brother Jesse I'm not a doctor
[1:18:20] I'm not like that thank God we have them
[1:18:22] amen glory cuz I don't I don't handle
[1:18:26] that thing I don't handle pain well you
[1:18:27] know some like sometimes like that but
[1:18:29] something overcame me brother Simon I
[1:18:31] just got there we're talking about the
[1:18:32] Lord and what God is doing and something
[1:18:34] just came over me and Simon looked at
[1:18:36] her Simon was so calm this time I said
[1:18:39] just you're gonna be alright
[1:18:40] just just cover it you're gonna be
[1:18:42] alright don't don't be scared and Simon
[1:18:45] said these words Simon said Haven God
[1:18:48] protected you and instead of your eye
[1:18:50] getting hit God protected you and let
[1:18:53] your cheek it hit instead because she
[1:18:55] could have lost an eye on the way the
[1:18:58] hospital my wife said she drive along
[1:18:59] taking Haven to emergency room there and
[1:19:01] havens only words or the word she was
[1:19:03] saying was mommy I'm so blessed she said
[1:19:08] god allowed my eye not to be lost and he
[1:19:11] just let me get hit in the cheek so all
[1:19:13] the way there and set up being overcome
[1:19:15] with fear what do we have to do we have
[1:19:16] to overcome that with faith and then
[1:19:19] brother Simon the next day record his
[1:19:20] testimony and he's seen three people die
[1:19:22] in front of him and God has raised all
[1:19:24] them up three of them on the job site I
[1:19:27] just put the video on our YouTube page
[1:19:29] if you want to watch it in the last five
[1:19:30] years he's seen three people fall and
[1:19:32] die or at work they have pretty those
[1:19:36] sometimes the people don't follow the
[1:19:37] law so you know so they fully fall off a
[1:19:40] scaffolding and things like that he's
[1:19:42] seen three people die with no pulse and
[1:19:44] they've all come back to the glory of
[1:19:46] God so see he was tested God let him go
[1:19:48] through those tests and he said when it
[1:19:51] first happened he got nervous when the
[1:19:52] first man died but the second third time
[1:19:54] he said God allowed him to take control
[1:19:56] of the situation because faith doesn't
[1:19:59] stand back and say hello faith has hair
[1:20:02] on his chest
[1:20:02] faith has got big muscles the man said
[1:20:05] face says shut up and sit down I'm
[1:20:07] telling you what to do so the third time
[1:20:09] it happened brother Simon told everybody
[1:20:11] what to do
[1:20:12] call 9-1-1 do all this pray for a pray
[1:20:14] form and then a man later come back and
[1:20:15] said that God totally healed the person
[1:20:17] he was dead no pulse and came back to
[1:20:19] life huh me no God's a healer today I
[1:20:21] thought that might encourage your faith
[1:20:23] I didn't plan on saying that just kind
[1:20:24] of come out the Lord is my helper a
[1:20:28] helper I will not fear what man or can I
[1:20:31] add this what the devil will do to me
[1:20:33] because if God allowed the devil to do
[1:20:35] it then it's got allowed it we've got to
[1:20:37] overcome Damon first John 4:16 now read
[1:20:43] this earlier and we have known and
[1:20:45] believed that one God I'm sorry believe
[1:20:47] the love that God hath to us God his
[1:20:50] love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:20:51] dwelleth in God and God in him so are
[1:20:55] you living in love is that what you're
[1:20:56] that's our testimony that's always
[1:20:58] saying I'm walking by faith living in
[1:21:02] love I am covered Hardy walking that way
[1:21:05] today the Bible says we are to walk in
[1:21:07] love and there's no fear in love here is
[1:21:12] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:21:14] boldness in the day of judgment so what
[1:21:16] is perfect love do it makes you be bold
[1:21:19] as you approach the day of judgment
[1:21:22] not bold like well I'm gonna tell God
[1:21:24] all about but bold like I know where I
[1:21:25] stand with God I had been in God's
[1:21:29] presence and I know where I stand with
[1:21:30] God isn't that a powerful testimony
[1:21:32] Church that's what the Bible says about
[1:21:34] love we're gonna read that if you got
[1:21:36] you got a chance today 1st John 4:17
[1:21:38] here and as our love made perfect so
[1:21:41] when love gets completed that we may
[1:21:43] have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:21:45] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:21:48] amen the only way we can be in this road
[1:21:52] as he is in that world is to live from
[1:21:54] our soul because that's where the seal
[1:21:56] of God is that's where the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:58] amen go or you see that that's my
[1:22:01] brother Graham can tell testimonies of
[1:22:03] people dying and they say oh this is
[1:22:05] this you know this is a sad party life I
[1:22:07] forget the man I forget Paul Blair oh no
[1:22:10] no that's not Paul there but Paul Rader
[1:22:12] I think might even Paul Rader I got the
[1:22:13] few mixed up they asked him they said
[1:22:16] you're gonna die now are you scared or
[1:22:18] is this the worst time your life he said
[1:22:20] no this is the greatest time in my life
[1:22:22] because in five minutes I'm dying but in
[1:22:24] five minutes I'll be in the presence of
[1:22:26] Christ is that bold or fearful about the
[1:22:29] day of judgement that's bold see because
[1:22:33] you've been in God's presence that's
[1:22:35] where I was gonna go at the end you the
[1:22:37] reason you don't fear other people and
[1:22:39] other things and you know you don't fear
[1:22:40] the boss or fear the pastor you don't
[1:22:43] fear a preacher you don't fear anybody
[1:22:44] because you've been in the presence of
[1:22:46] somebody greater than a preacher or a
[1:22:48] boss or a pastor you've been the
[1:22:50] president of Jesus Christ amen that was
[1:22:52] my punchline I was gonna hit the end but
[1:22:54] that's all right God come on live it
[1:22:56] earlier by the grace of the Lord you
[1:22:58] understand that by God's grace that's
[1:23:00] why you don't fear that's why you need
[1:23:02] to pray if you possibly can before our
[1:23:05] trial comes I've got an important
[1:23:07] meeting I'm gonna make sure you pray
[1:23:09] because if you get in his presence then
[1:23:11] you won't fear that presence you might
[1:23:15] feel a little anxiety but how many times
[1:23:16] have I had meetings how many times have
[1:23:18] I had situations waiting for emails or
[1:23:22] people or people attacked me or
[1:23:24] different things like that and how many
[1:23:25] times that if we just pray beforehand we
[1:23:29] can actually go into the meeting or we
[1:23:31] can go into that that situation have
[1:23:33] confidence going into it
[1:23:35] with a smile on your face and knowing
[1:23:37] that Christ is with me he said he'd
[1:23:39] never leave me or forsake me how many
[1:23:41] want him with you that's that's what
[1:23:44] it's all about praise God that's what
[1:23:46] it's all about that he is with me as the
[1:23:48] scripture said we may say boldly the
[1:23:52] Lord is my helper I will not fear what
[1:23:55] man shall do to me let me find a place
[1:23:57] to close here my I never got to really
[1:24:04] what I want to get to but that's okay
[1:24:06] he's anybody pulling out their exhibit
[1:24:08] pone and that's I have to wonder about
[1:24:10] that anymore but if I missed it forgive
[1:24:12] me I tried to stay right with the Word
[1:24:13] of God
[1:24:13] the first appearance of fear there's 700
[1:24:16] scriptures
[1:24:16] the first one is Genesis 3:10 where Adam
[1:24:19] and Eve is sin and it says and he said I
[1:24:22] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[1:24:23] afraid so the very first instance of
[1:24:26] fear is Adam and Eve being fearful of
[1:24:29] the voice of God before God could talk
[1:24:32] to them and they weren't afraid so when
[1:24:34] some we know when someone sins and when
[1:24:36] someone commits a trespass against the
[1:24:38] Lord it brings a fear to the voice that
[1:24:41] they once loved that's why people be
[1:24:43] scared coming to church were scared
[1:24:44] talking to a pastor or scared talk and
[1:24:46] anybody who's got the Word of God you
[1:24:48] know that's I'm gonna hold them
[1:24:49] accountable because if they're living in
[1:24:51] sin they don't have confidence with God
[1:24:53] they have fear of that they have a fear
[1:24:56] because fear a torment so what does Adam
[1:24:59] Eve do they go hide themselves right in
[1:25:01] the bushes and they hide away it's the
[1:25:03] very first instance of fear so sin
[1:25:07] brought fear to hide from the voice they
[1:25:10] once loved oh my god help us to always
[1:25:14] be open to hearing that loving voice of
[1:25:15] Christ may we not run from that voice
[1:25:18] but may we draw closer to that voice the
[1:25:22] last appearance of fear for something
[1:25:24] for some reason not just an alpha an
[1:25:25] Omega because there are 700 scriptures I
[1:25:27] just I thought well I wonder what the
[1:25:29] first and last scriptures are the last
[1:25:30] Scripture and I think we need to look at
[1:25:31] this one revelation 21:8 but the fearful
[1:25:35] the unbelieving and the abominable and
[1:25:38] murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers
[1:25:39] and idolaters and all Liars shall have
[1:25:42] their part in the lake which burneth
[1:25:45] with fire and brimstone which is the
[1:25:47] second death
[1:25:48] you know people can go to hell and burn
[1:25:51] because of once in fear did you know
[1:25:55] that and it's the first one listed
[1:25:57] church and what's the major disease
[1:25:59] isn't it still heart disease brother
[1:26:00] Scott that kills people do you know I
[1:26:01] thought I looked up a few years ago on
[1:26:04] the internet and I thought heart disease
[1:26:05] and the Bible said that it may be men's
[1:26:08] with their hearts failing for fear jesus
[1:26:11] said that perplexity of times and roars
[1:26:13] and rumors of wars suicide in America is
[1:26:18] at the highest rate it's ever been
[1:26:19] Time magazine just put a new article
[1:26:22] about a preacher put on the interface
[1:26:23] book last night I saw the anti
[1:26:26] antidepressant they called it because
[1:26:29] all the antidepressant drugs are not
[1:26:30] working why because those drugs are not
[1:26:32] the Spirit of God and drugs are not
[1:26:35] going to help so much it's gonna be the
[1:26:37] Holy Ghost is going to help because
[1:26:40] Jesus said I am your peace I know you're
[1:26:42] gonna have trouble but I'm leaving you
[1:26:43] my peace praise the Lord so they think
[1:26:47] they got a new drug to help all this
[1:26:48] epidemic they're not going to be able to
[1:26:50] these days must be like the days of Noah
[1:26:52] and we have to shine the light and we
[1:26:55] have to receive the love of God with
[1:26:56] faith and love and stand there and
[1:26:58] boldly say the Lord is with me we have
[1:27:00] to stand the midst of all this and be
[1:27:02] lights to others that we might bring
[1:27:03] others to Christ hey man but Church the
[1:27:07] very first sin listed that will not
[1:27:10] inherit that city is fear fear afraid
[1:27:17] timid fear and I just want to look at a
[1:27:23] few
[1:27:23] scriptures remember with godly fear you
[1:27:25] can say people preaching fire brimstone
[1:27:27] will save people job 123 says that
[1:27:29] brother Branham says that we need if we
[1:27:30] need a fire brimstone religion sometimes
[1:27:32] Jude 1:23 save them through fear the
[1:27:36] Bible says pulling them out of the fire
[1:27:38] there's times people need to hear fire
[1:27:40] and brimstone messages but I want to say
[1:27:47] a few things when people take the mark
[1:27:50] of the beast when this tribulation
[1:27:51] starts and they sell out and take that
[1:27:54] mark they sell out because of fear of
[1:27:57] losing their money and food buy and sell
[1:28:02] people will go to hell and burn because
[1:28:05] they love food and their money more than
[1:28:09] the gospel of Jesus Christ more than
[1:28:11] being able to stand up against that
[1:28:13] beast now that all of our visitor hell
[1:28:15] knows it but the Beast is actually the
[1:28:16] spirit behind the Roman Catholic Church
[1:28:18] they're sweet people
[1:28:19] but that beast sits on seven hills and
[1:28:22] Rome sits on seven hills I don't know if
[1:28:23] you knew that but we could take you
[1:28:25] through the scripture on that the people
[1:28:27] and there are sweet but the doctrines
[1:28:29] are idolatry and they worship Mary and
[1:28:31] they do all these awful they pray to
[1:28:33] dead Saints and there's nothing in the
[1:28:34] Bible about that it's it's full of
[1:28:37] unclean spirits the Bible said but we
[1:28:38] could take you through that it's what I
[1:28:39] want you to know I'm not preaching on
[1:28:41] people I'm preaching against that spirit
[1:28:43] and this is the spirit of fear I'm gonna
[1:28:47] lose all my bank account and brother
[1:28:50] Branham said they'll compromise in order
[1:28:52] to have some public ministry he said
[1:28:56] preachers will compromise so they can't
[1:28:57] least have a church still and have some
[1:29:00] type of public ministry fear the fearful
[1:29:04] will not inherit the kingdom of God and
[1:29:07] will have their names
[1:29:09] I'm sorry Burton the lake of fire that's
[1:29:13] serious Church the Bible said he that
[1:29:15] denies me before men shall be denied
[1:29:17] before the Holy Angels in Luke 12 nine
[1:29:20] fearful they're more afraid of a man or
[1:29:23] government than they are of God fearful
[1:29:26] that was our only sin remember the rich
[1:29:28] young ruler he only had one sin what was
[1:29:29] it you love money Jesus had ghosts
[1:29:31] everything your ghost so everything all
[1:29:33] the other Commandments he kept so once
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:37] keep somebody from being say there's one
[1:29:38] thing they won't surrender that's why we
[1:29:40] got to surrender everything amen
[1:29:42] let Christ in every area of your life
[1:29:43] every situation let Christ and
[1:29:46] everything don't hold on to sin get rid
[1:29:48] of it
[1:29:48] flee from it burn it get as far away
[1:29:50] from yourself as possible amen that you
[1:29:52] might be saved amen glory did you ever
[1:29:59] think of that not remember adulterers
[1:30:04] and fornicators will go to hell and one
[1:30:08] one one article I read online said
[1:30:11] they're afraid to be single they're
[1:30:14] afraid to be single even after a person
[1:30:16] gets divorced they're scared to be
[1:30:17] single again they got a marry second
[1:30:18] third for time because of fear oh I
[1:30:22] don't want to be alone and that's always
[1:30:23] the card they pull and I'm not trying to
[1:30:25] be critical but that's always the card
[1:30:26] they pull oh I don't want to be alone
[1:30:28] and yes you feel sorry for them we feel
[1:30:30] sorry it's got to be hard to be alone
[1:30:32] but we must remember Jesus said I'll
[1:30:34] never leave you alone we must keep the
[1:30:37] commands the commands are more important
[1:30:40] than feelings and ideas the commands
[1:30:43] God's Word is what's most important amen
[1:30:45] adulterers will not inherit the kingdom
[1:30:47] of God
[1:30:48] fornicators will not jesus said it's
[1:30:56] like a parable where God the Father
[1:30:59] invites everybody to the marriage of his
[1:31:01] son and the Bible said they said the
[1:31:03] suppers ready in Luke 14 verse 18 and
[1:31:06] they all with one consent begin to make
[1:31:08] excuse the first set of them I have
[1:31:10] bought a piece of ground and they must
[1:31:12] have needs go and see it I pray thou
[1:31:13] have me excused he was more fearful
[1:31:17] about his ground I don't know something
[1:31:19] with his ground the pressure of his
[1:31:22] ground and money in the future was more
[1:31:24] important than the marriage of Christ
[1:31:29] the next thing and another said I bought
[1:31:31] five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them
[1:31:34] he's more fearful about maybe getting
[1:31:36] behind on his farming than he is to go
[1:31:40] to the rapture with Christ Jesus
[1:31:43] another said I've married a wife so see
[1:31:46] a lot of these motivations can be fear
[1:31:48] all I'm gonna lose my wife I'm gonna
[1:31:49] lose my husband Jesus
[1:31:51] if you're not willing to forsake
[1:31:52] everything and follow me you're not
[1:31:53] worthy of me everything must be for
[1:31:57] sucking in order to obey the commands of
[1:31:59] God because the commands are God's love
[1:32:01] and God's protection God's commands are
[1:32:06] his protection to us we believe that
[1:32:09] they keep us safe God's commands ours
[1:32:11] love to us
[1:32:12] people say well God's not a bunch of
[1:32:14] rules well it is a rule God has rules
[1:32:17] and commands that protect us just like
[1:32:19] you have rules at your house you have
[1:32:21] rules so you don't burn yourself at the
[1:32:22] stove you have rules you have to follow
[1:32:24] so you don't hurt somebody at work right
[1:32:25] I just talked about the rules I have to
[1:32:27] follow in case there's intruders rules
[1:32:29] protect you if you follow them that's
[1:32:31] what God's Word is it is the rule that
[1:32:33] leads us to eternal life amen
[1:32:36] man-made rules are called legalism
[1:32:39] they're things that the Bible does not
[1:32:40] say there are additions to the Word of
[1:32:42] God yes we don't have man-made rules but
[1:32:44] we do have the rules of God's Word and
[1:32:47] there's a scripture that proves that
[1:32:48] flipping in 3:16 we're not gonna read it
[1:32:50] but the Bible said let's all keep the
[1:32:52] same rule the Bible says that there's
[1:32:54] one rule and that's love the Lord thy
[1:32:56] God with all thy heart soul mind and
[1:32:57] strength let me try to close here I'm
[1:32:59] having a tough time closing I'm so
[1:33:01] enjoying this I hope you're enjoying it
[1:33:02] by God's grace I can I can't even
[1:33:04] scratch the surface on fear it's so much
[1:33:08] so see the the fear of losing life the
[1:33:11] fear of losing a relationship the fear
[1:33:13] of losing money and all these things the
[1:33:17] fearful will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:33:20] God fear is contagious look at
[1:33:23] Deuteronomy 20 verse 8 fear is
[1:33:25] contagious just like love is contagious
[1:33:28] we all know demons you know that you
[1:33:30] like to gather each other around and get
[1:33:32] help and everything like that we've read
[1:33:33] quotes about that before but Simon read
[1:33:36] some quotes last time on that
[1:33:37] Deuteronomy 20 verse 8 it's contagious
[1:33:40] fear is contagious but so is faith look
[1:33:45] at Deuteronomy verse 8 Moses talking
[1:33:47] about the law of warfare and the
[1:33:53] shall speak further under the people and
[1:33:55] they shall say what man is there that is
[1:33:57] fearful and faint-hearted let him go and
[1:34:00] return into his house less his brother's
[1:34:02] heart faint as well as his heart God
[1:34:06] said if I'm gonna have an army I can
[1:34:09] have no fear in my army
[1:34:11] amen praise God because if I sense a
[1:34:17] little if we sense a little fear and so
[1:34:18] and so a little fear and so and so that
[1:34:20] fear will jump on somebody else right so
[1:34:24] God told Moses if somebody else is
[1:34:26] scared get him out because he's gonna
[1:34:28] make his brother scared a little leaven
[1:34:31] leavens the whole church the whole army
[1:34:35] remember judges chapter 7 verse 3 God
[1:34:38] told Gideon he said the first thing you
[1:34:40] do he said he had a listen Church he had
[1:34:42] a he had a new church of 32,000 people
[1:34:44] in his church can you imagine a church
[1:34:45] like that and he's pastor of a church
[1:34:47] with 32,000 people I'm just typing that
[1:34:51] you know and the very first sermon
[1:34:53] remember when he preaches a few years
[1:34:54] ago this is beautiful we preached the
[1:34:56] whole books a whole life and get in I
[1:34:58] felt it was beautiful his very first
[1:35:00] sermon was coming out and he come out
[1:35:02] and said he could have said like this he
[1:35:04] could said thus saith the Lord whoever's
[1:35:05] fearful go ahead and leave our camp
[1:35:07] that's his first sermon as a new pastor
[1:35:10] first sermon let's get all the PR and
[1:35:13] you know how many left twenty-two
[1:35:15] thousand twenty-two thousand out of the
[1:35:19] thirty-two thousand left he's left with
[1:35:21] ten thousand and then he had to slim him
[1:35:23] down a little more a little more till he
[1:35:26] only had three hundred the very first
[1:35:29] thing God said was I don't want fearful
[1:35:31] people in my army I need people of faith
[1:35:34] because fear is contagious it will
[1:35:38] paralyze you I've never been so scared
[1:35:40] to get paralyzed as a brother have said
[1:35:43] unbelief he said paralyzes your faith he
[1:35:45] says you don't know how to pray don't
[1:35:48] know sure what to do all these things
[1:35:52] God's army does not have room for fear
[1:35:59] if fear
[1:36:01] is continued to be fed and believed then
[1:36:04] what you fear will come upon you so it's
[1:36:06] like a self-fulfilling prophecy that's
[1:36:07] the words we use in education if
[1:36:09] students say well I can't learn this I
[1:36:11] can't learn that it's self-fulfilling
[1:36:12] prophecy it's even in its science
[1:36:15] science knows that say like education
[1:36:17] knows it the words you say produce the
[1:36:20] result because power power in the tongue
[1:36:23] is life and death in the power right and
[1:36:25] the tongue life and destined power of
[1:36:27] the tongue forgiveme job 3:25 said for
[1:36:30] the thing which I greatly feared has
[1:36:32] come upon me and that which I was afraid
[1:36:35] of is come unto me Joe feared one day he
[1:36:39] loses children Joe feared one day he
[1:36:41] loses health Joe fear one day he lose
[1:36:43] all his money and that's what happened
[1:36:45] the Bible said it actually happened to
[1:36:47] him he said because I fear Him other
[1:36:48] Bram said that in perfect faith you want
[1:36:50] to look it up job said Joe fear what he
[1:36:52] feared came upon them but yet church
[1:36:55] looking and all this the cow gracious
[1:36:56] God is God looked down from heaven and
[1:36:59] said Satan there's a perfect man because
[1:37:03] God was looking at his end result God
[1:37:05] was looking at what job was going to
[1:37:07] become after the trial
[1:37:08] God was looking at what he was through
[1:37:10] the blood aren't you glad Christ looks
[1:37:12] at you through his own blood and there's
[1:37:14] no sin and Christ's blood it's only his
[1:37:17] righteousness amen and he sees us
[1:37:19] through his blood amen
[1:37:21] and that's what God so the situation job
[1:37:24] allowed this because he had fear he just
[1:37:27] meditate on the fear too much it come to
[1:37:29] pass but yet God said I know he'll go
[1:37:31] through this trial and he'll be better
[1:37:32] at the end amen
[1:37:33] he'll learn from this situation I just
[1:37:37] have to close with one or two quotes
[1:37:39] here I'm already going to
[1:37:39] hour-and-a-half
[1:37:40] I got a close here the program says this
[1:37:45] in
[1:37:45] 19:53 talking about israel he said the
[1:37:51] first thing we want to find out is that
[1:37:53] this has been the greatest thing that I
[1:37:56] found him on Christian people throughout
[1:37:57] the entire world has been a fear they're
[1:38:01] always afraid my brother Adam says this
[1:38:04] over this is the vein I hid I just
[1:38:06] looked in great fear in one sentence
[1:38:08] there was like 84 hits I went through
[1:38:09] all the quotes maybe half of them said
[1:38:12] this but Ram said of all my traveling
[1:38:14] around the world the greatest thing I
[1:38:16] find the hinners of the church is fear
[1:38:19] when they should have faith but fear has
[1:38:25] gripped ahold he said when a little
[1:38:27] sickness strikes they're afraid many I
[1:38:28] wonder sometimes and now I'm along with
[1:38:31] you but now when I'm trying to do
[1:38:33] tonight and this week is to try to drive
[1:38:35] that fear away by God's Word amen he
[1:38:42] says one of the greatest curses on the
[1:38:44] church today is fear everybody's scared
[1:38:46] to death what's gonna happen who he said
[1:38:49] why Jesus even said when the fearful
[1:38:51] sights come he said lift up your head
[1:38:53] and rejoice for your redemptions nigh
[1:38:55] when these things begin to happen
[1:38:58] hallelujah amen the greatest thing I
[1:39:04] find against the church deny is fear so
[1:39:07] who's your greatest battle most of times
[1:39:08] we gonna fight yourself fear coming into
[1:39:12] your own mind yeah I know Jesse Smith is
[1:39:15] my worst enemy but along with that is
[1:39:18] the spirit of fear trying to get onto my
[1:39:20] flesh the sin nature that's inside of me
[1:39:23] making Jesse Smith the flesh fearful the
[1:39:27] greatest thing against the church
[1:39:29] against us tonight is fear everybody
[1:39:31] scared to death about some what are you
[1:39:33] scared about if a man's born again he
[1:39:35] should be happy carefree just like these
[1:39:38] fellows signing up here and the brother
[1:39:40] testifying back there just free there
[1:39:42] ain't nothing to harm you
[1:39:43] nothing present nothing future nothing
[1:39:46] can separate us from the love of God
[1:39:47] that's in Christ God has promised he
[1:39:52] said God has called you by election he
[1:39:54] has said his church in order Jesus that
[1:39:56] no man can come to me except the father
[1:39:57] draws him you never
[1:39:59] come to God because you wanted to you
[1:40:01] come because Christ called you could we
[1:40:05] just go back to that for a moment on
[1:40:06] Wednesday night brother Graham said you
[1:40:09] had nothing to do with your salvation it
[1:40:11] is not Jesus plus your works it is Jesus
[1:40:14] only amen and that's our brother Brahim
[1:40:16] is trying to drive the fear away from
[1:40:17] the people you're not the one that came
[1:40:20] to this God called you to this amen God
[1:40:23] culture to the word God called you to
[1:40:25] the truth and he said be not afraid I'm
[1:40:27] with you always fear not what man can do
[1:40:30] but boldly say the Lord is my helper
[1:40:32] Christ is with me Amen hallelujah amen
[1:40:38] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:40:40] the father draws him you can never come
[1:40:42] to God because you wanted to
[1:40:44] he said God called you and he that comes
[1:40:46] to me I'll no eyes cast out I'll give
[1:40:48] him eternal life not just lasting for
[1:40:50] one week one revival to another but
[1:40:52] everlasting eternal life and raise him
[1:40:55] up at the last day and program says this
[1:40:58] quote if that doesn't take the wind out
[1:41:00] of Satan sails I don't know what does
[1:41:03] praise God
[1:41:05] these simple scriptures we just read
[1:41:07] over and forget sometimes these
[1:41:09] scriptures will take the wind out of
[1:41:11] Satan's sails in other words they'll
[1:41:13] take the fear out of your life the fear
[1:41:15] out of your thinking the fear out of
[1:41:17] anything that's bothering you the love
[1:41:19] of Christ and the confidence that he's
[1:41:21] with you and called you and ordained you
[1:41:23] before the foundation world that will
[1:41:25] take all the winds on a satan sails hey
[1:41:28] man that's John 6:39 and this is the
[1:41:31] Father's will which he has sent me that
[1:41:33] of all which he has given me I should
[1:41:35] lose nothing Church Christ is not going
[1:41:38] to lose you if he called you and he
[1:41:40] invited you to this he's not going to
[1:41:42] lose you just trust and obey amen
[1:41:45] I should lose nothing but shall raise it
[1:41:48] up against the last day and this is the
[1:41:50] will of him that sent me that everyone
[1:41:53] would see it the Son and believeth on
[1:41:55] him may have everlasting life and I'll
[1:41:56] raise him up at the last day let's say
[1:41:59] into our feet here I better stop because
[1:42:00] I'm just going to keep going all day
[1:42:02] there's only one service I feel like I
[1:42:04] could preach all day because still got
[1:42:06] the good anointing on me I feel strong
[1:42:10] now we didn't get to there so much I
[1:42:12] I hardly touched the surface but I want
[1:42:18] to just close with these last few things
[1:42:22] Psalms 23:4 yea though I walk through
[1:42:25] the valley of the shadow of death I'll
[1:42:29] fear no evil why David for thou art with
[1:42:35] me
[1:42:36] what are we holding on to today Church
[1:42:38] the promise of God that he's with us the
[1:42:42] God that called us for newest that saved
[1:42:44] us by grace the just shall live by faith
[1:42:46] by his faith the gift of his faith to us
[1:42:50] now Jesse Smith kimbos William Branham
[1:42:53] can't boast you put the preacher name in
[1:42:55] there nobody can boast about salvation
[1:42:57] it was Jesus only and the God that
[1:43:00] called you will keep you if we just
[1:43:02] surrender to his will
[1:43:03] how many want to surrender to his will
[1:43:05] programs that maybe troubles coming in
[1:43:08] we know as we look ahead and see the
[1:43:10] great stormy tides of death yonder as
[1:43:12] David of old said I'll fear no evil thou
[1:43:15] art with me
[1:43:15] he said we thank thee we adore thee
[1:43:18] seeing the souls come to thee as a
[1:43:20] vindication of your presence and he goes
[1:43:28] to Elijah he says I always thought of
[1:43:29] him as a great big man tall maybe skinny
[1:43:31] and we see that he was a fearless man
[1:43:33] when the Spirit of God was upon him he
[1:43:39] did not worry about what anyone thought
[1:43:41] about him or what the world had to say
[1:43:43] as long as the Spirit of God was on him
[1:43:46] and you know I kind of believe that's
[1:43:50] just about the attitude of the church
[1:43:51] now or anytime or anybody so this is
[1:43:54] anytime or anybody's here
[1:43:57] sickness nothing bothers you as long as
[1:44:00] the Spirit of God is near you and you
[1:44:03] know it let a person be so ever so sick
[1:44:07] and let the Holy Spirit come into the
[1:44:09] room and anoint that person and you'll
[1:44:11] see a change person in a few moments
[1:44:16] does everybody believe that what will
[1:44:22] change
[1:44:22] the situation the spirit of God because
[1:44:25] God is love let's bow our heads have a
[1:44:28] word of Prayer here we just want to take
[1:44:30] a few moments here and we want to pray a
[1:44:36] little bit talk to the Lord I don't know
[1:44:42] why I felt so impressed to preach on
[1:44:44] fear I'd really like to get the church
[1:44:46] age done but there's a purpose the RAM
[1:44:50] said fear is the greatest hindrance to
[1:44:52] your life how many want to be free from
[1:44:54] hindrance of fear would you just raise
[1:44:56] your hands I can see okay let me pray
[1:44:58] for you let's let's pray and ask God's
[1:45:00] presence here to minister to us well
[1:45:04] Rams a Christian he's not a triad it's
[1:45:06] an O so it's something that's real
[1:45:11] when brother Graham prayed he said this
[1:45:14] may every fear and every dread every
[1:45:18] nervousness everything be away from the
[1:45:21] human mind just now that your spirit
[1:45:24] could come in here and give us the
[1:45:25] greatest climax we've ever had in any
[1:45:28] meeting let's pray
[1:45:29] Heavenly Father I preached your word
[1:45:31] Lord God I sent your presence Lord God
[1:45:34] Lord as your prophet said you are trying
[1:45:37] so hard to push your way into our lives
[1:45:40] Lord God in many times Lord as we said
[1:45:42] the beginning it's our own sin it's our
[1:45:44] own mistakes or our own decisions that
[1:45:46] keep your spirit away dear God and Lord
[1:45:49] I just asked now Lord you see the hands
[1:45:51] Lord you see those that maybe could have
[1:45:53] raised their hands maybe you see those
[1:45:56] who maybe struggle with fear anxiety or
[1:46:00] did I know different ones who struggle
[1:46:02] with it all the time and they that's
[1:46:04] their battle they'll get victory and it
[1:46:07] comes back the victory comes back Lord
[1:46:09] you've allowed us all battles I don't
[1:46:11] know the extent Lord God of the people's
[1:46:14] trials but you do and father we ask now
[1:46:18] Lord as we sing here in worship that we
[1:46:21] could get in your holy presence and in
[1:46:23] that presence Lord would drive off fear
[1:46:27] away the love of God would come down as
[1:46:30] your prophet said about Elijah he was
[1:46:33] fearless as long as he could sense your
[1:46:35] presence this
[1:46:36] Samson the same thing for all these
[1:46:38] Bible characters Lord God but Lord today
[1:46:40] were the characters where the Bible
