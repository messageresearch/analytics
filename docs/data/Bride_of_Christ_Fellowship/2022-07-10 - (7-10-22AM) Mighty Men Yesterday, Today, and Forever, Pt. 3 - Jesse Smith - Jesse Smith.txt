========================================

acts chapter 18 verse 24. acts 18 and 24. like to look at this mighty man of god and that beautiful last week you got to see that this mighty man of god he's not even born again but the bible calls it a mighty man of god twice amen so george that's why we say it doesn't matter your age today as long as you're a christian as long as you're saved and the process of being sanctified you can be mighty in the lord no matter your age male or female right young or old you can be mighty as you yield to the holy spirit amen as you give god everything that you have how do you want to give god everything that you have amen even the little children want to give god everything you have you could be mighty for jesus christ amen verse 24 and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into a ki the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace let's all read verse 28 together ready one two three for he might convince the jews and that publicly shown by the scriptures that jesus was christ may god as blessing to read his word you may be seated god bless you i have some slides of course today i'd like to continue on this thought you're regarding uh mighty men yesterday today and forever you know with the passing of brother clement i just thought i'd just share you know his picture in case anyone didn't remember him i think he preached one time in this sanctuary if not it was the other one i can't quite remember but we just want to remember him and his family you know his family rather there's a picture of him if you haven't seen him so i think he's one that gave sister naomi our our phone number here to contact us if i'm not mistaken he was 76 when he passed away 76. and this just reminds me of you know brother samuel's dad brother james when he passed away five years ago it's already been five years hard to believe that another minister who passed away at 75 and he's the brother that told me brother jesse take care of yourself now he didn't tell me not to race malachi and austin in the parking lot so i wish somebody would have told me that no but he didn't tell me to take care of my body which i've done i've honored that that was a wonderful wisdom there but just you know i was looking thinking about i've known two ministers you know the last five years that that i've known closely passed away and uh let's pray for his family you know his wife had passed away his first wife passed away a couple years ago sister beatrice said that she would she was a real woman of faith just a sweet woman there but you know this reminds me of the bible says teach us to number our days uh that we may apply our hearts to wisdom and i just want to show that you know every believer thinks jesus is going to return to their day brother random thought this was in 1963 brother thought i don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but i do believe so he was believing we're so close to the coming lord that i would never die with old age yet at 54 years old i'll never die with old age until he's here brother ran thought for sure he'd come within my lifetime that's right he was born in 1909 so 2009 would have been 100 years old for brother branham right and then 2019 would have been 110. so 11 12 113 years old this year but he just believed i don't think i'll die i think jesus is going to come in my lifetime now don't you think these preachers did as well don't you think how many think jesus is going to come into life come in your lifetime i i think so i pray and ask god lord show me i think i've heard that again this week i was like just show me if he's if you're going to come in my lifetime or not you know just i don't know if he will but i just that's my request but brother and told us you know in this questions and answers don't change a thing he said if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like it's going to be 10 years from today in other words in other words don't be a fanatic about it you know don't don't act like you know all about it be humble but he said but live like it's going to be at this hour amen now i also take this to uh to believe as well live your life like you're going to spend your whole life here naturally in other words take care of your body so if you do live to the old age then the bible the bible calls them evil days when we talk about that wednesday night brother after church remember the creator of the days of your youth because there's going to be there's going to come evil days right or we'd say some will be more evil than others you know depending on what god allows and what also we choose in our lives right so i just thought i'd share that you know and i've shared this before i've known people that you know when i first come to the message they're like oh don't even build a house or don't even finish college you know jesus is going to come before we finish college you know it's been many years you know since we've been covering the message so i just you know from from that little reminder there i just thought well god help us to live such godly lives uh help us to live that we we live like we hope he's gonna come in our life but let's live like he may not that's right in other words like brother man said let's leave footprints on the sands of time so the next generation would come they'll know how to serve jesus christ let's leave a testimony here by the grace of god and church this is the best indicator of the rapture not only been the message but about uh about 20 years now almost 20 years and i've seen things come and go i've seen people take quotes and major on certain quotes and to me at this point this is the scripture that will give us the best indicator of when the rapture is going to come it's the brother random said i believe the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god because brother and said it was prophesied in revelation 13 16. now this is this could change but as a minister of the gospel as the best of my ability i could be wrong i'll say i believe just like brother ram said i believe he'll come in while i'm alive you know i believe when we see the united states start changing laws to persecute christians that's when i believe the rapture will come okay i'm not looking for atomic bombs you know atomic bombs could come and the rapture is still going to come look what happened to world war ii just because the topic bomb falls doesn't mean we miss the rapture it may be part of some scripture or prophecy we haven't understood yet the thing to do is be ready confess all your sins watch and pray amen serve god with all your heart soul mind and strength amen amen but live your life like you only have so many so i'm 41. so if i live to be one i'll just say 75 i got 34 more years i got three more decades to preach it's been a wonderful two decades preaching i hope i can preach uh three more decades by god's grace i hope i can live longer because i try to take care of myself i hope i can the bible says right and then you have a little more strength you get to 80 if you have a little more strength so i'm hoping god will give me that extra boost of strength praise god just because i want to share the gospel i want to teach people you know it seems like my ministry is an online ministry united which is fine as far as other than pastoring i want a pastor but i want to be able to impact as many people as i can by god's grace but this is still the best indicator when that's why i watch the news from time to time you know i keep track with the laws they write and uh you know the voting that's why i still pray about elections and just like with roe v wade if we ever wondered if god hears our prayers we should now know god hears our prayers so i cried tears up here before service i cried tears that god would take away these murders these murderers out of the government and i'll keep doing that by god's grace because i know god hears my prayers hallelujah so let's look at part three i guess i'll just kind of transition into the preaching here by god's grace let me set a timer for an hour um never know how long it may go here by god's grace but uh we read our texts here now we're again we're trying to increase our faith i'm not really going to be teaching you something like wednesday and i was teaching about the doctrines of devils and how that can uh satan can kind of uh slip into our lives if we make brother branham's life a tradition we can't make his life and try to interpret his life how we want we gotta just look at his life and we're gonna take everything back to the word of god praise god we've got to be humble um we never want to exalt ourselves as we're something great now it's interesting i say that now i'm telling you that you're mighty okay so you need to know that you're mighty but don't exalt yourself like you're great praise god in other words let god's power flow through you mightily praise god recognize that i have the ability as i yield to the holy spirit god can use me mightily but let us never pat ourselves on the back and say oh he's so great she's so great or they're the greatest thing since sliced bread they're the greatest ever you know they we saw that on wednesday let's never let's never be guilty of that by god's grace so that's maybe the lord will help us here raise our faith here i want to start with apollos you know he was a mighty man made more mighty okay so here we are you know we think how can i be a mighty man how can i be a mighty woman in the new testament you know the thought just came to me now look at the woman at the well did god use her mightily yeah in just a moment's time jesus discerned her she runs into the city she tells the city come and see a man that's told me everything i've done isn't this the messiah and look how mightily god used her testimony praise god amen almost the whole city gets saved amen she convinces almost a whole town to come out and hear jesus preach and discern that's a mighty woman can i say it like that praise god amen that's a mighty woman just thought of that one here but the one we looked at last sunday was priscilla right priscilla a holy ghost wife who opened up her home as a church it's actually in the book of corinthians paul says paul says i greet aquila and priscilla and the church that is in their house they didn't have big buildings right when the message first started you know when the christianity started they didn't have great big buildings that was until constantine allowed that but then they were perverted churches by that time so priscilla opened up her house to the the preachers to paul her and her husband got the holy ghost praise god but then they had to leave rome because rome had an outlaw against all jews talk about a racial time you know they they kicked out all the jews out of the city they hated jews but they overcame that praise god they still found a new place they met paul they became tet makers praise god and they became so one with the message that when they come to ephesus and met apollos they said now that's a mighty man as far as he knows [Applause] praise god and this man and woman take this mighty man to the side and they help tell him there's a more perfect way there's a more wonderful way to serve god praise god amen you're mighty in your current condition but you can be mightier praise god amen amen hallelujah let me know that god's message has made you more mighty praise god amen amen see i imagine i just imagined by the amen was a mighty soul leader in this in his denomination but god's made it more about it here praise god hallelujah man was a mighty servant to the church that he was in you know serving them but see god wants to make you more mighty in spiritual matters praise god hallelujah so remember he was mining the scripture instructing the way of the lord and then around 80 54 he helped or he was taught more perfectly by aquila and priscilla and then we see him he goes to acai then corinth and then when the apostle wrote his first first epistle to the corinthians apollos was right there with him so apollos was not a pastor it's likely he was a teacher and an evangelist because he kept going from you know ephesus to k.i to corinth and then we hear about the last we hear about him is in titus 3 verse 13. paul tells them perhaps apollos will be able to come to you at a convenient season and there's nothing then known about him as far as these historians know uh tradition makes him a bishop of caesarea but you know we don't it's just man's tradition there's nothing in the scripture about that but i want you to notice he had six attributes of a mighty man now some of you have these attributes you don't have to have all these attributes you just have to have some of these attributes and you can be mighty in the things of god if you are mighty in the scriptures and this would i likely be the uh the gift of knowledge because knowledge is understanding of the scripture if you are mining the scripture you just the scripture just seem to come to you just when you need them right at the right time just to know what to say you know the right scripture that'd be mighty in the scripture right if you've been instructed in the gospel you could be mighty having that instruction that knowledge some of you are fervent in the gifts that god has given to you you want to be fervent with him boiling right you want to be active you want it to be something that's constantly moving in your life how do you want to be moved by the spirit praise god you know we're all going to battle you know fatigue and tiredness and stress wrong about that but we also we want to be able to get refreshing from stress and we all want to be fervent in our human spirits praise god amen that's part of being mighty or letting god's spirit move through you mightily he was diligent which means he was just constantly there constantly teaching constantly in the scripture he was diligent you didn't find him taking seasons off praise god uh you didn't find him you know lazy or missing where's he at where's where's he at today did he you want to come to church today you know if you didn't find out about apollos he was diligent with it praise god if he made a commitment he was faithful to that commitment praise god and he was bold publicly so in public he would be able to stand there and defend and be a witness for what he believed he did in other words he didn't care who was around praise god right i think about your job sometimes you can be a witness you don't care who's around you're going to stand for jesus i know you have because you've been singing on the job because we get to see some of the fruits of that you know hallelujah just bowl for jesus saying not ashamed of the gospel amen hallelujah and not only was he that but he could convince people in a public debate that's right now of course uh that day was a day where many people would be safe it was the it was like an open door age we're in the closing door age that's right so few and fewer would be saved but he was able to convince them publicly through all these attributes that he had praise god amen amen now we get uh three important things here believers can be mighty in operating their gifts before the new birth the church we got to be encouraged even if we're not born again or praying about if we're born again or not let's not forget that god still wants to use us in our daily lives amen he can still use you mightily like i was sharing you know with some of my children i've seen different testimonies where god has used them and caused them to help adults and they're just children you know uh so i want us to have that understanding no matter your age no matter if you're male or female preacher not it doesn't matter god wants to use you amen amen so let your faith rise hallelujah god wants to use you amen and now notice god god magnifies public preaching and debating some people are against debates now brother adam sometimes was for sometimes he was against it brother graham was against the spirit of competition debate that's what he was against but brother brother had at least three debates i proved that a couple years ago when i i went through this quote he got at least three debates one on the oneness of god uh one on tongues and i can never remember the third one but he had at least three debates that he was a part of and god god thought so much of apollos because he would debate the bible publicly that he called him mighty on two occasions mighty and then third god can use a woman like sister priscilla that's a pretty good name if we have any more girls that's a pretty good name for said i like that one with gifts of the holy ghost to make a man more mighty god can make a man more mighty by using a woman hallelujah and it wasn't even his wife church let that soak in for a minute he's a mighty preacher but a holy ghost-filled woman god used her and her husband to point this guy to a greater truth a more perfect revelation amen hallelujah why because she learned from the prophet of god she learned from the church age messenger praise god amen she knew what the holy ghost was amen the bible says they so they were working together so jesus church you can be a woman and be a mighty woman for god you can be a man and not even be a preacher aquila wasn't even a preacher but you can testify and help people and point them to the truth and god can use you to make somebody more mighty praise god amen amen now it's possible she had the gift of wisdom knowledge maybe other gifts maybe prophecy maybe god gave her a prophecy or you will be born again and a certain maybe thus saved the lord maybe you'll be born again in in court or something like that we don't know but the way they testified the way she spoke with aquila it caused him to go deeper in the faith and cause him to meet up with paul and no doubt he was born again praise god amen hallelujah and women always sisters you always have the liberty to testify well let me tell you what jesus did for me praise god amen that is not a serving authority over men this is a serving authority when you get up here you preach the word of god you tell them what to do you have you have control over all these all these people praise god that this is a serpent authority but just testifying after service or testifying uh at the job or something that's not a surfing authority that's being that's being submissive to god's gifts that he's placed in your life amen amen hallelujah see born again through the prophet of god of her age just like we are and she would find opportunities to testify with her husband and she wasn't going out there trying to preach on the streets by herself she just waited for the right opportunities she opened up her home right and then she can testify in her home after the services and then she could pull the preacher aside with her husband and testify to the the preacher right she just found opportunities to talk about the lord how many believe that's probably the most exciting times in your life when you get to witness and share the word with somebody those are some of the greatest times that's when i feel the most alive many times of course preaching i always feel alive up here too but you know outside of preaching when i feel most alive is when i get to share the message with somebody when they actually want to hear what i have to say and it sounds like they're really interested in the word of god like like brother nj is a more recent example i just got to testify right there and i'm like i'm going to go get this guy the book and then he said did god tell you to bring me the book because i was just the holy spirit just told me don't wear tight clothing and that's exactly have a whole chapter on that you know and he knew it was god but those are the times you feel alive like i know god was using me i was walking in god's divine plan for my life at that moment praise god man testify that there's a greater power than denominational power there's holy ghost power amen amen that's when you feel alive like god's using you and how do i know i'm not preaching to some preachers here today right all the brothers here that are qualified right all that are qualified i could be preaching to you trying to make you more mighty praise god because someone came along named brother brooks and brother craig they helped me become a mighty man right not that i'm staying almighty but it's the holy spirit working through me mightily that's helped me overcome all my trials the reason i'm still standing here is because the holy ghost has worked mightily in my life praise god amen the reason you're here today is because the holy ghost has stood up for you have stood in you praise god i've given you grace to receive the word of god he's working vitally through you right now praise god the fact you're still standing amen this is an age where men's hearts are failing for fear praise god all the fear and all the torment about the future we're not made to fear we're not built to fear we cannot continue going on fear we've got to have faith amen and that's what it is it's the mighty god and baal before us amen unveiled in our lives god working through our lives mightily praise god amen amen amen hallelujah don't ever think yourself so uh no powerless yes you have no power of your own but god works through you mightily in your day-to-day life amen hallelujah day-to-day life god's power works through us mightily just like sister priscilla that mighty system there i'm gonna go shake her hand in hand one day and say you were a mighty sister because you made this brother more mighty right she was like come on up here she's like come on up there maybe they both reach down grab your head come on up here to the higher round come on up here to the third work of grace come up higher in the message of the hour so apollos was a convincing mightily convincing which means he disproved with rivalry and effort in a contest so the public debates are like a contest right but apollos had the holy spirit on him in a mighty way in order here he said to win the contest to win the argument like we like we like watching the charlie kirk arguments and we like debates rather because we know truth will prevail amen and that's how it is with the word of god if you stand for god's word god's truth will prevail in you and when you stand up to the enemy or any obstacle or anyone speaking an evil against you and you speak the word of god and you manifest the love of god then god has used you mightily amen because church you've seen it it just takes one person to sway someone away and they'll fall away from the faith or like some of the brothers we've had it just takes one sexy dress woman and then he falls away right right or some of our sisters just takes one handsome man you know and she'll fall away it's happened at our church before numerous times that's all it takes and so when you're able to stand against the enemy and refute the enemy praise god and win the contest then you've won the battle and that makes you more than a conqueror praise god hallelujah in your everyday life praise god like that song we sing something keeps holding me like each one of us know there's probably times of our life if if god didn't intervene we probably would have we probably would have lost a real awful battle amen we probably would have made a disgrace of our lives but who stood up for us jesus stood up for us amen he said his word the right time he gave us a testimony he helped us what we feel win a debate or win a contest he helped us fight the good fight of faith and we overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony god made us strong god made us mighty that's what he's here to do today make us fighting praise god amen amen you know those guys got confused one time a year ago i was preaching brother cams and i said i'm just like joshua there's no man that's going to stand before me all the days of my life now some of the guys i've debated and gone against they said well well you said that i that i fell before your feet i never said that i just said no man can stand before me no man can get in my way of where i'm going praise god that's right hallelujah no man or no woman can get in my way in other words i'm moving on with god i'm walking the perfect will of god i'll just say excuse me get out of my way i'm moving on with jesus praise god i'm not forsaking the message i'm not forsaking truth i'm standing for truth and no obstacle will stand before me i'm moving on with god i'm going to possess all that god has called me to possess amen that's what i mean by that that's right man it's a spiritual battle praise god not a physical battle and god mightily anoints men to do this like paul would debate there in acts 17. he every saturday he would go debate that was his debate day you know that's what i'm hoping if god ever helps me to retire with the lord jerry's if i ever retire at 17 or 17 more years of work then i can retire so maybe warn that lord willing but if god ever allows me to retire i'd like to just have a day of witnessing in the public wouldn't that be awesome yeah i could just go to panera just sit there and wait for somebody to walk sit down and just kind of go hey you ever heard about jesus you know i just wouldn't that'd be nice just to to debate or suck a flag and say change my mind right man okay change my mind set up a big flag and say change my mind just sit at the table there but some you know we have and i i appreciate people that do that today it takes real courage it takes real moments like apollo said but see god anoints men to do this men and women that know the truth they're not afraid of the truth you can't you cannot deceive the very left there it is you cannot deceive the very election it's impossible praise god we don't have all the answers we don't know everything but you cannot deceive the very elected that's the reason they are the elect that's the reason they are the chosen because they are chosen before the foundation of the world and the mind of jesus christ and they've received not the spirit of lies not the spirit of delusion but the spirit of truth amen amen amen now you are madly everybody say i am ever saying ready i am i am i am mighty in one of these areas you're mighty one of them even you little girls little boys version even him you're mighty in one of these areas wisdom is the sound advice what to do and when to do it now's the time to do this let's do this by the leadership of the holy spirit now just the scripture says this oh and then and then it's like a door's open oh now i can enter into that yes the scriptures this is what i should do faith is a revelation that god is going to answer prayer because faith moves mountains i know it's going to move because god already showed me god put it on my heart it's going to move amen healing is over time god will heal the person because you prayed for it miracles that's going to happen right now and the laws of nature are going to be suspended hallelujah amen i repeated miracles how did i do that one two three four five six okay i missed one in there oh discernment i forgot discernment the sermon is judging the spirit is this the spirit of jesus christ or is this his antichrist spirit how did i forget that um seven is prophecy for telling the future whether with thus save the lord or dreams tongues is a language of men or angels and nine is the interpretation of an unknown tongue okay so you are mighty in one of these areas remember these are the least of the gifts but when they were restored in 1906 that's what god used god was using those to let them know i'm restoring the gifts amen praise god and i'll say like this whatever gift you have god will lead you into its operation god had to lead god had to like really lead moses into operating his gifts really like on the backside of desert go show himself as a fire that would not be consumed god really had to lead him to use his gifts in other words god has something in your life god's gonna bring it out at the right time just keep trusting god honor god fear god be strong in the lord and god will bring your gifts to pass in your life if you wait upon him praise god because when you wait you renew strength praise god amen it's like you're building up strength it's like those moves that we have in uh taekwondo we got those what are those moves called now those you have tension moves right and you're just kind of building up power then you just release the power that's kind of how your spiritual life is you pray every day right it's just building up building up for this certain moment of your life and that's when you pray the prayer of faith amen hallelujah praise god pray all week you're just kind of building up building up building up building up and then it's released you build it up the bible said build up your most holy faith praying in the holy spirit praise god amen and god pours those out right and you'll know the time because you'll you'll be under the anointing that's right you're walking in the spirit walking on the under the anointing by the grace of god amen hallelujah amen and now remember music is a healing gift so brother amen our singers you know our songs special people remember the evil spirit was unsolved david took it and he played and it refreshed them right evil spirits leave when people sing and praise god amen amen hallelujah it's a gift of divine healing that's right says that there's nothing like music so brother amen this would encourage anybody you know god used my music did you know that uh-huh god heals my music god heals by love see love god heals my medicine god is by prayer god has many ways of healing depends on what type you need so i'll say this whatever you need god's got it for you have faith amen believe however you need whatever you need god is going to find a way to get you that just wait on the lord god's testing your faith just trust him trust him with your life trust him with your soul trust him with your mind your body your finances trust them with everything god is for you who can be against you praise god hallelujah amen who can be against a mighty man or woman break god amen that's right hallelujah sometimes a little love stretched out that's interesting you got to stretch it out sometimes we need to be stretched that's right sometimes we need to go beyond our comfort zone how do they know i don't know if i can do that and god's like yeah you can let me stretch you out a little bit here that's what i'm doing right now i tore my i went to the doctor this week he said i tore my muscle yeah i didn't tear it off the bone i just ripped the muscle so now it's building up scar tissue you said now you got to stretch it out every day so i got to these stretches every day and they stay i feel a little better but that's what happens church we get scarred in our lives somebody to hurt us or that we'll be disappointed why didn't god move there we'll be mad at god sometimes but what do we need we need god to stretch us out a little bit stretch this out lord help me to be more flexible help me to look outside my perspective and help me to see your divine perspective amen how many tell me to see outside a 2022 perspective help me to see the eternal sight of eagle site that you have looking down from heaven praise god help me to understand that you have something bigger for me in the future that i could even see i just need to be faithful now i need to trust you now you've got better eyesight than i do praise god amen amen sometimes a little love stretched out will just cure an old sore an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal it right over just a little love just a little care amen sometimes when you feel all down as we call it a street expression down the dumpsy just put on one of those tapes that music or a record and go to play yeah just put the record on okay put the record on i'm just kidding you have to put it on your phone we don't have records anymore just put on the old record actually they sell them into akron i've seen they still they have a record store for the old timers you know go playing the first thing you know you're patting your foot on your hand it's all over right up you're ready to go again see so when you feel like i can't serve god today i don't want to serve god today that's when we need the strength of the lord that's why we need god's spirit and church we have something to do with that god's given us control over our three realms amen we know we know how to get it moving put on some music amen do something put on a sermon amen call a brother text a sister do something try to get the faith of god stirred up in your heart let that mighty man or woman come out of you amen amen amen amen come with my soul don't you get shy on me because you've got a lion you've got an ego amen inside of that soul praise god amen get up and praise the lord amen you're mighty man of valor amen you mighty woman about valor get up and praise it all right amen amen hallelujah you don't know the end we don't know what i was going to do but we know he's going to do great things like our memory verse says we know god has plans for us not of evil but thoughts of peace hallelujah amen to give us an expected end hallelujah now here's if you have the gift of faith the bible calls it the prayer faith that means you can just pray for something and you when you feel you're anointed then that god's going to move on your behalf the prayer of faith shall save the sick what saves them god anointing your prayer to be mightily answered amen that will save the sick praise god and the lord shall raise them up but god needs you to pray that's right and the church said god's going to raise them up but who's he need to pray you and i what kind of prayer a prayer of faith that's trust right trust and if he had committed sins they shall be forgiven and that's why i will say confess your sins right first because verse 16 confess your thoughts one to another pray for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so see when a fervent prayer prevails it could be a gift of faith now in the greek fervent is the same word as effectual so uh some reason the translators just added two words to describe it so the word effectual means to be operative to be at work to put forth power so can i say it like this the putting forth of a powerful prayer prevails much in heaven amen glory to work for one to aid one to display one's activity a fervent prayer is displaying and one's activity in prayer to show oneself active so we must be active in our prayers we must know our prayers are at work our prayers have power that's right hallelujah but the key there is what a righteous man or woman we've got to confess all of our sins praise god and then that kind of prayer prevails much with the mighty saints hallelujah now let's look at paul's display i believe he was a mighty man of god amen i believe he was the greatest christian of all time i could be wrong on that but i believe it just because of all the bible evidence his sufferings uh his labors of love his missionary work he labored more than all the apostles and we know the apostles sit right around jesus so i'm entitled to my opinion praise god just like people are entitled to their opinion but i'm entitled to mine there's ten miracles recording the scripture now there could be more uh that's what i've just found online his first miracle recorder was a wondrous miracle uh elias the sorcerer was struck with blindness so paul could get the counselor saved the deputy saved that was his first noted miracle in the scripture he smoked somebody blind with literal blindness for a season okay a wonder they just wondered wonder wow i didn't know remember the deputies like i didn't know god did this in his doctrine and his power mighty miracle mighty wondrous miracle second the bible just said he did signs wonders uh through paul and barnabas in acts 14. so elimus was acts 13 acts 14 is signs wonders and miracles with barnabas acts 14 paul heals a crippled man through his ministry so a healing a miracle next in acts chapter 16 paul casts out a devil they call it an exorcism a casting out of a devil uh that's a powerful work of god that's a miracle right because the miracle's instant when that devil leaves it's instant deliverance jesus said that too because he said you no man can do a work in my name a mighty work in my name except he honored me now i'm kind of misquoting that a little bit but you understand unless he shows reverence toward me so casting on the devil is an absolute miracle the devil that's been living there for we say weeks months years has to go he's been kicked out of his house because it's not his house it was purchased by the blood of jesus christ amen hallelujah fifth there was a wonder uh in acts chapter 16 paul and silas's prison doors were open and the prison keeper and his family were saved that's a wonderland whoa god shook the whole prison and all and the chains fell off and everything that's a wonder that's right right wonder signs wonders miracle scientists telling you something to come right a miracle instant healing or instant instant raising up of a or something signed wonder miracle praise god i appreciate god versus greg say man so to me like my grandpa's testimony he was on 77 south by grandpa garza uh he was going down the mountain and the truck either he got out of the lane or the truck out lane he said he was coming going 70 miles per hour and gonna hit the truck head on he said he flew up his threw up his hand and said jesus and the next thing he remembers he's parked on the side of the road with his wife and there's not one thing wrong there's not even a scratch this is my grandpa yeah you know he would and he would just have testimony after testimony after testimony that's a wonder like whoa how did that happen wonder how in the world did god do that did he just rapture did he translate the cover after the card and said how do you do that how do you do it so we have signs wonders and miracles see god makes us wonder at his power and his glory how many believe that by god's grace amen i believe it praise god next in acts chapter 19 12 men are filled with the holy spirit uh that's i'm not sure but that would be a sign wonder miracle it wouldn't be a miracle i'll just be the preacher in the gospel but number seven uh god worked unusual miracles through paul's hands and also the cloths that were a part of his body touched by his body those are wonders and then eighth he resurrects eutychus eunice fell out of the second floor building was dead they come and prayed for him they raised him up he's a long-winded preacher that night amen but god raised up raised it from the dead praise god that's great miracle next in acts chapter 28 paul shook up off a viper off his hand and threw it in the fire that's a wonder wonder why he should have died they thought he was a god right and then paul heals the father of publius uh his bloody flux and he healed many more on the island of molita so just a island revival that he had divine healing 10 americans i'm going to say paul is my lead by god amen amen that's what he said remember colossians 1 from part 1 he says he has christ in him the hope of glory i labor so he still labored striving according to god's working so he had so many miracles but he would still preach warn and teach every man in all wisdom so his life just wasn't all miracle today miracle tomorrow his life had miracles scattered around but every day the bible said he would open up his apartment there in acts chapter 28 and for a year and a half i believe he just took in everyone that wanted to hear the gospel he'd warn them he'd teach them it's still the same power of god amen still the same mighty god amen in between mighty miracle signs and wonders he was constantly warning teaching preaching just being faithful to the gifts of god in his life that was still mighty because he said it's christ working in me mightily praise god amen amen amen and that's what jesus is doing in your life he's working in you mightily should have heard louder amen there we go that's better i'll take that that's better he's worked just be encouraged he's working in you mightily he has something he's accomplishing praise god amen remember just remember that illustration he's building you up he's as you wait upon the lord you're getting stronger and then he's going to release his power amen just waiting for the next miracle praise god like i told brother austin alina just hang around one of these services there's going to be america praise god amen give me a sign god's going to come through the window or god's going to heal somebody fill somebody with the holy ghost or god's going to do something praise god but we're storing up power we're storing up strength and then god will pour on his grace finally towards us because he's working in me day after day week after week month after month year after year decade after decade he's working in me mightily he's working in us mightily to accomplish his will for this generation amen amen amen all those who were born again and on their way to being born again as we saw with apollos god's working in us mightily now here's some people might start questioning paul's might here in acts 23 paul's before some jewish leaders and paul reviles the high priest and he didn't know it kind of just rebuked him a little bit and what'd they do they smacked paul right on the face and paul said oh i didn't know i didn't know he was the high priest right now but look at the power of god look at the power of god in him he did not fight them back when was the last time you were smacked across the base or beat up and you didn't punch him back see we we love the viper and the fire we love the viper we love the jailhouse and uh we love that but here still the mighty power of god was flowing through the prophet amen to take a slap and just say i didn't know it i didn't know and the next scripture in the bible said god gave him a word to divide the mob so he could get away he says i was a pharisee of the pharisees those said she's like what you believe in angels you believe in resurrection let's fight about that and so paul is able to get away fight each day will live and fight another day praise god hallelujah mighty man he said it works in me mightily praise god and even if somebody says something bad about me on facebook or on instagram or twitter or whatever you can still there with love forgive them and pray for them praise god even if it's smacking you on the face because that's what jesus said he said when you show love let turn the other teeth to them so they can smite the other cheek and we're not told that paul got smacked twice but we know he got smacked at least once and he did not smite him back we're talking about mighty new testament believers how many believe you are you're one of those by god's name i believe you are praise god if you stood this long you're mighty in the word of god amen amen your mighty in the gifts god is place in your life praise god and just build up the power keep exercising those spiritual muscles praise god god's gonna use them paul says we have this treasure the holy ghost and earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not us so when i say when i say you're mighty i'm not talking about your power i'm talking about the holy ghost inside no he was mighty paul was mighty we believe it but yet he had trouble on every side of him right not some sides every side so he had trouble after church now he's probably enjoying the preaching right but he had trouble after church he had trouble with being robbed there's a whole other scripture that talks about that he was robbed so many times he had trouble traveling there's always some trouble traveling ships sinking and all kinds just awful awful things trouble everywhere he looked there was trouble yet he would not let himself be distressed no matter how much trouble there was he wasn't going to lose hope why because he had something mighty inside amen god was still working mightily in him he said it works in me mightily despite troubles everywhere i look i got troubles on my phone i got troubles at the job i got troubles at my house i got troubles at the church no matter where he went no matter where the troubles were he never let the troubles overcome the power of god in his life he was perplexed wow sometimes the prophet didn't understand what god was doing in his life that's what he said i'm perplexed i'm not sure exactly what i don't know what the next step is remember remember brother said that i don't know what the next step is he says you think you got a lot of pressure think about me millions of people are watching me as a prophet so he said it makes me in desperation the message desperation 63 right preached on that a couple months ago we're perplexed but we don't get in despair amen oh i don't want to live anymore right i don't want to go on i don't want to we got to overcome that by god's grace and we can why because we've got a treasure in our hearts amen we've got something more valuable inside of us praise god like we say in that song when we come into god's presence we're richer than all amen there it kings the treasure that we have and earth and vessels were more rich because it's heavenly riches it's eternal riches and not riches that are eaten up by moth and destroyed and corrupted by dust we've got eternal treasure church we ought to praise god that we've got such riches in our souls praise god amen amen the power of god that won't let you give up that won't let you be perplexed or despair or distressed the power of god keeps you from that amen you can even be persecuted but you know i'm never forsaken i can be cast out i can feel like all my hopes are thrown down but i'm not destroyed i'm getting back up you might have failed and the devil might have kicked you and beat you down but don't stay down praise god get up in jesus name praise god amen get up stand up praise god fight the good fight of faith that mighty man of valor get up and show the devil that you're you can take a punt and you can keep fighting praise god amen you know you seen all those boxers brother william they'll walk out with these big huge muscles that's right and then they get one punch and they're knocked out you know that's not what we want to be they all act like they're so big you just let them get hit a couple times all your strategy goes out the window they say but see we should be able to be knocked down or don't stay down don't feel bad for too long encourage yourself amen i tell you hallelujah god's going to come he's going to raise you up praise god amen get back up fight the good fight of faith praise god you are not destroyed you are not forsaken god is with him amen the lord is with you praise see i'm not trying to teach you that i'm trying to preach the gospel i mean priest means declare i'm trying to declare all your power that god has inside of you amen always paul said i'm bearing inside this load always i'm bearing about in my body the dying of jesus see as we get older our bodies get older and we're getting older in age and we realize when we may die at some point here that's actually showing the death of christ that's right see because even though we're dying we're still acting like jesus jesus knew he would die so he was obedient unto death praise god if god allows us to die we must be obedient unto death amen but still act like jesus keep the faith keep the commands of god we should say this let thy will be done not my will be done amen hallelujah as we get older always bear this about in our bodies that as i get older i i feel like i'm dying well that's what jesus did so i can be like him see we die who art like paul said i die daily we die that the life of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so we die we're dying physically right as we get older we die physically but each day we're supposed to die spiritually in order to let christ manifest himself in our flesh amen church don't you just long for someone to say i see jesus in you oh yeah yes is that just a wonderful thing when someone says i see jesus we got our we got our uh uh our septic pump this week you know because we have a we have a well and we have a septic system so we don't get we don't have city water in other words so we got to get rid of all the waste you know and so i i'd walk out there i talked to the young guy named daniel he's probably 30 or something like that and as he was leaving he's like he's like hey i just want to say i appreciate your shirt i assured all this at christ and had a cross a crown on it christ the king you know he's like oh yeah i said oh yeah praise the lord jesus give my mom a cancer around that whole spiel again you know let me know all about that i always want to be the first thing i always testify you know but i've seen my generation and i said yeah i preached the gospel he's like i knew that as soon as i saw you i there's something to write about you different i knew you were a preacher that's right and i just got a t-shirt on i got these baggy pants on i got like these shoes my hair's not combed i hope i brushed my teeth that day but all i did was smile and say hi to daniel welcome austin was smiling he said i knew from the moment i saw you jesus was on you amen that's what that dean guy said to the doctor's office too he said i knew jesus was i knew you were a christian right when i saw you so i don't know what it is they must see in other dimensions i don't see that very often just like the pastor's wife told me she said the first time i met you i knew you're going to be a preacher just a kid told my wife that i didn't know that but it's it's the power of christ it's the prophecy on our lives we have gifts in our lives and then praise god and if we could see in that other dimension we'd see them praise god and sometimes god gives us a glimpse in that dimension that's right that's right and we know this person is called for this this person's called for that god's gifted them with this faith god's gifted them with this wisdom or this knowledge or this understanding praise god amen but if we die to ourselves and we die to our sinful desires the power of christ will manifest in our lives amen now i love what brother brown says about paul i preached this years ago over in that sanctuary in the book of acts paul got to a spot where uh the coppersmith was against paul and paul actually left the city i don't remember what city it was but brother ram picks it up and says demas uh saw that paul didn't smite the man blind because he wanted to didn't jesus say i do nothing until the father shows me first bill ramsey says haven't i told you years ago with my own mother was dying laying dying would say bill what's my outcome i couldn't say nothing until god said so first and that's just what happened man can't man is a failure to begin with he's only an agent to work god's works through and god works his own will but when you see these super-duper people that always having this and that the other you better stay away from them in other words when somebody says oh i've always got the word of god i've always got a supernatural i've always got super duper faith but i said you leave that guy alone because brother adam said i couldn't even tell my mom what was going to happen if she's going to live or die because i'm waiting on god see that's why i thought the message movement that called themselves the greatest ever when they see a man say someone's going to get healed and they die i just thought that would wake them up but apparently it hasn't so i still got to send my letters something i do this summer that's i got to put that higher am i to do this but i still send those letters out i just want to say it real humbly though see we can't do anything until god says it right we know there's power laying there but god's the one who turns the faucet on and off it's when it's his time not our time we can plead for we can ask for it but it's god's determining he said see jesus himself didn't do that he said i only work as the father works he shows me what to do and then i go do it i can't do anything otherwise than that that's right and here demons saw paul a man that had a ministry like that could smite people blood yep so poor he only owned one coat and wanted timothy to bring it to him one coat but paul set the example like christ loved amen amen and one quote then why does riches and lots of money and things mean so much to people today why do big churches and big fancy buildings and big crowds why does that mean so much today because it's laodicea and people have the label to see in spirit right now notice and he had power to anybody that was contrary to what he preached he turned around and said you'd be blind for a season and the man was blind and here was the coppersmith done 10 times to him what that man done and yet got away with it demas must have thought well see that old fellow is washed up now he's lost his ministry no no he hadn't lost his ministry not at all god don't do things like that god's not an indian giver yeah notice now so see church i just want you to see that paul would have times where god would pour out his power and then times he didn't sure he would sit there perplexed and be like how is this going to work out how is the church i better get to praying right because he said i always prayed for the philippians i always pray for you colossians he'd have times where i'm perplexed what is the situation going to turn out to be but god would always direct him back to prayer amen and god would work in him mightily through his prayer life amen hallelujah and at the end of his life he said i'm ready now to be offered as a sacrifice remember church he was beheaded remember i showed you that list on wednesday night he was beheaded for the gospel he knew his time of departure was at hand but he could say i fought a good fight in other words i've given the best fight i could give god i've left it all out like we say when we play leave it all on the field you shouldn't have all this energy after the game you should leave it all in the field right that's what they that's what they tell us to do sometimes that was most time we won so much i always had extra energy we just blew out the competition but when you're fighting in the christian battle praise god give all you have praise god in church like we saw with those preachers some will fight all the way till death they'll like i'm sure those brothers confess i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed but then it was their time to go god pulled their car brother said god pulled their cart off the rack it says time to come home now angels take this car down get my servant and bring him up to heaven it's your time to come back come back home i'm home praise god i fought a good fight i finished my course i've kept the faith henceforth there's laid out for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to all them also that love is appearing praise god so paul said it works in me mightily how did it work and how did it work in him mightily through his everyday trials and battles in the good times church and the hard times that's right i like when jose sings that he's god of the mountain he's still got into that you sing it to you right here you've all seen that i like that that's what he does that's what his power is for his powers for the mountains he can feel like you're on a mountaintop i'm so close to headed but his power is also from the valley i feel so far away from god but i know he's moving in me praise god amen i know he's accomplishing something in this situation praise god i'm going to hang on to christ with all that i have amen hallelujah whether i'm perplexed i feel cast down i feel forsaken i feel stressed distressed remember the mighty men what they have they were stressed out they had a bunch of debts and they were bitter against everybody and god can take a bitter stressed out indebted individual and raise them up into a mighty man or woman that's what my god does that's what your god does amen he's got enemies to drive out church there's enemies god wants to drive out today but he needs mighty men and women that are delivered from bitterness they're delivered from their deaths they're delivered from stress that's who god wants to use today to get victories for the kingdom of god amen hallelujah and we're slowly but surely get him out of debt aren't we brother jesus slowly and there's more to come by god's grace i believe that there's more to come he's got to trust god god all we're going to do is ask god amen do everything we can do like paul i like what paul said paul said uh paul told philemon he said put onesimus's debt on my account that's a real christian right there a christian will put someone else's debt on their account so may god lead us may god help us he fought to the end church i want to look at a little bit more here i got i didn't preach the hour yet can you do that i still got eight minutes on my hour paul gives five things that if you want to be a mighty man now i'm going to speak kind of directly to the brothers but sisters don't uh uh don't go to sleep on me if i got you guys uh you can you can get a lot of insight from this as well now remember my palace was right there when he wrote this he says watch ye corinthians watch stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all things be done with charity amen we looked at that a few weeks ago right charity hopes all things charity believes all things charity endures all things the greatest of all these anointings is charity praise god is love in other words if you want to be a mighty man or a mighty woman of god we need the love of god in our hearts i love it all these you know what's the greatest commandment love the lord your god what's the whole duty of man to love god keep his commands how do i be a man do all things with love love love for jesus and love for his people so i don't want to be godly man i got one two three that's right five six seven all right i'm gonna count zion two there's eight gear godly men do these five things they watch they watch they stand fast they're brave and they're strong and they do all this with love hallelujah so brothers we don't have to wonder what are the requirements of being a man right here gotta do all these and i just had a few moments here this thought kind of came fresh to me last night to get a chance to really study this out all the way so i may preach a part four on this later but we'll see watch the body jesus said watch and pray right watch the spiritual skies now we always watch the natural sky it's gonna rain today what's gonna do but we need to watch the spiritual state that's why we watch the united states government right that's why we pray also watch for the roaring lion paul said he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and also the man in israel would be watchmen on the watchtowers so watching for enemies to come in so we need our brothers and especially husbands and dads especially we must have eyes to make sure there's no evil getting into our lives that's right as a preacher pastor i got to watch make sure no evil's getting the church yeah right that's what a man does he watches out for other people and the church said amen he takes care of other people not just himself he takes care of others second you're to stand fast paul said be unmovable in the work of the lord in other words when god has revealed his ministry for your life you just stand in it don't quit we see too many people quit and give up not in our church but other churches you think oh they believe the message for that many years and they quit and give up they don't do that anymore how come that brother's not preaching anymore he quit you gave up why would you give up we're supposed to stand fast praise god if you gain some ground if someone trusts you to be in the pulpit stay in the pulpit praise god just clean out your life amen someone trust you to give you some type of a position or some type of responsibility stand fast in that praise god husbands fathers stand fast in the work of the lord be stable right we've talked to different friends the one thing they wish they had in life was stability i'm glad we got stability here we're not going anywhere we're standing on the word of god hallelujah it's a joy to stand for jesus amen now paul said when you've done all to do with the armor of god he said do one thing just stand in other words don't sit down don't go to sleep don't give up don't be lazy don't get distracted don't be lukewarm stand be at your post of duty be ready to run amen be ready to fight this is what godly men do this is what real men do they watch they stand and they're very brave like like joshua said be thou strong and very courageous see you're brave because you met someone greater than your adversary hallelujah you're brave and situated in public situations because you've already been the presence of somebody greater than your enemy praise god that's jesus amen you fear god only you don't fear man you don't fear the boss praise god you don't fear the woman or man at the gas station you don't feel the septic system man you don't feel the electrician or the plumber you don't you don't fear them because god is with you you're very brave praise god mighty men and women and he said be strong remember satan comes to weaken you but the holy spirit's here to strengthen you amen so see just keep your mind out of anything that's satanic right which would be any sin just keep your mind out of any sin [Music] and keep your mind on the things of god and god will strengthen you praise god you won't get weaker you'll get stronger by the grace of man and then do all things in love charity can do all things how many still believe you can do all things through christ who strengthened you amen i can do it through christ i can't do it myself but i have access to power so i can do this i can do all things through christ i can be a godly man how do you believe that i'm going to go over a couple more things here i didn't get this one on the slideshow i came across this thought i heard a preacher say i'm going to go ahead and preach this if you are a man that means you're not a woman women are called by god to be followers of the man so brothers we can't be followers of our wives families or the society we've got to be leaders praise god amen we've got to say follow me because i've already been there amen i've already been there in prayer i've already seen it in the word i've already seen it in that brother's life but this brother i've already seen it follow me praise god amen that's right all right like when we go to baptize people i usually like to be the first one down there i just say follow me everybody excuse me can we remember we have this moment and we go certain places sometimes i like to be right at the front if i can because i want to lead the way i don't want there to be any confusion i don't want to be any uh misunderstanding right we want to lead because we're men we should be leaders by the grace of god we should find the leading of god for our lives hallelujah for our families for our marriages amen yes god anoints women mightily as we said we believe that priscilla woman at the well there's so many examples mary look at that she had more faith in zachariah a teenage girl had more faith than an old man a priest right he got his he got his uh his mouth became dumb he couldn't talk because he died of the angel but mary believed the angel all right teenager doesn't matter your age it matters your faith amen that's right that's what matters now peter told us in first peter 3 that brothers we must understand our wives and give honor to our wives so real man understands god made me stronger with these gifts i also have a higher calling of responsibility but i still understand them and i'm still show them honor right physically men are usually stronger than women usually there are some strong ones i saw in the olympics a few years ago i wouldn't mess with them but god gives us men here we're to understand our wives and give honor to them so men let's be men let's not be women let's act like men second man don't be a beast because bees act upon instinct and they only they only act for themselves they're so selfish yeah i watched a video of a lion one time a lion is an old male lion and he had like these numerous women uh female line lionesses and all these cubs and so the mother cubs would go out and kill the meat and then the dad would go out there and he'd eat all the good meat and then let everybody else eat the rest i thought that's not really the right example he's a beast right yeah right there's my hour i thought that's just uh that's not really the way it should go a man should get out there and do the work praise god and then he should share with everybody praise god jesus said the greatest among you is your servant but he was but that lion said i get the first i'm always first i'm always first me me me me but rap said you're third brothers god family me he said god family me you're third place right you're always going to come in third let god come in first amen that your wife and family come in second brothers you come in third amen hallelujah yeah beasts act upon instinct and beasts eat their own some animals eat their own children yeah yeah some of the moms got to protect the the babies from the decks that's beastly right right it's all about them it's all about instinct what i need right now i gotta have it right now but see when you're a real child of god you're patient praise god you don't move on your fleshly instincts you move on the will of god hey that's a real real man here now right amen strong full of charity praise god real men elite they don't act like beasts right animals are impulsive self-centered like haven't saw that horse was impulsive wasn't that horse compulsory just head butt you right there i got to have your attention right that's kind of what the horse said pet me pet me my cat's so impulsive if i'm just this week i was just pulling weeds i got my bad legs i'm kind of weeding like this you know because i can't really barely and i'm just pulling wheezing he's so impulsive he just rubs up against my arm i'm just like pulling weeds because i won't pet him but he's got to be pets so he just rubs right against me sometimes i'll be eating a meal outside he'll just jump right on my lap and i got my food right tailored come on man i'm trying to eat the food but he's a beast he's so impulsive he don't care about me and he wants to be pet he's gonna get his hair all over my food that's a beast self-centered yeah man should be not be self-centered we should be christ-centered amen amen hallelujah word-centered but remember that jesus is the center of all your thinking you should be the center of your entire life brothers that's when you're a mighty man you're strong courageous brave you're watching amen brother's still strong today amen's like yeah glory me too feeling strong today praise god third thing is don't act like a woman don't act like a beast and don't act like a boy we got a little boy in our house right now we know how he acts you don't get his way he'll hit you right we gotta i gotta smack his hands do not hit your sister and that's when you see domestic abuse which those men need to be locked in jail their domestic abuse if they're hitting someone they need to be locked up they're full of demons that's how a boy acts that's not how a man acts boys throw tantrums nothing if it don't go my way i'm not gonna throw a tantrum i'm not gonna complain i'm gonna talk to god about it lord i thought i prayed about this i thought i told you of course you told me but i'm not doing it your way i'm doing it my way amen that's what a boy does a boy complains a boy hits yeah a boy will throw a tantrum but not a man right a man will take in his try and say well god gives and god takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah amen i love it first corinthians 13 11 says when i was a child i spake as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things amen a child would do that a child is interested in that when you become a man outside this a real woman of god you put away childish things that's right things that are frivolous don't mean anything for the kingdom of god i put that away because i become a man hallelujah amen i got some amens from the brothers me close with this i saw this time i really have any clothes i got 10 minutes on my 15 minutes let me close this first chronicles 12. if you've got your bible you don't have to give me one two this is before david is king over hebron so right after saul dies remember the mighty men have already come to him but he gets as time goes on remember the memory verse he gets greater and greater right girls david wax greater and greater because who is with him who is with david so as as he was a fugitive david was he was a he was a law breaker the government was after him he was running from solace is a fatherless a fugitive remember there's that that i have to find that one in psalms he said i'm like a bird that's being hunted down i'm like a prey being shot at and i'm like a bird church he's like flying from he's he's running from cave to cave from house to house that's no way to live yet in the midst of that remember he was training up mighty men as well the church don't tell me uh you and i we should not complain if we're going through trials god can still make us mighty in the midst of ourselves there is no excuse if david can raise up 300 or 400 mighty men while running for his life what can we do amen when we're not running for any physical life we're just having mind battles or you're getting sick he was literally running for his life and still the midst of that could raise up and teach this is how your hands wore that's right this is how your fingers this is how your feet do not slip like you said last week hey man i'm not slipping every place i step is going to be exactly the right step i won't fall down the enemy won't have me on a lower position i'll stand for christ because i'm standing on christ the solid rock that's why my foot stays dead [Applause] every time i make a step it's in line with the word that's how i know my foot won't slip amen that's how i know the enemy won't defeat me because i'm stepping where the word says to step praise god so no matter what we're going through church we can be strong and we can be mighty no matter the struggle that we're going through god god is making i'm going to say like this god is making us stronger amen i was i was shaking the first rose hand god is making you more mighty amen amen he is making you more mighty right to these the ones up close he's making you more mighty amen it's just through the daily battles as you as you go against the devil as you defeat the devil you're getting stronger every single day amen every day yeah you might run from that problem you try to escape this this temptation you might be running all the time but still make time to stop and pray stop and praise the lord stop and get in this presence remember you've got a treasure in you that the kings of the earth don't have amen the treasure of his presence amen kings don't have it kings remember the kings of the earth they're going to be bird food now we appreciate that a few weeks ago they're going to be bird food that's what the mighty men that's what they turn into the worldly mighty men but not us we're going to be kings and priests unto god and we're going to rule on this earth for a thousand years praise god a thousand years ruling why because christ worked in us mightily praise god amen now in time there's a beautiful type in first chronicles 12 15 the bob said these are they that went over jordan the first month when it had overflown all his banks now notice this is hundreds of years after after joshua crossed jordan and now that time of year when it's overflowed like joshua's time had overflowed all the banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both east and toward the west and there came by the children of benjamin and judah to the hold of david now look at this these men i love the picture these men had to cross over jordan how they do it church they swam there's no other way to get over jordan they didn't have an ark by the way they had no art to step in there and when they stepped in there the waters moved back they actually had to swing yeah well god you're the same yesterday today and forever why don't you just park to jordan because that was for a different time in season i'm doing something different now i'm not bringing you in i'm establishing a king amen i'm establishing a king who's after my own heart two different times different seasons different battles i want you to see the mighty men they swam across jordan they cross over jordan on their own accord the crossing of jordan is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost see they were mighty before look they were mighty before verse uh they'd already put to fly all these all these men they've already they're just like apollos they're already mighty the word amen but they said david is coming into power david's got the same anointing in fact anointing is greater on him it's on me but i see in david i see a greater man i see a mighty man he's coming into power let's go join up with him amen so what must we do we must cross over jordan into the baptism of the holy ghost praise god hallelujah i like what david says when he goes out to meet him these brothers just swam across the mighty jordan like me they'd be dog tired no doubt about that i'm not a good swimmer i almost drowned one time and god saved my life kept me from drowning uh pulled me up out of the waters pull me out of the waters yeah i'll forget what song that lesbian david goes out to meet these men to get the baptism of the holy ghost and he says if you come peacefully unto me my heart shall be meant to you knit to you rather knit to god if you're coming in peace our hearts will be sewn together we will have one heart there it is one heart and one soul just like the book of acts amen that one heart one soul but if you become to betray me to my enemies saying there is no wrong in my hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it if you're coming to join us praise god you'll be on the right side amen but if you fight against us he says you'll be cursed god will curse you because i'm innocent of the blood of all men what a place to be in a beautiful type of christ that's right whoever blesses jesus will be blessed whoever curses jesus will be cursed amen but don't you see yourself as one of those mighty men you're able to cross over an overflowing river you're able to cross over jordan you would go to any lengths to be on david's side you'll do anything you'll come across any obstacle you'll do anything so i can be on his side i just i know that david's coming into power i want to be on david's side he's not in power now but i want to be on the side and i wanted to use me for his kingdom's sake hallelujah and what was this answer verse 15 let's stand right for you david says if you're on my side you'll be blessed but if you come against me god's going to fight against you and rebuke you i love this then the holy see shall they cross jordan then the holy ghost comes on them see it the perfect day a perfect time in other words before you get the holy ghost jesus is going to say which side are you going to be on right just like cadence barney is that right brother gloria when it came to kadesh barnea they he still asked which side are you going to be on do you really want to go in the back to some holy ghost and fight these giants do you really want to go against that and these these men were so dedicated they're mighty men they fought many battles they killed many enemies many foes they defeated armies but they're able to swim across on their own they're able to cross over jordan and the holy ghost comes upon a messiah he was the chief he says we are yours david oh jesus i belong to you amen my whole life is yours amen i don't owe myself jesus owns me he bought me he purchased me amen with his own blood amen amen i'm willing to cross over jordan amen because i belong to jesus amen can i say this my body spirit and soul belong to you jesus amen amen that's what mighty men do that's what mighty women do amen they cross over jordan into the baptism of the holy ghost and they say i'm all yours jesus i'm on your side i will not be on the left side i won't be on the right side politically i'll be on jesus's side amen praise god i will be on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace the unto thee and peace be to thy helpers in other words for us is like bless you jesus blessings upon you blessings upon your people amen for thy god helpeth thee for you are god amen amen and god has given you all power and authority in heaven and earth amen amen then david received them and made them captain
