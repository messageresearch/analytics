TRANSCRIPT
========================================
32 chapter 32. just take another service just to try to encourage us and raise our faith i'd like to look at uh guided by the eye of god today guided by the eye of god psalm 32 verse 7. wednesday the power went out and i couldn't quite all day i just couldn't quite get a sermon and it was the only sermon i ever preached without any notes really i didn't put it on youtube yet but if you want to do that i could i just kind of forgot i was working on other things i was working on naomi's podcast and my other videos you know um but if you wanted to if you would like if you like that motherboard let me know after service okay it would just take five minutes um but yeah i just really felt encouraged you know wednesday and uh i just you know i felt about yesterday i was listening to different servers i listened to leadership communion and then i've seen this sermon pop up from brother branham called god's eye i never listened to it before it's in 1958 and it was just he preached for 10 minutes and then he prayed for the sick for an hour and that's where i got the inspiration for this thought like wow what a i never i've never seen that title before god's eye then i looked at the scripture and the scripture was this it was psalms 32. so i just want to preach on that thought just a room it's just an encouraging thought that god's eye's always on i just want you to know that church as we go through battles and struggles and losses and gains whatever we go through god's eyes on you amen psalm 32 verse 7. beautiful scripture there in verse 7 as well i mean verse 8 is where we want to get to but verse 7 was beautiful too if you need a place to hide you can hide in christ i'll read verse 7 then we can all read verse 8 together verse 7 says thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance how many surrounded by all these songs of victory phrase amen songs of deliverance c-lock of course that means pause usually for meditation right you pause and let me think about that tells the musician this is where you pause you emphasize that those words right there then verse eight let's read verse eight together ready one two three i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with my eye amen let's have a word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's just make it on unto god we're all in need of the living god the almighty god i need him i know you do too and we surely need his grace during these seasons of loss these difficult times we just need god's grace his love heavenly father lord my hands are raised to you lord god my eyes are closed father i'm just praying in all sincerity lord we love you lord there's no one nowhere else we'd rather be lord than with your people and in your presence there's no one else we'd rather talk to than you lord god for lord you are our help it is vain it's foolish to trust in man lord for we're trusting in the living god the god who sees all the god who knows all as a father we're putting our trust in you today a fresh lord god thank you then you guide us with your eye lord god we know you're watching us and we know your eyes on the sparrow lord god we know the hairs of our head are numbered we know lord god you care about us we can't even count the number of thoughts you have towards us so father god we ask the lord in your mercy you bless us here in your divine presence speak to us here today and meet all the needs of the saints be with our sister who again lord thank you uh for her faithful god also sister nina at home streaming god i just pray god you speak to them bless them in jesus christ's name everybody says amen god bless you to being seated praise god so i'd like to look at this thought on uh guided by god's eye or again not really a teaching service right more of a preaching service and i've kind of been doing a few more of those preaching services lately so i hope this will be a blessing to you i'm going to start with the quote you know this this few minutes where brother begins his sermon on god's eye he's from chattanooga tennessee he said i love that david is speaking that god is his hiding place how i love to think that we have a hiding place that god's great presence can be our hiding place where we can hide from the things of the world when trouble arrives he's our hiding place hallelujah then he reads i will guide you with mine i he said i was thinking here god was speaking there how god would guide us with his eye and to know that his presence is ever near and he does guide us and i was thinking how becoming that scripture is to the true servant of christ in john 15 verse 9 jesus says verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing the son doeth likewise so jesus did nothing until he saw the father do it first and there's a there's a beautiful picture there i'll guide you with my eye that beautiful so this this thought of god's eye guiding us is is god giving us his eyesight it's god giving us his perfect will it's god giving us the direction that we must go because jesus says i can do nothing except i see the father do it first that's right i can't do anything i can't i can't do anything unless god shows me what to do first so in other words i need god's eyes i need god's vision in order to know what to do amen beautiful thought there beautiful thought brother brown fix it up there he says the great eye of jehovah jesus was looking through his eyes so now we get the thought of how god will bring us behind the veil right it brings behind the veil and we get to look and see things through god's perspective amen that's what i love about the bible you know god gives us 66 books of the scripture written by uh i think there's 40 authors if i'm not mistaken brown 40 authors written over the course of almost 1500 years uh you know we got six six six thousand years of human history to date but it was all written kind of in the same amount of time within the with the same 1500 years from moses you know to john and with each with each book we get to see god's perspective on someone's life right we get to i love we get to see god's perspective on job's life especially with that you get to go up to heaven and see what's going on in heaven hallelujah you get to see uh the perspective on david's life which is one of the largest compilations of a person's life in the bible just all those chapters just full of all these details of a man's life and i love it you get god's perspective on the life of christ hallelujah and you get god's perspective on all the abraham you get this huge chunk on abraham this huge chunk on joseph's life and i think god does it because it's is this he's giving us the opportunity to step behind his and and come into his mind i'll say it like that amen god gives us an opportunity to bring us into the mind of christ and we get to see someone else's uh life through god's eye through god's eyesight and it's a beautiful picture he says the great eye of jehovah jesus was looking through his eyes it must have been jehovah's eyes he was looking through when simon or peter come up and he told him his name was simon and he was going to change it to cephas or peter and he told him his father's name was jonah it just had to be god's eye that he was looking through so think about that before jesus talks you know to peter it's as if it's as if god put jesus behind his eyes and so jesus could see peter through god's eyes amen praise god so i'll just say like this when brother amen came to our service as if it's as if god uh god let me see him through his eyes and i preach exactly what brother amen needed to hear amen praise god in other words any time you were led by the holy spirit you were looking through god's eyes amen amen why did you choose to do this in a certain situation why did that why did i preach that why we're not a denomination why is god against organized religion why did i preach that i was looking through god's eyes and i didn't even realize it didn't even realize it amen any time god led you because remember they that are led by the holy spirit are the sons and daughters of god amen so anytime god leads you to do something maybe stranger maybe maybe you absolutely know this is god leading me to do this you might do that or you might not know many times as preachers we don't i don't know many times the needs i'm addressing i don't know it uh but i guess i guess when i woke up in the morning brother william you know on the certain days when god would use me like that i was looking through his eyes and not mine i would see these scriptures in a way i've never seen them before but i was looking through god's eyes when god led banging to fly over there to get sister sia right that was he's looking through god's eyes now to a natural man that's a huge it's a huge sacrifice flying cross across the oceans you know and trying to get a little bride you know all the way fly all the way there make all these sacrifices go through all these huge steps you know it's as if god brought you into his mind and you see the outcome you see what's going to happen but you see it through god's eyes that's right and you don't see it the way other people other people tell you do this or no don't do that now you shouldn't do that but for some reason you just see it the way god sees it praise god amen hallelujah he brought you back and into his mind and and he let you look with a with an eternal vision amen he let you look with an eternal perspective that's what hattie wright got amen i think when brother adam said just say whatever you want say what's your greatest desire she looked through god's eyes and saw you know farming on a hill for 20 a year that's awful but that's not the most important thing the most important thing is the salvation of those two souls so when she was given the opportunity to speak anything she wanted when she speaks she spoke the most valuable thing that because god saw the most valuable thing is souls that are saved rescued from hell and given eternal life amen amen glory so she got to step behind the mind of god and look through god's eyes and see what's most important money or souls souls praise god amen what a beautiful dog but ram said god's eye has been with the prophets through the ages that could see ahead of time what was going to happen like brother told us about russia right and the uh bomb on the vatican we know what's going to happen we know some of the nations that are going to do it praise god we know the mark of the beast is going to come out of the united states a lot of people don't understand that they think the u.s will be the savior of the world or uh the u.s will rescue it's actually gonna be the opposite the u.s is gonna bring the it's the beast out of the land it's gonna bring everybody down but god has shown us through the eyes of the prophets he said it could have been nothing else but god's eye when nathanael was brought by philip into his presence and jesus said behold an israelite in whom there's no guile amen and he said how do you know me rabbi he said when you were under the fig tree i saw you praise god there it is again jesus saw use the god's eyes the eyesight of god to see where he was he said it must have been god's eye that he was looking through oh my god help us to look through his eyes today praise god amen let's look through god's eyes let's look through god's perspective about situations today each one of us he said it must have been god's eye in john 4 when he seen the woman had five husbands but see jesus didn't see that jesus saw a redeemed woman who would later run into the city praise god amen he didn't see just the woman carrying the water pot at the hot time of the day when the prostitutes came out jesus looked past that praise god amen he saw he didn't see the blackness of her soul he saw the part of her soul that god's light would shine upon the part that would receive faith for by grace she was saved through faith amen jesus didn't see the part that had you know the sixth husband there living there and she's living in shame jesus didn't see that jesus said saw the woman that would move out praise god amen and live a separated life and go and sin no more amen amen he must have seen that praise god it was god's eye when he was looking down through he says and when the woman touches garment and virtue had gone from him and then he looked over the audience until he found the woman and knew what her trouble was so he was looking through god's eyes i said like that she was looking through god's eyes the bible said she said i know if i can just touch the heaven of his garment i'll be made whole praise god amen that was god's eyes amen amen no other you know a human thought wouldn't do that or if i could just touch if i can just touch him if i can just touch i know i'll be made well that was god's thinking that was god's way that she was going to be healed she was led to do that praise god amen may god lead us to our healing may god lead us to see our loved ones save amen god lead us for our children to be born again praise god how did it make god lead us into these desires may we see god's eyes through it praise god let's see what god wants to happen praise god amen amen that's what led jesus in all these situations we find the scripture but ram said it could not it been nothing else but through god's eye when jesus perceived the thoughts in the pharisees heart when they said here be else above so even then he was looking through the eyes of god it was god's eye that was looking through him when he perceived the thoughts of the disciples when they were saying who would be the greatest among them now is that something so church when we you know as we preach all that we've looked at the eyes of uh so he looked at the preachers that i'm calling themselves the greatest of all time on the tape side and on the five-fold side they're both sides saying they're the greatest of all time and uh i got more to say on that later maybe i'll say it at the end i don't want to be on the live stream but i appreciate i appreciate the different emails i've got on that but see it was jesus perceiving jesus was looking through god's eyes and their argues greater and he goes up and gets a child and sets it in the midst of them and says you got to become like this child if you want to be great grown men strong men men with miracles a man that walked on water you know all these these great men and jesus says no you shouldn't do that you shouldn't exalt yourselves you should humble yourselves that's what god's eyes do when you look through god's eyes you see how little you are amen but that's what that's what that's actually the battle the message is facing today we're the greatest of all time so sad it was god's eye that jesus was looking through when he went down into the pool bethesda and looked around to find a man on a pallet and knew he'd been in that condition for 38 years old he offered him healing praise 38 years think about that hey now look at that abraham waited 25 years but here's a seat of abraham who waited 38 years amen hallelujah so let's be encouraged praise god let's keep waving let's keep believing let's look through god's eyes and not our human eyes amen amen he said okay now he gets on some other things he says and that guiding eye wasn't to be gone at the going of the lord jesus he was to continue forever in his church and when he rose on the third day and sent it on high he sent the holy spirit back to the church and tonight the church looks through the same guiding eye that guides his people into all truth because he is the truth amen oh don't you love that get your bible let's go to john 16 13 here i'll just read that because that's one of the main scriptures brother i use [Music] actually let's look at verse 12 now this is a great uh scripture to keep us humble as well this is how we know the rapture will come at the right time in season it won't be one minute late and the rapture uh is not going to be early it's not going to be late we didn't miss it praise god it'll be right at the right time look at verse 12 16 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now now here we get some this ought to humble us in other words if we don't understand something it's because we can't handle it yet praise god in other words god's going to reveal it in the right time in season god knows what we can handle god knows what we can deal with right god knows what we need so he's not going to give us something before we need it praise god verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things have come i'm sorry things to come brother sorry it's hard for me to talk with these things in my mouth there so forgive me verse 14 he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and shall show it unto you amen that's how we know the holy spirit is speaking to us when it glorifies christ amen it won't lift up brother branham it won't lift up me it won't lift up any person that you uh uh you know you admire it'll always magnify jesus christ praise god that's the holy spirit's job amen but see all truth the holy spirit is a god remember i said now that jesus is gone he said the holy spirit is here so you can have the guide with you amen amen and it guides you to all truth he said how happy we are to know that the scriptures cannot be broken and know that the same eye that will guide us is in our presence tonight and we are in its presence tonight that shall guide us from sickness unto health amen that shall guide us from our affliction to the cross that will guide us from our affliction to good health that will guide us from a sinful life to a satan set aside life in god that presence is ever near amen amen so the presence of god is here and it draws us from sickness to life uh from depression to hope praise god hallelujah from poverty to plenty praise god it draws us out of our awful condition it gives us hope it gives us strength and it helps us to see it in advance praise god for the spirit of jesus is the spirit of prophecy amen amen in other words something will just strike in your heart i know i'm going to get better i know god's going to change the situation amen i know god is going to change someone's soul i know god is going to change someone's heart someone's thinking i know god's going to change my life i know god's going to do it that's the spirit a prophecy that's the spirit of jesus you're getting god's eyesight amen like the best is yet to come amen hallelujah praise god that's the scripture praise god the best is yet to come jesus said lo i'm with you always even to the end of the world and we're nearing the end as jesus confirmed that guiding eye being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the jews before the ending of that church age for the jews he manifested it by looking through the eye of god so jesus manifested god by looking through god's eye and that's how we'll manifest christ to the world by looking through god's eye through our lives right trusting god looking at looking through god's eye what is god's word in other words it's like looking through god's glasses right these are like god's glasses you put these on and you look at your life you look at every situation through god's perspective on it and then you look with god's eyes how do you believe that by god's grace amen amen amen brother said at calvary everything was finished he was wounded for our transgressions with his strikes we were healed every sinner tonight here was saved when jesus died at calvary every sick person was healed when jesus died at calvary he finished the work the only thing that god can do now is anoint ministers to preach the word and set gifts in the church to point you to the finished work of the lord jesus may god grant it tonight is my prayer brother and i said that's basically this whole sermon on god's eye right there beautiful beautiful uh topic there now let's go back to psalm 32 that's where i want to start i want to see i want you to see the inspiration where i kind of got this from let's go to verse 1 here 32 1. i want to read the whole chapter it's a very short chapter only 11 verses when i get a chapter like that my morning reading i'll read two chapters because that's so short you know i think this morning's chapter is about 60 some verses i'm in the book of lamentations now um that's quite a book there and my chapter this morning was uh the chapter i think it's chapter three lamentations where the bible said god's mercies are renewed every morning amen real encouragement to me you know remember in lamentations that was jeremiah he was lamenting over israel because their city was being destroyed uh the belief the jews i'm not sure if i should say believers many of them were not the jews were being scattered around the world and god said it's because of your rebellion and god was chasing them because they forgot the priest and forgotten god the prophets had prophesied falsely and yet in the midst of all that jeremiah knew god is going to bring them back eventually praise god amen and he said yet despite all our rebellion and our idolatry despite all these things god's mercies are renewed every single morning amen amen in other words god was looking for someone to repent every single day in other words right we'll read that after this let's read psalms 32. a psalm of david mage chill and i don't know if i'm saying that right mass chill i don't know but that word means to instruct so so david is saying this is a song to instruct us in other words god wants us to do this chapter that's right praise god here's a song and it teaches you how to do something let's look at it praise god because it's a beautiful beautiful chapter blessed is he who's trans transgression sorry it's forgiven whose sin is covered how many can say amen to that amen i thought i'd hear a few more amens on that one let's try it again blessed is huge transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered all right thank you that made me feel good praise god blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputed thy iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile we could say amen to all these verses you really don't have the same hand album but i don't want you to see that we're forgiven church amen amen when we trust in jesus christ if you repent and are baptized you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that is god's unfailing promise look through god's eyes today see that promise through god's eyes and it will come to pass hallelujah amen amen when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all day long for day and night my hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer so i used to feel all all moistury i used to have all this life but now i feel dried up now isn't this the same man that said in chapter 23 my cup's running over hallelujah sometimes you come to church i feel like oh i got so much love i've got joy like a fountain praise god it's overflowing and then sometimes i feel like i've all dried up i have nothing to give god i could hardly sing a song to god today don't feel bad at church david went through that too and if david could be a man after god's own heart so can you amend you're dry sometimes you're overflowing by the praises just flowing it's a joy and everything is feels like it's it's going well and god's blessing every single thing you do so it seems right but then there's times god takes you through dry season seasoning and this is to what this is to instruct us in other words we're to learn from this chapter how to behave verse oh then there's selah so pause take a pause we kind of did actually pause now look at this here now here's the instruction i acknowledge my sin unto thee so always tell god your sin amen and my iniquity have i not hid i love this you don't hide your sin but then when troubles come you can hide in christ we get this idea of hiding you know we don't we don't want to hide anything from god but we want to hide in god hallelujah we want a hiding place in god in the presence of god and i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin say lost there's another meditation just stop there meditate pause see if you confess i love that god is faithful to cleanse you from all righteousness amen that good question was last sunday night you know did god forgive all every single one god forgave every single one amen when you repent you get baptized that's saying forgive me of all my sins even if i forgot to confess it no doubt you no doubt when you accepted jesus you wanted forgiven from every sin anyway praise god amen that's the understanding he's not going to forgive you of 99 percent of your sins amen he's going to forgive you of 100 of them amen that's the whole idea of praise god that's why you can be saved that's why he said repent and be saved hallelujah he that believeth uh i'm sorry he that repented uh believe us shall be baptized praise god he that believeth not shall be damned that's the whole point of being saved is you're forgiven of all your iniquities praise god he forgiveth all thy iniquities healeth all thy diseases praise god amen [Music] verse six for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in the time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him amen so we'll see where the enemy comes in like a flood i just thought it tied together perfectly when the enemy comes in like a flood it will only come so far amen hallelujah it will not overthrow you you will not drown in the flood hallelujah amen this will not be the end of you the flood's going to come in but god is going to raise up a standard against the flood amen amen in other words literally god is going to give me a rallying point here god's going to place me on a higher place i won't be a part of the flood i won't sink i won't drown he'll give me a higher place he'll raise me up higher that'll lift me up he'll protect me i'll rally with his spirit praise god amen yes it's gonna flood but yes he has a higher place for you and i praise god amen higher than amen a higher elevation praise god we don't have to sink in the flood praise god we don't have to drown we don't want to be lost we can be saved praise god he has a higher place run to the higher place amen reminds me of the hill the lord who shall ascend to the hill o lord those who've done righteously those who've kept my word those who trust in god that's what that reminds me of amen floods are going to come we just got to get used to that now thank god we live in a place where there's not many floods ohio doesn't have any floods i think there are some states actually going through some flooding right now i can't think of the state but uh there's been numerous floods over this summer i know colorado had some floods this summer unexpected houses getting carried down the street you know cars getting carried down into the flood awful but the bible says he's the enemy's going to come like a flood but god is going to provide us a hiding place so verse seven where's our hiding place everybody say thou ready david says thou art my hiding place when thou shalt preserve me i'm sorry thou shalt preserve me from trouble you will praise god when everything's surrounding me when uh the obstacle or the trial looks insurmountable like a flood i've got a place i can run to i've got a hiding place he will preserve my life praise god he's got he's already got a place he's already provided a place for me amen right like you know you've got you've got your safety plan in place you know you know what to do if there's a tornado you know what to do there's a uh something something awful right you've got a safety plan well god's got a better safety plan for you you hide in his spirit praise god you hide in his presence hallelujah he'll preserve your life he will protect your life amen [Music] thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance so god in other words god knows the floods are coming but he's got a place for you to hide and then he's got songs he's going to give you songs that saying as a testimony that he protected you praise god amen hallelujah praise god i love it and this whole time what is it it's building your faith it's bringing you to maturity in christ jesus amen you're never going to get rid of the floods you just got to understand well i've got a place to go when the floods come i've got a hiding place i can get away from the flood praise god i don't i don't have to let the flood discourage me i don't want to have to overwhelm me i've got a place i can go to that's right amen and then he's going to give me songs to sing about praise god songs of deliverance because remember church that's what that's what paul said in ephesians chapter five he said do not be drunk online which leads to excess he said but instead be filled with the spirit amen and then what does he say right after that singing songs singing hymns making a melody in your heart for the lord so the fact that a believer can sing when there's floods around the fact that the believer can rejoice and sing about being delivered the fact you can sing shows god's spirit is flowing upon you praise god all right the fact you can sing songs of deliverance shows the anointing is on you praise god amen it shows you are in the hiding place amen you wouldn't sing those songs if you weren't in the hiding place but the fact you're singing those songs of deliverance shows you're trusting in the hiding place you've gone where god told you to go praise god amen god help me god help all of us i'm not preaching at you i'm preaching with you i need this servant too praise god i don't look through god's eyes on things and not my perspective so think on that one look at this wow that's like the third say la already in the chapter verse eight's where our the main text this for this thought was guided by god's eye i will instruct this remember this is the whole point of this chapter is to instruct us so in other words don't hide your sin from god right always confess all your sin and then when trouble comes in you go hide in god that's right amen so don't hide anything from god and then when troubles come hide in god i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go okay so we all want to walk on the right path we all want to walk on the narrow road god said i'm going to teach you how to walk on that road i'm going to show you which is the right way in your life praise god this is a song for the redeemed praise god amen i imagine you know i imagine when we're hiding in christ that's what i'll tell us you need to go this way imagine when we're hiding in there with that communion with christ that's what it'll tell us you need to go this way see it's right in the midst of trials many times that's where god will show us the next step for our lives in the midst of those trials in the midst of the flood well i know i can't do this way it seems like the lord is leading me this way because i'm in the midst of the trial i'm hiding in him amen and while i'm hiding with him he's giving me instruction glory in that in that sweet communion with god he's guiding me showing me this is the way i need to walk [Music] because there's going to be more floods coming praise god the floods are going to keep coming brother women have the floods ever stopped when you hit 50 the the the trial stop coming no okay i'm 40 the trolls have kept coming he's 70. so we got our two oldest daughters our assistant is too we all go through these trials where floods come in floods blood flood we have a choice we can try to take on the flood ourselves now how good are we going to do on that right right with all your sandbags how much fun are you going to stop with your sandbag wall but god said don't try to do that just run the righteous run into the tower the name of god is a mighty tower run into it be safe amen amen hide in christ i will instruct thee and teach you the way which thou shalt go i will guide you with mine i let's finish the chapter then i want to just switch over there to lamentations real quick verse 9 be not as the horse where's the mule so you see he brings out these animals right that need to betray now if anyone knows about horses i could call on some people not here to help me out i got some my kids work with horses be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding so there's a certain part about a horse that doesn't it's very emotional right but it doesn't have the same human understanding right because they'll nip you they'll bite you right he says whose mouse must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee so you've got to control them right you got to control them the bible says our mouths need a bridle too actually james chapter 2 amen right but here let's learn from the mule and the horse they need a bridle in their mouth or else they're coming they're going to bite you they're going to do something to you they're going to hurt you verse 10 many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusts in the lord mercy shall compass him about so look you're going to become us about with songs and you're going to encompass them out with mercy praise god so you've got psalms all around songs of deliverance and you've got god's mercy all around you praise god amen amen so see now the bible doesn't say no the flood came in right the flood came in no doubt that surrounds you but really you're looking at what's spiritually surrounding you amen may god help us to see what's spiritually surrounding us not the natural the natural will be there but god when you hide in god i want you to focus on what is spiritually surrounding me it may feel like i'm surrounded but i'm surrounded by christ amen it may be like i'm surrounded by floods but i'm surrounded by songs of mercy praise god amen amen so we see we have to look and see what's what's surrounding us spiritually we can't let frustration we can't let fear uh grieve we can't let any of these things surround us we've got to be surrounded with songs of deliverance that's right that's right with god's mercy verse 11 be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all that are upright in heart so you've got songs of deliverance you're surrounded by mercy and church we've got to have a shot of joy praise god see that shout for joy be glad in the lord be thankful you've got a hiding place amen amen i know some shots are gonna be louder than others right many times it's easier to shout than other times but this is to instruct us is it not this is to show us i will guide you in the way i'm your hiding place run to me i'll surround you with mercy i'll surround you with songs praise god amen i'll give you a shout of joy praise god be glad in the lord be glad you have a a hiding place uh be glad you have communion with me be glad that i'll show you the way to go amen let's go to lamentations after jeremiah lamentation i'm sorry it's lamentations uh yeah you're my limitation sorry chapter three lamentation chapter three now look at verse one and two i am the man that has set affliction by the rod of his wrath now look he had led me and brought me into darkness but not into light now jeremiah is talking about the natural things that he sees israel being taken into captivity right the kings disobeying god's word now look he said god led me here isn't this something because the majority of jews were disobedient jeremiah was not jeremiah was faithful but because god deals with israel as nation he's led with them look lead right lend in other words god's eyes saw beforehand that jeremiah was going to have to go through this with the people because they were disobedient and god even raised up jeremiah from his mother's womb to be a prophet amen and to speak to them praise god and to not fear their faces don't look at their faces just preach the word amen so jeremiah has led with a lot of unbelievers jews into an awful situation and there's five chapters of lamentation but every now and then you see a glimmer of hope we're going to go through difficult times there's floods that are going to come through right we just seen it but we have a choice we can either try to get through ourselves or we can run to christ and hide in jesus amen amen look at verse 21. actually um look at verse 18 let's go to 18. and i said my strength and my hope is perish from the lord so look he felt like he had no more hope in church that's how we all feel we're all human and the church said we all feel like that there's certain situations ah it's hopeless we all feel like that jeremiah was no different verse 19 remembering my affliction and my misery the wormwood and the god now look at that fortunate miseries he's miserable and yet this is the same man that said fire shut up in my bones right in a prison he said i'm done preaching for jesus or i'm done preaching for christ the anointing right i'm done preaching for jehovah but then he said something rose up a fire in his bones and said i cannot stop it's like fire my bones peter the price of god is in my life i've got a calling i've got to fulfill god's will praise god amen but then there was times when he felt like quitting there were times he felt miserable as a believer verse 20 my soul hath then still in remembrance and is humbled in me so i still remember the miserable times i still remember the afflictions look at verse 21 this i recall to mind therefore have i hope amen amen see church we can remember the hard times but we also the holy spirit will help us remember the good times because that's looking through god's eyes amen looking through our eyes we'll see affliction miserable wormwood all these difficult feelings that we go through the struggles of it but then i'll also remember i can look through god's eyes and see his mercy hallelujah amen amen verse 22 is what i'm going to recall to mind your mindset i'm going to remember this it is of the lord's mercies that were not consumed because his compassions failed now glory israel deserves every spanking they got let me give you a clue so you and i so do i deserve every spanking i get right like that first i shared with brother amen last week it was uh or two weeks ago if you go to proverbs we're not gonna go there now but god says there are six things i hate seven things are abomination one of them is a pro a prideful look at church let's be honest we've all looked sometimes at christian groups and thought well they're so dirty look how thank god i'm not them right that's an abomination in the bible the bible says a proud look is an abomination and we knew better we just forgotten where god brought us from christ we forgot the my replay god hadn't pulled us out of it right that's an abomination to have a proud look well i'm better i'm not in their situation because i'm just wise i just got more of the holy ghost now that might be true you might you might have more of the holy ghost but let's not take a pride attitude about it praise god that'll bring a flood on your life see so jeremiah is looking at the positive now lord you know he he thought about oh god led me to dark times and i remember my misery i mean all i can think of is this wormwood but i also remember the reason i'm alive is because god has had mercy on me amen amen right it's the lord's mercies that were not dead hallelujah because his compassions failed out amen oh god is a compassionate loving god amen amen we just get confused sometimes with human compassion and divine compassion right we all get confused with that but the same god who gives is the same god who takes away that's right right the same god who uh gives sunlight is the same guy who gets darkness praise god the same god we've got to be thankful gotta look through god's eyes there's times there's seasons but his compassions have never failed us one time show me once when his compassions fail something bad happened but wasn't somebody good to you afterwards right something bad happened but wasn't there some silver lining on it as we saw on wednesday night there's some silver lighting always there's always the fact that god's compassions fail not god is always doing something with this amen verse 23 they are new every morning great is my favorite that's it that's where we get that song crazy hallelujah every morning because we're not consumed god has had compassion on us verse 24 the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore i will hope in him amen see the jews were seeing all their lands taken away by captivity right they're taking all these the uh babylon was taking over assyria taking over but jeremiah saw everybody lose another land but jeremiah said that's fine god is my portion amen amen hallelujah and church that's your portion of day too amen heaven the holy spirit oh yes therefore that gives me some hope amen if i lose everything done here as long as i get a portion of jesus i'll be happy with that praise god he's my fortune amen verse 25 the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him so waiting and seeking some of the hardest things to do as christians and the church said amen waiting right waiting and then seeking spending extra time seeking god right but god is with you god is good to you when you do that in other words you'll you'll reap the benefits that's good planting right you've sown so you'll harvest good things the lord is good to them that way to the soul that seek him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord amen hope for expect it praise god amen in other words my victory's coming my battle is going to be over someday one day that answer is coming by god's grace hallelujah one day my faith shall become sights one day that promise will be fulfilled hallelujah you might as well use our example from this year awesome our faith of prayers has become sight amen very sins right praise god faith shall become science praise god god keeps his word amen he's good to those that wait to wait for him he said hope and quietly wait for the salvation of god amen i'll stop right there by god's grace does that help by god's grace that was my chapter this morning i'm working my way through the old testament i got the new testament done working my way through the old testament i thought well that's perfect for today just god's mercies that were not consumed right hallelujah now i want to look uh before looking at some other scriptures i want to look uh let's look at the human eye we'll look at the miracle of the human eye for a moment this is a article online i found you know because if you if you see the uh if you see the design of the human eye it helps you appreciate god the designer right but then it gives you a perspective on god's eyes if our eyes are this good how good are god's eyes hallelujah here's how the eye works let's start with that because this is a little shorter all the different parts of the eye work together to help you see first light passes through the cornea that's that front layer on the eye it's shaped like a dome and bends lights to help the eye focus that cornea bends the light you've already got a light bending tool on the very front of your eye bends the light it's helping focus you can't focus without that cornea some of the light enters the eye through the opening called the pupil that's that the darkest spot of your eyelid i think that's the apple of my apple the i2 people say the bible says god's going to set us as the apple of his eye amen and the iris uh is the colored part controls how much light the pupil left in and next light passes through the lens the lens work together with the cornea to focus light correctly on the retina when light hits the retina special cells called photoreceptors turn light into electrical signals i just said something there that i don't understand there's certain cells in the eye that absorb light and change and transfer into electric signal it's beyond my i got my comprehension then these electric signals travel from the retina through the optic nerve into the brain then the brain turns the signals into the images you see and that's the really shortened version of it it's way more difficult than that i think there's like it flips the picture and something like that the eye just like a camera you know the eye is an amazing thing and then you gotta have tears to make your eyes work correctly see why god has to break our heart sometimes make us cry you gotta have tears keep your eyes working the right way now what's amazing church is the eye has over 130 million photo detectors catches the light that gets through 130 million in each eye it's 260 million 260 million souls ourselves rather than souls cells that catch light and instantly in a matter of a matter of milliseconds take that light and convert it into electric signal and send it into your brain so then you can see what what's what's coming in 260 million at one time now an article i read says that uh the the person who invented the the camera they tried different things and they got the best design from the human eye and so all these cameras in our phones and my phone's up there all these cameras are all based upon the human eye see man doesn't come up with nothing himself he always steals it from god that's right there you have it borrows it from god so man each one of you have 260 million photoreceptors guess how many photoreceptors in a regular camera 265. to your phone you think oh let me take a good selfie here here come here buddy let's take a selfie sign that's a pretty good picture that's nothing compared to what god does through your eyes every single second amen that's 265 photoreceptors instantly converted but your eyes actually faster than that right we'll get the picture it'll process for a second and then you look at the picture oh that's pretty nice god is way faster than that did you know charles darwin described the i was the greatest challenge to his theory of evolution you know the eye the human eye where you guys talk about that how can he explain it after the after all the eye is simply incompatible with evolution he said quote to suppose that the i with all of its inimitable contrivances i can't say something's worth could have been formed by natural selection scenes i freely confess absurd in the highest degree he wrote that in 1909. that's your brother was born oh he had the eyes of god he was he was the seer hallelujah so even he said it's absurd to think the i could evolve didn't jesus christ say the eye is the lamp of the body the eye is the lamp it brings the light right allows you to catch the light and uh scientists say the human eye is even more sharp eye than any other eye of all the animals remember some of those spiders they got lots of eyes don't they there's all kinds of different eyes but ours would be the greatest eyes human eyes discriminate fine detail and it's incomparable with any other eye out there the and now let's go back to these uh these signals so remember the cells catch these signals these signals these like electric signals travel at a rate of a billion per second to the brain a billion per second a billion none of us can understand that number a billion electrical uh data points flow right to your brain in a second a billion so the problem for darwin is how can so many intricate components and remember these these nerves are they're microscopic yeah 130 million in your eye they're just typing how does that evolve 130 minutes darwin said he thought when things got smaller they got less intricate but the exact opposite is true the smaller you look down at cells the smaller you look down at dna the more intricate it gets amen remember the dna strand if you typed out the code of dna strand i think it reached to the moon and back and put on paper 15 times i think was the if i'm remembering right that's just one cell all the information in dna this is the book of life praise god amen you've got a book of life and everyone here sells praise god but thank god your name is book of life that's the book that's most important praise god amen but god put a book of life inside of your natural life your body if one single component out of all these parts we talked about cornea retina poop pupil if one component didn't work you couldn't see nothing would work at all if the slightest thing goes wrong the cornea gets fuzzy the pupil fails to dilate the lens becomes opaque the focusing goes wrong then and recognizable image is not formed either it functions as a whole or not at all so how can all those millions and millions of cells all form just randomly like they just they just happened no they were designed there perfectly all 130 million can you imagine god packing all those sensors into that cell see that's what the bible says when you were born in your womb god was forming you praise god he was placed imagine he's placing all those 130 million just around the around the circle of your eyelid or circle on the inside circle of your eyeball praise god so you can see so you can see today as you can see the flowers you can see the sky you can see the sun you can see that nice dessert right there you can see your nice lunch and supper so you can see your mom's smiling face praise god god gave you this eyesight so you know god you're looking through natural eyes but today god wants you to look through his eyes amen thank god for the natural eyes but god is showing us all these amazing facts so we'll look through his eyes amen proverbs 20 verse 12. people are darcasia the bible says the hearing ear and the seeing eye there's another sermon i gotta get i gotta get to the hearing here maybe next time we'll see the hearing here the seeing eye the lord hath made them both see god god takes specific credit i'm the one that made the eye because nobody else could even get close man if you get 256 receptors god gets 130 million in a tiny little space and then can can transfer those in and uh and decode all those signals in a billion in one second how we love the lord praise god amen amen psalm 94 verse 9. psalm 94 verse 9. he who planted the ear shall he not hear he who form the eye shall he not see so we see god made both and god formed the eye god his sight praise god one british science physicist wrote this in 1980 the year i was born we must go further than this and admit that the only acceptable alternative is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as indeed it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it so even an atheist says we've got to accept that some higher power created the eyeball that was in 1980 41 42 years ago when i was born and darwin admitted it in 1909 over 130 some years ago just looking at the human eye alone should cause someone to know god is a creator amen if god lets me see with these eyes how much more could i see with his eyes i'm talking about my life much more can i look at my life through god's eyes and then i would know that god is guiding my life amen god led like brother also said god led him out to arizona although it didn't seem like it right maybe to us god let him out there because there was nean out there right god will lead certain things of our life we don't understand why we just feel like we got to do it it's god leading us because he sees the beginning from the end that's right glory much more could be said remember second chronicles 16 verse nine i'll try to close up here give me ten minutes here by god's grace boys for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him i've read this over the last few months here so let's look at that again second chronicles 69. god's eyes run to and fro to show himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him so let's not forget psalm 32 there's going to be times we got to wait though god wants to show himself strong in us but we got to wait the bible says even wait quietly but then the bible says shout for joy so i guess sometimes you're waiting quietly sometimes you're shouting for joy with the songs of victory praise god songs of deliverance so god's eyes are always looking for someone to run around all over the earth who can i show myself strong in who's waiting on me praise god who's waiting for my word who's trusting in my word hallelujah good scripture another good scripture on the eyes of the lord i'm glad he's watching your life you're telling me he's watching your life i love the story of hagar you know we listen to that uh adam and eve story we have this audio series it's a pretty good one but hagar is basically like taken out of egypt when abraham and sarah left egypt and she becomes a maid servant which is not a slave a maid servant she had rights to you know she writes as well preach on lord willing but in genesis 16 sarah gets angry against hagar and you know the story hagar or sarah gets mad and throws her out the bible said hagar went wandering through the wilderness can you imagine you already got taken out of egypt you're in a different land all you've done is done what your masters have told you do she even at that time she'd already been with abraham she just done everything they told her to do and then sarah turned on her kicks her out she's not the free woman she's the bondwoman so she's wandering in a country she doesn't know all alone but church she found out pretty soon she wasn't all alone i didn't hear you praise god she thought nobody saw her she thought nobody cared for her but the angel of the lord come to her and the angel said hey god what a lethe what bothers you and she says i've got you know my master and his wife have put me out and the bible says the angel says go back unto sarah and submit yourself unto her now she's wandering she has no direction and look the spirit of god shows up glory spirit of god shows up and tells her what to do in other words god showed her the way she should go praise god amen and this is just the benefit of being around abraham the friend of god the prophet of god amen right there that's right he that honors the prophet gets a prophet's rewarding then there it is right there she got a promise reward just by obeying the prophet of course she wasn't on the same level sarah she's a bomb woman but she got a prophet's reward in other words the the god of the prophet said his angel to help her out and the bible said even out there in the wilderness where it's dry and hot the bible said god had a well for her to drink water remember the name of that well beer lehigh road beer lahaira anyone know what that means it means the well of the living one sees me i'm kicked out i'm all alone i'm in the desert i don't know where i am and god's angel comes here and tells her you are seen my eye is on you i know this situation i know what's going to happen here i've already seen this god has saw you praise god god cares about you breaks up and if god cares for the bond woman what about the free woman amen hallelujah if god sees the bottom woman that's kicked out and she's not even on the same and she's the type of the old testament what about the new testament praise god if god saw that he knows this in the church let me tell you god sees you today praise god and that was her word she gave it she gave the well that name beer lahiro be luck beer lahaira the well of the living one has seen me the eyes of the living one has seen me hallelujah the well the living one seen me in other words god see when i feel like i'm wandering around when i feel like i'm nobody else god sees me and god provides for me yes and that's not the seat of abraham if god sees the bond woman or the maidservant what about the free woman galatians chapter 4 we're not going to read it i've reached on a while back the bible says the bond woman in fremont were a type for us the bond woman hagar type the old testament law we type the new testament we are children of the promise and remember remember church after she had ishmael and and sarah had isaac remember ishmael made fun of isaac abraham kicked him out and then they're they're about ready to die the bible said she threw the child under the bush through or dropped him or something like some crazy language and she said i can't stand to see this child die and who comes again but the angel of the lord again in other words the angel says let me give you god's eyesight for your life this is not where it's going to end he said god is going to use ishmael he's going to be a mighty hunter he's going to raise him up a kingdom oh look no no doubt she rejoiced and then the bible said then god opened hagar's eyes and she saw the well that she could drink from it was there the whole time she just couldn't see it she needed god's eyesight amen praise god so look even with the the bondwoman even with those that are not under the promise god still opens their eyes to see their position oh and god has opened up our eyes oh god help us to see our position amen amen amen oh it's mighty that's right he opened hagar's eyes may god open our eyes to see that he has wells for us amen hallelujah he has victories for us god's eye church is your guide god's eye he said i will guide them with my eye god will give you vision god will give you leadership of the holy spirit god will show you which way you need to go amen he'll guide you with his eye praise god how do you believe that amen how many believe it was god's eye that was directing moses out of the wilderness for 40 years that's right brother ram said defeat can you imagine i'm going to beat all that egypt and stuff out of him he got it beat jason all the arguments on the back side of the desert as he said i want to say beating it out of him god's eye saw that he thought my life is done i'm finished with with his eyes he could kill one egyptian but with god's eyes he delivered two million people that's right that's right how many of you god's i will guide you amen glory abraham the same way he wondered all these places the bible said he did not know where he was going so he would wait patiently on god just like psalm 32 says just like david did he'd wait patiently he confessed his sins and then god would show him the way to go hallelujah led job into his greatest trials god suggested satan to test job god suggested it but yet was god still guiding job with his eye yes or no what do you think of course yes god saw the end from this part god saw the double blessing the best was yet to come how did i read scofield's words these are some of the most beautiful words about job i've never read the problem of which the book of job is the profound discussion finds here at solution in job 42 verse 6. i'm going to turn there job 42 verse 6 we find we find the solution to job's problem so how many one know the solution to job's problem okay i got a few events all right i'll take it so the solution is wherefore i abhor myself and repent and dust and ashes scofield says this is the solution to job's problem he learns to hate his sinful nature you've got two sides right you got a human nature and you got divine nature we're partakers of divine nature by promise is that your name his trials job's trials led him by the holy spirit to hate his human nature his own sinful side remember he exalted himself above god brother he said god is unrighteous and i'm righteous god's doing wrong i've done right the whole time and god was bringing job down to humble him and said god is righteous amen that's right you're the one who needs to repent is that right so here's the solution trials will make us humble ourselves and realize god is greater than us amen god's eyesight there's my tendons god's eyesight sees a little more than our eyesight amen and church i need this too i'm not putting myself out i need this i need god's eyesight if we have a hard month of finances i'll get discouraged or the church had a little tough moment why can't i see ahead a couple years why can't i see when the blessing's coming you know we all get discouraged we all go through this but this is god's way and god's ways are always the best ways amen amen hallelujah amen his ways are past finding out as the heavens are from the earth so are god's ways higher than our ways i can just preach that one over and over again i love that though brought into the presence of god joe is revealed to himself see when you go through trials your sinful side you see your sinful side and you see who you really are yeah in your sin nature yeah and i don't even talk about after you're born again i'm glad i got some money or something or oh yeah even after you're born again you see oh i still have a sinful nature and i don't like it hates god the bible says the flesh is hatred against god yes amen joe was in no sense of a hypocrite scofield said but godly and possessing a faith which all his afflictions could not shake i'll do so he still had faith even though he said bad things even though he exalted himself he still had unmovable faith he was just getting in the flesh and the church said sometimes you and i just get in the flesh we gotta look past the church we gotta look past we gotta forgive and if we're wrong we gotta say forgive me jesus job was yet self-righteous and lacking in humility which chapter 9 of job 29 chapter 29 of job clearly shows he says i am righteous and god is unrighteous but in the presence of god oh there's his hiding place amen but in the hiding place the problem is solved the godly are afflicted that they might be brought to self-knowledge and self-judgment such afflictions are not penal they're not uh forever punishing us for our sins but they're remedial and purifying amen in other words trials are meant to purify you not to punish you like god's angry at you they're to purify you the book of job affords a sublime illustration of the truth announced in the scripture if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged see job wasn't judging himself right right he was judging i'm greater than god that's the wrong judgment right he didn't judge himself right there in the middle and god had to humble him at the end of his life or i was at the end of the trial remember ilahu took job up and down and rebuked to rebuke rebuke rebuke rebuke that's what he deserved that's what all of us deserve sometimes and i like what scofield ends with this but best of all such self-knowledge and self-judgment of our sinful nature is the prelude to greater fruitfulness in other words we've got to see our weak human side repent of it and then we'll see greater spiritual fruit in our lives amen yes amen so again i see four benefits of suffering self-knowledge and self-judgment which is brings humility the second benefit you learn obedience benefit you get greater fruitfulness and the fourth benefit you can be a testimony to other people because of the things you suffer amen because eternal life is living for others so i'm god's allowing me to go through this so i can live for others how many want to see your life through god's eyes amen that's how the musicians come to stand to our feet here i could go a lot more i got a lot more to preach but again i try to finish all these series and i just start new ones every night it's funny to me maybe not funny right now may god help us let's have our heads here for word prayer guided by
