[0:00] and I was going to preach with brother
[0:01] Chris was look at finances again we want
[0:02] to revisit that it's been about 3 years
[0:04] since I preached on that so I told him
[0:06] we would uh Minister on that uh when he
[0:09] can get here by God's
[0:10] grace let's go to Luke
[0:13] 24 and we'll pick up there uh by the
[0:15] grace of God where we left off on
[0:21] Wednesday let's read verse 32 if I'm not
[0:24] mistaken here by God's grace Luke 24:32
[0:33] I trust someone's been blessed by this
[0:34] Burning series here by the grace of the
[0:36] Lord it came by fresh Revelation just by
[0:39] reading through the Bible and I saw that
[0:41] phrase and I it just struck me that one
[0:42] morning I'm like oh my goodness I've
[0:44] never heard of this even my wife told me
[0:46] when I first read that title she's like
[0:47] what is he gonna preach on what is the
[0:50] what is this guy gonna Preach
[0:53] Today no I love you D of course you're
[0:56] precious U but it's just funny for me to
[0:58] hear that you know because uh
[1:00] it it isn't a phrase I've ever really
[1:02] preached on before so it's like a fresh
[1:03] it's fresh Revelation to me but you know
[1:05] we we didn't really get to the part
[1:07] where their hearts were burning as far
[1:08] as reading the scripture so I want to
[1:10] read that today uh Luke
[1:13] 2432 by God's
[1:17] grace so we want to read that
[1:19] and then we'll have just a short little
[1:21] prayer again by God's grace let's read
[1:24] that on three can we one two three but
[1:26] they said unto one another did did not
[1:30] our heart burn within us while he talked
[1:33] with us by the way and while he opened
[1:37] to us the scriptures amen if you have a
[1:39] need on your heart let's make it known
[1:40] unto God let's pray again today how
[1:43] great is our God how great is his word
[1:44] we've been singing about the greatness
[1:46] of God that theme kind of got on my
[1:48] heart this morning so I trust those
[1:49] songs were a blessing father God we love
[1:51] you today Lord God how great you are
[1:53] Lord God we'll be singing about your
[1:54] greatness for all eternity Lord God
[1:57] still learning of your greatness for all
[1:58] eternity amen age after age Lord God
[2:01] we're grateful for these precious
[2:03] promises Lord of eternal life no greater
[2:05] promise than eternal life Lord Jesus so
[2:08] we're thankful for that and we want to
[2:09] go on into the depths of your word into
[2:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to
[2:12] be justified Sanctified baptized with
[2:15] the Holy Ghost Lord God ready for the
[2:17] Rapture so Lord I pray you make your
[2:18] people ready today Lord God let this uh
[2:21] word let this uh sermon the thought you
[2:23] place on my heart be a blessing to your
[2:25] people and of course they know they have
[2:26] control over the service as they pull
[2:29] and Lord myself included Lord God to
[2:31] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:33] May each person get in the spirit may we
[2:34] follow the leadership thereof and we'll
[2:36] give you all the glory and praise and
[2:38] honor in Jesus Christ's name the Saints
[2:40] said amen God bless you as you being
[2:42] seated praise
[2:53] God so we look at part four here the
[2:55] spirit of Burning uh by God's grace we
[2:57] looked at uh from our text from luk or
[3:00] Isaiah chapter
[3:02] 4 the Bible said God would send the
[3:05] spirit of judgment and the spirit of
[3:06] burning judgment is you judging yourself
[3:09] correctly by the Holy Ghost in church in
[3:11] most cases we're going to judge
[3:12] ourselves that we we're Sinners right
[3:14] we've fallen short we need the mercy of
[3:16] God how many need God's Mercy today
[3:18] Hallelujah we constantly need it as we
[3:20] go through the trials of
[3:21] life and we uh you know we have to avoid
[3:23] the traps of Satan sometimes we fall
[3:25] into them uh we got to get uh re
[3:27] forgiven and repent and so forth that
[3:30] takes a spirit of judgment to judge our
[3:31] situation the correct way then the
[3:33] spirit of burning comes and that's where
[3:36] God cleanses us and prepares us for more
[3:39] service by the grace of God I'm happy to
[3:41] be in the service of the Lord today are
[3:43] you happy hallelujah it's a blessing you
[3:45] we could be so many other places today
[3:46] we could have be sick we could be uh uh
[3:49] could be lots of different places but
[3:50] we're thankful to be in the house of the
[3:52] Lord today Hallelujah lot of people
[3:53] could be at work a lot of people are at
[3:54] work today we're thankful we're not at
[3:56] work today we're in the house of the
[3:57] Lord hallelujah and so it looks like
[3:59] like to me looks like justification and
[4:01] sanctification uh because the Holy Ghost
[4:03] wasn't yet given till Jesus was
[4:05] glorified but we saw how Isaiah I'm just
[4:07] reviewing just for a moment Isaiah had
[4:09] Burning uh of the Holy Spirit to put him
[4:12] into service after the death of King
[4:14] Uzziah Jeremiah had the burning to keep
[4:16] him in service to keep him from
[4:19] quitting and Copus and his friend had
[4:21] the burning to uh revive the joy of
[4:24] their
[4:25] service because they weren't talking
[4:27] about quitting like Jeremiah Was they
[4:29] weren't even under any really
[4:30] persecution but they got the burning
[4:33] that uh revived their Joy or another way
[4:36] we might say I've been thinking about it
[4:37] all week right another way is they got
[4:39] the spirit of burning to clarify their
[4:42] understanding about service because
[4:44] they're all they're all in question
[4:46] they're all sad they're wondering what's
[4:48] going on and uh of course we all would
[4:50] have been in that situation as we talked
[4:51] about now I want to read what brother
[4:52] Bram said here uh uh as after I preach
[4:54] this I remembered I've listened to
[4:55] brother Ram preach on Luke 24 numerous
[4:58] times and there there a couple specific
[5:00] instances when he preached the sermon he
[5:03] preached two of them events made clear
[5:05] by prophecy in 1965 so you might
[5:08] remember that and I remember the spirit
[5:10] just reminded me brother random listed a
[5:12] bunch of scriptures that Jesus preached
[5:14] to Copus and his friend I was like
[5:15] that's right so I want to preach those
[5:16] to you today uh as brother brandom
[5:19] preached it to us hallelujah now but I
[5:21] want you to see what brother randam said
[5:23] here uh the very first thing he says
[5:24] about these Copus and his friend brother
[5:26] B says notice how Jesus the word made
[5:29] the these two heartbroke
[5:32] disciples anybody ever had their heart
[5:34] broke by the the the trials of life
[5:37] you're just like oh this is so
[5:39] incredible this is so hard uh I feel
[5:42] like I'm broken I feel like my life's
[5:44] been broken apart in pieces and brother
[5:47] Ram says there're remember they were sad
[5:49] Jesus said so they were in a sad
[5:52] brokenhearted condition but I'll say
[5:54] like this they were still disciples how
[5:56] do you know because they were still
[5:58] meditating on Jesus even in in their sad
[6:00] brokenhearted moments church I'll say
[6:02] like this there's nothing better to talk
[6:04] about Hallelujah whether you're happy
[6:06] whether you're sad whether you're on the
[6:07] mountain or the valley let's talk about
[6:09] Jesus Hallelujah Glory he said Jesus he
[6:15] said uh made these two heartbroke
[6:17] disciples know he was their Messiah the
[6:20] promised word and notice what he did he
[6:23] appealed to
[6:25] prophecy he said fools slow to believe
[6:29] that the prophets have
[6:31] wrote now he never said well what does
[6:34] your church say about it I like that
[6:37] brother raham said when Jesus come out
[6:39] and preach he wasn't saying what does
[6:40] the church say or what does tradition
[6:42] say or what does history say he said
[6:44] what does the scripture say hallelujah
[6:47] what a blessing
[6:49] amen so we can see how uh Jesus
[6:52] approached him but I want to back up a
[6:54] little bit and uh and just uh rehearse
[6:58] as Copus and his friend now remember
[6:59] Copus was the father of James the Lesser
[7:02] James the Lesser was one of the two
[7:04] James that were uh two of Jesus's 12
[7:06] disciples he was the Lesser known one he
[7:09] wasn't the the brother of of John the
[7:11] son of Zebedee right and the mother uh
[7:14] uh who tried to get them at the right
[7:16] and left hand of Jesus that was a
[7:17] different uh uh it was a different James
[7:20] by God's grace and vangi said James is a
[7:21] good name for you to choose but that's a
[7:22] real Godly name right there lot of good
[7:25] there's going to be a lot of James in
[7:26] the Hall of Fame of Faith that's a great
[7:29] name by God God's grace but Copus was
[7:32] James the lesser's father so he no doubt
[7:34] he knew his son had left everything to
[7:36] follow Jesus Christ and no doubt he'd
[7:38] heard all the the fame the Bible said
[7:40] the fame of Jesus went through all the
[7:41] land of Judea so the father would have
[7:44] known all about the amazing Miracles the
[7:46] mighty signs and wonders of
[7:49] Jesus and so I just want to rehearse
[7:51] this is how brother R uh tried to
[7:53] dramatize it here he said uh he said uh
[7:58] Copus and his friend they just started
[7:59] talking my this has been an incredible
[8:02] week uh he was saying they were singing
[8:06] hosana to Jesus just a just a week
[8:09] ago what a and Jesus was riding a a cult
[8:14] the the foul of an ass right a a donkey
[8:16] he was riding that and what a week it's
[8:18] been and and then to see uh how Judas
[8:23] betrayed him for 30 pieces of silver
[8:25] they're just walking along my I've seen
[8:27] Judas cast out Devils right I SE Judas
[8:30] uh pray for the sick and they got healed
[8:32] and how could this happen and Judas was
[8:34] one of our closest
[8:35] Brothers I I didn't suspect it would be
[8:38] Judas that would betray us they're just
[8:40] walking along talking about yeah and
[8:41] then and then we went to the Garden
[8:44] prayed and uh and then and then the
[8:46] arrest came and we saw uh we saw Jesus
[8:49] do a miracle there even when he's
[8:51] getting arrested and he didn't save
[8:52] himself he only saved uh the the the
[8:55] soldier whose ear fell off or got cut
[8:57] off by Peter and then then and then all
[9:00] of these Burly friends and all the
[9:02] disciples the Burly fishermen brother
[9:04] said then they all scattered like sheep
[9:06] from Jesus can you believe our brothers
[9:09] and after three and a half years oh
[9:11] isn't it so sad to see our brothers just
[9:13] run away from Jesus the shepherd
[9:15] wouldn't that so incredibly sad I wonder
[9:18] and then you know uh apparently the
[9:20] Peter and John ran down to the the
[9:22] supplier this morning and and they
[9:24] couldn't find Jesus but they still
[9:25] weren't sure and we don't know whether
[9:27] to believe the sisters or not you know
[9:29] uh I don't know if we should believe our
[9:30] sisters all the time you
[9:32] know oh and he says fools Jesus calls
[9:35] them
[9:36] fools right and they're just talking
[9:39] they're
[9:39] rehearsing and then you know then he
[9:41] went to the Palace of Caiaphas remember
[9:44] that you
[9:45] know and all these false accusers raised
[9:47] up and then they started none of them
[9:49] agreed none of the accusers agreed this
[9:52] one said it was he raised up after three
[9:54] days that one said four that none of
[9:56] them agreed on any of their accusations
[9:58] and Jesus was quiet like a little quiet
[10:03] lamb he was dumb he wasn't talking
[10:06] anything he was just quiet and they kept
[10:09] talking and then they said then they
[10:10] started smacking our
[10:12] Lord how could how could the Lord Jesus
[10:15] allow this they started ripping out his
[10:18] beard and they started spitting on him
[10:20] and oh it was what kind of this was what
[10:23] is happening
[10:26] here and then he was scourged and and
[10:29] then you know we saw his bones as he and
[10:31] then look he carried his own he
[10:33] basically carried his own cross up the
[10:35] hill for a while till he fell down he he
[10:38] carried his own cross up to his own
[10:41] death he was going up there to be
[10:43] sacrificed and he was forced to carry
[10:45] his own cross his bones staring at
[10:50] him his wounds he was covered in wounds
[10:53] he was covered in stripes and they're
[10:55] just walking around what kind of this is
[10:57] incredibly sad we were trusting him to
[11:00] be the king of
[11:02] Israel there's carrying around remember
[11:04] it was about uh uh from history it was
[11:06] either two or two and a half three or
[11:08] four hour walk now brother BR says six
[11:09] hours it could have been six hours I'm
[11:11] not making that a big point you don't
[11:14] understand like it's not a big
[11:16] point and then brother R makes it kind
[11:18] of a cheeky comment you know or a funny
[11:20] comment he said if Jesus preached six
[11:21] hours don't be offended if I preach six
[11:23] hours he said I like brother man sense
[11:26] of humor and he did when he preached
[11:27] spoken word Original Seed he preached a
[11:29] six and a half hour sermon that's one
[11:31] time I know he preached a six and a half
[11:32] hour sermon he said don't be offended if
[11:34] God's servants have to do that
[11:36] today
[11:39] Hallelujah then they said then they smot
[11:41] Jesus and then the the soldiers smoted
[11:43] him with the spear water and blood came
[11:47] out and then the whole sky went went
[11:52] black and then the and then uh Joseph of
[11:57] arthea took him down off there and and
[11:59] put him in a tomb that what wasn't even
[12:01] Jesus's tomb Jesus couldn't even afford
[12:02] a tomb he was put in a rich man's
[12:06] tomb they're just talking all this just
[12:09] trying to understand what happened this
[12:12] weekend I hope you've had a good weekend
[12:14] by God's grace because they obviously
[12:17] had a very awful
[12:21] weekend and then of course they would
[12:23] have t talked about how all the soldiers
[12:26] parted his garments remember we saw that
[12:28] garments were being parted they were
[12:29] gambling over his
[12:31] garments and then he when he was
[12:33] crucified it wasn't just himself it was
[12:34] amongst two
[12:36] thieves he had to be our perfect our
[12:39] sinless Messiah our Lord had to be
[12:42] crucified next to two Mur or two
[12:45] thieves
[12:49] why and they just talk back and
[12:53] forth going retelling the story and then
[12:56] they thought God even s a m or I'm sorry
[12:58] A message messenger a forerunner John
[13:01] the
[13:02] Baptist God even sent an Elijah anointed
[13:06] Prophet I hope somebody's hearing me
[13:07] today by God's gra God sent a prophet
[13:09] with the spirit of
[13:12] Elijah and then the Lord suddenly came
[13:14] to his
[13:16] Temple and they talked hour for hour an
[13:20] hour along the way and then all of a
[13:22] sudden as we saw Jesus steps out of or
[13:25] he comes out of maybe like maybe there's
[13:27] two Hills he kind of Cl steps uh and
[13:30] comes into view and then he starts
[13:32] talking to him he said what are these
[13:35] things you're talking about you seem so
[13:37] sad Hallelujah and they would they
[13:39] should have been sad to see their
[13:41] Brethren and uh to be scattered like
[13:43] sheep and to see all the all the the
[13:46] punishment and the the chastisement
[13:49] Jesus Took they should have been
[13:51] sad and I found out I even did some
[13:54] research too just about ties and
[13:55] offerings and so forth uh with the with
[13:59] the Feast of the unleavened bread and
[14:01] Passover they were only required to be
[14:02] there on the first and the seventh day
[14:04] so they were just going home between the
[14:06] SE the seven days of the unleavened
[14:08] bread the males were only required to be
[14:10] there on the first day and the seventh
[14:12] day of course they got to go home and
[14:14] work during the week right you got to
[14:15] come worship on the weekends and then
[14:17] work during the week sound familiar
[14:18] anybody that sounds like our lives
[14:20] doesn't it worship God on the weekends
[14:23] and then go back to
[14:25] work and so that's why no doubt Copus
[14:27] and his friend they were leaving because
[14:28] they they celebrated the day there they
[14:30] had the Feast of uh first fruits and
[14:34] unleavened bread Passover they
[14:35] celebrated the Friday Saturday Sunday
[14:37] and they're on their way
[14:40] home and so then Jesus steps
[14:43] out and uh Jesus says what things are
[14:46] you talking about like he didn't
[14:50] know right like God doesn't know about
[14:53] your life how many know that he knows
[14:55] and how many know he cares about your
[14:57] life
[14:59] Hallelujah but Jesus asks he humbles
[15:01] himself he said tell me what things what
[15:03] do you what do you understand about
[15:05] prophecy
[15:08] Hallelujah and so I like I'm going to
[15:10] read this quote I love what brother Bram
[15:11] said he said let's go back a few minutes
[15:14] and now let's listen to the words Jesus
[15:18] quoted from
[15:21] himself everybody catch that Jesus
[15:24] starts preaching to them from
[15:27] himself I'm preaching from somebody else
[15:30] today but when Jesus preached he
[15:32] preached from himself Hallelujah and the
[15:35] church said he's the word and so the
[15:38] only thing the word can preach is the
[15:40] word hallelujah God bless you brother
[15:43] Chris and brother man makes a striking
[15:45] statement to me he said watch here the
[15:48] word itself quoting the word
[15:51] himself so the words quoting the word
[15:55] hallelujah now we do it in a minor way
[15:57] because we're part of the word we were
[15:59] chosen to Christ before the foundation
[16:01] of the world so we're a part of the word
[16:03] quoting God's word
[16:05] hallelujah but we're not the fullness of
[16:07] the word Jesus was the fullness of the
[16:10] word he's the Mighty God he's the
[16:12] Everlasting father but it was the it was
[16:14] God quoting God
[16:16] hallelujah oh you're not going to get
[16:17] anything wrong when you hear that
[16:18] Hallelujah when God's preaching God
[16:21] you're going to hear a wonderful message
[16:22] it's going to be a heartb burning
[16:23] message hallelujah praise God I'm sorry
[16:26] getting getting new hairstyle and it
[16:27] keeps falling out of place here so bear
[16:29] with
[16:30] me I always wanted to grow my hair a
[16:32] little longer by God's
[16:35] grace he said the word quoting the word
[16:39] of himself not tell them that he was
[16:42] that but just let the word amen speak
[16:44] for itself Jesus remember he's hiding
[16:46] his his his his identity he hasn't told
[16:48] them he's the he's Jesus he's just
[16:51] letting the word do all the Talking amen
[16:53] hallelujah that's how I know no matter
[16:55] who comes here if they have a seat of
[16:57] God if they have a seat of the word in
[16:59] their soul the word that I'm preaching
[17:02] by the Holy Ghost will speak to their
[17:04] word it'll be word preaching the word
[17:06] hallelujah and there's nothing that'll
[17:09] keep them from hearing the truth of
[17:10] God's word hallelujah nothing that's why
[17:13] you're here today that's why you're not
[17:16] at the Catholic Church nothing against
[17:17] them as far as the individuals the
[17:19] systems Antichrist but nothing the
[17:21] nothing against the individuals because
[17:23] they'll be judged
[17:24] individually we love the individuals we
[17:26] hate the sin right we hate the
[17:28] Antichrist system
[17:29] but why aren't you out there at the
[17:30] Pentecostal Church Jose knows why why
[17:32] aren we out there at the return Ministry
[17:34] Church or something like that is because
[17:35] we've got a seed inside of us and it's a
[17:37] part of the word and that word only
[17:40] feeds on the word
[17:42] hallelujah like Jesus was the word
[17:44] preaching the word
[17:46] hallelujah
[17:49] glory and look what brother Ram
[17:52] says he says uh but he said just let the
[17:55] word speak for itself then they know who
[17:58] he
[17:59] was that's how we know like brother
[18:02] Irvin's a real preacher because he's
[18:03] pointing to the
[18:05] word right I love what my children my
[18:07] children notice uh we always talk about
[18:08] our favorite Parts on Sunday night and
[18:10] one of my children a couple of my
[18:11] children said we love how brother
[18:12] Irvin's absolute is the word of
[18:15] God right because we have so many people
[18:17] today outside of our church that brother
[18:19] Ram's the absolute or uh the quotes of
[18:21] the absolute and they're
[18:22] deceived brother bam said Jesus's word
[18:25] is the absolute brother bram's pointing
[18:27] us to the absolute but see you can
[18:29] recognize Irvin as a man of God because
[18:32] he's pointing us to the word he's got a
[18:34] seed word and he's pointing to the word
[18:37] hallelujah that's what I Endeavor to do
[18:39] every time I come to the pulpit brother
[18:41] R said it was the word in flesh now
[18:44] catch this the word in flesh quoting the
[18:47] word of the
[18:49] letter hallelujah praise God he said
[18:53] being fully identified with
[18:57] himself Jesus is identifying himself in
[19:00] the word without telling them who he
[19:03] is but he's identifying himself with the
[19:06] word that's why with a real preacher you
[19:07] know who they're identified with based
[19:09] upon what they preach if they preach the
[19:11] word then they're a part of the word
[19:14] hallelujah is that right if they preach
[19:16] Church Creeds or organization or
[19:18] Antichrist Spirit or or deeds or
[19:20] doctrines of the nicadan or or the Baum
[19:23] Spirit or the spirit of Jezebel if
[19:25] that's what they preach that's what
[19:27] Spirit thereof but if we preached the
[19:29] word that means we're of the word
[19:31] hallelujah that means we came out of the
[19:33] word hallelujah that means we've got a
[19:35] word seed
[19:36] Hallelujah
[19:39] yes brother ra said now let's listen to
[19:41] him quote the
[19:43] word he said now we all know that they
[19:45] were briefed of the late happenings that
[19:48] is of the crucifixion and the story of
[19:50] the resurrection and the tomb as we just
[19:53] read he said but now Jesus goes straight
[19:56] to the word of prophecy about himself
[19:58] self let's just think that he said this
[20:01] and he said a lot more about this but
[20:07] watch so the Bible said that Jesus let
[20:10] me get the verse there he began at Moses
[20:14] Hallelujah let me get that verse there
[20:17] that one I didn't have right in front of
[20:18] me Luke
[20:19] 24 he begins at Moses and begins to
[20:22] preach about himself
[20:37] now yeah there it is verse 2 26 and 27
[20:40] ought not Christ to have suffered in
[20:41] verse 26 of these things and to enter
[20:43] into his rest verse 27 and beginning at
[20:46] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[20:49] unto them in all the scriptures the
[20:51] things concerning
[20:54] himself so Jesus says oh fools slow to
[20:57] believe all that's written in the
[20:59] prophets about the
[21:02] Messiah now here's where you know you're
[21:04] a real believer if you can take a rebuke
[21:06] from the word of God and still stand
[21:08] there and sit and enjoy it well I
[21:11] shouldn't say not your flesh won't enjoy
[21:12] it but your soul will that's how you
[21:14] know you're a true seed of God right
[21:18] Jesus calls them fools and then rebukes
[21:20] them and by the end they're like don't
[21:22] leave me stay with me keep preaching the
[21:24] word to me
[21:25] Hallelujah keep telling me the word
[21:27] hallelujah cuz you you you point us to
[21:29] the word of
[21:32] God so he started at Genesis so one of
[21:35] the first verses he started at was he
[21:38] said brother Ram said then notice Copus
[21:42] all the types he said what about Isaac
[21:45] Copus and your friend in Genesis 22 how
[21:48] God foreshadowed Isaac how Father
[21:51] Abraham took his own son packing the
[21:54] wood up the hill and offered up his own
[21:57] son
[21:58] so perhaps Jesus started there you all
[22:02] have misunderstood this thing about the
[22:05] Messiah the Messiah was supposed to be
[22:08] sacrificed he was supposed to be Jehovah
[22:11] Gyra our provided
[22:14] sacrifice didn't Isaac carry up the wood
[22:17] for his sacrifice and wasn't he the
[22:20] wasn't he the son of Abraham and they're
[22:21] like yeah Jesus said well the Messiah
[22:25] was also the son of Abraham and he had
[22:27] to carry his own own cross up the
[22:30] hill like oh I missed that imagine
[22:34] Church they're watching Jesus car the
[22:36] cross all these people and they don't
[22:37] even realize Genesis 22 is being
[22:40] fulfilled
[22:41] Hallelujah Church the same thing could
[22:43] happened to us we and that's how it was
[22:45] in brother Ram day all these things were
[22:46] happening Brother R's Ministry and very
[22:48] few people caught that he was even a
[22:49] prophet let alone Malachi 4 Revelation
[22:52] 107 Luke
[22:54] 17:30 uh Matthew 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21
[22:58] all these scriptures about restitution
[23:00] it's happening right in front of their
[23:02] faces but church if God don't open our
[23:04] eyes we're all going to miss it
[23:05] Hallelujah but thank God for the isav of
[23:08] the Holy Spirit praise God he won't let
[23:11] us miss it if we really love God and we
[23:13] really want revelation God's obligated
[23:16] to give it to us
[23:18] hallelujah and if your eyes are open
[23:20] today you'll see that we are eating the
[23:23] Book of Revelation 10 and we're
[23:24] prophesying those things again we're
[23:26] finishing the Great Commission we're
[23:28] still looking for Souls down here in
[23:30] akan like brother Austin and brother
[23:32] Chris hallelujah we're looking for souls
[23:34] in akan by the grace of God hallelujah
[23:36] our wonderful brothers here that were
[23:38] baptized this year genev is going to get
[23:39] baptized pretty soon we're finishing the
[23:41] Great Commission every Gentile whose
[23:44] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life has
[23:46] got to be realized that they have
[23:48] they've accepted Christ they're
[23:49] Justified Sanctified filled with the
[23:51] Holy Ghost then the Rapture will
[23:54] come amen so if you're if you're in the
[23:57] Holy Spirit to today you can see what
[23:59] prophecy God's fulfilling today praise
[24:02] God
[24:04] Amen you can see the churches uniting
[24:06] with each other with Rome going to the
[24:08] mother Harlot you can see that because
[24:11] you've got eyes that have eyes have the
[24:13] spirit of God has anointed your
[24:15] spiritual sight Hallelujah glory to God
[24:18] so Jesus starts in Genesis doesn't he
[24:22] my and then brother Ram says this he
[24:25] said he said Copus don't you remember
[24:28] Zechariah
[24:30] 11:12 wasn't the Messiah supposed to be
[24:32] sold according to the prophet for 30
[24:34] pieces of silver and didn't and you just
[24:37] said this man was sold for 30 pieces of
[24:39] silver are you getting those scriptures
[24:42] Copus and they had just talked about it
[24:45] before Jesus came out they just talked
[24:47] about the 30 pieces of silver they had
[24:50] just talked and then the the preacher
[24:51] starts preaching about things you just
[24:53] thought about don't you love that when
[24:56] God preaches things you just talked
[24:58] about
[24:59] you just read about you just studied you
[25:01] just prayed about amen and that's what
[25:03] Jesus brings out now a second scripture
[25:06] Zechariah 11 and
[25:08] 12 where he said you'll be sold for 30
[25:11] pieces of silver that's right so now
[25:15] look they got two Revelations on the
[25:17] Messiah oh and church notice with each
[25:21] Revelation the confusion and doubt
[25:24] starts going away like a cloud being
[25:26] blown away
[25:29] Hallelujah each Revelation is another
[25:32] unveiling so I can see more of God's
[25:34] plan because before they wondered was he
[25:36] the Messiah even John the Baptist
[25:38] wondered is he the Messiah see Satan
[25:40] brings in all this confusion but the
[25:41] more revelation we get from the Bible
[25:44] the more Bible Revelation we get
[25:46] Hallelujah the more things clear up the
[25:48] more understanding we have and then
[25:50] sadness must leave brokenheartedness
[25:52] must leave all these evil spirits must
[25:54] leave when we get a real revelation of
[25:56] the Bible Hallelujah
[25:58] Hallelujah that's
[26:01] right then brother R said and then Jesus
[26:04] said you notice when David said in the
[26:05] Psalms Psalm 41:9 he was betrayed of his
[26:08] friends my own familiar friend in whom
[26:11] I've trusted which did eat my bread
[26:13] lifted his heel up against me that's
[26:15] right Judas was Jesus's familiar friend
[26:19] and they had the Lord's Supper that
[26:21] night oh my goodness all these things
[26:24] happened in a matter of week and we
[26:26] missed it but somebody's able to preach
[26:29] it to
[26:30] us and that's Jesus
[26:34] Hallelujah and then Jesus said Copus
[26:37] don't you remember Zechariah 13:7 he was
[26:40] forsaken by his disciples Smite the
[26:42] shepherd and the Sheep shall be
[26:45] scattered that's right Copus looks over
[26:47] and he bumps his we just talked about
[26:50] that that that yeah he's he's preaching
[26:52] our hearts he's preaching Our Lives he's
[26:54] reading our mail they say he's reading
[26:56] my email
[26:58] today it's mostly
[27:00] email and then so now four
[27:03] scriptures and then uh Psalm 3511
[27:07] they'll be accused by false Witnesses
[27:09] that's right at the palace of Caiaphas
[27:11] he was accused
[27:13] falsely now they got
[27:15] five and then then the Lord said don't
[27:18] you know Isaiah 53:7 said he was dumb
[27:21] before those accusers six verses that's
[27:24] right he was quiet before them so in
[27:28] other words God's not late uh we haven't
[27:30] failed God God's right on time we're not
[27:34] we're not outside of God's plan we are
[27:36] right in God's plan for today Hallelujah
[27:39] so what are we sad about Hallelujah the
[27:42] thing we should be sad about is
[27:43] repenting of our sins
[27:49] Hallelujah that's what you and I need
[27:51] today we need for God to show us what
[27:53] scriptures he's fulfilling
[27:55] today I'll say like this in our lives
[27:58] what is God doing in my life what's he
[28:01] trying to accomplish in my life when God
[28:03] does that it takes all the confusion
[28:05] away Hallelujah all the sadness all the
[28:08] brokenheartedness all the confusion all
[28:11] that leaves when God speaks directly to
[28:13] you discern your situation and tells you
[28:16] what's your part in the word of God
[28:18] hallelujah amen
[28:24] hallelujah then Jesus said cleopas what
[28:27] about uh Isaiah 50:6 I gave my back to
[28:30] the smiters that's right that's what
[28:32] Jesus did when he was scourged and my
[28:34] cheeks and them that plucked off the
[28:35] hair yes we saw that they plucked the
[28:37] hair off his cheeks his
[28:39] beard and he I hid not my face from
[28:42] shame and spitting we saw them spit in
[28:44] his
[28:45] face so now a seventh scripture
[28:48] opens W this wasn't this wasn't some
[28:51] chaos that God didn't know about in fact
[28:53] this was God's ordained plan each event
[28:57] of Jes Jesus uh last week was a a
[29:00] carefully uh uh planned out event in
[29:03] order to fill scripture and church if
[29:06] we're the children of God our lives are
[29:08] the same way every year of Our Lives is
[29:11] another opportunity for God to show us
[29:13] what he's doing with us hallelujah and
[29:15] to help us fulfill what must be done
[29:19] hallelujah
[29:22] Glory now I'm just going to say
[29:23] something to these young brothers that
[29:25] might preach
[29:26] someday I didn't get in my position of
[29:28] preaching until I was
[29:30] 24 all right Patrick Claude Malachi
[29:33] where's Zion your little what's that
[29:34] little guy's butt name
[29:36] again
[29:38] K these little guys James where's James
[29:40] you
[29:42] Andy you know you you know there's a
[29:44] certain time and season when God's going
[29:46] to put you in the service of the Lord I
[29:49] was scared to preach Bank pire remembers
[29:51] my first few sermons I probably look
[29:53] like a scared little child up there not
[29:55] So Much
[29:57] Anymore because you get you get in the
[29:59] spirit of God you start seeing the truth
[30:00] of God's word but see that part of my
[30:04] life had to be fulfilled there had to
[30:05] come a time and season for that other
[30:07] two other people looked at me and they
[30:08] said I knew he's going to be a preacher
[30:10] someday and that's not what that's not
[30:12] that's not what my wife saw me when we
[30:13] first started dating she didn't see a
[30:15] preacher very little of any preaching
[30:17] coming from
[30:18] me but see it's it's a it's a time frame
[30:21] God's Got A Plan God's molding you
[30:24] shaping you Hallelujah God's ordaining
[30:27] your life events of life everything of
[30:29] your life is ordained the footsteps of
[30:31] the righteous are ordered Lord and
[30:33] though a righteous man falls seven times
[30:35] he rises again
[30:40] Hallelujah but that's right he gave his
[30:43] back to the
[30:44] smiters he had his hair plucked off his
[30:47] face he got spit on
[30:50] shamed then Jesus said to Copus didn't
[30:53] Psalm 22 Copus say when he was on the
[30:55] cross he'd say my God my God why hast
[30:58] Thou forsaken me didn't he do that the
[31:00] day before yesterday afternoon Copus
[31:01] brother Ram says like that's right that
[31:06] was in The
[31:08] Pongal so now all the fear now all the
[31:11] sadness starts leaving once they realize
[31:15] God is doing
[31:16] something God's working behind the
[31:20] scenes even when he we don't see it
[31:23] you're working that sound like a
[31:24] familiar
[31:25] song even though I don't feel it God
[31:27] God's working
[31:29] Hallelujah even when you feel sad God's
[31:32] working for you Hallelujah God's working
[31:35] everything for your good praise
[31:37] God so again facts don't care about your
[31:40] feelings prophecy don't care about your
[31:43] feelings God's going to help you
[31:44] overcome your feelings
[31:46] Hallelujah
[31:49] Glory then Jesus said to Copus what here
[31:51] now I think we're on to eight or nine
[31:52] I'm gonna lose track of this but I can
[31:53] go back and count after service I
[31:54] probably don't have time to count right
[31:56] now he said well didn't it Al let's say
[31:58] in in Psalm 22
[32:01] Copus didn't the Bible say in verse 18
[32:04] his garments would be parted isn't that
[32:06] what happened that's right the Roman
[32:10] soldiers oh my every event was God doing
[32:16] something and brother Adam said Jesus
[32:18] looked at him and said did they do that
[32:20] or not see God likes to ask you a
[32:22] question did I fulfill my word or
[32:25] not now who's going to say God didn't
[32:27] who is here is going to with a with a
[32:29] with any any uh sincerity or honesty say
[32:33] God failed his word God can never fail
[32:36] the word of God hallelujah he is the
[32:38] word amen he is the word just because
[32:41] ites just because it doesn't go your way
[32:43] doesn't mean God is something wrong God
[32:44] did everything right Hallelujah your way
[32:47] is the wrong way God's way is the right
[32:49] right way because he is the way the
[32:51] truth and the
[32:52] life your life is ordained by God even
[32:56] the mistakes even the failures even the
[32:59] running away of 11 disciples that said
[33:03] they die for Jesus even that was
[33:05] ordained to Humble
[33:07] them see all your mistakes are ordained
[33:10] of God to show you how little you are
[33:14] and how much you need Jesus
[33:18] Christ now we uh our Taekwondo guy was
[33:21] trying to tell us what humility was I
[33:23] didn't agree with him but I I I agree
[33:26] with uh we got a good lesson on that
[33:27] well a lesson I say shouldn't say good
[33:30] lesson but if you look up humility if
[33:33] you look up that Greek word it means
[33:34] realize how little you
[33:38] are humble yourself in the sight of God
[33:41] and then he'll exalt you in new season
[33:42] so don't focus on how strong you are how
[33:44] much you know how good you can be focus
[33:47] on your littleness and then in your
[33:48] weakness God sends strength
[33:52] Hallelujah that's
[33:55] right humility is realizing I'm little
[33:58] I'm I don't know nothing I need God
[34:00] every moment of my life I need God's
[34:02] word to guide me Hallelujah I'm not
[34:05] going to make it unless God guides me
[34:07] through
[34:12] Hallelujah and they said Psalm 227 and8
[34:16] he was mocked by his enemies can you put
[34:17] pull up therea Psalm 227
[34:21] and8 he was mocked by his enemies the
[34:24] church now brother man's just he's
[34:25] trying to finish the sermon and they
[34:27] that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot
[34:28] out the lip they shake their head saying
[34:30] he trusted on the Lord that he would
[34:31] deliver my this was written a thousand
[34:32] years before Jesus was crucified let him
[34:35] deliver him seeing he Deli him that's
[34:37] exactly what those Pharisees said if
[34:38] he's the son of God let him come down
[34:40] and save or let him save himself and
[34:42] then then we'll
[34:44] believe and Jesus said isn't this what
[34:46] the scripture said about me isn't this
[34:49] what happened and they said yeah yeah I
[34:52] like that every time Jesus is preaching
[34:54] you can say Amen to every
[34:56] word but I'm Not Jesus so you don't have
[34:58] to say Amen to everything I
[35:00] say but you know when the spirit of
[35:02] God's preaching and you can say Amen to
[35:04] almost
[35:06] everything that's right Hallelujah he
[35:09] was mocked and then in Psalm 22 again
[35:11] Jesus told Copus didn't the Bible say
[35:13] not a bone of his body would be broken
[35:15] and that's right we he was staring at
[35:17] his bones but none of them were
[35:19] broken and they had to break the legs of
[35:21] the the other thief in order to get him
[35:23] to die before the end of the day end of
[35:25] the end of the the Friday
[35:28] that's right but they didn't have to
[35:28] break Jesus's legs that's right every
[35:33] detail oh yeah brother said g dramatized
[35:36] it he said did he said didn't Psalm 22
[35:39] say they pierc my hands and feet and
[35:42] brother R said he said Jesus had his
[35:44] hands behind his back so they couldn't
[35:45] see the nail scars in his hands so now
[35:48] we even know how Jesus was walking like
[35:50] this didn't Psalm 22 say his hands and
[35:53] his feet would be pierced he must had
[35:55] some covering on his feet there cuz no
[35:57] doubt they were sad they were looking
[35:58] down but he purposely for us it' be
[36:01] Hands In Pockets if you got skirts with
[36:04] pockets I heard those are pretty
[36:05] valuable that's at least what the
[36:07] sisters tell me but Jesus wouldn't show
[36:10] them the holes isn't that what the
[36:12] scripture said is is that the scripture
[36:14] Copus you're such a a good man such a
[36:17] mighty
[36:18] man fool right said really what what we
[36:21] all are as
[36:23] fools we think we know everything when
[36:25] things go don't go our way we complain
[36:27] we get sad we get heartbroke Church
[36:29] let's learn to trust in
[36:32] God and even when we got the wrong
[36:34] attitude God will come around and
[36:36] correct our attitude because he loves us
[36:38] so
[36:44] much so Jesus had his hands behind his
[36:47] back no doubt at that time brother R
[36:50] says he said Copus didn't Isaiah 53:12
[36:53] said he'd die between two Mal
[36:56] factors were those two men uh good men
[36:59] or were they malactor that's right they
[37:00] were thieves that's right they were
[37:03] thieves Isaiah 53 verse 9 didn't it say
[37:06] Copus that he was buried with the
[37:09] rich yeah that's right Joseph of arthea
[37:12] gave him his tomb he was a rich man yes
[37:14] he was buried with the rich oh my
[37:16] goodness every event of the whole
[37:19] weekend was ordained of God I got a
[37:22] couple
[37:24] more and then he get starts getting to
[37:26] the really powerful ones didn't Psalm
[37:28] 16:10 say I will not leave his soul in
[37:31] Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One
[37:34] to see corruption then they're like oh
[37:36] that's right bodies corrupt after four
[37:39] days or after three days into the fourth
[37:42] that's right I like how brother says he
[37:44] ends with that one he say because he's
[37:46] almost done oh he's got a couple
[37:49] more that's right so he he must have he
[37:52] must have risen and see now they now
[37:54] they feel oh maybe I can believe those
[37:55] women maybe I can believe those lowly
[37:58] people in the church maybe they're not
[38:00] so uh uh maybe they're not maybe they're
[38:03] believable maybe I can believe them
[38:06] because I'm so high and mighty and
[38:07] spiritual maybe I can believe a humble
[38:09] little
[38:10] person maybe God could give a a little
[38:12] sister a dream or a prophecy maybe I
[38:15] believe that well maybe I'm starting to
[38:17] believe now but before maybe I wouldn't
[38:19] believe it but when God starts revealing
[38:21] the word to you and you get in the Holy
[38:23] Spirit you start believing all things
[38:25] from God hallelujah amen you start
[38:27] believing God's word in other words
[38:29] God's going to help you believe the word
[38:31] just like he did Abraham and Sarah they
[38:34] laughed at it they said oh how could we
[38:35] ever bring forth a child they left and
[38:37] God said you're going to believe it this
[38:40] is my word this is my plan I'm bringing
[38:43] my word to pass
[38:48] Hallelujah that's right he was supposed
[38:51] to rais that so perhaps he is risen
[38:55] perhaps see how you can go Church see
[38:58] how in a matter of moments hours see how
[39:00] in a matter of a long sermon I'll say a
[39:02] long sermon for me because I preach hour
[39:03] and a half that's I guess that's long I
[39:06] don't know I think some people preach
[39:07] longer than
[39:08] me but see in a matter of just a couple
[39:10] hours your whole mindset can change
[39:13] toward your situation just by one sermon
[39:16] and the church said one sermon can
[39:18] change your whole outlook and where
[39:21] everything looked like chaos before now
[39:22] it's looking like clear skies and
[39:24] flowers coming up birds singing
[39:26] Hallelujah Resurrection sunshine and all
[39:29] these blessings why what made the
[39:31] difference prophecy God's word makes the
[39:33] difference God backing up his word god
[39:36] revealing his word to you makes all the
[39:38] difference and the Gates of Hell cannot
[39:40] Prevail against that
[39:42] Hallelujah the Gates of Hell wanted
[39:44] Copus to quit and his friend to quit and
[39:46] trying to get him sad and discouraged
[39:48] but Jesus steps out said no no no no no
[39:51] no these are my children I'm coming to
[39:54] revive their Joy I'm coming to dissolve
[39:58] their doubts Hallelujah and chch that's
[40:00] what Jesus wants to do today dissolve
[40:02] all of our doubts
[40:04] Hallelujah get us to be encouraged and
[40:07] uh take our minds out of discouragement
[40:09] sadness broken heartness gloom despair
[40:13] depression take our minds out of the
[40:15] Blackness and the Darkness and the
[40:17] cloudiness of that and let the light of
[40:19] God shine down and encourage us and let
[40:22] us know that God's in the details of
[40:24] every one of our Lives Hallelujah
[40:28] let me just remind you when I went out
[40:29] there to Iowa last summer Malachi saw
[40:31] it the sister wanted to give me a suit
[40:34] and I didn't have a suit old not head
[40:37] brother Jess that's what they call me
[40:38] online not head brother Jess forgot my
[40:40] suit she said I'd like to give you a
[40:42] suit I'm like oh that's pretty nice
[40:45] praise God I probably won't probably
[40:46] won't fit me she said just been the back
[40:47] of her uh it's just been in the back of
[40:49] her trunk for all these months and well
[40:51] I just give the preacher a suit I
[40:53] thought well thank you sister I went
[40:55] home I you know I'm actually going to
[40:56] try this on' and it fit this it's not
[40:58] the one I'm wearing today but it fit
[41:00] perfectly church that means god ordained
[41:03] months ago that that woman would put
[41:05] that specific one not another one on a
[41:06] different size God knew every detail in
[41:08] my life he knew I'd forget the suit like
[41:11] a knead and he knew my exact size and he
[41:14] knew it it didn't even need trimmed up
[41:16] or anything it was perfectly cut to the
[41:18] right inch God cares about every hair of
[41:21] your head Hallelujah God cares about
[41:23] every inch of your life God's in it just
[41:25] keep serving God hallelujah amen amen
[41:29] just do the service of God just love God
[41:31] just praise God just serve him with all
[41:33] your heart soul mind and strength
[41:36] Hallelujah he's got he says one more and
[41:39] then he looked at Kip and said was not
[41:41] Malachi 3 the 4Runner to this man didn't
[41:45] god promise in Isaiah 40 and Malachi 3
[41:49] that God would send a forerunner to this
[41:53] Messiah brother said oh I'd like to have
[41:56] heard him quote that look at the
[41:59] prophecies Jesus is quoting to these
[42:04] brothers Hallelujah church that's what's
[42:07] going to lift your heart today you might
[42:10] be dishearted you might be sad or
[42:13] discouraged or frustrated with the
[42:14] economy or frustrated with uh politics
[42:17] or whatever more you might be
[42:18] discouraged by Family situations you
[42:20] might you might you might go through
[42:22] different things but what is going to
[42:23] encourage you is to see God actively
[42:26] working in your life whether you can see
[42:28] it behind the scenes or right in front
[42:31] of you seeing God is what we really need
[42:34] today Hallelujah to see God in our lives
[42:37] like I love when brother Nia told about
[42:39] how God healed him there that's seeing
[42:40] God in your life brother
[42:42] Nia Hallelujah to see God do
[42:46] it comes up for prayer God heals him he
[42:49] comes to testify about it a week or two
[42:51] later I I can't remember for sure but
[42:53] that's seeing God right there God's
[42:55] moving right there in your life and when
[42:57] we see that it gives us
[42:59] hope it gives us a new vision it
[43:02] dissolves our doubts it makes us
[43:04] remember God's the author of my life
[43:07] he's the author of my life he's the
[43:09] finisher of my life that means he's in
[43:11] the middle of my life
[43:13] too glory to
[43:20] God now let's get back to the
[43:23] scripture verse 27 in the beginning at
[43:25] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[43:27] them in all the scriptures the things
[43:28] concerning himself now see I could have
[43:30] went and got 100 more verses Jesus
[43:31] fulfilled I could have preached to them
[43:33] but I just preached brother Ram's
[43:35] quotes there was
[43:37] hundreds and Jesus had two hours wasn't
[43:39] it that that's right y'all remember
[43:41] learning that Copus because y remember
[43:42] learning that sinagogue that's right and
[43:45] so with each one it's like amen stranger
[43:47] amen stranger amen that's right yeah
[43:50] amen now you for you is amen Pastor Amen
[43:53] brother
[43:54] Irvin Amen brother Simon
[43:58] Amen brother
[43:59] Brian God's trying to get you to say
[44:01] Amen to the word
[44:03] hallelujah then you get strength and you
[44:05] get encouraged Hallelujah you start
[44:07] seeing things differently your sadness
[44:09] starts leaving can I say like this your
[44:11] human foolishness starts leaving and the
[44:13] wisdom of God comes into your heart
[44:15] Hallelujah that anointing of foolishness
[44:18] that we all get I'm talking about in our
[44:19] human Minds our human flesh it all
[44:23] begins to leave
[44:25] us so Jesus preaches about
[44:28] Jesus and they still don't know who he
[44:31] is who is this preacher man he should
[44:34] have been a priest all these years I
[44:36] wish he was the leader of my
[44:37] synagogue this guy can tie it all
[44:40] together man this guy
[44:44] Hallelujah Glory verse 28 and they drew
[44:47] nigh unto the village so after a six or
[44:50] seven mile
[44:52] walk Malachi's been going on walks here
[44:54] so he kind of has an idea my wife and I
[44:56] go for a two mile walk walk in the
[44:58] spring summer and fall every Friday so
[45:00] we kind of know what a two- mile walk's
[45:02] like uh triple that by God's
[45:05] grace they started drawing nigh to EMAs
[45:08] where they went and made as though he
[45:11] would have gone further so now this
[45:13] preacher who just laid out scores of
[45:15] verses acts like he's going to leave
[45:19] them right he acts like he's going to
[45:21] leave and so what happens when uh what
[45:24] happens when it feels like the spiritual
[45:27] blessing is going to leave the Bible
[45:28] said in verse 29 that they constrained
[45:31] him to
[45:33] stay and church this is what we need to
[45:35] remember they constrain him said you got
[45:38] to you got to come in you I want to
[45:40] spend more time with you oh that's what
[45:42] Lydia did remember that Lydia lyia lyia
[45:44] told that to Paul God opened her heart
[45:45] and said Paul could you please come and
[45:47] come over to my
[45:48] house that's how I know somebody's
[45:50] really opening their heart to God they
[45:52] want to have more Bible study they want
[45:53] to have more sermons or they want to
[45:55] have more prayer something like that I'm
[45:57] talking about when they're first Saved
[45:59] right right even if you get a Revival
[46:01] you'll want more of the word you'll get
[46:02] more more word more promises more uh
[46:05] sermons to listen to and they said abide
[46:08] with us for it's toward evening the day
[46:10] is far spent and he went in to ter with
[46:13] him so he makes excuses you know hey
[46:14] it's kind of dark why don't you stay
[46:15] with us don't leave us I don't want this
[46:18] to end and church that should be our
[46:20] desire when we walk out that door God
[46:21] let me take this anointing with
[46:23] me don't let me get distracted by other
[46:26] things don't let let me distracted by
[46:27] other problems and things going on life
[46:30] Stay With Me Jesus let your spirit
[46:31] remain on me praise
[46:34] God help me to see you on the job help
[46:36] me to see you at the restaurant or where
[46:38] the grocery store wherever I go in my
[46:40] home let me see you there stay with me
[46:41] Lord something's different about today I
[46:43] heard the word of God say my heart's
[46:45] been open my heart was burning God keep
[46:48] this burning with me
[46:50] Hallelujah let me have a burning a
[46:53] continual burning how many know that's
[46:55] called a Living Sacrifice now there we
[46:57] go make your life a living sacrifice
[47:00] unto God the Bible said present your
[47:03] body a Living Sacrifice keep your life
[47:06] as a sacrifice on the altar of
[47:10] God so that's how you keep the burning
[47:13] every day is a sacrifice every day make
[47:14] a sacrifice to love God to worship God
[47:17] to praise
[47:20] God verse 30 and it came to pass as he
[47:23] sat at meat with them he took bread and
[47:25] blessed it and break it and gave it to
[47:27] them and their eyes were open and they
[47:29] knew him and he vanished out of their
[47:32] sight this is a special kind of a friend
[47:34] right here special kind of a stranger
[47:36] special
[47:38] preacher I love it they pray before they
[47:41] eat the bread they just walk six or
[47:43] seven miles Jesus prays I bless this
[47:46] food I break it they get the bread and
[47:49] then now he vanishes right out of their
[47:51] sight they're Wonder am I having a dream
[47:53] is this a is this a dream oh God if it
[47:56] is uh let me me stay in this dream
[47:57] praise God don't let me wake up from
[47:58] this dream this preacher this this word
[48:02] preacher point me to the word and
[48:03] prophecy oh don't let this
[48:06] end but Jesus then
[48:10] vanishes and then verse 32 and then they
[48:13] said one to another did not our heart
[48:15] burn within us while he talked us with
[48:17] us by the way and while he opened to us
[48:19] the
[48:20] scripture so see that's what happens in
[48:22] a sermon if you're really hungering for
[48:24] God God will open up a verse to knew you
[48:27] so you understand it like what is
[48:29] blasphemy brother Chris that happened in
[48:30] January remember right what that's what
[48:33] God does he opens up a scripture oh now
[48:36] I got it and that's when your heart's
[48:38] burning
[48:40] Hallelujah but you got to be hungry for
[48:42] the word you got to be ready for the
[48:44] word see they were ready for the word
[48:45] they were talking about the word church
[48:47] let's keep our thoughts and our words on
[48:49] God's
[48:51] word you know as as a pastor over all
[48:53] these years I see people they come in
[48:55] they get excited about my Ministry or or
[48:57] guest Ministries and then pretty soon
[48:58] they get tired of it what happened at
[49:01] one time their hearts were burning and
[49:03] then their hearts aren't burning
[49:04] something happened in there
[49:06] church and it's our duty when we see the
[49:09] word is not as important to me it's our
[49:11] duty to get back to our first love
[49:13] Hallelujah that's our duty we're all
[49:15] going to battle with it we all got to go
[49:17] through it but let's do something about
[49:19] it praise God
[49:23] Amen so I love that Jesus they they they
[49:26] plead with Jes to come in he breaks the
[49:28] bread then he vanishes and they said our
[49:31] hearts were burning while this man
[49:34] preached to us so we see it's the
[49:37] burning that gives understanding for the
[49:40] journey or for the
[49:42] service or it's we'd say it's burning to
[49:45] revive your hope in your
[49:47] service this my whole life wasn't in
[49:50] vain right this last week wasn't in vain
[49:54] things are not out of cater everything
[49:56] in the right order God's plan is
[49:59] perfection Hallelujah brother said Jesus
[50:02] won't be one minute late on the Rapture
[50:04] brother R says that quote nothing is out
[50:07] of cater
[50:09] Hallelujah God knew he'd be here in two
[50:12] 2025 so let's have hearts that are
[50:14] burning in 2025
[50:17] Hallelujah
[50:19] Glory why can't it burn like it's uh
[50:23] 2001 again when I first heard the
[50:25] message why can't it burn like that it
[50:26] can because Jesus is the reason for my
[50:28] burning so he's the same yesterday today
[50:32] and forever praise God you named the
[50:35] year when you got saved you named the
[50:36] year when you got the holy ghost or
[50:37] whatever more you named that year why
[50:39] can't you burn like that you can
[50:43] Hallelujah because God will give you the
[50:45] burning to start you out God will give
[50:47] you the burning to keep you from
[50:48] quitting God will give you the burning
[50:50] to restore your vision to give you
[50:52] Clarity to bring back the joy for your
[50:54] service Hallelujah
[50:57] that's
[50:58] right bless
[51:02] you so what does he do after they vanish
[51:05] verse 33 what do they do and they rose
[51:08] up the same hour and returned to
[51:10] Jerusalem and returned I'm sorry and
[51:12] found the 11 gathered together and them
[51:14] that were with them saying the Lord is
[51:16] risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon
[51:19] and they told what things were done in
[51:21] the way and how he was known in the
[51:23] breaking of
[51:25] bread now this is a very famous
[51:27] scripture they didn't know Jesus till he
[51:29] broke the
[51:31] bread they didn't know it was him
[51:33] because that's how he always broke it in
[51:34] other words he's breaking food so that
[51:37] it can be blessed and the people can eat
[51:39] that's how he's known and then they tie
[51:42] that in with the heart's burning of the
[51:45] scripture so for us that means when the
[51:48] word of God it just doesn't mean our
[51:50] hearts burn when we take communion
[51:51] although I hope it does it should if
[51:54] you're a real child of God hallelujah
[51:55] you want you want life to be pleasing to
[51:57] God but it means for us that Jesus known
[52:00] when the word is bringing forth when the
[52:02] word's coming forth in understanding and
[52:04] you're understanding it and you're
[52:06] receiving it that shows it's God's
[52:07] presence God's presence is giving you
[52:09] the spirit of judgment and the spirit of
[52:11] burning and that should set our hearts
[52:13] on
[52:16] fire
[52:19] yes and see now they know he's risen
[52:22] indeed now I can believe those sisters
[52:24] because a preacher come along and give
[52:26] me 20 or more verses and show me
[52:28] everything that I thought was chaos was
[52:30] all ordained by God almighty God is in
[52:34] control of my
[52:36] life God has not left me behind my
[52:39] failures don't hinder God ah my mistakes
[52:42] won't stop the plan of God God's plan is
[52:45] going to be accomplished Hallelujah and
[52:47] I'm a part of it because I'm a believer
[52:49] I'm a disciple I believe in the word of
[52:51] God
[52:52] hallelujah that's
[52:54] right no matter what goes comes or goes
[52:57] one thing's for sure we'll still believe
[52:59] in the word of God we know prophecy will
[53:01] be our guide
[53:06] Hallelujah that wasn't prophecy the
[53:08] guide on the day of Pentecost what did
[53:09] Peter say did Peter say boy this is that
[53:12] which the Pharisees talked about that's
[53:14] not what he
[53:15] said this is that what my uh my great
[53:18] grandpa talked about no he said this is
[53:21] that what Joel
[53:22] said in the last days I'll pour out my
[53:26] spirit Upon Our flesh oh right church I
[53:29] hope brother Austin I hope we learned I
[53:30] hope we live to see it where we can say
[53:32] this is the for this is the we've had
[53:34] the former and this is the latter rign
[53:37] Hallelujah where we can quote Joel 223
[53:40] through 26 where we can say wow the word
[53:43] of God is being fulfilled this day the
[53:46] scripture is fulfilled our hearts are
[53:48] burning God's word is being fulfilled in
[53:50] our lives hallelujah
[53:53] amen how's he known in the breaking of
[53:55] bread now I'm also applying this to the
[53:56] mysteries of God because there's 12
[53:58] pieces of
[53:59] bread Hallelujah in the in the in the
[54:02] Holy place the shoe
[54:04] bread this is how I know Jesus led me to
[54:07] write that
[54:08] book because Mysteries are like an under
[54:11] bread the Bible calls those 12 pieces
[54:13] the bread of his presence the bread of
[54:16] his face so when did Copus and his
[54:19] friend uh recognized it was Jesus while
[54:21] he was breaking the
[54:22] bread how do we know Jesus in this
[54:25] message because we know God is one
[54:27] person Hallelujah we know the Rapture is
[54:30] pre-tribulation we know there's seven
[54:32] Church
[54:33] ages we know the Seven Seals have been
[54:36] revealed we know the Roman Catholic
[54:38] Church is the mother Harlot and we know
[54:41] Jesus Christ has more than a church he's
[54:43] got a bride hallelujah
[54:45] amen oh my glory to God oh my how was he
[54:50] known he was known in the breaking of
[54:52] bread the understanding of the word is
[54:55] given to them them that's what happened
[54:58] to me brother Chris when they first
[54:59] showed me they first showed me brother
[55:01] Ram's Ministry in the Bible they said
[55:03] John the Baptist had to prepare prepare
[55:05] prepare brother Ram's Ministry is
[55:07] restore restore restore and Bible verses
[55:10] for both Hallelujah and then when they
[55:13] show me water baptism was father son
[55:15] holy ghost in Matthew 28 and then you go
[55:17] to the book of Acts every time it's Lord
[55:19] Lord Jesus Jesus Christ so father son
[55:21] Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ and
[55:24] brother Chris the understanding starts
[55:26] opening oh oh you can understand this
[55:28] Bible oh my heart was burning
[55:31] hallelujah oh my there uh uh there is a
[55:35] Rapture it's
[55:37] pre-tribulation oh my there is a false
[55:40] church thank God there's a true
[55:43] church oh hell hell is does not last
[55:46] eternally uh you you can't have you
[55:49] can't you you you you you can't burn
[55:51] eternally unless you have eternal life
[55:53] so hell's not Eternal that makes total
[55:57] sins and where was I chosen I was chosen
[56:00] in Christ before the foundation of the
[56:03] world I've always been his son I just
[56:07] didn't recognize it till I was 19 years
[56:09] old brother Chris it took me 19 years
[56:11] old 19 years to get it but when I
[56:13] finally got it it was revealed to me it
[56:15] was open to me and now we believe it now
[56:17] we see God training us up as sons and
[56:20] daughters
[56:28] Glory how is Jesus known he's known in
[56:32] the breaking of
[56:34] bread I want you to see this
[56:37] here Jesus I want I just say this
[56:40] plainly here Jesus called them fools
[56:42] because all his true children he rebukes
[56:46] okaya put up uh Revelation 3:18 19 and
[56:53] 20 in Copus story it's a the type of the
[56:57] leoan church
[57:00] age because they're blinded they can't
[57:02] see and then God helps them see Jesus
[57:05] rebukes them and then they get on fire
[57:08] after
[57:09] that hallelujah it's a type of the the
[57:11] lean Church age true love will give you
[57:14] a rebuke well you're wrong on this you
[57:16] need to get straightened out on that
[57:18] that's true
[57:20] love Revelation 3:18 I counsel me to buy
[57:24] of me gold tried in the fire that that
[57:26] thou mayest be rich white raymen that
[57:27] they M they mayest be clothed and that
[57:29] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[57:31] and anoint them thine eyes with isav
[57:34] that thou mayest see now the whole time
[57:36] they can't see it's Jesus brother Austin
[57:37] they can't see it's like they got their
[57:39] eyes are covered over right they can't
[57:41] even see it's Jesus so they're in a leot
[57:43] to see and condition hey look look
[57:45] they're they're rich increased with
[57:46] goods and they have need of nothing
[57:48] right they're wretched miserable they're
[57:50] blind they can't even see what's going
[57:54] on so what happened Jesus has to come to
[57:57] them go to verse 19 as many as I love I
[58:01] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[58:04] and repent that's why he calls them
[58:06] fools because they're blind to the
[58:09] scriptures and church they went to
[58:11] church more Faithfully than probably you
[58:12] or
[58:14] I they they probably read their Scrolls
[58:17] probably more faithful than some of us
[58:20] and Jesus rebuked them and said
[58:22] fools you're so slow to believe the
[58:25] Bible that you read read the church said
[58:28] amen to me too I'm slow to believe
[58:29] sometimes too I want to be more quick to
[58:31] believe but it's going to take God it's
[58:33] going to take the preacher a preacher is
[58:35] preaching to us hallelujah the Holy
[58:36] Ghost so see they're blinded Jesus gives
[58:39] a
[58:40] rebuke and then they would have repented
[58:43] because they run down they go back to
[58:47] Jerusalem and they say that Jesus the
[58:49] Lord is risen indeed now think about
[58:51] that they just walked seven miles what
[58:53] would motivate them to walk seven more
[58:56] it had to been the joy of the Lord he's
[58:59] risen indeed we we haven't been deceived
[59:02] Our Lives aren't in vain we didn't
[59:04] follow some some some mythical thing we
[59:06] follow the truth God's word is real we
[59:09] saw
[59:10] Jesus we heard Jesus preach Jesus fed us
[59:13] bread he's alive so I have enough
[59:16] strength to walk seven more miles
[59:22] Hallelujah see but they had to get
[59:24] rebuked
[59:26] and they had to realize they're blind
[59:28] unless God opens their eyes Church you
[59:30] and I you can read you can read 10
[59:33] chapters a day let me just be kind but
[59:36] until God opens our eyes we ain't going
[59:37] to see it we're not going to see it
[59:39] until God opens our eyes and that's how
[59:41] God is always planned it because God
[59:44] wants to be glorified man's not God will
[59:47] never share his glory with another man
[59:49] or woman
[59:51] Hallelujah but you keep feeding on this
[59:53] keep feeding on this until God makes it
[59:55] a re reality in our
[59:57] lives stay with God's word how many want
[59:59] to stay with it by God's
[1:00:02] grace that's right we're our start an
[1:00:05] hour later like boy that's a long sermon
[1:00:07] boy just like on the road toas
[1:00:08] Hallelujah I'm fulfilling the scripture
[1:00:11] today so notice they couldn't see but
[1:00:15] Jesus opens their eyes they needed isav
[1:00:17] to
[1:00:18] see Jesus rebuked them and then verse 20
[1:00:23] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[1:00:25] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:00:26] I'll come in and we St with him and he
[1:00:28] with me now Jesus didn't knock but he
[1:00:30] was basically knocking on their hearts
[1:00:31] the whole time while he's preaching to
[1:00:32] them walking toaz he's basically
[1:00:34] knocking the whole time then he wants to
[1:00:36] see are you going to invite me in see
[1:00:39] Church you got to take this feeling and
[1:00:41] you got to take it home with
[1:00:43] you if not it's not going to do you any
[1:00:46] good that's what James 1 says James 1
[1:00:49] says if you hear the word and forget
[1:00:51] what you heard it's vain worship you
[1:00:54] have to take the preaching Hess with you
[1:00:56] and the church
[1:00:57] said
[1:00:59] Hallelujah so see Jesus wants to come in
[1:01:02] and eat show you the word here's what it
[1:01:05] really means here's the understanding
[1:01:07] for your life here's the scripture for
[1:01:09] your life
[1:01:13] Hallelujah let's read that James chapter
[1:01:21] 1 verse 22 James 1:22 be ye doers of the
[1:01:25] word not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:01:27] self so see you we deceive ourselves if
[1:01:29] we just hear a sermon and it doesn't
[1:01:31] help us or does we don't take it out of
[1:01:33] this church we've deceived ourselves
[1:01:35] that's an awful place to be
[1:01:38] in we have to have such an a burning
[1:01:41] experience where we know we're going to
[1:01:42] take what we heard we're going to take
[1:01:44] it out there with us into the world
[1:01:46] praise God like I was so encouraged
[1:01:48] remember a few weeks ago I I said uh hey
[1:01:50] I didn't say hey but that's my regular
[1:01:53] talk I was saying you know fine do
[1:01:55] something something for God do remember
[1:01:57] I was saying that do something for God
[1:01:58] find something to do and I was
[1:01:59] encouraged last week people were helping
[1:02:01] clean and everything like that I was so
[1:02:02] encouraged everybody waited their turn
[1:02:04] to eat let all the guests go
[1:02:07] first I appreciate that that's doing
[1:02:10] something for God that that showed me
[1:02:12] that people are listening to what is
[1:02:13] preached and then they go act on it
[1:02:15] praise
[1:02:17] God you see something that needs help
[1:02:19] fix it help out praise God be a help be
[1:02:22] a blessing be about the father's
[1:02:25] business praise God God we're here to
[1:02:26] serve one another praise God we're here
[1:02:29] to love one another that's just a good
[1:02:31] fresh reminder about how you want to
[1:02:33] hear the word and then you want to go
[1:02:35] act on it you want to do something about
[1:02:38] what you
[1:02:40] heard that's why I tell these kids of
[1:02:42] first grade that's why I signed homework
[1:02:44] they're like Mr Smith do we have
[1:02:46] homework again tonight I'm like yes
[1:02:50] they're like why because science has
[1:02:52] proven if you forget about a topic and
[1:02:54] you go think about it later that night
[1:02:55] night it causes all those nerve
[1:02:58] receptacles to make more connections it
[1:03:01] expands your memory it puts what's in
[1:03:04] your short term into your long term
[1:03:07] that's why homework's so important do
[1:03:09] you think it's any different for the
[1:03:10] Bible no you better give yourself some
[1:03:12] homework praise God I'm not going to
[1:03:14] sign it like Jeffersonville I'm not
[1:03:15] going to sign you wi tape to listen to I
[1:03:18] could but I'm not going to maybe someday
[1:03:21] I will just for you know just for some
[1:03:23] fellowship but you have to give yourself
[1:03:25] homework I'm going to go home and I'm
[1:03:27] going to take this anointing with me I'm
[1:03:29] gonna take Jesus home with me Hallelujah
[1:03:32] I want to eat with Jesus the Same Jesus
[1:03:33] that fed me here as he talked to us
[1:03:35] along the way I want to take that same
[1:03:37] Jesus come into my house let's up let's
[1:03:40] talk about the word of
[1:03:42] God that's right
[1:03:44] Church let's not deceive
[1:03:46] ourselves we are not better Christians
[1:03:49] if we forget what we heard on Sunday
[1:03:51] morning or Wednesday night we're not you
[1:03:53] are not I'm not a better Christian if I
[1:03:55] forget what I preached Hallelujah that's
[1:03:58] why it's so important to me to follow up
[1:04:00] with your questions if you have a
[1:04:01] question or something like that I'm
[1:04:02] trying my best I want to follow up with
[1:04:05] that so we can answer the questions or
[1:04:07] we can go deeper in the things of God so
[1:04:09] we can meditate on the ways of the
[1:04:12] Lord
[1:04:14] hallelujah I did not set a timer what
[1:04:17] time did I
[1:04:19] start okay oh that's lightweight
[1:04:22] preaching right
[1:04:24] there I'll try to finish up
[1:04:27] here so notice Jesus comes in and he sus
[1:04:30] with them just like he says in the lean
[1:04:34] message it's a beautiful type of our any
[1:04:37] leoan condition we're blind we need to
[1:04:40] rebuke there it is the spirit of
[1:04:41] judgment right Spirit of judgment
[1:04:42] rebukes us we're blind we don't know
[1:04:44] what we're talking about we can't see it
[1:04:46] rebukes us and the spirit of burning
[1:04:48] comes in he brings the word into us into
[1:04:50] our personal gathering in our personal
[1:04:52] fellowship with him our hearts burn for
[1:04:54] more of God there it
[1:04:57] is now let me give you some of you
[1:04:59] scientists or some of you uh bonfire
[1:05:01] people if you like doing bonfires let me
[1:05:03] give you some science here the burning
[1:05:05] there means to set on fire our hearts
[1:05:08] were set on fire our hearts were
[1:05:10] consumed with
[1:05:11] fire this was a burning in the human
[1:05:14] Spirit due to a true understanding or
[1:05:16] opening of the scriptures about Jesus
[1:05:18] and their current
[1:05:20] lives how many know uh Proverbs 27:17
[1:05:24] says iron sharpened
[1:05:26] iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance
[1:05:29] of his friend
[1:05:31] Hallelujah now Church We complain when
[1:05:33] it gets a 100 well I shouldn't say all
[1:05:35] of us some of us complain when it gets
[1:05:37] 100 degrees out there we feel like we're
[1:05:39] going to
[1:05:40] melt but to sharpen iron it takes a
[1:05:44] th000
[1:05:45] degrees Celsius this says no Fahrenheit
[1:05:49] 1,00 to 1300 degrees fah to sharpen iron
[1:05:53] now this ought to give us a little clue
[1:05:54] here are we Sharp happening one another
[1:05:56] or not we have to make sure we talk
[1:05:57] about Jesus it's okay to talk about we
[1:06:00] talk about you know how things are going
[1:06:02] but we need to get the conversations
[1:06:03] back to Jesus because that's how it gets
[1:06:05] sharpened it gets sharpened in hot
[1:06:07] conversations where you start sharing
[1:06:09] things about the word of
[1:06:11] God
[1:06:13] hallelujah hallelujah I'm the one I got
[1:06:15] to get better at that too I got to find
[1:06:16] a way to bring Jesus into the
[1:06:18] conversation
[1:06:20] Glory that's how we sharpen one another
[1:06:23] right we got to it's a hot experience
[1:06:25] it's a burning
[1:06:28] experience like just for certain
[1:06:30] examples remember brother Austin was
[1:06:31] sharing he gave a testimony about
[1:06:33] witnessing to that woman you know that's
[1:06:34] an example of like a burn like ah he's
[1:06:36] on fire burn that burns me up too
[1:06:39] Glory you know something like that where
[1:06:42] you you're testifying about what God's
[1:06:45] done God has done something fresh in
[1:06:47] your life and it's it's consumed your
[1:06:49] thoughts amen there it is it's consumed
[1:06:51] your
[1:06:52] thinking now everybody's getting tired
[1:06:54] here so bear with me here I got Grace So
[1:06:56] forging and shaping iron takes 1,00 to a
[1:07:00] 13 degree 1300 degrees
[1:07:02] fahit if you cut it cut it with a chisel
[1:07:05] it needs to be 1,800 to 2200 degrees
[1:07:09] Fahrenheit now the average bonfire
[1:07:11] church is 600 to 1100 degrees Fahrenheit
[1:07:15] so we've had some bonfires at our house
[1:07:16] right some really big fires almost
[1:07:17] burned down the tree one time that was
[1:07:20] because of foolishness oh
[1:07:22] fools but church I'm sure you've all
[1:07:24] done it right When The Fire gets to its
[1:07:27] hottest when I throw sticks on there the
[1:07:30] heat is so powerful I have to turn my
[1:07:31] face away how many know what I'm talking
[1:07:33] about it's so hot that's the natural
[1:07:37] that's how hot a thousand degrees is at
[1:07:39] the very hot I just got to walk away
[1:07:41] because I feel like my face is on
[1:07:43] fire that's that's what this word means
[1:07:46] it's a
[1:07:47] burning and that's what we need the
[1:07:49] spirit of God to preach something to us
[1:07:52] so and we believe it and it burns down
[1:07:54] in our heart and then we can share it
[1:07:56] with somebody else by the grace of God
[1:07:58] amen hallelujah oh God oh God give us
[1:08:03] testimonies give us some more
[1:08:04] testimonies by God's grace of witnessing
[1:08:06] to friends God make our hearts to
[1:08:10] burn like it did on the road to Emmas it
[1:08:14] just kept getting greater and greater
[1:08:15] and church when is our services going to
[1:08:17] take a little higher
[1:08:19] step you know you know we go through
[1:08:21] Seasons right when is it when our hearts
[1:08:24] start burning from more of God's word
[1:08:27] that's when it's going to take a higher
[1:08:29] step
[1:08:31] Hallelujah but see it's just human
[1:08:32] nature sometimes everything's become
[1:08:34] common but then sometimes church it's
[1:08:36] got to come back to fiery hearts that
[1:08:38] are on fire for Christ everybody with me
[1:08:44] Hallelujah I know I'm preaching to the
[1:08:46] bride Hallelujah I
[1:08:47] know I'm
[1:08:49] thankful the Bible said he opened their
[1:08:53] understanding and notice Church a heart
[1:08:56] burning will cause you to rise up and do
[1:08:58] something about it that's verse 33 Luke
[1:09:01] 24:33 Lydia and they rose up the same
[1:09:04] hour they didn't wait they rose up that
[1:09:06] same hour and tried to do something
[1:09:08] about the fire that was in their hearts
[1:09:11] I've got to go back I've got to go back
[1:09:13] and witness I've got to go share the
[1:09:15] truth with them even if it's walking
[1:09:17] another three hours now of course it
[1:09:18] would have been a lot faster they're
[1:09:19] probably they're probably walking real
[1:09:21] fast this was probably the two-hour walk
[1:09:23] the other one might have been three or
[1:09:24] maybe two and a half
[1:09:26] this would have been a lot faster CU I
[1:09:28] we just seen Jesus and now we know who
[1:09:30] was preaching to us the whole time he
[1:09:33] was hiding himself but then he revealed
[1:09:35] himself and we know he's alive
[1:09:37] Hallelujah he even appeared to Simon
[1:09:39] Peter Hallelujah he appeared to those
[1:09:44] sisters see a heartburn I'll say like
[1:09:48] this will cause you to get out of bed in
[1:09:49] the morning I'm not talking about if you
[1:09:51] worked really harder than the previous
[1:09:52] night I'm talking about when you get to
[1:09:54] bed at a good time I'm not talking about
[1:09:56] working third shift our brother Chris is
[1:09:57] so kind he's like I try to get up after
[1:09:59] working third shift yes that's wonderful
[1:10:01] I'm talking about just in your daily
[1:10:03] life when you get enough rest what gets
[1:10:04] you out of bed in the morning it should
[1:10:06] be the fires of God to get up and have
[1:10:09] fellowship or communion with God if you
[1:10:11] can I know some of the mothers can't
[1:10:12] always do that because they got crying

[1:10:44] will
[1:10:46] do and then a burning heart will make
[1:10:48] you want to tell others about it verse
[1:10:50] 35 and they told what things were done
[1:10:52] in the way how he was known of them and
[1:10:54] the breaking of bread and they'd be like
[1:10:56] yeah that's cleop yeah right I remember
[1:10:58] Jesus broke the bread that's when he
[1:10:59] multiplied it remember that I knew it
[1:11:01] was a miracle Jesus did it the same
[1:11:03] exact way and that's what we can say oh
[1:11:05] it was the same spirit that same Holy
[1:11:07] Spirit came in our service preached the
[1:11:09] same way my heart got on fire I was
[1:11:11] moved to do something I was led to do
[1:11:14] something and I rose up brother Jesse

[1:12:55] of his
[1:12:57] presence church if Jesus is the same how
[1:13:00] many believe he's the same then he's
[1:13:02] trying to speak to every person here

[1:14:16] to know after all these years it's not
[1:14:18] the pastor it's not me I'm nothing I
[1:14:22] know I'm
[1:14:23] nothing it's it's God for he's making
[1:14:26] himself known by the revelation of his
[1:14:28] son Christ Jesus Grant these kind things
[1:14:33] Lord and lastly musicians can come okay
[1:14:36] uh
[1:14:37] Tor let's
[1:14:39] stand it is I Be not Afraid 1961 brother
[1:14:43] Ram said and on the road there come one
[1:14:46] stepping out from the side of the road
[1:14:48] and begin to speak to them explain the
[1:14:49] scriptures to them when he asked their
[1:14:51] sadness and their defeat so look Church
[1:14:54] they're in a defeated state if you came
[1:14:57] here defeated you don't have to leave
[1:14:59] here defeated in fact Jesus spirit is
[1:15:02] here today to give you
[1:15:05] Victory because that's what they were
[1:15:07] Copus and his friend were defeated but
[1:15:09] by the end of the sermon they had the
[1:15:10] victory praise God hallelujah
[1:15:15] amen and church he is the same yesterday
[1:15:19] today and
[1:15:20] forever he made as if he'd pass on by
[1:15:23] but they constrained him to come in so
[1:15:25] see you've got to constrain Jesus Jesus
[1:15:28] Come into my situation I need you in
[1:15:30] this family situation I need you in this
[1:15:33] sick situ my sickness I need you in my
[1:15:36] neighbor
[1:15:37] situation I need you my finances I need
[1:15:40] you in my
[1:15:41] health I need you you got to constrain
[1:15:45] him to stay with you and then you got to
[1:15:47] go do something about
[1:15:49] it like they did the burning in their
[1:15:53] souls moved them to go do something
[1:15:55] about it
[1:16:00] Hallelujah and when Jesus got them
[1:16:02] inside and closed the door then he did
[1:16:05] something just like he did before his
[1:16:07] crucifixion and immediately they knew it
[1:16:09] was him he vanished out of their sight
[1:16:11] by some back door somewhere Jesus SS out
[1:16:14] the back door lighthearted now listen
[1:16:17] lighthearted and lightf
[1:16:19] footed they ran back to
[1:16:22] Jerusalem telling the people that true
[1:16:24] truly Jesus was still alive and they
[1:16:26] spake among themselves and said did not
[1:16:30] our hearts burn within us as he talked
[1:16:32] to us along the
[1:16:34] way so if you came in here and you could
[1:16:36] barely make it in like I wasn't watching
[1:16:38] how some you walked in but maybe you
[1:16:39] walked in like this oh I got to go to
[1:16:41] church again
[1:16:43] today gotta
[1:16:46] go well by the time the sermon was over
[1:16:48] Jesus or brother man said they were
[1:16:50] skipping along oh hallelujah praise God
[1:16:53] let's go let's go back and let's go tell
[1:16:55] about the Risen
[1:16:57] Messiah church I know there's times it's
[1:17:00] hard we all go through seasons of
[1:17:01] hardness when it's hard to come to
[1:17:02] church hard to read the Bible hard to
[1:17:04] pray hard to believe but that's why
[1:17:06] Jesus is here praise God to change our
[1:17:10] thinking to give us understanding and
[1:17:13] make a burning consume our heart our
[1:17:15] thoughts our desires to burn inside of
[1:17:18] our souls so we'll do something about
[1:17:20] our
[1:17:21] situation and not be disheartened not be
[1:17:24] dis scourage not be sad about
[1:17:27] it
[1:17:34] Hallelujah he says father I pray that
[1:17:36] you'll let him step out of these aisles
[1:17:38] tonight we only got one two three only
[1:17:41] got five
[1:17:42] aisles Jesus only has to walk through
[1:17:44] five aisles brother Chris that's it it's
[1:17:46] not a lot of aisles how many know he can
[1:17:48] do it
[1:17:49] today Lord let him step out of these
[1:17:53] aisles today into every heart and then
[1:17:56] talk to us in the next few minutes and
[1:17:58] then show himself may he stand on the
[1:18:01] platform and show himself that he's the
[1:18:03] same
[1:18:04] Jesus May the sick rush home quickly
[1:18:06] saying listen if you're sick saying did
[1:18:09] not our hearts B burn within us as the
[1:18:11] word went
[1:18:12] forth it was strange but something was
[1:18:14] talking to me all the time Grant it
[1:18:17] father that will raise I'm sorry that
[1:18:18] will praise thee as long as we live and
[1:18:20] always remember because we're sincerely
[1:18:22] asking it in the name of Jesus
[1:18:28] so let's take that attitude
[1:18:30] today if we're discouraged if we're sad
[1:18:33] if we're struggling if we're
[1:18:36] hopeless if we've lost our vision if
[1:18:39] we're uh
[1:18:40] confused may we be like those on the
[1:18:44] road to Mayas he said May the sick rush
[1:18:46] home saying did not our hearts burn
[1:18:47] within us may we leave these doors and
[1:18:50] say did not our hearts burn I don't have
[1:18:52] to be discouraged I don't have to be sad
[1:18:55] I don't have to be hopeless I don't have
[1:18:56] to be
[1:18:57] sick because he is talking today how
[1:19:00] many glad Jesus is talking today let's
[1:19:03] bow our heads for a word of prayer
