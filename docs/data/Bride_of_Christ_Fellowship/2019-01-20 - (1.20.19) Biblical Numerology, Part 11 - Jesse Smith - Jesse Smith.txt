get deeper more cut he medicine every heart result father were so grateful for all you've done less your people now Jesus Christ every set the family makes Dan I already make stand at home by magic you have your Bibles like to go to numbers chapter 14 I like to preach on part 11 of the biblical numerology series by the grace of all now I'm sorry with this scripture is kind of a negative scripture on Israel but remember Paul told us in 1st Corinthians 10 use everything about Israel for our example for our admonition so we got to look at negative examples and even gain wisdom from it just like jesus said remember Lot's wife so as we look at numbers 14 22 and 23 we'll be looking at the numbers 8 9 and 10 today by the grace of the Lord and of course this deals with number 10 now before today I didn't know brother Branham said this brother Graham said number 10 is a number of worldliness and I found it to be true as I studied the scriptures now of course 10 has a couple of different meanings so we'll look at that one of course we'll look at that one first then we'll look at the other meanings as well numbers 14 22 I like verse 20 they look at that like it but as truly as I live all the earth should be filled with the glory of the Lord amen we're just about there we're just about there the Millennium all the earth to be filled with the glory of the Lord verse 22 as all the men would have seen my glory and my vehicles which I did in Egypt and the witnessed and end to me now these ten times and have not hearkened my voice bless you surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their father neither shall any of them that provoked me see it Allegra verse 24 but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit in him have followed me fully him will I bring into the land where into he went and his seed shall possess it now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt the valley tomorrow turn you that you endured this there will be other Red Sea in Anna's less Iranian Board may be tête-à-tête bless you that's quite an encouraging Scripture we know it's a maybe a little bit sad for those multitude of Israelites that didn't did not possess the promised land but it's encouraging to see that Caleb and Joshua were the faithful and there was of course two of them out of the twelve so with that number 10 I think 10 has another meaning as well I'll be sharing that and they're just a little bit by the grace of the Lord but before we get that number 8 would 8 9 and 10 buy the piece of Lord would have much fun apron I will be quickly moving to number 10 now this is interesting I just brings out because I preach it yet but I just found it in the book that I've been reading by mr. Bellinger about numbers in Scripture he's looking at the number eight and he says eight can also mean abundance or super abundance to super abound as a part of a part of simple it means one who abounds in strength so it can mean super abundance or fertility and then the writer goes on to say as seven was so called because the seventh day was the day of completion and rest so eight as the eighth day was over and above the perfect completion as indeed the first of a new species well as being the eighth so we about the eight of course representing the New Jerusalem and so this gives the eighth gift the idea of a super abundance a new group and of course that's what the Nuge person is it's a new beginning by the grace of the Lord because we finished the first seven prophetic thousand-year days six thousand human history and then one thousand goddesses one thousand a honeymoon millennium period with his wife Christ in the in the church and then eight is this overabundance eight is the new day first day all over again praise God also it's interesting too I want to bring this just to our attention it may come up later that's why I'm preaching it now it just seems to be like this will have some impact later but eight is the first cubic number it's the cube of two so two times two times two is eight we've seen that three is the symbol of the first plane figure and then four is the first square number so in eight is the first cubic number and we see what the author calls transcendent perfection indicated something the length and the breadth and the height of which are equal so you see a cube and now the writer gives numerous examples of the cube for example the Ark was a cube of one cubit the window the ark rather was one by one by one the tabernacle was 10 cubits by 10 cubits by 10 cubits rather the holiest of holies was 10 by 10 by 10 so we see these cubes so it's just interesting 8 is the the first cube we would say and then also the temple let me see where this temple is here oh the temple Solomon's Temple was 20 by 20 by 20 the Holy of Holies there so Moses tabernacle was 10 by 10 by 10 and then which was a thousand cubic feet and then solomon's tabernacle was 20 by 20 by 20 which is 8,000 interesting now the New Jerusalem the dimension of the New Jerusalem on the pyramid are twelve thousand by twelve thousand by twelve the Houston that's the holy city so we're starting to see some cubic numbers and I just want to bring that out because like I said it may play a part later especially as we get to close to 20 s and then 12s and so forth so I hope that was a blessing there now I just have a few different thoughts on the number 8 so bear with me here jehovah talked to Abraham eight times and I could find in Scripture and I found this for through Ballinger and I went back and read all of them yesterday the first time was in Genesis 12 1 through 3 where God told Abraham to separate himself he was going to give him a nation of his seed and bless the world through Abraham that was the first time the second time Genesis 12:7 Abraham's seed has promised the land in Genesis 13 14 to 17 Abraham was given divine assurance of the land and the seed and God told him to rise and walk in the land and everything you see every place where your foot steps will be yours and now we all know how that applies to us right any promise of God in the Bible whether it's healing whether it's salvation whether it's your gift your minister any promise in the Bible that is given to us as a believer we have to take it foot step by foot step little by little and we've got to overcome everyday a little bit in order to possess those things I'm sure many of us have walked into healing it didn't maybe healing didn't happen the first day but after a couple days or three or four days eventually you walked into that healing or maybe your understanding of the person you should marry you didn't know right away but after prayer and meditation and day after day it you kind of walk into that promise you possess that promise like our sister gave that testimony of without praying for seven years for her husband I thought that was a wonderful thing that was a promise out there but she had to walk in it and just trust the Lord and and and not not straight to the left or right but just walk straight in the path of God's promise the fourth time God talked to Abram was Genesis 15 verses 13 to 21 and God gave Abram the divine boundaries of the land the physical boundaries of the land he also told him that his seed would be in Asia for 400 years and they would leave in the fourth generation theirs or theirs for deliverance I didn't even catch that yesterday amen so the fourth generation God would bring Israel out of Egypt so foreign there's a number for deliverance again and you write that down Lydia text that to me give your phone okay just text it to me just say Israel came out of Egypt on the fourth generation thank you I don't want to lose that you know in case I like I said I may write a book on that eventually one day we'll see number five Genesis 17 is the whole chapter 1 to 22 God promises Abraham divine essence-- again of the promise and he calls him to walk perfectly on the fifth call my grace gives him a name change on the fifth time tells him about circumcision and promise he gives promises for Sarah and Ishmael so finally on the fifth time he gets a name change and then serán Ishmael our our giver he's gonna yell their position in the process of God this visitation was in Genesis 18 9 233 it was the promise of the return presentation for Sarah's conceptions God visited and said I'm gonna return in the year according to the time of life and I'm gonna visit Sarah and she's going to have a son he also during this visit this of course the visit with the two other angels there was three messengers God and two angels this is the the visit the six visit God also revealed Sodom's destruction this was the visit where God said shall I hide anything from my my sermon Abraham who keeps all the commandments of God and this is of course when lots of the promised deliverance came when when the two messengers went down to Sodom and God stayed with Abraham and Abraham interceded for a lot this was also that time course which we believe was a horse shadow and God came in the prophetic son of man ministry of brother Branham it was the last sign the last visitation before the child arrived all right now the seventh one was genesis 21:2 12 and this is where God told Abram specifically to cast out the bondwoman and the son because Sarah had said that and Abram did Abraham didn't know what to do and the spiritual blessing would be headed up in the seed Isaac so that was the seventh visitation their eighth Genesis 22 15 to 18 Abraham's so the eighth and final visit was after Isaac would come on the scene and God told Abraham that his obedience this is after the test right after the test God said your obedience would produce blessings and the seed would possess the gates of their enemies praise God so those are the eight all right now I have one more 8 I want to show and I remember this from years ago preaching this probably about 5 years ago the life of Joseph in the Old Testament contained the stature of a perfect man because remember there were seven virtues in the statute for a man and the eighth was charity or love very good share your love so there are seven virtues God wanted to give each person before they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I remember this was also foreshadowed in the life of Joseph so let's go through each one first Joseph had faith or the revelation to speak his dreams God gave him that revelation to speak what he believed in what he saw that supernatural revelation second he had virtue he was morally sound he obeyed Jacob to seek his brothers a return with rapport but during that trip he sold into Egypt yet he chooses morality even the myths of the prison he chose morality which that's what virtue is its strength to live God's Word publicly in front of people that's what Joe did but did yeah it hurt you to live it in the prison so much so that he favored hard the third one was thought and so Joseph had knowledge or understanding to oversee all of out of her house and field and had prospered him greatly okay number four Joseph had temperance which is self-control we saw that when he was tempted by Potiphar's wife that evil woman tried to seduce him but he had temperance he had real holy spirit temperance he was able to turn down Potiphar his life patience number five is patience Joseph waited in prison for two years after being forgotten by the butler Baker that shows a lot of patience he didn't give up on God may have gotten discouraged but he overcame all that through the patience of God six he had godliness because the Bible said the Spirit of God is and Joseph who was Pharaoh that saw the Spirit of God in him so in order for him to be godly but God a spirit in him which even Pharaoh testified that's how we live is the children we should put such fate so people can see God in us we should be so gaudy with such godliness people know that we're true Christians and God is living in us even number seven this was the beautiful I mean these are all beautiful but this one especially beautiful seventh brother kindness Joseph forgives his brothers had sold them into Egypt and that's in Genesis 45 one is 16 what a beautiful type of the seventh virtue the virtue of brotherly kindness and number eights beautiful as well eight is charity and charity of course is love and that was when father Jacob and son Joseph embraced and had a holy kiss that's the type of Jesus receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost because brother Graham said heaven an earth kissed when the Holy See's it father and son you Nate while we are to turn unite with a Heavenly Father so you have the son uniting with the father and that's what happens at the baptism of the Holy Ghost the spirit of the father comes down and it joins or meets or kisses mr. piller that's us praise God amen beautiful all right all right let's look back to number nine a little bit further we've shown how 9 is fruit 9 is conservation it could mean finality or closure like we saw with doubting Thomas after night on the ninth day rather his doubts were all taken away because Jesus came and showed him as his nails and the nail scars on his hands feet and his side and I also represents judgment even as we saw as the gifts judge the church they keep the church clean now its interest 9 deals with judgments here's something new 9 is a factor of 666 so now I'm stopping for 666 I mean of course the mark of the beast the number of the Antichrist of course would be judgment on the world so that's interesting tonight as a factor of 666 this was new to me as well the first battle listed in the Bible between armies was in Genesis 14 and it's a battle between four kings and five kings which is 9 4 and 5 make 9 this is when the four kings defeated the five kings one of which was one of the ones that was victorious was China Chedorlaomer I always say that word and Iran check the layover so the four kings defeat of the five and then Abram brought 300 some servants and defeated those four kings 4 he's God so 9 was like a judgment 9 armies all were judged were all defeated by Abraham ultimately right because before defeated the five and then Abraham defeated the four so the war there represents judgment all right I've never seen this one before this was new to me in Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 there's the night watchman intrude on Israel because of her disobedience let's read that and I called for a drought upon the land so a drought first and then the drought was on the land the mountains the corn the new wine the oil upon that which the ground bringeth forth 6 upon the men's seventh upon the cattle 8 and upon all the labor of the hands 9 represent judgment I never seen that that was beautiful to see in the scripture this was new as well there's nine people recorded as being stoned in the Bible now some of them were justly some of them were unjustly and so we know sometimes men human men are sinners are allowed to to make wrong judgments of course most of their judgments are wrong so we'll look at that so there was a blasphemer who was stoned in Leviticus 24 14 the Sabbath breaker was stoned in numbers 1536 akin was stone and Joshua 7:25 or as that was just a bit Mallika was stoned and judges 953 I don't remember that once I can I can't make her comment on that one a Duran was stoned in first Kings twelve eighteen I don't remember that one maybethe was stoned in first Kings 21 ten that was wrong that was unjust Zechariah was stoned in second chronicles 24 21 I believe that was unjust Stephen was stoned in Acts chapter 7 that was of course unjust and then Paul was stoned in acts 14 19 but God gave him the overcoming grace to be raised from the dead amen because he fell down as one day so nine stonings in the Bible so we can see how 9 represents judgment and one more point on number 9 before we get to number 10 9 of course representing the fruit of the Spirit I thought it was very fitting that 9 is made by two factors three times three three represents divine things right perfection divine perfection and then and so 9 represents like a finality so 3 times 3 is 9 which makes fruit 9 is fruit the fruit or the finality of divine things I thought that was very fitting for gifts or sorry fruits of the Holy Spirit it's what divine things ultimately produce and of course that's what we know that's more important than anything else is having the fruit of the Spirit love is more important than all the other gifts course love is a fruit of the Holy Spirit because you can have all the gifts but without love doesn't profit as anything all right let me look at the battery real quick I forgot to plug it in okay good we're so 54% all right so we should be able to make it to the end of the service here and hopefully these things aren't blessing I I do appreciate the nice feedback from Wednesday night service the I got a couple texts said that they were really blessed by the Word of God so appreciate that and let's look at number 10 here by God's grace down brother Branham says number 10 is worldliness belanger says 10 is also divine order and I think there maybe this is my thought I think there could be number 10 as a faithful remnant as well I could be wrong on that but 10 looks like a could be a faithful remnant so we'll look at that but let's first look at worldliness brother Ram says 10 is worldliness now he's preaching and countdown 1962 and he says now I haven't tried to break this message down and give it a spiritual application as it would take too much time this morning but I want to try to explain this to you that 10 is the number of worldliness man and if you remember he said 10 is a number of worldliness man but 7 is a number of God's perfection 6 days he made the heavens and earth and the seventh arrested at six thousand years the world is the labor against sin or the church labor against sin and the seventh is the millennium or Sabbath so he just says it really really briefly that 10 is a number of worldliness and I thought well maybe it is so I went get up turn up it will s so the first one is in Genesis it was at 10 generations that God had got fed up in the world worldliness and destroyed the earth Adam Seth Enosh Cayden mahalia Jared Enoch Methuselah Lamech and Noah so on the 10th generation guy got fed up with the worldliness and destroyed the whole world interesting in Genesis 24 55 Rebecca's brother begged her stay with us about 10 days just stay with us 10 days her family stay with the things of the world rather than separate yourself and go out to meet your bridegroom right amen so he see a beautiful type in that that she's offered 10 days just wait 10 days but she said no I'm gonna go immediately I'm I'm excited I'm so joyful I'm so thankful I can go meet my bridegroom amen and that's what we've done we've left the things of the world as well praise God to meet Jesus Christ some more examples here 10 is worldliness in this fact that Laban changed to 8 is 10 times in Genesis 30:1 144 if it was thing it on BET here this time and he's - he's changed my wages ten times of course meaning part of this is Jacob reaping what he sowed right because he deceived his father he deceived his brother and now he's reaping what he sowed so the world is paying him back right his father-in-law is paying him back and his wages are changed ten times here's a really good one we already kind of mentioned earlier but 12 spies were sent to the promised land how many of them doubted how many had worldly doubt 10 of them Lord amen and that's numbers chapter 13 so it's very interesting that 10 keeps showing up and as our text was there were 10 times Israel tempted God in the wilderness and so because of those 10 times God swore they would not see the promised land so God didn't let me go 11 God didn't let it go 9 God said I'll let you intend if you knew then you won't take promise then so it's 10 robbers Ben moral eNOS this was bright as well this is a beautiful type how many toes Nebuchadnezzar's great image half that great image of the times of Jen's house the Bible said ad ten toes that's right and then that was in daniel 241 and then later in Daniel 7 Daniel sees the four beasts that represent those four divisions on the great image and then he sees the fourth beasts have ten horns then if you read your Bible in revelation 12:3 revelation 13:1 revelation 17:3 17 7 to 17 12 this beast has seven heads and ten horns and the Bible tells us the ten horns equal ten Kings which give their power to the Beast but then hates the great shortly after that so the ten represents worldliness ten worldly kings or kingdoms that are going to first unite with the Roman Catholic Church but then you come against her so hopefully everybody can see the tens there I got a couple more for worldliness in Deuteronomy 23 three and amirite I'm sorry an ammonite and Moabite would not enter into the congregation Lord even to the tenth generation they shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever now you know the reason they wouldn't be allowed in the the tabernacle is because all because of this that look how simple this is Israel was traveling through to the promised land and the ammonites and the Moabites would not give them bread or water so God said you can't come in the congregation your sins can be forgiven for ten generations which would be four hundred years no if you do 40 years for generation and also on top of that because they didn't get bread water and because they hired hello against Israel so there's three things God's because you've done that you won't go in the arch but you can your sins forgiven for ten generations I'll think about the other side of that Jesus you get a reward if you a cup of water in the name of the cycle hey see how much God cares enough just to be nice natural things for people feeding them giving them water giving them post they know sick as Hospital God cares so much about the small things well we think they're small but to God they're really great things but because the Moabites and the ammonites would not do the very little release things unto the least of god's children right God said I'm keeping you out for ten generations so that's Deuteronomy 23 - now I want you to see how brother branham grew in his understanding and maybe this will help some of us with our understanding in Deuteronomy 23 to relevance and a bastard child should not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation the more so any child that was born outside of marriage marriage or holy wedlock we'd say if they're born illegitimately before a vow and before a marriage ceremony God would not let them in for 10 generations that's how awful God thought about having sperm before marriage I think about people we know or friends you know our friends get older when that window with a little woman or man choose to have a child before they're married it is such a disgrace it was such a disgrace in the eyes of God to see how much God loves marriage see how much God loves waiting until you find the right person to marry 400 years God said that bastard child is not coming in the congregation that means cambrian offering bring a lamb Camrys sacrifice or hundred years course he would die well before that so they've lost they wouldn't have a bit of worship I wouldn't let them in their church now with interesting Church the children and church interesting is that brother Brandon literally preached for numerous years until 1861 I'll give you one example and he preaches so hard a couple of times that there's a letter brother Jose JB Henry my brother Graham where brother Brandon has to write a letter to a woman and assure her that God now does forgive mothers and fathers that have illegitimate children and and God still or God can save bastard children because brother Branham preaches so hard let me give you one example this was in Jeffersonville LeBron says statistics show in the United States that there is more illegitimate children born then there is holy wedlock children did you know the Bible said in Deuteronomy that illegitimate child it takes four hundred years for that to run out their children's children's children's children children cannot stand grandfather was the element child and now he's out of the picture now what he says show me where it was changed so brother rather this is to show that brother man was a man and he had to grow in understanding as well or the RAM said show me where it's changed show me where God now can let bastard children in the church this is a 1959 almost three years later at the end of 1960 brother brandon has the revelation that the blood of Jesus Christ now can forgive and save and also baptize a bastard child into the kingdom of God amen so that's why it's so important to take everything we say everything everything we hear brother Graham say back to the Bible so important this is in Shreveport Louisiana well the Graham said a high breeding was such a horrible thing in the Old Testament God said our child should not enter the congregation Lord for 10 generations there's nothing to breed him out only that sin think ten generations four hundred years before an illegitimate child can ever come in the kingdom of God there was no serum to take it out of him he just had to breed it out through the family four hundred years before legitimate child could come in the congregation the Wow that's striking that met the reproach of that sin was so awful that God said you can't come to church for four hundred years that's how awful that sin is and children that's how important the marriage decision is so important now here's where here's a ring he corrects right here but today since the blood of Jesus Christ has been shed and you've been interbred by all different kinds of ideas the Holy Spirit is here this morning to breed you back to the original bring you back to Pentecost to breed you back amen other than that yeah so the Holy Ghost breed breeds you spiritually back into God's family amen he said that we sit together this morning in heavenly places in Christ Jesus letting the Holy Spirit work what is circumcising cutting off all the hybrid all the surplus the things of the world the things of the church age bringing us back to Pentecost like it was at the beginning amen there's that promise for the latter rain hallelujah we're the true Bride of Christ will be restored back to the original faith the full promise rapturing faith to bring us back to the blood of Jesus Christ breaks that curse of ten generations amen now here's one I had not seen before I preached it in a different angle but in 1st Corinthians 6 9 and 10 there are 10 evils listed that will not inherit the kingdom of God now when I did if you remember this a couple years ago I took these ten I added them to the seven things in Matthew or Matthew 15 where Jesus said these seven things to file man and then I added them with the nine or ten sins that Paul wrote to the Galatians in Galatians chapter five and I came up with 23 three different sins that's what I came up with but if you just look at this one letter first Corinthians and the chapter six verse nine and ten Paul lists ten worldly sins that will not inherit the kingdom of God if not repent enough so the Bible says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters adulterers effeminate which means a man who had a boy for child molestation purposes nor abusers of themselves with mankind that's homosexual nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God I like verse 11 but such were some of you but you're wash you're justified you're sanctified by the spirit of our God amen thank God above Jesus Christ so that blood washes away those ten oh how are you those ten sins just like the blood washes away those ten generations of the bastard child hey I know yeah thank you lord none of Jesus Christ washes away all worldliness amen we're still going here a little bit longer to go a little bit more in Revelation 2 verse 10 under the submerging church age there was a prophecy in verse 10 revelation 2:10 Jesus had feared none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and he shall have tribulation how many day is ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life now the church age book look Brandon said this he says it like this he says here's a prophecy of ten days with it is a means of determining the lifespan of the Samarin age Diocletian the cruelest of all Emperor's launched a terror campaign against the saints of God that except for the mercy of God would have wiped out all Christians it was the bloodiest in history and lasted 10 years or 10 days from 302 ad to 312 ad so that gives me a new thought I hadn't thought of that then a day can also equal one year a day can also equal a thousand years because the Bible says that one day with man is a thousand years with the Lord but also one day can make ten years I'm sorry no one day can make one year sorry of course that was seen with Jacob working fulfilling the week right fulfilling the seven days yeah putting the seven days for Rachel which was seven years that's right so each day represented a year all right so see that worldliness in ten days why ten his 10 is a number of worldliness okay now this is interesting I just copy to paint the space of this straight from Bollinger there's ten persons who utter the confession I have sinned and acknowledge their and acknowledge their sin of these ten six were individual the number of a man and four were on behalf of the nation we so Pharaoh said I've sinned in Exodus 9:27 Balaam said I've sinned in numbers twenty to thirty four akin said I've sinned in Joshua seven twenty Saul said I've sinned it's for Samuel 15 20 for David said he had sinned with Bathsheba of course in second Samuel twelve thirteen Jimmy I said he had sinned in second Samuel 19 20 I believe that was the man who was mocking David as he left Jerusalem I'm not mistaken but then God brought him back to repentance amen Hezekiah said he had sinned in second Kings eighteen fourteen which also said I've offended God at the word might be offended in the King James job said he had sinned in job 720 Mike I said he had sinned and I'm sorry no Micah speaks of a said we have sinned in Micah seven nine and in Nehemiah Nehemiah praying said we have sinned and Nehemiah 1 verse 6 so seaworthiness I sin I've committed worldly crime I'm living according to the will of the world right so we see worldliness as number 10 10 I have sins or we have sin all right now let's switch over we were at tennis worldliness let's switch over to divine order so it's C times where God ordered with the number and events that was going to happen so the first one the most obvious is the divine order of the Ten Commandments there are 613 laws in the Old Testament but God said you can remember them just by Ten Commandments if you keep these ten no fulfill all the other ones so God gives the order that great bacon number God gives the order of ten so he wrote these ten with the finger of God no other gods before me make no graven image do not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain remember the Sabbath keep it holy which for us is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but of course also a day like today where we can just rest give the whole day to the Lord 5 honor your father and mother 6 do not kill 7 to the mountain do not commit adultery 8 do not steal 9 not bear false witness and then 10 do not covet and these 10 were all written by the finger of God God gave divine order to his people and to all the laws by giving a summary of 10 now it's interesting there's brother Branham said in the hidden life with Christ he said he said but inside the veil available for the hoist of voice there was an ark and in the ark was the tables the Ten Commandments as we call them and that represented the human heart so even God wrote one that those ten to represent or to be represented on the human heart which you know which makes sense you know God wouldn't expect us to memorize you know 613 laws but if we could memorize 10 that'd be a real blessing but 10 of those in our heart and if we do those 10 if we keep those 10 we would keep all the others so God one of those Ten Commandments in the Ark just like God wants just a simple summary in our hearts now we know the Bible also says Jesus says that all the laws fulfilling this one thing what is that no love is the fulfillment of the whole mall that's what paul says as well so when you love when you really just love people you'll never want to do anything wrong against them boys street than the way you want to be treated when you've got the love of God in your heart okay let's look at more of divine order now this is interesting God sent ten plagues against Egypt and in Exodus 914 God said all my plagues so there was no other plagues there was just ten plagues which shows God had a divine order a series of steps in order to break this this King right Pharaoh godless you use this divine order first was water to blood then frogs then lice then fleas then disease cattle and then boils on their human on their bodies and then hail and then locusts then darkness and lastly the death of the firstborn interesting in the the firstborn is like a tithe to the Lord as well there's another tenth so God gave that order ten steps it had to be in that order and the tenth one finally broke Pharaoh after he saw his firstborn died he said finally get out of here and that's where mother Graham said you can live so close to God that Satan won't know what to do with you amen Moses lives so close to God and the Pharaoh didn't the devil and Pharaoh didn't want anything to do with him and so he kicked him out that's how we want to live we live so close to God they won't know what to do with us no matter what temptation comes we cast it down we just say so in love with Jesus sort of order to Jesus that saint won't know what to do amen praise God now this is interesting divine order la easer travel with ten camels to bring back Rebecca and her maidens so Rebecca could be a bride for Isaac remember camels represent beasts or power that's interesting ten camels had to pack all all over Becca's items and all the items of the maidens God used ten so that's interesting ten here's a one about tithing ten represents a tithe so Abraham as he received the whole victory I'm sorry Abraham freely gave milk as like a tenth as he realized the whole victory came from the God's divine order so God had ordered all the steps of this battle eating up with the four kings and when Abraham recognized that he recognized that God ordered everything God ordered a hundred percent of the victory and I don't ask pen back in return so there ten represents a time so the tenth is something odd God wants us to offer to recognize God pan was in it Olivia oh now let me another one are the ten lepers only one came back I forgot about that that's I forgot about all that so that tenth belongs to God that tenth is what man God wants man to do God wants man to give a tenth in return to recognize that this was divinely ordered of God God ordered all the steps God led me this Scott God taught me to do this guys show me how to do this and I'm gonna bring this tenth back so I thought that was really beautiful hope you're enjoying this this is I love this I love seeing these uh principles in the Word of God next Hotel written it's real and God brought out is feel out of Egypt all the males 20 years and upward had to pay a half shekel of redemption money okay the firstborn had to pay ten times that was the tenth again for the firstborn but every male 20 years and upward had to pay a hash beca which was ten gayest i think that's the little garrus garrus and if you remember list money paid for the service of the tabernacle to atonement for their souls so again just like the tithing God was showing that he redeemed Israel by paying the full price for their Redemption just like with no Kasdan God Abraham knew God it was God it was no Kazakh who gave him that full victory it was God's divine order and then God was only asking those males now after they brought out of Egypt to give and acknowledge that with a ten Gera offering so 10 is man acknowledging God's hundred-percent provision with just his own tent its man recognizing God's divine order I think about people that don't pay ties they're failing to recognize that God gave me a hundred percent and they can't even give back this tenth to recognize God God's divine order in their life not on the day of Pentecost that was the tenth day they've been waiting so they had to fulfill the divine order of the fifty day they are feast of Pentecost requirement so there's a divine order they had the way there could not have came on the ninth day the eleventh could have came on the seventh day they had to fall in line with God's divine order for number ten and I just preached Wednesday I didn't catch it but there were 10 trials listed in Romans 8 38 and 39 and the Bible says that the love of Jesus Christ is greater than all 10 of these so the words God may allow all these all these trials to order in our lives with the love of Jesus Christ can can where we can't be separated from the love of Jesus Christ this might be a worldliness to I maybe I put this in the wrong one well let's read it Paul said bribes persuade and neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers there's five numbers 39 nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature can separate us from the love of Christ amen I might even move that to worldliness after the service there all those worldly things all the worldly powers all the principalities and powers nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord just a few more minutes I'm going to close in 15 minutes is that okay with everybody at the little joke here's another one on divine order this was interesting I never seen this before there are ten parables Jesus preaches on the kingdom of heaven he literally says that's 10 times which looks like divine order looks like showing God's divine order on how to enter the kingdom of heaven that's what it looks like to me because there's seven in Matthew 13 there's one in Matthew 22 and there's one in Matthew 25 so let's rehearse those real quick the first parable was the seeds on the four kinds of grounds so if you want to be more proof of the kingdom of God what do you need an honest and sincere heart and you'll bring forth much fruit that means a lot of liars in the you know in the other three groups people that I have cares of the world they must be either lying to themselves or lying to God or line to other people because it's a good honest heart that brings forth fruit some thirty sixty and a hundredfold the second parable the wheat and the tares or they both look the same Jesus had let them grow together until the harvest we must bow to the Word of God now try to impersonate the Word of God but bow to it and obey it third is the grain of mustard seed which possibly could be faith it could be but most accordingly it looks like it is the mustard seed of sin that started the the foss church the Roman Catholic Church and now all the all the all the evil files are perched upon that tree because the Bible says of Revelation 18 that she's a cage of unclean and hateful bird number four the leaven hid in three measures of meal that's the ugly that's the Trinitarian doctrine I believe that that was hid and God's threefold manifestation they hid a lie in there and then it grew and grew into it eleven all the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church and course many Protestants as well fifth the treasure hid in a field this is the one the parable where you're surprised this is a parable where he's not really looking for it where God surprises you and six is the Pearl great price this is one where they're actually looking for wisdom they're actually looking for the something supernatural and they have to forsake their all the other pearls in order to gain the one pearl we show to different approaches to God you get to the kingdom of heaven either way whether God surprises you or whether you're already looking for and praise the Lord number seven the net cast in the sea which shows the anointed ones at the end times that's the mystery behind that where the gospel attracts many people but only those that have the true character the true seed of the true nature of God those are the only ones that will not be cast away at the end ones that God really wants to use and keep okay so that's the first seven now I must have missed one I must have missed one yeah I think I miss one I only have nine on my note so sorry about that have to go look I think there was two maybe in Matthew chapter 22 but there's Matthew 22 there's the parable that Cain who bit his servants to invite people to the marriage of his son there must be another one in there and then in Matthew 25 of course we know that parable the wise and foolish virgins and all these deal with the kingdom of heaven with the New Testament covenant the baptism of the Holy Ghost they all deal with that okay this is interesting there's 10 I am in the book of John I am the bread of life I'm The Living bread I am the light of the world before Abraham was I am I am the one that bear witness to myself he says Jesus says Jesus says I am the door to the Sheep I'm the Good Shepherd I am the resurrection of life I am the way the truth and the life lastly I am The True Vine there's 10 I am that can be showing God's divine order ordering Jesus as the I am fire came down from heaven 10 times in the Bible on Sodom on the first offerings in the tabernacle the biggest 9:24 on native and by who in numbers 11 one of the murmurs of tabara number 1635 encore and his company on Elijah's offering at Carmel the first time Elijah's enemies in first Kings 110 and the second time on more of his enemies in second Kings 112 and then in first chronicles 21 26 fire fell and David sacrifice in Jerusalem and then when Solomon Solomon dedicated the temple it fell for the tenth time in second chronicles 7 one so interesting God's divine order so there's that as well worldliness perhaps maybe a couple meetings there there's 10 times the people shouted for joy in the Bible so I'm not sure how that works but I'll just read it real quick fire from heaven consume the first sacrifices they shouted in limiting his 9:24 they shouted at the taking of Jericho and Joshua 6:20 when the ark was brought into the camp they shouted first samuel 45 when saul was chosen as king the people shouted first samuel 1024 when his were went to fight the philistines they shouted first say no 17 20 when they tell us that the philistines were pursuing them they shouted first name of 1752 then second samuel 6:15 when the ark was brought back from the house of obed-edom the people shouted for joy when god smoked Jeroboam before abaya the people shouted when a mate I'm sorry when a son and the people heard of omens prophecy they shouted and in Ezra 3:11 when the foundation of the second temple was laid by saruba both the people shouted 10 shouting interesting almost done there are 10 just curses in the Bible that God gave first on the serpent then on the ground then on Cain and on Canaan then on Jericho and then on aiken then on the Gibeonites then on the sheeter mites then on high l the bethe light and the last time was when Jesus cursed the fig tree ten curses by God in the Bible interesting here's another one but this kind of goes into 10000 the Bible said when when Jesus after he came and took the book before he opened the seals the Bible said I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts of the owners and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousand thousands so ten thousand times ten thousand is a hundred million I looked it up today so I didn't get that wrong so it looks like more divine order so you have ten thousand times ten thousand your God ordering things and the last thing is so I'm almost done blessing I think ten might also be a faithful remnant number as well so I could be wrong but this is my thought because there's there's three witnesses where it looks like ten is a number of faithful remnants there were twelve tribes of Israel and how many were blotted out for idolatry two so that left ten that were faithful that never had to have their names removed or changed through the progress of the tribes of Israel like we mean the progress from from a promised land to Egypt and then back to the promised land and then to the to the Millennium yah I'm so I'm sorry no to the 144,000 and then to the money and there's the four steps of the twelve tribes of Israel all right so see 10 out of the 12 were faithful only two of them went into idolatry also when Abraham prayed to God to spare sign of God's and I will spare that if there's ten there's ten but their work there weren't only eight so it looks like dog with his spirit if there was at least a group of ten of course we know that so it seemed like God saw 10 as a faithful remnant and then lastly our last one is Jesus described how many virgins who were looking for the coming of the bridegroom 10 10 of course we know five we'll actually made it to see it but all 10 were looking and remember the the foolish they were faithful to what they knew they were a virgin to the word they were just foolish in the aspect of taking more oil they didn't really prepare I didn't pray up like we heard so 10 seems to be faithful remnant as well as I told you I think I'm stop right there by the grace of Lord hope that was a blessing I'm al Qaeda coming to the piano here why don't we stand your family we'll just in I ask everybody to stand there at their house if they can let's just look to the Lord here you know as I'm looking at these numbers it just seems like you know 9 was judgment and hate was ones we'd already heard before and then 10 had divine order worldliness and also a faithful part let's just pray that God would keep all the worldliness out of our hearts praise God there's in fact the majority of the 10 scriptures were about worldliness so that's God to help us to not be a part of worldliness but to do the good side which was a faithful remnant let's be that one of the 10 right let's be that tithe let's be that 1 out of 10 that recognizing what God has done for us we come back and we recognize God's hand in our life to give us the full victory we come back and we want to give God thanks let's do that today as we bow our head sir let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the word of God today Lord your prophets said that you're known by numbers father we can truly see how you're known today for these numbers

shut-in or the to given us because of the snow we're all kind of shut-in I was decided with you today encourage our hearts is fighting us for Jesus let's draw closer to the thank you for the blood of
