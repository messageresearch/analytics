TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of bondage. I don't think any of us wants to be in bondage. The price is paid and we can be free. &gt;&gt; And if we're free, we're free indeed. &gt;&gt; So, you want to turn to Galatians chap 2 verse 20. We'll read that. Galatians chapter 2 verse 20. I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do not frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your gift. We thank you for your love. We thank you for your Holy Spirit. Lord, we ask you that your spirit would be here present today. Lead and guide and direct us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, use my lips. Lord, help me to surrender that you can speak through me. And Lord, I ask that every heart would be surrendered to you here today. And Lord, speak to us whatever you want us to have. Lord, we want your living water to flow through our lives. Thank you, Lord, for this. And we praise you for the price you paid at Calvary for each one of us. Thank you that we can be free and free indeed. Amen. You may be seated. So Paul here in Galatians, he he wrote a lot to us. Paul was a man. He he thought he was doing right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is with a lot of people today? It was the way that it was with me and probably with all of you if we're honest. So the day came that Christ opens our eyes if we want them open. &gt;&gt; It even says I think it's in Ephesians it says he opens the eyes of our understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So we need Christ to open our understanding to reveal himself to us because Paul experienced that. Paul was a man. He was persecuting the true Christians, but he was living the law or under the law. He thought he was doing right. &gt;&gt; But one day he found out that he wasn't doing right and Christ met him. &gt;&gt; How many people to hear here today can say they experienced that? that one day we realized that we weren't doing right, but that Christ was revealed to us and from that day on our life changed. Our life was different. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was by his grace that we are what we are. So here in in Galatians chapter 3, it says, "Oh foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you? This only would I learn of you, receive ye the spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?" So why did God bring the law through Moses? Are ye so foolish, having begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Have you suffered so many things in vain? If it yet, if it be yet in vain, he therefore that ministers to you the spirit, and workketh miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. So Abraham is the father of faith. We can learn a lot through Abraham. If we did Abraham do everything right? No, he didn't. I'm glad for that. If we look through the Bible, if we if we read through the Bible, there's a lot of people that God used that didn't live a very good life. &gt;&gt; Actually, they were living in sin. the adulterous woman, the woman at the well. A lot of different uh most of them didn't live a good life until one day that Christ came into their heart and it changed them. And that's how it is with us. We're no different. But what I want to point out there, let not the devil condemn us if we fail miserably in our lives. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want us to be free. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus said, "It is finished," the price was paid for all sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once for all, it doesn't need to be paid again. &gt;&gt; So, how do we receive it? Do we have to do a lot of good works to live the law to to get it? Or is it or does do we believe that it is a free gift? &gt;&gt; If somebody wants to give me something, I receive it. I say, "Thank you. I don't need to pay anything for it. If it's a gift, right? &gt;&gt; It's free." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how Christ wants us to be. He wants us to be free. He paid the price that we can be free if we believe. &gt;&gt; If we believe. But why is it our nature, it seems more right sometimes to try to live the law? &gt;&gt; Isn't it that sometimes if we fail, we try to do better, we try to do good for a couple weeks and we don't need to do that. we repent and we can be free instantly &gt;&gt; because a lot of times if we try to do better and better and better we fail again and then we condemn oursel again and that we are not under condemnation if we are in Christ. Now it says even as Abraham believed God it was accounted to him for righteousness. Then it says know ye therefore that they which are of the faith the same are the children of Abraham. And as the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, "In thee shall all nations be blessed." So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse. For it is written, cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. Wow. So why do we want to live under the law? &gt;&gt; The law is a school master to bring us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It shows us we can't live a life good enough. So we need to turn to Christ. But that a man is justified by the law in the sight of God. It is evidence for the just shall live by faith. So I want to be one of them that we will live by faith. I'm going to go back. I think it's in Genesis chapter 4. talking about Cain and Abel. It says here in chapter 4 verse three, "And in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel als he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offerings, but unto Cain and his offerings he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his contendants fell. And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy contendants fallen? If thou doeth well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou doeth not well, sin layst at the door, and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. So Cain was a very religious man. &gt;&gt; He thought he was doing right. He was working. He was doing a lot of work with his hands to bring fruit. And so he was raising crops to bring fruit for an offering to the Lord. But Abel had something different. And here's something very important to understand. Abel had the revelation what God wanted to please him. He had the revelation that it takes faith to trust him to believe him. Cain was trying to work his with his good works trying to get good works so God would accept him and it didn't work. So that's the way it is today. Either we're trying to worship God by our good works or we worship him through faith, revelation. &gt;&gt; And where does revelation come from? Re true revelation comes from God. He reveals something to us about the word of God. And the mystery is hid in the word of God. And he reveals it to his people. Whoever's hearts are true, whoever really wants it, he reveals it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then if we go in the next chapter, well the other thing we should point out that one day Cain and Abel were out about and Cain slew his brother and killed him. Isn't that exactly what's happening today? That spirit that Cain had is still trying to persecute the true Christian believers. &gt;&gt; So we need to understand just because we're in a church, just because we go to church, just because we have a big church doesn't say we're serving God at all. But just to stop and think a little bit to go back to Cain worshiping, if we could see Cain's worship, offering to God, and Abel's worshiping to God, his bloody lamb, which one looked the best? &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is today? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. People go into church, they dress right, they try to do right, but they don't have the revelation what God really wants. They keep a set of rules or they try to. So I think that's the very deceiving thing that Satan is doing today. &gt;&gt; He's got a lot of people wrapped up in religion. &gt;&gt; And let it not be us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it is it is a hard thing to come out of religion to the true thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes the revelation from God. It takes the power of God to come out from among them and be separated. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. God's has God has to open our eyes and give us the strength and the power to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to go to Genesis 5 now. It talks about Enoch in verse 24. Genesis 5 24 it says, "And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him." &gt;&gt; Why did God take him? because he was walking with God. How many people here today are walking with God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say that he was going to church, that he was keeping a set of rules or anything like that, but he says he walked with God. &gt;&gt; And I think it's if you go back further in Genesis 2, where Adam and Eve, they could eat of the tree of life. God had a relationship with them and that's what he wants with us. He wants us to have a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Do we need to go to church then? Yes, we need to go to church. We want to go to church. &gt;&gt; But we go to church because we have God in our hearts. The Holy Spirit, the token. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I think the token is represents the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we can all experience this what Eno had experienced. We're living in the last times. I think we all agree we're living in the last time. The prophet was here to bring to reveal the mysteries of God in the Bible to bring things out so we can understand what the Bible, what he's talking about and he left and he's been gone for quite some time, isn't he? &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is here to lead and guide and direct us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe the time is getting close. that there's more people going to be raptured out of here. &gt;&gt; The true believers are going to be taken out. Amen. I'm going to turn to numbers. Well, I should start at another place. My mind goes back a little bit. when the when God we know there's different exodus but when God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt so he he brought a nation out of a nation &gt;&gt; so he called them out he didn't want them to be in bondage any longer &gt;&gt; he had a promised land that they were supposed to go to and how many days was it supposed to take to to the promised land. Was it 40 days? Did it take 40 days? &gt;&gt; Why did they spend 40 years in the wilderness? Because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; I think unbelief is the number one sin. If we don't trust our maker, Was it easy to get the children of Israel out? He sent Moses the prophet to get him out. Isn't that wonderful? If we look now, he also sent a prophet to get us out. Right. &gt;&gt; It's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought a church out of Israel. Now he wants to have get a bride out of the church. To the natural carnal man, that doesn't sound very good, does it? &gt;&gt; That God is calling somebody out of the church. But he is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He is. So, we got to understand that God is calling people out of the church. People received the church instead of him. So now he's calling his loved ones out, the predestinated ones out out of the church to follow him to have a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have a good relationship with our Lord, right? &gt;&gt; Then sometimes it seems like a door is closed or partly closed. I think it's like this. If we would go out here, try to start our car and it wouldn't start. The battery might be okay if we put like God is the battery. The battery might be okay, but maybe there's a corrosion on the wire or on the clamp that goes onto the battery that it's corroded. Sometimes that's all that's wrong that we can't start it. &gt;&gt; It's on any motor or any equipment, a track or anything like that. So, we have to take the clamp off and clean it and put it back on and everything's okay. Was the battery dead? No. &gt;&gt; So, our God isn't dead. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. That's true. Amen. So time sometimes I think we get away from God or we turn to earthly things and then things are not good between us and God &gt;&gt; but God is still there waiting for us &gt;&gt; waiting for us to return &gt;&gt; back to him. &gt;&gt; But it says in John 10 I think it says my sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So his sheep are going to return right back to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if we fail, if we fall, the true if the truth is in in here, well, just like King David, he fell. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He murdered. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He committed adultery. He done a lot of things. &gt;&gt; But did he lose salvation? &gt;&gt; He didn't. How do we know that? Because he cried out to God. He said, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation." He lost his joy. &gt;&gt; He lost his joy. &gt;&gt; So God called the children of Israel. He worked through a prophet to bring them out of Egypt. So he told them to take a lamb, kill the lamb, put the blood around the door post. We know that story. And wherever the blood was applied, when the death angel came through, they're going to be safe, right? &gt;&gt; So can we apply the blood today &gt;&gt; on our hearts? Amen. &gt;&gt; We can. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And wherever the blood was in the plight, the oldest son was dead, right? &gt;&gt; And cattle. So, we might as well believe in the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's the only safe place we have. We can't believe the the world is falling apart. Whatever it is, if we believe in the true blood of the lamb, the token is applied. We're free. We're saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the children of Israel came out. They went through a lot of things. I'm going to skip over a lot of They came to the Red Sea. I think sometimes we face things like that, like the Red Sea, things that look impossible. This looked impossible. There approximately two million people there. And this was a big sea. It wasn't just a little river to cross. It looked impossible for them to cross. But what did they do? Moses asked God what to do. And God told him what to do to put his staff out over the water. Right? The water separated. The winds went through and dried it up. And they could walk through there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did when they came to the other side, the enemy was following them. Did the enemy make it through? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; We're still serving the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the children of Israel, they were singing and praising God, but they realized finally in a short time that their own flesh was their biggest enemy, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is with us? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, that's why Apostle Paul said, "I die daily." We have to die daily to our flesh &gt;&gt; so the spirit can live in us. So I want to point something out here. They were supposed to be in the land of Canaan, the promised land, which the promised land for us is the word of God, right? The promises that are in the book here, we can receive all of them. We're supposed to receive all of them. So a lot of things happened through the desert time. They murmured, they complained and got you know what happened. Some died. But here towards the end, I'm going to read a little bit here in Numbers 14. Something that really stood out to me about Caleb. Numbers 14, verse 23. I'm going to start. Surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoke me see it. But this is the verse, verse 24, that really stood out to me. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and had followed me fully, him will I bring into the land where into I went, and his sea shall possess it. &gt;&gt; Wow. Look at that. Caleb had a different spirit. That's why we need the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We need to be born again. &gt;&gt; We can go to church all our lives and if we're not born again, we're going to miss it. So they sent 12 spies over in the land of Canaan to see how the land is. When they came back, Josh and Caleb said, "We can take the land if God is with us." But the other 10 said, "They can't. There are giants over there. We can't take it. You know what happened? Whatever they said is what happened to them. &gt;&gt; We can be careful with our words. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We can be very careful with our words. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, two of them believed they could take it. 10 of them believed they couldn't. And that's what happened. So verse 26 it says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, how long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me? I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they murmured against me, say unto me, as truly as I live, sayeth the Lord, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do unto you. Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward, which have murmured against me. Doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you dwell therein, save Caleb and Joshua. But verse 31 it says, "But your little ones which ye said should be a prey, they will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised." Do we have little ones in here today? Praise the Lord for little children. Little children get a free ticket to heaven, right? &gt;&gt; What about the adults? It is paid for us, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know there's people already concerned about the children. &gt;&gt; What will happen with the children if the rapture comes? I think God will take care of the little children. I really do. &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about that. &gt;&gt; God loves the little children. &gt;&gt; He loves the big men and women also. &gt;&gt; Do we love him? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need to love him with all our heart, mind, and soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to love each other. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, Moses died because he couldn't enter into the land. So Joshua and Caleb and the young people could enter in, but they had to step in the water and then the water stopped and ran away. Right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wasn't that a step of faith? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's I think we need to do the same thing. We need to step forward in faith. Once we can see something, it's not faith anymore. &gt;&gt; Faith is we see it. If we if we can't see it, but we believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's faith. Abraham had that faith. Shared a little bit about Abraham. Abraham had the promise. God told him he's going to have a son. But I think this is something we need to point out that happens in our lives. Abraham was promised to have a son and Sarah, but they were getting older. I think they were what, 86 years old. God told him his seat should be like the sand along the seashore and like the stars in heaven. This looked very impossible &gt;&gt; in their old age. So finally Sarah decided that she's not going to have the son. So Sarah told Abraham he can take Hagar to bring the son. We can do the very same thing in our life if we don't trust God. Take things into our own hands. Well, he Abraham took Hagar and she became pregnant and Hagar bare a son. His name is called Ishmael. All right? But God said that's not the son of the promise. So God came to him and told him anyway, hey Sarah got pregnant in her old age and bear a son Isaac which is the son of the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were what 13 14 years difference in age and they didn't get along too well did they? Because the son of the flesh persecuted the son that was born after the spirit which was Isaac and that's the way it is today. That fight was going from that day on. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is sir? So one day in Genesis 21:9, the children grew up. Verse 8, and the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast in the same day that Isaac was weaned. And Sarah saw that the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, "Cast out the bond woman and her son. For the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." And the thing was very grievious in Abraham's sight because of the son. And God said unto Abraham, "Let it not be grievious in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bond woman in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seat be called. So he had to cast out the bond woman and her son. We can easily see that, right? That didn't work. But do we know that we all have to cast out the bond woman and her son in our life? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We need to get out of bondage. The sun represents the works that come from the bond woman in our lives. So either we are believing like Abraham and we're enjoying our son Isaac which is by faith or we're still in bondage. Paul gave a very clear directions on that. So, we read some in uh in Galatians, and I'm going to turn back to Galatians again. What Paul had to say after that Paul was converted. He wrote a lot of the New Testament. Did Paul receive it because of his intellectual, his smartness? No. He received it by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From God. &gt;&gt; God gave him revelation. That's why he could why his life was changed. So that's precious to me. God didn't destroy Paul because Paul killed people, put people in the prison, persecuted them. God is a God of love, a God of forgiveness. and we look there's a lot of things to share on that but in here in uh Galatians chapter 4 not sure where I want to start in verse three even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoptions as sons. So here if we go back to Mary, Virgin Mary, Mary was a young girl. She probably thought she was going to marry Joseph and have children and raise a family and like a lot of us. But one day, God sent an angel to Mary and said she will be pregnant. The Holy Ghost going to come upon her. She didn't realize what was going to take place or how it was going to take place, but something we need to understand that she surrendered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; She surrendered. She trusted God. Whatever it is. So Jesus was born through Virgin Mary. &gt;&gt; So today we got to surrender our vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit live in us like Mary did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary had a changed life. Mary walked different. Verse six, it says, "And because ye are sons, God has sent forth his spirit of his son into our hearts crying out a father." Is that spirit in our hearts crying? Wherefore thou art no more servants but a son? And if his son then an heir of God through Christ, how about how abide then when ye knew not God? Ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to weak and beggarly elements, where unto you desire again to be in bondage. You observed days and months and times and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain. Brethren, I beseech you as beseech you, be as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye have not entered me at all. I'm going to skip some. I'm going to go down to verse 22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by the bond woman, the other by the free woman. But he who was of the bond woman was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was born by the promise. So that is telling us if we live in the flesh, if we walk in the flesh, we are in bondage. &gt;&gt; But if we live by faith, Abraham is the father of faith. If we live in that spirit, we can be free. &gt;&gt; The free woman. Verse 25 it says, "And this Hagar is Mount Si in Arabia and answers to Jerusalem which is now and is in the bondage with her children. Who produces the most children? The children by the flesh are a lot more than the children by faith and the spirit. &gt;&gt; But Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all. But it is written, "Rejoice thou baroness that beareest not. Break forth the cry that thou trailest not, for the desolation has many more children than she which has a husband." Wow. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then, he that was born after flesh persecuted him that is born after spirit, even so it is now. &gt;&gt; So we're not going to get away from that on this earth. &gt;&gt; If we live in the spirit and walk in the spirit, there's people going to be against us. &gt;&gt; And the sad part is sometimes it's even family members. But God told us we need to forsake all &gt;&gt; to follow him. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, what says the scripture, cast out the bond woman and her son? For the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. So there's the difference. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free. So we got a choice. We can either live in bondage or we can live free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the next chapter says, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage. It is very important to ask God for revelation and wisdom. A lot of people think and believe once they leave a religious system or come out of religion system now they're free to live however they want to and that's not the word of God. &gt;&gt; It says use not your liberty as an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is in Galatians 5:13. So if we live in the spirit, we don't want to do anything that displeases God because God's spirit wants to do what the word says we're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says for in verse 14, all for all the law is fulfilled in one word. Even this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. If ye buy and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. This I say then, walk in the spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I say that looks like a pretty safe place to walk. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A very safe place to walk. says, "If we walk in his spirit, we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't need a rule book or a law to tell me not to go to the bar or anything like that or whatever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need that. If I'm walking in the spirit, the spirit's got control of my life. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to understand that if we truly are walking in the spirit, we're going to do what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; And the fruit that's going to be coming out of that life is in verse 23. But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. &gt;&gt; Why? And it says, "And they that have crucified and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections affections and the lust. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. Let us not be desires of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision us anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. But a new creature. So, I'm going to turn back to Joshua. We talked about the children of Israel going into the land of Canaan. Didn't it say, doesn't the Bible say where milk and honey flows? &gt;&gt; If God gives us revelation, wisdom of his word, isn't that like milk and honey &gt;&gt; to our soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God wants wanted them to take all the land to cast out all the enemies to kill the enemies, get rid of the enemies. So that's how what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; If we want to take the whole promise of God, the whole word of God, we got to get rid of the enemies that tried to destroy it. So there's something here in uh about Rahab. Well, I got to back up a little bit, but where the children is. So when they went to take Jericho, God told them to go around the city one time for six days, right? And then the Sabbath day, they were go around seven times and to blow their trumpets and stuff and take the city. But before that, they sent spies over and for somehow they ended up in Rahab's house, right? And her house was on the wall. I think this was a I don't know how big a city this was, but they had walls built up. I don't know how wide, how high, it doesn't matter, but big enough for a house to be built on that wall. And this is where Rahab lived. Was Rahab a good person? &gt;&gt; She wasn't. But she had something evidently in her that she believed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She believed this messengers that came So she tied this red scarlet on by her window or somewhat. So what does that represent? I think that represents the token the Holy Spirit in our lives. So it says the seventh day the children walked around this city seven times they blew the trumpets and the walls and things came tumbling down &gt;&gt; they didn't need any bulldozers or sledes to bring the walls down. Right? &gt;&gt; Why not? Because they obeyed God. &gt;&gt; And I think that's what we need to do in our life. &gt;&gt; We need to obey God. Obey his words and walls will tremble down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stones will be rolled away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Rahab the harlot because she had that red scarlet tied by her house, she was saved because she believed. &gt;&gt; She believed and her father and mother, her family believed also. They were also saved. But the other people could have believed, but they didn't. &gt;&gt; They probably thought they're inside this big wall city, they're safe. And I think we can take that as a church or something like that, a good solid church. If we're inside this church, we're okay. But if we don't have Christ, if we don't have the token, we are not okay. So that really helps us to understand or it should it helps me to understand that Rahab was a harlot but because she believed she was saved she was spared. &gt;&gt; That's a blessing to me &gt;&gt; and her house. How many of us would like for all our family to be saved? I would &gt;&gt; I would and not just my family. I hope everybody can be safe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So, Rahab, the story of Rahab kind of takes me also back to when the children of Israel were when they uh put the blood over the doorpost. That was a sign that the people on the outside could see the blood. The angel could see the blood. It was a sign that the people on the inside of the house believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the blood wasn't applied, they didn't believe. &gt;&gt; So the power really wasn't in the blood, right? It was in believing. But that the blood was a sign. &gt;&gt; Same way as the token is for us today. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think we live in a day the world might be falling apart, but God is not falling apart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Our God is going to have a bride that he's going to take out of here someday. &gt;&gt; We don't know when. I think it's just as it was in the days of Noah. Noah was built in the ark. A lot of people could have helped and built the ark and could have gone in with him. The Bible says as it was in the days of Noah and in Lot, that's how it's going to be when the Son of Man &gt;&gt; is revealed. In Revelation chapter 2, it says, "He that has an ear," verse 7, Revelation 2:7, it says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the garden, which is in the midst of paradise of God." So we have to overcome a lot of things. We have to cast out the bond woman and her son. &gt;&gt; The things in life that our flesh wants that we don't need. &gt;&gt; This religious spirit needs to be cast out. We need to overcome religious traditions and stuff. We need to cast them out. And if we do that, if we are overcomers by the grace of God, he will give us to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God. It goes on down in verse 10. It says, "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried, and he and ye shall have tribulation 10 days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. Praise the Lord. If we go on to verse 17, it says, well, verse 16 says, "Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden mana." So, there is a hidden mana. and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. Isn't that exactly how it is with uh we can try to tell people the full gospel truth of our day, but if God doesn't open somebody's heart and mind, they cannot receive it. So it's by the grace of God that we can receive his truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says we he predestinated us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wow. If we go in chapter 3 verse 20 of Revelation, it says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; "And will s with him and he with me." Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he says again, to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as also I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. After Jesus resurrected, first he came to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast out seven devils. So I think today Jesus is coming to individuals. I don't think he's It seems to me It sounds to me like he's outside the church. &gt;&gt; Maybe not all churches, but a lot of churches see he's on the pushed on the outside. Why? Because people don't want to stay. with the true word of God. &gt;&gt; This is all we need. &gt;&gt; I believe in Jesus in the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; and I believe that's the only safe place to be. I'm going to go in Revelation chapter 10 verse 7. It says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets." And I believe that. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go, and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many people, nations, and tongues, and kings." So I think he's talking to us. Take the little book. I don't think he's talking about this book. But we are to take go get all the revelation. Ask God to give us revelation and take it eat it. If God gives us a revelation, it is sweet as honey in our mouth. Right. Yes sir. But once it enters the belly means to live it, it is not so sweet. &gt;&gt; It means sometimes we get persecuted to live what we truly believe is right, what God gave us. And then it says, "Prophesy again to peoples, nation, tongues, and kings." So we are to speak the word, share the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because God's prophet left. So now he's looking to us to spread his word. We are his hands and his feet and his mouth. &gt;&gt; But sometimes it seems to be very discouraging how few people really want to hear the true word of God. But then we got to stop and think, how was it? How was it with me? Did I receive it the first time somebody tried to share the word of God? I remember people sharing to me. I wanted to do what was right. People sharing with me, I believe what they were saying, but I couldn't see it because I was spiritually blind. But by the grace of God, God opened my eyes that I could see. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am seeking God today yet to open my heart and eyes more and more. I want more wisdom and more revelation from God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want more living water. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Flowing through my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need the living water to refresh us, to encourage us, that we can stay faithful and trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers, your attentiveness. Jesse told me I can preach as long as I want to. &gt;&gt; But he told me about how long he usually preaches and about how long the church will Whatever. So, I'm not a preacher. You would say long winded. Usually, when the glass is full of water, it just runs over, right? So, praise the Lord. Let's walk in his word. Let's receive the little book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's receive all the truth he has. and let's surrender our lives. And brothers and sisters, I ask that you pray for me that I can live a life that is pleasing &gt;&gt; to my savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that I can truly get rid of all the religious, self-righteous things that I was walking in &gt;&gt; and just believe the word, the true word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Does Jesse does he do the prayer or do you do the prayer at the end? Okay, why don't we all stand up for prayer? Heavenly Father, thank you for your spirit. Thank you for your love. Thank you for the price you paid for our sins. Lord, I ask you just touch everyone's heart here today. Fill us with your word. Fill us with your spirit. And Lord, help us that we can be your hands and feet and mouth, Lord, to share your word. Help us to live your word, walk in it. Lord, we ask that you breathe with us, brother Chessie also and the church out Napoleon, the church at home. Bless them and we ask your blessings to flow. Thank you, Lord, that you brought us here safe. And Lord, we ask that you'd give us safe traveling home everybody and help us that we can walk in your footsteps this week also and weeks to come. We just pray this in
