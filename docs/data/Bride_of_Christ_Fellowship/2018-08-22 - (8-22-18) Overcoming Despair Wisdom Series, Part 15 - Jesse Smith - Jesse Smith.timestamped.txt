[19:55] till gets put in so I've reserved the

[20:03] race will meet 1 p.m. on Sunday where
[20:06] the Keith Randolph will be preaching on
[20:09] Sunday just one service by the grace the
[20:12] Lord so that's the update there I want
[20:17] to thank everybody who attended Sunday
[20:19] who could set up I know brother bang
[20:21] mother amen let songs and bang was
[20:23] helping out so just want to thank
[20:25] everybody for supporting the work and
[20:27] the service there we had just a
[20:29] wonderful time in Napoleon we did a
[20:30] marriage banquet on Saturday night and a
[20:32] lot of good feedback on that and then we
[20:35] had a wonderful service on Sunday
[20:37] morning a lot of Prayer at the altar a
[20:38] really good time seeking the Lord so
[20:40] there's a wonderful time to be with the
[20:42] Saints in the point brother cam of
[20:44] course sends his greetings to everyone
[20:47] so like we have to request I'd like to
[20:49] share
[20:50] sister Connie's friend had that
[20:52] colonoscopy today so she asked for
[20:54] prayer for that so I just pray for
[20:57] recovery hopefully everything went well
[20:58] by the grace of God and also there's an
[21:03] unspoken need at Napoleon I talked to
[21:05] one of the Saints with brother km the
[21:07] pastor there's an unspoken knee there
[21:09] that's quite important so let's keep
[21:11] that in prayer as well when I heard back
[21:15] from Austin's grandma in Austin Austin
[21:16] received the Bible so he's really happy
[21:18] and excited to get the Bible that we
[21:21] sent out there then his grandmother said
[21:24] he's in his room a lot playing on the
[21:26] guitar and hopefully playing for Jesus I
[21:29] don't know if it's for Jesus hopefully
[21:30] he's fighting for Jesus but she said
[21:32] he's doing much better mentally or
[21:34] spiritually so happy to hear about that
[21:37] by God's grace so let's pray for
[21:39] Benjamin in Austin and friends those are

[36:08] chapter 2 I could pick up on the wisdom
[36:12] series tonight it's been a few quite a
[36:15] few weeks since we looked at this so to
[36:17] Ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 10
[36:22] last time we preached on this was back
[36:27] in July
[36:28] actually July 4th we looked at
[36:33] Parliament or Tom and Solomon's five W's
[36:47] so please use chapter 2 verse 10 so they
[36:54] had a subtopic in the overcoming despair
[36:57] overcoming despair because we'll see
[36:59] after Solomon tries chasing these five
[37:01] W's and fails and he's overcome with
[37:04] despair and so we know what comes or we
[37:08] know what overcomes despair that's the
[37:10] Holy Spirit by God's grace yeah amen and
[37:13] that Holy Spirit of course manifest in
[37:16] different ways we'd say different fruits
[37:17] of the spirit like love joy peace
[37:20] gentleness goodness long-suffering all
[37:23] nine fruits of the Holy Spirit but I
[37:25] want to see this here tonight I trust to
[37:28] be a blessing to everybody so he's a
[37:30] sees chapter 2 verse 10 I think I'll
[37:36] read to verse 17
[37:41] I'm going to read for most of this here
[37:45] and what's up for mine eyes desired I
[37:47] kept not from them I was held not my
[37:50] heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced
[37:53] and all my labor and this was my portion
[37:56] of all my labor then I looked on all the
[37:59] works that my hands had wrought and on
[38:01] the labor that I laboured to do and
[38:03] behold all this was vanity and vexation
[38:05] of spirit and there was no profit under
[38:10] the Sun and I turned myself to behold
[38:13] wisdom and madness and folly for what
[38:15] can the man do that cometh after the
[38:17] king even that which has been already
[38:19] done and I saw that wisdom excel at
[38:24] folly as far as light Excel with
[38:27] darkness The Wise Man's eyes are in his
[38:30] head but the fool walketh in darkness
[38:32] and I myself perceived also that one
[38:35] event happens happeneth to them all then
[38:39] said I my heart has it happened to the
[38:41] fool so I happened this even to me and
[38:43] why was I then more wise than I said in
[38:45] my heart that this is also vanity but
[38:48] there's no remembrance of the wise more
[38:50] than of the fool forever seeing that
[38:53] which now is in the days to come shall
[38:55] all be forgotten and how die at the wise
[38:58] demand as the fool therefore listen to
[39:02] this scripture therefore I hated life
[39:04] because the work that is raw under the
[39:08] Sun was Grievous unto me for all his
[39:11] vanity and vexation of spirit that's
[39:14] quite a statement how can a man who saw
[39:17] Jesus or God twice how could he say hate
[39:20] in life it would have had to been a
[39:23] tremendous backslide for a man that saw
[39:26] God twice and God gave him everything he
[39:29] possibly wanted would had been a
[39:30] tremendous fall away from God or someone
[39:33] like that to hate life let's not word a
[39:36] prayer here that's asked God to help us
[39:38] overcome despair Heavenly Father we love
[39:42] you today we thank you for your mercy we
[39:44] read your word Lord written by the as
[39:46] we'd say the second wisest man outside
[39:49] of you dear God your son Jesus Christ
[39:52] bless this word out to us Lord and help
[39:55] us to see Lord how Lord things of the
[39:58] world are so frivolous there's they have
[40:00] no value Lord God and how Lord we must
[40:03] keep our hearts of mind zealous for the
[40:06] Word of God yes we must learn not that
[40:09] anything come come between us and our
[40:12] Savior your God hallelujah may we seek
[40:15] after you Lord all the days of our life
[40:17] in Jesus Christ's name and everybody
[40:19] said amen may be seated here let's take
[40:22] this thoughts here so I like to look at
[40:30] this thought here tonight of overcoming
[40:33] despair
[40:34] I can't hear everybody on the livestream
[40:38] but if I said how many could raise your
[40:40] hand or say Amen to you ever
[40:41] if you've ever battled despair I
[40:43] wondered how many amens we get
[40:45] in other words hopelessness I think we
[40:47] all have yet we really have when we look
[40:51] at it eternally we have no reason to be
[40:53] hopeless but we're human and and we go
[40:57] through battles we go through trials
[40:58] that allows the enemy to test us and so
[41:01] we go through times of hopelessness or
[41:04] times of despair and we want to look at
[41:07] the Word of God tonight as it relates to
[41:09] to Solomon and and then see why he went
[41:15] through this and then by God's grace we
[41:17] already as we said earlier we know what
[41:19] the answer was going to be we needed a
[41:21] coach to walk to the Holy Spirit my god
[41:23] that's great so we need a genuine
[41:25] repentance is what we need by God's
[41:27] grace no I just want to review part 14
[41:31] we looked at the five W's Solomon tried
[41:33] everything he tried why in Chapter he
[41:39] tried Burke's in chapter 2 verse 4 he
[41:42] verse 7 in Chapter 7 he tried women and
[41:47] we know of course in the kings as well
[41:49] says he had three hundred wives and
[41:51] seven hundred concubines so if anybody
[41:53] tried women if anyone tried
[41:54] relationships and was Solomon and then
[41:58] he tried human wisdom in Ecclesiastes
[42:01] chapter one and twelve verse 12 because
[42:04] he said the Bible said he read so much
[42:06] that much study was weirdness to his
[42:08] flesh so Solomon tried so hard he read
[42:11] so many books to try to get smarter
[42:13] wiser that he got worn out so he tried
[42:16] the five W's and who knows the the one w
[42:19] he was missing the word the word so he
[42:24] tried five W's those were all those were
[42:27] all worldly worldly wisdom worldly wine
[42:30] and works and all these things he just
[42:32] needed the anointed war effort beginning
[42:38] of his life but he must have walked and
[42:41] he left him hungry for the things of the
[42:43] world so much so that he built an altar
[42:45] to every false God of all of his wives
[42:48] which could have been you know scores of
[42:51] altars or hundreds of altars it doesn't
[42:54] really say but the Bible said he didn't
[42:56] build one to every false god so he
[43:00] appeared to him twice the first time he
[43:02] appeared in first Kings three and then
[43:04] the second time in first Kings nine he
[43:07] appeared
[43:08] now remember Ecclesiastes is written at
[43:10] the end of his life because he says this
[43:12] is the conclusion of all my life
[43:14] searching in Chapter 12 and then in in
[43:20] Proverbs Solomon is the one giving the
[43:22] advice because he's freshly anointed
[43:24] with the Holy Spirit he has lots of
[43:26] thoughts about God's wisdom and
[43:28] understanding but here at the end of his
[43:30] life he's reflecting and he's writing
[43:32] all of his his his regrets all the
[43:36] things that he did he wishing that would
[43:38] not have done now in Chapter one we saw
[43:41] that vanity he said everything is vanity
[43:43] or fleeting it doesn't mean it's
[43:45] worthless because if you did most of us
[43:49] would not say yesterday's meals were
[43:51] worthless where they worthless no but
[43:54] they were fleeting the joy of them is
[43:56] our the the tastiness of them as tasty
[43:59] as they could have been we're fleeting
[44:00] so everything is not useless but
[44:02] everything is fleeting in this life
[44:05] except Jesus Christ aren't you glad to
[44:07] know that Christ is your lasting hope
[44:09] Christ is your eternal hope Christ is
[44:12] your eternal reward even aim ahead and
[44:16] he will never get old
[44:17] you can never like brother Hanson you
[44:19] can never
[44:19] tired in that place he said you can
[44:21] never get upset you you could never get
[44:24] fearful you can never get discouraged
[44:26] you never get depressed you can never
[44:28] get hopeless it's perfect love it's
[44:30] perfect hope he said sublime it's beyond
[44:33] sublime he said you just arrived when
[44:36] you get to heaven you heart you've just
[44:38] arrived Amen you're just there and it's
[44:41] just it's all that you could think of
[44:43] and then more beyond that so not
[44:46] everything I'm sorry so things
[44:49] everything is sleeting everything is
[44:51] short-lived but it's not useless it is
[44:54] there is value to it it is worthwhile
[44:57] for the moment but it's not gonna last
[45:00] eternally except eternal life now
[45:02] Solomon said there's nothing new Under
[45:04] the Sun in Chapter one and then in
[45:06] Chapter one he begins searching and
[45:07] found that all these things were a
[45:09] vexation a spear or a longing or
[45:12] striving they were just lot of striving
[45:14] work is such a such a striving is such a
[45:17] a job you know it's such a never-ending
[45:20] job always you can never you can never
[45:22] feel like you get caught up and you say
[45:24] man if you want have you worked and done
[45:26] a job very rarely do I ever feel like I
[45:28] got caught up just because there's not
[45:31] enough time there the jobs and needs are
[45:33] so great you hardly feel like you get
[45:35] caught up and then he talks about
[45:38] worldly wisdom and ends the chapter with
[45:41] that and we found out how I love this
[45:44] from Jane let's go to James chapter 3
[45:45] let's just kind of review this real
[45:46] quick James chapter 3 verse let's go to
[45:51] 17
[45:52] James 3:17 because this will remind us
[45:58] again to recognize and this is where
[46:01] it's so crucial for us to recognize when
[46:04] we are using the wisdom of God like
[46:09] let's say we have a decision about a job
[46:11] or no decision about where we live or if
[46:13] we have a decision about who to spend
[46:15] time with if we have a choice between
[46:17] different ones spend time how do we know
[46:19] it was the wisdom of God here's how you
[46:21] know verse 17 but the wisdom that is
[46:25] from above is first let's all say it is
[46:27] first pure then let's all say it then
[46:33] and let's say the next one it's gentle
[46:35] and easy to be entreated now entreated
[46:39] as easily compliant or easily of obey
[46:42] because God's words are easiest as
[46:45] burden is light
[46:46] amen and then they're full of what full
[46:49] of and good without partiality without
[46:54] hypocrisy so there's no pretending with
[46:57] the wisdom of God when you really act on
[46:59] the wisdom of God
[47:00] you notice to pretend you know to
[47:01] pretend like you like somebody you know
[47:03] what to pretend like you're enjoying
[47:04] yourself
[47:05] are you don't to pretend like you're
[47:06] happy you have to pretend like you're
[47:09] peaceful you actually are you're
[47:11] anointed by the Holy Spirit and you feel
[47:14] pure before God Amen in your mind right
[47:17] because our soul is always sealed it's
[47:19] unchanging Satan's sealed out God sealed
[47:21] it but in your mind you will feel the
[47:24] peace of God you will feel the purity of
[47:27] God the gentleness of God the obedience
[47:30] or compliance to God you will feel mercy
[47:33] the good fruits and no totally trans to
[47:40] put on or pretend to be feeling anything
[47:43] you'll have God's anointing on you amen
[47:46] so that's the wisdom of God so I hope
[47:48] that helps if you know so now you can
[47:50] recognize we can all recognize in our
[47:52] lives when the wisdom of God has been
[47:54] expressed we feel pure there's peace
[47:57] there's gentleness everything seems to
[48:00] be going well now in Chapter two at the
[48:02] beginning Solomon decides I did a test
[48:04] out pleasure I'm gonna try mirth or
[48:07] pleasure and then he goes through three
[48:09] of the W's in Chapter two and then we
[48:13] ended at the third W wealth and we found
[48:17] that the real treasure was the wisdom of
[48:19] God or the Holy Ghost that's the real
[48:21] treasure of God now let's pick up in
[48:24] verse 10 so let's do read 10 11 and 12
[48:34] attack I'm sorry Cleese II asked these
[48:38] two ten eleven twelve
[48:43] what sort of my eyes desired I can't not
[48:46] from them which I was held not my part
[48:49] from any joy my heart rejoice in all
[48:51] their labor and this was my portion of
[48:53] all my labor then I looked on all the
[48:55] works on my hands I'm wrong on the labor
[48:57] that I had labor to do behold I was
[49:00] vanity and vexation is here and there
[49:02] was no profit under the Sun I turned
[49:04] myself to be what wisdom and madness and
[49:07] folly
[49:07] what can the man that do come after the
[49:10] King even that which has been already
[49:13] done a man no think about this the man
[49:17] with the most money in the kingdom he
[49:19] could ride down Main Street I think
[49:21] about writing down what shopping place
[49:24] would we go to the most amazing shopping
[49:28] place we could go to what was it
[49:30] Columbus
[49:31] okay we're American girl an apple store
[49:32] can you imagine driving through there
[49:35] and anything you wanted you could have
[49:38] Solomon could have driven through there
[49:40] he said I'll take that watch I'll take
[49:42] that vehicle right get all the money
[49:44] I'll take this I think that was close
[49:47] I'll take those toys I go a lego store
[49:49] I'll take the whole thing anything is I
[49:52] looked at he got it and it still didn't
[49:56] make him happy
[49:56] and the church said Amen things we see
[50:00] things that natural possessions are not
[50:02] going to make us happy and he proved it
[50:04] he sought out all the joy all the
[50:07] pleasure and then he got excited when he
[50:09] finished building something he rejoiced
[50:10] in all his Labor's look what I've done
[50:12] look what I've done I've dug a brand new
[50:15] canal or something or I've known all
[50:17] this irrigation or anything that he
[50:19] built he rejoiced in it they probably
[50:21] had riots ceremonies where they all
[50:23] clapped with the governors and the
[50:25] mayors of the halle clapping they're all
[50:27] dressed up and they all look you know so
[50:29] so pristine or so so handsomer
[50:32] or pretty but he said eventually this
[50:36] all became vanity or vexation he failed
[50:42] to be happy but it wasn't because he
[50:44] didn't try he tried to be happy by
[50:47] all the possessions doing all the great
[50:49] works but it didn't make him happy and
[50:53] then he said well what can I do that the
[50:56] previous King David my father or even
[51:00] Saul what can I do that they didn't do
[51:02] they won battles they built things they
[51:05] leave no palaces kingdoms all these
[51:06] things what can I do what can the king
[51:08] do that hasn't been done before right
[51:10] what can what can the current president
[51:13] do that hasn't already been done before
[51:15] so he thought he found all this
[51:18] hopelessness in this now let's read
[51:21] verse 13 that he can read thirteen now
[51:31] here's the truth so after all this work
[51:33] he sees that that wisdom goes so beyond
[51:36] folly it's so much more beneficial to be
[51:39] wise then spend your time in foolish
[51:42] things
[51:43] okay verse fourteen but they're doing a
[51:45] report to the wise man's eyes are in his
[51:49] head but the full walketh in darkness
[51:51] and I myself perceived also that one
[51:54] event happened happiness to them all
[51:56] amen so he sees that death is the one
[52:00] event that happens to everyone
[52:02] verse 15 then said I my heart as it
[52:05] happened to the fool so what happened is
[52:07] even to me why was I then the more wise
[52:09] I said my heart that this is also vanity
[52:13] then verse 16 he talks about how there's
[52:15] no remembrance of anyone now that's not
[52:18] true right because we still remember
[52:20] great men like George Washington and the
[52:22] Abraham Lincoln and other great men and
[52:25] women especially when they read books
[52:26] right when the children read books they
[52:28] can really remember Malachi sorry about
[52:30] great General Lee like to read about
[52:32] that's a real person
[52:37] okay the founding fathers that's right
[52:40] and then science and learn about
[52:42] different people in science the science
[52:44] field too so so again he's just making a
[52:47] generalization he's so discouraged he's
[52:50] making a generalization like no one is
[52:52] remembered or but that's not true all
[52:54] the way who who were remembering tonight
[52:56] which keynote remembering
[52:58] Sullivan we're remembering dim there is
[53:01] a remembrance now maybe not into every
[53:03] single day we don't remember maybe
[53:07] Solomon but every day we do remember the
[53:09] King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:10] every day we remember that King of Kings
[53:13] so see he's just kind of overwhelmed
[53:16] with discouragement and we're going to
[53:18] see depression happen next I look at
[53:20] verse 14
[53:21] I'm sorry verse 17 this is one of the
[53:25] most striking verses in the chapter he
[53:28] says therefore I hated life now pause
[53:31] there how could you hate life when you
[53:33] could drive down Main Street and get
[53:35] everything you wanted or have as many
[53:38] husbands or wives as you can possibly
[53:40] how could you hate life but this is the
[53:43] result of sin and this is the result of
[53:45] trying to fill that god-shaped hole with
[53:48] something other than God and it proves
[53:50] it no matter how much money no matter
[53:52] how much you can do or possess or how
[53:54] the great works you can do everybody has
[53:57] a god-shaped hole in their heart that
[53:59] needs to be filled by the baptism of the
[54:01] Holy Ghost
[54:02] and then when you get that and you
[54:04] experience true joy they even for that
[54:07] you just got to keep the mind battles
[54:09] keep victory over the my battles to keep
[54:10] casting down all this and then when you
[54:12] get back in God's presence that you just
[54:14] rejoice and you thank God that you have
[54:16] eternal life abiding in you way men
[54:19] thank you Jesus so he hated life this is
[54:24] so contrary to what Jesus said because
[54:27] Jesus says he says the thief cometh not
[54:30] but to steal kill and destroy but I am
[54:33] coming to might have it more abundantly
[54:39] but half a thing had come to Solomon had
[54:42] stolen some of his his joy it stolen his
[54:46] hope it stolen his peace it stole his
[54:48] wisdom he left when he compromised on
[54:51] God's Word he let Satan steal his true
[54:55] is them the word wisdom let Satan steal
[54:58] his peace and his it is his hope and all
[55:01] these things because he started
[55:03] compromising with his wives and remember
[55:07] that's when I even preached on Sunday a
[55:09] little bit once in
[55:11] you stopped moving on with God just like
[55:13] akin once in but bringing one cent into
[55:16] your house makes you stop moving on with
[55:19] God and just like Israel they can never
[55:21] get any more victories until they got
[55:24] the sin out of the camp amen
[55:26] so that's what we must recognize as well
[55:28] if we see our lives not getting victory
[55:30] and we're not seeing prayers answered
[55:32] and we're not saying out ourselves
[55:34] overcoming things if we see ourselves
[55:36] becoming slaves to discouragement or to
[55:40] sins or the lust of the flesh then we
[55:43] realize something's wrong we we're
[55:45] instead of getting victorious we're
[55:47] getting beaten we're not supposed to get
[55:50] beaten we're supposed to get better
[55:52] we're supposed to get better as a
[55:54] Christian not get beaten and kicked
[55:55] around and so that's the principle of
[55:59] God and we see it that's the principle
[56:01] of a soldier if you're not winning the
[56:02] battle you're actually losing and you're
[56:05] not getting closer you're getting
[56:06] further away because remember the Bible
[56:10] says in Philippians 4:4 rejoice in the
[56:12] Lord sometimes no rejoice in the Lord
[56:16] always and again I say rejoice so it's a
[56:20] victory that we've got to keep on top of
[56:23] so we should hasten and not hate the
[56:28] gift of life that God has given to us
[56:30] got a given Salman a precious life a
[56:33] blessed life he had all the blessings he
[56:36] could actually even hope for and he says
[56:39] I hate it I just you know we have a hard
[56:43] time wrapping our minds around that well
[56:45] that's that's reality he had every
[56:46] single thing he could ever want it
[56:48] imagine Haven heaven every horse you
[56:50] could possibly want but even if you did
[56:53] guess what you know it wouldn't fulfill
[56:56] your heart right just like Daddy
[56:58] I could have every computer or phone and
[57:01] I bet that I could possibly have but
[57:03] that still wouldn't make me happy
[57:05] the only thing that makes you happy is
[57:06] the love of Christ everything else is
[57:09] gonna fall short although we what we
[57:11] need we want things like this it's okay
[57:13] to like horses right it's okay to get
[57:16] the new phone or if you need something
[57:18] better as long as it's not lustful you
[57:20] know and greedy but that's not the point
[57:23] of our life
[57:25] the point of our life is to do what God
[57:26] has called us to do now verse 18 here's
[57:32] where we see more uncertainty so that
[57:36] when sin starts growing and keeps
[57:37] growing in a lot is life it leads to
[57:40] increased uncertainty or increased fear
[57:43] and he's worried about things he cannot
[57:46] control remember jesus said don't worry
[57:49] about your food don't worry about your
[57:51] clothes don't worry about your life he
[57:53] said that God clothes the grass if God
[57:56] closed the birds with feathers isn't he
[57:58] gonna close with you as well
[58:00] isn't gonna close me oh ye of little
[58:03] faith
[58:03] so you're here in verses 18 to 23 we see
[58:07] how Solomon is in despair so let's have
[58:09] our readers again read Malachi 3 18 and
[58:12] 19 he said be a wise man or a fool
[58:23] yes I'm here rule over all my labor and
[58:25] I have labored and where I shouldn't mr.
[58:27] wise into the Sun it's also Spanish Wow
[58:30] even says I hate all these things that I
[58:33] built because I don't even know if the
[58:35] person after me is going to take care of
[58:36] it
[58:37] right and I can relate to that we just
[58:39] you know did this construction down here
[58:41] and if I'm not careful I can worry I
[58:43] wonder if my children are gonna take
[58:45] care of it after I'm old or not you know
[58:47] you could just worry about silly things
[58:49] like that or about your car well I just
[58:51] got this car I wonder is there even my
[58:53] turnery we're going to take care of it I
[58:55] wonder if it's even gonna be taken care
[58:56] of just wondering about things and
[58:58] coming to the spot where he hated going
[59:00] to work we shouldn't hate going to work
[59:03] we should enjoy going to work we should
[59:05] enjoy what God has called us to do and
[59:07] do it as we're doing it unto God Salomon
[59:11] lost that sight he got his eyes off the
[59:13] things of God and he started to hating
[59:15] even his work she said hey Lydia can you
[59:19] read 20 and 21
[59:21] thank you I went about to close my heart
[59:24] to despair all the labor under the Sun
[59:27] there is a manual labor is not an equity
[59:31] get two men that have not labored
[59:33] therein shall we meet
[59:37] [Music]
[59:38] also is vanity okay there simply was 18
[59:44] I'm Tigers 19 I'm sorry no it was worse
[59:51] I thought it was verse 20 caused my
[59:54] heart to despair of all the labor who
[59:56] caused his heart to despair himself who
[1:00:00] causes you and I to get hopeless
[1:00:03] ourselves we let the devil go try to try
[1:00:08] it we let the devil convince us so
[1:00:10] there's no hope there's no use why even
[1:00:12] try right and what does he try and it
[1:00:15] was like in that story of a certain I'd
[1:00:17] the splendid way all same just trying to
[1:00:19] do is to get us to put down our sword so
[1:00:21] stop fighting he doesn't want us to keep
[1:00:24] chopping away at all and his own all his
[1:00:26] lies and all his demon powers right you
[1:00:28] would just just lay down our sword and
[1:00:30] just take it easy and lay down our
[1:00:32] shield that he didn't shoot very darts
[1:00:38] of sin darts he wants you to just sit
[1:00:41] down your your sword and shield and just
[1:00:44] just take it easy that's what happened
[1:00:46] here to Solomon he stopped fighting the
[1:00:50] good fight of faith and we've got us
[1:00:52] we've got to keep fighting we've got to
[1:00:55] be those who will fight remember when
[1:00:57] David didn't go out to battle what
[1:00:58] happened a sin with Bathsheba happening
[1:01:00] he should have been out there with the
[1:01:02] king with the Kings right with all the
[1:01:04] people he shooting out there battling
[1:01:06] right because it is about battles it is
[1:01:09] about overcoming st. it is about driving
[1:01:12] back the kingdom of Satan and making the
[1:01:15] kingdom of God move on or grow it is
[1:01:18] about that so Solomon was worried about
[1:01:22] things he can't control and he caused
[1:01:25] his own heart to despair does that
[1:01:28] remind you of job job caused his own
[1:01:31] heart to fear okay
[1:01:34] the RAM said that's in job 325 for the
[1:01:37] thing which I feared greatly is come
[1:01:40] upon me and in that which I am afraid of
[1:01:42] is come unto me brother Branham said job
[1:01:44] draw all those things upon it so the
[1:01:49] loss of his family the loss of his Anne
[1:01:51] the loss of his his property the loss of
[1:01:55] his health he brought all that on
[1:01:57] because he would sit there wonder he
[1:01:59] would fear
[1:01:59] I wonder God's the best I wonder if I'm
[1:02:01] gonna lose it all he just wouldn't worry
[1:02:04] about it and so just like Joe brought
[1:02:07] that upon himself by worried by being so
[1:02:10] scared
[1:02:11] so did Solomon bring this despair
[1:02:14] hopelessness upon himself who's your
[1:02:17] biggest enemy yourself yourself we leave
[1:02:21] me we can't let the bars on we can't let
[1:02:23] our our sword on it's okay saying not I
[1:02:26] won't find a job i won't i won't rebuke
[1:02:28] you anymore
[1:02:29] we've gotta just be like satan get
[1:02:31] behind me satan right maybe just like
[1:02:33] jesus get behind me Satan I rebuke you a
[1:02:35] name that's what we have to do we have
[1:02:37] to keep fighting keep driving him back
[1:02:39] remember because Jesus drove him back
[1:02:41] three times what he got tempted and what
[1:02:43] the Bible say Satan left him for our
[1:02:45] season how many one enjoy a season of
[1:02:47] little little temptations and trials
[1:02:49] you've got to drive him back though you
[1:02:51] gotta fight him three times in a row
[1:02:53] drive him back it's written it's written
[1:02:54] it's written and then you'll have a
[1:02:56] little season of rest by the grace of
[1:02:58] God Jillian we call those mountaintop
[1:03:00] experiences hallelujah with Solomon was
[1:03:04] not he let down his sword he let down
[1:03:06] his shield and he entered and he caused
[1:03:09] himself to despair he caused himself to
[1:03:13] be hopeless and this thought came to me
[1:03:16] I don't know if I preaches you it or not
[1:03:17] but yeah I think I did but I want to say
[1:03:19] it again this is why people many people
[1:03:21] commit the suicide because it's just a
[1:03:24] perversion of the real desire that I
[1:03:27] share that Lydia my own kinda sure that
[1:03:28] wasn't because the real desire is I
[1:03:32] don't want my own will to live anymore
[1:03:35] that's the real desire in other words I
[1:03:38] want my own fleshly desires to die right
[1:03:42] walls that I die once a week on Sunday I
[1:03:44] die daily
[1:03:46] right so the real the real desire is I'm
[1:03:51] so I'm so hopeless and helpless of my
[1:03:54] own ability I've got to crucify my own
[1:03:57] desires that Christ might live in me
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] does everybody see that but see Satan
[1:04:03] perverts that and makes it
[1:04:05] oh it's so hopeless just end your life
[1:04:07] but Jesus said you've got to lose your
[1:04:09] life to find it amen so it's different
[1:04:12] so st. Robertson says end your natural
[1:04:15] light you know to end your natural life
[1:04:17] but Jesus says and your spiritual
[1:04:19] desires your evil spiritual desires and
[1:04:22] desire the things of God that you can
[1:04:25] actually live that's how you actually
[1:04:28] live crucifying what you were to do and
[1:04:31] obey the Word of God amen that's truly
[1:04:34] living so we have to keep the devil's
[1:04:38] off us keep fighting by the Word of God
[1:04:41] and by prayer amen so Solomon was no
[1:04:45] longer content with just living before
[1:04:47] God he was caring too much about his
[1:04:50] earthly works and what would happen to
[1:04:51] them why would he worry you know an
[1:04:54] honest church why does it really matter
[1:04:56] what's gonna happen after we die
[1:04:57] what is it really matter as long as we
[1:04:59] served on while we're alive that's all
[1:05:01] that counts
[1:05:02] here's the Bible's that we live once and
[1:05:04] then the judgment right name Hebrew says
[1:05:07] that so we don't even worry about who
[1:05:09] cares at this house gets ruined
[1:05:10] afterward who cares what happens to the
[1:05:12] car they're just tools right now so I
[1:05:14] can serve Jesus Christ
[1:05:15] I'm gonna use them to glorify Jesus
[1:05:18] Christ
[1:05:19] I'm never gonna put them above Christ
[1:05:20] I'm gonna put them under Christ and let
[1:05:23] them be used to glorify the name of the
[1:05:25] Lord whatever job or whatever you do
[1:05:28] whatever tells you everything is under
[1:05:30] Christ Christ is number one and
[1:05:32] everything else is just under that we
[1:05:34] never let them greater and I did 18 19
[1:05:43] 20 21 for the air 222 823 I think it's
[1:05:46] more the same for what half man of all
[1:05:49] his labor and of the vexation of his
[1:05:51] heart wherein he have labored under the
[1:05:54] Sun for all his days or sorrows and his
[1:05:58] trivial grief yay
[1:06:00] his heart taketh not rest in the night
[1:06:03] this is also vanity all right now
[1:06:06] Solomon gets so hopeless or depressed
[1:06:09] that he says all of man's days are
[1:06:12] sorrows now stop and think he had so
[1:06:15] many days where he said I had everything
[1:06:17] my eyes one
[1:06:19] was every one of his day sorrow nobody
[1:06:22] so depressed he's making these
[1:06:24] exaggerations have you ever exaggerated
[1:06:26] and said boy today was just an awful day
[1:06:30] and maybe it really wasn't that awful
[1:06:32] or that I had you all the work I've
[1:06:42] heard I've heard by myself or you always
[1:06:46] do this or you always say that when
[1:06:49] really that's not a waste you see how we
[1:06:53] all get discouraged sometimes that's
[1:06:55] what we know that's probably a good idea
[1:06:56] for us to our children too it's and me
[1:06:59] too it's a good it's a good kind of
[1:07:01] indicator that we're kind of getting
[1:07:02] hopeless or helpless when we start
[1:07:05] exaggerating and they get sue Michael
[1:07:07] I'm the only one who does this room I do
[1:07:08] all the work I'm the only one or
[1:07:12] exaggerated Salman was exaggerating
[1:07:17] think of all the children Salman had but
[1:07:19] that was that was that sorrow deaf
[1:07:21] children no think of his first wedding
[1:07:24] was out of sorrow no what about Jews
[1:07:26] that were faithfully serving God
[1:07:28] what about cross a life that got
[1:07:30] converted into Judaism would those be
[1:07:31] days of sorrow no so see he's so
[1:07:35] discouraged he's so he's so hopeless
[1:07:37] he's so backslidden that all he does is
[1:07:41] exaggerate and he fails to see all the
[1:07:44] good days in his life that's why I love
[1:07:47] Facebook cuz I get to see her - all
[1:07:48] remember this day
[1:07:49] oh brother when we did that remember
[1:07:51] when Malachi got baptized and liddy
[1:07:53] indication and name that's how I like to
[1:07:54] see those memories pop up because it
[1:07:57] reminds me of all the glorious days I
[1:07:59] don't put bad days on Facebook but we
[1:08:02] must remember that and Salah was so
[1:08:06] depressed he said a man's heart cannot
[1:08:08] rest in the night
[1:08:09] he's just generalizing he stereotyping
[1:08:12] because that's that's not what he said
[1:08:14] in proverbs 3:24 so in Ecclesiastes -
[1:08:18] he's saying you can't sleep and then
[1:08:20] proverbs 3:24 he says thou shalt lie
[1:08:23] down and I sleep she'll be sweet
[1:08:26] so in Proverbs he said all I'm sleeping
[1:08:29] and sweet and then in Cleese a sees he's
[1:08:31] like I never get any sleep so see what
[1:08:35] happens see see the effects of sin you
[1:08:38] go from enjoying life loving life loving
[1:08:40] God excited about God - everything's
[1:08:43] hopeless
[1:08:44] everything's useless what good is it to
[1:08:47] do this what good is it to do to make it
[1:08:49] better to wear better clothes what good
[1:08:51] is it to make your house better because
[1:08:54] you're depressed because that's the
[1:08:55] spirit right it's an evil spirit instead
[1:08:57] of being full of life you're full of
[1:08:59] death so hope you can see this could
[1:09:02] everybody see is it pretty clear mmm see
[1:09:04] how clear it is this man is so Baxton
[1:09:06] the wisest man is so backslidden he's
[1:09:08] not using wisdom anymore he's totally
[1:09:10] rejected the wisdom God gave him
[1:09:14] remember jesus promised to give rest so
[1:09:16] some would say there's no rest but Jesus
[1:09:19] was gonna give him a hope amen
[1:09:20] he said come unto me all that labor and
[1:09:23] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:09:25] amen that was a thousand years before
[1:09:27] Christ that's not a thousand years after
[1:09:30] Solomon that Christ said that so all
[1:09:32] those all those men you know they got
[1:09:34] tired they got simple they got worn out
[1:09:36] and they back slid all these things and
[1:09:38] but Jesus coming he's coming to tell you
[1:09:40] now when they give you rest into your
[1:09:42] soul it's here and it's the baptism of
[1:09:44] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:46] that is the rest to your soul your soul
[1:09:49] doesn't have to be a hopeless tonight
[1:09:50] doesn't have to feel helpless our souls
[1:09:52] don't have to be in despair because the
[1:09:54] Holy Ghost gives us hope amen hallelujah
[1:09:57] he said take my yoke upon you take my
[1:10:00] burden learn of me I'm meek and lowly in
[1:10:03] heart and you shall find rest unto your
[1:10:04] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:10:07] is light hallelujah now Solomon he kind
[1:10:12] of comes to himself in verse 24 so Lydia
[1:10:16] can read 24 alright so he sees eating
[1:10:30] eating with your family fellowship are
[1:10:33] from the hand of God and we should thank
[1:10:36] God for that
[1:10:37] now we often take that for granted don't
[1:10:40] we
[1:10:40] because if we've never had tragedy
[1:10:42] strike our homes I think about families
[1:10:44] that have had they've lost children
[1:10:46] they've lost husbands wives they've lost
[1:10:50] people so close to them and they feel
[1:10:53] the pain of eating together and not
[1:10:57] having someone there but soliders trying
[1:10:59] to remind us make sure every meals that
[1:11:01] you remember is a gift from God
[1:11:03] make sure the times when brother Aaron
[1:11:05] bring food over on Wednesday night make
[1:11:07] sure you enjoy it's a gift from God and
[1:11:09] they sure like the ribs that's me that's
[1:11:12] a gift from God now we're not pressuring
[1:11:14] you do that every time we never pressure
[1:11:16] anybody but just the fact that our
[1:11:19] family is together and we're happy we're
[1:11:22] healthy we're not dying in the hospital
[1:11:23] praise God you know thank God
[1:11:26] yesterday I saw Kylie Rose and her
[1:11:28] hair's getting so long and she said
[1:11:30] thank you for the letter by the way and
[1:11:33] I just I cried what I said every time
[1:11:38] dying from cancer or prayed for you and
[1:11:42] so she ends her for a year we prayed and
[1:11:44] fasted one day a couple days for her I
[1:11:46] think two two times I think he prayed
[1:11:48] and fasted for her those who could and
[1:11:51] it's just it's so it's so enjoyable and
[1:11:54] she told her mom she said as soon as she
[1:11:57] was in the hospital she saw an angel and
[1:11:59] then she told her mom and she said that
[1:12:01] man mr. Smith he's really close to God
[1:12:03] and she didn't know nothing about it she
[1:12:05] doesn't know nothing about the message
[1:12:06] reason which she consents and she was my
[1:12:09] student she can sense that God is with
[1:12:11] us
[1:12:12] amen and so see these are gifts from God
[1:12:15] just the ability to have for her family
[1:12:18] to have Kylie Rose at lunch that's it
[1:12:20] you forgot to eat supper as a family
[1:12:23] that's a gift from God we should cherish
[1:12:25] every moment praise the Lord
[1:12:26] amen did you know brother Branham said
[1:12:31] we don't know what value is
[1:12:37] and he said what's value Oh guys did you
[1:12:40] know if I had a hundred million dollars
[1:12:42] laying it on me he said I had a little
[1:12:47] button here and if I press this button
[1:12:49] I lose my hundred million dollars but I
[1:12:51] get to talk with my old dad that's dead
[1:12:53] and gone on for one hour as a mortal
[1:12:57] being again what would I do what would
[1:13:00] you do think about someone who who's not
[1:13:04] here you can't talk to my brother James
[1:13:05] Brown think about anyone that we've lost
[1:13:08] and you had a hundred million dollars or
[1:13:11] a button if you press the button the
[1:13:13] money falls through the floor but then
[1:13:15] your loved one is there and you get the
[1:13:17] talk thing for one out which one whether
[1:13:19] we have said no hesitation I press the
[1:13:22] button amen hmm I give a hundred million
[1:13:27] dollars this morning to sit my dad down
[1:13:29] in this chair I teach this lesson my
[1:13:31] creech he said but what's money worth
[1:13:35] how much more is a soul than money
[1:13:38] hey man thinking about that a hundred
[1:13:41] million or button for one hour he said I
[1:13:44] do in a heartbeat that's the value of at
[1:13:48] the time that we have together that's
[1:13:51] the value so we don't want to take it
[1:13:53] for granted the Bible said godliness
[1:13:57] with contentment is a great game and
[1:13:59] contentment means a perfect condition of
[1:14:02] life in which no aid or support is
[1:14:05] needed I don't need anything
[1:14:06] that's contentment I don't need your
[1:14:09] help I don't need anyone's support I've
[1:14:10] got everything I need
[1:14:12] that's contentment so a godly life with
[1:14:15] contentment is great gain that's in the
[1:14:18] scripture says for we brought nothing
[1:14:19] into this world what did Genevieve bring
[1:14:21] to our family did she bring any money
[1:14:24] with her no you bring any uh any jewelry
[1:14:29] any credit cards she didn't bring
[1:14:33] anything Michie all she brought us was
[1:14:34] what joy that's all she brought us you
[1:14:38] cannot bring anything in the world and
[1:14:40] in certain you can't take anything out
[1:14:42] they can make it very easy things with
[1:14:44] you in your casket or whatever they do
[1:14:46] but you're not taking it with you
[1:14:48] to stay here on this earth so the Bible
[1:14:51] says having food and raiment let us be
[1:14:53] therewith content just be happy with
[1:14:56] food and clothes the Bible said doesn't
[1:14:58] even say money just said food including
[1:15:00] colors because they that be rich fall
[1:15:04] into temptation in the snare and into
[1:15:06] many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:15:09] all right brother man talked about
[1:15:14] Johnny Appleseed how many were in Johnny
[1:15:16] Appleseed I was kind of like a legend
[1:15:18] where he went through North America and
[1:15:19] planted all these apple trees and
[1:15:21] program says he likes that story because
[1:15:24] he's like that's what I like to do he
[1:15:28] quotes a poem and said um partings leave
[1:15:30] behind us footprints on the sands of
[1:15:32] time footprints that perhaps another
[1:15:35] while sailing over life's I love Maine a
[1:15:37] forlorn and shipwrecked brother in sing
[1:15:40] shall take heart again for the RAM said
[1:15:44] that's what we all like to see something
[1:15:46] that we have did that will cause others
[1:15:49] to benefit by what we have done amen
[1:15:53] so that's what's most important we all
[1:15:56] want to see that our lives have helped
[1:15:58] somebody else so especially us adults
[1:16:01] right because the children they don't
[1:16:02] have as many resources as we do but
[1:16:05] children you still can do great things
[1:16:07] because Kylie Rose said that they her
[1:16:09] mom said that they they made 400 bags of
[1:16:11] love this summer never take those 400
[1:16:14] bags into the hospital going to children
[1:16:16] that I've cancer and so Kylie's one girl
[1:16:19] who can see the impact she has on people
[1:16:22] and we might not have that same calling
[1:16:26] in life but we can still all find
[1:16:28] something to do like for example with
[1:16:31] Malachi playing piano like if people say
[1:16:35] oh Malik I enjoyed that which we have
[1:16:36] many people on Sunday say Oh Malachi we
[1:16:38] enjoyed your play so Malik I could see
[1:16:40] wow in my life I did something that
[1:16:42] helped other people or when Lydia some
[1:16:45] of the children told me thank you for
[1:16:47] making them the bracelets you can see
[1:16:49] you helped put a smile on somebody's
[1:16:51] face or case you're holding Genevieve
[1:16:53] and I could say thank you patient I
[1:16:55] couldn't get her to stop crying but you
[1:16:56] did and you can you can feel the benefit
[1:17:00] of
[1:17:00] or thanks for making breakfast now the
[1:17:03] children aren't starving is it such a
[1:17:05] great job you see so you can see that
[1:17:09] your life benefits others and that's
[1:17:11] what I like to tell you children thank
[1:17:12] you for what you do because you need to
[1:17:14] see that your life has an impact what if
[1:17:16] she wasn't here what if we didn't have
[1:17:18] Olivia
[1:17:19] what if malecon I wasn't more what if
[1:17:21] acacia was aboard life would be totally
[1:17:24] different and you have a special place
[1:17:27] you have a special position in God's
[1:17:29] family that you bless other people with
[1:17:32] amen Wingull friends Samedi remember
[1:17:41] salmon derringer some old building did
[1:17:43] me I don't think we did it's on the tour
[1:17:44] I think we had time to visit it well
[1:17:48] brother man was talking to Sam Adair the
[1:17:50] doctor he says how you doing bill Oh a
[1:17:51] pretty fair I suppose yourself Oh lots
[1:17:54] of patients I had 15 examinations
[1:17:55] afternoon you imagine 15 I think the
[1:17:58] doctor I saw the other day had like
[1:18:00] three in the morning and three in the
[1:18:01] afternoon and Sam and air at 15 this
[1:18:07] afternoon so he was probably a lot
[1:18:10] faster than what are you doctors but he
[1:18:14] said well that's just as good as long as
[1:18:15] those examinations and find nothing
[1:18:17] wrong brother branham said he said we
[1:18:20] got to talking about backing her boys I
[1:18:22] said well doc I don't know just how long
[1:18:24] I'm gonna be around we're both in our
[1:18:25] 50s because that's true bill but all
[1:18:28] these years about 31 years in ministry
[1:18:30] now I've kept my heart prepared for that
[1:18:32] hour when he comes
[1:18:37] doesn't matter when he comes Sam Adair
[1:18:41] said the greatest thrill I have is what
[1:18:45] do you think it is what's the doctor's
[1:18:46] greatest thrill assume a patient
[1:18:49] recovered something like that he said
[1:18:51] living for others and that's exactly
[1:18:53] what that's what happens when a doctor's
[1:18:56] is living for others he's helping people
[1:18:58] get better the greatest thrill in his
[1:19:01] life is living for others and brother
[1:19:04] Graham said that's what life is it makes
[1:19:07] life real who wants life to feel real
[1:19:09] good it's not what you do or accomplish
[1:19:12] for yourself but what you can do for
[1:19:15] others so chilled remember Sunday when
[1:19:17] there's lots of people at the altar pray
[1:19:20] when I see that I can look and say wow
[1:19:22] that's what god help me do for somebody
[1:19:24] else or the camp said they haven't had a
[1:19:26] service like that in a long time very
[1:19:28] good
[1:19:29] so God really moved and God was speaking
[1:19:30] to people and shouting and scream and
[1:19:33] dancing the spirit it was just a really
[1:19:34] good time to the Lord people are getting
[1:19:36] victory over things that they probably
[1:19:38] left in their life too long so when I
[1:19:41] can look back and say wow I didn't I did
[1:19:45] not get the rest relax this weekend I
[1:19:46] was working and I'm still worn out just
[1:19:49] from this weekend but that's one thing I
[1:19:51] can look at and say I did not do that
[1:19:52] really for myself I did that for
[1:19:54] somebody else and I can say thank the
[1:19:57] Lord that ought to be the biggest thrill
[1:19:59] of my life and we ought to find each one
[1:20:01] of us should find the biggest thrill in
[1:20:03] our life how we can help others or get
[1:20:05] people well or or do something to
[1:20:08] benefit other people that should be the
[1:20:10] biggest thrill let me set the time roots
[1:20:13] let me go about ten moments by God's
[1:20:14] grace because we're getting close to the
[1:20:19] time here algorithm so that brings me to
[1:20:24] thinking of 31 years of ministry for the
[1:20:26] Lord I guess every man thinks of some
[1:20:29] time when he's come to his last service
[1:20:30] and come his last hour and look back
[1:20:33] down the path and see what's been
[1:20:36] accomplished and see what's went on and
[1:20:39] he's asked himself have you did anything
[1:20:41] and I just said it's what you do for
[1:20:44] others that counts that's a good feeling
[1:20:49] to be able to look back and say
[1:20:51] in 2017 here's what God used me to do in
[1:20:55] 2016 remember this when God did this
[1:20:57] number 2015 you can look back down the
[1:21:01] road of life say wow remember this
[1:21:03] happened in 2005 2000 1999 God was doing
[1:21:07] all these things that's what counts for
[1:21:10] the kingdom of God when you look back
[1:21:12] and say wow God used me to help this one
[1:21:14] God use me to help that one the RAM said
[1:21:19] I often wonder what it would be like
[1:21:21] when I get to the end of my road which
[1:21:23] we don't know what time that will be
[1:21:25] none of us so I was thinking about
[1:21:28] looking back down along the trail where
[1:21:30] I've come through life and I've seen the
[1:21:32] different hills and briar patches and
[1:21:34] rocks and hard places and smooth
[1:21:37] runnings and what I did in those kind of
[1:21:40] times it'll all show up one of these
[1:21:43] days at the hour am I going away per me
[1:21:47] and it'll do that on each one of us we
[1:21:52] will all be sure of that and he'll show
[1:21:54] up to each one when that time comes all
[1:21:59] right now let's close with Ecclesiastes
[1:22:02] chapter 3 because chapter 2 ends with
[1:22:06] this kind of sad note he just talked
[1:22:15] about all I made myself despaired I
[1:22:17] found the only good thing is the gift of
[1:22:21] God they eating and drinking the family
[1:22:24] time that we have together and brother
[1:22:28] Branham said we're all gonna look back
[1:22:30] down the trail and he said what I want
[1:22:34] to make sure I highlight that what I did
[1:22:35] in those kinds of times to think about
[1:22:41] this what what time of your life is it
[1:22:43] right now brother Graham listen is it a
[1:22:46] hill like you're climbing up a hill a
[1:22:48] hard uphill battle is it a briar patch
[1:22:52] we're getting poked and pulling out the
[1:22:55] thorns because if you like you're
[1:22:58] stepping on rocks and hard places I know
[1:23:01] when I step out on the driveway without
[1:23:02] shoes on
[1:23:04] - rough vlog I don't enjoy that walk
[1:23:08] weather order or is it the other side is
[1:23:10] it smooth running everything is going
[1:23:13] smooth like on your bike you just cruise
[1:23:14] it you're just you just you're just
[1:23:17] going along for the ride and the winds
[1:23:19] blowing through your hair it's a good
[1:23:21] tenant which one is which one are you in
[1:23:24] right now
[1:23:24] a hill briar patch rocks or smooth
[1:23:28] runnings my brother Graham said what did
[1:23:31] you do in those kind of times
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:39] which spirits inside we doing the happy
[1:23:42] times do we do we go overboard and and
[1:23:45] spend too much money on the things of
[1:23:47] the world and the happy times or do we
[1:23:49] rejoice mo do we stay diligent and don't
[1:23:51] get caught up on the things of the world
[1:23:52] or stay faithful to God well we just got
[1:23:55] so much money we don't forgive it we
[1:23:56] don't go to church as much anymore we're
[1:23:58] just we're doing so good out of this
[1:24:00] thing else to give Church and I'll just
[1:24:01] go shopping or something like that well
[1:24:04] how do we act in the good times or the
[1:24:07] hard times well it's it's so depressing
[1:24:09] I don't want to go see anybody at church
[1:24:11] I don't want to help anybody out all
[1:24:13] those homeless people get helped out
[1:24:15] themselves who cares about them go get a
[1:24:17] job yeah how do we act in the hard times
[1:24:21] how did we handle the hard times I let
[1:24:24] me handle the briar patches how do we
[1:24:27] have the how do we handle the
[1:24:28] frustrations how do we act now we're all
[1:24:31] gonna act wrong some point right but
[1:24:33] we've got to get back
[1:24:37] again
[1:24:49] let's just take turn so I'll read one
[1:24:51] and all you can read two to everything
[1:24:54] there's a season and a time to every
[1:24:56] purpose under the heaven so you guys
[1:24:59] read verse 2 1 3 1 2 3 2 which is Queen
[1:25:08] a time to kill and a time to heal a time
[1:25:11] to break down and a time to build up a
[1:25:21] time to cast away stones and a time to
[1:25:24] gather stones together a time to embrace
[1:25:27] and a time to refrain from embracing
[1:25:30] verse 6 1 2 3
[1:25:38] a time to Rend and a time is so a time
[1:25:42] to keep silence and a time to speak
[1:25:44] verse 8 1 2 3 the same to our feet my
[1:25:53] countries where the brand says this
[1:25:55] about tithing the RAM said there is five
[1:26:02] months I want you remember these no
[1:26:04] matter how sincere a man may be in doing
[1:26:06] it doing God a service there's five must
[1:26:09] be there first it must be his time to do
[1:26:13] it think about what you're desiring he
[1:26:16] said God's time and do it what if Moses
[1:26:19] want to come and say we'll build an ark
[1:26:21] and float up the Nile is that like Noah
[1:26:25] did what if he would have said that that
[1:26:28] had been the right time Noah's time was
[1:26:32] all right for the ark but not for Moses
[1:26:35] this time what if Jesus would have come
[1:26:40] and said I'll tell you what we just go
[1:26:41] up on the mouth like Moses did and get a
[1:26:43] new declaration of laws on the stones
[1:26:47] did Jesus do that no brother Ram said he
[1:26:51] was that law he didn't need the laws of
[1:26:54] stones are laws on stone he was the
[1:26:57] he was the law made flesh amen so you
[1:27:01] must be in his time it must be in his
[1:27:03] season
[1:27:04] you got that now must be in his time
[1:27:06] must be in his season he said time and
[1:27:09] season
[1:27:10] all right so Malachi just come and play
[1:27:13] in God's time here as we as we get ready
[1:27:17] to pray and close the service this is
[1:27:20] what we must think about if we overcome
[1:27:23] with despair why are we overcome with
[1:27:25] despair
[1:27:26] what have we allowed ourselves to
[1:27:29] meditate upon that wasn't the plan of
[1:27:32] God it wasn't the will of God no we
[1:27:36] don't be discouraged the churches
[1:27:38] flooded we could all just spare about
[1:27:39] them or we could choose to rejoice in
[1:27:41] all things saying oh it's just a test
