TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I preached last night in Columbus got home about 11 20 last night had a really good nice little service there so I'm a little worn out this is the fifth time preaching in seven days so my voice is a little teeny bit hoarse but it's a joy to preach the gospel we're so thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ all of his blessings all of his goodness Genesis 24 verse 6. the Saints have been really encouraged down there in Junction City and brother Irvin was telling me last night he's like brother I can't believe all the things I've heard just since March so in March he came in the message March April May June just four months he said our minds are just blown he said we our whole lives we knew nothing of this he says now it's just like every Service is like an explosion of Revelation Church they drove two and a half hours I'm sorry they didn't interacted they drove a whole hour last night for the service and then right back to their house and then they're having service at his house this morning so uh just wonderful keep those little babes in Christ in prayer Hallelujah if they're really really growing right now they're really enjoying the word of God Hallelujah Genesis 24 verse 6. I'd like to preach on Ellie easer the model servant just a it's a good message about brother Brandon's Ministry for us and how important it was for us to kind of ministered on that last night by the grace of God and the people really enjoyed it you know each service goes a little different depending on the needs of the people I had a brother he's got to be in his 40s and maybe 50s and he'd come up and he doesn't speak English so he had an interpreter and he told me he said I really enjoyed the message tonight especially as you minister to the young people our young people really need to experience with God he said I just he said I just want to thank you he said I hope you'll come back many times well if the Lord keeps my car going I'll probably do that but it was really great that people really people really enjoyed the word of God we all did it was it's a beautiful time I told Austin's testimony about being healed from the migraine last weekend other testimonies from the Saints so people really blessed Genesis 24 verse 6 and 7. I'd like to preach on Eliezer the model servant verse 6 says and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again let's read verse seven together one two three the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from things let's have one more word of prayer here let's bow our heads here father God we thank you for today Lord let your kingdom come today let your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven we thank you Heavenly Father you have been perfect on our lives Lord God yes you've allowed us to go through trials but they've taught us so many lessons Lord God as I found in my humble short little insignificant life Lord everything I went through there was a purpose behind it Lord God and you spared me much worse things God you've been so gracious Lord God even in my sins you haven't punished me Lord like I would deserve as the Bible says in the Book of Psalms Lord even in my failures my mistakes you've been so kind and so gracious so I just want to thank you Heavenly Father for another day today to be in your house and Lord we thank you God for the loving fathers and the fathers that we all had Lord ultimately you're the great father and we just want to give you thanks and praise speak to us here today through your word as you did last night there father I pray you just be gracious to us let us hear your truth and accept it believe it and speak it act upon it Lord in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I just have one picture I like to show here you know by God's grace and get this going here let's see does that work okay I'm just going to leave that up there for a little while this picture is in that book I gave everybody uh the message companion I just gave one to Nina and Austin and one to Zur just that's just a tremendous book if you haven't read that I really would encourage you to read that uh Marcus Beckers I think he's from Germany and he has a great grasp on the message he keeps a good balance he doesn't go fanaticism with any you know dreams from other Branham or Benny Visions he doesn't take anything to a fanatical level and uh so this is the text we're working with if you've got your Bible let's just read through this chapter here parts of this chapter if you're not familiar with the story Genesis chapter 24. um I kind of felt like I should preach this since I didn't preach it at our church so I thought I don't wanna leave you guys out if there's anything that you might be blessed by the people really blessed last night even Sergey got up and said the Lord truly spoke to my heart tonight and I thank the Lord for his word so chapter 24 is of course and this is kind of some semi from here we've been looking at Abraham and this is a uh Abraham sending Ellie easer to get a bride for Isaac so this is the picture of Ellie easer now of course in the store I think he had 10 camels if not more camels but in this story Abraham was getting old Sarah had passed away I believe if I'm not mistaken yes she passed away in the previous chapter Abraham had already been tested you know with offering up Isaac that was back in chapter 22. and so now Abraham's getting old and and God had blessed him in all things and I can say God's blessed me in all things too praise God hallelujah I trust you can say the same by the grace of the Lord and uh I just want you to me you know we can maybe just kind of summarize this a little bit but he speaks to Abraham I'm sorry he speaks to LA azer and uh makes him promise that he'll go get a a bride for his son Isaac and uh of course this makes Eleazar very nervous you know he asks questions like what if she won't come over then he's like then Abraham's like well then you're free from The Vow but he said swear to me Abraham made him swear swear to me you'll get a bride from my kindred and my family a church in those days you know there was different customs and in this case if you look at verse 2 if I'm not mistaken yeah he said put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh now this is a little bit uh maybe embarrassing to think about but he hell the azer had to put his hand under the thigh of Abraham and promise that was how you promised in those days now just so you know there's been a lot Satan's really used that verse to create some evil things going down the realm of homosexuality within churches it happened over there at Ernest angley's Church just let you know I wasn't far away it's up in Cuyahoga Falls that was one of the verses that these people when they come out and they got interviewed it's just like Satan he'll take something that's good something that's holy and he'll pervert it so the preachers would use that verse to start touching men inappropriately it's the same devil that would say oh David and Jonathan had a love that was greater than a woman the same devil that makes that homosexuality is the same devil that misuses this I just want to be I want you to be aware Church you know with pure Minds God gives us pure hearts thank God for that but when people have evil motives and objectives they'll take anything like something like this something holy and sacred like this they'll take this and they'll use it for their lust of the flesh church one way we know we're with Christ Jesus is that he leads us away from sin into righteousness that's one way for sure we know God is with us hallelujah he's not leading us into sin he's leading us into Holiness he's leading us into a Godly life so I'm thankful for a church where we can have the Holy Spirit here praise God and guide us into more Holiness Hallelujah amen and of course uh you know he goes off and uh and he goes on the trip and I love verse 7 though and he said and he shall send his Angel before thee so Abraham says that angel is going to go before you Eliezer amen hallelujah is that is that beautiful how God sent an angel before Moses anytime God wants to make sure something gets accomplished he sends an angel to do it amen praise God this case it's beautiful because the type of brother Branham Hallelujah God sent his faithful model servant brother Branham to go get a bride before his son Isaac her son Jesus amen praise God I'm going to prove that by the Bible that's a total Bible truth amen but brother random had an angel and he'd always tell the people and angels with me and they could sense brother man could sense when the angel was standing at his side ready to do the sermon lines praise God hallelujah I'm gonna tell him the thoughts and and intents and secrets of his heart it's just beautiful but Church don't forget that you have a guardian angel as well Psalm 34 verse 7 and the angel of the Lord and campeth round about all them that fear Him and delivereth them think about any time in life where you've been delivered from Death delivered from destruction delivered from Evil delivered from abuse anytime you've been delivered it was your angel that did it praise God God sent his Holy Angel to keep you you know from dying you know when I almost drowned there I remember I was looking up I looking at the sun and said this is this is the end of me I was thinking of maybe nine or ten years old and all of a sudden my cousin reached down there Adam or Matt and reached down there and just pulled me up with his big strong teenage arms you know he pulled out little Jesse and I was I was dead but what was that it was the angel just moved him to do it praise God hallelujah or the time I was driving I was with my friend my friend Jason was driving we're driving a football practice out at Goodyear and he was saying he said I'm going to be a car driver I'm going to be a race car driver and he went 90 miles per hour and I'm like grabbing my seat like this dude's crazy oh God and he forgot her exit and then he tried to exit real fast we spun out it was we were probably going 70 80 miles per hour we spun out across four lanes the exit lane and then the three Highway Lanes I thought this is it I'm done I'm dead and we came about five inches away from the concrete barrier between the highways and as soon as we stopped I saw all these 18 wheelers fly by and I thought Jesus just saved my life I wasn't even saved yet I would have went probably went to hell had I died right there but what was it the angel of the Lord encamps around all them that feared God too many people had prayed too many prayers amen and God had a four-dained plan for my life praise God just like he's got a plan for your life amen there's a reason Satan couldn't take it there's a reason awful things that happened it was the angel of the Lord God had a mission for you praise God hallelujah God sent you to Akron Hallelujah God sent you here hallelujah with the mission to glorify God hallelujah and ultimately I believe for all of us to save some Souls Hallelujah we don't know how many but the Bible said the wise will try to win souls so may the Lord help us to try to win Soul so we get some beautiful thoughts in here now you're you're uh you're a good Bible reading church so we don't have to read it but Ephesians 5 verse 23 says uh that uh the the Christ loves uh I'm sorry that we ought to love husbands all love their wives as Christ loves the church so a husband and wife is symbolic of Christ and the church Hallelujah but I do want to read second Corinthians 11 verse two so if you have your Bibles go to Second Corinthians 11 verse two I want to read that this may be a a thought for you and really I'll just say like this church really in every Church age Eliezer type the church age messenger not just brother Branham but everyone because of second Corinthians 11 verse 2. amen you want to read that since you got it buddy good thank you yeah second Corinthians 11 verse two no you're fine sorry about a second my phone second amen thank you brother now this is the Corinthian Church right so somehow when Paul preached the gospel he preached them Acts 2 38 right he would have you got to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you receive the Holy Ghost and all those that accepted when they when they confess their sins they are baptized it's as if Paul if I can get off my ring here it's as if Paul put a wedding band of engagement on their finger right and and so we see that and God sent a man to do that Glory Hallelujah a man so that's why this type works for brother random it works for Paul right it works for every every preacher every Church age messenger he's sent to preach and when they accept Jesus Christ the preacher engages them now you're engaged to Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful it's it's completely bible-based but a lot of people don't miss it or a lot of people miss that because they don't have the message of the hour praise God and brother Adam said Paul will present his group that all those that got saved think of all the people that got saved millions of people that got saved under Paul's Ministry Paul will present them as a virgin to Christ amen hallelujah my brother random will present us as a chaste version of Christ Hallelujah oh it's so true and remember church I mean that's even scriptural since you're there let's go to Hebrews 13. even I even your pastor wherever Church even if you leave this church wherever you go to God bless you wherever you would go you know but your pastor's got to answer for your life as well right just like a father has to answer for his family a mother has to answer for her children so there's accountability under the the groups that that you're saved under and it's completely scriptural nobody can tell you this ain't the Bible it's the Bible Hebrews 11 uh I'm sorry Hebrews 13 sorry Hebrews 13 7-8 and then there's another verse there too verse 7 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation so any preacher must be an example to the people if not he's not fit to be a preacher and he doesn't rule by his own thoughts he Rules by the word of God the doctrine that I preach the doctrine that we preach here it rules all of our lives in my life included even in my own marriage I've always told my wife I said I never want to ask you to do something I'm not willing to do that's always been our agreement since the beginning and Wednesday is our 20th anniversary by God's grace so we made it 20 years courted or dated five years because we didn't know better so 25 years huh it's hard to believe but 20 years of marriage and then the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday it's saying forever so in context this has always been this way you have a Godly leader and then he Rules by the word of God he leads by the word of God everybody follows and that's the way Jesus has always done it praise God now go down to verse 17 is the one that I was getting to obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your soul see the preachers are supposed to watch for your soul make sure your soul is headed toward heaven right a preacher can't make anyone say right a preacher can't uh cause anyone to go to hell either I mean I mean you it's all the every individual has a choice but a preacher can watch over and say yeah I don't I'm concerned about the direction you've chosen and you really need to make sure your soul is right with God right as they that must give account okay so preachers must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so this really tells us amazing things about uh uh the the Judgment seat of Christ and also the white Throne judgment each one of us have to stand there and for our own individual faith and then you know we we got to get some other verses where uh the Bible said we'll have conversations going through our judgment now hopefully by God's grace ours is only for rewards that's what we're believing because the blood of Jesus Christ forgives us all of our sins like we've been laboring on Amen amen so in other words we won't have to have disagreements with the Lord we'll agree with everything Jesus says amen amen but for maybe the foolish virgin or maybe the uh uh the goats whatever we'd say they're gonna they're gonna argue like like Matthew 25 says when did we see you uh or when we see you in prison and we never visited you when did we when did we see you hungry we never gave you food and he says and they'll say when you did it not to the least of these my brethren you did it not unto me right and then part of it Jesus will say uh why didn't you cross Jerusalem he'll tell the Pharisees why don't you cross Jerusalem to hear me preach and they'll say it was we were we were too too far in our denomination and Jesus will say Queen of Sheba queen of South rise up in judgment and she'll say I cross the entire desert to hear a lesser preacher and you had a greater preacher the greatest preacher the only preacher amen the real preacher close to you and you didn't do it and Jesus will say you're condemned because you didn't do it but here the Bible says this preachers have to give an account so at some point I don't know how it works during this process the pastors will have to give account with the church let's say brother let's say servant my servant brother Jesse or whatever brother cam brother Jim Shoemake given a cow of your flock and the Bible said the preachers want to do it with joy so how do you enjoy it the Bible said obey the word and submit to the word of God hallelujah just obey the word of God right that's what the Bible says and the preacher will give an account Hallelujah so I thought I'd start with that you can see a couple good verses there uh I just want you to see the power of prayer go to verse let's go back to Genesis 24 verse 12. Eliezer is very nervous I mean Abraham makes him swear don't bring back a heathen woman don't bring back any other woman from any other Nation it's got to be from my people so he stops with his camels and then in verse 12 he prays and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham and behold I stand Here by the well water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw now church if you read on he don't even know that he's amongst Abraham's family he just went as far as he could and he just thought well I'll just stop here and water the canvas everybody's tired isn't that awesome how God works out situations even when you're tired even when you don't feel like it even when you feel like you're you're Wit's End God still works everything out praise God oh my he's so faithful God Is So merciful in other words God is going to accomplish his purpose in your life amen and then he says Lord you know in verse 14 let it come to pass that the the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camel's drink also let the saying be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou shalt has shown me kindness unto my master and that's exactly what happens now look God honors this sacrifice look at this sacrifice I forget how many miles he traveled Ellie Asia travels all these miles he's under this obligation and then he's so desperate he just prays he said God I give you praise you're the god of my master Let It Be Lord Let It Be Your Will that the first one I talked to let her be the one that will water the camos and that will be my sign because they like this Gideon there's nothing wrong with asking for a sign Gideon amen hallelujah if you're in if if you're in the Lord's uh uh if you're in the Lord's will if you're doing the Lord's plan if you're keeping the word of God I'll say this and if you're in desperation ask God for a sign God will give it to you praise God if it's his will if you're in desperation you've made great sacrifice say God Give Me A Sign so I can keep my promise to you so I can keep your word so I can do what's right he didn't want to make a mistake church we don't want to make a mistake either praise God we want to do what's right Hallelujah I just want to show that with the power of Prayer okay now I'm not going to read all through the rest of this but you know the story Abraham after after Rebecca Waters the cameras I look she was really quick to serve now that's a good lesson for all of our people be quick to serve he didn't have to ask her can you water the camels she just watered the camels if I'm not mistaken she's willing that's a lot of water for 10 camels Church that's a lot of buckets you're carrying there that's a lot of water but she was willing to do it she was a faithful servant the Bible said she was already a Shepherd I believe I'm not not mistaken she's already in a humble a humble position and she just found being humble is a good thing right that's where God will find you that's where you'll find the answer to your question no doubt she wondered who am I going to marry oh all these questions in life but she found the answer by being a servant praise God Amen That's How we'll find the answer that's how we'll find God's will for our lives is serving other people praise God amen that's how you find God's Will by serving others and you know the story as soon as as soon as she she does that he's like Hallelujah he gets out the bracelets and the earrings now we've gone through that at our church we've preached on that many times I believe earrings were honestly earrings were just like tokens of like just like giving you jewels or just get like giving you money that's what I believe by God's grace now there was that one time the Bible said it hung on her face so we don't know how the earrings the Bible they hang on her face so I don't know if they're hanging earrings or what but we know that's Old Testament praise God hallelujah and we know that she'd have holes in her ears or anything like that because God told Moses that's a sign that you're a slave permanently so God would not ask them to cut their ears and have earrings so a different kind of like a maybe like a ceremonial earrings but she gets all those jewels and she runs back and said Dad look at these and and he's like what happened look go tell me about this man let me go talk I'm just kind of paraphrase it and and Eliza goes there and he tells the story how he prayed and Abraham and he said oh I'm Abraham's a nephew I remember him uncle or something like that some some family relation with Abraham I can't remember the Laban was his brother nephew okay amen thank you so some family relation I forget who laban's uh how the relation was but then uh labor said yes oh this is so wonderful uh Rebecca can go is like let's not wait too long I got to get her back as soon as possible right and then laban's like well I don't know about that and and they said let's let the woman decide does she want to stay with her family or does she want to go get married hallelujah oh my God and brother Anderson said that's like the Christian the Christian doesn't want to uh we kind of wait around the Christian wants to make the journey to go meet Christ Jesus hallelujah amen do you want to hang around and say with the worldly family she wants to go be United to Christ amen she wants to go with Ali easer back to Isaac amen we want to follow brother Ram's preaching until we see Jesus amen is that right David that's all I've been doing these last 19 years amen I just been following Brothers message because it's taking me to Jesus hallelujah oh hallelujah thank God so above them you know uh there's numerous sermons where he preaches on this but he just shows you know the urgency Ellie Easter one to he wanted to keep his promise and so he got he got he got her ready and brought Rebecca and then the Bible said in verse 63 you're familiar with this likely 24-63. just to keep this the chapter it's a long chapter compared to some other chapters but as they're approaching the South Country verse 63 and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel okay so this is we'd say love at first sight Hallelujah is that what you had with me honey did you love me at first sight of course but here's love at first sight this what this marriage was ordained from the foundation of the world Amen Hallelujah and brother Ram uses this end of the story to show the rapture Isaac's not in his house when he meets Rebecca he's out in the field and we don't meet Jesus in heaven we meet Jesus in the air praise God right it's a beautiful type of the Rapture praise God so brother and we know Brothers Ministry the word of God is going to take us to Christ it's uniting us to Christ and brothers says it's the camels that took that that took her to meet her husband and brother brother Adam says the camel is the power the Beast or the power and brothers says the power of us is the Holy Ghost amen and all you gotta do is water the camel water the Holy Ghost say I love you Jesus I love your spirit this word is true I believe the Bible I'll obey the Bible I'll let the Bible carry me to meet Jesus amen Hallelujah just gotta water it in other words just gotta ride it amen for 20 years my wife and I have ridden the power of the Holy Spirit praise God keep our family together keep our church together amen we're riding that power every faithful believer does the same They Ride The Power of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen it's a beautiful type now verse 65. for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself that's the last thing Eliezer says hallelujah to Rebecca this is your master so she takes a bail and cover herself in other words that's showing that Isaac was now her headship when she were like when you wear the veil there sister Nina we're excited for that when you were at that Bell that means I have no headship I'm coming under that I have no hatch above my own I'm coming out of the headship of my husband so that's why I was a custom see I think that's why the earrings are accustomed the jewels and the veil these are all Customs we don't find these in the New Testament right they're just customs of these early Saints and so she puts the veil on and then she goes up to meet her husband love at first sight Hallelujah verse 66 and the servant told Isaac all things that he had done hallelujah oh that's good right there the prophet tells Jesus here's all the things I kept your word I appreciate your word amen I traveled around the world brother Jose seven times amen I preached the revelation of Seven Seals and marriage and divorce anointed ones of the end times trying to do God of service without doing his will we could go on and on and on I did all that you told me to do praise God and this is she this is the bride Hallelujah and here's your husband praise God hallelujah thank God and Isaac brought her into her mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife so they consummated the marriage and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death isn't that beautiful Isaac loved his his new wife now look and they didn't even know each other five minutes before they had the wedding or maybe five maybe five minutes maybe an hour I don't know but they barely knew but they knew God was in this and all the trials as you can read on all the trials God brought him through all the other tests all their trials but what was that Isaac loved her and church that's what matters in this story Jesus loves us we know all of our love sometimes is failing it's inconsistent sometimes we fall short but the Bible records that Isaac loved her oh and the bar records that Jesus loves you praise God Jesus Loves Me Hallelujah he's Jesus is the one the Father Abraham father God is the one who sent the servant God sent brother Branham to get us a Hallelujah God said the word of God through Brotherhood so that we believe it and we be drawn to Jesus Christ like I asked that brother like I told you we had a brother recently a preacher leave the message but before he left I said brother what other group on Earth do you know that is qualified to take a Rapture they live the right life they believe all the word of God I said is there another group that could be make the Rapture outside of the message people he said no I said well that's good enough for me then he's like well I still think brother Brown was a certain certain thing I said that's fine you can believe whatever you want but you witnessed to it even though you witnessed to it you've left it but I'm staying with it because it's the Bible word of God hallelujah the truth of the Bible see what Satan's done he's trying to get everybody's eyes off of Jesus he's trying to get all their eyes off the Bible and get it on brother Branham Well church what if everybody stared at you and examined your life over the last 20 years and heard all your goods but all your bads too how many people do you think would want to follow you yeah I think I think we'd be disappointed with ourselves wouldn't we especially when his brother didn't have the Revelation on these things until the last three years of his life on some of these topics like the Seven Seals you know and the godhead and all these things that are so they're obvious to us now because it's been all these years the Holy Spirit just made it plain more as time goes on we just get more and more truth hallelujah but we got to be like we got to be like Rebecca thank God for Ellie easier he's not perfect but he was God's servant hallelujah amen and Eliezer told me about Isaac amen and Eleazar brought me to Christ amen is that right for the amen hallelujah is that right amen is that right brother Austin no other services have we been a part of where we felt the prince of Jesus Christ except in this message Hallelujah that is my honest and goodness testimony I was raised in church we went to Revival Services every year uh Monday through Sunday it was a whole week long but I never felt the prince of Jesus Christ like I did when I come to this revelation of God's word amen and I can it continues to be that way praise God it continues to be that way Hallelujah like William and I two years ago I went to all those churches and where are some good churches right Jose's family goes to one of those churches there's some good services but it wasn't the sweetness and the Holiness and the sincerity and the truth like we enjoy under this word of God that's exactly right praise God sorry I'm spitting forgive me guys I need to take out the row again or something like that but that's not that's God to honest truth now the reason I wanted to preach this yesterday last night to the Columbus people I was reading that book and I just I came over this story so let me read this story brother random is uh preaching in a shame 1965. he just got back brother uh from the Africa trip it was a disappointment to him he thought he's gonna be able to preach but the government would not allow it because they thought it would raise up communism all those people being gathered together you know the story but he's having this mind battle uh afterwards and he kept having dreams of he was a disappointment to his public utility job and then he had a dream he was a disappointment to God and he asked God for a dream and vision and he said I thought I wonder why God would bring me to the desert where there's nothing but scorpions and Gila monsters he said so I prayed for a vision and Mita just got me a Bible he says I went out and got the Bible said Lord in the days gone by you had a yerman thumb them he says but Lord it used to be when a dreamer Dreamed a Dream they took down the urum and told it and the urum them and flashed the lights back a supreme I'm sorry Supernatural light the dream was true I said but that priesthood and the eurom thumb is done away with that's a good quote for The Minister's marriage requirements I never thought about that um your Bible brother says your Bible is a eurom thumb now Lord may I never do this again but I've asked you and prayed to you to give me a vision speak to me about why I'm Dreaming these dreams what have I done if I've harmed if I've done anything to any person in the world let me know I'll go make it right what a prayer when you're having mind valves you're having bad dreams brother or your tormented sister by awful dreams go to God In Prayer say Lord I've done anything wrong I don't care who it is I'll go apologize that's a sincere heart right there praise God right in other words you don't want to have secrets in your life you want your whole life cleaned out I love that prayer he said Lord your urine and thumb is now the Bible and we're all we're all priests unto God are we not see each one of us should Envision ourselves walking around like this all the time and we if we have questions in our life we should be able to stop and say Lord you're you're the Bible All My Heart Lord please show me is this right or wrong and Church in that moment we can wait for the light to flash remember there's 12 Stones and if light flashed on the stones that was thus saith the Lord that's right and so we should do that in our lives Lord I want to examine My Life by the word of God lord is this right for me to do should I do this and then see if the light flashes see if God says this is right or see if this is wrong and then obey what the Bible says how many like to do that by God's grace brother Brown did that at 56 years old amen he was still doing that at 56. Hallelujah what a blessing see this is uh this was this is a model servant that's why I use that title the model servant when I when we have mind battles when we have struggles when we go through difficult times in life let's go to the Bible for our answers praise God not the Facebook like the Amish they just got on Facebook and I said that's okay you would just watch that now that can become a trap right not go to YouTube or run more not go to that for answers go to the Bible for answers no I'm not saying I'm not saying God can't use a sermon on rumble or YouTube that's fine but I'm just saying like we got to make sure we go to God In Prayer Hallelujah and then Brothers said surely there's something in this word from Genesis Revelation some character in there that you dealt with would be the same basis that would be my question in other words why am I out here why am I out here in the wilderness there's another quote late earlier where brother man said I feel like you haven't moved me for five years so that was the church ages it was when in 1960 was five years before this this was 1965. church have you ever you ever felt like it's been five years since God moved on my life has anybody ever thought that before so this is what he's going through wow five years I don't feel like I've really gotten any and look he'd preached the Seven Seals in the midst he'd already preached marriage in divorce but we all go through my battles church that's why I love this story amen someone who has so much Supernatural someone who uh who's human I mean he has so many testimonies but yet he's human and he goes through trials but he shows us the model way to solve any problem pray ask God for dreams ask God's provisions and then and everything go back to the word of God hallelujah and everything go back to the word of the word he says where I where I've done something wrong something you want me to do let me see some character in The Bible like that he said I just opened my eyes and I said I let the Bible fall open so I'm gonna try to do it here I gotta look though I'm trying to get to Genesis 24. somehow brother's Bible anyways it fell open like that and he said I closed my eyes and put my finger on the scripture and it was Genesis 24 verse 7. LA easer Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible ah being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac chills run over me I think chill's about ready to run over me too amen thank God Amen Hallelujah there's one time I did that in my life when I when I I didn't know if I should be the pastor of this church or not I remember I was upstairs Lydia might have been in the bathroom they might have had their towels they got done with the bath I was reading my Bible there I said Lord should I take this church or not should I be a pastor you know Tim Myers moved away should we have a church I just said I opened up the Bible I didn't put my finger I just opened the Bible and you probably remember this and it went to is it first Timothy four or second Timothy 4. First Timothy 4 First Timothy 4. First Timothy 4 12. I just closed my eyes I said Lord should I take this open up the Bible and it says let no man despise your youth I was a 25 year old preacher I've only been preaching two years be thou an example of the Believers in word and conversation and charity in spirit and faith and purity and didn't we read earlier in Hebrews 13 the preachers must be the examples so when that happened at Austin I knew I was called the pastor and now we now we got the we got the benefit of hindsight's 2020. we just passed our 17th year anniversary has brother Jesse been the example for 17 years I believe I have by God's grace a model servant I mean I'm trying to by God's grace I'm not perfect but I want to be as close to the Bible as I can amen so I know what brother Rand went through because I had to go through the same thing and I haven't done it since I'm not telling you every night oh God should I buy this or should I do that should I do where should I wear tomorrow wear something holy praise God that's what you should wear I'm talking in a moment of desperation I said God should I be that and my eyes directly and I already highlighted that First Corinthians 4 12 and I said that's exactly right and that's what I desire to be and I've had numerous people come in pray even guest preachers and say brother Jesse has an excellent spirit and uh and then recently like I told you people come from all over and say there's the real love of God here now brother Brown said he said give me a choice of either all the gifts or love he said and I'll take the love of God because the love will produce the gifts praise God so that's just from my experience that's how my life relates to that and chills run over me when I when I saw that first Timothy 4 12. chills run over me said he said that's the rest that's right in line with the rest of my message pulling out the bride he said just a perfect message back to the word he said go get that bride that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride so God spoke to brother Branham Through the Bible in his moment of desperation in this moment of feeling lonely in this moment of feeling I haven't done nothing for five years God spoke Through the Bible and brother random said oh I can identify I'm getting a bride ready for Jesus Christ and you and I are that bride hallelujah amen I believe it I know it with all my heart I'm that bride hallelujah amen I'm Rebecca praise God I want to see Jesus amen hallelujah I want to go meet Embrace God and I know all the other preachers brother Austin I've been around to say wow now all these other preachers are not leading us really to Christ a lot of them are leading us to money and prosperity other ones are leading people to lust of the Flesh and pride of life right they're leading them the wrong way but this message leads us to Jesus Christ at home in my office I got that sign I got it from Brother cam we don't change the message the message changes us the message changed me to a dancing pastor before I was real stiff and starchy but nah the message if the Bible says it I believe it that settles it praise God and now when it's a season of Dance I can dance and praise God hallelujah if it's a seasonal mourning we can mourn and weep and cry for losses in the family or losses we can mourn over things but when it's time to Rejoice Let's Dance a child has graduated amen glory amen the faith and the faithful servant praise God you can recognize times of dance and Times of mourning the message changes us the message is changing me I trust the message is changing you Hallelujah now later in the same sermon brother Ram says these thoughts I want to just briefly go over these real quick here brother Brown said any spirit that would tell you you're saved and give you a glorious feeling that would shout and scream and then that Spirit denies the word of God how can that be the Holy Spirit so now we're talking about Pentecostals or anyone who has emotion but they deny the word of God not us because we shouldn't be deniers we should be obeyers obeyers of the word that the spirit of God must punctuate every promise of God with an amen if it isn't then you haven't met God you met a deceiving Spirit and the world's full of it today and then he goes to say how can a spirit be on a man the holy spirit that wrote this Bible then turn around and deny and say that's not right that was for some other day right Hallelujah so I want to just say brother Brown found his answer to his question in the Bible he found it by pointing to the scripture and we can do the same when we have questions in our lives or troubles in our lives we've got to point to the verse that's going to give us the victory as we've been showing with Abraham amen Abraham believe God Abraham called it not as though it was praise God he called it as though it was and Eleazar only pointed Rebecca to Isaac and Abraham that's all he talks about I got to get you back for Isaac I got to get you ready for Isaac I got to get you ready for Abraham I got to keep my promise to Abraham praise God he was there he was only pointing to the father and son that's all we do is point to God Almighty Hallelujah he didn't point to himself brother Brandon said his seven sealed sermons I preach this on Thursday at the Amish Junction City people program said those Seven Seals he says if I ever preach anything in a sermon inspired it was the tapes of the Seven Seals he says if you ever heard anything that's really as I can say it's thus saith the Lord get those so if you want to hear from God and you haven't listened to brother Brown lately play The Seven Seals Hallelujah or I like I also I like the questions and answers 64. those are some powerful I listened to those a couple months ago yesterday I was listening to souls that are in prison oh and ashamed ashamed 1965. now even when brother man was preaching the greatest sermons he ever was a part of the seventh seal he said I am hoping and trusting you people realize I'm trying to put this grace on Jesus Christ who's the author of all of it and the own yeah the author of of all of it he says always bear in mind you be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ imagine you are a gem in Jesus's crown Hallelujah you're one of those shiny gems we want to be gems in the crown of Jesus Christ we don't never want to put a man in you forget anything about me I'm your brother I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth I ain't saying that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but by the grace of God God has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of time and see those things Beyond Yonder amen hallelujah I love the humility of Eleazar I love the humility of brother Brown did you ever hear this story brother and told about the cult who was on the Jewish farm did anybody anyone remember that story okay bear with me let me tell this story you'll like to start but I said I remember her little story it's a fiction story so it's a made-up story under the law the Jews uh one of the Jews had an old mother horse who had a little cult and he was a mule you know his ears broke down his knees knocked so can you imagine a knee knocking mule just walking out there little mule ears hung down not very handsome yet he says and oh a cross-eyed horrible looking mule so can I do a cross side there look at this it just looks like a Misfit animal said well if that mule could look at himself and say oh my when the master comes out he'll kill me he wouldn't feed me I'm not worthy so look at me what a horrible looking mess I am but if the mother could speak the mother horse he would say to the little fellow she'd say wait a minute honey you can live because you're my first and you have a Birthright now when the master comes out and sees you and you're all in your condition he has to go and get a lamb without a blemish on it and kill it so that the crippled up looking mule could live but I said you see the priest never seen the mule he saw the lamb it wasn't whether the mule was perfect it had to be a perfect lamb so the mule said I'm not worthy to live I I'm not worthy I'm nothing my life's a messed up I'm a misfit look at me I got I got cross-eyed eyes I walk with my knees knocking I'm not fit to be anything but the mother says this Jewish man he sacrifices Lambs not mules and brothers said oh I hope you can see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not it's whether he was good enough if God accepted Jesus and Jesus blood makes an atonement God doesn't see you he sees the little lamb praise God he said then that little mule could stick his tail up in the air and snort and run and jump over the field having a good time can you picture that meal having a good time I don't have to die something's died for me Hallelujah Glory he said he's going to live He's not going to die he says but one perfect one had to die for the imperfect one he said that was me William Branham no good not fit to live worthy to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner no good at all not one sound part about me that's right but one day I accepted Jesus God when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one then as long as I'm in him then I'm perfected not in myself not my perfection I don't have any you don't have any but it's his perfection oh you like that story amen I love that but that makes himself like a a cross-eyed knock-kneed uh little horse little cult but we're saved by the lamb the lamb without blemish and so then you can jump around the Barnyard with your tail flopping all around I'm saved I'm saved by the grace of God I'm saved by that Hallelujah that's our program looked at himself not like I'm some great person now this is what I read last night brother man said man can't heal you he can only point you to Christ he said again I only Point people to Jesus Christ I do not claim to be a Healer I cannot hear heal anyone we only point you to the person that's already healed you the church has no salvation it can only point you to Jesus Christ who is the only salvation these are all quotes I'm just going like fast like a machine gun or ar Bill Graham said he's praised for the people may they look away from me this Mortal clay of a servant may they look to him whose omniscient not the messenger but the message Granite Lord that's where we point we point to Jesus Christ the son of God grant that Jesus will be so real to everyone here today even to the little children where's the little children out there we want Jesus Christ to be so real to all of you even you Jed you're next to be baptized one of these days Hallelujah may he be so real even the little children that he'll become the absolute of the entire congregation we ask in Jesus name amen now I've shared that with Jefferson Bill voice of God numerous times and they just don't even respond if brother Graham said Jesus Christ is his absolute that's good enough for me praise God like this guy he's a real nice guy from Australia real nice guy he probably listened to me God bless the brother but you know he has he said that Evangelical told him if I understand this right he said the Evangelical said well Bible's my absolute so he said well the the Bible interpreted by Brother Branham is my absolute and I thought well I haven't responded yet but I thought to me if brother Branham if it was okay for brother Brown to say the Bible's my absolute it's okay for me to say that right to me I just don't like to bring anything in you know like a man because Jesus Christ is my absolute and now if you like that Evangelical could look at our lives and say well your absolute's producing something different than my absolute especially when you look at the women right look how holy our women dress oh let's say he's Baptist well the Baptist look at your wife she's all sexy dressed look at my wife oh the Bible is both of our absolutes well it's obvious to tell we have different absolutes because your wife is dressed like a prostitute mine dressed like a holy ghost-filled Saint a daughter of God right not to be mean or anything but that's the reality of it strip off clothes so men can lust after them they can feel prettier when it's not even real pretty it's sin so I appreciate that brother and maybe he's listening but to me I just like to brother said Jesus Christ in my absolute and I like to say that too yeah and yeah then I'll bring in yes God sent a prophet to show us the absolute right and brothers said if you have the Holy Spirit it can only point you to the word of God it'll never point to denomination never point to a Creed it'll never point it anywhere somewhere It'll point straight to the word then he says again if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can only point you to Christ what was Eliezer doing pointing to Isaac point to Abraham pointing there that's what we do we point to God we point to a son Jesus Christ brother Brandon said the Bible is your North Star in other words it directs you it's your compass you look to the you look to the North Star okay that way I'm going north now I can go the right direction and so when we're in trouble and we're lost in the cares of the world we're lost in Trials where do we got to look to we got to look to the North Star we got to look to Jesus brother Brown said it's the way out of all troubles it's the way to peace it's the way to success it's the way to eternal life itself is follow the North Star Jesus Christ and Jesus is the word hallelujah oh thank God Amen the way out of any trouble is the word but Ram's troubled why am I nothing going on for five years why am I here with gila monsters why not why am I out here with scorpions Lord show me the answer right there the Bible has the answers the Bible has your answers but the answer to the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word not some ecumenical move but to the word of God but brother said every other man's word will fail but God's word can't fail said I'm a man he said my words can fail but God's words can't fail because it's God now let's balance it out every time brother Adam said thus say the Lord those words can't fail but when he's just talking like his regular self those words could fail that's why we look for thus saith the Lord that's why I did that study back in 2016. I think it was over 1200 quotes I went through 1200 click click you gotta read it click click click my eyes were crossed by about that time I was just like that cult but hopefully I found them all right I love this quote brother said it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible ah why don't we say with the tape say everybody are we saying what the tape say hallelujah remember acts 17 11 the bereans heard the prophet Paul preached and they searched the Scriptures Daily to make sure he was telling the truth and the Bible called them Noble if you want to rule in the Millennium you got to search the Bible every day if you want to be Noble if you want to be royal family you got to search the Bible every day and make sure what brother Jesse's saying make sure my brother brother Brandon brother Brooks whoever any brother make sure what we're saying is the word of God and if you do that you you show you're of the royal family you're of the royal seed and someday you'll rule in the millennium that's why I told the Saints last night some of them looked at me like time to read your Bible it's time to make sure but I'm gonna say every day in the morning right away with the kids we read our Bible and pray every day that's what you need to do we all need to do that search the Scriptures Daily have a time every day you study the Bible that's what the Bible says is Noble brother Adam said quote God is the absolute and then brother Adam said quote but God's absolute is his word so he's the absolute and his words the absolute so we have two absolutes really we have two forms two forms two manifestations of the absolute we have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost word that he wrote well there's only one absolute but we have two forms of it and the church said brother man said both God's the absolute is where is the absolute well the Ramsey that said the absolute is a person and there's only one absolute there's no other absolute and the absolute is always Jesus Christ there is no room for tapes being the absolute there's only because there's no other there's only one absolute and that's Jesus Christ thank God for the tapes like I told you thank God for the camels amen thank God for Elise or praise God thank God for every one of them but they are not Isaac Hallelujah there's only one Isaac and that's our husband praise God look at Jesus amen that's who that's who we're falling in love with right there praise God and yes you know the stories Elisa tells like that song all the stories alligator tells they thrilled our hearts amen they're getting us ready to see Jesus but when we see Jesus that's who we're going to go in the tent with that's who are going in the Rapture with is Jesus Christ Our Lord oh thank God Amen Hallelujah brother says if if your absolute is in some organization or something else besides the person of Jesus Christ you'll come to some portion of Shame in other words this Bible has to be your final say and no other books outside this Bible because this is what God has Vindicated down Through the Ages this is the absolute this is the final say this is the Unlimited in power amen that's what the word absolute means God bless brother Kyle good to see you buddy Hallelujah good to see you my friend Hallelujah so we got one absolute there can be no other absolute you can't say well my church is my absolute my Creed is my absolute no if Jesus Christ is your absolute you believe God's word glory amen that's right now let me try to find a place to close now real quickly the Bible says in second Peter 3 18 grow in Grace and knowledge of our Lord and savior they asked brother Ram how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God read the word and pray I want to become a better Christian what should I do brother just said I spend more money no should spend more time with God read your Bible and pray right spent and it can be spend time at the we found a good Park I might go study the Bible there and prayers but be out in nature but really all you need is a Bible and an honest heart to pray that's all you need is a Bible and honest heart to draw closer to God he also told us he said don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world stay out of their modern theologies just look to the Lamb of God read your Bible and pray all the time don't be weary be rejoicing happy now we all get weird I'm not I'm not condemning people I get weary too I'm pretty tired actually today but you can't tell by God's grace hopefully hopefully can't tell so I preached five times in the last seven days I've been traveling I've traveled about 500 Miles preaching that's good that's what I want to do but I'm just tired he said but don't worry be happy for the Redemption of the church is drawing not your time to meet Isaac is almost here hallelujah Rebecca it's almost time to meet Isaac Hallelujah it's almost time for the church to meet Jesus Christ oh it's a beautiful type and we shall see him who died for us when I see a man what are you gonna do amen when you see the one who died for you Lord let me just let me look at those hands let me let me let me kiss those feet for about five 500 years or something like that you bled and die for me you're the reason I'm here all I do is spend my life traveling on my journey we're just hearing about you and now I get to see you and the half has not been told Hallelujah there's so much more and easier's not Eternal you're Eternal praise God amen hallelujah ah thank God I have to skip ahead a little bit here now in Genesis 24 30 pardon me the Bible says it came to pass when he saw Laban saw the earring and the bracelets upon his sister's hands I'm sorry that was a Laban that was laban's son and when he heard the words of Rebecca's sister saying thus fake the man to me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well so I just want you to show after Allah azer gave the jewels to Rebecca she put them on what would you say if you you engage yourself to a woman and she said yes but then she didn't put on the engagement ring like Hey where's that ring uh where is it spent some money on that you know and and so brother Adam says this he says the church is now he said look she's got it she got it she got it on she's got the necklace the bracelets that's it was all Isaacs she's like look honey look I'm Yours I got your gifts on I've been true to you I've kept your promises I've kept your I've kept the vow to you I've stayed pure to you brother man said now the church the bride of Christ is engaged to Jesus for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he's bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good well that's what Christ is doing to the the church he's sending us the gifts of the holy spirit now we know what these what are these jewels and what are these uh jewelry what does this all represent it represents Supernatural moves of the Holy Ghost through the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit let's see if I can name them all Word of Wisdom word of knowledge uh Faith Miracles discernment tongues interpretation healings I think that's all nine right did I miss one prophecy yeah you got it Hallelujah see you guys help me out you're my second third brains there's all night so all those gifts of the holy spirit are Jesus love tokens you're my wife and church he wants us to wear them Amen in other words he wants us to believe for miracles Hallelujah he wants us to believe her Divine Healing he wants us to believe for Faith and discernment praise God and words of wisdom and tongues and interpretation and prophecy he wants us to put it on church I say let's put him on praise God let's cover this season Hallelujah of our lives and let's put on all these Jewels let's make sure we believe let's make sure we're ready to meet Isaac amen Hallelujah brother man said if I was engaged to a girl and I'd send her something and she wouldn't wear it that show she doesn't believe me she don't she doesn't want to be my bride I'm glad my wife still wears her wedding ring after 20 years I've loved her best I could my God she's loved me way more she's such a servant God if Christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refuse him and say they're not so they don't want to be the bride of Christ he says they're espoused as some other lover and not Christ the bridegroom so the real Church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that God sends to them hallelujah how many will accept all the gifts God sends to you now remember church do you have a gift though you got to pray for that gift you got to say God help me to yield to this gift like brother amen as a music music is healing right every time somebody one you want healing got to put on the right music so he's got to say Lord Jesus guide me with these music with his songs so I can be a blessing so I can bring joy to the people healing to the people repentance right sometimes a song can just bring you right to repentance absolutely and each one of our gifts we have to say Lord help me to take this gift and use it for your glory help me to put it on Amen well Ram said when remember this when I'm gone Jesus will still be here brother has been dead for 57 years but Jesus is still alive amen Hallelujah but Ram said Divine Healing doesn't lay within me every one of these men has got the same Authority that I or anyone else has got to pray for the sick and that's all we can do is pray for the sick Hallelujah well the ram said that good listen that good Holy Ghost Field brother sister that lives next door to you has the same authority to pray for you when you're sick it don't matter it don't matter who prays for you as long as they have faith it don't have to be me although I would be loved love to pray for you but if you can't get to me get to somebody who's got faith amen because you know that person will leave your presence but Jesus never leaves our presence the spirit's so great it just hovers around all the Believers said I'm not the only one to pray for the sick your pastor is just as much ordained to pray for the sick as I or any other man in the earth what a statement the lady even can pray for each other so healing doesn't lay in the man it lays in Calvary any true gift of God will testify the same thing praise God the life in other words the Resurrection Life that flowed out of Calvary three days later that's the power that's where the healing lays in the Resurrection the life of Jesus Christ amen amen almost preached hour and a half here I didn't know I was going to preach Islam no remember that's brother Brandon can women operate all the gifts he says yes as long as it comes in the place of the order he said women are gifted with prophecy tongues interpretations everything but being preachers they're not to be preachers he says but as far as gifts the woman has all those can occupy one or any of those nine gifts according to First Corinthians 12 and is under no bondage that her message should not come forth in this place so sisters you're not in bondage here you're free here and let me say the same thing the brothers are free here too praise God even if you're not a preacher you're free here praise God just gotta wait for your time just gotta wait for your place Hallelujah all right I think I might be coming down here by the grace of God so in closing here by God's grace we can see that God has sent brother Brandon who died in 1965 he sent him to give us a word to prepare us a word straight from the Bible not outside the Bible straight to the Bible any true servant of God will only point you to the word of God and I believe this has all the answers even if it's not the answers we want it's got all the answers we just got to say Lord change my heart so I can accept your answers and some and search sometimes the answer is you'll find out when you get to heaven sometimes that's the answer and that should be good enough for us because of all that father God has done for us that should be good enough he's taking care of us so much in our natural lives and our spiritual lives he's done so much through the cross through the Holy Ghost all the truth that he's given to us he's done so much he's worthy to be trusted your heavenly father is worthy to be trusted and church let's see I just you know want to let me say this here you know God has given us such grace through brother Bam's Ministry he's you know he's pointing us to the Bible where we can dress holy where we don't we don't cause people to lust after our bodies by wearing sexy clothes right so he's kept he taught us that lust spirits come off us when we believe God's word we're not seeking a uh we're not seeking fleshly evidences we're not we're not seeking tongues to know we're born again we know we're born again when people can see and hear our life has changed like it they could see it here on the day of Pentecost praise God through not giving a lie we're not believing Lies We have a lying Spirit on us why I've spoke in tongues one time or I shouted one time I know I got the Holy Ghost you got it because something happened and then everybody can see the fruits of it afterwards right we don't let women preachers come preach the pulpit because there's nothing in the Bible about women preachers right there's we don't let people divorce and remarry and divorce and remarry married two or three or four times that's adultery it stains the church right we keep our our hair lengths the right way the Bible said men should have short hair and women should have long uncut hair that's what the Bible says if not it's a shame it brings shame upon the man or shame upon the woman and shame upon God because the Bible says so not adding one thing to the word of God Hallelujah in church we keep out the idols that many people have in their lives even the idol of Eliezer no one gets our praise and worship no one gets our adoration no one gets our honor except Jesus Christ for worship yes we are the Bible said honor one another shake hands love you pray for you but all Divine honor goes to Jesus Christ Alone so this bible message from Brother Graham has pointed us back to the word of God and it's given us an awareness of the gifts in our lives the jewelry the bracelets spiritually speaking but spiritually we see the suit the blessings of God in our lives we see the faith that God's placed in our lives let me just share this last story you know this week I talked to uh a saint and and we just had something from the past to deal with that doesn't go to this church and they just said you know they said brother Jesse you know numerous times over these five or six years people have talked talked to me about you and they've said brother Jesse you know they just they said you're a good guy but you preach so hard over the pulpit they said you you preach so hard and and your standard is so high that it drives people away and it divides the body of Christ I've I felt the holy righteous in the nation of God Arise enough to me but I I held it back and they said they they they they just share numerous things and they said you know you need to be more loving and you need to you need to take your standards down because the main thing is love and I just said well brother we'll just agree to disagree yeah brother that's right let's say Amen can we that's right brother Hallelujah and you caught you caught it because what he's trying to say is you got to compromise on the word of God and that's love and that is not love that's from hell like our brother said to compromise on God's word and what he was talking about was parenting and preaching and I said I thought my heart I said Lord I'd rather take the way with God's despised View than to dwell in a church that if you look at their church we visit the church a number of years ago our family did and my girls left out of there saying we don't like this church because they wore such sexy clothes preaching a lot of what we preach they preach the same baptism same godhead right girls is that right girls right remember that in case you remember that you don't remember that okay lady did you remember that and so just this week I've been reminded and it was just God just laid it right in order while I was driving to some of these preaching events I was reminded we never let down the standard that God has given to us because the standard of the Bible we've been taught is guiding us to his standards Jesus did and Jesus standards are the word of God and church that family and their Church they watch full football games on TV full basket they watch all the NBA Finals what a complete waste of time that's like bowing down at an idol of a basketball I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna I'm Gonna Worship that's what they do worship for three hours until the game's over and that whole time how much could they even learn about God or praying or witnessing or listen to a sermon or just how about cleaning their house yes sir that's right amen it is yes sir that Roman Spirit back because Spirits never die here's another day that's right yes the final say let's say pricing off Joey praise the Lord amen but I was reminded this week we got to point to one thing the word of God and brother man taught us when you break the standards he said it's like letting down the it's like opening the gates and then all the wolves get in and destroy your sheep if I said oh it's okay for your sisters to wear more sexy clothes it's okay for you men to go out uh to the bars and it's okay to go out uh to the clubs with the sports it's like letting demons like wolves and then they'll destroy your spiritual life they will suffocate or they'll they'll they'll bite your spiritual life and they'll wait till your spiritual life is dead and you'll feel a million miles from God why because you let the goats I'm sorry you let the wolves in now goats would work too but wolves are way more dangerous so I was reminded this week let's stay with the word of God let's stay pointing out God's word let's not let down the standard and I kind of smiled I said I'm glad people say that about me I'd rather have them say brother Jesse's a legalist than a worldly preacher I'm going to be one of the other right I'm either going to be popular or rejected while Marty rejected Hallelujah so I might as well somebody that keeps the standard so high and church I don't know about you if I don't feel division in our church I feel unity in our church I'm thankful for the unity of the Holy Spirit let's stand to our feet musicians can come here praise God let's play that where one in the spirit we're one in the Lord and I pray that the spirit of unity will someday be restored it is in God's people praise God Hallelujah let's bow our heads here for a moment [Music] father God we thank you Lord God for this story of foreshadowing [Music] all down through the Bible [Music] John Wesley foreign [Music] thankful Lord that I can leave the things of the World Behind to leave friends family Associates opportunities maybe a more secure future I can leave that behind and I could follow at least [Music] and really Lord in this in the real life you're already here Lord God we're going to meet your physical body one day but your spirit is already here thank God hallelujah thank God for the holy spirit it's keeping our lives clean thank you keeping our lives Pure or may we always uphold the standard of this is right this is wrong and yes of course we'll show Mercy because we all fall short we'll be patient we'll pray for one another and one another Lord as we struggle or as we go through tough trials Lord God but we'll encourage each other and point each other to the word of God thank you Lord that you said fear not little flock it's my father's Good Will to give you the kingdom thank you God thank you God no small number Lord I believe we have the quality of the Holy Ghost that's your desire help us Lord to put all these bracelets spiritually speaking to put on your gifts of the Holy Spirit for your glory Lord God bless your people and I pray this message Lord will continue to bless those down in Columbus and The Junction City Saints as we preached there last night let your Holy Spirit anoint them minister to them guide them Lord God bless our father's day we pray be with our fathers and our faithful we thank you for those faithful fathers strength and continue to be faithful for those fathers that have not been faithful Lord we pray that they'll come to repentance they'll learn to love you they'll learn to point to the word of God as their absolute Lord for those fathers that are passed on Lord we pray for ourselves and comfort our hearts how we miss them and bring them back foreign [Music] by your grace [Music] thank you God for being our heavenly father give you the glory today in Jesus Christ
