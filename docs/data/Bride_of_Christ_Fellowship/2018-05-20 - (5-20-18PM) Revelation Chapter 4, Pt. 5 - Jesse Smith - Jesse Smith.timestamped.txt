[13:54] God's grace good to see brother bang and
[13:56] sister see ya there Lily hi Lily
[13:58] god bless you you're looking all nice
[14:02] and combed lookin fresh mice had a good
[14:04] nap revelation 4 I want to just pull out
[14:12] a few thoughts I had you know in
[14:14] preparation yesterday I'll be honest I
[14:16] didn't have as much time to study on
[14:17] this as I like to I may devote more time
[14:20] to it but I just want to bring out a few
[14:22] thoughts that the Lord I felt the Lord
[14:24] placed upon my heart here I hope they'll
[14:26] be a blessing to you by the grace of the
[14:29] Lord let's go to verse 4 what is we
[14:36] revelation 4 verse 4 I'll read that for
[14:42] us I'll just read it myself
[14:43] verse 4 and round about the throne were
[14:45] four and 20 seats and upon the seats I
[14:47] saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed
[14:50] in white raiment and they had on their
[14:52] heads crowns of gold
[14:54] amen may God has best seen as reading
[14:56] his word you may be seated here by God's
[14:58] grace you know last week I thought oh I
[15:03] got so much energy I can preach to
[15:04] services then I feel all worn out you
[15:06] know from this week of work so I give as
[15:09] much as I can tonight by the grace Laura
[15:11] I was hoping to preach about 45 minutes
[15:12] so I know Lydia is gonna say wow you up
[15:15] daddy he only preached 45 minutes so
[15:17] last time she was surprised can he do
[15:21] that
[15:21] of course and I wanted to I'm gonna put
[15:26] a little picture I want to put a few
[15:27] visuals up here if I can so I switch
[15:32] over here okay when you're ready I just
[15:36] want to review a few things here like I
[15:38] said I'm just trying to focus on the 12
[15:39] tribes so it's the par 5 and I like to
[15:42] focus on the lives of the elders just as
[15:45] much as the scripture can give us you
[15:47] know there's not a whole lot about
[15:48] details about the lives of the 12 sons
[15:51] as as I search in the Bible dictionaries
[15:54] to try to get more information on their
[15:57] lives but I just want to look at their
[15:59] lives and as a as an example of the
[16:03] grace of God how many love the grace of
[16:05] God
[16:06] oh my after this morning you know even
[16:09] after this morning as we see how just a
[16:12] few hours before Jesus was crucified his
[16:14] disciples are arguing about who's
[16:15] greater think of the grace of Christ you
[16:18] know to extend mercy to us and then he
[16:21] you know fills him with the Holy Ghost
[16:22] and he makes them these twelve outers
[16:24] that sit right next to the his own
[16:26] throne what a what a merciful God we
[16:29] serve you know we're very elated about
[16:32] the grace of God for us so so I just
[16:36] want to only use this for a little bit I
[16:38] want to show this again I showed this
[16:40] before then I'm gonna jump to the the
[16:42] tribes that look like this I spend most
[16:44] of my time on this yesterday with this
[16:45] thought but I'll come back to that the
[16:49] different how the tribes change I'm
[16:52] gonna go through that a little bit
[16:52] tonight by God's grace but let's first
[16:56] look at these lives of the the 12 sons
[16:59] but you know of course Jacob you know
[17:02] I'm sorry Joseph had two sons ephraim
[17:05] and manasseh that took part in the
[17:10] twelve tribes and we'll go through that
[17:12] - we'll go through all all of them by
[17:14] God's grace oh really
[17:15] I'm looking at 14 tonight we're looking
[17:18] at 14 cos Levi comes out Joseph comes
[17:20] out for a while
[17:21] dan and then I'm sorry Ephraim and
[17:23] Manasseh come in and then Dan Ephraim go
[17:25] out and so you have this this
[17:28] interesting addition and subtraction of
[17:31] the tribes so it's quite a thought and
[17:34] like I said I haven't had as much time
[17:35] to devote to it as I like to but from
[17:37] what I would have gained the last week
[17:39] or two out I do want to preach that so
[17:41] let's look at the first one let's look
[17:42] at Reuben and Reuben is surprisingly one
[17:45] of the sons that we have the most
[17:46] information about of course Joseph would
[17:48] be the most but we have quite a bit
[17:52] about rubra now Reuben means behold a
[17:55] son he was the oldest son of Jacob and
[17:57] Leah as we looked at last Sunday now
[18:00] let's go to Genesis 35 let's just take
[18:01] our Bibles and yeah let's do a little
[18:03] bit of just a little bit of Bible study
[18:04] here Genesis 35 22 and I'm
[18:15] last week but I didn't really you know
[18:17] touch on it as much I just kind of want
[18:18] to emphasize it here and I hope this
[18:22] encourage you you know I know David
[18:24] could relate you know to Reuben because
[18:26] here Reuben makes a really awful sexual
[18:28] mistake and yet later church this is the
[18:31] grace of God this is the whole point of
[18:33] this message later he's given a crowd in
[18:35] a robe and he's right next to the throne
[18:37] of Jesus Christ himself
[18:39] now church is at mercy or what that is
[18:42] tremendous mercy that shows you the
[18:44] power of the blood of Jesus Christ
[18:45] so Genesis 35 22 malachi can you read
[18:48] that for me you got it now of course you
[19:00] know Jacob was awful upset about this
[19:02] will we're not gonna I don't have much
[19:04] time to look at that but this also
[19:08] reminds us you know he laid with
[19:09] basically his brother's mother right a
[19:12] half-brother laid with a woman that also
[19:17] his father laid with now this kind of
[19:20] reminds us of that remember that man in
[19:21] Corinthian the Church of Corinth who had
[19:23] up with his father's wife or stepmother
[19:26] kind of reminds us of that situation and
[19:29] so you know when someone makes a sexual
[19:31] mistake we just can't necessarily say
[19:33] they're going to hell we can say that
[19:35] because in both cases they knew better
[19:37] Rubin would have known better you know
[19:39] he was of the lineage of Abraham you
[19:41] know he would have known better and of
[19:43] course the Corinthian believer would
[19:45] have as well he came out of the church
[19:46] that Paul started and there's no way
[19:49] Paul would have started the church and
[19:50] then not left them the Word of God to
[19:52] know how to behave sexually so he would
[19:55] have known better but Paul said we kick
[19:58] him out but admonish him as a brother
[20:00] let him know he's still brother if he
[20:02] repents so Reuben is guilty of this
[20:07] awful sexual sin and you know his father
[20:12] Jacob even remembers it when he
[20:14] pronounces the the kind of the
[20:17] prophesies of their lives let's go to
[20:19] Genesis 48 verse 448 actually 48 for
[20:23] yeah so this thing was always remembered
[20:28] by
[20:28] father and that's what proverbs says
[20:30] I've been looking at proverbs again and
[20:32] the Bible says those sexual sins like
[20:35] adultery and some of those awful sins
[20:37] they impact everybody and they're hard
[20:39] to get over there they're so they're so
[20:42] hurtful so 48 verse 4 Lydia can you read
[20:49] that for me yeah 48 4 all right I think
[21:11] that's the Joseph yeah I'm sorry the
[21:13] Joseph in verse 3 it says that I'm sorry
[21:15] I must have the wrong one Oh 49 okay
[21:19] thank you yeah I do have that one too I
[21:20] have both of those that's strange yeah
[21:23] 49 3 & 4 yeah Lydia you read 3 & 4 in
[21:27] chapter 49 all right now so see his the
[21:49] father still remembers this at the end
[21:51] of his life and caused him unstable as
[21:53] water does that remind you of anybody
[21:55] else
[21:55] reminds me of Peter how Peter was so
[21:57] unstable before the baptism of the Holy
[21:59] Ghost you know one day he's walking on
[22:01] water give it a few more years he's like
[22:04] I'll fight I'll die for you and then he
[22:06] runs at a maid you know who's trying to
[22:08] accuse him of being a follower of Christ
[22:10] which he was now this is the we'd say
[22:17] the hard part of Ruben or the the sins
[22:18] or the weaknesses of Ruben but later you
[22:23] know of course we know he redeemed
[22:24] himself we don't have time maybe it's go
[22:26] - lets go - 37 yeah maybe we have time
[22:28] Genesis 37 21 and 22 37 21 22 something
[22:38] must have happened to Reuben so even
[22:40] though we had sexual sin even though
[22:42] you know he didn't he actually loses as
[22:45] the Bible dictionary says he loses the
[22:48] honor of the firstborn he loses that
[22:50] honor because of what he did with his
[22:53] father's made in there or is he yeah
[22:58] made woman handmade that's kinda what
[23:01] I'm looking for so 37 21 and 22 I'll
[23:05] just read a and Reuben heard it and he
[23:07] delivered him out of their hands and
[23:08] said let us not kill him and Reuben said
[23:10] unto them shed no blood but cast him
[23:12] into this pit that is in the wilderness
[23:14] and lay no hand upon him that he might
[23:16] rid him rid him out of their hands to
[23:19] deliver him to his father again
[23:21] so Reuben at some point must have had a
[23:23] heart change right because first he was
[23:26] kind of did something awful to his
[23:28] father
[23:28] unstable well now he's so stable he
[23:31] stands up for a brother that's not even
[23:33] his full brother right this is Rachel's
[23:35] son so the some of the writers said you
[23:41] know he laid with Bilhah to kind of get
[23:44] back at his father but then here he
[23:46] stands up for the the son of Rachel and
[23:49] his father and so obviously he showed
[23:53] kindness to Joseph he was willing he
[23:55] wanted to save his life and he would go
[23:58] to great lengths to do that and he had a
[24:01] plan to bring him back so now Reuben has
[24:03] a heart to restore before I had a heart
[24:05] you know to do evil sexual sin now he's
[24:08] got a heart to save life and to restore
[24:10] life amen and that beautiful and then
[24:13] church remember when they were down in
[24:17] Egypt remember when he went down into
[24:18] Egypt he come back to Jacob his father
[24:21] and he's like if we don't bring Benjamin
[24:23] back he said you can add my two of my
[24:24] sons he was so willing to to stand up
[24:29] for life and he was so willing he was so
[24:32] sincere after that I'll just say it like
[24:33] that his sincerity really increased so
[24:36] of what we know about Reuben he had a
[24:39] really unstable start a really awful
[24:41] kind of start with his sexual sit and
[24:43] but then by God's grace he kind of got
[24:47] caught the redemption of God God was
[24:49] able to redeem his heart can I say like
[24:51] that
[24:51] so Reuben forfeited by his crime he
[24:56] forfeited the rights and honors of the
[24:59] firstborn but God does redeem in later
[25:02] did you know that the Prophet Hosea came
[25:04] out of Rubens lineage and Hosea was
[25:07] calling back the people remember he said
[25:09] return to the Lord return and so we see
[25:13] a lot of Reuben in that Reuben left
[25:15] through sexual sin but then he returned
[25:17] to the Lord and member in such a way
[25:20] that Jesus Christ gives him a crown and
[25:22] a white robe and said you sit up here
[25:24] you sit right here with the elders oh my
[25:27] that's beautiful
[25:28] okay next like I said I he's one of the
[25:31] ones we have the most information on now
[25:33] Simeon was the next one Simeon was the
[25:37] second son of Jacob by Leah he was
[25:40] associated with Levi in the terrible act
[25:42] of vengeance against Haymore and the
[25:45] sheet you might remember when they
[25:46] defiled their sister he was one that it
[25:49] was an awful thing it was a really evil
[25:51] thing he was detained by Joseph and
[25:53] Egypt as a hostage his father when dying
[25:57] pronounced malediction against him so
[25:59] let's read ed forty-nine five through
[26:01] seven forty-nine five through seven
[26:05] genesis forty nine five through seven
[26:14] Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments
[26:16] of Cruelty how would you like your dad
[26:18] to say that about you Oh son you were
[26:20] such a great son you were an instrument
[26:22] of evil this was his word that Jacob
[26:26] speaks about him and in their
[26:29] habitations oh my soul come not now into
[26:31] their secret under their assembly mine
[26:33] mine honor be not thou United for in
[26:36] their angers through they slew a man and
[26:38] in their self will they dig down a wall
[26:41] cursed be their anger for it was fierce
[26:43] and their wrath for it was cruel I would
[26:45] divide them in Jacob and scatter them in
[26:47] Israel in that striking that's what we
[26:50] know about Simeon he was cruel but one
[26:54] thing to encourage you I think I'll just
[26:56] start briefing this he was there when
[26:58] they went down Simeon was there when he
[27:00] went down into Egypt this is the these
[27:02] are the tribes going down in the Egypt
[27:04] here's the tribes coming out
[27:05] Simeon still there of the 144,000
[27:09] this is the 404,000 simians still there
[27:12] and in the millennium simians still
[27:16] there as well so we know for sure Simeon
[27:19] was one of those 12 that sits right next
[27:22] to Jesus I don't know which of the 12
[27:24] they were I don't know if it's the
[27:25] 144,000 twelve I don't know if it's the
[27:28] millennium 12 I'm not sure I mean if you
[27:30] know help me out after service you know
[27:32] because I need to study that out but
[27:35] Simeon although called khru by his
[27:37] father he must have had a good sacrifice
[27:40] right
[27:41] he must have presented the right kind of
[27:43] sacrifice because again he's given a
[27:45] crown as a ruler right and he's given
[27:48] white robe of righteousness of eternal
[27:50] life amen so see that's this that's what
[27:53] part of this message is I wanted to
[27:55] bring this out I wanted to show you
[27:56] there they're strong points but also
[27:58] they're failures so we can be encouraged
[28:01] about how God can redeem our lives and
[28:04] your family right your family you can
[28:07] think oh how could God ever redeem their
[28:09] lives but God can if God redeemed a
[28:12] Reuben from his sexual sin and Simeon
[28:15] from his cruel heart and his murders I
[28:17] mean that's what he did he murdered
[28:19] those men they murdered them after
[28:21] remember these circumcise him first and
[28:23] then while they were circumcised he had
[28:24] them murdered this I mean look at this
[28:26] cruel he's that's a very cruel thing to
[28:28] do but yet somehow the blood of the
[28:31] sacrifice was able to Humble him he had
[28:34] to repent because Christ gave me eternal
[28:35] life amen
[28:37] amazing aren't these things amazing like
[28:39] to me this is so amazing the love of God
[28:41] these are the ones God chose to sit on
[28:44] the throne the 24 elders my striking
[28:49] okay Levi Levi the third son of Jacob by
[28:53] Leah his name means join or adhesion
[28:58] he's mentioned as taking a prominent
[29:00] part in vengeance sister Dinah he and
[29:05] his three sons went down with Jacob into
[29:08] Egypt where he died at the age of 137
[29:10] years once we - one about Dinah well did
[29:16] we just read that one I'm sorry yeah we
[29:17] got to read that one okay yeah we did
[29:18] said Simeon and Levi our brethren
[29:21] instruments of Cruelty are there in
[29:23] their habitation
[29:23] so again Levi was there at the beginning
[29:27] remember he went down there into Egypt
[29:32] did he come out oh no he was serving
[29:34] them now when they come out okay because
[29:36] he was getting he was separated then
[29:37] later on by Moses and he was gonna serve
[29:39] the rest of the the tribes
[29:41] now remember Levi is inserted now so now
[29:45] Levi's been abhi accepted by God very
[29:48] soon when the hundred forty-four
[29:49] thousand are filled with the Holy Ghost
[29:51] so God is putting that tribe back in at
[29:54] the time of 144,000 so currently Levi's
[29:58] being gathered by God or the RAM said
[30:00] they might have lost all their records
[30:01] but God knows the record Amen God knows
[30:04] the genetic dejenne the necks of all the
[30:06] tribes and he's bringing him back
[30:07] together praise the Lord but then he's
[30:09] out so Levi's out in the Millennium so
[30:12] he must be out serving again or
[30:14] something like that I'm not sure but he
[30:17] said there at the beginning he's there
[30:19] at 244,000 but then remember the
[30:21] original that came out of Egypt and if
[30:23] you notice these two right here are the
[30:25] same these two are the same because they
[30:27] both have a ephraim and manasseh and
[30:29] they both have Dan and ephraim back in
[30:32] so we'll get to that more in a little
[30:34] bit by God's grace okay
[30:37] Judah was the fourth the fourth son of
[30:40] Jacob by Leah and his name of course
[30:43] means now I'll praise Jehovah
[30:46] Judah also interposed in behalf of
[30:48] Joseph so that his life was spared
[30:50] not only did Reuben stick up for Joseph
[30:54] so did Levi is it interesting that you
[30:56] know elyes remember he was he was one of
[30:59] the reasons that the priesthood went to
[31:01] the Levites because remember he stopped
[31:04] the plague when the Midianites were
[31:06] sleeping with the Jews or I'm sorry
[31:09] Moses the people remember he went in and
[31:11] Eleazar took the spear and thrust it
[31:14] through the man and the Mobin Irishwoman
[31:16] and of course he was of the tribe of
[31:19] Levi I'm sorry I'm speaking of Judah I'm
[31:23] sorry I got the wrong one there sorry
[31:24] about that Judah interposing behalf of
[31:26] Joseph okay so Judah did okay yeah sorry
[31:29] that was wrong forgive me that was wrong
[31:30] that was wrong I got those mixed up that
[31:33] was Levi now
[31:36] let's go to this I want to read this
[31:38] here Genesis 43 verse 3 so I got your
[31:43] Bible with Genesis 43 verse 3 here's
[31:55] where he helps out with with Joseph
[31:57] verse 3 Genesis 43 3 and Judas spake on
[32:00] him saying the man did soundly protest
[32:02] unto us saying ye shall not see my face
[32:04] except your brother be with you in other
[32:07] words he was gonna make sure they saw
[32:10] Joseph again he's gonna make sure he
[32:13] said if I don't come back with Joseph
[32:14] I'm not coming back either in other
[32:15] words I'm gonna die before I'll die if
[32:20] Joseph can't come back I'm putting my
[32:22] life on the line I'm gonna make sure
[32:24] with my life Joseph you see Joseph your
[32:26] son all right now go to Genesis 46 here
[32:30] let's go there 28
[32:47] she happens 4628 and he sent Judah
[32:51] before Monday Joseph direct his face
[32:53] unto Goshen and they came into the land
[32:56] of Goshen amen so Judah went before them
[32:59] right to make sure everything was all
[33:00] right with Joseph now go to Genesis back
[33:04] to Genesis 49 verse 8 and 9 here's where
[33:08] Judah Judah takes the firstborn
[33:11] prominence of the family because Reuben
[33:13] lost it because he slept with Billa
[33:15] so Reuben lost the the firstborn and
[33:17] that's why Judah is listed first I don't
[33:20] know if you caught that but they're
[33:21] listed in all kinds of different order
[33:23] their lists I listed them in the order
[33:24] they are in the Bible so in Genesis 35
[33:27] Reubens listed first they're listed by
[33:29] age here coming out of Egypt they're
[33:32] listed by I'm not sure but Jude is
[33:35] listed first because the rulership was
[33:38] with Judah and this is where it says it
[33:39] right here
[33:40] so Judah basically takes over the
[33:42] firstborn status although he was the
[33:44] fourth born son so that's in verse
[33:48] Genesis 49 verse 9 and 10 Judah is a
[33:54] lion's whelp from the prey my son thou
[33:57] art gone up he stooped down he crouched
[33:58] as a lion and as an old lion who shall
[34:01] rouse him up now here's where it is the
[34:04] scepter shall not depart from Judah nor
[34:06] a lawgiver from between his feet until
[34:09] shiloh come and unto Him shall the
[34:12] gathering of the people be alright see
[34:16] that so now he's got the scepter Reuben
[34:18] lost the scepter because of his sin and
[34:20] now Judah becomes the leader of the
[34:23] family right and we know who is the line
[34:26] of the tribe of Judah the Lord Jesus
[34:27] Christ amen
[34:29] so see you can see how that ties in
[34:32] perfectly the scepter shall not depart
[34:34] from Judah because Jesus is still ruling
[34:36] today amen
[34:37] but all we just have a heavenly kingdom
[34:39] and soon it'll be an earthly Kingdom
[34:41] praise God
[34:43] ok Dan is the fifth son of Jacob his
[34:48] mother Billa that's the one that Reuben
[34:51] slept with and he's also
[34:56] called the his name means judge because
[34:59] God hath judged me and the Bible
[35:04] dictionary says he's probably kind of
[35:07] foreshadowed as a judge because Samson
[35:10] was one of the greatest judges of Israel
[35:12] and Samson came out of Dan so let's see
[35:21] that's the main thing about Dan there's
[35:24] no like I said as we get to some of
[35:25] these later sons there's not much given
[35:26] about their lives so the ones that we
[35:29] are given the most on we just emphasize
[35:31] those but Dan was such a godly man he
[35:34] was there here here now his tribe his
[35:36] tribe lost we'll get to that in a little
[35:39] bit the tribe lost their position
[35:41] because of sin we'll get to that in just
[35:43] a moment here but he himself would have
[35:47] been a godly man and there he is back in
[35:50] the millennium praise the Lord he's back
[35:52] in his position in the Millennium
[35:53] alright Naphtali not much known about
[35:57] him individually although he had four
[35:59] sons he means my wrestling so I believe
[36:04] Naphtali stays the whole time yeah the
[36:08] whole time so God recognizes his
[36:11] righteousness the entire time by the
[36:13] grace of Lord and I just put a little
[36:15] note in there some of them we don't we
[36:17] know very little about but God saw their
[36:19] works and gave them a robe in a crowd
[36:22] right there's not much known about you
[36:24] and I may be right we might not be very
[36:26] famous people but God sees every one of
[36:29] our works amen and we can earn a robe
[36:31] and crown as well praise God
[36:33] although not much is known not much is
[36:35] written about Naphtali not much is known
[36:37] about him but God is watching every one
[36:39] of our works amen that's an
[36:41] encouragement to me praise the Lord
[36:43] dad he was the father of many sons his
[36:46] name means fortune God has given us
[36:48] fortune also means a troop cometh so
[36:58] he's
[36:58] as a great group and he's the father of
[37:00] many sons that's really all that's known
[37:03] about dad but I believe he stays the
[37:05] whole time as well yep dad live such a
[37:08] godly life
[37:09] he remains there and he'll be one that
[37:11] has a robe in the crown praise the Lord
[37:13] amen eighth was Asher Asher again we
[37:18] don't have much on him he was Jacobs
[37:20] eighth son
[37:21] his mother was Zilpah Leah's other hand
[37:23] or Leah's handmade and as the dictionary
[37:28] says of the tribe founded by him nothing
[37:31] is recorded beyond it's holding a place
[37:33] in the list of the tribes it increased
[37:37] in numbers 29% from Genesis 35 to Exodus
[37:41] chapter 1
[37:42] during the thirty-eight years wanderings
[37:45] the place of this tribe during the march
[37:47] was through the desert between Dan and
[37:49] Naphtali okay so see oh here's a good
[37:54] thing about it Anna the prophetess was
[37:58] of the tribe of who was that
[38:02] Asher okay so remember Hanna the one who
[38:04] prophesied of Christ and it's all Mary
[38:06] there in the temple that was from the
[38:08] tribe of Asher an Asscher means happy
[38:12] happy praise the Lord
[38:15] all right we're up to the ninth one
[38:17] already I told you this wasn't gonna be
[38:18] very long it's a car is the car was
[38:22] there the whole time as well yep praise
[38:24] the Lord the godly man instacart not
[38:26] much recorded in our books but no doubt
[38:28] in God's books his name means hired God
[38:31] hath given me my hire said Leah Leah
[38:34] birth Tim the ninth son and he had four
[38:38] sons at the going of the going down into
[38:41] Egypt he had four sons at this point he
[38:43] had four sons going down into Egypt okay
[38:54] so there's a blessing pronounced upon
[38:57] him let's read that Genesis 49 14 so he
[39:00] actually had a good blessing pronounced
[39:01] upon him okay
[39:10] Genesis 49 14 it's the car is as strong
[39:18] I'm sorry is a strong ask couching down
[39:21] between two burdens and he saw that rest
[39:24] was good and the land that it was
[39:27] pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear
[39:29] and became a servant unto tribute okay
[39:31] so he's a type of a servant there but
[39:35] it's a blessing upon him and in fact
[39:37] there's a lot more blessings I could
[39:38] have preached down there but I didn't go
[39:40] through that chapter very well chapter
[39:41] 49 that'd be a good one to follow up on
[39:45] okay so that's not a whole lot about
[39:47] it's a car that I found
[39:50] Zebulon the actual Bible Dictionary says
[39:53] little is known about his personal
[39:55] history although he did have three sons
[39:57] Zebulon but I believe he stays the whole
[39:59] time as well
[40:00] the godly man yep godly man Zebulon yep
[40:04] there he is Zebulon he was the youngest
[40:08] son of Leah all right now the 11th RUP
[40:12] the eleventh joseph we know a whole lot
[40:14] about him there's a whole he as these
[40:16] one we know the most about right the
[40:19] eldest of Rachel and Jacob and he was a
[40:23] perfect type of Christ praise the Lord
[40:25] so I don't want to I don't really need
[40:26] to preach too much on him other than he
[40:28] was a perfect type of Christ he went
[40:30] down of course or I'm sorry he was there
[40:32] before they went down to Egypt went down
[40:35] to Egypt ahead of all of them and then
[40:37] his sons replace him when they come out
[40:40] which is interesting and then he's back
[40:43] in at the 144,000 and then he's taken
[40:46] back out in Ezekiel here in the
[40:49] Millennium so again I'm not sure why
[40:53] that is like that let's look at Benjamin
[40:56] little is known about Benjamin it means
[40:59] the son of my right hand so Benjamin was
[41:01] right last week when we looked we talked
[41:02] about that
[41:06] other died Rachel died when giving him
[41:08] birth and his last at her last breath
[41:10] named him son of my pain but Jacob
[41:12] changed it to son of my right hand one
[41:16] thing that's interesting about Benjamin
[41:17] is they were very famous for being good
[41:19] archers and slingers so they were
[41:21] warriors they were fighters from the
[41:24] tribe of Benjamin and so it looks like
[41:27] Benjamin stays the whole time yeah so
[41:31] he's one of the twelve godly man
[41:33] Benjamin type in the hundred forty four
[41:37] thousand praise the Lord Amen now
[41:40] Ephraim now Ephraim and Manasseh a
[41:42] member are the two sons of Joseph okay
[41:49] so remember the first incident recorded
[41:51] about Ephraim is that along with his
[41:54] brother Manasseh before their
[41:55] grandfather Jacob that he might bless
[41:57] them the intention of Joseph was that
[42:00] the right hand of the aged patriarch
[42:03] should be placed on the head of the
[42:04] elder the two but Jacob set ephraim the
[42:07] younger before the brother
[42:09] okay so ephraim remember got the
[42:12] blessing member when Joseph
[42:14] or when God crossed his hands remember
[42:16] God had Joseph crossed his hands and
[42:18] Jacob gave the blessing to the younger
[42:20] one ephraim so Manasseh was offset
[42:23] heating at the blessing the blessing
[42:24] went to the younger and member brother
[42:27] Aaron tight that as the blessing coming
[42:28] through the cross the cross of Jesus
[42:30] Christ the RAM typed Ephraim as the
[42:33] Gentiles and Manasseh as the Jews where
[42:36] the RAM typed it that way and the
[42:38] blessing came to us even though we're we
[42:40] weren't the first ones the Jews were
[42:41] before us right but the blessing come to
[42:44] us through the cross of Jesus Christ
[42:45] amen
[42:46] and so we don't that we don't have a
[42:49] whole lot on Ephraim his personal life
[42:50] other than that and before Joseph died
[42:56] Ephraim family had reached the third
[42:58] generation that's really all we know
[42:59] about Ephraim not know we don't know a
[43:01] whole lot about him other than later
[43:03] that they fell away which we'll get to
[43:05] just a moment okay the last one so this
[43:08] is the fourteenth one right because
[43:09] there's 12 and then there's two added in
[43:11] the two taken away this is the
[43:13] fourteenth one Manasseh Manasseh God
[43:16] hath made me forget is what his name
[43:19] means
[43:20] oh and it says he married a Syrian which
[43:27] is interesting I'm not sure if that was
[43:29] good or bad I didn't read that scripture
[43:30] but it says the only thing afterwards
[43:32] recorded of him is that his
[43:33] grandchildren were brought up upon
[43:35] Joseph sneeze amen so at least we know
[43:41] his first descendants were brought up in
[43:43] the right place at the knees of Joseph
[43:45] and that would be a good place to be
[43:47] brought up okay so why we're Dan in the
[43:49] Ephraim deleted let's go to Deuteronomy
[43:51] 29 we'll review this this was in the
[43:54] church age book but also preached in the
[43:55] 7co 1963 Deuteronomy 29 16 so why were
[44:00] Dan and Ephraim deleted under heaven
[44:05] twenty nine sixteen to twenty twenty
[44:14] nine sixteen to twenty maokai can you
[44:15] read sixteen seventeen eighteen lady
[44:17] kiniry nineteen and twenty Deuteronomy
[44:26] 29 and could you read sixteen seventeen
[44:28] eighteen please okay twenty-nine yeah
[45:12] [Music]
[45:29] hey Liddy can you do 1920 please there
[45:54] it is so God would take out their names
[45:56] under heaven if they were mixed up in
[45:59] the idolatry of the false nations and
[46:01] just another point I'm gonna add
[46:03] something in here it just struck me do
[46:05] you know brother Branham said when
[46:05] Catholics or Lutheran's do you know
[46:07] Father Son Holy Ghost whatever they do
[46:09] or the RAM said their blessing
[46:10] themselves and that's what the Bible
[46:12] says right here a Kurt the curse of
[46:15] nations bless themselves in their heart
[46:17] right they say they continue to live in
[46:19] sin abominations right they'll evil
[46:22] things but then they still bless
[46:23] themselves because the Bible never said
[46:25] bless yourself in the name of the Father
[46:26] Son Holy Ghost whatever they're doing
[46:28] I'm not sure what things are connecting
[46:29] I'm not sure but brother Ram said they
[46:32] do that he said he had friends that
[46:34] would program said they would drive by
[46:35] the Catholic Church and they would bless
[46:37] themselves so see we're not trying to
[46:39] bless ourselves we want to be blessed by
[46:40] God and we want to stay away from
[46:42] anything that's accursed but see people
[46:45] try to bless themselves and have the
[46:48] curses of sin but you can't have both
[46:50] you got to have one or the other
[46:51] amen thank you okay okay Lydia so that's
[46:58] the pronunciation here Lydia read that
[47:01] okay I'm right let's go to first Kings
[47:03] 1225 first Kings 1225 and let's this is
[47:10] where Dan commits the sin of idolatry
[47:12] and he gets blotted out from under
[47:15] heaven so he he gets kicked out of the
[47:17] the tribes for this sin right here bless
[47:20] you or bless you bless you again yes sir
[47:24] first Kings 1225
[47:33] first Kings 1225 and church this is good
[47:38] remind
[47:39] remember Jesus can blot out names today
[47:41] my friend and my friends and I at the
[47:43] Bible Club were talking about that and
[47:45] he said what do you think about this I
[47:46] said well Jesus Christ Himself I said
[47:48] it's red letter words Jesus Christ said
[47:50] he's gonna blot out names out of that
[47:52] book and then remember Paul said he told
[47:55] the beloved he said my beloved
[47:56] Corinthians he said flee from idolatry
[47:58] run from it
[48:00] don't let anything become more important
[48:02] or more lovely in your heart than Jesus
[48:04] Christ amen because that's why their
[48:08] names are removed from for idolatry for
[48:10] idolizing something other than God okay
[48:13] first Kings 1225 then Jeroboam be built
[48:20] Sheetz him in the mount ephraim and
[48:22] dwelt there and went out thence and
[48:24] built Penuel and Jeroboam said in his
[48:27] heart now shall the kingdom return to
[48:29] the house of David if this people go up
[48:31] to do sacrifice in the house the lord of
[48:33] jerusalem then shall the heart of this
[48:35] people turn again unto their Lord even
[48:37] unto ray of bone king of Judah and they
[48:40] shall kill me and go again to Raya bone
[48:42] king of Judah now let's stop right there
[48:44] in that interesting this King knew
[48:46] Jeroboam knew if they get to God's
[48:48] provide a place of worship their hearts
[48:50] are gonna turn to God amen doesn't say
[48:53] no the same thing today if you actually
[48:55] come to the house of God with the right
[48:57] attitude your hearts going to be turned
[48:58] to Christ so so Satan tries to do
[49:01] anything except except come to church
[49:04] don't come to church anything you can do
[49:05] to keep them out of church err or make
[49:07] them not enjoy Church err or do
[49:09] something to pervert the church
[49:11] experience Satan knows he can keep their
[49:13] hearts away from the Lord oh my that's
[49:16] striking verse 28 whereupon the King
[49:19] took counsel and made two calves of gold
[49:20] and said then it is too much for you to
[49:22] go up to Jerusalem oh it's too hard to
[49:24] go to church here I'm making you your
[49:26] own church behold thy God's o Israel
[49:29] which brought thee up out of the land of
[49:31] Egypt and he set one in Bethel and the
[49:33] other he put in Dan and this thing
[49:36] became a sin for the people went to
[49:38] worship before the one even unto Dan so
[49:40] see Dan allowed this the tribe of Dan
[49:42] allowed this Idol to stay there this
[49:44] false worship place and because of that
[49:47] God removes their name so after that
[49:51] moment well this was the time okay this
[49:52] is a thousand
[49:53] years before Christ right Salman was a
[49:55] thousand years this is right after
[49:56] Solomon so nine hundred or so years dan
[50:00] gets his name removed and his tribe will
[50:03] not be here in the hundred forty-four
[50:05] thousand that's striking okay now let's
[50:10] go to Hosea 4:17 so we see Dan remove
[50:13] because they went to a false church
[50:15] right they went to church that was
[50:16] actually an idol instead of true worship
[50:19] when they should have went to God's
[50:20] provided place of worship
[50:21] Hosea 4:17 Daniel Hosea
[50:25] that's good good way to get a Daniel
[50:28] Hosea Joel Amos Hosea 4:17 now sixteen
[50:44] talks about Israel slide it back as the
[50:46] backsliding heifer now the Lord will
[50:48] feed them as a lamb in a large place
[50:49] Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone
[50:52] so God literally says have nothing to do
[50:55] with Ephraim Strieber
[50:56] they're so deep in idolatry now what's
[51:01] striking again church what's striking is
[51:03] that that man and that tribe itself the
[51:05] man will probably be there you know I'll
[51:08] probably be there or unless that's here
[51:09] but his tribe will be represented in the
[51:11] Millennium so God is gonna again forgive
[51:13] idolatry God can forgive idolatry God
[51:18] can forgive sexual sin God can forgive
[51:21] violence and murder God is the great
[51:23] forgiving God amen and that's what this
[51:25] lesson teaches us the love and mercy of
[51:27] Jesus Christ amen so now let me just
[51:33] explain this again so these are the
[51:34] families when they went down into Egypt
[51:36] okay those are the families represented
[51:39] here's the families coming out so Joseph
[51:42] and Levi are taking out Levi Levi is
[51:44] taken to be the priesthood and then
[51:47] Joseph's two sons are brought and that's
[51:49] what the yellow are Joseph's two sons
[51:51] yeah yeah because Ephraim was removed
[51:54] here okay and then Ephraim and Manasseh
[51:56] are back okay and then these two
[51:58] asterisks are the two that transgressed
[52:01] against God they had idolatry they're
[52:02] removed and so I put a reminder up there
[52:04] that's why they're not here in the
[52:06] 144,000 and you have Levi and Joseph
[52:09] back and inserted back in there to
[52:11] always have 12 and then those two are
[52:16] taken out here in the time of
[52:18] restoration and again we see the grace
[52:21] of God somehow God is able to block blot
[52:24] their names out under heaven but he
[52:26] still forgives them in heaven I can't
[52:29] explain that I just know the Bible says
[52:32] that but I can't explain that somehow
[52:34] God can still forgive them in heaven but
[52:36] under heaven there's a temporary
[52:38] judgment against them okay so that's
[52:43] something that is very striking and must
[52:45] we must remember that by the grace of
[52:48] God let me see if I've got anything else
[52:50] on that topic there okay I think that's
[52:57] it okay so I did all this to say these
[53:00] last few things despite their failures
[53:02] and sins
[53:03] Christ granted 12 of these eternal life
[53:07] and not only that but he gave them white
[53:09] robes crowns and Thrones so in the in
[53:15] that case think of the Crown's why do
[53:16] you get a crown because you're a ruler
[53:19] you overcame something so all 12 of
[53:22] these sons despite their shortcomings at
[53:24] some point they had to overcome it
[53:26] now church I hope that encourages it
[53:28] encourages you with and I whenever we're
[53:30] struggling with God is gonna help us
[53:32] overcome it whether he's got a humble us
[53:35] whether he's gonna set us down in the
[53:37] hospital till we make something right
[53:39] whatever he's got to do he's gonna help
[53:41] us overcome because we have to be
[53:44] overcomers we have to rule over sin on
[53:46] this side in order to rule on that side
[53:49] so these are ones that overcome and a
[53:51] throne course represents judgment so
[53:54] they these twelve have had to have the
[53:56] righteous judgment of God God had had to
[54:00] teach them this is how you judge this is
[54:02] how you rule this is how you're supposed
[54:04] to live the right kind of life and
[54:06] remember all these things are taught by
[54:09] God's grace God graciously has patience
[54:11] with us and we must have patience with
[54:14] one another
[54:15] how many know that God wants us to be a
[54:17] family and sometimes families go through
[54:20] how
[54:20] seasons they have times where it's hard
[54:23] to love each other there's certain
[54:24] situations it's hard to deal with
[54:26] imagine you know haven't known your
[54:28] brother Ruben slept with this woman you
[54:30] know your mother he slept with your
[54:32] mother you know can you imagine that or
[54:34] your two brothers were really cruel and
[54:36] murderers and all these things and can
[54:38] you imagine all of Joseph's brother and
[54:41] most of them wanted to see him killed
[54:44] let's go back there most of them wanted
[54:47] to see Joseph killed most of these
[54:48] except for maybe Reuben and Judah all
[54:51] the other ones went to see him killed
[54:52] and but because of God's grace and
[54:55] Joseph's forgiveness they must have
[54:57] repented of that at the end time oh my
[54:59] Oh think about how God church we ought
[55:02] to have confidence God will orchestrate
[55:03] every part of our lives in order to
[55:06] purify us and make us just like Christ
[55:08] amen if we are if we're the bride and if
[55:12] we are gonna rule some day Jesus will
[55:14] orchestrate every part of our life to
[55:17] drive out every part of our sin that we
[55:19] might rule on this side amen
[55:22] oh my that's beautiful merci so again
[55:27] all these failures are able to be
[55:31] redeemed by the blood of Christ and
[55:32] notice this this is the last thing I
[55:34] think I think I'll say before I finish
[55:36] and I preached about 40 minutes each of
[55:40] these 12 so the 12 sons and the 12
[55:43] apostles they have the same reward did
[55:45] you notice that they have the same
[55:47] rewards they all get the crowns they all
[55:52] get robes right and they all have
[55:55] Thrones and this is because they
[55:58] overcame the trials of their own day as
[56:01] leaders in their day right they both
[56:05] overcame so Jesus gives them all those
[56:07] same rewards but the remember there's a
[56:09] special reward for Peter and the 12
[56:11] apostles because they got the baptism of
[56:14] the Holy Ghost they left everything to
[56:16] follow Jesus their position is a little
[56:19] more special with a few more promises
[56:22] but other than that as far as eternal
[56:24] life
[56:24] they're both given the same rewards
[56:27] because they overcame in their day an
[56:29] hour amen let's stay on our feet praise
[56:32] the Lord
[56:33] and I hope that's an encouragement
[56:35] because we just have to overcome for our
[56:38] day we've got to overcome what's what's
[56:40] what's the difficult part of our age you
[56:43] know we know it's nervous tension we
[56:44] know it's the pressures of riches and
[56:47] nervous tensions of life we've got to
[56:49] look and see my arse all these obstacles
[56:52] obstacles in our lives but we can
[56:55] overcome by the power of the Holy Spirit
[56:57] and we must overcome by the grace of God
[56:59] amen
[57:02] hope that was a blessing like I said
[57:04] that didn't have as much time as I
[57:05] wanted to study on that but I got a good
[57:06] start and perhaps we'll look about more
[57:08] about that on Wednesday night by the
[57:10] grace of the Lord we'll see what the
[57:11] Lord has in the store I hope that was
[57:13] encouragement for you and if you want a
[57:15] copy of that one let me know it was very
[57:18] helpful for me I could I searched the
[57:20] internet I couldn't find anything that
[57:21] showed it so I had to create my own I
[57:22] spent about two hours on this yesterday
[57:24] typing everything out and put it in the
[57:26] right order because no one else had it
[57:27] because it's a special revelation for
[57:30] the message of the hour God gave that to
[57:32] a prophet and I believe there's more
[57:34] things that God can teach us in there
[57:35] are just we just got to keep digging in
[57:36] the scripture but so so encouraging to
[57:40] know that despite their sins despite
[57:43] their failures God could redeem their
[57:45] life amen
