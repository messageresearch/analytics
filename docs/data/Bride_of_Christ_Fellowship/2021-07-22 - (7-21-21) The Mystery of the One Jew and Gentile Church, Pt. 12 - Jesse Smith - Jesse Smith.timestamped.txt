[0:22] helped me to understand the real
[0:24] importance of this and how it really
[0:25] relates to today
[0:27] the unity in a local church you know not
[0:29] having any division amongst

[1:31] few words

[1:34] my knowledge in the mystery of christ so
[1:36] see
[1:37] some people are so against knowledge and
[1:39] understanding and
[1:40] doctrine that if they do that they're

[4:20] and minister now by the holy spirit in
[4:21] jesus christ's name and the saint said
[4:24] amen god bless yours being seated praise
[4:26] god
[4:27] so last week we finished with the the
[4:29] prophetic calendar of the seven feasts
[4:31] of
[4:31] israel uh that's in course chapter three
[4:34] uh in the book which lord willing you
[4:36] have on
[4:36] sunday and then church you know if you
[4:39] pray about it let me know if you want
[4:40] copies for your family or something like
[4:42] that i can just
[4:43] i can just type it in i can mail right
[4:45] to them i just need their address you
[4:46] know
[4:47] i don't know about overseas i don't know
[4:48] about that so
[4:50] hold up on the overseas one i don't i
[4:53] don't know how that works you know i've
[4:54] never mailed things overseas
[4:56] but if there's anyone in the u.s you
[4:58] know i could easily do that but
[5:01] so here we will finish up i want to end
[5:03] this with the rewards and consequences
[5:06] for either receiving this revelation or
[5:08] rejecting it you know every
[5:10] that's one thing when i started studying
[5:12] this this topic i realized if god has a
[5:14] mystery
[5:15] well there must be a reward for
[5:17] receiving it right
[5:18] but there must also be a consequence of
[5:20] rejecting it
[5:22] right it's like with the baptism of the
[5:23] holy ghost if someone rejects that
[5:25] while they they're either going to be
[5:26] foolish virgin make believer or
[5:28] unbeliever right they're going to be one
[5:30] of those
[5:30] but if they receive it they're going to
[5:32] be the wise virgin praise god they're
[5:33] going to be
[5:34] the wife of heaven praise god or the
[5:35] wife of christ the queen of heaven
[5:37] i mean what a great reward praise god
[5:40] being a king and priest
[5:41] on this earth i mean what a tremendous
[5:43] blessing praise god
[5:45] like i was telling with amen remember
[5:46] when you reached over and prayed for him
[5:48] you were like a priest unto god you were
[5:49] you were interceding in his sickness and
[5:52] he was instantly healed that was you
[5:53] know
[5:54] a while ago but that was just a
[5:55] beautiful example of being a priestess
[5:57] unto god i thought i was sharing with
[5:59] that him on sunday there
[6:01] just as a reminder like look how look
[6:03] how uh look how humble it is right look
[6:05] how look how simple it is you know
[6:07] you're just you're laying there in bed
[6:08] and you just you've got that you have to
[6:10] have the faith
[6:10] to lay your hand on your husband and
[6:12] intercede just like that in a moment's
[6:14] time
[6:15] it didn't take a prayer meeting it just
[6:16] took faith
[6:18] it just took following leadership of the
[6:19] lord i mean what a what a beautiful
[6:21] example of that praise god i just
[6:22] thought that's
[6:23] just such a godly example of christ you
[6:25] know uh how simple this is it
[6:28] god's revelations are that way god's
[6:30] mysteries are that way they're so simple
[6:32] if you don't humble yourself it'll go
[6:34] right over top of your head
[6:35] so thank god we've humbled ourselves
[6:37] praise god that we can receive
[6:39] the revelations of the mysteries of god
[6:41] amen
[6:42] and so this mystery is that god has
[6:44] joined jew and gentile into one body or
[6:47] one temple with all the same rights uh
[6:50] blessings
[6:50] privileges privileges rather and
[6:53] fellowship so
[6:54] the first uh reward for receiving this
[6:58] as far as i was studying was it was
[7:00] called fellowship so the first reward is
[7:03] fellowship
[7:04] okay which also means partnership okay
[7:08] so the bible paul says all men can see
[7:11] the fellowship of the mystery
[7:13] that's what paul says in ephesians 1. he
[7:15] said all men can see the fellowship
[7:18] and that word means partnership so
[7:20] church when we get a revelation we
[7:22] actually start realizing who our
[7:23] partners are
[7:24] but i'll say like this realize who
[7:26] they're not as well right
[7:28] like we're not partnering with the roman
[7:29] catholic church right we're not going to
[7:31] partner with them we're trying to call
[7:32] them out praise god
[7:34] so see that shows they don't have the
[7:35] revelation of the mystery
[7:37] because when you get the revelation of
[7:38] the mystery it shows you who your
[7:40] partners are
[7:41] amen at church we can partner with the
[7:43] foolish virgin like
[7:44] abraham partner with lot right and thank
[7:47] god they did partnership because lot got
[7:48] saved through it
[7:49] hey praise god and it made lot an
[7:52] intercessor
[7:53] i'm sorry i made abraham an intercessor
[7:55] for love praise god
[7:57] because the bible records that god heard
[7:59] abraham's prayer
[8:00] and sent angels down the side of and
[8:03] pulled out lot
[8:04] right out of sound that's what god's
[8:06] doing with us making us intercessors
[8:08] praise god don't mean to punch things
[8:10] but to pull out his people
[8:12] out of those systems thank god he pulled
[8:14] you out and now god wants to pull some
[8:16] more out praise god
[8:17] just like simon preached to us praise
[8:19] god i thought that was a vindication
[8:20] that we're supposed to go out and call
[8:21] people out of denominations
[8:23] hallelujah do i expect some persecution
[8:26] yes do i expect some rejection
[8:27] yes do i expect to get pushed out of
[8:29] churches well hopefully not
[8:31] but but i do expect uh that
[8:35] i'll get to partner with somebody praise
[8:37] god you know partner
[8:38] and and uh and benefit benefit from
[8:42] godly partnership like the people we
[8:44] pray for jose that got babies
[8:45] they don't even go to message churches i
[8:48] don't even know
[8:48] if my co-worker goes to church
[8:52] but god we partnered with them to be a
[8:54] blessing to them
[8:55] but man said that's the reward of a
[8:57] prophet you just you know when you
[8:59] minister to him
[9:00] are you you honor a prophet he said he
[9:02] might pray for you he might do something
[9:04] nice for you to pray for you
[9:05] and so we got the prophet's message
[9:07] right and so we're
[9:09] we're with the authority of the bible
[9:11] through a prophet we're able to bless
[9:13] people and partner with them
[9:15] to be a blessing to them that rabbi said
[9:16] that's what god wants to do he wants to
[9:18] bless his people
[9:19] he said god wants to make life a little
[9:21] easier for me human
[9:23] and mankind on this earth that's what
[9:26] we're here for
[9:27] blessing other people praise god because
[9:29] remember the blessing comes for you
[9:31] you're abraham's children praise god and
[9:33] through you the whole world is blessed
[9:35] through you and i
[9:36] praise god and all the saints all of
[9:38] abraham's seed
[9:39] the word is blessed like those
[9:40] saints that god blessed with those
[9:41] prayer costs brother jose
[9:43] right got healing they got blessed
[9:45] through you right through because god is
[9:47] blessing the world
[9:48] through the seed of abraham the
[9:49] spiritual seed of abram and boy he looks
[9:51] like abraham today don't he
[9:53] simon loves that but i just thought i
[9:55] bought joking there
[9:58] simon could hardly compliment that any
[10:00] higher brother
[10:02] oh thank god now back to the facts
[10:06] back to the reality it's a godly
[10:08] partnership no matter your race
[10:10] culture or skin color god doesn't he
[10:13] he doesn't divide us on that like the
[10:15] democrats and some republicans do
[10:17] he unites us on those things amen
[10:20] because we see there's something greater
[10:21] than that
[10:22] it's the image of christ that we see in
[10:24] people not the physical image
[10:26] but the spiritual image the character of
[10:28] christ amen
[10:30] that we see behind people's lives
[10:32] remember this is just a
[10:33] this is just a coat praise god the real
[10:35] me is inside of this praise god
[10:37] it doesn't matter so much what's on the
[10:39] outside it matters what's on the inside
[10:42] amen so we partner mainly we partner in
[10:45] prayer
[10:46] and helping out with physical needs and
[10:48] spreading the gospel
[10:50] just like paul told those philippians he
[10:52] said you're the only one that met my
[10:54] financial needs
[10:55] uh in philippians chapter four you're
[10:58] the only one that
[10:59] ministered unto my necessities right
[11:03] so that was a partnership god said god
[11:05] looked down at paul and said well
[11:07] my prophet needs a partner i'm going to
[11:09] anoint those philippian church
[11:10] i'm anoint them to partner with paul
[11:12] gentiles with the jew
[11:15] see partnering together see someone see
[11:16] church that's what we got to be we just
[11:18] got to be a blessing
[11:19] we just got to be a partnership to
[11:21] somebody praise god
[11:23] so just so you know this week uh i don't
[11:24] know if they heard my sermon last week
[11:26] how i'm giving out more offerings
[11:28] but somebody uh from uganda sent me a uh
[11:31] a message so i sent them a little love
[11:33] offering this week so we're trying to
[11:34] and i i know they're really hurt you
[11:36] know
[11:36] they've always been that nation's
[11:38] destitute you know it's in the horn of
[11:40] africa ma that's just such a destitute
[11:41] area
[11:42] so the brother's like i can't find a job
[11:43] we got no food i'm like okay i'll send a
[11:45] little love offering there
[11:46] may god bless you he thanked me for it i
[11:48] hope that's what he's using it for you
[11:49] know i mean
[11:50] but jesus didn't say ask what were they
[11:52] going to do with the money jesus said
[11:53] give
[11:55] he said give and hope for nothing in
[11:57] return
[11:58] amen hallelujah so we just gotta follow
[12:00] the words of christ amen
[12:02] so see partnering we gotta partner with
[12:04] people to meet their spiritual and
[12:07] physical needs
[12:10] so you know putting that test you know i
[12:12] told brother amen about that testimony
[12:14] about that woman
[12:15] having the baby i told amen about that
[12:17] and who was the one that asked me to
[12:18] give that testimony it was amen
[12:21] so amen said brothers yes give your
[12:23] testimony i remember
[12:24] jose's testimony there we prayed for
[12:26] that two two couples had the babies
[12:28] and so i so amen is the one that
[12:30] inspired me to do it
[12:32] i give the testimony it goes online and
[12:34] i don't even know where this woman lives
[12:35] she must live in the u.s
[12:36] but she watches it and shortly
[12:38] thereafter she conceives and has the
[12:40] baby
[12:41] see we just partner together like i
[12:43] wasn't really wanting to give my
[12:44] testimony but amen would like me to give
[12:46] it so i said okay i'll give it you know
[12:48] and that isn't that awesome blessing you
[12:49] know here we are over a year after that
[12:51] was put on the internet
[12:52] and we're getting testimonies just about
[12:53] how god see church god
[12:55] knows who wants his word and god will
[12:58] use
[12:58] any channel to get his word to his
[13:01] people praise god
[13:02] it might be a track it might be a sermon
[13:04] live it might be through a tape
[13:06] right it might be through an internet
[13:08] god is going to make sure his word
[13:10] gets to those predestinated seeds he has
[13:13] a need to go by uganda he has a need to
[13:16] go by we'll say akron he has a need to
[13:18] go by europe
[13:19] when he has needs he's going to meet
[13:21] those needs he's going to find
[13:23] somebody who's willing to meet those
[13:25] needs he's going to anoint them
[13:26] and they can be used for god's glory
[13:28] because their partnership
[13:29] they're partnering with the fellowship
[13:31] of the mystery praise god amen
[13:35] all men can see the fellowship of the
[13:37] mystery
[13:40] hallelujah so that's church that's one
[13:43] way
[13:44] that that's one reward we get to partner
[13:46] with people
[13:47] to help out sinners saints whoever it
[13:50] would be
[13:51] if we receive this revelation we'll
[13:53] start seeing wow we can really partner
[13:55] to do more for the kingdom of god we can
[13:57] do more together
[13:59] and of course locally you know preachers
[14:01] want to cooperate within cities now i
[14:03] know cities where preachers won't even
[14:04] shake hands
[14:06] i've had friends from north carolina
[14:07] come up here brother they have message
[14:09] churches they say just across the road
[14:10] and they don't even fellowship
[14:11] and that is that a shame in america
[14:15] but the bible says in galatians 2
[14:18] that when james cephas and john were
[14:21] pillars
[14:22] and perceived grace was given to paul
[14:28] gave to paul barnabas the right hands of
[14:30] fellowship
[14:32] so see there's that partnership it's
[14:34] preachers working together praise god
[14:36] no no no of course remember we have to
[14:39] uh you have to discern someone brother
[14:40] say you have to discern someone's spirit
[14:42] before you you trust them right
[14:44] he said you got to discern their spirit
[14:46] so you know before i'll partner with a
[14:48] preacher i got to discern their spirit
[14:50] and make sure they got the right spirit
[14:52] right just want to partner with somebody
[14:54] that well just because they say they
[14:55] believe the message there's a lot of
[14:56] people that say they believe the message
[14:57] they don't believe the message
[14:59] their lives tell a different story so
[15:02] as we partner with people we've also
[15:04] also got to discern their spirit
[15:06] and watch the fruits of their lives what
[15:09] are their lives producing
[15:11] and it should look very similar praise
[15:12] god it should look very similar to our
[15:14] lives
[15:15] they should have the same gospel they
[15:17] shall they should preach the same gospel
[15:18] they should live the same kind of lives
[15:20] they should have the same desires we
[15:22] have
[15:22] not to be rich in this world but to be
[15:24] rich in treasures in heaven amen
[15:27] we should get that same spirit we should
[15:29] catch that same spirit
[15:31] that they're motivated by the same
[15:32] things we are
[15:35] okay so that's the first reward
[15:36] partnership we get to partner to help
[15:39] people
[15:39] and partner with ministries
[15:43] now the second reward is benefiting from
[15:46] god's promises or these are
[15:47] called inheritances right
[15:51] paul says all spirit-filled jews and
[15:53] gentiles
[15:54] are fellow heirs and of the same body
[15:57] and partakers of his promise
[15:59] in christ by the gospel that's ephesians
[16:02] 3 6 we read that tonight
[16:04] so we are all partakers so in other
[16:06] words we can all go to the same fountain
[16:08] and drink
[16:09] praise god so jesus christ is a fountain
[16:12] of living water he's living water
[16:14] we can all go to that water when we're
[16:16] thirsty and partake
[16:17] church let's not keep people out let's
[16:19] invite them in praise god
[16:21] let's invite them in we can all be
[16:23] partakers
[16:24] of the promises of god this person needs
[16:26] healing oh can i pray for you
[16:28] you can partake of the promise of
[16:30] healing oh you need salvation
[16:32] you need sanctification oh come here i
[16:34] know i know something that can help you
[16:35] out
[16:36] uh there's these great promises and
[16:38] through these promises
[16:39] we are partakers of the divine nature
[16:42] amen
[16:43] there's that good word nature again see
[16:46] it's
[16:46] this is what paul says are the rewards
[16:49] partnership
[16:50] to help and then also partake of the
[16:52] promises
[16:54] we're all privileges with the same
[16:57] privilege with the same promises
[16:59] and eternal rewards as well as the
[17:01] earthly benefits of our salvation
[17:05] so that's also salvation divine healing
[17:08] gifts of the holy spirit
[17:09] fruits of the holy spirit and more
[17:13] praise god now it seems like i'm missing
[17:15] something here on my notes
[17:18] okay no no no i didn't get again okay
[17:21] yeah that's uh
[17:22] that's something else okay
[17:25] now church the bible says we should have
[17:28] confidence boldness and access
[17:30] with confidence to heaven's only high
[17:33] priest
[17:34] jesus christ so when we have a need we
[17:36] have to remember we have a high priest
[17:38] who can make intercession and give us
[17:41] the promise that we're hoping for
[17:44] praise god and so we must go there with
[17:46] boldness
[17:47] and confidence i know it's hard that's
[17:49] you know god's greatest enemy is time
[17:51] right
[17:52] and so sometimes we may not feel as
[17:54] confident as always
[17:56] but we've got to continue we got to
[17:58] encourage ourselves in the lord
[18:00] and if we you know we can't encourage
[18:02] ourselves go talk to somebody who will
[18:03] encourage
[18:04] us right call somebody you know that
[18:06] will encourage you
[18:07] if you can't encourage yourself go call
[18:09] somebody who's on fire right
[18:11] get or just go listen to your favorite
[18:13] sermon or with a favorite one brother
[18:14] and preacher whatever one
[18:16] be encouraged because the bible said we
[18:18] have to pray prayers of
[18:20] faith not prayers of unbelief or prayers
[18:23] of hope
[18:23] we got to play pray prayers of faith
[18:26] with boldness and confidence
[18:28] and not lose our confession of faith
[18:30] because faithful is he that promised
[18:33] amen
[18:35] that's why i read that testimony from
[18:36] tonight my
[18:38] just a few just a few weeks after
[18:41] hearing our testimony
[18:42] god answered that woman in a few weeks
[18:44] or days after hearing that prayer
[18:46] god answered that prayer you know
[18:48] administered to this person
[18:50] and so see that should encourage us to
[18:51] keep coming with boldness
[18:53] and confidence keep believing keep
[18:55] trusting
[18:56] show some perseverance praise god amen
[18:59] show some dedication we should uh we
[19:01] should show some confidence
[19:03] that the same god who's answered before
[19:05] we'll answer again
[19:06] amen and his timing is the best timing
[19:10] how many can say amen to that praise god
[19:12] god's timing is always
[19:14] the best see faithful prayers of jew and
[19:17] gentiles
[19:18] they touch the heart of god through the
[19:20] son
[19:22] because the bible says he feels our pain
[19:24] and
[19:25] is ever lives to make intercession for
[19:28] us
[19:28] oh my church god feels what you're going
[19:31] through praise god
[19:32] jesus feels it jesus is god right jesus
[19:35] feels the pain he knows the suffering he
[19:38] knows the hurt
[19:39] and because of that he said i'll wait to
[19:40] the right time to answer that request
[19:43] surely i'll answer that request because
[19:45] i can relate to that
[19:46] our high priest can be touched and our
[19:48] high priest never dies amen
[19:51] he's after the order of melchizedek he
[19:53] cannot die amen
[19:54] he died but now he's alive forevermore
[19:57] amen
[19:58] aaron and them all died they all died
[20:00] but jesus died but rose again
[20:03] and he's a priest forever after the
[20:05] order the divine appointment of
[20:07] melchizedek amen
[20:09] in other words just as melchizedek was
[20:11] appointed by god
[20:13] now keswick was not appointed by men
[20:16] melchizedek was appointed by god but see
[20:18] aaron and all aaron's sons
[20:20] were appointed by men and that's why
[20:22] it's a different priest and that's the
[20:23] order of aaron
[20:24] but we're under the priest jesus christ
[20:27] who was not appointed by man
[20:29] he was appointed by god amen and because
[20:32] of that you know he's faithful you know
[20:34] he's divine
[20:35] you know he'll answer he's infallible
[20:37] he'll never fail he'll never change
[20:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[20:40] forever amen
[20:42] hallelujah have confidence in god praise
[20:44] the lord
[20:46] let's have confidence in the lord jesus
[20:47] christ he can talk
[20:49] he can be touched and he can feel your
[20:51] pain
[20:53] whenever i sigh and cry for the
[20:55] abomination of this city
[20:57] i feel like i've touched the heart of
[20:58] god do you feel that way too brother
[21:00] whenever i whenever i'm the most sincere
[21:02] in my prayers
[21:04] i feel like i've touched his heart do
[21:05] you feel like that like i almost feel
[21:07] like i'm going to burst inside like i
[21:09] don't even know how
[21:10] i can express this in any other way than
[21:12] weeping and crying
[21:13] and you know interceding for people see
[21:16] what have we done we've touched the
[21:17] heart of god amen
[21:19] we're like david we're a church after
[21:21] the heart of christ
[21:22] amen we're after his very heart because
[21:26] because i always always at the end of
[21:27] every prayer we can always say lord let
[21:30] your will be done not mine and i know
[21:33] you feel my request i know you feel my
[21:35] pain
[21:36] but ultimately i know you feel my faith
[21:38] and my confidence that you will answer
[21:40] in your time
[21:42] amen praise god
[21:45] that's beautiful now church give me a
[21:48] moment i just had a thought here
[21:50] um oh yeah bear with me here uh i had a
[21:54] list of rewards
[21:58] i just want to rehearse with you real
[21:59] quickly here i just just trust the holy
[22:02] spirit will help me to find it real
[22:03] quick
[22:06] i think you could give a drink of water
[22:07] i think was one of the rewards
[22:12] so in the book i forget which chapter it
[22:13] is this thing is searching for it oh man
[22:18] maybe it's a cup of water
[22:29] ah anyways i put in the book there are
[22:35] 16 rewards let's see chapter eight is
[22:38] probably around like page 400 to 500.
[22:43] and i think i went over them before but
[22:44] there's uh unless there's 16 equal
[22:48] opportunity rewards okay that's the
[22:49] parable of the pounds okay now i got
[22:52] that's right parable of pounds
[22:58] i appreciate your patience i've ever
[23:01] told you that church you're a lovely
[23:02] group you're very patient
[23:04] i like how brotherham says that he said
[23:05] you're a good class
[23:08] okay here they are i found them thank
[23:09] the lord you get reward church everybody
[23:11] has
[23:12] everybody here has the same opportunity
[23:14] to gain all these rewards right here
[23:17] if you withstand persecution you get a
[23:19] great heavenly reward
[23:21] if you give alms in secret you have an
[23:23] open reward that people will see in
[23:24] public
[23:26] if you pray in secret you get an open
[23:27] reward if you fast in secret you get an
[23:30] open public reward
[23:32] if you receive a prophet or a righteous
[23:34] man
[23:35] you receive a prophets or righteous
[23:37] man's reward
[23:40] like we just said the benefits of
[23:41] knowing the prophet amen
[23:43] and all the revelation that he gives us
[23:45] if you provide food drink
[23:47] shelter or clothes to a christian or
[23:49] visit someone when they're sick or in
[23:50] prison
[23:51] it yields an entrance into life eternal
[23:53] according to jesus
[23:55] if you give an apostle a cup of water
[23:57] for christ's sake it yields a reward
[24:00] if you love your enemies bless those who
[24:02] persecute you pray for those who
[24:04] despitefully use you
[24:05] lending with no hope of repayment yields
[24:07] a great reward along with the title
[24:09] of being called the children of the
[24:11] highest amen
[24:13] i believe that makes you a child of god
[24:15] when you give food or your time or money
[24:17] and you don't want nothing back
[24:19] that proves you're a child of the king
[24:22] hosting a feast for someone less
[24:24] fortunate resurrection of the just
[24:29] think about the rewards people are going
[24:30] to have fighting the good fight of faith
[24:33] finishing the course keeping the
[24:34] christian faith yields a crowd
[24:36] of righteousness how many want to wear a
[24:39] crown
[24:40] we sing that song we shall wear a crown
[24:43] in that new
[24:44] jerusalem you gotta fight first he won
[24:46] the crown everybody wants the crown
[24:48] without the fight
[24:49] we'll fight right now let's keep
[24:51] overcoming praise let's keep driving
[24:52] back the enemy praise god
[24:54] let's conquer our jericho's amen let's
[24:57] conquer our ais
[24:58] let's conquer all these enemies that
[25:01] have come against us the the kings and
[25:03] and the the the demons of this world and
[25:05] the spiritual wickedness high places
[25:07] let's overcome it let's be more than
[25:09] conquerors amen
[25:11] let's earn that crowd of righteousness
[25:14] if you provide a christian's physical
[25:16] necessities
[25:18] it yields a heavenly reward upon a
[25:20] giver's account
[25:22] if you do anything heartily ask to the
[25:25] lord you'll
[25:26] read the you'll yield the reward of the
[25:28] inheritance the bible says
[25:30] that's a let's just it's kind of a new
[25:32] one as far as understanding that one
[25:35] so see whatever you do harder that's why
[25:37] i want to encourage our mothers just
[25:38] keep loving your children
[25:40] do it love your children like serve your
[25:42] children like you'd serve jesus
[25:44] and us husbands let's serve our wives
[25:46] and our children and our grandchildren
[25:47] like jesus
[25:48] like we're serving jesus because that
[25:50] will yield your reward
[25:52] of an inheritance that's colossians 3
[25:55] 23-24 diligently seeking god
[25:59] yields rewards
[26:02] got a couple more enduring temptation
[26:05] yields the crown of eternal life
[26:07] james 1 12. visiting the fatherless and
[26:10] widows
[26:11] keeping oneself unspotted from the world
[26:13] yields the reward of spiritual purity
[26:18] so church if you know somebody who
[26:19] doesn't have a dad let me know we can
[26:22] visit them and help them out
[26:23] that's real religion especially when
[26:26] they're affliction the bible says
[26:30] and last overcoming during any of the
[26:33] seven church aces
[26:35] ages yields the reward of inheriting all
[26:38] things in the church ages
[26:40] such as the tree of life you're eating
[26:42] from the tree of life
[26:43] escaping the second death eating the
[26:45] hidden manna a white stone with a new
[26:47] name within
[26:48] power to rule over nations the morning
[26:51] star white raiment having your name
[26:53] written in the book of life
[26:54] being a pillar of the temple of god
[26:56] having jesus's new name
[26:58] having god's new name having new
[27:00] jerusalem's new name written upon you
[27:02] and sitting with jesus in his throne
[27:05] sounds like some mighty rewards to me
[27:07] praise god
[27:08] just for living a christian holy life
[27:09] amen god help us to obtain those amen
[27:14] and the whole time we get to partner
[27:16] with other people doing it so see church
[27:17] you aren't alone
[27:19] i mean you don't have to do this all by
[27:21] yourself you can partner you can say
[27:23] brother william can you go with me to do
[27:24] donate this or can you go with me to go
[27:26] help the
[27:26] jose can you go pray with me with
[27:28] somebody we can do that
[27:30] we don't have to do it alone we can do
[27:32] it together praise god
[27:34] because we're partners in the gospel
[27:37] church you're not alone praise god
[27:39] you're not alone
[27:40] how many know jesus is with you praise
[27:42] god
[27:44] absolutely now let's look at the
[27:47] consequences here
[27:48] and i want to end with a little more on
[27:50] the lukewarmness we looked at that
[27:52] sunday night i started studying that
[27:54] just real briefly
[27:56] and i was shocked brother ram never said
[27:57] he was lukewarm
[27:59] brother i've never said a holy
[28:01] ghost-filled christian is lukewarm
[28:03] it was always the sinners so church you
[28:06] ain't lukewarm if you're born again
[28:08] you're not lukewarm
[28:09] impossible you might feel tired we'll
[28:12] get more sleep or eat better food praise
[28:14] god
[28:15] right right or you might be
[28:18] weary or worn out well give your mind to
[28:21] rest
[28:21] right study the word more pray more
[28:24] right
[28:25] go to somebody for encouragement we just
[28:27] said right try find a way to think the
[28:29] thoughts of god
[28:31] limit your time on other things and put
[28:33] more time on the word of god
[28:36] very simple good in good out
[28:39] holiness in holiness out praise god
[28:43] feed the white dog yeah very simple
[28:46] how many can say amen very simple amen
[28:49] okay consequences of rejecting the
[28:52] revelation i find at least three in the
[28:54] bible
[28:55] first is prideful discrimination which
[28:58] we've already preached on that one quite
[28:59] extensively
[29:01] cursing the blessed that's another
[29:04] consequence if you reject this
[29:05] revelation
[29:06] and the third is complacency that's the
[29:08] one where we've got to watch out for
[29:09] that
[29:10] paul said so i'm not it's not just me
[29:12] paul said that
[29:14] so let's go let's start with the first
[29:15] one we know peter pridefully
[29:18] discriminated against the gentiles he
[29:20] thought
[29:20] they were unclean he was to be blamed
[29:23] that means
[29:23] to find fault with or condemn so he was
[29:27] temporarily condemned not eternally
[29:31] and the church said not permanently
[29:34] condemned oh i made one mistake
[29:36] everybody's going to think less of me
[29:37] well that's that mean people might think
[29:39] lest you but a real christian will think
[29:41] more of you if you make it right
[29:43] brother brahm said people thought more
[29:44] of him when he confessed his sins to
[29:46] them
[29:47] praise god see because most people hide
[29:50] their sin
[29:52] hallelujah most people are high but if
[29:55] we humble ourselves
[29:56] and confess our sin to someone that we
[29:58] sinned against them
[29:59] those people think more of us
[30:03] so peter was temporarily in fault he was
[30:07] temporarily
[30:08] condemned but god knew this and god said
[30:11] i'll send somebody
[30:13] with the holy ghost to correct them and
[30:15] it wasn't very it wasn't privately it
[30:16] was publicly
[30:18] in the midst of all the brethren peter
[30:20] come up and rebuke him
[30:22] but we know that he must have got right
[30:25] with the lord praise god
[30:26] so see church we must not be like that
[30:28] and think we're more
[30:30] holy than other groups that have the
[30:32] holy ghost now
[30:34] see did those gentiles have the holy
[30:37] ghost yes
[30:38] did peter have the holy ghost yes but he
[30:40] thought well these holy ghost people
[30:41] i'm still i'm still bringing up their
[30:43] past their past still makes them unclean
[30:45] and god had already said don't call
[30:46] unclean when i've cleansed praise god
[30:50] so see if someone's got the holy ghost
[30:51] they're just as clean as you
[30:53] they're just as saved as you they're
[30:54] just as filled with the holy ghost as
[30:56] you
[30:56] show them some fellowship now unless
[30:58] they're sinning right show them some
[31:00] a partnership partner with them in the
[31:02] gospel don't separate yourself
[31:04] last one not having the holy spirit
[31:06] unite with those people be a help to
[31:08] them have fellowship with them
[31:11] uh pull up jude 1 9 there sister
[31:14] sister 12 year old sister jude 1 19. i'm
[31:18] sorry jude 1 19.
[31:23] so one consequence is when people
[31:26] separate themselves from us
[31:27] sometimes it proves they just weren't
[31:29] born again
[31:30] that's what i like when you guys hang
[31:32] around for a long time that proves
[31:33] you're born again
[31:36] i like seeing you you all come so much i
[31:39] proved you're born again
[31:40] see these were they who separate
[31:41] themselves sensual not having the holy
[31:44] spirit
[31:44] see one proof you're born again is that
[31:47] you don't separate yourself and live in
[31:48] your sin and live in your lust
[31:50] but you come to the house of god you
[31:52] meet with other christians
[31:53] because you know there's a holy fire
[31:55] there you know there's cleansing there
[31:56] there's washing there
[31:58] there's forgiveness there there's
[32:00] fellowship there that's what god loves
[32:02] god loves unity
[32:03] not division and people that leave this
[32:05] church if it's under the wrong terms
[32:07] it proves they're not born again but
[32:09] people that stay here that proves you've
[32:11] got god's spirit amen that's what the
[32:14] bible said not me
[32:16] same thing in uh you know hebrews 10 24
[32:18] gather more as you see that day
[32:20] approaching
[32:21] the only people some of these people
[32:22] gather with are their unsaved family
[32:24] members
[32:25] that's the people they gather more with
[32:26] instead of saints now you tell me
[32:28] they're born again
[32:29] nonsense the people that gather together
[32:32] more with saints those are the people
[32:34] that are born again they've got the holy
[32:36] spirit why
[32:37] because they're able to lay aside
[32:39] confess all their sins
[32:40] and leave their homes and come together
[32:43] under one purpose one banner
[32:45] one fellowship one goal and that's to
[32:47] magnify jesus christ
[32:49] and watch him pray watch till he comes
[32:51] and meets us in the air praise god
[32:54] amen so
[32:58] we're not going to pridefully
[32:59] discriminate from other saints that have
[33:00] the holy ghost
[33:05] and we went through that now
[33:08] the second consequence is cursing the
[33:12] blessed
[33:13] you might be surprised but there's a lot
[33:15] of people that curse other message
[33:16] people
[33:18] we've seen it right we've seen a sister
[33:20] they'll curse other message people that
[33:21] shows these people are blind
[33:24] right they're just blind i don't know if
[33:27] they're saved or lost but
[33:29] cursing the blessed is a sin
[33:32] because you cannot curse what god has
[33:35] blessed
[33:36] see a lot of some gentiles think israel
[33:38] is forever cursed
[33:39] and so they condemn all the jews in
[33:41] their angry hearts
[33:43] for crucifying their own messiah
[33:47] do you know do you know martin luther
[33:48] did that i was studying on martin luther
[33:51] out of those history books
[33:52] martin luther called the jews listen a
[33:55] satan's brood
[33:58] what's a brood like a brood of vipers
[33:59] right martin luther said the jews
[34:02] were a serpent's brood he's calling them
[34:06] devils because they they rejected christ
[34:10] and you know church some of his writings
[34:12] caused his followers to go burn their
[34:14] synagogues did you know that
[34:17] look at i got the book it's broadband do
[34:20] you know that
[34:20] his writings were so harsh against jews
[34:23] that they burnt down jewish synagogues
[34:25] in the name of christ
[34:26] now church that shows that that shows
[34:28] they didn't have all the revelation we
[34:30] have today
[34:33] luther says they're serpents god says
[34:35] they're just blinded
[34:37] they're just blind like like joseph's
[34:40] blinded brothers
[34:42] that's what now martin luther was a
[34:43] mighty man of god he had nine all nine
[34:44] gifts of the holy ghost
[34:46] he wrote some of the most beautiful
[34:47] writings on justification
[34:49] to this day he wrote 95 theses against
[34:52] the roman catholic church
[34:53] i mean he laid it all out all the things
[34:55] they were guilty of he was last time you
[34:57] counted all their heirs you know
[34:58] 95 heirs he was a man
[35:02] of god but in this area he was blinded
[35:04] and he basically cursed
[35:06] those who god had blessed because
[35:08] they're still under the mosaic
[35:10] and abrahamic covenants amen and god
[35:12] cannot forget
[35:14] one promised word of his word amen he
[35:17] will not let one word fall to the ground
[35:19] because our god is faithful amen he
[35:21] never forgets his promises amen
[35:24] amen yep martin luther church here's
[35:27] what happened
[35:27] pull up second timothy 2 26 second
[35:29] timothy 2 26.
[35:32] i appreciate you doing that with all
[35:33] that busyness on your laughter
[35:36] second timothy 2 26
[35:39] he must have been caught in the snare of
[35:41] the enemy
[35:43] in other words complex can i just say
[35:45] like that
[35:48] and they that may recover themselves out
[35:50] of the snare remember some talk about
[35:52] snares of the devil who are taken
[35:53] captive by him at his will
[35:56] so anytime we get a complex against
[35:58] somebody mistreat them and we're
[35:59] we're mean to them we're dirty to them
[36:01] or whatever anger towards them we
[36:03] shouldn't be
[36:04] we've fallen into a trap of the enemy
[36:06] and we got to say
[36:07] we got to pray to god and say god give
[36:09] me victory i'm caught in this snare
[36:11] i'm trapped and i can't get out i need
[36:13] your help now church that's the kind of
[36:15] prayer that god will respond to
[36:17] when israel was by the red sea they said
[36:19] we are in this trap we can't get out
[36:21] what did god do he part of the waters
[36:23] amen
[36:24] god always makes a way if you want to be
[36:26] free if you and i want to be free of any
[36:29] any trouble we just got to call on the
[36:31] lord admit we're failures
[36:32] confess any sins and god will bring us
[36:35] out of the snare praise god
[36:36] then we'll be free in jesus name
[36:44] hallelujah i love god's grace
[36:48] he called him a serpent's brood see what
[36:51] happened church
[36:52] martin luther got a little root of
[36:53] bitterness he saw those jews they
[36:56] despised jesus
[36:57] they probably mistreated the christians
[36:58] in his day i don't know
[37:01] but he led a little root of bitterness
[37:03] he got the wrong seed in there he got to
[37:04] see the discrepancy
[37:06] right just a small one right and and
[37:09] just in his human spirit not in his soul
[37:10] in his human spirit and we got to be
[37:12] careful who we curse right
[37:15] that's why i will just keep praying for
[37:16] anybody even if they blaspheme
[37:18] i'll keep praying for them until i would
[37:20] feel god say don't pray for them
[37:22] because i was guilty of blasphemy at one
[37:24] time and god had mercy on me
[37:26] praise god amen and paul blaspheme but
[37:30] god had mercy on him praise god
[37:33] i guess i'm just on the mercy of god's
[37:35] side
[37:36] until god would give me some other
[37:37] revelation
[37:40] now the last one before i close here let
[37:42] me give me 15 minutes here i'll try to
[37:44] close at eight and we'll see
[37:49] the last is the one that we battle
[37:51] complacency
[37:54] now church get your bibles go to romans
[37:55] 11 18.
[37:58] this was such a beautiful thought the
[38:00] holy spirit brought to me i believe
[38:01] romans 11 18. did you ever catch this
[38:06] paul warns the christians you know
[38:09] you've got
[38:09] you've got grace but if you don't take
[38:11] care of that revelation
[38:13] you're going to become prideful and
[38:15] complacent and then god will cut you off
[38:18] so see but if you don't take advantage
[38:20] of it you become complacent and
[38:22] it's as if you've rejected the
[38:24] revelation
[38:25] because you're not taking advantage of
[38:27] the revelation
[38:31] folks not see brag not against the
[38:33] branches
[38:34] don't brag against the jews right don't
[38:36] don't brag over the jews but if thou
[38:38] boast i'll bear us not the root but the
[38:40] root thee
[38:40] next verse that will say then the
[38:44] branches were broken off that i might be
[38:45] wrapped in that's true verse 20.
[38:48] well because of unbelief they're broken
[38:50] off and now standeth by faith
[38:51] be not high-minded but fear
[38:55] so the very fact that you know god has
[38:56] turned to the gentiles
[38:58] and he's blinded most of the jews that
[39:00] can make someone prideful
[39:02] that could make them high-minded like oh
[39:04] god's with us now
[39:06] we're so much better than them next
[39:08] verse
[39:11] we really got to watch our attitudes and
[39:13] take advantage of this this message that
[39:14] we have
[39:15] for god's spare not the natural branches
[39:19] he
[39:19] also spare not thee see church
[39:23] now is just leave that up there isn't
[39:25] that interesting brother adam says
[39:26] the main thing a christian needs is rest
[39:28] remember that brother hebrew series
[39:31] right how many are arresting your
[39:33] salvation in christ jesus tonight
[39:36] so our soul rests but in our minds we've
[39:39] got to be
[39:39] sharp and say i can't let this slip i've
[39:42] got to be about my father's business see
[39:45] so in other words at the same time i got
[39:46] to be resting that i'm saved wrestling
[39:48] that i'm filled with the holy ghost
[39:49] but in my mind i got to be thinking lord
[39:51] help me to be faithful
[39:52] help me be diligent help me to take
[39:54] advantage of this opportunity help me
[39:56] not to waste a moment praise god
[40:00] not that i'm going to be lost but here
[40:02] he says take heed
[40:04] let's not he spare thee also
[40:07] so in other words be humble keep in mind
[40:10] god can do without you god don't have to
[40:12] have you and me
[40:13] i don't have to have a church in actor
[40:15] he can just wipe us off the map he can
[40:16] do whatever he wants he can take us all
[40:17] to heaven whatever
[40:18] whatever wants to do let us not be
[40:21] prideful
[40:22] let's be humble let us partner with
[40:24] other people whether it's lot
[40:26] right or another abraham or the seed of
[40:30] abraham
[40:31] let us have that revelation and be
[40:33] thankful for what god has given to us
[40:35] and make the most of this opportunity
[40:37] because we all have these same
[40:39] opportunities
[40:40] to earn these rewards
[40:45] that's why you're in church tonight
[40:46] right is that why your church tonight
[40:49] you don't want to miss out on any
[40:50] opportunity to hear god speak to you
[40:53] that's why i'm in church tonight see
[40:57] go get prideful and don't get complacent
[41:00] recognize the mind has to be
[41:02] renewed every day be renewed in the
[41:05] spirit of your mind
[41:07] daily paul said be renewed daily by the
[41:09] renewing of the holy ghost
[41:12] so it's such a paradox brother we are
[41:14] resting in here i'm
[41:16] i'm saved i'm on my way to heaven i'm on
[41:19] my way to
[41:20] heaven i'm shouting victory
[41:23] but up here we're like oh lord help me
[41:25] not to miss a moment
[41:28] right help me have to miss this
[41:30] opportunity today it could be the day
[41:31] i witnessed somebody and somebody come
[41:33] to church because i witnessed him that's
[41:34] what happened to me for the m.j
[41:36] today could be the day i don't want to
[41:38] miss it
[41:39] i want to be ready to give an answer for
[41:41] the hope that i have within me praise
[41:43] god
[41:44] always want to be ready somebody needs
[41:47] me to pray if i get an email
[41:49] i get a lot of them but if i can email
[41:51] ask for a prayer god help me to pray a
[41:52] sincere prayer
[41:54] tell me not to just delete it or help me
[41:55] not to say well somebody else will pray
[41:57] for
[41:57] help me to humble myself help me to make
[41:59] the most of this opportunity because i
[42:00] might get an email later saying god
[42:02] heard the prayer
[42:04] amen i'm just making it real for us
[42:07] right i'm just trying to make it real to
[42:08] see
[42:08] how these things all these are spiritual
[42:10] principles and laws that are true
[42:12] and god honors his word amen
[42:16] see church we're tempted we're tempted
[42:18] by the enemy to boast or brag because
[42:20] we've got grace
[42:23] but we must continue in the goodness or
[42:25] else we'll be cut off due to complacency
[42:30] and remember this complacency is the
[42:31] same condition of lukewarmness
[42:34] falling upon the gentile churches in the
[42:36] last days
[42:38] according to the letter to the
[42:39] laodiceans church we must constantly
[42:42] keep the spirit of revival
[42:45] revive means to bring back from the dead
[42:48] your soul can never be dead anymore if
[42:50] it's got eternal life amen
[42:51] your soul can never die praise god but
[42:54] your mind
[42:55] your mind has thoughts that die right
[42:57] yeah your good thoughts are all
[42:58] dead and all you where where'd they go
[43:01] where'd all your good thoughts and good
[43:03] feelings and
[43:03] all those good feelings from sunday
[43:04] where'd they go well they got to be
[43:06] renewed
[43:08] that's where we die in our minds right
[43:10] our good
[43:11] anointing leaves so we need a fresh
[43:14] anointing we need a revived mind amen
[43:18] praise god
[43:22] we need our thoughts revived is what we
[43:24] need
[43:26] not your soul your body doesn't need
[43:28] revive you're alive thank god you're in
[43:30] the land of the living praise god
[43:31] it's your mind that needs revived
[43:34] because your soul
[43:35] is already at rest amen your soul
[43:37] already has eternal life
[43:39] it's sealed it's marked to the day of
[43:40] redemption amen
[43:42] you're born from heaven it's the
[43:44] incorruptible seed of god
[43:46] it's birth inside of you it's growing
[43:48] but ram said it starts like the size of
[43:50] a button
[43:50] and it keeps getting bigger and bigger
[43:52] that anointing keeps growing
[43:54] praise god god's life is in you that's
[43:56] not where you're dead you're dead in
[43:58] your thoughts
[44:03] we get complacent in our thinking our
[44:06] words
[44:08] so we must realize i need revival today
[44:10] and i'm going to hunger and thirst
[44:12] for god's righteousness remember church
[44:14] you should be living a
[44:16] more holy life all the time okay shall
[44:18] put up second corinthians 7 1. this is
[44:20] one of my favorite scriptures in the
[44:21] whole bible
[44:22] and this is the one where all the
[44:23] denominations fail right
[44:26] where they many of them give you a
[44:27] license to sin but not the word of god
[44:31] the word of god said having these
[44:32] promises dearly beloved
[44:34] cleanse ourselves from some
[44:38] he got it all filthiness of the flesh
[44:41] and spirit
[44:42] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[44:46] church when you meet a saint like
[44:47] william or beatrice you know they've
[44:49] been the messages jose

[44:56] at least you should if you're born again
[44:57] right
[44:59] see you're you should enjoy hope you
[45:00] should enjoy holiness more
[45:02] you should enjoy serving god more yeah
[45:04] you're gonna have battles but your
[45:05] desire is to get all the filthiness out
[45:07] of me
[45:08] get all the evil out of me and god help
[45:10] me to perfect holiness help me to be a
[45:12] christian that's
[45:13] completely holy completely yielded to
[45:15] you that you can do your will in my life

[45:35] the mark of the high calling in christ
[45:37] jesus

[45:39] god's word and be washed in those hot
[45:42] waters
[45:43] and the soap the fuller soap amen of the
[45:45] holy ghost praise god
