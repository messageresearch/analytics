let's think about those words here let's just sing that first verse as we stand and enter into the preaching of the word here what a friend [Music] oh that last verse are we weak and happy like [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] take Gracie let's take our Bibles this evening let's go back to proverbs 31 I imagine I'm just feeling led there to go that direction finish up there by the grace of the Lord Robert chapter 31 I start at verse 13 let's continue with this thought of the proverbs 31 woman proverbs 31 verse 13 for their say Amen verse 13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she's like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar she Rises also wild as yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she considers a field and buy a fit with the fruit of her hand she planted the vineyard she girder loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she perceived as her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy amen that's the portion I'm hoping to get through tonight by God's grace let's have our heads for a word of Prayer if you have need on your hearts make it on into God here tonight as we approach communion Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands Lord my hands up to Lord God we're so grateful for your presence and for your word we're grateful for every soul that's gathered here to hear the Word of God Lord we know your prophet teaches Lord that communion is a showdown Lord and we know those saints who have gathered Lord they consider it a showdown Lord they want to be right with you they want to be examined according to thy word Lord they want to be clean in thy sight Lord God and I pray you'd bless them Lord that's your spirit Lord minister to them Lord God we're grateful that you're our friend that you chose us to be your friend not only your friend but your spouse Lord what a privilege what an honor Lord we don't take it lightly Lord God we come here Lord soberly in the fear of God we ask that you speak to us here tonight bless every heart and soul gathered Lord in our mit's Lord and father may we feel your presence in Jesus Christ name everybody said amen god bless you being seated praise the Lord so let's look at this is part three of the proverbs 31 woman here and like I said we'll try to go as far as we can with this thought here by the grace of the Lord you know I'm polling from numerous commentaries here and just to kind of give us some context to the background you know the economic background of Israel so I think it'll it'll help you up by the grace of the Lord so well we did our text from this morn that was this morning's text was the two foundations of a proverbs 31 woman she fears the Lord first she has a great hatred for evil and she departs from evil and then after that she only does good to her husband all the days of her life now as we begin this section like I said I'm only trying to get to verse 20 tonight but it goes all the way to 27 we see the freedom a godly woman has of exercising her gifts within these two boundaries so she has to fear the Lord and then she has to do good to her husband all the days of her life and within these we'd say bookends she has much freedom to exercise her gifts that God has given her and remember that just to encourage all of our sisters but also everyone this whole chapter is about the scope or potential or growth over time so we want to keep that in mind here and remember this kind of woman is rare so for a woman to accomplish this in an entire life would be a very rare thing amen but this is what we should strive for while honoring our to life boundaries right fearing God and then doing good to your husband all the days of his life this is what our sisters should strive for and I believe we can see the spiritual aspect of it as well so again potential or growth over time how many can see growth over time in their lives maybe things you couldn't do when you were younger you know I thought I could never do that you know I don't know how I could ever handle that but yet God has given you the grace to handle it the grace to do things you never thought you were possible before I never thought it'd be possible to song lead preach be deacon trustee treasurer pastor Sunday school teacher I never thought I could do all that so I know God and be a husband and a father to six children I never thought I could do that so and teach as well so I never thought that was possible but God keeps expanding our boundaries and we by wisdom try to balance everything let's look at verse 13 and 14 like I said we'll just go verse by verse and I set my timer and a half-hour cuz if I can do a half-hour and feel pretty good and you'd all be shocked but but we're gonna try to do it by God's grace I really want to wear myself back I can't I got I got like I went to bed at like 3 a.m. last Sunday you know because of the the rain and everything and I've just been worn out all week so I really got to have wisdom proverbs 31 13 now she seeketh wool flax and works willingly with her hands now it doesn't say she's she is a merchant ship but she's like a merchant ship ok and she bringeth her food from afar so she seeks out wool flax to work with her hands now if you know the scripture and Deuteronomy flax is used to make linen and of course linen makes garments really nice clothes you know like the Bible said clean and white linen garments would have been the highest quality of garments you could have especially clean and white but we know purple would have been very valuable as well it's hard to get purple garments but we know white represents purity righteousness right and she acts like a merchant right because not all women could operate a business or God's not calling all women to be entrepreneurs of their own business God's not doing that but she acts like that this proverbs 31 woman like she takes upon the responsibility of a business in a way and she like here's Adam Clarke says she acts like merchants which is if she buys anything for a household she sells sufficient of her own manufacturers to pay for it in other words she's going to be able to afford everything she buys and we saw that this morning to her husband can trust her with the resources that he's given to her and Christ can trust you and I with the word aim ahead oh there yeah so in this case if she imports things I'm sorry in ports things and she also exports so it's gonna work both ways she's gonna be diligent with her with her giving and taking and then she sends articles of her own manufacturing or produce to distant countries so she's able to sell to others so she's producing things if she needs something she's able to get it and she pays for by what she produces remember this is this is a potential now a woman can grow to this and she can be very prosperous with natural things and then she traffic's with neighboring tribes or communities so let's so far that's quite a trying to look at a woman now so so far let's just build what we talked about this morning so she's faithful with resources and trustworthy to her husband his remember she does good to her husband she tries to do something good to help her husband's vision right that's why she does this that's why she would try to make a profit or or try to have a good business she would do that for the good of her husband and in this case like we seen in verse 13 she takes initiative the Bible said she seeks it out she's not waiting for this to happen she realizes well if I'm gonna be a blessing here to my husband I've got to take initiative right brother Branham says there's a proverb that says God only helps those who help themselves in romance that's a bad proverb that's not a good proverb brother have said god only helps those who cannot help themselves so this woman here she can help herself and she knows this business venture here falls under the permission of her husband the the wisdom of her husband the the vision of her husband and so snowing she gets permission from her husband she's able to bring in wool and flax and and make some linen here some clothes and then she knows if she orders something from afar she know she can pay for it amen and then she's able you know to produce maybe something sells something she's able to cover it to cover the costs and she buys and sells wisely like a merchant amen I know about all the brothers but my wife's much better financially than I am so I can say amen to that you know much better by with buying and selling and we'll see that later on it's gonna come later on in verse 16 but let's look at verse 15 she rises also wild as yet night and she giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens so she rises from bed early and during the night how many brothers get to sleep while your wife has to get up and help the six children at night that's me I usually sleep and my wife gets up and helps or if they have an accident or you know somebody's sick at night or something like that who rises at night my wife does most the time unless I'm already up and now in this case we would say for our natural language she packs the lunch she prepares for the day she's an economist of time and when the nights are long the days are short her family not only spent a part of the evening after sunset after the after the Sun Goes Down they they labor around the home they also rise before daylight and prepare the day's food that they may not have their labor interrupted so if you know they had they were agricultural society so the workers had to go out to the fields well if the mother or the the wife didn't rise and repair the food then they'd have to come back in from the fields right it kind of wastes some time but if she can prepare their meals beforehand that would make the most efficient use of the day the hours of the day and so this is the kind of a woman she she wanted to really be efficient with time so she'd rise earlier late to prepare meat for her her workers remember this is special kind of woman she's got servants or lots of children that go do a lot of work for I can see how can't you see how that the mother of a king would give her son this wisdom you know if your wife's in charge of all these servants or all these you know all these children and they go work out in the fields see how this is see how this is a a verse for scope you know a long term and even even cultural for the culture of a queen right the wife of a king who would have servants who would have the servants go out into the field and they work all day so see we have to consider this this is a rare woman and she's in an interesting situation may be a situation you and I can't relate to we don't have any servants at our house I don't know about you we don't have any paid servants or anybody that lives with us or they're indebted to us so they have to do all of our work for us we're not in that society but the point is and this is a point later coming later on if she is the wife of a king she doesn't have to do all this work but she chooses to do it to make sure it's done right she could easily sit back and say oh that's somebody else do that because she's the she's the wife of a king she's got servants she well let another servant you know let a householder do that let somebody else do it but she is right there active in the home and in in all the affairs of the home to make sure it goes right she doesn't sit back and take the easy road she's not lazy she's right there working to make sure everything goes in order amen so she gives their necessary food she knows they're gonna be out there laboring so she wants to provide for them make sure they're well taken care of my mom always packed lunch for me you know and all my brothers in high school so we'd have six brown paper bags fill with food until we got to a big where she couldn't afford the food for all of us then we started getting free lunches because we were so poor but always on the bottom so you take a big purple I can still see to this day a big purple permanent marker and say I love you son she write it on the back and I just one way to remind me of this you know and all my friends would make fun of me and I try to you know hide that or you're a great son Jesse you know hug the bottom of um but with six kids you were tried to you know make the the food go as far as it could go and I look back now I thought what a sweet mom I didn't like and then but I like it now so now when I see my children you know in school at the table and I see they get letters from their parents I said you need to thank your mom for that little you know they write on the napkin hope you have a great day love ya you know I'm thinking about you I think oh what a sweet what a sweet mom and so this is kind of what we see the proverbs 31 woman she gets up a little early to make sure everybody in the house is fed I like that because she cares they met there's another thought he gives to the women who are to be employed within the house she gives tasks to so they have tasks you can see that they're a portion you see that with portions here and the kind of work they're to do the materials out of which they are to form it and the quantity she expects from each that's the portion so yet meet and then you had portions so Adam Clark is pulling on this portion word as not necessarily food but but your job for the day the portion of your work thus all the servants are settled so here she's got servants and their food work and tasks are appointed everything is done orderly in other words every every member of the household has what they need to do their job for the day now see we we you know we got to realize how humble this proverbs 31 woman is she just staying in her place she fears God so much she she wants all the evil out of her home and she loves her husband so much that she knows the best things you can do is keep her house in order that everybody do their job too keep our home moving in the right direction so sometimes you know like as we're gonna see her scope can go really really big like with buying things and being an entrepreneur we're gonna see her scope you know really big but we can't also neglect these little things because we know we can be faithful in these little things we know we've got to be and we might not be at the spot where we can look at a field and go buy it yeah we're gonna get to that next we might not be at that spot for our sisters or you know whoever this as you apply it to yourself but what we see as a job we can do today let's be faithful with that amen so now we add to our list so now she serves her family at all hours aren't you glad for the mothers who serve at all hours I remember many times laying on the couch I was sick and my mom would bring me a wet washcloth because I was so hot burning up with fever and she just laid on my forehead and I was just crying I'm feeling so sick but if that's all she did but it meant so much to me you know growing up because everybody else was sleeping but my mom stayed up to help me out rising and I am getting me now she would she would water down spry and she said that this will make you better I don't think it was a very good medicine but that was there that was how she was raised oh you're sick just water down some sprite and drink some high-fructose corn syrup you know you know she just did the best she could now no doubt many of her things she did help me out she got the medicine and but the point is she was up with me late at night my dad wasn't you know my mom was you know so thank God for a faithful mother and as we saw she plans and prepares the work so that it's not interrupted so whatever they can accomplish that day it's the most wise use wisely as the most wise use of their time their time is not wasted in other words all right let's read verse 16 and 17 what a picture what a picture of a proverbs 31 woman here's where ever see this might be later on in life because I don't think I've ever done this but here a woman has the ability within fearing God and loving her husband too right now here do some entrepreneurial work here verse 16 she considers a field so she's watching the prices this kind of reminds me of sister Karen how she was watching the prices of our church buildings she's watching she's considering why what if the church could go here go there I appreciate that she considers a field you know she's planning ahead and buys it and with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard let's just slow down a little bit she was thinking about this field I might need this feel like we need some more food we need we're gonna need some more crops I may consider you know husband what do you think I may consider buying that field well who's gonna work it honey I am I'm gonna work this field I'm gonna go work out in the hot Sun and I'm gonna break up the fallow grounds right and I'm gonna plant and this is gonna bring forth a harvest bring forth fruit who's gonna do it you're I'm gonna do it so see this is a woman in a special stage of life how many sisters think like you could go do that tomorrow buy a field and go till the till up the land anybody feel like doing that any of the sisters out there sure I love to break out the hoe and the rakes and let's get this let's level this ground off you know this is the embodiment of wisdom and I like how in the next one I like these next thoughts look at these thoughts here I'm sorry I never read 17 she guards her loins with strength so remember to gird their loins was to be ready to work so she make you just her skirts there she's ready to work and then she strengthens her arms so you get the picture of that you know she's ready to work she considers a feeling for fruitfulness she's business mind and I like what Holman says it requires tremendous strength to earn the extra money to buy a vineyard and then clear of stones plant the vines dig a winepress and build a tower to protect it I mean this was not a small endeavor this was going to be a labor of love this was going to be a long-term cause when you plant if this is a vineyard like with grapes this is going to be years in the making so if you're in that phase of life God could lead you to do that and I like the next thought like what Adam Clarke says she provides for the growing wants of her family she realizes we are going to outgrow our garden pretty soon we need some more food so more land will shortly be needed for the family's growing up and having seen a field contiguous to her own which was on sale she estimates it's worse as members she considers it how much is this worth how much fruit can it yield me and purchase it of a good bargain and she pays for by the fruit of her own industry well darling how do you plan to pay for this well I bet I've had some other business ventures here I know in a few years when we get the we sell the fruits and then we'll have enough money to pay this off I'll take out a loan and and this will be so fruitful to have so much money here each month we'll be able to pay it off my what a striking look at a proverbs 31 woman so now we see she's been business-minded she foresees prosperity oh I can make a profit here and I'm going to need to make a profit here in order to provide for my family and she does all this with the guidance of course an approval of her husband she does this for the good of her husband because member the Bible says really those arrows are in his quiver you understand like the husband's responsible for the children's ever to understand he's the head of the home now of course she pours into them you know the why but the Bible said they're his arrows so these children are gonna reflect the leadership God gives to the man so she does this for his children now to no doubt they're her children too but God places the father above them and so she she's healthy and physically fit she's hurting up her loins she's ready - right right go out there and pull some stones out of the ground strengthens her arms you know she's gonna be right there so see this is it's gonna be for 85 year-old woman so see this yet that we have to understand this and not be overwhelmed like oh I've got to do this right now if I don't do this I'm not the proverbs 31 woman we've got to look at this as growth over time this is times and seasoned God's makes all things beautiful in his time we must not let it overwhelm us but see what God may be leading us to do remember God looks at the beauty of one life he he looks at all the seasons of life and he wants to express his beauty in each stage of life well I've got young children the home this is the time I've got to get up early or I've got to be willing to stay up late in the night and as they get older then you can move into different phase of your life and each phase has a particular glory each season has a particular Glee for your life amen I'm not gonna ask the sisters to raise their hands over the brothers but how many of you can see some of these in your life already come to pass you've already stepped into some of these this is what Christ this is the embodiment of wisdom not sitting back and waiting for something good to happen come on lord knew something for me bless me Lord bless me but using the wisdom the Lord's given you and the gifts God's given you to help solve the problems of life amen now some free I listened to a sermon from a I think he was a Presbyterian preacher I was just over this I've been listening to sermons for weeks on the book of Proverbs you know I've gone through every time brother Branham said the word proverb I've gone through every one of those but I listened to one sermon in particular and he has different you know insights which you know some of these might some of these might work you know like he looks at verse 13 where she works with her hands he says well she has joy and work which I could see that you know but we ought out we ought to have joy in our work because we work as into the Lord not unto man I enjoy going to school I enjoy seeing the children and learn I enjoy helping them you know have better behavior you know I love Joy's helping them learn math and learn how to read and comprehend I I enjoy those things we should have joy and I'll work now verse 14 is a little interesting I never looked at like this but the one preacher said she is very creative a proverbs 31 woman is very creative bringing food from afar she brings variety or freshness to life I thought that was interesting because she brings things from out of the country into the country and you wouldn't have these unless you exported them I'm sorry imported them and I thought that would written that's really interesting you know life would be dull without her she brings things that would really wouldn't be there all the time she brings life into the dullness of life and I like this he said men can build a house but a woman builds the home in other words the the love inside the home or the feeling of a home only a woman can do that she brings it in and I think I'll just give an example of my wife you know over and over in the fellowship room you know last year I had it had the tables laid out a different way and it was fine for me but my wife's like you know honey I'm just gonna rearrange those one time or I thought praise the Lord walked in there and and then now it's in the state is in and I love how it is now it was way better than the way I had it and I just thought my that's just given her that creativity and something and now it feels like a fellowship room to me I don't know maybe you don't feel that way but that's how I feel I feel just real nice and comfortable that room because it's got a woman's touch you know and I still told my wife I said at some point you know when we got the funds for the church I want to have her other sisters who like just to decorate the church I did all the decoration you know I just I don't know I feel like the girls could the sisters could do better you know but I just saw those signs you know family and prayer and Jesus I thought my wife might have seen those actually but you know I'm talking about the touch that a sister has amen just her her she makes it feel like a place you want to be amen and then you know the preacher was mentioning how she's disciplined she's physically strong and she's got a desire for enterprise you know for business and he you know he mentioned that in verses 15 through 17 and I thought those are some you know those are those different words we might use to describe some of the characteristics we're seeing that we already mentioned all right let's look at look at verse 18 here I like this here I like this she perceives that her merchandise is good and her candle goeth not out by night I like what Clark says he says she takes care to manufacture the best articles of the kind so whatever she manufactures it's going to be the best and to lay on a reasonable price that she may secure already sale her goods are in high repute and she knows she can sell as much as she can make and she finds that while she pleases her customers her and she increases her own profits I like that so she knows she's selling a good product and doesn't the church know that too we're selling the best thing there is the word of God the message of the hour amen because it is the word it's the pure unadulterated Word of God I know there's not many buyers out there but I'm sure glad to sell it anyway and I'll wait until we find some buyers by the grace of the Lord but that's since she is business minded or in this stage of her life she wants the best products my dad always told me you get what you pay for son you don't buy something good it's not gonna be buy junk he says you're gonna get junk and that's been true my whole life no doubt about that and she her candle goeth not out by night she's watchful she's careful her lamp burns all night which is of great advantage in the case of sudden alarms can you imagine in those days without electricity we can just flip on a light but can you imagine them stumbling around in the dark for an oil lamp and then to get a match and light that I mean spilling potentially spilling oil fire you know that's not a good picture so she had to leave a light on somewhere all night and be ready we just can turn on a light or we I got my phone I just slide it up and turn on the flashlight I walk around and where's my where's my clothes for the day or what's going on here well she had to keep a light burning she was always ready always ready at any emergency to be up at Adam Wow and in times and places where there were so many bandits or robbers this was a very necessary family regulation perhaps some works were carried on during the night those employed sleeping in the daytime thus labor never stood still while some slept others worked this was no unusual thing in ancient times and it prevails now an especially church if you think about the queen of the King and they had a city right with walls you would have watchtowers and you had to have Watchmen that stayed awake all night so you had to be ready to help a watchman if they needed food or water whatever they needed she was even willing to help anyone who worked all through the night this is the kind of woman that God calls a virtuous woman in other words she cared about everybody in the kingdom if somebody needed something she'd get up even at nighttime I'll help out and again take into consideration this is a certain stage of life right you got to take that so I don't know I imagine that this stage she might be a little older cuz if she's younger she got a nurse the children you know take care of the children I'd imagine that so see she produces high quality merchandise how many appreciate a one products mother may have said if you do a product do a a one job so she was into a one products if she was gonna manufacture or send something out it's gonna be a high quality product she's not gonna send out junk to people and then she's prepared and alert all night or she's just prepared to help out anyone in the kingdom in this case our case anyone in the home she's able to help out verse 19 she lent her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff I like this this is an interesting thought - she has a burden to produce thread which is interesting so the spindle and distaff there's my half-hour so let me set it for ten more minutes I'll try to finish up 40 minutes that'd be a real victory uh are the most ancient of all instruments used for spinning or making thread so she goes back she's even she's so humble she'll go back and use the oldest technology she'll go back to the ancient ways she's willing to humble herself and do whatever's needed to help out the family should go use the oldest tools she's not so high and gray and and mightier than others that she can't go humble herself and put her hands on the old ways she's in touch with the old ways to give me that old-time religion i-ight with me cherish that look at the spiritual she's able to tap in to the old ways amen she's not high and lofty she don't need something new she can go work with the old tools I thought that was pretty neat the spinning wheel superseded them in the countries but they are still in considerable use to spinning machinery superseded both them and the spinning wheels in general so she was able to humble herself to the old ways listen if a job needs done even if I got to use the old the old tools I'll do it I got to make bread the old-fashioned way I'll make bread the old-fashioned way I've got to wash clothes the old-fashioned way I'll do that she was willing to fit in and do whatever was needed to help out the family I like that and I'm just looking I'm looking at the spiritual not just this word thread kind of went through my mind so just bear with me on this thought Rahab she already had a scarlet thread in her house and the scarlet thread once outside represent the token the baptism of the holy ghost so she was willing to put her hands to the old ways in order to bring about a thread in other words she was willing to work with the old-time religion and bring forth a character that would produce the token amen so I'm just trying to I'm really straighted on that one you understand I'm really reaching because that word thread was so striking to me and church is not just there it's in Song of Solomon Solomon says thy lips are like threads of scarlet so this this Holy Ghost religion this token religion was even on her lips she lets she spoke the Word of God all the time amen I just I'm stretching a little bit but you understand what I'm saying she had this thread she was willing to go the old path to produce this thread and this thread on a public display was the token amen in other words she was making preparations for the token the thread to be on display amen go back to the old-time ways to see again again she works with her hands now before it was working with other things with wool and linen and so forth like that but now she's again able to go work with the most ancient of tools she can herself to the most ancient of ways if she has to I like that now verse 20 this is where I ended my notes I may go a little bit further we'll see verse 20 she stretched out her hand to the poor she reaches forth her hands to the needy now I've mentioned this earlier but she stretched her hands to the poor needy she's laying up treasures in heaven as memorials of alms and maybe fasting we'd say because that's what the Bible said in acts 10 with Cornelius and when he looked on them he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said to him thy prayers this is the angel thy prayers and that alms are come up for a memorial before God I'm gonna preach a whole sermon on the poor in the book of Proverbs but the book of Proverbs is jam-packed with scriptures about the poor I mean you can't get through just a couple chapters it's always like God is for the poor you must help the poor you know the wicked oppress the poor and it's just it's all through the whole book and here at the very end the climax of what a wisdom produces we see a woman who's able to run a business here or be business minded produce and make a profit and she doesn't keep all this for herself she still remembers those less fortunate than her and she's able to reach out and say I couldn't help this one she reaches out with her hand right so someone someone that's close within her circle of influence or or her or her friends she's able to reach out and she reaches out to them let's ask to help us to reach out and help somebody this week or maybe this month how many want to reach out and help somebody she stretches forth her hand it's gonna take a little effort but it's worth it God has blessed me so much I'll stretch forth my hand he stretched forth his hand to me I'll stretch forth my hand at somebody else amen glory I like that and in doing that she stores up memorials in heaven treasures in heaven God will remember when you help the poor God will remember when you when you stretch forth your hand to others not just pulling into myself not just receiving receiving receiving but giving out to the poor God will remember that amen so now we see not only that but she takes initiative to help the poor and the needy now I got four more minutes so let me just I'll do the next one then I'll stop I'll just do the next one okay just verse 21 I was gonna go 21 to 25 as you can see I was gonna go to 25 but I'll just stop at 21 so let's just read 21 and then we'll have to stop there by the grace of the Lord and maokai go and switch off here okay because I'm going to I don't have any other quotes that was the only one I had I was gonna read them from my notes so proverbs 31 21 and I'm gonna read off my notes here I didn't have time to put him on slides today verse 21 she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household Arklow with scarlet now there's a couple of things we have to see in here and let me get there I'm not quite there yet okay here we go and this is what said American Christians bow the most is fear how many memory said that fear that God won't keep his word American Christians battle fears God going to provide is God gonna answer prayer is God gonna help me in the land of plenty we battle fear the most is God gonna help me out and that's striking Satan does that he turns it around so she does not fear so that means she's got faith she's got faith despite the snow for her household so she does not fear winter because she knows her house is clothed with scarlet now scarlet is at least a double-layered garment so these are warmer clothes so she has warmer double layered clothes for the wintertime not single layer but double layer and she has planned ahead and this is what we saw earlier remember we saw earlier how she Ponder's things and she's thinking about what's next she has planned ahead to make sure our children are warm in the cold seasons and they have everything that they need amen and I didn't have time to put that one up there but how many ever seen your wives are seen people plan ahead well we got to get ready for winter we got to get ready for spring time to get out the old get in the new right and this is the kind of woman that God was looking for a woman who would be ready for hard times and we can apply this for even spiritually right now sure we think naturally oh I've got I've got this bin of clothes for winter time I've got to get that out I got to start walking I know my wife does that all the time we got to wash these clothes because they sit in the bin all year round but how much more for the spiritual winters of our life right the church we say the woman she's ready for the hard times because she's with Christ all the way to the end amen she's received so much of his word so much of his love she's got the seal of Christ in her soul to the day of redemption she loves God on the mountaintops and she loves God in the valley it's based upon love it's based upon the fear of the Lord and she's ready the bride is ready for all seasons of life amen let's stand to our feet here I'll stop right there that was 45 minutes here in or 40 minutes that way I hopefully I don't hurt myself by trying to go so hard so so long and let's if you have your Bibles here let as we stand let's go to Luke 22 I just want to read this for my techs tonight for communion Luke 22 verse 13 I like to change text every now and then kind of back and forth you know from first Corinthians 11 let's go to Luke 22 tonight by the grace of the Lord Luke 22 13 now let's before we read us think about how this applies to our life are we faithful with our resources are we trustworthy do we take initiative do we buy and sell wisely are we willing to serve in any hour of the day are we planning and preparing to be most efficient in the work of the home and work of our lives are we forced seeing prosperity how we can be more prosperous are we healthy and physically fit to do it are we producing high quality merchandise are we prepared and alert are we willing to humble ourselves and work with the most oldest oldest tools we'd say are we taking initiative to help the poor with our surplus this is how we want to examine ourselves here tonight by God's grace Luke 22 verse 13 and they went and found as he said unto them and they made ready the Passover verse 14 when the hour was come he sat down in the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God can you imagine Jesus has had a 2000 years since he partook of communion there he's waiting until the marriage supper of the lamb and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it amongst yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of this vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took the bread and gave thanks and brake and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do and remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you amen may God has blessing the reading of his word but Laura
