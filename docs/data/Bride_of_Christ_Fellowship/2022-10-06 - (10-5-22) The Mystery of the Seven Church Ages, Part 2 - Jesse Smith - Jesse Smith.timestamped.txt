[2:13] off my notes God uh I prepared Lord the
[2:16] best I know how father we just ask God
[2:18] that he would speak to us here tonight
[2:19] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[2:22] said
[2:23] praise God
[2:27] looking at Revelation chapter 1 verse 20
[2:30] is where we started here I'm just going
[2:31] to briefly review uh uh last night or
[2:34] last week rather
[2:37] so in case you're the dots on there like
[2:39] two or three dots is that a lot do you
[2:41] know is that okay not really okay
[2:45] so I guess well it's probably got to be
[2:47] better than Sunday's service there's
[2:48] hardly any volume on that at all so
[2:50] praise the Lord so we just started this
[2:53] short series last Wednesday night I'm
[2:55] gonna try to Be watchful all the time
[2:56] here by God's grace as well
[2:58] I got to get some good rest of them I'm
[3:00] gonna rest my throat it all back
[3:03] uh
[3:04] pretty bad thing when you get you know a
[3:06] throat issue you're a school teacher and
[3:08] a preacher and you just talk all day so
[3:11] you know I really need God's grace amen
[3:13] you saw last week uh the Lord Jesus
[3:17] uh here gives John The Book of
[3:20] Revelation which means a book of
[3:22] disclosure it's a book of unveiling in
[3:25] other words so he's unveiling uh the the
[3:28] true leader of the world the lord Jesus
[3:30] Christ and the true bride Hallelujah the
[3:33] true groom and the true bride Hallelujah
[3:35] and then also in the Book of Revelation
[3:37] we have we have Satan he's the false god
[3:40] of this world and he has a false bride
[3:42] mystery Babylon right Hallelujah
[3:45] and our brothers said he's Protestant so
[3:47] I'm sure he knows who mystery Babylon is
[3:49] because we're protesting mystery Babylon
[3:52] hallelujah we're protesting the pope of
[3:55] Rome Hallelujah because we are
[3:57] Protestants by the grace of God
[3:59] so uh we saw how uh Revelation is a
[4:03] laying bear and it's making known
[4:05] prophecy Hallelujah and so we saw the
[4:09] confusion is a lot of people wonder
[4:11] about the Book of Revelation but Jesus
[4:13] leaves no
[4:15] confusion about it it's just that people
[4:17] are confused they want to know are the
[4:21] seven angels
[4:22] literal Angels or people or men and then
[4:25] they Wonder were these letters to the
[4:27] seven churches were they just applying
[4:30] to those churches only or did they have
[4:32] other applications
[4:34] well the Revelation is is that the
[4:37] Angels were actually men that Jesus
[4:39] would send to preach to Future ages amen
[4:42] praise God and the application though of
[4:46] the seven churches is threefold
[4:49] the letters of that that Jesus wrote and
[4:52] gave to John they were literally to
[4:54] those seven churches right at that time
[4:56] right but they were also prophetic of
[4:58] the future ages
[5:00] and if you look real closely they also
[5:02] apply to your my individual walk with
[5:04] God that's right true okay which we'll
[5:06] get to tonight by the grace of God so
[5:08] some people only will say Well they're
[5:10] only for those churches uh in 95 or 180
[5:13] with what they miss out on actually what
[5:16] Jesus Was preparing the church for Jesus
[5:19] Was preparing the church for 2 000 years
[5:21] of battles
[5:23] he was preparing he was saying this is
[5:26] what's going to happen and I'm going to
[5:27] give over I'm going to give all the
[5:29] Believers oh power to overcome Satan at
[5:33] the gates of hell would not Prevail
[5:34] against them
[5:36] because in each of the seven letters he
[5:38] said to the Overcomer I promise then
[5:40] that's right the the star Hallelujah
[5:44] uh the North Star praise God the North
[5:46] Star I promised the star where the star
[5:48] was it morning sorry sorry I'm a little
[5:51] tired too as well so we're getting I
[5:52] promise you the Morning Star all right a
[5:54] new name praise God hallelujah there's
[5:56] so many rewards he said rules are out of
[5:59] iron uh to sit on my throne and judge as
[6:02] Jesus as my father has given me Jesus
[6:04] the opportunity to judge and each age
[6:07] would have a group that would overcome
[6:09] Satan and they would be the true
[6:12] examples of Christianity for their age
[6:14] praise God right right and so we looked
[6:16] at uh we looked at a number of proofs
[6:19] last week we saw
[6:22] uh the first proof that these Angels
[6:24] were not Heavenly Angels because Jesus
[6:27] said unto the Angel Church of Ephesus
[6:30] right
[6:31] why would Jesus have John write a letter
[6:33] to Heavenly Angels when he just can he
[6:35] could just address that they all got to
[6:37] present themselves Before the Throne
[6:39] right
[6:40] so he would not uh tell John write a
[6:43] letter to Gabriel right it doesn't make
[6:45] any sense right write a letter uh to
[6:48] gate to Wormwood right or Mark Michael
[6:50] write a letter to Michael that makes no
[6:52] sense right you don't find that in the
[6:53] scripture true second though you do see
[6:56] men are called angels in the King James
[6:58] version amen we believe we say with love
[7:01] but all the other versions are corrupt
[7:03] right because they've all either either
[7:06] added to the Bible or taken away from
[7:08] the Bible
[7:09] right we can prove that by the scripture
[7:11] there's a lot of a lot of many examples
[7:12] there
[7:13] um
[7:14] David is called an angel praise God yes
[7:17] uh numerous times
[7:19] um let's see uh
[7:21] Paul's called an angel
[7:24] in Galatians 4 14 and John actually gets
[7:28] this Revelation from an angel or one of
[7:30] the servants the prophets praise God so
[7:33] that's where John gets us from
[7:35] also God always uses men to save men God
[7:39] doesn't use angels to save men God uses
[7:42] men to save men to save their souls to
[7:44] preach the word of God true fourth nor
[7:48] is the location where are the Seven
[7:49] Stars located in the hand of Christ
[7:52] praise God and that's his power and
[7:55] authority and angels are not given that
[7:59] right hand of power
[8:01] but the Bible says it's not given to
[8:02] angels in Hebrews 1 verse 13. Hallelujah
[8:05] but we know he would give that power to
[8:08] redeemed son and daughters of God humans
[8:11] Jesus said when you receive the Holy
[8:13] Ghost you'll receive power to be my
[8:15] Witnesses right amen
[8:18] and then lastly we ended with this last
[8:21] Wednesday night so here's the end of my
[8:22] review here
[8:23] uh Abraham's seed are referred to as
[8:26] stars
[8:27] in Genesis 15 verse 5 and Daniel 12 3
[8:31] Likens the saved unto stars as well
[8:35] he says they'll turn many to the
[8:37] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[8:40] ever and Jesus called John the Baptist a
[8:43] burning and shining star a burning and
[8:47] Shining Light
[8:48] in John chapter 5 verse 35. so there's
[8:52] five Vindicated proofs that when when
[8:54] Jesus told John to write letters to and
[8:56] tell these angels it wasn't Heavenly
[8:58] Angels it was Messengers that God would
[9:01] send through uh through their mothers
[9:04] through the womb and they be they be
[9:06] they come out to the world and speak in
[9:08] lies and they be sinners from the room
[9:09] but then they would experience the
[9:11] salvation of Jesus Christ they'd be
[9:13] redeemed and when they were redeemed it
[9:15] would be like Isaiah the coal fire would
[9:18] touch their mouths and then they could
[9:19] be God's Messengers on the Earth
[9:23] Isaiah said who will go for us uh and
[9:26] and then he then he gets the call on his
[9:28] on his lips and the Bible says I'll go
[9:30] then John or Isaiah said I'll go for you
[9:32] praise God Amen I'll go for us praise
[9:35] God thank the Lord now part two tonight
[9:39] uh Jesus interprets these seven golden
[9:41] candlesticks as seven churches and
[9:43] notice they're all Gentile churches
[9:46] they're not Jewish cities they're
[9:48] Gentile they're Gentile cities and
[9:50] Gentile churches
[9:51] that's because about 50 years prior the
[9:56] Bible said God blinded the Jews and now
[9:59] he was getting a bride from the Gentiles
[10:01] amen hallelujah that's wrong 50 A.D you
[10:05] can find that in Acts 13 and Romans 11.
[10:08] God had to Blind the Jews so he could
[10:10] save the Gentiles Hallelujah
[10:14] and Jesus calls this in Luke 21 24 the
[10:18] times of the Gentiles we are living in
[10:21] the times of the Gentiles in other words
[10:23] this is your time that's right this is
[10:25] my time it's our time to know God
[10:28] it's not somebody else's time don't look
[10:30] at your neighbor saying oh it's your
[10:32] time don't look at yourself and say it's
[10:33] my time amen this is my time church is
[10:37] going to come to an end and we don't
[10:39] know what's going to come to an end so
[10:40] we have to make the best use of our time
[10:42] and you did tonight by coming to the
[10:43] house of God
[10:45] because the Bible says in Luke 4 Jesus
[10:47] was always in the synagogue
[10:48] every time the synagogue was open it was
[10:50] his custom he was always in the house of
[10:52] God and remember Hebrews 10 24 25 Paul
[10:56] said gather more with Saints as you see
[10:58] the day approaching praise God
[11:01] remember Jesus specifically said he was
[11:03] going to take the Kingdom from Israel
[11:05] and give it to the Gentiles in Matthew
[11:08] 12 41. okay so can you pull it up there
[11:10] for us honey I appreciate your Labor of
[11:12] Love Tonight here for us here always
[11:14] diligently helping me out here
[11:17] foreign
[11:22] because they've repented at the
[11:25] preaching of Jonas and behold a greater
[11:27] than Jonas is here that's not the one I
[11:29] wanted
[11:31] here oh it's Matthew 21 you have 12.
[11:33] sorry about that
[11:34] I thought Matthew 21 41.
[11:40] uh says he will miserably destroy those
[11:42] wicked men and will let out his Vineyard
[11:45] unto other
[11:47] there you go yeah other
[11:49] sorry I lost my spot there
[11:52] other husband and there we go which
[11:54] shall render him the fruits in their
[11:57] season now notice did you catch that
[11:58] Seasons right he's going to give the
[12:01] kingdom to other people but they're
[12:02] going to be they're gonna have seasons
[12:04] of that time period that's good we went
[12:06] through a season of Ephesus right went
[12:09] through a season of Smyrna and pergamos
[12:11] and viratira and Sardis of Philadelphia
[12:14] now we're in the season of laodicea
[12:17] and Hallelujah Church isn't wonderful to
[12:19] know that you are the ones bringing
[12:21] forth fruit to God in this season right
[12:23] A lot of people claim to be praying
[12:26] forth first to God but if their hearts
[12:28] are not right they're not bringing forth
[12:29] the right fruit they're actually
[12:30] bringing forth corrupt fruit praise God
[12:33] and Jesus said you'll know them by their
[12:35] fruits
[12:37] right all the preachers that fall in sin
[12:39] all the false Doctrine they're bringing
[12:40] their fruits they're corrupt fruits
[12:43] prove they have corrupt lives amen but
[12:46] when we live a holy life praise God when
[12:48] we Let Jesus clean out our words when we
[12:50] Let Jesus clean out our homes and our
[12:52] habits and our families praise God and
[12:54] we see the power of God moving Our Lives
[12:56] we know we've got the right fruit praise
[12:58] God we know that the the Kingdom's been
[13:00] given to us we've been faithful stewards
[13:03] in the vineyard and Jesus will receive
[13:05] the fruit because it's our season to
[13:07] bring forth fruit praise God
[13:10] Hallelujah and remember what's the fruit
[13:12] of today the fruit of course is the
[13:14] fruits of the spirit but it's also
[13:16] having a hot walk with the Lord
[13:19] we're not lukewarm we're not cold we're
[13:21] hot we're on fire for Jesus hallelujah
[13:24] hallelujah and we have a Zeal to repent
[13:29] in other words I don't have to beg you
[13:30] to repent I'll preach it the holy spirit
[13:33] will deal with you and then you'll
[13:34] repent of it amen is that right that's
[13:37] what Jesus said as many as I love and
[13:39] Revelation 3 14-21 Ivory puke and Chase
[13:43] in Hallelujah we don't Church let's be
[13:46] honest let's not let's not make a
[13:48] that's why we don't have to repent let's
[13:49] repent quickly all the time let's be hot
[13:51] for Jesus let's be on fire let's give
[13:54] him all of our Lives let's bring forth
[13:55] fruit unto God in this season amen
[13:59] Hallelujah
[14:01] now remember Jesus and Paul say the
[14:04] times of the Gentiles have an ending
[14:07] point
[14:08] uh we let's go to Pope Romans 11 25. we
[14:12] already showed you Jesus's uh well we'll
[14:14] probably do that again but let's do a
[14:15] Romans 11 25 first
[14:18] for I would not brother that he'd be
[14:20] ignorant of this mystery unless he
[14:22] should be wise in your own conceits that
[14:24] blindness in part is happening to Israel
[14:26] until the fullness of the Gentiles
[14:29] become in so every Christian has a
[14:32] desire Lord let the let the gospel be
[14:35] spread to Every Nation let let all those
[14:38] those Saints finally come in all the
[14:40] ones that you know that are going to be
[14:42] saved let them come in Hallelujah so you
[14:44] can be finished and then we can go home
[14:46] and we can be with the Lord praise God
[14:49] see that's our desire we want all the
[14:51] Gentiles that will be saved we want all
[14:53] them to come in praise God
[14:55] that's why we that's why we have to send
[14:57] missionaries praise God that's why we
[14:59] put the videos uh online so they can go
[15:02] all around the world praise God they can
[15:03] minister to people and countries where
[15:05] we don't have money to travel we don't
[15:07] have time to travel but God uses it
[15:09] God's directing his word and God's word
[15:11] is being preached in every nation
[15:14] Hallelujah so there is an end to it
[15:17] uh Pope Luke 21 24 again huh
[15:20] Jesus says Jerusalem shall be trodden
[15:24] down right of the Gentiles until
[15:28] the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled
[15:31] okay and actually Rome Revelation 11
[15:34] gives us a better picture
[15:36] about when that's fulfilled so I didn't
[15:38] have this in my notes but let's go to
[15:39] revelation 11. because you'll see you
[15:42] get another clue in Revelation 11.
[15:46] when is this going to be we're all
[15:48] wondering that right Wesley Rapture
[15:49] when's coming to the Lord when's all
[15:51] these things the Bible gives us little
[15:53] Clues no man knows the day or the hour
[15:55] I'll say like this foolish men have
[15:57] tried to predict it down Through the
[15:58] Ages and foolish they're trying to
[16:01] predict it that's true because no man
[16:03] knows today or the hour praise God
[16:05] hallelujah but you know what church what
[16:08] we need today is a dose of wisdom praise
[16:10] God Amen that's what we need today to
[16:12] just trust the Lord to look at the
[16:14] season of The Rapture not worry about
[16:16] the day and the hour but see the season
[16:17] see all the signs with Israel or the
[16:20] signs with earthquakes on the signs with
[16:22] pestilence see all those signs and that
[16:24] just make sure that you're ready to go
[16:29] see men exalt themselves and they try to
[16:31] predict the year or try to predict
[16:33] certain things like that let's not get
[16:35] into that let's be concerned with making
[16:37] sure our lives are lined up with God's
[16:39] word our land for Trend amen amen and
[16:42] they're filled with the oil praise God
[16:45] true
[16:48] all right
[16:51] now it's in Revelation 11 here I didn't
[16:53] didn't have in this amendment or didn't
[16:54] have one in this one in my notes here so
[16:56] I'm gonna look for it real quick here
[17:00] the Bible speaks that uh
[17:02] they'll have access here
[17:05] to the court
[17:09] oh yeah it's verse two sorry staring at
[17:10] the whole time sorry
[17:11] but the court which is without the
[17:14] temple leave out and measure enough for
[17:16] it is given unto the Gentiles and the
[17:18] holy city shall they tread under foot
[17:21] forward in two months or three and a
[17:23] half years
[17:24] so Church it looks like from this I
[17:25] could be wrong I don't know how long uh
[17:28] uh it will take to rebuild the Jewish
[17:30] temple
[17:31] but Jesus said Jerusalem we trotted down
[17:34] until the times of the Gentiles be
[17:36] fulfilled and then here once the temple
[17:39] is rebuilt they actually only have
[17:40] control over the temple or the Temple
[17:43] Mount that's what the Bible says
[17:46] now that's during the tribulation we
[17:48] don't know if the building is going to
[17:49] happen before the Rapture or after the
[17:52] Rapture we don't know but Jesus gives
[17:54] these little Clues here when Israel
[17:57] starts getting control over that Temple
[18:00] Mount something's going to happen by
[18:01] God's grace
[18:02] we may see it we may not that's why I
[18:05] said just be ready praise God Amen
[18:07] if you love Jesus you'll be ready
[18:08] Hallelujah
[18:09] okay
[18:12] all right
[18:13] so God is going to keep dealing with us
[18:15] the Gentiles non-jews until the last
[18:18] person comes in
[18:20] now another way to describe the times of
[18:22] the Gentiles is seven Church ages
[18:25] because Jesus lists seven churches not
[18:28] more and not less right
[18:31] right there's only seven churches
[18:35] and he calls the Gentiles his bride on
[18:39] at least three occasions okay you should
[18:40] get ready here honey you got some typing
[18:41] to do Romans 16 16 if you got your Bible
[18:43] Romans 16 16.
[18:46] you can see it there I guess we got to
[18:47] see how fast she can go and we'll see
[18:49] how fast she can turn
[18:50] that's pretty fast salute one another
[18:52] with an holy kiss the Churches of Christ
[18:55] salute you
[18:57] they're Churches of Christ
[18:59] praise God
[19:01] Ephesians 3 21.
[19:04] Ephesians 3 21. I don't know you're
[19:07] getting fast then
[19:08] unto him be glory in the church by
[19:10] Christ Jesus throughout all ages World
[19:13] Without End Amen in the church everybody
[19:16] say Church ready church church means
[19:18] called out yes to him be glory in the
[19:22] church throughout all ages
[19:24] that means there was ages before Paul
[19:27] that means Paul lived in an age and
[19:29] there's ages after Paul
[19:31] throughout all ages Hallelujah be glory
[19:34] to Christ in his church Hallelujah
[19:37] that's beautiful amen that's good
[19:40] Ephesians 5 23 let's do that one
[19:44] nice
[19:46] for the husband is head of the wife even
[19:48] as Christ is head of the church
[19:51] and he's the savior of the body in this
[19:52] text
[19:53] Paul calls the Believers the church
[19:55] numerous times in fact that's one of the
[19:58] Mysteries
[19:59] I believe it's verse 30 if I'm not
[20:00] mistaken
[20:03] no 32. this is a great mystery but I
[20:06] speak concerning Christ and his church
[20:08] amen you are Christ called out people
[20:10] you are called out Christ sent his voice
[20:14] to call you out of sin that's correct
[20:16] amen the fact you've left sin makes you
[20:19] a part of the real Church of Jesus
[20:21] Christ
[20:22] because a lot of people remain in
[20:24] churches but they remain in sin so it
[20:26] shows they never became a part of the
[20:27] spiritual church it's not so much a
[20:29] natural church it's a spiritual church
[20:31] praise God who's led by the Holy Spirit
[20:33] and Jesus said they're led by the spirit
[20:36] into all truth of the word of God Amen
[20:40] amen that's right
[20:41] so can we call it seven Church ages yes
[20:44] we can see how the the bride the
[20:46] Gentiles are called a church now is the
[20:49] word age in the Bible
[20:50] definitely uh Ephesians 3 500 Ephesians
[20:54] 3 5.
[20:56] which in other Ages was not made known
[20:59] into the sons of men as is now revealed
[21:01] unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by
[21:03] the spirit
[21:05] okay ages
[21:07] so Paul says this Revelation that the
[21:09] Jew and Gentile or one church was hid
[21:11] from other ages so there's ages past
[21:15] and we just read how there's Asia's
[21:17] future praise God
[21:19] so if there's ages past age is future
[21:21] there must be ages now praise God there
[21:25] always is ages Hallelujah
[21:28] anybody can see that in the natural
[21:30] anybody heard anybody ever heard of the
[21:32] Industrial Age yeah where they got
[21:34] gasoline-powered machines it's egg
[21:37] there's all kinds of Ages praise God the
[21:39] Dark Ages
[21:41] there's all these ages that man Ned
[21:44] recognize it naturally but spiritually
[21:47] there's the same praise God we have
[21:49] spiritual ages Hallelujah
[21:51] and we're able to bring forth fruit to
[21:53] God in our age amen Colossians 1 26 if
[21:56] you go with your cautions 126.
[22:02] I passed it already she's so fast even
[22:05] the mystery with Jeff Beckham from ages
[22:07] and from Generations but now is made
[22:09] manifest to his Saints praise God
[22:12] Hallelujah
[22:15] and then again we already read Ephesians
[22:17] 3 21 but it said be glory to Christ
[22:20] throughout all ages World Without End so
[22:23] that means there's going to be ages all
[22:25] the way throughout eternity
[22:28] because the world will not have an
[22:29] ending because God's going to bring
[22:31] Eternal quality to his creation to the
[22:34] world so we can live on this Earth
[22:36] eternally praise God that's right
[22:40] now I'm going to say something here and
[22:42] I don't mean to be critical but on the
[22:44] debate you know I was criticized a
[22:45] little bit uh I was told uh brother you
[22:49] add to the Bible and say there's Church
[22:50] ages
[22:51] and I said brother it's right there in
[22:53] the Bible we're called a church and the
[22:54] Bible says there's ages right and he
[22:57] said well bro Jesse you're adding to the
[22:58] Bible
[22:59] I said you're wrong
[23:03] but he was accusing me of adding to the
[23:05] Bible when I wasn't and he was actually
[23:07] the one adding to the Bible because he
[23:09] calls God three persons foreign
[23:13] if you don't know I don't know if Randy
[23:15] knows but the Bible never calls God
[23:17] three persons the word Trinity is not
[23:19] even in the Bible
[23:20] we deny nothing about the fathers and
[23:23] Holy Ghost we just deny the Catholic
[23:25] dogma that changes God's name and his
[23:28] power and his identity it makes him
[23:30] really powerless is what it does
[23:32] by changing his name he loses his power
[23:34] he loses he loses his authority but
[23:37] there's one name above all names there
[23:39] is one name to the father son Holy Ghost
[23:41] that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:43] amen amen
[23:45] so the man accusing me of out of the
[23:47] Bible when I'm not is the one adding to
[23:49] the Bible true see I'm saying is he
[23:51] accuser of the brother
[23:52] he's accusing you but he's the one who's
[23:54] guilty
[23:55] watch that now their tires were wrong
[23:57] and we do we do need accusing if we're
[23:59] wrong
[24:00] because we're human
[24:02] but that time I wasn't wrong there's
[24:04] been times I'm wrong I'm human I'm not
[24:06] mistakes
[24:07] God's word is never wrong I'm wrong
[24:09] that's right right I make mistakes I'm
[24:11] human true but you know they they
[24:13] accused me oh Church ages are in the
[24:15] Bible I just showed you where the church
[24:17] I just showed you there's past ages
[24:19] future ages and there's always ages
[24:22] praise God
[24:23] so it's a it's a biblically acceptable
[24:26] term to say times in the Gentiles or
[24:28] seven Church ages
[24:30] Hallelujah all right
[24:32] how am I doing okay good praise the Lord
[24:34] now the church Ages were foretold
[24:38] in numerous ways in the Old Testament of
[24:41] course we know they were foretold by the
[24:43] menorah how many candlesticks had the
[24:45] menorah seven not eight not six no seven
[24:50] praise God and Jesus said Jesus had
[24:54] those seven uh candlesticks the menorah
[24:56] in heaven and he said these seven
[24:58] candlesticks are the seven churches
[25:00] praise God
[25:01] Hallelujah
[25:03] and remember remember there were seven
[25:05] ages in the Old Testament you preached
[25:07] on that you only preached one or two
[25:08] sermons on it I know it's a while ago
[25:10] there were seven ages from the time of
[25:12] David all the way to John the Baptist
[25:15] Seven Ages you can find it right through
[25:17] them right if you just look carefully
[25:19] you can find it right through the
[25:20] scriptures there
[25:21] he was foreshadowing
[25:23] what's going to happen with the Gentiles
[25:25] and now we've had seven Church ages for
[25:28] the Gentiles so it's foreshadowed there
[25:30] it was also foreshadowed in the
[25:34] scripture uh let's see
[25:36] Hosea 6. so if you brought up Hosea 6
[25:39] verses 1 2 and 3.
[25:45] Come and Let Us return unto the Lord
[25:46] Israel us Israel Hosea is an Israeli
[25:50] Prophet for he hath torn and he will
[25:53] heal us he has smitted and he will bind
[25:56] to some now church if you read them
[25:57] Jeremiah and Ezekiel the Reason God tore
[26:00] them and smoked them because they
[26:01] wouldn't repent
[26:03] in other words we don't we don't go we
[26:05] don't get mad at God when God does
[26:07] something we know God is doing it to
[26:09] chasten us
[26:11] God is trying to get us to repent God's
[26:13] trying to get us to Humble ourselves
[26:14] praise God in other words God does no
[26:17] wrong
[26:18] God has only done us right the Bible
[26:20] says I found it last week in Jeremiah
[26:22] God has done to us less than what we
[26:25] actually deserve
[26:26] in other words we've got less spankings
[26:28] than we actually deserve
[26:29] how we can say Amen to that amen
[26:31] hallelujah
[26:33] he's so merciful he's so gracious
[26:35] mess up I'm sorry he will revive I'm
[26:38] sorry will revive us in the third day he
[26:42] will raise us up and we will live in his
[26:45] sight then we shall know if we follow on
[26:48] to know the Lord his going forth and
[26:50] prepare it as the morning he shall come
[26:52] unto us as the rain as the latter and
[26:54] former Reign unto the earth now we know
[26:56] rain represents the falling of holy
[26:58] spirit amen right on the day of
[27:00] Pentecost Hallelujah the rain fell uh
[27:03] Peter said this is that which Joel spoke
[27:05] of Hallelujah in the last days I'll pour
[27:07] my spirit upon All Flesh aren't you glad
[27:10] Church it got poured out on you praise
[27:11] God hallelujah you might have danced you
[27:14] might have shot and screamed you might
[27:16] have wept your your eyes out you might
[27:17] have spoken tongues you might have
[27:19] prophesied but one thing's for sure the
[27:21] rain fell on you you went from dry to
[27:23] being thoroughly uh purged and saturated
[27:26] or thoroughly saturated with the water
[27:28] of God
[27:29] with the life of God hallelujah amen
[27:32] preaching too loud here for my voice
[27:38] so
[27:41] the two days after two days now a day
[27:44] can represent a thousand years in the
[27:45] Bible second Peter 3 8 you don't pull it
[27:48] up uh because these other one day with
[27:50] the Lord it says a thousand years and a
[27:51] thousand years is one day so in other
[27:53] words God is going to revive Israel that
[27:55] 144 000 Remnant with the Seal of the
[27:58] Holy Ghost after he spends two thousand
[28:00] years with the Gentiles
[28:02] yeah in the third not the second after
[28:05] two days after two thousand years
[28:07] Hallelujah
[28:09] remember now pull up Acts 2 17 honey
[28:11] Peter says the spirit will be poured out
[28:13] in the last days
[28:16] 2 000 years praise God
[28:18] one day is a thousand two days is two
[28:21] thousand I'll pour out my spirit in the
[28:23] last days God has not stopped pouring
[28:25] out his spirit for the last two thousand
[28:27] years praise God he's put it on women
[28:30] he's put it on children he's put on
[28:31] grandmas he's put on Grandpa's he put on
[28:34] you he put on young people hallelujah
[28:36] he's pouring it out all those who want a
[28:38] fresh drink he'll give a fresh drink
[28:40] pouring it out today Hallelujah
[28:43] thank you Lord
[28:45] Paul said it again
[28:47] in the last days perilous times shall
[28:49] come second Timothy 3 1. in the last
[28:51] days days two thousand years
[28:55] has it how many understand the last two
[28:57] thousand years have been a dangerous
[28:58] time for Christians sure
[29:01] right
[29:02] just from the time of Saint Augustine
[29:04] unto the 1800s 68 million Christians
[29:08] were martyred by the Roman Catholic
[29:09] church and that's just what they were
[29:10] able to record
[29:12] that's just what they were able to
[29:13] record and not just one small section of
[29:16] this 2000 year history where Christians
[29:18] have given their lives this has been 2
[29:21] 000 years of trouble sometimes for
[29:23] Christians
[29:26] Hallelujah
[29:29] so we see it in numerous places there in
[29:31] the scripture
[29:34] no Jesus said the churches are I'm sorry
[29:37] the seven candlesticks speak of seven
[29:39] churches
[29:40] we're not going to turn there but uh
[29:42] Exodus 25 shows the menorah seven
[29:46] candlesticks praise God and each one all
[29:50] had Wicks that flowed into the same
[29:52] reservoir of oil oh it's a great lesson
[29:55] right there praise God Amen in other
[29:57] words if we got the Holy Ghost today we
[30:00] got the same holy ghost that Peter had
[30:01] praise amen the same holy ghost that
[30:03] Martin had an iranius praise God
[30:06] hallelujah and John Wesley we got the
[30:08] same Holy Ghost because all seven Church
[30:10] cages were drawing from the same
[30:12] Reservoir the same spirit of God in
[30:14] other words God Is With Us praise God
[30:16] and we've got to call him on the scene
[30:18] praise God
[30:19] amen
[30:20] all seven churches were drolling on the
[30:24] same power right the same oil praise God
[30:27] hallelujah
[30:29] is that what Peter said in Acts 2 verses
[30:31] 38 and 39 he said This Promise is to you
[30:34] your children them that are far off and
[30:37] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[30:40] call praise God
[30:42] and the gospel must go to all until the
[30:45] fullness of the Gentiles we come in
[30:47] praise God
[30:48] that's the all he's talking about all
[30:50] that are far off I love about Ephesians
[30:53] chapter 2 says or Ephesians chapter 3
[30:55] the Bible said we were far off from God
[30:57] but what brought us not what brought us
[30:59] out to God was it our church no was it
[31:02] your intellectualism was it my smartness
[31:05] no no the Bible said there's one thing
[31:07] that true is closer to God it was the
[31:09] blood of Jesus Christ amen by the blood
[31:12] of Jesus Christ we have brought we have
[31:14] been brought nigh to the promises of God
[31:16] to the covenants of God thank God we
[31:19] have a savior who sacrificed himself
[31:21] shed his blood and now we're not far off
[31:23] now we're right in the prince of God the
[31:25] Bible said by prayer we can come into
[31:27] the very presence of God almighty
[31:30] the Throne of God hallelujah
[31:33] that's how that's what the blood of
[31:34] Jesus Christ does it takes somebody
[31:36] who's far off it's kind of like bang how
[31:38] he went to get see him praise God she
[31:40] was far off but now she's not
[31:42] hallelujah praise God like honestly they
[31:44] were far off in Arizona but now God
[31:46] brought him not Hallelujah
[31:48] that's what God did spiritually for each
[31:50] and every one of us
[31:52] we were born far from God but God has
[31:55] brought us into the promise of God
[31:58] we are a partaker of the inheritance of
[32:01] the states in line praise God
[32:05] Glory
[32:08] let's read uh Zechariah 4 1 honey
[32:11] Zechariah 4 1.
[32:13] is he oil
[32:15] resents the Holy Spirit
[32:18] we're going to go to Zechariah 4 1 but
[32:19] remember of course Matthew 25 1-13 the
[32:22] parable the ten virgins
[32:24] five had extra oil five didn't
[32:27] so that shows those with the Holy Ghost
[32:29] those with the Holy Spirit go into
[32:31] Jesus's wedding reception praise God
[32:33] true
[32:34] but here's here's where we get the
[32:36] meaning of that symbol
[32:38] the angel that talked with me came again
[32:40] and wake me as a man that's waking out
[32:42] of his sleep verse two
[32:43] and said to me what see us thou and I
[32:45] said I've looked and behold a
[32:46] Candlestick of all gold
[32:48] with a ball upon the top of it and his
[32:51] seven lamps there on and seven pipes to
[32:53] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[32:55] they're out verse three
[32:58] and two olive trees behind one upon the
[33:00] right side of the bowl and the other up
[33:02] on the left side of thereof verse four
[33:05] so I answered respect to the angel
[33:06] talked with me saying what are these my
[33:09] Lord verse 5. then the angel had talked
[33:12] with me answered and said to me knowest
[33:14] thou not what these be and I said no my
[33:16] Lord verse 6.
[33:17] then he answered and his fake unto me
[33:19] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[33:21] zeruba will say not by might not by
[33:24] power but by my oil saith the Lord of
[33:28] hosts
[33:29] did I read that right no but was that
[33:31] what it means yes
[33:33] olive trees Hallelujah producing olives
[33:36] that produce oil praise God
[33:39] oil represents the Holy Spirit we will
[33:42] we will not make the Rapture by our
[33:44] might or our power you didn't make it
[33:47] here tonight by your power amen you
[33:49] didn't become a Christian because of
[33:51] your power or your mind you became a
[33:53] Christian by the holy spirit's power
[33:55] amen
[33:56] God dealing with you drawing with you
[33:58] praise God he's
[33:59] too by Grace not by human effort praise
[34:01] God so the least we can do now that
[34:03] we're saved is give God our effort
[34:05] praise God
[34:06] Peter said give all diligence
[34:09] to make your calling an election sure
[34:11] and Jesus says love me with all your
[34:13] heart soul mind and strength give me all
[34:16] your strength tonight praise God
[34:18] healed all your strength to the Holy
[34:20] Spirit
[34:21] Hallelujah that's what that shows your
[34:23] real love for Jesus Christ
[34:25] given everything you've got
[34:27] Hallelujah
[34:29] that shows you really love it yeah
[34:31] you're saved by grace but then he says
[34:33] he said if you love me keep my commands
[34:35] exactly
[34:36] yield yourself to the Holy Spirit praise
[34:39] God
[34:41] now you know this has numerous types
[34:43] right
[34:44] this the two Olive branches God was
[34:47] speaking to his roomable he said this
[34:49] was haggai and Zechariah
[34:51] but then we know of course later uh it's
[34:54] going to be Moses and Elijah or two men
[34:56] with the spirit of Moses in Elijah right
[34:58] in Revelation chapter 11. these are two
[35:01] olive trees which stand and preach to
[35:03] the whole earth praise God
[35:05] so that's where we understand oil in
[35:07] this Menorah oil in this Reservoir
[35:10] represents the spirit of God in every
[35:12] age we must draw from the spirit of God
[35:15] hallelujah Church whatever you're facing
[35:18] tonight draw on God's oil tonight
[35:22] soak up some of God's oil so your light
[35:24] can shine in your situation praise God
[35:27] that that's that's the secret to all
[35:30] these uh all these victories of all the
[35:32] churches down through the years no
[35:33] matter what they were facing we're
[35:35] facing a One World Government right
[35:38] we're basing the world that wants us to
[35:39] get covered shots every year right and
[35:41] have covered cards
[35:43] and wants to lock us down another
[35:44] lockdown another list we're facing these
[35:47] things
[35:48] but we we don't have to worry because
[35:50] we're drawing on something that's
[35:52] greater than us
[35:53] we're drawing on the same thing Peter
[35:56] and Paul Drew on when they went to be
[35:58] martyred
[35:59] we just got to draw another because that
[36:01] is we just got to soak in God's presence
[36:05] and if you're soaking in God's presence
[36:07] and if he's lit your fire and if you
[36:09] trim your lamps you're gonna glow with
[36:11] the power of Jesus Christ
[36:15] so humble
[36:16] it may be like James where James did not
[36:18] get rescued for prison
[36:20] Peter got rescued from prison but James
[36:22] did not
[36:24] but did he still glow with the power of
[36:25] the Holy Ghost absolutely
[36:28] do you think the Saints prayed for James
[36:29] when he got arrested yeah absolutely
[36:32] remember they were shocked when Peter
[36:34] come out of there they were shot like
[36:35] this can't be Peter you must wrote it
[36:37] you must be a little confused you got
[36:39] you're a little beside your stuff you
[36:40] saw an angel you saw a vision
[36:42] right
[36:43] see God has a story he's writing and
[36:46] church we don't know the end of the
[36:48] story whether it's death by martyr or
[36:50] death by the grave
[36:52] we don't know the story but one thing we
[36:54] know is that we can soak in the oil of
[36:56] God and we can burn brightly and we can
[36:58] manifest the life of Jesus Christ we can
[37:01] have the same power they had the
[37:03] beginning in fact we know the same part
[37:04] of the beginning will be the same power
[37:06] at the end praise God it's been the same
[37:09] power down Through the Ages
[37:13] hey friends I could come to you tonight
[37:15] and tell you my biggest obstacle my
[37:17] biggest struggle in my life and you can
[37:18] say brother Jesse just soak in that
[37:20] presence of the Lord
