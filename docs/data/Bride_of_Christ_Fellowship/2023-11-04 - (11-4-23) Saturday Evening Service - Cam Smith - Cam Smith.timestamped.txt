[0:39] you now think about that you got two
[0:43] million people going up to the promised
[0:47] land two million people and when they
[0:51] get in there we see that God had already
[0:54] made promises to
[0:56] themen because he knew he was
[0:59] positionally placing them amen I want
[1:02] you to see this this wasn't uh a New
[1:05] Jerusalem where everybody was gathered
[1:07] in a city or something like this when
[1:10] God gave them their
[1:12] possession they were all in specific
[1:15] spots amen I want you to see this so you
[1:19] know they weren't in church all the
[1:24] time cuz you know it's it's a lot easier
[1:27] to fight the battle when when you when
[1:28] you got some you got some real big
[1:30] Christians right next to you amen help
[1:33] me pray through Brothers glory
[1:37] amen but look at how God is manifesting
[1:41] himself he's putting them in a land with
[1:45] borders amen he's putting them in a land
[1:48] where there's enemies amen remember when
[1:51] it came to the Book of Joshua people
[1:53] said that's the Millennium and brother B
[1:55] said it could not have been the
[1:56] Millennium because there was battles
[1:58] there amen right he said it was the land
[2:03] of the Holy Ghost
[2:06] amen
[2:07] hallelujah if you in that land is the
[2:10] same ability as
[2:12] [Applause]
[2:14] that
[2:16] Hallelujah one man of you shall chase a
[2:20] thousand for the Lord your God he is
[2:22] figh fight for you as he promise

[2:27] man one woman Amen in that land
[2:31] in that land amen see what I'm saying we
[2:34] got to know what the Holy Ghost is amen
[2:37] the Holy Ghost places you in that land
[2:39] amen apply that to your heart
[2:43] amen apply that cuz I tell you what it's
[2:46] not a land that you see it's a land that
[2:49] you're spiritually
[2:54] in Hallelujah you're in that land that
[2:58] it doesn't matter what comes your way
[3:01] am yes sir you could chase a thousand
[3:05] Devils out of your
[3:07] midst but it's what you see if you see
[3:11] just little on me or little
[3:13] insignificant me then what you won't be
[3:15] able to do
[3:18] it but if you can say I'm in a land
[3:21] that's flowing with milk and
[3:23] honey and my God made a promise it is
[3:28] written
[3:30] one man of you shall chase a
[3:35] thousand Hallelujah you know what that
[3:39] means that means that you know who you
[3:42] are
[3:43] amen you realize God can't fail that
[3:47] amen he can't amen if you know you're in
[3:50] that land amen
[3:54] amen yes

[4:00] 2311 watch this take good heed therefore
[4:04] unto
[4:05] yourselves that ye love the Lord your
[4:12] God everybody's like
[4:15] ah I don't have to chase a thousand
[4:18] anymore because I fail all the
[4:21] time can I ask you a
[4:25] question what made your love acceptable
[4:28] to God
[4:35] what made your Merit acceptable to God
[4:40] now we're getting quiet amen and I'm
[4:42] going this way for a
[4:44] reason because many times we allow our
[4:48] love to wne amen by what we see on this
[4:52] amen it beats us up for weeks
[4:55] sometimes sometimes months sometimes I
[4:58] know people have been in there for years
[4:59] years yes I know people that can't even
[5:02] get out of it and they're just like
[5:03] Johnny Crow remember the farmer tied him
[5:06] up to the post he just kept walking
[5:07] around amen then they said one day the
[5:09] farmer he came over and he took that off
[5:12] and he said Johnny Crow was so used to
[5:14] doing he just kept on doing it he was
[5:17] free
[5:18] amen he was
[5:21] [Music]
[5:22] free but he didn't have a revelation
[5:25] amen that's it of what happened amen
[5:31] yes Hallelujah let me ask you this when
[5:34] was your love acceptable to God
[5:37] understand what I'm saying what's the
[5:38] measure how high do I got to get oh well
[5:40] I got to be like preacher so and so and
[5:42] and I gota be like that and I got to be
[5:43] like
[5:45] that now you're getting it cuz wait a
[5:48] minute whose love made you acceptable to
[5:53] begin with
[5:55] amen the Bible says in first John that
[5:58] it was Jesus that first love
[6:02] you you didn't first love
[6:05] him he first loved you and then he
[6:09] anointed that predestinated seed amen
[6:14] hallelujah and then watch his goal was
[6:17] to get your love for him to get repent
[6:20] and get baptized in the name of Jesus
[6:23] Christ Hallelujah and he would what he
[6:26] would draw you amen with his love
[6:32] Hallelujah and you'd be just like the
[6:35] Apostle Paul amen I'm the least of the
[6:37] Saints amen I'm the least of them amen
[6:40] God makes it in a way so that you could
[6:43] never feel acceptable amen by how much
[6:45] you and your own ability could love him
[6:47] [Music]
[6:48] amen Your Love isn't a sacrifice amen
[6:52] Your Love isn't a Bloodshed
[6:55] amen yes sir your love isn't what amen
[7:00] in knowing that he took your
[7:06] place I'm not doing away with repentance
[7:09] I'm doing away with the fact you feel
[7:12] unaccepted you are not
[7:14] accepted remember in the adoption
[7:16] message brother brandom said he said
[7:18] Jesus can look at you no different than
[7:22] the way he looked at you when he put
[7:24] your name on that
[7:26] book Hallelujah Hal Hallelujah he knew
[7:30] you'd sin he knew you'd fall
[7:34] short but he couldn't want see anything
