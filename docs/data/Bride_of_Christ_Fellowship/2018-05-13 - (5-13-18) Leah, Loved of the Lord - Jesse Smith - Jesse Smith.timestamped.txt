[38:23] Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter 29
[38:25] verse 16 I like to preach a little
[38:28] thought called Leah loved of the Lord
[38:30] let's look at the life of Leah this
[38:33] morning by the grace of the Lord it's
[38:34] kind of came to me this morning as I was
[38:36] in prayer I was planning on preaching on
[38:38] the book of Revelation yesterday but as
[38:41] I was in prayer this morning it just
[38:42] kind of seemed to change a little bit
[38:45] let's go to Genesis 29 this morning
[39:02] Genesis 29 verse 16
[39:21] we read 16 through 18 verse 16 says and
[39:29] Laban had two daughters and the name of
[39:31] the elder was Leah and the name of the
[39:34] younger was Rachel Leo was tender eyed
[39:39] but Rachel was beautiful and well
[39:42] favored and Jacob loved Rachel and said
[39:46] I will serve these seven years for
[39:48] Rachel that younger daughter amen let's
[39:52] have a word of Prayer for you just bow
[39:53] our heads and if you ever need on your
[39:54] heart just make it known unto the Lord
[39:55] this morning heavenly father Lord on
[39:59] this Mother's Day Lord were we're
[40:00] grateful Lord I think about my life and
[40:03] how you've given me such a wonderful
[40:04] mother Lord who's lived what she's known
[40:08] Lord and father and taught me to pray
[40:13] Lord and I can still remember I can
[40:15] still hear her voice in my mind Lord
[40:17] about scriptures she tried to teach me
[40:19] to obey and honor and father I'm
[40:22] grateful for that Lord as your prophet
[40:24] taught us to be grateful Lord for the
[40:27] motherly love that we received O God I
[40:29] think of all the little girls in our
[40:31] church I think of all the sisters Lord
[40:33] and how Lord do you care for them Lord
[40:37] God and how you've just formed each of
[40:39] them Lord according to thy desire and
[40:41] thy will father we just ask that your
[40:45] great holy spirit of love Lord God would
[40:47] speak to us in love this morning father
[40:50] helping us all to love others and father
[40:53] as we look at Leah and Lord may be a
[40:55] blessing to our our souls this morning

[41:56] generation I'd like a little more
[41:58] brother Branham too but I understand you
[42:00] know about that but I really want that
[42:03] pillar of fire to shine there and then
[42:06] just keep it in prayer you know all of
[42:07] July for our 4 p.m. services we're going
[42:09] to do some teachings there and I like
[42:12] how they have the map I thought they did
[42:13] a really nice job on there and some
[42:16] people have donated that already so
[42:17] thank you for the donations that's very
[42:20] kind to donate to that we're just using
[42:22] tithes and offerings and then anyone
[42:24] else who wants to donate anything
[42:25] separately and just give Akron a chance
[42:28] to hear the word of God I don't know how
[42:30] many times I prayed and cried tears for
[42:33] the abominations done in Akron and
[42:35] asking God to save what you can in this
[42:37] place
[42:38] shake Akron and and we know that God has
[42:41] shaken cities in the Bible and there was
[42:43] just a few believers that got saved so
[42:46] perhaps I know Akron's been shaken OS
[42:49] hope God shakes it again by God's grace
[42:51] that's that's our prayer and so they
[42:54] asked for a quote so I asked for a
[42:55] couple of the Saints to give me quotes
[42:56] and so I shared a couple of quotes with
[42:58] them and they always like to add a quote
[43:00] you know from a church member or
[43:01] something like that like a testimonial
[43:03] so I appreciate those people who share
[43:05] those with me now this morning I like to
[43:08] just look at this thought here we're
[43:09] gonna focus on you know Leah you know
[43:11] but we'll look at this here as I've been
[43:14] studying the the the I'm sorry
[43:16] Revelation chapter 4 in the church ages
[43:19] brother Branham keeps hitting on the
[43:22] four and twenty elders to which of
[43:23] course we know 12 of them were the
[43:24] twelve sons of Jacob and so as I was
[43:27] studying that I came across numerous
[43:28] quotes and so I'll be you know
[43:30] referencing this throughout the sermon
[43:33] Lord winning this morning but this is
[43:35] the order of the birth you know the
[43:36] first four were through Leah and then
[43:38] two came by Leah's I'm sorry then two
[43:40] came by Rachel's handmaid and then Leah
[43:44] had to buy her handmaid and then Leah
[43:48] had two more and then Rachel had the
[43:51] last two so I'm just gonna emphasize or
[43:54] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just gonna point
[43:56] to that a little bit by the grace of
[43:58] Lord throughout this sermon let me set
[43:59] my timer so I don't wear myself out
[44:03] I just want to rehearse a few things
[44:05] remember as I preach in years past I was
[44:07] just going through my past
[44:08] Mother's Day messages but the RAM said
[44:11] mother is so great because she's the
[44:13] first one that receives you in this life
[44:15] she's so great I'm glad my mom received
[44:18] me although she had three in diapers
[44:20] already I'm glad she's to receive me she
[44:23] could have said well I don't really want
[44:24] to receive you but she was grace you
[44:27] know God was gracious brother branham
[44:29] said if I could give any credit to
[44:31] Moses's character because of his God
[44:33] sent mother God sent mother the RAM said
[44:39] Moses could not have had a better
[44:41] teacher than his mother and as I told
[44:45] you you know I I can still hear my
[44:46] mother saying Jesse now sometimes she'd
[44:49] joke around and say dude you know cuz
[44:51] that's how we talked back then so she
[44:52] was trying to be a buddy to me and she
[44:55] say dude
[44:57] she'd say to whom much is given much is
[45:00] required all your friends are watching
[45:02] you you she said you can't do things
[45:03] like that you can't go out and party
[45:06] like that and you can't do that she'd
[45:08] say dude you know to try to make me feel
[45:10] like she is one of my friends and I can
[45:13] still hear her say the scripture God has
[45:16] not given us a spirit of fear but of
[45:18] power love and a sound mind I can still
[45:22] hear her faithful words there I'm
[45:25] grateful for that you know I did want to
[45:29] find one more I'm sorry I didn't want to
[45:32] say a few other things I was as I was
[45:34] looking through this the RAM said here
[45:39] that mothers are called to bring life
[45:43] into the world and that's what they're
[45:45] put on earth to do but
[45:51] said a woman when she's raised the
[45:52] family she's done the duty that God told
[45:56] her to do amen
[45:58] thought that was really encouraging by
[46:01] the grace of the Lord and I want to read
[46:03] this too I preached this of years ago
[46:05] and I forgot all about this but the
[46:06] random said a praying woman is the
[46:09] backbone of your home and the nation a
[46:13] praying woman so sisters see how
[46:15] valuable your prayers are I know your
[46:18] bit we know they're busy children some
[46:22] of them work you know we know but when
[46:24] the praying mother can intercede in the
[46:27] sight of God it provides stability for
[46:30] the family and I just remember preaching
[46:33] this a few years ago I think was two
[46:34] years ago
[46:36] she's the backbone then the man would be
[46:38] the head and the central nervous system
[46:41] but he needs the mind of Christ if she's
[46:43] the backbone and he's the head and we
[46:46] know the Bible said about you know
[46:47] Jezebel you know kind of moved a HAP you
[46:50] know and she kind of controlled the
[46:52] relationship but we know that it's
[46:57] important like that so I want to read
[46:59] this too I found this when I was looking
[47:01] up nerves the spine runs from the base
[47:06] of the skull to the pelvis it serves as
[47:08] a pillar to support the body's weight
[47:10] and to protect the spinal cord there's
[47:16] three natural curves in the spine that
[47:18] give it an S shape when viewed from the
[47:19] side these curves help the spine
[47:22] withstand great amounts of stress by
[47:24] providing a more even distribution of
[47:26] body weight and then it says the spine
[47:31] is made up of these bones stacked like
[47:33] blocks on top of each other to help
[47:36] absorb shock and load so think about how
[47:40] a mother protects you not only when
[47:42] you're in but even outward right when
[47:44] you're in the body but when you're out
[47:46] the protection of mothers prayer gives
[47:49] you or even a natural protection we know
[47:51] mothers will go to any lengths to
[47:52] protect their babies don't you
[47:54] appreciate that the love of a mother and
[47:56] then remember the nerves here's this one
[47:58] thing I thought it was striking the
[48:00] spinal cord the column of nerve fibers
[48:02] responsible for sending and receiving
[48:04] messages
[48:05] brain runs through the spinal canal it
[48:07] is through the spinal cord and it's
[48:09] branching nerves that the brain
[48:11] influences the rest of the body
[48:13] controlling movement and organ function
[48:16] I remember this I forgot about this till
[48:18] this morning as the spinal cord runs
[48:20] through the spinal canal it branches off
[48:24] into 31 pairs of nerve roots 31 pairs
[48:31] when then which then branch out into the
[48:34] nerves that travel to the rest of the
[48:37] body so brother Ram calls the woman the
[48:39] backbone here we see the spinal cord and
[48:41] then it's got 31 branches of nerves that
[48:44] pair off to these nerve roots and the
[48:47] Bible calls a faithful woman of proverbs
[48:49] 31 woman in that striking Maya that was
[48:52] just so good I just had to read that
[48:54] again so thank you for bearing with me
[48:56] just how God places these natural
[48:59] teachings right inside of our own bodies
[49:01] and the Bible said no man could deny
[49:04] there's a God because God has showed it
[49:05] to them through their own body amen
[49:07] so I hope that's a blessing there by the
[49:10] grace of Lord I just wanted to start
[49:11] with that to remind you how much God
[49:14] thinks of a godly mother amen
[49:16] so I trust if you have our set my momma
[49:18] text maybe I'll card hope I can call her
[49:20] tonight but if you haven't contacted
[49:21] your mom tell her how much you love her
[49:23] and tell her she's so great
[49:25] you can tell her a prophet said so mom
[49:28] you're so great let's look at Leah this
[49:32] morning I like to preach on Leah by the
[49:34] grace of the Lord and like I said I
[49:36] wasn't planning on that it just kind of
[49:37] come to me now before I get the Lee of
[49:40] course we have to start with Jacob and
[49:42] Jacob is outstanding character in the
[49:45] Bible remember he's his name means
[49:47] supplanter which means one who follows
[49:49] on another's heels he's right there on
[49:52] Esau's heels he's right there as that
[49:54] kind of competitive brother you know
[49:56] right there and he's second born of
[49:59] course of the twins of Isaac and Rebekah
[50:01] and it says his father was 59 and
[50:07] Abraham was 159 when he was born he was
[50:12] a man of quiet gentle disposition he
[50:15] wasn't the hunter he liked the life of a
[50:17] shepherd
[50:18] he was more of a shepherd type of boy
[50:22] Esau was the great mighty hunter the
[50:24] hairy man the man that was more brute
[50:26] and more the outdoorsman that gives me
[50:29] hope you know cuz I never was a hunter
[50:30] so that gives me some hope that God can
[50:32] use me and uh but remember you know
[50:36] before he had his change you know his
[50:39] wrestling with the angel he was a real
[50:41] deceiver as well you know supplanter and
[50:43] as we know and and so he used deception
[50:46] he and his mother use deception to gain
[50:47] the birthright but the birthright had at
[50:49] least four benefits to it first of all
[50:53] it was superior rank in the family like
[50:56] the leader of the family second it was a
[50:59] double portion of paternal inheritance
[51:01] according to Deuteronomy 21 17 you got a
[51:04] double portion when you were the
[51:07] firstborn also it makes you the priest
[51:10] of the family interceding for your
[51:13] family to God and that's in Deuteronomy
[51:15] I'm sorry numbers 8 17 through 19 you
[51:19] became the spiritual leader so not only
[51:20] natural leader take care of natural
[51:22] things but you also were the one that
[51:24] would intercede for your family that's
[51:27] what God expected I have a firstborn and
[51:30] lastly which was the most important one
[51:32] when you were the but when you had the
[51:35] birthright the promise of the seed of
[51:37] Abraham which would bless all nations
[51:40] would come through you so we don't know
[51:43] exactly why Jacob did this remember he
[51:45] was in and we'd say his unconverted her
[51:46] unsanctified state but he was basically
[51:50] saying I want all these benefits
[51:53] I want the blessings of God and we found
[51:56] out that later it was all ordained of
[51:58] God because II thought Esau thought more
[52:00] of natural blessings than he did of
[52:02] spiritual blessings it was more
[52:04] interested in taking care of his flesh
[52:06] and and enjoying a easier life for
[52:09] having the the the needs of life natural
[52:12] needs rather than the spiritual needs
[52:14] and church if we're not careful we'll
[52:16] get caught up in the same thing where
[52:18] our lives or if people watch our lives
[52:19] it only speaks of natural things natural
[52:22] things every every decision is a natural
[52:24] natural need whereas every decision
[52:26] should be a spiritual need taking the
[52:29] Word of God first and then of course
[52:31] that will lead
[52:32] to natural needs being met because we
[52:35] seek the kingdom of God first then
[52:38] everything else is added unto us we wait
[52:41] upon the Lord John and I were talking
[52:42] yesterday and a hasty man tries to just
[52:45] make things happen himself without
[52:46] following the Word of God and nervous
[52:49] and and trying to quickly solve things
[52:51] we're but a patient man or woman they'll
[52:53] take it to God first and go to God in
[52:56] prayer first and it's hard but it's a
[52:59] sacrifice and we're commanded to be
[53:01] living sacrifices we got to make sure we
[53:03] don't take ourselves off the altar of
[53:05] God where we don't crucify our flesh and
[53:07] that's one thing about living sacrifice
[53:09] it can squirm off the altar right but
[53:12] we've got to be a living sacrifice that
[53:14] stays at the altar of God that we'll die
[53:17] every day and we'll crucify the lust of
[53:21] inflexion affectional us every day every
[53:24] service you're saying god help me to
[53:26] slay and crucify the lusts of my flesh
[53:29] now I'll jump off this service I don't
[53:31] have to pay attention this service or
[53:33] I'd have to apply it to me brother Jesse
[53:34] is really only preaching to mothers
[53:36] today though he's preaching to all of us
[53:39] because God preaching to all of us God
[53:41] wants to feed all of his sheep this
[53:42] morning not just well maybe the female
[53:45] sheep can have all the good grafts and
[53:46] all the male sheep don't have to they
[53:48] they can just go you don't have the
[53:49] leftovers you know God wants all of his
[53:52] sheep to be fed this morning that's
[53:54] exactly right
[53:55] so whatever it was no doubt even though
[53:58] Jacob was it in a real we'd say
[54:00] sanctified spot there was something in
[54:02] him that wanted this birthright and that
[54:05] we know it was more than the natural
[54:07] because later he became a very spiritual
[54:09] man and became one of the three
[54:11] patriarchs right Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[54:15] so there was something down inside of
[54:18] him that God saw God looked down and
[54:20] said I love him but I hate Esau I love
[54:24] Jacob because Jacob even in a state like
[54:26] that was willing to have a fellowship or
[54:29] association with me he wanted my
[54:32] blessing he wanted my influence he
[54:34] wanted my name to be connected to his
[54:37] name more than anything else and he was
[54:39] willing to do anything to get it
[54:41] amen now of course everything evil he
[54:44] did he got paid he got paid back for
[54:46] all the mischief he did mischief was
[54:49] done to him as well so we know that that
[54:51] whatever we reap we sow but behind all
[54:54] of that was a heart that loved God so
[54:57] much so as he was leaving you know his
[54:59] family he prayed and and God showed him
[55:01] a ladder right and and he saw angels
[55:04] ascending and descending and he said
[55:06] surely God is in this place and he said
[55:08] because you're with me God surely I'll
[55:10] give you a tenth of everything that I
[55:11] own amen everything that's given to me
[55:14] because I know God is with me in the
[55:18] myths and yet of his trials in the midst
[55:20] of his trials or when we say his own
[55:21] personal sins and shortcomings God was
[55:25] with him
[55:26] now soon after he stole these blessings
[55:29] the two blessings Jacob became conscious
[55:32] of his guilt and he was afraid of the
[55:34] anger of Esau who was going to kill him
[55:36] he'll ever we know he was going to
[55:38] murder his brother mine and then he left
[55:41] to Haran which was four hundred miles
[55:44] away to find a wife how many miles would
[55:47] you run if somebody wanted to kill you
[55:49] he said I'm leaving four hundred miles
[55:52] away and he didn't have a car to do it
[55:54] he couldn't jump on the Greyhound four
[55:57] hundred miles he was driven a church I
[56:00] said like this he was driven by the Holy
[56:02] Spirit because there was a wife out
[56:05] there praise God wives we know in this
[56:07] case which God's not in polygamy now but
[56:09] there's wives out there there was a
[56:11] family God was trying to establish a
[56:13] godly family remember this is not long
[56:16] after the flood and Babel and God wants
[56:20] to establish a people that will be
[56:22] kingdom of priests unto Him amen he's
[56:25] had servants you know Enoch and and
[56:28] different ones and Adam and and and all
[56:30] all the descendants that is descendants
[56:32] of of Seth and all these a sentence he's
[56:35] had faithful servants Noah but he wants
[56:37] to establish a kingdom a kingdom that's
[56:39] in order a kingdom that approaches God a
[56:43] kingdom that knows his word amen and so
[56:46] this is the beginning of God wanting to
[56:48] build this king of this this natural
[56:51] nation we'd say and so God is sending
[56:54] him out there even the midst of his
[56:55] trial God is using his shortcomings and
[56:57] weaknesses to bring about the per
[56:59] will of God amen 400 miles alright and
[57:06] there you know he meets Rachel and
[57:08] Rachel has the same type of character as
[57:10] Rebecca because we remember Rebecca was
[57:13] the one who just watered the camels in
[57:15] here
[57:16] Rachel helps helps him with the Sheep
[57:19] and he helps roll away the stone you
[57:21] know to help Rachel and we see the same
[57:23] type of sacrificial love between these
[57:25] real believers this this helpful this
[57:31] eternal life characteristics where we're
[57:34] able to help those in need we're led of
[57:36] the Spirit of God to offer help we want
[57:39] to be a blessing to others we want our
[57:41] life to count not hurting others about
[57:43] helping others we don't want to take
[57:46] from others we want to give to others we
[57:49] want people after leaving our presidents
[57:51] to say my I was blessed to be around
[57:53] them I wasn't felt like I was I lost my
[57:56] dignity or I lost my my sense of the
[57:58] Holy Spirit but they added something
[58:00] godly to my life amen that's what we
[58:03] want to do church we want to add value
[58:05] to people's lives and so we see the same
[58:07] attribute in Jacob and Rachel and
[58:10] Rebecca willing to help Anne and God
[58:13] answer their prayers praise the Lord now
[58:17] look at this let's go back to our text
[58:19] Genesis 29 most of us know the story
[58:21] pretty well but I just want to bring out
[58:23] some of these thoughts on Leah love to
[58:26] the Lord and we'll try to look at this
[58:27] by the grace of the one I don't think
[58:29] I've ever preached on Leah as far as I
[58:30] know I could be wrong but Genesis 29 our
[58:36] text verse 15 and Laban said unto Jacob
[58:39] because thou art my brother should us
[58:41] now therefore serve me not tell me what
[58:43] shall I wages be and Laban had two
[58:47] daughters the name of the elder was Leah
[58:49] and the name of the younger was Rachel
[58:52] leah was tender eyed but Rachel was
[58:54] beautiful and well favored and Jacob
[58:57] loved Rachel and said I will serve these
[58:58] seven years for Rachel thy younger
[59:01] daughter now we're given you know all
[59:04] these descriptions here we just want to
[59:07] make sure we we note them here
[59:10] some of us of course we're from
[59:12] with this but Jacob you know he he needs
[59:16] some work and God provides him work when
[59:18] a man needs work God will provide work
[59:19] for him let me know that a man he's
[59:22] Jehovah Jireh hallelujah but we see Leah
[59:27] you know she was the oldest of the girls
[59:29] you know and she wasn't as pretty as
[59:32] Rachel she had younger sisters that were
[59:34] pretty you know Rachel was prettier
[59:36] tender I'd you know some I read a few
[59:38] commentaries and maybe her eyes were
[59:40] weak or maybe she had trouble with her
[59:42] eyes or means more delicate maybe she
[59:44] was more sensitive there was something
[59:47] about Leah you know that she just wasn't
[59:49] as pretty wasn't as well favored may
[59:51] seem like maybe she had a physical
[59:53] problem or something with their eyes and
[59:55] something like that but she was the
[59:58] oldest but yet wasn't the prettiest and
[1:00:01] so everybody knows that because Rachel
[1:00:04] had all the favor in the family all the
[1:00:06] siblings would say well Rachel's the
[1:00:08] golden child Rachel's the the mom and
[1:00:11] dad's favorite and everybody kind of
[1:00:13] knew that in town you know they'd say oh
[1:00:16] there's there's the there's laymen's
[1:00:18] family oh there's Rachel look how pretty
[1:00:20] she is well she's so pretty
[1:00:24] remember God's not interested so much
[1:00:26] and who's the prettiest or the strongest
[1:00:28] or most handsome
[1:00:29] God wants a heart that is hungry for to
[1:00:33] know the heart of God that's what God is
[1:00:36] most concerned about you know one of my
[1:00:39] siblings always gave me a hard time and
[1:00:40] said well Jesse's the golden child of
[1:00:42] the family you know and I've never
[1:00:45] claimed that and I think I hope there
[1:00:47] was no bitterness in those statements
[1:00:48] but you know it was just it was just the
[1:00:51] favor of God on my family and and God
[1:00:53] giving us grace and different gifts and
[1:00:55] whatever gifts were given
[1:00:57] we've just got to give it to Christ and
[1:01:00] God no matter no matter what the no
[1:01:02] matter what we're gifted naturally
[1:01:04] whether we're more favored or not one
[1:01:06] thing temptation is common to every man
[1:01:09] no matter how strong or handsome or
[1:01:12] pretty you are we've all got to go
[1:01:14] through the same types of temptations
[1:01:16] and we've all got to overcome by the
[1:01:18] grace of God and you have to remember
[1:01:21] you're not the only one who's gone
[1:01:23] through this you are not alone there's
[1:01:25] someone like
[1:01:26] you who's gone through the same
[1:01:28] situation that you went through you say
[1:01:31] well I don't know anybody it doesn't
[1:01:32] matter remember with the Queen of Sheba
[1:01:33] God can go back a thousand years and
[1:01:35] pull up somebody from a thousand years
[1:01:37] ago it said they went through the exact
[1:01:38] same thing you did and you've got to
[1:01:40] honor God despite your situation in
[1:01:44] other words you've got to take courage
[1:01:45] from those who have done it you've got
[1:01:47] to remember there's no excuses God
[1:01:49] offers us the Bible says in 2nd Peter
[1:01:51] chapter 1 God has given us all things
[1:01:53] that pertain to life and godliness amen
[1:01:58] everything we need to live in this world
[1:02:01] and to be godly and overcome the trials
[1:02:04] that have been placed before us
[1:02:05] everything we have need of has already
[1:02:07] been given to us but we've got to
[1:02:08] receive it hallelujah we've just got to
[1:02:11] receive it that's what we have to do and
[1:02:14] so Lia
[1:02:14] maybe she had a rough start to life
[1:02:16] maybe you know what her name means
[1:02:18] wearied weary so when her mother birthd
[1:02:22] her she was weary because that's that's
[1:02:25] the whole pattern of all Rachel's
[1:02:27] children and lia whatever they were
[1:02:29] feeling at that moment that's what they
[1:02:31] named them so maybe it was a long labor
[1:02:34] I don't know what it was any of the
[1:02:35] pregnant mothers weary I know my wife's
[1:02:37] getting there they all get that way at
[1:02:40] the end right they just can't I remember
[1:02:42] they owe me just saying I can't wait
[1:02:44] till the baby comes I can't wait and the
[1:02:46] baby finally got here and then the Bible
[1:02:48] said we rejoiced for joy that a child's
[1:02:51] were brought into the world but from her
[1:02:53] beginning she was known as the wearied
[1:02:57] one what a beginning this child has been
[1:03:01] a burden this child didn't come in with
[1:03:04] all the celebration this baby is pretty
[1:03:06] but not as pretty as the other one that
[1:03:08] we had look how beautiful ray chose you
[1:03:11] got the baby pictures up on the wall
[1:03:13] ones real beautiful you know maybe
[1:03:15] another one's not so pretty something
[1:03:17] about or tender I just wasn't just
[1:03:20] wasn't as beautiful as Rachel and church
[1:03:24] we want to we want to relate to that
[1:03:26] because I think we can all relate to
[1:03:27] that well there's more pretty women than
[1:03:29] me there's more handsome men than me
[1:03:32] right we could all relate to that
[1:03:34] there's families that seem that they
[1:03:37] just got it better off than we do
[1:03:39] praise the Lord there's churches that
[1:03:41] they just got it better off than we do
[1:03:43] churches have bigger buildings than we
[1:03:45] do where churches that have much better
[1:03:48] pastors than we do or a pastor you know
[1:03:51] I'm just gonna keeping it light you know
[1:03:53] we can all in all ways we can all make
[1:03:56] excuses have hurt someone's got better
[1:03:57] than me well I just had a harder than
[1:04:00] everybody else my life so hard God
[1:04:03] wasn't interested in letting Leah feel
[1:04:05] that way but her trials did play a big
[1:04:09] part in her spiritual life now and as we
[1:04:13] go through this message just think about
[1:04:15] this think about who seems more
[1:04:18] spiritual as we go through these
[1:04:19] scriptures about Leah and Rachel who
[1:04:21] seems more spiritual is it the beautiful
[1:04:25] one and everybody loved and all she's
[1:04:28] just the queen all the guys would like
[1:04:31] to court her or is it this Leah this
[1:04:35] kind of misfit rejected woman who seems
[1:04:39] more spiritual and we know God is not a
[1:04:43] respecter of persons so God didn't care
[1:04:46] if Rachel was more beautiful or Leah was
[1:04:48] more beautiful God didn't care what God
[1:04:50] wanted was for them to submit to his
[1:04:52] word for their lives that's what that's
[1:04:54] what he always wants and so she was
[1:04:58] tender eyed Rachel beautiful
[1:04:59] well favored now if you know the
[1:05:01] scripture Jacob was fifty years old when
[1:05:03] he tried to marry Rachel but he got
[1:05:06] tricked
[1:05:06] fifty Esau got married at 40 remember he
[1:05:11] married the pagan women and so the Bible
[1:05:13] said it grieved the spirit of Isaac and
[1:05:16] Rebekah Oh
[1:05:17] our children didn't marry in the message
[1:05:18] my or my son didn't marry in the message
[1:05:21] they just grieve them because they knew
[1:05:23] whatever you surround yourself with
[1:05:24] that's what you're going to become
[1:05:26] unless God reaches down there and
[1:05:28] someone cries out to God they're going
[1:05:30] to become the the atmosphere that they
[1:05:32] create themselves and we have no excuse
[1:05:35] right because we are miniature mini
[1:05:37] creators
[1:05:38] we've got to create the atmosphere by
[1:05:40] the power of the Holy Spirit by casting
[1:05:43] down imaginations and anything that
[1:05:45] exalts itself against the Word of God we
[1:05:47] must create that atmosphere amen
[1:05:51] fifty years old and you also see a lot
[1:05:54] of God's grace in here God's grace to
[1:05:57] Jacob as well because although God loved
[1:05:59] Jacob Jacob was not always a good man he
[1:06:01] was pretty pretty disagreeable man
[1:06:05] sometimes just like us we can all look
[1:06:08] at our flesh and say oh what a wretched
[1:06:10] just like Paul said what a wretched man
[1:06:11] am I
[1:06:12] how many can say amen to that there's
[1:06:15] times I feel like a wretched person
[1:06:16] there's times I don't feel like I'm
[1:06:18] gonna make the rapture there's times I
[1:06:21] feel like how can I even be a Christian
[1:06:22] for the Bramson there were times like
[1:06:24] that he didn't feel like a Christian
[1:06:26] right there's times we don't feel
[1:06:30] necessarily like that because we get in
[1:06:32] the flesh and Satan tricks us sir we
[1:06:35] willingly disobey against God but see
[1:06:38] the thing about a Christian is that they
[1:06:40] go back to the throne of God and the
[1:06:42] Bible said their spirits are renewed day
[1:06:44] by day and the brother was asking me
[1:06:47] overseas from Africa he said he said can
[1:06:49] the Holy Ghost to a person sin and I
[1:06:50] said of course but they will not stay as
[1:06:53] long as someone who doesn't have the
[1:06:55] Holy Ghost and they will not go as far
[1:06:57] as someone who has the Holy Ghost and he
[1:06:59] said praise God after he wrote me those
[1:07:01] words he said I went out in the
[1:07:02] wilderness seeking God he says our
[1:07:04] weeping cry he said the Holy Ghost fell
[1:07:06] on me out there after you gave me those
[1:07:08] words so I thought glory somebody's
[1:07:10] gonna get the Holy Ghost through this
[1:07:12] word whether I hope it's here too as
[1:07:14] well amen but we want it everywhere we
[1:07:17] want all God's children to be birthed to
[1:07:19] life amen
[1:07:22] so we're thankful by the grace of the
[1:07:25] Lord so he wants he said I'd like to
[1:07:27] really marry Rachel and Laban tricks him
[1:07:30] and says of course you can and then on
[1:07:33] the wedding night you know we know
[1:07:34] there's the switch and and Laban takes
[1:07:37] Leah and puts a veil on her and and can
[1:07:40] you imagine the morning in Genesis 29 25
[1:07:43] and it came to pass in that morning
[1:07:45] behold it was Leah and he said to Laban
[1:07:47] what is this thou hast done unto me
[1:07:50] did I not serve thee for Rachel where
[1:07:52] for then hast thou beguiled me now put
[1:07:55] yourself in Lea's situation she's kind
[1:07:57] of forced into this and of course she
[1:07:59] loved Jacob the Bible said she did love
[1:08:00] Jacob godly man like that and here they
[1:08:06] have their wedding night and the very
[1:08:07] first thing in the morning can you
[1:08:09] imagine husband or spouse can you
[1:08:10] imagine this what what a what a
[1:08:13] honeymoon this might have been nah he
[1:08:16] storms out and said what what do you
[1:08:18] mean and then she's just left there all
[1:08:20] alone in church I said I just for seven
[1:08:23] years she feels all alone and many years
[1:08:27] beyond that she felt all alone not only
[1:08:30] did she feel alone we're gonna look in
[1:08:32] the scripture
[1:08:33] she felt hated what's the greatest day
[1:08:38] of your life sisters today get married
[1:08:41] right I had our children at school right
[1:08:43] when does mom look pretty and they all
[1:08:45] wrote all that in her wedding pictures
[1:08:46] you know or whatever or when they go to
[1:08:48] church you know think about you feel the
[1:08:51] most pretty on your wedding day and then
[1:08:53] the next day your husband walks out I
[1:08:54] didn't want to marry her
[1:08:56] she's not the one I wanted can you
[1:08:59] imagine that
[1:09:00] and yet God still look down and Leah and
[1:09:03] loved her God let her go through this
[1:09:06] because it was going to produce
[1:09:08] something later on in her because the
[1:09:11] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:09:13] of the Lord God saw something in Leah
[1:09:17] that maybe Leah didn't even see inside
[1:09:18] of herself there was a character in here
[1:09:22] there was such a spiritual godly
[1:09:24] character remember God will not give you
[1:09:27] a test that you cannot overcome amen so
[1:09:32] God knew Leah could go through a test of
[1:09:34] being alone and hated but she would
[1:09:37] overcome it by the grace of God amen the
[1:09:41] church if you feel alone or if you feel
[1:09:43] hated or rejected there's hope for you
[1:09:45] if there's hope for Leah there's hope
[1:09:47] for you and I this morning amen because
[1:09:50] God is the same God and he she wasn't
[1:09:53] you know being mistreated by a young man
[1:09:55] he was fifty years old I hope I got some
[1:09:59] wisdom by the time I'm 50 you know I
[1:10:01] believe I do but you know just think
[1:10:02] about that he's a fifty year old man
[1:10:04] it's gonna be a patriarch
[1:10:06] can all these things his grandfather was
[1:10:08] Abraham yet Abraham's grandson hates me
[1:10:13] think about the mind battles the devil
[1:10:15] would bring in there the father of the
[1:10:18] faith
[1:10:19] his grandson hates you think of all the
[1:10:23] lies Satan could whisper and what's
[1:10:25] happened to keep doing cast it down cast
[1:10:28] it down she had to been a woman of
[1:10:30] Prayer by when we see that because of
[1:10:33] how she names her children later on she
[1:10:38] had to been a tremendous prayer warrior
[1:10:40] and now we know how it goes in the
[1:10:43] scripture the custom was layman said
[1:10:46] well no the custom is I can't break the
[1:10:47] customs you know I got all these customs
[1:10:51] why he said I got to give the oldest
[1:10:54] first he said work seven more years and
[1:10:57] so he fulfills Rachel's week as well now
[1:11:03] think about this Leah had him for seven
[1:11:09] years we'd say but the whole time he's
[1:11:11] gotten googly eyes looking over at
[1:11:12] Rachel the Bible said it just seemed
[1:11:14] like a few days to Jacob so she's like
[1:11:17] come on hubby let's go to let's go to
[1:11:19] bed all right let's go let's go to our
[1:11:20] home and she's he's out there on the
[1:11:22] rake you know working out there oh she's
[1:11:25] beautiful
[1:11:26] and he comes in and he's off I'll be
[1:11:30] marrying Rachel pretty soon imaginet see
[1:11:36] Satan could have used that to drive her
[1:11:38] to hate Jacob but instead God in His
[1:11:41] grace allowed her to become a prayer
[1:11:42] warrior think about that how would it
[1:11:47] feel to be the unloved wife or what's it
[1:11:49] like this maybe the unloved child maybe
[1:11:51] Rachel got more love even from her
[1:11:53] parents we don't know but she was well
[1:11:55] favored more beautiful more attention so
[1:12:00] she knew already as these first seven
[1:12:02] years before Rachel came you know as
[1:12:04] part of the family she knew I'm the
[1:12:06] unloved wife and church that proves
[1:12:09] sometimes women suffer from feeling
[1:12:12] unloved and you have to forgive me
[1:12:17] every year I buy the mother's flowers
[1:12:18] and I forgot yesterday so forgive me so
[1:12:20] Connie I'm sorry those you've been here
[1:12:22] a few years I've given your roses you
[1:12:24] know so forgive me I just forgot but I
[1:12:26] didn't have time this morning so ah
[1:12:28] maybe next week maybe next year we'll
[1:12:30] see I can get to it by like you know on
[1:12:33] the holidays like to give the children
[1:12:35] gifts you know and just let them know we
[1:12:36] appreciate them mothers we appreciate
[1:12:38] you but you know women suffer from being
[1:12:42] unloved and sometimes they're victims of
[1:12:46] unhappy marriages and it's not even
[1:12:49] their fault this was not Leah's fault
[1:12:52] it's not fault she it's not her fault
[1:12:54] she was tender eyed or if this was a
[1:12:55] birth defect or whatever this was that's
[1:12:58] not her fault she was a godly woman and
[1:13:01] it wasn't her fault but this is a the
[1:13:04] situation allowed her to have a test or
[1:13:07] trial that seemed like like like Satan
[1:13:09] may overcome her but she had a choice do
[1:13:12] I stay with the Word of God or do I just
[1:13:14] trust my feelings thank God she didn't
[1:13:16] trust those feelings amen
[1:13:17] thank God she didn't trust the wretched
[1:13:20] woman that was inside of her that sin
[1:13:22] nature thank God she still feared the
[1:13:24] Lord amen so sometimes brothers there's
[1:13:31] things that happened it's not your fault
[1:13:32] but you're an awful situation maybe
[1:13:34] marriage family sisters sometimes it's
[1:13:37] not your fault but you're an awful
[1:13:38] situation and that's how Leah was she's
[1:13:41] an example of that we're never given any
[1:13:43] reason to believe that she was not
[1:13:44] faithful to God she just wasn't as
[1:13:47] pretty this wasn't as maybe favored as
[1:13:51] Rachel and so first the first seven
[1:13:54] years she just I just want him to love
[1:13:56] me I just want him to think about me I
[1:13:58] just want him to I just want to feel
[1:14:01] loved now let's go to Genesis 29 let's
[1:14:07] go back there by the grace of Lord to
[1:14:10] read a few more scriptures here and this
[1:14:16] proves got to let you go through very
[1:14:17] long silent seasons so how many think um
[1:14:22] seven years was easy on Leah do you
[1:14:25] think that first seven years before you
[1:14:26] married Rachel I think that was easy on
[1:14:28] her
[1:14:28] probably not look at verse 31 says 29 31
[1:14:37] and when the Lord saw that leah was
[1:14:39] hated he opened her womb but Rachel was
[1:14:46] barren my god there's God and his
[1:14:50] fatherly love
[1:14:51] he said Leah that's my daughter down
[1:14:53] there she's been hated for 7 years can
[1:15:00] you imagine me and hated and rejected
[1:15:01] for 7 years by the one who's supposed to
[1:15:04] love you sometimes life is very
[1:15:08] difficult or we remember God sometimes
[1:15:11] lets us go through testings of seasons
[1:15:14] to produce something godly within us and
[1:15:18] we've just got to go through that
[1:15:19] situation we've just got to trust even
[1:15:21] though I don't feel him I know he's
[1:15:23] there but like we preached a few weeks
[1:15:27] ago the tests of life was that last
[1:15:29] Sunday night the test of life sometimes
[1:15:32] God like job said I go forward he's not
[1:15:35] there I step back he's not there I go to
[1:15:39] my right he's not there job said I go to
[1:15:40] my left he's not there
[1:15:41] he said he's hid his face from me but he
[1:15:44] said the Lord knows my steps amen
[1:15:47] he might hide his anointing he might
[1:15:48] hide as his voice or that spiritual
[1:15:51] intimacy that you desire but church
[1:15:53] you've got to know he's right there with
[1:15:54] you hallelujah
[1:16:00] so God sees his little daughter being
[1:16:03] hated isn't it striking Jacob have I
[1:16:05] loved Esau have I hated Jacob was loved
[1:16:09] but then in his flesh he hated his own
[1:16:11] wife loved by God hated his own wife for
[1:16:14] awhile there's no there's no doubt he
[1:16:16] could not have hated her and then saying
[1:16:18] because Jesus tells us later what is the
[1:16:21] spirit of hatred Jesus says if you hate
[1:16:23] somebody without a cause to murder let
[1:16:26] me know that that's what Jesus says if
[1:16:29] you hate somebody with no cause you just
[1:16:30] murdered them so Jacob at some point
[1:16:33] would have got delivered from that
[1:16:38] and so see he developed a hatred for
[1:16:42] Leah why was I given her I didn't even
[1:16:45] work for her never wanted her in the
[1:16:47] first place a man loved by God
[1:16:51] caught up in hate now a church member
[1:16:54] that's four before the baptism of the
[1:16:55] holy ghost if we hate each other here
[1:16:58] that's that's no excuse we've got more
[1:17:00] power available than Jacob had and the
[1:17:02] church said we've got much more power
[1:17:05] praise God
[1:17:06] we've got living power we've got
[1:17:09] life-changing power we've got
[1:17:11] resurrection power amen hallelujah
[1:17:13] there's no excuses today remember every
[1:17:16] promise of life and godliness is given
[1:17:18] to us it's exactly right that was verse
[1:17:24] twenty and thirty one God how do you God
[1:17:29] saw God saw how me know God sees you in
[1:17:33] the midst of your hard seasons aren't
[1:17:35] you glad God sees you the Bible says his
[1:17:37] eyes run to and fro upon the whole face
[1:17:40] of the earth
[1:17:41] God is watching over us today God is
[1:17:45] watching over you today you're never out
[1:17:47] of his sight Church let's say praise the
[1:17:49] Lord can we say that praise the Lord he
[1:17:52] were never out of his sight he's always
[1:17:55] watching us even seven years of being
[1:17:57] hated 7 years of being rejected 7 years
[1:18:01] of being the misfit and what 17 complete
[1:18:04] she was completely rejected completely
[1:18:07] hated a whole season of her life 7 years
[1:18:10] a week rejected so God said I'm gonna
[1:18:17] open your womb I'm gonna bless you with
[1:18:21] children but the Bible said Rachel was
[1:18:25] barren let's go to verse 32 so it would
[1:18:30] seem like after seven years of praying
[1:18:33] and being in the valley of decision and
[1:18:35] being hated and battling Satan and all
[1:18:38] these things God here's God Caesar God
[1:18:41] answers verse 32 and Leah conceived
[1:18:44] embarrassed son and she called his name
[1:18:45] Reuben Reuben means behold a son
[1:18:51] for she said surely the Lord have looked
[1:18:54] upon my affliction now therefore my
[1:18:59] husband will love me so now we know what
[1:19:01] she's been battling or at least some
[1:19:04] time but part of the seven years I've
[1:19:07] been afflicted how she been afflicted a
[1:19:11] husband that doesn't love her she's been
[1:19:14] tormented right that's that's many of
[1:19:16] the torments we have in America we're
[1:19:18] not physically tormented people aren't
[1:19:20] hunting us down we know it may happen
[1:19:21] later but see Church the things we go
[1:19:24] through many times are an affliction
[1:19:26] it's a test it's a trial how people
[1:19:29] treat us mistreat us it's an affliction
[1:19:31] and it's affliction we've got to
[1:19:33] overcome we've got to ask God give me
[1:19:35] that balm of Gilead so I can be healed
[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:38] it's an affliction it's a literal battle
[1:19:42] that you're going to have to ask God to
[1:19:44] give you grace to overcome de menthe and
[1:19:46] Churchill here your humble cry if he
[1:19:49] heard Leah if he heard Hagar even Hagar
[1:19:51] crying out for water for a child if he
[1:19:54] heard a Hagar and Egyptian made and then
[1:19:56] he hears Leah a rejected Israelite here
[1:19:59] if he heard them how much more will he
[1:20:01] hear you and I praise God and word of
[1:20:03] the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:20:06] mine I also have one in these last seven
[1:20:12] years if my husband would just love me
[1:20:13] if if he would just love me now for us
[1:20:15] it might be if someone would just love
[1:20:17] me or if my children would just love me
[1:20:20] or my mother or father my husband or
[1:20:22] whoever
[1:20:22] my wife would just love me we just want
[1:20:24] loved and so God answers and said I've
[1:20:27] heard your cry I'm giving you a son and
[1:20:29] she brings forth a sudden she's behold a
[1:20:32] son everybody behold God has given me a
[1:20:35] son God has blessed me because remember
[1:20:38] in those days Society declared that a
[1:20:41] woman's prestige depended upon her
[1:20:44] success of bearing sons in other words
[1:20:46] you are not a real woman unless you had
[1:20:48] males I'm glad it's not the same way
[1:20:52] today well you were she would look me
[1:20:56] look down upon she would be disrespected
[1:21:00] all there must be a curse against you
[1:21:01] you can't pretty
[1:21:03] any sons god let's not love you and the
[1:21:06] whole time God did love her but God was
[1:21:08] taking her through the 7 years of fiery
[1:21:10] affliction to produce a christ-like
[1:21:13] character can I say like that a
[1:21:14] christ-like character so we can relate
[1:21:17] to it I want you to notice in these next
[1:21:23] few verses they're gonna go through her
[1:21:25] first four sons we've already gone
[1:21:26] through Ruben notice that God meets her
[1:21:30] needs and notice three things about her
[1:21:32] character
[1:21:32] I like this God had provided these sons
[1:21:36] in a response to her affliction and
[1:21:39] unloved condition so these are ways that
[1:21:45] God is using to encourage Leah I notice
[1:21:48] God just didn't stop after one say well
[1:21:50] one son is enough you should be happy
[1:21:51] with that
[1:21:53] look how merciful God is God keeps
[1:21:55] bringing blessing after blessing after
[1:21:57] blessing church it's undeserved but God
[1:22:00] keeps giving us blessing after her
[1:22:02] blessing we fall back into this
[1:22:04] depression we fall back into affliction
[1:22:06] we fall back into not feeling love we
[1:22:08] fall back into that and God keeps
[1:22:10] blessing us time after time we ought to
[1:22:12] praise the Lord Amen hallelujah
[1:22:15] he just keeps encouraging us we have the
[1:22:18] same thing over and over again I gotta
[1:22:20] go through this again
[1:22:21] go through that feeling again go through
[1:22:22] that mistreatment again I keep going
[1:22:24] through that God hear my prayer God is
[1:22:26] so faithful he cares for you he cares
[1:22:29] for me amen glory not just one I'll keep
[1:22:34] quiet that's not how God was just keep
[1:22:35] quiet I gave you Reuben God's like I'm
[1:22:38] still listening let me give you another
[1:22:39] well I still hear you Leah I still hear
[1:22:42] you I love you I'm letting you go
[1:22:44] through this it's gonna produce a godly
[1:22:46] character I'm doing something here Leah
[1:22:49] you won't see it your lifetime but
[1:22:51] you'll see an eternity yeah amen you'll
[1:22:55] see part of it in your lifetime but the
[1:22:57] half has not been told of what I've been
[1:22:59] doing for you amen where we saw that the
[1:23:03] rainbow on Wednesday night we just see
[1:23:05] half of the rainbow but in heaven
[1:23:06] there's a full rainbow around the throne
[1:23:08] and Branson because that's the half has
[1:23:10] not been told about what Jesus Christ
[1:23:12] has done for you and I amen
[1:23:15] glory
[1:23:17] second we see that throughout all these
[1:23:20] children she just wants to be loved
[1:23:22] there's one thing she wants in life it's
[1:23:24] not money it's not riches it's not Fame
[1:23:26] she just wants to be loved by her
[1:23:28] husband god I just want one thing if I
[1:23:31] could just have this one thing in my
[1:23:33] life and God keeps letting her struggle
[1:23:35] with this I just want my husband to love
[1:23:39] me Lord he's called to love me the you
[1:23:43] know he could go back to scripture you
[1:23:45] know Adams supposed to cleave to his
[1:23:47] wife Lord why doesn't my husband cleave
[1:23:49] to me he's a man of God say Lord I
[1:23:54] believe your word I'm trying to believe
[1:23:56] I'm trying to do everything I can I just
[1:23:57] want someone to love me hey man I'll
[1:24:02] they do you look at the second child
[1:24:05] number 33 Simeon and she conceived again
[1:24:11] and bare a son and said because the LORD
[1:24:13] hath heard that I was hated he had
[1:24:16] therefore given me this son also and she
[1:24:18] called his name Simeon which means
[1:24:22] hearing the Lord has heard me so even
[1:24:26] after one shout i've got baby reuben
[1:24:28] over here jacob and he's like what you
[1:24:29] say leah hold on I gotta go talk to
[1:24:31] Rachel
[1:24:32] would you want to come huh you want to
[1:24:35] come watch hold the babies you want to
[1:24:36] take a family photo we're gonna go down
[1:24:38] there and take a family portrait you
[1:24:40] know she's like he's like nah I just
[1:24:42] yeah thank God I just want to be with
[1:24:45] Rachel so she cries out to God God I'm
[1:24:48] not being loved god I've got this baby
[1:24:50] Reuben Lord I need you to answer my cry
[1:24:54] and so God sends her another Simeon and
[1:24:56] she says now the Lord has heard me I've
[1:24:59] asked God for this child God has given
[1:25:01] me this child see since she couldn't
[1:25:06] since she wasn't being loved in the
[1:25:08] president God was giving her children
[1:25:10] that would bless her in the future right
[1:25:13] because that's what the Bible said with
[1:25:14] when you have a property one woman your
[1:25:16] children will grow up and call you
[1:25:18] blessed and they'll praise you Reuben
[1:25:20] was really zealous for his mother Leah
[1:25:22] he did some awful things he slept with
[1:25:24] some his father's concubine because of
[1:25:27] that just to get back at Jacob
[1:25:30] her children loved her although Jacob
[1:25:33] did not so much at the beginning of
[1:25:34] course there would have had to been some
[1:25:36] kind of reconciliation at the end we
[1:25:38] know that there would have had to been
[1:25:41] in is is that is that something God has
[1:25:45] heard me
[1:25:45] I bring forth a child it's another son I
[1:25:48] know God has heard me her prayers must
[1:25:50] have been God give me another son as
[1:25:52] vindication that you hear me in the
[1:25:55] myths of me being unloved feeling alone
[1:25:57] feeling rejected being afflicted by
[1:26:00] these relationship I I constantly have I
[1:26:02] just can't get out of them give me a son
[1:26:04] to show me that you heard me and God
[1:26:06] gives her another son named Simeon hey
[1:26:08] man oh that's the God we serve amen and
[1:26:12] the whole time he's like that's nice had
[1:26:15] another son all right that's okay let me
[1:26:17] go take a vacation with Rachel or
[1:26:18] whatever you know what I mean he just
[1:26:21] gives all he's just hated her look at
[1:26:25] verse 34 and she conceived again and
[1:26:29] bare a son and said now this time my
[1:26:32] husband will be joined unto me I don't
[1:26:34] know if it happened right here I believe
[1:26:36] it happened at some point you know why
[1:26:38] cuz brother BAM said divine love the
[1:26:40] only thing that's gonna make it over
[1:26:41] there and although they couldn't
[1:26:43] received the baptism Holy Ghost they
[1:26:44] would had to have some type of
[1:26:45] reconciliation before going over there
[1:26:48] you say prove it I I'd be happy to Saul
[1:26:50] and David attend their lives they made
[1:26:52] everything right didn't they before Saul
[1:26:54] went off the scene they made everything
[1:26:56] right so eventually after years of
[1:26:58] having a murderous evil spirit on him he
[1:27:01] finally repented said David and there
[1:27:02] came a day after all those was at 14 or
[1:27:05] 7 years of chasing David there came a
[1:27:07] day when he didn't go after David
[1:27:08] anymore he'd finally buried the hatchet
[1:27:11] we'd say her offer asked for forgiveness
[1:27:13] he find that was right before God took
[1:27:16] him off the scene so this third child
[1:27:21] named Levi because I borne him three
[1:27:24] sons therefore was his name called Levi
[1:27:26] Levi means joined another word is
[1:27:30] adhesion so she's trusting Lord now that
[1:27:34] I have had three boys now my husband
[1:27:37] will cleave to me now it'll happen and
[1:27:39] we know it might not have happened right
[1:27:41] away
[1:27:43] look at verse 35 and she conceived again
[1:27:47] and bare a son and she said now well I'm
[1:27:50] sorry
[1:27:51] now will I praise the Lord therefore she
[1:27:54] called his name Judah and then left
[1:27:57] bearing now we know Judah means praise
[1:28:01] how many know that by God's grace Judah
[1:28:06] when he got older this was interesting
[1:28:07] Jude when he got older he interceded in
[1:28:10] the behalf of Joseph so that his life
[1:28:12] was spared so look at Judah the praise
[1:28:16] there he intercedes for Joseph which we
[1:28:19] know is a perfect
[1:28:20] I'm sorry almost perfect type of Christ
[1:28:22] and the Bible said yet he took a lead in
[1:28:26] the family affairs and prevailed above
[1:28:28] all his brethren the praise of God did
[1:28:32] that and that's striking the praise she
[1:28:35] finally get to the spot where now no
[1:28:37] doubt she was thankful before but now
[1:28:39] with this fourth son she just started
[1:28:41] giving God praise Thank You Jehovah
[1:28:43] hallelujah Jehovah praise be to Jehovah
[1:28:46] she just said I'm gonna praise and his
[1:28:48] name will always be praised every time
[1:28:50] they said Judah God was being praised
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:52] every time and they said where's Judah
[1:28:55] where's Judah Oh baby Judah every time
[1:28:57] they said that God was being praised
[1:28:59] praise praise praise glory and I'll
[1:29:02] Judah came David and out of David came
[1:29:05] Christ hallelujah
[1:29:06] the Lion of the tribe of Judah glory
[1:29:11] whom all the earth Christ whom all the
[1:29:14] earth will worship with praise the very
[1:29:17] object of all praise comes out of Judah
[1:29:20] oh my that's beautiful glorious go to
[1:29:26] verse chapter 30 verse five and six now
[1:29:31] Rachel enemies lead us so much she felt
[1:29:33] like she could die because she wanted a
[1:29:35] child so badly and Jacobs like oh my god
[1:29:39] that I can give you a child
[1:29:41] that's how desperate she was the very
[1:29:44] one that loved he loved her so well we
[1:29:46] got because of her own God closing her
[1:29:48] womb and and she accuses him yet you're
[1:29:51] the one not giving me the child and
[1:29:52] Jacobs like it's God these things are
[1:29:54] done in God's time not our time
[1:29:58] so Rachel gives her made Billa
[1:30:01] which means troubled and it definitely
[1:30:02] caused a lot of trouble he gave or she
[1:30:06] gave her to Jacob and brought forth Dan
[1:30:08] and Naphtali now look at the way she
[1:30:11] names the children compared to Leah she
[1:30:14] names Dan where God has judged me or
[1:30:17] vindicated me so she want to be
[1:30:21] vindicated in front of Leah and then
[1:30:25] Naphtali means prevailed so she felt now
[1:30:28] I've won over Leah because there was
[1:30:32] constant arguing between them and
[1:30:34] bickering now so far based upon the
[1:30:38] names who seems more spiritual now
[1:30:41] Leah's praying to God interceding Xand
[1:30:44] God remember me I'll praise your name
[1:30:47] you know she wears rachel says I feel
[1:30:49] vindicated I prevailed over my sister
[1:30:53] oh my interesting now you know the story
[1:31:00] Leah took Zilpah to maid in verse 9 and
[1:31:07] gave her Jacob to life and she brings
[1:31:12] forth gad a troupe named gad and then in
[1:31:18] verse 12 and 13 comes forth Ashur so
[1:31:24] four from Leah and then two from Leah's
[1:31:28] made we've already got the two from
[1:31:30] Rachel so we're getting pretty pretty
[1:31:32] big family now I was like to take care
[1:31:35] of all those children run around the
[1:31:36] house I'd like that
[1:31:38] look at that go down to verse 22 here
[1:31:45] and God
[1:31:48] Rachel and God hearkened to her and
[1:31:50] opened her womb
[1:31:52] so God lets for children from Leah -
[1:31:56] from the maid - from another maid so now
[1:31:59] she's witnessed what 8 and Rachel's like
[1:32:02] when is it my turn Lord when am I gonna
[1:32:04] be blessed and God let her go through
[1:32:05] this all these heartache and all this
[1:32:08] wandering in trials and God finally
[1:32:11] Harkins - Rachel opens our womb and she
[1:32:15] conceived and bare a son and said God
[1:32:16] hath taken away my reproach and she
[1:32:20] called his name Joseph hey men and said
[1:32:24] the Lord should add to me another son
[1:32:27] see how that Holy Spirit's right there
[1:32:29] that the Lord is prophetic now she said
[1:32:32] oh I'm gonna have one more I wonder if
[1:32:33] she was like a prophetess and Saul
[1:32:35] visions but somehow she knew I'm gonna
[1:32:38] have one more I've had Joseph I'm gonna
[1:32:40] have one more and it was prophetic to
[1:32:43] her she knew God would give her one more
[1:32:47] amen aren't you glad God remembers all
[1:32:54] of us Rachel you know she was more
[1:32:56] beautiful had all the favored whole life
[1:32:58] but God let her go through this trial
[1:33:00] being barren for all these years to
[1:33:03] produce something in her life of course
[1:33:05] to be more godlike to be more humble to
[1:33:09] learn to pray to learn to wait upon the
[1:33:11] Lord isn't that many times what God is
[1:33:13] just teaching us to do just the weight
[1:33:14] upon his timing and it's so hard for us
[1:33:17] sometimes the weight upon guys we want
[1:33:19] to make it happen right now but these
[1:33:22] are good lessons to remind us we must
[1:33:24] wait upon the Lord God's allowed this
[1:33:27] season of affliction God has allowed
[1:33:29] this season of being mistreated God has
[1:33:33] allowed this season of loneliness or
[1:33:35] hardship God has allowed it but at the
[1:33:38] end God is going to prove to you that
[1:33:40] he's heard your prayers hallelujah
[1:33:44] absolutely so those are those
[1:33:48] first eight praise the Lord
[1:33:57] now let me get to some other ones here
[1:33:59] so Rachel now feels God has taken my
[1:34:10] approach away and the Lord will add me
[1:34:14] another son the Bible doesn't tell us
[1:34:19] whether this healed right away are not
[1:34:21] into this heal the rift no one really
[1:34:22] knows but one thing that's interesting
[1:34:24] go to Genesis 3114 one thing that's
[1:34:27] interesting is that we find these two
[1:34:30] sisters Leah and Rachel we find them in
[1:34:32] unity when it comes time for Jacob to
[1:34:36] take his family out of Haran and go back
[1:34:39] to the promised land so God has this
[1:34:43] major move lined up for Jacob he's got
[1:34:45] to move he's got to go back to the
[1:34:47] homeland it's gonna change everything
[1:34:49] about his life and you know and you
[1:34:53] would think when he would go to his two
[1:34:54] wives they'd be maybe torn right cuz
[1:34:57] they're torn on everything else they're
[1:34:59] having a rough time in the home but when
[1:35:03] he goes back to ask them they're in
[1:35:05] complete unity about going to the
[1:35:08] promised land and there was one reason
[1:35:10] why we'll get to one at least one reason
[1:35:12] why for sure I know I'll get to that
[1:35:14] just a moment Genesis 31 verse 14
[1:35:17] through 16 and Rachel and
[1:35:23] answered incentive is there yet any
[1:35:25] portion or inheritance for us in our
[1:35:28] father's house
[1:35:28] are we not counted of him strangers for
[1:35:33] he has sold us and hath quite devoured
[1:35:35] also our money for all the riches which
[1:35:39] God have taken from our Father that is
[1:35:41] ours and our children's now then what's
[1:35:43] ever God has said unto thee do in other
[1:35:47] words God allowed the trials of their
[1:35:49] life to prepare them I'm ready to move
[1:35:52] we're ready to leave our Father because
[1:35:54] our father hasn't treated us well
[1:35:56] because we've been mistreated now God is
[1:35:58] going to relocate us to another location
[1:36:00] and we earned one Accord we're in unity
[1:36:04] about that we might not be in unity
[1:36:05] about everything else but we are in
[1:36:07] unity we need to leave this controlling
[1:36:09] man right absolutely and so that's what
[1:36:15] God was doing now think of it again how
[1:36:17] spiritual they were who you know the
[1:36:19] story they leave and Laban says by but
[1:36:22] then he chases them down because someone
[1:36:23] stole some of his God's his idols who
[1:36:27] stole the idols was it Leah or Rachel
[1:36:28] who's got the problem with little sins
[1:36:31] in her life it's Rachel right the most
[1:36:35] beautiful one remember if she's at the
[1:36:37] time of her menstrual period and all
[1:36:38] these things so she sits on the gods and
[1:36:40] he can't find him and Jacob gets all mad
[1:36:42] you chased me down and you didn't trust
[1:36:44] me and all these things in the whole
[1:36:46] time he doesn't know that his wife's got
[1:36:47] a problem with stealing his wife's got a
[1:36:50] problem with idols in her heart not only
[1:36:53] under her seat but under her heart right
[1:36:56] and you know the story Jacob goes back
[1:36:58] to Bethel and Jacob said take all the
[1:37:01] idols the necklaces the earrings
[1:37:04] remember that he said take all this
[1:37:05] jewelry
[1:37:06] he said let's bury under that oak and
[1:37:08] she gem we're going up to the house of
[1:37:10] God amen
[1:37:11] Lori he's a homecoming boy he's coming
[1:37:14] home he's returning to the land of his
[1:37:17] heritage he's returning to the promised
[1:37:19] land and he's to be fully gone to the
[1:37:21] house of God we've got to clean out all
[1:37:23] the worldly things out of our lives we
[1:37:25] want to be accepted by God this is a
[1:37:27] fresh start let's clean out our home
[1:37:28] amen
[1:37:30] and that's what Jacob does he cleans out
[1:37:32] the house we can't have this
[1:37:35] we've got to be rededicated to God and
[1:37:43] of course you know it's on this way back
[1:37:44] he meets he saw and he wrestles with God
[1:37:47] and God lets him win huh me know that he

[1:38:36] much of a fighter before that but God
[1:38:37] had to make him a fighter amen how many
[1:38:40] want to be a fighter in prayer
[1:38:42] hallelujah we've gotta learn to fight
[1:38:45] these battles and we'll overcome by the
[1:38:50] grace of the Lord how many know that
[1:38:53] hallelujah I think that's just a
[1:38:59] beautiful thought there now I'm gonna
[1:39:03] bring it down to close here by the grace
[1:39:04] of the Lord yeah I got five minutes that
[1:39:05] actually worked out pretty good if you
[1:39:11] would let's go
[1:39:12] Genisys 49:29 you're probably familiar
[1:39:14] with this i didn't get to all of Leah's
[1:39:22] life there wasn't a whole lot of detail
[1:39:28] that I didn't cover but I know there's a
[1:39:30] little more I didn't get quite to that
[1:39:32] but these are the thoughts that I ended
[1:39:33] with here as I was preparing this
[1:39:35] morning Genesis 49 29 and he charged
[1:39:39] them instead of them I am to be gathered
[1:39:41] unto my people bury me with my father's
[1:39:43] in the cave that is in the field of
[1:39:44] Ephron the Hittite in the cave that is
[1:39:48] in the field of Machpelah which is
[1:39:50] before Mamre in the land of Canaan which
[1:39:53] Abraham bought with the field of Ephron
[1:39:54] the Hittite for possession of a
[1:39:57] burying-place there they buried Abraham
[1:40:00] and Sarah his wife there they buried
[1:40:02] Isaac and Rebecca his wife and there I
[1:40:05] buried Leah this is Jacob talking he's
[1:40:10] dying he said bury me back in that cave
[1:40:13] where I buried my wives now this is one
[1:40:17] thing I think quite get to hear but did
[1:40:20] you catch that church I've dinner if you
[1:40:23] read your Bible if you remember as soon
[1:40:25] as Jacob brought his family back member
[1:40:27] rachaelh on the way back rachel has
[1:40:30] Benjamin and she dies remember that and
[1:40:34] Jacobs got to change the name from son
[1:40:37] of my sorrow to I forget what Benjamin
[1:40:38] means you know brother Benjamin I'm
[1:40:42] sorry I used to have it memorized I
[1:40:43] don't have it memorized yeah that's
[1:40:45] right son of my right hand well praise
[1:40:46] the Lord brother amen hallelujah
[1:40:48] said am i right in so he has to change
[1:40:51] the name Church can you imagine me in
[1:40:53] Leah all those years and now Rachel
[1:40:57] brings forth the child and then now
[1:40:58] she's died she's off the scene this one
[1:41:02] that he loved was off the scene I wonder
[1:41:05] if God did that to humble Jacob a little
[1:41:07] bit wonder if God did that and now she
[1:41:11] lives the rest of her days she lives as
[1:41:13] the one wife of Jacob because other two
[1:41:17] are just hand mates in that interesting
[1:41:20] how life makes turn sometimes wonder why
[1:41:24] this and I'm not saying for sure but is
[1:41:25] that it
[1:41:26] the one who was unloved for all these
[1:41:28] years she out lives the one who was
[1:41:31] loved and even younger she was more
[1:41:33] younger more beautiful everything but
[1:41:37] that more beautiful one passes away and
[1:41:39] now she is the only wife of Jacob
[1:41:44] interesting how God orders the steps of
[1:41:49] the Lord of the righteous praise God
[1:41:51] aren't you glad he's ordering your steps
[1:41:53] as well amen
[1:41:55] I'm so thankful Jesus Christ has my
[1:41:58] steps in his control I want to keep
[1:42:00] yielding my steps to his control I don't
[1:42:03] want to walk one step out of the perfect
[1:42:05] will of God exactly right now program
[1:42:10] tells us in demonology he talks about he
[1:42:13] said Jacob dine died down in the egypt
[1:42:15] he said don't bury me down here take me
[1:42:17] up to palestine and bury me bury me with
[1:42:19] my father's jacob begat joseph we know
[1:42:22] the perfect type of christ and joseph
[1:42:24] was dying in egypt said don't bury my
[1:42:25] bones here take me back now into
[1:42:27] palestine with my father's and he
[1:42:31] wondered why because and then the Bible
[1:42:33] said that job said I know my redeemer
[1:42:35] lives and the last days he'll stand upon
[1:42:38] the earth and though my skin worms
[1:42:40] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:42:42] shall see God whom I shall see for
[1:42:44] myself my eyes shall behold and not
[1:42:47] another that God would stand on the
[1:42:49] earth and he'd see him and Abraham said
[1:42:51] if job's going to see him I am going to
[1:42:54] be buried right with him so I can see
[1:42:57] him too he said I'll bury Sarah there
[1:43:00] and brother Adam said they buried them
[1:43:02] all there for they knowed that they
[1:43:04] would be the firstfruits of the
[1:43:06] resurrection amen hallelujah and where
[1:43:09] was Leah buried this forsaken unloved
[1:43:12] afflicted woman where was she married
[1:43:15] Jacob himself buried her right there
[1:43:18] right with Rachel amen right there with
[1:43:20] Abraham right there was Sarah right
[1:43:22] there with Isaac and Rebecca right there
[1:43:24] a job amen
[1:43:26] she was part of the firstfruits
[1:43:27] hallelujah amen the Bible said many of
[1:43:31] the Saints the graves are open in many
[1:43:34] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[1:43:37] in other
[1:43:38] graves after his resurrection went to
[1:43:40] the holy city and appeared unto many the
[1:43:42] Bible never exalts Rachel above Leah if
[1:43:44] you know the Old Testament I've a couple
[1:43:50] more scriptures here let's go to Ruth
[1:43:55] chapter 4 we see a really powerful
[1:43:59] mention of Leah Ruth chapter 4 verse 11
[1:44:08] and there's my hours
[1:44:10] I'm doing pretty good Ruth chapter 4:11
[1:44:16] don't you love the Word of God my I
[1:44:18] could just sit and read it all day
[1:44:28] that's what's really needed right now a
[1:44:30] people that love the Word of God that
[1:44:33] will obey the Word of God hearken to the
[1:44:37] Word of God Ruth chapter 4 verse 11
[1:44:44] before I read that brother Branham said
[1:44:46] now Boaz he had to make a public
[1:44:50] Proclamation can you redeem her and he
[1:44:52] said no then he had to make a public
[1:44:54] testimony he kicked off a shoe and throw
[1:44:56] to him and said there you are let all
[1:44:57] Israel know that I have redeemed Naomi
[1:44:59] and I also take roof
[1:45:00] I take Ruth from my bride what was it
[1:45:02] the Lord of the harvest amen there she
[1:45:06] is I redeemed Naomi and I get Ruth and
[1:45:08] Ruth will be my bride
[1:45:11] and eat brother have said what did they
[1:45:13] say may they be like Mae Mae Ruth be
[1:45:17] like Leah and Rachel in them and raise
[1:45:20] up thousands and she has that's right
[1:45:22] unto Israel may she be that way and look
[1:45:26] he made a public testimony look at verse
[1:45:30] 11 and all the people that were in the
[1:45:32] gate and the elders and said we are
[1:45:34] witnesses the Lord make the woman
[1:45:36] speaking of Ruth that has come into the
[1:45:39] house
[1:45:40] like Rachel and like Leah beautiful
[1:45:44] witch - did what fought and argued for
[1:45:48] all their married lives
[1:45:49] no God look past that God forgave them
[1:45:53] of that God knows we're just flesh
[1:45:56] remember David said God remember I'm
[1:45:58] just flesh remember I'm just a man the
[1:46:03] Lord make thee like Rachel like Leah
[1:46:05] which too did build the house of Israel
[1:46:07] and do thou worthily in Ephrata and be
[1:46:12] famous in Bethlehem
[1:46:15] so God credits not just Rachel the
[1:46:18] beautiful one God credits both of them
[1:46:22] for building the
[1:46:24] house of Israel and the Bible said how
[1:46:28] do you build a house the Bible said
[1:46:30] wisdom hath builded her house and the
[1:46:33] church said so women God has these two
[1:46:37] women women that have sisters of all
[1:46:40] things I got a lot of daughters so I'm
[1:46:42] praying God not give him these types of
[1:46:45] sibling rivalries that's why I bring him
[1:46:49] down to the altar and pray my hands on
[1:46:50] them every service I possibly can
[1:46:53] just like our son just like my mom
[1:46:55] prayed for my brothers and I that we
[1:46:56] wouldn't have these brotherly Cain and
[1:46:58] Abel situations and we have it by God's
[1:46:59] grace but these two God credits this
[1:47:04] older oldest sibling daughter and her
[1:47:07] little sister God credits these to
[1:47:09] through my strength they built the
[1:47:11] entire house of Israel amen
[1:47:15] yet leah could look could have looked at
[1:47:17] her life and said I'm just I'm neglected
[1:47:19] I'm the one that's always alone I'm one
[1:47:21] that always is lonely God doesn't even
[1:47:24] care about me but see all these things
[1:47:26] moved her to prayer God heard her prayer
[1:47:28] God gave her answers God gave her
[1:47:31] vindication after vindication at their
[1:47:33] vindication that I hear your prayers I
[1:47:36] am with you
[1:47:38] amen and God said it just wasn't Rachel
[1:47:42] it was both Rachel and Leah the Bible
[1:47:46] said through wisdom is in house builded
[1:47:49] and by understanding it is established
[1:47:55] what is real wisdom fearing the Lord
[1:47:58] hating evil and walking away from evil
[1:48:01] Leah could have easily grabbed evil and
[1:48:03] said I'm gonna do evil to Rachel because
[1:48:05] of all that Jacobs under me or she said
[1:48:08] Chris said I'm gonna do evil to Jacob
[1:48:10] because of all the ways he's mistreated
[1:48:12] me and hated me all these years but she
[1:48:16] instead chose to fear the Lord and like
[1:48:20] proverbs says the second thing do good
[1:48:22] to her husband all the days of her life
[1:48:26] because she did those two things she
[1:48:30] became a
[1:48:30] the mother and raising all these
[1:48:33] imaginal these little children running
[1:48:35] around I guess it would just be these
[1:48:36] maybe in her tent for a while eight
[1:48:42] children they're running around and
[1:48:43] she's in charge of she chose wisdom she
[1:48:47] said I'm gonna raise these children in
[1:48:48] the fear of God I'm gonna teach the
[1:48:51] little word remember the law hadn't been
[1:48:52] given yet Moses hadn't been born yet
[1:48:55] through Levi so she just had to depend
[1:48:59] on Jehovah the Spirit of God I want you
[1:49:06] to notice here this thought came to me
[1:49:08] and as I was studying this this morning
[1:49:10] these elders pray for Ruth and they say
[1:49:15] oh make her like Rachel and Leah and the
[1:49:19] scripture came to me out of fusions for
[1:49:21] that God is able to do exceedingly
[1:49:23] abundantly above all that you can ask or
[1:49:27] think hey they said make her like those
[1:49:30] two that have had 12 you know 12 sons
[1:49:33] and God said I'm gonna do more than that
[1:49:35] I'm gonna give her a I'm gonna give Ruth
[1:49:38] a old bed and then a Jessie and then a
[1:49:41] David and then another that's going to
[1:49:43] come Christ and out of Christ will come
[1:49:45] for these spiritual children that will
[1:49:47] multiply as the stars of heaven God did
[1:49:50] exceedingly abundantly above all they
[1:49:52] could ask her thing for Ruth and if God
[1:49:54] did that for her what about you and I
[1:49:56] praise God amen but the thing to do is
[1:49:59] pray look at they prayed publicly and
[1:50:01] God heard that prayer in the midst of
[1:50:03] the gates
[1:50:04] we should pray three where we are
[1:50:05] praying to school pray wherever you are
[1:50:07] pray on the job get on your knees and
[1:50:09] pray then God will bless our requests
[1:50:11] we'll do more than we asked for if we
[1:50:13] just hold ourselves to his will what a
[1:50:19] legacy that leah has now she's been dead
[1:50:22] all these years and now here comes Ruth
[1:50:24] Moabite us gets brought into the fold
[1:50:27] who eventually Jesus Christ the one that
[1:50:30] her husband Jacob wanted to be a part of
[1:50:31] right she comes in here and through her
[1:50:35] submission to Naomi and the Word of God
[1:50:37] through this brings forth the Messiah
[1:50:39] what a legacy to leave that Lea did
[1:50:43] because
[1:50:44] learn to love God even when she wasn't
[1:50:47] loved amen the stand or feet they said
[1:50:52] Lord make Ruth like Rachel Adalia that
[1:50:57] they may build a house through the
[1:50:59] wisdom of God to pay evil that's what
[1:51:03] the fear of the Lord is to hate anything
[1:51:04] evil and God can build something with
[1:51:08] our lives if we just hate evil and love
[1:51:12] righteousness Matthew Henry said notice
[1:51:18] when they prayed for Ruth they pray that
[1:51:20] she Bheem might be like Rachel and Leah
[1:51:21] rather than Sarah and Rebecca for Sarah
[1:51:25] had but one son a Rebecca had one that
[1:51:27] was in the Covenant the other was Esau
[1:51:29] who was rejected but Rachel and Leah did
[1:51:32] build up the house of Israel all their
[1:51:35] children were in the church because they
[1:51:38] were heads of tribes and their offspring
[1:51:42] was numerous may she be as a flourishing
[1:51:46] fruitful faithful vine by the house side
[1:51:50] of your house the Bible says in Ezekiel
[1:51:53] glory
[1:51:54] Boaz begat obed Obed begat jesse jesse
[1:51:58] begat david and out of David comes
[1:52:00] Christ amen how merciful is our God
[1:52:05] Church God knew she was gonna be
[1:52:10] rejected God knew she was gonna feel
[1:52:12] unloved God knew she'd even be hated by
[1:52:14] her family and the one that would should
[1:52:16] love her but did God hear her prayers
[1:52:19] did God answer her request
[1:52:23] absolutely God is looking upon our
[1:52:26] hearts this morning and God wants us to
[1:52:30] know that He loves us and he's watching
[1:52:33] us no matter what season were in God
[1:52:38] wants us to know that He loves us how
[1:52:43] many know the
[1:52:43] be no hard feelings there'll be no
[1:52:45] hatred all wrongs will be made right on
[1:52:48] the other side how many know that Lia
[1:52:53] never stepped out of her position
[1:52:56] despite being hated despite being
[1:52:58] unloved she never tried to step out of
[1:53:00] her position and do something she wasn't
[1:53:01] called to do
[1:53:02] she stayed right in her position as a
[1:53:05] mother I'm gonna build these children in
[1:53:07] the wisdom of God you know the dads got
[1:53:12] to go build stuff
[1:53:13] the moms build spiritual things which
[1:53:16] one lasted longer do you think the house
[1:53:18] is Jacob they're the tents Jacob put up
[1:53:19] lasted longer or do you think the godly
[1:53:21] character that Leah put in them lasted
[1:53:23] longer the godly character always lasts
[1:53:26] longer Leah kept calling upon God and
[1:53:32] God kept answering when he was ready to
[1:53:35] answer let's just bow our heads for word
[1:53:40] of prayer here now Kai can switch over
[1:53:43] email okay what's going on back there

[1:54:00] as I was preparing this morning the
[1:54:03] merciful loving God how he loved Leah
[1:54:13] she could have said oh I don't feel like
[1:54:15] this life very fair how can this be fair
[1:54:19] look at how pretty rachel is look how
[1:54:23] much she's loved by everybody in the
[1:54:24] church ever in the family loves Rachel
[1:54:27] more than me yet it taught her to be a
[1:54:31] prayer warrior it's harder to trusting
[1:54:34] God it taught her to build her life in
[1:54:37] the fear of the Lord
[1:54:38] I mean raise your hands say Lord helped
[1:54:40] me to build my life in the fear of the

[1:57:59] prayers and then he called me a builder
[1:58:05] of a kingdom of kings and priests he
[1:58:11] places me as one of the two pillars of a
[1:58:16] kingdom of spiritual priests - you're
