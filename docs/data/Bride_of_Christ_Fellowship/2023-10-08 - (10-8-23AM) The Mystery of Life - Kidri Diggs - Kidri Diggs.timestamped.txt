[35:25] 10 Jeremiah 32
[35:29] and10 the Bible says if you have it say
[35:32] Amen the Bible says and I subscribed the
[35:35] evidence and sealed it and took witness
[35:38] and weighed him the money of weighed the
[35:42] money in the
[35:43] balances so I took the evidence of the
[35:46] purchase both that was sealed according
[35:49] to the law and customs and that which
[35:52] was open and I gave the evidence of the
[35:55] purchase unto bur the son of
[36:00] Neah the son of
[36:04] mayil in the sight of
[36:09] Hanam my uncle son and in the presence
[36:13] of the witness that subscrib the book of
[36:16] the purchase before the Jews that sat in
[36:19] the court of the prison and I charged
[36:23] Birch unto them saying thus sayeth the
[36:27] Lord of hosts the god of Israel take
[36:30] these evidences that this evidence of
[36:33] the purchase both which is sealed and
[36:36] the evidence which is open put them in
[36:39] earn vessels that they may continue many
[36:42] days let's go to First John chapter
[36:48] 4 first
[36:52] John chapter
[36:55] 4
[36:59] four and
[37:03] four the Bible
[37:05] says ye are of God little children and
[37:09] have overcome them because greater is he
[37:12] that is in you than he that is in the
[37:16] world Amen May a lord at a blessing the
[37:18] reading of his word you can have your
[37:21] seats
[37:25] amen
[37:29] by the grace of God
[37:32] today I want to use for a subject The
[37:35] Mystery of
[37:37] Life The Mystery of Life you know if if
[37:41] I would just take the word
[37:44] mystery mystery it it it it means
[37:48] unknown you know unrevealed you know um
[37:53] not to be
[37:54] understood you know so if we take that
[37:57] slogan The Mystery of Life that life can
[38:00] throw all kind of things at you and you
[38:02] know it seems like a mystery but when it
[38:06] comes to God is always purpose in it you
[38:10] know and for us as Christians the best
[38:12] thing for us to realize is that our
[38:15] lives are in the hand of God so
[38:19] everything that happens to us and for us
[38:22] there's a purpose of God behind it you
[38:25] know but when we think life and you know
[38:27] and the life we live and to to to for us
[38:31] our lives to a lot of people it's
[38:34] mysterious you know we we we we we dress
[38:38] a certain way we talk a certain way we
[38:40] we go certain places that you know the
[38:42] world uhh uh doesn't go and all these
[38:45] things you know we love coming to church
[38:47] on Sundays and and and other days of the
[38:50] week you know we spend time in our
[38:52] Bibles and we study a a message from a
[38:56] prophet who's been gone over 50 years so
[38:59] it it looks at our lives is a
[39:02] mystery but our life is hidden and
[39:05] revealed in the will of God and you know
[39:08] the thing about life you never
[39:11] understand life until it starts to be
[39:13] revealed Hallelujah you know you can and
[39:16] I love talking about a seed you can have
[39:19] a seed in your hand but you don't know
[39:22] what that seed is until Life starts to
[39:25] take place
[39:27] you know there's times when seeds can be
[39:29] planted side by side and they'll look
[39:32] the same until they start to grow
[39:34] Hallelujah you know and as they grow The
[39:37] Mystery of Life it starts to unveil
[39:39] itself and the Mystery of what it is it
[39:42] starts to come out right before the very
[39:45] eye Hallelujah you say brother digs what
[39:48] are you saying I'm saying Church even in
[39:50] the scriptures we've read that there was
[39:53] a purchase a purchase of life and
[39:55] there's an evidence of that life where
[39:58] is it the Bible says God says he put it
[40:01] in Earth and vessels Hallelujah he put
[40:03] the Mystery of Life in earn vessels but
[40:07] what kind of life not the life of this
[40:10] world but the life of eternal life
[40:12] Hallelujah God put the mystery of his
[40:15] will and the Mystery of life eternal
[40:18] life in you Hallelujah and you know
[40:21] Church we're not just regular people but
[40:24] we are the revealing of eternal life
[40:27] Hallelujah we are the revealing of God's
[40:31] attributes we are the revealing of
[40:34] perfect love we are the revealing of
[40:37] Hallelujah Divine faith everything that
[40:40] God's life would project on this Earth
[40:44] he put it in us he put it in you
[40:47] Hallelujah so think church I want you to
[40:49] think about that as you live life you're
[40:53] unveiling the mystery of God
[40:57] Hallelujah W that makes me feel pretty
[41:00] good Hallelujah to know that while I'm
[41:02] living down here and and the key element
[41:05] to our life is what the
[41:08] word because it's the word of God that's
[41:12] going to unlock who you are hallelujah
[41:17] hallelujah oh my praise God I hope you
[41:20] catch what I'm saying today I know
[41:22] there's a hook or something
[41:24] somewhere did I miss it oh okay praise
[41:27] God you know church we think about life
[41:31] you know that there is a baby stage you
[41:33] know I was in Africa about uh a week ago
[41:36] and you know I love going to the lion
[41:38] Park you know and when when you go to
[41:41] the park you know uh when I went last
[41:43] year uh you know uh Co was you know kind
[41:47] of fading out and everything and and and
[41:50] and they said they had most of the Lions
[41:53] close together and and and it was like a
[41:56] p of lions but this time when I came
[41:59] back they had the pride separated why
[42:02] because as the animals start to grow
[42:05] certain things about them begin to come
[42:07] out and as they come out the males we
[42:10] begin to seek for who's dominant
[42:13] Hallelujah and you know uh I like to say
[42:16] the the only the the clearest way to
[42:19] kill a lion is by another
[42:21] lion Hallelujah because their strengths
[42:24] are matched there the the techniques are
[42:26] match and they know how to kill they're
[42:29] born with that so the easiest way to
[42:31] kill a lion is with another lion so the
[42:33] people that run this park they know I
[42:36] have to separate these Lions because
[42:38] there's something in them to dominate
[42:40] life Hallelujah and you know God he puts
[42:44] us in certain places all over the world
[42:46] because your life is needed here in
[42:49] acine Hallelujah my life is needed in
[42:53] South Carolina Hallelujah but when we
[42:55] are all get together is projecting what
[42:58] one life the life of Christ amen and you
[43:03] in acarine is the mystery of Christ
[43:05] revealed and me in Carolina is the
[43:08] mystery of Christ revealed Hallelujah
[43:11] different places different cultures
[43:13] Hallelujah different seasons but all
[43:16] projecting the same
[43:18] thing Hallelujah you say oh my brother
[43:22] digs oh what are you saying see Church
[43:24] you look at the scripture and you look
[43:26] how God called his people he called them
[43:29] maybe at different times but when they
[43:32] met up they all were projecting and
[43:34] saying the same thing so it was all
[43:37] about the mystery of God being revealed
[43:40] in each and every person and you know
[43:43] Church to show that it's the same life
[43:45] when Paul and Peter met up they were
[43:47] saying the same thing why because it was
[43:50] the same
[43:52] mystery Hallelujah that's why the
[43:54] prophet of God could say I preach what
[43:56] Paul preached why because it was the
[43:59] same
[44:00] life
[44:02] [Applause]
[44:05] Hallelujah and church I want you to
[44:08] understand that your life is no
[44:10] different from Paul's life Hallelujah
[44:13] your life is no different from John the
[44:15] Baptist Hallelujah why because John came
[44:19] to project Christ the mystery of Christ
[44:22] revealed and if you miss John you miss
[44:24] Christ oh my I'm going to say something
[44:26] tonight I'm going to say something today
[44:28] if you miss this bread you miss Christ
[44:31] cuz what is she she is the wife of God
[44:35] the revealing of his character because
[44:38] when you see the wife of a man you see
[44:41] his
[44:46] Desir you see hallelujah what gets him
[44:50] excited it's that woman he chose
[44:52] Hallelujah and if you miss the bride of
[44:55] Christ Hallelujah you miss what God
[44:58] likes Hallelujah but you know when we
[45:00] think about life and the attributes of
[45:03] life and the reason why I read the
[45:04] scripture greater is he that is in us
[45:07] than he that is in the world Hallelujah
[45:10] and church when we think about uh uh the
[45:12] greatness of God and what's uh happening
[45:15] in the world right now Church let's
[45:18] understand the only reason why the world
[45:21] is in the condition is in so God can
[45:24] demonstrate his life
[45:27] amen hallelujah oh we thought oh my it's
[45:31] just sin and people are losing their
[45:33] mind and crazy and all these things no
[45:35] the only reason the world is in this
[45:38] condition is so that the attributes of
[45:40] God's life can be on
[45:43] display Hallelujah because what happened
[45:47] because God was all by himself and he
[45:50] was so great and there was so much of
[45:52] God to be revealed and unveiled things
[45:55] had to take place so God could get a
[45:58] spiritual
[46:00] release Hallelujah you know church if I
[46:03] can say it like this it's like if you
[46:05] eat eat eat eat eat and never use the
[46:07] bathroom you'll be sick so there has to
[46:10] become a time where you release all the
[46:13] substance that you've been taking that
[46:14] you've been taking in and no doubt
[46:17] you've been taking in things that your
[46:19] body needs you've been taking in things
[46:21] Hallelujah that'll give you strength and
[46:24] energy and all that but if it's stays in
[46:26] you too long it'll make you
[46:29] sick Hallelujah too much of it will make
[46:32] you sick Hallelujah so there has to be a
[46:34] time where your liver can release where
[46:37] your kidneys can release where your
[46:39] stomach can release Hallelujah where all
[46:41] the things about your body Hallelujah
[46:44] can get a release so what God does God
[46:47] allows things to happen within the world
[46:50] so why he can get a release Hallelujah
[46:53] so the things of who he is Hal huah that
[46:56] are on back Hallelujah back order you
[46:59] know what a back order a back order is
[47:01] that has already been called for it's
[47:04] already been purchased amen it's already
[47:06] been purchased but now hallelujah it's
[47:08] been so much in demand hallelujah it's
[47:11] been so much in demand that the product
[47:14] has run out so the product is now in
[47:16] back order but once they get it back in
[47:19] stock it flows and flows and flows to
[47:21] everybody that's order it Hallelujah and
[47:23] you know the presence and the spirit and
[47:26] everything about God has been on back
[47:28] order for 2,000
[47:32] years and you are a part of the
[47:38] release you are a part
[47:42] Hallelujah of the order that the world's
[47:45] been looking for you are part of that
[47:49] love that the world's been looking for
[47:51] you are a part of that Faith the world's
[47:54] been looking for you are a part of that
[47:57] Deliverance that the world's been
[47:58] looking for you are God's back
[48:03] order
[48:07] Hallelujah but when we see life and the
[48:09] Mystery of Life Val was saying yesterday
[48:12] talking about the apple orchard and all
[48:15] these things that no doubt you take the
[48:17] seat of an apple and all of them look
[48:19] the same Hallelujah most of them look
[48:22] the same and I know nothing about this
[48:23] I'm just speaking by inspiration but but
[48:25] you know you can take the the seed of an
[48:27] apple and and give me a couple names you
[48:30] you gave me
[48:31] yesterday who Shuka what a strange name
[48:35] Suzuka apples hallelujah or you take
[48:39] Gaya Gaya apples you know and you put
[48:41] the Suzuka seed and the Gaya seed side
[48:44] by side and you can put it out there you
[48:46] can say hey these two are apples
[48:50] Hallelujah but the traits and the
[48:53] features that are in those seeds can't
[48:57] be shown until they're
[49:01] planted there are no good Hallelujah
[49:04] listen to me now there are no good in
[49:07] Malachi's
[49:08] hand Hallelujah there are no good in the
[49:11] in theak Suzuka what is it
[49:14] called in the Suzuka packet they no good
[49:18] in the Gaya packet Hallelujah the the
[49:21] features and the traits of that seed
[49:24] will never come out until they're
[49:26] planted in the right
[49:30] conditions Hallelujah until they planted
[49:33] in the right conditions that's the only
[49:36] way the mystery of the life can come out
[49:39] what are you saying brother DS the
[49:41] mystery of who you are would be no good
[49:44] in Luther's
[49:50] day oh Hallelujah the mystery of who you
[49:53] are will be no good in in Wesley's
[49:56] day the mystery of who you are will be
[49:59] no good under the Pentecostal move but
[50:02] there had to be something that could
[50:04] unveil all the features of your life
[50:08] Hallelujah there had to be a time and a
[50:11] season where everything about you would
[50:13] be revealed not in part but in whole
[50:18] Hallelujah because the day of Luther was
[50:20] a mystery of part W Hallelujah the day
[50:24] of Wesley was was a mystery of Life
[50:27] revealed in part and on and on it was
[50:30] revealed a mystery of life in part but
[50:34] then there came a time when the fullness
[50:37] of God was going to be revealed and we
[50:40] are in that day where the fullness of
[50:43] God has been
[50:47] revealed what caused the fullness of God
[50:50] to be revealed the preaching of the
[50:54] word hallelujah
[50:56] and what's being preached in our day is
[50:59] causing the mystery of who you really

[51:27] than you I'm I'm a little bit taller
[51:29] than you but let me remind you of
[51:31] something everything about you came from
[51:34] your father Hallelujah but the special
[51:37] thing about God hallelujah God allows us
[51:40] hallelujah to be
[51:43] unveiled Hallelujah go ahead although I
[51:47] can look at you and see Jesse I have to
[51:50] be able to see Malachi
[51:52] too hallah Hallelujah oh my church
[51:57] that's what we are you have your own
[51:59] identity in Christ Hallelujah yeah I'm
[52:03] identified with Christ and in Christ but
[52:06] I also have my own
[52:08] identity and my identity is to reflect
[52:11] who Christ is in
[52:14] me
[52:15] Hallelujah when you saw Peter when you
[52:18] saw Paul you saw Christ but you still
[52:21] saw Peter and
[52:23] Paul amen
[52:26] Hallelujah although we appreciate God
[52:29] sending a prophet my identity is not in
[52:32] William brandham my identity is in the
[52:34] Revelation The Mystery of the life being
[52:38] revealed the mystery of what's being
[52:40] preached to me will unveil who I
[52:45] [Applause]
[52:47] am and you know Jesse you I me see I
[52:51] call you the wrong name Malachi you can
[52:53] look so much like the father father
[52:55] people will look at you and say you're
[52:57] Jesse's boy but then you'll say no I'm
[53:02] Malachi I got a name hallelujah amen I
[53:07] got a
[53:08] purpose hallelujah amen that I was born
[53:12] Hallelujah into this family because God
[53:15] had a purpose for me and it's the same
[53:18] thing for you and I hallelujah we're not
[53:20] here just to be robots we're here to
[53:23] demonstrate the mystery of God's word
[53:29] Hallelujah and when the life is really
[53:32] being unveiled you will look at it and
[53:34] it's almost like Hallelujah I look at
[53:36] you and I see Jesse but you're really
[53:38] Malachi and just like they looked at
[53:40] John Hallelujah they looked at John and
[53:43] they saw Jesus but it was really
[53:48] John he was so much the life oh my the
[53:52] life was so much like Christ they
[53:54] thought he was
[54:00] Christ and that's where we are and
[54:03] that's where we've always
[54:06] been church when the real life of Christ
[54:09] is being manifested people look at the
[54:12] mystery and they say are you
[54:16] God they did the same thing through the
[54:18] prophets through the days Church you
[54:20] read your Bible one of the prophets that
[54:23] I love reading about you read about
[54:26] Samuel and when Samuel came into
[54:30] town everybody straightened
[54:33] up whatever foolishness they had going
[54:36] on they stopped it whatever kind of
[54:39] dances or parties or whatever they had
[54:41] they stopped it why because Samuel was
[54:44] there and they they knew that there was
[54:46] a power behind Samuel they knew that
[54:49] there was a life there Hallelujah that
[54:52] whatever he said was going to happen
[54:54] amen
[54:55] Hallelujah but who was it really in
[55:02] Samuel
[55:04] Hallelujah yeah they saw Samuel but it
[55:07] was really
[55:10] God and that's the way it should be
[55:12] today they may see you they may see me
[55:15] but they really should be saying that
[55:17] that's God in that life that's Christ in
[55:19] that life hallelujah oh my because what
[55:23] are we we are the mystery of Christ
[55:28] revealed that's why you can make a
[55:30] statement and say greater is he that is
[55:32] in me than he that is in the
[55:35] world but you plant that seed and I love
[55:38] saying this the mystery of that seed can
[55:41] only be
[55:43] revealed revealed is if you put that
[55:46] seed in
[55:49] dirt and we think as Christians we say
[55:52] oh not me I'm holy you know praise God I
[55:56] you know I got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[55:58] you would have never gotten it if you
[55:59] didn't have dirt in your
[56:04] life because dirt is the only thing that
[56:06] can convict you to bring you to the
[56:08] presence of
[56:13] God and without some kind of Filth in
[56:16] your life you'd never
[56:20] repent Hallelujah and if you would have
[56:23] never repent you never experience a
[56:26] higher way of
[56:27] living
[56:29] Hallelujah so it took your faults your
[56:32] failures your ups and your Downs all
[56:35] these things to what bring forth the
[56:39] mystery that's why the Bible comes the
[56:42] Bible comes and it gives us a shocking
[56:44] point it gives us something that the
[56:46] world can understand it says hallelujah
[56:49] a righteous man Fallen seven times now
[56:52] you put falling down and righteous
[56:54] together that don't sound right but
[56:56] God's Hallelujah definition of righteous
[56:59] is not the way the man looks at it he
[57:01] said a righteous man fth seven times
[57:04] what makes him righteous the mystery
[57:06] Hallelujah inside of him that won't give
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:13] up
[57:15] Hallelujah you say brother why you keep
[57:18] going to church because there's
[57:19] something inside of me that won't give
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:23] up
[57:26] brother why you keep praying cuz there's
[57:28] something inside of me that won't give
[57:32] up brother why you keep believing cuz
[57:35] there's something inside of me that
[57:36] won't give
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:43] up and as you stay under the word your
[57:49] tree grows and the more you take in
[57:52] Hallelujah the key is to take in in more
[57:55] than what you
[57:57] need and the reason why people don't
[57:59] push outs because they don't take in
[58:00] more than what they need again I said if
[58:03] I eat and eat and eat I have to have a
[58:06] release Hallelujah so when it comes to
[58:08] the fers of God you eat and eat and eat
[58:11] you got to push out
[58:13] eventually hallelujah hallelujah but
[58:17] church when we think about that life and
[58:19] dirt and sunlight and all these things
[58:21] hallelujah what is it is God fulfilling
[58:24] the mystery of his will Hallelujah and
[58:28] nobody knows the difference between Zulu
[58:31] seed and Gaya
[58:35] seed
[58:37] Hallelujah and I did that on
[58:39] purpose because you think about me
[58:42] calling it out of his name if that seed
[58:45] could speak he say no you didn't you
[58:47] didn't pronounce my name right what
[58:49] would that seed be saying I know who I
[58:53] am
[58:55] hallelujah
[58:57] hallelujah that seed will correct you
[59:00] and say I know who I am they say John
[59:03] are you the Christ John say no I'm the
[59:06] voice of one crying in the wilderness he
[59:08] knew who he was he knew the mystery of
[59:12] his life
[59:16] Hallelujah he knew the mystery of his
[59:18] life church and that's our job that's
[59:21] our calling to know how God wants to use
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:31] you I forget her
[59:33] name but the mother of the Wesley
[59:36] boys I think what's her name
[59:40] Susanna had what 12 kids something like
[59:43] 15 16 whatever it was what we would say
[59:46] today a ridiculous number of
[59:49] kids
[59:51] Hallelujah but that was the mystery of
[59:53] God's will being fulfilled in Savannah's
[59:57] life everybody else looking at Savannah
[59:59] said man you having another child but
[1:00:02] there was something in her Hallelujah
[1:00:04] that was made her settled with pushing
[1:00:08] our kids Hallelujah there was something
[1:00:10] in her that says no I'm not going to
[1:00:12] fight this I'm just going to release
[1:00:15] these lives H I'm just going to released
[1:00:18] this life in the world Hallelujah and as
[1:00:21] she released Hallelujah as she released
[1:00:24] Hallelujah she produced two children
[1:00:27] that would greatly Hallelujah affect the
[1:00:29] world by the mystery of their
[1:00:32] lives Charles and John Wesley
[1:00:35] hallelujah hallelujah those two men
[1:00:39] hallelujah what were they they were
[1:00:42] attributes of the life of their
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:51] mother see I I I say this
[1:00:55] I say this because I like to give her
[1:00:57] credit
[1:00:59] that uh yeah we know when we get on the
[1:01:01] other side we'll be standing with the
[1:01:03] prophet for our day we'll be standing
[1:01:05] with our age yeah and you know he says
[1:01:08] he says although all those Brands know
[1:01:10] he said these are your converts but I
[1:01:13] like to say before I get there I'm the
[1:01:16] convert here to my mother Hallelujah
[1:01:21] because it was her life Hallelujah that
[1:01:23] led me to to the mystery of Christ
[1:01:27] hallelujah what I seen and heard being
[1:01:29] revealed Hallelujah the meekness
[1:01:32] Hallelujah the Visions the prophecies
[1:01:34] and hallu the faith all these things all
[1:01:37] these attributes on this side about God
[1:01:40] what did it do it drew me closer to
[1:01:43] Christ Hallelujah and as I saw the
[1:01:46] mystery of her life being revealed it
[1:01:48] pulled me closer into who I
[1:01:53] was so the purpose of you being here in
[1:01:56] this church Hallelujah is so that who
[1:01:59] you are can come
[1:02:05] out you could be in any church
[1:02:08] Hallelujah but thus that church reveal
[1:02:13] you does that church Hallelujah uncover
[1:02:16] who you
[1:02:17] are hallelujah or are you just a church
[1:02:22] member and if you're just a church
[1:02:24] member Hallelujah you're no good to any
[1:02:27] of us because there's nothing about you
[1:02:30] we can apply Hallelujah but when you
[1:02:34] find your place in Christ Hallelujah and
[1:02:37] Christ begins to use you Hallelujah and
[1:02:39] life is being projected then we all can
[1:02:42] eat from your
[1:02:45] tree because that's the most important
[1:02:47] thing about the apple is not to get on
[1:02:49] the tree and look beautiful no that
[1:02:52] someone may feed from the tree
[1:03:00] Hallelujah and if I was to Sayers
[1:03:03] hallelujah amen y'all go there with the
[1:03:06] whole purpose of planting why for a
[1:03:12] harvest what's going on in akine y'all

[1:03:17] Sunday and and come here and preach his
[1:03:19] Revelation and say man I'm powerful no

[1:03:26] hallelujah it's about producing
[1:03:28] something a life that will draw more
[1:03:31] people to our tree to
[1:03:36] eat Hallelujah and God wants to use you
[1:03:40] Hallelujah to satisfy somebody's
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:47] hunger or to quench somebody else's
[1:03:51] thirst God wants to use you
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:03:57] Hallelujah to unveil that
[1:04:00] mystery and church I I I love talking
[1:04:02] about the mystery and the cycle of life

[1:04:08] everybody in here right now is in a
[1:04:10] cycle and I want I I'm GNA make it real
[1:04:12] simple for you
[1:04:14] Hallelujah you know the Bible speaks of
[1:04:18] H uh in the time where
[1:04:20] Joseph went from being in in in bondage
[1:04:25] well let's just say like this he went
[1:04:27] from a time of being in a happy
[1:04:30] home you know his life was good he knew
[1:04:33] his father loved him he was getting
[1:04:34] special treatment from there Hallelujah
[1:04:38] experiencing hatred and jealousy
[1:04:41] Hallelujah the pattern of life started
[1:04:43] to change and he didn't know what was
[1:04:46] going on but what was it it was the
[1:04:49] mystery of God's will being
[1:04:53] revealed
[1:04:56] see God has a strange way of getting us
[1:04:59] there and sometimes we don't understand
[1:05:02] it but it's something about you being
[1:05:05] released into the world and Joseph
[1:05:07] didn't know Hallelujah that God was
[1:05:09] going to use hatred and jealousy
[1:05:12] Hallelujah to bring forth the mystery in
[1:05:14] his
[1:05:15] life that he was going to use Hallelujah
[1:05:18] a lust demon and AAR demon to bring
[1:05:21] forth the mystery in his life Hallelujah
[1:05:24] bondage and being forsaken to bring
[1:05:26] forth the mystery in his life
[1:05:28] whoa Hallelujah God used all these
[1:05:32] things all these things that were a
[1:05:34] pattern of his journey Hallelujah all
[1:05:37] these things Hallelujah that was in his
[1:05:39] Pathway to bring forth what the mystery
[1:05:42] of life that was in

[1:05:51] through things and the first thing we
[1:05:52] say this ain't nothing but the the
[1:05:55] devil be
[1:05:57] careful cuz it could be God unveiling
[1:06:01] something in
[1:06:03] you something that the whole world needs
[1:06:07] amen let's understand the prophet had to
[1:06:09] lose his first wife and his baby girl
[1:06:12] just to get him in position Hallelujah
[1:06:14] to preach this
[1:06:18] gospel because there were things that he
[1:06:20] loved that was in the way Hallelujah of
[1:06:23] the revealing
[1:06:26] and if God has to move things out of the
[1:06:28] way Hallelujah to get you in the proper
[1:06:30] place he will do it and you think about
[1:06:33] L we go back to Joseph Hallelujah he
[1:06:35] didn't understand Hallelujah the mystery
[1:06:38] of God's will Hallelujah and so are we

[1:12:56] think about hallelujah how God uses
[1:12:59] things to put us hallelujah to unveil
[1:13:02] the mystery of his will and if I go back
[1:13:04] to Joseph Hallelujah maybe in the first
[1:13:07] stages of his life he didn't understand
[1:13:09] what God was doing but that never
[1:13:12] stopped him from being
[1:13:16] unveiled true sign of a Believer while
[1:13:20] they're going through adversity the m of
[1:13:23] God's will is still being unveiled in
[1:13:25] their
[1:13:26] life while they're going through things
[1:13:29] that they have no answer for they still
[1:13:31] have the right
[1:13:34] attitude cuz you look at Job Hallelujah
[1:13:37] he had no answers to the death of his
[1:13:39] children he had no answers for losing
[1:13:42] his cattle he had no answers for how his
[1:13:44] wife was treating him but his attitude
[1:13:47] was blessed be the name of the
[1:13:52] Lord
[1:13:55] what was he showing he was showing the
[1:13:58] attribute of
[1:14:01] God now I ask you what are you unveiling
[1:14:05] what are you revealing today are you
[1:14:08] revealing the attribute of Christ in
[1:14:13] you

[1:14:17] earthqu in the fire and another thing
[1:14:19] that people don't like is a mighty
[1:14:21] Russian wind
[1:14:25] people say give me the Holy Ghost give
[1:14:26] me the Holy Ghost but I want it without
[1:14:35] sensation but the Bible
[1:14:39] says and and brother Jesse I've been
[1:14:43] accused of exciting the
[1:14:49] people brother digs all you like to do
[1:14:52] is come and excite the people get the

[1:14:59] everybody's
[1:15:00] dead and nonresponsive to the word of
[1:15:04] God I'd rather have a service where
[1:15:07] we're all responsive to the word of God
[1:15:11] hallelujah what people do so often is
[1:15:14] they look at the Shell of the
[1:15:17] seed Hallelujah your expression right
[1:15:20] now it doesn't really Define everything
[1:15:22] about who you are it what happens when
[1:15:26] you leave here that really tells me who
[1:15:28] you
[1:15:30] are Hallelujah can you still give him
[1:15:34] praise when you all by
[1:15:36] yourself can you still throw your hands
[1:15:38] up can you still say Amen can you still
[1:15:40] say praise the Lord when you're all by
[1:15:43] yourself so you can do this with me here
[1:15:46] but can you do this without
[1:15:51] me Hallelujah

[1:15:56] believer I can give God all of me
[1:15:59] without
[1:16:04] you oh glory to
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:08] God if we look at the mystery of Christ
[1:16:11] revealed and people want it the way they
[1:16:12] want it and people look for a religion
[1:16:15] that fits their the that that fits their
[1:16:18] standards of living you know I want a
[1:16:20] God where I can you know and uh you know
[1:16:24] go go to the club and still come and say
[1:16:26] thank the Lord Jesus for my
[1:16:30] savior you know I want a God that allows
[1:16:33] me to do all the stuff out in the world
[1:16:35] and I can still come and say God you're
[1:16:37] my God I bless your name won't he do
[1:16:45] it but is that revealing
[1:16:49] Christ you know that bumper sticker one
[1:16:51] of the most powerful bumper stickers
[1:16:53] that's just a bumper sticker what will
[1:16:56] Christ do right cuz I always ask people
[1:16:59] I say do you think if Christ was here
[1:17:03] the god of Glory he would be sitting
[1:17:06] down with you smoking a
[1:17:08] blunt not at all you think he'd be at
[1:17:11] the concert with you with Beyonce
[1:17:13] talking about who run the
[1:17:16] world you think he'd be out there with
[1:17:18] that even though she says I profess
[1:17:22] Christianity
[1:17:23] you think Christ would be revealed in
[1:17:25] that you think Christ will be at The
[1:17:28] Honky Tonk Bar you know my icky breaky
[1:17:30] heart and all of stuff you think he
[1:17:32] would be revealed in that church if if
[1:17:36] you have a God that's revealed in the
[1:17:38] same things that's in the world that
[1:17:40] means you never gave up anything to live
[1:17:44] right and that also means what's the
[1:17:48] effect of Calvary in your
[1:17:50] life because Calvary came to set you
[1:17:53] free and if there's nothing Hallelujah
[1:17:56] you got freedom from that means you're
[1:17:58] still in
[1:18:02] bondage

[1:18:06] desire to drink and smoke and party and
[1:18:09] all the things that shows that the
[1:18:11] mystery of Christ is being

[1:18:17] hallelujah oh my the Bible says he's so
[1:18:20] holy that the Hallelujah the a angels
[1:18:23] are unclean in his
[1:18:25] presence well that's something and you

[1:18:32] praise God I'm a Christian I'm
[1:18:34] saved Hallelujah you might have that
[1:18:37] desire but there's another revealing of
[1:18:39] life for
[1:18:41] you Hallelujah there's another step for
[1:18:44] you Hallelujah because Christ came to
[1:18:47] set us free Hallelujah he came to
[1:18:49] Deliver Us from all bondage Hallelujah
[1:18:52] but the key to life is you got to want
[1:18:55] to

[1:19:01] Deliver Us from anything but we got to
[1:19:04] want it yes amen hallelujah you may you
[1:19:08] may go into prayer fall back into it

[1:32:01] revealed to me that I can't die until I

[1:35:07] Jesse is our pastor but I want you to
[1:35:10] understand
[1:35:11] Hallelujah David was a giant killer but
[1:35:14] everybody that follow David were giant
[1:35:17] Killers
[1:35:20] also
[1:35:22] amen
[1:35:23] hallelujah so God will put a life on
[1:35:26] display so you can see the potential of
[1:35:28] what you're following and not only the
[1:35:31] potential of what you're following but
[1:35:32] the potential of who you are Hallelujah
[1:35:35] cuz one day David went out to fight by
[1:35:37] himself and and one of Goliath Brothers
[1:35:40] say he got a new sword and he want to
[1:35:42] kill somebody he came out with that new
[1:35:44] sword to kill David and the Bish I came
[1:35:46] up behind him and cut his head off and
[1:35:49] then he told David he said hey don't you
[1:35:50] ever go out here by yourself again
[1:35:52] you're the light of Israel Hallelujah so
[1:35:55] David was surrounded by other giant
[1:35:59] Killers
[1:36:01] hallelujah hallelujah if there's more
[1:36:04] Giants in the land that mean there's
[1:36:06] more people to kill
[1:36:09] Giants
[1:36:12] hallelujah
[1:36:13] hallelujah and I love about those men
[1:36:16] David's Mighty Men they were just as
[1:36:19] strong and as powerful as he is but they
[1:36:21] surrender their gifts to David why
[1:36:23] because they saw
[1:36:26] [Applause]
[1:36:28] Christ
[1:36:30] Hallelujah and we choose the pastors we
[1:36:33] choose not because of dynamic Ministries
[1:36:36] but because we can see
[1:36:39] Christ
[1:36:41] hallelujah we're eating off the branch
[1:36:43] of life and we're being fed and we're
[1:36:46] growing Hallelujah and we're pushing out
[1:36:49] from our tree that's what it's all about
[1:36:52] H it's not all about oh man I like when
[1:36:54] my pastor spins around he does this
[1:36:56] moving oh it just excites me that's all
[1:37:00] right but who is he when you
[1:37:03] sick Hallelujah who is he when you a
[1:37:07] little depressed Hallelujah can he
[1:37:09] impart life into you that's what we want
[1:37:13] and as individuals that's what we should
[1:37:15] be able to do impart life into one
[1:37:18] another when the brothers get up here
[1:37:20] and s and worship what should it do it
[1:37:23] should impart a spirit of Life
[1:37:27] Hallelujah church you can go all through
[1:37:29] the Bible Hallelujah and you look at the
[1:37:32] mystery of life being revealed God
[1:37:34] allowed a spirit to come on Saul but
[1:37:37] when David played what happened the
[1:37:39] spirit left Hallelujah because David was
[1:37:41] showing that his life was stronger than
[1:37:43] that
[1:37:44] Spirit Hallelujah and then sa would say
[1:37:48] oh my praise God I feel
