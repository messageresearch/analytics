[26:27] blessing the Lord in his elbow Lord we
[26:29] ask it in Jesus Christ's name where we
[26:31] know that's the name to receive all
[26:33] blessings and we ask nothing darling
[26:34] Lord full confidence Lord God you will
[26:37] minister that need or be of any other
[26:40] unspoken question though the people's
[26:42] hearts I didn't ask them to raise their
[26:44] hand but you know the needs of our God a
[26:46] pretty neat everything tonight lord
[26:47] thank you for the saints coming out to
[26:49] the houses Lord I'll give you honor and
[26:51] praise and glory and worship you know
[26:54] Jesus Christ amen
[26:56] I did that one test alone
[26:58] they're going with me on Sunday remember
[27:01] when we had a visitor sister Donna a few
[27:03] weeks ago when she came up for prayer
[27:04] for the Holy Ghost and remember that do
[27:10] you remember how many remember see an 8
[27:13] a man Earth's Arcia and then came up for
[27:15] prayer sorry with Lily that came up from
[27:17] her and after she went back to her seat
[27:22] her mind went back she I guess she was
[27:24] whispered over into the toll brother
[27:26] Bank she's brother bang or did you hear
[27:28] all that was hallelujah
[27:30] course nobody was singing a lot of
[27:32] holler really of course and we were not
[27:34] singing hallelujah song for that time
[27:36] and Maggie even said she heard it out of
[27:39] her bad year and so that was a testimony
[27:43] because it reminds us that it might have
[27:44] been angels of God said a woman here
[27:47] poured out her heart to the Lord and
[27:49] there see here's a song that we say
[27:52] there was a lot of course like a choir
[27:54] of hallelujah
[28:09] right but to know that as angels gather
[28:12] around true believers that's why I
[28:14] wanted to share I knew that was it by
[28:15] God's grace then I encourage you nothing
[28:18] carriages me you know to know that those
[28:19] things happen
[28:20] I believe see I don't think she's had
[28:25] any mobile training where she was not
[28:27] raising the message so she I don't know
[28:29] about that so we're very thankful for
[28:31] that
[28:31] let's see one more song here's our
[28:32] vcomplex almost time our usual time to
[28:35] preach God's Word
[28:38] let's stay on our feet messing up well
[28:40] it will be worked at all we just seen
[28:41] the course for that then we want to get
[28:43] to the Word of God here I try to keep it
[28:50] he worked at all when we see Jesus and
[28:53] let's not forget this song it's good old
[28:55] song I used to sing growing up we have
[28:57] it be worth it all

[31:50] which was us being rooted in Christ
[31:58] bless Sunday when we preach that message
[32:01] and there was numerous hands and went up
[32:02] so to me that's a little confirmation
[32:05] for me that it was the leadership of the
[32:06] Lord so very thankful for that you want
[32:10] a pure heart with no weeds in it praise
[32:13] God nothing growing up that would hinder
[32:16] those brophy by in our lives
[32:18] praise the Lord is so crucial to our
[32:21] Christian walk with the Lord tonight
[32:23] we'll start off a little bit with we're
[32:26] going to finish up a little more on the
[32:28] our hearts as the ground but then we
[32:29] want to finish with how we rooted in
[32:33] Christ and where the plant is planted in
[32:35] the Christ so let's start with that
[32:37] let's go to Ephesians 3:17
[32:42] 3:17 verse 17 the Christ may dwell in
[32:59] your hearts by faith that ye being
[33:03] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[33:07] to comprehend with All Saints this is
[33:11] something all Saints should be able to
[33:12] proceed comprehend what is the breadth
[33:19] the length and depth and height the love
[33:27] of Christ which passes knowledge and you
[33:31] might be filled so we'll bet you get to
[33:36] that thought I want to get to that
[33:37] thought of All Saints need to comprehend
[33:40] what is the breadth the length the depth
[33:44] and the height of the love of God anyone
[33:47] be able to understand that I think we do
[33:50] I just want to bring the Scriptures out
[33:51] so you can be refreshed with
[33:54] understanding how much God loves us we
[33:57] often preach it hard against sin like
[33:59] you all the time
[33:59] sometimes we just look back how much God
[34:01] loves me that's a nice I thought we
[34:03] could do that as targets the word of
[34:05] Prayer getting on your heart just make
[34:06] it known unto God how many follow you
[34:10] love you tonight thank you for your
[34:11] mercy and your grace Lord God we ask
[34:14] that you minister not to us by before
[34:15] the spirit Lord take my thoughts in
[34:18] order to put them to the side that's
[34:19] what my own thoughts aside and mainly
[34:21] preach your word through me dear God by
[34:23] your spirit there's the foolishness of
[34:26] preaching to save or deliver them that
[34:29] believe Lord so deliver us from any
[34:30] doubt or fear or frustration of
[34:33] bitterness Lord anything at all that's
[34:35] might be rooted in our hearts Lord God
[34:37] or just pray Lord God for your mercy to
[34:40] rest upon us the Holy Spirit direct us
[34:42] we need you Lord I need you tonight Lord
[34:44] God be with us in a special way in Jesus
[34:48] Christ loving it
[34:49] sure said Amen god bless you didn't see
[34:51] the praise the Lord
[35:00] let's look at this talk here about God
[35:02] you can switch over I have some quotes
[35:04] share one look at rooted in Christ
[35:07] tonight how many believe they're rooted
[35:12] in Christ the Christ is the ground he's
[35:15] got all the minerals you need he's got
[35:17] all the water you need and you're just
[35:19] planted in Christ he met will look at
[35:21] that thought tonight rooted in Christ so
[35:25] we read our text now our four
[35:27] illustrations on Sunday and we looked at
[35:30] Christ as the root these the room at the
[35:33] offspring of David we know that and then
[35:36] our hearts as the ground and we looked
[35:38] at that we just briefly looked at the
[35:40] churches the branch I'm not going to I'm
[35:41] not gonna spend much time on that we
[35:43] look at that briefly
[35:44] we saw how in the bride tree we're at
[35:46] the very top the bride of Jesus Christ
[35:48] in this day is not a denomination those
[35:50] are all those were all good moves during
[35:53] their day but I heard what I have to say
[35:54] this week in the Czar's church age it's
[35:56] the second generation that messes it up
[35:58] God will send a revival it's not the
[36:02] first generation it's the second
[36:03] generation so don't we have to be
[36:05] careful had to be careful mother
[36:07] grams/day
[36:08] his initial people were in the revival
[36:10] but is the next generation has to be
[36:13] careful that falls in us we might even
[36:15] be a third generation I would imagine
[36:17] because you looking at like brother
[36:19] Joseph Branham was the son of brother
[36:22] Brandon well he's got children that are
[36:23] my age he's got grandchildren you know
[36:26] so we're almost like the third
[36:27] generation but spiritually if you're
[36:29] born begin tonight you're not a
[36:31] grandchild a great grandchild you're a
[36:33] child of God because God doesn't have
[36:35] grandchildren you must be a real child
[36:38] of God amen
[36:39] and so like I said much time this but
[36:41] we're going to finish tonight with this
[36:43] we are rooting the love of Christ and if
[36:45] we're rooted in him then we need to
[36:47] understand and comprehend with that with
[36:49] all the saints what the love of God is
[36:52] what that means for us so let's I want
[36:55] to finish though with this that our
[36:56] hearts are ground for roots either good
[37:00] seed right or bad seed and on Sunday I
[37:04] said that I hadn't been doing a lot of
[37:06] weeding that's true
[37:07] and children have been doing a lot of
[37:08] weeding I haven't I took some time off
[37:10] but then last week I finally got in
[37:12] there did some weeding you know that our
[37:14] natural Gardens but I would make sure I
[37:16] sent that the right way I didn't mean to
[37:18] make it look like nobody was working
[37:19] because they worked really hard I just
[37:21] took some time off from weeding you know
[37:23] cuz I was just tired and focus on other
[37:25] things but our hearts are like a ground
[37:28] that's receiving the word and tonight
[37:31] Christ is going to try to show some more
[37:33] seat on your heart praise God and you
[37:36] want that go and receive that and you
[37:38] want the promises of God to be received
[37:40] on good grounds so we want to make sure
[37:42] there's nothing that would hinder the
[37:44] word that's falling to our hearts
[37:46] tonight now I said this on Sunday by
[37:48] never reading the quote so I want you to
[37:50] see it because I don't know if I read
[37:52] this before here if we have a
[37:55] unconfessed sin in our lives it's a
[37:59] great hindrance to God moving in our
[38:02] lives he can still move like man preach
[38:04] that message unbelief doesn't hinder God
[38:06] if someone's going to sit and disbelieve
[38:08] God God will move on to somebody else it
[38:11] won't hinder the plan of God it'll just
[38:13] move God to just hinder God's move in
[38:15] that person's life right like with the
[38:18] example when cherish his daughter
[38:20] remember Jairus daughter died and
[38:21] everybody's cried and then laughing in
[38:24] Jesus in Jerez house saying Jesus said
[38:26] oh she just sleep there everybody's
[38:28] laughing so what Jesus have to do kick
[38:30] them out right he said you have to leave
[38:33] excuse us you need to leave right
[38:36] so that unbelief of that group didn't
[38:39] end there God God just dismiss them and
[38:41] then God did the miracle and that's how
[38:44] as far as today praise the Lord
[38:46] but anyone confessing left in a group of
[38:50] believers if not taken care of if it's
[38:53] not prayed for it will spread and to
[38:56] file the whole church because it's
[38:57] caught it's another simple as 11 just
[39:00] like if you let a garden bed go without
[39:02] eating it the weeds are gonna take over
[39:04] praise God they're just gonna take over
[39:07] so we've got to keep all the sin out of
[39:10] our hearts and lives that's why every
[39:12] service is so crucial
[39:13] that's why weeding every day and our
[39:15] weeding it all the time is so crucial
[39:18] praise God how many have a garden
[39:20] somebody have a garden here just Jose
[39:22] thus okay so when you guys get in the
[39:25] garden you know or you haven't met your
[39:28] own house I've ever had the babies the
[39:29] old houses and art if you never had one
[39:33] you maybe not one understand but if you
[39:35] want those plants to grow healthy you
[39:37] gotta meet all the time you gotta be
[39:39] constant looking for where's the bad
[39:40] part where's the bad part where's the
[39:42] bad part and that's what the Holy Ghost
[39:43] does for us if there's any bad part pick
[39:45] it out well we need out get rid of it
[39:48] because the true seeds need to grow into
[39:50] fruition now here's where I mentioned
[39:53] this on Sunday it's from adoption I
[39:55] think I said 1960 but our 61 is actually
[39:57] 1960s so forgive me if I said the wrong
[39:59] here and my dad said there's where the
[40:02] church is failing today on the walk do
[40:06] you know that even your own behavior
[40:07] could knock somebody else out of getting
[40:09] healed yes your misbehavior of
[40:12] unconfessed sins of you not sinners
[40:16] believers can cause this church to
[40:20] bitterly fail yeah he's talking at his
[40:23] home church how many one on search to
[40:26] succeed and it will and the wait for it
[40:30] to succeed is to have the Holy Ghost
[40:31] visit us have angels visit us to have
[40:35] God do mighty things among us saving
[40:37] souls send to fire heart's filling know
[40:39] what the Holy Ghost doing miracles as
[40:41] he's led as he leads us to do right but
[40:45] it's not if the Holy Spirit is grieved
[40:46] then the church can fail and at the end
[40:49] of the judgement he said you'll be
[40:51] responsible for every bit of it the
[40:53] church will be responsive yes oh you say
[40:56] now wait a minute program he said that's
[40:57] the truth think of it
[40:59] who's he use Joshua Joshua after he
[41:03] crossed over the land God gave him the
[41:05] promise that just think to fight an
[41:07] entire campaign without losing the man
[41:08] without even getting a scratch without
[41:12] having to have a nurse or a first aid or
[41:14] beta amen God said the land yours go
[41:17] fight baby fighting the campaign and
[41:19] there's no Red Cross around at all
[41:22] there's nobody going to get hurt and
[41:23] they slayed the amorite through the
[41:25] Hittites but there wasn't one hurt among
[41:27] any of them
[41:28] until sin came in the camp and when a
[41:31] took the Babylonian garment and that
[41:33] gold edge and hid it under under his
[41:35] camp then the next day they lost 16
[41:39] million I think was 60 Joshua sent stops
[41:41] not wait a minute there's something
[41:43] wrong something's wrong here we're going
[41:45] to call seven days of facts God made us
[41:47] a promise there will be nothing hurt us
[41:49] our enemies will fall on our feet and
[41:52] there's something wrong here something
[41:55] went wrong here because we got sixteen
[41:57] dead men laying here there is alive
[41:59] brothers and they're dead why do they
[42:02] die in a set men because one man stepped
[42:05] out of line you see reason this needs to
[42:08] be taught the church lining up lining up
[42:10] the Word of God might help with God and
[42:12] lighting up with the juggler walking
[42:17] perfectly upright soberly before a man
[42:19] fearing God because one man's solar
[42:21] garment does something that he should
[42:23] not have done took the life of 16 men I
[42:25] think it was 1690 Marley was 1609 Joshua
[42:29] called and said there's something wrong
[42:31] God made the promise there's something
[42:32] wrong and when we bring the sick up
[42:34] before us and they failed to be healed
[42:36] we need to call a solemn fast call of
[42:38] assembly something thrown somewhere God
[42:41] made the promise God's got to stick to
[42:42] that promise and he will do it now the
[42:45] last time I did that was last year I
[42:47] called it fast and we have one other
[42:49] person come I caught a fast for
[42:51] Christopher and Samuel I caught a fast
[42:55] for that we and some people said they
[42:57] were fasting was gonna cover the church
[42:58] but we had two people coming to church
[42:59] with me thank God for that and they were
[43:02] helped within a few months I'm not
[43:04] mistaken we afraid afraid of praise and
[43:07] it's nothing to burden me like what
[43:08] something's wrong I think I just
[43:10] preached this I think I preached on the
[43:12] Sunday night one done and so we call the
[43:14] fast and God brought relief to Samuel
[43:17] and Christopher for least for a while by
[43:20] the grace of God so I've tried to put
[43:22] this in action how many think we should
[43:24] put in action just like with somebody
[43:27] that sins and won't repent we should put
[43:29] them out of the church now I've never
[43:32] had that with the time when we first are
[43:34] in the church we haven't had it recently
[43:36] so everybody I went to is sin either
[43:38] leaves or they make your right
[43:41] for that but if somebody will come to
[43:43] the church and commit fornication or
[43:46] adultery and won't repent on that and
[43:48] won't leave that we've got to first
[43:50] order than one on one if they won't
[43:52] repent
[43:53] take somebody else the third thing
[43:55] bringing before the church but they
[43:56] still won't repent me back to count that
[43:58] person as a heathen how many believe
[44:00] that's the true gospel yes some people
[44:03] go overboard with it every little thing
[44:04] you know they'll nitpick but larsa's
[44:06] only by the church does not seems to do
[44:07] that they go overboard and any little
[44:09] thing that puts you out from under the
[44:10] blood well God God will deal with them
[44:13] with that that road I don't hold them
[44:15] accountable but we've got to be
[44:17] accountable for our church we don't have
[44:19] to answer for any other Church Lima
[44:22] Lorraine Sheffield I'll be edited we all
[44:25] have to answer we just have to answer
[44:27] for Akron Ohio
[44:29] so we've tried I put this into action
[44:31] one time by God's grace God brought
[44:34] relief and he called him fast Joshua
[44:38] called fast they found it they cast the
[44:40] Lots and they can confessed it and they
[44:42] kill they can family at all and burnt
[44:43] their ashes and left it there for
[44:45] memorial and Joshua write off through
[44:47] the battles taking everything without a
[44:49] scratch or wound there you are if the
[44:51] brother okay now that's the story that's
[44:54] exactly gave now I'm using this go I
[44:56] used a few Wednesday's ago I should say
[44:58] few products been two months ago but
[45:00] these services all seen them just go
[45:02] together for me so forgive me you know
[45:04] how you if a brother if you think he's a
[45:07] little wrong or a sister and say Lord
[45:09] don't let me never have the root of
[45:11] bitterness no remember we push on
[45:13] through the bitterness on Sunday
[45:14] don't let me never go root a bitter
[45:16] spring up because it'll affect him
[45:17] it'll take the Christ right out of my
[45:19] life so let's that hold something
[45:21] between heaven well Adam did this to me
[45:22] never called me back and then he said
[45:24] this thing about me and if I don't go to
[45:27] him now that's never happy but I could
[45:30] use anybody my son Malik got you know if
[45:32] we don't go and address that it causes a
[45:36] root of bitterness growth and that will
[45:38] kill the Spirit of God in our lives
[45:41] you don't kill your love for God it'll
[45:44] kill your sweetness by matter what use
[45:46] the word sweet the word won't be so
[45:48] sweet your prayers won't be so sweet the
[45:51] preached you won't be so sweet because
[45:52] the doubler that always causes sweet
[45:54] duh I've tendered of you your heart will
[45:58] be very tender Juanita's be with God
[46:00] right levin exhale take the christ right
[46:04] out of your life if you don't go talk to
[46:06] a brother sister program says the poison
[46:09] acids of malice and jealousy and hatred
[46:13] remember brother had said
[46:14] jealousy is what caused the first war
[46:16] between Cain and Abel remember Cain was
[46:18] jealous and that will just take the Holy
[46:21] Spirit right away from you it will run
[46:23] it in from the Tabernacle in here it
[46:25] will kill the Spirit of God or drive it
[46:27] away from here hurt you're faster it'll
[46:30] do everything don't you do that
[46:32] does that help by God's grace just I'm
[46:35] just bringing that to remind us because
[46:37] I don't know what who was here when I
[46:38] preached the one about unconfessed sin
[46:40] will cause the church severely fail is
[46:42] this on a Sunday night but it's true and
[46:45] it's right from the Bible is from Joshua
[46:47] is also from you know ladarius it's also
[46:49] from other times remember Jesus could
[46:52] not do many mighty works in Nazareth
[46:53] because of unbelief so they shut down
[46:55] the blue of the Holy Spirit now I want
[46:59] to move on that was how your your your
[47:01] heart is in ground and now let's get to
[47:04] how you are playing the cry just want to
[47:06] take them up take about 40 minutes on
[47:08] this okay by God's grace that's a good
[47:10] 40 minutes now go to Colossians chapter
[47:12] 2 verse 1 let's go there now I might
[47:14] need some help reading tonight by God's
[47:15] grace Colossians 2 verse 1 there's two
[47:20] times Paul says that we are rooted in
[47:22] Christ we're actually planted in Christ
[47:25] I think about that were planted in the
[47:27] Holy Spirit
[47:27] we're planted in the love of God we're
[47:30] planet and the Holy One
[47:32] we're planted in The Anointed One sorry
[47:35] I got a position where I haven't planted
[47:39] my location or my residence is in the
[47:43] Holy One amen
[47:45] and when I my flesh or my mind all the
[47:47] time but my soul praise God my soul is
[47:51] in Christ
[47:51] Oh because crisis in me and in my soul
[47:56] right same thing for you the way here in
[47:59] Christ is Christ is in you that's what
[48:04] the Bible explained so let's go to
[48:05] cautions chapter 2 verses 1 to 10
[48:08] I got quite a few scriptures there how
[48:10] about um neither just such yeah I think
[48:14] we have I think we have time can we
[48:16] start with malachite malachite even read
[48:18] verses 1 to 4 I would that you didn't
[48:22] think he knew what great conflict I have
[48:25] for you and Fedele Laodicea and for as
[48:30] many as have not seen my face in the
[48:32] flesh
[48:32] but their hearts might be comforted
[48:34] being knit together in love and unto all
[48:37] riches the fruit of the full assurance
[48:38] of understanding to the acknowledgement
[48:40] of the mystery of God and of the Father
[48:42] and of Christ amen
[48:44] thank you do you like that how they're
[48:46] knitted together University everything
[48:49] about the church as you know something
[48:52] that's knit together like a scarf what
[48:55] are some other things like a blanket it
[48:56] would be knitted together you ever seen
[48:57] a woman knit something that's how the
[49:00] church is supposed to be someone called
[49:02] me yesterday out of the blue I haven't
[49:03] seen them for eight years and there's
[49:06] one of the bank's former friends used to
[49:07] come to church here and he said he said
[49:09] you ever see brother van getting lower
[49:11] you said you ever seen a Devon and these
[49:13] other guys I said I see Megan every week
[49:16] he's there every Sunday twice a week is
[49:19] I used to what most faithful brothers in
[49:21] the church staring he's like oh okay
[49:23] that's wonderful
[49:24] you just said I was on his heart so he
[49:26] called me you know how an actor anymore
[49:29] but he's one of these friends I met him
[49:31] when he first I remember when he come to
[49:32] Bible says when he's doing John's house
[49:34] at my house he would come right in my
[49:36] house and be teaching the word of course
[49:37] you don't follow the message like we do
[49:40] but I just think that's a great example
[49:42] how we're linked together as Christians
[49:44] he want to know if I ever seen them but
[49:48] they and I are knitted together as a
[49:50] family any men whoever you bang goes on
[49:53] Church you're gonna see me right whoever
[49:55] I go yourseif a wide because our lives
[49:57] are gathered together our lives are
[49:59] intertwined don't you like that
[50:01] that's what Paul says our lives the love
[50:04] of God makes our lives intertwined I
[50:06] love you know we had some pictures on
[50:08] the floor a few weeks ago Adams wedding
[50:11] you know with Boeing and often the
[50:14] pictures are on just all bar family with
[50:16] attitude mode
[50:17] I and we could we could retell the story
[50:20] of our lives and the major events of our
[50:22] lives you know get married on January
[50:24] 1st this year the story of our lives
[50:27] should be knit together we don't maybe
[50:29] spend a lot of every day together you
[50:32] know maybe we're together two or three
[50:33] days out of the week but our lives
[50:35] should be knitted together they should
[50:37] be connected we should care about one
[50:39] another's lives we should know what's
[50:41] going on in our to each other's lives
[50:43] right that's what love does I care about
[50:46] how a men's feeling I care about how
[50:47] joses the other men care about how work
[50:49] how's work going you know we want to we
[50:52] want to be connected with one another
[50:54] it's not enough to come to church
[50:56] because anybody can come to church but
[50:58] we must have love that connects our
[51:00] lives together that's what we feel
[51:03] that's why I want to have fellowships
[51:04] and sit down with you and looking across
[51:06] the table and talk with you you know and
[51:08] be and be in fellowship I got it
[51:10] straight to love that now verse three
[51:12] Lydia if you read verses three three
[51:15] four five there come all although I'm
[51:38] not with you at your church I'm there
[51:40] with you in spirit
[51:42] people say that I'll be there in spirit
[51:44] and they joke around about it but it's a
[51:46] reality why because your spirit is one
[51:49] with the Holy Spirit if the Holy
[51:51] Spirit's there that church guess what
[51:53] get your spirit you're there with them
[51:55] because it's the same Holy Spirit's not
[51:57] a different spirit it's the same spirit
[51:59] and you're a part of that spirit that's
[52:02] exactly right Amen I like that
[52:04] hallelujah so why not you know if I lead
[52:07] to preach summer you guys go visit
[52:08] another church somewhere or something
[52:09] like that you can say well I was there
[52:11] with you in spirit I was I was I was
[52:14] preaching alive above I was here with
[52:16] you and accurate in the Holy Spirit
[52:18] because we won the Holy Ghost to move we
[52:21] were worshiping we're all worshipping
[52:22] Him so we work together oh I like this
[52:26] now six
[52:30] we don't have to read six and seven
[52:32] sister bow thank you this is what
[52:48] somebody's like looks like that's a
[52:50] Christian there planted in Christ and
[52:52] they're growing in Christ they're not
[52:54] going anywhere right you know sometimes
[52:58] you can transplant plants right but
[53:01] normally the Sun is out it's part not a
[53:02] good idea to do that very often I don't
[53:04] know you might get the roots made up if
[53:06] I hurt the roots what's that roots gotta
[53:11] come out yeah it's usually not a good
[53:13] thing to do and so the Bible said we're
[53:17] rooted and built up we're supposed to
[53:18] grow in Christ in other words I should
[53:21] see my life becoming more like Jesus
[53:23] Christ we use the example on Sunday the
[53:25] little white button Oh Graham says when
[53:27] you get the Holy Ghost look like a white
[53:28] button and as you get more roots out of
[53:30] your life that grows in you and you
[53:32] share more eternal light in your body
[53:35] amen so it's shining out from your soul
[53:38] it's trying to spread out into your
[53:39] human spirit right and try to spread out
[53:42] and control all your thoughts on your
[53:44] thinking on your plans all your words is
[53:48] trying to sprint up and then you should
[53:50] have bound I have a little bit of
[53:52] Thanksgiving even have a lot of things
[53:53] spinning amen
[53:55] thank you for this Lord thank you with
[53:56] that thank you for all the blessings you
[53:58] about with these that's fruit you're
[54:00] producing now I don't know if you
[54:01] remember I appreciate last year but one
[54:03] of the sacrifices of the Odessa was a
[54:05] bank offering and I use that as a type
[54:09] of a spiritual offering like sometimes
[54:11] we're priests right were priests
[54:13] sometimes all God wants at the end of a
[54:16] service is for you to thank you because
[54:18] that is a sacrifice of praise in the Old
[54:22] Testament that was one of the offerings
[54:23] thank offering you can do sit off free
[54:25] meat offering peace offering but one of
[54:27] those offerings was just a thank
[54:29] offering do you realize how important is
[54:32] sometimes of maybe you didn't hear a
[54:33] whole lot of things doing whatever but
[54:35] God is trying to bring something to your
[54:36] heart and maybe God just wants you to
[54:38] lift your hands in a real heart of
[54:40] Thanksgiving
[54:41] real gratitude not just going through
[54:42] the motions but the real gratitude and
[54:45] Thanksgiving for the crosses United eyes
[54:47] for the Holy Spirit or calling them out
[54:49] of sin or for your most recent healing
[54:51] or for saving this person's soul he just
[54:54] wants to receive some real Thanksgiving
[54:56] because church he's not get that not
[54:58] he's not getting much real Thanksgiving
[55:00] from churches because they're not really
[55:02] thankful they're greedy or the love of
[55:04] the world has entered it they're not
[55:05] really thankful for just Calvary for
[55:08] forgiveness for the walk that they have
[55:10] with the Lord amen
[55:12] so if we're built up and rooted in
[55:14] Christ you should have lots of
[55:16] Thanksgiving we should always be
[55:17] thankful now verse eight beware lest any
[55:21] man spoil you through philosophy and
[55:23] vain deceit after the tradition of men
[55:27] after the rudiments of the world and not
[55:29] after Christ so you've got to be careful
[55:32] when things get preached we got to make
[55:33] sure it's actually the Word of God is
[55:35] preached yeah
[55:36] if a preacher comes in here or if I come
[55:39] in here and hopefully everything you
[55:40] know I preaches the Word of God if not
[55:42] you you need to ask me if I let's say I
[55:45] started reading some books that aren't
[55:46] brother Graner I start getting into some
[55:48] psychology of dr. sons though and I sell
[55:51] bring in psychology and there's no
[55:52] scripture for what should you do you
[55:55] should come to me and talk to me about
[55:56] it because that could spoil your faith
[55:58] for example something like oh you don't
[56:01] have to believe for healing you can
[56:03] remain this and this and you have to
[56:04] that's just how your made up now don't
[56:07] get me wrong there's certain things you
[56:09] know we can talk about we can talk about
[56:10] things but I'm just saying let's say I
[56:13] paint you a picture there's no hope for
[56:15] deliverance but yet the Bible says all
[56:16] things are possible to them who believed
[56:18] that would be baby philosophy there's no
[56:23] hope and that's just the way it's gonna
[56:24] be
[56:24] you've never you're gonna get delivered
[56:26] you couldn't be forgiven that's insane
[56:28] that's philosophy and that's got to be
[56:30] rooted out and only Christ must be
[56:33] preached so he must filter as we know
[56:36] filter everything for the Word of God
[56:38] everything well Graham said take
[56:40] everything I say back to the word and
[56:41] that's what I say to you take everything
[56:43] back to Christ we don't want traditions
[56:48] of Jesse we don't want traditions of
[56:50] Simon traditions of Craig
[56:52] pernicious traditions of any preacher we
[56:55] traditions of the word because the genes
[56:57] that keep my traditions that's actually
[56:59] especially eye cancer that there are
[57:00] good traditions right but we don't want
[57:03] tradition to men you want traditions of
[57:05] Christ might be Boston that's a
[57:07] tradition of Christ right water baptism
[57:10] that's a tradition of Christ those are
[57:13] all good traditions now verse 9 for in
[57:16] and drove all forces of good got it
[57:17] bottled up worse than others and ye are
[57:20] complete in him which is the head of all
[57:23] principality topic praise God so that's
[57:26] a good it's a good review if you're
[57:28] planted in Christ and really drawing as
[57:30] a Christian your bounden Thanksgiving
[57:32] you have a life full of Thanksgiving
[57:34] thank you for my children or thank you
[57:35] for the job thank you for the whole I
[57:37] think right all the time I say Lord
[57:39] thank you for our food shelter clothing
[57:41] and our church that we have when I got
[57:45] back from God I was thanking God for a
[57:47] hot shower because we'd have any hot
[57:48] shower I was thinking God for paved
[57:52] roads because there are going a lot of
[57:55] dirt roads with holes about six feet
[57:57] long and two feet deep it's all as awful
[58:00] conditions I came back thanking God for
[58:03] everything that we have I don't want to
[58:05] forget that we need to thank God for
[58:06] what we have just everything
[58:09] we thank will always give God things
[58:10] that shows you're really rooted your
[58:12] roots are really dumb gone down to
[58:14] Christ because there's nothing good
[58:15] about complaining the roots of Christ so
[58:19] grow in a root of the seat of complain
[58:22] don't shouldn't grow in a Christians
[58:23] heart and I say like the head the seed
[58:26] of complaining shouldn't take root in
[58:27] our lives and for rooted in crisis no
[58:30] room he'll weed out the complaining no
[58:32] root out the pity party I got the worst
[58:36] life or I've got it so hard
[58:37] I've got harder than everybody else well
[58:39] there's somebody that's got it harder
[58:40] than you some way right so let's battle
[58:45] them with Thanksgiving now he brews I'm
[58:48] sorry ninety Ephesians three let's go
[58:50] back to Ephesians three thirteen so
[58:52] alright it's two letters to different
[58:53] churches and he both talks about being
[58:56] rooted in Christ we've gone through how
[58:59] your heart is up ground must you keep
[59:01] your heart rooted I'm sorry I'm sorry
[59:03] you must keep Sid up rooted out of your
[59:05] heart but now we're looking at how you
[59:07] must be
[59:08] planet you and I must be planted in
[59:10] Christ and if we are this is what our
[59:12] lives will produce amen
[59:14] how the new visions 3:13 I said Hebrews
[59:24] 3:13 now one resistance I want to go a
[59:29] bit slower o wherefore I desire that you
[59:33] faint not have my tribulations for you
[59:35] which is your glory
[59:37] okay so Paul's suffering in order to
[59:41] bring the Ephesians the Word of God
[59:44] somehow he's suffering I think at this
[59:46] point you've been arrested if I'm not
[59:47] mistaken cuz he was writing letters he
[59:49] already left Ephesus I mean he was
[59:50] writing letters back to them so he was
[59:52] already a prisoner of the Lord remember
[59:55] he went before Felix and Festus and
[59:57] different ones like that he was a
[59:58] prisoner for quite a long time with it
[1:00:00] she'd say years of his life so he's
[1:00:02] writing them he was a prisoner for their
[1:00:04] sake verse 14 for this cause I bow my
[1:00:10] knees into the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:00:15] heaven earth is named that he meant that
[1:00:19] he would grant you according to the
[1:00:20] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:00:23] with might by his spirit in innovating
[1:00:25] how many one of how many not just want
[1:00:27] to think about how many wanna feel God's
[1:00:29] strength inside man I like I like going
[1:00:33] about my day feeling God's strength
[1:00:35] inside of me that should be a real
[1:00:37] treasure for Christians in it you can
[1:00:39] leave your prayer closet you can leave
[1:00:41] your knees you can leave your house get
[1:00:43] the car and you can feel the strength in
[1:00:45] your life in other words I'm ready for
[1:00:47] those temptations are ready to cast them
[1:00:49] down I'm ready to share my faith with
[1:00:51] somebody I'm ready to tell I'm ready to
[1:00:53] pray for somebody I was go stirred up
[1:00:55] for Christ yesterday after Taekwondo
[1:00:56] when the fighting our boy was leaving
[1:00:58] that said that why is he crying he was
[1:01:00] crying and he's holding his bless I said
[1:01:03] why is he crying he said he got a bad
[1:01:04] headache and I was on fire for Christ I
[1:01:06] was praying the whole practice
[1:01:08] our bachelors talking about God the
[1:01:11] whole time I'm like glory I love this
[1:01:12] class I get the workout and think about
[1:01:15] God the whole time and if you've got me
[1:01:17] just all my heart the first thing I
[1:01:19] thought was can I pray for your son do
[1:01:21] you believe in prayer and I don't know
[1:01:24] what happened that word but I just went
[1:01:25] up to him I laid my hands up and said
[1:01:26] yes we believe in prayer I said the name
[1:01:28] of Jesus Christ that come against this
[1:01:30] headache and I'm just ready why because
[1:01:32] I was strengthened in the inner man they
[1:01:35] have to say well would he be I'd be
[1:01:38] embarrassed if he said no I don't know
[1:01:42] if I can share my faith I wasn't weak in
[1:01:45] the inner man I was strong I was bald I
[1:01:47] said therefore now I've heard about God
[1:01:49] I was working out it was good it was
[1:01:53] good to mr. Valentine he was saying how
[1:01:56] and I'll just very like the message he
[1:01:59] was saying something just exactly like
[1:02:00] the message he was saying how those
[1:02:03] people in power write history the way
[1:02:06] they want to and if there are corrupt
[1:02:09] people in power when they write their
[1:02:11] history books they'll leave things out
[1:02:13] there that should have been in there and
[1:02:15] if she said so that leaves a star on the
[1:02:18] people they don't get the truth
[1:02:20] and he said it's kinda like a Bible if
[1:02:22] you get a Bible and you don't get a part
[1:02:24] of the preach to you and I said I look
[1:02:25] back on you can see me mouthing that's
[1:02:30] the message they have a Bible but it's
[1:02:32] like they're not even here in whole
[1:02:33] entire chapters they're not hearing
[1:02:36] about Malachi 4 they're not hearing
[1:02:39] about revelation 10 or you can hear the
[1:02:41] book of Revelation that's just stuff
[1:02:43] cause some type of misspell what you
[1:02:46] can't understand this but we've got the
[1:02:48] save the Lord on my shirt up he's like
[1:02:52] he's like you were put on earth to share
[1:02:54] what you know I'm so stirred up it
[1:03:02] sounds ready and we're gonna have
[1:03:04] strength don't you that we're all gonna
[1:03:09] get weak Church what do you gotta do to
[1:03:10] feed that white dog so you feel strong
[1:03:13] again like you you're ready to fight the
[1:03:15] devil not not an arrogant way to say I
[1:03:18] won't bring on the devil but I'm ready
[1:03:20] for you singing
[1:03:21] I'm gonna cash it out never temptation
[1:03:24] whatever device comes my way we're to
[1:03:26] recognize it and pass it down to move
[1:03:27] forward in Christ's plan appreciate that
[1:03:32] was not mine Oakland now he says this
[1:03:34] verse seventeen yep now I got in
[1:03:38] something up that Christ may dwell in
[1:03:41] your hearts by faith so he draws has a
[1:03:44] substance of pain that you such you and
[1:03:47] I have been rooted and grounded in love
[1:03:49] so what are we planted in church the
[1:03:51] love of God aren't you glad not the
[1:03:55] anger of God we're not going to anger
[1:03:56] God we're playing the love of God is
[1:04:00] love directed you better believe now
[1:04:02] this practice but we're not in the anger
[1:04:04] and indignation and judgment of God
[1:04:06] we're planted in God's love amen
[1:04:09] so that's where we should stand isn't
[1:04:12] the love of God and if your love are
[1:04:16] they then that you and I may be able to
[1:04:19] comprehend that means to obtain or
[1:04:21] proceed we should be able to perceive or
[1:04:25] understand with all saints so brothers
[1:04:28] and sisters you understand and we're
[1:04:31] planning to God's love we should be able
[1:04:33] to understand what is the breath which
[1:04:35] is the wick of God's love how why does
[1:04:37] God's love to see where this is going
[1:04:40] how do I use God though we sing that
[1:04:42] song so why you can't get around it Oh
[1:04:47] wonderful love that's the length of
[1:04:52] God's love how long is God's love hello
[1:04:54] mrs. know how wide is it how long is it
[1:04:58] what is the death of deep this God's
[1:05:00] love go and how high does God's love see
[1:05:06] the picture there Paul say all saints
[1:05:10] seem to understand that love at least
[1:05:13] Apollo has four dimensions to it right
[1:05:17] now that chair in front of you the chair
[1:05:19] sitting on it's got three dimensions
[1:05:20] it's got a length or width and height
[1:05:23] right but the Bible says that God's love
[1:05:27] has the fourth dimension
[1:05:30] it's gonna be safe I hope I don't lose
[1:05:33] it people exist I'm not a very smart
[1:05:34] person unemployment I teach first grade
[1:05:36] these are all basic stuff but the Bible
[1:05:40] said that we if we have this will know
[1:05:42] the love of God if we can see there's
[1:05:45] four parts to God's love we can know his
[1:05:49] love and understand it to a degree now
[1:05:52] now I'm not talking about you eternally
[1:05:54] understand everything about God's love
[1:05:55] that's not what I'm saying but you can
[1:05:58] understand God's love to a great a
[1:06:00] fourth degree or fourth dimension a
[1:06:03] fourth measure there's four descriptions
[1:06:05] to it that we can all understand and I
[1:06:07] believe you do but let's go through the
[1:06:08] scriptures on so we can see it because
[1:06:12] this will pass all your knowledge to
[1:06:16] understand the breadth the width the
[1:06:18] length and the height and the depth that
[1:06:19] he might be filled with all the force of
[1:06:21] God so if we really love this if we
[1:06:25] really get to know God's love will be
[1:06:27] filled with God's love if we're planning
[1:06:30] God's love what does the roots do it
[1:06:32] bringe what's already in the ground up
[1:06:33] into the plant how are you and if your
[1:06:35] planet in Christ and Christ is love then
[1:06:38] to all that will come into you will be
[1:06:40] past love it so simple if we're rooted
[1:06:45] in love then the fullness of love is
[1:06:48] going to fill us because we're planted
[1:06:50] in Christ
[1:06:52] now last week I'm not mistaken or maybe
[1:06:55] it was too even and I'm gonna spend two
[1:06:56] weeks ago forgetting we preach on the
[1:06:58] death of Satan versus the depth of God
[1:07:00] remember this it was the last church aid
[1:07:02] or the last time to your message I
[1:07:04] preached you you must bend to mensies
[1:07:06] we're going to talk about how the fire
[1:07:09] to your church age the churches that
[1:07:11] were off the word has a depth of Satan
[1:07:14] which turned out to be what murders and
[1:07:17] created murders lies abuse neglect all
[1:07:23] kinds of evil that was the depth of
[1:07:25] Satan and yet they joined church and
[1:07:27] they went to church every Sunday so see
[1:07:29] there was a false Christian life that is
[1:07:32] the death of Satan but memorable and
[1:07:34] said was the death of Christ was the man
[1:07:37] said it's very simple to know what the
[1:07:38] depth of God is and what did you read he
[1:07:40] read the verses I just read to you what
[1:07:43] is the death of God he
[1:07:44] says you're rooted and grounded in love
[1:07:47] well Graham said if you want to be deep
[1:07:49] and if you wouldn't be somebody
[1:07:51] see how humble you can be and trying to
[1:07:53] love everybody if you want to be
[1:07:57] everyone to be deeper in God how many
[1:07:59] want to be a real deep in Christ and
[1:08:00] grow deeper in love love more people
[1:08:04] especially your enemies especially those
[1:08:09] who say evil things against you that's
[1:08:12] the person to love I know it's hard
[1:08:13] truth but if we're rooting right of love
[1:08:15] we'll pull up that love right into our
[1:08:16] lives I gotta go see the home no I gotta
[1:08:19] come to church gotta hear the word of
[1:08:21] God you two get up watching the matrix
[1:08:24] you're gonna get a box
[1:08:26] Despicable Me part 3 you're not gonna
[1:08:29] get Christ's love that way yeah that's
[1:08:31] what you're planning on you let me play
[1:08:33] the Christ amen look if he says no one
[1:08:39] has a record of these verses then he's
[1:08:41] was three sixteen seventeen eighteen
[1:08:42] when a man experienced the death of God
[1:08:45] is life it's an actual personal
[1:08:47] experience of the Spirit of God in
[1:08:49] dwelling at him and noticed so this is
[1:08:51] your soul and his mind is illuminated by
[1:08:54] the wisdom I want to stop right there
[1:08:58] because we could go on I'm not gonna go
[1:09:00] not going to go the debts of safety so
[1:09:02] I've already preached on that it
[1:09:03] produces killing it's a church 20 spirit
[1:09:05] that they gathered announcer another
[1:09:08] interest in the launcher so what I want
[1:09:12] to focus on tonight in the last twenty
[1:09:14] two minutes we're really it's your mind
[1:09:17] how many appreciate you how God give you
[1:09:20] a spirit and you can have the right
[1:09:22] thinking amen
[1:09:23] how many dogs the greatest I love the
[1:09:25] phone someone look again at the mind
[1:09:28] because this is what the Bible teaches
[1:09:30] All Saints should be able to understand
[1:09:32] that Jose Livia all of us I complained
[1:09:35] all of us should understand the love of
[1:09:37] God and we understand the love of God in
[1:09:39] these four ways then we should be filled
[1:09:42] with all the fullness of God which is
[1:09:43] God's love right that's a paul says if
[1:09:47] you're really planted in Christ should
[1:09:48] be full of God's love so and I think
[1:09:51] this is what happened I think we forget
[1:09:53] about what God's love means to us and we
[1:09:55] get discouraged we stop beating
[1:09:56] ourselves up for
[1:09:57] own worst critic I know at least that's
[1:09:59] my life many times I've battled that
[1:10:00] beat my own worst critic I feel like
[1:10:03] I've done wrong and I think I've hurt
[1:10:04] somebody and really in all reality I
[1:10:05] never had you know I just jump to the
[1:10:07] wrong conclusion like I did something
[1:10:08] wrong
[1:10:09] I've got to go talk to the person you
[1:10:11] know because I always beat myself up you
[1:10:13] know like I did some pro my own worst
[1:10:15] critic now let's get that no let me
[1:10:18] let's go to this in the next 20 minutes
[1:10:20] we must use our minds that's a program
[1:10:22] said the personal experience with Christ
[1:10:25] is more of a reality when our minds are
[1:10:28] illuminated to the love of God so we
[1:10:31] must use our minds and remember the love
[1:10:33] of God this will transform our lives the
[1:10:38] numbers you'll think a transform fault
[1:10:40] life your thought to be transformed if
[1:10:42] you think about it remember the love of
[1:10:44] God you never think about go ahead to be
[1:10:46] different right you'll be able to think
[1:10:48] about work different I'll be able to
[1:10:50] think about work with a better attitude
[1:10:51] right cuz I got the love of God oh I've
[1:10:54] actually a missionary to my own school
[1:10:56] right I'm a missionary to my job I'm a
[1:11:00] missionary to my neighbors see you're
[1:11:02] getting your mug it's transformed to the
[1:11:04] love of God that's what the Bible says
[1:11:09] we're not conformed we're not being
[1:11:10] shaped more like the world
[1:11:11] we're being conformed and transformed by
[1:11:13] the renewing of our mind that's what the
[1:11:16] preaching is supposed to do I don't want
[1:11:18] to wear you out and preach but I want to
[1:11:20] preach long enough so that you start
[1:11:21] thinking about God and me too I think of
[1:11:24] this I'll take this servant with me
[1:11:26] tomorrow when I go where I go but I
[1:11:30] don't have I'll have strength within me
[1:11:32] someone that evil comes I'll strength to
[1:11:34] withstand it and how does that happen
[1:11:37] I read your mind and remember renew
[1:11:40] means to renovate yeah I remember when
[1:11:42] we renovated this room this is awful
[1:11:44] dirty I remember running through Anthony
[1:11:46] Bennett made this whole place
[1:11:48] forgive me stumble over my work there's
[1:11:51] a lot of renovation that need to be done
[1:11:52] filled on a drywall paint in scrap
[1:11:55] sanded down the walls tearing out all
[1:11:58] the carpet characters old nasty moldy
[1:12:00] carpet out of here there's a lot of
[1:12:02] renovations that need to be done but
[1:12:04] what do we got now well I got a place
[1:12:05] that's a little bit better you are not
[1:12:08] originally doing down with us a little
[1:12:09] bit better it's renovated it looks clean
[1:12:11] listen ooh you should be able to smell
[1:12:13] the carpet for a while and people should
[1:12:15] smell the sweetness of God in your life
[1:12:16] and appearances like a garden when you
[1:12:19] praise I going to garden and you should
[1:12:20] smell and we seen that song that dew is
[1:12:22] still on the roses
[1:12:23] we should smell the roses people should
[1:12:25] smell the sweetness of Christ on your
[1:12:27] life so we want to renovate your mind
[1:12:31] and when we renovate your mind what I
[1:12:33] mean is you change your thinking habits
[1:12:34] so you only think good about your
[1:12:37] enemies oh how can I love this person
[1:12:39] this teacher always in the streets mean
[1:12:40] how can I love them I had to do that
[1:12:42] last year I teach you to like me and
[1:12:44] wouldn't even talk to me I walk in the
[1:12:45] hallway you wouldn't even look at me I
[1:12:47] kept saying lord help me Lord and pretty
[1:12:49] soon they drop something and I'd be able
[1:12:50] to pick it up and say here you go and
[1:12:52] they'd have to recognize me there
[1:12:54] I'd say lord help you up
[1:12:56] help me up you know just show me love
[1:12:59] how it is there's nothing to show a lot
[1:13:01] you know because we have to change
[1:13:04] something at all this person hates me
[1:13:05] I'll never be able to instead think of
[1:13:08] that show love change your thought
[1:13:11] that's renewing your mind and that if
[1:13:13] you can change your habits of how do you
[1:13:15] think that will transform your life do
[1:13:19] it and then I guess then you can find
[1:13:23] the perfect will of God this is why
[1:13:25] people can never find the purple rule of
[1:13:26] God what am i doing in my life what's my
[1:13:28] purpose in life they don't get their
[1:13:30] minds renewed by the word they let their
[1:13:33] minds be unrung on unrenovated they
[1:13:36] don't thing on their minds they do
[1:13:37] something new with their thinking they
[1:13:39] always think the same thoughts instead
[1:13:41] of thinking what the word says now let's
[1:13:43] go this I got the 17 minutes here here
[1:13:46] with me now you saw it right you saw the
[1:13:48] Bible love's got four dimensions right
[1:13:52] it's got four dimensions now if you
[1:13:54] notice the future home only has three
[1:13:56] dimensions so if you look at revelation
[1:13:59] 21 16 we're out of time but the
[1:14:01] revelations 21 16 says there's thirteen
[1:14:05] thousand furlongs that I forgot many was
[1:14:07] it has the same number of furlongs for
[1:14:09] the breath as the length and the height
[1:14:12] but it doesn't have a depth I'm just
[1:14:16] pointing something out I'm not gonna be
[1:14:17] able to explain this the missing of
[1:14:18] depth I'm not really gonna explain that
[1:14:19] because I don't know I I don't know I'm
[1:14:21] not gonna try to make something up
[1:14:23] but I know the future home has three
[1:14:26] measurements a length a width and a
[1:14:29] height in Sioux pyramid right number but
[1:14:32] God's love has another dimension it has
[1:14:35] depth praise God that's the Word of God
[1:14:39] you can look it up yeah future only has
[1:14:41] three dimensions but love as it's worth
[1:14:43] them now you probably know this book
[1:14:46] value is measured like times width times
[1:14:49] height right but a volume of a pyramid
[1:14:51] so the future home you got in length
[1:14:53] times width times height times 1/3
[1:14:55] because it's missing a third of them the
[1:14:58] value because it's not a cutie it's a
[1:15:02] triangle triangle point to it so volume
[1:15:05] is the amount of space occupied by a
[1:15:07] three-dimensional object as measured in
[1:15:10] cubic units okay so that's just become a
[1:15:12] scientific definition so the future home
[1:15:14] has value right but it's only got three
[1:15:17] dimensions
[1:15:19] now the Britannica says that dimension
[1:15:22] is a measurement of an object but it
[1:15:25] says three dimensional three dimensions
[1:15:29] measure spaces so like the chair or this
[1:15:32] open this hat this is three dimensional
[1:15:34] has length width height and it measures
[1:15:36] the space that this Pope it occupies
[1:15:40] right in space but a fourth dimension
[1:15:44] gets into time so when you have a four
[1:15:48] dimensions now you start measuring time
[1:15:50] right where four numbers are needed to
[1:15:53] characterize a point three to fix a
[1:15:55] point in space and one to fix the time
[1:15:59] right so I can't explain this very well
[1:16:02] like I said I'm not a man I'm not a
[1:16:04] doctorate of science I had very little
[1:16:06] science training in school but I've done
[1:16:09] a three dimensional figure who's got a
[1:16:12] three dimension has length width height
[1:16:14] but a fourth dimension now places the
[1:16:17] time so this pulpit in time is right
[1:16:19] here in 2017 if you went back to 2001 in
[1:16:24] the time and the fourth dimension this
[1:16:26] would have been in Florida Ohio Craig
[1:16:27] and days house though so if you measure
[1:16:32] the fourth dimension this would have
[1:16:34] been western Ohio
[1:16:35] now we take the fourth dimension today
[1:16:37] now it's in Akron Ohio in 2017 because
[1:16:41] we're measuring a different measurement
[1:16:43] we're measuring time so length width
[1:16:45] height right here it's occupying this
[1:16:47] but where does it were when is it what
[1:16:50] is it being measured it's being measured
[1:16:51] right now so that's just one example of
[1:16:54] a four dimensional measurement right you
[1:16:56] never understand that is okay you also
[1:16:59] mention the time not just the length
[1:17:01] width height but that's time when did it
[1:17:03] happen okay now I want to just lay this
[1:17:06] in here and hope this doesn't go over
[1:17:08] your head but I believe these four tie
[1:17:11] in perfectly with the four powers got be
[1:17:14] must because the powers of power what
[1:17:17] the Holy Ghost and what does the Holy
[1:17:19] Ghost love so I believe these four
[1:17:23] powers type perfectly with the four
[1:17:27] descriptions of God love it's easiest to
[1:17:30] start here which of these anointings
[1:17:32] goes the highest mutters there's a lion
[1:17:36] ox with Mary go go higher
[1:17:39] are you with me and flying eagle goes
[1:17:42] higher than all of them man you're heavy
[1:17:44] now when we get to the depth of God's
[1:17:47] love this that actually means is thank
[1:17:49] you
[1:17:50] so the of these 3 remaining anointings
[1:17:54] which one is the deepest man has the
[1:17:56] deepest intelligence yeah that's why you
[1:18:00] still alive in the dinosaurs aren't
[1:18:01] right there's some other reasons what I
[1:18:02] do or the what are some extinct animals
[1:18:05] the dodo bird right yeah what's that
[1:18:07] other five dog one what's that dog when
[1:18:09] we talked about me okay how's me that's
[1:18:12] a mean tiger yeah little dog looks like
[1:18:13] a tiger has broke beautiful beautiful
[1:18:15] animal but it succeed now but it didn't
[1:18:19] survive because the man was smarter
[1:18:21] right my man had more understanding to
[1:18:22] kill him right now late this long which
[1:18:26] of these animals can labor the longest
[1:18:28] the ice he'll work all day just God said
[1:18:33] just get one day off on Sunday
[1:18:34] all right get your animals and they are
[1:18:36] us he can labor in how long enema now
[1:18:39] breath is the widest which man's which
[1:18:41] these has the widest Dominion a lion has
[1:18:44] the widest Dominion he rules
[1:18:46] the entire kingdom amen that's rad pipe
[1:18:49] down this is the one that maybe I got a
[1:18:51] little bit I could fix this a little bit
[1:18:53] but these three can clearly be see I'm
[1:18:56] just gonna lay that in there God's love
[1:18:59] has four aspects to it
[1:19:01] four elements that we're supposed to
[1:19:02] understand can we see that
[1:19:05] so to comprehend the love of Christ that
[1:19:09] we are planted in we must think God's
[1:19:13] love has breadth or width God's love is
[1:19:16] wide
[1:19:16] God's love is long right God's love is
[1:19:21] deep or this case deep in God's mind and
[1:19:25] also God's love has height grace God
[1:19:29] it's got four dimensions to it so let's
[1:19:33] just quickly go for this I got about 12
[1:19:35] minutes so let's go to this oh this is
[1:19:37] okay enjoying this hi God's grace I just
[1:19:40] want you to know that this is inspired
[1:19:42] God's Word is inspired if God love has
[1:19:44] four parts there's got to be four parts
[1:19:46] to it somewhere it has to have another
[1:19:48] dimension other than just length width
[1:19:50] height range it's got something greater
[1:19:52] dimension there's just something natural
[1:19:54] because it's supernatural
[1:19:56] now God's love as Rebecca or we'd say
[1:19:59] with and Psalms 103 12 tells us that
[1:20:03] God's love has the wit to it God's love
[1:20:05] is so wide here's what it says as far as
[1:20:08] the east is from the west so far we have
[1:20:11] removed our transgressions from us
[1:20:14] memory see that God steps it in his love
[1:20:18] and he moves my Sid and completely as
[1:20:22] far as the East is from the West as far
[1:20:26] wide as that could possibly be measured
[1:20:27] God's love separates me from my sin in
[1:20:31] such a wit that I can't even comprehend
[1:20:33] him they met in church if you know
[1:20:37] science scientists can't even measure
[1:20:40] how big the universes they can't even
[1:20:42] measure they have no way to measure and
[1:20:44] it's constantly expanding to do I side
[1:20:48] into what he didn't he didn't publish
[1:20:49] that at first he thought it was a fixed
[1:20:51] system he thought the universe was a
[1:20:52] fixed system
[1:20:53] he'd never expanded but it was in his
[1:20:54] notes yet in his notes and then later
[1:20:57] after he died it got his nose and they
[1:20:58] found out
[1:20:59] hey he didn't believe this he just
[1:21:00] didn't publish you because even I'm not
[1:21:02] proof for it the universe is constantly
[1:21:04] expanding so what does that mean what
[1:21:07] does it mean for us if you look at this
[1:21:08] it means our sins are so far we can't
[1:21:11] even we don't have to worry about
[1:21:12] they're so far from us crisis love was
[1:21:14] totally stepped in and it separate us as
[1:21:16] far as East is from the West from our
[1:21:18] sins that make you love the Lord if you
[1:21:23] really believe that then you should be
[1:21:24] like this woman jesus said her sins
[1:21:26] which are many are forgiven for she
[1:21:28] loved much this means forgiveness of
[1:21:32] this multitude should make you love
[1:21:34] Christ if Christ love is so wide that it
[1:21:39] separates you so far from all your awful
[1:21:42] sins that should produce a great love
[1:21:44] inside of your heart hey then it's God's
[1:21:48] love white church you better believe it
[1:21:49] it's so wide it separates all your sins
[1:21:52] from you amen and this is one of the
[1:21:55] elements of God's love we must remember
[1:21:58] remember Cain said where they live right
[1:22:00] at the door where are your sins why
[1:22:02] farmers and East is from the West
[1:22:05] that's exactly right church that's the
[1:22:08] Word of God degree then how many believe
[1:22:10] that Scripture right there it's so far
[1:22:12] you can't it's just like the end of the
[1:22:14] universe you can't even see it so your
[1:22:16] sins are that far gone as well
[1:22:18] alright let's see the next one God's
[1:22:20] love has length not love lasts a long
[1:22:24] time so I'm 23 6 surely goodness and
[1:22:28] mercy shall follow me what all the days
[1:22:31] of my life it's so long brother amen it
[1:22:35] lasts all my days God's mercy for me
[1:22:38] it's not going to quit when I turn 40
[1:22:41] which I'm getting closer it's not going
[1:22:43] to quit when I turn 50
[1:22:45] it's not going to quit it lasts so long
[1:22:47] it's all of my days hallelujah the Bible
[1:22:52] says I will seen the mercy Lord forever
[1:22:53] with my mouth why make known by
[1:22:55] faithfulness to all generations Christ
[1:22:59] and mercy shall be build up for how long
[1:23:01] this mercy lasts forever amen
[1:23:04] beyond my generation if there's another
[1:23:06] generation they met which is now title
[1:23:08] insurance if there's another generation
[1:23:11] we go off the scene God's mercy
[1:23:13] said to that generation that's how long
[1:23:15] it is it's wide enough to separate us
[1:23:17] from our sins and it's long enough to
[1:23:19] extend for all of your life and then all
[1:23:21] generations amen now you're getting
[1:23:24] though the love of God now a church you
[1:23:26] should feel the love of God because
[1:23:28] that's what's planted in the ground
[1:23:30] that's what's in Christ and that should
[1:23:33] be building you up to know God's love
[1:23:35] for man hey remember that don't see what
[1:23:39] God's love to love other people same
[1:23:42] idea the length of God's love for the
[1:23:45] Lord is good as mercy as what never
[1:23:47] lasts
[1:23:47] it's so long it'll last forever his
[1:23:51] truth endureth to up all generations
[1:23:54] this message truth and we preach will go
[1:23:58] to every generation again I'm just glad
[1:24:01] I'm just glad to stand for my generation
[1:24:03] church I'm just happy to be one of those
[1:24:06] that will stand in this generation but
[1:24:08] this truth will keep going to every
[1:24:10] generation God will never leave himself
[1:24:12] without a witness why this is love is so
[1:24:15] long in the last average information
[1:24:17] look at God told Israel I love Israel
[1:24:20] without the baptism Holy Ghost without
[1:24:22] his sealing them how much more wouldn't
[1:24:24] love us because the Lord what did God
[1:24:28] hate Israel know he loved them and
[1:24:31] because he would he would keep the oath
[1:24:33] which he had sworn on your father's
[1:24:35] house the Lord brought you out with a
[1:24:36] mighty hand and redeemed you are the
[1:24:38] house of diamonds from the hand of
[1:24:39] Pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore
[1:24:41] that the LORD thy God He is God the
[1:24:44] faithful God
[1:24:45] hurry that again he is God the faithful
[1:24:48] God which keepeth covenant and mercy
[1:24:51] with them that loveth honey love them
[1:24:53] and heat Commandments - how many a
[1:24:56] thousand generation and glory
[1:25:00] this is just our generation right this
[1:25:03] and this scriptures true and he loved me
[1:25:05] in my generation he's all of 900 but
[1:25:09] night Leonard there's a thousand five
[1:25:11] hundred ninety-nine right 999 more
[1:25:14] generations what does he say he say my
[1:25:16] love will never fail my love is so long
[1:25:20] it will not feel any generation that's
[1:25:22] glorious church it might seem like God's
[1:25:25] love is failure
[1:25:26] you know we don't see God's love look to
[1:25:27] the believer they enjoy it every day
[1:25:29] they thank God for it every day because
[1:25:32] they're abounding with Thanksgiving they
[1:25:34] met in the promises of God so you see
[1:25:37] how this is very simple anybody see that
[1:25:38] the four parts of God's love it's why
[1:25:42] it's different so wide it separates us
[1:25:44] from all of our sin before you it's so
[1:25:47] long it goes to all of my life and a
[1:25:49] thousand generations and now it's so
[1:25:52] deep that it goes back into the deep
[1:25:55] parts of God's mind before the
[1:25:57] foundation of the world the Bible said
[1:26:00] all of the depths of the riches of the
[1:26:02] wisdom and knowledge of God how
[1:26:04] unsearchable are judgments and his ways
[1:26:05] past finding out who have known the what
[1:26:08] mind of the Lord or who has been his
[1:26:11] counselor so what are the depths of God
[1:26:13] me the depths of God meet the plan of
[1:26:16] God that was in his mind way before we
[1:26:18] even got here that was God's love that
[1:26:22] means he was thinking loving thoughts to
[1:26:23] you and I don't appreciate his life
[1:26:28] hey visions too far but God who is rich
[1:26:32] in mercy for his not just love but great
[1:26:35] love amen
[1:26:37] where it wherewith he loved us aren't
[1:26:40] you glad he loved you in a great way
[1:26:41] even when we were dead in sins even when
[1:26:44] I was living in the sinner smoking
[1:26:45] drinking and all kinds of evil even when
[1:26:48] I was dead in my sins he quickened us
[1:26:51] together with Christ by grace he are
[1:26:54] saving man and have raised us up
[1:26:56] together and made us sit together in
[1:26:58] heavenly places in Christ Jesus did you
[1:27:01] catch that church the Bible said he
[1:27:04] quickened us with Christ praise the Lord
[1:27:08] when you were dead and sin before you
[1:27:10] came to Christ he already quickened you
[1:27:13] with Christ why did he quit in Christ
[1:27:15] well when he filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:16] but then he quickened his body you'd
[1:27:18] raise him up from the dead
[1:27:19] praise the Lord so when he quicken
[1:27:23] Christ he actually quicken you why
[1:27:24] because you were already in him praise
[1:27:27] God because the Spirit of God was in him
[1:27:29] and you've got a part of God's Spirit
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:31] hi there yeah did the Bible say the
[1:27:34] fullness of the Godhead but he was in
[1:27:36] Christ all that God was was a
[1:27:39] somebody understand that so God's all
[1:27:42] God's Spirit powers in Christ right so
[1:27:45] you are part of Christ you're a seat of
[1:27:48] is your pardon
[1:27:49] so when he raised up Christ you read him
[1:27:51] a part of you was it in him amen oh and
[1:27:55] also before knew you in his night and he
[1:27:59] had raised us up together and made us
[1:28:01] sit in heavenly places so you know we
[1:28:03] don't they live in the we rather live in
[1:28:05] the dump Church we can live in heavenly
[1:28:08] areas praise God we can live in a
[1:28:10] heavenly realm of Jesus aren't you glad
[1:28:12] you could do that whoever wants to live
[1:28:15] here depression and fear their whole
[1:28:16] life who wants to live a life of
[1:28:18] depression and drudgery and hopelessness
[1:28:22] does anybody want to do that here
[1:28:23] no he raised us up so we would sit in
[1:28:27] heavenly places spiritual things
[1:28:29] spiritual promises hold joy love a
[1:28:33] future that's what God promised us we
[1:28:36] should live in heavenly place man for
[1:28:39] when you and I were yet without strength
[1:28:41] in due time Christ died for us the
[1:28:44] ungodly but God commended or meaning
[1:28:48] validated his love toward us in that
[1:28:50] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:28:52] for us much more than now being
[1:28:55] justified by his blood we should be
[1:28:57] saved from wrath through Eden honey
[1:28:59] justified today if you repented and got
[1:29:01] baptized you're justified how many God
[1:29:03] how he justifies today man that means
[1:29:05] you're righteous he declares your exits
[1:29:08] that means you didn't says never sit in
[1:29:09] the first place
[1:29:10] praise God that's a justification means
[1:29:12] you're declared he calls you you're
[1:29:13] righteous your sins went upon him but
[1:29:17] now you're righteous gonna be happy
[1:29:18] tonight my god so we ought to be happy
[1:29:21] in here about the love of God this is
[1:29:23] what it means my sin well here I kind of
[1:29:28] issue it on him and his holiness is on
[1:29:30] me because I'm planted in him
[1:29:34] I planted the garden of the perfect love
[1:29:37] of God amen glory house not going to
[1:29:39] condemn me when I'm playing it is the
[1:29:41] love of God and the Spirit of Christ
[1:29:43] when I'm in Christ how can he get me
[1:29:45] can't because I'm in Christ born this is
[1:29:50] one of the most lovely scriptures in the
[1:29:51] Bible according as
[1:29:53] he chose us in him before the foundation
[1:29:56] of the world
[1:29:57] how deep is God's love brother and
[1:30:00] sister it's so deep he chose us before
[1:30:03] the world was ever was and he knew well
[1:30:05] in 2017 I'll need a bride there she'll
[1:30:07] have to be a certain type of person
[1:30:09] chapters to love God and I'll I'll
[1:30:11] arranged it i'll predestinate them to be
[1:30:13] conformed to the image of jesus and
[1:30:16] they'll just be waiting to hear my word
[1:30:18] they might not even know if somebody
[1:30:19] really hungry for more and others might
[1:30:21] just be on the road but I'll make myself
[1:30:23] known to them and when I make myself
[1:30:25] notice them
[1:30:26] this spirit of the word the water will
[1:30:29] fall on that seat in their soul and
[1:30:31] it'll spring forth and then we're
[1:30:33] screwed and they'll be rooted and
[1:30:35] grounded gonna be planted in living
[1:30:37] water let me plant it in Christ amen
[1:30:39] hallelujah where'd he chooses in his
[1:30:43] mind in the depths of his mind imagine
[1:30:47] we have a hard enough time just keeping
[1:30:48] our schedules can you imagine God's
[1:30:50] schedule then he had his mind think of
[1:30:53] 1999 and 2000 we gotta think of all
[1:30:57] these events and he had all this planned
[1:30:59] is where the depths of his mind
[1:31:01] the breadth the length and the depth of
[1:31:04] gun how many see God's love so far in
[1:31:06] those three Oh glory go is my love it's
[1:31:12] long love his deep love in the parts of
[1:31:16] his mind

[1:31:20] time run over but if you read that whole
[1:31:21] first chapter it's one of most mortgage
[1:31:23] hackers in the Bible that was not just
[1:31:26] read lesson that we should be walk to
[1:31:28] the praise of his glory we should live
[1:31:30] our lives to praise Him because he loved
[1:31:33] us first and chose us to be his children
[1:31:36] last one so I'm almost done by God's

[1:31:49] kids sometimes I forget about my our
[1:31:51] God's love has hiked let me know that
[1:31:55] now the Bible says in Psalm 139 that his
[1:31:59] thoughts are so high but I don't look at
[1:32:02] this don't look at another phone this

[1:32:45] our sins nor rewarded US according to
[1:32:47] our iniquities how many can say matter
[1:32:48] that gozman we're better team than you
[1:32:50] deserve for as the heaviness high above
[1:32:53] the earth so great is his mercy for them
[1:32:57] appeared we just said that the heavens
[1:33:00] right in space the heavens the
[1:33:02] atmospheres they're so high above and
[1:33:05] that is a figure for us to see how great
[1:33:09] God's mercy is for us
[1:33:10] if you everything God's done with you
[1:33:12] all you have to do the Bible says it
[1:33:13] look at the clouds I want you to just
[1:33:16] look at the heavens look at space but
[1:33:18] look at space look at the Stars one time
[1:33:20] if you ever think God's mercy love is
[1:33:22] ran out for you God set those things
[1:33:24] with the bottom st. for signs and
[1:33:26] seasons for a sign to show you how much
[1:33:29] mercy he has for you
[1:33:34] Psalms 108 for for thy mercy is great
[1:33:37] above the heavens and thy truth reaches
[1:33:41] unto the clouds I said this on Sunday
[1:33:44] were you getting which hope we have as
[1:33:46] an anchor of the soul so our souls are
[1:33:50] anchored in the hope of Christ well sure
[1:33:53] in fact said fast and which enters into
[1:33:56] within the mail so our hope enters into
[1:33:59] the heavenly temple the seventh
[1:34:02] dimension
[1:34:03] whither the forerunner is for us entered
[1:34:06] even Jesus made after a knock made and
[1:34:10] high priest forever after the order of
[1:34:12] Melchizedek let's review our wedding
[1:34:17] we must use our minds and remember the
[1:34:19] love of God
[1:34:20] All Saints you're trying to remember
[1:34:21] this we try to do in church and try to
[1:34:25] remember how wide God's love is for you
[1:34:27] how long does God's love last how deep
[1:34:30] this God's love go how high is God's
[1:34:33] love to you I would say it's very high I
[1:34:37] would say it's very great then if we if
[1:34:41] we thought about God's love like that
[1:34:43] all the time
[1:34:43] we the Bible said will be filled with
[1:34:45] all the fullness of God this is how much
[1:34:47] God loves me it's not much god bless you
[1:34:50] Christ love put a wide distance between
[1:34:52] us and our sins the length of Christ's
[1:34:55] love is unending forever the depth of
[1:34:59] Christ's love prepared for and planned
[1:35:02] for our part even crucified Jesus in his
[1:35:04] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:35:06] in perfect plan for our quickening and
[1:35:09] our acceptance in the beloved and that's
[1:35:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:14] that's the best answer just a lot easier
[1:35:16] than writing it all out that's what
[1:35:19] God's love did for you and I it has a
[1:35:21] whole plan I'm gonna plan out I'm gonna
[1:35:23] make sure everything goes the planet
[1:35:25] sometimes our plans fail right but you
[1:35:27] better believe God's plan for you my man
[1:35:29] you submit and humble yourself to God's
[1:35:31] love this plan for you will be perfect
[1:35:34] it might not be without paying sorrows
[1:35:36] with etiquette the Bible said of Christ
[1:35:38] supper we have to suffer how many want
[1:35:40] to reign with Christ every little throne
[1:35:42] with Christ the Bible said if you want
[1:35:44] to reign with him you have to suffer
[1:35:45] with him so part of my story part of the
[1:35:48] plan God has for me is going to involve
[1:35:50] some suffering but I'm willing to endure
[1:35:52] it so I can sit by him and I can partake
[1:35:55] the but he partook so I understand what
[1:35:57] he went through in a little measure and
[1:35:59] that's how I show my love to is by
[1:36:02] saying yes Lord I hope I'll suffer but
[1:36:04] I'll do it for your glory because I know
[1:36:06] you love me
[1:36:07] ultimately above all finished I know you
[1:36:09] loved and I don't want to forget that
[1:36:12] that you love me Jesus the love of
[1:36:16] Christ is so high that it reaches to the
[1:36:18] heavens even to the very throne Christ
[1:36:22] that's how great he just loved this
[1:36:24] posture how can how can I show my love
[1:36:28] to God if God loves me that much in four
[1:36:30] dimensions if God loves me that much
[1:36:34] how can I show my love brother it tells
[1:36:36] us he says the cloudy skies and storms a
[1:36:39] lot let's hit our feet here the cloudy
[1:36:40] skies in storms of life are no signs of
[1:36:43] God's disapproval see when you go
[1:36:45] through a trial that doesn't mean nouns
[1:36:46] disapproving with your life neither our
[1:36:48] bright skies and still other signs of
[1:36:50] God love and approval his approval of
[1:36:52] any of us is only in the beloved which
[1:36:55] is headed
[1:36:57] his love is elected which he had for us
[1:37:01] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:03] does he love us yes but how should we
[1:37:08] know there's two ways my mansion will
[1:37:10] know God's love he should know because
[1:37:12] he said so if the Word of God says he
[1:37:13] loves us he died for us before we can
[1:37:16] even love him and the second thing the
[1:37:19] second way we know he loved us is that
[1:37:21] he gave us his spirit placing us his
[1:37:24] sons with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:27] how should I prove my love back to if
[1:37:30] he's done all this for the atom invade
[1:37:32] the planets in the universe how hide why
[1:37:34] if he's done all this to show me how
[1:37:36] much he loves me and how much he'll be
[1:37:38] faithful to me how should I love him
[1:37:40] brother grant says this just believe
[1:37:43] what he said okay men and then conduct
[1:37:47] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:37:52] he in his depth of his wisdom now see
[1:37:55] the depth of his wisdom allow us to come
[1:37:58] to pass I think about the Hosea my God
[1:38:01] allow certain things different trials to
[1:38:03] go through but you know what for the
[1:38:05] hose ain't promised God allowed that to
[1:38:07] happen we lose it thank God was for the
[1:38:09] hose a God wants me in my trials to
[1:38:13] stand there and conduct myself with joy
[1:38:16] because I know God's love allowed this
[1:38:19] to happen this is gonna draw me closer
[1:38:23] to Christ a man as hard as it may be as
[1:38:26] awful as it may seem this hardship is
[1:38:29] gonna draw me closer to Christ
[1:38:32] huh we only say oh how can I love God
[1:38:34] more Lord I wanna do something for you
[1:38:36] you forget about this sometimes just be
[1:38:39] joyful in your trial just understand
[1:38:42] that God's love brought you to it like
[1:38:44] that sign says if he brought you to it
[1:38:46] I'll bring it through
[1:38:47] like our our dry cleaner always have
[1:38:51] different signs about God and that was
[1:38:53] one of the signs I said I love your side
[1:38:54] if Christ brings you to it they'll bring
[1:38:57] you through it so we have to overcome
[1:39:01] right we have said overcome how do you
[1:39:03] overcome by taking the word the promise
[1:39:06] in humility humbly walking with God
[1:39:11] accepting what has happened if God
[1:39:13] allowed this his love about this the
[1:39:15] depths of God's love allowed this trial
[1:39:19] to happen and I would trust him in the
[1:39:20] midst of the trial
[1:39:22] I'm gonna close with that by God's grace
[1:39:25] I had two songs on my heart anybody
[1:39:27] remember that song your love O Lord
[1:39:28] a third day saying everybody remember
[1:39:30] that sup okay and then the love of God
[1:39:34] reaches to the highest mountain the
[1:39:36] thing those songs before we close here
[1:39:37] now how many want to sing it to Jesus a
[1:39:39] lot of a thankful heart
[1:39:40] I mean a man if we're rooted if weren't
[1:39:43] really planning Christ we should with
[1:39:45] All Saints we should be able to kind of
[1:39:48] start comprehending how much God loves
[1:39:50] us the breath of it the length the
[1:39:54] height we should be able to understand
[1:39:57] how much he loves us I'm thankful are
[1:40:02] you thinking for the word of God tonight
[1:40:04] like I said make time I'll just preach
[1:40:06] on sin enough last every sin there could
[1:40:09] be you know that and that I know of but
[1:40:11] we need to stop sometimes remember how
[1:40:13] much God loves us and the Jesus said if
[1:40:16] I love you I'm going to renew pew right
[1:40:19] let me said let's remember that let's
[1:40:25] start with your love O Lord reaches to
[1:40:26] them okay I don't know if you have the
[1:40:28] lyrics okay I don't think you do if you
[1:40:31] know I have a moment I bet yeah your
[1:40:40] Lord if you don't you guys what you
[1:40:43] doing yeah reaches to the heavens you
[1:40:46] got that lease when I first became with
[1:40:49] the denominational Christian which I was
[1:40:51] very thankful

[1:40:55] that's wonderful oh yeah it's got a
[1:40:58] third name in there okay
[1:40:59] praise the Lord
[1:41:00] I first became a denominational
[1:41:02] Christian I know nothing about the
[1:41:03] message this was one of my first
[1:41:04] favorite song because it talks about the
[1:41:07] love of God what are we planted in
[1:41:11] church we planted an anger against the
[1:41:14] Roman Catholic Church I sent round
[1:41:16] playing it

[1:41:19] denomination that's somewhere I'm
[1:41:21] playing I'm playing in God's love and
[1:41:24] because they are nominations are awful
[1:41:27] and and there are some things wrong the
[1:41:29] love of God makes me constrains me to
[1:41:32] want to reach out to them that's what I
[1:41:35] must admit yes they're doing some awful
[1:41:38] things but if I were planted in love the
[1:41:41] love of God will constrain me to live a
[1:41:43] right life and love them back that's
[1:41:45] exactly right so you might not know the
[1:41:48] tunes I understand I might be seeing
[1:41:49] especially here but I just I was crying
