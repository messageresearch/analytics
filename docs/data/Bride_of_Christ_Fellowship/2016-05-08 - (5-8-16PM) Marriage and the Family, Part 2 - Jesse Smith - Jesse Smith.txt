praise God speak house of the Lord tonight let's take our Bibles to Colossians chapter 3 tonight by the grace of God well yesterday was I was studying I was trying to decide what the Lord would have me to preach I felt you know to go back to marriage and uh and then brother Stephen preached numerous things I already had in my notes I was very happy about that and I thought that was a confirmation by God's grace so i' like to preach on marriage in the family part two tonight I thoroughly enjoyed this morning uh but Stephen really followed the leading of the Lord I thought that was just such a wonderful thing and there's a whole great testimony behind it U but it was a real special time this morning I just we really really blessed I have to tell it to you sometime once everything everything else needs to happen happens and I will by God's grace just a wonderful testimony so um Colossians chapter 3 please let's look at um marriage and family of let's go to verse 18 here last Sunday morning we looked we focused mostly on the men we're going to keep doing that a little bit this morning and looking at the man's role in the marriage in the family because he's the head of the family and and uh de a little bit more of that and then we're going to get to parts of the book here we we offered this to every couple of the church last Sunday if you'd like to read this book it's the best book I've ever read on marriage the best one I've read quite a few probably seven or eight or nine maybe somewhere around there and it's the best book I've ever read on marriage and it transformed my marriage because it has Bible PR Bible principles in it and everything it said in here about specific things brother brandom said to do too so I like that amen I like that by God's grace um it's just a really really great book so Colossians 3:18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord verse 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged and that means disheartened you don't want to see children that are disheartened or spiritless so quite a responsibility we all have don't we as we look at our families wives have responsibilities husbands children and then he addresses men again as fathers he dresses them so let's have word of prayer if you have need on your heart just make it know to god let's bow our heads here and let's pray together one more time Heavenly Father we're grateful Lord again for this Fellowship we're grateful for all the saints Lord and most of all we're grateful for you giv us life natural and eternal life Lord to think this life with inside of us will never end dear God it goes beyond my comprehension but Lord by faith I believe it and I Know It Lord because Lord you manifested yourself in many ways through your word through nature through Supernatural miracles signs of Wonders experiences Lord You've Vindicated your yourself Lord to us so many times and we thank you for that speak to us here tonight Lord bless these Saints as we Fellowship around your word bless those that are live streaming as well Lord I pray you just change our hearts and lives to become more like you in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen God bless you being seated there praise God yeah so a great testimony this morning you know having brother Stephen here and just a what wonderful word of God that was and uh that was such a blessing so let's look at this morning here or this evening sorry about marriage and family part two I think it'll be really blessed by this message next Sunday just let you know we're going to dedicate little Victoria I know she's three months old but I just forgot to have her dedicated so U but it worked out good because Kristen's mother always likes to come when we're having the baby dedication so next Sunday morning my mother-in-law will be here and uh she don't believe the message yet but we're praying that she might and uh my plan you know my leading was to preach on marriage and family next week so I hope I hope that will touch her heart and you know one time brother Gabe Smith preached here when my mother-in-law was here and I wasn't here I think I was out of town ministering somewhere else my wife said that the Lord truly discerned for mother's heart and uh so obviously our mother my mother-in-law knows God speaks here you know uh because it totally discerned her life um but we're looking for fruits you know we're looking for uh real repentance and things like that we want that in all of our family lives don't you still pray for your your your unsafe family you ought to we ought to bring them before the Lord and uh like brother man said uh repeat the promise remind God of his promise you said thy and thy house should be saved I like what brother Stephen said this morning the violent take it by force if it looks like it's not going to happen then you just plead to God even more you know do something about it brother R said part of Christianity is going after them doing something about the Lost not just sitting back and doing nothing but at some point going out and uh trying to impact their lives I know when Simon heard the message and I had never heard the message Simon literally talked me over and over like you've got to sit down and listen to the sermon like he just basically begged me to do it like almost like forcing me as an older brother you know I was like oh sure s sure you know I just thought it was just another sermon when I heard that sermon my jaw about dropped I never heard any man preach like that uh and was brother Chris Hall I preached on serpent seed so I never forget that first message I heard of serpent seed that saw it immediately um don't understand didn't understand everything you know but certainly saw it right away so that's what I'm saying at some point you know we got to follow the leading of the Lord and know when to approach family members about certain things so that's just one example like I said you know last month uh I sent out 27 packets to everybody on my mother's side and my aunt you know uh thank me for my cousin thank me for it said he read it I I need to follow up with them and see if they did uh you of course Satan's probably trying to snatch that seed out of their hearts but uh my my aunt even commented what beautiful tracks they were beautiful you know things like that so they definitely looked at them and church just like brother BR said that man reach in his pocket and said where will you spend eternity he said that's where he receive salvation he he realized it because he started searching for it he was hungering for it yeah brother said when when when your heart turned and you got desperate and started seeking he said that's when it that's when it started to happen right there so and one of those tracks I I made sure I bought the one that said where will you spend eternity on it brother random said that one worked uh because brother R said that's all you're called to do pass the [Music] track times he condemns people for that's all they do is pass tracks right if you're supposed to do more on you but if he said have a purpose in life and go do something he said I like somebody that knows what they're doing yeah he said I like somebody that's about the father's business that has something to do for the kingdom of God do something make clothes for little babies or uh right write write letters to family members or you know do something do do something I don't know do something raise your like said teach your children or you know call and pray pray and fast for people do something for the kingdom of God and God will bless you for that how many believe that amen you know uh it's kind of easy for me as far as you know knowing what to do I'm supposed to preach I'm supposed to teach that's easy for me uh but if I wasn't preaching I'd have to seek God and find out okay that's what God helps us to understand so I just want to let you know next Sunday morning um I'll be preaching and uh Victoria be dedicated there and then I'll be preach in the evening service as well I told I said that brother John was going to preach but he let me know he's not able to preach next Sunday night so I'll be preaching uh probably rest of the services until we get to our June 10th anniversary meetings so looking forward to that I was working on a little slideshow I got all these pictures from like 2004 2002 or you know when we first heard the message and I put them on a slideshow we're so we're probably G to show that one of those days so have brother Samuel Browning coming brother cam brother Isaiah brother Craig Bo so you have those four brothers coming to Minister I just can't wait I'm just going to be spiritually fed there by God's grace looking forward to that by God's grace so looking forward to it amen so let's look at this here uh we took our text in Colossians 3 uh 18 through 21 and I wanted to take that because it talks I like what it said how it talked to the husbands and the fathers because of course not every husband is a father but most husbands a lot of husbands turn out to be fathers so I want to make sure I I uh emphasize that husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them now we know the Bible said the flesh is enmity against the spirit how many remember that from Galatians the flesh what your flesh wants to do is hatred or enmity against the holy spirit so the holy spirit says husbands love so husbands does your flesh always want to love of course not that's why the holy spirit's got to tell you to do that sisters and wives is it always easy to submit does your flesh always want to submit probably not right you don't have to say Amen it's one of those Family Services you don't have to say Amen because I know it's it's deep and it's personal I know that that's good but these are the things this church this really brings Christ into your home when you start preaching on family you really see What You're Made Of that's the real you right we can put on a show we could like a brother said this morning we can act you can put up a mail act like everything's okay but our home life brother said you live your best and your worst at home so we want to try to decrease the worst and increase the best is that right that's what we want to do um and I want the people I want to love me and respect me the most are the ones I'm living with I've got to constantly battle that for example I always want the church people to love me and but sometimes if I don't if I put all my focus on the church people and serving them and studying and praying or trying to email them or contact them whatever and I lose track of my family that my family doesn't get the love they need right and I've got to find the balance I got to be hospital but I've also got to love my children and love my wife because Paul said Jesse love your wife right so I've got to find the balance on how to do that and it takes the Holy Spirit but let me say like this brother Rand said if you confess your sin he said the person that you confess will think more of you than before how many remember that remember when he lied to the IRS he said the men thought more of him after he repented so if we're honest and sincere in our home right and we make mistakes and I make a mistake with my wife and if I go repent to her for that she'll think more of me afterwards so I guess just by sheer numbers and probability I'm probably gonna sit against my wife more than anybody else right by sheer probability yeah she she's goingon to see my weak spots but the more I go and repent to her the more I humble myself the more I obey the leadership of the Holy Spirit also the more shall think of me how many can say Amen to that just by your numbers like I apologize in my class you know once a month I I'll say something wrong or you say Okay children will you forgive me and they yeah of course Mr Smith we love you we forgive you you know and you know you know I don't really sin against them as far as I know I'm not convicted of it but I I make mistakes I'd apologize my wife on the drive here for you know just for him falling short you know uh but the more we humble ourselves and truly repent the more a Christian will think of you and even a sinner if they're really sincere they really are in touch with their conscience now so that I just want to make sure I state that there so God knew Brothers husbands husbands and fathers God knew it'd be a struggle for us to love our wives and sisters God knew it be a struggle for you to submit to your husbands but he had he put it in there because that's the that's what the Holy Ghost will lead you to do a brother to love and a sister to submit that's what the Holy Ghost is leading us to do how many want to be led into than that I do I'm the first one I'll stand up here I'm the first one I need to love my wife better I need to love my children better yeah I know it am do I do a pretty a good job well I'm probably doing a pretty good job because I'm a spirit called man Le Spirit L man but I know I can do better because I know when I get down into discouraged I know when I go through the dumps and I know when I make mistakes I know it I'm right there when it happens I let it happen because I'm not walk in the spirit but I'm the first one and say that I want to love my wife better I love my children better I want them to see Christ in me because when I'm loving them whose love is it like brother Stephen said this morning is it really my love or his it's his love so when I'm loving my wife and I'm loving my children it's really Christ loving them through me yeah and yes I feel the same right because I have the same Spirit God shares his spirit with me so I to make sure I say that it so Brothers you're going to be battled fathers and husbands you're going to be battled to love it's going to be a battle as you probably know that you've already experienced that but I'm just re rehearsing this God knew it it would be a battle and God and so that's why Paul specifically wrote to the men just love love love you must love and notice the the Bible gives other things that will be tempted to love for example be tempted to love of other women right will we tempted to love the things of the world John said love not the things of the world right he said be not lovers of your own s remember that don't be lovers of your own s don't love yourself don't love the another woman uh the world ourselves but we're to love God right we're to love God with all of our hearts and soul mind and strength so when we're truly loving God with all of our heart soul mind and strength then we'll truly love our family the right way and I found that to be true when I'm truly Ser serving God loving God with all my heart it's easy to love my wife it's easy to love my children when I'm in love with God because I see those are God's they're in God's image praise the lord it's exactly right so see we Brothers we got to love because we're tempted to love other women we're tempted to love the world we're tempted to love ourselves we're tempted to love anything else but we got to love God and love our wives because it's a Temptation it is it's a great temptation all all these are Temptations we must overcome them by the grace of the Lord and as my email said this week I just want to make sure I I read this I wrote this at the top to remind myself if any marriage needs counseling that's why I'm here I'd like to help out also if any uh marriage couple wants to get away and you help you need help financially with getting away I'll be happy to help you with that that's how I just want to support marriages I want marriages to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord I believe in that because I'll just share my testimony real quick ask my wife if I could share a little bit about about it on the way here okay my wife and I got married in 2003 uh and uh you know it wasn't long till Lydia came along I'm very thankful for Lydia coming on the scene like brother Bram said they come on the scene uh and then Mal guy came on the scene but when Mal guy was three months old my wife came to me and said you know this is really hard I don't want any more children and now we have six so something must have changed bu yeah a lot changed and know but the reason my wife said that was because I wasn't giv her the love that she needed and here's why I was pastoring well some people say Pastor in part-time any Pastor job is full-time yeah I don't care what anybody says well you know Pastor fulltime I'm pastoring full I preach three times a week I counsel I try to pray with people I try to call them I'm full-time Pastor I don't care what anybody says but I'm Heart part a full-time teacher too um so I'm full-time pastor and full-time teaching and then I was doing graduate work and so since we've been married I've been doing all those things I've done gra 36 graduate hours and then 30 more so I've done 66 graduate hours while having six kids and you know about have six all the whole time but you know anyways what I'm saying is there's a lot on my plate is what I felt like okay but at that time of our life we were so busy I was just so dedicated to the word and my thoughts weren't even thinking about really loving my wife now that I I was faithful to her I loved her of course but I didn't really spend any time meeting her needs her emotional needs and that's important brother said it like I read the quotes last Sunday brother Ram said all these things that are in this book that that are worth preaching he said all it so at that point I think we went somewhere and somebody gave us a book about marriage I don't remember who it was you remember okay oh that's right okay yeah so he asked if we're having date nights so another uh preacher he's he's a preacher in Wadsworth uh they're kind of like a presbyterian uh but they're really sweet people really sweet people and that kind of and for some he gave me a book or something and we started talking and then we found this book His Needs Her Needs uh and that is and then we read this book and this book has been transformational because this this author uh basically says uh whatever you did to get the person to fall in love with you you need to keep doing that uh uh because whatever you were doing to convince them to marry you was what they needed and they just don't need that at the beginning they need that all the way through okay and so that was like mind changing to me I like wow and it just it really revolutionized my thought uh and so that's where we'll get to but that was just a short really short testimony of that ever since then we started doing date nights together like we had a date yesterday that was really great just two hours we just go away for two hours with the baby and talk and it was just really great it just kind of refreshes our batteries helping us to reconnect emotionally and everything like that it's a really wonderful because that's what we used to be do before we got married we used to go on dates right so that's what we do we just enjoy being together and talking and and a lot sometimes it's talking about the future sometimes talking about children sometimes talking about things in the church am I doing this right honey you think I'm preaching okay you know some of my concerns my own battles you know we talk and but that's great for a couple to do that that's wonderful thing to do and that was missing because she needed that that's one of her needs that's one of the five needs for the women and the men have five needs the author got those needs from a thousand counseling sessions and talking with Christ these are Christian couples Christian couples that were having marriage trouble and based upon a thousand uh counseling sessions he found wow there's a common denominator these these five needs are needs of women and these are five needs of men now they might have different priority levels like this man might need this more than he needs that a woman might need this more than that but he found that they most women need these things and most men need these things okay so that's why I said the email I'll support any marriage getaway I'll support uh any counseling I'd be happy to do that because one thing I want to say too how many knew that brother brandom said that Satan taxed the the woman more than the man do anyone know that brother ra said it because he did that at the beginning who' he go after in the Garden of Eden Eve brother R said we must pray for our wives pray for our sisters because he still goes he goes he goes harder after them and I have the quote on here we'll try to get to it eventually because it goes after the weaker one now she's weaker physically but like I said last Sunday she don't have to be weaker spiritually right because both can be saved right now women don't have preaching gifts or whatever more uh at least they shouldn't try to impersonate it like people do so forth like that but they can still be strong in the Lord the full armor of God wasn't just to men it was for men and women right yes the stat for of men just wasn't for men it was for women too those are all qualities all virtues Christians are supposed to have men and I want to read you this brother brandom said I'm sure you know this but brother Bram said read the word some of you don't read the word once a week I'll let you think about that you ought to read chapter after chapter every day meditate if you get your head out of them old magazines and things you're reading now most of us don't read magazines we read our cell phones or desktop computers see if you get your head out of those old I'll say websites and out of this old so many papers and so-called religious literature he said Doctrine is based upon God's word not experience people can have experiences on everything so he just kind of goes off on a different thought I want you to read that he said you should read chapter after chapter you should be reading the word of God now life story 1952 he's start by Abraham Lincoln you probably heard this as well and the only books that we believe that Lincoln ever had until he was 21 years old was the Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs that's what molded that character the books the books he read molded his character now today it's a shame the videos they watch and the apps they play mold their character but it should be the books they read and they should be Godly books praise God now let's apply that we should we read message books yes should we read the Bible that should be our number one reading but on the side like this week I got through seven chapters of this that's the most I've read in a long time outside of the reading the Bible and the message I was like wow I could actually do that you know because I just get distracted and things like that but what I'm saying church if this book has Godly principles then this book will mold my character because brother said whatever you read molds your character now there's a few things in here where he talks you if some of you read it he talks about how women uh will go on a date and wear makeup and you know get their haircut now we know that's just a that's just a a pit that's just a seed just throw the seed out okay right uh we know that and that's not why bu that people read it because it's a very good book uh I'd say 90% of it's outstanding and I never seen a better book on it and like I said it change my marriage so um whatever you read will mold your character so that's why I I I think the brothers need to read some of this too I know I know the brothers work hard and things like that so I said on the email if you don't have a lot of time Read that read those little pages I sent them back it's only like 10 pages and if the Lord's willing next Sunday or next Sunday night and we have more couples here I'm not really ready to to preach it I'll print off some of those and we'll walk through it and you can walk through with your spouse like a marriage conference it'll be our own little akan marriage conference we'll have U because I just don't know who has time to read it on their own and church it's extremely valuable because it's it's learning to love someone with the love of Christ it's it's extremely valuable I I don't even know if I can overemphasize that loving the one that's what I'm get to you later loving the one you vowed to love keeping your vow that you gave God praise the Lord yeah you vowed to God husbands and wives you vowed to God in front of all your friends and family that you would love them until death do you part so I'm trying to help you keep your vow because I want to keep mine ever understand it's exactly needed it's extremely needed it'll bring more Christ into your home who doesn't want that well ra said if you want angels to visit your house better live like an angel you better live holy right so this is helping this will help I believe angels to visit your home amen I believe that okay so let's um go back here I'm sorry in my notes it looks back okay so these sermons here as we had one last week one this week the whole purpose is love because love is the greatest force in the whole universe love is the greatest Force um so these sermons are going to teach us how to love based upon the needs of men women and these needs will help us keep our promises we made on our wedding days you and I promise in front of our family and to almighty God that we would we would love we bought we all of us said that and a man is no better than his word I want to make sure I say that yeah a man or woman is no better than their word look look what brother B said 1951 expectations he tells him this is Los Angeles he said if I say I'll meet you there he's talking about special meetings if it all possible I'll do it because a man of his word will be honest and keep his promise let alone a Christian so just a man who's a real man will be honest and keep their promise and that's not even a Christian that's just a man praise God he said I'll be there if I all possibly can because a man keeps his word 1956 hear you him so no man is any better than his word I'm no better than my word brother Bram says you're no better than your word God's no better than his word and his word is part of him amen yeah I hope that helps you by God's grace we're no better than our our word if we keep our word or not do we if we do that we're on the right track all right let me read one more but God's word is ever the truth I always hold on to that and that God's word is always eternally true and no man's word or no man is any better than his word if I don't keep my word then I'm not much I'm not much if I don't keep my word right so God help me first and then God help all of us we say we're gonna do something God help us to do it amen I've been trying to use a lot more Lord willings lately if I can I've also been trying to say remind me if I forget because in the moment I want to do something but if I don't write it down if I don't get it in my inbox it's going to take God to bring it back to me I'll just forget I go from one box I go to the church box on Sunday and then work box Monday to Friday and then I jump back in the well Wednesday night jump back in the church box then Saturday it's all Church box Sunday out Church box and So within that those days where I'm in different boxes sometimes I forget so I really want to be though a man of my word because if I can't keep my word I'm not a man amen right I'm not a godly man I got to keep my word word because God keeps his word amen yes Glory he's the greatest man amen ever was amen yes so these sermons are focused on Love Now I want to drop this little thought in here let's go to proverbs 30 ver 18 this is beautiful proverbs 30:18 and like I said I have quotes for all these and I preach what I think five marriage Banquets on it so I have those slideshows I just I haven't had time to go through all them like I lik I went through two of them I think one of them or two of them and pulled out some good quotes and things like that to rehearse and refresh and I found some new ones too but everything that I preach everything that I'm preaching can be found in the message and it's it might not be specifically say in the Bible like the Bible don't say take out your wife on a date but the Bible says love right and the Bible said dwell with her according to understanding which is a deep understanding of a woman's needs in the Greek so what does a woman need well we try to love her like that you know uh that's what we should do so Proverbs 30:8 I love this there be three things which are too wonderful for me yay for which I know not the way of an eagle in the air yes that's us when we're flying under the anointing the way of a serpent on a rock I'm not sure about how to type that one the way of a ship in the midst of the Sea and the way of a man with the maid you said this is too wonderful to me how can even explain this when a man's in love this is so be this is Holy Scripture right yeah is this the Bible or not this the Bible this the Bible holy script he picks up by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit say these are all beautiful things an eagle soaring a ship sailing so smoothly and then also a man who loves a maid I love to watch in other words it said I love to watch a man who's in love and the lanks he'll go to win that woman's heart feel like Romeo and Juliet or something like that I never even read the book but it's so famous because everybody knows he's a he's Romeo he's a romantic he he was deeply in love and the Bible said this is is too wonderful to even see when a man's in love with a woman and so the write songs on it for the last you know how many thousands of years have people make quite a living singing about love whether it's defeated love or Miss love or actually getting love and that's all lustful love they can make millions and billions of dollars thinking about love what does brother Ram say everybody wants in the whole world what do they want love what's the greatest love there is the love of God that's all perverted love but the love of God ought to be the greatest uh the greatest drawing card of anything amen glory so the writer of the proverb here says it's it's just too wonderful to see a man what is he trying to he's trying to win her heart he's trying to fight for her heart he fights so much he'll forget about his mom that's what I did I stopped hanging out with my mom I met that lady back there Mrs Smith She's mine I didn't hang out with my friends much anymore and didn't hang out with my Bros you know anymore because I had one Focus that was to win her heart that's true and that could be a wonderful thing the Bible said it's a wonderful thing and so this is the type though of Christ and the church right Ephesians 5 tells us that we all know that we it's all read at almost every wedding at least if it's a Christian wedding so Christ a wonderful thing it must be see to see how Christ would love his wife isn't it beautiful How He Loves Us Church we're unworthy but he still Woos us he's like like brother said this morning I was going to preach on that too about about God coming to Adam and say where are you Adam don't hide from me I'm your Lord I love you if you made a mistake just come to me don't run from me come to me Hallelujah this is a type of Christ and the church and I thought this draws a a good picture here let's go toh Proverbs 5 18 since we're in Proverbs this is a this is a great scripture too remember there's all types Christ in the church remember I read you that quote last Sunday where the man said brother brandom she wants me to walk in here we got kids and she wants me to walk in here and act like we just got married and this we can't do this and brother BR said whoop boy look up whoop boy whoop w h o p whoop boy look up W boy he said you need to treat her like that he said she needs that she's 40 years old she needs your attention now more than ever brother Brandon said so not less as you get older more as you get older I know it's hard with kids I gotta I gotta but we got we gotta find the balce church you gotta find the balance gotta find the balance Satan wants us to have no time to love in the home and if he destroys the home he destroyed a lot you got to have the home the home's got to be solid the home's got to be your sanctuary as I was thinking throughout the week I was thinking a lot about this message uh and about marriage and family the home should be like a sanctuary it's like a father goes out in the morning and some mornings I feel like I'm going out and lay to see a like I'm gonna fight you know I'm sneaking out say honey pray for me I'm going back out in L to see it here and there's a huge Battlefield out here I love you pray for me we try to make it home alive because it's such a war right and some some days some days I come like this I feel like I oh I slam the door and I fall against the good door like oh mercy I made it home because I've been fighting and battling all day anybody ever feel like that yeah absolutely I do Satan trying to steal my virtue Satan trying to T me Satan trying to make me struggle and make me doubt all these things I finally get a home and this home should be My Sanctuary it should be where love abides I should be able to come in hug my wife kiss my wife hug the kids sit down read them a book my little ones like to read me or like when I read books to them so I normally read a lot of books and try not to fall asleep while reading those books because I've read some of them many many times but the point is we should get we should come home in and be able to experience love if we don't feel it there at work we should have it at the home and we know our wives are doing their best to keep it there but we've got to lay the foundation we've got to prepare and we've got to set we got to set the the standard in the home the men leads the home now Proverbs 5:15 this speaking of a man and a wife here and uh It Go goes a little bit into adultery but let's look at this here uh 5:15 drink Waters out of thine own syst and running Waters out of thine own well notice thine own your own sistern your own well let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee so you should have fountains and Wells of water all over your property and they're only yours praise God just yours Verse 18 look at Verse 18 let thy Fountain be bless and rejoice with the wife of thy youth let her be as the loving Hind and pleasant robe let her breath satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravish that means intoxicated always with her love and why wilt thou th son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger why would you do that when you got water of your own you got Wells of your own why would you go drink from another well when you got your own Wells see that verse 21 for the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord and He Ponder all his goings his own iniquity shall take the wicked himself and he shall be Holden with the cords of his sins look at that see the cords see the chain see the slavery to sin see that he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray so adultery is like a Gateway uh for falling away from God can you say Amen to that because it's a natural and a spiritual thing too there's natural adultery and spiritual adultery but here the Proverbs writer says natural adultery is a gateway or chain here to finally leave away from instruction why because they're they're drunken with the wrong kind of love they're drunken with the love of lust instead of the love of Holiness and Purity hope everybody can see that there by God's grace he's supposed to be uh keeping his vows loving the wife loving the the well that God gave him you already got a well you already got water and the Bible said let uh like that let the fountains be dispersed abroad so everywhere you should have a you should have the feeling for your wife everywhere you should have this love for your wife and family it should be all over your land it should be all over your life you should always love your family shouldn't just be in location your land should be covered and your fountains and Waters your love for your wife and family and children should just flow all over your land amen I should love my wife not just in the bedroom Brothers right we should love our wives in the kitchen we should love our wives when we're out in the garage working and say nice things about her we should love our wives everywhere how about that we should love our children go play with them out in the yard we should love them all around wherever we are the love of God should flow through us to our wives and our children the church said amen all right Glory I don't do that too often but I like to do that sometimes it's kind of nice to do that so the holy spirit said there's a wonderful thing about a man who's just desperately in love trying to win a wife and then the holy spirit said be intoxicated with your wife's love only other words make her the definition of beauty can I say like that some brothers in the uh I don't even I'll side this some brothers in the past have asked me about certain things about marriage and things like that and uh I don't even know if they're from this church I can't remember anymore and that's really I can't remember I don't know it's been so long ago but they were just saying things about uh what if you're not attracted to your wife in certain ways and things like that I said you know I said you've got to you got to make your wife the definition of beauty let me say like this you got to starve your eyes from looking at anything else and just look at your wife only that way if you starve your your eyes that way and don't look at any anyone else and don't think about that and if you cut off any evil thoughts about that then your wife will become the most beautiful thing to you because see the the world tries to inject you know well woman's got to be this figure and that and that and that and all that nonsense like that and that's all perversion and that's just All Flesh right and that will rot like brother said when Marilyn died how many men want her body now done yeah because it proves us not about the flesh it's a lustful Spirit behind it yeah that right Church go dig that body who wants it now nobody because the spirit's gone it was a lustful Spirit to begin with yeah are you with me so see the Christian Man learns that he loves the soul of his wife praise God and as he loves learns to love her soul and know that she's a daughter of God right she ain't a piece of meat she's not lower than a man as far as rulership yes she's under the man but as far as salvation she's just as much a a child of God as any man is amen that right that's true and he learns to love her for who she is and who God made her to be and love her because she's God's daughter amen not just his wife but God's daughter amen it's exactly right but see adultery that's why that's why I like the title this book it's uh his knes her KN needes building in a fair proof marriage and it's true uh if you learn to love and fall in love with one person and be loyal to love them only and make your definition of beauty and make and make them uh the one you're intoxicated with the one you're always thinking about that it makes you forget you you starve any anything else you starve any Temptations of the Flesh and if you starve that then it's easy to do let me say like that it is that's exactly true amen so water you know that's why I wrote down my notes water is water so men are you know men are often tempted to have you know other lovers and things like that all brother man said all men are like that he said when a man sees a woman half naked he said something passes over his whole body he said I've been saved for years he said and when he sees something like that that's why I put the cross in this car a man brother said a man is made to reproduce science tells us that and when he sees uh something of that nature he says something passes over him and he's got to turn it down by the power of God I don't know if sisters feel that or not I don't know but Brothers sure do right now one I learned good in this book every year you lose a little testosterone so it makes a little bit easier H this as the years go by I thought amen glory U but that doesn't mean the sin the Temptation won't come because I remember before my Grandpa died he was still battling some of those things and it was a shame to his testimony not a blessing it was a shame he was seeing little nurses in the hospital and saying things he should not have said of course his wife would die but still that's still wrong so see that that's the I'm talking about it's a spirit it's a spirit of lust it's not really the physical body necessarily because water is water Bible said your wife's like a fountain well any other woman's like a fountain but it's the fountain that God gave you amen what what which one did God give you that's the one that's best for you amen hallelujah that's one you must stick with but if not if you get looking at other people's fountains the Bible said here you're close to having no instruction and then the Bible says later the adulterer her the woman herself whatever more her gates are the gates hell that true her gates are the gates to hell that's what we're trying to keep everybody out of spiritual adultery and natural adultery brother but because Jesus said if you think it right here you're already guil you already committed it see the importance of quick prayer Lord forgive me that thought God I don't want to think that Lord Jesus purify my heart and mind yeah the power of just constant repentance wherever whever God battles or whever we have a battle God will help us to overcome we got to be willing to pray like I said this morning pray confess come clean before God are you enjoying the message so far okay praise God Amen so what what we see from this is that it's so beautiful to see a man in love because he's enjoying the chase how many men men like to race right men like to chase men like to fight men like to uh they they like to be they like to be better than somebody I love sports because I like to be better than other people you I play video games I could beat the records and that's a man is built to want to conquer he's built to fight we listen to this one good uh audio series uh Lamplighter Theater and my favorite one is Sir Knight of the splendid way he talks about this Knight and is it's like an allegory of a Christian Life he's a knight and he has to fight all these and he's always fighting himself he has to fight the black knight which is himself and I thought that's good brother BR said my greatest enemy is brother Brandon and anyways at the beginning of it there's this little uh little scene and uh the owner of the shop talks about how why do so many boys get involved in video games why it's mostly boys why and they're mostly fighting games and why do they do that because men and boys are programmed to want to conquer and fight and overcome and that's how I was I always wanted to play the games and fight and win and all these things like that and but video games is a is a fantasy so is an affair Affairs fantasy yeah it's not a real relationship it's fantasy that's right but so his video games he just made a point how that's why these video games attract boys and if they play I think four hours a day for their life they'll waste 16 years of their lives playing video games it's probably more than that can you imagine if you live 70 years 16 of that was dedicated just to staring at a game and there's no value this game doesn't help anybody no one's help it's all selfish it's all escaping reality like I said before I don't want the American dream I want the Christian reality amen hallelujah amen I want a reality of this book of Acts I want a reality of Jesus Christ Living in my life amen and the spirit of Christ flowing out of me with love for God and love for my family love for the people of God and making a difference in the world even if it's just one life we want to make a difference amen so see Fighters men are Fighters men always went out to war in the Bible you never see men and women go out every now and then a woman will get a victory remember the woman who the stone and throw it down in the head the Jews are yeah Glory you know every now and then you had a girl a woman that would play a good part in that you had a few women that helped rebuild the wall in neiah time I remember preaching on that they just helped their fathers and took their place and laying the bricks and just m right there thank God for that but most of the time it's men that were Fighters and so brothers that's what we're supposed to fight for we're supposed to fight for the Holy Ghost love to flow through us and that we love our wives and love our children that origin chase that we had were chasing our wives and I talked to one of my cousins it was it was s funny but sad uh he he's been gting a lot of weight you know after marriage and I said you know you why you ever think about working out because he said oh you're looking real nice and trim Jesse and I said well I like to work out a little bit you know we do a little exercise he's like yeah once I got married I gave up because I I caught my wife he said I'm just letting myself go like he's laughing and making a joke about it like just being totally honest I laugh but it was like a sad laugh like oh man you know but that's how a lot of men look at like it's just like a like love is just a short it's like a shortterm part of their life but the real Christian is supposed to keep that going like brother said you always have a honeymoon praise God you to keep that going so see it's the the men need to realize and I like I said I'm growing in this too we want to all grow in this what we must fight for love in our families real Christian love and uh we we got a we got a good enemy and it's not some video game Enemy it's the devil praise God we got a strong enemy brother R said you're no match for him unless the Holy Ghost is in your life praise God you're no match for the devil unless the Holy Ghost is blown through your life amen thank God for that so think of Jesus the Bible said the joy that was set before him what was the joy the love of his lady right he's going to win the hearts of his children amen he's going to purchase their salvation and so he goes to Calvary with that in mind and we know gets cut and blooded and bruised and beaten so he don't look like a man he did that for the love of his of his wife his beloved wife that's right the future love his wife because brother Ram said the mar the wedding is still future brother Ramson he said we got an engagement ring right now but the wedding will be at the marage supper the lamb amen he's still looking forward to that hallelujah amen even though his Jewish people rejected him he said I'll do it to redeem some of those but I'll do it for the Gentile bride as well amen all right let's look at this here now I want to read this too Malachi 2:14 to 16 let's read that Malachi 214- 16 I love that little uh ever since I've seen this little sign that gets hung in my house I have just loved it I forget whose house I first saw it at maybe brother Brooks's I don't remember whose house when I first came in the message but it says something along this lines like Christ is the the the silent guest at every meal and he's a silent listener at every conversation I I just first time I saw that I thought Mercy I love that that I'm so humbled like I just wanna I want to live my life like he's there every every single moment and uh and think about that as we read this because that's true that is very true Christ is in every conversation he's either grieved by the conversation or he's blessed by it he's either grieved how we treat one another or he's blessed by it and we don't want to grieve him we want to bless him okay Malachi 2:14 yet ye say wherefore because the Lord have been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast dealt treacherously so these you know Malachi speaking to uh the men of Israel this is around the time of Nehemiah this is about 397 BC so right after the wall was built okay so they had not been treating their wives well whole generation of Jewish men not treating their lives or wives well rather okay yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant so even though she's your your companion Covenant she's with you all the time you're dealing Tre ously you're not treating her fairly sounds like God wants his daughters to be treated the right treated the right way how many say Amen to that because God Is Watching God is a witness and did he not did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit see why do men mistreat their wives they got a wrong Spirit on them right take heed to your not Soul not flesh take heed to your spirit the mind is Anointed The motiv the attitude whatever more it's Anointed with the wrong Spirit that's right and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth well sometimes you can deal treacherously with your wi is that what God Said No never let none of them do that right Brothers right I only have a few Brothers here tonight so sorry Brothers You're the only ones I can look at you know I can't look at anybody else I could pretend there's Brothers you know I guess I can just look you know think about looking at myself in the mirror I know I gotta do a better job but this is a reality don't let anybody treacherously treat your wife always treat her fairly always treat with Godly love because God is watching you that's the word of the Lord so we must deal with our wives justly she must be treated Fair she's your companion uh part of the Covenant with you and God is watching let's read verse 162 for the Lord the god of Israel sayith that he hateth putting away God hates divorc listen people can be divorced and not be divorced you know what I'm saying they can be of two different spirits and not one spirit and yet living in the same house right Church coming to the same church yes so God help us for one cover violence With His Garment sayith the Lord of of host therefore take heed well look covering they just covering like this morning hiding things therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously how do you take heed to your spirit you think about am I thinking the right things are these the right thoughts I need to examine myself am I saying the right thing am I doing the right thing do I have the right attitude take heed to your spirit take heed to your thinking take heed to your words because they have a great impact upon the wives absolutely so God is watching us Brothers how we treat our wives and don't and uh and don't think the other people they didn't come tonight so they don't get to hear this preaching I'm gonna preach this again by God's grace told my wife I said The more services we can have about marriage and family the better how many would say amen amen I I would say Amen sure because if sometimes like I told you if I forget about it I don't treat my wife like I have to I don't treat her as good as she deserves I don't treat my children as much as well as they deserve to be treated I'm just going to be honest and say that but I am growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord and I do try to repent to them when I make a mistake try to face them and say you know what that's my fault forgive me I didn't mean to do that and they'll think more of us if we do that all right I've had people even tell me I've done that at school and I've had you know you know um teachers AIDS in the classroom and you know even get substitute teachers and they see me repent to my class and then they say they notice that they said why did you repent that's that's nice that you do that you don't make yourself above and like you're the absolute or anything like that are you the one who has all the knowledge and I say well I'm doing it to model forgiveness I'm doing it to model repentance and in my class that's what it is we always have squabbles if anyone's ever been in school lately there's always squabbles this is the time of year really heats up too well Jimmy cut me in line and I was here first this is my spot all these kind of things and so I say you know what somebody's got to apologize and if you don't apologize you're both going down the line so in my class you hear you hear me say often some you need to say you're sorry say you're sorry what do you say I always make them repent and say they're sorry sorry for what what do you mean what sorry for talking during the end of the day Mr Smith I'm sorry for talking I'm sorry for uh you know accidentally knocking her over knocking her chair over I need to I'm trying to teach them how to repent yeah because listen I wasn't raised to know how to repent no one taught me we would just laugh at sin and we we there's no there's no repercussion really to it now when I I got older my mom started putting soap down my mouth for saying bad words she would like take take that liquid dish soap and she would wrestle me down that was before I got stronger you know but she wrestled me down and she was sticking in my mouth and you know but there's really no like I'm sorry I'm truly sorry so we're trying to form that into them so they learn how to apologize because some people are just like I was I was never taught to apologize my my wife had to help me learn how to apologize does that sound funny or what she had to help me learn how to apologize because I never knew how I would say I'm sorry but because of this and this and this and that's not a real apology that's making excuses yeah the real apology is I'm sorry it's my fault end of story I'll do better next time and the church say it's not making an excuse why you did it it's just saying you're sorry you're wrong and God helped me out to do it again how come when when we read Psalms 51 and David's apologizing or repenting about bash Sheba how come he never says Lord I'm sorry but it's all her fault because she was dressing in modestly and she was bathing herself that's called pushing the buck that's called passing the buck on somebody right like I had one of my uh instructors lately he said why he said I'm so upset today because of my children my children made me upset I think no you don't have to that's your choice to be upset we are supposed to have power to overcome those things that's what Satan wants to make us think that we have a right to be out with the wrong spirit because someone did it to us well no we're supposed to actually cast down that wrong spirit and we're supposed to keep the right spirit amen and as soon as he said that I thought nope that's wrong you no one can make you be that way you have to choose you have to submit to that Spirit that's exactly right and look what God Said God said I'm watching you husbands all our husbands here God's watching how do we treat our wives and we'll answer for it I want to be able to answer and say Lord I did mistreat your daughter a few times I asked her to forgive me I repented of it and you helped me you know to to get better I believe your promises you help me to be a better husband as I got older because I read more books about the Bible uh about how to love my wife and I I prayed more I heard more sermons about how to be a better husband that's what I don't tell the Lord amen that's what I want to tell the Lord I devoted myself myself I focused myself to how to be a better father and a better husband I applied myself to that okay how am I doing on time okay all right it's almost 5:30 okay I started at what probably 4:30 all right we'll try to go a little bit further here you know men loves check men love checklist don't they I do I have about five different apps that are like to-do apps like checklist checklist apps I just love checklists or something about it like it feels so good you check it oh it's done thank you Lord you know I just I love that but God's checklist is pretty small he said love your wives as you love yourselves right and then don't revoke your children to be spiritless or heartless right so God gives us a really short checklist love love love we've got to love and love means no love means the focus is off me and it's on the other people okay okay that's what love means so I wrote here men the checklist is pretty short love her like you love yourself the most men if you're like me you just give yourself whatever you need like if I need a new pair of pants I don't even ask my wife I just go out to co and bu this I hate going shopping I just would rather just order from home but I probably buy the wrong size I just whatever I need I just go get it as soon as I need it um and I try to get the best thing I want to make it last I get a nice one right try to get something nice well if that's how we treat ourselves Brothers then we should treat our wives very similar to that right we should try to do something nice however I would treat myself that's how I want to treat my wife I think my wife if I think I would want something nice I think my wife would want something nice too right that's absolutely right so we got to do that we gota actually apply that because that's what that's what Paul said Jesus said we gotta love our wives as we love ourselves all right now let me just get back to this real quick about books molding your okay now I think I read that oh yeah I was just going to say this too you know people a lot of men say don't like to read books but they'll sit there and read their phone for an hour you like to read it just got everybody likes to read it just kind of depends what you're reading yeah are you interested in what you're reading Church sit there read their phones and read their emails and texts and and go to this article that article about the politics going on and Sport world and all these things like that and they say they don't like to read you do like to read so see the the reality is we got to be able to sacrifice anything we like or anything we try to you know let off the pressure any hobbies we have and we got to devote that to the will of God we've got to do that if we're going to love our wives and love our children absolutely so I want to make sure I read that brother BR said the books you read whatever you read on your phone whatever you read you're reading somewhere whatever you read will mold your character that's why I stay stay away from a lot of the news sites when I read the news search I just scroll down for a little bit I just read the headlines usually I rarely ever read any of the Articles because really a lot of that I found doesn't even it doesn't even edify me like sometimes I read an article if I want to see you know how many delegates did this person have and you know I was just reading a little bit of that or there's a certain article I want to learn about this or that but a lot of that I just kind of go through the headlines because it always isn't always edifying or beneficial so make sure we what we're reading is the right thing all right I want to let's see got that got that got it okay let me read this quote to you I want to apply this to the man now brother Ram applies this to the Holy Spirit brother Ram tells about the Ducks he said every fall he said that main duck will will call all the other Ducks right and then they'll go down south he said that's God's provided way now listen he said now you think you about you you think about finding them a better way or could you find them a better leader than God's provided leader for them now maybe you could take a old Gander out here somewhere and take him out and feed him on certain vitamins and so forth and give him a special call you know s him out there with put a little Honker on his mouth that might give him a special Melody he could almost yodel with that and you might write it up in the papers and say a duck that can yodel and oh all the Ducks is bound to find him he'll know which way to take them because he's really cultured and educated and he's fixed up he can do it he said he might sit out there in Yoda all afternoon there would never be a duck come around him he said because my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow amen so could you ever find a better leader than the lead than the lead duck no no matter how much you try to make somebody else impersonate it you'll never find a better leader can you ever find a better leader for the church than the Holy Ghost never find a better one amen I'll never be a leader no man will ever be a leader the main leader is the Holy Ghost amen but what I'm saying is I'm applying that to the home Brothers if we're husbands and and fathers then if God give us this family then there's no better leader for that family than us praise God if we are God's chosen leader for that family there's no better one to lead we just have to make sure we lead with love amen there's no better leader for my family than Jesse Smith Loris Ro for Loris Ro's family Andy rer for Andy Raber's family brother Johnny for Johnny's family but now everybody knows who's here so I don't even know like last week we had one person live streaming in the evening service so it's usually not too bad but I'm just joking but you understand there's no better leader we just have to make sure we're Anointed with the right Spirit Glory right spirit because God's looking at our spirit what kind of spirit is on us are we dealing treacherously with our wives and children or are we dealing justly with them God will make us answer for how we do it that's right and now listen Brothers I want to read this to you let's go to Matthew 1:24 let's read this in our Bibles Matthew 1:24 I want you to see what a good leader Joseph was uh the husband of uh the Virgin Mary I just say that Virgin Mary not because I'm or anything just because it differentiates her from all the other mares that's why I'm saying that um Matthew 1:24 I want you to see what kind of a leader he was I think I think if all the brothers are honest we'll say God help us to be more like him yeah now you know the story Joseph was gonna put Mary away for uh fornication he's gon to do it privately not publicly because he was a just man he's a Godly Man fair man and then what happened he had a dream and the angel Gabriel come and tell tells him that this conceed of hers of the Holy Ghost look at verse 24 as soon as he wakes up then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel Lord had bid him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus I love that as soon as he got the word of the Lord on how to lead his wife right he's going to put her away but as soon as he got the word Lord he acted upon it that's a real man and that's church that's what our men need to be we need to hear the word of God and put it into action in our homes and in our lives absolutely that's why I'm here to help you if I can help in any way if I can help any family I want to do it as I said our church isn't one that has ask for a lot of counseling some Churches have a lot of that some Churches don't have much our church hardly has any counseling so if anyone would like any counseling I'm pretty available actually pretty available Saturday's a good day Sunday's a good day I can meet between Services before service after service I have plenty time for counseling or I come over over come over to my house or whatever more any uh help I can give would be a blessing and some people say well brother Jess you hardly have any gray hairs how could you help anybody well they could have said the same thing to Paul Paul how can you help anybody with marriage you're not even married yeah God was showing them it's not about the experience it's about the gift of God in their life yes so me I can help you that if you have confidence there's a gift in my life anyway to begin with if if you don't have any confidence I can't help you okay as as a pastor but that's what we got to look Pastor you go you know remember go remember Paul told that Timothy that young Pastor he said don't let anybody despise that you're young you be the example and I try to be the example of this church I try to get my heart and soul to God and everything this church is about I try to do right there right right there with you praise praise the Lord yes sir I spent hours and hours I'm not bragging I spent hours and hours here painting I spent three hours last night working on this stage I do whatever I got to do because I know God called me to do this so this is for His glory so if this looks awful you forgive me I'm not a handyman but whatever what I'm saying is that I want to do what God's called me to do and I want to do it with all my heart I want when I see the word of God I want to put it into action in my in my family that's what look that's what Joseph did he heard the word immediately he rose up and he took Mary his wife life look at the next chapter chapter 2 verse 14 now he has another dream where the angel tells him go to Egypt but does he wait upon a little while the Lord and say well Lord I'll see if I have two or three Witnesses on that he do he doesn't wait for two or three Witnesses he knows when it's God and he knows when it's right he acts on it that's a real leader look what he does next and when when he arose he took the young child and his mother by what morning by night and departed into Egypt he didn't even wait to get more sleep church this is how much he respected God's word and then if we could get this Brothers we can get this God will help transform our homes even more hear the word and act upon it like I said last week if you don't have a Bible time with your family Brothers you make a Bible time either in the morning or the night make you you need to teach your children the word of God just read it them just let them hear the word of God you've got to do that you're the priest of the home brother brand said we got to you have to make time for that it's not easy I could be doing study or things like that but I realize I'm the one who's supposed to teach that so I gotta gather around I gotta rally all six around and get my uh my Smith gang rallied around you know and reading the word of God if I don't do it no one else is gonna do it it's my job like I told you when I was growing up that's what my mom would do she was uh you know my Mom and Dad divorced when I was I think in seventh grade but every night church God knows my mom would make all of us five boys and one girl all gathered in her room and we'd have to pray all all out loud every night every night and sometimes it was silly sometimes we'd be fussing and fighting would she make us stay there and pray every night and she joined our hands before we went up to high school before we went to school she'd make us stand in the circle and bow our heads and pray before went to school every single day my mom you know she cuts her hair this short paints her face all these things like that but she knows that God honors prayer yeah she don't know a whole lot about the Deep things but she knows God honors prayer and that's why I say I feel like I'm a I'm a fruit to all her prayers I trust I hope I am by God's grace and my pray prayers of my grandparents but look this is this that's what the brothers have to do the brothers have to teach their children and love their children and really make this home a real Sanctuary to God I'm going a little bit longer maybe uh let me set my Tim here about let's go about 10 more minutes and we'll try to find a place close about 10 more minutes by the grace of the Lord I know these are real personal things but they're real great things too we surely need them I know I need them I know I was reading this book this week I read two chapters on Monday and read one more chapter each of the rest of the days I felt so I was like wow I forgot a lot of these things I can do a lot of more things for my wife so I was thinking about her throughout the day I bought her some flowers you know just I try to when I come home I try to hug her more and scratch her back and I rubbed her feet last night you know just trying to be a good husband you know uh trying to show her that I love her so that's what I'm saying like when we when we talk about marriage it gets our hearts pointed toward home right like that old radio program turning your hearts toward home you know that that's I think that's a good thing to do have our hearts toward home yeah because if our children are going to see Christ you know where they're going to see it they're going to see in our home that's where we want them to see it what to see Christ in us okay all right so yeah he arose immediately that night and departed into Egypt that's Joseph Joseph what a good example he was all right now I know I had a quote on that here just bear with me I got my timer going I just want to make sure I read that by God's grace maybe it's not on this one okay must not be on that one but brother b i to get to that sorry about that help me Jesus anyways so there's no better leader for your family Brothers than you your God's provided leader for your wife and your children think of Abraham Abraham was God's provided leader for Sarah no one else could have led her to have a child only Abraham because he's the only one that had faith for it right right he was a perfect choice for Sarah so after following her or after she found him for 25 years she inherited the promise amen there's a few bumps in the road there there's a few stumbles and lying in a little bit of deception there's an ishmail there's a Hagar a lot of few bumps in the road but if they just stayed true to the faith if she just stayed true and humbled herself and followed that man God's provided leader she received her promise Glory think of Joshua the great prophet Moses went out to seene oh our great love our beloved leader he's the one that brought us out of Egypt we love him oh my the tables of stone and all these things what they do they decide well if God took him off the scene God must be raising up another leader and so God raised up a Joshua and the people followed him and they followed him so far they got circumcised Glory they crossed over Jordan and they went in the promised land and Jo Joshua told him this is your land that's your land go fight for that land he positionally repl them because he was the Right leader for them amen God help us to be position replaced by the holy spirit amen that the leader the holy spirit will lead us Brothers to place our children in certain the right channels the right activities how many would say Amen to that God lead me to place my children in the right positions my wife in the right position get everybody placed right in the right place in our family then we got a real moving Army for God Amen look at this one here uh lot lot was not so much of a good leader lot did pretty good at the beginning lot was following Abraham although Abraham was not supposed to have follow him he was doing better followed Abraham than he was the other way and then he took the wrong choice he looked at Sodom and said M I need to go after Sodom and riches and I'm going to devote my life to that I'm gonna spend my time close to riches and all these homosexuals and everything like that and what happened we don't even know if his wife or daughters were saved probably lost because Jesus said remember them and don't act like them but we know lot was saved yeah so see what his leadership did his leadership took them closer to worldliness yeah he's a good man he's a saved man right brother he's saved L was saved he's righteous but his leadership got off he led them the wrong direction and he didn't really care as much about his children did he because he told those men those homosexual men he said you want my two daughters take my two daughters not these two men what kind of father would do that you don't even care about this daughter's purity and everything like that what kind of a filthy I should say filthy would say but what kind of a thinking must have been in his mind think about that look at his leadership he was the Right leader but he made the right wrong decisions I'll say like that I already showed Joseph with Mary and Jesus how many uh how many like reading Ezra let's go to Ezra chapter 8 this is beautiful now let's go to Ezra 8 verse one now this is a beautiful story this is when Ezra is bringing out these Jews out of Babylon and God's trying to God Inspire them go back and rebuild the Temple go back to Jerusalem and they get to the spot where Ezra's getting nervous he's like yeah he asked the king well can we have like an escort to protect us across the desert and all these robbers out the desert all these things like that and he got all scared look at verse 81 these are now the chief of their fathers and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of arz Xerxes the king now go down to verse 15 I gather them together to the river that run to Aha and there Abode we in tents three days and I viewed the people and the priests and found their none of the sons of Levi now go down to verse 21 so he sees we're all gathered here we're just trying to leave Babylon verse 21 then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of aava I think it's aava that we might afflict ourselves before our God to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance praise God what is he trying to do he's trying to make an exodus out of Babylon Glory we're trying to make an exus out of the things of the world is that right but he doesn't know the way how's this going to happen and what does the man do what's the real leader do he said let's fast and pray glory in other words let's seek God I don't know how our little ones I don't know how my children and family are going to make it out of here alive amen I don't know how they're going to make it out of there see alive but if I fast and pray and seek God don't you think God will answer my prayer praise God I'm the priest of the home I gotta pray I got to seek God and that's what our brothers must do they must seek God for the leadership of their little ones for their wives they've got to seek God's face with prayer heyen verse 22 for I was ashamed to inquire of the king a band of soldiers and Horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken un the king saying the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power his wrath is against all them that forsake him so he fasted and besought our God for this and he was intreated of us amen so when they fasted and prayed God heard them now Ezra was going to go ask him for help but he was ashamed because his testimony was all full of Faith he said if if we're doing right God will be with us God will protect us but they started fearing what do I do what do I do and he said well fast and pray and then when they fasted and prayed God heard them from Heaven amen look at verse 31 then we departed from the river of Hava on the 12th day of the first month to go into Jerusalem and the Hand of our God was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lie in wait by the way don't you love that men the men of the homes decided we're going to fast and pray to know how to lead our little ones and our and our wives and when they did God delivered them because the leaders the men fasted and prayed about how to seek God how many brothers like that amen and I told us to the church before I know where my calling is I prayed and fasted and God showed me I'm to be Pastor I thought about going back to evangelism a few years ago God showed me I put a fleece before Lord and showed me I'm supposed to Pastor so I'm not worried about my direction anymore I fasted and prayed for that God showed me but I told the brothers I said if you ever want to fast and pray here at the church and sleep in here for a weekend and fast and pray let me know I'll be happy to join you happy to join you this is a serious thing we got little ones depending on us we got wives depending on us and we want to be in the right direction for the Lord is that something to take lightly something to seek God about in closing I'm at well how many minutes am I all right yeah at nine minutes okay so one more minute I'll try to close you how many thank God for those examples in the Bible real Godly leaders there's no better leader than a man who's filled with the Holy Ghost a man that's loving his wife loving his children praying for them asking God God how can I direct Malachi how can I direct Lydia my daughters how can I guide my wife to love you more those are the kind of prayers God loves to hear amen okay so let me uh close with this here Well's send our feet here I want to read this I want to read a little paragraph out of this book here I'm going to read a scripture I want to kind of close to this again let me just read this here when a man and woman marry they share high expectations they commit themselves to meet certain intents and intimate needs in each other on exclusive basis each agrees to forsake all others did everybody say that when they got married I'll forsake all others for you honey giving each other the exclusive right to meet those intimate needs that does not imply that all needs are to be met by a spouse that there are a few basic needs that most of us strictly reserve for the marriage bond most people expect their spouse to meet these Special Needs since they have agreed not to allow anyone else to meet them so I'm closing with that closing with that and I'm going to just read Ephesians 5 I told you I close of the scripture we're going back to Ephesians 5 when people get married they promise to God they promise to everybody I'm going to meet your needs I'm going to learn how to love you in other words I'm going to love you the way you need to be loved and if they don't keep that that's when trouble happens brother Braham said you need to be so in love so that when the Trials come you can understand each other and be patient and Grace can keep you together Hallelujah edans 5 verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loves loves himself think about that a man doesn't love his wife he don't really like himself right so he must be having a lot of inward battles right because if you love your wife you love yourself because she's a part of you you're one Spirit praise God now let's have let's just B our heads in a word of prayer here I just want to read a few things uh brother Bram said I send these on the the email this week brother Bram said now everyone wants to be loved I tell you the truth I do brother BR said the world's are looking for something today when your little wife told you she'd be your sweetheart and wife she was looking for somebody to love her and when you promised your husband she was he was looking for somebody to love as well he says that's what causes separation in families is the neglect of love I just want to stop right there now Church which just our heads bowed I just want to say first of all thank you for sticking around for second service and I know I'm sure it blessed you if you love the Lord I'm sure I just want to give us a chance to think about our lives and our marriages and so forth like I said if you're not married you can think about your love for God are we neglecting any love for god let's just think about that families are separated because of lack of love let's pray here Heavenly Father Lord we read your word we preached your word Lord God we've pointed these things out Lord your word is so rich we've seen many many wonderful things tonight we've seen Lord that the Holy Spirit loves when a man is trying to win a wife he loves that because it's the type of Christ the Holy Spirit Lord tells the man enjoy love your family everywhere just don't go to another well just drink from your own water your own sisters enjoy your own and the Holy Spirit tells us that he's watching us men how we treat our wives and children you don't want to deal treacherously we want to deal fairly Lord the Holy Spirit tells us that as men we're God's provided leader for our family and we've got to stay in line with the Holy Spirit father as we close Lord God we look at these things Lord we made these vows and as a man I'm saying it and I'm sure the sisters would say it to their spouses I would say it Lord I promised my wife I would love her Lord I can't do that without your love so Lord I just pray God help me Lord to show to shine and reflect your love to my wife this week dear God help me to love my children this week help me to make more time Lord to sit down with them and talk with them and meet their needs if I possibly can now Church how many raise your hand and say brother Jesse pray for me too that I'll be able to do the same thing I'll be a Godly leader I'll repent of my sins when I make a mistake and I'll try to devote more time to my wife and children God bless those hands and father Lord you saw their hands Lord Jesus I just pray you'd see this sincere heart behind it dear God lord we need your help in this hour Lord God life seems to keep speeding up because of technology and Lord the busy schedules and things but Lord I just pray you give us wisdom to know how to slow it down that we can enjoy time with our family we can enjoy talking and Lord is hopefully next Sunday we can sit down and say honey how what can I specifically do to love you better Lord probably there's some conviction in our hearts Lord no doubt if we even stopped to take a few minutes and Lord think about how we're treating our spouses but Lord help us as we look in the future as a husband what does my wife need what can I ask her and say honey how can I love you better like Christ would as a wife hubby how can I love you better dear God you know our hearts you know we want homes Lord where the angels can visit us dear God because we we love you we read your word and we sing your songs help us Lord God we need you we thank you for this time Lord in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen praise God like I said
