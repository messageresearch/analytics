Revelation chapter 13 I'd like to continue on Revelation chapter 13 tonight by God's grace I'm sorry my throat in pain this week I think I preached too hard over the weekend Wednesday friday-sunday so I'm trying not to stress it too hard if I can help it but let's go to the Word of God here and know God will certainly help us tonight by God's grace Revelation chapter 13 now we basically preached last time on verses 1 and 2 and I believe last time we preached was brother Aaron's dad was here by God's grace so it's nice to have him here tonight let's give him a round for blessing said amen praise God jesus said wherever two or three gather he's right there so we're so thankful I have Jesus Christ with us here tonight and so thankful makes it a tremendous blessing to gather every time in the name of the Lord Jesus so we made it just through verses 1 & 2 so I like to pick up here and verse 3 and the revelation 13:3 we're working our way through the book of Revelation I believe this is part 92 if I'm not mistaken so let's look at verse 3 verse 3 says and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who's able to make war with the Vatican I read that right no but that's what it's talking about who's ever made war with the Vatican no one verse if reverse five and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies now look at verse five it skips ahead to the Tribulation Period because it speaks of three and a half years see God hides his wisdom from the wise and the prudent is that right and reveals it unto babes and there was given on in verse five a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then the dwell in heaven and it was given on him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world If any man have an ear let him hear let's read verse 10 together ready one two three he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints it's had one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just making known unto God here as we bow our heads here Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your amazing grace father so good to sing these songs Lord there's no guilt in life there's no fear and death because the power of Christ has come upon us Lord we repented we were baptized were justified were sanctified and Lord filled with the Holy Ghost for those who are Lord if we are that if we truly are born again then we have the power of Christ in us Lord God and Lord there's now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk in the spirit and not in the flesh father take this word here tonight break it to your saints Lord God give me Grace and strength Lord each person give them a special portion of your anointing here today and we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you to be in seated praise the Lord so let's look at revelation 13 here we'll go back just briefly and look at verse 1 & 2 now remember in verse 1 and 2 the Bible said and I stood up upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy so we know this is a beast rising up out of the sea sea represents people's multitudes tongues and nations so this is the fourth Kingdom the fourth Gentile Kingdom that would rise and verse 2 tells us it's the Roman Kingdom but it has all the combined powers of Babylon Medes and Persians and the ancient Greeks Alexander the Great all those same demon powers are now in the Roman Catholic Church because the Bible said the Beast I saw I'm sorry in the Beast which I saw was like on the leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his sea and his great Authority so it's Satan himself who now fills this Roman power this spirit of Rome and that's where we stopped we ended last time we looked at this looking at the the feet the feet there of this the statue and if you just can bear with me for a minute I'd like to go back there and just reference that I was studying on that again this week so let's go I want to go back there I'm going to keep my spot there in Revelation 13 and let's head I'm gonna head back to Daniel 243 that's just briefly I strike that and that was a great revelation to me Church it and what I mean was revelations are unveiling and so it unveiled the power and the importance of living a godly life at home because you and I know just as well as anything anybody can come to church and just act a little reverent during church time right around message churches anybody can come to church and just as long they don't you know interrupt the service speaking in tongues and as long as I just sit there and be quiet everybody thinks they're a good person and the church said right is that you've know we've all known people like that that can sit in a church and and you watch them in church they look fine doesn't look like anything's wrong with their life but you get to know them a little closer you find out some things are wrong with their life and if that's wrong with their life then something's wrong in the home so it was revealed to me through the Holy Spirit that the home is the most important part of our Christian walk how you live at home tells how you live everywhere else so if you're in your home if you're undisciplined if you're you're compromising in your home then you will compromise on your job in the family in the school in the church as well but your home is the most important place because that is Satan's greatest desire is to conquer you in your personal life right amen Daniel 243 but remember we looked at this and we saw your home life really proves what you are no matter how much people shout and scream in a church service no matter how many revival services people go to or you and I go to no matter how many special meetings we have no matter how much we can get emotional matter how much we can say wow what a wonderful service that was if we don't have that same power of God in our home that it's meaningless and alls it was was a emotional experience but you know you've had more than an emotional experience which when the Holy Ghost comes upon you brother BAM said you're gonna have emotion but when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you can defy Satan in your home and live a sanctified Holy Spirit filled life in your home now you've got power praise God because you and I I get emotional I cried on Sunday I cry Friday night you know I cry every time the presence of God is here I usually weep and cry or shout or something but if I don't have that same devotion in my home that I missed it then I've only god anoint me in my spirit realm and not my soul realm you and I both know David had a good anointing on his flesh his cup ran over the Holy Ghost came upon it he slew Goliath he prophesied right he wrote the Bible he prophesied my bone stare at me my God my God why I forsake of me but when it came down that lust devil he became a murderer and he became an adulterer and God said the sword will never depart from your house why because the Holy Ghost was not yet given in the soul so you and I she'll be able to slay not so much natural Giants but Devils right lust Giants right fear Giants Pride Giants that's the devil's you and I got a destroy by God's grace when you really got that power now you know you got something special and you know you've been the Prince of somebody greater right than a preacher greater than just a church member when you've got power to the five Satan and slay those spiritual Giants it proves you've been the presence of God Almighty when you can live it in your home and every demon that comes against your home you can cast down overcome live a real Christian life now you've got the real power of the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah now Daniel 2 now verse 40 speaks of iron so Rome is an iron power and it breaks and subdues all things the Bible says it crushes it breaks see Satan wants to break your communion with God he wants to crush your fellowship with God now verse 41 where as I saw as the feet in the toes part of potters clay which is Protestantism and part iron brother man tells in the church age book the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it the strength of the iron and for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay so in the feet the catholicism and protestantism was mixed together and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas our sauce iron mixed with miry clay they shall he says mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay now I was doing some study and I was reading on the Vatican's website this week and I'll be honest I don't spend a whole lot of time there because there's no life there but I reason I'm there is to spy out what they really believe right as like a spies went into God used spies and so when I went in there I found clearly on their website and let me just find the exact words they actually make yeah they actually make every Catholic vow they say Catholics can never marry non Catholics unless one condition the one condition is that a Catholic who marries a non Catholic this is called the Catholic code of canon law this is right on their website they can only marry someone who's not a Catholic if they promised to remove dangers of defecting from their faith while promising to do all in your power so that your offspring are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church so see this is the fulfillment of Daniel 243 how many can say amen to that that's their fulfillment there their power has to mingle their seeds with the seeds of the world so Catholics are led by the enemy to marry outside just marrying anybody if they want and as long as they promise we're gonna be true to the Roman Spirit and we're gonna I'll marry you as long as you can promise I can raise my children Catholic in other words bring them under the bondage of that Roman spirit amen and that's how this has been fulfilled praise God and so see how do they mingle their seed they marry and then they raise the next generation the by jesus said their twofold children of hell than the first generation is that right so how does Satan conquer he conquers by destroying people's home life the family altars taken away there's no more sincerity people just go through the motions they read the Bible but it doesn't have any impact on them right and church that's what we got to be careful of in the message that we just don't read more other brands books or read the Bible and it doesn't bring reality it's got to bring a reality that means if someone sins in your family you got to go talk to them about it praise God if somebody hurts your feelings and sins against you yeah you got to forgive him but you need to go tell him about it if not a sinful cancer grows in the home praise God and that was revealed to me what did Satan do what did Satan do at the beginning he attacked the home the husband and wife see what a saint like to do he likes to go in there and divide husband against wife is that right Church that's a Satan's tactic and you can trace it all down through the Bible what was he trying to do he's trying to get them to compromise in their homes because if he knew a key key key he can conquer them then then the next generation will be further and further away from God remember judges - let's go to judges - I believe it's judges - ten Joshua judges Ruth and Samuel the Scriptures come into my heart here hope it's judges - 10 if not I'm gonna have to look in the concordance here no it's four to ten glory judges - ten Thank You Lord judges - ten and also all that generation were gathered on their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel what a sad condition this is why you had judges that were women right this is why you had Samson a man that will had power he gave his body to God but not his heart to God and we've got to be careful that to give God our strength our body but also give him our heart and see your how you live at your home proves who has your heart praise God but see when Satan or when Satan takes your heart when you don't set your when we don't make our home life we don't give God the time we need he needs at home to be number one then Satan robs us of our home and a den Ende generation rise up but doesn't know Christ like we are like they ought to and that's how Satan conquers but how does God conquer God conquers by Christians parents that really love God that really serve the Lord they obey God in the home and the home is just an extension of the church praise God amen so however the parents live at church they live the same way at home praise God that's exactly right thank the Lord see we won a generation we want our children here to know the power of God to know what God's done Amen hallelujah they've got to know that if they don't know that then we failed as parents now God can have Grace on us you know mercy and forgive us course right God does that many times but our responsibility is to live so close to God that these children know that there's a Living God and he's the same yesterday today and forever that's right now liddie you can switch over I do have some quotes I just want to lay that foundation there I want to just back to that that was so striking how did a confess income in his home right and sixteen innocent people soldiers for the for the message right the Israel message sixteen innocent men died because Satan defeated him in his house he was hiding sin in his house and Church that's where you and I are probably gonna hide it like most people aren't gonna you know most women won't come here like if they're struggling and you know cut their hair off and come to church yeah right most men won't come in here with tattoos all over them oh I know really I know brother Jesse's really struggling he got a brand new tattoo on his neck like you know it's not gonna be like that it's gonna be some somebody that who loves God which was part love you know with but then they let a sin hide in their life and they caught they keep coming to church but something's hiding in there in their life at home and they haven't made it right how did Ananias and Sapphira both die before Peter they agreed to lie in their home right it's always the home life god help our homes to not be filled with Babylonian garments with stolen gold but let our home as proverbs said be filled with treasures amen treasures like oil treasures like wine Laurie that's what we're talkin about see it goes back to that Satan knows how to conquer he mingles his his seed with the seed of men he conquers in the home with the most important place you can serve God is in your home then if you're if you're fired up for God in your home then you're gonna be fired up a church right no preachers got to pump you up we don't have a special man just just to get you pumped up we don't they have brother Amen or somebody sing a special just to get you pumped up you're already pumped up with the power of God in your house because you've been casting out Satan all all week at your house victorious in your house and when you come to church you bring that victory with you to church amen see that's that's God's pattern praise God it's not to be a Aiken and hide things and then try to come to church and the church the prayers don't work at church oh I hope hope nobody ever here would bring an unrepentant heart to church and then when we pray for the sick they're not made well I hope that doesn't happen to our church that's that's not be a defeated Church let's be a victorious Church praise God now verse 1 & 2 was Imperial pagan Rome now verse 3 to 10 is the Beast out of the sea we began looking at this briefly now verse 3 to 10 was what we read for our text I'm gonna head back there to revelation 13 now in here you have the current papal Rome the hold I'm sorry the unholy Roman Empire the unholy Roman Empire now I like to read this here again now brother Branham said this took place during the third church age except verse 5 speaks of the of the Great Tribulation Period cuz it speaks of 42 months and did you notice Church that he even got he even made war with the Saints and overcame them right for 42 months so that's not speaking of Holy Ghost Saints that's either speaking of foolish virgin or the Jews right either the foolish virgin or the 144,000 so see you gotta really be careful because God just lays it in there and we need the Holy Spirit to come rightly divide it for us praise God now you all see this picture I think I showed it last time see we're down here now okay but what happened here is that the Roman Empire turned into the Catholicism okay so that's what's happening here in the scripture verse 3 to 10 is Imperial pagan Rome wounded to death okay wounded to death it was healed in papal Rome now notice again as we said last time the beast has the same number of heads this beasts in Revelation 13 has the same number of heads and horns as the Scarlet beast that the woman rides in revelation 17 so see the Roman Catholic Church rides the demonic power of ancient Rome okay she rides the Beast the woman sits upon the Beast now listen you're either gonna be you're either gonna have one of two mothers either your mother is gonna be the mother harlot or your mother is gonna be the New Jerusalem oh yeah thank God you want to see that in Scripture Galatians 4 let's go there I just seen that this morning fresh so this book of revelations about two women which woman is going to be your mother that's what it comes down to we're happy to say tonight our mother is the New Jerusalem hallelujah Galatians 4 I believe it was 26 yeah that's right so in this they're talking about two covenants either the new covenant the covenant of grace or the Covenant of the law it's a verse 24 or if you go to verse 26 but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us ah now if you look that word up mother it means motherland so the New Jerusalem is the mother land of us all amen brother Aaron where did you wear it where's your real where's your real land of origin is it Marian or is it married or is it heaven heaven sister Connie is it Florida or is it heaven or Maryland is it Maryland or heaven that's right see the Bible saying that the New Jerusalem is your motherland it's your native land jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also so the New Jerusalem represents your home and you're to be made by somebody and person was Jesus Christ because the Bible said you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world amen to see that's why this this whole book is about two women right - two women the the mother harlot the Roman Catholic Church or this New Jerusalem the mother of us all and she's the home for the bride of Jesus Christ amen praise God thank the Lord so she is the mother of us all Galatians 4 26 the New Jerusalem so you got a mother yes my mother is a New Jerusalem of course the crater of that is God Almighty amen that's my mother land hallelujah is heaven going back there thank the Lord so it's the same beast so the woman rides the same spirit of Rome all right now in verse well before I get to that I just want to say a few more things here let me pick that up let me go back to Revelation 13 yeah the the wound that was healed let me pull up this quote real quick here bless you all right here it is now history literally says this history literally says that I think I mentioned this on Sunday or Friday history literally says that when Constantine was Emperor around was around 300 AD he changed the capital of Rome he changed it from Rome to Constantinople and when he did that their kingdom the Roman kingdom was starting to fall and history says that was when the power shifted from peg pagan Rome to papal Rome he switched it because remember what did he do he had a false conversion and then he United paganism with Christianity right remember the 3rd church age means married how many remember that Pergamos means married constantine married church and state and so around 500 AD the Roman Empire felt was invaded you know they weren't paying their soldiers they were so bankrupt that they weren't paying their show soldiers they you know they come to collect their checks where's my payment Oh government's out of money now they couldn't print money like we can like we can do again just print it all out and you know put ourselves 20 million dollar 20 trillion dollars in debt now right there's about 20 trillion but it's almost like the same thing the money's gonna run out one of these days right we know that it's gonna be so far in debt so they couldn't pay their soldiers so their soldiers stopped doing their jobs and they did other jobs to make money and history says they got so weak they expected so far and try to control so much that they lost control of it they they didn't have enough money for it and then they had so much bickering in the government that they couldn't get anything established there and so because of that they got weak and they spread themselves too thin they were a superpower that got to super and could even couldn't even handle all that all their requirements and so because of that around 500 all this armies came in and destroyed it and the kingdom phal well see it look like the pagan rome fell but the bible said in verse 2 that the deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast so that spirit of Rome is somewhere today we know where it is amen right the mind that has wisdom knows who that woman is that's right she sits on seven hills hallelujah so the world wonders after the Beast and the power that was in ancient Rome pagan Rome now goes in papal Rome that's right so anybody can see that now let's look at the scripture here now I don't know if you knew this but let's look at verse where was it I'd like to see it Oh verse 6 brother Branham teaches this in the I think it's the fourth seal I don't have the quote right in front of me but in Revelation 13 I'm sorry revelation 13:6 and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven so brother Branham calls this triple blasphemy I think I've covered this a couple times but I want to do it again so the Roman spirit blast seems the name of God and how does it do that it changes the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it swaps it for the Holy Trinity right how many been to a Catholic wedding what do they bless the Catholic wedding in in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost whatever this this I'm not even sure what they're doing they're like a cross they are not blessed them they're not blessing the marriage in the name of Jesus Christ they're blessing in another name and that's blasphemy because it's changing God's name the Bible said in Colossians 3:17 whatever you do in word or deed belong the name of Jesus Christ every marriage should be done the name of Jesus Christ every baptism should be done the name of Jesus Christ every prayer in your home every prayer we have for healing this sick should be done in the name of Jesus Christ and they take that holy water right and they say oh now you're annoying you with the holy water of the Father Son Holy Ghost that's blasphemy right that's speaking evil of a good thing right speaking evil about the name of Jesus Christ saying that's not sufficient we need to replace it with a three God right a three person name so the Bible's right see the Bible's right they blaspheme the name of God look at the second one when they blaspheme next they blaspheme his name second they blasting the tabernacle you can look it up look it up in any encyclopedia Rome is called the Eternal City it's called that way because the Vatican is decked with priceless artwork gold and precious valuables that you cannot calculate it's incalculable how much value there is in their eye other macula Michelangelo artwork and all the jewels and everything all the gold it's invaluable and because she exalts herself and calls herself the Eternal City she's blaspheming our mother the Eternal City right the Eternal City which is the New Jerusalem see so she blasphemes heaven the Bible said no that's right yeah verse six she blasts seems his tabernacle that's the tabernacle of God right the New Jerusalem by calling herself the Eternal City eternal Rome is not eternal because the Bible said her plagues come in one day can you imagine one day just like last week sister County sent me that link of that that church that Merton down in a matter of hours right it stood for 18 hour for 800 years at stood but all's it took was a few hours of fire and it burnt down what a pre figure to the tribulation amen when that not just one church but the entire Vatican is going to be destroyed in one hour the Bible says what a pre figure that's what as soon as I saw that from Connie I thought oh what a what a foreshadowing of what's to come no matter how long it looks like Rome's gonna stand or these churches false churches are gonna stand with the mother harlots because they repented not of their sins they're gonna be burned with fire may God help us to repent of all of our sins that the fire of the Holy Ghost will burn out any sin in our lives that's what we need now we don't need the natural fire we need the consuming fire of the Holy Ghost to burn out any desire for sin in our lives right now so that our lives will stand on that day will go raptured up to heaven while God's fire comes down to destroy she'll be judged in one hour her plagues come in one day because strong is the Lord God who judges her Amen hallelujah now that you're the third blasphemy is then that dwell in heaven you probably know it but the doctrine Rome has is communion of saints they literally say in their catechism that they make spiritual exchanges with Saints so when they pray they pray to st. James or they pray to us you know mother Mary they're making spiritual exchanges and we know brother Branham calls that spiritualism in other words it's witchcraft see everytime they pray to st. Andrew or they pray to Saint Peter they're making exchanges with Devils right and they say and I just have some of my friends I haven't felt led to rebuke him yet on Facebook but some of my friends say oh oh look my prayer to st. Andrew was answered this and this and this happened I thought my those Devils are slick aren't they they can try to line things up where Lemire where it looks like that prayers were answered but listen only God answers prayer when they say that happens it's either one or two things either God had mercy on their ignorance or the devil's aligned things up and made it look like the prayers were answered oh I sold my house because I prayed in the name of Saint so and so that has nothing to do with it amen that Saint didn't hear the prayer there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus so see that blasphemes them in heaven can everybody see that well Graham says that's triple blasphemy now as I told you let's go down to verse 11 now here we see the next beast so now you know there's two beasts in Revelation 13 there's a beast out of the sea but the RAM calls that Imperial pagan Rome in the church age book and now there's the beast out of the earth which we this is the United States so now it is that demon power of the spirit of Rome moving the United States right because gee because mother ham said thus saith the Lord according to Matthew for Satan controls every government in the world right every government the world so you don't you have to wonder like who's who's the spirit behind you know that the government of india which spear is behind india what spirits behind russia the Iron Curtain the bamboo curtain what spirit is behind China what spears behind United States you never have to wonder the spear behind it is Satan himself remember Jesus never argued when Satan said well I I could give you all these powers I could give you all these kingdoms Jesus never argued Satan got that power because he tricked Adam right or in a tricked Eve and then Adam willingly gave up his rights in the Garden of Eden right the Bible said whom a man is overcome the same he's come into bondage of right so when Adam forfeit his rights and took part took of that that that sex act we know with Eve he he forfeited his power he forfeit his rights and now Satan has these rights as god of this world but thank god there's a God of the universe that's higher than Satan and that's our God amen now the Beast out of the earth now let's look at a few scriptures here so the beast out of the earth is the power of the holy roman unholy roman empire so I keep saying holy it's unholy Roman Empire in the United States so verse 11 through 18 is important for you and I people ask me all the time questions all the time people asked me it was the United States in the Bible and I said yes it's in Revelation 13 verses 11 to 18 right thank God that we know that now brother man tells us this here that beast represents power scarlet represents royal he says and means scarlet means red and beast means power now I want you to know something here brother BAM I'm quoting from 1958 we are not denomination he said when you see that beast coming up out of the sea it meant that this power was raising up among the people but in Revelation 13 when this lamb came up he came up out of the earth no people united states now a member church when when the pilgrims came here there was Native Americans here I read a quote that said there was about a hundred million Native Americans already here but compare that hundred million with all the people in Africa right Europe China right because in imperial pagan rome was huge rome controlled almost all of europe right it did control all of europe and most of africa and when those when those little pilgrims those separative you know made it through the storms and got over here it was a much smaller population right and that represents the land this beast rose up out of North America it wasn't like Imperial pagan Rome that rose up right out of where Alexander had had exited it was a much smaller number of people and so Bodrum tells us this beast out of the land is the United States and then after he had two little horns civil and ecclesiastical powers and then he received power and spake like the dragon did before him so you just got to mark it down now here here's a the state the Lord he said we the United States we are coming in to religious persecution with the same things they did in pagan Rome many years ago for its thus saith the Lord so America is going to have a religious persecution and it's not maybe it's thus saith the Lord that's what revelation 13 11 through 18 is all about brother Ram said it's thus saith the Lord it's going to happen doesn't look like it now but it's going to build up into it that's right now look away to Jesus brother man reads this and he says there's coming a time in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was pagan Rome when it became papal Rome see that this nation would do that see because it's the same Beast the Beast that rose up by the sea is now the same Beast rising up out of the land in the United States if you can see that can you say Amen everybody see that all right let me get to my spot here I'd like to get to you okay he says revelation 13 plainly explains it the lamb come up out of the earth the other beasts come up out of water thickness and multitudes of people this lamb come up where there were no people a lamb represents religion the Lamb of God remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb and after a while it be received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised all the power the dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always see don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination an image under the Beast so Protestants are the image under the beast but Rome is the Beast can risky that Rome is the Beast that the woman rides but the image of the beast since that this beast is invisible right this beast power is invisible so the Beast power needs an image and that visible image is the World Council churches does you know right now they literally says on their website I could show it to you if you like afterwards it literally says one of their goals is to be an image of Christian unity it's one of their it's right there they seek to be an image for Christian unity and the Bible says they're the image under the Beast and they represent over 500 million Protestants right now they represent they're not United with Catholics the World Council of Churches represents over 500 million Christians Protestant Christians so see it's it's exactly what the Prophet said he said they'll make a power that'll force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be in this council churches or you won't be able to have fellowship all right now let me just show you these I want to real briefly say this the United States is the modern-day Rome both Rome and the United States had the largest economies in the world they had their strongest militaries they had the most influential politics all the other little countries in the time of Rome wanted to be like Rome because they had a republic right they had the most advanced technologies like United States they had the most freedom and variety and cultural expressions Constantine made sure of that he started protecting Christians when before Christians could very easily be martyred but he started protecting them so now Rome had a freedom of religion and the most religious tolerance and that's what we have in America right now even Muslims are now in the the House of Representatives right in the Senate you know what it what a sad thing that is because of their hate crimes while that they stand for but see it was the most it so the modern Rome I'm sorry ancient Rome matches modern Rome which is the United States of America that's just perfectly and see it's like a lamb which means a bison or Buffalo on 13 2016 then President Barack Obama made the bison the official national mammal of I'd say of America there's only two animals I represent in the United States right huh eagle and that was wrong symbol right now okay never eagle in the book and now a bison by God is good amen God has showed us these symbols praise church we can't miss it the only way you'll miss it is if you're not listening to Holy Spirit but if you're listening the Holy Spirit blessed it are your ears for they hear we cannot miss it there are no excuses in this message God has sent us a prophet to tell us exactly what this book means praise God and when we have the power of this book then we have the power of Revelation to overcome all of Satan's tactics amen it's exactly right now I said this is he said thickness and multitudes of people's water then this is where there's no people United States he said two horns like a lamb not a lamb see it's like a lamb not a lamb what is it it's our American Buffalo and has two horns Ram says he had freedom of religion first he acted like a lamb he spoke like a lamb but remember he never did become an old Ram he was a lamb this country is only 150 years old you know just a lamb how many know that Rome lasted over 500 years Rome lasted over 500 years right we're just little over 200 right now right 1776 1896 I'm sorry 18 1876 1976 right so we're not even we're about half of what Rome actually did so considered a young country now I want to look at this here again and I want to just show a little bit of history I was researching this week so Catholicism United States let me know this guy here now brother Graham said he might have been a nice guy he said but it was that spirit behind him that will cause all the trouble now how many know about his personal life he had an awful awful personal life this guy JFK let me know that and now it's starting to come out now there was rumors before but these last 10 years all that's come out it's awful now I want to read you this first one oh look at this now before I get too FK remember this this nation this beast speaks like a dragon how does America speak like a dragon every president brags on how great we are right not just Donald Trump he's just the next one they've all bragged on it but the the clearest bragging I could find was last year Donald Trump before the United Nations he stood there in front of United Nations and he said this he said America's military will assume be more powerful than it has ever been before so look at him look he stands her but like every president of that Obama Bush they all did it you know they all stand there for nine nations say were the greatest power there is what did what did they do in church they're fulfilling the scripture that says they speak like a dragon hey remember Trump Trump threatened them he said we're gonna cut off some of our funny he said you guys need to provide some of this funding to what is he doing he's bossing around the rest of the countries because he's got power to do it right he said he said you got it too easy under Obama they let you you know bomb would've just paid everything and let you guys just do it everyone he said you need to you need to do your fair share right he stand there talking like a dragon because it's it's the likes brother like brother BAM said thus saith the Lord it's Satan's the power behind all these government's right that was September 2018 and did you know President Trump said he said he said our government or he said our are our cabinet yeah our administration in the first two years he says has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of America did you know he said that and United Nations are laughing and Trump County got upset he said you shouldn't be laughing at that he said we have the lowest and unemployment rate and he named off all these all these things about our country but what am I trying to show you I'm trying to show you that America's speaking like a dragon just like the Bible said saw presidents like Ronald Reagan he threatened the Soviet Union I said you better break it up and what happened a few years later they broke it up remember the wall came down when I was a child I remember that I'm ever watching on TV when the for the Cold War you know the cold cold war ended apparently because what what happens one of these great leaders of the Dragons stands up and they speak against it what did George H Bush do he spoke against a Saudi Arabian what happened Desert Storm now I think I was 1988 I think guys or eight 1989 I remember when that happened I remember being after church I remember being in a grocery store and I heard an ounce of the grocery store that that they had their first attack there on Saudi Arabian desert storm see they speak it and it happens george w bush thought they had weapons right thought saddam hussein had weapons so what they do they go in there and they don't find any weapons but they start in this big war i don't remember that what are they doing they're speaking like a dragon they've got power and they make phenomenal claims like a dragon and they give warnings they breathe out warnings like a dragon oh my now if satan's got that power how much more power brother/sister do we have when we speak with the word of god amen it came out of jesus it comes out of Jesus in Revelation 19 and it comes out like a sword and fire burns them all up what about when we speak the Word of God church that is our that is our greatest power to be like Jesus and say it is written Satan it is written and when you speak the Word of God like that it's spiritual fire that goes out and if you keep resisting Satan he's gotta flee from you praise God remember that quote I just read it let me uh I just read it when I preached on the number 40 let me read this again brother Graham said remember Jesus showed her how it's done showed the bride forty days of temptation he was tempted above any man that ever could be tempted in the temptation of Jesus Christ glory you and I will never have a harder temptation than Christ right and what weatherman showed us he said Jesus showed us how to overcome that you speak the Word of God and say thus saith the Lord or thus saith the Word of God Satan the Word says this and you've got to back away praise God he didn't do a miracle he didn't even ask God for a miracle he just said though this is the word this is the word this is what the word says and pretty soon Satan just gets fed up with it he can't make Jesus move so he just says fine I'll try again later I'll study him I'll come back again and then the angels come to Jesus and strengthen him and alls he had to do was speak the fire of the Word of God and it got too hot for Satan amen glory in church listen any special meeting you go to I don't care which special meeting you can go to the specialist meeting in the message you can go to Jeffersonville you can go to Louisiana you can go to Happy Valley you see you can go around any church in the world and let me tell you this you will hear the same thing the same word that will set you free at those that conventions is the same we're saying here tonight speak the word to Satan is that right obey God's Word draw nigh to God resist the devil and he will flee from you I take courage that has a pastor I can't go to these big conventions but I found out through revelation of the Holy Spirit that Jesus overcame the greatest attack by speaking the Word of God and when people go to these meetings which is great it's fine when they go to the meetings they're never gonna hear anything greater to overcome their current trials than what we hear tonight speak the word and go forward fight Satan with the Word of God do not sin do not give in the lusts do not give in to temptation speak the Word of God resist Satan and Satan has to flee amen and so that was that mean brother Aaron that means every service can be a revival convention service it doesn't take big numbers brother man said his greatest meetings were with big numbers or with small little groups what do you say small little groups but we think somehow we think well the more people the better now now it's true you have more licks of fire but Church with more people you have more unbelief with lesser people you have lesser unbelief but Jesus said if there's two or three I'm right there amen and so every survey that's the power of a faithful pastoral ministry because at conventions they can't preach any higher than anyone any pastor can preach because it's the same keys to your victory every time obey the Word of God repent get your life cleaned up speak the Word of God speak thus saith the Lord and Satan has to leave your life amen so don't feel bad if you can't make it a Jeffersonville or don't feel bad if you can't make it to Louisiana or New York or special meetings really Church God didn't God never said you have to have a message Mecca right you have to go to a certain message convention to get the Holy Ghost you can get it right here you have to go to a special place to get a healing you don't have to go to Jeffersonville to get a healing you don't have to have a prayer cloth from brother Branham brother Branham said that doesn't heal you anyway it just raises your faith it's supposed to just raise your faith and show you that God's there that's all that's what any gift can do no gift can heal you it's faith that heals you and so we don't have to feel bad if there's fewer people we should be encouraged because we get there's fewer less unbelief and if we can just get that cast out and look beyond the veil and just see that Jesus Christ is here we can speak the word in all of our lives and have great victory tonight I'm gonna preach another sermon on that Lord willing in the future I'm just gonna blast that that idea that we have to have a message Mecca or we have to go to Jeffersonville just to be healed now don't get me wrong if God's leading you to go to a certain place and you just then yes you obey that leading but I'm trying to get the attitude err that that that bad that that feeling that we get we're all I can't go to special places and I I'll never get it because I can't go there that's the whole purpose of the Holy Ghost thing is that you don't have to go to a certain place or a certain person you've got to go to Christ and Christ is everywhere amen he said wherever you're gathered in my name I am there that's what makes this Testament so great the Holy Ghost New Testament is because the Holy Ghost can be everywhere at once amen I'll try not to raise my voice amen thank the Lord but that's the great burden I feel right now Church you have to feel bad if you can't go to Tennessee you have to feel bad if you can't go to Canada at a tea mystical Church or or so your brother Donny Reagan's Church or you know an Arizona Church you'd have to feel bad because the same Holy Ghost since there's here and the same way to overcome is the same way to overcome there as it is here confess your sin believe the word do not sin speak the word and all those demons have to leave you and then you can enjoy peace then you can enjoy a season of rest so that's what I did I went listen and there's wonderful youth meetings Louisiana last weekend they have it every year for Easter I've always felt bad that I can't go well I just went we listened to the last two sermons and that's all it was about get the baptism Holy Ghost so you can fight Satan and be an overcomer in your home and speak the Word of God against Satan that's all that was preached and I don't mean that in a derogatory way well what I mean that is that you and I that is so simple we don't need some some special message we just need to do what the Bible said the same thing Jesus did to Satan that's all we have to do just say it is written devil I'm not gonna try to produce something I'm not gonna let you trick me I'm gonna obey God's Word I'm gonna speak the word and I'll be an overcomer just like Christ then you'll be a happy Christian right then you'll be a victorious Christian see I knew that was in my heart because I've just been struck you know I've been meditating on that all week or so thankful listen those messages oh that's great for the youth and that they the end the meetings by saying you know all the anointing you felt here it's eventually going to fade from your human spirit and so you've got to have the baptism Holy Ghost so when you go home or you go to school they're talking all these teenagers that you can rebuke Satan and get the victory that's all that's all that it was it wasn't some new revelation you never heard before you're not missing out Church you're being fed real good here by the Holy Spirit not me by the Holy Spirit and the same way you overcome all you know and then he can't mean the same way is the same way it does here just get the anointing here draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you so you kick Satan out of your home kick Satan out off your phone or kick Satan off what are you ever listening to kick Satan out of there and watch God come on the scene thank you Lord what does he do he speaks like a dragon now let me look at this guy real quick here now lord have mercy on him I don't know where I don't know where he's going now here's some exact quotes from history JFK was elected president in 1960 when brother Branham saw that huh me know what he said he said the Holy Spirit said you need to write this down and warn the people so they know which hour were living in when he got elected the Holy Spirit told brother Branham you need to go preach on the Seven Church Ages and tell the people where they're at praise God that was important and then God came and vindicated that seven Church ages with that moon remember that moon picture be coming and vindicated and the Holy Spirit showed the the seven church age is his moons right and showing how much light there was in each age so this was really important for history because this is when the Roman Catholic Church finally got we'd say come accepted right you know if you don't know I'll let you know the Pilgrim Fathers left Europe because they were being persecuted by the Church of England which was just a offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church and we know that they are being persecuted so they they ran around for years they finally got a charter they finally paid this company helped him sail over the first year was awful and we know the second year the Native Americans helped him to add Thanksgiving and all that good stuff but the reason they came was to get away from the mother harlot but in 1960 John Kennedy said or the history says John Kennedy had to fight against the widespread conviction that rollno Roman Catholic candidate could ever be elected president and he narrowly won the presidency he didn't win it by lot and there's still a lot of history that thinks they cheated the voting system which brother Graham said they did he should not have beat Nixon mother ham said he saw an article that said every vote for Nixon was turned over to JFK in some places and there's that I even read that today in the Britannica they still think that that these voting machines are were corrupted somebody cheated the system and then that history said Kennedy rose above the religious taboo against Roman Catholics I've seen I've seen propaganda from United States newspapers against the Roman Catholic so in our country started in 1776 so newspapers would put out articles about the dangers of Roman Catholicism and slowly over the years of their okay oh they're okay and pretty soon in 1960 they elect a Roman Catholic the very thing they left to try to get a get religious freedom is the very thing they left back in did you know in 1960 in Houston Texas mine I just struck me Kennedy before he got elected had to go and preach to a bunch of Protestant ministers and promise them this is history I could show to you and promised them he would not combine church and state he would keep them separate and they voted for him because he was here's when history says he had style he was handsome he glamour he was witty he was really sharpened and funny that's why people voted for him now here's two articles if you want him I can share with you JFK was the first president to wear makeup it's history I can show you the article because he wore at the first televised presidential debate against Nixon Nixon came in there he just got done history says he just got done giving a camp a campaign speech to labor unions he was worn out and he was getting a five o'clock shadow so they just rubbed some stuff he didn't want to shave he's all tired so when they go on TV Kennedy's this big fan sees that make up all over he's smart and handsome and witty and Nixon's like when can we get this over with he's just tired and you look history says he looks like death and there Kennedy looks like life and he appealed to the women because he was so handsome in church that's not all he did with women these two articles right here say he had at least six women in the White House he'd sleep with at least and that's outside of his wife and one of them said she had a commit abortion of one of his children they have love letters that are auctioned off for I think one was auctioned off for $30,000 a couple years ago it's his love letter begging one of these women to come and spend time near Washington DC so he could they can do things together and he signs it Jay he decides it with Jay for John they notes his handwriting they can prove it's his handwriting and one of them is was murdered shortly after he was shot in Dallas Texas and died in 1963 and it's still unsolved these are the articles right here you can look it up I can show it to you and so those White House interns the 18 year olds they hire right out of high school he would sleep with them he would his workers would try to see who would like to do it and they'd bring him in there and he would just take one after another and this is what the gut this is what the people elected and brother the Baron warned him about didn't he a prophet of God tried to warn him now look in 1950 the pillar of fire was in Houston Texas ah showing God's profit ten years later the president came to Houston Texas and they'd already so forgotten about the pillar fire that they believed a Catholic president and elected him in there as president and then that same Holy Spirit came in Brenham Tabernacle that same year and said I'm warning the people you're warning that it's only been 10 years since the pillar of fire picture was taken get back to the pillar of fire Oh No thank God you and I can get back to the pillar of fire we're not swayed with all this handsomeness and Hollywood and and put on and you know what his wife said you know what Jacqueline Kennedy said the reason she never got upset with all these I mean she got upset but the reason she never did about all the adulteries was because each night he would get down and she said like a little child and he would say his Catholic prayers before he went to bed no he didn't you know he wasn't with Marilyn Monroe Affairs the mayor and she knew all about it history her own autobiography talks about it this was not something that was like hidden you know from her she knew about it but see what was it it was a man who was so possessed with demons that he was just committing adultery often all the time if Mary Magdalene had seven demons because she was a how many demons of this guy have and he would try to repent and each night by his wife so I try to say sorry God forgive me and keep doing it not and this is what America elects Oh God give us some George Washington give us some Abraham Lincoln's right the brother hand said they'll never get a revival anyway right now I want to bring that to you so you understand this is what it produced this is what a Catholic president produced now fire from heaven now revelation 13 verse 13 yeah 1313 said he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men and brother Ram says what is that what beast makes fire come down from heaven well Ram said that's the atomic bomb which America dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945 you can we see the pictures it they detonated it how far above the city male Qaeda member how many feet it was like 500 meters or something like they're 150 meters and it detonated and a light fire went off and 70,000 people instantly died when they when they when they lit that off it was fire that came down from heaven and this is the dragon that rises up out of land it's the Roman Catholic Church right it's the spirit of Rome trying to divide and conquer the man I'm saying that it's that hydrogen bomb all the scripture lines up can you say men all the history lines up revelation 13 11 through 18 is the spirit of Rome in the United States now the image of the Beast the BAMF says is the World Council of Churches I don't have to go over that most of you know that all right the mark in the right hand of forehead I mentioned this but Graham said the mark in the right hand is doing what the council wants you to do so doing the works okay so we won't preach on this or will do this doing whatever they want but Graham said the mark in the forehead is the doctrines taking the doctrines of the beasts which are trinitarianism universalism we're all saved we're all family we're all part of the all children of God no we're not Jesus said some of you are from above he said my children from above and he said some of you are from below right amen we already said that we know where we're from we came from the mind of Christ how do you know because you love the word of Christ what's the number of the man the carries filleted a which means Vicar of gods and that number in Roman numerals adds up to 666 it's got to be a number of a man remember it has to match all the other some people say well although Mystery Babylon is Istanbul Turkey or it's two Muslims or it's Jerusalem it can't be it has 11 descriptions Church Mystery Babylon has 11 descriptions and every one is Rome praise God every one is Rome and you can prove it and the only man that has a connection to Rome that will rule over the world that's called a vicar someone who's in the place of Jesus Christ is the Pope of Rome and there it is I showed you the screenshot so if you go to Google Translate you type in vicars for the day it's Vicar of gods so he is in the stead of God they call him and on the website and their catechism they say because they call the Vicar of Christ so he's in the stead of Christ now let me close with this I want to just remind us of this about the squeeze look at verse 16 brother branham said the squeeze and is in revelation 13:16 this is the squeeze now of course the squeeze happens right before this but let's read revelation 13 and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads now here's an exact quote from spoken word original seed 1962 brother Graham said the Holy Spirit said pick up your pen and write and he said I believe according to revelation 13:16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the right and the hand or forehead of permission to preach be granted a church I just had this thought the Antichrist spirit is gonna force me to stop preaching if I live long enough if I live long enough but who's trying to stop preachers from preaching right now are you with me some spirit in jeffersonville right I'm not saying it's on all the people but what spirit is trying to stop live preachers from preaching right now and it's trying to exalt an image of a holy man to the people to bow down and worship Him what spirit is that my god help us to have our eyes open Church see it's it's that spirit is already working in a immature way if right before the rapture I have to stop preaching if I live long enough and if I'm a bride member which I trust and hope I am they're gonna force me to stop preaching but there's some movement in the message that's already trying to force preachers to stop preaching and just play takes to me it looks like the same spirit so we just watch that I read that the Holy Spirit quicken that to me like oh that's already happening in a small way now it's not happening on this this level where like you know where someone's coming in here and making sure I don't preach like the government or something like that like a police officer it's not happening on that level but brother Graham said when the Holy Spirit told him pick up his pen and write we will have to stop preaching now what's beautiful about this is we don't have we won't in other words if the rapture takes place and we can't have the preaching then our lives will be have to be preaching Amen Oh glory I hope I said that right if we can't have live preaching and if they stop us from preaching may we have to go out to our houses and preach in the woods or something like that I don't know what's going to happen but if we can't have preaching then we better have lives that preach the gospel of Christ praise God because brother Ram said they're gonna silence the Brydon for the true bride from preaching oh my god help us and there's groups now that are trying to silence the preachers oh just listen and say oh just listen to tapes which is finally these tapes have a great ministry in your home right they have a great ministry too as a witnessing tool give those tapes out give those books out but you know church your life and your prayers and your love will speak louder than that I had a friend from college contact me this this yesterday he said brother Jesse he said I'm not back in church yet he said but your prayers have done wonders for me and I don't even know this he said you prayed for me for my business he's a barber he said you pray for my business and he said business is booming since you prayed for me I said well thank you Lord God heard my prayer and so I said can I send you one of my books he said absolutely so it's out in the mail I put out their mail today so if God honored my prayer for him there I trust God will honor my prayer God opened the eyes of my friend Deonte amen granite Lord bless him not just naturally bless him spiritually hallelujah see they're going try to stop the bride from preaching but it's already started a little bit out of that move out of Jeffersonville not everybody but it's already started to a little degree it's starting to build its way up I would have never thought that people from brother branham's own family or a church would tell me not to preach what brother Brahim is preaching like that I never come at wrap my mind around that but what I have to understand I have to understand that this is the spirit that's coming around the world it's gonna slowly increase to this point where right before the rapture the true bride will be forced to stop preaching Sabri understand I'm not saying anything I'm not calling anybody bad things really like that I'm just saying I can see that spirit already starting to work and God of course is still calling out his people out of her so how does the Beast conquer attacks you're home on already I just put this at the end I I preached this at the beginning but I just put at the end the same thing it at the beginning all right I stand to our feet here let's read proverbs 15 6 yeah it's the last Scripture let's read this together can y'all read this with me that's read on three one two three in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble so C we see opposites I love the the Old Testament it always works with opposites right talks about the blessed and the curse well here it is so the opposite of treasure is trouble how many want the peace of God in their homes you just want peace you just want everyone to love each other get along don't sin against each other that's the treasure of the righteous Christian if there's trouble in your home there's something you can do about it you can go to the policeman Jesus and he'll take care of it i'li he'll enforce that law but you got to obey that law you've got to respect that law you've got if you've sinned you got to confess your sin you got to come clean right and then the trouble will leave speak the word to Satan obey the word of God speak the word against Satan Satan has to flee and now your house is filled with treasure hey man how many want treasure in their homes let's pray for one another can we let's just bow our heads in Malachi if you'll come to the piano oh I love this word don't you love this word I love the word of God is so wonderful church praise God thank God for His mercy thank God for sending us a prophet praise the Lord now one time before we pray I tried to send this you know my friend talked about he's a preacher he's a pastor in Columbus and their Church of God denomination and he said you know he said we're praying for America to be revived and I wrote back and I said sir with all due respect it's thus saith the Lord America is not coming back I said there'll be a game all these scriptures there's little pockets of faithful remnant Christians that will have revival it's
