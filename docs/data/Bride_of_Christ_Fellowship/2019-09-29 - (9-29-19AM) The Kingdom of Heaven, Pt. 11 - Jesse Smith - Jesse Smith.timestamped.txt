[36:12] the wise and foolish virtuous morning
[36:14] praise the Lord said I've been doing at
[36:16] the kingdom of heaven series so I just
[36:18] kind of felt led to go this way studied
[36:21] all morning on the wise and foolish
[36:22] virgin again I I know I preach on a
[36:24] little bit here and there and we had a
[36:26] just a tremendous service a couple
[36:28] Wednesday nights ago
[36:30] sister when I was preaching on the wise
[36:33] a foolish virgin and sister Beatrice was
[36:35] dancing screaming shouting and just got
[36:37] all in the spirit it was really glorious
[36:38] a few weeks ago
[36:39] yeah but I was a yeah you can stand
[36:40] right here buddy sorry about that so um
[36:44] I know it's inspired and it's nice to
[36:47] have another vindication there by the
[36:49] grace of Lord Matthew 25 verse 1 you
[36:55] know they're singing about it is well
[36:58] with my soul the wise virgin has oil in
[37:06] her soul praise God
[37:18] let's for time sake let's just read one
[37:22] verse let's just reverse ten by God's
[37:31] grace that's kind of the the rapture
[37:34] scripture there let's all read it
[37:39] together on three of them brother was
[37:41] they worried afterwards one two three
[37:43] and while they went to buy the
[37:45] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[37:49] went in with him to the marriage and the
[37:52] door was shut let's have our brother
[37:54] read it there be no LFO so Alaska
[37:59] davin prefer Alice and Clare on con él a
[38:01] la bola is a roll of word amen a goddess
[38:05] bus in Rio is word may be seated here so
[38:16] I do have some slides Lydia we can show
[38:18] by God's grace we've been looking at the
[38:27] sixteen parables of the kingdom of
[38:29] heaven and so I want to continue on that
[38:36] today we've preached on three about
[38:38] stewardship now this is within the last
[38:45] few months two of them about endtime
[38:50] conditions tore about the Jews and the
[38:56] Gentiles we preached on the great supper
[39:02] on Wednesday I'm sorry it was the wicked
[39:08] husbandmen that was Wednesday we
[39:14] preached to about sin and also on
[39:20] Wednesday we looked at the king's son
[39:26] that concludes with the man who didn't
[39:29] have the
[39:29] Garmadon and let me just share a little
[39:36] testimony you know I believe these
[39:41] sermons are letter the Lord we've heard
[39:47] multiple preachers preach on the same
[39:49] subjects I just heard brother Samuel
[39:55] preach on it on last Thursday night
[40:01] dealing with finding your position and
[40:06] then Wednesday's message was really
[40:09] inspired as well and here's how I know
[40:14] because our girls went home and the next
[40:19] day they were talking to my wife about
[40:22] being born again you see it takes uh
[40:27] sincere heart to want that that means
[40:33] God is dealing with hearts because cold
[40:38] hearts or backslidden hearts they won't
[40:44] examine themselves but Paul said our
[40:48] real Christian examines himself whether
[40:54] they're in the faith praise the Lord so
[40:58] I just want to share that as a little
[41:00] testimony by God's grace so you keep
[41:04] praying keep praying for these little
[41:05] ones and we'll pray for the adults we
[41:13] want everybody to have the oil because
[41:17] if you got it you'll be watching you'll
[41:22] be praying you'll be ready and we'll
[41:27] look at that today by God's grace now
[41:30] Lord willing Wednesday we'll start
[41:31] looking at the salvation parables
[41:34] [Music]
[41:38] they're all very simple but they have
[41:41] some great truths
[41:42] they someway simplified a feeling
[41:44] grounded for life remember they all
[41:47] relate to the kingdom of heaven and the
[41:52] kingdom the word kingdom means Dominion
[41:54] or rule so the kingdom of heaven is the
[42:02] rule of the Holy Ghost how he rules in
[42:09] our daily lives so this is how God wins
[42:15] our love and affection through salvation
[42:22] so this salvation begins your love
[42:26] relationship with the Lord when you
[42:32] first get saved isn't Jesus your
[42:33] treasure isn't he or one pearl that's
[42:39] greater than all the others of course
[42:43] the other ones deal with you no laboring
[42:45] or I'm sorry other ones deal with
[42:47] eternal life and forgiveness because you
[42:56] can't be saved unless you forgive others
[43:00] now the last ones beautiful it shows the
[43:03] three works of grace but the emphasis of
[43:08] that parable is God's unseen work member
[43:17] the man goes to sleep he wakes up and
[43:21] then the the plant has sprouted up the
[43:25] man goes to sleep but when he wakes up
[43:27] the plant has sprouted up and the man
[43:33] doesn't know how but that's the glory of
[43:37] being saved you don't know how it
[43:40] happened but Jesus gave you life so
[43:47] that's the beauty of it and we'll get to
[43:51] those Lord willing on Wednesday
[43:55] now this was the revelation I preached
[43:58] when the Holy Ghost fell on that
[44:04] Wednesday night when Beatrice was
[44:05] screaming and dancing in the spirit so
[44:13] the revelation was the foolish virgin
[44:16] doesn't do these things
[44:22] so the foolish virgin doesn't obey
[44:26] enough they obey a lot but not enough
[44:35] and they they don't hunger and thirst
[44:38] enough brother Branham said it perfectly
[44:44] he said you have a partial hunger but we
[44:51] have to have a full hunger a full thirst
[44:57] amen
[44:59] remember this is all based upon the
[45:01] scripture Paul said if you obey God will
[45:06] give you the Holy Ghost that's an X 532
[45:14] jesus said if you hunger and thirst for
[45:17] righteousness you'll be filled with you
[45:25] five verse six and then Jesus said if
[45:30] you ask you'll receive the spirit Luke
[45:36] 11:13 how many believe that see God came
[45:44] and vindicated on that Wednesday night
[45:50] brother Ray was here but the Aaron was
[45:54] here and then they Omi's family was here
[45:59] and it was just almost three are they
[46:03] almost a three-hour service so it was
[46:07] wonderful to see God vindicate
[46:09] this as a revelation because God always
[46:14] backs up his word amen so that with this
[46:21] foundation here you know with this
[46:24] revelation then we want to take a fresh
[46:26] look at the wise and foolish virgins
[46:38] okay now this parable differentiates two
[46:47] kinds of Christians and there's always
[46:54] been two kinds of Jews even the Old
[47:02] Testament - simple exam I'm sorry three
[47:07] simple examples are Enoch and Noah
[47:13] remember Enoch was dedicated that's what
[47:16] his name means no was a preacher of
[47:21] righteousness but he got drunk on wine
[47:27] and had to endure the tribulation of the
[47:33] flood so hope everybody can see there's
[47:37] two kinds of believers what I mean is
[47:43] two kinds of genuine believers praise
[47:49] God there was Abraham and lot Abraham
[47:54] lived away from Sodom lot lived among
[48:00] Sodom for riches and he lost his wife
[48:07] and he was tormented every day by the
[48:14] atmosphere of Sodom then there was David
[48:19] and Saul
[48:22] David was a man after the message of the
[48:25] hour which is the heart of God but saul
[48:35] was after popularity and wasted most of
[48:42] his adult life trying to murder God's
[48:48] elect but Samuel said he was saved
[48:56] did you know it was four years after
[48:58] Samuel died four years after he died the
[49:05] witch called him up that's because they
[49:12] didn't have the blood of Jesus Christ to
[49:13] protect them God it was impossible for
[49:20] the blood of bulls and goats to take
[49:30] away sin and Satan had the keys of death
[49:35] in hell but when Jesus died and shed his
[49:41] blood the bible says through death he
[49:46] destroyed death and his righteous life
[49:54] was a substitution for our lives and
[49:59] they paid what the bible called the
[50:02] ransom he paid the punishment that all
[50:10] sins deserved and he became our sin that
[50:17] we might be as righteousness so he took
[50:22] the keys of death in hell he said come
[50:26] on Saints follow me up praise God
[50:31] and he resurrected and the Bible said he
[50:33] opened the graves
[50:35] Labriola squirt but he first opened his
[50:38] grave amen
[50:40] and then the other graves were open and
[50:44] they appeared unto many praise God I'm
[50:47] sorry and the Saints appeared unto many
[50:49] in Jerusalem so this is the power of the
[50:57] Holy Spirit God still save Saul but
[51:03] Samuel said David was better than he was
[51:07] [Music]
[51:11] then these two kinds of Christians are
[51:15] the good ground and the thorny ground
[51:24] you know the good ground is the honest
[51:27] heart so listen church
[51:33] the only real message believers are the
[51:35] fully honest ones the only message
[51:39] believers the only true message
[51:40] believers are the honest ones I think at
[51:45] the end someone else because jesus said
[51:47] the good heart is the honest heart okay
[51:52] that means the wise Virgin is going to
[51:54] come to church hear the word of God and
[52:02] be honest with themselves and the church
[52:06] about their spiritual condition but the
[52:12] foolish virgins not that honest right
[52:17] because they the Bible said they have
[52:18] cares of the world and it chokes out the
[52:24] life of the word praise God so we want
[52:32] to be honest with ourselves this morning
[52:36] we want to honestly look at our lives
[52:38] praise God so see these two kinds of
[52:44] believers have always existed
[52:48] you know now let me read uh some history
[52:52] on the it's called the ancient Jewish
[52:56] marriage ceremony in Antigua ceremony I
[53:03] love you dear Matthew Henry says Henry
[53:10] Henry do you think the bridegroom came
[53:16] in the days of the Jews surrounded by
[53:21] his friends late in the night to the
[53:28] house of the bride where she expected
[53:32] him and she had her bridesmaids gathered
[53:36] around her when they knew he was
[53:43] approaching they were to go out to meet
[53:48] him with lamps in their hands and then
[53:54] go to either the father's house or back
[54:02] to the groom's house his own house
[54:06] because one historian says it was the
[54:09] father's house one says it was back to
[54:13] the groom's house so now we have the
[54:18] picture of the rapture the ten virgins
[54:24] represent both the bride and her
[54:26] bridesmaids because they're waiting with
[54:35] the Virgin's means no intercourse
[54:44] physically and spiritually right because
[54:49] in the parable is physical but in the
[54:53] spiritual I'm sorry but in the and then
[54:55] in the in the type it's spiritual praise
[55:01] God
[55:02] in other words we have we have no
[55:04] spiritual intercourse with the world
[55:09] Jesus is our only love interest we only
[55:15] give our love to Christ we don't flirt
[55:20] with the world if we get a temptation we
[55:29] overcome it we cast it down Paul said
[55:36] we're chase virgins which means means
[55:42] uncorrupted it means not deceived from
[55:51] the simplicity that's in Christ praise
[55:55] God oil is a symbol of the baptism of
[55:59] the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah
[56:04] chapter 4 let's just turn there for the
[56:10] children to see that try before matthew
[56:15] i'm matteo zechariah chapter 4 o
[56:20] Sicarius capital o quattro
[56:39] now we're not gonna read all of it
[56:44] but in verse 2 there's a candlestick all
[56:47] of gold with the ball upon the top of it
[56:55] and seven lamps their own and seven
[57:01] pipes to the seven lamps which are on
[57:06] the top thereof and two olive trees by
[57:11] it one on the right side and one on the
[57:16] left now verse 6 it says this is the
[57:22] word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying
[57:30] not by might not by power but by my
[57:32] spirit saith the Lord
[57:36] vs. unicornia spirit toward each other
[57:39] while senior now in verse 9 you can see
[57:42] some compound prophecy because it says
[57:50] the hands of zerubu & hill finish it you
[57:59] know like our lamb so in this time the
[58:06] two olive trees are Haggai and Zechariah
[58:08] those live a song a hell it's a Korean
[58:13] praise the Lord
[58:17] now this brings an interesting thought
[58:22] because a lot of people major on one
[58:25] doctrine from brother Branham I'm sorry
[58:27] one statement from brother Branham and
[58:36] they make it say like God never sends
[58:38] two prophets at the same time now from
[58:45] that looks like the scripture
[58:48] God does send two prophets sometimes
[58:52] because there's two prophets right here
[58:54] in Zechariah 4 and then there's two
[59:00] prophets in revelation 11 in the days of
[59:06] Paul there was Paul there's abacus you
[59:11] know the other power of those baba yaga
[59:13] bow now we know Paul was the major
[59:15] prophet trkage messenger I hope that
[59:22] doesn't stumble everybody here I don't
[59:23] think it will but it will stumble
[59:27] Branham worshipers I know how many know
[59:33] that's the wind of doctrine blown right
[59:35] now
[59:37] Tina random worshippers
[59:42] it is so you see this is speaking of two
[59:46] prophets and they both are fed I'm sorry
[59:52] these two trees feed the oil there into
[59:56] the seven church ages because in verse
[1:00:06] 12 it says these two olive branches get
[1:00:13] significant other dramas through the two
[1:00:15] golden pipes the earth and the sea SAT
[1:00:21] empty the golden oil out of themselves
[1:00:24] amen amen
[1:00:28] so you see that when a prophet is
[1:00:32] fulfilling his ministry Laurie he's
[1:00:38] pouring out his oil
[1:00:41] he's manifesting Christ that's what our
[1:00:48] lives should be when people look at our
[1:00:52] lives they should see life from it never
[1:00:57] in the American Billa
[1:01:00] hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:01:02] that's in your see their their oil was
[1:01:05] flowing out and it lit up the church
[1:01:07] ages our lives should show the light of
[1:01:14] the church ages if we're burning with
[1:01:20] the oil praise the Lord
[1:01:25] see it's a emptying out of ourselves in
[1:01:30] other words we've got to let the Holy
[1:01:32] Spirit flow out of our lives we can't
[1:01:38] get our flus all clogged up we've got to
[1:01:43] let the Holy Spirit flow we've got to
[1:01:46] believe they meant we've got to trust
[1:01:49] God gotta obey the word we got to shine
[1:01:55] the love of Christ verse 14 he says
[1:02:03] these are the two anointed ones that
[1:02:07] stand by the Lord of the whole earth
[1:02:11] who you standing by today church we want
[1:02:16] to stand by Christ amen praise the Lord
[1:02:21] now just one more point even the days of
[1:02:26] Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Isaiah if you
[1:02:34] look at some of the years they
[1:02:35] ministered there was an overlap of their
[1:02:39] lives in other words you had major
[1:02:44] prophets on the earth at the same time
[1:02:49] they were just ministering in different
[1:02:51] locations I challenge anybody to read
[1:02:56] that in the scripture praise the Lord so
[1:03:01] it's not to exalt ourselves above
[1:03:03] brother Branham but to continue this
[1:03:09] exercise
[1:03:12] dividing the Word of God and the reason
[1:03:21] we do it is to go against that spirit
[1:03:24] that will worship brother Branham only
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ gets worshipped and it
[1:03:35] doesn't stumble a real Christian to say
[1:03:40] we take everything a man says back to
[1:03:42] Christ you'd be surprised how many
[1:03:46] people that stumbles but I ain't gonna
[1:03:51] stumble the bride Church because she's
[1:03:54] not Maren Eleazar she's marrying Christ
[1:03:58] amen I got to bring that out there
[1:04:01] because it's important I want the
[1:04:03] children to see that Zechariah for now
[1:04:05] children can you see that now our lives
[1:04:09] are supposed to let the Holy Spirit flow
[1:04:11] out and that manifests the light of
[1:04:16] Christ for this day yeah I'll just share
[1:04:22] a quick testimony I was a Bible Club and
[1:04:29] the man teaching he stopped the teaching
[1:04:35] of about 60 kids and he walked all the
[1:04:42] way back to where I was in front of all
[1:04:43] the kids he said mr. Smith is a real
[1:04:50] Christian he said I work with men all
[1:04:53] around the world
[1:04:54] I mean country I mean country not the
[1:04:58] world but he said mr. Smith is one of
[1:05:02] the most righteous men of all of them
[1:05:09] and I'm sharing that so you'll see that
[1:05:11] our lives are different than the foolish
[1:05:13] virgin for encima the infant's happens
[1:05:21] if you have two lamps and one's burning
[1:05:24] and one's not
[1:05:25] they won't dump on our you and I sense
[1:05:27] empty they know you ought to see a great
[1:05:29] difference between them your life and my
[1:05:34] life should look so different and it
[1:05:40] manifested everything we do we're
[1:05:45] supposed to keep our word if we promise
[1:05:49] to pay something we pay it we promise to
[1:05:55] pray for somebody we need to pray for
[1:05:56] them if we promise anything we must keep
[1:06:02] our word why because we're a part of the
[1:06:08] word Jesus Christ is the word and he
[1:06:14] keeps his word and if we're a part of
[1:06:19] the word we keep our word I'm sad about
[1:06:25] all the compromising in the world but it
[1:06:32] gives us a chance to be the real
[1:06:34] believer who doesn't compromise
[1:06:39] hallelujah thank the Lord now in the
[1:06:45] parable the foolish only had oil in
[1:06:48] their lamps
[1:06:53] so the foolish only have oil in here but
[1:07:00] the Bible said the wise have extra oil
[1:07:05] in their vessels with their lamps so
[1:07:13] they've got a separate portion separate
[1:07:18] from their lamp
[1:07:19] what can I say like this their human
[1:07:22] spirit see that the the foolish had oil
[1:07:28] in their minds but they didn't have
[1:07:34] extra oil in their soul see
[1:07:39] everything else is the same the flesh is
[1:07:44] the same with the bullish virgin I'm
[1:07:48] talk about your life in my life the
[1:07:51] flesh will be the same between the wise
[1:07:53] and the foolish virgin the sin in your
[1:07:59] flesh will battle you it will grieve you
[1:08:07] what you will feel and the attraction
[1:08:10] towards sin in your flesh you will learn
[1:08:16] to hate it if you don't already
[1:08:18] you ought to and then the mind battles
[1:08:23] the same two because they we both want
[1:08:28] the anointing in our human spirits and a
[1:08:33] foolish virgin can be virgin in her mind
[1:08:41] she can keep out all the idols through
[1:08:47] quoting the words she can cast out every
[1:08:49] temptation and she won't build an idol
[1:08:53] in her life but the difference is is the
[1:09:02] soul of the individual the nature of the
[1:09:07] individual the soul is the nature of the
[1:09:14] Spirit when people die their body stays
[1:09:19] here but that human spirit moves either
[1:09:24] up or down and that human spirit is
[1:09:29] supernatural
[1:09:32] did you know Cain's human spirit soul is
[1:09:35] still alive this morning it's awaiting
[1:09:40] judgment it's waiting for judgement
[1:09:44] that's will not be there with you it's
[1:09:47] in the prison house in hell tonight
[1:09:52] 5,000 years later it's still alive see
[1:09:59] we changed location but our character
[1:10:02] stays the same our nature stays the same
[1:10:07] amen so the only difference between a
[1:10:11] wise and foolish is the nature the
[1:10:19] nature that rules the life with me
[1:10:23] because it's the kingdom the rule of
[1:10:26] heaven so our life will be ruled more by
[1:10:34] the word then forced version if you
[1:10:41] can't see it yet in your life I pray
[1:10:45] you'll see you soon if you don't see it
[1:10:48] enough you probably don't hang around
[1:10:49] enough foolish virgin right because
[1:10:56] we're so busy with our work and then
[1:10:57] church you know I've been around a lot
[1:11:00] of Christians first virgin lately these
[1:11:08] last few years look they got enough
[1:11:12] discernment to stay away from rap today
[1:11:19] let's use music as an example rap yeah
[1:11:27] music rap music well I thought I sent
[1:11:30] them a multi-car up so that they know
[1:11:33] rap music is wrong today but it's okay
[1:11:38] to listen to older music from time to
[1:11:42] time you know like Michael Jackson and
[1:11:45] the Beatles Aretha Franklin see because
[1:11:53] it doesn't bother their nature now when
[1:11:58] they got the noin ting on their minds it
[1:12:00] bothers them
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:08] but that anointing in their mind leaves
[1:12:13] because it's only a temporary anointing
[1:12:17] Goren but the soul anointing is
[1:12:20] permanent and so that's why we hear the
[1:12:28] music but very quickly the nature
[1:12:30] disagrees with it not or anything I mean
[1:12:37] let me say this clearly my flesh is
[1:12:41] guilty of singing along with worldly
[1:12:43] music even after I've been a Christian
[1:12:51] but as soon as it gets down to my soul
[1:12:56] the nature shuts it down yeah sometimes
[1:13:02] I'll catch my foot tap into worldly
[1:13:04] music just because I'm in a restaurant
[1:13:10] but as soon as it starts to try to get
[1:13:13] down into my soul there's a seal there
[1:13:21] there's a defense there it tells it to
[1:13:25] stop and go back to hell amen that's the
[1:13:33] only difference between the wise and the
[1:13:37] foolish see this has been revealed to me
[1:13:42] lately as you meditate upon the word see
[1:13:50] because the soul is the nature we've got
[1:13:55] an extra portion just hang it on kind of
[1:13:59] hang in there on our belt of
[1:14:01] righteousness joy truth melts the truth
[1:14:06] which represents an external anointing
[1:14:09] in the soul hallelujah
[1:14:15] everything else is the same
[1:14:20] use we've seen foolish virgins that have
[1:14:25] power love and sound minds let me say
[1:14:31] this thank God for it I'm all for the
[1:14:37] foolish virgins where they met glory
[1:14:41] sister Wendy I'm all about supporting
[1:14:43] them I'll pray for them because I know
[1:14:46] which side their they're trying to
[1:14:47] fight on they're trying but they're
[1:14:50] turning down the power or resources that
[1:14:53] we're supposed to have amen and so
[1:15:07] because the anointing is temporary in
[1:15:09] the mind the foolish virgin gets tricked
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:20] to wasting time with worldly cares and
[1:15:29] because of that they can't fully focus
[1:15:32] on the Word of God like sports is a
[1:15:38] great example like sports is a great
[1:15:41] like baseball or baseball or football so
[1:15:48] I know foolish virgins that'll watch
[1:15:50] sports but there are times they'll turn
[1:15:57] it off if they have some special
[1:16:01] services so see they can get the victory
[1:16:06] sometimes but many times they waste
[1:16:11] their time with worldly cares and they
[1:16:19] wonder why they can't move on with God
[1:16:25] praise the Lord
[1:16:28] we're moving on with God we're not
[1:16:33] turning back to the world we're not
[1:16:37] picking up worldly habits
[1:16:40] see we're redeeming the time and the key
[1:16:46] to this parable is time because she went
[1:16:52] and prepared the oil beforehand it was
[1:16:57] only preparation that's the only thing
[1:17:00] that separated them one prepared oil
[1:17:05] beforehand the other didn't
[1:17:13] so if you just picture the foolish
[1:17:15] version only had one vessel of oil but
[1:17:21] the wise had to double anointing glory
[1:17:27] hallelujah I'm one of that's what that
[1:17:30] means I just direct me right there
[1:17:32] double anointing got anointing in the
[1:17:36] human mind thank God for it because with
[1:17:41] that anointing I was with that one
[1:17:46] anointing when I was in the dominations
[1:17:49] I was able to cast down beer cigarettes
[1:17:59] cussing swearing using cuss words curses
[1:18:14] dirty movies but still I wasn't born
[1:18:19] again but once born again I was able to
[1:18:27] overcome greater enemies I think the
[1:18:32] greatest enemy I have over overcome my
[1:18:36] enemy go I see
[1:18:38] since becoming a Holy Ghost real
[1:18:39] Christian
[1:18:42] has been complexes because that was
[1:18:46] brother Graham's last battle last
[1:18:51] spiritual battle before he passed away
[1:18:57] he got here to the stomach trouble a
[1:19:02] month before he passed away but his
[1:19:06] greatest spiritual battle before he died
[1:19:10] was complexes hallelujah now I know many
[1:19:19] foolish virgin many and it's sad because
[1:19:23] they Harbor complexes for decades and
[1:19:32] ice I'll just share like this to be
[1:19:34] general I see it my family I'm not talk
[1:19:38] about my message family I'm talking
[1:19:39] about my non message family and I just
[1:19:45] don't want to share the specific
[1:19:46] examples but it's bitterness see that's
[1:19:53] what Satan tries to get in message
[1:19:54] churches roots of bitterness to get one
[1:20:04] person disliked in another mkhaya mejor
[1:20:14] que no attack see cuz he's trying to
[1:20:16] establish the roots the long-term
[1:20:20] victory see Esau had roots of bitterness
[1:20:28] the Bible said that and he couldn't find
[1:20:32] a place to repent see but the good heart
[1:20:38] up roots all that and just keeping the
[1:20:46] heart pure is the great victory and
[1:20:53] that's the sign of the
[1:20:55] why's virgin she keeps her heart and
[1:21:00] mind pure from all the weeds and roots
[1:21:08] of bitterness hallelujah
[1:21:12] a few more symbols here mass now I'm
[1:21:23] gonna pull this up I preached this
[1:21:25] foolish virgin three years ago I'm just
[1:21:31] gonna hit a few highlights in a moment
[1:21:35] so let's get back to the parable the
[1:21:40] bridegroom tarring represents Jesus
[1:21:43] waiting in heaven the midnight cry is
[1:21:52] the Ministry of brother Branham because
[1:21:59] the shout is what wakes both virgins and
[1:22:09] brother Brahim said the bride is
[1:22:11] awakened she's awake amen the mystery of
[1:22:23] the rapture is the shout voice and
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:33] trumpet that's the mystery of it it was
[1:22:38] shared with me recently I agree the
[1:22:44] meeting in the air is not mysterious
[1:22:49] everyone believes there's going to be a
[1:22:51] meeting in the air that's not the
[1:22:56] mysterious part the mysterious part is
[1:23:00] the shout
[1:23:03] right because every denomination can
[1:23:08] know there's a meeting in the air but
[1:23:14] only the children of God can hear the
[1:23:16] shout praise God and recognize it is the
[1:23:22] shout in other words recognize brother
[1:23:27] Rams ministry was the Holy Ghost shout
[1:23:35] that was pointing us to Christ to get
[1:23:40] ready for Jesus that's the mystery the
[1:23:49] voice is the voice of Resurrection for
[1:23:53] the sleeping dead because the dead in
[1:24:00] Christ rise first so everything's on
[1:24:06] time the shouts still going out I heard
[1:24:13] it in 2001 where they met heard it in
[1:24:18] 2014
[1:24:19] amen you you can all say the year you
[1:24:24] heard it praise God the shout is still
[1:24:27] going one of these days it's gonna
[1:24:32] awaken some Saints in Thailand amen
[1:24:35] Simon's going again next month in
[1:24:38] October Simon's going with Ron next
[1:24:41] month back to Thailand I see them $1,000
[1:24:50] first ticket
[1:24:55] we're gonna keep supporting missionaries
[1:24:57] a little more heavy I've had that drop
[1:25:02] in my heart I'm gonna send a quarter of
[1:25:04] our income to missionaries Ganges Eunice
[1:25:14] millions of souls in Thailand have not
[1:25:16] heard the shout so it needs to go out
[1:25:22] praise God amen thank God for the
[1:25:27] shouting saying wake up get ready praise
[1:25:34] God trip your lips lamp trimming member
[1:25:38] is sanctification amen
[1:25:41] the foolish version will be sanctified
[1:25:47] just does it go far enough just not
[1:25:54] enough because Jesus said if you ask
[1:25:58] okay so this I can see two peas you
[1:26:01] receive my recipe if you hunger Ambree
[1:26:07] I'll feed you a lemon
[1:26:10] if you obey everything I'll give you the
[1:26:14] Holy Ghost amen
[1:26:17] see they get so close but so far away
[1:26:25] that's the mystery of the rapture you be
[1:26:30] surprised how many people say the
[1:26:31] raptures already happened we were
[1:26:33] talking about a hint that is a castle I
[1:26:38] mean there are some things going around
[1:26:41] I'm sorry there are some world events
[1:26:46] that look like tribulation but it's not
[1:26:53] the the level of tribulation that we see
[1:26:56] in the book of Revelation and we also
[1:27:03] see people waking up China's waking up
[1:27:10] how do you guard this waking up glory
[1:27:14] well these days Thailand is going to
[1:27:16] wake up virgins are waking up all over
[1:27:23] the world
[1:27:26] the shower is still going out amen god
[1:27:32] help us to keep shouting Amen now
[1:27:36] brother Rams off the scene now it's your
[1:27:39] turn to shout my turn to shout
[1:27:43] hallelujah
[1:27:44] thank the Lord see both kinds wake up
[1:27:50] when they hear the message of the hour
[1:27:55] both remove the carbon from the wick
[1:28:00] nature so they're burning as brightly as
[1:28:03] possible I have some foolish version
[1:28:08] friends they burn pretty bright breanne
[1:28:17] cemente but they won't be able to burn
[1:28:20] as long as the wise virgin praise God
[1:28:32] because they don't have enough oil ooh
[1:28:36] yeah
[1:28:40] the foolish realize they don't have
[1:28:43] enough oil can no tienen sufficient your
[1:28:47] safety and they try to take it from the
[1:28:50] wise but the wise virgins are so humble
[1:29:01] they're honest and they say I can't give
[1:29:05] you the Holy Ghost why do people say
[1:29:09] brother Branham gave them the Holy Ghost
[1:29:12] shows they're not wise virgins because
[1:29:16] no man can give it John the Baptist said
[1:29:20] i baptize you with water but there's one
[1:29:25] coming after me praise the Lord whose
[1:29:29] minor than ally J there
[1:29:32] and he's the one that'll baptize with
[1:29:34] the Holy Ghost ease things up as we go
[1:29:40] along in conversations with people
[1:29:45] oh brother Branham said I'd brother man
[1:29:48] gave me the Holy Ghost or something like
[1:29:50] that John the Baptist can't give the
[1:29:56] Holy Ghost
[1:29:58] well RAM can baptize you in water well
[1:30:01] he could have but he cannot give the
[1:30:05] Holy Ghost the wise virgins prove that
[1:30:12] you've got to go to the one who gives
[1:30:14] the oil the thing was they could have
[1:30:21] done that their whole lives
[1:30:24] mercy it just struck me right there they
[1:30:28] could have been doing this brother bang
[1:30:30] their whole lives but they act like they
[1:30:35] forgot and they must have forgot because
[1:30:36] of the attractions and the cares of the
[1:30:38] world watch your foot on the pedal now
[1:30:42] okay what I mean claim now though so see
[1:30:46] they could have made time to get it but
[1:30:52] they didn't
[1:30:52] not only theorem and so the wise tell
[1:30:55] them go pray up by an hour ah doesn't
[1:31:01] that make a clear Church the foolish
[1:31:09] read revelation 3:18 Jesus says by of me
[1:31:21] go dry in the fire you'll be rich white
[1:31:28] raiment to be clothed and I saw that you
[1:31:35] can see equally upon us all better
[1:31:38] the foolish read the same Bible we do
[1:31:45] but they're more concerned with physical
[1:31:48] transactions rather than spiritual
[1:31:55] transactions like prayer como la nación
[1:32:02] again the foolish virgin didn't repent
[1:32:08] enough they repent enough to get saved
[1:32:14] they didn't pray enough they didn't obey
[1:32:19] enough so they cannot be filled when the
[1:32:30] foolish go to buy oil the door shut and
[1:32:39] that should remind us of Noah's day now
[1:32:46] we know Noah doesn't type the bride but
[1:32:50] this is a Noah condition this day from
[1:32:55] luke 1730 remember as it was the days of
[1:33:00] Noah so shall be in the days of the Son
[1:33:04] of Man so the imagery of the door
[1:33:08] shutting is very fitting for this day
[1:33:17] and just as the believers gathered to
[1:33:21] one location Holy Ghost filled Saints
[1:33:27] are gathering to one location and that's
[1:33:32] gathering to Christ Christ is the word
[1:33:37] and the word is preached at your church
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:42] but we know it's more than just
[1:33:44] physically at a church it's being in
[1:33:50] heavenly places amen in other words the
[1:33:56] spirit
[1:33:57] the condition of a person who's born
[1:34:02] again that's where we're gathered we
[1:34:08] call heavenly places whether I see one
[1:34:13] of you at the the store whether I see
[1:34:16] you at the store whether I see at my
[1:34:21] house or see you here at church we're
[1:34:26] all always get in the same place it's
[1:34:31] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[1:34:36] see we're under the rule or Dominion of
[1:34:40] Christ that is the kingdom of heaven the
[1:34:46] kingdom of heaven is in you hallelujah I
[1:34:51] mean so that's why we can use Noah and
[1:35:00] connected to our day he's both Enoch and
[1:35:04] Noah amen now he concludes the parable
[1:35:13] by saying watch that means give strict
[1:35:19] attention caution now let's let's talk
[1:35:27] about that someone who's born again is
[1:35:33] very cautious about what they decide to
[1:35:34] do they don't make just quick decisions
[1:35:41] they pray about it to make sure it's
[1:35:46] Father's will because they're watching
[1:35:51] they don't want anything to distract
[1:35:53] them from the coming ride guru so the
[1:35:58] rapture requires your full attention we
[1:36:05] must be actively working in his kingdom
[1:36:11] the Greek also says the Greek language
[1:36:16] also says we must take heed that we
[1:36:25] don't fall into remission and
[1:36:30] slothfulness and slothful laziness Oh
[1:36:36] and then suddenly overtaken like the
[1:36:42] foolish como los ins and Santos so
[1:36:45] watching Londo means we're always active
[1:36:50] at the post of duty praise the Lord now
[1:37:00] here's the Greek meanings of wise and
[1:37:02] foolish wise means you're intelligent
[1:37:12] foolish just means impious now godless
[1:37:19] there means without the seal the holy
[1:37:23] ghost because God is the seal now
[1:37:31] there's a Greek meanings of version I
[1:37:32] kind of got over that there's no
[1:37:33] idolatry totally chaste towards Christ
[1:37:46] okay so I just want to say this I'm
[1:37:48] sorry the I should have used a different
[1:37:50] font but it says you can be free from
[1:37:53] idols and cleaned out without being
[1:38:01] filled it just came to me Matthew 12
[1:38:06] Jesus said there's your euro you are a
[1:38:08] house Jesus says and as a sinner you're
[1:38:13] full of demons but you got to have the
[1:38:19] strong hand of faith and drive out the
[1:38:24] demons
[1:38:26] but then the house is cleaned out but
[1:38:30] it's still not filled Laurie there it is
[1:38:33] right there beautiful picture the
[1:38:35] foolish virgin gets all the demons out
[1:38:41] doesn't let Christ come in fully right
[1:38:47] fully beautiful picture so as we'll see
[1:38:51] the foolish did not put the time into it
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:39:00] because in the parable the oil had to be
[1:39:03] prepared ahead of time and now's our
[1:39:08] time to prepare it amen now like I said
[1:39:14] I'm going to skip ahead here yeah I want
[1:39:19] to read this I read this three years ago
[1:39:21] but I'm sure we've all forgot it Matthew
[1:39:23] Henry said this the foolish virgin do
[1:39:33] not have time to get the Holy Ghost when
[1:39:43] the bridegroom is coming see getting
[1:39:47] grace are receiving the Holy Ghost is a
[1:39:50] work of time you can't do it in a hurry
[1:39:56] we've all seen it my back these last
[1:40:00] five years I've seen more people that I
[1:40:04] thought had the Holy Ghost turn around
[1:40:09] and leave the truth proven they didn't
[1:40:13] have it buh-bam says in one quote he
[1:40:22] said unless God reveals it there's no
[1:40:26] way to know who has it really
[1:40:29] less God will reveal to you
[1:40:34] Saints I'm find that to be the reality
[1:40:39] I think people have it hope they think I
[1:40:43] have it with our lives prove it our
[1:40:49] obedience proves it
[1:40:52] our prayer life proves it our hunger
[1:40:57] proves it our thirst proves it amen
[1:41:03] hallelujah see it it takes time to be
[1:41:09] born again how many mothers kid that
[1:41:13] I've had a baby could say amen to that
[1:41:15] it takes time to have a birth takes time
[1:41:23] can do in a hurry you're doing a hurry
[1:41:26] there's gonna be a lot of pain that I
[1:41:29] know try to push that baby out before
[1:41:33] time it's gonna be a lot of pain we can
[1:41:38] damage the baby and the mother I know
[1:41:42] what I'm talking about
[1:41:44] I've got seven got a witness see there
[1:41:53] to mouth of two witnesses you talk to
[1:41:57] any doctor trying to hurry the fourth
[1:42:00] the birth always a damaging thing you
[1:42:06] gotta let nature take its course amen
[1:42:09] you gotta let God have his way we gotta
[1:42:16] let God's three works of grace take
[1:42:20] their course amen praise God I just want
[1:42:26] to share a few things here now
[1:42:30] concerning our gifts now the reason I
[1:42:32] have preached on gifts the reason I
[1:42:33] didn't teach on gifts the new name look
[1:42:38] Naomi wouldn't be here and she's a
[1:42:43] pillar in the church just like all of
[1:42:46] our members then it turned out you know
[1:42:50] Karen was sick so is a vindication you
[1:42:52] know
[1:42:52] misuk and my wife can't be here so I
[1:43:00] feel vindicated on holding off but look
[1:43:04] what my mom says he said oh my can't
[1:43:09] they see that the sleeping Church they
[1:43:16] let the oil go out of their lamp now
[1:43:21] really they just didn't take the oil but
[1:43:25] you understand
[1:43:26] they never entered into this they never
[1:43:31] let Christ here it is
[1:43:33] take control so he could work miracles
[1:43:42] and speak with tongues and do wonders
[1:43:47] and things to prove that he lived in his
[1:43:50] church a see giving him full control
[1:44:00] given all your time all your efforts
[1:44:10] watching giving strict attention to see
[1:44:17] that that's the connection to gifts so
[1:44:21] you can't have you know if you have the
[1:44:23] giver you have the gifts praise God
[1:44:29] very confident in that now some of these
[1:44:36] were very familiar with yeah some of
[1:44:42] these I've already gone over yeah now
[1:44:47] just just so you know a few years ago
[1:44:52] someone approached me that was a part of
[1:44:56] our church at that time and we're sure
[1:45:01] the foolish virgins weren't saved
[1:45:07] in San Saba Salva and there are two
[1:45:12] quotes that say that but the majority of
[1:45:18] them say they are saved the majority say
[1:45:24] they are saved so let me go through a
[1:45:27] few of those the five foolish virgins
[1:45:35] were not lost 1961 no they were not lost
[1:45:52] there to be judged according to the way
[1:45:55] they treated the light but they were not
[1:46:04] lost the sleeping virgin will be saved
[1:46:11] of course she'll be saved at the
[1:46:16] judgment she is the same group of people
[1:46:24] they are to be saved
[1:46:27] there'll be the sheep on his right side
[1:46:33] yeah we remember this I just want to go
[1:46:35] over him again the sleeping version
[1:46:37] comes up purged and has white robes on
[1:46:48] she'd been purged and given white robes
[1:46:56] she's not the bride but it's a pure
[1:47:01] people the house is cleaned out just not
[1:47:08] filled our lives should be so different
[1:47:12] because he's in the house amen rise to
[1:47:16] that song amen
[1:47:17] when he's in the house death has to flee
[1:47:20] a man dead works amen
[1:47:25] that habits that conflicts dead
[1:47:33] complexes amen
[1:47:35] it has to flee because life is in the
[1:47:39] house amen
[1:47:44] they're really sincere in heart
[1:47:47] God knows their heart there was a virgin
[1:47:54] but didn't have any oil the virgin Rises
[1:48:00] you know in the last day at the White
[1:48:05] Throne but not the bride
[1:48:09] 1964 now
[1:48:20] the sleeping virgin he says is not to be
[1:48:26] saved during that time now he means
[1:48:30] saved from the destruction of the
[1:48:32] tribulation she's already been saved see
[1:48:42] see those those people in the
[1:48:44] evangelical churches they're saved it's
[1:48:49] a small group just like the bride but
[1:48:54] she saved but she's been rejected in the
[1:48:57] bride goes to the tribulation period for
[1:49:05] purification because she rejected Christ
[1:49:09] the word does that help my this helps me
[1:49:13] tremendously
[1:49:14] because I have so many friends that
[1:49:16] accept accept the truth but not the full
[1:49:20] revelation
[1:49:26] they believe in Jesus but not the seven
[1:49:30] seals Amen or the seven church age is
[1:49:34] Amen or serpent seed or marriage in
[1:49:37] divorce
[1:49:39] they can accept the cross and the power
[1:49:43] to clean out their house but they can't
[1:49:47] write the let the rest of the word come
[1:49:49] in for purification the first version is
[1:49:58] saved now see here from eternal death
[1:50:06] now so we'll look at tonight I'm trying
[1:50:08] to close here tonight I want to preach
[1:50:12] on hell's not eternal meditating it on
[1:50:19] meditating on it this week writing a
[1:50:23] youtube script whole field
[1:50:27] yeah and hoping I'll record it this week
[1:50:29] but look the bush version saved from the
[1:50:34] second death but goes to the tribulation
[1:50:43] now people even say today and misquote
[1:50:49] brother Branham and say there's no
[1:50:54] salvation for the foolish version that
[1:50:59] doesn't line up with the quotes or the
[1:51:02] Bible most importantly the Bible because
[1:51:09] she saved she comes up at the white
[1:51:12] throne judgment let's just read it one
[1:51:16] more time Matthew 25 in the sheep and
[1:51:20] the goats
[1:51:23] look how Jesus addresses the foolish
[1:51:26] virgin
[1:51:38] verse 34 then shall the King say unto
[1:51:42] them on his right hand
[1:51:48] yeah I'm sorry 2530 for my fault brother
[1:51:51] forgive me dear ah I love this other
[1:51:55] nature beneath Bandito demi padre de el
[1:51:59] rey no preparado para nosotros did they
[1:52:01] love from the sandal mundo thank you I
[1:52:03] know you were the whole thing good
[1:52:04] he said come he blessed are the foolish
[1:52:07] virgin curse no they're blessed of the
[1:52:13] father and inherit the kingdom prepared
[1:52:19] for you from the foundation of the world
[1:52:24] amen this is after the Millennium
[1:52:29] so what kingdom are they get inherit the
[1:52:34] kingdom outside the city right that's
[1:52:41] right because the bride will not leave
[1:52:44] the husband and shall live in the new
[1:52:49] city that's a reward Amen for faithful
[1:52:56] watching hallelujah 434 oh babe rain
[1:53:06] falling it over Jesus amen that's a
[1:53:10] reward she'll never leave aside amen
[1:53:15] hallelujah but the foolish is blessed
[1:53:20] lot was blessed with salvation
[1:53:25] no was blessed saw was blessed and the
[1:53:36] foolish virgin will be blessed here
[1:53:40] the two misunderstood quotes now in the
[1:53:45] first quote later on he says that the
[1:53:53] nominal believers are saved by fire so
[1:54:00] let's look at the first quote he said
[1:54:05] after the bride is raptured well any of
[1:54:09] the foolish virgin be saved yeah well
[1:54:14] I'm sorry well any of the foolish virgin
[1:54:16] be saved he says no no that's a lot of
[1:54:28] reading he says it again will the first
[1:54:32] version be saved no because he says
[1:54:42] there in the state of revelation 22 11
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:48] we are the holy that are holy still but
[1:54:55] lot was called a righteous man and he
[1:54:59] that's righteous is righteous still now
[1:55:07] here's where he says the nominal
[1:55:08] churches are hungry for the baptism of
[1:55:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:55:23] the nominal believers like lot he's
[1:55:28] going through the tribulation period and
[1:55:31] be saved as it were by fire the church
[1:55:41] lukewarm anything outside the bride will
[1:55:51] go through the tribulation period and
[1:55:56] then he quotes Matthew 25 about the
[1:56:01] foolish virgin like sheep call me
[1:56:06] blessed of my father and there's one
[1:56:12] quote that's the quote this
[1:56:13] misunderstood but heavy as you keep
[1:56:15] reading it he said the nominal saved by
[1:56:17] fire so the revelation is this the
[1:56:27] foolish version are saved eternally but
[1:56:33] not saved from the wrath of the
[1:56:35] tribulation that's what it means and
[1:56:40] people misunderstand those quotes which
[1:56:42] it's understandable if you don't pray
[1:56:49] enough and study enough here's the quote
[1:56:55] about the first version taking the mark
[1:56:57] of the beast and we had a man just come
[1:57:05] in a few years ago and he preached that
[1:57:10] the first version take the mark of the
[1:57:12] beast
[1:57:14] and it got real quiet that was proud of
[1:57:20] your church not saying Amen on that
[1:57:24] because the first versions eternally
[1:57:26] saved the Bible says so but see they
[1:57:32] take one quote and then the other
[1:57:36] we just saw and either brother branham
[1:57:41] misquoted or he forgot what he taught
[1:57:47] and so that event just majored on this
[1:57:50] quote so you have to balance out all the
[1:57:58] quotes and line it up with the word so
[1:58:04] 1961 when the sleeping virgin went out
[1:58:10] which already received the mark of the
[1:58:12] beast you say mark of the beast yes
[1:58:18] indeedy
[1:58:20] so the game received the mark and went
[1:58:23] out I see it goes talking about
[1:58:26] Jezebel's and things like that so this
[1:58:33] quote needs to take him back to the word
[1:58:38] foolish virgin are saved the Bible said
[1:58:43] anyone that takes the mark your name was
[1:58:47] never on that I'm sorry your name is
[1:58:48] blotted off the book of life that's in
[1:58:53] the book of Revelation so see maybe had
[1:58:56] a slip of the mind or the tongue but the
[1:59:03] word says she saved
[1:59:07] yeah that's the revelation that I've
[1:59:10] come to the bush virgin is eternally
[1:59:12] saved but not saved from the tribulation
[1:59:19] period stay on our feet here
[1:59:30] well Ram said there's a few foolish
[1:59:33] virgin saved there are three Church age
[1:59:43] book quotes about the foolish virgin and
[1:59:51] everyone she saved let's look at this
[1:59:58] one he said that's when the lukewarm
[2:00:06] Church and the five foolish virgins will
[2:00:07] appear he will separate the sheep from
[2:00:15] the goats now let's skip down he talks
[2:00:20] about his bride comes the minister to
[2:00:21] him look at the urgency it is now or
[2:00:30] never repent before it's too late
[2:00:36] wake up from amongst the dead and seek
[2:00:41] God to be filled with the spirit or
[2:00:47] you'll miss eternal life do it now while
[2:00:50] theirs what do it now well there's time
[2:01:02] let me close with one more
[2:01:04] more quote things that are to be 1965
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:14] and I just have it here let me type it
[2:01:17] in this is the beauty of free more
[2:01:21] agency okay programs talking about how
[2:01:32] the word was believed by Mary in her
[2:01:35] heart just heard us yesterday look at
[2:01:47] this we know Jesus has gone to prepare
[2:01:50] place to receive a people unto himself
[2:01:56] look how humble he is who those people
[2:01:59] are
[2:02:00] I hope it's we are part of those people
[2:02:06] tonight if it isn't my friend now I'm
[2:02:13] gonna inject something wrong here let's
[2:02:17] give up and not and not try to be bribed
[2:02:19] is that what he said sbobet I'm saying
[2:02:25] if you're not yet born again God has
[2:02:32] made a way a condition that you can be
[2:02:38] included in that
[2:02:40] sorry if you want to
[2:02:45] you're on free moral agency idea you can
[2:02:54] act the way you wish to but now notice
[2:03:00] in this world that is to come there is a
[2:03:05] world to come so what I want to say God
[2:03:13] will give you the desires of your heart
[2:03:14] what do you wish what are you wishing
[2:03:16] for right now
[2:03:20] God will give you whatever you wish for
[2:03:23] let me believe that Psalms 37:4 says
[2:03:31] delight yourself in the Lord and he'll
[2:03:37] give you the desires of your heart
[2:03:41] the reason the bride will go in the
[2:03:46] rapture is because she wants to Amen
[2:03:51] it's her choice Amen God's not gonna
[2:03:55] force anybody to go there
[2:04:00] the reason the foolish don't go because
[2:04:06] they didn't want to the beauty is God
[2:04:10] made away for everybody to come to the
[2:04:17] wedding supper Amen
[2:04:22] see we got to be careful not to go too
[2:04:25] far on predestination and election is if
[2:04:34] we major too much on that say we'll say
[2:04:38] look at your faults you might as well
[2:04:42] not even try you weren't ordained to the
[2:04:48] rapture that liar he's always telling
[2:04:53] lies and now make people give up I guess
[2:05:00] I'm not the bride and they'll get so
[2:05:04] discouraged but the reality is every
[2:05:10] Christians backslides
[2:05:13] even Holy Ghost fill Christians but the
[2:05:19] Holy Ghost filled Christian wish is to
[2:05:23] go in the rapture
[2:05:26] desires ago in the rapture so she'll
[2:05:30] devote all her time to making sure she's
[2:05:35] ready amen because God gave her that
[2:05:40] choice see how we got to be right down
[2:05:44] the middle
[2:05:46] it's your choice balance with God's
[2:05:52] foreknowledge but if you want to go you
[2:06:00] can go because Jesus said whosoever will
[2:06:05] let him come and drink of the waters of
[2:06:09] life beautiful isn't it
[2:06:13] musicians come oh yeah to me that's the
[2:06:20] beauty of that parable the lies prepared
[2:06:28] devote an extra time but the foolish
[2:06:33] didn't praise the Lord Lydia stop the
[2:06:43] life here I mean I'm just gonna announce
[2:06:44] a few things now yeah the Lord bless all
[2:06:46] the lies dreamers loving the Lord
