[31:20] so second peter chapter one
[31:29] i think by god's grace we're looking
[31:34] i'll be looking more at just the three
[31:35] works of grace tonight lord willing and
[31:37] continuing on some of the uh
[31:42] other scriptures i mentioned this
[31:43] morning i'm getting close to the end of
[31:46] this chapter i'm preaching through the
[31:47] chapter
[31:49] and uh i hope this has been a blessing
[31:51] to you praise god
[31:52] i know i've really enjoyed it i love
[31:54] going back over these things and
[31:56] i'm sure your testimony is the same the
[31:58] longer you serve god
[31:59] the more you're convinced that we
[32:00] believe the truth and that is that has
[32:02] been my testimony that's been my song
[32:06] that's been my experience with god that
[32:09] the the longer i serve christ the more
[32:11] his word is proven true to me so let's
[32:14] read the
[32:16] let's read verse 8.
[32:21] yeah let's read 8
[32:24] and 9 and then i'll just read 10 myself
[32:26] so let's read eight and nine together
[32:29] because we're kind of looking at more of
[32:30] the uh just the the principles of the
[32:33] statute of perfect man here tonight but
[32:34] let's read eight and nine together
[32:36] one two three for if these things be
[32:39] in you and abound they make you that ye
[32:43] shall neither be
[32:44] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[32:47] of our lord jesus christ
[32:50] but he that lacketh these things is
[32:52] blind
[32:53] and cannot see afar off and hath
[32:56] forgotten that he was
[32:57] purged from his old sins now i'll read
[33:00] verse 10
[33:01] wherefore the rather brethren give
[33:03] diligence to make your calling and
[33:05] election sure
[33:06] for if you do these things you shall
[33:09] never
[33:10] fall how many want to fulfill that one
[33:13] if i do all these things i'll never fall
[33:15] i'll have little stumbles but i'll never
[33:17] fall away from salvation
[33:19] i'll never be lost i'll be saved by
[33:21] god's grace let's pray let's bow our
[33:23] heads for word of prayer

[33:51] lord bless your people
[33:52] as we look to your word strengthen us
[33:55] god
[33:55] for the journey ahead and minister to us
[33:57] tonight each and every soul
[33:59] in jesus christ's name the church said
[34:01] amen god bless you being seated praise
[34:03] god i'll try to set a timer here
[34:08] i want to read a few things uh i didn't
[34:10] get to this morning so in case you can
[34:12] or switch over to my phone
[34:23] so i want to just read a few quotes i
[34:24] didn't get to this morning i think
[34:26] they'll be a blessing
[34:30] i just want to uh share a few things and
[34:33] make some comments about it
[34:35] um some various quotes brother branham
[34:37] made
[34:39] in this one uh brother branham is
[34:42] speaking here in arizona
[34:44] and i'll just read it there's two
[34:45] systems at work just as there was jacob
[34:47] and esau
[34:48] one after the spirit went after the
[34:50] flesh what was it esau and jacob was
[34:51] fighting in the wombs of the mother
[34:53] even to the time they were born and so
[34:55] is the denominationals and the word
[34:57] fighting one against the other and we're
[34:59] not fighting the people right
[35:01] we're fighting their false doctrine
[35:03] right
[35:04] they had been since luther first brought
[35:06] the first reformation
[35:08] i hope that's simple enough you can
[35:09] understand it see these men
[35:12] if they pick up this and goes out with
[35:14] it they can make more sense to it see
[35:16] to bring it to a place you would i just
[35:19] want to lay this seed
[35:20] then hope they make it come to life
[35:24] so brother branham realizes he's in a
[35:26] uneducated
[35:27] spot right and if you listen to i shared
[35:30] that testimony with uh
[35:31] i didn't share with you i shared with uh
[35:34] brother stephen
[35:34] brother perry green says brother branham
[35:36] told him he said i wish
[35:38] they wouldn't put out my sermons with
[35:41] all the dot dot dots and all
[35:43] he said i wish they would edit all my
[35:44] sermons he said that's
[35:46] his testimony because he doesn't want to
[35:48] look like he has no brain that's what
[35:49] brother branham told perry green
[35:51] now that's not on tape but that's what
[35:52] peregrine's testimony
[35:54] so in other words brother brahm realized
[35:57] he was limited in his
[35:59] his education his ability um so he was
[36:02] hoping
[36:03] that men would come and find the message
[36:05] right find these revelations and then
[36:07] um put some grammar to him right
[36:10] and uh clean it up a little bit you know
[36:13] and just
[36:14] shorten it right and summarize it and i
[36:17] say synthesize it maybe
[36:19] um and so i just want to bring this out
[36:22] that
[36:22] uh that's what i felt like i did with my
[36:24] book and that's why i feel like the
[36:25] church age book is the same thing right
[36:27] it's
[36:27] it's these revelations but they're kind
[36:29] of just grammarized
[36:31] and they're kind of just packed in a
[36:32] little tighter uh by god's grace without
[36:35] you know stories and
[36:36] like me i say by god's grace a hundred
[36:38] times in a sermon
[36:40] right like brother jim he always makes
[36:41] that he always says
[36:44] is that by god's grace brother jesse and
[36:46] i'm like yeah he says i say that all the
[36:48] time by god's grace
[36:50] because you say it all the time i'm kind
[36:53] of rubbing off on him man
[36:54] i hope that's a good thing but i always
[36:56] say by god's grace
[36:58] but anyways i just wanted i don't know
[36:59] if amen had ever seen this so i wanted
[37:01] to bring this out and children too that
[37:02] there's nothing wrong with you know uh
[37:05] taking what brother mahm said and then
[37:07] packaging it you know
[37:08] in a in a different a set like you know
[37:11] what i mean just
[37:12] in other words writing a book about
[37:13] brother ham's teachings there's nothing
[37:14] wrong with that
[37:15] like he was hoping these brothers could
[37:18] do it
[37:19] you know he's talking about jacob and
[37:20] esau he's talking about the promised
[37:22] seed versus denomination and
[37:24] he just wished somebody could bundle
[37:26] that up and and present it in a way that
[37:28] more people could receive it
[37:30] and so that's what he said he said that
[37:32] now i know brothers have taken this
[37:33] quote and they've totally twisted it
[37:36] and they brought their own false
[37:37] doctrines like polygamy right
[37:39] like perugia like we don't need no holy
[37:41] spirit we don't need to shout and pray
[37:43] and fast and they say
[37:44] he's already here we don't need that and
[37:46] that's nonsense
[37:48] uh and then the seven thunders movement
[37:50] right
[37:51] um you know the seven thunders movement
[37:53] made that
[37:55] uh they made that the seven thunders
[37:57] instead of what brother bam said it was
[37:58] brother man said it was the revelation
[37:59] of the seven seals
[38:00] well the seven thunders movement made
[38:02] faith a thunder
[38:04] and it made all those things thunders
[38:07] and they they basically tried to predict
[38:08] the rapture by the by the time when
[38:10] their founder would preach those
[38:12] that's what they were trying to do uh
[38:15] and they were saying you know our age is
[38:16] broadly kindness so we really need
[38:17] brotherly kindness and
[38:19] they were trying to predict the rapture
[38:20] through those um
[38:22] so you know we have to balance this
[38:23] quote out and not take it too far
[38:25] but i wanted to show that to you that
[38:27] brother branham realized this
[38:29] he was laying the seed and then he was
[38:31] hoping the brothers
[38:32] after him uh could make more sense in
[38:36] other words
[38:37] put a little grammar to it okay now
[38:40] things that are to be brother ram says
[38:42] this is one you're familiar with
[38:44] i'm very thankful for these open doors
[38:45] that i had to go into the inspiration
[38:47] it's given to young men like your pastor
[38:49] here
[38:49] that's caused them as i'm beginning to
[38:51] get old and know that my days are
[38:52] numbered and know that these
[38:54] young men can take this message and
[38:56] sweep it on to the coming of the lord
[38:58] if he doesn't come in my generation
[39:02] which i'm hoping to see him i look daily
[39:04] for my watch
[39:05] keeping myself prepared for that hour
[39:09] see so uh just another encouraging quote
[39:13] there that
[39:13] that brother branham was looking he
[39:15] realized i may not live to see him
[39:17] but i'm trusting that the brothers after
[39:18] me will be able to take the same message
[39:21] right and and bring it to the people uh
[39:23] and preach god's word
[39:25] and stay with it to get the people ready
[39:27] for the coming of the lord
[39:30] now here's one i want to share too the
[39:32] teacher but so
[39:33] my ministry's in teaching i believe so
[39:35] brother man says teaching is a special
[39:36] man
[39:37] he sits back under the anointing of the
[39:38] spirit and is able to take the words and
[39:40] put them together
[39:41] by the holy spirit that the pastor
[39:43] evangelists either one could not compare
[39:44] with him
[39:45] and then we find out the apostle's a
[39:47] special man he's a setter in order
[39:49] he's a man that's sent from god to set
[39:51] the things in order
[39:53] so i just want to make sure i say that
[39:54] you know there's people that don't
[39:56] believe in teaching they say oh
[39:57] all we need is preaching we don't need
[39:59] teaching and i admit there's been many
[40:01] false teachers come through the message
[40:03] no doubt about it
[40:04] but there's there has to be special men
[40:05] out there that can sit back
[40:07] under the anointing and bring out the
[40:09] scriptures and put them together that it
[40:11] brings victory to people
[40:13] there has to be somebody out there that
[40:15] has to do that i think the church has
[40:16] been preached now look at this quote
[40:18] look at this
[40:19] how come we never hear this one right
[40:21] you know i've never heard this one
[40:23] preached i think the church has been
[40:25] preached to death
[40:28] the thing it needs now is to come back
[40:30] to teaching
[40:32] and get in on the foundation so you'll
[40:34] know how to build yourself
[40:36] up in christ amen
[40:39] now church just to be fair there are
[40:41] quotes on the other side that say we
[40:42] have too much teaching
[40:45] right see so see brother brown would
[40:47] look at different churches he looked at
[40:48] different situations some needed more
[40:50] teaching some needed more
[40:52] preaching praise god some needed revival
[40:55] some needed correction
[40:56] you know so we got to be careful to
[40:59] balance out all the quotes with the word
[41:00] of god
[41:01] praise god so uh
[41:04] i just want to bring some of these out
[41:06] just to kind of uh share with you
[41:10] now bro man says teaching's a little
[41:11] treacherous because i've been teaching
[41:13] on that's what um the book is about it's
[41:15] about teaching the word of god
[41:17] the mysteries of god
[41:20] he says uh yeah so he said i want to
[41:23] preach at this time
[41:24] i think of a complete understanding
[41:26] positioning of what we are in christ
[41:28] jesus yeah he's preaching adoption now
[41:30] sometimes i think preaching is a
[41:31] wonderful thing but i believe sometimes
[41:33] brother be that teaching goes beyond
[41:36] that especially to the church
[41:37] so again brother brahms emphasizing just
[41:39] preaching like speak god's word and
[41:41] all these that's all good things that's
[41:43] all we all need that but he said
[41:45] teaching he says uh goes beyond that
[41:48] the preaching catches the sinner brings
[41:50] him under condemnation by the word
[41:52] but teaching places a man positionally
[41:54] what he is
[41:55] and we can never rightly be able to have
[41:57] faith until positionally
[41:59] we know what we are praise god
[42:03] so it's good to just preach that
[42:05] preaching you know supposed to convict
[42:07] us of sin
[42:08] but teaching is supposed to show you how
[42:10] to grow closer to christ
[42:11] amen amen so see there is a
[42:15] special place for teaching and uh each
[42:18] one you know teacher
[42:19] teacher pastor evangelist all those
[42:21] things uh
[42:23] and so i believe that my testimonies i
[42:24] believe i have multiple gifts i
[42:26] believe i have a gift to pastor i
[42:28] believe i have a gift to evangelize
[42:30] uh at times to teach as well
[42:34] i know my main focus is pastoring but if
[42:36] paul could be a prophet
[42:38] apostle pastor teacher to the gentiles
[42:41] if he can have multiple gifts we can
[42:43] have multiple gifts as well
[42:45] brother braham no doubt had all five
[42:46] gifts we can see it clearly in his life
[42:49] now next
[42:54] now here's one thing i want to add too
[42:56] with the stature perfect man or any
[42:58] mystery we have to be careful not to put
[43:00] a period
[43:00] in other words we can't be dogmatic and
[43:03] organized
[43:04] and become a denomination that's why a
[43:06] lot of people
[43:07] left the message and they follow believe
[43:09] the sign or these other guys
[43:10] because some of the churches they went
[43:12] to have denominated
[43:14] in fact some of their testimonies the
[43:16] reason they left the churches was
[43:17] because the leaders
[43:18] allowed sin to happen like child abuse
[43:21] in the churches
[43:22] and they didn't report it see they are
[43:24] so denominated
[43:26] that they allow sin to come into the
[43:28] church now that's wicked that's from
[43:29] hell
[43:30] right so see we have to be very careful
[43:34] just because our message is greater than
[43:36] denomination doesn't mean
[43:37] that we should denominate but brother
[43:39] adam says always be open to more
[43:41] revelation
[43:42] praise god amen now the original the
[43:44] revelation the new revelation we get
[43:46] won't take away
[43:47] from what we've already heard it will
[43:48] only add more to it
[43:51] okay but sincerely men do receive god
[43:53] and believe him if they would just
[43:55] then they pull themselves off saying
[43:56] that we got this and that's all there is
[43:58] to it
[43:59] see i never want to say there uh i have
[44:01] every revelation on the godhead i don't
[44:03] ever want to say that
[44:04] i have every revelation on the stretch
[44:06] perfect man right every revelation on
[44:08] the baptism holy ghost i never want to
[44:09] say that
[44:11] he says because that's when you
[44:12] denominate they separate themselves they
[44:13] won't take no new revelation they
[44:15] organize it this is it
[44:16] this is our doctrine end with the period
[44:20] he says if you'd have a denomination
[44:22] that'll end up and your doctrine with a
[44:24] comma
[44:25] we believe this plus as much as god will
[44:27] show us
[44:28] then that's all right i'll go for that
[44:31] but never with the period
[44:32] because god is god and time is moving on
[44:36] amen hallelujah see we got to be open to
[44:39] that
[44:40] now like i said a new revelation will
[44:43] never take away
[44:44] from previous revelation now let me say
[44:46] this a new revelation may correct some
[44:48] of your wrong thinking yeah
[44:50] yes right that's that's the kind of
[44:52] revelation i want
[44:54] new revelation oh my it's unveiled to me
[44:56] oh i realized where i had it wrong about
[44:58] the latter rain right we were talking
[44:59] about that
[45:00] i realized i may have it wrong about the
[45:02] rapture i may have this room thank god
[45:03] for revelation
[45:05] amen but see church automatically if we
[45:07] put a period
[45:08] and we think we got everything we got
[45:09] the wrong spirit already
[45:11] and that's when a lot of messed churches
[45:13] happen but the ram says
[45:15] how many know the church age but you
[45:16] cannot escape the cycle of revival and
[45:18] death how do you know what i'm talking
[45:19] about
[45:20] the ephesian church age he said you've
[45:21] left your first love brother said that
[45:23] this cycle never fails you start hot but
[45:26] then you got you go
[45:27] lukewarm and he says if not if you're
[45:30] not careful you'll go lukewarm
[45:32] and then you'll die and that's what
[45:33] happens every denomination
[45:35] now church the same things happen in the
[45:36] message praise god
[45:38] we have to but we have to keep ourselves
[45:40] when we hit that bachelor slim spot we
[45:42] got to come back to our first
[45:43] love amen we have to reverse the curse
[45:46] right we have to
[45:47] reverse the cycle how many believe that
[45:49] amen
[45:50] if you've been serving god long enough
[45:52] you know that's right you've got to get
[45:54] back to your first love which is doing
[45:55] your first works
[45:57] if not you'll denominate in your walk
[45:59] with the lord
[46:01] and you'll go into spiritual death and
[46:02] nobody can correct you see
[46:04] oh i'm just separating to myself i've
[46:06] got i know everything about it
[46:08] that's the wrong spirit it has to be the
[46:10] right spirit
[46:12] okay now that's the quotes i want to
[46:13] show there i'm going to pop another one
[46:15] here
[46:22] okay i want to leave that up there just
[46:23] for a little bit because now i want to
[46:25] go through here now
[46:26] got your bibles ready my children you
[46:27] got your bibles right anybody else want
[46:29] to read
[46:31] anybody got their bibles ready let's go
[46:33] through a few scriptures
[46:34] now since i'm i kind of in the book i
[46:37] kind of went on charity
[46:38] and then i i saved charity for the next
[46:40] the next chapter was christ in you the
[46:42] hope of glory so i saved most of the
[46:43] teaching on that for later
[46:45] um oh yeah i had a real quick question
[46:47] i'm gonna ask you a question
[46:49] um it's not gonna offend me if you say
[46:50] no
[46:52] okay does anybody want to go through all
[46:54] those scriptures that i showed
[46:56] earlier this morning about how god is
[46:59] love god is spirit raise your hand does
[47:01] anybody want me to go through those
[47:03] anybody okay i appreciate it okay yeah
[47:06] we can go through yeah that's fine
[47:07] i know the children need them too so i
[47:11] want to give that an opportunity
[47:13] uh to go through those but i got as you
[47:15] can see i got seven other things i like
[47:16] to preach on tonight so
[47:19] i got this chapter
[47:24] is over 60 pages single spaced
[47:27] it's 63 pages long his brother johnny
[47:29] once you start getting the word it just
[47:31] starts opening up
[47:32] brother branham was right brother and
[47:33] you know this i'm not calling you out or
[47:35] anything
[47:36] you know but ram said when you get the
[47:38] revelation it ties the whole bible
[47:40] together
[47:41] church i am an absolute witness of that
[47:43] when god
[47:45] took those seals off the whole bible
[47:47] fits together now
[47:49] you could you just preach forever
[47:52] and i don't want to do that tonight and
[47:55] it set the timer so let me set the timer
[47:57] 30 more minutes okay three more minutes
[47:59] all right so yeah let's go back i
[48:00] appreciate that
[48:00] if anyone needs to go through those i
[48:02] want to go through those
[48:04] um and you can see it it's beautiful i
[48:06] think it's just a
[48:07] i just came up with that this morning i
[48:09] should say i came up with it the holy
[48:10] spirit came up with it yeah here's what
[48:11] i was talking about
[48:14] now this is so beautiful to me because
[48:17] it takes away all the guests work out of
[48:19] it
[48:20] well is love the same as the holy ghost
[48:22] is the new birth the same as all this
[48:24] it's all the same thing praise god
[48:26] because if you put these scriptures
[48:27] together they're not multiple things
[48:28] they're the same thing
[48:30] all right so uh children get your bibles
[48:32] ready i'm calling on my oldest lydia
[48:35] you're always the first one first john 4

[49:02] is love he is love one of the brothers
[49:06] said that recently i can't remember who
[49:07] it was
[49:08] something along those lines so see god
[49:10] is love
[49:11] now god is loving but and he's kind and
[49:14] he loves us but he actually is
[49:16] the spirit of love okay maokai first

[49:59] now you and i we fail but god never
[50:02] fails
[50:03] this has to be charity has to be
[50:05] speaking of god because god is love
[50:08] see it has to be another good one oh
[50:09] yeah this is a good one too verse six
[50:12] charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[50:15] rejoices
[50:16] in the truth and what did jesus say the
[50:18] holy spirit is the spirit of
[50:20] truth amen see the holy spirit will
[50:23] always be happy in truth it always
[50:25] anoint you
[50:26] to do what's true praise god amen glory
[50:32] all right keisha john 4 24.
[50:40] amen god is a spirit a
[50:43] spirit so god is the holy spirit oh yeah
[50:46] there's another good scripture peter
[50:47] said
[50:48] be holy for i am holy so god said i am
[50:51] holy
[50:52] and jesus said god is a spirit he must
[50:54] be the holy spirit
[50:55] holy spirit he's holy and god jesus said
[50:58] god is a spirit
[51:00] okay um ephesians 1 13 sister wendy can
[51:03] you get that
[51:03] ephesians 1 13. sister huh could you get
[51:06] um
[51:07] well we read that one this morning right
[51:09] yeah i read that one this morning cereal
[51:10] can you get acts 1 5
[51:12] please thank you i love seeing that
[51:15] bible all highlighted like that that
[51:16] reminds me of mine
[51:18] not everybody likes to do that but i
[51:19] sure like to color mine up praise god
[51:23] cover it with different highlighters so
[51:25] do i need if you can read that
[51:26] in whom he also trusts after that he
[51:29] heard
[51:29] the word of truth the gospel of your
[51:31] salvation in him also after that
[51:40] amen sealed with that holy spirit of
[51:42] promise
[51:43] now we can almost all memorize this one
[51:45] right grieve not the holy spirit of
[51:48] god whereby you're sealed until the day
[51:50] of your
[51:51] redemption right glory so you're
[51:55] with the seal of the holy spirit so the
[51:57] holy spirit's a seal
[52:00] all right we read that one jesus said
[52:02] the
[52:03] uh the holy ghost could not be given
[52:05] until jesus was glorified
[52:06] all right sister who can you read acts 1
[52:08] 5
[52:10] for john truly baptized with water and
[52:12] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[52:15] not many days amen that's beautiful i
[52:18] i love pointing that one out who
[52:20] preached the baptism the holy ghost
[52:21] first
[52:22] christ amen jesus preaches it right
[52:25] there he said you shall be
[52:26] baptized with the holy ghost so a lot of
[52:29] churches don't like to talk about the
[52:31] baptism they just say
[52:32] i invited jesus in my heart but you need
[52:35] more than that
[52:35] praise god that means you just invited
[52:37] him into your mind you need a baptism
[52:39] praise god
[52:40] you need your soul immersed in god's
[52:42] spirit praise god
[52:44] where you hate sin where you hate
[52:46] iniquity but you rejoice in the truth
[52:48] amen
[52:49] amen now we read that one this morning
[52:51] the love of god
[52:52] hallelujah is shed abroad in your hearts
[52:55] by the holy ghost
[52:56] so how does love god's love get in your
[52:58] heart by the holy ghost
[53:00] so see it just comes off full circle can
[53:01] everybody see that oh i love that
[53:04] beautiful that's what i was hoping to
[53:07] show by the help of the holy spirit you
[53:08] can start here
[53:09] and it's just like a it's like a circle
[53:11] it just goes right back to itself
[53:13] now let's do the other one too because
[53:14] this is really good here um to show
[53:16] christ in you so
[53:17] uh lydia first one malachi second one
[53:21] acacia third one wendy why don't we do
[53:24] the fourth one
[53:25] and then can you do that one too okay
[53:28] she's not here okay
[53:29] i'll do that one john 14 i actually want
[53:31] to read 16 and 17.
[53:35] yeah these are beautiful scriptures
[53:37] praise god 14
[53:39] okay 16 17. okay
[53:45] thank the lord praise god okay uh lydia
[53:47] go ahead
[53:49] secretions 13 5 i'm sorry that too small
[53:53] sorry about that
[53:57] that's a good one about examining
[53:59] yourself
[54:00] you see that that is scriptural we can
[54:02] take inventory how many believe that
[54:04] we should be able to look at that statue
[54:05] of man see where am i where am i doing
[54:08] well by your grace lord but where do i
[54:10] need strength where do i need help amen
[54:24] now church a reprobate is someone who's
[54:26] who's lost
[54:28] uh like judas right he was reprobate
[54:31] uh so let me say this a foolish virgin
[54:33] they have the spirit of christ in them
[54:35] up here
[54:37] but they they don't have it here because
[54:38] they're not sealed by the day
[54:40] uh by the holy spirit to the day of
[54:41] their redemption so see jesus christ is
[54:43] in them
[54:44] in their minds but they got to let it go
[54:45] a little bit deeper praise god
[54:47] got to go deeper in the love of god
[54:49] that's right
[54:50] okay malachi colossians 1 27 so jesus
[54:54] christ is in you
[54:55] now christ is in you
[55:04] amen praise god so are those two
[55:06] different no
[55:07] one in the same it's the holy spirit
[55:09] right it's the spirit of christ
[55:11] john 14 16 now here it is beautiful
[55:14] jesus
[55:15] calls the holy spirit the comforter and
[55:16] the spirit of truth
[55:20] and then he says i too in verse 18.
[55:23] glory and i will pray the father that he
[55:25] shall give you another comforter
[55:27] there's comforter that he may abide with
[55:29] you forever even the spirit of truth
[55:31] so the comforter is now the spirit of
[55:33] truth whom the world cannot receive
[55:36] because it seeth them not neither
[55:38] knoweth him but ye know him
[55:39] for he dwelt with you and shall be in
[55:42] you
[55:43] and then verse 18. now the holy spirit
[55:45] starts speaking through jesus's flesh
[55:47] and said i will not leave you
[55:48] comfortless i will come to you
[55:51] oh that's beautiful praise god amen
[55:54] brother
[55:54] said it was quite a paradox there was
[55:56] times jesus would speak and then there
[55:58] was flesh and then there was times god
[55:59] would speak
[56:02] hallelujah the bible said never spake a
[56:05] man like this man
[56:07] hallelujah he said before abraham was i
[56:09] am hallelujah
[56:11] uh is that sister when he's not yours
[56:12] thank you uh really not that yeah the
[56:14] temple of god
[56:16] then that the spirit of god dwells in
[56:18] you amen praise god the spirit god
[56:20] dwells in you that's that key word those
[56:22] two key words rather
[56:24] in you in you see it's the same thing
[56:26] the spirit of god spirit of truth
[56:27] spirit of jesus christ and uh who'd i
[56:30] say on that last one oh sisterhood can
[56:32] you read that of course
[56:34] what know ye not that your body is the
[56:36] temple of the holy ghost which is in you
[56:39] which we have of god and we are not
[56:42] amen thank you praise god so it isn't
[56:45] that great to see all those scriptures
[56:47] i love seeing all those placed together
[56:49] because you'll you church you and i will
[56:51] find the bible's so amazing 66 books
[56:53] written over the course of almost 2000
[56:55] years by i think there was over what
[56:57] 20 or 30 authors and none of them ever
[57:00] contradicted the other one
[57:01] now that's a divine book right there
[57:03] praise god and so see
[57:05] god has different synonyms you know
[57:06] jesus christ christ in you the comforter
[57:09] all these different things but it's all
[57:10] speaking of the one and same thing jesus
[57:12] christ
[57:13] spirit living in our souls glory
[57:17] all right so um
[57:21] that's good that's real good right there
[57:22] okay so let's is that held by god's
[57:24] grace is that helpful beautiful
[57:26] beautiful i love that i think i think
[57:28] before i publish the book lord willing
[57:30] if god tarries and if
[57:31] he gives me strength to do it i want to
[57:32] put that in there i want to make a chart
[57:34] of that and show how
[57:35] they're all synonyms and then get the
[57:37] scripture for it because it just takes
[57:39] all the guesswork out of it
[57:41] praise god okay let's go back to this
[57:42] one now the next section was just
[57:44] showing
[57:45] yeah i'm taking a picture of my master
[57:49] i try to make my wife laugh you know
[57:53] i really don't like wearing those things
[57:55] what can you do
[57:57] give the caesar what caesars okay
[58:01] so this is a figure showing how uh
[58:04] god always has three works right three
[58:07] works of grace
[58:09] and faith is the first work and then
[58:11] virtue up to broadly kindness is the
[58:13] second work
[58:14] and then the third work is love or
[58:17] charity the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:20] i believe that i believe that's the
[58:21] right way to understand it
[58:24] now let's uh show a few scriptures now
[58:27] let me say this
[58:28] the word work a lot of people don't like
[58:30] works of grace
[58:31] because they don't like the word work
[58:34] but church
[58:35] when you look at the bible the bible
[58:36] does use the word work
[58:38] and here's the thing it's not our works
[58:40] it's god working
[58:41] through us or another way the bible puts
[58:44] it is god working
[58:46] with us praise god because god can't do
[58:48] it alone like brother man said he can't
[58:50] push you through a pipe and say you did
[58:51] it
[58:52] he's got to have your will praise god
[58:54] amen he's got to have your desire your
[58:57] surrender praise god
[58:59] and then he can move by that then he can
[59:00] lead us and guide us into all truth
[59:03] so i want to i want to go through the
[59:04] scriptures that teach that
[59:07] so the first thing i'm going to read
[59:08] actually i'm going to read myself is
[59:10] romans 2 4
[59:12] the goodness of god leads you to
[59:16] repentance
[59:18] i was asking sister uh sarah afterwards
[59:20] what age she got baptized
[59:22] eight years old you imagine that eight
[59:25] that's awesome what a testimony
[59:27] and that that repentance there when she
[59:30] was eight
[59:31] has has guided her to be justified
[59:34] sanctified and then filled with the holy
[59:36] ghost i think she said when she was 18
[59:37] or 19
[59:38] she got filled with the holy spirit
[59:39] isn't that beautiful
[59:42] i got baptized at 16 i really wanted to
[59:44] do it but then i as soon as i got in the
[59:45] car i turned on my rock and roll music
[59:46] it was over
[59:48] my repentance was over right there
[59:50] because i just went right back to that
[59:52] same old lifestyle
[59:53] but then after i uh uh became a
[59:56] christian
[59:56] i wasn't even baptized because i didn't
[59:58] even know about it at 19
[1:00:00] and then simon brought me the word i got
[1:00:02] baptized and the man said jesus only and
[1:00:04] i thought oh
[1:00:06] i thought brother he was a oneness
[1:00:07] church up there in actor i said brother
[1:00:09] in my heart i thought so i just called
[1:00:11] simon i said simon tell brother brooks i
[1:00:13] need to be baptized the name of the lord
[1:00:14] jesus christ
[1:00:16] so i've been baptized three times by
[1:00:17] god's grace but it's awesome to see like
[1:00:19] our sister
[1:00:21] raising it and with the sincerity and
[1:00:23] seeing the sincerity in her family
[1:00:24] that that baptism at eight years old
[1:00:26] that can hold you that can be a typos
[1:00:29] praise god
[1:00:30] amen even to the devil when no matter
[1:00:32] when he comes is you could say no i was
[1:00:34] sincere
[1:00:34] i got baptized at eight years old i
[1:00:37] think some of my children are baptized
[1:00:38] at five if i'm not mistaken
[1:00:39] and i trust by god's grace that the
[1:00:42] sincere
[1:00:43] i trust they were sincere by the grace
[1:00:44] of the lord amen amen
[1:00:46] harris did you get baptized at 500 oh
[1:00:48] bless your heart praise god
[1:00:50] amen she had a good testimony because
[1:00:52] she we were up here praying
[1:00:53] for souls and she was crying in the
[1:00:55] nursery at the same time wanting to be
[1:00:56] baptized
[1:00:58] that was a great testimony praying for
[1:01:00] souls god save souls and then god gave
[1:01:02] us a soul
[1:01:02] [Laughter]
[1:01:05] i thank the lord god is merciful praise
[1:01:07] god he's gracious
[1:01:10] so uh romans 2 4
[1:01:14] or despises thou the riches of his
[1:01:16] goodness and forbearance and
[1:01:17] long-suffering
[1:01:19] and knoweth and i'm sorry and not
[1:01:22] knowing that the goodness of god leads
[1:01:24] lead to repentance
[1:01:26] so before someone will turn from their
[1:01:28] evil life god will show them how good he
[1:01:30] is
[1:01:31] and at that moment the believer says god
[1:01:33] you are so good
[1:01:35] i love you i'm going to turn from my
[1:01:37] sinful ways and i'm going to follow your
[1:01:39] paths
[1:01:40] that's right the very first reason you
[1:01:43] want to be a christian
[1:01:44] is because of how good god is
[1:01:48] and then when you see how good god is
[1:01:51] then uh the scripture says after that
[1:01:53] you love god
[1:01:54] and then love causes your faith to work
[1:01:59] so love produces faith and faith works
[1:02:03] praise god because we went over that a
[1:02:05] few months or a few weeks ago that's
[1:02:06] galatians 5
[1:02:07] 6 faith works by love so
[1:02:10] you you see how good god is you fall in
[1:02:12] love with him you love him
[1:02:14] now you have faith in him and then you
[1:02:15] work for him
[1:02:17] praise god now let's go to i want to
[1:02:21] make sure i hit this scripture
[1:02:22] um lydia mark 16 the last two verses
[1:02:28] malachi first corinthians 15 10.
[1:02:31] is he in here no he's not here okay
[1:02:33] first corinthians 15 10.
[1:02:39] see they don't like that word work oh
[1:02:40] brother jesse you're putting works in
[1:02:41] there i've had people tell me that
[1:02:43] three works you're working for salvation
[1:02:45] no it's christ working in me
[1:02:47] praise god it's christ working with me
[1:02:50] praise god
[1:02:52] so lydia if you could get that go ahead
[1:03:07] amen amen so they they repent
[1:03:10] you know uh after jesus was crucified
[1:03:12] they all scattered they come back they
[1:03:14] repent
[1:03:14] jesus meets them he leaves and after
[1:03:17] that he works with them praise god
[1:03:19] oh that's my prayer every time i preach
[1:03:20] my name i say god work with me
[1:03:22] just work humble me right brother bank
[1:03:24] humble me lord work
[1:03:26] with me so that i can be a blessing to
[1:03:27] your people you know in every life right
[1:03:29] in our family life in our
[1:03:30] school life our work life we just want
[1:03:32] to we want to work with the lord praise
[1:03:34] god
[1:03:35] because brother baby says he can't work
[1:03:36] without you he needs your hands
[1:03:38] he needs your feet praise god he needs
[1:03:40] your voice
[1:03:41] he needs your eyes he needs your words
[1:03:44] so see he's working with us by the grace
[1:03:46] of the lord
[1:03:47] amen first corinthians 15 10 says
[1:03:50] beautiful scripture but by the grace of
[1:03:54] god
[1:03:55] i am what i am and his grace which was
[1:03:58] bestowed upon me was not in vain
[1:04:00] but i labored more abundantly than they
[1:04:02] are yet not i
[1:04:04] but the grace of god which was with me
[1:04:07] now notice that notice that the grace
[1:04:09] was with him
[1:04:11] and this grace caused him to work harder
[1:04:13] than peter can you imagine that
[1:04:15] harder than james harder than john the
[1:04:18] grace of god that was with paul
[1:04:20] remember why did he why did he love
[1:04:22] grace because christ had forgiven him
[1:04:24] for his awful sins
[1:04:26] you know standing there and holding the
[1:04:28] the the the coats of stephen's
[1:04:30] killers you know and and then breaking
[1:04:32] into christians homes and dragging them
[1:04:34] off to prison
[1:04:36] paul says because of god's grace it
[1:04:38] caused me
[1:04:39] i kept i kept remembering where i came
[1:04:41] from and it caused me to want to work
[1:04:43] more for jesus
[1:04:44] oh may god anoint us with that kind of
[1:04:46] labor praise god
[1:04:48] that's not me laboring but it's god's
[1:04:49] grace look what god has done in my life
[1:04:51] what more can i do than just serve and
[1:04:53] praise god
[1:04:54] out of my appreciation right work sir is
[1:04:56] what we do out of appreciation for god
[1:05:00] amen so see uh
[1:05:03] let's let's just keep that in our hearts
[1:05:05] that when we say three works of grace
[1:05:07] we're talking about us
[1:05:08] surrendering to the holy spirit and god
[1:05:10] working through our lives
[1:05:12] in other words surrendering say god
[1:05:14] increase my knowledge
[1:05:15] god increase help me work through me so
[1:05:18] that i can be
[1:05:18] temperate work through me that i can be
[1:05:21] more patient with the pastor
[1:05:22] right right now you have more kindness
[1:05:26] towards me
[1:05:27] even when i do you're wrong or if i
[1:05:29] mistreat somebody because
[1:05:31] that's what we are we're a family right
[1:05:33] and we need we need to have grace and
[1:05:34] kindness for each other
[1:05:36] amen even when especially when we fall
[1:05:38] short
[1:05:39] because it's easy to love everybody
[1:05:40] loves you jesus said so
[1:05:43] so god let me have that lord let your
[1:05:45] grace be with me
[1:05:46] that i can manifest your love to my
[1:05:50] church family brotherly kindness
[1:05:55] so see it's god grace is god's unmerited
[1:05:57] favor you don't deserve it
[1:05:59] but yet its grace must always be your
[1:06:01] motivation
[1:06:03] right how many believe that you're
[1:06:05] always motivated by god's grace
[1:06:08] okay now just for three works a man's
[1:06:10] birth water breaks bloody show breath of
[1:06:12] life

[1:06:23] earth's cleansing noah's flood jesus
[1:06:24] blood the fervent heat
[1:06:27] i like this one ezekiel's prophecy new
[1:06:29] heart new spirit
[1:06:30] god's spirit let's read that one ezekiel
[1:06:33] 36
[1:06:33] 26 and 27 it's been a while since i read
[1:06:37] that and i thought i was just
[1:06:38] encouraging
[1:06:42] ezekiel 36 26-27
[1:06:49] now while i'm there malachi can you get
[1:06:51] mark
[1:06:53] 428 buddy you get mark 428 malcolm
[1:06:59] this last one was a fresh revelation i
[1:07:01] think i preached that recently kind of
[1:07:03] just off the
[1:07:04] off the cuff kind of now i'm going to
[1:07:06] read ezekiel 36
[1:07:07] 26. this is beautiful now ezekiel this
[1:07:10] was preached according to uh
[1:07:12] usher's history 587 bc so almost 600
[1:07:16] years before christ
[1:07:18] this was preached and remember ezekiel
[1:07:22] was one prophesying them
[1:07:23] in babylon ezekiel wasn't in jerusalem
[1:07:26] right jeremiah was in jerusalem
[1:07:29] ezekiel was prophesying around the same
[1:07:31] time
[1:07:32] in babylon to the the jews in babylon
[1:07:35] remember he got carried by the vision by
[1:07:37] his hair he got carried back to
[1:07:38] jerusalem
[1:07:38] to see all the idols in the temple which
[1:07:40] was a type of our day right
[1:07:42] you can see all the idolatry in the
[1:07:43] house of god and judgment begins in the
[1:07:44] house of god
[1:07:46] but he got carried back the river chabar
[1:07:47] i believe it was not mistaken
[1:07:49] he says a new heart also will i give you
[1:07:51] amen and a new spirit will i put within
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:54] now take away the stony heart out of
[1:07:56] your flesh and i'll give you a heart of
[1:07:58] flesh
[1:07:59] amen amen remember amen i told you
[1:08:01] you're watching my testimony remember
[1:08:03] brother amen was so nice he came to
[1:08:04] record my testimony with me and i'm
[1:08:06] almost done i got maybe about halfway to
[1:08:07] go
[1:08:08] but brother sister i was so hardhearted
[1:08:11] toward god but when i was driving in
[1:08:13] cam's car and singing
[1:08:14] i just started hearing those songs one
[1:08:15] of these days i'm going to see the nails
[1:08:19] that uh i'm seeing sorry see the hands
[1:08:21] that took the nails from me
[1:08:22] i felt sister wendy my heart of stone i
[1:08:24] felt it breaking into pieces
[1:08:26] and and then i wanted to drive his car
[1:08:28] more brother bang so i can listen to
[1:08:29] more of that christian music
[1:08:32] see he was breaking my heart of stone he
[1:08:33] was breaking it into pieces
[1:08:35] until it became a heart of flesh praise
[1:08:37] god god used music to do that to show me
[1:08:40] his goodness amen
[1:08:42] hallelujah one day i want to see the
[1:08:44] hands
[1:08:45] that took the nails for you the man that
[1:08:47] died for me i want to see him and i want
[1:08:49] to see him
[1:08:50] and i wanted to accept me praise god
[1:08:53] music god used music to show me his
[1:08:56] goodness
[1:08:57] now that group that group isn't even a
[1:08:59] message group brother bank
[1:09:01] but god use them amen see how god can
[1:09:03] use a can i say like this god can use a
[1:09:05] penny
[1:09:06] right silver dollar nickel quarter
[1:09:08] aren't you glad guy can use all those
[1:09:10] denominations
[1:09:12] other denominations coin denominations
[1:09:14] right i think probably those people
[1:09:16] probably came out as nominations
[1:09:18] but see thank god that we got a new a
[1:09:21] new heart praise god
[1:09:24] that's what it is oh and then new spirit
[1:09:27] of course sanctification
[1:09:28] verse 27 and i will put my spirit within
[1:09:30] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:09:33] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:09:35] them praise god
[1:09:37] see when you yield when you yield your
[1:09:39] your heart and then your mind
[1:09:41] and then jesus is the one working
[1:09:43] through you when you're born again
[1:09:46] he's causing me to say with the word
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:49] because i invited him in and he's sealed
[1:09:51] in my soul now he's
[1:09:53] he's causing me to keep the commands of
[1:09:55] god right
[1:09:56] your flesh doesn't always want to come
[1:09:57] to church your flesh doesn't want to
[1:09:59] always worship and sing
[1:10:00] but what is it it's the holy spirit
[1:10:02] causing you to raise your hands and sing
[1:10:04] out
[1:10:04] and cry out and lift the name of the
[1:10:06] lord jesus high above everything else
[1:10:09] it's god causing you to keep the
[1:10:11] commands
[1:10:14] hallelujah oh that's so beautiful
[1:10:19] he's causing me to stay with the word
[1:10:21] he's keeping me praise god
[1:10:24] now i don't want to lose that
[1:10:28] my phone went to sleep okay there we go
[1:10:30] all right
[1:10:32] okay so you can see it everybody can see
[1:10:33] it now how can people deny this switch
[1:10:35] because they don't they just don't want
[1:10:36] it they don't want to believe it
[1:10:38] right they just don't want to remember
[1:10:40] the bible said there'll be no excuses on
[1:10:41] that day
[1:10:42] no but no excuse well it was too deep
[1:10:44] for me no this ain't deep this is very
[1:10:46] simple
[1:10:47] right everybody can see there's three
[1:10:48] stages to all these things
[1:10:51] the maokai read that mark 4 28 did i
[1:10:53] tell you 29
[1:10:54] if i did i'm sorry mark 4 28.
[1:11:05] amen now this is beautiful jesus christ
[1:11:08] himself preaches there's three works of
[1:11:09] grace
[1:11:11] there's three stages to a little
[1:11:13] christian plant growing up a little
[1:11:14] christian wheat plant praise god
[1:11:17] jesus christ teaches this there's the
[1:11:19] blade first
[1:11:20] then the ear and then the full corn
[1:11:23] praise god now i put that in
[1:11:27] as far as the book i made a separate
[1:11:28] section of that that shows that's the
[1:11:30] three works of grace
[1:11:32] and i like what verse 27 says the bible
[1:11:35] said the man don't know how it grew up
[1:11:38] praise god that's what paul said paul
[1:11:40] says i planted
[1:11:41] apollos water but god gave the increase
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:45] amen see no man can cause your own
[1:11:48] spiritual increase i remember telling
[1:11:49] the story about wendy
[1:11:50] i want to grow i want to grow i want to
[1:11:51] grow so see in other words you cannot
[1:11:54] add the character to yourself
[1:11:56] you've got to stay rooted and grounded

[1:12:58] didn't mean to get this so excited

[1:13:24] the longer we go on
[1:13:25] the more blessings we see in god's word
[1:13:27] the more revelation
[1:13:30] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[1:13:32] is truth okay got five minutes here let

[1:13:52] vote
[1:13:55] i'll give you two choices do you want to
[1:13:57] see some foolish version quotes that
[1:13:58] they're saved
[1:13:59] because i thought i could get that done
[1:14:00] in five minutes or do you want to see
[1:14:02] the significance of the number eight in
[1:14:03] the bible
[1:14:05] so let's vote take a second there think
[1:14:07] about it
[1:14:08] okay you had a second all right so who
[1:14:10] like do the foolish virgin quotes
[1:14:12] one two three four five five okay good
[1:14:16] five
[1:14:16] how many would like to do the
[1:14:17] significance of number eight
[1:14:19] one two three four okay
[1:14:23] we'll do foolish virgin quotes praise
[1:14:25] the lord it was a close one too my and i
[1:14:28] didn't vote in that one i should have
[1:14:29] voted
[1:14:30] no it's okay um i want to pull it up i
[1:14:33] think it'd be really good to see those
[1:14:35] like i said i preached this back in
[1:14:36] 2016.
[1:14:40] and again church i i you know i
[1:14:44] i don't like disagreeing with a great
[1:14:46] man like perry greene
[1:14:49] wonderful godly man don't get me wrong
[1:14:50] my ministry probably is
[1:14:52] if brother branham was a pebble on the
[1:14:54] beach what am i with man i'm like a
[1:14:55] cloud of dust or something like that
[1:14:57] what else what lower thing can you get a
[1:14:59] pebble on the beach
[1:15:01] uh that's okay i just want to show you
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:04] i really believe the foolish virgin is
[1:15:06] saved by the blood
[1:15:09] i believe that now they don't have the
[1:15:10] full effects of it
[1:15:12] they're like a blade right there like a
[1:15:13] blade they never really got to the
[1:15:15] uh the stalk and they never got to the
[1:15:17] full corn
[1:15:18] but at least they have some life in
[1:15:20] christ
[1:15:21] enough to be foolish virgin all right so
[1:15:25] um i got my slides here by number
[1:15:28] yeah i'm only 24. so this is uh 61.
[1:15:31] where the five virgins lost he said the
[1:15:33] five versions were not lost
[1:15:38] i don't you know i don't i wish brother
[1:15:40] green was here i could talk to him about
[1:15:41] some of these and
[1:15:42] and understand because you know the
[1:15:44] reason i preached this was because
[1:15:45] brother loris was sat under brother
[1:15:47] greene
[1:15:48] and but brother laura said the foolish
[1:15:49] virgin he didn't believe they were saved
[1:15:51] i said that's okay brother i said let me
[1:15:53] preach it sometime
[1:15:55] and then when i preach it i was loris i
[1:15:57] was gonna plan on talking to him and
[1:15:59] caring afterwards but then the snow
[1:16:00] storm came and they didn't get to hear
[1:16:02] i hope they live streamed it by god's
[1:16:04] grace but we never actually talked about
[1:16:05] it after that
[1:16:07] but uh there it is uh they were not lost
[1:16:09] there's one
[1:16:10] now there's a lot of reading in there
[1:16:11] but i'll skip that one um go to 26.
[1:16:14] no they were not lost but they never
[1:16:16] will be in the bride they were coming
[1:16:18] the second resurrection never being the
[1:16:19] bride
[1:16:20] now look george this is four years
[1:16:21] before the church age book
[1:16:23] four years so like some people think the
[1:16:26] church age book you know brother man
[1:16:27] just threw that in all the you know
[1:16:29] maybe
[1:16:30] maybe gamalia maybe nicodemus will be
[1:16:31] saved brother and believe this for years
[1:16:34] it wasn't just thrown in at the last
[1:16:36] minute by lee vale brother brandon had
[1:16:38] that in there praise god
[1:16:39] because he teached it the foolish virgin
[1:16:41] is going to be saved
[1:16:42] amen he said to be judged according to
[1:16:46] the way they treated the light that they
[1:16:48] received now that part
[1:16:49] will be up to christ they were not lost
[1:16:52] though look he says it three times
[1:16:54] not lost not lost not lost they're saved
[1:16:58] okay now you know this they're saved
[1:17:00] they ask him again in 61.
[1:17:02] uh brother and what happens to the
[1:17:04] people that are considered a sleeping
[1:17:05] virgin when they're judged at the
[1:17:06] judgment
[1:17:06] well the sleeping virgin will be saved
[1:17:08] of course
[1:17:11] i just don't know i wish i wish these
[1:17:12] brothers were here i could talk to them
[1:17:15] i don't know why people think the
[1:17:17] foolish burden is not safe well i do
[1:17:18] know there's a couple quotes
[1:17:20] that people uh they maybe they take the
[1:17:22] wrong way
[1:17:23] she'll be saved at the judgment she'll
[1:17:25] never be in the bride but she saved
[1:17:27] a group of people that will come in the
[1:17:29] judgment that will not be included in
[1:17:30] the bride
[1:17:31] but as long as they're virgins they're
[1:17:32] before god see they are to be saved he
[1:17:34] said
[1:17:34] they'll be the sheep on his right side
[1:17:37] and the unsaved will be the goats on his
[1:17:39] left at the great white throne judgment
[1:17:41] and the church said
[1:17:42] amen okay that's the scripture 62. i
[1:17:46] didn't have any quotes on it
[1:17:47] but brother man says in the seventh seal
[1:17:49] he said she comes up
[1:17:51] purged with white robes on anybody that
[1:17:55] knows the bible knows that white robes
[1:17:57] is the righteousness
[1:17:58] of jesus christ and the man says it's
[1:18:00] eternal life so let me do one more
[1:18:02] minute brother
[1:18:04] bishop
[1:18:07] how perfect how beautiful that is he was
[1:18:10] perfect it's scripturally right
[1:18:13] okay we also find out the sixth seal now
[1:18:15] being open it was the threefold purpose
[1:18:17] now
[1:18:17] here was the purpose the first thing was
[1:18:19] that the sleeping versions had to go
[1:18:21] through the tribulation period for
[1:18:22] purification
[1:18:23] she had to be purged of her sins of
[1:18:24] unbelief and rejecting the message oh
[1:18:26] i'm so glad i didn't reject it praise
[1:18:27] god
[1:18:28] i've received it amen this
[1:18:32] she was done in the tribulation we see
[1:18:35] they wind up over here in revelation 7
[1:18:36] between the 6th and 7th chapter there
[1:18:38] that she had been purged and she'd been
[1:18:40] given her robes
[1:18:42] now she's not the bride but it's the
[1:18:43] church the pure people that they didn't
[1:18:44] have the opportunity maybe
[1:18:47] look church there it is maybe but
[1:18:49] remember there's no excuses at the white
[1:18:50] throne judgment
[1:18:51] the bible says the eyes lord brother
[1:18:53] bank they go around the earth searching
[1:18:55] for
[1:18:55] anyone that will worship god in other
[1:18:58] words anybody that's hungry and thirsty
[1:19:00] for righteous
[1:19:00] god will manifest himself to him he's
[1:19:03] obligated he has to
[1:19:05] he said that's what the seven spirits
[1:19:06] are they're lamps before the lord and
[1:19:07] then the eyes of the lord
[1:19:09] run to and fro around the whole earth
[1:19:11] seeking who will worship the lord
[1:19:13] so there'll be no excuses but remember
[1:19:15] that's a maybe gotta be careful those
[1:19:17] maybes those mites
[1:19:19] perhaps like brother man said with
[1:19:22] joseph
[1:19:22] he said i hope he said that's my prayer
[1:19:24] anyhow that he's a prophet he never said
[1:19:27] he was thus saith the lord
[1:19:28] he said that's my prayer anyhow okay
[1:19:32] or in some way that they are blinded by
[1:19:34] these false prophets they didn't get a
[1:19:35] chance
[1:19:36] and yet they're really sincere in heart
[1:19:37] and god knows their heart and hear their
[1:19:39] purge during this time aren't you glad
[1:19:41] god knows your heart
[1:19:43] amen now i'm skipping ahead
[1:19:46] and remember jesus said when the
[1:19:47] sleeping version the one that tried to
[1:19:48] live a good life within herself
[1:19:50] they was virgin but they didn't have any
[1:19:51] oil
[1:19:53] this version arises you know in the last
[1:19:55] day in the judgment the white throne
[1:19:56] judgment but not the bride
[1:19:59] okay 64. questions and answers like i
[1:20:02] said i'm going to skip
[1:20:02] some of these for time's sake brother
[1:20:04] branham said the bride to the gentile
[1:20:06] brides in heaven the sleeping virgin the
[1:20:07] gentile version
[1:20:08] is not saved during that time she's
[1:20:10] already been saved
[1:20:13] okay but has been rejected in the bride
[1:20:17] so the bullish virgin is definitely
[1:20:18] saved they're not going to be saved in
[1:20:20] the rapture
[1:20:22] because they didn't get the holy ghost
[1:20:23] they turned it down they rejected it
[1:20:25] but they are saved eternally he says it
[1:20:27] later they're eternally saved
[1:20:29] she only goes to the tribulation period
[1:20:31] for the time of purification because
[1:20:32] she's rejected christ the word
[1:20:33] for her purification
[1:20:36] she's not saved during that time she's
[1:20:38] saved now from
[1:20:39] eternal death so the foolish version
[1:20:43] those catholic methodists presbyterian
[1:20:44] baptists
[1:20:45] say this message they they're saved now
[1:20:48] even if they know the holy ghost if they
[1:20:49] believe
[1:20:50] and they're living a virgin life to god
[1:20:52] they're saved now
[1:20:54] because their names on the book of life
[1:20:59] now here's the two most misunderstood
[1:21:02] quotes later in the same sermon the
[1:21:03] prophet said the nominal believers are
[1:21:04] saved by fire
[1:21:05] okay yeah after the bride is raptured
[1:21:08] will any of the foolish virgin be saved
[1:21:09] or will it be lost
[1:21:10] no see everything will be finished for
[1:21:12] the gentile church
[1:21:14] so this is the quote a lot of people
[1:21:16] misunderstand
[1:21:18] but just look later will the foolish
[1:21:21] virgin be saved no whatever happens
[1:21:23] happens now
[1:21:23] after that time she's in the state now
[1:21:26] she have to go through the tribulation
[1:21:27] period
[1:21:28] but that brother talking about saved
[1:21:29] from the tribulation
[1:21:33] now i'm going to skip that there's never
[1:21:36] been a time in history where that the
[1:21:37] nominal church has become so hungry to
[1:21:38] find the baptism holy ghost
[1:21:41] uh
[1:21:47] yeah here i'm trying to hurry and look
[1:21:48] what brother bam says i'm trying to
[1:21:49] hurry i ought to do this
[1:21:51] i have to lay these back because there's
[1:21:53] a place you could stay on it for an hour
[1:21:54] just to tear it down i'll stop
[1:21:56] look the people are wanting to say that
[1:21:57] thinking that the church is going to hit
[1:21:59] the tribulation it won't it can't
[1:22:00] because it's already redeemed
[1:22:02] that's the bride but now the church here
[1:22:05] it is the church the nominal believers
[1:22:07] like lot he's going through the
[1:22:09] tribulation period see
[1:22:11] and be saved as it were by fire
[1:22:14] this is the same quote i'm sorry the
[1:22:16] same sermon but man
[1:22:18] said the foolish version won't be saved
[1:22:20] he's talking about save from destruction
[1:22:22] right save from death he said but
[1:22:24] they're already saved as it were by fire
[1:22:28] they're already saved the church the
[1:22:30] lukewarm that anything outside the
[1:22:32] elected bride will go through the
[1:22:33] tribulation period
[1:22:34] they will not raise in the first
[1:22:35] resurrection
[1:22:37] and here's what he says he'll separate
[1:22:39] the sheep from the goats say to the
[1:22:41] goats
[1:22:41] and the part and the sheep's come ye
[1:22:43] blessed in my father so here brother ram
[1:22:45] says
[1:22:45] the foolish virgins will hear jesus say
[1:22:47] that come ye
[1:22:49] blessed of my father the foolish virgins
[1:22:51] are blessed aren't you glad
[1:22:53] anyone that serves god sincerely are
[1:22:56] blessed
[1:22:57] amen they don't got to go to our church
[1:22:59] they don't got to believe what we
[1:23:00] believe all the way
[1:23:01] but they got to respect god they got to
[1:23:02] live true to the word and if they do
[1:23:04] that god blesses them
[1:23:06] amen our god is so great he's so
[1:23:08] faithful so merciful
[1:23:14] okay so this is one where uh it sounds
[1:23:16] like brother graham saying the foolish
[1:23:18] virgin takes the mark of the beast
[1:23:20] so this yeah this is this stumbles a
[1:23:22] little bit of people but remember he'd
[1:23:23] already said in that year that they were
[1:23:25] saved
[1:23:26] yeah he said mark of the beast yes
[1:23:28] indeed so let's give brother bram some
[1:23:29] grace
[1:23:30] right he was still working on his
[1:23:32] doctrine
[1:23:34] let's look at the whole picture of the
[1:23:35] word and anybody can see that the
[1:23:37] bullish virgin is saved
[1:23:39] right they're the sheep at the great
[1:23:41] white throne judgment in matthew 25 by
[1:23:43] scripture
[1:23:45] okay so the foolish version is eternally
[1:23:47] saved but not saved
[1:23:48] from the tribulation period okay so i
[1:23:51] appreciate that i tried to um
[1:23:54] shorten that as best as i could let's
[1:23:55] see how many portions i had
[1:23:57] there's more quotes from 64. if you want
[1:23:59] them i can email you this
[1:24:01] the church age book is full of it okay
[1:24:03] that's it
[1:24:04] all right now let's for stretching
[1:24:06] purposes let's stand to our feet before
[1:24:07] brother amen gives us testimony here
[1:24:09] and musicians musicians why don't you
[1:24:11] come and we'll sing a song here
[1:24:12] then my brother can give his testimony
[1:24:22] how many would say lord work through me
[1:24:25] and help me to grow
[1:24:27] as a wheat plant praise god that's my
[1:24:29] prayer
[1:24:30] i want god to work through me
[1:24:34] again i appreciate that email you know
[1:24:35] from that woman who read the book and
[1:24:37] everything that's
[1:24:38] that's what i want to see i want to see
[1:24:39] my life help other people i want to see
[1:24:42] it
[1:24:42] help people in the home church and
[1:24:44] people abroad and
[1:24:46] anyone that can be in the hearing of our
[1:24:48] preaching
[1:24:50] and our writing and our ministries that
[1:24:53] will help people

[1:31:29] the lord god bless you
[1:31:37] won't take too long
[1:31:41] yeah so uh my wife and i we were driving
[1:31:43] up to minnesota
[1:31:44] last week and uh we're like okay um
[1:31:48] darling why don't you give your
[1:31:49] testimony i'll listen to it i'm like and
[1:31:51] then we
[1:31:52] i see what ended up saying her testimony
[1:31:54] and it went almost to two hours long
[1:31:56] so so we ran over two hours
[1:32:00] we're like okay at least we got two
[1:32:01] hours of driving done you know so
[1:32:03] and she wasn't done yet so i'm like okay
[1:32:06] maybe you'll keep it to 20 minutes and
[1:32:08] we'll do 20 minutes
[1:32:11] um okay um
[1:32:15] the first time i ever encountered the
[1:32:18] lord was actually in fifth grade
[1:32:20] and uh this is when uh i used to live in
[1:32:22] wisconsin and
[1:32:24] my dad became a pastor and we went down
[1:32:26] to assemblies that got church so we
[1:32:28] belong to
[1:32:29] that church and he was a pastor there
[1:32:31] and uh the first time i encountered the
[1:32:33] lord was
[1:32:34] when we were walking like in that like
[1:32:37] it was like a hallway like this
[1:32:38] we were walking this hallway and then i
[1:32:40] heard some christian music playing and
[1:32:42] it was
[1:32:42] a song called at the cross i
[1:32:45] find life at the cross you suffered and
[1:32:48] died for me
[1:32:49] and that's the first time i ever felt
[1:32:50] the presence of god before and
[1:32:52] all i could see was a vision of a
[1:32:55] heavenly dove
[1:32:56] coming and flying down like how i fell
[1:32:57] on jesus i'm like oh wow
[1:32:59] and at that moment when i was fifth well
[1:33:02] in fifth grade i told myself
[1:33:03] i want to grow up and be a godly man
[1:33:06] that's what i told myself
[1:33:07] because i just love the presence of god
[1:33:09] i'm like what is this i never felt god
[1:33:11] like this before
[1:33:12] so um so we went to um
[1:33:15] you know we had the bible bible school
[1:33:18] and the first bible verse ivan rice was
[1:33:20] uh john b16
[1:33:21] you know for god's love the world i
[1:33:22] guess one only son and uh
[1:33:24] that was such a blessing in my heart so
[1:33:27] in middle school
[1:33:28] uh they had this big wait
[1:33:31] maybe like a someone kind of like a
[1:33:33] revival at their
[1:33:35] at the assemblies of god church and that
[1:33:37] was the the time i decided to um
[1:33:40] at that time it was like you know accept
[1:33:42] jesus into your heart
[1:33:43] so at age i went and i wanted to accept
[1:33:45] jesus into my heart you know
[1:33:47] and all they did was give me a bag with
[1:33:49] some
[1:33:50] some pieces of paper in it that had like
[1:33:52] oh this is how you're saved and
[1:33:54] you know so the the pastor was supposed
[1:33:57] to come up and like you know talk to
[1:33:58] everyone who got
[1:33:59] who accepted christ in the heart but he
[1:34:01] didn't talk to me so
[1:34:03] but then we were all in this little
[1:34:05] group but they just gave us like this
[1:34:06] bag and okay you're christian now here
[1:34:08] you go
[1:34:08] so i'm like okay so i i grew up a
[1:34:11] christian like that so um
[1:34:14] so in high school my parents went and
[1:34:18] they got divorced
[1:34:19] and this um my parents uh my dad
[1:34:23] actually
[1:34:23] stopped going to church because he got
[1:34:26] kicked out because he didn't like what
[1:34:27] he was preaching
[1:34:28] so he got kicked out my dad didn't want
[1:34:30] to go to church anymore
[1:34:32] so that he took us to one church a cma
[1:34:34] church christian missionary alliance
[1:34:36] they believe in um the teachings of
[1:34:39] um what's his name billy graham they
[1:34:41] believe they're under his teaching
[1:34:42] so they believe what he preaches so um
[1:34:45] we went to that church
[1:34:47] only one time and then my parents didn't
[1:34:49] want to go church no more and my sisters
[1:34:50] didn't want to go church anymore
[1:34:52] but i wanted to go to church so um i
[1:34:54] would actually walk to church
[1:34:56] this is in high school i would actually
[1:34:58] walk to church every single time they
[1:35:00] had service
[1:35:01] friday nights sunday nights even when it
[1:35:04] was raining
[1:35:05] even when it was snowing outside even if
[1:35:07] the weather was terrible i just wanted
[1:35:09] to go to church
[1:35:10] because i just loved being with people
[1:35:12] that love god
[1:35:14] that's that was just my desire and um
[1:35:17] yeah i i i went to church and that's
[1:35:20] when in high school was when i started
[1:35:22] learning how to play music
[1:35:24] um yeah i started learning to play i
[1:35:27] taught myself
[1:35:28] uh the piano and the guitar by myself
[1:35:31] and you know
[1:35:32] because we didn't have any teachers to
[1:35:34] teach us so i taught myself all these
[1:35:36] instruments
[1:35:37] and i was in choir in school too so
[1:35:39] every time
[1:35:40] every year they always sing the same
[1:35:41] song over and over the battle him of the
[1:35:43] republic
[1:35:44] like i always got the boring part
[1:35:46] because it was the the baseline because
[1:35:48] i was
[1:35:48] i had a little voice of my teacher jose
[1:35:51] i gotta sing those songs
[1:35:52] but then i'm glad we come to church here
[1:35:54] i can sing the melody you know
[1:35:56] battlefield republic um
[1:35:59] okay so so after
[1:36:03] high school um my parent my dad got
[1:36:05] remarried and we moved down to akron
[1:36:07] ohio and uh i went to
[1:36:10] i decided to go to uh bible college was
[1:36:12] the school falls
[1:36:14] down in georgia and they made me sign
[1:36:16] this um what's it called
[1:36:18] yes pretty much a doctorate thing you uh
[1:36:22] say i believe this this i'm like oh okay
[1:36:23] i didn't know any better
[1:36:25] i did that and i went to uh the school
[1:36:27] there and
[1:36:28] boy did i learn a lot of weird things
[1:36:31] over there
[1:36:32] it's they say they're a christian
[1:36:34] college but it doesn't really feel
[1:36:36] christian like
[1:36:37] let's just say that way like we had uh
[1:36:39] we went to their um
[1:36:41] we call it chapel every like tuesday and
[1:36:44] thursday we went to a different church
[1:36:46] on sunday and we did that every week and
[1:36:49] then they always preach and
[1:36:51] yeah it wasn't it didn't feel like uh
[1:36:54] god was there you know it was just oh we
[1:36:56] all believe in god but
[1:36:57] the god wasn't there you know so um
[1:37:00] after
[1:37:01] i only went to one semester and then i
[1:37:03] decided to drop out of college and i
[1:37:05] came
[1:37:06] and i moved on i was in akron and
[1:37:09] from there i think i spent 2011 2014
[1:37:14] three years working and i was not
[1:37:17] satisfied with my life
[1:37:19] i did not like the way life was going
[1:37:21] i'm like is this all life has to offer
[1:37:23] is this
[1:37:24] what my purpose on earth is just to work
[1:37:27] and just to
[1:37:28] go do this and this and 2014 was
[1:37:32] the time i went to my room and i prayed
[1:37:35] and i'm like god i know you're real but
[1:37:38] where are you
[1:37:39] where is the god of abraham where's the
[1:37:41] god of isaac where's the god of jacob
[1:37:43] why aren't you here with the church why
[1:37:45] aren't you here how come i don't see you
[1:37:47] where's you said you would heal and do
[1:37:49] miracles but where is all this
[1:37:51] and that was the same year actually met
[1:37:53] pastor jesse so
[1:37:55] god answered that prayer and uh so how i
[1:37:57] met pastor jesse was 2014 i prayed that
[1:38:00] prayer
[1:38:01] and then i um my wife's brother gu
[1:38:05] they said there was a testimony meeting
[1:38:08] pastor jesse was hosting
[1:38:10] we didn't go to that but we went after
[1:38:12] they were done
[1:38:13] because we were doing some other things
[1:38:15] so and as soon as i met pastor jesse
[1:38:18] oh man i just knew that man had god
[1:38:21] i knew that he had jesus christ
[1:38:24] something real
[1:38:25] i mean just the way he talked and the
[1:38:27] way he presented himself i'm like
[1:38:29] this man has god i know he's a christian
[1:38:32] and
[1:38:33] i'm gonna follow this man no matter what
[1:38:35] so um
[1:38:37] i think we got contact with i got in
[1:38:39] contact with pastor jesse
[1:38:40] and uh we decided to um
[1:38:44] this is the time that we decided to um
[1:38:46] talk a bit about you know why
[1:38:48] baptism and pastor jesse did baptize me
[1:38:51] the correct way
[1:38:52] and um this is pretty interesting so um
[1:38:55] so when i was back in my old church the
[1:38:58] cma church
[1:38:59] it's like a few miles down this this
[1:39:01] real right here um
[1:39:03] i was actually you know how uh the cma
[1:39:06] chairs is they have like
[1:39:07] offices like president vice president
[1:39:09] stuff like that
[1:39:10] i was supposedly the their vice
[1:39:12] president of the the youth thing so i'm
[1:39:14] like
[1:39:14] okay this then pastor jesse he has god
[1:39:18] you know what
[1:39:18] and our big theme over the big theme
[1:39:20] they had this year that year was um
[1:39:23] outreaching and go to different churches
[1:39:24] so i'm like okay let's take that
[1:39:26] literally let's go to pastor jesse's
[1:39:27] church
[1:39:28] so i took the whole entire youth we took
[1:39:31] the entire youth and we took
[1:39:32] everyone that we could and we went down
[1:39:34] to second service and pastor jesse
[1:39:36] preached a
[1:39:37] amazing sermon i remember it was um all
[1:39:40] the
[1:39:41] denominations and religions came from
[1:39:43] cain
[1:39:44] and he preached about a lot of things
[1:39:46] about like sin and stuff like that and
[1:39:48] after that service i'm like wow i'm
[1:39:50] going to go out for prayer because
[1:39:52] that's when you went
[1:39:52] and you said um anyone wants to give a
[1:39:54] prayer we'll pray for i'm like
[1:39:56] i want to go up i'm going to go up first
[1:39:58] and i went up first
[1:39:59] and uh i got prayed for i'm like after
[1:40:02] that
[1:40:03] we i took the youth group right after
[1:40:05] that we all went to burger king
[1:40:06] and we were all talking about the word
[1:40:08] we're like wow this is so
[1:40:09] amazing no one ever preaches against sin
[1:40:12] or
[1:40:12] um or how to live holy and we were just
[1:40:16] it just felt like we were all washed
[1:40:18] clean and had like white robes
[1:40:20] like wow it just felt so nice and clean
[1:40:23] and
[1:40:24] so that following week uh yeah
[1:40:27] that following week our our pastor at
[1:40:30] the cma church he came up to
[1:40:32] our our leader uh and he went and he
[1:40:35] told us
[1:40:36] that we're not allowed to go to any
[1:40:38] churches that are not cma
[1:40:40] because they preach false doctrines so
[1:40:42] we weren't allowed to come to your
[1:40:44] pastor jesse's church anymore so um
[1:40:47] during that time
[1:40:49] so uh during a little uh after that like
[1:40:52] maybe a few months
[1:40:54] um i went and i started talking to my
[1:40:56] wife
[1:40:57] and the first thing we did was actually
[1:41:00] there was an
[1:41:01] event we had and they invited a bunch of
[1:41:03] youth groups from out of state
[1:41:06] and we had this big event and we were at
[1:41:08] someone's house fellowshipping right
[1:41:10] and then my my wife who was sitting on
[1:41:12] the stairs
[1:41:13] i sat on the stairs next year and we
[1:41:15] were just talking and i was like
[1:41:16] i was talking like you know what pastor
[1:41:18] jesse baptized me
[1:41:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:41:21] i don't feel the same anymore it just
[1:41:23] feels different
[1:41:24] and that you're like yeah he got he
[1:41:26] baptized me in the name of lord jesus
[1:41:27] christ and we're like no way
[1:41:29] and we started talking about the bible
[1:41:31] and that she started talking about
[1:41:33] serpenty i'm like
[1:41:34] what is serpent seed i don't know what
[1:41:36] that is but i'm gonna look in the
[1:41:37] website and see what google says about
[1:41:38] it you know
[1:41:40] so i didn't i didn't find much about it
[1:41:42] but i'm like okay it sounds like
[1:41:44] it can come come from the bible i'll
[1:41:46] believe it if it's preaching in the
[1:41:47] bible
[1:41:48] and that's the first uh thing my wife
[1:41:50] taught me was serpency
[1:41:52] about it so i'm praise the lord for that
[1:41:55] so um
[1:41:58] so after after that we had another youth
[1:42:00] event
[1:42:02] that we did and um this time
[1:42:05] um this time um we were doing devotion
[1:42:09] and i i wanted to lead devotion so i
[1:42:12] went
[1:42:12] and i started teaching them that the
[1:42:15] only way to be correctly baptized is in
[1:42:17] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:42:20] and after that everyone was like shocked
[1:42:23] and like the the two uh supervisors that
[1:42:26] are watching us
[1:42:27] they came out right after after service
[1:42:29] and they were like
[1:42:31] why you preach that what are you talking
[1:42:33] about the holy ghost told me
[1:42:34] this and this is correct way i'm like
[1:42:36] and i was so upset i'm like
[1:42:39] why are you guys going against me this
[1:42:41] is the word of god this is right here in
[1:42:43] the bible
[1:42:44] and at that time i just knew it i'm like
[1:42:46] you know what i'm going to stop going to
[1:42:47] this church
[1:42:48] and i told my wife we weren't married
[1:42:50] yet but i told her you know
[1:42:52] i'm not going to go to that church
[1:42:52] anymore i don't go to pastor jesse
[1:42:54] church
[1:42:55] because that's the truth so that's what
[1:42:57] we did so we went to your church
[1:42:59] um 2014 at the end of the year
[1:43:02] 2015 and um we did a lot of bible
[1:43:06] studies every week i remember those
[1:43:08] those are amazing
[1:43:09] and then after that i i had to get a new
[1:43:13] job so i went to
[1:43:14] school for about four months for my
[1:43:16] current job and we stopped having bible
[1:43:18] studies but um
[1:43:19] during that time i did get a good job
[1:43:21] and i
[1:43:23] i i got that job and i went and i bought
[1:43:26] this new car which this is my car back
[1:43:28] home right now
[1:43:29] and uh my dad was really upset at me
[1:43:32] because i left the hmong church at first
[1:43:34] he was really um upset because i bought
[1:43:36] a new car i'm like okay but
[1:43:39] i'm a grown man i can buy a car you know
[1:43:41] so then
[1:43:42] i was telling my dad like what's the
[1:43:44] real reason why you're mad at me and
[1:43:45] he's like because you left our church to
[1:43:47] go to
[1:43:48] pastor jesse's church and i just told
[1:43:50] him i'm like no i
[1:43:52] i know that god's with pastor jesse and
[1:43:55] i'm following the truth no matter what
[1:43:57] and we got to this big argument and i
[1:43:58] was just telling and i just felt the
[1:44:00] whole time
[1:44:01] no matter what happens i'm going to
[1:44:03] follow jesus
[1:44:04] even though all my family betrayed me
[1:44:06] stabbed me in the back i'm still
[1:44:08] following jesus
[1:44:09] and that night my dad kicked me out of
[1:44:11] the house and
[1:44:13] i called pastor jesse and i'd really
[1:44:15] thank god for passage justin his wife
[1:44:17] for
[1:44:18] letting me save you guys for a whole
[1:44:19] month so thank you guys for that
[1:44:22] so um i stayed with them for a whole
[1:44:24] month
[1:44:25] and uh during that time i got an
[1:44:28] apartment
[1:44:28] and um when i got an apartment this was
[1:44:31] like 2015
[1:44:33] in september um i started having a lot
[1:44:36] of dreams
[1:44:38] like this the devil was attacking me
[1:44:40] constantly
[1:44:41] every the whole month was like every
[1:44:43] time i closed my eyes even for like
[1:44:45] five minutes i was attacked every single
[1:44:48] night
[1:44:49] and pastor jesse was and we were praying
[1:44:51] constantly
[1:44:52] and um so pretty much i went to third
[1:44:55] shift
[1:44:55] 2015 and uh
[1:44:58] we went about three years in 2018 i was
[1:45:01] working
[1:45:02] third shift and during that whole time
[1:45:04] it was like um
[1:45:05] that's like how uh the israelites they
[1:45:07] came out of egypt right and then they
[1:45:09] went to the wilderness that's what it
[1:45:10] was for me
[1:45:11] those three years were like the
[1:45:12] wilderness for me going out in the
[1:45:13] wilderness
[1:45:14] i was like still in the world but i was
[1:45:16] still going to the message church and
[1:45:18] this is where my wife and i we were we
[1:45:20] were struggling like i knew
[1:45:22] that going to this church was the right
[1:45:24] way so
[1:45:25] i'm going to follow no matter what even
[1:45:27] if i can't live it now and my wife
[1:45:29] so many times he just wanted to quit so
[1:45:30] he's like no i can't do this anymore
[1:45:33] this is too hard i just told her just
[1:45:35] keep doing it you know we left our old
[1:45:37] church we're not going back there
[1:45:38] you know we're coming here and then we
[1:45:41] pressed on and then
[1:45:42] we prayed and i actually got a job i i
[1:45:45] still did my
[1:45:45] current job but actually got moved to
[1:45:48] second shift
[1:45:49] so that i wasn't missing service every
[1:45:51] week every other week so this was
[1:45:52] amazing but this was 2018
[1:45:54] and 2018 was the year god really
[1:45:57] completely
[1:45:58] changed my life around um
[1:46:01] 2018 was um i got
[1:46:05] moved to second shift and then we had
[1:46:08] that flood that happened the church
[1:46:10] had that flood and then during that time
[1:46:12] we all went to the ymca
[1:46:14] and then um i i just felt let
[1:46:17] like i just want to sing some songs you
[1:46:18] know since we don't have any instruments
[1:46:20] i'll just come up and sing some songs
[1:46:21] and
[1:46:22] i started song leading at the ymca for a
[1:46:24] bit and then we had uh
[1:46:26] you were gone for a week to preach
[1:46:28] somewhere else and brother brian came
[1:46:30] and she preached the word to us and he
[1:46:32] preaches about finding your position in
[1:46:34] god
[1:46:34] and after he preached that sherman i
[1:46:36] just knew that i had to uh
[1:46:38] god wanted me to be here song leading
[1:46:40] and that's where i found my position
[1:46:42] right here
[1:46:43] so after that after that a few months
[1:46:47] after still in 2018 around october
[1:46:50] i was listening to a bunch of sermons
[1:46:51] from brother branham and i was at work
[1:46:53] listening to it and uh i was listening
[1:46:55] to as an ego stir
[1:46:56] as wings in the nest or something like
[1:46:58] that and um
[1:47:00] i just after it got done listening to it
[1:47:01] i'm like wow i know i'm an ego
[1:47:04] i'm not a chicken i'm an ego and i'm
[1:47:07] like
[1:47:08] i need the holy ghost at that time i was
[1:47:10] sick i was seeking the holy ghost for a
[1:47:12] while now but then at that specific time
[1:47:14] i wanted the holy ghost
[1:47:15] so that whole week i i constantly
[1:47:17] listened to a sherman every single day
[1:47:19] and i went through uh i think three
[1:47:21] different tests
[1:47:23] like the first test was like on a
[1:47:24] thursday night where i listened to a
[1:47:26] sermon from brother branham and he
[1:47:28] talked about the statute of the perfect
[1:47:29] man
[1:47:29] and he said you have to have a portion
[1:47:33] of everything right
[1:47:34] and i'm like i don't have a portion of
[1:47:35] anything of all those links i'm like
[1:47:38] the how am i gonna get the holy ghost if
[1:47:39] i don't have all these things
[1:47:41] and i didn't i just kept praying about
[1:47:42] it and then the following night
[1:47:45] i remember uh praying and god told god
[1:47:47] was telling me
[1:47:48] think about um remember peter and mary
[1:47:51] and all the disciples were all in the
[1:47:53] upper room
[1:47:54] and they all received the holy ghost
[1:47:55] after they prayed i'm like okay i have
[1:47:57] to wait
[1:47:58] and pray to god so the following day
[1:48:00] which was on a saturday
[1:48:02] we went to go visit a family member and
[1:48:04] they were very uh
[1:48:06] very critical towards our church and i
[1:48:09] was really upset but i
[1:48:10] i couldn't really say anything because i
[1:48:13] felt like i was being tested
[1:48:14] because you know you can't receive the
[1:48:16] holy ghost if you don't have brother you
[1:48:17] love
[1:48:18] you know so i i went i had got i got
[1:48:21] tested from that and
[1:48:22] i didn't say anything come out of line
[1:48:25] or anything
[1:48:26] and then the following day pastor jesse
[1:48:28] was out preaching somewhere else and
[1:48:30] brother simon came but then he came like
[1:48:32] five minutes late
[1:48:33] he came out 11 05 and we already and i
[1:48:36] was like one it was a really small
[1:48:38] service like
[1:48:39] and my sister connie was still here and
[1:48:42] oh
[1:48:42] sister nominee was here and sister wendy
[1:48:44] was here and it was only
[1:48:46] my brain was here it was that was it
[1:48:47] that was a very small group
[1:48:49] brother simon came in like very a bit
[1:48:51] late and he came in and
[1:48:52] we we did some songs and then he started
[1:48:54] preaching about you know the latter rain
[1:48:56] and
[1:48:56] you need to be filled with the holy
[1:48:58] ghost and be born again right so um
[1:49:00] after service i'm like okay i want to be
[1:49:03] prayed for
[1:49:04] for the holy ghost so i went up and i i
[1:49:07] sat up right there and i was looking at
[1:49:08] tv and
[1:49:09] i felt satan tell me oh you can get the
[1:49:11] holy ghost we can get it next week or
[1:49:13] next month
[1:49:14] you'll get a dollar uh you'll get it
[1:49:16] further down the road
[1:49:17] and i just told i just told myself and
[1:49:19] saying i'm like no i want the holy ghost
[1:49:21] now i'm gonna get it right now
[1:49:23] so so this was the time uh
[1:49:26] brother simon was going to go to
[1:49:28] thailand
[1:49:30] and uh i knocked at the door and he was
[1:49:32] praying and then i told him
[1:49:33] hey i want to be prayed for for the holy
[1:49:35] ghost so
[1:49:36] we were standing there and he was
[1:49:38] praying for me i'm like praise the lord
[1:49:40] and i don't i didn't really feel
[1:49:41] anything at the moment it's like
[1:49:42] okay now we're gonna go down and you're
[1:49:45] gonna we're gonna be on our knees and
[1:49:46] i'm gonna put my hand on your back and
[1:49:48] he started praying for me
[1:49:49] and i received the holy ghost then and i
[1:49:52] i still remember it i'm like
[1:49:53] all i could say was thank you jesus
[1:49:55] you're so merciful that's all i said
[1:49:57] like for like
[1:49:58] five ten minutes straight it was just
[1:50:01] uh just some amazing just to be filled
[1:50:04] with the holy ghost it's so different
[1:50:06] it just feels so amazing i guess honest
[1:50:09] i don't want to say it
[1:50:10] so uh after that uh
[1:50:14] after that um after that a few months
[1:50:18] passed
[1:50:18] and then i was starting to listen to a
[1:50:20] lot of prophecy videos from
[1:50:22] a lot of different other people like
[1:50:24] that are not in the message church but
[1:50:26] like are in denominations and stuff like
[1:50:28] that there's this website
[1:50:29] where they post like oh prophecies we
[1:50:31] got from god we hear from god
[1:50:33] and um there's this one prophecy that
[1:50:35] came forth was
[1:50:36] the three days of darkness and i didn't
[1:50:38] know what that was
[1:50:39] but then when i heard it i'm like wow
[1:50:42] this sounds really
[1:50:43] scary and like it
[1:50:46] it was uh i remember we were sleeping at
[1:50:49] night and i was listening to that
[1:50:50] and it shook me so bad that my wife woke
[1:50:54] up at four o'clock in the morning while
[1:50:56] i was still awake because i was still
[1:50:57] shook by the video cause i was i was
[1:50:59] scared nervous i'm like
[1:51:01] man if this three days of darkness is
[1:51:03] happening like very soon oh my gosh
[1:51:06] we're not ready for this and i was
[1:51:08] really shook and my wife was
[1:51:10] my wife was um woke up too and we were
[1:51:13] like oh my gosh and we both decided to
[1:51:15] call work the following day
[1:51:16] because we we were so nervous and so
[1:51:20] we didn't know how to process this thing
[1:51:22] and that at that time we were praying
[1:51:24] i started praying for my wife i'm like
[1:51:26] you know hon you're not even ready to go
[1:51:28] in the rapture what the rapture happened
[1:51:30] like
[1:51:30] instantly you know you won't be ready
[1:51:32] you know you need to get the holy ghost
[1:51:34] and i'm like at that time my wife was
[1:51:36] still uh wearing pants at work i'm like
[1:51:38] the only thing you're lacking is
[1:51:40] you gotta stop wearing pants at the
[1:51:41] church and i'm not pants at work and
[1:51:43] then
[1:51:44] you'll receive the holy ghost because
[1:51:45] that's the only thing she was lacking on
[1:51:47] and
[1:51:47] that night that following day uh we went
[1:51:50] to pastor jesse's house
[1:51:52] and we talked about the three days of
[1:51:53] darkness and how it's
[1:51:55] it doesn't really line up with scripture
[1:51:57] even though they i really learned
[1:51:58] that even though someone has like the
[1:52:01] holy ghost on them
[1:52:02] if it's not in the word then they're
[1:52:04] just it's not really from god
[1:52:06] you know and i really learned how to um
[1:52:08] divide it divide the word and
[1:52:09] make sure it's based off of scripture so
[1:52:12] um
[1:52:13] after that after that uh that following
[1:52:16] sunday
[1:52:16] i remember pastor jesse was praying here
[1:52:18] and he was praying i'll let the
[1:52:20] let the king come down here and come
[1:52:22] down and join us and
[1:52:24] and then after service i remember my
[1:52:25] sister went here lydia came up and my
[1:52:27] wife was here we all
[1:52:29] were around the circle right here and we
[1:52:31] were all praying for the holy ghost for
[1:52:32] lydia and
[1:52:33] for my wife and then my wife got the
[1:52:36] holy ghost right there too
[1:52:38] this was um april 2019 i believe
[1:52:41] it was it was a perfect birthday present
[1:52:43] you know so from god
[1:52:44] i gotta say so um so after that
[1:52:48] after that we my wife and i we went on
[1:52:50] this big
[1:52:51] um oh the rapture's coming the rapture's
[1:52:54] coming
[1:52:55] jesus is gonna take us away and we went
[1:52:57] through this big season of
[1:52:59] listening to a lot of uh things people
[1:53:01] were saying like the dreams they had
[1:53:04] the visions the the um prophecies
[1:53:06] they've been having
[1:53:07] you know even we got a few ones from
[1:53:10] ourselves that jesus told us she's
[1:53:12] coming this is the time of the rapture
