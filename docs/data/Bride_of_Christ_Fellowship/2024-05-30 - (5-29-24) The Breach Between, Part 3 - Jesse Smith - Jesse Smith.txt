========================================

part three Revelation chapter 5 verse one by God's grace Revelation 5 verse one Revelation 5 verse1 I've been in contact with brother McBride so we're looking forward to having him come and he'll be here on the weekend of the 22nd and 23rd we'll probably have like I said just a couple special prayer meetings in there and in preparation for our brother coming it's our 18th anniversary Services by God's grace to me might not mean much to you but it means a lot to me because I think back in WoW God's carried me for 18 years Hallelujah he's held me steady so I wouldn't fall just another one of those Miracles hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said to him is who is able to keep you from falling hallelujah thank God for his grace and mercy Hallelujah so Revelation chapter 5 uh verse one by God's grace I'm going to start with a thought brother Paul preached and I got uh I got a message from the east or I'm sorry yeah the West Coast rather um a person who listened in and was just blessed by that sermon uh Sunday morning and then I'm sure we're all blessed by the Sunday evening service but uh that brother brother was he said it brought him such joy to hear about the New Covenant just the Simplicity of it and he was so happy he sang me a song on there he was clapping and singing I'm like Glory you're making me happy you know but just amazing to see you know can preach it here in Ohio they can get it out there on the west coast and send it back to me encourage me on a Wednesday morning you know so uh it's a blessing to see how God uses technology and also to how he spreads the word of God hallelujah so Revelation 5 vers1 we'll just read verses one and two by God's grace when brother R preached this you know he spent uh quite a while just on the first verse as we're as we're looking at these last few weeks with Revelation 10 and the Book of Ruth um and Jeremiah you know brother Ram talked all that on verse one that was all on verse one so he spends the majority on verse one and then he spends the rest of the time on verse two down through the end believe it's uh 14 so let's read verse 1 and 2 together one 2 3 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof amen sounds good with all these voices in here hallelujah let's have a word of prayer if you have any need on your heart let's make it known unto God here father God we thank you for tonight Lord God we're thankful Lord God that we can cast our cares on you we can count our blessings because you care for us Lord God we're thankful for your love your mercy thank you for providing all things Lord thank you for taking our uh weights Lord of burdens Lord thank you God that we can cast them on you because you care for us Lord God hallelujah so Lord just take this word here tonight that we've read Lord and just break it to your people as we bring out the truth of the scripture and father I know we'll be bless when we leave this place father so we thank you for your mercy and Grace in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen God bless bless you you being seated praise God all right so I'm going just briefly review um last week you know we had the next weekend there um last week we looked at how brother Brandon brought out the idea of serpent seed out of chapter 5 and the idea that reveals the serpent seed is that uh no man was worthy to even look upon the book no man at all and so uh and then we know of course the story how a lamb comes forth and we know that lamb was Jesus Christ he was born of a virgin so brother BR brings this out that it had to been the seed of the woman it could not been a seed of a man had been the seed of a woman which is the Holy Ghost giving the woman a seed right Mary Allelujah the Holy Ghost gave Mary the seed of Jesus right uh nothing to do with Joseph and Mary it was all God hallelujah it's called the Immaculate Conception hallelujah amen and so brother BR says serpent seed is in plain view in chapter 5 because Jesus Jesus is the only virgin born uh man person Hallelujah he's the Divine person the sinless one Hallelujah the Son of God hallelujah the son of man son of David Hallelujah and so we looked at that as element of it and we saw how sin came in the world through lust so second Peter 1:4 tells us that that's how sin entered the world of course it was Eve's lust uh we'd say of the adulterous act with the serpent now brother Bram said that's the killer that Doctrine is the killer that one was separate almost all Fellowship unless people got a lot of Grace in their heart right uh but that's okay because we know the scriptures praise God we know that eating an apple doesn't cause anybody to know they're naked right and we know all of God's we know those nine proofs don't we Hallelujah we know uh every time every uh consequence was in reproduction right so God doesn't just give consequences unless there's a meaning to them so Eve sinned with her reproductive organs that's why God uh gave the consequ is there Hallelujah and that's why here in Revelation 5 only one person's worthy it had to be someone who was not born of the seat of a man had to be born the seed of God hallelujah God gave it to the woman right God gave it to Eve Hallelujah so it's beautiful thought there I never you know I it's been it's been a while since I listened to the sermon and I told you for the last maybe 10 years or so I put that thought on the Shelf brother Ram would say when when the Seven Seals were loose the serpent seed was revealed and brother William I scratched my head for 10 years I don't get it I'm just putting that up on the shelf and then two Sunday mornings ago God gave me the understanding as I'm driving to church amen that we see the serpent seed in chapter five it was a virgin born Christ Hallelujah it couldn't have been born of a man a woman had to been a virgin uh virgin born and so uh beautiful how you just lay things up on the shelf and God will answer in his time and season Hallelujah so we're thankful for that and then we saw how God purchased the church uh with his creative blood and that's what we saw in Revelation 5 a lamb that's bloody as it had been slain and we saw that's not Jewish blood that's not Gentile blood that's the creative blood of God hallelujah that's according to acts 20: 28 and then we looked at Jeremiah Hallelujah this is a beautiful double type here in Jeremiah of how uh the Scrolls had to be uh they had to have evidences of the purchase so the land had to be purchased from uh Jeremiah's uncle if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that one maybe it's uncle's son but uh there had to be an Evidence of the purchase and then the evidence had to be sealed until a later time that it could be possessed at a later time and brother Bram said that spoke of Christ Hallelujah Christ had to pay the price he had to die Hallelujah and then he had to be buried away amen for three days amen hallelujah then he had to rise and then the The Possession could be could could be possessed right then the promises the the the Revelation could be revealed on the day of Pentecost amen 50 days later Hallelujah on the day of Pentecost uh we we say the Revelation was made known and then the Believers could possess the promises Hallelujah now the other type is for our day let me say it like this this this might be a little uh new to you but the Bible had to be written John had to write the Book of Revelation and then it had to just lay dormant for a while right we never had thus sayith the Lord on the Book of Revelation or the S con seals had to lay dormant for almost 2,000 years until God brought that back up and gave the Revelation to brother brandham brother Ram gives us the Revelation says that's thus sayith the Lord and now we can possess the promises of God hallelujah amen my glory that's beautiful see it's a double uh compound prophecy Hallelujah that's Jeremiah 3214 and 15 pardon me are the main verses I think it's 6 through 15 so it's just a beautiful type there of Pentecost uh and then also the opening of The Seven seal book in Revelation chapter 5 six and then it goes to 8 and 10 we see this book open praise God oh what a beautiful Revelation my that all make us happy tonight Hallelujah and then we ended with brother R's Story how the lion roaring you know John looked and saw he looked for a lion but he seen a lamb and brother R said that's God hiding himself in Simplicity there's a little bloody lamb there with seven horns and seven eyes and God says that's a lion hallelujah amen other words there's power there's boldness in the Lamb of God hallelujah right didn't Jesus say all power and authority is given unto me hallelujah amen so he looks weak like a lamb like a lamb that's been slain but he's got the mighty power of God he's got Authority Hallelujah and if Jesus tells us one word then all all all creation will have to to submit itself to that word nothing can stop that word that word cannot return void hallelujah amen see that boness behind the lamb see the lion behind the lamb Hall right oh it's beautiful praise God and brother BR said uh he said that's what happens he told that story of going out in the African jungles and all the animals were squealing and and all the bugs were making noises but as soon as that line roared everything shut up and brother bam said that's when denominations and doubts fall to the ground when we get thus sayeth the Lord from the Bible hallelujah amen brother bam said thus sayith the Lord if you haven't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be re-baptized he said because the father son holy ghost is a false baptism thus sayith the Lord hallelujah because we got five Bible examples in the book of Acts Hallelujah where they only use the name of the Lord the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ Hallelujah so it's the Revelation that's the name of God there is one name to the father son Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and what can the denomination say nothing those say I'll just take Jesus word they can't give you a verse to prove you wrong because nobody can say anything to the lion hallelujah amen everything's shuts up to the line everything bows to the line Hallelujah everything bows to this word we've been given Hallelujah I know that's bold but we should be bold as the righteous are B is a line Hallelujah right amen hallelujah thank God now that's what we want in our lives church we want to receive a word from God don't you you and I want to receive a word from God when we need it and then everything else in our life will will calm down right all the doubts will calm down Glory all the threats will calm down Amen brother says all the threats all the lies uh all the mocking right all the criticism it will all silence because God's given us thus sayith the Lord hallelujah amen such a blessing Hallelujah now that's a short little review there Hallelujah I used to do longer reviews in that but I'm gonna I'm going to stop right there uh I want to bring out this thought brother Paul preached such amazing Revelation and uh I agree there's eight covenants in fact I wrote in my book in 2021 so here he comes three years later later and you'd be surprised most people say there's only seven covenants but I was different than everybody I read online I think there's eight and here Paul comes and says there's eight you know covenants not that he's God or anything but I just what a nice Vindication there that we can see it but he brought out this amazing thought that all these covenants that were given were given by God and they still maintain to today right unless they were broken but there's a spiritual application to them for us in the New Covenant and church that was one of those mind-blowing moments that was another great Revelation there i' never seen it like that before so get your Bibles handy um in case you get get get your uh fingers handy on the keyboard uh Matthew 6:33 the first Covenant is the Eden Covenant or we call it edenic Covenant if you know if you're a reader uh reading the preachers and so forth of uh you know commentaries and of course it's not in Matthew 633 but the Eden Covenant was given to Adam and Eve before any sin had entered and remember what they given in Genesis 1 Dominion that means rule you rule the Earth because we know Satan was there Satan was kicked out of heaven Michael kicked him out right a third of the Angels lost to the two-thirds of the angels yet the Bible says there's innumerable Angels so that's an innumerable 2third Hallelujah you can't number that two-thirds Hallelujah but they were given dominion and then Adam was overcome Adam and Eve were both overcome but Adam knew what he was doing Eve was deceived in the transgression Adam willingly gave it over and the Bible said because he did that whoever you overcome by you become enslaved to in second Peter chapter 2 and so Adam and all Humanity became slaves to sin Hallelujah but Jesus came and he paid the price for all of our sins Hallelujah and he took back all that Adam lost Jesus had full control he said I could call 12 Legions of of angels but I got to wait for the father that's right he said I don't do anything except the father shows me first amen what should we do amen we should only do what the father shows us first Hallelujah God help us all amen God help me amen that's what I need Hallelujah to wait on God to see what to do first about it Hallelujah but Adam lost that and Jesus got it back Hallelujah and then he says the works that I do in John 14:12 you shall do also amen Glory Hallelujah maybe this summer Lord I want to preach some more sermons on raising our faith Hallelujah might have to break out that Mighty Man series we need some mighty men and women don't we Hallelujah to come against the battles and trials that we Face amen because when we really face him I won't be laughing Hallelujah you won't be laughing when you really got a real a real trial Hallelujah I wasn't laughing you know when I go through these trials Hallelujah but the point I want to bring out is Jesus brought it back because he lived obedient life to every word of God and so he had the fullness of sunship back that Adam lost and then he said what I do you're going to do I'm giving you the keys to the kingdom amen hallelujah so we got Dominion back the Bible said Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God so every day we got to seek the Dominion back Glory we got to seek the rulership of the kingdom of God back Lord let it be present in my life help me to rule over sin help me to rule over Temptations help me to cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God and then uh you know Luke 17:21 Jesus says the kingdom of God is within you that's why Jesus came to bring us a portion of this Ed inate Covenant back into our lives Hallelujah the Bible says we can have peace that passes all understanding Jesus even said I'm leaving you my peace not like a a not like a portion of Peace but the peace of God hallelujah what a blessing amen that he's willing to leave this for us but he says this kingdom is within you this Dominion is within you amen and church and then we saw you know uh in Mark 11:23 Casa uh Jesus said if you speak to that mountain if you don't doubt in your heart that mountain will move amen hallelujah right but we found out this ain't speaking of natural mountains right it's speaking of just any obstacles in your life Hallelujah see whoever shall say this mountain be thou removed and be cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which shall he say it shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and you know just apply this to the book of Acts I just read it this morning Peter said such as I have Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have give I Thee rise up in the name of Jesus Christ see the mountain of Paralis had to move Hallelujah the mountain of not being able to walk has to move now how many want to see God move like that Hallelujah we got to draw closer to God draw closer to God he'll draw closer to us amen glory see he moved the mountain of of of a paralyzed body Hallelujah now Zechariah 4:7 is a little more applicable maybe to us because remember church God gave the apostles many the most Mighty signs and wonders and miracles they were given to the apostles the Bible's Plain on that in the book of Acts that doesn't we still can't have them we can have them Hallelujah but it's got to be ordained of God right like I just saw that picture from 2020 it was July what 18 2020 well that would have been A's birthday but anyways that was when brother uh uh Brian Hawkins was there we went to the youth meeting right I took Lydia I think Lydia and I we even had McDonald's on the way home didn't we Lydia believe that can you believe that poisoned ourselves that's the last time we poisoned ourselves like that I'm getting that bad look there sorry Dar I thought I told you but anyways at that meeting you know brother Brian and I were talking I'm like brother how you doing he's like you know uh my doctor said I got to get my hips replaced and I'm like what you got get your hip hips replaced you remember the story right and he was sad like he was really upset I don't know lyd and I must have been in the spirit I don't know what were we singing we must have been singing some Hallelujah songs on the way to church Hallelujah cuz if it was even before the preaching even before the preaching we're just doing that remember you guys did the game The Guess Who game or whatever more he was going to he's crying there and I'm I just I felt I just felt like an anointing came on me I just felt like heaven came down on me it doesn't it's only happened two two two times in my life I think two or three and I could it's like I could feel his pain like I didn't want to see a father with five children have double hip replacement surgery and I'm like brother I said it was right after uh God healed haua and Z's dad there for that portion it's right after that I said brother you don't have to you're 45 you shouldn't have to do that I said brother let's pray I said I want to speak life unto you something like that I I can't remember all the details that doesn't matter the details well the major point is that God healed him Hallelujah I said get your pastor I said brother Jim you know brother Jim he likes to preach about dancing Hallelujah we found that out didn't we last yeah last year we found that out he likes to preach about dancing Glory uh I said brother I said do you have any sins you need to confess he said no I said well let's pray I just met we were both crying it a simple I said I speak life into those hips in the name of Jesus Christ three days later uh four days later on the Tuesday I'm out pulling weeds for my dear wife on The Garden which I don't do much anymore but I used to and uh I'm listening to brother Ram tell talk about my new ministry and brother Brian texts me and says we just got new scans my hips have healed themselves the doctor said this has never happened before that wasn't me speaking life that was God that's a mountain that had to move Hallelujah so I just Rejoice we put on Facebook and hallelujah amen it's it's not my word it's God's word hallelujah and that's just a great example now a more practical might be uh Zechariah 47 we read this a few weeks ago this was a great Revelation to me who who art thou oh great mountain now what was the mount the mountain was 16 years of inactivity they hadn't finished the temple they built the altar first they started building the Temple they they got afraid by some political threats right so they stopped for 16 years and God says this is a mountain but what is a mountain compared to God Amen what is a mountain what is the obstacle what is man's politics and man's government compared to the Heavenly government amen it's nothing it's just a small it's just a mountain and so God says speak to that mountain zable hallelujah it's not by might not by power but by the Holy Spirit sayeth the Lord it's still on the Eden it Covenant so I'm probably going to have a part four here by God's grace just can't get past this series amen hallelujah but you understand this is a church building that's not finished and God calls it a mountain and those mountains can move by the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen amen so let's remember that by God's grace this week or heading in the next week and seemed like you know like I said with Simon's text there about threats and so for it seems like God is always preparing us for what we got to go through if I say like this just let me say it real humble if we're listening we'll hear it God will prepare us I I believe that God will prepare us if we're listening you see I wasn't what I'm saying is I wasn't listening like I ought to have been I was just going about life but now I can look back and see yes God was gracious he was being kind to me Hallelujah all right so there we go now can you see how the Dominion is brought back in the New Testament very plain right very plain now I'm going to go a little faster hopefully the Adam Covenant or adamic Covenant remember what was that after the fall God gave adam a covenant and Eve right Adam uh of course well I'm going to focus on Eve here because this one applies to us God told Eve your desire is going to be for your husband well that means that her desire wasn't for her husband before it's for the serpent right and the Bible said and now they're to be married right and bring forth and reproduce and everything fruitful multiply Hallelujah that's where we're trying to get to but Romans 7:4 says we were married to the law of death but the Bible said that's D the law is dead to you now you ought to be married to Christ amen hallelujah so see the adamant Covenant speaks of marriage and fruitfulness and now the Bible says we're married to him we should bring forth fruit unto God there it is amen hallelujah isn't that beautiful my I just never seen it till Paul preached it there the edate Covenant has a type for us the adamant Covenant has a type for us Glory Hallelujah is that beautiful and of course we don't have to read it but Ephesians chapter 5 husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and wives you submit to your husbands in everything in the Lord as long as it's fit in the Lord hallelujah husbands cherish your wives wash them in the watering of the word amen see husbands we ought to do everything we can to improve the spiritual condition of our wives amen hallelujah and Wise you ought to do everything you can do to obey your husbands in the word of God hallelujah that's right amen that's what Christians do now the third one is the Noah Covenant or I can't even say that one Noah I can't even say that one I don't even know if that's a word or not but this was the this was the one that really blew my mind too I like I never thought about that there's an element to that that carries over to the New Testament Luke 17:26 if you got your Bible very familiar to us remember Luke 20 or 1721 was the kingdom of God within you remember that this is a beautiful chapter I've been making note of these some of these chapters they're power packed chapters Hallelujah all verse 26 so here we get this element of the noic Covenant to our day as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the son of man Hallelujah they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all so they just kept living life till destruction came they didn't recognize the prophet of God hallelujah my amen glory they they didn't recognize the man the Bible said Noah found Grace in the sight of God no one else found Grace because Noah is a preacher of righteousness hallelujah oh thank God that we found Grace hallelujah how many found it tonight by God's grace by God's grace you found God's grace amen hallelujah so we see this here everybody else was carried away they missed the signs of the end of the world because they're eating drinking and remember they were inter mearing too between Believers and unbelievers the sons of God saw those pretty Daughters of men but they were serpent seed Hallelujah now today it don't matter the natural seed it's the spiritual serpent seed your natural lineage and bloodline doesn't matter anything yeah you'll have some inherited traits and things you have to battle and so forth but that doesn't determine your Soul's destination the Soul's destination is you choose this day whom you will serve amen and all that the father has given me will come to me hallelujah amen all those that were predestinated for known chosen in Christ before the foundation world every one of those will be there on that day hallelujah how many believe you're one of them oh yeah I believe that Hallelujah I believe Jesus Christ wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen glory amen I believe that praise God why brother R says because you will hear the word of God you obey the word of God hallelujah other people just goes right over brother said if you don't obey in these little things everything else is going to go right over the top of your head and he's talking about little things like not wearing makeup and and brothers not growing your hair out and sisters not cutting your hair just the simple things in the Bible women not preaching just simple things if you miss it in the simple things you're going to miss the Rapture right of course to be to to go in Noah's day to be saved in Noah's day you had to get inside you had to get inside the safety zone amen oh we got a safety zone it's in Christ hallelujah amen the only place where Sav tonight is in Jesus Christ hallelujah amen brother said not a church brother Bron said if I've been given a message he said listen uh God provide a place of worship 1965 if God's giv me a message to call you out I got to have some place to point you he said I'm not going to point you to bradam Tabernacle he said that's just as bad as the rest of them he said but there is one place I can point you where you'll be safe and protected that's in Jesus Christ amen oh my and church you can I we and I you and I can be pointed to Christ Jesus tonight too Hallelujah because he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah well Glory so so what do we learn we got to make sure we marry the right person thank God Hallelujah so young people really listen up these next few years I know Lydia's listening real well I know Malachi's listening real well pretty soon we'll have some other teenagers they got to start listening real well Hallelujah because that that's part of it the days of Noah they missed on the marriage they married an unbeliever and then they got too busy eating and drinking and all those other cares of life and they forgot about judgment that was coming they forgot about the Holy Holiness preacher amen they forgot about the Holiness and the righteousness preacher Hallelujah Noah amen Glory verse 28 likewise also in the days of lot so it's a duel it's a dual Condition it's like Noah and lot right so Noah's day was immoral marriages between Believers and unbelievers lot's day was homosexuality right overtaking the land or the city rather likewise also was the days of lot so what is it perversion right they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it so again remember lot remember uh remember lot he needed a place to go and the Bible said his eyes caught Sodom and first he pinched his tent toward Sodom and then he sat then he lived in sodom's gate and then he became a leader in the gate so he lived right inside the city so this was a very prosperous City he let the prosperity of money pull him away from Abraham's seed and the promised son brother Ram says he forgot about the promised son because a building it says they bought they sold making a profit planting and all these things eating and drinking he forgot about the promised son Hallelujah same same thing so isn't that beautiful we see this Noah Covenant giving us a spiritual element in our day oh it's beautiful I I never saw that before verse 29 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus sh be in the day when the son of man is revealed now we believe that son of man was brother bram's prophetic Ministry that's what we believe Hallelujah because the son of man was already revealed to the Jews and the Samaritans in the Book of John Jesus's Earthly Ministry but that son of man Ministry never went to the Gentiles so God had to send it at the end time Hallelujah verse 31 in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it now I believe he's talking there I believe Jesus is talking to the foolish virgin remember Lot's wife right because Abraham wasn't even around Lot's wife how many Abraham seed we got here tonight Glory I am I got faith in Christ Hallelujah I believe the promise amen I'm circumcised by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah right he Abraham had the the Seal of circumcision we got the Holy Ghost circumcision we're Abraham's seed so this remember Lot's wife is for the foolish virgin don't get tempted to look back and say oh I you know I miss those things of the world and no just leave it in the past leave the sin things behind you leave that behind press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God Amen like Jesus said any man that takes the plow and looks back is not ready to work in the field is that right Glory don't look back at the pl life and say well maybe I should have not came out no you're free thank I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free Hallelujah I'm redeemed I'm already purchased out of the slave market I'm glad I'm out of the slave market amen but Mrs lot like I wonder if I should go back right brother now brother dramatized said maybe she was looking back at some of her children and grandchildren screaming and crying you know wouldn't that be difficult of course that'd be extremely difficult but the the the command was don't look back back right come out of it right and Jesus says this is what it'll be like at the end time and so see we've got to do that now here where we get the Rapture verse 34 I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one should be taken and the other shall be left verse 35 two women shall be grinding together the one should be taken the other left so see the Rapture is a universal thing it could be while you're sleeping could be while you're working right verse 36 two men should be in the field one should be taken and the other left now friends that has to be the Rapture because that doesn't apply to the tribulation period that don't even apply to sodom's day you didn't have you didn't have two people there and one was taken and one was left if you're in the city you got destroyed right so this has to be the Gentile Rapture Hallelujah it doesn't fit any other uh any other description now verse 37 is where we get the Eagles Gathering here and they answered and said to him where Lord and he said to them where so the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered he's talking about the end time he's talking about the son of man Hallelujah at the end time at Jesus coming the second coming he's talking about the Rapture and he says where is this going to happen Lord where the Eagles are gathered is where the carcass is the word of God the food of God we gather around the word we're eating the true word of God we're not eating Lutheran bread or Methodist bed bread or Baptist bread or CMA bread or Assembly of God bread or you know what I'm talking about we're not or or uh Apostolic bread or something like that we're eating the bread of the word of God hallelujah amen hallelujah now that's why my brother R I said Assembly of God because that's what I was raised in okay so no no offense to you buddy just so you know and uh you know and every church is different right so our church had that I was raised in had numerous false doctrines okay so that's why I bring that out by God's grace because that's that's what I was raised in but see I had to come out of that because they were trying to get me to speak in tongues to say that's the evidence now my opinion is that's not the evidence because I know lots of people that speak in tongues and they live contrary to the word of God openly right Hallelujah and on the day of Pentecost everybody understood their tongues right that's the great difference today Hallelujah so that's the church you know that's what I was raised in so I'm saying that for me Hallelujah that's what I was Raising like uh some of you went to the CMA Hallelujah right that's why I'm using those all right good now remember Jesus said just like it was the days of Noah he said few there be that find the narrow road Matthew 7:14 few just like Noah how many remember who how many got saved in Noah's day eight eight eight people got saved out of the whole world we got way more than eight here tonight we got double eight here tonight eight people made it eight people heard the preacher of righteousness eight people escaped uh the temptation to marry the wrong person the eating the drinking and the building eight people people escaped that thank God we're among those that have escaped Hallelujah the spirit of Sodom and the spirit of of of Noah's day thank God we've escaped that Hallelujah remember Noah day what what did the Bible say their thoughts were only evil continually all day long how many are thankful for a clean mind that you have that throughout the day while you're making pizza or while you're cooking you know you make good pizza by the way while you're making pizza while you're serving people while you're teaching children to drink ra or right like me you can actually think good thoughts how you actually have a good heart how can I help this person Lord give me a word to say or Lord G lead me to try to point this person to Christ how many glad that all day you just don't think about evil things all day long how can I take that or how can I how can I pull this trick here how can I do that aren't you glad you got a Pure Heart church what a difference between the Noah and the other group all all the Sinners did in Noah's day is think evil thoughts thank God we can think on the word of God oh Jesus how you going to save my mom how you going to save my dad hallelujah how you going to provide for me in this tough situation Lord how you going to do it I don't know how but you'll do it again Hallelujah you can actually think good thoughts Hallelujah but that was the world compared to Noah Noah had good thoughts preacher thoughts of righteousness living holy living right and the world had only evil thoughts continually Hallelujah now boy good the next Covenant remember was the abrahamic Covenant and the one that really applies us spiritually is Genesis 22:17 in case sure if you want to read that one thank you H you're doing a great job tonight as always that in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I multiply thy seed as the stars of Heaven and the as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies all right now I believe that literally applied to the founding fathers of America because they possessed a land that wasn't theirs and church we've been reading through their history these most these founding fathers were quoting the word every time they were comparing their freedom from Great Britain to Israel's freedom from Pharaoh in Egypt that was their rling cry that was their cry and that was their cry to end slavery in America in the 1800s 1863 the Emancipation Emancipation Proclamation sorry that was they were using scripture amen hallelujah they were finding themselves in the word of God hallelujah so I believe there is a natural element at least to the United States of America the founding of that now I'm not telling you to go down and claim that nice mansion that just got built down the road I'm not I'm not telling you that don't don't go that far uh for us though it's going to be spiritually possessing our bodies and our Tabernacles our tents our Our Land Hallelujah you want some Bible for that I'll give you some Matthew 12:29 yeah there's definitely a house brother Austin you got to possess brother now there might be a natural one later on brother but I can promise you you're going to possess this one hallelujah amen brother Mali there's a house you're going to possess buddy someday I'm not promising you I'm not promising you natural one but I'm sure by God's grace God will give you one if he teares but this is the house I'm talking about the house of your Tabernacle Hallelujah the house of your your I'm sorry your three room house Hallelujah of your of your being amen your body Spirit Soul that's what I'm talking about Hallelujah you'll possess the gates of the enemies hallelujah or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house is that right everybody see that Abraham SE will possess the gates of his enemy so there's an enemy in your thoughts you got to possess that gate if there's a sickness in your body you got to possess that gate Hallelujah if your soul is dead if your soul is not alive you got to possess that gate Hallelujah you got to surrender your soul and say Jesus give me your faith if you're full of unbelief say God pour your faith into my soul Hallelujah I want to possess this Hallelujah in other words I want you to possess me amen glory this is what Jesus says he's talking about demon-possessed people the Pharisees are saying how do you cast out Devils he said I I cast them out by the Finger of God glory that ties in with the next Covenant Hallelujah he said but if we want to get free I'm sorry if we want to keep the devil out we got to be so strong that when the enemy comes in we cast him out we don't let him in we don't let thoughts overcome our thinking amen we think the right thoughts and the church said am think the right that's what I need help with right that's what we all need help with it's a great reminder but you're Abraham seed you've got a promise to do it you've got a promise to overcome Hallelujah God gave you that Covenant Hallelujah you will overcome by the word of God hallelujah amen say that same chapter verse 43 44 45 It's A Beautiful chapter as well when the unclean spirits gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none next one then he saith I'll return into my house from whence I came out and when he's come he find it it empty swept and Garner see that's what happens when a devil leaves their thoughts right you get a clean mind it's all cleaned out there's no muck in there there's no dirt there's no leaven in there there's the Bible word amen there's no sin there no no leaven it's all clean you got clean thoughts and the church said clean thoughts that's what we want clean thoughts Hallelujah you're going to fight to do it but you can get it by God's grace just get that Holy Ghost broom out Hallelujah just start pushing all those bad thoughts out of there amen hallelujah then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they entered and dwell there and the last say of that man is worse than the first even so shall be unto uh this wicked generation now we've seen that different celebrities I'm not going to call names but you can probably remember which one ofes I was talking about there are certain celebrities the last few years have said they become Christians but then they've left the Christian faith and they're worse off now than they were before they're like publicly putting rituals on their on their platforms and they're calling themselves God before they didn't do that that's what happened if you get saved you know get all those evil thoughts out you just feed on the word word word it cleans it out but you need a strong man in there to keep the house safe Hallelujah you need a man called the Holy Ghost amen I know the strong man's name it's Jesus Jes Christ amen the Holy Ghost amen you got to get the Holy Ghost in that house and he protects the house Hallelujah that's why we know when we're really Holy Ghost filled Believers and we get delivered from addictions we cannot go back because if we go back it'll be seven times worse right that's we got to make sure we get the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost will clean out the house but the Holy Ghost wants to come in and live in there I'm going to come by I'm going to come and I'm going to take myat in this house Hallelujah so when the Devil comes knocking on the door the Holy Ghost gets up and said shoo right Boo devil right leave devil get out of here this house is occupied this house is claimed Hallelujah Jesus Christ has helped us he he's living with us and by his grace we possess the gates of the enemies hallelujah oh my glory praise God I'll give you a couple more here Second Corinthians 10:5 I'm just going to I'll just preach this thought I got to thank brother Paul for giving me a sermon hallelujah thank you brother for giving me that sermon Hallelujah I never seen this before this beautiful thought second Corinthians 105 casting out imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ leave that there now see what what happens with evil thoughts church is we become captive to them right in other words I can't shake this fear or I can't shake this greed or I can't shake this lust or this Envy or something like that or this hopelessness I can't shake it well we come in captivity to them I'm just talking about in our mind now not the soul I'm talking about the Mind everybody say mind just the mind but you got to remember you got a stronger one in the house Hallelujah wake Jesus up in the you got a stronger one in the boat amen stir up the gift of God start praising God start worshiping God stir up that strong man the strong man will bring that evil thought into captivity Hallelujah and then cast him out of the house hallelujah amen hallelujah this is our church I love this applies to all of us this is our daily battle right here possessing the gates of our enemies hallelujah amen and I think brother B preached it yeah those five gates conscience memory reason affection imagination and the other five gates uh see taste touch feel smell hear those are the the gates we got to conquer the church said every day when when did you when did you last get a day off Hallelujah you don't get many days off but Abraham's seed will possess the gates hallelujah amen because we're more than conquerors we got promises from our Father Abraham oh my we got precious promises the Bible says thank God Amen oh my I love this woo I never seen this before Oh My this one the brother preached my this was good the Mosaic Covenant see so if I ever do an updated version of my 2021 book I'm going to put this section in there so it's going to be even thicker brother William it's not thick enough it's got to be thicker just joking second Corinthians 3 vers1 so our brother brought it out so beautifully oh God in the Old Testament met Moses and he wrote the law with his finger on the tables of stone right but now do we begin to commend ourselves now Paul's talking about false preachers that were in Corinth and they had letters of recommendation recommending themselves talk about a bad recommendation oh you recommend this preacher I've heard this preacher is an awful preacher that's what they were getting they were getting awful preachers you're recommending this what does that say about you if you're recommend if you're recommending this preacher I don't say a lot of good things about you right or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of com accomodation from you next verse you are our epistle written in our hearts so Paul says we're not passing around letters of recommendation you're our letter of recommendation your life your live life that you live proves that this gospel is Right amen the life you live for Jesus proves I'm a real preacher Hallelujah if you don't live it then either I'm not preaching it or you're not living it amen cuz I'm it by God's grace amen I know you want it too Hallelujah you want to live it but the people's lives should be the letters of recommendation you should come to this church hallelujah amen we don't have to pass out uh letters of recommendation here's a letter recommending my father Mal don't have to pass here here's a letter recommending all the nice things my dad has done you don't have to pass you don't have to pass out right my resume The Life of Christ his character will be my resume I'm talking about Paul and Aaron and Cam and brother Brooks everybody all the fivefold that com your life recommends these preachers to other people hallelujah amen that's right that's what Paul says you are our letter recommendation and it's known and read of everybody your life tells what kind of Pastor I am wherever you go Hallelujah my life tells everybody what kind of preachers we have in here hallelujah that's right Church all right verse see that gives it a whole different meaning than what most people use it all right verse three here's what he said for as much are ye as ye are the manifestly declared now manifestly declared uh manifest means to appear you're the declared appearing you're the you're the visible manifestation of the Epistle of Christ ministered by us you are the letters you are the letters of recom amation Hallelujah God declares God declares his word in your life hallelujah amen written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God I love that because ink brother Austin were you ever in school did you ever draw ink all over yourself i' write my not myself notes don't forget that history report I I notes all over my hands there and then when we got in high school we draw fake tattoos and you know because we thought we were cool we were not cool but the point is making is look Paul says you're not written with ink that's going to fade glory amen when God writes something on your life it doesn't fade hallelujah it's Eternal Hallelujah you can't wash it off it won't run up it won't fade away the Bible said you're born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God which liveth and abideth forever hallelujah amen it doesn't wear off you don't got to worry about your letter getting old you don't have to worry about laminating it don't have to laminate that's I'm a school teacher I always got to laminate stuff so they can last next year you don't got to laminate this Holy Ghost Hallelujah you don't have to he's living he's alive amen he's Eternal he cannot change Hallelujah wasn't written with ink Saints with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart amen hallelujah now how do you know your heart is turned we know Malachi 45 and6 tells us the spirit of Elijah will anoint John the Baptist and we believe the second part was brother brandham turned the hearts of the children to the fathers right John the Baptist turned the hearts of the fathers the Believers at Jesus first coming to the children right which were the end time Believers at Jesus's return but a spirit of Elijah had to come again at the last days to turn the hearts of the Believers at the second coming of Jesus back to the heart of the the Believers at the first coming of Jesus well what does a turned heart mean a turned heart means you no longer serve Idols you serve Jesus Christ First Kings 18:37 the Bible's plain Elijah's you know he he he saw all the things God showed him everything that was going to happen but then he said hear me Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again that's right they were they were confused well do we serve the uh servant do we file the preachers of bail or do we go after this one preacher do I go to the big churches or I go to that one small little Holy Roller church thank God for the Holy Roller church amen hallelujah praise God Amen it's not always in numbers it's in the purity of God's word hallelujah amen and they were kind of confused well these guys got these guys are jumping and shouting they're cutting themselves that's demon possession right there like tattoos and all that things cutting themselves making themselves bleed and all these things and Elijah praise God May their hearts be turned back to the one who answers by fire how many times has God answered us with our prayer request hallelujah amen hallelujah he answers by Supernatural means god answers our prayers church we are so blessed that God will hear our prayers and give us Supernatural answers praise God super natural vindications Hallelujah like Phil told me I don't know if you've heard that on Sunday or not I talked to Phil on Saturday he said brother Jess I only told you three fource of the healings that God did in my body blood pressure dizziness remember that blood infection urine infection all these there was like eight things and God healed them of all those Hallelujah and he said it was caused by one of the nurses did a bad job they didn't they're supposed to before they change things they're supposed to clean the ends and that's what happened but the doctors didn't know that so they said you're going to die well the saints went to praying hallelujah amen hallelujah Hearts turned back that's what we need church that's what we got by God's grace so we see the Mosaic Covenant is God writing his word on your heart and it doesn't fade away like I you know I've been telling you I've been putting all my old notes from my Bible in my new Bible I got a wide bar margin Bible why how come all these years I never had a wide margin Bible what was wrong with me brother William it's so nice you can write all these notes in the side I'm like yes I love this I won't forget these scriptures I'm less likely to forget them I'll still forget some of them but I've just been going through you know simple things like there's non- eternal hell and water baptism and the godhead and there's no Trinity of three persons and and brother it feels so fresh and new because my heart is turned back my heart loves these things I want to hear them again Hallelujah tell me again Jesus amen remind me of these wonder the Bible says s your minds your holy Minds up by way of remembrance Hallelujah and again as you as you know if you Feast on those things you'll use it later on during the week that's right you the ones that God shows you you'll use it on later during the week sometime you'll need it that's ammunition church the church saiden why because you're trying to defend the kingdom you're seeking first the kingdom of God hallelujah in the morning you seek first the kingdom of God and get ready with that ammunition as you go out into the world Hallelujah the full armor of God on Hallelujah ready to take God's word with you whenever you're going to need it praise God that's right okay only been preaching 50 minutes all right Glory

Kingdom about I'm GNA give you and all your heirs are going to be Kings forever but there was a condition if right and we know the king started breaking those conditions that's why the Kings got cut off but there's going to come a greater son of David Glory the son of David amen hallelujah who not compromise amen a rule Ru the world with a rot of iron Hallelujah but what was David's Covenant speaking of Kings Glory kings in the Kingdom the kingdom continuing through Kings Hallelujah and what does the bible call us we are Kings and Priests unto God oh my can you see the can you see how the that part of the Covenant carries over to us Glory God's got Kings and Priests on the Earth right now that's why God answers our prayers that's why God uh rules in our daily lives because we're

some of them got chained up and their eyes poked out zedekiah got his eyes poked out right after he saw uh Nebuchadnezzar kill his sons can you imagine that and he got carried away captive because he had Idols in his life all the idolatry the abortion all these things he allowed the idol worship the sexual immorality they allowed all this wickedness all these Idols so he got carried away his
