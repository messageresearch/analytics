[3:42] want to say you know last Sunday we had
[3:43] Brother Kyle visit right and he was
[3:46] saying afterwards I'll just share what
[3:47] Austin told me you know he was sharing
[3:49] afterwards he had never been or rarely
[3:52] been to a service where there was so
[3:53] much clapping and singing and shouting
[3:56] the shout he said he he just wanted to
[4:00] Scream and Shout or something didn't he
[4:02] say that but Austin
[4:04] I just I just want to encourage you you
[4:06] know like I as we worship we create an
[4:08] atmosphere and that's what people want
[4:09] to be a part of you know
[4:14] I got to talk to him afterwards and he
[4:15] was like Wow and then he told Austin
[4:17] like everything things were so different
[4:18] there people were so inviting people
[4:20] were so loving and
[4:21] even said about you know as me as a
[4:24] minister he's like wow the pastor was so
[4:26] welcoming and loving he said he said the
[4:29] deacons and so forth that his Catholic
[4:30] Church don't even want to take his hand
[4:32] Harley they got Mass on and
[4:34] you know so just just know that you know
[4:36] you're making a difference on people and
[4:37] your life speaks louder than any words
[4:39] you can say
[4:41] the love of Jesus Christ that we show
[4:43] and we try to show by God's grace to all
[4:46] people it speaks very loudly so
[4:48] hopefully he'll come back and but I
[4:52] oh he's on his way okay
[4:54] well Glory I hope he comes
[4:56] um
[4:57] but you know that meant a lot to me when
[4:59] Austin told me that and uh you know I
[5:00] just we just I love how we just treat
[5:02] everybody like their family you know
[5:04] that's what we got to keep doing just
[5:05] keep treating everybody like their
[5:06] family loving them and praying
[5:09] by God's grace and I just I just thought
[5:11] it was so beautiful you know
[5:13] I had those two sermons to preach and
[5:15] when Austin Austin came rushing in and
[5:17] during the song service I thought well
[5:19] this is strange you know
[5:21] I'm glad you did because when he when he
[5:23] told me Kyle was coming I wanted to
[5:24] preach a message that he could
[5:25] understand
[5:27] and it really was you know and then I
[5:29] saved you know the other Souls that were
[5:31] in prison you know for the evening
[5:33] I just just wonderful then to hear him
[5:35] to hear how he was impacted by something
[5:37] simple like that I knew Austin was led
[5:39] to the Lord and you were all led the
[5:40] Lord to sing and greet him and clap the
[5:42] way you did you know it's just really
[5:43] wonderful you know
[5:45] made me feel happy you know to see how
[5:48] God's love shines God's love is just you
[5:51] can't deny it praise God it's like it's
[5:53] like the difference between night and
[5:54] day praise God right God's love shines
[5:57] like like like the sunlight or he's gone
[5:59] so
[6:00] just want to encourage everybody to keep
[6:01] showing the love of Jesus Christ praise
[6:03] God so I want to just I want to briefly
[6:05] go over the scripture here
[6:07] I added some new notes we started with
[6:09] this one
[6:10] the father of circumcision to them who
[6:12] are not of the circumcision only so
[6:15] Abraham is our father even though we're
[6:17] not Jews
[6:19] the Jews are known for circumcision of
[6:22] the males on the eighth day they
[6:25] circumcise all male boys and and that
[6:27] circumcision was is what God told them
[6:29] to do and that entitles them to the
[6:32] benefits of the Covenant
[6:34] but now in the New Testament Paul says
[6:38] Abraham's Our Father even though we're
[6:40] not Jews
[6:42] and the Bible said who we also walk in
[6:45] the steps of that Faith of Our Father
[6:48] Abraham which he had yet being
[6:51] uncircumcised so Abraham had Faith
[6:55] before we saw I showed you on Wednesday
[6:57] nine years before he got the the command
[6:59] to circumcise he already had Faith
[7:01] before that
[7:02] and he was already a child of God before
[7:04] that
[7:05] he was already righteous he was already
[7:07] called of God he was already God's
[7:10] friend amen hallelujah he was already
[7:12] see the fact that God was already
[7:14] talking to him proved he was already the
[7:16] friend of God Amen
[7:18] and so when you can look at our your
[7:20] life and my life and when we when we can
[7:21] first see oh that's when God started
[7:23] talking to me that was proof you were
[7:25] already a child of God Amen because
[7:28] that's what the Bible says he was
[7:29] already talking to you he's already
[7:30] dealing with you amen hallelujah thank
[7:32] God and but then as you go on God he
[7:36] continues to be your father and he
[7:38] continues to guide you deeper into
[7:39] relationship with him
[7:41] in other words you get to know your
[7:43] father better Hallelujah
[7:45] hallelujah amen Thank God now so let's
[7:48] consider what faith was in Abraham's
[7:52] life what was it Faith was simply
[7:54] believing God's promise
[7:55] right in other words Abraham just had to
[7:58] believe God's revelation to him
[8:01] as long as he believed what God spoke to
[8:03] him he was walking by faith right
[8:07] Abraham didn't have to guess what God
[8:09] wanted him to do
[8:11] that's when he got in trouble when he
[8:13] tried to make it come to pass right when
[8:16] he tried to figure out he and Sarah
[8:17] tried to figure out what God wanted them
[8:20] to do when they tried to figure it out
[8:22] that's when they got in trouble
[8:24] but they didn't have to do that what
[8:26] they had to do was just patiently wait
[8:28] we saw in Hebrews chapter 6 right a
[8:30] Wednesday night the Bible said he just
[8:32] had to patiently endure
[8:34] right and then that would that would
[8:37] bring the promise to pass amen
[8:40] same thing is true for us we have to
[8:42] obey what God is currently revealed to
[8:44] us and not try to add to it or take away
[8:47] from it just obey it praise God
[8:50] and not try to make God's promise come
[8:52] to pass or something of our own ability
[8:54] we and what I mean by that is oh make it
[8:57] come to pass by sinning
[8:59] because that's what Abraham and Sarah
[9:01] did right they sinned right they they
[9:02] should not have taken another uh they
[9:04] should not have married Hagar right
[9:06] Abraham should not have done that that
[9:08] was a sin right it should not have
[9:09] happened now the Customs allowed it but
[9:11] really like Jesus said Jesus said you
[9:14] should have gone back to the beginning
[9:15] one man one woman
[9:17] right and Abraham should have known that
[9:19] he knew the story of Adam and Eve right
[9:22] and it should not have happened because
[9:24] look what it produced It produced
[9:26] Ishmael seed and a wild man and produced
[9:29] a group of rebels to the word of God
[9:31] they've now created their own God right
[9:33] Allah and it's gone the wrong direction
[9:38] and so Abraham's our father and when we
[9:41] walk in faith we walk in what God has
[9:43] revealed to us we walk in the promises
[9:46] of the Bible praise God all right now I
[9:48] want to just briefly go over this again
[9:50] here I'm going to flip back to this in a
[9:51] moment I show this and I know it's
[9:52] really blurry I know uh so I don't
[9:55] expect you to read it but it's just a
[9:56] visual for me because I want to read it
[9:58] uh but I just want to review each item
[10:00] and look at each move of Abraham wasn't
[10:03] by faith or was it not
[10:06] okay so the first time he's 75 years old
[10:09] and God tells him to separate from his
[10:12] family
[10:14] so he did but he took a long lot which
[10:17] he should not have done
[10:18] Now it worked out for Lots good right
[10:22] looked out worked out for Abraham's good
[10:24] too right the Bible said all things work
[10:26] together for good to them to love the
[10:28] Lord right
[10:29] Even in our mistakes the good of it is
[10:32] that we learn what not to do praise God
[10:35] and then we can Pat you know if time
[10:37] goes on like brothers said then we can
[10:39] leave footprints in the sands of time
[10:41] and say you know well Malachi Lydia
[10:42] here's where your dad and mom obeyed or
[10:44] here's where Dad made a mistake don't do
[10:46] what Dad did right here
[10:48] right uh
[10:50] you know I can look at some of the
[10:51] mistakes from my Early Childhood or my
[10:54] early adulthood I could say Malachi
[10:55] don't do this you're a man don't do this
[10:57] maybe I'll do that when I'm preaching
[10:58] here soon I can say Lydia don't do like
[11:01] Daddy did right here you know that's
[11:03] that's where I made a big mistake I
[11:04] filed the wrong crowd there
[11:06] I should have stayed with the word of
[11:07] God you know
[11:09] uh and and so Abraham here he partially
[11:13] obeys I put a red dot there he partially
[11:15] obeyed so the red means a mistake he
[11:17] partially obeyed but he didn't fully
[11:19] obey
[11:20] and I think if we're honest you know all
[11:22] of us would say when we get saved we
[11:23] obey some but we don't obey everything
[11:26] so that we all start like that right in
[11:28] other words I'll say like this when we
[11:30] first got saved we didn't get saved and
[11:33] then get the Holy Ghost on the same day
[11:35] right you gotta you got to get Justified
[11:37] you gotta and then you gotta get
[11:39] Sanctified praise God
[11:40] so I think it's a beautiful uh it's a
[11:43] beautiful representation of what we go
[11:45] through
[11:46] Hallelujah and so there he's walking by
[11:49] faith so was he walking by faith yes
[11:52] okay and then he got a covenant you know
[11:54] he got the Covenant uh then he journeyed
[11:56] up to Canaan that was all by faith he
[11:58] was walking by faith
[12:00] all right but the next step was because
[12:03] the drought like we're going through now
[12:05] right right of course not as half as bad
[12:08] because of the drought he left where God
[12:10] told him to go
[12:12] so at that time he wasn't walking by he
[12:14] wasn't walking in faith but I want to
[12:17] ask you what was was God was God upset
[12:19] with what was God upset with him was God
[12:21] done with him did God want him to throw
[12:23] him away and get him a new person to
[12:25] work with
[12:26] no Abraham was still his chosen
[12:30] you're still his chosen amen
[12:32] you might leave the he left where God
[12:35] told him to be God said be there he left
[12:37] and went down to Egypt he was in
[12:39] complete Disobedience but God never left
[12:41] him praise God
[12:43] God even had to have Pharaoh have accept
[12:47] Abraham's prayer praise God
[12:50] Abraham lied to pharaoh and then God
[12:52] still stood on Abraham's side
[12:55] you know I just finished job yesterday
[12:56] and the same thing happened in job
[12:59] spoke some things against God God comes
[13:02] out and rebukes job
[13:03] right God said you made yourself
[13:05] righteous more than me
[13:08] and then job said I repent and Dustin
[13:10] ashes I uttered things I didn't
[13:12] understand I've heard with my ears but
[13:14] now I see
[13:16] so God rebukes job and then a few verses
[13:19] later God tells the three friends job
[13:21] said what was right
[13:24] but it wasn't all right
[13:26] right
[13:27] it wasn't all right
[13:30] it also shows how quick God is to
[13:32] forgive it's his true servants amen
[13:36] and then God makes them you know
[13:38] sacrifice and have job pray for them to
[13:41] forgive them of their mistakes in other
[13:43] words they wouldn't be forgiven unless
[13:45] they humble themselves to God's servant
[13:47] job
[13:49] well in each case is pharaoh and Joe's
[13:52] three friends had to recognize who was
[13:54] the one walking in the real walk of
[13:56] faith
[13:57] and God honored them because they were
[13:59] really walking in faith Church let's be
[14:01] like Abraham let's be like job let's
[14:04] obey God with all of our heart soul mind
[14:06] and strength let's be the friend of God
[14:08] hallelujah
[14:10] we do that by obeying God's word
[14:12] hallelujah we are by the grace of God
[14:14] it's the same story there God always
[14:17] takes the side of the person who's going
[14:19] to believe him the most
[14:21] yes we still have failures but God's
[14:24] looking and he's watching seeing which
[14:26] group is actually believing more of my
[14:28] promises
[14:29] and that's a group I stand beside amen
[14:31] hallelujah all right just like with
[14:34] Abraham Allah who is God really with
[14:36] Abraham or lot he was really with
[14:38] Abraham
[14:39] a lot was saved but the one he was
[14:41] dealing with the most was Abraham
[14:44] and lot just benefited from the the
[14:47] benefits of being around Abraham
[14:50] so it is with us right we we should we
[14:52] should live close to God we should be
[14:54] the ones serving God loving God and then
[14:57] people should notice wow I'm blessed
[14:59] just being around you praise God
[15:02] that's right that's true amen hallelujah
[15:04] that's true praise God
[15:07] thank the Lord
[15:08] so was he walking by faith well not
[15:10] really because he disobeyed but then he
[15:12] got on back on the right track right and
[15:15] he left Egypt and went up to Bethel then
[15:17] he got right back on the right track and
[15:19] then that's where God then uh communed
[15:21] with him
[15:22] and shortly after that He restored a lot
[15:26] and he met Melchizedek
[15:29] look at this he just disobeyed God and
[15:31] then he meets God
[15:33] that ought to encourage us even if we
[15:35] make a mistake say God forgive me I
[15:37] wouldn't experience something with you
[15:39] today praise God
[15:41] Lord I made a mistake there's Brother
[15:42] Kyle God bless you sir hallelujah amen
[15:45] good to see you Hallelujah
[15:48] so God
[15:50] so he failed God but God didn't give up
[15:52] on Abraham Hallelujah
[15:54] God visits him and then God even though
[15:57] he failed God says well now I'm going to
[15:59] use you as a warrior and you're going to
[16:00] go save your brother from his his
[16:03] addictions I'll say like that amen
[16:05] Hallelujah yeah you failed me God said
[16:08] to Abraham but now I'm going to use you
[16:09] you're going to go restore your brother
[16:11] in his vaccinating condition restore him
[16:14] back to the faith that's exactly what
[16:16] Abraham did and then God met Abraham and
[16:19] then Abraham had Community with God Amen
[16:22] oh so see how God God always restores
[16:25] our relationship with him
[16:27] we're the ones who fail we're the ones
[16:29] who make mistakes God is quick to
[16:31] forgive and then he's quick to bring us
[16:33] back into his will and then use us to
[16:36] bless other people amen
[16:38] he doesn't throw us away and says that's
[16:40] the 10th time you fail me I'm done with
[16:42] you no God said I forgive you now I want
[16:45] to use you again praise God
[16:48] amen he doesn't Throw the Clay Away
[16:50] Hallelujah
[16:52] he's the Potter amen thank God he just
[16:55] puts us back on the wheel and molds us
[16:57] and shapes us and uses us amen he gives
[17:00] us a fresh start praise God
[17:02] that's what God did to Abraham that's
[17:04] what God will do with Abraham's children
[17:06] praise God
[17:08] amen
[17:10] Hallelujah
[17:13] I notice then God God called a
[17:15] separation
[17:17] Abraham was a much stronger believer
[17:19] than lot
[17:21] and so God had to separate them at some
[17:23] point and and God allowed the situations
[17:25] well I need to separate this person
[17:27] they're a good believer but they're they
[17:29] don't want to live as high as I want to
[17:31] live
[17:32] and so Abraham had to separate himself
[17:34] and I love Abraham's Christian Behavior
[17:36] he gave lie he said a lot we got to
[17:40] separate now you get the first choice
[17:42] isn't that isn't that a Christian thing
[17:44] to do that's called preferring your
[17:45] brother above yourself
[17:48] you get the First Choice lock whatever
[17:50] way you go I'll go the other way because
[17:52] we don't have enough room here there's
[17:53] not enough room here for all of our
[17:55] resources we don't have enough room for
[17:58] all these cattle and all these sheep and
[18:00] oxen and everything we got to separate
[18:02] ways and sure sometimes you'll see that
[18:04] in your life you'll have a close friend
[18:05] but God will have to separate you from
[18:07] that person because they're not truly
[18:09] wanting to live more of God's word like
[18:11] you want to live amen
[18:13] Hallelujah
[18:15] God did it with Abraham God has to do it
[18:18] with us the Bible said we walk in the
[18:20] steps of faithful Abraham praise God
[18:23] think of how many people down through
[18:24] the years we've had good friends and
[18:26] they'll be our friends for a while but
[18:27] then they choose a more worldly path so
[18:30] lot said well he looked out and he said
[18:32] I want to go to that rich City
[18:35] but it was full of homosexuals
[18:38] and the first the Bible said he said by
[18:40] Abraham and then he was plant he was he
[18:42] he put his tents in the in the
[18:44] wilderness but then he he he he left
[18:48] there and he moved closer and then the
[18:50] next time we see him he's one of the
[18:51] judges in the gates
[18:54] and and the Bible said he went there
[18:56] because he saw their Gardens he saw all
[18:59] their finances he saw all the prosperity
[19:02] but where did Prosperity get his family
[19:04] it got us most of his family lost
[19:08] and he forgot about brother said he
[19:11] forgot about Abraham and Sarah and their
[19:13] promise seed
[19:16] why was that important because that
[19:17] promise seed he'll go Isaac Jacob and it
[19:20] would produce the holy nation it would
[19:23] produce the holy Tabernacle It produced
[19:25] the Ark of the Covenant pretty soon It
[19:27] produced a Moses pretty soon in
[19:29] producing Joshua amen hallelujah pretty
[19:32] soon to producer David Hallelujah and
[19:35] the Solomon and lot was saying well I
[19:37] can't wait around for that promise I
[19:39] want to go have Prosperity now Church
[19:40] the real Prosperity is obeying God's
[19:43] word amen
[19:48] we can't we can't make decisions based
[19:50] upon what we see we got a base
[19:52] conditions and decisions upon what God's
[19:55] word says
[19:58] so although lot was richer maybe maybe
[20:01] and had more Prosperity as it seemed in
[20:04] a well-gardened area Abraham was was
[20:07] closer to God because he was out here in
[20:09] the wilderness he lived a life separate
[20:11] unto God
[20:12] he had 300 servants he sent the servants
[20:15] out you go watch the Sheep you got the
[20:17] goats you take the cattle and Sarah and
[20:19] I are going to stay here and we will
[20:20] manage everything
[20:22] but they didn't no it was it was busy
[20:26] can you imagine 300 servants
[20:29] I only have 21 kids in my class it's
[20:31] hard to remember it's hard to think of
[20:32] 300 300 servants
[20:34] how do I do this
[20:36] but still although it was busy and crazy
[20:38] and 300 people around here it was better
[20:41] than living with homosexuals
[20:43] and I'm not I'm not I'm not condemning
[20:45] them God will judge them we warned them
[20:47] and we asked God that that God would
[20:49] reveal himself to them so they can and
[20:51] we try to warn them to come out but
[20:53] church we got a choice we can either
[20:54] live closer to the world or we can live
[20:56] a life that's separated unto God Amen
[21:00] amen
[21:02] oh and he lived away from those worldly
[21:05] things he lived away from the city he
[21:07] lived out in a place where he and God
[21:09] could have Fellowship praise God
[21:12] I want you to notice the Bible never
[21:14] said God smoked a lot down there in
[21:16] Sodom
[21:17] God only spoke to the man Abraham who
[21:20] was separated unto God Amen
[21:26] he chose I'm not going to live those
[21:28] they're Sinners I'm not going to live
[21:30] amongst that but what I'm going to do is
[21:31] I'm going to live out here where my and
[21:33] the Bible said he trained his family and
[21:36] his servants to obey the word of God
[21:38] hallelujah
[21:39] let's read that Genesis 18. I want you
[21:41] to get that
[21:43] you know people always say Abraham was a
[21:45] man of Faith man of Faith that's true
[21:46] but what was it about his faith that was
[21:49] so important it was important because he
[21:51] obeyed and then he trained others to
[21:54] obey
[21:55] that's why coming to church and reading
[21:57] your Bible and worshiping God is so
[21:59] incredibly important learning to obey
[22:01] right and it's okay to make mistakes
[22:03] God's not looking at your mistakes he's
[22:05] looking at the finished product
[22:06] Hallelujah
[22:10] doesn't focus on yes Abraham is going to
[22:12] pay for his mistakes he was going to
[22:13] deal with the consequences but God was
[22:15] looking at I'm producing something a
[22:17] great sea lion is coming through you
[22:19] you're the star of something great and
[22:22] Church of God dairies Our Lives will be
[22:24] the start of something great praise God
[22:27] which the great thing is a family or
[22:29] relatives or people that come after us
[22:31] people that we've Inspire to serve Jesus
[22:33] Christ so the gospel can keep going it's
[22:36] got to go to Every Nation it's got to go
[22:38] to Every Nation gets a chance to hear
[22:40] and we're doing our part right here in
[22:42] Akron amen but the great thing is
[22:44] passing on the blessing of Jesus Christ
[22:46] Hallelujah
[22:47] amen Genesis 18 Hallelujah
[22:54] ah 1817.
[22:58] remember church God never went down
[23:00] there to Sodom God never went he only
[23:02] sent his angels down there because it
[23:04] was such a wicked thing God wouldn't
[23:05] even go down there
[23:08] now
[23:09] the Lord is talking to Abraham in verse
[23:12] 17 and the Lord said shall I hide from
[23:14] Abraham that thing which I do
[23:16] which was destroying Sodom and Gomorrah
[23:18] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[23:21] a great and mighty nation and all the
[23:23] nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
[23:24] him
[23:26] for I know him that he will command his
[23:29] children and his household after him and
[23:31] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[23:33] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[23:35] may bring upon Abraham that which
[23:38] he has spoken of him so what kind of man
[23:41] was Abraham he was a man that kept the
[23:44] word of God
[23:45] he's a man and now it's time children
[23:47] I'm going to teach you the word of God
[23:48] now
[23:49] it's time to read our Bibles
[23:51] it's time to sing praise to God today
[23:54] Hallelujah
[23:56] it's time to obey the scriptures it's
[23:59] time to remember God today
[24:01] in other words do like I've done get to
[24:04] know God hear God's voice obey God's
[24:07] word let's be not let's not be
[24:09] distracted by money and riches like love
[24:11] and we will pray for him and we'll
[24:13] rescue him like Abraham did we'll help
[24:15] him when he's down and discouraged we'll
[24:16] help him but let's live a different life
[24:18] let's live holy unto God hallelujah
[24:21] because God's worthy of that
[24:24] now go in your Bible says II Peter
[24:26] chapter two now let's see what the Bible
[24:28] said about lot
[24:30] this is a fresh I mean it's a good
[24:32] scripture but it's kind of fresh thought
[24:33] to me like this second Peter chapter two
[24:45] now it's verse verse six
[24:47] yeah
[24:49] so picture you got one group living in
[24:51] the city over here
[24:52] lot who's a Believer he was saved but
[24:55] then you have Abraham over here who was
[24:57] saved a Believer but he through him God
[24:59] was going to do greater things than Lots
[25:02] because he kept the word of God so
[25:04] Abraham's out here having Bible studies
[25:06] yeah
[25:08] Abraham's teaching all the service let's
[25:09] have Bible studies
[25:12] but law in the city is just trying to
[25:14] survive because of all the wickedness
[25:16] he's around
[25:18] yes Abraham's busy he's busy and
[25:21] sometimes he's like in I'm in over my
[25:23] head over all these jobs and animals and
[25:24] servants but we're still going to focus
[25:26] on the word of God
[25:28] I'm not going to be moved away from that
[25:30] I'm not going to be tempted to go
[25:31] anywhere else I know God's calling me
[25:33] and I'm going to keep his word praise
[25:34] God hallelujah and that's what we must
[25:36] walk in his steps praise God
[25:38] amen but look what look what lot went
[25:41] through verse six and turning the cities
[25:44] of sodomor into ashes condemn them with
[25:46] an overthrow making them an ensample
[25:48] unto those that after should live
[25:50] ungodly
[25:53] so God made an example of Sodom and
[25:55] Gomorrah because of the the men were
[25:56] sodomites right they were homosexual men
[25:59] God made them an example by destroying
[26:01] them with a sulfur uh right and burning
[26:04] ashes and sulfur
[26:06] fire Brimstone that's where it is there
[26:08] and that's an example of what God is
[26:10] going to do
[26:12] okay God's gonna do it again in this
[26:13] time we don't know when but but that's
[26:15] what the Bible said God's going to
[26:16] destroy he's going to pour out the the
[26:17] seven Trumpets the seven vows and the
[26:20] three woes
[26:21] Upon A group of people that after Jesus
[26:24] has saved his bride he's race snatched
[26:26] away his bride taking him to the the
[26:28] wedding reception then yes God has to
[26:30] pour out wrath upon all those who
[26:32] rejected the truth
[26:33] just like Sodom and Gomorrah verse 7 and
[26:37] he delivered just lot Vex with a filthy
[26:40] conversation of the wicked
[26:44] so God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but
[26:46] before that he saved three people
[26:49] three
[26:50] in a city of thousands
[26:52] only three people could be saved now did
[26:55] God let them burn no God save them
[26:57] praise God
[26:59] because God is gracious
[27:01] but look what the Bible look what the
[27:03] Bible said he was vexed lot lived a
[27:05] vexed life yet he was a Christian Vex
[27:08] means torment now church only you know
[27:10] how much torment you go through each day
[27:13] I don't know how much torment you go to
[27:16] but if you're having my battles and
[27:18] going through torment all the time and
[27:19] you're under torment and life just seems
[27:22] hard and struggles then you're probably
[27:23] more like a lot rather than Abraham
[27:26] you might be saved you might be a
[27:28] believer but lot was he had to Bow the
[27:31] torment every day was torment he's
[27:32] trying to live a believer's life he's
[27:34] trying to be a believer but every day
[27:36] was torment where Abraham's over in here
[27:38] yeah it's busy there's a lot going on
[27:40] but we get to know the word of God over
[27:42] here praise God
[27:43] Abraham didn't have to look out and see
[27:45] men assaulting one another I'll just say
[27:47] it like that
[27:48] men in the streets assaulting one
[27:51] another sexually
[27:53] Abraham didn't have to see that out
[27:54] there in the fields he got to see the
[27:56] animals out there
[27:57] hallelujah praise God
[27:59] he got to see all the the animals and
[28:01] and he got to see his
[28:05] the pastures praise God the food growing
[28:07] and The Vineyards and all these things
[28:09] he got to see he's a wealthy man
[28:13] but he wasn't vexed lot was vexed and
[28:16] tormented every day Church there's
[28:17] something to be said to have a life of
[28:19] Peace in 2023.
[28:22] there's something to be said there's
[28:24] something valuable in having peace in
[28:26] your heart when you lay your head down
[28:28] at night praise God
[28:29] lot did not have that oh peace is such a
[28:32] valuable thing praise God and you can't
[28:34] pay money for it you got to pay and
[28:36] sacrifice amen
[28:40] the Bible says buy the truth and sell it
[28:43] not
[28:44] and that means this that means rejecting
[28:47] the wrong and accepting the right praise
[28:49] God
[28:50] Hallelujah so like a lot choosing he
[28:54] chose to live there that was his choice
[28:55] praise God he didn't have to do that he
[28:58] chose to live with the worldly things
[29:00] Abraham didn't Abraham chose different
[29:02] he said I'll go to a place where I can
[29:04] train my family where I can keep the
[29:06] word of God where I can hear the voice
[29:08] of God
[29:10] lot wasn't hearing the voice of God
[29:13] never visited a lot in there
[29:15] a lot only got saved right at the end by
[29:18] grace
[29:19] the angels I don't know if you read that
[29:21] Brother Kyle lately the Angels literally
[29:22] had to pull him out
[29:24] they had to grab him by the he just
[29:26] wanted to stay and of course he had
[29:27] loved ones there and
[29:29] really didn't want to leave
[29:31] but he he so was he was so connected to
[29:33] the world and riches and money and
[29:35] family all there and yet he wanted to
[29:38] stay he wanted to stay living a Vex life
[29:40] church let me just say like this you
[29:42] know we don't have to stay where we are
[29:44] there's a way out
[29:47] amen there's a way out of a tormented
[29:50] life there's a way out of what you if
[29:52] you feel trapped you don't have to feel
[29:54] trapped forever you don't have to feel
[29:55] tormented forever come out like Abraham
[29:58] amen
[29:59] separate yourself from family friends
[30:02] and riches and whatever you're saying
[30:04] get away from the torment of life and
[30:06] come out here and live a peaceful life
[30:08] with Abraham praise God
[30:10] amen
[30:12] Hallelujah I did that years ago I'll
[30:15] tell Kyle and uh for Kyle and and Chris
[30:19] amen
[30:22] Hallelujah
[30:24] thank God
[30:26] amen hallelujah
[30:29] so when I was 19 I just got saved but I
[30:31] was around a lot of guys that they went
[30:33] to church but they'd also drink Coronas
[30:37] and then also watch filthy movies and I
[30:39] knew that was wrong
[30:41] and I had to make a choice and they were
[30:42] trying to tell me oh you can be a pastor
[30:44] and you can do this and I had to make a
[30:46] choice I I believe they were Believers
[30:48] but I was living in torment
[30:51] so I had my Abraham moment right
[30:54] am I going to continue and say uh yeah
[30:56] be more popular I have more friends I
[30:58] had more likes on Facebook
[31:02] I would have had more of that but it
[31:04] would have been constant torment
[31:06] so I thank God I made my choice praise
[31:09] God Amen
[31:10] I had to forsake all my friends and they
[31:12] think I'm crazy to this day that's fine
[31:13] I think they're crazy for staying inside
[31:15] of that's what I think
[31:16] but I had to make my way come out with
[31:18] God's despised view to live a life of
[31:21] peace to obey the word of God to learn
[31:23] to to to handle the word of God and know
[31:26] God and because of that we can hear
[31:28] God's voice amen
[31:30] amen
[31:32] Glory
[31:34] and that all happened there
[31:36] he had finally a deception so he lived
[31:38] with uh we'd say he lived with weaker
[31:40] Believers but then he had to separate
[31:42] himself
[31:43] Hallelujah
[31:45] he rested a lot as well and then after
[31:48] he rescues lot then he gets a covenant
[31:50] by sacrifice let's go let's go to that
[31:52] let's go to I'm sorry yeah same second
[31:54] Peter we never read verse eight that's
[31:56] what I want to read verse 8.
[31:57] verse 8 sorry II Peter 2 verse 8.
[32:01] church it's all about if you want to
[32:02] live a life of Peace it's all about what
[32:04] you see and what you hear
[32:07] if you say brother Jefferson I really
[32:09] would like to have peace in my life okay
[32:10] well then be careful what you're seeing
[32:11] and be careful what you're hearing
[32:15] amen look at verse 8.
[32:17] because the Bible said he was Vex and
[32:18] verse 8 why would this righteous man be
[32:21] tormented why would God let a man be
[32:23] tormented well the thing is God didn't
[32:25] want him to be but lot wanted to be
[32:26] tormented
[32:28] he wanted to live there God will let you
[32:30] have your choice
[32:32] God the Bible the Bible says God loved
[32:35] him so much he pulled him out of there
[32:36] with angels
[32:38] in other words lot wanted to live in
[32:40] that kind of Lifestyle yet he was
[32:42] tormented by it see that's why people
[32:44] will continue into their evil addictions
[32:46] because they still love it but they
[32:48] gotta hate it and then they gotta repent
[32:50] of it and then they gotta come out of it
[32:51] praise God if they want peace if they
[32:53] want to walk with God if they want to
[32:55] walk in faith they've got to come out of
[32:57] it praise God
[32:59] amen
[33:00] verse eight for that righteous man
[33:02] dwelling among them he's dwelling with
[33:04] homosexual men that would with Mobs of
[33:07] men that will go around and ravish
[33:08] people that's what he was living among
[33:11] in seeing and hearing Vex is righteous
[33:13] so from day to day with their unlawful
[33:16] Deeds
[33:16] so he was trying to live a life of Peace
[33:19] but then he'd see things and be like Oh
[33:20] I'm tormented then he'd hear things
[33:22] imagine the cries that he would hear
[33:25] these men would go after other men that
[33:27] and so seeing that oh then hearing that
[33:31] that's what he chose to live in
[33:33] but at any time he could have went out
[33:36] and said Abraham surely there's a couple
[33:37] acres out here right here
[33:39] sure there's just give me two acres you
[33:41] know
[33:42] Abraham bro I had hundreds of Acres
[33:44] right
[33:45] surely you know we can separate a little
[33:46] a little bit further than yeah
[33:48] I'm kind of close to you
[33:50] but he chose to live in that he kept
[33:52] seeing the sodomy he kept hearing the
[33:54] side of me and he never left it God
[33:57] wants us to leave that praise God
[33:59] you have the choice you need to be like
[34:01] LA or Abraham let's be Abraham and Sarah
[34:04] amen
[34:07] stop looking at those things and stop
[34:09] listening those things and you'll be a
[34:11] real abrahamic believer praise God
[34:14] that's all I gotta do don't put yourself
[34:16] around it praise God
[34:18] that's what lot did he put himself
[34:20] around it so that's what caused the
[34:21] torment
[34:23] he saw it and heard it all the time we
[34:25] got must be very careful what we see in
[34:27] here
[34:28] that will produce either a atmosphere of
[34:31] Torment or an atmosphere of peace
[34:34] and the church said
[34:36] Glory
[34:37] Hallelujah okay now go to Genesis 15.
[34:42] even today
[34:44] we must choose every day to have an
[34:46] atmosphere of peace
[34:47] Genesis 15.
[34:49] I just want to go down again and just
[34:51] review this real quick I mentioned it on
[34:52] Wednesday
[35:02] now let's go to verse 8 Genesis 15.
[35:03] let's just read this is a small portion
[35:05] of scripture I feel led to do this and
[35:07] he said Lord God wherewith I'm sorry
[35:09] whereby shall I know that I shall
[35:11] inherit it now God I just told him you
[35:12] know your seed's going to be as a number
[35:13] of stars you're going to have all these
[35:15] uh descendants all these things and he
[35:18] said God how do I know
[35:20] verse 9 and he said to him take me and
[35:23] heifer of three years old and a shego of
[35:25] three years old and a ram of three years
[35:27] old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon
[35:29] five sacrifices and he took them unto
[35:32] all I'm sorry and took unto him all
[35:34] these and divided them in the midst and
[35:35] laid each piece one against another and
[35:37] the birds divided he not
[35:41] so he takes five animals he cuts them
[35:43] down the middle right which represents a
[35:45] covenant
[35:46] right when you make a covenant
[35:47] something's got to die something's right
[35:49] there has to be a sacrifice to make a
[35:50] promise
[35:51] I'm promising on the life of this that
[35:54] this animal is going to die I'm
[35:55] promising to keep my part of the bargain
[35:58] so he he cuts God tells him cut five
[36:00] animals in half
[36:02] right the next verse
[36:04] so death had to happen blood had to be
[36:06] shed for him to know that God was going
[36:09] to be with him blood had to be shed and
[36:10] thank God the blood of Jesus Christ was
[36:12] shed for us amen
[36:15] amen
[36:17] amen we don't need any other sacrifice
[36:19] there's one sacrifice once and for all
[36:21] Hallelujah the blood of Jesus
[36:24] now he didn't divide the birds because
[36:26] that represented uh Birds rep usually
[36:28] represent the Holy Spirit if they're
[36:29] good clean Birds verse 11. and when the
[36:32] files came down upon the carcasses Abram
[36:34] drove them away
[36:36] now brother Brandon says these other
[36:38] files represent uh as a type represent
[36:40] evil spirits
[36:42] and so when we make a sacrifice to God
[36:44] evil spirits are going to come down and
[36:46] attack us to try to get us distracted
[36:48] away from the Covenant God made with us
[36:50] so what do you have to do shoe those
[36:52] lies away say Satan get behind me get
[36:55] out of here praise God kind of like we
[36:57] had to shoot those Lambs away out of the
[36:59] graduation party yesterday they kept
[37:01] coming in they were sweet Lambs
[37:03] but they keep wanting to eat all Lydia's
[37:05] food and everything like that
[37:07] and we got to keep shooting them away
[37:08] well Abraham had to do that Satan get
[37:11] away from these sacrifices These Are
[37:13] Holy sacrifices in other words Satan get
[37:15] away from my holy life
[37:17] I'm trying to obey God here I'm trying
[37:19] to hear God's voice Satan get away I
[37:22] rebuke you in Jesus Christ's name
[37:24] amen that's what Abraham had to do he
[37:27] had to shoot all the birds away from the
[37:30] sacrifice that God had told him to do
[37:32] we got to shoot away all these unclean
[37:34] spirits the Bible said the false church
[37:37] is a cage of unclean and hateful Birds
[37:41] right so uh a false church is like a
[37:44] cage where there's all kinds of meat
[37:46] birds and evil birds in there and so
[37:48] what do you gotta do you gotta get the
[37:49] birds out amen gotta cast The Devils out
[37:52] amen
[37:53] I cast these lies out I cast this lust
[37:56] out I cast this greed out I cast this
[37:59] Pride out in Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:02] get it on Abraham amen
[38:04] hallelujah praise God
[38:07] oh thank God
[38:09] verse 12 and when the sun was going down
[38:11] a deep sleep fell upon Abram
[38:13] and lo and of great Darkness fell
[38:15] upon him so God puts him to sleep after
[38:18] the sacrifice are made the blood's been
[38:19] shed and the birds are drove away God
[38:22] puts him to sleep and in this great
[38:24] of Darkness falls upon him
[38:27] and he said unto Abraham and Abraham's
[38:29] sleeping no of a surety that thy seed
[38:31] shall be a stranger land that is not
[38:32] theirs that was score speaking of when
[38:34] Israel went down into Egypt and they
[38:36] were slaves for 440 years
[38:39] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[38:41] flick them 400 years and also that
[38:44] Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[38:45] judge and afterwards they shall come out
[38:48] with a great substance and thou shalt go
[38:49] thy wave I'm sorry go to thy fathers in
[38:52] peace Thou shalt be buried in the good
[38:53] old age
[38:54] amen what a blessing to know that well
[38:56] the end of my life is going to be in
[38:58] peace
[38:59] what a confirmation God gave to Abraham
[39:02] Hallelujah the god in other words God's
[39:04] going to take care of my future
[39:06] and when I die it's gonna be I'm gonna
[39:07] die in peace praise God all right the
[39:09] main thing is peace with God hallelujah
[39:12] that's the best thing peace of God you
[39:13] have a question brother Chris
[39:18] yeah yeah
[39:20] and then each time he visits him he
[39:22] visits him again each time he gives him
[39:23] more and more Revelation about his life
[39:26] but at this point he tells him your end
[39:28] will be peace
[39:30] and then he tells them what's going to
[39:31] happen to his descendants they're going
[39:32] to be so many but they're going to go
[39:34] down to Egypt they got to be slaves he
[39:35] said but I'm going to bring them out
[39:36] with the mighty hand
[39:39] so imagine that they had to either write
[39:41] these down or they had to pass these
[39:43] prophecies onto their children remember
[39:45] remember Grandpa Abraham said we're
[39:47] we're going to go down to be safe but
[39:49] God's going to bring us out
[39:51] remember the prophet said it amen the
[39:54] word of God said it God's word says it
[39:56] the vision says it and for us it's the
[39:58] Bible said it praise God if the Bible
[40:01] said it I believe it praise God
[40:03] it's God's promise to Abraham seed
[40:05] Hallelujah
[40:06] God will protect us amen Before
[40:08] Destruction comes God will rescue his
[40:10] church he'll rap you his church off the
[40:12] Earth we don't go through the wrath of
[40:14] God we're not ordained the Wrath we're
[40:16] ordained a Salvation Hallelujah
[40:19] hey man
[40:21] Glory
[40:22] look at verse
[40:24] 16 but in the fourth generation they
[40:26] shall come hither again for iniquity the
[40:28] amorites is not yet full in other words
[40:29] God had to let these people in the
[40:31] Promised Land
[40:32] do more and more sin so that now God was
[40:35] fair and just in pouring out his wrath
[40:37] upon them
[40:39] imagine that
[40:41] God gave them 400 more years to repent
[40:43] but they failed to repent and after
[40:45] those 400 years God said now I'm going
[40:46] to destroy you by Joshua that's what he
[40:48] did
[40:49] except for the giving
[40:52] Grace
[40:53] Hallelujah
[40:55] now look America's coming up on 250
[40:58] right
[40:59] coming up on 250.
[41:01] now we know that America will never
[41:02] repent as a whole but we can have little
[41:05] revivals in the midst of America why
[41:07] because I'm one of them
[41:09] my life has been revived amen hallelujah
[41:11] hallelujah
[41:14] amen
[41:16] so we don't know how long God will be
[41:17] merciful to America but we can we can be
[41:20] the abrahamites praise God we can be
[41:22] Abraham's seed right here in America
[41:23] praise God
[41:25] we can be the righteous ones that's
[41:27] right
[41:28] now he says verse 17 I mean it came to
[41:30] pass that when the sun went down and it
[41:32] was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a
[41:34] burning lamp that passed between those
[41:36] pieces
[41:38] okay now I want to go actually uh go
[41:42] back up to verse 12 that great of
[41:43] Darkness uh brother Ram said uh that was
[41:46] God letting Abraham know about the
[41:49] of death and Hell
[41:52] right he's letting Abraham know he puts
[41:54] him to sleep he says this is the horrors
[41:57] of death
[41:58] he said but then but now if we look
[42:00] there in verse 17.
[42:02] a smoking furnace a burning lamp passed
[42:05] between those pieces what was that
[42:07] smoking and burning left that was the
[42:08] Holy Spirit
[42:10] that was the pillar of Fire
[42:12] and the Bible said it has to pass
[42:14] between those pieces because that was
[42:16] God saying Abraham I'm I made a covenant
[42:19] with you and I'm coming between these
[42:21] pieces that means I'm approving of this
[42:24] Covenant and I'm going to keep my end of
[42:26] the Covenant praise God
[42:28] I'm coming in the midst of this Covenant
[42:30] you know like two brothers will shake
[42:32] hands and we'll agree right we'll agree
[42:33] okay that's a covenant you're sure
[42:35] you're gonna do that okay I'll do I'll
[42:37] do my part too
[42:38] okay so we passed between and we make a
[42:41] covenant like this well God come down
[42:42] and pass between the sacrifice Abraham's
[42:45] lying there and God said I'm you you
[42:47] made the sacrifice I've received your
[42:48] sacrifice amen I've received it I'm
[42:52] passing through here in other words I'm
[42:53] going to remember all these sacrifices I
[42:56] remember your life I'm going to remember
[42:57] you because I always keep my Covenant
[42:59] praise God
[43:01] I always keep my promises amen you obey
[43:04] me you kept the sacrifice I'm passing
[43:07] here to to show you I'm passing through
[43:09] showing you I'll keep my end of the
[43:11] bargain amen
[43:12] because we know man we know no man can
[43:15] keep his end of the bargain
[43:17] right with God I'm talking about which
[43:19] one of us can obey every word of God and
[43:21] we'll never do it
[43:23] you'll hardly make it through a day with
[43:24] if you make it through a day praise God
[43:25] but you're going to mess up the next day
[43:27] right or pretty soon thereafter God said
[43:30] see Abraham you have nothing to do with
[43:32] this amen praise God
[43:33] I'm doing something I'm raising up a sea
[43:36] lion I'm raising up a people and
[43:38] eventually out of that sea lion after
[43:39] after David and Solomon and all these
[43:42] men finally come God's son Jesus Christ
[43:44] amen
[43:48] he starts to come in with the with the
[43:50] Jews that will receive them and then the
[43:51] Gentiles praise God which is US amen
[43:54] hallelujah
[43:56] remember this was a covenant to Abraham
[43:58] and all of his seed
[44:02] so God passes between these pieces and
[44:04] said this is my Covenant I agree with
[44:07] this Covenant I'm keeping this Covenant
[44:08] verse 18. in the same day the Lord made
[44:11] a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy
[44:12] seed have I given this land
[44:14] now they weren't going to possess it for
[44:16] 400 more years
[44:18] now none of us would like to wait 400
[44:19] years for a promise why because we're
[44:21] going to die
[44:23] but this is what God was telling Abraham
[44:25] and he it was his job to pass this down
[44:30] Abraham just he said go out and look at
[44:32] look from coast to coast from east to
[44:34] west your land your seat is going to
[44:36] possess all this and it took 400 years
[44:39] but then they started possessing it
[44:41] right and then what was it uh was it 200
[44:43] more years later David finally got those
[44:45] Outer Banks of the territory and David
[44:48] finally possessed all the pieces of the
[44:50] promised land that God had given
[44:53] sometimes the promises of God go slowly
[44:55] church right
[44:57] sometimes but we always want to see the
[44:59] Promise right now give me the promise
[45:00] now sometimes the God's clock moves kind
[45:04] of slow
[45:05] we want to speed up and Lord I want all
[45:07] these problems I want all these
[45:08] Blessings Now and God said you got to
[45:10] wait on my time
[45:12] Hallelujah the Divine time lose lose a
[45:15] lot slower than what we want
[45:18] in other words we might not see the
[45:20] Rapture in our life but we can go if we
[45:22] have to go down to the Grave we'll say
[45:24] with our last breath we'll say surely
[45:26] Jesus come quickly Lord Jesus Hallelujah
[45:30] with our last breath amen just like John
[45:32] Wesley's last breath what was his last
[45:35] last breath he said he said but the best
[45:37] part of his is god with is with us
[45:39] he died saying thank God God is with us
[45:42] now why can't we live and say God Is
[45:44] With Us amen
[45:46] we should be able to live and say thank
[45:48] God that God is with us praise God
[45:51] amen if he died like that we ought to
[45:53] live like that praise God
[45:55] amen thank God
[45:59] see they want the land they weren't
[46:00] going to possess it for 400 years but
[46:02] God's promise can never fail
[46:05] they inherited the land from the river
[46:07] of Egypt to the great river Euphrates
[46:09] and you can look it up it's in second
[46:10] chronicles where David actually
[46:12] possesses all the way to the river
[46:13] Euphrates
[46:15] he finally possesses that all these
[46:17] hundreds of years later
[46:19] and then he names those Seven Nations
[46:20] that they defeat okay
[46:22] so I want you to see that Covenant this
[46:25] proves when when God makes a covenant
[46:26] the man has nothing to do with it in
[46:29] other words God just chose that man by
[46:31] grace and God is going to help that man
[46:33] obey all the promises
[46:36] hallelujah
[46:38] amen hallelujah God in other words God
[46:41] had a special chosen person and God was
[46:43] going to help Abraham and Sarah believe
[46:45] they didn't believe all the time
[46:47] as the timeline says right now look
[46:49] church right after this right after this
[46:52] Mighty visitation Abraham lets his wife
[46:55] talking into marrying another woman
[46:56] Hagar
[46:58] Abraham's move by the vision oh God told
[47:01] me my seeds like this he said it hasn't
[47:03] happened yet and Sarah's like well maybe
[47:04] it's through my handmade maybe that's
[47:05] how it's going to come okay Sarah
[47:08] I'll take another woman
[47:10] of course his flesh probably like that
[47:12] but God didn't like it
[47:14] right
[47:15] think about that and now did God give up
[47:17] on Abraham
[47:18] God's not going to give up on you either
[47:20] praise God that's the encouragement we
[47:22] can get out here because the Bible said
[47:24] we walk in the steps of Father Abraham
[47:26] praise God
[47:28] amen now that was an awful mistake right
[47:30] just like we make awful mistakes I'm
[47:32] going to emphasize that just as much
[47:34] I make awful mistakes but yet God
[47:36] doesn't leave me
[47:38] I fail God right we fall short but God
[47:41] stays with us he keeps pointing us he
[47:43] keeps having visitations to us amen
[47:46] where he lets us know he's still with us
[47:48] praise God
[47:50] he's going to bring his promise to pass
[47:53] and then
[47:55] the next chapter God says you got to
[47:58] circumcise all the males ishmael's born
[48:00] he's getting he says you got to
[48:03] circumcise all the mess and then
[48:04] remember 17 let's read 17-17 Genesis 17
[48:07] 17.
[48:11] now one reason Abraham laughed was
[48:13] because God had not yet God didn't tell
[48:15] him at the beginning that it was going
[48:16] to come through Sarah
[48:19] now the right thing to do is just wait
[48:21] on God not try to make God's word come
[48:24] to pass
[48:26] but just wait on God obey God my brother
[48:28] I said live a humble Christian Life
[48:31] don't make yourself odd to be a
[48:33] Christian don't make yourself some
[48:34] strange and Supernatural Christian that
[48:37] as sees all these visions and dreams
[48:40] which you might you know or how you hear
[48:41] all these voices all the time and but
[48:43] then they don't turn out to be true
[48:45] now that's nobody here but that's what
[48:48] some people do in other churches try to
[48:49] make themselves so mystical and I'm a
[48:51] minor Prophet I'm the great one that's
[48:53] the rise
[48:54] a bunch of nonsense
[48:56] but man should just live a humble life
[48:57] like Abraham praise God
[48:59] and obey the word of God train yourself
[49:01] train your family your friends train
[49:03] yourselves to obey God's word hallelujah
[49:06] live a separated life under Christ
[49:10] you know Genesis 17 17.
[49:12] now here's where God tells Abraham it's
[49:15] going to come through Sarah
[49:17] actually let's let's uh
[49:19] read 15 and God said to Abraham ask for
[49:22] Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her
[49:23] name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name
[49:25] and I'll bless her and give thee a son
[49:27] also of her yea I will bless her and she
[49:29] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[49:31] people shall be of her then Abraham fell
[49:33] on his face and laughed and said in his
[49:35] heart shall a child be born unto him
[49:38] that's a hundred years old and shall God
[49:40] that is 90 years old bear
[49:42] I'm sorry is there Sarah that is 90
[49:44] years old bear
[49:45] notice he didn't he said this in his
[49:48] heart he didn't say it out loud like God
[49:50] how is Sarah gonna bear he just said it
[49:52] in his heart but he's laughing
[49:54] he falls down now church we know God has
[49:56] a sense of humor
[49:58] but this was not a joke by God
[50:01] this was not a sense of humor moment
[50:02] like when Jesus said go tell her that
[50:05] fox that today I preach and tomorrow
[50:06] I'll keep preaching you know
[50:08] he called Herod a fox that was a god
[50:10] sense of humor because that's what he
[50:12] was a Sly old Fox
[50:13] right he listened to John the Baptist
[50:16] but then he let his he let his second
[50:18] wife and the daughter dance sexy dances
[50:20] he's a Sly Fox sometimes he obeyed John
[50:22] the Baptist sometimes he was in the
[50:24] sensual things of the world God help us
[50:25] to be holy praise God
[50:28] that's a fox right
[50:30] so God has a sense of humor there in
[50:32] Jesus but this is not God trying to make
[50:34] Abraham laugh this is God trying to
[50:35] raise Abraham's faith
[50:38] didn't remember Church Abraham's
[50:40] laughter could not stop the promise of
[50:43] God hallelujah
[50:45] Abraham's unbelief could not stop God's
[50:48] word from coming to pass your belief my
[50:50] unbelief any of our unbelief will not
[50:52] stop God's promise Hallelujah
[50:56] in other words God will push aside your
[50:58] laughter God will push aside and say I'm
[51:00] moving on anyway you just got to follow
[51:01] praise God
[51:04] your life and doesn't change me you're
[51:06] laughing doesn't move me in fact I knew
[51:08] You're gonna laugh praise God
[51:10] he knew he was going to laugh but look
[51:12] he just had these experiences he makes a
[51:14] mistake and then God tries to encourage
[51:16] him he gets a covenant and then he
[51:18] laughs at God again
[51:20] he laughs I should say again he laughed
[51:22] at God for the first time
[51:24] my goodness
[51:26] and so Abraham is not this model of
[51:28] total Perfection he never made a mistake
[51:32] he was a holy uh perfect Christian all
[51:35] the time like we'd say
[51:37] he had his failures Church
[51:39] he had his mistakes
[51:41] he partially obey God he completely ran
[51:44] away from God's will for his life
[51:46] that'd be today like somebody running
[51:47] away from our church right or somebody
[51:50] moving away from our church
[51:52] right or somebody who has a good church
[51:54] and they totally leave complete they try
[51:56] to get as far away from it that's the
[51:57] one Abraham did but Abraham was still a
[51:59] child of God
[52:01] and God still brought him back
[52:02] hallelujah amen
[52:04] that's how we know he's a child of God
[52:06] God brings you back Hallelujah
[52:08] you can't stay away too long so God said
[52:11] sir you come on back praise God
[52:13] [Music]
[52:15] that's amen
[52:17] all of us they're so vain God's gonna
[52:19] say come on back now
[52:21] it's time to come back in fact I'm going
[52:23] to make the situation so bad you've got
[52:24] to come back
[52:27] I'm gonna let your like Abraham I'm
[52:28] gonna let your lies catch up to you
[52:30] or you don't want to be around those
[52:31] kings that want your wives anymore or
[52:34] your wife I like to leave this guy he's
[52:36] after my wife all the time I'm gonna
[52:37] leave him I'm gonna go back to where I'm
[52:38] supposed to be
[52:40] may God make us so uncomfortable in our
[52:42] mistakes that it drives us to obedience
[52:44] praise God
[52:46] amen
[52:49] now and then I want to I gotta slide on
[52:51] this I just want to show this one maybe
[52:53] I'll let me skip ahead I want to go to
[52:54] where the Lord appears to him in just a
[52:55] moment so let's
[52:57] now so far what what have we learned
[53:00] each time Abraham moved by faith it was
[53:03] an act of obedience right
[53:05] so in other words if someone says I'm
[53:07] going to take a step of Faith what
[53:09] they're saying what they should be
[53:10] saying is I'm going to obey exactly what
[53:12] God Said
[53:14] taking a step of faith is not hoping it
[53:16] happens like just jumping off a cliff I
[53:18] hope somebody catches me That's what
[53:20] Satan tried to do with Jesus
[53:22] see he didn't do it because God didn't
[53:24] tell him to do it praise God Amen
[53:27] a step of faith is a step of obedience
[53:30] is what I'm trying to say
[53:31] Amen in other words Abraham was a man of
[53:33] Faith which means Abraham obeyed God and
[53:36] that's what the Bible said by faith
[53:38] Abraham was called out and he went to a
[53:40] place he'd never been
[53:42] to receive her inheritance he obeyed so
[53:45] Faith obeys the word of God hallelujah
[53:49] and he went out not knowing he didn't
[53:51] know all the details but he still obeyed
[53:53] all that God showed him
[53:55] and that's what we do we obey all the
[53:57] details in God's word that we know
[53:59] that's why we read it every day that's
[54:01] why we say I'm going to go back and hear
[54:02] more preaching because there's more
[54:04] details I got to obey
[54:06] Hallelujah
[54:08] so it's not a step ahead well I hope God
[54:10] will do this I hope God I mean that's
[54:12] okay to have those but that's not faith
[54:15] faith is I obey what God told me to do
[54:18] Hallelujah so we see each move of
[54:21] Abraham every time he moved by faith it
[54:23] was the act of obedience
[54:26] praise God
[54:27] I just want to make that clear I've
[54:28] covered that over the years but I want
[54:29] to cover that now
[54:31] these are a different type of subject
[54:33] but I want to read these because I'm
[54:34] reading through the whole book for if
[54:36] they which are other law be heirs faith
[54:38] is made void so if keeping a list of
[54:40] rules uh
[54:42] if keeping enlisted rules is the right
[54:44] step then there's no there's no need of
[54:46] faith
[54:47] right remember faith is just trust
[54:49] confidence in God
[54:51] so if your Works uh can bring God's
[54:54] promise to pass them we don't need to
[54:55] trust God you can trust in yourself
[54:57] in other words it's the great argument
[54:58] saying it's a great idea that we cannot
[55:01] work and earn salvation we've got to
[55:03] believe God and when we believe we obey
[55:06] God
[55:08] and the promise made of none effects so
[55:10] if we can work it up and earn it then we
[55:12] don't need God's promises we can save
[55:13] ourselves but we know we can't do that
[55:16] because the law Works Wrath right for
[55:19] where no law is there's no transgression
[55:22] now there's a verse here
[55:24] I want to get to where the Bible said
[55:26] God wink to ignorance and it's in Acts
[55:28] 17 29 where there's no law there's no
[55:31] transgression
[55:33] so if you drive down the street and
[55:34] there's no sign there that says you know
[55:36] 45 miles per hour which I got to pay
[55:38] attention to more
[55:41] sadly but if there's no law if there's
[55:44] no sign there then
[55:45] they can't throw you in jail or they
[55:48] can't give you a ticket right because
[55:49] there's no sign there there's no law
[55:51] there but if there is a sign there then
[55:53] they can give you a ticket
[55:55] which I know about
[55:57] for as much then as we are The Offspring
[55:59] of God we ought not to think that the
[56:01] godhead is like a gold or silver or
[56:02] stone Graven by art or man's device
[56:04] there's no piece of art this is we know
[56:06] this is not God it's just a picture that
[56:08] represents God but there's no gold or
[56:10] stone or there's no statue that that God
[56:13] is actually containing that statue
[56:16] and the Bible said the times of this
[56:17] ignorance God winked at got winked at it
[56:21] but now he commands everywhere all men
[56:23] everywhere to repent
[56:25] because he's appointed a day in which he
[56:28] will judge the world in righteousness by
[56:29] the man whom he hath ordained Christ
[56:31] whereof he hath given Assurance unto all
[56:34] men in that he raised him from the dead
[56:36] oh my the one who's going to judge the
[56:38] world is the one who raised from the
[56:40] dead praise God only one man has done
[56:42] that Christ
[56:43] I want you to notice this wink at
[56:45] ignorance
[56:47] it doesn't mean God overlooked their
[56:49] idolatry like God was okay it's okay for
[56:51] you to worship statues that's not what
[56:53] it means
[56:54] because the Bible says all those that
[56:57] that don't have the Jewish law are a law
[56:59] unto themselves because God has written
[57:01] right and wrong in every heart and we
[57:03] already preach on that that's in Romans
[57:04] 2. in other words whether you have a
[57:06] Bible or not you're still accountable on
[57:08] the day of judgment because God put
[57:10] right and wrong inside your hearts
[57:13] okay
[57:14] so this means this meaning of God winked
[57:17] at it winked at ignorance means less
[57:19] severe punishment
[57:21] because they had a lack of knowledge
[57:24] so all these Gentiles without Moses's
[57:26] law they did idolatry and things like
[57:28] that let's say they went to hell well
[57:30] their punishment will be less severe
[57:32] than the Jews that had idols and went to
[57:35] hell
[57:36] because the Jews knew better
[57:39] right and God just winked at it God
[57:41] overlooked and said well they didn't
[57:42] have it but they still knew it was wrong
[57:45] like any man knows any man knows a
[57:48] wooden statue won't talk back to you
[57:49] like a totem pole will never talk back
[57:52] to you
[57:53] any man that's honest and goes up there
[57:55] the totem pole would never talk back
[57:57] it's just it's a
[57:59] it's a any man knows that praise God
[58:02] any man knows that
[58:04] but the Bible said here in the Bible
[58:05] Jesus tells us here the servant that
[58:08] knew the Lord's will and prepared not
[58:10] himself neither did according to his
[58:12] will shall be beaten with many stripes
[58:14] in other words the more preaching you
[58:16] hear if you disobey it the greater your
[58:18] punishment is
[58:19] but the more preaching you hear that you
[58:21] obey it the greater your reward is amen
[58:25] praise God Amen
[58:27] but he that knew not those that didn't
[58:30] know so much of the Bible and did things
[58:32] worthy of Stripes shall be beaten with
[58:34] few stripes
[58:35] For unto whomsoever much is given of him
[58:37] shall much be required
[58:40] and to whom men have committed much of
[58:42] him they will ask them more
[58:44] so we so God has given us much
[58:47] understanding of the Bible but we've got
[58:48] more responsibility now
[58:51] you've got to obey it come on Abraham
[58:53] we've got to obey
[58:54] we got to stay separated from Sodom and
[58:56] Gomorrah you gotta gotta be train
[58:58] yourself up in the word of God
[58:59] hallelujah train yourself up don't live
[59:02] in torment live in peace Hallelujah
[59:05] don't live in torment live in Victory
[59:07] amen don't live in torment living
[59:09] happiness and joy praise God ah
[59:13] thank God
[59:15] like my testimony Kyle and Chris I
[59:17] didn't get saved until I was 19. so for
[59:19] 19 well some of those years I don't
[59:21] remember but for let's say 12 of those
[59:22] years eight and thirteen those years I
[59:24] was living in torment because I was
[59:25] running from God
[59:26] I was trying to drown it out with dirty
[59:28] magazines and dirty movies and on Sports
[59:30] and that it's only pleasurable for a
[59:34] little season
[59:35] sin is only pleasure over a season but I
[59:38] was living in torment until I finally
[59:39] repented and when I raised my hands and
[59:42] cried I felt like all the way to the
[59:44] world fell off me
[59:45] and I drove back to Akron I was on cloud
[59:47] nine I took down all my swimsuit
[59:50] pictures I took I threw away all my
[59:51] Snoop Dogg and Metallica said I'm a
[59:54] brand new creation I'm a brand new man
[59:56] amen where's that Bible praise God
[59:59] somebody give me that Bible amen
[1:00:02] you know they gave me a Bible as a
[1:00:03] graduation president I never opened it
[1:00:05] until I got saved now I'm so glad they
[1:00:07] gave it to me I started highlighting
[1:00:09] that up on the first night I got back I
[1:00:10] remember Sunday night I started reading
[1:00:12] I think I started in Matthew I think I
[1:00:14] started Matthew
[1:00:15] Hallelujah
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:18] it became real
[1:00:20] it became a life of Peace a victory yeah
[1:00:23] I got trials but they don't last forever
[1:00:25] praise God trials don't last troubles
[1:00:27] don't last always that song says
[1:00:28] troubles don't last always amen
[1:00:32] now see when God Winks at ignorance it
[1:00:34] just means less severe punishment
[1:00:36] because they lack the knowledge because
[1:00:37] they but they could have cried out for
[1:00:39] more knowledge
[1:00:40] the Bible said all those that not shall
[1:00:42] shall have it open all those who ask
[1:00:44] shall receive
[1:00:46] all those who seek after it shall find
[1:00:48] it
[1:00:49] that's what the Bible says everybody has
[1:00:51] a desire to know God
[1:00:53] therefore it is of faith
[1:00:55] that it might be by grace
[1:00:59] to the end the promise might be sure
[1:01:02] which is stable fast or firm to all the
[1:01:05] seed how many want to Sure promise
[1:01:09] I want a sure problem I want a stable
[1:01:11] promise that that God is going to save
[1:01:13] me
[1:01:15] and this is not to that only witches of
[1:01:17] the law but to that also which is the
[1:01:19] the faith of Abraham who is the father
[1:01:21] of us let's say the word all can we oh a
[1:01:25] double l oh the promises of Abraham is
[1:01:28] to all of you today praise God
[1:01:31] it's to every one of us praise God the
[1:01:34] same promises Abraham had are our
[1:01:36] promises to God will bless you
[1:01:38] Hallelujah he'll bless your seed he'll
[1:01:40] be with you he'll forgive you he'll give
[1:01:42] you eternal life all the blessings of
[1:01:44] Abraham are to you praise God
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:48] so see This Promise of blessing and not
[1:01:51] just not just uh not not just future
[1:01:54] blessing but blessings now
[1:01:57] these blessings of the Bible said
[1:01:59] Abraham's he would bless everybody on
[1:02:01] this earth now
[1:02:03] now we know God makes some poor some
[1:02:05] rich but God promised to bless us to
[1:02:08] some degree naturally now if we obey the
[1:02:10] word of God
[1:02:11] This Promise of future blessings and
[1:02:14] present is through faith which is a gift
[1:02:17] so to get the promise you got to receive
[1:02:19] God's gift
[1:02:22] let me just pretend here

[1:02:26] this isn't too far from the truth
[1:02:28] I say honey this is your first phone
[1:02:30] it's a gift from me to you

[1:02:35] promises through faith which is a gift
[1:02:37] that's Faith hold that up that's Faith
[1:02:38] remember say faith right Faith that's a
[1:02:41] gift
[1:02:42] and now this promise that was a gift
[1:02:44] showing that she's going to receive
[1:02:46] whatever later on you know
[1:02:48] you're gonna once I die you're gonna
[1:02:49] have all my

[1:03:16] that's a firm testimony that I'm going
[1:03:18] to keep my promise amen
[1:03:20] the fact that you have faith the fact
[1:03:22] that you have trust in God that's the
[1:03:25] evidence you get the promise amen this
[1:03:27] is the evidence she's going to get my
[1:03:28] inheritance or however we do it let me
[1:03:30] get it if the Lord Terry is still that
[1:03:32] long
[1:03:33] that's the that's the evidence and this
[1:03:35] is firm this is sure God don't break his
[1:03:37] promises amen
[1:03:40] not a man that he's alive praise God
[1:03:44] God is a supernatural eternal spirit
[1:03:46] that keeps every promise Hallelujah amen
[1:03:49] he's not moved by emotions he's not
[1:03:51] moved by the world he's not moved by
[1:03:53] politics he's moved by one thing that's
[1:03:55] his pleasure Hallelujah
[1:03:57] oh Glory
[1:04:00] and Abraham's your spiritual father so
[1:04:02] we call it and remember Jesus said we
[1:04:04] call no man on this Earth father
[1:04:07] now that's different than saying Daddy
[1:04:08] or something like that speaking of
[1:04:09] spiritual leaders the Bible says Jesus
[1:04:11] said call no man your father upon the
[1:04:13] Earth for one is your father which is in
[1:04:15] heaven so never call me Father Jesse
[1:04:17] because I'm not your daddy
[1:04:20] now my children can call me Daddy
[1:04:23] but Jesus had called no man on the earth
[1:04:25] father
[1:04:25] now here's why Paul's uh with the Bible
[1:04:28] I don't have the verse but the Bible
[1:04:29] says later
[1:04:31] um the Bible says in job don't give men
[1:04:33] flattering titles because it leads to
[1:04:34] their downfall
[1:04:36] right that's why we don't give like oh
[1:04:39] your Holy Father Jesse
[1:04:41] I ain't holy except Jesus inside of me
[1:04:43] praise God my body ain't holy my mind
[1:04:46] ain't always holy the only thing holy is
[1:04:47] the holy spirit inside me praise God
[1:04:49] so I'm not holy all the time right like
[1:04:52] I only got the holy spirit in here
[1:04:53] praise God
[1:04:55] that's what the Bible said don't call no
[1:04:56] man father
[1:04:58] Jesse nice to see you today don't bow
[1:05:00] down to me I'm nothing I need to bow
[1:05:02] down before God hallelujah
[1:05:05] he said I write not these things to
[1:05:08] shame you Paul says but as my beloved
[1:05:10] Sons I warn you so it's a warning
[1:05:12] for though you have ten thousand
[1:05:14] instructors in Christ so there's lots of
[1:05:15] preachers out there right you have not
[1:05:17] many fathers
[1:05:18] for in Christ Jesus I've begotten you
[1:05:20] through the gospel so the person who
[1:05:22] first won you to Christ they're like a
[1:05:24] spiritual father to you
[1:05:26] right as long as you like the preacher
[1:05:27] or whoever it is whoever one whichever
[1:05:29] preacher you first heard and you stay
[1:05:31] under their teaching they're like a
[1:05:32] spiritual father to you
[1:05:34] okay so for me the spiritual father for
[1:05:36] me was the chapel brother that's why I
[1:05:38] got saved in the chapel those preachers
[1:05:40] were like my spiritual fathers I'm
[1:05:42] thankful for them but then I come to
[1:05:43] this greater Revelation uh the Bible
[1:05:46] calls it the restoration of all things
[1:05:48] and acts we come to this restoration
[1:05:50] Ministry and now brother Brooks is like
[1:05:52] my spiritual father
[1:05:54] he's out in Iowa
[1:05:55] he was a he's the one that told me about
[1:05:57] Christ but got me to Christ I'll take
[1:05:59] that back down but now God doesn't do
[1:06:00] that though just so you know God doesn't
[1:06:02] give out gifts and give them back
[1:06:03] Hallelujah
[1:06:07] so so see we acknowledge the men as
[1:06:09] fathers well this was this man was a
[1:06:11] spiritual father to me but we avoid
[1:06:13] calling them Father because the Bible
[1:06:15] said flattering titles yeah let me look
[1:06:16] it up here get your Bibles let's go to
[1:06:18] the Book of Job I'll show you that in
[1:06:19] job
[1:06:20] I just read that a few uh days ago
[1:06:25] that's why I always want you to call me
[1:06:26] uh just call me brother
[1:06:28] because I'm your brother
[1:06:31] it's job 32 yeah there's job 32.
[1:06:39] job 32 uh 30 21 22.
[1:06:44] the Bible said let me I pray or let me
[1:06:47] not I pray you accept any man's person
[1:06:49] neither let me give flattering titles
[1:06:51] unto men
[1:06:52] for I know not to give flowering titles
[1:06:54] in so doing my maker would soon take me
[1:06:57] away
[1:06:58] now that means from his presence right
[1:07:00] because people can live all all types of
[1:07:02] years on the earth and we have all kinds
[1:07:04] of titles holy Reverend Dr Divine
[1:07:07] whatever father Divine whatever they
[1:07:10] want to call them
[1:07:11] but that means God's presence will leave
[1:07:14] that person when they start flattering
[1:07:16] themselves
[1:07:17] see that's why we shouldn't flatter
[1:07:18] anybody we should tell people the truth
[1:07:21] and this is right in the Bible right
[1:07:22] this is Romans let's write in the Bible
[1:07:24] so just so you know now I do like when
[1:07:26] people call me like Pastor sometimes
[1:07:27] that face makes me feel good but if that
[1:07:29] becomes a stumbling zone I'll let you
[1:07:30] know praise God or you might know too if
[1:07:32] my life goes off the word of God
[1:07:34] but I'd like to be called your brother
[1:07:36] we should all call one other brothers
[1:07:37] praise God
[1:07:39] now go to verse 17 as is written I made
[1:07:41] thee a father of many and I'm almost
[1:07:43] ready to close here give me 15 more
[1:07:44] minutes here
[1:07:49] give myself a physical reminder I may be
[1:07:51] a father of many nations Abraham before
[1:07:53] him whom he believed even God who
[1:07:55] quickeneth the dead and called those
[1:07:58] things which not be as though they were
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:03] Abraham believed God and Abraham
[1:08:05] quickened the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:08:07] Sarah's womb was dead it wasn't produced
[1:08:09] in any eggs right
[1:08:11] sorry to get so graphic sometimes but
[1:08:13] Abraham's loins were not producing seed
[1:08:15] anymore they were dead that's why
[1:08:17] Abraham labs
[1:08:23] how could God how could I have pleasure
[1:08:25] with Sarah that's what Sarah said how
[1:08:26] can I pleasure with my Lord God you
[1:08:28] really told a good one right there wow
[1:08:29] you're quite quite funny Lord
[1:08:31] God's like I ain't joking
[1:08:34] I don't tell lies I don't tell jokes
[1:08:36] like that
[1:08:38] but God had to make their deadness alive
[1:08:41] again
[1:08:42] and Abraham I'll show you the point at
[1:08:44] some point Abraham started calling those
[1:08:46] things that were not as though they were
[1:08:50] in other words Abraham got to a spot
[1:08:52] where he said my loins are alive
[1:08:55] even though they were he was still 99
[1:08:58] year old Abraham
[1:09:00] hey Abraham you're supposed to be the
[1:09:02] father of Nations where's all your seed
[1:09:03] bless God I'm going to have it pretty
[1:09:05] soon by God's grace
[1:09:07] I don't see any uh I don't see any
[1:09:09] children they have other than Ishmael
[1:09:10] Sarah's not going to have any kids well
[1:09:12] bless God she's going to because God
[1:09:14] said so praise God God's Gonna Change My
[1:09:17] Body
[1:09:18] he's going to take away my deadness and
[1:09:20] he's going to put life inside of me
[1:09:22] that's what the Bible said
[1:09:24] oh I got this cook in my back but thank
[1:09:26] God I'm gonna get a brand new body
[1:09:28] someday hallelujah thank God
[1:09:30] my eyes are blurry but one day I'm going
[1:09:32] to see a promised son come right through
[1:09:34] Sarah amen oh oh he started calling
[1:09:37] those things that were not as though
[1:09:39] they were and people thought it was an
[1:09:41] insane man
[1:09:42] but sometimes the promises of God make
[1:09:45] you look insane praise God
[1:09:47] because the unbelievers can't believe
[1:09:49] God's promise but to you God's promise
[1:09:51] is true God's promise is real and so you
[1:09:54] can call those things that are not as
[1:09:56] though they already are praise God
[1:09:59] amen amen hallelujah trusting in the
[1:10:02] will of God hallelujah
[1:10:04] he called them as though they were even
[1:10:06] though they weren't
[1:10:09] so like it would have been like when
[1:10:10] Austin was gone you know the girls would
[1:10:12] have said Austin's coming back Austin's
[1:10:14] coming back that's probably what they
[1:10:15] were doing you know
[1:10:16] Austin's coming if it was God's will
[1:10:18] which it was
[1:10:20] or someone's sick and you say that
[1:10:22] person is going to be made well Jose is
[1:10:23] going to be well right Jose's heart
[1:10:25] condition is going to be well right
[1:10:26] really yeah is that what happened this
[1:10:29] year
[1:10:29] Hallelujah we called those things that
[1:10:32] were not as though they were
[1:10:34] hallelujah amen
[1:10:37] but it's got to be first revealed by God
[1:10:40] it can't be hope it's got to be faith
[1:10:44] now now I've said this before there's
[1:10:46] nothing wrong with hoping someone's
[1:10:47] going to get better you hope all you
[1:10:48] want but you wait until God reveals it
[1:10:50] by faith then you know for sure like
[1:10:53] with that dog right we're hoping the dog
[1:10:55] gets better it's a small thing to us it
[1:10:57] might be a great thing to this person
[1:10:58] we're hoping it but if a word if a word
[1:11:01] from God a revelation would come now
[1:11:03] you've got faith in that
[1:11:04] that dog's gonna be well or whatever it
[1:11:06] may be that's what I'm saying it's so
[1:11:08] okay to help it's okay to hope hope hope
[1:11:10] but it's different when you got faith
[1:11:12] praise God
[1:11:13] because that's I know what God wants me
[1:11:15] to do I know what God's will is
[1:11:17] now here's what Abraham did who against
[1:11:20] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:11:22] become the father of many nations now
[1:11:24] look he was going against hope
[1:11:26] all the hopes was gone in other words
[1:11:28] brother Brandon says oh the hopes are
[1:11:30] gone but he still believed God Can Make
[1:11:32] Me a father of many nations amen
[1:11:35] I have no reason to hope the only source
[1:11:38] of hope I have is God's word amen
[1:11:41] church we all take encouragement from
[1:11:43] that if nothing else speaks of any
[1:11:45] positive for us and we find something
[1:11:47] positive in the Bible let's believe the
[1:11:49] Bible praise God
[1:11:52] believed against hope there was no hopes
[1:11:55] so he had hope even though nothing told
[1:11:57] him to Hope
[1:11:59] according to that which is spoken so shy
[1:12:01] so it was based upon God's word so shall
[1:12:03] thy seed be
[1:12:05] and being not weak in faith so now we
[1:12:08] know what weak faith is
[1:12:10] weak faith is hearing God's word and not
[1:12:12] believing it not calling it as though it
[1:12:14] is
[1:12:16] Abraham considered not his own body now
[1:12:19] dead where he was about 100 years old
[1:12:21] neither the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:12:24] so again his loins weren't where they
[1:12:26] were dead no more no more production of
[1:12:28] seed right and she had no more
[1:12:30] production of eggs no ovaries weren't
[1:12:33] producing anything but Abraham didn't
[1:12:35] even consider that because he had
[1:12:36] experience with God
[1:12:38] Amen even after he left God
[1:12:42] even after he lied
[1:12:45] you might have lied you might have left
[1:12:46] God you might do all these things the
[1:12:48] thing is come back to God Amen
[1:12:51] come back to God hear God's voice again
[1:12:53] Hallelujah
[1:12:56] God will speak to you again got to
[1:12:58] encourage you God will make sure he
[1:13:00] keeps his promise to you praise God
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:06] we make all these promises and sometimes
[1:13:08] break them but when God makes a promise
[1:13:10] he ain't breaking not on one of them
[1:13:11] amen glory praise God
[1:13:14] and he'll be with us even if we break a
[1:13:16] promise or make a make a mistake he'll
[1:13:18] be with us praise God
[1:13:20] now brother Adam says he reads this and
[1:13:22] brothers says the brother man was a
[1:13:24] prophet who died in 1965 just you know
[1:13:26] by the cow he's a mighty man of God a
[1:13:27] wonderful servant of God maybe I should
[1:13:29] have left him too high but he was a
[1:13:30] prophet of God true prophet of God
[1:13:33] and he reads us he says who against hope
[1:13:35] he said against hope all hopes is gone
[1:13:37] oh every time I get it feeling a little
[1:13:39] can I say it depressed
[1:13:41] here's the chapter I turn to Romans
[1:13:44] chapter 4.
[1:13:45] so church when you when you know you're
[1:13:48] getting depressed or you know you're
[1:13:49] getting discouraged you need a knockout
[1:13:51] punch for the devil
[1:13:53] remember I preached that sermon knockout
[1:13:54] punches so when brother Brown was
[1:13:56] getting depressed he said I need to
[1:13:57] knock out Satan where do I go where am I
[1:13:59] going to get my my strength I'm going to
[1:14:01] get it from Romans chapter 4.
[1:14:03] Hey brother I'm gonna start reading
[1:14:05] saying oh he said against hope he
[1:14:07] believed in Hope Oh I should hope
[1:14:09] I may be a father of Nations he called
[1:14:12] those things that were not as though
[1:14:14] they were God said so
[1:14:16] who again so believed in Hope Hallelujah
[1:14:19] so anytime we're blue we need to find a
[1:14:21] God said so promise
[1:14:24] that's Satan's job to trick us deceive
[1:14:27] us to try to get us to go down into
[1:14:28] Sodom but it's God's job to help us get
[1:14:31] out of there praise God
[1:14:33] it's God's job to give us knockout
[1:14:35] punches to knock the devil stop talking
[1:14:37] to me Satan get behind me praise God
[1:14:39] Amen
[1:14:40] give him a couple Jabs or right cross an
[1:14:43] uppercut knock him out so he's not
[1:14:45] bothering you so you're bothering him
[1:14:47] praise God
[1:14:48] amen
[1:14:50] praise God in other words you're
[1:14:52] testifying about God's word you're
[1:14:54] telling people about Jesus you're giving
[1:14:55] God glory praise God
[1:14:57] even if you don't feel like it brother
[1:14:59] Austin
[1:15:00] Hallelujah like I like you do you do a
[1:15:02] good job you have you'll have uh
[1:15:03] migraines and you'll just keep giving
[1:15:05] God glory
[1:15:06] you'll ask for prayer even when having a
[1:15:08] migraine now that's real good faith
[1:15:09] right there do you have a migraine today
[1:15:10] bye anyway okay well we're gonna pray
[1:15:12] for you at the end buddy
[1:15:15] yeah
[1:15:17] that's your seat of Abraham brother amen
[1:15:20] thank God
[1:15:23] so brother when I'm depressed I go to
[1:15:25] Romans 4 that will encourage me to
[1:15:28] overcome my depression
[1:15:31] so from church he battled a critical
[1:15:33] spirit he's critical of other people
[1:15:34] they're always he's always nitpicking at
[1:15:36] others any battle depression
[1:15:39] he battled fear alone he's like he's
[1:15:40] like every time the devil the devil come
[1:15:42] and say you have no friends nobody loves
[1:15:44] you and then he say he'll go out in the
[1:15:45] parking lot remember that and he'll look
[1:15:47] at the license plates of the people that
[1:15:48] came to hear him preach they'd be from
[1:15:50] Alabama Georgia and he lived in Indiana
[1:15:54] so he's sick that in the devil's face
[1:15:56] the devil you told me nobody loves me
[1:15:57] people will drive from other states just
[1:15:59] to come hear me preach so devil you're a
[1:16:01] liar here's a knockout punch
[1:16:04] Hallelujah Jesus Loves Me his people
[1:16:07] love me I got friends that care about me
[1:16:09] amen I believe God's promise I'm a child
[1:16:11] of Abraham praise God
[1:16:13] don't let the devil lie to us
[1:16:16] we got to knock him out with the word of
[1:16:18] God
[1:16:18] we've got to overcome our depression
[1:16:20] overcome our anxiety our fears
[1:16:22] Hallelujah and we do that by the word of
[1:16:25] God
[1:16:26] amen now be not weak in faith you
[1:16:28] consider not his own body now dead even
[1:16:30] though it was dead now think about that
[1:16:32] as a man amen things weren't working I'm
[1:16:34] just going to say like that nothing was
[1:16:36] working and he said it's going to work
[1:16:37] someday
[1:16:41] this testosterone is going to kick in
[1:16:42] again someday
[1:16:43] it's not working right now but it's
[1:16:45] going to kick in
[1:16:48] it hasn't worked for years but it's
[1:16:50] coming back
[1:16:51] that's Faith amen why because God said
[1:16:55] so amen
[1:16:56] God said you and Sarah will have a son
[1:17:00] and you'll call him what you did when I
[1:17:02] first came to you you'll call him
[1:17:03] laughter Isaac because you laughed at me
[1:17:06] to remind you never laugh at the promise
[1:17:09] of God hallelujah
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:14] [Applause]
[1:17:16] church at 99 years old he laughed
[1:17:20] and church think about this but Austin
[1:17:22] within one year God was going to do the
[1:17:25] mightiest miracle in Abraham's life he
[1:17:27] was one year away from that promise and
[1:17:28] he still didn't believe it
[1:17:30] he was less than a year away
[1:17:32] can you imagine that think about that
[1:17:35] church which miracles do we want to see
[1:17:36] are just right around the corner
[1:17:39] which ones are just one year away oh if
[1:17:42] we could look into the future
[1:17:44] I wish I wish YouTube had a feature
[1:17:46] where I could scroll into the future
[1:17:47] what's future sermons and what
[1:17:48] testimonies are going to happen I'd like
[1:17:50] to check ahead in advance
[1:17:52] I'll come back and prophesy
[1:17:55] of course I wouldn't be right
[1:17:57] so I'd like to know what is God going to
[1:17:59] do in a year
[1:18:00] what will happen next year of 2024
[1:18:03] what's going to happen what what works
[1:18:06] is Gaga knew we're one year away
[1:18:08] but one year away he was laughing saying
[1:18:11] oh Sarah and I right this is going to
[1:18:13] work like our body's gonna work again
[1:18:15] right right
[1:18:18] and God had to come and say no you are
[1:18:21] going to have it by Sarah
[1:18:23] God had to strengthen his faith and he
[1:18:25] did it within one year
[1:18:28] church we might be one year away from
[1:18:30] something great
[1:18:31] we've had great testimonies we have
[1:18:33] great wonderful testimonies God has done
[1:18:35] great things
[1:18:36] but there's more God might be visiting
[1:18:38] us and it might be one just one year
[1:18:40] away

[1:19:22] woman
[1:19:23] I'll get my wife up here
[1:19:27] see but how did Sarah do it Church how'd
[1:19:29] she do it same way Abraham did it praise
[1:19:31] God

[1:19:57] so she was serving God at some point God
[1:19:59] just started sending she's like I'm
[1:20:01] receiving the blessing I'm receiving the
[1:20:03] word of God I'm calling those things not
[1:20:06] as though they were
[1:20:08] my body's going to transform I'm going
[1:20:09] to get a body change brother Jose
[1:20:12] I'm going to walk right into my body
[1:20:14] change I'm gonna have a brand new body
[1:20:17] and his time as the days went on that
[1:20:19] year there
[1:20:20] she kept getting stronger and healthier
[1:20:22] and younger praise God Amen Hallelujah
[1:20:25] she's received strength from God God
[1:20:27] would would send his spirit and she'd
[1:20:30] see the transformations
[1:20:32] she looked in the mirror or the looking
[1:20:34] glasses well there's a lot less white
[1:20:36] hair today
[1:20:39] and look at that my back's straightened
[1:20:41] out a little bit I got a little bit I'm
[1:20:42] not all hunched over I'm a little bit
[1:20:43] straighter today
[1:20:45] Abraham it's happening
[1:20:47] he's like that's right honey you keep
[1:20:48] speaking it hallelujah it's going to
[1:20:51] come to pass amen
[1:20:53] I noticed today I was uh uh I don't need
[1:20:55] anybody walking stick anymore and I can
[1:20:56] walk without my walking stick I'm say
[1:20:58] I'm coming in the promise of God God
[1:21:00] sending his restraint and I'm receiving
[1:21:03] it praise God
[1:21:05] so they looked or said to both they had
[1:21:07] to receive both spiritual and physical
[1:21:10] strength to conceive
[1:21:11] they needed both
[1:21:13] in the spiritual Promises of God they've
[1:21:15] got to call those things that are that
[1:21:17] uh that they're not as though they were
[1:21:19] and they had to receive strength for
[1:21:20] their physical body
[1:21:23] now if they can believe for their body
[1:21:24] to be made young we can believe for our
[1:21:26] bodies to be healed
[1:21:28] no matter the sickness that's right
[1:21:30] no matter the condition
[1:21:33] right no matter no matter whatever the
[1:21:35] dysfunction is let's ask God say God
[1:21:37] send me your strength
[1:21:41] because if you send your strength things
[1:21:43] will start changing praise God
[1:21:46] Hallelujah
[1:21:48] the Bible said they both receive the
[1:21:50] strength as Romans 4 19 Abraham's body
[1:21:52] was dead he didn't have the testosterone
[1:21:54] to be a man right and reproduce you had
[1:21:57] to receive that strength so let's ask
[1:22:00] God for strength to believe his promises
[1:22:04] Hallelujah
[1:22:06] Lord I need strength to do what I need
[1:22:08] Lord I need strength to fulfill what
[1:22:09] promise
[1:22:10] what do you want me to do Lord give me
[1:22:12] strength and I'll do it
[1:22:16] despite my failures
[1:22:18] despite the times I Stumble if I could
[1:22:20] stumble here without hurting myself
[1:22:21] actually I could stumble Abraham
[1:22:23] stumbled many times but he kept getting
[1:22:26] up
[1:22:27] all righteous man falls seven times but
[1:22:30] the Lord lifts him up praise God
[1:22:33] he stumbled many a time he stumbled
[1:22:36] along life's journey and take Hagar
[1:22:38] he'd stumble and laugh at God God
[1:22:41] couldn't do that for me
[1:22:43] God never gave up on him God kept
[1:22:45] encouraging him and God would say I'm
[1:22:47] sending my strength receive my strength
[1:22:49] today another visitation I'm going to
[1:22:51] keep visiting you until you believe
[1:22:53] that's what God's gonna do for us he's
[1:22:56] going to keep visiting us so we believe
[1:22:58] praise God
[1:23:00] almost done that's my 15 minutes right
[1:23:02] there so let me finish
[1:23:03] I just want to get through these last
[1:23:04] few scriptures yeah these last I'll just
[1:23:06] this will be my last slide okay
[1:23:08] and then the Bible said Romans 4 20. he
[1:23:10] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:23:12] through unbelief now I just showed you
[1:23:13] all the Staggering
[1:23:15] but the Bible records as no staggering
[1:23:18] that's because God forgets all sins
[1:23:23] how can he stagger with Hagar how can he
[1:23:26] stagger with Egyptian king how can he
[1:23:28] stagger with abimelech and the Bible
[1:23:30] said he don't stagger because God
[1:23:32] forgives all sins
[1:23:34] the Bible said he washes them away with
[1:23:37] his blood
[1:23:38] the Bible said he separates them as far
[1:23:40] as the East is from the West
[1:23:42] the Bible says he throws our sins in the
[1:23:45] sea of forgetfulness
[1:23:48] and they speak all the way down to the
[1:23:49] bottom you never see him again
[1:23:52] God looks at Abraham's life and said he
[1:23:55] didn't stagger
[1:23:56] but he laughed we just right where he
[1:23:58] laughed but the Bible said that laughter
[1:24:00] wasn't a it wasn't a stumbling Stone
[1:24:03] your mistakes will not stop you from
[1:24:05] reaching your destination praise God
[1:24:08] your mistakes will not be a staggering
[1:24:11] point where okay I give up I'm going
[1:24:13] back to the world now your mistakes will
[1:24:14] never do that your state your mistakes
[1:24:16] will be learning examples amen your
[1:24:18] mistakes will be stepping stones praise
[1:24:20] God to higher faith more trust in God
[1:24:23] and strength to receive God's word
[1:24:25] hallelujah
[1:24:27] now look at this church I'm closing with
[1:24:28] this
[1:24:29] God this means god quickly forgave
[1:24:31] Abraham's unbelief
[1:24:34] even when he laughed at him Austin
[1:24:36] Abraham and Sarah both laughed and lied
[1:24:38] in the face of God
[1:24:40] Sarah lied in the face of God Abraham
[1:24:42] laughed in his face
[1:24:44] and yet God forgave them and said they
[1:24:45] never staggered
[1:24:47] they never fell short oh that's what I
[1:24:49] want God to say about me now okay
[1:24:52] he never staggered at the promise of God
[1:24:55] he kept believing for healing for
[1:24:57] miracles for the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:00] Ghost
[1:25:00] and he saw it sometimes amen hallelujah
[1:25:03] Revival Services amen or wherever or at
[1:25:06] the altar right here we saw it at the
[1:25:08] altar amen
[1:25:10] now look at this when he was 99 he
[1:25:12] didn't believe but at some point during
[1:25:14] this 99th year he received the faith to
[1:25:17] believe
[1:25:19] notice Genesis 18 12 God visits Abraham
[1:25:23] and Sarah and tells him again
[1:25:25] I'm going to read that
[1:25:29] in verse 10 God said I will certainly
[1:25:32] return to you according to the time of
[1:25:34] life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a
[1:25:36] son and the Bible never said Abraham
[1:25:39] left
[1:25:40] now what does this prove to you the more
[1:25:42] experiences you have with God the more
[1:25:44] you're going to believe in him
[1:25:47] the longer you serve God the more you're
[1:25:49] going to trust him
[1:25:51] you might have laughed and disbelieved
[1:25:53] last year but not this year
[1:25:55] because you're getting stronger and God
[1:25:58] is visiting you more you see more of
[1:26:00] God's love God's helping you to believe
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] Glory
[1:26:06] this time Abram Abraham left last
[1:26:09] chapter but this time sister who he's
[1:26:10] not laughing anymore he's saying amen
[1:26:13] glory to God Amen the Bible said he was
[1:26:17] strong in faith giving God the glory
[1:26:19] praise God
[1:26:21] oh at the beginning of the year he was
[1:26:23] laughing now here we're at the end of
[1:26:25] the year and he's saying glory to God
[1:26:27] it's going to happen praise God
[1:26:30] only Sarah laughed Abraham wasn't
[1:26:32] laughing anymore because God was helping
[1:26:34] him be stronger in his faith
[1:26:38] his visitations from God Abraham's
[1:26:41] experiences were persuading him and
[1:26:44] that's what we need to pray for more
[1:26:45] visitations from god let's stand to our
[1:26:47] feet we're going to pray for that today
[1:26:49] and also what else we're going to pray
[1:26:50] for
[1:26:52] amen we can do that Hallelujah the Bible
[1:26:54] says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
[1:26:56] amen that's exactly right
[1:26:58] that's exactly right wasn't there
[1:27:00] something I said we're going to pray for
