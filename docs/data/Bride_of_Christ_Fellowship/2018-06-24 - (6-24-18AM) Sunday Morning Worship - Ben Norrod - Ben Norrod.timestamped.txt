[23:22] let's take a few prayer requests and
[23:24] announcements this morning first of all
[23:26] again there's no air conditioner I
[23:28] announced it earlier the air
[23:29] conditioners broke so you just have to
[23:30] fan yourself or try to stay cool the
[23:33] best she can but the fan is on but
[23:35] there's no air conditioner it's broke
[23:36] today so also real quick I just moved
[23:42] all the seats up except that last row so
[23:44] you have a little more room to walk
[23:45] there by brother Adam and sister Bo you
[23:47] know if you need to get out you can go
[23:48] that way by God's grace I moved him up
[23:50] about six inches sometimes people had to
[23:52] go in around in front and that's my
[23:54] fault I should have moved the chairs up
[23:55] so sorry about that also after service
[23:58] you're welcome to take any 1965 message
[24:01] books but brother William gets first
[24:02] dibs cuz he acted he asked me to order
[24:04] some books oh he wants door on a door
[24:07] and some other ones I can't remember now
[24:08] ashamed I think so let brother William
[24:12] have those first then you can take any
[24:14] ones you want but I told him he could
[24:16] take all of him if he wants them because
[24:17] we have a lot of books out there if or
[24:19] if you need any books let me know happy
[24:20] to order a voice of God does a great job
[24:21] of getting those books out real promptly
[24:25] also my wife wasn't able to make it
[24:28] today
[24:29] they gave Genevieve some antibiotics and
[24:32] she has to get up at 3 a.m. every night
[24:33] to give her these antibiotics and she's
[24:35] giving her probiotics in between these
[24:38] these these I don't know portions or 100
[24:42] even calm treatments so she's up every
[24:44] six hours you know and so she wasn't
[24:46] able to make it today but she's hoping
[24:47] to be back with us perhaps Wednesday or
[24:50] next Sunday by the grace of the Lord and

[51:08] them people singing you know and then
[51:10] they wanted me to come up here in my
[51:12] little three chords and the cloud of
[51:13] dust in that country twice lord have
[51:16] mercy
[51:16] if I ever felt like brother Brenham are
[51:18] you a rider no sir I'm not a rider that
[51:20] was it I mean that was the spot Amen but
[51:23] we're returning there the Lord willing
[51:24] in July for those people to have a
[51:26] meeting and then while we're there we're
[51:28] going to Guyana but Jessie I'm over 40
[51:30] now don't let me forget to talk to you
[51:31] about Guyana I want some advice there
[51:33] and some counsel upon kindly how to
[51:36] approach the country but our first time
[51:38] in the country coming up we're looking
[51:40] forward to it I think the host pastor
[51:42] there in Trinidad is going to support us
[51:44] going over it's only about a 45-minute
[51:45] flight down and so we'll be there about
[51:48] four or five days I think myself and
[51:50] then back home into the u.s. Lord willin
[51:53] on top of those few meetings there then
[51:56] we have Mexico coming again maybe
[51:58] towards September October Mo's times
[52:01] been many years since I've been there
[52:02] last time I was there was Timmy Meyers I
[52:04] mean Tim was there 2006 and we've just
[52:07] done our best to turn the country upside
[52:09] down and there there's I found that just
[52:11] the other day matter of fact from that
[52:12] meeting out there I spoke to a brother
[52:15] on the phone he got saved in that
[52:16] meeting and he's a pastor now I got
[52:18] three four hundred people in his church
[52:19] he was telling me on the phone he said
[52:21] it was your meeting that you preached
[52:22] you remember that certain service I said
[52:24] I remember the but I don't remember you
[52:26] come and he said remember that group of
[52:28] young people I said I remember that he
[52:29] said I was one of them I thought well
[52:31] praise the Lord and that wonderful amen
[52:33] praise God and here he is a pastor and
[52:36] that wonderful amen so you never know
[52:38] what things are going to be accomplished
[52:40] in Trinidad this year in East or we had
[52:43] over a hundred young people the elder
[52:44] coming for salvation I preached on the
[52:46] baptism of the holy ghost and they came
[52:48] up tears for another I was crying and
[52:50] asking God for mercy you never know what
[52:52] happens in them countries like that so
[52:54] if you would pray for us as we go that
[52:57] the Lord would give us souls for the
[52:58] labor Amen so I like to mention those
[53:00] things to the body that Saints would be
[53:03] praying for us and I figured when the
[53:05] prayer lines were on and devils were in
[53:07] trouble they would call for help I
[53:09] figure well devils had enough sense to
[53:10] call for help social saints of God don't
[53:12] you think so amen and we want you to
[53:15] pray with us and join with us in prayer
[53:17] that the Lord just blessed us in these
[53:18] endeavors and
[53:19] so outside of that we got all these
[53:21] meetings in the States in different
[53:22] parts and more that we're traveling and
[53:26] those those miles aren't easy they
[53:28] accumulate on you and physically there
[53:30] they're a hard hard thing to try to do
[53:32] sometimes going from one meeting to
[53:34] another to another to another but
[53:36] somebody asked me the day before the ban
[53:38] have you done it 300 days on the year on
[53:42] the road and and 52 weekends for 15
[53:44] years and have you done that
[53:46] well they say you're young I said well
[53:48] but you don't feel young after about
[53:49] seven or eight weeks of that you know
[53:51] you start feeling like an old man I
[53:53] guess and some I said well I think I
[53:55] know what the answer is I said what's
[53:56] that
[53:57] he said because everywhere you go you
[53:58] ask people to pray for ya so that's it
[54:00] right there that's the thing as people
[54:02] praying so you pray for us and we love
[54:05] you very much and and again so happy to
[54:08] be back here in the little church again
[54:09] we are thrilled to be back with you oh
[54:11] and by the way for I forget Sam and I

[1:09:00] and I I kind of like getting happy fight
[1:09:03] it down into amen
[1:09:05] I just like it I'm convinced my friends
[1:09:09] that one reason people just don't shout
[1:09:10] and praise the Lord and worship anymore
[1:09:12] like they used to they just not saved
[1:09:14] hey man oh yeah get saved it puts a
[1:09:17] glory glory to God in the hollow in your
[1:09:19] mouth and your heart don't it
[1:09:20] Amen it sure does visions chapter 4
[1:09:23] verse 25 we're gonna get ready for some
[1:09:26] real work here this morning I'm getting
[1:09:27] the sleeves up amen visions for verse 25
[1:09:32] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[1:09:36] man truth with his neighbor for we are
[1:09:40] members one of another be angry and sin
[1:09:44] not let not the Sun go down upon your
[1:09:47] wrath neither give place to the devil
[1:09:50] let him that stole steal no more but
[1:09:54] rather let him labor working with his
[1:09:56] hands the thing which is good they may
[1:09:59] have to give to him that no corrupt
[1:10:03] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:10:05] but that which is good to the use of
[1:10:08] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[1:10:11] the ears grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:14] God
[1:10:16] by ye are sealed unto the day of your
[1:10:22] Redemption now this is amazing to me if
[1:10:25] you're reading these verses and you
[1:10:26] don't know a verse 30 exists what a rude
[1:10:30] awakening it is to hear all of these
[1:10:32] statements made by the Apostle Paul and
[1:10:35] then here turn around and say the people
[1:10:38] that are born-again Christians with the
[1:10:40] seal of God it's amazing actually
[1:10:42] because you would think well if you're a
[1:10:44] Christian if you're a child of God you
[1:10:47] never lie you never do anything wrong
[1:10:49] you never get angry you never do any of
[1:10:51] these type of things truth of the matter
[1:10:53] is friends it's Christians that will do
[1:10:55] the very things that Paul is talking
[1:10:57] about right here but we as the people of
[1:11:00] God we're supposed to have a power we're
[1:11:03] supposed to have something inside of us
[1:11:05] that brings us subject to god but it
[1:11:10] doesn't mean that we won't do some of
[1:11:12] these very things that he's talking
[1:11:13] about a man said to me one time said a
[1:11:15] man with the Holy Ghost cannot tell a
[1:11:17] lie
[1:11:17] I said you ought to be careful I said
[1:11:20] very the very man we call Elijah the
[1:11:22] Prophet in the last day got under
[1:11:24] pressure told a lie and had to go back
[1:11:25] and repent to the guy up there at the
[1:11:27] tax firm tell him I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:11:29] have done that
[1:11:30] I just under pressure and what more so
[1:11:32] it doesn't mean that if you've got to
[1:11:34] hold a ghost that you won't do things
[1:11:35] wrong the difference between somebody
[1:11:38] making a mistake and practicing sin
[1:11:40] there's a vast difference between the
[1:11:43] two
[1:11:43] we're not practicers of things but there
[1:11:46] are things that will come along so Paul
[1:11:48] is speaking to this group of believers
[1:11:50] now watch us grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:11:52] of God whereby you're sealed unto the
[1:11:54] day of redemption let all bitterness and
[1:11:58] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:12:02] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:12:06] malice talking to born-again Christians
[1:12:10] and be he kind one to another
[1:12:15] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:12:18] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:12:22] forgiven you let's pray over the word
[1:12:25] just a moment
[1:12:28] while your heads are bowed this morning
[1:12:29] if you'd like to be remembered in prayer
[1:12:31] just let it be known by the lifting of
[1:12:32] your hand today amen god bless you my
[1:12:34] hands up to Lord Jesus we thank you this
[1:12:38] morning for your mercy
[1:12:40] we're so thank you for your grace my
[1:12:42] Lord Jesus we are so privileged lamb of
[1:12:46] God to come into this place called the
[1:12:49] house of God Lord as I was thinking just
[1:12:52] this morning of that simple little
[1:12:54] example of the sanctuary moving over
[1:12:56] this side of the building and here we
[1:12:59] have no continuing City how things are
[1:13:01] always changing the one constant in this
[1:13:04] life that we have is that Lord you are
[1:13:06] still the same God today that you've
[1:13:09] ever been being eternal you never change
[1:13:11] you never have a new thought all your
[1:13:13] thoughts dwell with you just the same
[1:13:15] today as they was yesterday the same as
[1:13:17] they'll be tomorrow Lord as you spoke to
[1:13:20] me one time in praying I am the same
[1:13:22] today as I was even yesterday and
[1:13:24] tomorrow I will remain the same God that
[1:13:27] you know and love in this very same way
[1:13:30] God because you are eternal we know by
[1:13:34] the finite we know by the temporal way
[1:13:37] of life in this way of living God we
[1:13:40] realize that every day of our life
[1:13:42] there's things that change no matter our
[1:13:44] routines no matter our structures
[1:13:45] something new will take place every day
[1:13:48] Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we
[1:13:52] can wrap our hearts and our lives up in
[1:13:54] the great unchanging arms of the Living
[1:13:57] God you will protect us and shelter us
[1:14:00] from all harm and from evil in this last
[1:14:02] day now Lord as we look into the word I
[1:14:05] pray that the Holy Spirit will just come
[1:14:07] into this place this morning and take
[1:14:09] the little thing you placed in my life
[1:14:11] we call it a gift Lord let it be used to
[1:14:13] get me out of the way that I might be a
[1:14:15] microphone to speak to them those things
