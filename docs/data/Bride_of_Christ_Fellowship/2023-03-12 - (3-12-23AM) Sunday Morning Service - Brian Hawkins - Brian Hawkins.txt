Genesis 2 18. it says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help me for him and in verse 21 it says and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now a bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother as shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh you see the last time I was here uh I was going to speak on isolation and I guess brother Jesse preached at the the Wednesday before and I made a comment maybe I'll speak on that the next time I come out so uh I'd like to speak on isolation but not just isolation just a particular part of isolation I don't know exactly what brother Jesse had preached but uh what I'd what I'd like to really speak on is better is fellowship than solitude so we see in the opening scripture that that it's uh that it's not good that man should be alone right see we had the we know all the animals were in the garden and all the animals they were they were male and female the only one that didn't have a a companion or a partner was was the man correct so even the Lord said that man should not dwell alone but I'm going to make him a help meet I'm going to make him a partner I'm going to make him a companion so he needed some help he was all by himself but also the companionship is what he was missing in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 and verse 9. it says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken so we see that it's that it's important to not be by yourself but it's important to have somebody with you it's it's it's uh a statement that's popular that's probably reached probably all across the United States now but it's a very popular statement that many hands make light work so if if you if you're into a hard job if let's say we do wood so we we heat our house with wood so uh we'll cut wood we'll split wood we'll stack wood well to take on that responsibility by yourself as a as a daunting task so it's it's nice when you have help so it goes faster it goes easier and many hands make light work so it's it's good for a man not to to be alone because if something happened if you're if you're out in the woods if you're cutting wood something something like that cutting trees down if you're by yourself if you're by yourself and you get hurt there's nobody to call for help but if there's somebody with you there's somebody to give you Aid so that's that's kind of what that's talking about for if they fall uh one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for Heath not another to help him up now you could attribute that as well to uh the spiritual realm so it's good to have an accountability partner somebody that you trust in because when you get into these situations if you fall into a Temptation it's good to have somebody get in your face and say hey knock it off uh there was uh there was a brother years ago he was in he was in some trouble and uh he kept doing things that uh that kept getting him in in further trouble and there was a time that I had to I had to get in his face pretty much and and I don't like confrontation believe it or not I don't like confrontation but uh I had to tell him I said brother you gotta stop doing this I didn't say it in such a calm voice but uh but I was concerned about his well-being and you know when you see somebody keep doing something to get themselves into trouble and then they you try to help them out and they still get themselves in trouble that's a time where you feel like you just got to get him a whole uh by the shirt collar and say hey wake up you know stop doing what you're doing and get right you know if you if you stop doing things that are that are wrong like this you're not going to be in trouble so it's good to have the the accountability partner it's it's good to not be in solitude so that's what teamwork is you know I've heard the saying and we've all heard it there's no I in team but a popular thing now no but there's an me so there's a mean team yeah but you have to rearrange the letters to to to make that a me you know you have to you have to go out on a far stretch to call it me now see a team works together as one even though one has uh one might have uh one strength another one might take for instance where I work somebody might be good at electrical somebody might be good at welding somebody might be good in the plc's somebody might be good at dealing with the people so is anyone better than the other one no but when you come together it makes a great team and then you're and then you're successful then you're prosperous see it's when you come together as one not one having something in their mind well I'm going to be successful in this and I don't care what everybody else is doing now see what what good would that do in a church body what good would that do in a church body if if one person is successful see if one person is successful then everybody else is is Left Behind see that's where it works to to uh each person be in their place as a team and you mesh together as a team and then you you have further progress as one body I've kind of got a little ahead of myself but that's okay let's turn to uh Proverbs chapter 18. now see that there's we're talking about isolation so uh there's a way that uh you could have willful isolation and it's from others and isolating from the body so Proverbs 18 and verse 1 it says through desire a man having separated himself see it's a man's desire and that's where it comes into that that's where it comes into the fault it's through a man's desire that's where the fall comes because the desire is left to serve God so through desire a man having separated himself seeketh an inner medalist with all wisdom see through desire seeketh that that's seeking self-gratification see that's selfishness but see an intermedolith with wisdom it means to to rush on to Russia uh to be against all wisdom and what is valuable see interfering with others others uh other people's Affairs you know which starts a lot of fights see intermittent being a busybody you know you have somebody that that goes and Chit Chats with this one and gossips with this one it does this one here and it's just inserting an isolation from each other it's breaking up the team see that's what that's what this is talking about see self-gratification will eventually come against wisdom and viciously if you spend your time looking at what unbelievers think of this word you will more than likely Fall prey to their ungodly philosophical ways now see if in another translation of Proverbs 18 and 1 and it's in the Bible in basic English it says he who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense see it's self-serving now if we go to Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 24 it says and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works that's what we ought to be doing not not provoking one another to anger not reviling back when reviled but provoking one another unto love and to good works and not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as we see the day approaching so do we not see the day approaching of the Rapture time it's got to be coming soon I believe it you know just seeing everything that's happening in this day something's got to give sooner or later it's got to be coming soon but are we ready are we ready are we forsaking ourselves uh from this from the body of Christ are we drawing closer to one another saying hey we've got to get right we've got to stay right stay into the word stay into the prayer stay in the seeking lost souls amen Romans chapter 12. and verse 3 it says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members and one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another see one body many members see it's like what I was talking about it's a team right it's a family we work together as a family but we work as one like I said we we all have different functions see your foot your foot carries the body the hand will reach down and get some food to feed the body the elbow works at a different different function right so every part of our body works a different function they all aren't called to do the same thing if we are if it was all called to do the same thing we'd probably just be like this not doing anything you're not going anywhere you just be set there like a lump but every thank you brother but every person we have all these different callings we have the five-fold ministry right we have Apostles we have pastors we have teachers we have evangelists we have all these different things but they all work they they all do something different but they all work for the same purpose see all the all these members of one body it's it's one body this is my body these are my fingers they're not Lydia's fingers they're not Malachi's fingers these are my fingers this is one body that's a second body that's a third body so they're all different but we all work for the same purpose for the benefit of the body right we have to eat so then we have to work to get the food to eat see it works for a purpose now see that there was another way of of isolation and that was for to quarantine right I'm just going through different different types of isolation so to place into quarantine in Leviticus chapter 13 and 46 am I going too fast Leviticus 13 and 46 it says all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled he is unclean he shall dwell alone see being isolated without the camp showers habitation be see how many like how many like being isolated during during coven you know you couldn't go anywhere you couldn't do anything you couldn't go meet up with with people or at least you weren't supposed to there were some that didn't pay attention to it but oh but I I I wonder how many marriages were broken because they actually had to spend time together I wonder how many uh how many families were broken because I had to spend time together but on the other on the flip side of that how many marriages were brought together closer because they had to spend more time with each other how many families were brought together closer see it's all on what we value what we place our value on do we love our family or do we love our job or do we love God do we love what is our value or what do we place our value in but see isolate everybody I don't know brother Jesse has preached but uh isolate it means to to be alone or apart as in being inaccessible or unable to move about see that's talking about blocking off like a a a a crime scene or a fire a car accident that's that's blocking it making it unaccessible now see we as men and women we do the same thing we get a little hurt we get a little offended and then we draw off from other people and then you become unaccessible nobody could talk to you nobody can encourage you uh you become uh what's the word I'm looking for uh you get you become prickly you know uh because you've you've drawn withdrawn yourself from everything so it also means to like we just read to place a new quarantine that's also isolation uh to cause to become socially or politically unengaged or ostracized ostracizes anybody know what Austin does everybody know what ostracizer ostrich push us head in the ground anyway and he thinks he's isil he evidently he thinks that nobody could see him because he's got his head in the ground but never mind I'll skip that one to be free from external influence uh talking about government issue there uh communist a dictatorship things like that that uh I I think of uh the one Korea I want to say is South Korea to where they they kind of shut them off from the whole world they don't allow any they don't allow anything uh any news any uh outside internet they won't let them see anything because that's it's a whole control they're trying to isolate that one certain group and then they put forth their own propaganda to get them to believe what they want them to believe because they want to have the control over the people excuse me to identify or distinguish as a separate entity or group now we know with Abraham that the Lord told him look separate yourself you know from lot right so there was a separation there there was an isolation but that's another Avenue that we have to go is we have to isolate ourselves from Evil right so uh let us turn to first Thessalonians chapter five and and verse 18. it says in everything give thanks which we should do that as Believers we should give them thanks in everything for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things and hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil anything that looks like it's evil or anything that looks like you shouldn't be doing stay away from it brother Brandon said if there's any doubt don't do it stay away from it if it doesn't look like a Godly thing then abstain from it stay away from it isolate yourself from the thing we have to be separators from unbelief amen see uh doing what I do we isolate uh fluid power that could be air that could be water that could be oil that could be Hydraulics that could be different things anything that that pertains to fluid see what and and to be able to isolate uh certain things uh we isolate because we try to prevent uh harm personal injury or worldly influence we isolate these things for a purpose so we don't get into those things uh I'm just going to reference work because that's what I deal with so we shut off these a ball valve a gate valve or whatever power is driving that that particular piece of equipment you shut everything off that's called isolation and it's shutting the power off so it doesn't inadvertently uh become energized and squish you dismember you anything causing any kind of a harm to you these things must be done are you going to get hurt or killed see that's how important an isolation could be see we might set somebody aside uh in in isolation maybe they were uh in a prison uh they might have been bad in prison you ever hear a solitary solitary confinement see we put people or they put people in solitary confinement because they were uncontrollable they were doing something that they shouldn't have been doing so they're put in solitary confinement which is actually a punishment now some people might say oh man that would be good just to be away from everybody but after a while if you don't have contact with somebody you become stir crazy see 30 days in the hole might seem like a good idea but it's actually making them think kind of like how parents send you to your room all by yourself right to think about what you've done you know that's never happened to any children in here right but what do you do if you're in that if you're in that room by yourself and you can't have anything that you like you know things are taken away from you so you're thinking about what you did hmm if they if I did that and their course of action was that I don't think I want to do that again now some people now see that's a that's a type of a correction act action uh but some people just think of a clever more clever way to get away with something now see when we're free from the blood of Christ take Barabbas for instance if when he was released if he was and he was free because we know that him and Christ swapped roles right because Barabbas was set to die right he was in prison he was going to go under capital punishment but he was set free so being set free we know that he was a murderer and a thief he was just an evil man so being set free he might have said to himself wow I'm free I'm going to go kill again I'm going to go steal again I'll see there was nothing that changed I see same thing with the with our Christian wall we say we receive the Holy Spirit but then we go right back like a hog to a swallowing the dog to his vomit now see what took place did the Holy Spirit really come amen yeah but see that that's the isolation putting people in isolation as far as a prison because they they were not uh profitable for the community you know they they broke the law so now they're going in they're isolated from general population from the communities and into the prison right so that was to uh protect the people of the community now so kind of going back with the fluid power uh we have to do the same thing with electricity we work with 480 volts uh which is a lot of voltage you think your power outlet hurts when it shocks you if you get shocked with 480 you probably won't lift to tell how bad it hurt so you have to shut off that that as well and just kind of an experience that we had that we had a a gentleman there uh doing some things that he wasn't he shouldn't have been doing uh so he was he was we have these wire trays and they've got all kinds of electrical wires in it they uh it's you can run the trade so you don't really have to run conduit you don't have to put it through a pipe but through these wire trays he he was going through uh one particular wire tray and he didn't shut off the power he couldn't shut off the power because we're running and our process can't shut down we I work at the glass I work at a glass factory so our process can't shut down if we shut down that that means millions of dollars that we're we're losing so this this gentleman he decided to get he was mining is what he was doing is he was getting copper Wired from wires that were no longer used so he was going to take it in and scrap it while this is not a way for for a person to do it so he was reaching into the wire tray and he was using a grinder to cut through and uh very very very very bad idea to do uh he didn't get hurt but he ended up nicking one of the wires that were that was active and like I said that's 480 volts going through there but he is very fortunate that he is alive today he doesn't have a job there anymore but he's he's alive so because he was doing something that he he shouldn't have been doing so what happened was when you when you break that continuity you lose power so it's like somebody going through and just cutting the wire to the switch it's like turning the switch off because you have no more power so he almost shut us down so that that's how very important uh an isolation an important isolation can be because he could have got hurt and he almost shut us down which which would have been very very bad y'all ever hear of Alcatraz say Alcatraz is a is a prison that they that they had years ago but it was off of the Mainland it was just it's just an island right so it's just an island and that's all that was there was a prison that's all that was there so there's another there's another type of isolation now see and as we read in the scripture we know that John uh was sent to the he was isolated from people because they thought that he was preaching blasphemy but uh but we know that he was preaching truth so they put him on the island of Patmos right so it's the same kind of a deal uh I'll see when when uh when I'm talking about the the shutting off the the flow kind of getting back I know I'm jumping all over so my apologies but kind of getting back to that uh when you shut off the flow uh you're controlling that so you can control the flow of God or you can control the flow of Satan but we are the ones who do that we are the ones in control of that because we either disbelieve God and separate us ourselves from God or we fight against Satan which one are we shutting off which one are we allowing to have control over our lives see we control that flow it's not somebody else yeah everybody okay this morning so when we we want that flow of God we want that channel we want that continuity to be maintained right we want to keep that flow coming you know in the scripture talked about they addicted themselves so we must addict ourselves to God right so it doesn't mean that we uh like we're taught in in the scripture that we should get alone and and pray with God right so 40 days Moses and Jesus got got alone with God so there there's a type of isolation there which is a good type of isolation they weren't uh withdrawing themselves socially or from the rest of the brothers and sisters because they were mad or or they were upset or something happened but they were withdrawing themselves to get into the presence of God you know they weren't forsaking the assembly the assembling of one another but they were getting alone with God and in Matthew chapter 6 of verse 18 it is saying that that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret see we got we have to get away from people we have to get away from the things of the world we rub shoulders with the world every day if you go to work you're rubbing shoulders with the world every day you come home you know we need we need to get we need to have that little break but it's getting with the Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth uh which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but it's good to be alone with God so sometimes we need to get a loan uh we need to draw ourselves away from from other people because we just need that that time to reset we need we need that time to have a refocus if you get into that uh that position where you're where you're kind of getting into that oh I feel like I'm backsliding and you're saying well I don't want to go there I know that's wrong I don't want to go there so what's happening in my life what what is going on why do I keep doing this why why does this keep happening that's a time that you need to separate yourself take a step back and hit reset you know it's a time to to refocus and get back to the basics right I think brother Brandon taught at his uh ABC you know getting back to the ABCs always believe Christ but it's it's not appearing unto men to fast or to pray you know we're not out there broadening our phylacteries and and things like that and and making a show of our walk with Christ but it's going and and speaking to somebody about Christ testifying and you don't have to force your way through but you could just you it's it's uh they'll see it more in the life that you live because they're going to notice something a little bit different I know I'm not telling you something that you don't know but in Galatians chapter 1 I'm going to talk about Paul Galatians chapter 1 and verse 11. everybody okay this morning praise the Lord it says but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past with in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals and my known Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that I might preach him among the heathen I'll catch this part here he says immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood and neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days but other other of the Apostles saw a nun save James the Lord's brother now the things which I write unto you behold before God I lie not he's saying I'm telling you the truth but when I had heard this word when I heard this truth something struck something on the inside it struck something inside of there but I didn't confer with flesh and blood I didn't confer with man but I got alone with God and he was alone with God for three years and we have a hard time for three minutes and he was alone for three years he didn't he didn't talk to any of the Apostles he didn't talk to anybody uh Elsa was walking with with Christ while he was on on this Earth but he he learned of the holy spirit because he said it was of uh but by the revelation of Jesus Christ he got alone with God now see the Holy Ghost is our teacher now see uh brother Brandon told a story about a man that had a problem with smoking and he's saying well I gotta I gotta quit this before I can give my life to God he said not so you give your life to God the rest will take care of itself amen see we're so worried about getting people cleaned up before they come to church but you have to Come As You Are see when you come as you are that's what you really are and it's not a put on of something else and then you recognize that something is wrong it's not us that's saying that's telling somebody that uh that they're wrong but it's something on the inside that gets struck that that just convicts them so much that's what does the changing see we could try to encourage people to come to church and we should encourage people to come to church but it takes the Holy Spirit to get them to Christ and he also talked about the the Pentecostal days of how they be at the altar and people would be slapping people on the back that's not the way he gets saved it's not speaking in tongues it's not jumping up and down or shouting in the in the Holy Ghost amen that's not how you become saved but it's by the Holy Ghost that does the work on the inside that's what does the changing but see we want to hurry it along so much well I don't really like my brother so-and-so said well that's good we'll go meditate on what brothers so-and-so said go meditate upon those things and check it with the word to see if it's truth or not don't confer with other flesh yeah it's good to have Godly counsel but don't let that be your absolute your absolute is in Christ but he said then after three years I went into Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode within 15 days now see just keep it himself because he didn't want to hear how a man muddles things up because he was already a righteous man beforehand but he needed to know what was different about what he did and what Jesus followers did it's an individual Affair it's an individual relationship amen it's between you and God it's not between mother father grandmother grandfather is not between that Aunt Uncle I don't care what it is it's between you and God you have to settle it out now Jesus Jesus made the statement if you had known me you should have known my father also this shows an active relationship it's learning about somebody because there's there's something happening there's a relationship going on there's time being spent see Adam didn't have Eve right so who did he have to to commune with who did he have companionship with but when he had Eve he didn't know everything about Eve he had to get with Eve and learn Eve he had to learn about it see people want to rush into relationships I'm talking boyfriend girlfriend marriages but they don't take the time that they should one to pray about it that should be the first thing that we do the other thing is you you got to get to know the other person if you get in a relationship then you get into a marriage and you don't really know the person you just done you just made a mistake that's my encouragement is to get to know the other person before you before you get into that serious relationship but it's you need to know their ways you see we're told we're told not to be unequally yoked right so we must be yoked with Believers so you might want to see how they believe with one uh as far as under the scripture comparing with what you believe because if it's something that's completely opposite you're going to have a hard relationship see not just an acquaintance saying hello when you pass by or giving a greeting in in their presence see when you know the word you could typically see its signs right for we know that the signs will follow the believer kind of moving on to something else where brother Branham said that this message will not denominate right he didn't say that the organization called the message would not uh would not denominate because people carry ideas of their own into what we call the message right so if it doesn't fit God's program they try to make it fit and then what happens they that it becomes so much of their pet doctrine that they leave everything else out they leave God out of it he's knocking on the door but you won't let him in because you've got a preconceived idea you've got a preconceived notion that what you believe is right but the truth is trying to come in and you won't let it see you're isolating yourself from the Holy Spirit now we know what denominates dies right now see the message is Jesus Christ and Christ cannot die right so I think that's what brother Brandon was talking about when he said this message will not denominate Christ will not denominate because what denominates dies so just because you attend a message church that does not mean that you're saved amen not by any means but don't cleave to that notion that just because you said it in a message pew that you're going on to the rapture it doesn't matter what the the type of church that you go to the church that you go to now forgive me for for saying please understand what I'm saying it doesn't matter what church you go to as far as you say that you're saved because I go to so-and-so's church that's not that's not true it's if you are in Christ that's where it is I can't emphasize that enough you know the the the the eagle the eagle will only eat fresh meat right fresh man it won't eat something that's that's uh long dead I've heard people say you know uh I was told that eagles only ate fresh meat I've seen I've seen them eat roadkill okay but you won't see him eat roadkill that's a week old you won't see that one or two days that that's still fresh meat but see we get into our in our little spots of who are is we're not saved by our pastor we're not saved by our favorite evangelist we're not even saved because of the Prophet right see the bride will heed her husband the bride will only look to her husband and no one else oh he says this he says Israel coming out of Egypt then was a type this is the anti-type of the church coming out of the denominations now not all denominate pay attention here he says I mean the bride see some people there are some of the independence just as bad as the denominationals sometimes worse than oh my here he was he was coming out against the denominations well what about those that are independent he says some of them are even worse than than the denominations see he's talking about and he says I'm talking about the applied token this is where it's got to be this is where it really comes down to he says I'm talking about the applied token he's not talking about uh some church down the road in an independent church he's not talking about a church a denominational Church down the other direction he's not talking about that but he's saying I'm talking about the applied token the token agrees with every word the token do you have that token today see the token agrees with every word see it's got to because it is the word it's the life that was in the word my words are Spirit they are life said Jesus now see this is a time where the world is uniting together to come against the message right see just as the Jews United to come against and rejected Jesus the messenger of the hour so are those that have left the message ranks see it's not a it's not new news to to know uh that those are created believe the sign they've come against this message so hard of something that they used to testify of but see when people leave an organization with animosity in their heart they fight hard against it and then they try to discredit just like Proverbs 18 1. it's self-serving they try to discredit truth that they can't see see they destroyed the word of God by making it of none effect they try to get people to believe their claims that that much of the prophecies that were prophesied are absolutely wrong and never did come to pass they are coming against us so hard they say that none of the prophecies that brother Brandon prophesied came true see the internet is is full of these things against uh negativity against brother Branham but it's because they misinterpret they misunderstand what they what was being said see they have uh uh let's see several of the people are are former preachers a lot of the people that come against the message are former preachers see it's the same thing as in the day of the Pharisees and the Sadducees they have eyes to see and they have ears to hear but they can't see and they can't hear truth right but they are deaf and they were blind and they don't know it it's that same spirit I see there was we learned of the Jubilee I think it was back in Leviticus or I can't remember if it talks about it in Exodus I think it does in Exodus as well but a couple places in the Old Testament it talks about the Jubilee how uh in six years uh the people will serve but in that seventh year they have the option to go to go free and the one that bought them has to let them go but if they decide to stay then the master marched them in the ear the same thing is happening in this day these people want to continue to serve the Devils well God is marking them in their ears to where they can't hear the word of God anymore amen see they've isolated themselves from the Holy Spirit they've isolated themselves from the word of God so they could no longer hear the truth see God is uniting his bride with his word see heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away why for the Rapture amen see it's a Rapture time we've got to get ready for that Rapture she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord no matter what anybody has to say about it she's getting ready to you to unite with her bridegroom see the Saints of old those that are asleep and those that are alive and remain will unite to become one with who the bride room see communism has to rise romanism has to rise the Council of churches has to rise the New World Order has to rise tensions will have to rise persecutions will rise so too the bread of Christ has to rise up and unite under the word of God bringing back the faith that was once delivered up to the Saints amen praise the Lord see all these other other things are coming up they're all rising up it's a slow process but they're coming they're here so too must we rise up to a different standard not well not I can't say it that way not to a different standard but to a higher standard it's maintaining the same standard of old but coming a little bit higher amen not being satisfied see we're all members of one body but we all must be able to move perform our function not be separate from one another but come together as a team come together as that one body of Christ he says oh brother when you isolate yourself from the rest of the Believers God will move away you've got to love one another this will all men know that you were my disciples when you have love one for the other one when the Methodist and the Baptist and the Lutheran and the Pentecostal can stand arm and arm and March forward you'll see one of the mightiest outpourings of the spirit of God that you have ever seen he says oh my god listen close he says the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another he says oh go ahead you just fight you just kill yourselves but let us let us unite in one big front and watch what happens then see as long as we're bickering and fighting and just coming Against One Another We're isolating ourselves from one another and then it begins to become one big fight and then what happens the enemy comes in like a flood and then we wonder why we can't get anywhere because we've turned against another brother or a sister or another group whatever it might be but he says the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another see if we could just set our differences aside think of what we could accomplish but no we could offend it and have to isolate ourselves from one another well fine if that's the way they want it I just won't talk to them it says I'll just ignore them I'll only answer if I have to so you ever been in a relationship and then somebody upset you and then they call that the silent treatment well I'm just not going to talk to that I'm just not going to talk to my wife her husband boyfriend girlfriend whatever it might be my best friend they've offended me so I'm I'm not going to talk to them that's how people get that's all churches get they said something that I didn't like well I'm not going to go there well I might show up there I'm just not going to talk to anybody see how these things come in but you better watch out because that that Devil's just looking for that little tiny window to get in see fighting disputing in its cause and division all the while the enemy sits back and watches the people tear themselves apart making his job that much easier I've gotta I won't be much longer just bear with me for a few more minutes see the Jews we're in a civil war at the time when the second temple was was burned down I encourage you to go back and and study what happened at this time so uh this was back around 70 A.D you know a few years before a few years after uh the enemy had then surrounded and moved in with their tactics I can't remember the article that I had I had looked at I looked at a lot so I don't have a reference to to give you so my apologies I forgot to write it down apparently I'd like to give credit where I get where I get information but the enemy uh had them surrounded and moved in with their tactics see one of the tactics tactics was the use use of the Jews fighting amongst themselves see Titus was asked if he was going to move in he replied with a no for the people were taking themselves out for him and and it made his job that much easier see they made it easy for him because of all the backbiting and the fighting see the Jewish Revolt of 66 to 74 A.D it says the fall of Galilee to vespasians or Titus to titus's legionnaires prompted more internal strife among the Jewish fractions see because because of who Titus was and hearing things and what he did it caused the Jews to fight amongst themselves but let us not be like that we see the end don't be like that you're one body here you're a church group here stay together love one another if something hurts if somebody's offended then come according to Matthew 18 if if a brother offends you go to him and go to him alone or sister if there's a sister that offends you go to her and go to her alone see do it according to the scripture it's it should be we should be able to talk to one another hey I didn't like how you said such and such hey I didn't like this it could be me I'm sorry I'm having a bad day but I just didn't like this well I didn't mean it that way oh you meant it this way I completely took you the wrong way see misunderstanding is is the biggest culprit of many fights because we think we know what the other person was was saying but we jump to conclusions a lot of times you know a lot most times the conversation we we listen more for to uh respond to somebody than actually listening to what the other person has to say we're so caught up in in our response and and trying to think of something to say in return instead of just listening you know some people just need somebody to listen to anyhow but as the campaigning season of 68 A.D began Vespasian was in no hurry to intervene stating that since our enemies are Busy Dying by their own hands the best course of action would be to stay as Spectators instead of taking on Fanatics who welcome death and are already busy murdering each other see they isolated themselves from each other they were divided foreign old saying divided or uh United We Stand but divided we fall so that's that's exactly what was happening here they were divided so therefore they fell but don't be divided amongst one another be United with each other amen see if they would have United they would have been a more formal formidable army under pressure and under Roman Siege they finally United to attack the Romans but at that time by the time they finally United it was much too late all of this all of that destruction came because they rejected Jesus as the Messiah they rejected the word that they claimed to be followers of now he's talking about the Jews because they rejected Christ at the time you know 33 A.D which I think that was a time that that Christ was crucified and they rejected and all that stuff took place but because of that that's how they that's how they uh came to the fall is because they rejected Christ amen I see there again there's a there's a difference between isolating from from evil for we were taught in in the scripture Galatians 1 to abstain from all evil that we should isolate from those things we should uh just be separate from from all unbelief or any the the very appearance of evil if it looks evil stay away from it amen so but there's a difference between that and isolating yourselves to get in the presence of God now say we don't want to forsake the assembling of ourselves together but we want to draw that much closer as we see the day approaching amen uh I'm just going to close with this with this quote here it's going to be a couple minutes so that it's it's fairly lengthy lengthy so bear with me for a minute he says but to you it isn't nonsense to you you're United with the word and here it is then it's absolutely light when you see the this sign Unite with the believer and that's who I'm addressing this to is the believer for the unbeliever never sees it and what a rebuke it would be if he was on Earth today to many of our clergy today who cannot read this this sign the signs that we're reading uh daily here at the Tabernacle and seeing things excuse me and others are reading it and seeing the handwriting on the wall sorry excuse me and yet many just ignore it and don't even see it at all see it's nothing to them at all they don't notice it now notice that in this that he pointed out National signs now when they asked him about this they wanted signs and he gave them signs that happened and they wanted to know when would the end of the world be what would what would be the sign at the end and he pointed them many places through the scripture about National signs about Heavenly sign in the heavens and Earthly signs he gave them signs signs signs and Justice constantly a sign and he told them there in one place about a national sign he said when you see the Nations see begin to gather around Jerusalem see then we know that the time of their trouble was at hand when you see Jerusalem compassed about with army see now before that they could do this excuse me before that they could do this the world had to unite Titus this great Roman general had to unite his armies together and come around after these Jews had rejected the god-given sign of the time to them that's the time that Titus United his armies together and come to take the city first there had to be a uniting of God's people so-called against the word of God before that the nation can unite itself against God's people see the unity the uniting uniting together I believe that's where we're we're living in a great uniting time I am taking these these red lights down he's talking about all these things happening in in his day he's taking note of all these the the red lights uh he says I am taking these these red lights down and Flash signals and everything of the women of how they do and the men of how they do and the churches of how they do showing to this little group with all my heart that I believe that we are lining in the line of God's word in this great prophetic hour just before the coming of the Lord Jesus uniting together and getting ready now you see before Titus United his armies together Israel United themselves together and abandoned themselves that they would not believe Jesus to be the Messiah they rejected him and turned him out and crucified him and then when they rejected the Salvation that was sent to them they United themselves together to do it now hold that in mind uniting themselves together to reject the message of the hour they had to do that and then when they did that then the national sign come in the Nations begin to unite themselves together and Titus brought this great Army of Romans and Greeks and compassed the walls of Jerusalem penned those people in there now and they starved to death they eat the bark from the trees Josephus the great historian tells us and they eat the grass off the ground see when you get in desperation you know and you reject the word you'll just eat anything you'll eat anything because you're starving to death see they even they even boiled one another's children and eat it that's disgusting but they were desperate see as they were mad people and then when finally Titus he was setting back upon the hills and around Jerusalem there and those people in there thought they were they were doing the will of God when they saw these armies Marching In they had refused to hear that great Master Lord Jesus to tell them that there wasn't one of them Christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved did you catch that there wasn't one Christian in there he said there wasn't one of them Christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved see they said let them that's on the housetop come not down or him that's in the field go back take not his coat but flee into Judea and pray that your flight be not in the winter time or on the Sabbath because in the winter time the hills would be full of snow and on the Sabbath day the doors were closed the gate and they'd be cut in that condition says notice now they prayed that it would not be that way Jesus told them to pray for that and they never caught one of them in there they were going they were gone because they looked at the sign and they were gone that's all there was to it says oh and how the the churches today ought to see the sign of the time that we're living in fleeing as hard as you can to Calvary for life not to some church but to Jesus Christ wait to some church or not to some church but to Jesus Christ so we know that Christ is the important thing I know I'm not telling you something that you that you don't know I know you know that already but just to stress that he says unite yourself with him and not with some organization or some church Creed I see the the press play Church the the tape Church they're an organization kind of Unto themselves and their Creed is push play that's that's what their Creed is but he's saying don't uh Unite unite yourself with him and not with some organization or some church Creed but Unite with Christ and be sure that it's him you can't just take anything you got to you got to be positive that it's him what a time of Union now see no we find out that they rejected the Messiah and then United themselves together and made themselves a league and made emotion among them that of any any persons received Jesus as a prophet that they would be excommunicated from the church so you remember the blind boy that was set with blinded eyes and the disciples said who sinned him or his father or his mother he says now excuse me we see this uniting time coming see now watch and then the church has United itself against the message and then when it does that the nations are uniting themselves in communism to destroy the church again just exactly what it did in the first place see it repeats itself right back again now see we're seeing this this uh we're seeing that in this day that they're coming against the church right they're trying to shut the church out they're trying to to shut the church off from from being what the church is they're saying the church needs to accept everybody else we need to be that we need to tolerate you need to be more tolerant but on the other hand they're not tolerant of the church they won't let the church be to themselves now see they want everybody to to be yourself Let Yourself Go but they don't let others be themselves now see that's kind of hypocritical now see we see uh we see these these things happen in this day you know why don't they why are they coming against Christians so much in this day why aren't they fighting against the Muslims why don't you see things happening uh nobody's coming against the Muslims that I see I guess nobody dares to come against the Muslims because they won't put up with it but see and I'm going to go out so far to say the persecution has to come against the true church the true church God's people God's true people so why don't we see more of that happening in this day why why isn't the the the the society coming against more uh against the uh the Muslims how come they're not coming against uh those up practice witchcraft they're condoning the Witchcraft which years ago they used to burn people that they thought were witches at the stake but now they're harboring it they're actually wanting to distribute take Harry Potter for instance boy he got that got so popular it's even in Christian people that claim to be Christians it's even in their homes that's hogwash they talk about Hogwarts I'm talking about hogwash that shouldn't be in a Christian's home amen but they're trying to destroy the church now they're trying to shut the doors they tried to do it during coven they tried to shut the doors but we know that that is going to come we know that one day it's going to be coming excuse me continuing on he says Israel had to turn down the message first and when they turned down the message then the military the National Life United itself together of other nations and come in and destroyed the church and today they have turned down the message of the Lord Jesus and they've turned it down and now the time has come to where communism is uniting the world together against the church see it has to be that way now it's hard to say that but see like we see all these things happening and it's under the cloak of socialism now see socialism eventually I think will turn into the communism so it's going to start off in one way and it's cloaked they want one thing for all such silliness you know as history repeats itself if you know the history but if they take that out of the history books and they don't teach the history then they're doomed to repeat the same thing because there was no government under socialism that has ever stood for a long period of time they've all Fallen uh it says it was hard for them them Jews to believe they said now come brethren we see that our God is with us and so we'll go into the temple and now we will pray and let the Holy Father so and so and Holy Father so and so lead in prayer close the gate and Titus took his stand and stood right there for about a year or more see right on guard and starve them right out there couldn't be a one of them even get outside the city and they died starved and when he went in there and tore the walls down the blood gussed out and run like Rivers down there where he slaughtered everything that was in there now the angel of the Lord prophesied that back in the Old Testament and told that what told that that would happen and then ministers who was clergy was supposed to be posted on that and to tell the people that instead of that when Jesus stood among them they didn't even know him and try to make some kind of a rabbit foot do us a trick let us see how it's done show us a sign see and he said I'd uh well he's done so many things and yet they couldn't see it and then when they rejected him as their Messiah the message of that day they rejected the message of that day I know that was lengthy but uh I'll go ahead and close if you'd stand to your feet see he was talking about of how the Jews about that article that I was referring to about the Jews they rejected the Messiah so then it was prophesied that all nations would surround them uh with the with the Army and because they they were coming against one another they were back fighting they were they were fighting and just from Winston Wars and Stripes come among you is it not because people reject Christ and they were warring with uh amongst each other instead of being united together they were warring against each other and that's what made it so easy for Titus to to take them out he was a patient uh he was a patient man and he just waited and just surrounded them nobody could leave and if they did they would die when they stayed they died because they were not United so better is fellowship than solitude amen second Corinthians I'll close with this scripture here second Corinthians chapter six and verse 14. it says be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement at the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you it will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty let's look to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord many things have been spoken today Lord I just pray that you just take this jumbled up message just seemed to jump around here and there Lord I just

just doesn't feel the same but we're all together when we're in one mind one Accord and then we were in unity with the Holy Spirit Lord who knows what could happen in that kind of a service of God so father I just pray that you would be with this group of people Lord hear present or those that are streaming Lord I just pray that they would just set aside differences whatever might be happening or
