[43:51] Sunday all the giving statements you can

[44:05] anyways we'll pass those out on Sunday
[44:06] by the grace of the Lord okay let's look
[44:09] at the final thoughts here on the open
[44:11] door and we'll you know one of the
[44:14] brothers on Sunday night after I
[44:15] preached Sunday morning I just preached
[44:17] Sunday morning on Sunday night one of
[44:18] the brothers I preached the first part
[44:20] another brother and three brothers
[44:21] preached on Sunday night from 7:30 to
[44:23] midnight and the second brother preached
[44:25] on the open door afterwards I thought
[44:26] well that's just fitting that's just
[44:29] fitting because that's what we're
[44:29] looking at at home by God's grace I want
[44:32] to just go through this here I want to
[44:33] try to make this as fresh as possible
[44:37] Jesus said I've set before thee an open
[44:39] door brother Branham said I want to look
[44:41] at these words again this time I'm not
[44:44] going to disassociate them from missions
[44:46] I'm gonna bring you a thought which
[44:49] carries deep into the last age and this
[44:52] is the thought of the Godhead as Jesus
[44:55] Christ being God this is the thought
[44:58] he's gonna get into just so to prepare
[44:59] you for tonight it's on the Godhead he
[45:02] kind of ends his teaching about the open
[45:04] door with the Godhead as I've already
[45:07] stated this age melts into the last age
[45:09] it was this age Jesus said I come
[45:12] quickly and the last age he was going to
[45:15] finish the work and cut it short in
[45:17] righteousness
[45:19] because a short work will the Lord make
[45:22] upon the earth in that striking God this
[45:25] is in Romans 9 this struck me I had to
[45:27] look that up I was like is that in the
[45:29] scripture it seemed like I'd forgotten
[45:31] that Scripture but it's a right in
[45:33] Romans 9 the Bible said God is gonna cut
[45:36] their work short and it's gonna be a
[45:37] short work upon the earth we feel like
[45:40] it's just been taken so long for Jesus
[45:41] to come back but Jesus said the Bible
[45:45] said one day with man one day with God's
[45:47] like a thousand days of man
[45:48] so Jesus we know is that about there's
[45:50] about six thousand years of human
[45:52] history now we know brother Bama there
[45:54] might have been millions and billions of
[45:55] years before humans were placed upon the
[45:58] earth we know we don't know but as far
[46:00] as human history it's only been six days
[46:02] with the Lord and so he says I'm gonna
[46:04] cut it short it's gonna be a short work
[46:06] upon the earth don't you look forward to
[46:08] one day church where this earth will be
[46:10] burned over only righteousness will
[46:12] dwell here it'll seem like these days
[46:14] we're just a fond memory yours was fine
[46:17] as far as salvation but sin there'll be
[46:19] nothing find about sin but we'll be able
[46:21] to remember all oh my we were saved by
[46:24] grace we'll be singing about the blood
[46:26] all throughout eternity amen
[46:28] the blood of Jesus but it's a short work
[46:30] this is really a short age it's just
[46:33] even a even our short age of labor to
[46:35] see it was also a short span of time
[46:36] just six thousand years very small in
[46:39] there in the scope of eternity and I
[46:42] says notice how this verse of Revelation
[46:44] 3a goes open door little strength word
[46:47] name that open door has to do with all
[46:50] three now what does the door signify now
[46:54] I'm gonna just a break that I'm just
[46:55] breaking this down a little bit okay so
[46:57] brother Branham said the open door deals
[46:59] with your a little bit of strength so
[47:02] the open door gives you a little
[47:03] strength the open door gives you the
[47:05] word because you don't deny his word and
[47:07] then the open door helps you not deny
[47:10] his name so see the strength word a name
[47:14] all go together amen that's what the
[47:16] prophets trying to say here so he says
[47:18] first what is the open door signify
[47:20] again you're familiar with this but he
[47:21] goes over it again so I thought well I
[47:23] better go over it again too
[47:24] by the grace of the Lord john 10:7 says
[47:28] then said jesus unto them verily verily
[47:30] I say unto you I am
[47:33] the door of the Sheep that is right I am
[47:36] is the door of the Sheep
[47:38] now that is not just a quaint expression
[47:41] that's exactly so reg actually so notice
[47:44] in John 10 when Jesus giving this
[47:46] parable he calls himself the Shepherd
[47:48] then he calls himself the door and that
[47:53] is what the Shepherd is to the Sheep he
[47:56] is actually their door so program now
[48:00] tells the story about when he went out
[48:01] east he was over in the east and he saw
[48:03] at nighttime the Shepherd would gather
[48:04] all sheep together he would put them in
[48:06] the phone then he would count them he
[48:10] was sure that they were all in he would
[48:11] lie down in the open door of the fold
[48:13] and literally become the door to the
[48:14] fold no one could get out or in or out
[48:18] except by him he was the door he got
[48:20] that picture in your mind he would
[48:22] gather all the sheep in and count each
[48:24] one and then he would lay down and
[48:26] become the door that is that how I feel
[48:28] as a pastor I look out on Wednesday
[48:30] night who's here we're missing so and so
[48:32] because I love them Sunday morning who's
[48:35] not here oh my it spent two Sundays in a
[48:37] row they're not here what do you start
[48:39] feeling you start feeling a burden for
[48:40] the souls if you lost your pet how would
[48:44] you feel
[48:44] I don't really we don't know I guess we
[48:46] have a few pets but they're not really
[48:47] dear to me but if you had pets that were
[48:50] dear to you and you lost them or didn't
[48:53] know where they were you'd be really
[48:55] concerned right and so that's how the
[48:58] Shepherd is the shepherd is concerned he
[49:01] wants to make sure every single sheep is
[49:02] okay amen because he is the door the
[49:08] next day as
[49:09] he said now he tells the second part
[49:11] about shepherds this is the first story
[49:12] about shepherds now he gives the second
[49:14] part I like this one too
[49:15] the next day we went riding with a
[49:17] friend in the Jeep I noticed the
[49:18] Shepherd began to lead his flock into
[49:19] the city ride away all the traffic came
[49:22] to stop so the Sheep could go through
[49:24] now the city's over in the east aren't
[49:26] like they are here we keep our
[49:28] merchandise inside but there's like a
[49:29] big farmers market with all the produce
[49:31] on the pavement for pasture buyers buy
[49:33] to see and buy and I thought oh my here
[49:37] is where the riot begins so brother
[49:38] Brahim thought these sheep would just
[49:39] jump on the tables you know and start
[49:42] feasting on all this outdoor food way to
[49:46] those sheep see all that food out there
[49:48] but I thought it riots gonna happen he
[49:51] says but as the Shepherd went ahead
[49:53] though sheep just followed right along
[49:55] exactly in each step they would look at
[49:57] all those goodies but not a sheep
[49:59] touched a thing oh if I could only have
[50:03] known their language I would have
[50:04] stopped traffic myself and preached them
[50:07] a sermon on what I had just seen and
[50:09] here's what the sermon would have been
[50:11] when your sheep that belonged to the
[50:13] great Shepherd you follow right along
[50:15] with each of his steps just as those
[50:19] sheep did you won't be tempted to turn
[50:22] aside for some big flower of a church or
[50:26] listen to the voice of some DD or PhD or
[50:29] lld but you will stay with the Shepherd
[50:33] the Bible says the sheep know his voice
[50:35] and they follow him but a stranger's
[50:38] voice will only cause him to flee and
[50:41] run after their true Shepherd but RAM
[50:44] said praise God so look at Russia p--
[50:48] runs after Christ the word the true
[50:51] Shepherd how many understand that Satan
[50:55] tries to tempt people away from true
[50:56] preaching by offering them a nicer
[50:59] looking Church how many know that that's
[51:01] a brother I'm saying here huh me know
[51:03] Satan tries to to draw real sheep of God
[51:06] away from real preaching by using up
[51:10] more educated preacher or a preacher
[51:12] who's got a doctor's degree that's what
[51:15] the prophets saying here there it's like
[51:17] the food on the table they passed by and
[51:19] they're tempted to jump on those goodies
[51:21] but a real truce
[51:23] people be able to overcome that
[51:24] temptation and follow right in line with
[51:27] the steps of the Shepherd amen and I
[51:30] love that a strangers voice will only
[51:34] cause them to run after the true
[51:36] Shepherd amen
[51:38] I like that because you know a real true
[51:40] child of God whenever there's a
[51:42] temptation and they're struggling
[51:44] eventually they'll get victor over that
[51:46] and they'll run themselves right back to
[51:47] where God wants them to be amen
[51:50] they're not going to run away from the
[51:51] voice of God the voice of the shepherd
[51:53] they're gonna run to the voice of the
[51:55] shepherd and when you have trouble what
[51:57] should you do you should run to prayer
[51:59] praise God when you're sick or tired or
[52:02] don't feel like I'm gonna church you
[52:04] should run to church because that's what
[52:06] the sheep of God do they follow in the
[52:08] footsteps of the Shepherd it's exactly
[52:12] right something felt like I was gonna
[52:14] stay on the previous slide but then I
[52:18] wish I thought I would have said there
[52:22] huh I think I'll get to it eventually
[52:26] I'll just trust the Holy Spirit will
[52:27] bring it out by the grace of the Lord
[52:33] all right now look at the scripture here
[52:37] here's the scripture I wanted to get to
[52:39] but as that was because the Bible said
[52:41] as the beloved of God we must flee from
[52:45] idolatry
[52:46] so anything that becomes more important
[52:49] than the preaching anything that becomes
[52:51] more important than prayer anything that
[52:53] tries to exalt itself above the Word of
[52:55] God is an idol most of time invested
[52:58] churches the the biggest idols are
[53:00] things that come up in people's homes
[53:05] temptations like you know TV you know
[53:08] apps internet you know sports whatever
[53:13] children's needs well you know
[53:15] children's ball games or whatever movies
[53:17] you name it usually from what I've seen
[53:21] and what I preach you know over in Iowa
[53:23] now in North Carolina usually what I've
[53:26] seen is that the idolatry starts in the
[53:28] home the parents start putting idols
[53:33] above the Word of God and then when they
[53:35] compromise then they let
[53:37] children compromised because it's a
[53:39] compromising spirit that spirits on the
[53:43] parents that when when the parents
[53:45] compromise that spirit just hops off
[53:47] onto the children right and church you
[53:51] should have saw on Sunday morning the
[53:53] pastor the children my children saw the
[53:56] pastor I preached everything I preached
[53:58] here about Netflix pornography I just
[54:01] preached the same things that I preach
[54:03] here I put the same sermon from the red
[54:06] heifer to the holiest of Holies I
[54:07] preached that they're the same thing I
[54:09] preached in Iowa and brother Tim we had
[54:12] a prayer line going and he stopped the
[54:13] service he's a brother Jesse I feel led
[54:14] to change the direction of the service
[54:17] so he told the people pray and he said
[54:19] just come up to the altar he said I'm
[54:20] calling the whole church up for prayer
[54:22] the whole entire church came up and we
[54:25] prayed maybe for 20 minutes and people
[54:27] were screaming and yelling out loud and
[54:29] he was cursing all these demons in
[54:32] people's homes the movies and the sexy
[54:34] clothes and and the pornography he just
[54:37] went on and cursing all these demons
[54:39] that people are screaming and crying and
[54:41] shouting and it was powerful so what
[54:44] I've come to know is that idolatry is
[54:48] compromised message people are
[54:51] compromising and letting idols start in
[54:54] the home it won't be in the church you
[54:56] and I are not gonna sit and worship this
[54:58] picture you and I are not gonna where's
[55:01] brother bands books I don't have any
[55:03] here you and I are not going to bow down
[55:04] to brother branham's books that's not
[55:06] the idolatry that's gonna catch someone
[55:09] who's sincere it's going to be more
[55:11] deceptive than that and it's going to be
[55:14] idolatry in their home and we're how
[55:17] does that usually happen any time you
[55:19] see the word is not the most important
[55:21] thing and idols come in and that's why
[55:24] I've got a labor on church attendance
[55:25] and preaching of the word heat you know
[55:28] live streaming hearing the word trying
[55:30] to catch the vision of our church if
[55:33] everybody could catch that
[55:34] oh my we'd be doing more for the kingdom
[55:36] of God we'd see more miracles we'd see
[55:38] more soul saved if we can all just catch
[55:40] the vision of God but we got to catch it
[55:43] we got a we got to catch it but what is
[55:45] its idolatry and just like brother BAM
[55:48] said the sheep when they had all these
[55:50] goodies
[55:50] around them and look Church you've got
[55:52] goodies all over your phone if you want
[55:54] to write you could try to make more
[55:57] money on your phone they're good there's
[55:58] temptations that do it more business and
[56:01] try to make just got to compromise on
[56:03] the word a little bit just got a just
[56:05] got a sale you know just got to start
[56:07] selling makeup or you know just any
[56:09] compromise I just got a I just you know
[56:12] we got to give up Wednesday night
[56:13] service and you got to try to make some
[56:15] more money you know and there's all
[56:17] kinds of there's all kinds of goodies
[56:18] out there but the real sheep of God stay
[56:21] focused on the shepherd and just like
[56:25] the sheep run away from the goodies the
[56:28] Christian runs away from sin they flee
[56:32] from any temptation that's idolatry
[56:36] that's exactly right so the scripture
[56:39] says there wherefore let him that
[56:40] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[56:42] fall how many feel like you're standing
[56:43] for Jesus pretty strong right now this
[56:46] is one of the most I've ever felt
[56:47] strongest right now is right now because
[56:50] of what I saw North Carolina I just
[56:52] stand amazed that what God the brother
[56:54] said the pastor said this was one of the
[56:57] best services in their thirty years of
[56:58] having a church 30 years and hear him
[57:02] I'm like well I'm nothing like you know
[57:05] me I'm nothing I'm just I'm just brother
[57:07] yes and for God to come down and the
[57:10] pastor's wife said that was God from
[57:12] beginning to end
[57:13] God spoke every you know every word was
[57:16] God and the pastor's on his knees I mean
[57:20] he went down his knees literally crying
[57:21] and crying out to God for repentance and
[57:23] revival in the church you know he said
[57:26] everything that was preached was exactly
[57:27] what they needed and that's that same
[57:29] thing I preached here I don't think I
[57:30] added anything different I think it was
[57:32] all just same thing church attendance
[57:34] paying your ties not robbing God I
[57:37] preached on Star Wars a lot you know
[57:38] Netflix and just Turkey the same thing
[57:43] worshiping God putting the word first
[57:44] you know not putting anything above the
[57:47] word and it brought the church to its
[57:49] knees see so I feel like we're standing
[57:54] but right even right now I gotta make
[57:56] sure I take heed to my life which is
[57:59] this I got away my life carefully I and
[58:03] we all have to do that tonight with eggs
[58:04] my life is my life is this truly
[58:08] pleasing to God the things I'm watching
[58:11] on YouTube or the websites I'm going to
[58:13] or my facebook posts whatever and I love
[58:17] how you put bible scriptures on the
[58:18] facebook i love that i try to put as
[58:21] much as I can about Jesus or family on
[58:23] there to try to point and say thank you
[58:25] Jesus or thank God for this or thank God
[58:26] I was always trying to point it to Jesus
[58:30] see when we think we're the strongest
[58:32] that's when Paul says you got to be the
[58:35] most careful you got to be careful that
[58:37] you don't stumble into idolatry okay or
[58:42] a temptation he there hath no temptation
[58:46] taken you but such as common to man but
[58:48] God is faithful who not suffer you to be
[58:50] tempted above that you're able but will
[58:52] with the temptation also make a way to
[58:54] escape that you may be able to bear in
[58:56] that beautiful amen in every trial God
[59:00] makes a way for us to get out every
[59:03] child there's gonna be no trial where I
[59:05] couldn't overcome this Jesus or you
[59:07] didn't make a way for me to do that no
[59:09] Jesus makes away every single time we
[59:12] just got to be patient wait upon the
[59:13] Lord and we got to look for the way out
[59:15] well I see a lot of people get into sin
[59:17] and they don't even try to repent they
[59:19] don't even try to get out we gotta look
[59:20] for a way out amen it's exactly right
[59:24] and this encouraged me to you know
[59:26] there's no temptation that you've had
[59:28] except what's common to everybody else
[59:30] and as that pastor was praying on his
[59:33] knees and this pastor knew brother
[59:34] Branham he knew brother Branham he went
[59:37] to church with brother Branham in his
[59:40] whole life until brother Graham passed
[59:42] away in 65 so from night I think was
[59:44] from 1958 to 1965 he went to programs
[59:48] Church follow brother Ram around the
[59:50] country and he he would he was praying
[59:54] and cursing all these demons and saying
[59:56] you know I said I felt like a failure as
[59:59] a pastor and this scripture came to my
[1:00:04] heart the same struggles he has with one
[1:00:08] to see his people be more faithful get
[1:00:10] their idols out pray more come to church
[1:00:13] early and pray serve God get out all
[1:00:16] their you know attractions and
[1:00:18] temptation
[1:00:18] the same feelings he had was the same
[1:00:21] things I felt I'd say that encouraged me
[1:00:24] you guys remember when he was praying
[1:00:26] that remember that he was saying I felt
[1:00:28] like a failure and all these things and
[1:00:30] he's on his knees and God we humble
[1:00:32] ourselves forgive me I felt like I
[1:00:34] failed as a pastor and he's been pastor
[1:00:36] in 30 years I've been pastoring
[1:00:38] eleven-and-a-half and I just helped me
[1:00:41] the same temptation he has me even
[1:00:44] knowing brother Branham and the church
[1:00:45] they just had they just had three people
[1:00:48] healed of cancer through their prayers
[1:00:50] Bri and then he still afterwards then
[1:00:53] that was before the service and after
[1:00:55] the service he still said the church was
[1:00:56] back slid you tell me about that you see
[1:01:00] that that's the thing you can have the
[1:01:02] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:01:03] you can have people healed and
[1:01:05] everything like that but as a whole the
[1:01:08] church wasn't on fire and he knew it and
[1:01:10] so God used the message I brought from
[1:01:12] the red heifer to the host of choice he
[1:01:15] used that to bring them to repentance
[1:01:17] now hopefully they keep it up by God's
[1:01:19] grace so see what his sheep do they run
[1:01:23] from it
[1:01:24] if something's pops up on your phone
[1:01:26] like I don't talk to brother 1 now I
[1:01:29] talked to these guys these little kids
[1:01:30] at a Bible club when I was 4 September
[1:01:33] we taught a whole month
[1:01:34] at Bible Club on social media devices
[1:01:38] how to use devices and one of the boys
[1:01:40] made us all laugh he said he said mr.
[1:01:44] Smith I said yeah I said boys and girls
[1:01:47] how can you keep your eyes from those
[1:01:49] things and he said erasing and I said
[1:01:51] mr. Smith yes he said well what I do is
[1:01:54] when when my friend he said my friend
[1:01:56] tried to show me a bad picture on his
[1:01:58] iPod he said I took his iPod and I threw
[1:02:00] it across the room
[1:02:01] and I said that's the right thing to do
[1:02:04] although it could have cost him an iPod
[1:02:07] it could have cost him $179 hour much
[1:02:10] they cost but he literally said that his
[1:02:13] brother's like yeah he did and I thought
[1:02:15] my isn't that a puke a true picture of
[1:02:18] childlike faith if only us mature adult
[1:02:22] message believers would have enough
[1:02:26] sincerity if we're seeing something
[1:02:28] wrong throw it away
[1:02:30] I'm not saying break your phone I'm just
[1:02:31] say
[1:02:32] I'm not trying to get you in debt I'm
[1:02:33] necessarily trying to say but the
[1:02:35] reality of a Christian is to get away
[1:02:38] from sin as fast as you can don't play
[1:02:42] around with it don't don't stare it a
[1:02:44] little longer to shut it off get rid of
[1:02:46] it don't look at it
[1:02:47] that's childlike faith and that's what
[1:02:49] we need in our church that's what every
[1:02:51] church needs God showed me that the same
[1:02:54] things brother Brooks church needs is
[1:02:55] the same thing our church needs it's the
[1:02:57] same thing brother Tim Hume church needs
[1:02:59] and they have 300 I think in their
[1:03:01] church I was preaching to 300 people
[1:03:03] it's the same thing they need what they
[1:03:05] need they need back to their first love
[1:03:07] they need an on fire experience with
[1:03:11] Christ they need to only feed on the
[1:03:13] word of God and just cut and just flee
[1:03:17] from idolatry if they just see we always
[1:03:21] want new revelations but like I said God
[1:03:23] can't give us new until we do the old
[1:03:25] teachings until we until we obey the old
[1:03:29] commands how is God going to give us new
[1:03:30] and that's exactly true for our church
[1:03:33] every Church we've got to do the
[1:03:36] commands that we know to do and then God
[1:03:39] will bless us with more revelation
[1:03:41] that's always how it's been oh that's
[1:03:43] what that's what the Jesus told members
[1:03:44] Jesus told that to Andrew and Philip he
[1:03:46] said oh he said you've seen these do you
[1:03:48] believe after just these things he said
[1:03:50] I'll show you greater things to come
[1:03:51] remember that in John chapter 1 let's
[1:03:53] read that excited I'm really cutting up
[1:03:55] I'm really I really didn't quote that
[1:03:57] good at all let's go to John chapter 1
[1:04:00] boy that was pretty bad it's been a
[1:04:03] while since I appreciate okay yeah it's
[1:04:06] John 150 Jesus answer to sending him
[1:04:09] because I said unto thee I saw the under
[1:04:11] the fig tree believe us now thou shalt
[1:04:14] see greater than these and he said then
[1:04:18] verily verily I say unto you hereafter
[1:04:19] ye shall see heaven open and the angels
[1:04:21] of God ascending and descending I'm
[1:04:23] sorry ascending and descending upon the
[1:04:26] Son of Man okay so that's the idea if
[1:04:29] you can believe and obey the little
[1:04:32] things God's gonna show you a greater
[1:04:33] things than that
[1:04:34] hey man hallelujah alright so we have
[1:04:42] idea of sheep now let's look over here
[1:04:43] here's another yeah here's there's a
[1:04:45] third thought on sheep so before he
[1:04:48] finishes the open door he spends time on
[1:04:50] sheep and Shepherds but that was not all
[1:04:54] I saw and learned over there one day I
[1:04:55] got to thinking about having seen men
[1:04:57] out in the fields hurting different
[1:04:59] kinds of animals one fellow would be
[1:05:01] tending some pigs and others some goats
[1:05:02] and camels mules etc so I asked a friend
[1:05:06] who lived there what they call these men
[1:05:07] oh he replied their shepherds I couldn't
[1:05:10] take that I said you don't mean to say
[1:05:12] they're all shepherds Shepherds only
[1:05:15] herd sheep don't they know a shepherd is
[1:05:18] a herder or grazer so anyone who grazes
[1:05:21] animals is a shepherd well he said that
[1:05:26] did surprise me
[1:05:27] but I noticed the difference between
[1:05:29] those herders and the ones that took
[1:05:31] care of the Sheep come nighttime all the
[1:05:34] others took the I'm sorry but the
[1:05:36] Shepherd of the sheep left his animals
[1:05:37] in the fields and went on home the
[1:05:39] Shepherd took his sheep with them and
[1:05:41] put them into the fold and then lay down
[1:05:43] and became the door of the Sheep
[1:05:45] oh praise God our Shepherd never leaves
[1:05:47] us or forsake us amen sorry when
[1:05:50] nighttime comes I want to be in his
[1:05:52] phone I want to be in the care of Jesus
[1:05:54] amen glory don't you know that Church
[1:05:58] don't you know that the bartender
[1:06:01] tonight at his bar don't you know he's a
[1:06:02] shepherd don't you know that those are
[1:06:05] all his sheep don't you know the people
[1:06:08] at the Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert
[1:06:09] don't you know Tim McGraw as a shepherd
[1:06:11] those are all his sheep don't you know
[1:06:15] those men and women at the Trump rally
[1:06:16] tonight or whatever whenever rally they
[1:06:18] had don't you know he's the Shepherd and
[1:06:21] they're his sheep if they exalt him
[1:06:24] above the word of God then they become
[1:06:26] sheep which really they're goats they're
[1:06:29] not really sheep they are goats and they
[1:06:33] have a shepherd aren't you glad your
[1:06:35] Shepherd of Jesus sheep of Jesus Christ
[1:06:37] a shepherd hallelujah how do you know
[1:06:39] cuz everything he says I do I don't know
[1:06:44] you I never put anyone above Christ I
[1:06:45] never put anybody above the word Christ
[1:06:47] is number one see a lot of people are
[1:06:51] sheep of their boss and their boss is
[1:06:54] their true Shepherd of their life
[1:06:55] if their boss says you got to work and
[1:06:57] you said to go to church they're like
[1:06:58] okay or their schoolwork oh I've got a
[1:07:01] big test tomorrow well I can't go to
[1:07:02] church tonight we'll see your real
[1:07:04] Shepherd is your professor right it is
[1:07:08] that right I had many friends like that
[1:07:09] in college I'd be like where were you a
[1:07:11] church you know is that the chapel well
[1:07:14] I just study it on a Sunday morning you

[1:07:29] real pastor is your wife is that right
[1:07:32] you understand that and that's what it
[1:07:36] becomes that's what bro Graham said yeah
[1:07:38] they might be they're all shepherds in
[1:07:40] some way now ultimately who is their
[1:07:42] real pastor Satan because there's only
[1:07:45] two shepherds
[1:07:46] there's only good and evil but Jesus
[1:07:49] said there's only two masters God and
[1:07:51] may God right I'm sorry Gog and Mammon
[1:07:53] there's only two there's really only two
[1:07:55] Shepherds and I'm so glad I follow Jesus
[1:07:57] I'm so glad I found the path of the
[1:08:00] bloody bleeding word amen the word for
[1:08:04] today how do you know because I keep
[1:08:06] following in those narrow paths in other
[1:08:09] words what I mean I would say like this
[1:08:10] but I am not many people are living like
[1:08:12] you and I hey man not many people are
[1:08:15] walking the steps that we walk what is
[1:08:17] it it's full devotion to the word it's
[1:08:19] full of beaten to the Word of God we
[1:08:21] want to be in the word all the way hey
[1:08:23] man that's exactly right Church how do
[1:08:26] you know because most of our friends and
[1:08:27] I aren't in church right most of my
[1:08:30] friends in the well hopefully the people
[1:08:32] in our church are listening you're live
[1:08:33] streaming tonight hopefully those
[1:08:35] numbers have been going up so hopefully
[1:08:36] that's the case moving it like 18 or 20
[1:08:39] people live streaming that's great but I
[1:08:41] talk about most of my friends like at
[1:08:42] work or most of my friends you know in
[1:08:44] denomination church most of them don't
[1:08:45] even go to church on Wednesday night so
[1:08:48] see you and I if we're sincere were
[1:08:50] already going to be spiritually stronger
[1:08:52] than them and we ought to be praise God
[1:08:54] we ought to be because our true Shepherd
[1:08:58] is Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:09:01] it's not well I've got a homework I
[1:09:03] gotta turn in the morning or something
[1:09:05] like that my teacher at the middle
[1:09:07] school and my teacher at Arrowhead or
[1:09:08] mr. Smith I I want to be a I'm gonna be
[1:09:11] a faithful Shepherd to the church here
[1:09:13] by God's grace I think you understand
[1:09:15] what I'm saying
[1:09:16] we never put anything above the Word of
[1:09:18] God well you know it's Friday night I
[1:09:20] can't pray tonight because the ballgame
[1:09:22] is on tonight well now you know your
[1:09:25] your team your your team's coach the
[1:09:29] Ohio State football coach I forget his
[1:09:30] name now but he's your shepherd now if
[1:09:34] that game is more important than praying
[1:09:36] and reading your Bible he's now your
[1:09:37] shepherd so follow him but if you're a
[1:09:40] true sheep of God you'll follow Christ
[1:09:42] amen and then that way you'll follow the
[1:09:45] fivefold ministry because that's who he
[1:09:48] speaks through by man said that's God's
[1:09:49] dress swear amen
[1:09:51] now this strangely after reading this
[1:09:54] this morning I didn't plan this it just
[1:09:55] came to me as I was studying it
[1:09:56] strangely reminded me of a desire I had
[1:09:59] to go through and look at all the
[1:10:02] scriptures in the Old Testament that
[1:10:03] said Shepherd as I was preparing about
[1:10:06] 45 minutes this morning so I'm just
[1:10:10] gonna go through the ones that I felt
[1:10:11] were very helpful so I hope these are
[1:10:14] helpful for you let's go through let's
[1:10:16] go through and and the reason I want to
[1:10:18] go through these so you see what a true
[1:10:19] Shepherd looks like compared to a false
[1:10:22] Shepherd now we already know the true
[1:10:25] voice of Christ will point us the true
[1:10:27] Shepherd will points to the word we know
[1:10:29] a false Shepherd will point you to
[1:10:31] idolatry and the Bible said they'll
[1:10:33] tickle your ears the Bible said they'll
[1:10:35] turn grace into lasciviousness
[1:10:36] lawlessness where you can do whatever
[1:10:39] you want you're going to heaven you can
[1:10:40] do whatever the nonsense the true
[1:10:43] Shepherd takes us back to the word now
[1:10:46] Isaiah 55 56 was the first one I thought
[1:10:48] worked now look this is God talking his
[1:10:53] Watchmen are blind so God's Watchmen or
[1:10:55] shepherds are blind they are all
[1:10:57] ignorant they're all dumb dogs and
[1:10:59] that's some harsh words there sometimes
[1:11:01] God balls people out sometimes I get up
[1:11:05] here people think I'm mad but do they I
[1:11:07] wonder if they prayed or fasted before
[1:11:08] the service because if they're not in a
[1:11:11] spiritual Channel they won't know if
[1:11:13] it's God in me or if it's just my own
[1:11:14] human human nature but I'll tell you
[1:11:18] most
[1:11:19] most Sundays I'm fasting and praying
[1:11:21] right most Sundays I fast and pray but
[1:11:25] see these preachers are all dumb dogs
[1:11:29] that's what the Bible says
[1:11:30] now dumb means you cannot talk their
[1:11:32] dogs but with no bark and they cannot
[1:11:35] bark so see there's really they see the
[1:11:37] the preachers don't have a warning oh my
[1:11:40] amen see sometimes brother brother Adam
[1:11:43] and mother Malachi sometimes on
[1:11:45] Wednesday now I'm barking out warnings
[1:11:47] all right get away from that sin get
[1:11:49] away see but the the false pastors have
[1:11:52] no bark they don't warn the people but
[1:11:56] God said a real Shepherd will have some
[1:11:58] bark to him amen glory get away from
[1:12:02] that TV here
[1:12:03] get away from that app get away from
[1:12:05] pride get away from stealing from God
[1:12:07] you know get away from us see he's got
[1:12:09] to have some bark behind him amen
[1:12:12] sleeping lying down they loved this
[1:12:14] slumber so they're lazy the false
[1:12:16] shepherds are lazy they don't want to
[1:12:19] get up and work for God I'm happy to
[1:12:22] work for Jesus amen I always even my
[1:12:25] hobbies are all Jesus except for
[1:12:28] Taekwondo but that's just for my body so
[1:12:29] I don't die early you know thought less
[1:12:31] God wants to take me off the earth early
[1:12:33] and that's because James browning told
[1:12:34] me that James browning said before he
[1:12:36] passed away he told me if I could do one
[1:12:38] thing he said I wouldn't did more
[1:12:39] exercise when I was younger and so I
[1:12:41] took that to heart
[1:12:42] he said cuz right now I could be doing
[1:12:44] missionary work he said but instead I'm
[1:12:45] in the hospital
[1:12:46] that's why I do Taekwondo that's the
[1:12:48] only thing that I do that's really not
[1:12:49] God centered although what did we talk
[1:12:51] about last night Malachi light and
[1:12:54] darkness remember last night the the
[1:12:57] minister talked or left mister the
[1:12:59] master talked about light and darkness
[1:13:00] and it was all about truth versus evil
[1:13:03] revelation remember the key of knowledge
[1:13:05] we talked about that last night that's
[1:13:06] the Bible he was preaching to us I got
[1:13:08] to hear preaching last night from my
[1:13:10] Taekwondo master now how many people do
[1:13:11] you know that like you can do that but
[1:13:14] you see they have no bark they have no
[1:13:17] warning to them yeah there are greedy
[1:13:19] dogs see these pastors are greedy the
[1:13:22] only want they only care about your
[1:13:23] money and never had they can never have
[1:13:26] enough money and they're the Shepherds
[1:13:29] that cannot understand they all look to
[1:13:31] their own way
[1:13:32] everyone first gain from his quarter I'm
[1:13:37] glad when Adam and Bo did that pastor
[1:13:39] appreciation card for me there was a
[1:13:40] couple people on there the wrote that
[1:13:42] I'm so glad you're a pastor you care
[1:13:44] about all the sheep anytime Church I
[1:13:49] know someone's got a need I'm looking
[1:13:52] out for their well-being God knows that
[1:13:56] and if I failed God forgive me but
[1:13:59] everyone I know of I try to help every
[1:14:01] person I know if I know they have a need
[1:14:04] somehow God's my witness come ye say
[1:14:08] they I will fetch wine and we will fill
[1:14:10] ourselves with strong drink and tomorrow
[1:14:12] we should be as the day and much more
[1:14:14] abundant see that's what these preachers
[1:14:16] are saying oh let's just get let's just
[1:14:17] enjoy worldly things let's just get
[1:14:19] drunk on idolatry see let's just Oh
[1:14:21] Lords not the coming Lords not soon you
[1:14:23] know they've got no bark you know they
[1:14:26] don't scare anybody they don't they
[1:14:28] don't bring the reverence of God to a
[1:14:30] service you understand that we just all
[1:14:32] just relax it and make as much money and
[1:14:34] it's all about money it's all about you
[1:14:35] know join life here like the preachers
[1:14:39] say they say living your best life now I
[1:14:41] want to live the best life I can for
[1:14:43] Christ now but my best life is going to
[1:14:45] be in heaven amen my best life is not
[1:14:49] going to be right now I'm gonna have
[1:14:50] struggles I'm gonna go through trials
[1:14:52] I'm gonna have financial battles I'm
[1:14:54] gonna have spiritual battles this I want
[1:14:56] to live my best now but my best life is
[1:14:58] walking on those streets of gold amen
[1:15:00] glory that's gonna be my best life amen
[1:15:04] when we all fall down and throw our
[1:15:06] crowns at the feet of Jesus that's gonna
[1:15:07] be my best life they men
[1:15:11] Jeremiah 23 and I will gather the
[1:15:13] remnant of my flock out of all countries
[1:15:15] whither I've driven them now this got it
[1:15:17] this is happening right now
[1:15:18] God's drawing Israel back to the
[1:15:20] homeland and will bring them again to
[1:15:22] their folds and they should be fruitful
[1:15:23] and increase and I'll set up Shepherds
[1:15:25] over them which shall feed them and they
[1:15:28] shall fear no more nor be dismayed
[1:15:29] neither should they be lacking say at
[1:15:31] the Lord so see that's my job my job is
[1:15:33] to preach so we have no fear right
[1:15:37] that's what the Shepherds gonna do
[1:15:38] they're gonna preach and take away all
[1:15:39] fear they're gonna feed the people so
[1:15:42] the people aren't dismayed or
[1:15:43] discouraged I hope you leave here
[1:15:45] encouraged tonight
[1:15:46] by God's grace I I leave every service
[1:15:49] encouraged once I get the van I may have
[1:15:51] some mind battles Satan tried to
[1:15:52] discourage me but when I'm worshipping
[1:15:54] Jesus and preaching his word and loving
[1:15:56] him and praying I'm nothing but
[1:15:58] encouraged amen but see the real pastor
[1:16:01] they let fear stay in the church I'm
[1:16:03] sorry the false pastor they let fear
[1:16:05] stay and they have people that are
[1:16:06] discouraged and they don't get people
[1:16:09] the real meat that they need they're
[1:16:11] lacking but we should leave here with
[1:16:13] all that we have need of amen now look
[1:16:17] how will you Shepherds and cry and
[1:16:21] wallow yourselves in the ashes so God's
[1:16:23] saying you're gonna cry and roll around
[1:16:26] your ashes you principle the flock for
[1:16:28] the days of your slaughter and of your
[1:16:29] dispersions are accomplished so they're
[1:16:31] gonna get slaughtered and and spread
[1:16:32] apart and you shall fall like a pleasant
[1:16:35] vessel and the Shepherd's shall have no
[1:16:37] way to flee nor the principal of the
[1:16:39] flock to escape so this is the this like
[1:16:42] the day of judgment a voice of the cry
[1:16:44] the Shepherd's and a howling of the
[1:16:46] principal the flock shall be heard for
[1:16:47] the Lord has spoiled their pasture so
[1:16:50] see that's not a lot of earthly
[1:16:52] Shepherds do today they just try to make
[1:16:53] life so easy here on earth all they're
[1:16:56] concerned about is making their home
[1:16:58] better right or their kingdom or their
[1:17:01] church bigger see and so they scream and
[1:17:04] they howl because they're losing their
[1:17:06] earthly goods but we don't store up
[1:17:08] treasures on earth we store up treasures
[1:17:10] in heaven amen
[1:17:11] if we lose everything what who cares if
[1:17:14] we lose this church and the chairs get
[1:17:15] burnt up who cares if I lose my home or
[1:17:18] van who cares at least I got Jesus amen
[1:17:21] will it be hard yeah but our delight the
[1:17:24] reason we cry and scream isn't because
[1:17:26] we live net lose natural things it's
[1:17:28] because the reason we cry and scream is
[1:17:30] because we want to see people saved amen
[1:17:32] that's the real burden our treasures are
[1:17:35] in heaven not upon the earth but see the
[1:17:38] earth
[1:17:38] the sinful pastures I'll say like this
[1:17:40] the ghost shepherds the Shepherd's of
[1:17:43] the goats there oh the only reason they
[1:17:45] cries because they don't get enough
[1:17:47] money or they don't get enough lands or
[1:17:50] other house isn't big enough for all
[1:17:51] these things all they care about is
[1:17:53] money look at your
[1:17:57] it kind of tears preachers up this tears
[1:18:00] up the false preachers not the good ones
[1:18:02] the false ones my people have been lost
[1:18:05] sheep their Shepherds have caused them
[1:18:07] to go astray they have turned them away
[1:18:10] on the mountains in other words I'll
[1:18:13] just just keep wondering keep wandering
[1:18:15] away from the word it's okay if you just
[1:18:16] wander away from our services and it's
[1:18:19] okay you'll be fine out there
[1:18:21] no we need a shepherd that barks and say
[1:18:23] get back here
[1:18:24] get off the mountains come back to the
[1:18:27] fold come back where their safety did
[1:18:29] you know their safety here tonight in
[1:18:30] the house of God amen why because God's
[1:18:33] angels are here Church oh yeah
[1:18:35] the angel camps about those that fear
[1:18:38] the Lord there's angels in our myths
[1:18:40] amen and when a pastor says I know it's
[1:18:43] okay for you to miss church it's okay if
[1:18:44] you're not the fellowship with the
[1:18:45] Saints it's okay like this it's like a
[1:18:47] fall shepherdess then the sheep just
[1:18:49] walk out on the mountains gonna get cut
[1:18:52] up by some wolves you don't gonna have a
[1:18:54] spiritual death right from the wolves
[1:18:56] and they've caused people to go straight
[1:18:59] on this is what I would say as far as I
[1:19:01] know I haven't preached any false
[1:19:02] doctrine in years no one has come to
[1:19:06] show me any false doctrine in years I
[1:19:08] might have said something wrong way you
[1:19:09] know we had some conversations something
[1:19:11] mighta came out the wrong way but as far
[1:19:13] as I know I haven't led anyone astray I
[1:19:16] haven't let anyone into idolatry I've
[1:19:19] been trying to lead people into knee
[1:19:20] ology hallelujah we need to pray more we
[1:19:28] need to study Obama's more we didn't
[1:19:29] listen to the seven churches need to
[1:19:31] listen to mother anymore that's what I'm
[1:19:32] trying to lead people into if I'd caught
[1:19:37] anybody go to straight they haven't let
[1:19:38] me know and I don't know about it again
[1:19:40] God is my witness the open door the
[1:19:44] Shepherd becomes the door amen and if
[1:19:48] there's anything that comes to the
[1:19:49] church any new idea it's supposed to
[1:19:51] come through the pastor that's right
[1:19:54] there's any relationship like you know
[1:19:56] people wanting to court it needs to come
[1:19:58] through the of course the father of the
[1:20:00] daughter but also he's come to the
[1:20:01] pastor everything needs to come through
[1:20:03] the door praise God that's why years ago
[1:20:07] you know
[1:20:08] I want to be the only one I made this
[1:20:10] rule I'm the only one that he knows
[1:20:12] everybody in the church and I do that
[1:20:15] because the voice of the of the the the
[1:20:19] Shepherd should have the voice to the
[1:20:21] sheep if someone just starts making a
[1:20:24] list and so I was texting everybody in
[1:20:26] the church and the brother from New York
[1:20:28] told me that that a brother does that
[1:20:30] and it divided his church he started to
[1:20:33] become a preacher a text preacher he
[1:20:34] called it and you won't find that in the
[1:20:36] Bible this brother tried to get start
[1:20:39] influencing other brothers and their
[1:20:40] wives and tried to draw a church see he
[1:20:44] didn't go through the door he didn't go
[1:20:46] through the pastor hello there's one
[1:20:50] door there's one way and any new
[1:20:53] doctrine see any preacher that comes
[1:20:55] through here I got to make sure they
[1:20:56] come to that I know all about them first
[1:20:57] I got to make sure they live the right
[1:21:00] life I've got to ask them about their
[1:21:02] life I got to make sure they're gonna
[1:21:03] preach the right thing because the sheep
[1:21:06] goes through the door and he is the door
[1:21:08] and that's what all these church books
[1:21:11] have come people tried to exalt
[1:21:12] themselves as pastors or bringing new
[1:21:14] doctrines and they avoid the pastor you
[1:21:17] see but this is what the Bible said they
[1:21:20] have gone from Mountain to Hill they
[1:21:22] have forgotten their resting place see
[1:21:24] many sheep forget where they find their
[1:21:27] rest where do we where did David say I
[1:21:30] want to dwell all the days of my life
[1:21:31] does anybody know Lydia in the house
[1:21:35] Lord thank you in the house of the Lord
[1:21:38] where a day where did David say one day
[1:21:40] at work is better than a thousand
[1:21:42] elsewhere one day at the restaurant at
[1:21:48] Chipotle one day in the house Lord is
[1:21:52] better than a thousand elsewhere
[1:21:55] one thing I'd ask and I would seek that
[1:21:57] I could dwell in the house Lord all the
[1:21:59] days of my life some people forget
[1:22:01] churches the place where where you find
[1:22:03] rest for your souls amen
[1:22:06] I'm good attitude toward the preacher
[1:22:09] you got to love the pastor you got the
[1:22:12] people you got love everybody in the
[1:22:15] church you can't have any divisions you
[1:22:17] have any complexes all that has to be
[1:22:19] gone and then church becomes a resting
[1:22:21] place
[1:22:21] and it becomes a place where you can
[1:22:23] find rest for your soul you can find
[1:22:25] peace all that found them have devoured
[1:22:33] them so this is the time of the Sheep
[1:22:34] the Shepherd just let him go out and
[1:22:36] they already devoured by sin devoured by
[1:22:38] Satan and their adversary said we offend
[1:22:40] not because they have sinned against the
[1:22:41] Lord the habitation of justice even the
[1:22:43] Lord the hope of their father so they
[1:22:45] sinned against God now this is quite a
[1:22:48] chapter here I'm not much time I got I
[1:22:50] didn't set my timer but I realized I got
[1:22:52] about let me set it for 15 minutes and
[1:22:58] then I maybe I'll have five more after
[1:23:00] that I didn't set my watch I don't know
[1:23:01] what time exactly I started okay I don't
[1:23:05] know this one this looks like the
[1:23:06] Antichrist maybe you can read that at
[1:23:07] home I'm not gonna read that one tonight
[1:23:08] because I don't know who it is it sure
[1:23:09] looks like the Antichrist as a shepherd
[1:23:11] a false shepherd let's go to Ezekiel 34
[1:23:14] this whole chapters about shepherds
[1:23:16] which I may preach on later we'll see
[1:23:18] but the most of our verses are 2 2 4 6
[1:23:21] to 12 13 to 16 so let's read those
[1:23:24] I hope this has becoming clear Church
[1:23:28] about what a true Shepherd is Jesus and
[1:23:31] of course myself as a pastor all the
[1:23:33] faithful pastors around the area you
[1:23:35] know like brother Jim shumake and Chad
[1:23:38] lamb and brother cam and brother Brooks
[1:23:39] and brother did Tim Humes and all these
[1:23:42] wonderful brothers brother Samuel
[1:23:43] browning I start naming them all you
[1:23:45] know all of them mother Annie sayest you
[1:23:47] know Vaughn carry on all these wonderful
[1:23:50] brothers zekiel 34 2 to 4 but I don't do
[1:23:56] to read 2 3 & 4
[1:24:33] let's say he
[1:24:35] bonza that wish was broken either heavy
[1:24:39] brought the guns again that which was
[1:24:42] driven away he didn't have easy sought
[1:24:45] that which was lost a width course and
[1:24:48] with cruelty and he rolled in them amen
[1:24:51] praise the Lord
[1:24:53] that was good thank you brother
[1:24:54] appreciate that so see judgments upon
[1:24:57] the shepherds because they only fed
[1:25:00] themselves they only clothed themselves
[1:25:02] a nice clothes let me tell you ivan
[1:25:06] about any nice clothes in a long time
[1:25:07] this was a good wilt I've had this for
[1:25:10] about ten years all my suits are
[1:25:13] probably at least ten years old I don't
[1:25:14] even I never I haven't bought one in
[1:25:16] over ten years
[1:25:17] you know but see uh-huh anyways you eat
[1:25:22] the fat you clothed you with the wool
[1:25:24] you kill them that are fed but you feed
[1:25:25] not the flock look at verse four you
[1:25:29] haven't strengthened disease I try to
[1:25:30] pray for everybody that's sick that I
[1:25:32] know of
[1:25:32] and I'll fast here many times on
[1:25:34] Saturdays and Sundays I'll fast for
[1:25:37] people
[1:25:37] I'll go pray for them it wherever they
[1:25:38] if they ask me to come pray for them
[1:25:39] neither have you healed that which was
[1:25:41] sick neither have you bound up that
[1:25:42] which was broken neither brought again
[1:25:44] that which was driven away I've gone to
[1:25:45] people's houses that have left if
[1:25:47] they'll let me come over sure I let them
[1:25:48] come over or try to come over and get
[1:25:50] them back to come back to church defend
[1:25:52] the message but most people when they
[1:25:55] leave they won't call me back I try to
[1:25:58] text them I try to email them I still
[1:26:00] email people have left the church and
[1:26:01] they never I mean why every now and then
[1:26:03] don't email me back and they'll thank me
[1:26:04] for emailing them I try to go out if
[1:26:07] they'll come back I try to bring them
[1:26:09] back but look but with force and with
[1:26:11] cruelty have you ruled them but now
[1:26:13] remember you gotta balance this force
[1:26:15] and cruelty versus having barked the
[1:26:19] pastor's got to have some bark but he
[1:26:21] doesn't force people into things he's
[1:26:23] not cruel to them remember where we just
[1:26:26] say he just called him dumb dogs so see
[1:26:28] you see I've to have to have a balance
[1:26:30] that's that you have to have a balance
[1:26:32] there sometimes the Holy Spirit will
[1:26:33] ball people out just like John the
[1:26:35] Baptist he said your generation of
[1:26:37] vipers you know Jesus said Jesus said
[1:26:40] you're Pharisees you're making your
[1:26:42] converts to follow the sons of hell than
[1:26:44] you are you're making them double
[1:26:47] anointed sons of hell
[1:26:49] so see it takes a balance that's why
[1:26:52] there sometimes it feels like I'm hard
[1:26:53] preaching I believe it's the Holy Spirit
[1:26:55] because it's trying to get people to the
[1:26:57] Word of God now look at verse yeah I'm
[1:27:01] not gonna run out of time
[1:27:02] verse 6 my sheep wandered through all
[1:27:04] the mountains and upon every high hill
[1:27:06] yeah my flock was scattered upon all the
[1:27:08] face of the earth and none did search or
[1:27:10] seek after them like I said I've tried
[1:27:11] to go on after everybody if they'll talk
[1:27:13] to me I'm happy I don't want I want to
[1:27:15] talk them back I try to do everything I
[1:27:17] can to bring them back now verse okay
[1:27:21] let's go to 12 yeah all the way well
[1:27:23] let's go yeah 7 to 12 therefore you
[1:27:26] Shepherds hear the word Lord as I live
[1:27:28] saith the Lord God surely because my
[1:27:29] flock became a prey and my flock became
[1:27:31] meat to every beast of the field because
[1:27:33] there was no Shepherd neither did my
[1:27:34] Shepherds search for my flock but the
[1:27:36] Shepherd's fed themselves and fed not my
[1:27:38] flock therefore o Shepherds hear the
[1:27:43] word of Lord thus saith the Lord God
[1:27:44] behold I'm against the shepherds and
[1:27:46] I'll require my flock at their hand and
[1:27:49] cause them to cease from feeding the
[1:27:51] flock neither shall the Shepherd's feed
[1:27:52] themselves anymore for I will deliver my
[1:27:54] flock from their mouths that they may
[1:27:56] not be meat for them in that striking
[1:28:00] church think about all the unfaithful
[1:28:01] pastors in the message there's some
[1:28:04] think about all the faithful ones though
[1:28:06] praise the Lord
[1:28:07] see God is gonna require how did you
[1:28:10] treat the flock did you preach them the
[1:28:12] message did you preach the revelation of
[1:28:14] the Word of God for this hour or you try
[1:28:16] to preach him Lutheran doctrine you try
[1:28:19] to preach him Pentecostal doctrine oh
[1:28:21] you all need to speak in tongues what
[1:28:23] food did you feed them I'm glad that we
[1:28:25] feed on the fresh word of the hour we
[1:28:28] feed on the word that's been revealed
[1:28:30] today praise God the evidence of the
[1:28:32] Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues
[1:28:33] the avesta' the Holy Ghost might include
[1:28:35] that but the evidence Holy Ghost is
[1:28:37] believing and living all the Word of God
[1:28:39] you must do both you must believe it and
[1:28:41] you also must must also live it that's
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:45] verse 11 for thus saith the Lord God
[1:28:48] behold I even I will search both search
[1:28:51] my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd
[1:28:53] seeketh out his flock in the day that he
[1:28:55] is among his sheep that are scattered so
[1:28:57] will I seek out my sheep and will
[1:28:58] deliver them out of all the places where
[1:29:00] they have been scattered in the cloudy
[1:29:01] and dark
[1:29:02] amen hallelujah
[1:29:05] now I'm gonna skip pass I have a lot of
[1:29:07] New Testament Scriptures to I'm skipping
[1:29:09] past these because I want to finish this
[1:29:13] thought I got to finish this open door I
[1:29:14] got to finish it tonight okay I just
[1:29:16] can't I don't know if I can take this
[1:29:17] another night so just why I just want to
[1:29:19] feel like I'm done now I love it I could
[1:29:21] preach another night but I want to feel
[1:29:22] like I'm done and then move on the next
[1:29:24] stop now that we can see Jesus the door
[1:29:26] he's the door of the Sheep and notice
[1:29:28] what speaks now of the door opening what
[1:29:31] is that but a revelation of him so when
[1:29:33] does the open door symbolize it means
[1:29:35] Jesus revealing himself who he is and
[1:29:37] that revelation is opening up to bring
[1:29:41] us strength to illuminate the word and
[1:29:43] the glorify His name amen there it is
[1:29:45] right there so I need to I need to fix
[1:29:47] that I missed that right there when I'm
[1:29:49] studying give me just a second here let
[1:29:52] me I need to highlight that real quick I
[1:29:57] can't miss that I need to make sure I
[1:30:00] have that for next time I look over okay
[1:30:04] sorry about that that's the threefold
[1:30:06] member the open door was connected to
[1:30:08] three things in that scripture strength
[1:30:10] word and glue and glorifying his name it
[1:30:14] was in the midst of the last two ages of
[1:30:16] the revelation of the deity of Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ blossomed out before us remember
[1:30:19] Philadelphia Laodicea the open door age
[1:30:22] yes we knew he was God House could he be
[1:30:25] our Savior but to know that he was only
[1:30:28] God or God alone that he was Alpha Omega
[1:30:31] that this Jesus with both Lord and
[1:30:33] Christ
[1:30:34] making him Lord Jesus Christ the father
[1:30:36] son and holy ghost all one person Amen
[1:30:39] that had been lost since the first
[1:30:41] Church ages but now we're seeing it
[1:30:43] again so brother Ham said the little
[1:30:45] strength comes from the revelation of
[1:30:47] the deity of Christ Jesus is the word
[1:30:50] and the name of course we baptize in the
[1:30:52] name of Lord Jesus we glorify his name
[1:30:54] now look at this thought did you know he
[1:30:56] said this brother branham said if you
[1:30:58] believe in the Trinity he said your you
[1:31:00] actually worship 3 he said you're
[1:31:01] breaking the first commandment you
[1:31:02] worship 3 God's the revelation of who he
[1:31:06] was they come back indeed Godhead is not
[1:31:09] a three-person God with one personality
[1:31:13] they and I had a man emailed me this
[1:31:15] this week about the Trinity he said I
[1:31:17] believe he's three persons in one person
[1:31:19] now can you imagine the nonsense and
[1:31:21] that you've got to be insane to believe
[1:31:23] that you're three people in one person
[1:31:28] it doesn't make sense Church I just like
[1:31:32] I can't even grasp that you know I mean
[1:31:34] I can't even understand how they can say
[1:31:35] some of these things oh my and then he
[1:31:40] was this guy was using the Creed to
[1:31:44] prove that he was right instead of the
[1:31:45] Bible and I said well because I was
[1:31:48] saying how the Creed says he's he's
[1:31:50] three gods and he said no at the end of
[1:31:52] the Creed the Athanasian Creed says he's
[1:31:55] not three gods he's one God he said
[1:31:57] that's his proof your proof could not be
[1:31:59] the Creed the proof has to be the word
[1:32:01] amen
[1:32:01] the Bible said prove all things not by
[1:32:04] the Creed by the word Amen but see they
[1:32:06] have to lean upon a creed which means I
[1:32:10] believe they have to lean upon their
[1:32:11] beliefs rather than God's beliefs and
[1:32:14] that's in a shame and that said this is
[1:32:17] and they think they're saying they think
[1:32:18] they're they love their they know that
[1:32:20] the Bible there's one personality scene
[1:32:23] there can't be three personalities there
[1:32:26] is about one person but they who believe
[1:32:28] in three persons have a three God
[1:32:30] Godhead and are guilty of breaking the
[1:32:32] first commandment the first they can't
[1:32:34] even they can't even obey the very first
[1:32:36] commandment because of the Trinity so I
[1:32:39] just I just put this out here Tertullian
[1:32:41] he was the scholar that he wrote the
[1:32:44] word Trinity first and he wrote it
[1:32:46] around 300 AD okay so that was
[1:32:50] introduced here and now brother Ram said
[1:32:52] the open door we can finally move past
[1:32:54] this was in Philadelphia and Laodicea
[1:32:56] now we have an open door to the Godhead
[1:32:58] to Jesus name and baptism to knowing who
[1:33:02] God is Church it was hidden for almost
[1:33:04] my mam said I've said after the first
[1:33:06] age they lost it there one two three
[1:33:09] four after for ages God's giving it back
[1:33:11] to us out of there yeah it's God but the
[1:33:16] revelation the God had his back I'm
[1:33:18] almost done here let me check and see
[1:33:19] I'm almost done oh well yeah okay I got
[1:33:23] some more I may skip
[1:33:25] but the revelation of the Godhead is
[1:33:27] back and now the true church can build
[1:33:29] and strength again after all this time
[1:33:32] she finally knows who her Lord is can
[1:33:34] you imagine being married to your spouse
[1:33:36] and not even known who they are because
[1:33:39] they lied right and that's what the
[1:33:41] Trinity is it's a lie it's a lie from
[1:33:43] hell after all this time she finally
[1:33:46] knows who our Lord is once again we were
[1:33:48] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:49] just as they did at Pentecost look what
[1:33:53] my mom says here this is a good thought
[1:33:55] what is the open door the revelation of
[1:33:58] the supreme need of Jesus Christ what'd
[1:34:00] he say the first church church age back
[1:34:02] there he said I am he that was which is
[1:34:04] which shall come I'm the first and the
[1:34:06] last I am The Almighty he said it three
[1:34:09] different times he made himself deity to
[1:34:12] this first church here before he went
[1:34:14] into the last church age he said I said
[1:34:16] before you an open door I want you to
[1:34:18] see I want you to see I'm sorry if you
[1:34:20] want to see the revelation here it is
[1:34:22] where he would build his church and the
[1:34:24] only way that he could take his church
[1:34:26] is back to the revelation of what he is
[1:34:28] truly a man that's what that is the only
[1:34:32] way he could build the church again is
[1:34:34] to bring them back to where they started
[1:34:36] huh me know we only had two prophets
[1:34:38] real prophets we had a major profit here
[1:34:41] and we had a major profit here how many
[1:34:42] know that in between they only had minor
[1:34:45] prophets there was no major prophets in
[1:34:48] here we only had a major profit alpha
[1:34:50] and a major profit at the Omega age the
[1:34:53] last age the closing age now you ever
[1:34:58] heard that dream about brother Branham
[1:34:59] with the club three three corner Club
[1:35:01] yeah that's read out you like this I
[1:35:03] think this is the one I'm closing with
[1:35:04] yeah I think this is the whole thing yep
[1:35:07] so let's close to this store you like
[1:35:09] this oops sorry
[1:35:12] let me tell you
[1:35:13] god-given dream I had about triune
[1:35:15] baptism this was not a vision but a
[1:35:18] dream you know I'm sure that one of the
[1:35:20] blessings of the church age was to
[1:35:21] receive dreams by the Holy Ghost just
[1:35:23] the same as one can receive visions it
[1:35:26] was about 3 a.m. on a Saturday morning I
[1:35:28] just got enough to get Joseph a drink of
[1:35:30] water when I lay down I fell asleep
[1:35:32] instantly and dream this dream I saw a
[1:35:34] man that I was supposed was my I suppose
[1:35:37] was my father he was a great big burly
[1:35:39] man or I also saw a woman who was
[1:35:42] supposed to be my mother but she didn't
[1:35:43] look like her even as the man did not
[1:35:46] look like my father this man was very
[1:35:48] mean to his wife he had a large club
[1:35:50] with three corners on it I looked on
[1:35:53] Google I couldn't find a three-cornered
[1:35:54] Club I want to just have a picture for
[1:35:56] the kids you know so there's a real mean
[1:35:58] man and he's treating this woman mean
[1:36:00] he's got a three-cornered Club so it's
[1:36:02] kind of got like three corners on it
[1:36:03] it's kind of hard to picture so the top
[1:36:05] of his club looks like that it's got
[1:36:06] three corners on it got like a like a
[1:36:09] big piece like a baseball back so it's
[1:36:11] got three corners at the top okay
[1:36:14] that's what he had a dream of this man
[1:36:17] was very mean you know when you take a
[1:36:20] log and set it on the end and hit it
[1:36:21] with an axe it makes a three-cornered
[1:36:23] wedge like a piece of firewood it was
[1:36:25] like that he would take this club and
[1:36:28] hit her with it and knock her down and
[1:36:30] she would lie there crying he would walk
[1:36:32] around with his chest stuck out on his
[1:36:33] face was such a proud boastful look that
[1:36:36] he appeared to take a great pride and
[1:36:38] satisfaction beating up a poor little
[1:36:40] woman every time she tried to get up you
[1:36:42] and hit her I did not like what he was
[1:36:45] doing but as I considered stopping and I
[1:36:47] thought I can't tackle that man he's too
[1:36:49] big and then he's supposed to be my
[1:36:51] father
[1:36:52] but down inside I knew he wasn't my
[1:36:53] father I knew that no man had the right
[1:36:55] to treat a woman like that and the
[1:36:57] church said you know there's people in
[1:37:01] the message that beat that there's men
[1:37:02] that beat their wives it's awful they're
[1:37:04] not through with the Holy Ghost they're
[1:37:07] probably not even saved a man that would
[1:37:09] beat a woman or a child or hurt a child
[1:37:11] they're probably not even saved because
[1:37:14] they won't inherit the kingdom of God
[1:37:15] that's effeminate that's that same type
[1:37:17] of dominating spirit but down okay I
[1:37:22] went over and grabbed him by the collar
[1:37:23] and turned around and said you have no
[1:37:26] right to strike her
[1:37:27] and when I said that my muscles grew and
[1:37:30] I look like a giant see why we got to
[1:37:32] stand up against sin we got to stand up
[1:37:34] and fight against sin the man saw them
[1:37:37] and then he was scared of me and I said
[1:37:39] you strike her again you'll deal with me
[1:37:41] he hesitated to strike her again and
[1:37:43] then the dream left me see he's standing
[1:37:47] up for the church right and I gotta
[1:37:50] stand up for you and you've got to stand
[1:37:52] up against denominations right
[1:37:54] I woke immediately after the dream and I
[1:37:57] thought how strange it was I wondered
[1:37:58] why I had dreamed about that woman when
[1:38:00] suddenly there he came I love when he
[1:38:02] comes hey I love when Jesus comes and
[1:38:06] the presence of God became known to me
[1:38:08] an interpreter of the dream came known
[1:38:10] to him okay there's my 15 minutes I'll
[1:38:12] put five more yeah I'm doing good on
[1:38:14] time okay it's only eight 48:36 and the
[1:38:23] interpretation of dream came from him
[1:38:25] from Christ now you people know that not
[1:38:27] only have I interpreted your dreams
[1:38:29] exactly but I have many many times told
[1:38:31] you what you dream so that you never had
[1:38:33] to tell me the woman represents the
[1:38:35] Church of the world today I was born
[1:38:37] right into this mess the mess that she
[1:38:39] was in so were you and I she was
[1:38:45] supposed to be kind of a mother she's
[1:38:46] the mother of harlots her husband is the
[1:38:48] denomination's that rule her the
[1:38:51] three-cornered block is a false triune
[1:38:53] baptism unto a trinity see why do people
[1:38:58] say father only goes there trying to get
[1:38:59] you to believe in three gods that's the
[1:39:02] whole point behind it
[1:39:03] they're trying Satan try to make people
[1:39:05] and idolaters if he can get him father
[1:39:08] son Holy Ghost and if he could have him
[1:39:10] read just Matthew 28 without reading the
[1:39:11] book of Acts if he can get him to do
[1:39:14] that then he can maybe he could get them
[1:39:17] to be an idolatry on the day of judgment
[1:39:19] well I believe in three persons I
[1:39:21] believe God has three persons in one
[1:39:22] person Oh shame on them see every time
[1:39:27] she started to rise up that means the
[1:39:29] congregation begin to accept water
[1:39:31] baptism in name of Lord Jesus he would
[1:39:34] drive her right down again with that
[1:39:35] false doctrine he was so
[1:39:38] that I was afraid of him at first when I
[1:39:40] came against him I found I had great
[1:39:41] muscles great and powerful muscles they
[1:39:46] were face muscles ha ha ha
[1:39:49] praise God do you see Church when you
[1:39:52] get in a scriptural battle of somebody
[1:39:53] what does it make you do it makes you
[1:39:54] want to fight and not in a bad way but
[1:39:58] it makes you want to see the word
[1:39:59] prevail
[1:40:01] it doesn't make you see it doesn't make
[1:40:04] me like with this guy me me on this week
[1:40:06] about the journey it doesn't make me
[1:40:07] want to see him go to hell but at once
[1:40:09] me and wants to see Jesus beat down that
[1:40:12] denominational spirit and it makes me
[1:40:15] want to see him leave his denomination
[1:40:17] and get free and get baptized in Jesus
[1:40:19] Christ's name Amen I got a good
[1:40:21] testimony a preacher a Pentecostal
[1:40:26] preacher in a Spanish church in Texas
[1:40:28] saw my video on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:30] baptism he shared it with his pastor and
[1:40:33] his pastor turned down he shared it with
[1:40:35] his wife and his wife turned it down but
[1:40:38] he said brother Jesse I'm willing to fly
[1:40:40] up he called me on the phone I'm willing
[1:40:41] to fly up to Akron from Texas to be
[1:40:43] baptized by you I said first let me see
[1:40:46] if I know a preacher in Texas so I asked
[1:40:48] brother Scott Walker I said he used to
[1:40:50] go to brother David mcGarry's Church in
[1:40:52] Texas I said can I have that pastors
[1:40:54] number and Scott said of course so I
[1:40:56] shared that number with this preacher
[1:40:58] from Texas and he just sent me an email
[1:41:00] Monday he said praise the Lord
[1:41:01] I'm taking my whole family to brother
[1:41:02] mcGarry's Church he said I realized I
[1:41:05] not only need to be baptized in Jesus
[1:41:06] Christ name he said I need the baptism
[1:41:08] of the Holy Ghost amen I was gonna say
[1:41:13] thank you Lord amen
[1:41:14] praise God see now he's experienced in
[1:41:18] this he's starting to rise up against
[1:41:20] that denominational Pentecostal spirit
[1:41:22] and that that preachers seen faith
[1:41:23] muscles rise yeah Amen why because God
[1:41:29] doesn't back down to the devil
[1:41:31] hallelujah Jesus never back down to
[1:41:35] Satan he just stood there and stood with
[1:41:37] the Word of God amen
[1:41:38] and when he spoke the word demons had to
[1:41:40] flee hallelujah and we speak the word
[1:41:43] the demons will flee from the true
[1:41:44] believer well glory
[1:41:47] they were faith muscles and when
[1:41:50] do you know your faith is a strong when
[1:41:52] do you feel like you're the strongest
[1:41:53] when you're standing up against the
[1:41:54] devil don't you when you get a real
[1:41:58] scripture war with somebody don't you
[1:41:59] feel that's when you're the strongest
[1:42:00] when you're standing on God's Word your
[1:42:03] faith muscles or you're going through a
[1:42:05] test and something's tempting you and
[1:42:07] fight you finally turn that down and say
[1:42:09] no I'm gonna obey God's Word that's when
[1:42:11] you feel the strongest because you're
[1:42:13] looking that devil in the face and the
[1:42:15] Word of God will never be defeated
[1:42:16] praise God the Word of God will always
[1:42:19] make that that three corner club man the
[1:42:21] Shia way the faith will always grab that
[1:42:25] man by the collars that you listen to me
[1:42:26] this is what God word says glory that's
[1:42:32] what faith will always do well Graham
[1:42:34] says got hair on his chest
[1:42:35] it's the mature Christian faith is a
[1:42:38] mature Christian it knows what the Bible
[1:42:40] says amen so the outcome of that dream
[1:42:45] was that since God is with me and can
[1:42:48] give me such strength then let me stand
[1:42:50] up a stand up for her against the
[1:42:54] denominational power of the world and
[1:42:56] make him quit striking her in that
[1:42:59] beautiful praise God hallelujah I just
[1:43:07] got what see one I just got two more
[1:43:09] yeah so we're almost done let's stand
[1:43:11] here I'll have you stand now brother
[1:43:14] Graham says I'm not trying to build a
[1:43:16] doctrine upon a dream and there's my
[1:43:17] five minutes okay
[1:43:18] nor am i trying to vindicate any doctor
[1:43:21] and I stand for by a dream so see you
[1:43:24] never vindicate doctrine by dreams
[1:43:26] you've indicated doctrine by the Word of
[1:43:28] God amen oneness of the Godhead is all
[1:43:33] the way from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation
[1:43:35] 22:20 one the whole Bible but the people
[1:43:39] have been blinded by an unscriptural
[1:43:40] dogma of a trinity and that Dogma is so
[1:43:44] universally accepted that to try to see
[1:43:47] a one god person is all but impossible
[1:43:49] if people can't see the truth of the
[1:43:51] Godhead but they fight it they can't
[1:43:55] ever see the rest of the truth because
[1:43:59] the revelation isn't this beautiful I
[1:44:00] love this the Rev
[1:44:03] is Jesus Christ in his church and his
[1:44:07] works in the myths of the church for
[1:44:09] seven ages did you get that now I'm sure
[1:44:13] you understand it so go if you got your
[1:44:14] Bible go to Revelation 1 this is the
[1:44:18] whole entire revelation of Jesus
[1:44:36] it's revelation 113 this is what program
[1:44:39] said if you can't see that there's only
[1:44:41] one God there's one person you're gonna
[1:44:44] miss the entire church ages in that
[1:44:46] right it's exactly right you're never
[1:44:48] gonna know you're living in layer 2 see
[1:44:49] you're gonna think oh we're just know
[1:44:51] there's gonna be a great revival someday
[1:44:52] and all of America is gonna be saved you
[1:44:54] wouldn't believe how many friends had
[1:44:55] told me that in the last year I had
[1:44:57] three or four friends tell me always
[1:44:58] gonna be a great revival I'm like
[1:45:00] there's gonna be revival for the
[1:45:02] Antichrist that's the only revival other
[1:45:05] than the bride's revival glory
[1:45:07] hallelujah which we're part of right now
[1:45:11] but see the whole thing about the
[1:45:14] Godhead is revelation 1:13 that there's
[1:45:17] one God amen
[1:45:19] there's one person standing in our myths
[1:45:21] tonight amen
[1:45:22] it's not three persons it's one person
[1:45:25] amen it's Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:45:28] is here tonight to meet every need
[1:45:29] amen that's that's the reality that's
[1:45:32] there's not like I was telling this guy
[1:45:33] in the email there's not three Thrones
[1:45:35] in heaven there's one throne if there
[1:45:39] was three persons there'd have to be
[1:45:40] three Thrones because Jesus even says my
[1:45:42] Father's throne in my throne remember
[1:45:44] that I remember that jesus said it makes
[1:45:47] it sound like there's two Thrones but
[1:45:49] when you look in the Bible there's only
[1:45:50] one throne so what does it show it shows
[1:45:53] there's a throne that was for the
[1:45:55] invisible spirit but now the invisible
[1:45:57] spirit made a body lives in that spirit
[1:45:59] and that body sits on the throne amen
[1:46:02] hahaha but see the trinitarian get
[1:46:05] caught up and think oh there's two
[1:46:06] Thrones or three throws but you'll never
[1:46:08] find that in the Bible there's only one
[1:46:10] throne hallelujah hey man that was good
[1:46:13] thank you Jesus hey thank you lord
[1:46:16] revelation 1:13 let's all read together
[1:46:18] one two three and the myths of the seven
[1:46:22] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[1:46:25] Man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:46:27] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[1:46:29] golden girdle amen this is what I'm
[1:46:33] saying the whole point of Revelation is
[1:46:36] to see that Jesus Christ is in the midst
[1:46:39] of his church doing his works it's God
[1:46:43] in the midst of a church not a second
[1:46:45] person it's God with us amen
[1:46:49] it's God with us tonight hallelujah no
[1:46:51] matter how many people are here I don't
[1:46:52] care how many people here as long as
[1:46:54] Jesus is here amen that's all the
[1:46:56] matters amen
[1:46:56] and that we now never cared about
[1:46:58] numbers anyway all I care about is I
[1:47:01] have that one numbers here I want to be
[1:47:03] in that number the number of the Saints
[1:47:05] amen the number with Jesus Christ here
[1:47:07] amen that's all that's mattered praise
[1:47:09] God he said you get that now I'm sure
[1:47:12] you understand see this is what it's all
[1:47:13] about
[1:47:14] one person ministering to his church
[1:47:16] it's God last quote but Aram said
[1:47:20] hallelujah here's Jehovah the Old
[1:47:21] Testament the God of the amen
[1:47:24] here is Jesus of the New Testament the
[1:47:26] God of the amen here o Israel oh this is
[1:47:29] a food around me six for hear o Israel
[1:47:32] the Lord thy God is one God there it is
[1:47:34] again
[1:47:35] the Jehovah of the Old Testament is that
[1:47:36] Jesus of the new the New Testament does
[1:47:39] not reveal another God it is the further
[1:47:41] revelation of the one and same God
[1:47:45] Christ did not come down to make himself
[1:47:47] known he did not come to reveal the son
[1:47:50] he came to reveal and make known the
[1:47:52] father he never talked about two gods he
[1:47:57] never talked about two persons he said
[1:48:00] he talked about one God and now this
[1:48:02] last age now this is an interesting
[1:48:04] quote in this last age we have come back
[1:48:07] to the capstone revelation the most
[1:48:10] important revelation of Godhead in the
[1:48:13] whole Bible that Jesus is God he and the
[1:48:18] father are one there's one God and his
[1:48:21] name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that
[1:48:25] beautiful now some people say this is
[1:48:28] the most important revelation in the
[1:48:30] whole Bible and it might say that but
[1:48:33] it's kind of worded a little different
[1:48:34] they're the most important revelation of
[1:48:36] Godhead so I don't know if that changed
[1:48:39] it or not I'm just saying I don't know
[1:48:41] but let me say like this is it a major
[1:48:43] revelation yes
[1:48:45] it's a major revelation but I'm just
[1:48:48] saying some people preach it really hard
[1:48:49] one way some people preach another also
[1:48:53] I knows what the Bible said the Bible
[1:48:54] said it was one person in the midst of
[1:48:56] the seven candlesticks
[1:48:57] he said I'm Alpha I'm Omega the
[1:48:59] beginning the end I am the Lord God
[1:49:01] Almighty all's I know is the one
[1:49:03] person and you have to know that one
[1:49:04] person to understand the golden
[1:49:06] candlesticks understand if you know that
[1:49:08] one person now you know where you are
[1:49:10] you're in the seventh branch you're in
[1:49:12] Laodicea and you got to be an overcomer
[1:49:14] in your age and how you gonna overcome
[1:49:16] by the one who's standing with you Jesus
[1:49:18] Christ praise the Lord amen
[1:49:21] enjoy this tonight by God's grace oh my
[1:49:23] I was so beautiful this was so beautiful
[1:49:26] God is so beautiful let me click off
[1:49:28] here and make sure I think I finished
[1:49:29] that okay yeah so next time when we
[1:49:31] don't start the judgement of the false -
[1:49:33] I was ready to appreciate tonight so I
[1:49:35] got plenty more slides there I couldn't
[1:49:36] preach tonight I wanted to finish that
[1:49:38] one the open door how many thankful for
[1:49:41] the open door tonight oh thankful for
