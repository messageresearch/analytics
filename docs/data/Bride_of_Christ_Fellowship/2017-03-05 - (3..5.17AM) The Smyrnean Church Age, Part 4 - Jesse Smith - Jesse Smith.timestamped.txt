[36:01] how many happy to be the house of Lord
[36:03] today thank you sir that's you buddy
[36:05] thank you please go let's look at this
[36:09] thought and we look at the aspect of
[36:11] finances today you know with that
[36:13] thought about poverty so we're look at
[36:15] that and Malachi when you're ready we
[36:17] can switch over here by the grace of the
[36:20] Lord and I'll trust I'll be a blessing
[36:22] to you
[36:27] set my watch for about an hour here and
[36:29] try to control myself by God's grace so
[36:39] let's look at this thought here uh also
[36:41] has update I'm working on the marriage
[36:43] and divorce video I'm about halfway done
[36:45] with that it probably about two or three
[36:46] parts I'm almost halfway done with part
[36:48] one and making a lot of feedback this
[36:51] week I've got numerous emails and phone
[36:53] calls i went from Illinois phone call
[36:55] yesterday and overseas me a lot of
[36:58] encouraging things about people being
[37:00] blessed by the video the teaching
[37:01] ministry and a pastor from South America
[37:04] or South Africa sent me an email saying
[37:07] oh this is really helping me in my
[37:08] little congregation I thought well thank
[37:10] you Jesus you know this want to be
[37:12] faithful to the little gifts and talents
[37:13] you only places in each one of our lives
[37:15] you know sometimes I thought was strange
[37:17] why do you spend all this time on videos
[37:19] you know they're doing any good and then
[37:21] to hear that you know people say they'll
[37:23] never do this in again or they're
[37:24] they're they're they're convicted by
[37:26] this the sense of the Holy Spirit on the
[37:28] video I said praise the Lord of that you
[37:30] know there's a purpose behind it you
[37:32] know I think sometimes we just lose
[37:33] track of it you know so thank God for
[37:37] that I want to back up a little bit on
[37:40] what we looked at on us wednesday night
[37:44] okay so this is part four and i want to
[37:46] back up and look again at the the
[37:49] importance of the church age book i know
[37:52] i think sister Wendy told me she's now
[37:53] her to some series on the church ages
[37:56] pride three or four times Lester hard
[37:59] but it's really that important you could
[38:02] hear it three or four times and it's so
[38:04] crucial it's applicable to every every
[38:06] day of our lives because it tells the
[38:09] story of the church you know being
[38:11] prepared for the coming of the Lord it
[38:13] tells the story and hits the highlights
[38:15] and shows what they all go through by
[38:17] the grace of the Lord so let's look at
[38:20] Part for this morning by God's grace
[38:23] yeah now these are the quotes like I
[38:26] said from Wednesday brother BAM said
[38:29] these meetings were ordered the Lord in
[38:30] nineteen sixty he said he could have
[38:33] been out hunting or fishing or praying
[38:35] for the sick but he felt led to to
[38:37] preach these meetings so they were
[38:38] ordered of God I'm really there
[38:40] order to God so Graham said God place
[38:44] them upon my heart he said I don't get
[38:45] any extra money for preaching these so I
[38:48] thought you know God placed it on his
[38:49] heart to preach it as he placed it on
[38:51] your heart to read it I wonder about
[38:53] that so if you if you haven't started
[38:55] reading it I think I'll just trust the
[38:57] Holy Spirit will place it on your heart
[38:59] to read it and to go through it again by
[39:01] the grace of the Lord Ram said we're
[39:05] going to write in the yellow we're going
[39:06] to write a commentary on the seven
[39:07] churches is sent to all the world if we
[39:09] can because we're in the last days we're
[39:11] at the end time so I had a question was
[39:13] it sent to you it was sent to you praise
[39:16] God BAM said it never dawned upon my
[39:18] heart so much into the last election
[39:20] then I scene where we were at and that
[39:22] was the election of John Kennedy
[39:23] remember in he was nineteen sixty if i'm
[39:26] not mistaken and brother Ram so that's
[39:30] when I seen where we were at and the
[39:31] Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to
[39:32] warn the people and to place this so
[39:35] once brother BAM saw JFK elected he knew
[39:37] oh my the Roman Catholic Church is now
[39:39] controlling you getting control the
[39:40] United States that's exactly what
[39:42] happened in fact our Bible study on
[39:44] Tuesday night was really good and I
[39:45] brought that very point up there we were
[39:47] going through a the mark of the beast
[39:49] and how it's going to be unionized
[39:51] religion it's thus saith the Lord is
[39:53] going to be unionized religion you have
[39:55] to join some type of religious union and
[39:57] I just made that mention about how a
[40:02] revelation chapter 13 is the spirit of
[40:05] Rome and then the end of the chapter is
[40:07] the spirit of Rome in the United States
[40:09] and how to get the United States right
[40:11] here the founding fathers of the USA the
[40:14] pilgrims left Europe to escape the Roman
[40:17] Catholic Church and then they a few
[40:20] hundred years later they let the Roman
[40:21] Catholic Church back in and that's a
[40:23] shame because of the doctor in the Roman
[40:25] Catholic Church there might be sweet
[40:27] sincere people in there but their
[40:29] doctrines thoroughly wrong and it's the
[40:31] the the the doctrine is the cage of all
[40:33] unclean and hateful spirits the doctor
[40:36] now the people like I said my most of
[40:38] them are unaware of it they're ignorant
[40:39] of it but they got to come out of that
[40:42] by God's grace so we looked at that and
[40:46] then brother Branson for some time the
[40:48] Holy Spirit dead on my heart I couldn't
[40:49] shake away I had to go with it so he
[40:51] said I felt led to go to Jeff
[40:53] he'll write this book if i express this
[40:56] and it goes on riding after I'm gone the
[40:58] word will live on is it living in you it
[41:00] ought to be living in you praise God and
[41:02] he said in the name of Lord that's true
[41:04] i did not know all the revelations there
[41:06] in the seven church age book i'm going
[41:09] to skip ahead like I said minute this
[41:10] one over all this on Wednesday let's go
[41:12] quickly larrea I'm trying now to get a
[41:15] proof for it and make books out of it
[41:17] church ages seven books of the church
[41:18] age of seven tapes and make it such we
[41:20] can get it done as cheap as possible as
[41:22] we possibly can so everybody can get it
[41:25] now the Lord tarries and I move on
[41:27] you'll see that the things I've spoken
[41:29] name of Lord will be will be come to
[41:32] pass just as it was said never has
[41:33] failed yet and some of it has to happen
[41:35] later all right now program send the
[41:38] yellow you all seen in my book I like I
[41:40] call it my book it all be drawn out in
[41:43] the seven Church ages which he told me
[41:44] which I stand as a witness to God to be
[41:47] judged at that day of judgment for it it
[41:50] comes from God not from my thinking BAM
[41:54] said if you don't understand the church
[41:56] agency said wait till you get the book
[41:58] you'll understand it if you got any
[42:00] light in you at all immense there must
[42:02] be a magnificent light there must be a
[42:04] bunch of truth in this book praise God
[42:06] if you got any light in you you'll
[42:08] understand these mysteries these things
[42:10] these teachings now here's some new ones
[42:14] Ram said you have astounding picture
[42:17] here tonight that's going in that book
[42:18] of the three years how the Lord is let
[42:20] me draw it out on a blackboard and show
[42:22] just how the church ages would fail and
[42:24] when and how they would go up and down
[42:26] and as soon as the Lord finished that
[42:28] great angel Lorde that light just
[42:30] practically as many people standing here
[42:32] come right here the side wall standing
[42:33] here and people fainting and draw to
[42:35] ride out itself on the wall so he called
[42:39] this an astounding picture is that
[42:42] astound you this morning it ought to
[42:44] because this was the Holy Spirit that
[42:46] wrote this and he said this is a drew
[42:49] these pictures this was astounding
[42:51] because it shows us where we are we're
[42:53] at the last age 1906 we have just very
[42:56] little light left but the light we have
[42:58] is a beautiful light I'll tell you I
[43:00] enjoy walking in that light praise God
[43:02] amen it's a beautiful light there's a
[43:04] lot of light the beginning of the church
[43:06] ages when the church first
[43:07] are slowly got less and less and now
[43:09] we're another time a very very little
[43:11] light but there is still a true a true
[43:14] church of god today amen walk in the
[43:16] light the Prophet said in the future
[43:18] home in the past rather we study the
[43:20] seven seals of seven churches brother
[43:22] veil not working on those now faithfully
[43:24] to get them in book form so they're
[43:26] faithfully working on them have you
[43:28] faithfully read it that's what we're
[43:30] doing now that's why I feel led to
[43:31] preach it I know most people I probably
[43:33] haven't read it so I want to faithfully
[43:35] preach it by God's grace and the Prophet
[43:39] said back through these seven Church
[43:41] ages there were seven hidden gem or
[43:42] ministries I'm writing a book of it and
[43:45] he says in harvest time I'm writing a
[43:48] book my commentary on the first four
[43:50] chapters of Revelation hope to have out
[43:52] pretty soon to be a large book they have
[43:54] a brochure of each age now look here I
[43:57] like this one he said I got a special
[43:59] book coming out pretty soon the lord
[44:01] willing is special to you amen this
[44:04] layer to see the show it's already over
[44:05] that she's already sealed in there and
[44:07] Christ is on the outside amen a special
[44:11] book program tells here each of the
[44:14] messenger the age back to the word the
[44:16] message of their age the message of
[44:17] according to the Bible I've got coming a
[44:20] book out of that the commentary the
[44:22] first four chapters of Revelation read
[44:24] it soon as we get it unpressed and it
[44:26] proves beyond a shadow of a doubt what
[44:29] Luther's message was justification what
[44:30] sanctification is the next process is
[44:33] the natural birth and then come the
[44:34] Pentecostals exactly have your edit he
[44:37] said read it as soon as it comes out
[44:38] have you read it but I said I know
[44:42] you'll want to get them books because
[44:43] they answer a lot of questions that's
[44:45] been in your hearts praise God he said
[44:49] you all seen my book and we all draw it
[44:50] out in the seven churches which he told
[44:52] me which I stand by as a witness to God
[44:55] to be judged at the day of judgment for
[44:57] it come from God not for my thinking so
[45:01] the inspiration came from God shouldn't
[45:03] we endeavor to read it praise God so I
[45:06] want to say this on my notes I hope each
[45:08] believer feels a poll to read this book
[45:10] uh free copies are available to all like
[45:14] I was a mentioned a sister Naomi
[45:17] apologize if I haven't said that but all
[45:20] the books out there on the bookshelf
[45:21] all free other tracks the book sermon
[45:24] books program that's all free when it
[45:26] gets empty I'll fill back up by the
[45:27] grace of the Lord but that's for you
[45:29] that's for you to witness that's for you
[45:30] to enjoy take a book for yourself I've
[45:32] probably taken two or three these in the
[45:34] process of taking them I give them out
[45:35] to somebody that I get another one so
[45:37] that's what they're there for they're
[45:39] there for you to use it there for you to
[45:41] feed on by God's grace so I want to
[45:44] bring this as kind of like a check if
[45:46] you haven't read this book what books
[45:47] have you read that are more important
[45:50] than this book that God ordered and will
[45:52] help take away any shadow of doubt about
[45:54] the word all of our revelations this
[45:57] book will take away the shadow of a
[45:59] doubt about that what books have you
[46:01] been reading because your character is
[46:03] molded to whatever you want to read
[46:05] you'll become whatever you watch or
[46:07] whatever you read you know not everybody
[46:09] can read but God invented reading and
[46:11] languages for a purpose because reading
[46:12] slows you down and reading has been
[46:15] scientifically proven that's why they
[46:16] teach it at school so often of course
[46:18] readings are improving up to slow down
[46:22] your minds you have to really focus on
[46:23] that idea and that thought and you learn
[46:26] best by reading you can of course learn
[46:28] by watching but it's actually better to
[46:31] learn by reading as far as you can
[46:33] retain it longer but it's so critical so
[46:37] whatever you read or whatever you watch
[46:38] that's what you'll become rubberband
[46:40] tells us is that about Abraham Lincoln
[46:43] I'm gonna skip down here Abraham Lincoln
[46:45] grew up splitting rails he was really
[46:46] poor riding in the dirt and so forth and
[46:48] the only books I'm sorry par me and the
[46:51] only books that we believe Lincoln ever
[46:52] had until he was 21 years old was the
[46:54] Bible and Fox the book of martyrs and
[46:56] that's what molded that character he
[46:59] said let me see what you read let me go
[47:03] in your office in your house and see
[47:04] what you read and I'll tell you what you
[47:06] are it's quite a statement isn't it let
[47:10] me go watch let me go on your youtube
[47:11] history let me watch what you let me see
[47:13] what you watch and I'll tell you what
[47:15] you are praise God that's right see
[47:19] everything's with nature and you keep
[47:21] the Bible and look at this he tells the
[47:22] parents and the parents listen you keep
[47:24] the Bible laying close for your children
[47:26] read it yourself be an example so
[47:31] parents Romans last time you read the
[47:32] Bible in front of your children Oh
[47:35] this morning or hopefully last night my
[47:37] man tells it he said lay it close to you
[47:39] let your children see you reading the
[47:42] Bible that's what I didn't have in my
[47:44] younger life for the RAM said but by
[47:46] God's grace I want to put that before my
[47:48] children and if there's another
[47:49] generation may they put it before theirs
[47:51] as well remember all the revelations
[47:54] were thus saith the Lord I've gone this
[47:56] part now three sermons in a row the
[47:58] church changes plus the history plus the
[48:01] word all blend together and the
[48:03] revelation and the vision and
[48:04] interpretation is thus saith the Lord so
[48:07] we'd have to wonder about these things
[48:08] there thus saith the Lord now here's
[48:11] what I want to get some into some new
[48:12] quotes maybe you haven't thought about
[48:13] many conditions of each age are
[48:15] applicable for every age including our
[48:17] age for example by mam says what Christ
[48:21] was in the first age he is to all ages
[48:24] to every believer he's jesus christ the
[48:28] same yesterday today and forever what he
[48:30] did once he's still doing it will keep
[48:31] on doing i want to skip into this one
[48:34] now it says that the Spirit is speaking
[48:37] to the churches that is plural not
[48:38] singular the spirit did not have John
[48:40] write this down for a local Ephesian
[48:42] Church nor for the first age only it is
[48:46] for all church ages this is for all
[48:49] church ages let every age take heed for
[48:54] what is going on here is only the start
[48:55] that little tree that was plan is going
[48:57] to grow its going to grow through the
[48:59] ages and then this this then is a
[49:01] message for every Christian throughout
[49:03] every age until Jesus comes yes it is
[49:07] for the Spirit speaking now here's one
[49:11] example suffering we've been looking at
[49:12] this we look at this last Sunday and the
[49:15] Sun will be the Sunday before now this
[49:17] special condition of suffering in Samara
[49:19] must be applied to uh every age there's
[49:23] no age free from suffering we almost
[49:26] suffer as Christians there's no true
[49:28] believer free from it now remember like
[49:30] we said last Sunday God might commit you
[49:32] to suffer in a different way than me but
[49:33] we all will suffer for the name of Jesus
[49:35] Christ yours might look different than
[49:38] mine mine of course might be different
[49:40] from yours but we all will suffer no
[49:43] true believer is free from it this is of
[49:46] God this is the will of God it
[49:48] is needful we need the Lord to teach us
[49:51] the truth that we are to suffer and be
[49:54] christ-like and doing it if you don't
[49:58] have the grace to bite your lip and hard
[50:00] times are suffering then you need more
[50:01] grace a man they say like that when we
[50:05] go through suffering we're not to
[50:07] complain or not the murmur we're not to
[50:09] pity ourselves and say woe is me were to
[50:12] suffer with christ-like character love
[50:16] suffereth long and is kind the Bible
[50:18] says notice how organization breeds
[50:22] hatred now that goes in the same idea of
[50:24] bitterness as well it destroys
[50:26] fellowship it makes bitterness that's
[50:29] what mer means is what summer know was
[50:31] full of bitterness a root of bitterness
[50:32] the files many so more and more
[50:34] defilement was coming in every age would
[50:38] feel its cars so that bitterness that
[50:41] that hatred that's suffering see these
[50:44] are whatever happened the beginning we
[50:46] feel the effects of it today because
[50:49] that Antichrist spirit keeps moving and
[50:51] advancing but the Spirit of Christ keeps
[50:53] moves moving in advancing as well
[50:55] hallelujah so see we feel the effects of
[50:57] that sometimes does it can't you feel a
[50:59] little bitterness maybe in people's
[51:00] lives or how about your life ever feel a
[51:02] little bitterness in your life towards
[51:04] your your member in the church or our
[51:07] spouse or like even a few weeks ago we
[51:09] might feel bitter towards God you might
[51:11] feel bitter towards your family or some
[51:13] of your children or something but see
[51:14] that's leftover that's part of the
[51:16] experience of a Christian we've got to
[51:18] overcome bitterness amen now because all
[51:23] the trials are for every age as well so
[51:25] are the rewards for every age as well
[51:27] the Bible said to him that overcometh I
[51:30] grantee the tree of life and I'm
[51:32] skipping ahead this is the future reward
[51:33] to all overcomers of all ages hallelujah
[51:38] now i'm using this quote now from how
[51:41] can overcome now later sia that's the
[51:44] last church age there's going to be some
[51:46] overcomers in there watch here they
[51:48] remember each church age the one
[51:50] preceding it inherits all that the other
[51:53] ones offered I'm gonna believe that if
[51:56] you don't take that church age to help
[51:59] you right now it's really quite awful
[52:01] because
[52:02] and uh then only the first age gets the
[52:05] tree of life which is Christ only the
[52:08] second age is not heard of the second
[52:10] death which is what the lake of fire so
[52:13] see you must you must apply all the
[52:15] rewards to every age and you must apply
[52:17] all the trials to every age as well you
[52:21] experience some of them in a portion in
[52:24] every Church age praise God so those are
[52:29] all the rewards how many looking forward
[52:31] to the rewards of God the hidden manna
[52:33] the white stone with a new name the
[52:35] morning star which is Christ clothed in
[52:38] white raiment eternal life name not
[52:41] blotted out of the book of life name
[52:43] confessed before Jesus's father and his
[52:45] angels make him a pillar in the temple
[52:47] my god Christ right upon you his new
[52:51] name hallelujah and Ra Ra JH grant to
[52:55] sit with christ in his throne hallelujah
[52:59] how many looking forward to the rewards
[53:01] of God amen now those are all to every
[53:03] age if you overcome in your age you
[53:05] inherit all the others but what is its
[53:07] Christ sharing a portion revealing a
[53:10] portion of himself to every single
[53:12] Church age what every believer gets all
[53:14] of Christ amen hallelujah now let's go a
[53:17] little more here this morning i was
[53:19] praying i was asking God you know and I
[53:21] started saying this is my prayer cause I
[53:23] said lord if you could just prove to me
[53:26] that you love me by answering this
[53:27] prayer and then this quote came right to
[53:30] my mind I just preached it on Wednesday
[53:33] night how shall I prove my love to him
[53:36] I'm so I'm praying I lord if you could
[53:37] just answer this one prayer it would
[53:40] prove to me that you love me I've had to
[53:43] say forgive me Lord I just preach it on
[53:45] Wednesday how did how do you prove your
[53:48] love to God by believing what he said
[53:50] and by conducting myself with joy midst
[53:52] the trials that he has in his wisdom
[53:54] allows to come to pass now the quote i
[53:57] was thinking of I'm sorry was a
[53:59] different court wasn't this quote
[53:59] forgive me the other court I was
[54:01] thinking of was a different quote where
[54:03] brother have said how should we know
[54:04] that he loves us he said because of his
[54:06] love is elective love the very fact he's
[54:09] called us to the word shows he loves us
[54:12] because God says so for God so loved
[54:16] amen
[54:16] and while we were yet sinners Christ
[54:18] died for us he loved us first amen so
[54:21] there's actually the other quote but
[54:22] this is what I was what I want to get to
[54:24] how can I prove my love to Christ by
[54:27] being joyful and praising him and loving
[54:30] him in the midst of my trial that will
[54:33] prove to Christ that you love him amen
[54:36] in other words we don't get discouraged
[54:38] again we don't backbite we don't
[54:40] complain we don't feel have self-pity
[54:42] and feel sorry for ourselves and say woe
[54:44] is me we def joined the midst of our
[54:47] trial and know that it will work out for
[54:49] God's glory no here's one look at again
[54:52] I want to go on this thought of poverty
[54:55] and finances this morning it's come up
[54:57] on numerous levels as I've gone through
[54:59] out the last few weeks so I'm gonna look
[55:00] a little bit finances and money this
[55:02] morning by God's grace because Jesus
[55:04] says I know thy poverty but thou art
[55:08] rich he said there it is again see him
[55:11] walking up and down the midst of the
[55:13] church like a father he's looking down
[55:15] upon his family he's the head of the
[55:17] household he is the provider who sure
[55:19] who's your provider this morning is it
[55:21] uh is it copy fairlawn city schools like
[55:24] me who's your provider Jesus Christ is
[55:27] our provider he's the protector you
[55:31] might have a nice alarm system or you
[55:33] might have invisible fence or something
[55:34] like that that's not your real protector
[55:36] God's your protector yet Christ looks on
[55:41] at their poverty so there's a bunch of
[55:43] poor Christians in the Smyrna church age
[55:45] and Christ says I know your poverty and
[55:48] he lets them remain poor oh how the
[55:52] untutored believer stumbles at this and
[55:55] church I've talked to numerous people
[55:57] the last year's they stumble and God
[55:59] lets somebody suffer they stumble they
[56:01] say how could there be a holy God how
[56:03] could there be a holy God how could
[56:04] there not be a holy God how could there
[56:06] not be as a parent and you learn as a
[56:11] parent if you baby your children they're
[56:13] going to be a bunch of babies forever
[56:14] you've got some point now let them
[56:16] struggle and suffer and learn hard work
[56:19] and the benefits of of trial and error
[56:22] right they got to let them suffer and
[56:24] work hard like I learned you know that's
[56:27] why sports was a good teacher for me now
[56:29] isn't everybody
[56:30] but we learn like you don't win games by
[56:32] being a baby and being a win you got to
[56:35] work hard and put some effort into it or
[56:37] else the enemy is going to knock you
[56:39] over well that's a natural what about
[56:40] the spiritual if we don't learn how to
[56:43] pray and seek God and overcome the devil
[56:45] the devil is going to knock us out so
[56:48] God lets us go through trials so we'll
[56:50] learn to depend upon him amen how so see
[56:55] they they stumble at that how can God
[56:57] bear to look down upon his his own in a
[57:00] time of need and not just stop at all
[57:02] just give in and lavish everything
[57:05] material upon them how can God do that
[57:09] how can let God let Christians be poor
[57:10] how can God let Christians die well part
[57:14] of it is because it's a testimony for
[57:16] them right your testimony will be
[57:20] expressed all throughout eternity you'll
[57:22] be singing about the testimony remember
[57:24] the 144,000 are given a song in heaven
[57:27] that no one can sing accept them so your
[57:31] trials will produce a testimony that
[57:34] you'll sing all throughout eternity
[57:35] praise God Amen right and no man or no
[57:40] angel no person can learn the song to
[57:42] the 144,000 because their song goes
[57:45] something like this Amazing Grace how
[57:47] sweet the sound that saved a blinded you
[57:51] like me right I once was lost in
[57:55] blindness but now I'm found I'm sealed
[57:59] by the Holy Ghost I see something along
[58:02] those lines that's pretty silly silly my
[58:04] lyrics but you get it they have a song
[58:07] that they can sing that no one else can
[58:09] sing praise God and you've got to have
[58:12] tests and trials that you overcome so
[58:15] that you can have a testimony
