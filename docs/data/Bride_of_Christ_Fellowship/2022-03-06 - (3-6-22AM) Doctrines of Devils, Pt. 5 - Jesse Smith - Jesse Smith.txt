========================================

again today i believe it's part five and we're exposing doctrines of devils because the spirit of christ is the spirit of truth so we will have true doctrine while the enemy tries to pervert many churches with false doctrine we will hold the true doctrine of the faith praise god first timothy chapter 4 verse 1. while we're standing i won't take the word but uh we have brother bang here his birthday was on thursday let's give him a round of applause happy birthday brother [Applause] god bless your wife on her birthday today i imagine she's at home with the kids but uh we love you both and all your whole family and god richly bless you sir first timothy chapter four verse one let's just read this one together then we'll just have another short word of prayer and preach the word of god today let's read this on three if we can one two three now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make a known unto the lord the holy spirit is speaking expressly today as well hallelujah speaking clearly today the truth of god heavenly father we just love you today we worship you again lord we thank you god that you stood with us in every fire lord you stood with us in the waters lord as we have lord battles and we go through tests and trials you stand with us no matter where we are so we thank you lord you're the one who fights our battles hallelujah thank you for standing for us fighting for us lord god it's a privilege that you would stand by us lord god hallelujah we do not take that for granted lord god we thank you for the fountain filled with blood hallelujah that has washed away all of our sins hallelujah as we confess them lord god as we trust in you lord god you wash all sins away making us white making us clean hallelujah by the holy spirit so father take this little sermon today i pray you bless it to your people speak to every heart lord deal with the unspoken needs lord god deal with things i don't know just reveal the secrets and thoughts of every heart lord god i prayed and you'd make yourself manifest god that everyone could know here today that jesus christ is alive and he's speaking to each and every heart today father that they could say truly the lord is with you lord god grant it lord so bless us in your divine presence father as we uh lord come to our post of duty today to hear the word of god for faith comes by hearing hearing by the word so lord let our faith rise today as we hear the word in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god again it's gonna be in the house of lord today and thankful to have saints here and what a privilege to have two visitors jason and mario god bless you gentlemen so we'll start there in our scriptures with first timothy one verse four i usually show uh scriptures and quotes and and historical things and images you know it's just i think it's for me it's easier to learn you know when i have visuals i'm i guess a visual learner some people learn by working with their hands you know so they gotta write and draw and um so uh we'll just take what the holy spirit can give us today receive it be thankful with it and trust the lord to guide us more into all truth praise god so we looked at part four on wednesday we'll look at part 5 here today by the grace of god now we've looked at so far we've looked at three doctrines i'm sorry yes six doctrines of devils rather straight from the bible so paul said mandatory celibacy so when when a church forbids preachers from marrying that's a devil telling them to do that right the second one we looked at was uh it's mandatory vegetarian diet you can't eat meat any church that would mandate that that's a devilish doctrine right so see how satan likes to get into your diet he likes to get into your uh you know your uh your sexuality and he likes to pervert that right and he can pervert it in any way right whether it's celibacy or the opposite side whoredoms we'd say uh then of course he can pervert this and he can make it where you can eat anything and that's okay you can eat until you're uh until you're really unhealthy right and addicted to food well that's from the devil as well right so that's a doctrine of a devil as well saying the rapture's already passed that's a doctrine of a devil right some believe you know and and but some believe even around our kind of our sister churches that that we're living in the millennium but there's no quote you know as we said there's no quote for certain things and and so i'm not going to spend much time on that i've dealt with that in the past but i want to kind of move on and try to get to this thought here today uh the doctrine of the doubt another one a doctrine of a devil is there's no need to fast there's no need to give up food in order to be more spiritual there's no need for that that's that's a lie right uh the bible says that jesus says when the son of man is gone when the bridegroom is gone then my followers will fast so believers today people everyone in our church should fast sometime you should give up a meal and instead spend that time eating eating the word of god right praying uh studying listening to the scripture in other words having a spiritual meal rather than a natural meal that's that's scripture and if not people will worship their bellies the bible said they can worship their own bellies right so a person becomes an idol that they make themselves an idol right so that's a doctrine of a devil no need for fasting another doctrine of a devil is once saved you're always saved or everyone will go to heaven that's a doctrine of a devil because the bible said evil men crept in and they take they turn grace into lawlessness in other words oh you can do whatever you want it doesn't matter there's no there's no consequences to your actions if you said one prayer one time you're automatically saved forever and you can never lose that salvation well those people who never read it as uh exodus right those people never read uh revelation 3 verse 5 where jesus says i will blot out names if they don't overcome but we want to be the overcomers today praise god and last sunday we looked at this one where uh the liars will say god always wants you healthy and god always wants you wealthy right that's called the prosperity gospel and it does creep into the message it does creep in amongst our ranks uh but the bible says these are great swelling words of vanity they sound good they seem so people will clap and they'll enjoy it but behind it is is a falseness behind it is a reality like when you really live your life you're going to find sometimes god doesn't make you wealthy you're going to find sometimes god doesn't always heal you when you want to be healed you find that and you find in the bible god has chosen the poor of this world amen god chooses many times poor people in order to show that they're rich in faith amen hallelujah usually usually not always but usually the more money people get the less spiritual they are because they trust in uncertain riches rather than the living god amen so we should look at our lives and and we should no matter how much money we should get if we get more money that means there's more god wants us to give away praise god hallelujah amen or provide for your children amen or provide for a need that you know of get a car if you need one praise god now you can go to church amen or get a car so you can go help the poor feed the poor something like that there's a purpose for a car but it's not to be worshipped like we were just driving to church today and some some mustang drove out in front of us and its license plate said uh said goaded like this this car was a goat like the greatest of all time that person is truly worshiping their car right and it's got like camouflage on it it looks like it's just you know that's a worship i mean that money could have been better spent just buying a humble car and then helping out a poor person right or helping out a church you know but they're calling their car the greatest of all time that kind of goes with what we're going to preach today too how uh there's a lie saying we're the greatest believers of all time that's going around today that's a lie we don't want to make ourselves greater than anybody we just want to we want to make ourselves more humble praise god now and then we showed last week how paul even paul says jesus heal me and jesus said i'm not going to heal you this time he said my grace is sufficient for you this time i need to keep you humble so i'm not going to heal you this time so that proves it's not always god's will to make you healthy or wealthy how many would how many would still serve god even if he doesn't make you healthy or wealthy it's kind of like that a marriage vow right for richer or poor from from from from richer or poor from good health to bad health in other words i'm married to christ amen christ is our husband and we serve him no matter what he allows to come to pass we believe him we trust him and we know the greatest gift he could give us is not health or wealth but forgiveness of sins amen amen hallelujah the greatest gift he could give us was to wipe away all of our sins think about it all of our lives all of our lustful thoughts all of our evil actions all of our our stealing all of our blessing the greatest gift he could give us is to remember that no more and wash it away through the blood of the sacrifice amen that's the greatest gift we could be given today hallelujah god might make you healthy he might make you wealthy praise god but that is not always a sign that god is with you not always and that's a doctrine of a devil so again there's a lot of churches around us you know that they use great swelling words the bible and peter said this peter foretold this as a prophet when they shall speak great swelling words of vanity so the words just these claims are such big claims but they're empty claims in other words the bible really doesn't support their claim it's an empty vain promise it's a big promise like god's going to always make you healthy god's always going to make you wealthy that's a big big fat promise right a big huge promise right and it but it's a lie it's it's not the reality of the word of god and so what are they doing they're they're uh deceiving people through the lusts of the flesh right because your flesh wants cars your flesh wants money right your flesh wants to be healthy all the time your flesh doesn't like to be sick right but they use these great swelling lies in order to lure people in with these great big swelling lies and through much uh wantedness i believe that's laziness i'm not mistaken those that were clean escaped from them who live in air okay so they're luring them in now and they promised them liberty which is freedom they promised them freedom oh you're going to be healthy so wealthy and uh but yet the the bible says they themselves are servants of corruption so in other words look at the preacher's life and look and see what does the preacher serve does he serve himself or does he serve the lord jesus christ amen that's how you test these preachers whether on tv or on your podcast or on youtube or wherever they are test them by their fruit look at their life how do they live their life praise god amen and through that you'll know if they're preaching the truth or not hallelujah because they themselves many times many times these people that make these big swelling words they're servants to some form of corruption whether it's uh you know sexual immorality or money greed for money or greed for popularity praise god and for us we don't care you know we put these sermons on youtube but i don't care if they have five views or 500 as long as the right person hears the word that sets them free amen hallelujah it's not about the numbers it's not about the popularity it's about god's predestined word finding a place it can fall upon amen hallelujah it's about god directing his word amen that's why we do it that's why brother rahm loved uh now brother brown for our visitors brother brown was a prophet in the 20th century who died he died about 56 years ago okay but that's why brother ram liked brother neville's radio program because he said he said what a great message i heard brother neville preach he was the pastor of branham tabernacle he said that's a message i think everybody needs to hear he said a very fitting message for the day that we're living in praise god see brother man new you know and every any real person honest knows any honest person knows just preach the word and god will direct that word in other words don't be afraid to preach the word don't be afraid to share what god has done for you testify and if you're not a preacher testify about what god has done amen don't be afraid god will direct it it'll reach the right person somebody will hear that it'll be a blessing to them it'll help somebody and that's why we're here to spread god's word to spread the seed of god and god's word will produce of its own kind amen hallelujah that's why we're here to spread the truth to be the light to be the saul all these different illustrations we're the salt of the earth we're the light of the earth amen we're the true seed of the earth amen hallelujah we produce the fruit of the holy spirit praise god we're here so people can see real fruit that's a real christian life hallelujah amen thank god that there's real believers today thank god you're one of them hallelujah thank god i'm one of them even thank god that we can you live a real christian life hallelujah and not be a so-called christian life with great lying words of vanity and that's what i you know i i have to examine myself do i make promises yes i promise you if you repent you'll be forgiven if you repent and get baptized in the name of lord jesus christ that's my promise you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but that's upon condition praise god that's upon the fact that you meet the conditions of the word of god hallelujah and the best part is we've seen people receive it amen we've seen god back up it's not really our promises but we're promising you that god will keep his word and your your individual walk may be a little different there's variations but we all must come the same way through repentance justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost amen so thank god that we make promises from the word and god keeps his promises hallelujah now there's a great i believe this i believe there's a great doctrine that's deceiving and uh let me i just want to say this really uh cautiously yeah i believe there's a doctrine of a devil that presumes everybody say presumes that means that you make an assumption that brother branham and his followers are the greatest of all time let me say this brother brown may be the greatest preacher of all time he may be but that is not up to us to decide that's up to christ and if i could be a little more specific that's up to the father amen who will show christ amen he could be but i just believe i'm never going to ever tell you you are the greatest people of all time i'm never gonna say that because i don't believe we have a scriptural place for that according to these verses now for our visitors uh uh jason and mario let me just i just put a few together up here uh once i knew you guys were here um i just want to introduce you a little bit to the ministry of william branham he died in 1965 right but we believe he was the last messenger to the church so if you study church history paul was like the first major prophet to the church he wrote most of the new testament right now after him a couple hundred years was iranius a mighty man of god and all these i mean we preached sermons on these guys lives these guys lives were totally supernatural right now we're not worshiping these guys but we're just recognizing they had real faith in christ right paul iranius a martin a powerful man he was saint patrick's uncle st patrick was not a catholic although some people will tell you that he was not a catholic in fact we believe the roman catholic church is the archenemy of the church we believe that now we still love the people inside the church we love them but we're trying to tell them come out come out of that false religious system and so he was of course mighty man of god columba mighty missionary in fact uh during the dark ages it was because of his work that the gospel could go on because satan had such a grasp on humanity where uh the dark ages they didn't have you know education they didn't and the worst part was they didn't have the bible amen many people didn't have the bible but through his work god kept the the truth alive during the dark ages and then you brothers probably know martin luther during the reformation he brought up the great revelation that just shall live by faith now yes he had all these guys had the baptism of the holy ghost but there each one had a main message that they had to preach right paul's was his gospel from jesus christ to give us the bible and every man will be judged by what paul wrote in the bible that's what jesus said hallelujah now 100 years after him or so maybe 100 well almost 200 maybe was john wesley and he preached sanctification that's where the methodist church comes out of that okay mighty man of god preacher he was 88 years old and he he had as much strength when he was 88 as he did at 20 praise god that's what his testimony was and then brother branham came uh after the zuzu street revival of 1906 and he came and had just a mighty mighty ministry that's his second wife his first wife died and so he married again that sister mita um but it's just a video i made uh but it's just a picture of a nice nice close-up picture by the way and his wife there and he was human of course he was human you know he's just like all of us right but a prophetic gift okay i just want to show this picture real quick so brother here's brother brown just a real small five foot three man right but what what made him special was that they would bring up strangers to him and he he would say well wait a moment here and he would lean back and then he would see visions and then tell the people what he saw in the visions and they would every time they would say that's right that's exactly and they would weep and cry or praise god this man wanted the holy ghost phil revival and brother man said uh he said you're up here you're not for yourself he said you're not sick he said you want an old-fashioned holy ghost revival the man goes like this he goes oh hallelujah amen and that's called discernment of spirit that was brother bam's gift he had a gift of discernment and that's the ability to know the thoughts and secrets of the heart jesus christ had that same gift in fact every prophet had that gift elijah knew what was going on in the king of syria's bed chambers amen because the lord showed him what was going on jesus had that gift he told that woman at the well uh yeah the man you're living with now is not your husband you've had five other ones and she said i perceive you're a prophet see because she knew only a prophet knows these things because a prophet has a gift to know that amen now he had a worldwide undeniable healing and discernment ministry started in 1946 if i'm not mistaken i could be wrong by one year on that it started a worldwide revival healing and he spoke over 30 thus saith the lord times and anyone that reads the bible knows a prophet will say in the name of the lord or this is thus saith the lord amen so he and then he has numerous fulfilled prophecies as a son of man and he also fulfilled the bible mysteries according to revelation 10 verse 7 and according to malachi 4 verse 6 he turned the hearts of us back to the bible in other words brother brahm just he lived he pointed here he died but we're still looking here amen hallelujah amen thank god we thank god for the the ministry of brother iran we thank god for iranians and and all these men of god luther wesley we thank god but they've all done one thing they've all pointed to jesus christ amen hallelujah they did not point to themselves they pointed to christ amen hallelujah now i've not met this woman i think she's still alive but i did meet this woman in other words in 1953 this woman met brother branham she was 26 years old it's on tape we got it on tape and brother man said you're not from here he says you're from a wooded area he said it's denver colorado and the reason you're here he said you have a female trouble you can't have a baby he said thus saith the lord go home you're gonna have a baby but it took 10 years that's the part people don't realize sometimes god will speak something to you but it's going to take a while just trust in the lord amen trust in the lord with all your heart lean not upon your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct thy past amen she's a worldwide famous preacher now brother ram didn't even believe in women preachers but he prayed for her anyway because he loved he loved god he loved all god's all god's creation right and that's on tape you can listen we listened that yesterday didn't we no we listened to it on saturday yeah you malachi and i listen to it on saturday now this sister passed away in 2013. but this was on tape as well in 1955 brother ram said you've got tuberculosis she had tuberculosis she only had three kids at that time and he said you're dying he said uh in the name of jesus christ i rebuked satan he said and you're healed he said i charge satan to leave you in jesus christ's name he said to let you know i told you the truth he said go weigh yourself monday and then the next monday and you'll see what i've told you is the truth hallelujah and that's exactly what happened she went from skinny and dying like a just like a a bunch of bones with skin on him like a thin woman she went that to a healthy woman had four more kids amen i think when she died she had 30 grandchildren and 50 great-grandchildren if i'm not mistaken amen and i met her but she said i always say this because it made me happy she said you preached just like brother branham now she could have been being nice or something like that but it just encouraged me hey man and her family went to brother brown's church for many years at least five years they went to brother church because they lived you know north carolina but they would then they drive up to jeffersonville now he was fully human though brother branham he died by a car accident now we don't know why but he died by a car accident died he had injuries and he died a few days after the car accident uh many cults have risen up but that's scriptural and i'm not i'm just going to move on past that because i went through that and that's a pretty good introduction i want the brothers to see the uh those supernatural powerful things praise god and now we'll get to the word of god here a little more all right so that's a good start there by god's grace now okay not for far enough here we go okay so we went through uh those six that's those these are doctrines of devils that we've looked at and preached on now uh the the seventh one is the i believe it's i believe it's of the devil to just assume without any bible proof or authority that brother brahm is the greatest person that ever lived outside of jesus and you and we are greater than every other person that ever lived in the history of the world i believe that's i believe that's a sin because i don't have there's no bible evidence for that now i want to just show this too and then the eighth one maybe we'll get to this today but some people say rapturing faith is literally on the the sermon recordings of brother branham literally but it's not it's it's it's in heaven praise god and let me just get to this rook briefly where was enoch's rapturing faith was it on a piece of stone or was it in heaven praise god let me just give you that one how about elijah's faith was that on plastic somewhere was that on a stone somewhere was that on paper somewhere it's going to be the same faith brother van amen the same faith that took up enoch and elijah is one day going to take up the bride of jesus christ amen it's not a different faith it's the same rapturing faith hallelujah and i'll say it like this it'll be a gift from god amen as long as you're born again as long as you've repented and sanctified filled with the holy ghost god will bring you to it because it's about god fulfilling his word amen it's about god's word not coming to not not not being void but god's word must be fulfilled in his time and season hallelujah now here's why i i read this recently and uh of a false church said it's the greatest age of all time not even i don't even know how you can prove that i don't even i can't even say it's the greatest age of all time how can we say our age is greater than paul's age like my wife my wife brought that quote to me brother man was talking about the four anointings remember the four anointings on the church and brother brown even said it how can you do anything except god the anointing god gives you we have the ego anointing but it's not that we earned it it's just god ordained there has to become an ego anointing that watches and prays amen hallelujah that watches and prays and that anointing of the holy ghost will take us up in the rapture hallelujah because eagles fly high amen and the bride of christ will fly high to meet christ in the air but how is that any good does the bible ever say that's the greater anointing than the line anointing i don't think so does it does the bible ever say the ox anointing is any less than the line anointing or is it the same holy spirit just with different attributes to meet the challenge of the hour that's a loud thing amen hallelujah and they want to say brother ram is the greatest messenger of all time but there's no evidence for that i found another quote yesterday from the same website where it said brother ram was the greatest prophet of all time of all time now to me that's a presumption and the proof of that and then then it says and then that that pastor is telling their church you're the greatest christians of all time can you imagine that that's what we ended with on uh wednesday night remember we went through hebrews 11. brother brahm said judge your testimony next to theirs they were cut with saws and divided put your testimony up to theirs they wandered around in goat skins and sheepskins put your testimony up to theirs i mean church if we're honest we'll feel about this big next to theirs now don't forget this too there's a spiritual reality though to the new testament because jesus said he that's least in the kingdom is still greater than john the baptist he said john the baptist was greater than all the prophets before him well there we go right there there's mine he said but still he's least in the kingdom now that's something right there that's quicken to me right there okay hallelujah okay so how how could you and i be greater than john the baptist it's not by our works but it's by the season that god is working in the only way we can be greater is if there's a greater sacrifice to cover our sins and that is that's the reason why anyone anyone in the new testament will be greater because we're not under bulls and goats and all these sacrifices we're under the lamb of god jesus christ it's a better covenant with better promises amen in other words like compare yourself with david david's through a giant we've never done that but david fell to adultery and if you and i don't fall to that then we slay the giant of adultery amen and that's something he couldn't do because he didn't have the power amen he didn't have the access to it but we have access to more power because we have the life of jesus christ here amen hallelujah now just with that thought now i could see how you might say brother branham would be the greatest of the prophets because if john was the greatest at the end of the of the covenant maybe brother branham would be the greatest but i personally don't feel i have the authority to say that you know why because jesus christ himself wouldn't say who was the greatest and if you can say who's greatest and jesus can't well now you've just made yourself greater than jesus they asked remember that mother came up and said jesus can james sit on one side and can john sit on the other side i love you jesus you know i'm sure she was a happy mom you know she really wanted her children to be really really uh uh honored you know she loved her children but jesus said you shall and drink in need of my cup and be baptized with the baptism i'm baptized with but to sit on my right hand think about that sitting right next to jesus and on my left is not mine to give so jesus says this is not my responsibility i can't say who's the greatest and who's not he said but it shall be given to them for who is prepared of my father and the church said amen now if you go to revelation chapter 4 there's one throne jesus sits on it and there's 24 thrones around it and we know who those are those are the 12 original sons of jacob and the 12 apostles minus judas and we believe paul was placed in there because he said i was one born out of season and he said i labored more than all of them but the grace of god not me but the grace of god that was in me okay so just looking at that picture we could say the greatest of any of them would probably be the apostles because jesus told the apostles you will rule over the 12 tribes of israel now we're getting there now we're getting down there amen hallelujah is that helpful by god's grace hope that's a help by the grace of the lord but to presume and say that you know and jesus didn't tell us that we can get pretty close to the spot of it but if jesus didn't tell us we can't exalt ourselves above jesus and and make it seem like we know something and this man believes he's a prophet we're saying that brother adam's the greatest of all time and that the people is the greatest of all time he exalts himself as a prophet so we see we have to be very careful what we believe amen now let me tell you this we dare not everybody say dare not don't even try it paul said dare not make ourselves of that number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves so paul noticed in court there were some people that just commended and complimented themselves he says they're comparing themselves among themselves making one better one less he said therefore they are not wise isn't that doesn't that sound like jesus disciples they're arguing who's i'm the greatest one no no i'm the greatest one no no no i'm the greatest one come on i'm peter i you know i'm not saying he was arguing that but some of them were paul says don't you dare start saying well i know brother so-and-so is greater than sister so-and-so he said don't you because uh this person did this and that he said don't compare yourselves to nobody but christ because paul says it becomes a boasting see they're bragging it's pride amen and to say that we're greater than other ages i think that's a brag i think that's a boast because even jesus wouldn't say who was the who's the greatest ones he said that's up to the father he said but according to the measure of the rule which god has distributed us a measure to reach even unto you so we don't dare to do this he said it's foolish so that reminds us that's a foolish virgin thing to do and just like you know recently i told you about this certain preachers in the message they're wonderful brothers i personally believe they're born again but they go around calling themselves generals like i'm a general in god's army where the bible ever say to go around and tell you call yourself a general right here it says don't compare yourselves and i got i've made i caught video of them saying we and they're also in the background and the preacher says these are the most powerful preachers on earth well how do they know that see that i just feel like don't you get the sense that many times people just if they're not careful if they can't get tempted by the devil with lust of the flesh less of the eyes he's probably going to get him with the pride of life if they don't remain humble because those are the three areas you can be tested in lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life and the very man that said that one of the very men that said that i'm a general he actually called himself a general i'm coming in to save pray for somebody so they'll not die that very person died two days later and he had said god's going to heal him now they didn't say they'll say the lord but look at the pride of that look at the look at the presumption that's what we're getting to today amen presuming people presuming they're general people presuming they're great presuming that they're they're comparing we should not be caring about who's greater we should be caring about those that are sick and don't have food and help them out amen that's what we should care about praise god amen just you know i got two bags out there for you buddy i brought those bags and for anybody else too anybody else too see they're worrying about who's greater rather than worrying about who needs today where are the needs today who can i help out who can i serve today amen they want to be rulers instead of servants amen hallelujah that's the truth hallelujah i'm getting some fiery indignation amen that's true they want to be served rather than serve others amen now there's eight verses on this we're not going to take the time but if you want them let me know i can screenshot this sometimes jose asked me for the notes i could send this to your brother there's one two three four five six seven eight scriptures that say we are not to compare ourselves with one another because that becomes prideful we're to look at ourselves humbly and say well i'm a sinner saved by grace yes i'm more than a conqueror when anointing is on me but let me see how humble i can be instead of how prideful i can be praise god it's all over the bible paul wrote it on numerous gate paul wrote it one that we read two three four four times paul wrote about it and solomon an otherwise man with a gift of discernment there wrote it two three times as well luke wrote about it and joe wrote about it let's not worry about who's the greatest let's worry about jesus christ amen let's focus that he's the greatest see i believe that's the spirit of pride that gets into churches because they're they're not learning anything new so they got to bring up all this old stuff you know and then and try to pridefully exalt themselves one above another that's just my that's the way i can understand it now notice paul paul was i believe paul was likely one of the greatest if not the greatest because his gospel was the judgment standard yet he considered himself the least and that's how you know a real humble person no matter what responsibility what gifts they have what testimonies they'll always consider themselves as nothing and the church said amen paul paul raised the dead he had thrown a viper in the fire and he still says i am the least of all of them he now looks he said i'm one of them so don't don't deny your office god gave you amen hallelujah don't deny the gifts you got be faithful with them amen but say i'm the least of all of them hallelujah now why did he why did he why do you think this because at one time before he was saved he persecuted the church of god so he looked at his past and said my past has made me the least but the bible also says he that's forgiven much loveth much amen hallelujah so to me i believe paul was being very humble and i believe because of that humility god will exalt him high he's at least one of the top 12 that's in my at least my humble opinion right now but then also i know we have thrones but then also the stars in his hand that's the seven church age messenger so how does that work do they get thrones i don't know i didn't see seven thrones in the bible but we could learn more and there may be there'll definitely be some surprises when we get there praise god so see i'm not we're just we just don't want to presume and we don't want to get a prideful spirit upon us we want a humble spirit upon us amen but by the grace of god i am what i am his grace was bestowed upon me was not in vain amen but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god that was given to me we must have holy ghost humility um and i i need to say that i'm the least of the preachers in the message i'm the very least i want to believe that and i want to act like that i want to i want to be humble like that i still want to recognize the gifts he given me and that i want to say the gifts he give me i want to labor in those gifts i want to be faithful with those gifts and then i'll leave everything up to him because it don't matter who's the greatest i just want to be faithful with what he gave me praise god now here's one something i got an email on wednesday night someone was streaming the service not from our church but another church and they said that's really important that you preach that we have to preach against cult behaviors because really a cult is just a denomination really when you think about it right everybody hears caught and they go ugh but really that's all it is this is domination right we are not a cult we're the body of jesus christ hallelujah now the world will no doubt the world will always look at real believers and call them a cult they call paul a sect of the nazarenes right they called paul a cult leader so sinners will always call us cult leaders but that's not true what the way they call heresy is the way we worship but it's not heresy it's the right way amen now here's four behaviors of a cult and we're gonna look at each one of them there's the reference that might make you laugh but that's where i got it from the reference the people that we debated a couple years ago which they're nice people fine people i'm still making a video for them i just haven't got to there's just so much there's just so much to do so little time but summer's coming by god's grace someone's coming i don't think they're gonna expand the school year into the summer i hope not by god's grace uh let's look at the first two one one nature of a cult is to make them close-minded they're not interested in a rational evaluation of the facts in other words they won't look at any facts they're just going to believe what they want to believe what they've been taught the church let me say this jesus was not afraid of questions he wasn't afraid to hear other people's opinions amen why because he had the truth amen like i heard that brother say it's right he said if you have gold you're not afraid to put that in the fire amen because you know that'll only refine it more amen hallelujah we're not afraid to test our beliefs i'm not afraid to get an email or call or anyone to stand by i've already said that come stand by me with the bible show me where i'm wrong amen and if i'm wrong i'll say praise the lord that'll help me be a little more gold-like that'll purify my gold purity or my my percentage of gold amen hallelujah but a cult says don't listen to anything except what we say that's not what jesus said remember jesus even told them they were under the law jesus said you that been healed he said now go obey moses's commands and go offer your sacrifice remember jesus said go do what the pharisees tell you to do that's in the word he said but don't be like unto them hypocrites so we're not afraid of questions now church will i have all the answers no don't ever think of it because i'm not god but we'll wait upon the lord we'll pray about it we'll search the scripture scripture we'll give you the best answer we can by the grace of god we have the holy spirit of truth not afraid of any question we o the bible says prove all things so i preached here what we've had our church almost 16 years we've tried to prove everything we believe by the word of god and the church members said amen we devoted our lives to that praise god peter said always have an answer for the hope that you have within us always but see cults they don't want to give answers they don't they can't take any questions that make them nervous see we're not a cult hallelujah the bible says search they search the scriptures daily in acts 17 11. and church we can read other sources like a quote will tell you don't listen to anything like a cult today would say don't listen to anything except joseph smith that's what the mormons would say now for people like us they say don't listen to anything but brother branham but brother ham never told us to do that the bible doesn't tell us to do that hallelujah the bible tells preachers study yourself to prove unto god a workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth amen that means a preacher is going to read things that some things that don't have truth in it so they got to rightly divide it they got to take the truth out and leave what's not the truth amen and we almost do that every day praise god like when i wrote my book about the seven church ages i used a man named broadband edmond broadbent he's a wonderful historian i use his work but what if i said i can't read anything but the message well i would have left i would have missed out on a lot of great historical facts right remember that time you heard on the radio brother remember how they helped you see that's what i love about god if you're just looking for truth god will send it to you some in some way it makes you love god more amen now of course we know most preachers that don't follow william branham yeah they're not going to have all the truth but they can still have some truth to help us out and i don't encourage i don't encourage you to listen to other preachers outside the message very much i would say very rarely because you got to be careful what they're trying to draw you into like like the bible just said remember they allure you but just hearing one sermon isn't going to kill you right unless you worship unless there's a deception on there and you worship that you've got to be careful but if you have the holy ghost you might just listen a little bit but then you get back to what's right amen might have to answer a question but then get right back to the truth amen listen to your pastor listen to god's prophet amen listen to men that you know really believe the word of god hallelujah we're not scared of things outside the bible i can learn i've learned many things from outside the bible but i've always brought it back and saw yeah that agrees with what the bible says amen here's the second thing blind obedience to authority the dogma of leader or founder is supreme now in other words the the lie about this is i believe everything on the tapes and i everything brother ram said i believe it that's such a lie that's blind following that's it's a lie it's dishonest and they know it they're lying through their teeth but we prove all things by the bible in other words the bible the holy ghost is our authority as he points us to the bible amen we're not blindly just following everything brother brahm said brother brahma said prove what i said in the bible he said if you have a teaching it's got to go from genesis all the way to revelation then you know it's the truth amen we follow brother iran's teachings because their bible not his human opinions hopes wishes etc the word only is infallible which includes bible teaching and thus ate the lord declarations praise god now if you if you find something in brotherham's sermons and doesn't make sense that you just want to set it on the shelf that's fine right and if you want to take his opinion that's fine too what we're saying is don't exalt everything don't worship a man worship no man worship christ only amen see it's such a delicate balance but anybody that knows uh truth anybody that has an honest and good heart will understand what i'm saying praise god if you have an honest and good heart hallelujah a cult brings you into fear and brings you to slavery but real religion makes you free from that real holy ghost religion makes you free in christ jesus amen you don't live by fear what's the preacher going to say what's my brother gonna say what's the message you don't live by fear you live by faith amen hallelujah and you're honest if you made a mistake i i care what they say if i make a mistake i'll repent but if i'm right i don't care if i get criticized i'll overcome amen a soft answer will turn away wrath hallelujah glory now i'm going to file it from wednesday faith had a really good question uh we were talking we're talking about how we follow brother man's message well the the real and this scripture came to me yesterday when i was studying sister faith so this is just for you from the lord amen we follow the faith of believers and that's what the bible says in other words we follow their obedience to the word of god we don't follow all their sins we don't follow all their hopes and opinions and ideas we follow their faith glory faith is assurance faith is a revelation of the will of god so when we say we follow brother abraham we follow the faith that he point us to the word of god amen just like paul said follow me as i follow christ amen that's what the bible says the lord is my helper i will not fear what man shall do to me remember them which have the rule over you so he's talking about preachers because preachers rule by the word the word rules not a man but the word who have spoken unto you the word of god see anyone who speaks the word of god to you that word is ruling over your life and the bible said whose faith follow so if you're a part of this church you should look at my faith and see well i see the good things he does i'm going to follow that don't follow the bad things i do because you're going to find yourself in a bad place learn from my mistakes because i'm going to make mistakes but see where you see look where you see the holy spirit moving in my life and then follow that and i'll say it like this follow your brothers and sisters faith too but god has given us leaders and the bible says follow their faith considering the end of their conversation look at what is the final product of their life the final product of their life should be holiness righteousness a love for god a love for truth follow that faith that produces peace amen amen hallelujah and what does he say after this that's jesus christ this pattern is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever follow the faith of the saints who live the gospel before you now here's three and four i i had to uh shrink down one and two or else that list just evaporates or whatever happens and it goes back to one and two uh as you know if you work with word documents uh the third one is colts control every detail of your life it's dictated by the preacher now that's wrong the bible preaches to us to seek god first so everybody should be putting god first in their lives and then the holy ghost will give us wisdom that orders all the rest of the events of our lives and decisions like there was a there's a brother a good brother a preacher he's alive today he said there was a man in his church one time he said brother a preacher so-and-so if you could just follow me around all day he said i could live a victorious life i wouldn't go to the cigarettes i wouldn't go to the alcohol i wouldn't go to the women and he said that would do you no good because then i would be your strength he said what you need is to repent get baptized and fill with the holy ghost so the holy ghost not follows you around but leads you around ahead hallelujah because he said the holy ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth amen i guess the testament was the brother did get the holy ghost and he didn't need the pastor to follow him around all day that's why the holy ghost was sent to us to lead us amen now if you have a question church i'll give you the best wisdom but the decision is up to you right i'll give you my best thought but ultimately you're responsible for your decisions i'm responsible for telling you the truth but you and i and i myself i'm responsible for the decisions i make i'm not going to give you selfish mandates like some examples there's this pastor in minnesota and i'm not going to call his name although he's a really wicked man but he he he's told people that are married divorced and i mean you can marry that one and you can marry that one he said don't buy this car he said go buy that car i mean that's just too much that's just overboard way overboard oh the one guy he said oh never have youtube i never have it now if you're struggling with youtube get rid of it but he says you can never do youtube he mandates all these details in people's lives that's a cult that's not the holy spirit leader that's a man leading and those people will never move on with god until they repent and get the holy ghost and really have a leader now someone to direct them so that they can say wow god is really guiding my life he's guiding me to holiness hallelujah and the fourth and final was they despise people outside their church this is why we got to love our enemies amen they have no tolerance for any belief system other than their own now church we got to realize jesus said there's two kinds of christians wise and foolish both are saved and we must love and respect our enemies as well praise god and just so people know they asked brother branham what will people do that don't believe the way you preach do they have to believe the way you preach will they be saved he said yes they'll be saved if they believe the lord how simple why can't people wrap their mind around this quote why do they go to other quotes and twist them brother man says you don't have to follow me to be saved now he said if they if they disagree and say i don't believe christ is the word i don't believe that's right i don't believe the baptism holy ghost well that shows where they're headed for the tribulation period so look brother says you don't need me to be saved but if you reject the promise of the bible it shows your head and you're not going to be born again you're going to be going to the tribulation period in other words he's saying i'm pointing you to be born again i'm pointing you to have the kingdom of god live inside you amen but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it preaching it because the bible says so those who accept that is free because the word's already been judged i'm just gonna say thank you jesus amen i gotta give a little worship and praise there hallelujah now see i'm just going to say this again jesus taught publicly every day he didn't hide his beliefs i'm not afraid of the critics i'm going to everybody's going to have them right if you try to do anything for god satan's gonna try to either hinder you or criticize you and it's gonna look like you're a failure but if god told you to do it do it praise god eventually you'll get the fruit that you desire to see see the only way to escape criticism is to do nothing we're all going to be fallible we're all going to make mistakes and the devil is going to accuse you no matter what whether you do it or not you're going to be accused that's what i've learned i've learned from jesus jesus wasn't scared i'm not going to be scared of what i believe if i make a mistake guess what god's going to forgive me he's going to try me again brother rand wasn't saying oh don't give anybody the tapes because i made a mistake there did he say that no he let the tapes go out even though he knew he made mistakes on some of them because anybody who has the holy ghost will be humble enough to recognize that that all people fall short of god's glory and every person is doing their best to serve god and although we fall short sometimes we get off the narrow road god will bring us right back to the middle all right now i feel you're kind of getting tired so let me try to see if i can close here that's okay everybody gets tired i get tired too give me 15 minutes here brother said god in spite of all the failure moses had done still had his hand on him and he called him to go do his service called him to his commission i preached this a while ago right and what a consolation that must have been to joshua when he heard say heard god say as i was with moses so i'll be with you although if i'm trying and i fail god will not leave me hallelujah i never have much confidence in no anybody that's too afraid to do anything i would rather be found a failure than too lazy to try but the bible says when you're in christ he's going to finish what he started in your life and you are more than a conqueror hallelujah you're more than in other words you're promised to get the victory amen as long as you don't sell out the sin and and lose all your reward as long as you keep pressing on and keep asking god to give you strength you cannot fail amen it's impossible for you to fail because god's in you amen hallelujah if you're really born again god will not leave you and the church said let's all say that god will not leave me ready god will not say it loud already god will not leave me amen it's impossible amen you're purchased by his blood amen you're a son or daughter you're adopted into the family you're not outside you're inside amen just like i could not get rid of my children how could i deny any of them haven't asked me for markers with animals on them yesterday i said yes get him you're my daughter amen well can i get something too careful yes adam you're my daughter amen i cannot i can't but help but give my children what they ask how much more of the heavenly father amen glory now sometimes great guys get together and you hear them say great so and so there's no great one he said don't never do that now listen church please i've got to be careful that too i've had brothers come in call me a mighty man of god if i'm not careful i'll let that become a prideful thing what i'm saying is i'm not i'm not i'm immune to this i've got to watch myself too don't never say well that's a great general so-and-so he's the most powerful preacher on earth he has no power except god gave it to him but the fact is he could lose that power if he breaks the word of god right like a balaam or a judas so he said no don't never do that we're getting to this great thing right brother ham's the greatest of all time well they're presuming they don't they don't know that the bible doesn't say that we have some clues but you got there's a whole lot of other clues too like the 24 seats and everything he said there's only great one one great one and that's god we're brothers and sisters now i just thought this was so fitting i don't care if you're pastoring a church that's got five people in it that don't make you little that makes you a brother see if you're true to god's word don't care what how you don't get little god don't have little big children he just has children they're all the same in other words god looks at all children all the same now yes there will be rewards the people who really invest in their gifts they'll have a hundred full reward the people that invest in a 60 full weight they'll have a 60 full reward but in god's eyes they're all my children and they shouldn't argue about who's great down here they should try to go to the lost and hurting and they should try to help the people serve the people the gentiles jesus said the gentiles want to lord over people and be lords and generals and rulers and kings right natural kings the preachers he said they're all the same he talks about the doctrine of the nicolaitans right in the first church age what it do he said it's not a holy man or a holy hill it's a holy god a holy god among the people church he's with you just as he is with me if you've got the holy ghost he's just as you with just as much with you as he is with me praise god the lady has part of it we are children there's no great ones among us how can you have faith when you desire respects one from another we're all one in christ jesus there's no big man little man we're all the same we're the children of one father and we're his children so let god determine who's the greatest among us let's not go to where jesus where we know more than jesus and we know who's going to be sitting at the right hand or left hand why another jesus if he was here he'd say why are we arguing about who's the greatest just do something just finish the great commission remember the poor remember that paul the last thing paul said to peter he said just remember the poor brother that's what he said always remember the poor now we have the poor with us always right we're always gonna have the point with us but we learn when we're around poor people we see how humble we should be right that's why he said never forget the poor but people are arguing well i'm a greater general i'm a more powerful preacher than you that's really what they're saying although they're not saying it that's really what they think let's invite this brother he's the most powerful preacher he might have a great anointing but we should not exalt one man above another we should follow the leadership of the holy spirit now this is a lengthy one but just bear with me he says now the spirit of elijah on john would make john act like elijah the spirit of god upon you will make you act like who jesus who should you and i want to act like the lord jesus now there's where you find the holy spirit see that's what the holy spirit does it makes you meek makes you humble forgiving how can i tell you i have the holy spirit of jesus christ you're meek holy forgiving glory church glory can i get it amen can somebody say amen to this quote meek humble and forgiving that's how i can tell you have the spirit of jesus christ on you not prideful exalted and the greatest among everybody it's meek humble forgiving could they pull the whiskers from your face now sisters that's they they have to pull your hair right brothers they'll pull the whiskers from like austin's a great beard there that's great beer bud good beer good beer i don't use that word great too much there's nothing great but god right see could they pull your beard and like jesus he said spit in your face and you have the power to call legion of angels could you do that for the love of the people that was spitting in your face could you do it if somebody just walked up to you and said hey you hypocrite smack you on one side of the face could you pray for their forgiveness now that's where that's the test whether you got the holy spirit or in other words god is going to test you by letting people come against you and that's going to show you if you've got the holy ghost or not because jesus had to be tested they smacked him on the face they ripped out his beard they spit in his face and he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing they're blind and that proved he had the holy spirit inside of him so how do i know i have the holy spirit because i'm meek humble i'm forgiving when somebody says something evil against someone sometime that claims to have the holy spirit right some people say they have the holy spirit still speak evil if you say i'll get even with her if it takes me my last day can you imagine people live like that like brother says that donkey will wait till the very moment he'll wait years just to kick you right it just doesn't want to work you force it to work it's going to wait for that one time you're not looking that's going to going to kick you just to get back at you wait their whole life just to get back at you it's like we'll see like we talked about that yesterday people are waiting on the tech they're waiting for something that they can try to accuse you of when you're not even wrong but they're just waiting to accuse you of something and it doesn't matter if you're on facebook they'd accuse you on facebook if you're on youtube they to to accuse you on youtube if you were live with them they'd accuse you right there in the house it doesn't matter because they got this wrong spirit about them that's not the spirit of christ on them that's an antichrist spirit that's right now there's where you check about your holy spirit every say my holy spirit ready my holy spirit you've got your holy spirit hallelujah that's the check whether you got it or not blessed are you and men shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake but you but you go get even with them no rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you hallelujah let's see how many do i have here okay when someone says something evil about you and so you said say something good about them if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing that's where i need help too we all need help with that just let it go now let me balance it out i believe too if someone says something against you you should probably go talk to them about it because the bible says don't let the sun go down upon your wrath jesus said if you go to the altar of the worship but you remember you got something against somebody he said leave your altar or leave your worship there at the altar go make it right then come back and worship so see that there's a balance to this too and then when you get to yourself pray for them if there's one thing in my life that helps me to understand that the holy spirit came into me down there that day has been that i was hot-headed fiery irish on both sides and i could always no i could never eat hardly any at all my mouth was always mashed up where somebody was punching he was getting fights so he's getting punched all the time now i'm going to this he said but something happened that old power that o william branham died and someone else came in hallelujah it makes me feel sorry for my enemy when anyone does anything to wrong me i never pray against them i pray for them and that's where the holy spirit gave me the test the other night in new england remember there was a couple making love down there on the front row and the holy spirit said whatever you say will happen brother didn't judge them he said god forgive you of that right he says forgive your enemies these are the spirits that make you evil watch them spirits in other words watch them doctrines of devils that you're greater than anybody so since you're greater you can call fire down from heaven you can close them you can do anything you can do anything you want no you can't do anything you want don't never think that i love that jesus said i can do nothing except the father shows me amen where's the scripture where are the people quoting that quote amen they're missing that quote jesus said i can't do anything except the father shows me first may we wait and until we know god has shown us something and then we can speak it and then we can pray for somebody but wait till the father shows us something first see spirits make people evil watch them spirits watch those evil spirits okay go to luke 4 real quick luke 4. luke chapter 4. i was just reading this this is my daily reading i just thought it was beautiful i got three minutes okay luke chapter six please luke chapter six i just wanna look at more scriptures a few more scriptures about greatness we don't compare ourselves to one another we compare ourselves to christ we in other words we judge ourselves by the standard of the word of god now i was i know there's at least two so this is kind of how i use my uh um my concordance oh look see all the times the word great is used i know you can't see that sorry in luke chapter six so chapter five once twice three times three times okay four times but only three apply to greatness okay okay so the first one is luke 6 23 but we have to read 22 to get the context now you have to look at the screen i'll just read to you blessed are ye when men shall hate you when they shall separate you from their company they won't fellowship with you anymore and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven in other words church you can earn a great reward just by standing on the truth you don't have to travel the seven seas although god may call you there you have to build you don't have to build an orphanage right you have to fast every other day you can just stand on the truth and if you stand on the truth and you just you won't move from the truth you know god's word is true and love your enemies god said there's a great reward for you in heaven see god jesus makes it so simple where all of us can earn a reward not that we're trying to earn a reward but we want to stay true to him and he'll reward us if we're faithful we just want to love him amen well this ought to make you love jesus more that he makes it so simple that each of you can receive a great reward just stand on the truth let them speak evil let them not call you anymore or text you or fellowship with you anymore let them go but love jesus and rejoice and know that i've stood with the son of man who is the word of god verse 35 he says it again here's where your your wallet is connected to earthly i'm sorry heavenly treasures love your enemies do good and lend them money hoping that you don't get paid back if somebody's constantly asking you to pay them back they sure don't have the spirit of christ and you know what i'm talking about now if they need it back that's different but really really they should just be thankful that they were able to give if they had the real spirit of christ if they had the spirit of christ that would say i don't even want it back and i found it's just better to lend and not ask for it back and just never just get away from that even one back and the church said i like that anybody see any man on that anybody believe that it's just me okay it's okay if it's just me it's okay i'm just preaching the revelation of my heart you know just follow my faith you know he said lend and hope you get nothing back and your rewards shall be small your reward shall be great and in heaven you should be called here are the children of the highest how you use your wallet will either make you great in the kingdom of god or maybe put you out of the kingdom of god now look both of these so far is this only limited for preachers to get great rewards or can anybody get it i hope you say anybody anybody can get these things anybody can earn great rewards in heaven anybody standing on the truth lend the money and say you don't have to pay me back because you know in your mind you can think god's going to pay me back daddy's going to pay me back he will church he will and that's it right just those two one two yep just those two talking about great rewards how many enjoy that message praise god let's stand to our feet i'll just share one thing musicians can come that's my 15 minutes that's about an hour maybe a little more i appreciate our visitors being very patient with me now sometimes guys i preach two hours you know so i'm gonna tell you guys you're very patient [Laughter] hallelujah i'm glad you can see that in your lives you know i just feel like though too if the holy spirit's speaking it don't really matter like you won't feel that full hour and a half for you because you're just you're tuned in you're listening and he said kind of god just makes your body forget you know you can feel a little bit tired but as long as that anointing of the holy ghost is there you're just your mind's on it and the time just flows by how did that just be an hour and a half how is that just an hour because we've entered up into heavenly places we ended up into a spiritual realm of understanding the word of god that's called revelation amen the spirit of knowledge and revelation in christ jesus but let me just i feel like there's maybe a one or two more i want to show here yeah another way people get rewards is if jesus told his disciples when you leave your house in other words when you're a missionary you leave your house your brothers your sisters your father mother wife children or lands for my sake you'll receive a hundredfold now so the greatest reward i can find in the bible is this one it's for a missionary so could brother branham yes brother man left his family numerous times for months on end to go preach the gospel could he have the greatest he could but you've also got to consider everybody else in the new testament there's a couple others i just want to show i hope this is okay i just want to show a few more i don't have time to get to all these notes and then i didn't have a whole lot of time as i wanted this morning i didn't get to the you know rapturing faith literally on the tapes but lord we'll get to that later i just felt like there was maybe one or two more things i wanted to say yeah let me read these on wednesday we read this play that spirit of living god fall fresh on me let's just do that one because how many need a fresh anointing of humility what do you say humility forgiveness was the other one big just thank you see you guys listening thankful for you thank you you're never better than preacher let's ask for a fresh anointing those three but here's

lovely building we're thankful for this nice dress warm well-fed people everybody well fed today amen but to think out in the mission fields there's men of god that don't have shoes on who was telling me jose was born he didn't have any shoes was that right brother how many years did you go without shoes 10 years didn't have shoes on you know we're worried about am i going to be able to get the new iphone that's [Music] there's people nicaragua don't have shoes see how we need to see how we need a fresh anointing right oh god help me help all of us praise god without a pair of shoes on eating one plate of rice a week preaching the gospel oh god i pray for those men oh god i pray that you'll help them gallant men what will we do as we read the bible they wandered around in deserts sheepskins goat skins destitute of all these things who the world was not even worthy of what's our testimony going to be up beside them at that day so about preachers today they get one meal a week on christ what is our testimony father god we pray you'll shake us with your word bring us to ourselves that we might be lively stones fit in the tabernacle of god i pray that we'll go away singing melodies in our heart because of thy presence [Music] you
