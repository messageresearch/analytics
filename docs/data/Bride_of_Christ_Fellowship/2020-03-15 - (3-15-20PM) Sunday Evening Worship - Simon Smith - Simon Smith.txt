kept on like okay and see cuz he knew he knew there was some seed there crazy hey know somebody would receive it and I appreciate for the Simon just to see all that God has done in his life I'm really really wonderful inspiring and I hope they'll just continue to share the testimonies that God's given him things God's doing there at the church in the point so thankful for that more willing to like invited me to come over so over a couple weeks for each by God's grace some look more than that let's just pray here that the God will speak to us through the word I sure enjoyed this morning's message I was thinking about my last time I Simon November preached on the open book right yeah times of the earth season of the open book so we're still in that time well thankful that God has opened his book to us us unworthy creatures right yeah but by his blood he makes us work with praise hey what's that word of Prayer [Music] higher class [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we're teaching here one of these days I'll do a song special it won't be as awkward as me just looking at you guys [Laughter] anyhow we're gonna dive back into the word by the grace of God and really your best to convey a thought you know a lot of some of the greatest songs okay some of the greatest songs and some of the probably that maybe might you would say maybe the most powerful messages some of the most powerful thoughts ever preached and brought forth in a church come from much suffering as we see it is well with my soul you know people have to endure tremendous hardships to really get a revelation of maybe something Laura's trying to convey so any I want to do a little teaching tonight by the grace again the grace of God again and hopefully this is a blessing were as we know we were definitely in we're only dosia and God has been awfully quiet you know as far as probably sixty years ago seventy years ago he was on the scene I mean moving constantly powerfully just [Music] in the way I'm sure he loved to move to display his power and His Majesty is healing ability is his divine love towards his children and and we'll start here in revelations five one look at that revelations 5-1 just going through the Old Testament now I want to see our day in the Old Testament you know what I want to see a brother had I talked with he said he's in the Old Testament is the glass brother he says it's the glass it's the mirror he said look into the Old Testament and they'll see he's is like he said he said he hold your Bible up like this use it and you'll see this is a window towards heaven and I kind of always took that with me and I've been looking at the Old Testament more and it's a book of prophecy yeah there was a lot of stories and a lot of things that have already come and gone but there's still many that is still prophetic so let's start here read this and then we'll say where to prayer after this these five scriptures here the Bible says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat at the throne a book written with within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me we've not behold the Tri the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so let's say we're to prayer the only father Lord Jesus we just love you though we come humbly before your Lord on the evening service Lord we just want you to have your way Lord I want to project Lord thoughts in my heart their Lord that you placed you allowed me to be a witness Lord and in a distant kind of way Lord to a great tragedy Lord and or we just love you or take full control Oh Lord this little vessel Lord and I was out there or that are about to ready to take their seat Scott and or be with him where we want to be edifying Lord and to share Lord what you've just placed on my heart or we love you bless every soul Lord bless this house Lord bless this ministry or bust for Jesse over to Pastor Jess all the soldiers underneath here told me increase this Lord God give that increase to a god a double portion and where we love you so much in the name use Christ II man amen it might not necessarily be people but the Spirit of God who want the most in the most double portion of the Spirit of God is is the greatest thing I could think of that's coming that we're gonna get and it's gonna give us that extra boost that fuel that's gonna make this flight possible so here in Revelations 5-1 we know this we've all been through this many many times as you maybe you've listened to the message or study to yourself and thought on it through the day and and these kind of things and here he actually comes to take the book of redemption and and we know that if he would not have come and taken this know he had already paid for he has the now take it and claim it at his own this is this is this is my my creation I'm the problem said he said the reason John was weeping because he goes if he would not have taken it all everything would have been lost the devil would have won but here we see the Christ had come and take it it was there was no man to even look on it were they to even look on it have some thoughts there but anyhow as he opens seal by seal by seal Christ as he opens that he breaks the seal he Christ has nothing Christ has the book he breaks a Co he's probably looking or glaring or whatever but then he says nothing and then a beast will say something one of the zune says come and see and one of the Newman says come and see and then when we gets to the Seventh Seal and revelations 8:1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour so there's a there's a quiet time there's a time or I taught one a week a week ago we can have to go on God went to his place when he's gone done what he does on here he's done he goes he goes to his place and I brought it forth with a like a rebellious woman a dominating woman how if a man if a woman gets that dominating spirit on her a man will actually desire to dwell in the rooftop of a house you actually leave the confines of his comfort sometimes he even went into the forest with the wild beasts and the lions and tigers and spires and all kinds of things but God doesn't have to do that because he just goes back up to his place where all is comfort where his throne sets where he is king of kings and Lord of lords where he's receiving worship time and time and time again as the holy angels they would sing holy holy holy unto the Lord constantly without they never they never rest day and night they're always praising the king amen because wherever the presence of the God is you cannot be silent I I don't know how he would want to do that but but here as the Bible talks about and when he had opened the the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour so after God had done all this he had open seal open seal up and see you open this open this open this now there's a time of quietness a time of hush I would say like a holy reverence of huh sure and you know we'll get in this why the Prophet said that but uh but then here in Revelation is 10 he comes down he blasts forth the seven thunders and then he told John sealed up don't write it so I guess tonight I like to teach on silence in the heaven and that sometime will be a space of time so and the inspiration of this kind of came to me I had been hearing rumors that some brothers were having just what we spoke a little bit on this morn they're having issues with some of the messaging and and they have not claimed to leave the message not to do away with anything we just they they just want answers we're looking we're looking for something solid I mean what why did this happen and what why was this set here the way it was said and and this didn't happen the way it was supposed to be said you know and this and that and however and then we see a tragedy a real tragedy happen and it it kind of moved me it kind of shook me a little bit on the on the aggressiveness of others I'll say like that it actually hurt me pretty bad and and I'm not very very very very very very tight with these individuals but I they're my acquaintances they're my brothers in Christ and as the Prophet taught us that whenever there's something that comes a down we were actually you know when the prophet of God was dealing the Baptist and he was dealing the Catholics he would call them or others but when it came to the Muhammadans he would call them friends see so if someone claims to be a follower of Jesus Christ they are our brothers I am not counting out anyone in any church because we don't know who is who but we're supposed to draw that circle bigger and not exclude them out okay now it would be a little bit difficult to have fellowship maybe with a Catholic priest where they will be talking about father they'd be talking about themselves I'm talking about father I'd be talking about God okay or they'd be talking about the Pope I'd be talking about Jesus Christ absolutely see so there's a there's a little bit of a problem there but as we got closer and closer to the truth maybe I'll jump to a Lutheran or a Baptist and even to the Pentecost now we can have a little better conversation a little bit better fellowship but I will never ever draw them out because what the time is not over yet the lamb has not come off the throne judgment she does not come forth so now we're still in the dispensation of grace and as the promise at one time he said he said a lot of times a lot of reasons that I thought I go to my brother's out here in the damnation the guy go out to you because I'm counting on that one chance I'm always believing that sometime one day they'll actually come out and receive what we have Baima and that's I believe what we should be doing in this in this what they call the message yeah but I call it Christianity amen the true the true belief the true faith I'll say like that email so dealing with silence in heaven I it was uh it was kind of an eye-opener on how these these brothers in that that church was treated they were treated horribly very sad situation but as I jump back here to Ezekiel and and I taught this months and months and months ago here well Jesse had allowed us to come and to teach these things so in Ezekiel 7 1 it says moreover the word Lord came to me saying also thou son of man does say the Lord God into the Land of Israel and the end the end is come upon the four corners of the land this is the end come upon thee now is the end come upon me so at the opening of this look the seals that all these things once that takes place we have now entered into the point of no return this now is time that when this moment this isn't a momentous occasion as even for the first maybe year before in 1962 the profit happens in all kind of anxiety there's something big coming there's something you just could not place it there now it was made known to him what it was to bring we knew that this this was a major thing here when for two thousand years the the Protestant church even the Catholic Church has hand the book of Revelation and they did not understand what all these symbolism meant in the Bible and then he comes down to the seals and was one of the seals open what is actually gonna take place is this later has it already done this this we nobody knew but in our day I'll say that's our parents day it took place and we're a generation or tube down now so but at that time it took place and when then it was the end and not only that he says in verse five thus saith the Lord God and evil and only an evil behold as common and has come and the end is come it's over done it this time it is done and then here in Ezekiel 11 there must have been a I'll say this there has to be a time-space here because as it was announced it is over Ezekiel announces over now people are starting to preach it is not near let us build houses for I know the things that coming in mind every one of them see so so address it was declared it's over God allows time to continue on for brief season he does not come down immediately it is not a heinous judgment brought down at the opening of this book but now he actually allows a space of time it got so much now to Ezekiel 1222 son of man what is this proverb that you have in the Land of Israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision failing are we not to that time people are doubting the barians of the prophet have these things failed up and on the bridge where is that documentation of 16 falling off the bridge into the water and drowning where is that as this failed tell them therefore they said let's say the Lord I will make this problem to cease and they shall no more use this as a proper drizzle but saying to them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision at this time now when the doubts are rising amongst the what these are the children of God this Ezekiel's dealing with Israel this is not the Hittites having rights the amorite any of those guys but he's dealing God is dealing with his what his people a man and now it has come down to that there's doubt God has allowed a portion of time just like here in Genesis 4 3 in the process of time it came to pass he brought forth Kay she brought forth abel and she not now think of this as i thought about this in now here in verse 3 says and in a process of time it came to pass but before then it was what eve was baby Cain and baby Abel and she would be nursing them and cuddling them changing diapers on them and however they hadn't fig leaf diapers or I don't know what they had but she would be taking care of these children and she raised his children up from babies and toddlers right and and as time would go on from from from infancy to this scripture Cain and Abel would get into little fights and squabbles and he would have to say oh I can't able beat now be good to one another hey quit doing that and you quit doing this and let's just hug and kiss remember brother Jess when we got it as children over at Holgate mom would make us hug and kiss each other on a cheek when we got in fights gotten disagreements and she would not let us do anything until we hugged and kissed each other I think we even ese we love I love you or something like that if I remember correctly so yeah that's this yeah so Eve would probably be under the same she's fresh out of the presence of God then knew what I was like back there fully pure fully happy and she would try I'm sure her any Adam would try and keep the family just like that and they'd raised up the children and this and that and as they got all her Cain would be a little bit more feisty maybe then Abel and Abel just try and take it and then and didn't know exactly what to do about it and they get fights and this and that and and I'm sure Abel was the tattletale because Cain was probably always picking on him I just had this feeling and and and and Abel would run to Eve and say mama mama came to this and she's like Cain I told you right just like a typical family things speaking up things little little troubles here little troubles there you know you know what what we just had the church age study uh we've been having every Saturday night and two weeks ago something Lord opened up something powerful as we were going through and remember years and years and years ago when I told you about the second lie and how Eve said that cane was of the Lord and that's actually the second line in the Bible eager cane was not of the Lord but and that was the beginning of Eve's revelation if you look at the end of Revelations or Genesis 4 Eve's mindset now is different he says now he says God has given me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew she realized now that Cain was not seed she actually had the revelation now that this was not one in the same these had new different daddies this was not of God this one was I said but Adam knew Eve again and God gave them another seed the godly seed and she was able to have a revelation now by discernment by the what took place in that time she said ah now I see my error so as they were growing up in time and time again they would get in fights and who knows what and this and that but but he would always try to bring them and make them happy and just try to bring the family together to to have a little joy get away with the strife for the stripes over we gotta get down with the stripes right but notice it was in a process of time later as they grow up now they started to have this desire to serve God after all little fights growing up and Iran wrestling and they caught they caught what a holding call one day brother holding glue she he called it roughhousing roughhousing is that we're just roughhousing and running around them this and that and rolling around and putting each other and headlocks and those sort of things but as they started growing up and they wanted to be Christian they wanted to serve God Almighty they wanted to serve Jehovah they start to offer up their sacrifices right now remember God was silent this entire time as they grow up we see him then kick Adam and Eve out and he's silent and then as in a process of time worship starts and people want to be accepted and and God then vindicates one and not the other now we got a problem some jealousy may rise up between brothers and brothers in the message and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought forth the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord right now look at the Prophet says just wait a minute God interprets his own word by its own terms that he spoke it in she God interprets don't work see Cain he said I am religious I am a lover of my maker I offer to thee in this fine offer I offered to you this sacrifice I built all these things up Lord because I love you Abel said the same thing now it's the one that's vindicated the one that's proven and God come down and receive Abel's sacrifice because by revelation he had struck the true channel of God that was accepted right Amen now watch that Cain spirit come right down through the scripture right on his way to the very last day fundamental just as fundamental as the other one once look at that Prophet Balaam and the prophet Moses both of them with seven altars jehovah's altar his blood on each one he says not only that but the rams of each one and who morality exactly like the number seven perfect seven Rams just exactly like both altars fundamentally they were exactly the same but who did God vindicate see see that the one that was in his word fundamental doesn't mean too much it's the revelation of God see so what I what I uh I will just hit this - here he says now think these men why was they called and was put in this condition these Pharisees by Jesus said in vain you were should be worshiping January worship true worship from their hearts he says you in vain you worship me whitey Schieffer doctor and their commandments of man tradition of man therefore you make the commands of God of no effect to the people so whatever we we offer to God must be true it must not come from anything but the Word of God as I was talking to a brother the other day he said brother he was oh I wish I was like this and I've seen every fault and failure I made he says and he was he was kind of magnifying his brother in his church and this and this and this and the whole time I keep coming back I said when it comes down to all of it as her brother had told me he was in the presence of God and he said I put all the good that I had done for him and he said to God it meant nothing he put all the bad in Lord Zee's I failed at this so filled this Lord filled this and he put him before God and it meant nothing what pleased God was he wanted to hear what he had done what God had done see once so when you compare yourself to someone else you're adding that person you're saying that his was right his is gonna be accepted in yours wound the only thing is going to be accepted as Jesus Christ's sacrifice it's the blood and the blood alone you can't add anything to that blood you can't add anything to what he did he did it uh-huh all righteousness the very best we can do is as filthy rags so it's simple what do we offer up Christ himself nor I am so thankful for what you did on that day I thank you for suffering I thank you for giving your life I thank you for for going down and preach you to taking this those keys from the devil I think if we're raising up from the dead and and then sending back your spirit upon demon because that's what he did amen we were lost there was nothing else we could have done we were absolutely hopeless we had not a hope or in the world so in this process of time this quietness this silence as I looked here and this kind of jumped out at to me here and we talks about and I think brother Jesse had done us a study on this the 28 days of time and these things and into everything there is a season a season everything has a season we know that by by natural by nature even look at your mind sets you go through seasons of your mind since while you're up today and you're maybe down to this day or you're battling this and it's a lot of times it comes round again you keep it seems like it just comes you you're battling kind of the same things listen ad if we don't overcome I'm and if we do overcome them maybe God will give us something greater along the same lines to make sure that virtue sticks in you and grows what was the virtue of Christ amen so all these time our time to weep a time to laugh a time to mourn time to dance all those things the time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away but notice this here and a time to Rend to break down and a time to sow which is like a restoration and then he says a time to keep silence so God has already sent the Prophet to restore the word and now all of a sudden he's silent but there's coming another day where he's going to speak what's next if there are silence in the air if there's silence in heaven and he's been silenced here on earth for the most part there's a time where he's going to come and speak and directly after he speaks is going to produce a love within us if you study Ephraim Ephraim was one of the sons of Joseph and and and Joseph brought Ephraim Manasseh before Jacob and Jacob crossed his hands put the right hand blessing on Ephraim instead of Manasseh typing what that through the cross the blessing would go to the Gentile and if you look at em from all the way through the Old Testament Ephraim actually went into idolatry the type of the Gentile Ephraim has went into a full pride mode ever went into pol idolatry worshipping a idols and this and that but there is a scripture I taught her that last time I taught at home where the Bible says that Ephraim said Ephraim said he said why would I even care about I'm gonna cast all my idols away he said because I have heard the voice of God so once he went to fold idolatry God said leave him alone don't mess with him don't mess with them what God was silent towards them but when it came down to it there was a time to speak as well he says and after we get through this love period where God speaks and we fall in love with him our hearts has turned back to him and then what a time of hate because what we go up the hatred the judgment drops down a time of war and then busting out into the Millennium peace I just see that I don't know but I just correct me if I'm wrong I just see right here the end times every move boom boom boom exactly exactly according to Scripture hey man now let's look at this year by the grace of God so we have a time to keep silent and the time to speak we know there is a speaking time coming but why did God leave the silence look at look at his eye on here lamentations 2 and 14 thy prophets have seen vain visions and foolish things for the they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but they have seen for the false burdens and causes of banishment he's all that passed by clap their hands at thee and they hiss smack their head and at the daughter of Jerusalem saying is this the city that men call perfection the perfection of beauty the joy of the Lord so here are people mocking what Zion the bride of Jesus Christ saying all this they're nothing there's nothing to them they have no strength or the power of Gaza a decline in their ministries the anointing is declining this and this is the people that garlotte their was a believer prophet and this is not and however all thine enemies have opened their mouths against thee they hiss and gnashed her teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we have looked for we have found her we have seen it she's got nothing we're gonna set the stage we're gonna set traps for this and that and she's done for but look look how low she's gotten and of whom has now been afraid or feared that thou has that thou has lied and has to remember and has not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not I held my peace even of old and I'll fierce me not here God he said he says he says why don't you come back to me why are not your hearts been fully turned he says I've held my peace what he sent as a messenger we have over a thousand twelve hundred servants and he we can listen to him time and time again we have the live fivefold ministry working right now amongst the bride and why I'm now a heart slowly turned back to him have not I held my peace I let you guys do this when I wondered why is there a silence he's allowing is he's allowing this silence because it's just like grace what's what's the one of the greatest deceptions about grace for the false seed line in the old testament if I would sin a sin and be caught a lot of the chances that the punishment was to be stoning death instantaneously dragged him out of the city and everybody the whole congregation comes out and stone him stole him but in grace a lot of times nothing happens the first time I did this certain sin I was like wow I don't know if I should do this I was like 18 19 I really don't know why she'd do this I did it no Thunderbolt no thunder no lightning no judgment and it made my next step a little easier nothing happened and I continued to grow and more and more wickedness and and doing more and more evil things why because we're under a grace mode rather a grace dispensation right now and maybe God is allowing these things maybe he's allowing himself to be silent to see what people will do and go see how far people will go in their evilness their wickedness and God holds his peace just letting it all happen his psalm of Asaph the mighty god even the god has spoken and called the earth from the rise in his son even to the going down there of out of zion the perfection of beauty god has shined our god shall come and shall not keep silence see the Seventh Seal silence is going to Edwin Lee when these days this thing's gonna be all over he is going to speak a man he's gonna speak to his nine spiritual gifts he's going to speak to us fivefold ministry he's going to speak through his people and God will be heard once again on the on the four corners of the earth amen he said he will not keep silence a fire showed the power to before man it shall be very temperature around about him he shall call to the heavens from above into the earth that he may judge his people a man gathered what'd he say Jesus gather my Saints unto me those are the main accompany with me by a sacrifice then the heavens shall declare his righteousness a judge himself saying man absolutely he promised he would not keep silent forever he doesn't call upon me in the day of trouble out of it deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me absolutely so he's keeping silence maybe he wants us to start speaking to him more often and longer periods of time my wife had just while the video of a man who was being tortured it was tortured for 14 years under a communist rule 14 years of torture for praying if he was calling the South praying he was beaten right then and thrown back in and he said he would start praying again it actually strengthened him they beat his feet so much they he the rest of his life he never walked again right never walked right and these were message thoroughbreds Pentecost this was a Lutheran they loved God so much that they would even preach to to each other and when they got caught the one that was preaching would always be beaten they'd come back in the room they said where did we leave off and started preaching again 14 years the wife his wife he was a pastor his wife was taken into the camps - made to work hard labor carry stones work like a man - all those things they captured his son took him into a Cell beat him in front of him he cried out I'll tell you every time it and then they killed him and he served God for 14 years in the prisons he was sent into the most into room number four where they saw everyone that got sick that would die they send a number of room number four because that's where they're gonna die when they got so bad they send the room four and he was sent to room four and he did not perish for weeks and weeks and weeks and as one would go in and die another one go and die he would lead him to the Lord surrounded by death sick himself amen and then God would anoint one of his converts to go undercover it and he's a doctor and gave him this the the medicine needed to get out and he got out he lived 14 years and he founded the voice of the martyrs 14 years and we have it rough anyone have a rough day I haven't had a rough day yet I've never been physically beaten for reading the Bible or praying or anything we are very blessed right now a mom now continue on here he says it Psalms 50 verse 16 but unto the wicked God saith what has thou to to do to declare my statutes and what the house should is take my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and casting my words behind the they're starting to preach God's Word these people here started to preach God's Word and God says why you preaching my word we don't even owe bayen you don't even like it when thou saw'st so thief thou consent us with him and has been partaker with it alters look at everything he's now give us thy mouth to evil night on Freimuth deceit now citizens speakers against thy brother now slanders thine own mother's son these things has now done and I kept silence I wonder if that time was silence in heaven not only on earth but God is watching the Seas manifest what I saw down south what it was it was an absolute spiritual martyrdom the brother one just once and wants to talk he called for a meeting he wanted to find some answers and they threw him out he's no longer amongst us these things thou hast done and I kept silent now thoughtless that I was altogether such as one as thyself but I will repute reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes now consider this ye that forget God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver you who sober offer praise glorified me into him that offers his conversation right well I showed us shoe the salvation of God amen see this is why we must always have a grace I don't know the condition right now presently of that situation but I tell you what he's my brother and no not only that I would not take the opinion of someone else I called for a meeting with the brother on the phone and I heard from his mouth what took place where he's standing and I found if he's telling me the truth all the rest are liars in that day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel Paul says this word that I've received is directly from the Lord God Almighty this revelation even the things he allowed that I came from me he allowed to be put in the scripture he says thus saith the Lord he says now look he says and art thou confident verse 19 the tower thyself art a guide to the blind and light of them in darkness and in structure of the foolish a teacher of babes which thou has the form of knowledge and of the truth of law now therefore which teaches another teachers not thyself all these men are preachers this preachers preaching preaching preaching preaching and yet they don't have enough love for this brother down south and they throw them out and belittle him write letters and what's that messages about them throwing them out cast them out into denominational world now let's say the man should not commit adultery does thou commit adultery now that abhorrest idols does thou commit sacrilege now that makest thy boast law through breaking the law dishonor style God for the name of your God is blasting him on the book among the Gentiles through you as it is written the Bible says in James 2 he says if you break 1/10 of the law you're guilty of it all there's no cutting we can boast in ourselves Saints outside of Christ Jesus he says keep down I still oh god hold not thy peace and be not still O God for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate them lifted up the head they have taken crafty a counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones oh my it looks like they're coming after the bride it looks like they're trying to break up this message churches looks like they're trying to cause division amongst the people a man hmm one by one dividing this brother from that brother dividing this and dividing that and whatever this fellowship hmm he says now he says hold not thy peace O God of my praise for the mouth the wicked in the mouth of the deceitful are open against me and they have spoken against me with the lying tongue and the Old Testament called false bearing false witness they have compass me about also with the words of hatred and fought against me without a cause well I just want answers can we talk about this can you reread the Bible talks about reasoning amongst ourselves and coming to like a godly answer to the best conformed thought we can maybe II conjure up by the grace of God through the Word of God for the spirit all those things come up with the compass my about me with the words of a hatred and fought against me without a cause for my love they are they are my adversaries but I give myself unto prayer and that's exactly what he's with this brother said he was doing he's the brother it's caused me to draw closer to Christ and back to the word if you actually say something about this message and you doubt this and well I don't know what he really meant here you were actually you or they were cast out right away there's no grace for you and they that and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love of course we have this Judas Scripture and psalms one on 109 six to thirteen and wicked man and those sort of things here in Isaiah 42 verse 12 he says let them give glory into the Lord and clear his praise in the islands the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry a roar he shall prevail against his enemies I have long time he says holding my peace but I have been still and refrained myself he was ready to attack way back then he was ready for judgment way back then he says but now he says I will cry like a travailing woman I'll destroy and devour once what when God is fed up when the with a cup of iniquity of the air rises flow it's time to bring it I will make waste hills and mountains and hills and dry up all the herbs and I'll make their rivers islands and I will drive the pools and I'll bring the blind by the way they new nods and I will lead them and paths which they have not known I will make nart darkness light before them and crooked things straight amen these things like I doing to them and not forsake them it looks like his bride is about ready to suffer some problems here looks like she might be going into some persecution and and the mighty lion the tribe of Judah has had enough people have risen up against the bride people have rosin up against his love and now he is done he is fed up and it's time to settle this the time of silence it's he's going to roar soon behold as written before me he says I will not keep silence but recompense even recompense into their bosom your iniquities and your iniquities of your fathers together saith the LORD which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemy in the hills therefore I measure their former work into their bosom thus saith the Lord as the new light is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for as a blessing and it's all due to my servants sake that I may not destroy them all God is going to send more revelation and more revelation and more revelation what even in the time of his silence he's going to bring forth things that are going to set his bride alive he's now bring forth a seat on a Jacob not am I out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains and minor lacs shall inherit it and my servant shall dwell there amen God will not always be silent Saints we actually have lived in a time much like time before the first coming of Christ there was no prophet silent for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years no one had a clue what was going on until John the Baptist up unseen and then Jesus stepped up the scene and now we have a no Church but now we what we've been 60 years without hearing a prophet he didn't store up the meat he didn't store but now where is who is preaching the fresh manna who is preaching the true revelation of Jesus Christ amen but we see in the back scenes we see how brothers treat one another in the message hope I'm not getting too personal I'm just saying this I mean you can't hide actions actions don't lie you can see people say I love you but the way they treat you is another way another thing that's that's the telltale right there how they treat actions are the saying is true actions speak louder than words are they 1-9 awake awake put on strength or arm of the Lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of always Lord I want to see you as he in time of Moses I want to see you in the time of Abraham and Jacob and Isaac he's I want to see all these things absolutely I want to see the God on the scene make a man fall a power full of zealousness absolutely someone that would come on and just deliver us art thou not here they cut Rahab and wounded the dragon verse 11 he says therefore the redeemed Lord shall return and come with her singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon her hands he something is going to strike us when that ladder rain hits and whatever would all that entails whatever it is in that seventh seal whatever entails is going to be so great is going to change things we have great promises amen from the Bible we have great things that God is going to do I even I am he that comforts you look there's the comforter right there the Holy Ghost who art out that that shouldn't be afraid of a man that shall die and the son of man which shall be made as grass verse 16 put my words in thy mouth and I have covered thee in the shadow might hand and I my that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundation earth and say in desire and thou art my people see God is going to he will not leave his people suffer forever and have we suffered much but in the mind in the confusion everything's gray right now the prophesied gray that color the color of confusion and deception because it's neither black nor white let's continue on here Psalms won over some seven six arise O Lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou has commanded there was coming a time where God where the saints of God are gonna be put onto it yes we're gonna we're gonna see some things and uh God will come have to come off that throne and when that happens it's it's gonna be he's gonna be a lion this could be lion mode then we saw what he did in lion mode number one we'll see it again here a repeat performance in number two yay for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter awake why sleepest Thou O Lord arise castis not off forever wherefore hidest thy face and forget us our friction in our oppression for our soul is bowed down to the dust and our buddy belly cleaveth to the earth arise for help and a redeem us for thy Mercy's sake things of God how Bad's gonna get in America look at what they look at the cry of the bride here God has been silent she's suffering something terrible and just like the children of Israel were on Egypt and their taskmasters were hard and making more brick more slime more MORE all those things until they couldn't take into more lace and the Bible said that God heard the cries of his people and said a deliverer this may have another repeat performance as well I don't know what's coming but God is going to allow us to get the point where we're gonna say Lord please don't keep silent speak to us once more come down and bring your mighty power Eman many times the Prophet said it's going to be it's going to get rough now notice here's a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth he wink it in his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teaches with his fingers Fordyce forward misses in his heart he devised mischief he soweth discord I like how they said that he saw with discord now why is that because if you look at the definition of discord disagreement between people they try to put a wedge between people a lack of harmony between between notes sounding together a lack of harmony and disagreements conflict friction hostility that is someone who's of discord who so is a discord they don't want to get along or they don't want certain people to get along and notice how this says here in proverbs 6 verse 16 and I pulled off bars on us because I like what he said about it these six things doth the Lord hate he says 6 right but then he says yay someone says yay seven are an abomination to him why did they do that why does why do that because they've done it a couple times in the in Proverbs I believe they'd always say this number then that well there's oh yeah there's an extra one why didn't just come out and say there's seven well look what look what look o barn says here like this he says and the seventh he says the teacher here enumerates six qualities of detestable things that are just wicked and the seventh is worse than all separate seven represents completeness but all this but all the seven in this instance belong to one man the man of Belial Wow see so here he said there's six things that I hate he's about seven does God count abomination you said that seventh one is the one God hates discord what kind of discord a false witness to speaketh lies and he that sow discord among the church our own brothers in this message and God said he hates that and they'll preach over the pulpit said you better love your enemies you better love those that this and you better love and bring God's divine not oh I got divine love and yet if a brother disagrees with one thing they're out you know write letters about them telling their backslidden they don't know what they're doing and they're the next casual in war that's what we saw how look what the Bible says here John the disciple that Jesus loved little children he said let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil and the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he was born of God that's the Baptist the Holy Ghost in this he says the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil by what by words no he says by manifestation in outward the words comes second the deeds came first the doctrine came second he says whosoever does not righteous is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so what is the message for this is the message that you have learned from the beginning that we should love one another there's probably not two ministers in this message that have a hundred percent ingredients on everything but I notice how some will look past others differences in as soon as another one has a different difference they'll run them out it's picking and choosing not as Cain who's of the wicked one and slew his brother slew him naturally now and I talked to this brother he said brother he goes it's like I was a spiritual martyr he said these I'm not go any further than that I would say something but and we're forced through him because his all works were evil and his brothers righteous Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you he said we know he had passed from death to life because we love the Brethren hey if I started preaching Trinity doctrine I believe my brother Jesse right there our pastor would not hate me and call me a devil he'd say what do you know you know what'd he do he'd have to be him he'd be right here on the altar with his children praying for me I'm sure he would call me and check up on me and try and he would try and try and win me back to the word he'd probably even make a personal visit to my house and say brother can we talk about this one more time and if I'm in a real to confused state I probably yeah let's look I I I'm starting to see this now and just you probably sit me down and run the scripture with me into a Bible study because that's what brothers do we're our brothers and sisters keepers where we keep one another Marvel not my brethren that the world hate you know that we have passed from death to life whosoever hates that brother is a murderer and he know not that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down the love of God what is the love of God because he laid down his life for us did he throw andra did he throw us under the bus and just keep back and forth back and forth no he gave his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but it seems like it doesn't happen too much but who was there anywhere so ever hath this world's good world's good and seeth his brother in need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from he where how do out the love of God and here my little children let let us not love in Word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth the first person to blast this brother down south had texted him the night before it said brother I love you I appreciate you I respect you more than I ever had before in my entire life after this conversation and then one day he had a whatsapp message that just destroyed him he said brother I'll send you the text if you want I'll send it to you I can take a screenshot and send it to you and show you I was like no I believe your brother what was said one thing to his face and he thought he was leaving to go overseas and he blasts him somewhere else in the greatest message in those who say they have divine love one for another and this is his commandment that we should believe on his name on his name son on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another and he gave us as he gave us commandment that was the commandment is to love one another this is commanded to love one this is not an option we do this this is real love this is life if we're to live in the world and this is the word this is the commandment that says this is to be done if we fail it then we have sinned I wonder how many would repent of this is it well I might little drop a little something in here Matthew 24 in the last days the two spirits we so close together to see the real active as possible now that's just like looking at the right hand and the left hand they both got thumbs fingers nails small fingers middle fingers so forth index fingers all these different fingers they both have blueprints only one turn this way and the other that way both the same print made the same way the thumb prints everything is identical alike the only difference is the characteristic of it one is left and one is right that's the only difference any ties in Mathew 24:24 the only difference is their characteristics their deeds and that's just the way the spirits will be in the last day they will be the characteristic of it will detect whether is of God or not one of them will be right and the other will be wrong you'll know it by the characteristic of God but God laid his loved us so much he laid his life down for us he took our sin he took our blame he took our approach our iniquities how much should we lay down for our brothers and sisters a man just perfectly will have to be that way but the right hand we'd say is right and the left is wrong or see vice-versa one of them they're determined by their characteristics only Canole by their characteristics I've always wonder about the scripture until I find I found the interpretation in the Bible I've always wondered about this won't to them they have gone in the way of Cain they have ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core there are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds what does that mean I've always wondered until it was probably just a couple months ago I found that scripture here in Proverbs 25 14 whosoever boasts in the self of a false gift is like clouds and rain and water without or wind without rain hmm well I'm a pastor and this and this yeah but is that you have the true gift are you left-handed to our right hand and pastor gotta be careful hey Matt now we're almost to an hour here I won't be much longer by God's grace look at this now your people with those salt ember salt blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth that somebody can't put up the things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak one word against your brother that's not right I wonder how many call I'm gonna called personally called that brother that made one of the messages or them letters and texts letters I guess your brother's not right just go around go around and tear it down you don't have to have a stick a knife a man to Madison and a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about and he just might as well as shot him told something that wasn't right about him well you it'll kill his influence with the pill people and things like that and you're guilty of it what Jesus said Wow such a matter such a fire this little member can can boast can start and one of the very one of the very first signs of Christianity refused to kill a man remember that story brother Graham thought he said he's sitting with his daughter and she had this book or whatever on the gladiator and a Christian man was was taken as a Christian by Rome or one of the in they they made him fight as a gladiator but he's a Christian he's a real Christian and they he was in the midst of the arena there and he given one sword and the Christians like what do I do out you know and and they release a lion and the Christian had the defendant self he killed a lion and there were people going roaring just praised or not pretty I was just well awesome fight awesome fighting they released another lion and the Christians slew that one as well the crowd went wild Emperor was up on his feet what they do next they released a man an African warrior a pagan warrior and the Christian looks up the Emperor Emperor an emperors like kill him the Christian fought the man and pushed him down and could have taken his life but it came to his senses that he was a Christian he put the sword in the ground and took off his armor went to the end person I cannot kill a man I'm a Christian never yelled down you refuse the Emperor and the Emperor yelled out to the African man's and you get up take that sword and slew him through and the Christian man went like this and allowed him to kill him right through he said that's right and you could kill him more ways than just sticking him with the knife speak against his character many ways you can do it Jesus but the first sign of a Christian is you'll not kill someone with your words god help us now another reason hero of this the silence in heaven and God has to keep things I'm sure brother Jesse taught us many many times and been very very thorough he's very thorough on everything he does teaching preaching all those things now this is dealing with the the Seventh Seal itself the silence why what what is it now none of us know but I'm going to tell you in my revelation of it and now I'm not prone to be fanatic as if I am I'm ignorant of intime not guilty to his imagination things or however and he goes on he says and now as soon as I stand on this platform tonight I had a revelation that had the revelation that revealed it's a three-fold manner right he said that I will go and speak to you by God's God's help the fold of it he says those seven thunders that he heard their thunder was forbidden right and that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out now why let's prove it why it says it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidding to write about it even right a symbol of why this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now so he was keeping God kept silence because whatever action whatever whatever would have been shown up there would have revealed the last mystery the last revelation the last thing there was things that we need to know then heavens could not write that heavens can't know about nothing else because there was nothing else to go on it was a relaxing time God was silent and now he sits back he had done so much work for the last what twenty years to the prophets ministry through all this mystery the East says now it's a relaxing time he kicks back he's brought forth restored the word and now he's letting people do what they want to do with it all the while God has one little revelation here waiting a 3-fold I was like this revelation that he is going to speak at it momentarily when these days soon here and then he'll be on but it but it will reveal many things now why I've seen could get a hold of it you might do great damage there is one thing he don't know now we can interpret anything he wants to interpret any kind of gift I hope you're learning but he can't know this is not even in the word it's a total secret man right and that's exactly about as far as we can go right there now look what he says here remember it was Jesus when his enemies thought that they had defeated him the unbeliever said we got him on the cross the savages Pharisees the religious leaders of the day who hated him and hung him in the cross they thought we got him now aha it was about that time God wrote in on the scene raised him up on Easter morning broke the King to the Satan stripped hell took the keys of death hell and rose up with them sure it was just at that week time his message he had preached the word it stood by and everything and then it was at that real weak moment when he when that's when he when the victory come right now the message is at a weak moment I talked with the brother and what'd he say he said brother if we don't find some answers on these things he said 20 years from now there will be no message they said that's how many discrepancies how many things that you know however I believe you put your pastor our pastor brother Jesse here has answered many of those but many are not gonna be able to see his his his videos he says now when he'd done all he could dude and God came in he changed the scene when Jesus had recovered from the shock of death he was the strongest he could walk through the building without even a moving of a mortar of a stone he could eat fish and bread amen yes it was at that time after the weakness had come that he found himself strong it was after weakness had come so we're seeing saints of God we're at we're at a weak point silence had happened Nicollet ISM lack of zeal like a fervor in the church lack of fire almost a lukewarm state for the bride my goodness I don't pray like I should I taught on the the part about the cans were dealing with the approaches of war I'm sorry the approaches of worship one of them is to God says to get in your closet he says get up early and then he says what seek my face a lot of times I would get up early and I prayed but I never ever hardly ever sought his face until he was there there are things we have to do and it looks like it's pretty weak now for both message and messenger and if this is not come to pass but don't you worry somewhere I don't know how but I'm trusting him he'll come riding in on the scene someday don't you worry let's go out together let's bow our heads together amen eating time evangelism so stand my point the whole point of this was to show that while God is being absolutely silent right now as far as there's no judgment striking do we hear answers prayers absolutely do we save healings and and those sort of things absolutely but as far as to hear the the Spirit of God speak to wreck like outside of preaching outside you know I mean we we want we desire more awesome I desire to hear God more but as he's allowed this time where he is just up at his place as the Bible would say Satan has let people come into this message and just ravish it leaving the people powerless more fighting and bickering quarreling argument arguing hatred all those things have totally encompassed the bride of Jesus Christ where's the divine love brother goes my church and visit another church he said brother he was not one person's in hello to me he was brother it's ice down there at one hmm let's bow our heads your healing father Lord Jesus so we love thee God you know Jesus Lord even though you said in your word God then the seventh seal Lord of this you were silent for half an hour Lord and we don't know how that is on an earthly time but Lord we know we're growing close Scott we see everything enough world right now Lord a little tiny diseased God nothing like a Zechariah 14 God is even struck the Bible said eyes the men will ride out and the tongues will ride out the flesh will be just falling off and death will flee from them we're not talking about this kind of plague or just a little simple virus God and lore that's shaken the entire world Lord Lord me we know you're prepping God Lord we're not shaking nor we're not just made or tossed to and fro Lord Jesus over leaving you I know we know the time of science is coming over you're going to bring forth its thunders Lord you're going to reveal Lord exactly what you've kept hidden for 2,000 years Lord John was about to write back to 98d John Rose grabbed that quill that spiritual quill or whatever kind of pen he had Lord he is riding on that scroll daughter on that paper and you told her to hold it up you know Jesus but we know those things you real very soon but we just pray Lord and you just anoint Lord whatever it is God no to finish the work God said you would but Lord at that time that also be persecution the bride Lord she'd have enemies Lord he would be killing your spiritual God and though Jesus would even though he may not have a martyr's crown or gonna be persecuted order give us all strength give us that backbone God we would fear man the diamond ago we fear you were walking reverence humility God you're holding here worthy word alone God Lord wanting to hear your spirit God Lord speak back to your daughters we have many words just love this rattle or a heart soft floor but all we want to hear you sleep on time as it changed ephram's heart Lord HP jars as well not let go of everything but all material goods will be nothing just your spiritual Kingdom over treasures in heaven bless those because they sat through a little teaching here God and Lord I wasn't trying to be angry or or point fingers going but I Lord we're just identifying a spirit dog an evil spirit on when one that hates his brother and wouldn't stick up before and more dissonant well God have mercy on holding you just fix whatever needs fixing up we love you so sure the name of Jesus Christ amen brothers sisters I hoped I was alright and wanted uh we wanted to hit that thoroughly because this we're dealing with the statue of perfect man's the highest one is to probably kindness brotherly kindness yes just being kind with God's kindness you know with godly love someone could actually take you out falsely accuse you take you to a whooping stone take those nine cat tails and whip your bag see your see your ribs your bones will stare at you beat you unrecognizably ripped the beard hairs out of your face make you walk and carry a cross he couldn't carry it no more and hang you on the cross and brotherly kindness as Lord Father forgive them for they know not what they do that is the characteristic of God that's the characteristic we want in our lives when I hear about maybe the problem you're having whatever whatever it's not them it's the Spirit we know that's just this pure because you know deep down every person wants it reality wants to be good when that when a baby is born that baby is happy but if they grow up in the wrong environment it twists their character you take a tree and you plant that tree in the forest and you let that sapling come up and it's just kicking out little limbs here and there and a flower here there a leaf here however and maybe get its first fruit and some evil man come around and bend that tree down and place something over it and that tree will have a permanent Bend if left alone it'll be this it'll distort them it'll pervert them for the rest of their days if you look at the Prophet when he's going into discernment he whenever he goes back in time he finds there was something that caused them to be like that and once that problem is identified the situation sold I don't know what it does I just you just have that that calming peace it just gives them closure it just heals them somehow and every person man and woman need that kind of healing but you can see the influence of the the demons on them or however my God had mercy hope that was all right brother go ahead and seamless let's get a song and just worship our Lord and Savior [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
