[35:01] um I'm just going to read verse one and
[35:03] then we'll skip ahead a few verses so
[35:05] Matthew 61 take heed that you do not
[35:08] your alms before men to be seen of them
[35:10] otherwise you have no reward of your
[35:13] father which is in
[35:15] heaven now for those of you know that he
[35:18] goes through alms and prayer but we'll
[35:20] read through this later but let's skip
[35:21] to verse
[35:24] 19 so necessarily not necessarily the
[35:28] public things is what we get rewards for
[35:30] it's the secret things that we get
[35:32] rewards for verse 19 lay not up for
[35:35] yourselves Treasures upon Earth where
[35:38] moth and rust do corrupt so if a moth
[35:41] can eat it or if rust can corrupt it
[35:43] it's probably not a reward right
[35:46] probably not the kind of reward we
[35:47] want and where thieves break through and
[35:50] steal so if you have a real reward from
[35:52] God a thief can't steal it because it's
[35:55] not something physical it's something
[35:56] that's recorded in heaven praise God
[36:00] verse 20 but lay up for yourselves
[36:02] Treasures in Heaven where neither moth
[36:06] nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves
[36:08] do not break through nor steal for where
[36:11] your treasure is there will your heart
[36:14] be also let's have a word of prayer if
[36:17] you have a need on your heart just make
[36:18] it know to God by raising your hand
[36:19] let's pray together Heavenly Father be

[36:46] help reading tonight I got numerous
[36:48] scriptures uh we like to uh look at by
[36:51] the grace of the Lord
[37:01] God is so good to us like I said I've
[37:03] been looking for a time to kind of bring
[37:05] these scriptures in uh and we want to
[37:08] make sure we get them at rewards crowns
[37:10] and Treasures in Heaven you want to look
[37:12] at that by the grace of the Lord uh
[37:15] first thing I want to just lay some
[37:16] Foundation here uh about how the
[37:20] treasure uh first before you lay up
[37:22] Treasures in Heaven you got to have the
[37:24] treasure inside of youen praise God
[37:28] you have to have the treasure in you
[37:30] which is what God's spirit God's uh seal
[37:33] of the Holy Ghost you got to have that
[37:35] in you and then you'll want to lay up
[37:37] Treasures in Heaven praise God so let's
[37:40] look at some of those scriptures let's
[37:42] go to 2 Corinthians 4 if we could let's
[37:44] start there by the grace of the Lord 2
[37:47] Corinthians
[37:55] 4 I just kind of that with this be my
[37:57] outline first get the treasure in you
[38:00] and then we'll see what Treasures how
[38:01] you get Treasures in Heaven and then
[38:03] we'll look at rewards what rewards Jesus
[38:05] promise for your works here on Earth and
[38:07] then Crown the crown you get and then I
[38:10] like to look if we have time at brother
[38:12] bram's beyond the curtain of time
[38:13] experience and he also had a dream about
[38:15] when crowns were given out I'd like to
[38:17] look at that tonight that's kind of my
[38:18] outline here by the grace of the
[38:21] Lord
[38:23] okay so Second Corinthians 4
[38:28] now I want to get down to seven but I
[38:29] want to start there let's start at verse
[38:31] six okay so now you ready to go second
[38:35] Corinthians 4 Malachi can you read verse
[38:37] six and seven
[38:38] sir for God who commanded the light to
[38:41] shine out Darkness has shined in our
[38:43] hearts to give the light of the
[38:45] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[38:47] face of Jesus Christ we have this
[38:49] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[38:52] Excellency of the power may be of God
[38:54] and not of us amen praise God so our
[38:57] hearts were darkened but then the Light
[38:59] of Christ Shone Upon Our Hearts is that
[39:02] what the scripture says and now when the
[39:04] knowledge of Christ and he was the
[39:06] Messiah died for us Rose for us forgave
[39:08] us of our sins when that becomes a
[39:10] reality and we really accept it believe
[39:12] it then we have treasure in our vessels
[39:14] amen because we have faith inside of us
[39:16] now look at verse eight now look you can
[39:18] have all the hardships in the world
[39:20] going on around you but if you got the
[39:22] Treasure of Christ in your heart you can
[39:24] overcome everything amen look at verse
[39:26] eight we are troubled on every side Paul
[39:30] says every side so if he turn this way
[39:32] he's got trouble this way trouble this
[39:34] way trouble I got troubles with my
[39:36] family troubles with my friends troubles
[39:38] with my children troubles at the job I
[39:39] got troubles all around me right but as
[39:42] long as you got treasure in Earth and
[39:44] vessels you'll be an overcomer amen
[39:47] we're troubled on every side yet not
[39:48] distressed so see we can have trouble
[39:51] yet not let it get us down so much where
[39:53] we're distressed about it we are
[39:55] perplexed but not in despair
[39:58] so we're not despairing like there's no
[39:59] hope we have hope praise God persecuted
[40:03] but not forsaken amen cast down but not
[40:08] destroyed I might have been cast down I
[40:10] might have thrown off to the side by all
[40:11] my friends but I wasn't destroyed amen
[40:14] might be persecuted by family and all
[40:16] these things like that but the Bible
[40:17] said you're not forsaken because God
[40:19] can't forsake his own children amen look
[40:22] at verse 10 always bearing about in the
[40:24] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[40:26] the life also of Jesus Jesus might be
[40:27] made manifest in our body so see it's
[40:30] like we write we did yesterday in our
[40:31] Bible study dying every day you die
[40:34] every day we're always bearing that
[40:35] dying in our body dying to ourselves
[40:38] praise God okay so that's the scripture
[40:41] I want to start with there by the grace
[40:43] of the Lord okay now let's uh if you
[40:45] have your Bibles let's go to Colossians
[40:48] so Colossians is a few books after that
[40:50] Galatians Ephesians Colossians
[40:52] Colossians chapter 2 verse3
[40:59] Colossians

[41:20] the mystery of the god of God and of the
[41:23] father and of Christ in whom are HID all
[41:26] the treasures of living

[41:30] Christ Jesus amen all the treasures of
[41:34] wisdom and knowledge all the treasures

[41:40] spirit will reveal the treasures of his
[41:42] will for your life inside of the Bible
[41:44] inside the pages of the Bible praise God
[41:47] so that's where all the treasure all the
[41:49] treasures in Christ so when we get
[41:51] Christ in us now we have treasure in
[41:52] Earth and vessels praise God Amen now
[41:56] let's go to the Book of Matthew Matthew
[41:58] chapter 12 Matthew chapter
[42:02] 12 Matthew chapter
[42:11] 12 Matthew 12:35 I got that right
[42:19] there brother Austin you got that 12:35
[42:22] brother yep okay can you read that
[42:25] please a good man out of the good
[42:28] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[42:29] good things and an evil man out of the
[42:32] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[42:34] praise God so everybody's got right
[42:38] something inside of them right you
[42:39] either have a evil treasure or you have
[42:41] a Godly treasure praise the Lord and
[42:44] whatever comes out of your mouth shows
[42:45] what kind of treasur is in your heart
[42:47] it's either the corrupt treasure right
[42:49] Treasures of the earth like got to have
[42:51] this it's got to have that all this
[42:52] stuff down here or you have The Treasure
[42:54] of God's word coming out of your mouth
[42:57] amen now go to chapter 133 because it
[43:00] talks about how uh we look for the
[43:03] kingdom of God as our treasure okay 13
[43:07] chapter
[43:09] 13 verse 44
[43:17] 1344 now verse 44 I'll read that again
[43:20] the Kingdom of Heaven is like in unto
[43:22] treasure hidden in a field the which
[43:25] when a manath found hideth and for Joy
[43:28] thereof goeth and sth all that he hath
[43:30] and buth the field praise the Lord so
[43:33] the Kingdom of Heaven is like a field
[43:35] it's a treasure hid and you got to sell
[43:37] out everything in order to gain that
[43:39] treasure praise God and how many know
[43:41] what brother Ram said the kingdom of
[43:42] heaven was brother BR said the Kingdom
[43:44] of Heaven is Christ in you the baptism
[43:47] of the Holy Ghost amen so that's what
[43:49] it's like to be born again with the
[43:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's like a
[43:53] treasure you got to sell out everything
[43:55] to get that treasure that's in the field
[43:57] that experience with God Amen Hallelujah
[44:00] now go to verse 52 in the same
[44:09] chapter all right verse
[44:12] 52 now this is a scripture for preachers
[44:15] right here uh if you know the context of
[44:17] this verse 52 then said he unto them
[44:19] therefore every scribe which is
[44:21] instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven is
[44:23] like unto a man that is a householder
[44:26] which bringeth forth out of his treasure
[44:28] things new and old praise God so someone
[44:31] who instructs in the kingdom of God
[44:33] brings forth out of his treasure new
[44:35] things and old things praise God Amen
[44:37] you get New Revelations you're preaching
[44:39] you got old Revelations that stir your
[44:41] heart back up you bring it out of your
[44:43] heart amen someone who instructs in the
[44:45] kingdom of God Amen that's what we try
[44:47] to do every time we try to pray and ask
[44:49] God to lead us in the services and help
[44:51] us to bring forth new things and old
[44:52] things praise God out of our hearts
[44:54] things that God has placed in there by
[44:56] the grace of the Lord amen now let's uh
[45:00] uh so first you got treasure in you how
[45:02] many want treasure inside of you praise
[45:04] God we have this treasure this this
[45:06] baptism of the holy spirit in Earth and
[45:08] vessels now let's look at uh how we get
[45:11] the other Treasures a treasure in heaven
[45:14] so let's go to back back to Matthew
[45:15] chapter 6 where we had our
[45:17] text let's look at a little bit more
[45:19] about this by the grace of God
[45:31] all right so we read chapter one right
[45:32] about alms okay so I want to make sure
[45:35] we read about that now alms are any uh
[45:38] offering that you give to people okay so
[45:41] if you see a man out on the street or a
[45:43] woman out there on the street um that's
[45:46] and you give them something that's an Al
[45:48] okay that's giving something like if
[45:49] even if you just give them food even if
[45:51] you just give them a dollar or something
[45:52] like that anything you have that you
[45:54] give them that's considered an Al now
[45:56] look at verse we read verse one look at
[45:58] verse two therefore when thou doest
[46:00] thine alms do not sound a trumpet before
[46:02] thee as the Hypocrites do in the
[46:04] synagogues and the streets that they may
[46:06] have Glory of men where that in you they
[46:08] have their reward okay so whenever when
[46:10] you tell everybody hey I'm going to go
[46:11] do this and I'm going to do something
[46:13] real nice for people Jesus says you
[46:14] already got your reward you're G to have
[46:16] treasure in heaven for that one verse
[46:18] three but when thou doest Ms let not thy
[46:20] left hand know what thy right hand doeth
[46:23] that thine alms may be in secret and thy
[46:25] father seeth for which seeth in secret
[46:27] shall reward thee openly so when you
[46:30] this is a wonderful equation when you do
[46:32] secret things God uh God honors you
[46:35] publicly praise God you do secret things
[46:38] God honors you publicly openly praise
[46:41] God that's that's the that's the uh we
[46:43] say the reward or the system of God God
[46:45] wants us to do secret things and then he
[46:47] rewards us openly all
[46:50] right now um verse six now look at verse
[46:53] six here's our prayer scripture we're
[46:55] supposed to pray in a secret place
[46:57] uh and then God again rewards us openly
[47:00] verse six but thou when thou prayest
[47:02] enter into thy closet and when thou has
[47:04] shut thy door pray to the Father which
[47:06] is in
[47:07] secret and thy father which seeth in
[47:09] secret shall reward thee openly amen so
[47:13] secret giving secret prayers and then
[47:17] God rewards you publicly so private
[47:19] prayers private arms giving and public
[47:22] honor he gives us amen or public rewards
[47:25] praise the Lord that's the law of God
[47:28] Amen now fasting verse
[47:31] 16 remember fasting is giving up meals
[47:34] it can be giving up all water and all
[47:36] food or it can just be drinking water
[47:38] for example The Book of Daniel talks
[47:40] about how Daniel gave up the the the
[47:41] Choice Foods so he still ate a little
[47:43] bit of food for 21 days uh had to eat a
[47:46] little bit of food but he didn't eat the
[47:48] best foods so that was his fasting and
[47:50] remember at the end of the 21 days the
[47:51] angel finally came to him because
[47:52] Gabriel helped him out in heaven or I'm
[47:54] sorry in the spiritual Realms there so
[47:57] he had different kinds of fast sometimes
[47:59] it's fasting of all food sometimes it's
[48:01] fasting of just Choice Foods now verse
[48:04] 16 moreover when you fast be not as the
[48:07] Hypocrites of a sad countenance so don't
[48:08] be sad when you're not eating be happy
[48:11] for they disfigure their faces that they
[48:13] may appear unto men to fast verily I say
[48:16] unto you they have their reward but thou
[48:19] when thou fastest anoint thine head and
[48:21] wash thy face so make it look like
[48:22] you're all healthy and happy that thou
[48:25] appear not unto men to fast but unto thy
[48:27] father which is in secret and thy father
[48:29] which seeth in secret shall reward thee
[48:32] openly everybody get this uh the same
[48:34] picture from Jesus do everything in
[48:37] private right in secret and then God
[48:39] rewards us openly praise God what a
[48:43] blessing all now let's go to the next
[48:46] scripture here let's go to Matthew
[48:51] 19:21 Matthew 19:21
[49:00] Matthew 19:21 Malachi you got that buddy
[49:02] can you read
[49:04] that Jesus said unto him if thou will be
[49:08] perfect go and sell that thou Hast to
[49:11] give to the poor and thou shall have
[49:13] Treasures in Heaven and come and follow
[49:15] me praise God Amen now how many know
[49:18] he's speaking of of course the Rich
[49:19] Young Ruler here right now if you know
[49:21] the scripture he kept all the
[49:22] Commandments except one he had a lust
[49:24] for money right and Jesus Jesus says if
[49:27] you want to be perfect sell all you have
[49:30] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[49:31] treasure in heaven and come follow me
[49:35] amen so we
[49:37] see Jesus uh enjoys that we obey his
[49:41] commands but he wants to get every
[49:43] little shred of selfishness out of our
[49:45] life remember brother said you can keep
[49:47] 99% of the word but if there's 1% you
[49:50] don't keep you can miss it so what does
[49:52] that mean you got to sacrifice
[49:53] everything you got to surrender
[49:54] everything amen hallelujah you got to
[49:57] give up everything say God clean out all
[49:59] my heart this man was willing to give
[50:00] God 99% but I'm still going to keep my
[50:03] 1% of greed for money I won't give to
[50:06] the poor I need riches I'm I'm trusting
[50:07] in my riches and it showed he wasn't
[50:09] truly Sanctified was he although he
[50:12] could keep all the other Commandments
[50:13] just like Judas he could pretend and
[50:14] keep all the other Commandments but
[50:16] because of one thing because he didn't
[50:18] fully surrender everything he missed the
[50:19] kingdom of God and brother Ram said he
[50:21] missed being an apostle because Jesus
[50:23] said come follow me right and remember
[50:26] the maniac of gader who had all the
[50:28] demons he said Jesus can I follow you
[50:30] and Jesus said no stay there and be a
[50:32] witness to your people in Gad so this
[50:34] was a rare opportunity where Jesus says
[50:36] come follow me and he couldn't follow
[50:38] Jesus because he loved money and riches
[50:40] so much praise God now our troubles
[50:43] might not be money riches but what if
[50:44] it's lust and relationships right or
[50:47] what if it's some other type of a sin
[50:48] what if it's Pride what if it's
[50:49] arrogance what if it's anger other
[50:52] things just one thing can keep us from
[50:54] uh being born again from the kingdom of
[50:56] God is that right so we must come to
[50:58] Christ and say cleanse all of me
[50:59] whatever is my my my biggest battle help
[51:02] me to die to myself and help me to
[51:04] overcome it that I might have treasure
[51:06] in heaven and follow you amen glory
[51:09] that's what we need to do by God's
[51:12] grace all right now uh that was Matthew
[51:17] 19
[51:19] okay now if we can let's go to Mark
[51:21] 10:21 and this might be a parallel
[51:24] Passage
[51:33] okay Mark
[51:37] 1021 okay yeah this is the same uh the
[51:41] same passage but I want you to see look
[51:43] at how
[51:44] Jesus uh looked at him him look my
[51:47] goodness look at verse
[51:49] 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him
[51:52] and said to him one thing thou lackest
[51:54] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[51:57] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[51:59] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[52:00] cross and follow me oh my look Jesus
[52:04] even loved this man Jesus loved the Rich
[52:06] Young Ruler now look at verse 22 brother
[52:09] also read verse 22 if you can brother
[52:10] look at look at that and he was sad at
[52:13] that saying and went away grieved for he
[52:16] had great possessions amen so he went to
[52:19] church was just dramatized he went to
[52:21] church and Jesus said go sell everything
[52:23] and follow me and he left church all sad
[52:25] because he couldn't for forsake his
[52:27] riches praise God we must fully
[52:29] surrender everything and then only then
[52:32] can we follow Jesus and take up his
[52:34] cross we have to surrender all of our
[52:36] hopes all of our dreams all of our
[52:38] Earthly Desires in order to follow
[52:40] Christ Jesus amen that's what we're
[52:43] doing by the grace of the Lord
[52:45] amen all right that's a good scripture
[52:48] there now okay let's go to Luke chapter
[52:51] 12 now Luke chapter 12 this is how you
[52:54] store up Treasures in Heaven you have to
[52:55] sell out your greatest desires your
[52:58] greatest Earthly Temptations and you
[53:00] must live contrary to that natural
[53:04] desire and live according to the
[53:05] spiritual desire that God placed in your
[53:07] heart Luke
[53:09] 1213 I we'll start there
[53:16] 1213 okay let's at this this is a good
[53:18] uh this is a good story where Jesus uh
[53:21] has to tell this man don't worry about
[53:23] your inheritance don't worry about all
[53:24] this money that you want okay Mali can
[53:27] you read 13 14 15
[53:30] please and one of the company said to
[53:32] him Master speak to my brother that he
[53:35] divided the inheritance with me I said
[53:38] to him man who made me a judge or
[53:40] divider over you I said unto them take
[53:43] heed and beware of covetousness for a
[53:46] man's life consists not in the abund the
[53:49] abundance of the things which he
[53:51] possesses amen praise God all right so
[53:55] we can see here
[53:57] that Jesus tells a man don't worry so
[53:59] much about all your Earthly money right
[54:02] and look what he he gives him a parable
[54:04] because of this because this man's like
[54:06] give tell my brother to give me my money
[54:08] you're a rabbi you're a preacher tell
[54:09] him to give me my money Jesus says well
[54:11] let me tell you a parable so you can
[54:13] learn about this okay L can you read 16
[54:16] 17 18 and and he spake a parable unto
[54:19] them saying the ground of a certain rich
[54:21] man brought forth
[54:22] PL and he thought within himself saying
[54:25] what should I do because I have no room
[54:26] where to bestow my fruits and he said
[54:29] this I will do I pull I will pull down
[54:31] my Barns and build greater there will I
[54:33] bestow all my fruits and my goods amen
[54:37] verse 19 and I will say to my soul soul
[54:40] thou Hast much Goods laid up for many
[54:42] years take thine East eat drink and be
[54:45] married but God said un him thou fool
[54:47] this night thy Soul shall be required of
[54:50] thee then whose shall those things be
[54:52] which thou Hast provided so is he that
[54:54] layeth up treasure for himself and not
[54:57] rich toward God isn't that powerful so
[55:00] this man said I he said I'm going to
[55:01] take care of my my retirement I'm going
[55:03] to lay up all this all these Goods I'm
[55:05] gon to build greater bars I'm so wealthy
[55:07] I'm gonna build up all this and I'll
[55:10] have an easy future I'll just sit back
[55:12] and relax and I'll just eat drink and be
[55:14] merry right but God said you fool you're
[55:17] laying up Treasures for yourself on
[55:19] Earth instead of laying up Treasures in
[55:20] Heaven praise the Lord can youbody see
[55:22] that now there's nothing wrong with
[55:24] saving money it it uh what matters is
[55:26] how much you save and your motive and
[55:28] objective for saving money praise God
[55:32] brother Ram said there'll be a lot of
[55:33] millionaires in hell right there'll be a
[55:35] lot of Penny errors in hell as well no
[55:37] matter if you're rich or poor but
[55:38] there'll be a lot of rich people in hell
[55:39] we know that Jesus said that it's hard
[55:41] for rich man to get to heaven there's
[55:43] nothing wrong with saving but when
[55:45] you're a Christian and you see somebody
[55:46] that has a need James chapter 2 says we
[55:49] should help them if we have Living Faith
[55:52] if we have dead Faith we'll just say oh
[55:53] God bless you and we won't help them but
[55:55] if we've got real live faith will try to
[55:57] help out people that need our help amen
[56:01] now here's where I want here's where my
[56:02] inspiration came this is from the church
[56:03] age book chapter
[56:05] 4 brother bam said this all too little
[56:09] time is spent on laboring for the
[56:11] Eternal rewards of God the recompense or
[56:15] the rewards of God are too lightly
[56:17] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[56:20] the resurrection of the body and eternal
[56:21] Kingdom of substance then we ought to
[56:23] lay up in heaven those good Treasures
[56:26] that that are available to the faithful
[56:28] Saints Hallelujah so what what does that
[56:31] say we don't spend enough time on
[56:33] rewards in heaven do we we don't brother
[56:36] said we need to so Jesus showed us how
[56:38] to lay up Treasures in Heaven pray in
[56:40] secret Give in secret right fast in
[56:44] secret anything in your heart that you
[56:46] when you feel like you need to help
[56:48] somebody go help them out that's how you
[56:50] lay up Treasures in Heaven things on
[56:52] earth that are destroyed are not
[56:54] Treasures in Heaven praise God
[56:57] Hallelujah hope everybody can see that
[56:59] by the grace of the Lord
[57:05] now I want to skip down here by the
[57:08] grace of the Lord okay we saw those
[57:09] scriptures I want to go a little bit
[57:13] further
[57:14] okay so that's how we con see if you
[57:17] have this treasure in you if you have
[57:20] the word of God in you the love of
[57:22] Christ Jesus in you then you will want
[57:24] to labor for Heavenly treasure and the
[57:26] word of God won't make you sad you won't
[57:28] leave church sad if God asks you to give
[57:30] something up like if God ask you to give
[57:31] up a relationship or God ask you to give
[57:33] up uh all this money or whatever you
[57:35] have you won't leave sad but you'll
[57:37] gladly do it because you love Christ
[57:39] Jesus amen all right now let's if we can
[57:43] let's look at some rewards some specific
[57:45] rewards uh that God gives to us here God
[57:49] promises to give us the
[57:51] rewards
[57:52] now I want to just first go over this uh
[57:55] mark if you got your Bible Mark 10
[57:57] Matthew Mark and then Luke but let's go
[58:00] to Mark chapter
[58:02] 10 I want to read this one especially
[58:04] for our brother Austin that's here uh
[58:06] just to encourage
[58:08] him and different ones that have left
[58:10] family members because Jesus promises
[58:12] you if you leave family members for me I
[58:15] will bless you on the Earth right now
[58:17] some rewards you get now other rewards
[58:19] you get later all right so here's a
[58:22] clear scripture about rewards we get
[58:24] right now Mark 10
[58:27] 10 now I want to uh start at verse 28 so
[58:30] Austin can you read 28 29 and 30
[58:33] brother and Peter began to say unto him
[58:36] Lo we have left all and have followed
[58:39] thee and Jesus answered and said verily
[58:41] I say unto you there is no man that has
[58:44] left house or Brethren or sisters or
[58:46] father or mother or wife or children or
[58:49] lands for my sake in the gospel but he
[58:52] shall receive aund fold now in this time
[58:55] how and Brethren and sisters and mothers
[58:57] and children and lands with persecutions
[59:01] and the world to come eternal life amen
[59:04] is't that a promise when did Jesus say
[59:06] we get it right now praise God if you
[59:09] leave friends family if you sell your
[59:12] lands uh to follow Christ Jesus he said
[59:15] you'll receive a h hundredfold now amen
[59:19] hallelujah that's true so if our family
[59:22] rejects us guess what we inherit a
[59:24] bigger family praise the lord we uh I we
[59:28] could take you to any message church
[59:29] that we're in fellowship with and if you
[59:31] need a a place to stay they let you stay
[59:33] in their house if you need food they'd
[59:34] give you food right because when you
[59:37] leave the world God is bound to take
[59:39] care of you praise God because he's your
[59:40] child and you in the Christian body in
[59:43] the Christian Network we'd say of of
[59:45] Holy Ghost filled believers they will
[59:47] take care of all God's people Jesus said
[59:49] that reward is right now and then the
[59:52] future reward is what eternal life amen
[59:56] eternal life he said in the world to
[59:58] come so there's a world now there's a
[1:00:00] world to come and we get uh hundredfold
[1:00:03] now and eternal life in the world to
[1:00:05] come beautiful scripture praise God now
[1:00:09] let's look at some of the scriptures
[1:00:10] here uh that will help us to know
[1:00:13] rewards all right let's look at some of
[1:00:15] these I got numerous scriptures about
[1:00:17] rewards okay let's go to ma Matthew
[1:00:21] 5:12 Mali can you get Matthew 512 Lydia
[1:00:24] can you get James 1:12 so ma Matthew
[1:00:27] 5:12 Malachi and Lydia James

[1:00:39] is your reward in heaven for so
[1:00:41] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:00:42] before you amen so you have a reward in
[1:00:46] heaven if you're persecuted on this
[1:00:47] Earth if people make fun of you being a
[1:00:49] Christian if people mock you or even try
[1:00:52] to hurt you physically Jesus Promised
[1:00:54] there's a reward in heaven let's read
[1:00:56] verse 11 because I should have read that
[1:00:57] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:00:59] that means speak evil persecute you and
[1:01:02] shall say all manner of evil against you
[1:01:04] falsely for my sake praise God great is
[1:01:08] your reward in heaven Amen Hallelujah
[1:01:10] Jesus Promised when you if you will get
[1:01:12] through all this persecution now I'll
[1:01:14] have a reward for you later now Lydia is
[1:01:16] going to read James 1:12 you don't have
[1:01:18] to turn there but Lydia go ahead and
[1:01:19] read that please blessed is the man that
[1:01:21] endureth Temptation for when he Strife
[1:01:23] you shall receive the Crown of Life the
[1:01:26] Lord has promised to them that love amen
[1:01:29] so church we just have to endure let's
[1:01:31] say endure ready endure what's endure me
[1:01:34] just persevere through it if you can
[1:01:36] persevere and just fight through all the
[1:01:38] trials all the Temptations then the
[1:01:41] Bible said you have a Crown of Life
[1:01:43] laying up for you because you love the
[1:01:45] Lord amen as you love the Lord you learn
[1:01:48] to deal with persecutions you learn to
[1:01:51] deal with Temptations you're able to
[1:01:53] overcome them because love conquers all
[1:01:55] temp ation does it not love for Jesus
[1:01:58] will conquer any trial any Temptation uh
[1:02:02] any trick of the devil any device of
[1:02:04] Satan if you love Christ it'll help you
[1:02:06] overcome that and you have a crown of
[1:02:08] righteousness waiting for you in heaven
[1:02:10] amen so what are you g to reward for
[1:02:12] staying true to Christ despite
[1:02:14] persecution amen despite people falsely
[1:02:17] saying evil things against you God will
[1:02:19] reward you for that amen okay let's go
[1:02:22] to Mark 9:41 and brother Austin can you
[1:02:24] read that markk 9 41 when you get there
[1:02:27] yes whenever you're ready brother
[1:02:29] whenever you get
[1:02:35] there or who whosoever shall give you a
[1:02:38] cup of water to drink in my name because
[1:02:41] you belong to CHR verily I say unto you
[1:02:44] he shall not lose his reward amen praise
[1:02:48] God did you see that Jesus sending out
[1:02:50] his disciples right
[1:02:51] here I'm sorry no he's actually
[1:02:53] correcting his disciples because they
[1:02:54] were trying to say well all the
[1:02:56] preachers have to follow our our little
[1:02:58] assembly right and Jesus says whosoever
[1:03:01] gives you a cup of water to drink in my
[1:03:05] name shall not lose his reward praise
[1:03:09] God so when you're standing for Christ
[1:03:11] serving Christ and even something as
[1:03:14] small as a cup of water in the name of
[1:03:17] Jesus if they give it to you you'll get
[1:03:19] a reward it also works the other way
[1:03:21] right if we're not the one laboring and
[1:03:23] we see someone laboring for Christ and
[1:03:25] we get them a cup of water you get a
[1:03:27] reward as well right works both sides if
[1:03:29] you're the one who needs water or you
[1:03:30] see someone who needs water and you give
[1:03:32] it in the Name of Christ you get a
[1:03:33] reward praise God something as small as
[1:03:37] a drink of water right J is Jesus
[1:03:40] watching all of our motives and our
[1:03:42] objectives yes is he watching all of our
[1:03:44] actions yes we should have people that
[1:03:46] we should be people of pity people of
[1:03:48] Mercy people of compassion people of
[1:03:50] love for all those who call upon the
[1:03:52] name of Jesus Christ and also our
[1:03:55] enemies
[1:03:56] like Jesus said love your enemies and do
[1:03:58] good to them who persecute you amen
[1:04:02] hallelujah now let's go to Matthew
[1:04:06] 10:41 this one applies to us because we
[1:04:09] received the prophet in our day Matthew
[1:04:20] 1041 now let's read uh LD can you read
[1:04:22] 40 and
[1:04:23] 41 he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:04:26] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:04:28] that s me he that receiveth a prophet in
[1:04:31] the name of a prophet shall be shall
[1:04:33] receive a prophets are Lord and He that
[1:04:35] receiveth a righteous man the name of a
[1:04:37] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:04:39] Name Lord amen praise God so Jesus says
[1:04:42] if you receive my preachers it's like
[1:04:44] you receiving me praise the Lord and
[1:04:48] then he says also if you receive a
[1:04:49] prophet you get a prophet's reward and
[1:04:52] they asked brother BR what's a prophet's
[1:04:53] reward and brother Bram said a prophet's
[1:04:55] reward is being a friend to the prophet
[1:04:58] and he said uh he said like the
[1:05:00] shulamite woman in uh First Kings
[1:05:02] chapter 17 he said it might come in
[1:05:05] handy
[1:05:06] sometime Hallelujah so in other words if
[1:05:09] you uh receive a prophet it will bless
[1:05:13] you in some way now here here's how it's
[1:05:15] blessed us when we read or when we hear
[1:05:17] stories of brother brandom and we apply
[1:05:19] those same truths to our lives they
[1:05:21] could be a blessing to us for example
[1:05:24] like the story of hady Wright we brother
[1:05:25] said she said the right thing praise God
[1:05:28] if we can take that uh story and apply
[1:05:31] to our lives and we can say the right
[1:05:33] thing praise the Lord at the right time
[1:05:35] God can bless us as well amen right
[1:05:38] that's the reward of being of knowing a
[1:05:40] prophet of receiving a prophet you get
[1:05:42] blessed by The Prophet's Ministry praise
[1:05:45] the Lord amen I talk to people too where
[1:05:48] they say they listen to a tape and let's
[1:05:50] say in a prayer line and somebody has
[1:05:51] the same sickness they've had and at
[1:05:53] that moment it's like God speaking to
[1:05:55] them and because they believed a prophet
[1:05:57] accepted a prophet they get a blessing
[1:05:59] of a prophet they get healed by
[1:06:00] listening to a tape that happened 40 or
[1:06:02] 50 years ago that's the rewards of
[1:06:06] receiving a prophet amen hallelujah
[1:06:09] that's exactly
[1:06:11] right so we see that you get a reward
[1:06:13] for receiving brother bandham as a
[1:06:15] prophet hallelujah thank God for that
[1:06:18] now we already went this you get a
[1:06:19] reward if you pray in secret you get a
[1:06:21] reward if you give alms in
[1:06:23] secret uh you get a re if you leave your
[1:06:26] family members and possessions for the
[1:06:28] sake of the
[1:06:30] Lord uh if you endure Temptation and
[1:06:33] fight the goodby of Faith you get a
[1:06:34] reward here's a good one too let's go to
[1:06:36] Luke 14:12 Luke
[1:06:43] 14:12 think about this one Luke 14:12
[1:06:46] here's a really good one to think about
[1:06:48] poor
[1:06:49] people remember even giving them natural
[1:06:51] things get you reward it's so important
[1:06:53] to meet the natural needs of people
[1:06:55] especially poor people think about
[1:06:58] people in the church that maybe don't
[1:06:59] have a lot of money let's do good to
[1:07:01] them praise God the Bible said you
[1:07:03] should always be ready to to do good to
[1:07:05] them that are of the household of faith
[1:07:07] amen of course be good to all men but
[1:07:09] especially Paul says of the household of
[1:07:11] faith be ready to do good to Christians
[1:07:14] okay B guy can you read 12 13 and
[1:07:18] 14 then he then said he also to him that
[1:07:22] b him when thou make us a dinner or a
[1:07:24] supper come not thy friends nor thy
[1:07:26] Brethren neither thy kidsmen nor thy
[1:07:28] Rich neighbors lest they also be thee
[1:07:31] again and a recompense me May thee but
[1:07:33] when thou makest a feast call the poor
[1:07:35] the mean the lame the Blind and thou
[1:07:38] shalt be blessed for they cannot
[1:07:40] recompense thee th sh be recompensed at
[1:07:43] the resurrection of the just amen praise
[1:07:46] God a't that wonderful look at the
[1:07:48] promise of God when you have a feast
[1:07:50] when you're H gonna celebrate invite
[1:07:53] people that can't pay you back
[1:07:56] amen it's okay to invite people you know
[1:07:58] but Jesus saying make sure you do good
[1:08:00] to the
[1:08:01] poor have a dinner invite people that
[1:08:04] can never pay you back and then you have
[1:08:06] a reward in heaven praise
[1:08:09] God hallelujah that's beautiful
[1:08:13] amen so if you know any poor any M any H
[1:08:16] any blind you'll be blessed if you
[1:08:20] Minister those who can't pay you back
[1:08:22] praise
[1:08:23] God Amen what a wonderful scripture
[1:08:26] here's one we read last week let's go to
[1:08:28] James chapter 1 with Austin and I
[1:08:29] were're reading on this one James
[1:08:32] chapter
[1:08:43] 1 uh 2627 ausome can you read are you
[1:08:46] getting there bu okay um James 1
[1:08:49] 12627 I'll read it it's in the back uh
[1:08:52] by right before Hebrews I'm sorry after
[1:08:54] Hebrews Hebrews James If any man among
[1:08:56] you seem to be religious and bridleth
[1:08:58] not his tongue but deceiveth his own
[1:09:00] heart this man's religion is in vain so
[1:09:03] any any when people just cuss and don't
[1:09:05] care or they just badmouth people and
[1:09:07] backbite people and gossip their
[1:09:09] religion is not even a reality yet it's
[1:09:11] not even real they don't even understand
[1:09:13] that they don't have any they have evil
[1:09:14] treasure in their hearts because the
[1:09:15] treasure in your heart comes out of your
[1:09:17] mouth right so we must not swear we must
[1:09:20] not uh persecute we must not uh slander
[1:09:24] people verse 27 pure religion and
[1:09:27] undefiled before God and the father is
[1:09:28] this to visit the fatherless think about
[1:09:31] people that don't have fathers think
[1:09:32] about the single parent mothers or
[1:09:35] fathers that you know and widows in
[1:09:38] their Affliction so when you see people
[1:09:40] that are afflicted and to keep himself
[1:09:43] unspotted from the world this is pure
[1:09:45] religion when you see someone who's
[1:09:47] hurting when you see someone struggling
[1:09:49] go visit them or maybe call them on the
[1:09:51] phone pray for them right do something
[1:09:54] good for those that are afflicted
[1:09:55] that's pure religion before God and also
[1:09:58] keeping your mouth from Evil Hallelujah
[1:10:01] and there's obviously rewards for those
[1:10:03] but I want to make sure I read that this
[1:10:04] is pure religion that we must have
[1:10:07] that's why I love James James is so
[1:10:08] straightforward we talking about that
[1:10:10] it's so easy to tell what James is
[1:10:11] trying to say he don't speak in riddles
[1:10:13] you don't speak in symbols he this is
[1:10:15] how you live this is how you have faith
[1:10:17] this is how you keep your mouth right
[1:10:18] this is all all these things he just
[1:10:20] lays it right out like that James the
[1:10:22] brother of Our Lord amen
[1:10:25] okay let's go back to Luke
[1:10:29] 6 Luke
[1:10:32] 6 here's another reward by God's grace
[1:10:34] this one kind of ties in with the the
[1:10:36] one about making a supper and inviting
[1:10:38] people that can't pay you back Luke
[1:10:46] 6 all right now I want to get to
[1:10:49] 33 um
[1:10:59] let's go to verse uh 30 Luke 6:30 give
[1:11:03] to every man that askthe and of him that
[1:11:06] taketh away thy Goods ask them not again
[1:11:08] wow so someone takes away takes away
[1:11:11] your your possessions don't ask for them
[1:11:13] back that's what Jesus said that takes
[1:11:16] real holy ghost power verse 31 and as
[1:11:19] you would that men should do to you do
[1:11:21] you also to them likewise there's the
[1:11:22] Golden Rule right there in
[1:11:24] Scripture vers 32 for if you love them
[1:11:27] which love you what thank have you for
[1:11:30] Sinners also love those that love them
[1:11:32] and if you do good to them which do good
[1:11:34] to you what thank have ye for Sinners
[1:11:37] also do even the same so in other words
[1:11:40] it's easy to love people that love you
[1:11:42] let's love people that are hard to love
[1:11:45] then we get the real Victory right there
[1:11:47] amen verse
[1:11:49] 34 now here's where we're getting to
[1:11:51] money now if you lend to them of whom
[1:11:54] you hope to receive what thank have ye
[1:11:57] so when you lend money we shouldn't hope
[1:11:59] to get it back right for Sinners also
[1:12:02] lend to Sinners to receive as much again
[1:12:04] but love ye your enemies and do good and
[1:12:08] lend hoping for nothing
[1:12:11] again so when you give somebody money
[1:12:13] don't hope for it back just pray for
[1:12:16] that God to bless
[1:12:18] them and your reward shall be what
[1:12:22] great Hallelujah when you do good to
[1:12:24] your enemies and you lend money or lend
[1:12:26] whatever and you don't hold for it back
[1:12:28] Jesus said I'll reward you with a great
[1:12:32] reward and ye shall be the children of
[1:12:34] the highest for he's kind unto the
[1:12:37] unthankful and to the evil be therefore
[1:12:40] merciful as your father also is merciful
[1:12:44] so when you can lend and be uh lend and
[1:12:47] not want money back when you can be good
[1:12:49] to people that are enemies to you now
[1:12:51] you're being like God because God gives
[1:12:53] Reign to Sinners God gives life to
[1:12:55] Sinners and they don't even thank him
[1:12:57] praise God now you're starting to be
[1:13:00] like God when you can love the unlovable
[1:13:02] when you can give and hope for nothing
[1:13:04] back in return that's a real Christian
[1:13:06] right there amen great is your reward
[1:13:09] not small is your reward great is your
[1:13:12] reward Hallelujah those are red letter
[1:13:15] words Promises of Our
[1:13:17] Lord
[1:13:19] now let's keep going here there's a few
[1:13:21] more scriptures where we get rewards uh
[1:13:24] 1 Corinthians 9 let's go there 1
[1:13:26] Corinthians 9 we want to get to 17 but I
[1:13:28] might might start a little bit above
[1:13:29] that 1 Corinthians
[1:13:36] 9:17 let's start at verse 16 yes 1
[1:13:39] Corinthians
[1:13:42] 9:16 Mali can you read that 16 and 17
[1:13:44] are you
[1:13:46] there though I preach the gospel I have
[1:13:48] nothing to Glorious for necessity is
[1:13:51] laid upon me y Woe Is unto me if I
[1:13:55] preach not the gospel for if I do this
[1:13:58] thing willingly I have a reward but if
[1:14:01] against my will a dispensation of the
[1:14:04] Gospel is to is committed unto me praise
[1:14:07] God so Paul notices what it I have woes
[1:14:10] or uh he says I have woe woe unto me if
[1:14:13] I preach not the gospel so I'll have
[1:14:15] troubles if I don't preach the gospel he
[1:14:17] said if I do this willingly I have a
[1:14:19] reward so we've got to willingly serve
[1:14:21] the Lord we got to give him our will and
[1:14:24] we've got to want to do what Christ
[1:14:25] wants us to do then we're rewarded
[1:14:28] praise God so serving God willingly get
[1:14:32] your reward well I want to do what's
[1:14:33] right I want to help those who are poor
[1:14:36] I want to do good to those uh who who
[1:14:38] don't do good to me I want to uh give to
[1:14:41] people who won't give me back because
[1:14:43] they they just don't have it we have to
[1:14:45] want to serve God we have to willingly
[1:14:47] give God our service now let's go to
[1:14:50] Colossians 3 this is a pretty
[1:14:51] interesting one because it deals with
[1:14:52] slavery Colossians 3:23
[1:14:59] Colossians 3:23 now of course we don't
[1:15:01] Advocate slavery or anything like that
[1:15:04] but St Paul realized people would be in
[1:15:06] that
[1:15:07] situation and he told them to keep
[1:15:22] serving all right
[1:15:25] now this is not the one but we're going
[1:15:26] to read anyway okay so Colossians
[1:15:30] 3:23 brother Austin are you there okay
[1:15:33] can you read 23 24 and
[1:15:35] 25 and whatsoever you do do it partly as
[1:15:38] to the Lord and unto and not unto men
[1:15:42] knowing that of the Lord ye shall
[1:15:44] receive the reward of inheritance for
[1:15:46] you for you serve the Lord Christ but he
[1:15:49] that doeth wrong shall receive for the
[1:15:51] wrong which he hath done and there is no
[1:15:53] respect of persons
[1:15:55] amen praise God did you catch that verse
[1:15:58] 24 knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:16:00] receive the reward of the inheritance
[1:16:02] for you serve the Lord Christ okay now
[1:16:06] here's what I I missed the scripture
[1:16:07] it's verse 22 brother I'm gonna read go
[1:16:09] back and read verse 22 Paul speaking to
[1:16:11] servants or these are
[1:16:13] slaves in in this area of the colossian
[1:16:16] church servants obey in all things your
[1:16:20] Masters according to the flesh so if
[1:16:22] you're a slave he says obey your your
[1:16:25] master with all your heart right not
[1:16:29] with eye Service as men Pleasers but in
[1:16:32] singleness of heart fearing
[1:16:35] God knowing that of the Lord in verse 24
[1:16:37] you shall receive the reward of the
[1:16:39] inheritance for you serve the Lord
[1:16:41] Christ what a powerful scripture M we're
[1:16:44] not slaves are we none of us are slaves
[1:16:46] as far as we know but but Paul says
[1:16:50] however you serve your master that's how
[1:16:52] you serve Christ amen so however I work
[1:16:55] at my job that's how I serve Christ
[1:16:57] right however you work at your job
[1:16:59] that's how you serve Christ and if you
[1:17:01] serve and if you work like you're
[1:17:02] serving Christ you have a great reward
[1:17:04] in heaven amen so we've gone over
[1:17:06] rewards you get a reward if you endure
[1:17:08] Temptation you get a reward if you give
[1:17:10] a cup in the name of Jesus you get a
[1:17:13] reward if you receive a prophet amen you
[1:17:15] get a reward if you pray in secret if
[1:17:17] you give alms in secret if you fast in
[1:17:19] secret if you leave your family members
[1:17:21] and possessions like lands you get a
[1:17:23] reward if if you fight the good fight of
[1:17:25] Faith you get a reward if you make a
[1:17:28] dinner and those people cannot repay you
[1:17:30] you get a reward if you love your
[1:17:32] enemies and hope and also if you lend
[1:17:34] money and hope you don't get it back you
[1:17:35] get a reward amen if you serve God
[1:17:38] willingly you get a reward if you
[1:17:40] heartily serve your Masters your Earthly
[1:17:42] Masters uh as Christ you get a reward
[1:17:45] amen and lastly oh we read this one
[1:17:48] already but lastly uh you must believe
[1:17:50] you will get a reward in Hebrews 11:6 we
[1:17:53] read that on Sunday You Must Believe
[1:17:55] that he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:17:57] diligently seek God okay so we first saw
[1:18:00] that you have to get the treasure in you
[1:18:02] you got to get the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost in you and then after you get the
[1:18:05] treasure in you then you can lay up
[1:18:07] Treasures in Heaven praise God Amen and
[1:18:09] then you can get rewards now here's the
[1:18:11] warning that we got to watch so let's go
[1:18:13] to the end of the New Testament 2
[1:18:17] john8 2 John
[1:18:20] 18 because people can lose rewards as
[1:18:22] well if they leave the Faith they lose
[1:18:25] rewards this is all scriptural the Bible
[1:18:28] said you can even lose a crown right um
[1:18:32] 2
[1:18:35] john8
[1:18:38] okay now he's talking about deceivers in
[1:18:41] verse 7 for many deceivers are entered
[1:18:43] in the world who confess not that Jesus
[1:18:45] Christ Has Come In the Flesh this is
[1:18:47] deceiver and the Antichrist look to
[1:18:50] yourselves that we lose not those things
[1:18:53] which we have wrought but that we
[1:18:55] receive a full reward praise God so
[1:18:59] whatever you work for for Christ upon
[1:19:02] this Earth he said labor that you don't
[1:19:04] lose your reward praise God now that
[1:19:07] might look like this uh some examples I
[1:19:10] can think of like if you win a soul
[1:19:11] praise God and bring somebody to Christ
[1:19:13] you have to work and labor and make sure
[1:19:15] you always point that person to Christ
[1:19:17] amen praise God pray them through if
[1:19:19] they need help if they need natural
[1:19:21] things you help them out with natural
[1:19:22] things you don't want to lose your
[1:19:24] reward you don't want to get upset with
[1:19:26] somebody and reject them or something
[1:19:27] like that you want to keep your reward
[1:19:30] amen uh if you start like for ex our
[1:19:32] example if we start a church we can't
[1:19:34] give up if it gets hard we got to keep
[1:19:36] working for Jesus because we don't want
[1:19:38] to lose any rewards we must work until
[1:19:41] he comes amen those are just a few
[1:19:44] examples
[1:19:45] amen but look the Bible said we want a
[1:19:48] full reward we want to earn the best
[1:19:50] reward we possibly can and that's by
[1:19:52] working for Jesus and now giving up now
[1:19:56] 1 Corinthians 3 says the same thing
[1:19:58] let's go there 1 Corinthians
[1:20:02] 3 1 Corinthians 3 doing good on time
[1:20:06] praise God verse 14 and
[1:20:19] 15 1 Corinthians 3
[1:20:27] now like to read the 14 and 15 L you got
[1:20:30] that you ready thank you if any man's
[1:20:34] work abide which he has built thereup he
[1:20:37] shall receive a reward any man's work be
[1:20:40] burned shall be burned he shall suffer L
[1:20:43] he himself shall be
[1:20:44] saved yet so as as amen praise God so we
[1:20:51] see that if any man's work abide which
[1:20:53] Heath built thereon he shall receive a
[1:20:54] reward so whatever work God's called you
[1:20:57] to do stay in that work make sure it's
[1:20:59] of God and God will reward you what if
[1:21:02] man's work shall be burned so if if the
[1:21:04] trial of God takes away the work or
[1:21:06] takes away their uh Ministry whatever
[1:21:08] like that because they weren't they
[1:21:10] really didn't have a heart for it they
[1:21:11] can still be saved but they lose their
[1:21:13] reward if God's called you to do a
[1:21:15] Ministry stay in that Ministry stay in
[1:21:17] the word of God hallelujah
[1:21:21] amen now that's right because look at
[1:21:23] verse 13 for every man's work shall be
[1:21:25] made manifest it's going to be made
[1:21:26] clear to all of us what we did on this
[1:21:28] Earth was it the work of God or was it
[1:21:29] the work of ourselves praise God Amen
[1:21:33] for the day shall declare see the day
[1:21:35] will declare when we go uh for the day
[1:21:38] of the Judgment because it shall be
[1:21:40] revealed by Fire and Fire shall try
[1:21:43] every man's work of what sort it is
[1:21:45] remember our God is consuming fire God
[1:21:48] will try all of our works whether
[1:21:49] they're of him or not amen amen
[1:21:52] hallelujah now look um
[1:21:55] I want to show you how winning Souls is
[1:21:57] such an important thing the Bible says
[1:22:00] he that wins Souls is wise how many
[1:22:01] knows that in Proverbs he that wins
[1:22:04] Souls is wise that's why we pray to win
[1:22:06] our children to Christ that's why we
[1:22:08] pray for people to come into the message
[1:22:10] the word of God and their souls be saved
[1:22:12] praise God I want to show you this right
[1:22:15] out of the scripture so let's go to uh
[1:22:18] uh Philippians 4:1 I want you to see
[1:22:20] this in Scripture
[1:22:25] when brother BR talks about people being
[1:22:27] uh the jewels in his crown that get
[1:22:29] saved in his Services that's exactly
[1:22:31] scriptural praise God so preachers or
[1:22:34] anyone that prays even women that pray
[1:22:36] for the services where people be saved
[1:22:38] brother bam said when you pray for a
[1:22:39] soul to be saved and they get saved or
[1:22:41] you send money for a missionary trip and
[1:22:43] the Soul gets saved that's a jewel in
[1:22:44] your crown amen amen hallelujah that's
[1:22:48] exactly right but look at this uh
[1:22:51] Philippians 4:1 we don't want to lose
[1:22:53] crowns
[1:22:55] by not doing what we should do serving
[1:22:57] others helping others pulling people the
[1:22:59] Bible said pulling them out of the fire
[1:23:00] we'll read that one next pulling them
[1:23:02] out of the fire just so they don't get
[1:23:03] lost so they're saved amen amen
[1:23:06] Philippians 4:1 I'm too busy talking to
[1:23:09] turn my Bible there okay all right
[1:23:12] Philippians 4:1 I'm gonna read this one
[1:23:15] therefore my brethren dearly beloved and
[1:23:17] long for my joy and what
[1:23:20] Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my
[1:23:24] dearly beloved amen amen Paul starts
[1:23:27] churches all over Europe right one of
[1:23:29] them is the Philippian church and he
[1:23:31] says all you Saints there you're my joy
[1:23:33] and you're my crown amen hallelujah
[1:23:37] hallelujah like when when our ministry
[1:23:39] one brother amen or brother van to the
[1:23:42] message that's our joy and that's our
[1:23:44] Crown amen glory that's exactly right
[1:23:47] Hallelujah because that's why the
[1:23:48] ministry is here to win souls to Christ
[1:23:51] amen and that becomes the crown of our
[1:23:54] Our Lives amen as we work together and
[1:23:56] pray and intercede for souls to be saved
[1:23:58] that becomes our Crown amen and it's
[1:24:00] scriptural go to first Thessalonians
[1:24:03] 2 completely
[1:24:05] scriptural 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 so
[1:24:09] right after that one in your Bible 1
[1:24:12] Thessalonians chapter 2 let me say like
[1:24:14] this brother Benjamin and our brother
[1:24:17] Austin here if they're saved under our
[1:24:19] ministry which could be very possible
[1:24:21] wherever they got saved you know where
[1:24:23] God knows
[1:24:25] it's a crown they're the crown to this
[1:24:27] ministry praise God hallelujah or if I
[1:24:30] got Sav I got saved under brother Brooks
[1:24:32] Ministry I'm a crown to that ministry
[1:24:34] right I'm a jewel in that Crown amen but
[1:24:37] then I can earn my own Crown right we
[1:24:39] can earn our own crowns amen that's
[1:24:41] exactly right because we'll look at that
[1:24:44] later okay now uh first Thessalonians 2
[1:24:49] yeah verse uh let's look at verse
[1:24:52] 18 19
[1:24:56] 20 okay I'll read this one wherefore we
[1:24:59] would have come unto you even I once
[1:25:00] again but Satan hindered us you ever try
[1:25:02] to do that you ever try to get somewhere
[1:25:04] and Satan hinders you from getting there
[1:25:06] Paul said I would have loved to come
[1:25:08] back to the church but Satan hindered me
[1:25:10] all right verse 19 for what is our hope
[1:25:13] our joy or crown of rejoicing are not
[1:25:18] even ye in the presence of our Lord
[1:25:20] Jesus that is coming so remember when
[1:25:23] Jesus comes back who comes comes to meet
[1:25:24] him in the air first the dead in Christ
[1:25:26] right and then we your alive go to meet
[1:25:29] them in the air but Paul said who's my
[1:25:31] crown when we meet Jesus in the air he
[1:25:33] said you are all my crown
[1:25:36] amen hallelujah so we're gonna meet God
[1:25:38] in the air now brother B says we'll
[1:25:40] actually go to the wedding supper have
[1:25:41] communion first and then rewards will be
[1:25:43] given out it's it's called the Judgment
[1:25:45] seat of Christ rewards will be given out
[1:25:47] after the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:25:49] and that's where uh the messenger of
[1:25:51] each age will present all those converts
[1:25:53] of his ministry amen hallelujah so Paul
[1:25:57] is going to present these Believers as a
[1:25:59] Chase virgin to Christ and this is his
[1:26:02] crown this is his reward am amen he have
[1:26:05] a crown and he'll have all the churches
[1:26:06] that he started there a part of his
[1:26:08] crown Hallelujah who's my crown you're
[1:26:11] my crown who's my joy you're my joy Paul
[1:26:14] says amen any Souls that we can win
[1:26:17] they'll be our Crown now Church remember
[1:26:20] this remember the parable of the workers
[1:26:22] in the vineyard the 11th Hour workers
[1:26:25] even though they didn't work as long or
[1:26:27] as hard as the other ones they got the
[1:26:28] same reward amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:32] so as long as we give all we can to
[1:26:33] Christ we know it's a dark hour we know
[1:26:35] this is not the age of the open door
[1:26:37] that was Philadelphia so we can't expect
[1:26:39] big huge revivals with bigger numbers
[1:26:41] like that that's not the age of that
[1:26:43] we're living in that was Philadelphia
[1:26:45] but if we win souls the Bible say we get
[1:26:47] the same reward amen we just got to do
[1:26:49] something for the kingdom of God win
[1:26:51] what we can do what we can try to spend
[1:26:54] our our time uh storing up Treasures in
[1:26:56] Heaven hallelujah amen glory let me read
[1:26:59] that quote again brother BR says all too
[1:27:01] little time is spent on laboring for the
[1:27:04] Eternal rewards of God or trying to do
[1:27:07] things upon the Earth store up things
[1:27:09] upon the Earth Jesus said store up
[1:27:10] Treasures in Heaven and that's always by
[1:27:14] serving other people brother said the
[1:27:16] reward of God is too lightly Este steem
[1:27:18] people aren't really thinking about
[1:27:19] rewards from God too much if we believe
[1:27:22] in the reality of the resurrection of
[1:27:23] the body and eternal Kingdom substance
[1:27:26] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[1:27:27] good Treasures that are available to the
[1:27:29] faithful Saints
[1:27:31] Hallelujah now that quot hopefully means
[1:27:33] more to you now by God's grace
[1:27:37] amen now let's go to uh Revelation
[1:27:40] 210 Revelation 210 another thing on
[1:27:44] crowns Revelation
[1:27:52] 210 how you got this one buddy
[1:27:54] Revelation
[1:27:57] 2:10 fear not of those things which Thou
[1:28:00] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:28:03] some of you into prison that you may be
[1:28:05] tried and you shall have tribulation 10
[1:28:07] days be thou faithful unto death and I
[1:28:10] will give thee a crowd of life amen
[1:28:13] praise God now notice brother B pulls
[1:28:15] this out of the church age book and he's
[1:28:17] writing about this he said notice it
[1:28:19] says be faithful unto death he said Not
[1:28:21] until death but be fa faithful in other
[1:28:24] words be faithful to give your life for
[1:28:27] Christ right amen be faithful unto death
[1:28:30] so whatever death you're called to give
[1:28:33] right be faithful to God unto death
[1:28:36] whatever death whether and brother said
[1:28:37] there's two kinds of death there's a
[1:28:39] martyr's death right and then there's
[1:28:42] one brother said that that's called a
[1:28:44] given life you give your life as a
[1:28:45] martyr brother said you get a crown for
[1:28:47] being given and then he said the other
[1:28:49] kind is you get a crown for striven stri
[1:28:52] those who strive daily and their lives
[1:28:54] daily to Christ Amen brother said
[1:28:57] there's two kinds of giving of of your
[1:28:59] life either given as a martyr or you
[1:29:02] strive striven you strive every day and
[1:29:05] S and sacrifice your own desires you
[1:29:07] crucify the affection and lust lust of
[1:29:10] the flesh thereof that you might gain
[1:29:12] eternal life amen but you must see we
[1:29:15] must be faithful unto the death God's
[1:29:17] called us to some people are called to
[1:29:19] be martyrs but some people a lot of us
[1:29:21] here in America we're called here to
[1:29:23] Faithfully serve and hold the banner of
[1:29:25] Christ unto death amen glory if not the
[1:29:30] Bible said we can lose our crown and
[1:29:32] Revelation 3:11 let's go to Revelation
[1:29:34] 311 Jesus says this it's not a words of
[1:29:36] a
[1:29:38] man but if we won't step up and do what
[1:29:41] God's called us to do somebody else will
[1:29:43] amen that's that's exactly right I've
[1:29:45] noticed that I'll tell after I read this
[1:29:47] I'll just tell a quick
[1:29:49] testimony uh Revelation 3:11 brother
[1:29:52] Austin you got that I'm sorry yeah 311
[1:29:55] yeah 311 got that behold I come quickly
[1:29:59] hold
[1:30:00] that hold that fast which thou Hast that
[1:30:03] no man take thy Crown amen so whatever
[1:30:05] you've got from God hold on to it that
[1:30:08] no man take your crown let me give you
[1:30:11] an example here a few years ago quite a
[1:30:13] few years ago now um there's a church uh
[1:30:16] that invited a certain brother to preach
[1:30:18] and the brother turned it down because
[1:30:20] he wanted to watch his son go play high
[1:30:21] school football he turned down these
[1:30:23] special meetings well the pastor felt
[1:30:26] led since he turned it down he felt led
[1:30:28] to call me so I went to the meetings and
[1:30:30] God moved in a great way a lot of
[1:30:32] repentance there a lot of souls that
[1:30:33] were uh hearing from God at the altar
[1:30:36] and receiving God's grace and mercy and
[1:30:38] things like that and now church just a
[1:30:42] year later that preacher that turned
[1:30:44] that work down left the message a
[1:30:47] preacher and he got all tattooed up and
[1:30:50] he drinks and he Po and I'm his friend
[1:30:52] on Facebook and he dances to a worldly
[1:30:54] music and gets drunk and cusses all the
[1:30:56] time now I'm not saying I got a reward
[1:30:59] but look here's a man who was called to
[1:31:01] a work turned it down later leaves the
[1:31:03] message right which is leaving the word
[1:31:05] of the hour right the truth of the hour
[1:31:08] and we wonder if he loses a crown or not
[1:31:11] I'd imagine it might be that way because
[1:31:13] he turns down the work of God and but if
[1:31:16] if God's called somebody to do it God
[1:31:18] will find somebody else to fill in his
[1:31:19] place if he don't want to do it praise
[1:31:21] God so think about the burden on your
[1:31:23] heart if you don't do something for God
[1:31:25] that God's put on the burden for you you
[1:31:27] might lose out on your crown amen amen
[1:31:30] that's why it's good if you got a burd
[1:31:32] on your heart you really believe it's
[1:31:33] God make sure you do it praise God put
[1:31:36] everything else aside to do what God's
[1:31:38] called you to do praise God or else
[1:31:41] somebody will take your crown someone
[1:31:43] will take that Victory you were supposed
[1:31:44] to get you were supposed to do that God
[1:31:46] called you to do it first but you got
[1:31:48] caught up in things and didn't do it
[1:31:51] right God help us by the gra to the Lord
[1:31:55] so can everybody see that you have to
[1:31:57] the treasure in you the Holy Ghost the
[1:31:59] kingdom of God then you'll sore up
[1:32:01] Treasures in Heaven which will earn
[1:32:04] Eternal rewards and will'll gain crowns
[1:32:07] we have jewels in our
[1:32:08] crowns praise God now let's I want to
[1:32:12] close with this because I've been about
[1:32:13] almost an hour I want to go about 15
[1:32:15] more minutes I want to close with
[1:32:17] brother Ram story about uh beyond the
[1:32:19] curtain of time praise God it's been a
[1:32:22] while since I preached on so I want to
[1:32:24] preach on that a long time it's actually
[1:32:26] been six years since I preached on this
[1:32:29] so I went back in my notes and looked at
[1:32:30] it by the grace of the
[1:32:32] Lord okay so let's look at this here so
[1:32:35] I'm going to be reading a little bit
[1:32:36] just try to stay with me
[1:32:39] here by God's
[1:32:41] grace now how many know brother B was
[1:32:44] preaching this and he told this story in
[1:32:45] the fif seal he was talking about how
[1:32:48] their uh the Jews who are the souls
[1:32:50] under the altar he had he said they're
[1:32:52] going to get right right white Rob Jesus
[1:32:54] said they'll get white robes uh of of
[1:32:56] life and brother man said this he said
[1:33:00] he said let me say this in the presence
[1:33:01] of him by his grace he also let me see
[1:33:05] my people not long ago in white robes he
[1:33:09] said you remember it and as actually in
[1:33:11] 1960 in May of 1960 brother brandom had
[1:33:14] the vision of going beyond the curtain
[1:33:15] of time so God let brother brandom go up
[1:33:18] into the sixth Dimension praise God
[1:33:20] there's seven dimensions God let brother
[1:33:22] brandom go into the sixth dimension
[1:33:24] and let's read that by God's grace now I
[1:33:27] told it many times uh so there's a lot
[1:33:29] of great scriptures to go over
[1:33:33] it okay so brother bam said the other
[1:33:35] morning I was laying in bed I just woke
[1:33:38] up and I began to wonder what it will be
[1:33:40] like on the other side in heaven I
[1:33:42] realized I live more than half of my
[1:33:45] life and I wanted to do more for the
[1:33:48] Lord before I left this life anybody
[1:33:49] want to do more for the Lord tonight I
[1:33:51] should do I don't want to lose my crown
[1:33:53] right uhhuh brother ra said I Heard a
[1:33:56] Voice saying you're just starting now
[1:33:58] this is in 1960 glory and God said
[1:34:01] you're just starting he died in
[1:34:03] 65 so look you can have five years left
[1:34:06] and be just starting and you can do so
[1:34:08] much for God in a short amount of time
[1:34:10] amen hallelujah he said you're just
[1:34:12] starting and he had five years left to
[1:34:14] live hallelujah amen now remember the
[1:34:17] previously he was a worldwide traveler
[1:34:19] but remember in 1962 God shut his
[1:34:21] traveling down and he stayed to sore up
[1:34:23] all the those tapes so God saw that as a
[1:34:26] greater work because it was the third
[1:34:27] pole amen it was the opening of the word
[1:34:30] revealing of the Mysteries of the powers
[1:34:32] of God to restore it back to the people
[1:34:34] God said that was a great thing he said
[1:34:37] you're just getting started to the
[1:34:38] opening of that uh that third poll by
[1:34:41] God's
[1:34:42] grace he said press the battle keep
[1:34:45] pressing again the voice said keep press
[1:34:48] the battle keep going keep
[1:34:51] going he said but I thought I possibly
[1:34:53] spoke words to myself the boy spoke
[1:34:56] again a third time just keep pressing if
[1:34:58] you only knew what is at the end of the
[1:35:01] road so when you die and cross over if
[1:35:03] you only knew what it's like to die and
[1:35:05] cross
[1:35:06] over then the voice asked me would you
[1:35:09] like to see just beyond the curtain and
[1:35:11] I answered it would help me so
[1:35:14] much my Hallelujah Church whenever we
[1:35:18] need a good encouragement we should come
[1:35:19] back to this Vision amen amen it will
[1:35:22] help us so much to know what it's going
[1:35:24] to be like over there
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:30] hallelujah he says now what happened I
[1:35:33] cannot say whether I was in the body or
[1:35:35] is a translation I do not know but it's
[1:35:38] unlike any Vision I ever had I could see
[1:35:41] the place to which I was taken I could
[1:35:43] see myself laying back there upon the
[1:35:45] bed I said that's a strange thing so I
[1:35:48] want you to see this he's laying in the
[1:35:49] bed brother like this and his wife's
[1:35:51] sleeping and he said oh if I could just
[1:35:53] uh see past the curtain of time that
[1:35:55] would help me so much and brother BR let
[1:35:57] me say like this brother bram's
[1:36:00] theophany Rises right must have came
[1:36:02] down and must have caught his soul it
[1:36:04] comes down and pulls
[1:36:06] him and he can look down he's he's a
[1:36:09] spirit being now theophany he can look
[1:36:11] back down and see his
[1:36:13] body praise God Amen other prophets did
[1:36:17] that like Ezekiel Ezekiel the Bible said
[1:36:19] that God picked up Ezekiel and carried
[1:36:21] him to certain places while he rest his
[1:36:24] body stayed there and God would carry
[1:36:25] Ezekiel and take him other places
[1:36:29] Hallelujah Glory he said I saw a strange
[1:36:33] thing there were great numbers of people
[1:36:35] and they came running to me crying oh oh
[1:36:38] our precious
[1:36:40] brother first came young women
[1:36:42] apparently in their early 20s and they
[1:36:44] would embrace me they would say our
[1:36:45] precious
[1:36:48] brother so he goes to this land where
[1:36:50] there's a beautiful Hills and streams
[1:36:52] I'm sorry flowers all these things so he
[1:36:54] goes up to the sixth Dimension brother
[1:36:56] BR said it was under the altar of God so
[1:36:59] if you read Revelation there is an altar
[1:37:00] of God so somewhere underneath that
[1:37:02] altar that must be the seventh Dimension
[1:37:04] so maybe under that in the sixth
[1:37:06] Dimension somehow that's where all
[1:37:09] that's where the paradise is now that's
[1:37:11] what the Bible calls it now Paradise
[1:37:13] because Paul said I was CAU up into the
[1:37:14] third heaven which must have been
[1:37:16] Paradise praise God Amen Hallelujah I
[1:37:20] can't explain it but I believe it the
[1:37:22] Bible says it amen amen
[1:37:24] he says young men of manhood eyes
[1:37:29] glistening like stars teeth as white as
[1:37:32] pearls embrac me saying our precious
[1:37:35] brother then I noticed that I too have
[1:37:37] become young again I looked at myself
[1:37:39] there and turn and look back at my old
[1:37:41] body lying on the bed with my hands
[1:37:42] behind my head I said I don't understand
[1:37:45] this look how close that Dimension is oh
[1:37:48] my Hallelujah that Dimension is so close
[1:37:51] to us hallelujah remember we read that
[1:37:53] in Acts 1 though he be not far from each
[1:37:55] one of us amen praise God he's not far
[1:37:58] from us that Dimension is not far it's
[1:38:00] actually very close he can look down and
[1:38:02] see his body and say there's the third
[1:38:04] there's the fourth dimension or there's
[1:38:05] the third dimension I'm up here in the
[1:38:07] sixth Dimension I can look down to the
[1:38:08] third
[1:38:09] dimension
[1:38:13] amen as I begin to comprehend the place
[1:38:16] where I was I realize there's no
[1:38:18] yesterday and no tomorrow no one seem to
[1:38:20] get tired amen as a multitude the most
[1:38:23] beautiful young women I've ever seen
[1:38:25] through their arms around me I
[1:38:27] discovered there was only a great love
[1:38:29] that overwhelmed me and no physical
[1:38:31] attraction in human behavior so he
[1:38:33] wasn't in this physical body when those
[1:38:34] women that were saved and all those men
[1:38:37] when they hugged him he didn't feel any
[1:38:38] sexual attraction because he was in a
[1:38:40] brand new body amen a theophany body the
[1:38:42] Bible calls a Celestial body an eternal
[1:38:45] body that's in the heavens amen amen
[1:38:47] that's right Second Corinthians chapter
[1:38:49] 5 it says
[1:38:51] that and I noticed these young women all
[1:38:53] wore their hair down to their waistlines
[1:38:56] okay so in heaven brother Austin the
[1:38:58] hair of the women goes from here all the
[1:39:00] way down to their waist God loves long
[1:39:03] hair amen God loves long
[1:39:06] hair glory and their skirts went down to
[1:39:09] their feet brother brandom said and in
[1:39:13] Revelation chapter one Jesus wears a
[1:39:15] garment that goes down to his feet
[1:39:17] that's why we wear long pants down to
[1:39:19] our feet praise God for brothers sisters
[1:39:22] that's why you wear long s because in
[1:39:24] heaven we're going to wear long garments
[1:39:26] we won't be showing off our our big
[1:39:28] strong legs and our big strong muscles
[1:39:29] will we no uhuh no sir because God don't
[1:39:32] glorify In the Flesh does he amen only
[1:39:34] glor he gets all the glory all glory
[1:39:36] goes to
[1:39:37] him
[1:39:39] amen after this hope his first wife his
[1:39:43] first wife died in 1933 I think it was
[1:39:47] she comes up and hugs and says my
[1:39:49] precious brother then another young
[1:39:51] woman hugged me and hope turned and me
[1:39:53] the young woman and I said I don't
[1:39:56] understand this this is something
[1:39:57] entirely different from our human love I
[1:39:59] don't want to go back to that old body
[1:40:01] on the
[1:40:03] bed then a voice spoke to me and said
[1:40:06] this is what you preached that the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost is this is perfect love nothing
[1:40:12] cannot nothing cannot enter here without
[1:40:15] it amen amen glory so what is divine
[1:40:18] love divine love is no sexual feelings
[1:40:21] amen it's just love for God's creation
[1:40:24] and no sexual no selfish anything that's
[1:40:27] Divine love and brother R says in the
[1:40:29] name of the Lord in other words thus
[1:40:31] sayth the Lord the only kind of love
[1:40:32] that will make it to this Dimension is
[1:40:34] perfect love amen amen glor thus say the
[1:40:37] Lord amen
[1:40:40] hallelujah next I was taken up and
[1:40:42] seated on a high place so after
[1:40:43] everybody hugs him and greets him now as
[1:40:45] a prophet he's taken up to a higher
[1:40:48] place above
[1:40:49] everybody and all around me were great
[1:40:51] numbers of men and women in the bloom of
[1:40:54] Youth they were crying with joy oh our
[1:40:56] precious brother we're so happy to see
[1:40:58] you here and I thought I I'm not
[1:41:00] dreaming for I can see these people and
[1:41:02] I can see my body laying back down there
[1:41:04] in
[1:41:05] bed oh my look how close that Dimension
[1:41:08] is he can he's all exalted up here as a
[1:41:11] preacher and look still look down and
[1:41:12] see his body on the bed there the Bible
[1:41:15] said we're surrounded by a great cloud
[1:41:16] of
[1:41:17] witnesses Hallelujah let us lay aside
[1:41:20] every sin that does but easily set us
[1:41:22] and run the race perseverance amen amen
[1:41:25] we've got an innumerable cloud of
[1:41:27] witnesses innumerable number of angels
[1:41:29] Hallelujah we must live like we're
[1:41:31] surrounded by Holiness amen because
[1:41:34] they're watching us they're right here
[1:41:36] they're around us it's close to us it's
[1:41:38] a close Dimension
[1:41:40] amen said I don't understand this The
[1:41:43] Voice spoke to me and said you know it
[1:41:45] is written in the Bible that the
[1:41:47] prophets were gathered to their people
[1:41:49] brother said yes I remember that in the
[1:41:51] scripture he says but are all these
[1:41:54] randoms do you remember the Old
[1:41:56] Testament when one of the Patriarchs
[1:41:58] would die where would they bury them
[1:41:59] they would bury them with their people
[1:42:01] that that died before praise God like
[1:42:04] with Sarah and Abraham Abraham bought a
[1:42:05] cave for Sarah's body and later he was
[1:42:08] gathered there right remember David and
[1:42:10] Solomon all their sons and so forth they
[1:42:12] were gathered and buried with their
[1:42:14] people right they're always gathered
[1:42:16] with their people and God The Voice told
[1:42:18] Brother brandom here in this dimension
[1:42:20] in the sixth Dimension you're gathered
[1:42:22] with your people and so it was all the
[1:42:24] people that were saved by a certain
[1:42:26] Prophet or Ministry or messenger of the
[1:42:28] day you're gathered with your people
[1:42:30] it's a family coming back together and
[1:42:32] it's a more precious it's not a physical
[1:42:34] blood it's a spiritual blood it's a
[1:42:37] spiritual family
[1:42:38] amen I won't be gathered with all the
[1:42:40] Smiths I'll be gathered with all the
[1:42:42] Christians amen of Leia Hallelujah is
[1:42:45] that right
[1:42:47] amen he says the voice replies that
[1:42:50] these are not randoms these these are
[1:42:53] your converts the ones that you've led
[1:42:56] to the
[1:42:57] Lord so see understand this in this
[1:43:00] Vision only converts are led to the Lord
[1:43:04] are in this place and what's the convert
[1:43:06] Jesus said in Luke 22:32 I looking up a
[1:43:09] board service Jesus told Peter when this
[1:43:11] is before the crucifixion when you get
[1:43:13] converted strengthen your brethren so a
[1:43:16] person is not converted which means
[1:43:18] changed until they're born again the
[1:43:20] Holy Ghost is that right so the sixth
[1:43:23] Dimension is only for people who are
[1:43:26] converts who are born again in the
[1:43:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost are you with
[1:43:29] Meen hallelujah
[1:43:33] amen some of these women you think were
[1:43:36] so young and beautiful here were more
[1:43:37] than nine years years old when you led
[1:43:40] them to the Lord so the people that are
[1:43:43] there are ones that were led to Christ
[1:43:45] amen hallelujah not just come to church
[1:43:48] right not for us but actually be led to
[1:43:50] Christ and love Christ and know Christ
[1:43:52] and serve
[1:43:54] Christ brother R said no the voice said
[1:43:57] no wonder they're crying out my precious
[1:44:01] brother then the multitude cried
[1:44:03] together so all these millions of people
[1:44:05] cried out together if you hadn't gone
[1:44:07] forth with the gospel we wouldn't be
[1:44:11] here
[1:44:13] hallelujah so what was brother Ram's
[1:44:15] work his work was to track leave his
[1:44:16] family and travel and preach the gospel
[1:44:20] praise God if he had not done that he
[1:44:22] would have lost his crme
[1:44:24] praise
[1:44:25] God so brother ask oh where is Jesus I
[1:44:29] want to see him the people replied he's
[1:44:32] just a little higher that must be the
[1:44:34] seventh Dimension right because the
[1:44:36] Bible said he ever liveth to make
[1:44:39] intercession right for us so he is
[1:44:41] sitting on the altar of God as a
[1:44:43] mediator as a type of the Arc of the
[1:44:46] Covenant as a type of of The Mercy Seat
[1:44:49] praise God because his blood has to lay
[1:44:51] upon the Heavenly Mercy Seat seat in
[1:44:53] order to cover our sins and intercede
[1:44:56] for us praise God just like the blood
[1:44:58] had to lay on The Mercy Seat Above the
[1:45:00] Law because we couldn't keep the law the
[1:45:02] law would condemn us but when blood was
[1:45:04] placed upon The Mercy Seat then the law
[1:45:06] could be satisfied amen hallelujah then
[1:45:09] the law wouldn't condemn us because a
[1:45:11] sacrifice had been condemned for us
[1:45:13] hallelujah oh glory amen so there in the
[1:45:17] sixth Dimension Christ was a step higher
[1:45:19] a little higher in the seventh dimension
[1:45:25] the people said he's just a little
[1:45:27] higher someday he will come to you you
[1:45:30] were sent as a
[1:45:31] leader and when God comes he will judge
[1:45:35] you according to your teaching
[1:45:36] Hallelujah I'm glad when I teach you
[1:45:38] Brothers the word it's all the Bible
[1:45:40] amen because I'll be judged by the word
[1:45:43] that I preach praise God we read that
[1:45:46] today remember also remember you read
[1:45:47] that the Bible said be not many Masters
[1:45:50] for we we receive the greater
[1:45:51] condemnation it's James 3 verse one read
[1:45:54] that this morning when we did Bible we
[1:45:55] did our chapter together this morning
[1:45:57] with our precious Brothers there I will
[1:45:59] be judged by what I preached if I preach
[1:46:01] the word I get a reward if I preach my
[1:46:03] own thoughts I lose could lose my I
[1:46:06] could lose eternal life I could lose my

[1:48:29] on uh a few more things I want to make
[1:48:32] sure I find this
[1:48:34] here can you bear with me just a moment
[1:48:36] I forgot I cut this up into different
[1:48:38] places
[1:48:41] here okay here it
[1:48:48] is okay now look here's where people get
[1:48:50] a little confused here now look what he
[1:48:52] says here after this he said we're
[1:48:54] resting on that right the people cry
[1:48:56] we're resting on the fact that you
[1:48:57] preach the gospel of Paul and Peter amen
[1:49:01] he said I looked and I could see the
[1:49:02] people just as far as I could see still
[1:49:05] coming can you imagine that people
[1:49:06] coming to meet you in heaven goodness
[1:49:09] they're still coming after all this
[1:49:10] conversation with the boys and all these
[1:49:12] people hugging him they're still coming
[1:49:14] to see him ah wanting to hug me
[1:49:17] screaming our precious brother our
[1:49:19] precious brother just then a voice said
[1:49:22] all that you ever loved and all that
[1:49:25] ever loved you God has given you
[1:49:28] here this is where I might be a little
[1:49:30] bit of disagreement but if you want
[1:49:32] disagree with me that's fine I don't
[1:49:34] believe this is referring to just people
[1:49:36] that he loved because you had to be a
[1:49:38] convert to get there praise God you had
[1:49:41] to be loved or you had to uh be led to
[1:49:44] serve God in order to get there right
[1:49:45] you have to be led to the Lord he had to
[1:49:47] lead you to Christ you had to be a
[1:49:49] convert to get there because look he
[1:49:51] says all that you ever love all I ever
[1:49:53] Lov you God has given to you and I
[1:49:55] looked and here come my old what
[1:49:59] dog right so if you just take the story
[1:50:02] when he says all that you ever loved and
[1:50:04] all that ever loved you what happens
[1:50:06] directly after that a dog comes up and
[1:50:07] licks his
[1:50:08] hand
[1:50:11] Fritz right Fritz he said and I looked
[1:50:15] hear my old dog come up walking up
[1:50:16] Fricks and here come my horse
[1:50:20] Prince a horse and a dog come up after
[1:50:24] he says everything you love I've given
[1:50:27] to
[1:50:28] you here come my horse and laid his head
[1:50:31] over my shoulder and
[1:50:34] nicker so Lydia if you love those horses
[1:50:37] guess what if you love Christ God will
[1:50:39] give you everything you love that's what
[1:50:41] I believe
[1:50:42] that if you take into context that's
[1:50:45] what he gave I remember remember when
[1:50:47] brother Bram remember when that uh that
[1:50:50] uh man in town ran over Fritz you
[1:50:52] remember that
[1:50:53] a man ran over his dog on purpose the
[1:50:55] brother said I was going to kill him but
[1:50:56] then he got saved and preached and then
[1:50:58] he eventually saved that man and
[1:51:00] baptized him but when brother randam
[1:51:02] buried Fritz he was digging the hole he
[1:51:04] buried him he said if there is a heaven
[1:51:06] Fritz he said you'll be there Glory
[1:51:10] because that dog helped him get uh
[1:51:13] animals and they sold those hides to get
[1:51:15] money to feed his
[1:51:17] family he said if there is a heaven you
[1:51:19] will be there and then when he gets to
[1:51:21] go to heaven Beyond the curtain of time
[1:51:23] he's there praise God Amen Hallelujah
[1:51:27] there's animals in heaven Hallelujah
[1:51:29] exactly
[1:51:34] right he said all that you ever loved
[1:51:36] and all that ever loved you God has
[1:51:38] given them into your hands through your
[1:51:40] ministry he
[1:51:45] says praise God and then he said I felt
[1:51:48] myself move from that beautiful place he
[1:51:50] oh I want to leave here and I looked
[1:51:51] around and I said are you awake honey
[1:51:53] she was still asleeping I thought oh god
[1:51:55] oh help me never let me compromise with
[1:51:57] one word let me stay straight on that
[1:51:59] word and preach it I don't care what
[1:52:00] comes or goes I don't care how many saws
[1:52:03] or sons of kisher eyes let me press to
[1:52:06] that place can I have five more minutes
[1:52:08] is that okay can I five more minutes
[1:52:11] okay now here brother ad says just
[1:52:14] remember this I'll say with the faith
[1:52:15] that I have in that Vision beyond the
[1:52:17] curtain of time I'll speak it in the
[1:52:19] name of the Lord except you have that
[1:52:21] perfect love you'll never be there
[1:52:23] because nothing could ever be there
[1:52:25] without it amen oh
[1:52:41] my let just be with me just a
[1:52:45] moment must
[1:52:47] be yeah must be one okay now this he
[1:52:51] also tells us in the time of the seals
[1:52:52] here as well by the grace of the Lord
[1:52:56] most you might remember this now he
[1:52:57] makes sure he tells it that it was just
[1:52:59] a
[1:52:59] dream that wasn't a vision he calls it a
[1:53:03] dream praise
[1:53:06] God okay so now he has a dream about
[1:53:09] crowns being given out this is in the
[1:53:10] six seal so in the fifth seal he talked
[1:53:13] about going beyond the curtain of time
[1:53:14] where they say we're resting on that all
[1:53:16] these things now the next night under
[1:53:18] the Sixth Seal when he preached about
[1:53:19] the six seal of tribulation he told a
[1:53:21] dream about when Christ were being given
[1:53:23] out this would have to be right after
[1:53:25] the marriage supper of the Lamb or
[1:53:26] something but listen to him tell the
[1:53:27] story I want to tell you a little thing
[1:53:29] that happened this was a dream I was
[1:53:31] asleep I never told this publicly before
[1:53:34] I told it to a couple people but never
[1:53:35] publicly as I know of and I dreamed
[1:53:37] about a month after that that I was
[1:53:39] standing one day and I was watching that
[1:53:41] great time not the Judgment now I don't
[1:53:44] believe the church ever comes to the
[1:53:45] Judgment I mean the bride goes to a
[1:53:48] judgment but I was there when crowns was
[1:53:51] being given out
[1:53:54] okay now turn to First Corinthians if
[1:53:57] you can real quick I want to show you
[1:53:58] there's a scripture where it says we all
[1:54:00] must stand before the Judgment seat of
[1:54:03] Christ anybody every everybody know that
[1:54:06] there is a judgment seat that we all
[1:54:07] must stand for if you're the
[1:54:10] bride I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 5:10 sorry
[1:54:14] 2 Corinthians
[1:54:17] 5:10 if you're the bride you stand
[1:54:19] before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:54:22] sometime on the marriage supp of the
[1:54:24] Lamb during the tribulation while the
[1:54:25] Earth is going through that we're not in
[1:54:27] that we're up in uh the marriage supp of
[1:54:29] the Lamb we get crowns up there right
[1:54:33] that's exactly right but at the white
[1:54:35] Throne judgment after the thousand years
[1:54:37] that's where everybody else stands
[1:54:38] before Christ and that's not a merciful
[1:54:40] god that's a a angry god brother brandom
[1:54:42] says Jesus is an Angry God judging
[1:54:45] people at the white Throne judgment we
[1:54:47] don't go through that we sit on the
[1:54:49] throne with Christ during that time but
[1:54:51] the Judgment seat of Christ is where
[1:54:52] we're given crowns and rewards amen
[1:54:56] that's second Corinthians
[1:54:58] 5:10 okay Malachi got that second
[1:55:01] Corinthians
[1:55:04] 510
[1:55:06] all Jud Christ that everyone may receive
[1:55:10] the things done in his body according to
[1:55:13] that he ha done whether it be good or
[1:55:15] bad amen we must all appear before the
[1:55:19] Judgment seat of Christ to receive
[1:55:21] reward
[1:55:23] praise God now let me continue this
[1:55:26] story brother said I had a dream and
[1:55:28] crowns were being given out he said this
[1:55:30] wasn't the white Throne judgment this
[1:55:32] was the Judgment seat of Christ for
[1:55:34] rewards that's during that's after the
[1:55:36] marriage supper of the Lamb he gives
[1:55:38] rewards now and brother B said I saw
[1:55:41] that great big Throne set up there and
[1:55:43] Jesus I'm sorry the recording Angel was
[1:55:46] there in Jesus and all standing around
[1:55:48] there and there was a stair steps like
[1:55:50] coming down this way of white ey
[1:55:53] the white Ivory throat run down in a
[1:55:56] circle and made a panoramic like this
[1:55:58] and went out so that all this great host
[1:56:01] standing out there could see what was
[1:56:02] happening so just one Circle it's like a
[1:56:04] big circle of white Ivory and everybody
[1:56:06] can see what's happening everybody can
[1:56:07] see everybody
[1:56:11] else and I was standing back way back on
[1:56:14] one side and I was standing there never
[1:56:15] had an idea that I would walk them steps

[1:56:43] and say it was well done my good and
[1:56:44] faithful servant now enter in so you got
[1:56:47] the picture there's all this huge
[1:56:48] multitude and brother M heard people's

[1:56:58] given crowns and they get to enter in
[1:57:00] heaven or maybe this is the marriage
